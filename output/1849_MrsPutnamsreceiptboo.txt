PREFACE. 



This little book is the result of twenty years 1 experience, 
on the part of the author, in housekeeping. The receipts 
which it contains were, in great part, originally written 
down for her own convenience ; others from time to time 
have been added, with the hope that they might be of 
service to her daughters. She has been led to suppose 
that they might be iqpde useful to others, also ; and for 
this reason, with the advice and encouragement of those 
on whom she ought to rely, they are now published. 

Without comparing this book with any other works of a 
similar character, it is thought that it proposes the three 
following characteristics : 

1. It contains no receipt which the author has not 
herself tried and proved, experimentally, to be good. 

2. It contains a sufficient number of receipts to meet all 
the ordinary wants of a family. 

3. A third object kept constantly in view has been to 
provide receipts, which will enable one to furnish a table 
handsomely, at the smallest expense. 

Great attention has been given to the last point. Few 
persons are aware what a difference the mode of cooking 
makes in the cost of a year's housekeeping. Without any 



iv PREFACE. 

increase of expenditure, one person, by means of good 
receipts, skilfully used, and by a tasteful arrangement of 
the table, will make a feast out of the articles of food 
which would have hardly sufficed another for the most 
indifferent meal. There are housekeepers whose table, 
notwithstanding great extravagance, «is always disorderly 
and uninviting. They do not know how to make use 
of their materials, and they never get beyond a coarse, 
uninviting abundance. There are others, who, with the 
cheapest materials, and with very limited means, through 
good taste, good judgment, and good cooking, have always 
a table richly and handsomely furnished. 

In this, and in other respects, the intention has been to 
prepare a work for practical use. One of the greatest 
conveniences to a young housekeeper, is a Cook-Book, on 
the excellence of whose judgment she may rely-; while 
few things embarrass her more than one which is filled, 
not with a selection, but with an indiscriminate collection 
of receipts, good, bad, and indifferent, brought together 
hap-hazard, without any reference to their real value. 
This book has at least the negative merit of containing 
nothing inserted merely to swell the size of the volume ; 
and it is believed that it may claim the positive merit of 
containing good and economical rules, sufficient to meet 
any wants which are likely to occur in the common round 
of a housekeeper's life.

quarts of water ; ten good potatoes boiled half an 
hour, and mashed very fine. Strain the water from 
the hops on to the potatoes, very hot; stir in two 
table-spoonsful of salt, and one pint of flour ; set it 
to cool. When lukewarm add one pint of good 
brewer's yeast, and let it rise six hours. Strain all 
through a cullender or sieve ; put into a stone jug 
stopped tight. It will keep three weeks in winter, 
and one week in summer. '

a little warm water; knead this well into dough, 
divide it into two loaves, and bake, in a tolerable hot

fine, add a little flour, and made the same as 
above. 



RECEIPTS. 



SOUPS. 

a calf's head soup. 

The head should be soaked in cold water, and 
washed very clean ; to a large head take six quarts 
of water; boil it four hours; (the head may be 
dressed for dinner by directions on page 37 ;) strain 
the liquor into a stone jar, and set it away to cool 
over night, or until the fat cools ; then skim off the 
fat ; take two quarts of the liquor, one dozen cloves, 
one dozen pepper-corns, salt, two onions, two carrots 
and two turnips cut fine; boil this two hours; cut 
into small pieces what you have left of the head, 
or as much as is required, put it into a sauce-pan, 
with the rest of the stock, and boil it one hour ; strain 
the liquor in which the vegetables were boiled, into 
this, and let it boil an hour and a half; then add 
three spoonsful of browned flour, braided into half a 
pound of butter and a pint of red. wine ; give it one 
boil. Have ready some force-meat balls, made of 
some of the head and brains, chopped fine and sea* 
soned with pepper, salt, cloves, and sweet herbs, 
mixed very hard with two eggs, and fried in 'hot 
butter, also six eggs boiled hard, and two lemons 
sliced ; put the force-meat balls, lemon, the yolk of 
the eggs, and three table-spoonsful of soy, into the 
bottom of the.tureen ; then turn the soup on this, and 
send it to the table very hot. All this will make 
about five quarts of soup. 



SOUPS. % 7 

GUMBO SOUP. 

Take a shin of veal and an old fowl ; put them 
into a soup pot with two carrots and two turnips 
sliced, an onion whole, and six quarts of water ; boil 
it five hours ; take out the chicken, and cut it into 
small pieces ; cut two onions up in slices, fry them 
brown in butter ; then take out the onion, and put 
in the pieces of chicken, and fry them brown ; put 
the onions into a saucepan, shake a little flour into 
the hot butter, stirring it all the time ; care should 
be taken that this does not oil or burn. When this 
is done, put it in with the chicken ; strain the soup 
into it, and boil it half an hour. Take three quarts 
of oysters, wash them out of the liquor, strain the 
liquor into the soup, put the oysters in, and let it boil 
up once ; mix three table-spoonsful of gumbo in half 
a pint of cold water ; stir this in the soup, while the 
soup is boiling, but do not let it boil after the gumbo 
is put in. 

Send to the table with the soup, a dish of boiled 
rice to eat with it ; a spoonful of it should be served 
with each plate of soup. 

PEA SOUP. 

Put one quart of peas to soak over night in soft 
water ; tha next morning wash them out, and put 
them into a soup pot with two carrots, two onions, a 
stock of celery, and four quarts of water ; let this 
boil four or five hours ; (have boiling water at hand 
to add, as the water boils away much faster in pea

soup than any other kind) ; strain the soup through a 
very coarse sieve; have a piece of salt pork boiled 
in another pot one hour ; then take it out and skin 
it ; put the soup and the pork back into the pot, and 
boil it gently one hour, frequently stirring it with a 
large spoon ; great care should be taken that it does 
not scorch. 

OYSTER SOUP. 

Take a shin of veal, put it into a pot with three 
quarts of water, two carrots and two onions cut up, 
pepper and salt; boil it three hours, then strain it 
all through a sieve ; add three quarters of a pound 
of butter braided in three table-spoonsful of flour ; 
stir it in, and give it one boil ; have ready washed 
out of the liquor one gallon of oysters ; strain the 
liquor into the soup; let it boil up; then put in the 
oysters, and a tumbler and a half of white wine ; 
give it one boil, and send it to the table very hot. 

WHITE OYSTER SOUP 

Is made the same as the above, with the excep- 
tion of the wine ; instead of which, put a pint and 
a half of cream — and stir all the time until it is 
dished. 

LOBSTER SOUP. 



Take a shin of veal, two carrots, two onions, pep- 
per, salt, mace, and four quarts of water. Boil it 
three or four hours. Break up a large lobster, take 
the meat out of the shell, break the shell up, and 



soups. 9 

put it into a saucepan with water enough to cover 
it. Let this simmer while the soup is boiling; then 
strain all this, and put it back into the soup pot ; cut 
the lobster very fine, and put it into the soup ; and 
boil it two hours. If you have the row of coral of 
the lobster, grate it and put it into the soup; it 
adds very much to the appearance of the soup. Add 
a quarter of a pound of butter, braided into two 
spoonsful of flour, a cup of white wine, and a spoon- 
ful of vinegar or the juice of a lemon. 

VERY GOOD SOUPS 

May be made with very little expense. In the 
winter you can keep cold meat an.d poultry bones 
several days, until you have enough to make a very 
nice stock, or the water that mutton, chicken, or 
turkey is boiled in. Let it stand in an earthen jar, 
and it will keep in cold weather two or three days. 

A VERY SIMPLE SOUP. 

Skim off the fat from mutton or chicken stock, 
put it into a soup pot with two or three carrots, tur- 
nips and onions, a cup of rice, the bones and bits of 
cold meat, pepper, salt, and a few tomatoes if you 
have them. Boil it four hours ; then take out the 
bones and send it to the table. 

A ROAST BEEF AND BOILED TURKEY SOUP. 

Take the liquor that the turkey is boiled in, and 
the bones of the turkey and beef, put them into a 



10 EECEIPTS. 

soup pot with two or three carrots, turnips and 
onions, half a dozen cloves, pepper, salt, and toma- 
toes if you have any. Boil it four hours, then strain 
all out. Put the soup back into the pot, mix two 
table-spoonsful of flour in a little cold water; stir it 
into the soup ; give it one boil ; cut some bread dice- 
form, lay it in the bottom of the tureen, pour the 
soup on to it, and color it with a little soy. 

ROAST VEAL AND CHICKEN-BONES 

Make a very nice soup boiled with vegetables as 
the above ; but add a handful of maccaroni, break 
it up fine, and boil the soup half an hour after it is 
put in. Color the soup with a little soy or catsup. 

ROAST VENISON SOUP. 

Break up the bone, put it into a soup pot with 
about four quarts of water, carrots, onions, pep- 
per, salt and cloves. Boil it three hours, then strain 
it. Take half a pound of butter braided in three 
spoonsful of flour and stir into the soup ; let it boil 
up once ; then add half a pint of red wine ; cut 
some pieces of toasted bread in dice-form, and lay 
in the bottom of the tureen. Turn the soup on to it. 

TO MAKE STOCK FOR WHITE SOUP AND GRAVIES. 

Put two knuckles or shins of veal, two onions, 
two table-spoonsful of salt, into eight quarts of wa- 
ter. Boil this six hours ; strain it into a stone jar, 



wvi ' ^^^^^^^^^^^mmm^^^mm^^i 



SOOTS. 11 

and keep it in a cold place. When it is cold, take 
off the fat* 

WHITE SOUP. 

Take as much of the stock as you think you 
want, put it into a saucepan with one or two carrots 
and turnips, one onion, a little rice or vermicelli, and 
about one fourth as much water as you have stock ; 
a very little mace, pepper and salt, is required. Boil 
this one hour. Take out the vegetables, and serve 
it with the rice or vermicelli only. 

A WHITE VEGETABLE SOUP. 

Take a third as much water as you want soup ; 
two carrots, two turnips, and two onions, cut them 
in dice-form ; a very little celery, a table-spoonful of 
salt, and a little mace. Put this all into a saucepan, 
boil it one hour, add the two-thirds of stock. Boil 
this all together three quarters of an hour. If it is 
not seasoned to your taste, add whatever is required. 

VERMICELLI SOUP. 

Put a shin of veal, one onion, two carrots, two 
turnips, and a little salt, into four quarts of water. 
Boil this three hours ; then add two cups of vermi- 



* This is very useful to put into any kind of white meat 
soups, gravies, and pies. There should be great care taken to 
skim all kinds of soups, particularly those made of fresh meat. 
The scum rises very thick just before it begins to boil, and that 
is the proper time to skim it. 



12 RECEIPTS. 

celli, and boil it an hour and a half longer. Then, 
before serving, take out the bone and vegetables. 

.. ANOTHER WHITE SOUP. 

Make soup as above. Beat up two or three eggs 
and put into the tureen ; then strain the soup 
through a sieve on to the eggs, stirring them all 
the time. Send it to the table immediately, or the 
eggs will settle if allowed to stand. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

Boil a shin of veal three hours, or take some soup 
stock. Cut up two onions, two carrots, and two tur- 
nips, and put with it ; also pepper, salt, and one 
dozen tomatoes. Boil this two hours, and strain it 
through a sieve. Toast some pieces of bread a light 
brown, cut them in dice-form, and put them into the 
tureen. The soup should be turned on to the toast 
just before it is taken to the table, as soaking long 
spoils it. 

MUTTON BROTH. 

Boil a shoulder of mutton in four quarts of water 
two hours. Add one onion, two turnips, two carrots 
cut fine, one table-spoonful of salt, and one cup of 
rice. Boil this an hour and a half; cut a little pars- 
ley, and put it in five minutes before dishing. Dish 
the mutton with drawn butter and capers. Garnish 
the dish with carrots and turnips.

to make stock fqr brown soup. 

Take two shins of beef, a shin of veal, eight 
quarts of water, one dozen cloves, and one dozen 
pepper-corns. Boil this eight hours; strain it into a 
stone jar, and when it is cold remove the fat. 

This is a very nice stock to use instead of water 
in making gravies for any kind of dark meat, such 
as beef, mutton, venison, and all kinds of wild 
fowl. 

A SHIN OF BEEF SOUP. 

• 

It is better to have the beef boiled the day before 
the soup is wanted ; if that is not convenient, have 
the shin cracked up well, put it to boil in five or six 
quarts of water, boil it five or six hours, skim it very 
often ; cut up very fine half of a white cabbage, chop 
two turnips, three carrots, and three onions; put 
them into the soup, with pepper and salt, and boil it 
two hours ; half an hour before serving take out the 
bone and gristle. If you have some raised dough, 
make up a dozen little balls the size of a nutmeg, 
and drop them into the soup, and boil it half an 
hour. 

OX-TAIL SOUP 

May be made as the above. Straining the vege- 
tables out, put the soup back into the pot; mix a 
pint of thickening of flour and water, season it with 
pepper, salt, and a little cloves ; stir this all into the 
soup, and let it boil half an hour. The ox-tails are 
dressed the same, and put in instead of the shins. 



14 RECEIPTS. 



GIBLET SOUP. 



Take a scrag of veal, one dozen giblets, a little 
mace, pepper, salt, two onions, two carrots; put 
them into a pot with three quarts of water, and boil 
it three hours ; strain the soup ; cut up the gizzard 
and braid up the liver ; put them into the soup ; mix 
two spoonsful of flour with a quarter of a pound of 
butter; stir this into the soup with a cup of red 
wine, and let it boil up once. 

COLD BEEF BONE, PIECES OF STEAK, ETC. 

Put them into a pot with three or four quarts of 
water, two or three carrots, turnips and onions, a few 
cloves, pepper, salt, and half a dozen tomatoes if you 
have them ; boil it gently three or four hours, then 
strain it all out, put the soup back into the pot ; mix 
a table-spoonful of flour with water, stir it into the 
soup, and let it boil ten minutes ; cut some pieces of 
toast fine, and put in. 

A BROWN BEEF SOUP. 

Cut what is called a vein of a round of beef in a 
square handsome form, weighing about six pounds ; 
put it into a pot with four or five quarts of water, a 
dozen cloves, pepper and salt, and boil it three hours ; 
cut in dice-form some carrots and turnips, chop up 
two onions and a head of celery, toast brown two 
slices of bread, put them all into the soup, and boil 



soups. 13 

it two hours ; then take out the meat if it is not 
quite brown enough, and add a little soy. 

This piece of meat makes a very nice dish next 
day. Cut up two carrots, one turnip, and two onions 
in dice-form; put the meat and vegetables into a 
sauce-pan, and add pepper, salt, a little cloves, and 
just water enough to cover the meat ; stew it gently 
two or three hours ; take out the meat, mix a little 
flour in water, and two spoonsful of mixed mustard; 
stir these into the gravy, give it one boil, and turn 
the gravy and vegetables over the meat. 

A SOUP MADE QUICKLY 

Take two quarts of soup stock, put it to boil with 
an onion, two carrots and one turnip chopped fine, 
and season it with pepper and salt ; if it is made of 
brown stock, add half a tea-spoonful of cloves, and 
boil it half an hour, then add a cup of red wine ; but 
if it is made of white stock, put in half a tea-spoonful 
of ground mace, and a cup of white wine. 

beef soup. 

Take a head of celery, one quarter of a white cab- 
. bage shaved very fine, three carrots, two turnips, and 
two onions cut very fine; put this all into a soup pot, 
with two quarts of cold water, and boil it two hours j 
then add two quarts of the beef stock, boil this one 
hour ; then take three spoonsful of flour, mix it with 
half a pint of water and a little salt and pepper ; stir 
this into the soup half an hour before serving it ; put

two table-spoonsful of India soy into the tureen, turn 
the soup on to it, stir it up, and serve it very hot. 

CLEAR BEEF SOUP. 

Make it as the above ; put some pieces of bread 
toasted brown and cut into dice-form into the bottom 
of the tureen, and strain the soup on it through a 
sieve. 



FISH. 

CHOWDER. -- 

Take a cod weighing about six pounds, and a 
haddock weighing four pounds; cut them in pieces 
about six inches square, wash them clean and wipe 
them dry, and dredge them with a little flour; cut 
into slices about a quarter of a pound of salt pork and 
two onions ; fry the pork a nice brown in a pot large 
epough to make the soup in - then take out the pork 
and fry the onions, and be careful not to burn them ; 
when these are done, put into the hot fat a layer of 
fish, then put in a little of the onion, a few bits of 
pork, a little pepper and salt, dredge in some flour ; 
and if you like the flavor put in a little tomato, then 
another layer of fish, and then the seasoning, and 
continue this until the fish and seasoning are all in 
the pot ; split eight hard crackers, dip them into cold 



PISH. 17 

water, and lay them over the fish ; put in hot water 
enough to cover the fish, and after it begins to boil, 
let it boil thirty minutes. Some like half milk and 
half water; if milk is used, the tomato should be 
omitted ; for those who like spice, a little clove and 
mace, with a quart of red wine, is a great improve- 
ment. 

BOILED COD. 

The head and shoulders is considered the best to 
boil ; lay it into cold water, with a handful of salt, 
and let it remain one hour; then scrape and wash it 
clean, rub a little salt and cayenne pepper into the 
body, flour a cloth, pin the fish up tight, and put it 
into boiling water ; after it begins to boil, let it boil 
thirty minutes, or according to the size of the fish ; 
serve it with drawn butter or oyster sauce. 

BAKED COD. 

A fish weighing six or eight pounds is a good size 
to bake; it should be cooked whole to look well. 
Make a dressing of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, par- 
sley, and onion, and a little salt pork chopped fine ; 
mix this up with 'one egg, fill the body, sew it up, 
lay it into a large pan ; lay across it some strips of 
salt pork to flavor it; put one pint of water and a 
little salt into the pan; bake it an hour and a half; 
baste it often with butter ; dish the fish, shake into 
the gravy a little flour, a little butter, and two spoons- 
ful of tomato or walnut catsup ; give it one boil, and 
turn it over the fish.

Clean all off but the heads ; prepare them the 
same as smelts. They require a longer time to fry 
than smelts, being larger and thicker. 

Fresh cod's tongues, fried in the same way, are 
very nice.

FRIED SALMON. 

Cut the salmon into slices half an inch thick, 
shake some flour over them, and fry them in butter, 
or in sweet oil, or with egg and crumbs, as smelts. 

FRIED HALIBUT 

Is fried the same way as salmon. 

BOILED SALMON. 

Salmon should be well cleansed, but not soaked 
in water ; rub a little salt into the body, flour a cloth 
and pin it up, and put it into boiling water. For a 
piece weighing six pounds, after it begins to boil let 
it boil about half an hour. Serve it with drawn 
butter and eggs, or lemon fish sauce, or lobster 
sauce. 

BROILED SALMON. 

It may be either cut in slices, as fried salmon, or 
split to the tail ; broil it very quick, and when it is 
dished rub some butter over it. 

BOILED HALIBUT. 

Some like the tail best, but the next cut is nicest, 
and a much handsomer piece to dish. Rub a little 
salt over it, and lay it in cold water a little while ; 
then wash it and scrape it very clean, put it into a 
floured cloth, and then into boiling water. A piece 
weighing eight pounds would require thirty-five 
minutes to cook. 



FISH. 21 

BROILED HALIBUT. 

The nape, a large one, is the best piece for broil- 
ing. Sprinkle a little flour over it, wash it, and wipe 
it dry ; put the outside to the fire first, and broil it 
moderately a half an hour. When it is dished, 
spread a little butter and pepper over it. 

BROILED MACKEREL. 

Split it down the back, sprinkle it with a little 
salt) and broil it before a quick fire. Put the outside 
to the fire first. When done, spread over it some 
butter, and send it to the table very hot. 

BOILED MACKEREL. 

Draw the inwards out at the vent, and then put 
the mackerel, if two, into separate cloths. Boil them 
twenty minutes, and serve them with drawn butter. 

SMALL MACKEREL 

Are very nice, cut and fried the same as cod fish. 

SALMON TROUT. 

Salmon trout are broiled or fried the same as 
mackerel. Serve it with fish sauce.* 

TAUTOG, OR BLACK FISH. 

This fish is very hard to clean. Lay them in a 
pan, and pour boiling-hot water over them; then 



23 RECEIPTS. 

scrape them very hard until yon get off all the 
scales; then wash and clean them in cold water. 
Let them lay in salt and water a while. Make a 
dressing of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, a little clove, 
a great d4al of parsley, one onion, and a little salt 
pork, chopped fine. Mix this all up with a little 
butter. Then stuff the fish, and sew it up ; put it 
into an iron pan, lay some strips of salt pork over it 
to flavor it, and put into the pan a pint of water and 
a pint of red wine ; set it into the oven of the range, 
and do not quite close the door. Let it stew gently 
one hour and a half. Baste it very often with the 
wine and butter. When the fish is done, thicken 
the gravy with a little flour and butter; give it one 
boil, and turn it over the fish. 

EELS. 

After they are skinned, turn boiling water over 
them, and let them remain about half an hour. To 
fry them, cut them up in pieces about six inches 
long, and fry them the same as codfish. 

BAKED EELS. 

Sprinkle some flour over them, and some pieces 
of butter ; put them into a pan with a little water, 
and bake them half an hour. When they are dished, 
make a gravy in the dish that they were baked in 
with some butter, flour, a little water, mustard and 
catsup. Give it one boil, and turn it on the eels.

SALT FISH, OE DUN FISH. 

If you wish to cook a fish whole, put it into the 
fish kettle with six or eight quarts of water at night; 
the next morning wash it clean out of the water, 
wash out the kettle, put in th& fish again, with as 
much clean water as at first, and set it«o near the 
fire as to scald, but not to boil. One hour before 
dinner tijne, take the fish up into a pan of clean cold 
water, wash off all the skin and fins, wash out the 
kettle again, and lay in the fish carefully ; add fresh 
water, and set the kettle on the fire to boil thirty 
minutes ; dish it in a clean napkin, on a fish dish ; 
to eat with drawn butter and pork scraps. 

To make what is called scraps, cut a quarter of a 
pound of fat salt pork into very small square pieces; 
put it into a frying-pan, stirring them frequently until 
the fat is extracted, and the scraps are done light 
brown. • 

If you do not wish to cook a whole fish, cut it 
into pieces about eight inches square ; when dished, 
garnish with eggs boiled hard, and cut into slices, 
with boiled beets. Beets should always be served 
with salt fish. 

TO MINCE FISH. 

Chop the fish veiy fine ; chop half as much more 
boiled potatoes as fish; fry out the pork as before 
stated; mix the potatoes and fish together, put it 
into the hot fat, stir it up well, add a little hot water 
and a piece of butter the size of an egg ; stir it all 



24 RECEIPTS. 

up well until it gets very hot; let it stand until it 
browns a little, and serve it hot ; or mince the fish as 
before directed, make it into balls, and fry them in 
pork or butter. 

STEWED OYSTERS. 

Wash a gallon of oysters ; let the liquor stand and 
settle about ten minutes; strain it through a fine 
sieve into a saucepan ; add one third as much cold 
water as liquor, and a quarter of a pound of butter; 
braid into it a little flour or cracker crumbs, and stir 
this into the liquor ; add a little cayenne pepper, and 
mace if liked, and boil this up ; add the oysters, toast 
half a dozen crackers, and butter them a little ; lay 
them into the oyster dish, and pour the oysters on to 
them. Before dishing, add a wine glass of white 
wine, or half a wine glass of vinegar. 

SCOLLOPED OYSTERS. 

Wash out of the liquor two quarts of oysters; 
pound very fine eight soft crackers, or grate a stale 
loaf of bread ; butter a deep dish, sprinkle in a layer 
of crumbs, then a layer of oysters ; a little mace, 
pepper, and bits of butter ; another layer of crumbs, 
another of oysters, then seasoning as before, and so 
on, until the dish is filled ; cover the dish over with 
bread crumbs, seasoning as before ; turn over it a cup 
of the oyster liquor, or a cup of white wine ; set it 
into the oven for thirty or forty minutes to brown. 



FISH. 25 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

Take large oysters, wash them dean out of the 
liquor, and wipe them dry ; dip them in eggs, and 
then in crumbs, and fry them in hot fat. 

A DISH OF COLD OYSTERS 

Is very nice in warm weather, to serve before 
meats instead of soup. 

OYSTER PIE. 

Wash out of the liquor two quarts of oysters ; 
season them with pepper, a little mace, a glass of 
white wine ; add a cup of very fine cracker crumbs, 
and some little bits of butter ; put them into the pie 
dish, lined with paste ; add half the liquor. The 
dish must be quite full, and covered with a rich puff 
paste ; baked until the crust is done. 

OYSTER PATTIES. 

Line small patty pans with a good paste; cut 
some covers to the pans with a rich puff paste ; bake 
the crust on tin sheets ; wash a quart of oysters out 
of the liquor, and put them into a saucepan; add a 
piece of butter the size of an egg, half a tea-spoonful 
of mace, a wineglass-full of white wine, the juice of 
a lemon, and a very little flour ; give them one scald, 
stirring all the time; fill the patties, put on the crust, 
and send to the table immediately, as the crusts 
should not get soaked before using them.

STEWED LOBSTER. 

Take out all the meat and soft part from the body, 
and cut it up into small bits ; put them into a sauce- 
pan with two cups of white stock, a little mace, 
cayenne and salt; drudge in some flour, some bits of 
butter, and stew it about ten or fifteen minutes ; stir 
it frequently, and when done, add a little vinegar or 
white wine.

ROAST BEEF. 

A piece of beef weighing ten pounds, requires two 
hours to roast. Allow ten minutes to every pound 
over or under this weight. Do not put the meat too 
close to the- fire at first. When half done turn the 
fat out of the roaster, then baste the meat with the 
drippings of the meat two or three times. Do not 
salt or flour it until nearly done. Just before dish* 
ing, dredge on a little salt and flour, baste it well, 
and set it close to the fire to froth. 

The second cut of the sirloin, the second cut of 
the ribs, and the back of the rump, are considered 
the best parts for roasting.

TO MAKE A GOOD BEEP GRAVY. 

Take the drippings from the meat, turn it into 
a saucepan, and add a cup of boiling water; shake 
in a little flour and salt, and let it just come to a boil, 
stirring it all the time; add a table-spoonful of soy 
or tomato catsup. 

BEEF STEAK*. 

A rump steak is the best; a sirloin is the next best. 
To broil a steak requires a quick fire. If cooked by 
a range, it should be put in front, and not on the 
top. Never use a fork to turn the steak, nor salt it 
while cooking. 

A steak half an inch thick requires ten minutes, 
and one an inch thick requires fifteen minutes. 
Have ready a hot dish, put the steak upon it, and a 
little butter upon both sides ; salt and pepper to suit 
the taste ; adding a little tomato catsup to the 
gravy improves it 

Waterman's patent gridiron is the best to use with 
a range. 

BEEF STEAK WITH OYSTER SAUCE. 

Cook the steak as above. Take the liquor of a 
quart of oysters, put it into a saucepan with about 
six ounces of butter mixed with a little flour, and let 
it come to a boil ; turn in the oysters ; let this boil 
up once ; turn it on the steak, and send it to the 
table very hot 



28 RECEIPTS. 

BEEF STEAK WITH SMOTHERED ONIONS. 

Cook the beef steak as before directed. Cut up 
six onions very fine, put them into a saucepan with 
a cup of hot water, a piece of butter about the size 
of an egg, pepper, salt, and a little flour ; let it stew 
until the onioils are quite soft; turn this over the 
steak quite hot. 

ALAMODE BEEF. 

Take a piece of the round of beef, weighing about 
ten or twelve pounds ; tie it up with a strong string, 
in the form of a round. Take half a table-spoonful 
of pepper, one of salt, one of ground cloves, and 
two of sugar; rub these all over the meat the night 
before it is to be cooked ; make a nice force meat of 
half a brick loaf of crumbs, two sausages, one onion 
chopped fine, two table-spoonsful of sweet herbs, one 
of cloves, one of salt, half a one of pepper, and two 
eggs. Mix them well together. Make holes in your 
meat about two inches apart, fill them with the 
dressing, and sew them up. Stick an onion full 
of cloves, put it into the pot, and add one quart of 
water, and one quart of red wine. Place skewers 
in the pot, about two inches from the bottom ; lay 
your beef on them ; cover the pot very tight, to pre- 
vent the steam from escaping. Let this stew gently 
four hours ; turn the meat two or three times while 
cooking ; turn a pint of red wine over the meat ; 
let it stew an hour longer ; thicken your gravy with 
a little flour and a little salt, skim off the fat, and 



HEATS. 29 

boil it up once. Turn a part over your meat when 
dished, and send the remainder of it to table in a 
sauce tureen. 

BOUILLI BEEF. 

Put a part of a brisket of beef, weighing six 
pounds, into a saucepan, and cold water enough to 
cover it. Let it boil until the scum rises, and skim 
it nicely; add two carrots, two turnips, and one 
onion, cut in dice form; stick an onion full of cloves. 
Let all this simmer three hours. Add one tumbler 
full of red wine, two tea-spoonsful of mixed mus- 
tard, and one table-spoonful of soy. Let it simmer 
one hour. When done, sprinkle over it some pickled 
cucumbers, cut very fine ; stir a little flour into your 
gravy, give it one boil, turn it into the dish with the 
meat, and send it to the table very hot. 

A BEEF FIE. 

Take cold roast beef or steak, cut it into thin 
slices, and put a layer into a pie dish; shake in a 
4 little flour, pepper, and salt ; cut up a tomato (if you 
have it), or onion chopped very fine ; then another 
layer of beef and seasoning, and so on until the dish 
is filled. If you have any beef gravy, put it in ; if 
not, a little beef drippings,, and water enough to 
make sufficient gravy. Have ready one dozen po- 
tatoes well boiled and mashed ; add half a cup of 
milk or cream, and a little butter and salt. Spread it 
over the pie as a crust, an inch thick ; brush it over 
with egg, and bake it about twenty-five minutes.

BEEF OLIVES, 

Take a slice of the round of beef about an inch 
thick, beat it with a rolling pin to the thickness of ' 
half an inch, and cut it into four inch squares. 
Have ready some dressing, made of beef, a little salt 
pork, one onion chopped very fine, one cup of bread 
crumbs, pepper, salt, cloves, and sweet marjoram. 
Mix all this up with an egg, put it into the pieces of 
steak,< and sew them up in the form of olives ; lay 
them in a tin pan with a cup of brown stock, 
sprinkle a little flour over them, and set them in the 
oven. When half done, baste them with a little 
butter. They require about twenty minutes' cook- 
ing. Dish your olives ; add to the gravy half a cup 
of boiling water, a small piece of butter, a little 
flour, and two tea-spoonsful of soy. Give this one 
boil, and turn it over the olives when ready to send 
to the table. 

TRIPE. 

The honey-comb part is the best. Cut it in square 
pieces of about six inches, wash it in salt and water, 
wipe it dry, dip it in eggs and crumbs or batter, and 
fry it in hot fat. Serve it with oyster sauce. After 
dishing the tripe, turn a quart of oyster sauce 
over it. 

CORNED BEEF. 

The navel end of the brisket is the best piece to 
boil. It should be put into cold water. Just before 
it boils take the scum off. A piece of beef weighing 



MEATS. 3} 

eight pounds requires five hours' boiling. Before 
sending to the table, the bone should be taken out, 
and the beef pressed half an hour. If done so, it 
looks much nicer and cuts better. 

EDGE BONE OP BEEF 

Weighing ten pounds, should be boiled three 
hours, as this piece should be a little rare. 

BRISKET OF BEEF STUFFED. 

A piece weighing eight pounds requires about five 
or six hours to* boil. Make a dressing of bread 
crumbs, pepper, salt, sweet herbs, a little mace, and 
one onion chopped fine and mixed with an egg. Put 
the dressing in between the fat and lean of the beef, 
and sew it up tight ; flour a cloth, pin the beef up 
very tight in it, boil it five or six hours. When it is 
done, take the cloth off, and press it until it is cold. 
This is to be cut in thin slices and eaten cold. 

SALTPETRED TONGUE 

Requires five or six hours to boil. When done, 
lay it into cold water three minutes; peal off the 
skin, beginning at the tip end of the tongue, as it 
comes off much easier. 

BOUILLI TONGUE. 

Take a fresh beef tongue, and boil it two hours. 
Lay it into cold water about five minutes, skin it,

and let it remain until the next day ; then dress it 
the same as bouilli beef. This makes a very nice 
dish. 

BOAST LEG OF MUTTON. 

A leg of mutton weighing ten pounds should be 
roasted two hours. When half done, turn the fat 
out of the roaster ; then what drips from the meat, 
you baste the meat with. Make the gravy the same 
as for roast beef, or add a few spoonsful of currant 
jelly and a cup of red wine. Ten minutes more 
should be allowed for every extra pound of mutton. 

BOAST SADDLE OF MUTTON. 

A saddle of mutton, weighing eight pounds, re- 
quires three quarters of an hour to cook; the gravy 
is made the same as for a leg of mutton. 

A SHOULDEB OF MUTTON BOASTED, 

Weighing six pounds, requires one hour to roast; 
if stuffed, half an hour longer. Before cooking it, 
take out the bone, and fill the space with a dressing 
of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, sweet marjoram, one 
egg, and a small piece of butter. 

A LEG OF MUTTON BOILED. 

A leg of mutton, weighing ten pounds, requires an 
hour and a half to boil. Flour a cloth, tie the meat 
in it very tight, and put it into boiling water; when 
done, put it into a pan and turn cold water over it 



MEATS. 33 

and let it remain two minutes before removing the 
cloth ; this makes the mutton look very white. 

A SHOULDER OF MUTTON BOILED 

Is cooked in the same way as a leg, except that it 
takes a half an hour less time to boil. 

haric6t mutton. 

Take a cold leg of boiled mutton, or a small one not 
boiled, and put it into a saucepan that covers close ; 
cut into dice-form two carrots, two turnips, and two 
onions ; put them around or under the mutton, add 
eight or ten cloves, pepper, salt and water enough to 
cover the mutton; simmer it four hours, and the 
water will waste away, leaving enough to make the 
gravy; after taking out the meat, skim off all the fat 
you can before making the gravy; about half an 
» hour before dishing, stir in a cup of white wine and 
two tea-spoonsful of soy ; dish the mutton ; stir a little 
flour into the gravy, give it one boil, and then turn 
the vegetables and gravy over the meat. 

MUTTON CHOPS, 

If broiled on* a gridiron, should be wrapped in 
paper ; they require about ten minutes to cook ; when 
they are taken out of the papers to be dished, season 
them with pepper, salt, and a little butter. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Lay the mutton chops into a pan, dredge a little 
flour over them, put them into the oven with the

door half open ; they require about fifteen minutes to 
cook ; have prepared a hot dish ; after you dish the 
chops, dredge a little flour into your gravy, with a 
few spoonsful of hot water, tomato catsup, pepper, 
and salt ; give it one boil, and turn it over the chops. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Beat up an egg, and season the chops with pepper 
and salt ; dip them in the egg, and then roll them in 
bread crumbs ; put them into a pan, and set them in 
the oven; cook them about fifteen minutes; after 
dishing the chops, add to your gravy a little butter, 
red wine, and currant jelly ; dredge in a little flour ; 
let it boil once, and turn it over the chops. 

A FILLET OF VEAL ROASTED. 

The bone should be taken out ; fill the cavity with 
a dressing made of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, and 
sweet marjoram, a piece of butter the size of an egg, 
or a little fat pork chopped very fine, and one egg; 
mix this up well ; skewer the veal tight to keep the 
dressing in. It adds to the look and taste of a fillet 
of veal to lard it with pork ; if thi* is not done, it 
should be basted often with butter. A piece weigh* 
ing eight pounds requires four hours to roast. 

A LOIN OF VEAL 

Is very nice, roasted plain ; it is, however, very 
palatable cooked the same as a fillet of veal, by 



taking out the kidneys, and putting dressing in their 
place. It requires three hours if roasted plain, and 
three and a half hours with dressing. 

A BREAST OF VEAL, ROASTED, 

Requires an hour and a half to roast ; a few strips 
of pork laid across it makes it much nicer. 

BOILED TEAL. 

A fillet or shoulder of veal is very nice boiled ; 
prepared the same as to roast. Boil three hours, and 
serve with celery or oyster sauce. 

TO RAGOUT A BREAST OF VEAL* 

Lay a breast of veal in a pan with a pint of water, 
a little salt, pepper and mace ; to stew an hour and 
a half, and turn it once or twice ; make some force- 
meat balls, with a little veal chopped fine, a few 
bread crumbs, sweet herbs, salt, pepper, a little 
butter, and one egg; mix it well together, and make 
it into small balls, and lay them on the meat ; baste 
it with butter, dredge on a little flour, set it into the 
oven to brown 'about twenty minutes, and dish the 
veal; add to the gravy a glass of white wine, a little 
butter, and a little flour ; give it one boil, and pour 
the gravy over the meat.

on gome flour, and baste it with the gravy. Set it 
into the oven again to brown. When done, dish the 
meat, stir into the gravy a little flour, a little soy or 
tomato catsup, give it one boil, and turn it over the 
meat. 

A VEAL PIE. 

A rack of veal cut into small pieces, parboil in 
water enough to fill your pie dish ; when 'about half 
cooked, take the veal out to cool, season the gravy 
with pepper, salt, a little mace, and a little salt pork; 
dredge in a little flour, line the sides of your dish 
with paste, lay in your meat and gravy, cover it 
with a thick paste, and cut a little hole in the top. 
Bake it half an hour. 

VEAL CUTLET. 

Fry half a dozen slices of salt pork a nice brown 
color ; take out the pork and keep it hot ; and add a 
few spoonsful of cook fat. A slice from the leg of 
veal makes the best cutlet. Wash and wipe the 
slices very dry ; have ready an egg beaten, and some 
bread crumbs ; dip the cutlet first into the egg, and 
then into the crumbs; lay them into the hot fat; fry 
about fifteen or twenty minutes, or until they are of 
a nice brown. Dish the cutlets. Make your gravy 



MEATS. 87 

by adding a little hot water and butter ; dredge in 
a little flour and soy, and give it one boil, stirring it 
all the time ; turn it over the cutlets, garnished with 
scraped horseradish and the salt pork. 

VEAL CROaUETES. 

Mince the veal very fine, and season it with a 
little pepper, salt and mace ; with the hands make 
it into balls the form of a pear, roll them in egg, and 
then in crumbs. Fry them in hot fat, and dish them 
on the large end ; place a stalk of parsley in the 
small end; garnish with parsley. 

MINCE VEAL. 

Take cold roast or boiled veal, and chop it very 
fine; season it with pepper and salt. If you have 
any cold gravy, put it with it ; if not, butter will 
answer. Heat it very hot, stirring it often that the 
gravy may not oil ; serve it on slices of toasted 
bread, and garnish with lemon. 

A CALF'S HEAD. 

Soak a calf's head in cold water two hours, take 
out the brains, scrape the head very clean, flour a 
cloth, pin up the head very tight, and put it into six 
or eight quarts of water to boil with two pounds of 
salt pork. Tie up the brains in a piece of cloth 
separately. Let the head boil about two hours, then 
add the liver, lights and brains, and let it all boil 
two hours more. Remove the cloth, and the large 



38 RECEIPTS. 

bones will come out very easily from the head; lay 
it on a dish with the skin side up; this is to be kept 
hot while making the gravy; then take a quart of 
the liquor that the head was boiled in, one third of 
the liver chopped very fine, the brains braided up 
with a spoon, a quarter of a pound of butter, two 
table-spoonsful of flour, pepper, salt, and sweet mar- 
joram. Put this together into a saucepan and let it 
boil ; then add two table-spoonsful of vinegar ; di- 
vide the liver and head, skin the tongue, and lay it 
on around the head on the dish ; put a part of the 
gravy over the head, and send the remainder to 
table in a gravy dish. Garnish your dish with 
scraped horseradish and lemon sliced. 

TO STEW A CALF'S HEAD. 

Boil the head, so that the large bones can be taken 
out with ease, but not enough for eating ; put some 
butter into a. stewpan or baking kettle ; when the 
butter is melted, put the jelly part of the head down 
with it, so as to brown it handsomely. Move it a 
little while cooking, lest it should stick to the bot- 
tom. Then turn over the head, dredge flour around 
the kettle enough to thicken the gravy, and let it 
brown a little; take about a quart of the liquor in 
which the head was boiled, and pour it on the head 
in the kettle ; put in half a tumbler of wine, red and 
white mixed together, a little sweet marjoram, some 
grated nutmeg, a little mace, a clove or two pounded, 



HEATS. 39 

a little cayenne, and a little black pepper and salt to 
your taste. With all these gondiments season the 
gravy; then slice some of the liver and tongue 
which has been previously parboiled; stew all an 
hour or more, watching it constantly lest it stew too 
much. Garnish with egg balls, force-meat balls, 
and sliced lemon. The brains should be taken out 
and boiled separately from the head, and added just 
before serving it all up. 

CALF'S FEET. 

Boil about three hours in four quarts of water ; 
then take out the large bones, split the feet, and lay 
them into a saucepan ; shake in a little flour, two 
ounces of butter, a little pepper, salt, mace, half a 
teacup of white wine, a tab|e-spoonful of vinegar, 
and two teacups of the liquor in which the feet were 
boiled. Simmer this all together about ten minutes, 
and send it to the table very hot, garpished with 
sliced lemon. 

The remainder of the liquor in which the feet 
were boiled may be used for jelly, as directed for 
calf s foot jelly. 

BAKED CALF'S LIVER. 

Lard it with fat pork, and put it into an iron pan 
with a pint of water or veal stock. Bake it three 
quarters of an hour, basting it frequently. Have 
prepared some maccaroni, well boiled in milk and 
water. Dish the liver, lay around the maccaroni, 



40 RECEIPTS. 

add to the gravy a piece of butter the size of an 
egg, a little flour, pepper, salt and soy. Boil it up 
once, and turn it over the dish. 

SWEET BREADS. 

Lard them with salt pork, and boil them in clear 
water about fifteen minutes; put them into cold 
water about ten minutes, and put them into a pan. 
Dredge in a little flour, about half a pint of hot 
water, very little mace, pepper, and salt; set them 
into the oven to brown about twenty minutes. Dish 
the sweet breads, add to the gravy a piece of butter 
about the size of an egg, and a little flour ; give it 
one boil, and turn it over the sweet breads hot Gar- 
nish the dish with sliced lemon and parsley. 

VEAL OLIVES. 

Yeal olives are made in the same manner as beef 
olives. 

ROAST LAMB. 

The fore quarter is much the best piece to roast. 
It should be roasted about one hour and a half, and 
frequently basted. To make the gravy, take all the 
dripping from the tin roaster, add a very little water, 
a little salt and flour, and give it one boil. 

MINT SAUCE, 

To serve with roast lamb. Take a bunch of green 
mint, and chop it very fine with a knife ; add a tea-

gar. Stir this up, and send it to the table in a sauce- 
boat. 

A BOILED LEG OF LAMB. 

A common sized one should be boiled about an hour 
and a half; drawn butter and parsley to be served 
with it. 

LAMB CUTLETS AND CHOPS. 

Dressed in the same manner as mutton chops. 
(See page 33.) 

ROAST VENISON. 

A leg of venison weighing fourteen pounds should 
be roasted one hour if eaten on blazers ; if on hot 
plates, two hours. The dry skin should be taken off 
with the fingers, not with a knife. The spit should 
be turned very often. When half done, it should be 
basted with flour, butter, and red wine very fre- 
quently, until done. To make the gravy, take the 
shank of the venison, crack the bone, a pound of 
juicy beef, an onion stuck full of cloves, a little 
pepper and salt. Put it into a saucepan with two 
quarts of water, and boil it gently three hours. Strain 
this, and add to it the drippings from the venison, 
with nearly a quarter of a pound of butter ; braid in 
two table-spoonsful of flour, a teacup of red wine, 
and a teacup of currant jelly. Stir it all up, and let 
it boil about five minutes.

A SADDLE OF VENISON. 

A saddle of venison is much the best piece of the 
deer. It requires but half the time to roast this as it 
does the leg, for it is a much thinner piece. Dressed 
in the same manner as the leg. 

A VENISON STEAK. 

Cut steaks from the leg half an inch thick, broil 
them about five minutes; season with pepper, salt, 
and butter. If you have it, a cup of the roast veni- 
son gravy very hot is very nice poured over it; or 
half a cup of red wine, and half a cup of currant 
jelly, thickened with a little flour and butter, boiled 
up and turned over the steak. It should be served 
very hot. 

VENISON PIE. 

Take the breast and neck of venison, and cut it 
into small pieces. Season with pepper, salt, and a 
little ground cloves, and dredge it well with flour ; 
put it into the pie dish as close as possible, fill up the 
dish with some of the roast venison gravy, or gravy 
prepared in the same manner, and cover the dish 
with a nice crust Bake it half an hour. 

ROAST PIG. 

Make a dressing of bread crumbs, a little salt, 
pepper, sage, sweet marjoram, an onion chopped 
fine, butter, two eggs, and a little salt pork, and fry 
this a little ; when cold, stuff the pig, sew it up, and 
then wash it in salt and water ; baste it often. A 



MEATS. 43 

pig weighing nine pounds requires four hours to 
roast it. 

A SPARE RIB OR CHINE OF PORK 

Is much nicer if rubbed over, before it is roasted, 
with a little pepper, salt, and fine sage. Take all 
the fat out of the roaster when about half done, and 
then with the dripping make the gravy. 

FRIED PORK STEAKS. 

Fry a few slices of salt pork, take them out of the 
frying pan, dredge a little flour over the steaks, and 
a little pepper and salt; fry them fifteen or twenty 
minutes slowly. Slices of apple fried in the fat are 
very nice to eat with* the pork. 

FRIED PIGS' FEET. 

Make a batter with a little flour, water, a little 
salt, and one egg. Dip the feet in to cover them. 
Have your fat hot, and fry them until quite brown. 
Make a little drawn butter, and add a spoonful of 
vinegar to serve with them. 

PIGS* HEAD CHEESE. 

Boil a pig's head until the bone comes out, and 
chop this very fine ; pound about eight soft crackers 
very fine, and mix this up well; add some sweet 
herbs, pepper, salt and spices. Put this into a mould, 
and press it for two or three days. It is very nice 
cut into thin slices, and eaten cold.

ROAST HAM. 

Spit a ham ; set it before a moderate fire to roast 
about two hours, turning the spit frequently; then 
take it up on to a dish, peal off the rind, scrape 
all the fat out of the roaster, put it to the fire 
to roast again about two hours more ; basting it 
frequently in the same way as for beef. To make 
the gravy, put the dripping from the roaster into a 
saucepan, add a cup of water, a little flour, and give 
it one boil. Served in a sauce tureen. 

A roasted ham is far superior to a boiled one. - 

BOILED HAM. 

A ham should be put into cold water enough to 
more than cover it, and boiletf gently. A ham weigh- 
ing fifteen pounds requires five hours' boiling. When 
about half done, and a part of the water has boiled 
away, add, if approved, a bottle of champagne, or a 
pint of good white wine vinegar; cover the pot close, 
to keep the flavor of the wine. 

An old ham should be laid in cold water over night. 



POULTRY. 



ROAST TURKEY. 



A turkey should be well singed and cleaned of pin- 
feathers ; then draw the inwards. Be sure you take 
every thing out that is inside. Lay the turkey into 



POULTRY. 45 

cold water, clean the gizzards, liver, heart and neck ; 
let all soak one hour if you have time. Wash all very- 
clean, wipe the turkey very dry, inside and out. 
Make a dressing of two cups of bread crumbs, one 
tea-spoonful of salt, two large spoonsful of sweet 
marjoram, two spoonsful of butter, one egg, and mix 
them Well together. Cut the skin of the turkey 'in 
the back part of the neck, that the breast may look 
plump ; fill the breast with the force meat, and sew 
it up. If you have any more force-meat than is 
required for the breast, put the remainder into the 
body, and skewer the vent ; tie the legs down very 
tight, skewer the wings down to the sides, and turn 
the neck on to the back with a strong skewer. Baste 
with salt and water once, then frequently with butter; 
fifteen minutes before dishing, dredge with a little 
salt and flour, and baste with butter for the last time. 
This will give a fine frothy appearance, and add to 
the flavor of the turkey. 

To make the gravy, put the gizzard, neck, and 
liver into a saucepan with a quart of water, a 
little pepper, salt and mace ; put it on the fire, 
and let it boil to about a half pfnt. When done, 
braid up the liver very fine with a knife, put it back 
into the water it has boiled in ; then add the drip- 
pings of the turkey and a little flour, and give it one 
boil, stirring it all the time. Dish the gizzard with 
the turkey. Allow twelve minutes to a pound for 
the time to roast a turkey. 

A turkey weighing ten pounds requires two hours

to roast with a clear fire, not too hot. Turn the spit 
very often. 

BOILED TURKET 

Is dressed the same as for roasting, except in the 
dressing. Put in the pork chopped very fine, instead 
of butter. In trussing, turn the wings on the back! 
instead of the sides, as for roasting ; flour a cloth 
well, pin up the turkey tight, put it into boiling 
water where one or two pounds of salt pork have 
been boiling some time; let this boil with the turkey 
Dish the pork with the turkey on a separate dish 
with some parsley. Serve with oyster sauce. 

A turkey weighing eight pounds requires an hour 
and a half to boil. 

ROAST CHICKENS. 

Dress and roast the same as a turkey. A pair of 
chickens weighing six pounds requires an hour and 
a half to roast. Make the gravy the same as for a 
turkey, except the mace, which is to be omitted. 

BOILED CHICKENS. 

Dressed and boiled the same as a turkey. Some 
cooks do not stuff boiled chickens or turkeys ; but 
the dressing adds as much to the boiled as to the 
roast. Pork boiled with chickens is very necessary. 
A pair of chickens requires from one to two hours to 
boil, depending upon the size and age.

to bone; and cook: a boned turkey. 

Clean the turkey well, lay it on the table, have a 
small sharp-pointed knife; begin at the wing, pass 
the knife close to the bone, cut the flesh from the 
bone, and keep the skin as whole as possible ; then 
pass the knife on each side of the breast, and then 
around the legs ; split the back about half way up, 
and draw out the bones. Have ready a stuffing 
made of the meat of a chicken chopped very fine, 
bread crumbs, pepper, salt, mace, sweet marjoram, a 
piece of butter, and two eggs, all well mixed up. 
Pill the turkey and sew it up, preserving the form. 
Have two calves' feet cracked up well, and the bones 
that have been taken out of the turkey put into a 
deep saucepan with one onion and one carrot cut 
very fine, mace, pepper, salt, and a few cloves. Lay 
the turkey on the bones, and add two quarts of 
water ; cover it tight, and let it simmer three hours, 
then take out the turkey, flour it and baste it well 
with butter, and set it in the oven to brown. If there 
is not one quart of gravy, add more water, and let it 
boil half an hour. Beat up the whites and shells of 
two eggs, and stir into the gravy, and let it boil 
fifteen minutes ; strain it through a cloth into a jelly 
mould. When the turkey is cold and the jelly is 
hard, dish the turkey with the jelly on the breast. 

This is considered a very nice supper dish.

of hot water (or veal stock) enough to fill the dish. 
Make a good paste crust, line the sides of the dish 
and rim, put in the chicken, cover it over with the 
crust, cut a hole in the top, and bake it half an hour. 
If the chickens are not very young, they should be 
boiled, half an hour after they are cut up, with some 
strips of pork. 

EAST INDIAN CURRY. 

Skin a chicken, cut it in small pieces, take two 
table-spoonsful of flour, and one of curry powder ; 
stir them together dry, dip the chicken into it, and 
fry it a fine light brown. It may be fried in pork 
or butter; put it into a pot and pour over it boiling 
water enough to cover it; let it boil slowly until 
tender. Mix the remainder of the flour, and curry 
with a little water, and put into the pot, and boil it 
a few minutes more ; salt to the taste.

large spoonful of curry, stir it in well, and turn it 
over the chicken. 

CURRY CHICKEN. 

Cut the chicken into good shaped pieces, put it into 
a saucepan with a few little pieces of salt pork, an 
onion, and a little salt. Put in cold water enough to 
cover it; let it simmer over the fire until the chick-

the same as turkey. Make a dressing of six or eight 
potatoes well boiled and mashed, two onions chopped 
very fine, two tea-spoonsful of sage, one of salt, and 
one of pepper. Put it into the body of the goose, 
and sew it up. Roast it two hours; baste it in its

A MOUNTAIN GOOSE. 

Cleanse it the same as the turkey. Make a dress- 
ing of bread crumbs, one onion chopped very fine, 
two spoonsful of sage, pepper, salt, and a little pork 
chopped fine, and one egg. To. roast a large goose, 
requires two hours' cooking. The gravy is made the 
same as for common goose. 

a Mongrel goose 
Is dressed the same as the common goose, but as 
the mongrel has so much flavor, the dressing is 
unnecessary. Without dressing, an hour and a half 
will roast a large sized goose. 

WILD GOOSE. 

A wild goose should be roasted rare ; one hour's 
roasting is sufficient. Add a glass of Ted wine, and 
half a cup of currant jelly to the gtavy, which is 
made the same as for the common goose. Boil it to- 
gether, and send it to the table in a sauce tureen. 

ROAST DUCKS

ducks half an hour, and canvass back twenty-five 
minutes. The gravy made the same as for goose. 

Wild ducks should be roasted after the soup is 
sent to the table.

PREPARING AND COOKING SMALL BIRDS. 

Some cooks do not take out the entrails of small 
birds ; but the flavor is much nicer to draw all out, 
excepting the heart and liver. This may be done by 
making a small opening in the vent, and drawing 
very carefully. Wild birds should not lay in cold 
water to soak, but should be washed quickly and 
wiped dry. . 

ROAST PARTRIDGES. 

Lard them well with fat pork ; tie the legs down 
to the rump, leaving the feet on; while cooking, 
baste them well with butter. They require twenty- 
five or thirty minutes to cook. To make the gravy, 
put the drippings into a saucepan with* a piece of 
butter about the size of an egg, and a little flour and 
hot Water. Let it boil up once. 

For the bread sauce, see page 58. 

TO BOIL PARTRIDGES. 

Cut off the feet, and tie down the legs very closely ; 
boil them with a piece of pork twenty minutes. Serve 
them with parsley and butter, or bread sauce.

tridges are put into the pot. 

TO BROIL PARTRIDGES. 

Split them through the back, broil them fifteen 
minutes; dish them with pepper, salt, and a little 
butter. A piece of salt pork broiled to eat with them 
is a very great improvement.

the bodies, sew them up, and truss them very 
tightly. Roast them half an hour, baste them with 
butter, and a strip of salt pork pinned on to the 
breast with a small needle. For the gravy, take

lay five or six slices of salt pork in the bottom of the 
pot ; chop an onion very fine, and fry it in the fat to 
a nice brown ; then put the pigeons into the pot quite 
close, with a little pepper and salt, and shake in a 
little flour; turn in hot water, or brown stock enough 
to quite cover over the pigeons, and stew them gently 
one hour ; if the water boils away, add a little more.

Boil one dozen good potatoes, and mash them 
well. Add a piece of butter, a little salt, and half a 
cup of cream .or milk. Stir it well with a large

spoonsful of flour into half a | pound of butter ; stir 
this into the boiling liquor, and let it again boil up ; 
then put in the oysters and give it one boil. Serve it 
in an oyster dish. 

CELERY SAUCE. 

Take two or three heads of celery, cut it up fine, 
put it into a saucepan with about three pints of cold 
water, a little salt, and a few peppercorns. Boil it 
two hours. Braid into a quarter of a pound of but-

Take half a pint of milk and cream together, two 
eggs well beaten, salt, and a little pepper, and the 
juice of half a lemon. Put it over the fire,, and stir 
it constantly until it begins to thicken, Serve it the 
same as drawn butter. 

LOBSTER SAUCE.

body, cut it up very fine, and put it into a saucepan 
with a pint and a half of white stock. Braid into 
a quarter of a pound of butter a large spoonful of 
flour, stir it in, and add a little salt, pepper, and vin-

APPLE SAUCE. 

Peal, quarter, and core the apples, and throw 
them into cold water, rince them out, put them into 
a preserving kettle with a very little water, and 



60 RECEIPTS. 

cover them up tightly. Stew them until nearly done, 
then sprinkle in sugar enough to sweeten them to 
your taste. Cover it up tight again, and simmer 
them until done. Turn the kettle bottom upwards 
so as not to stir the apples and break them, as the 
sauce looks much better with the apples whole as 
possible., 

The time of cooking apple sauce depends upon 
the kind of apples used. Greenings cook much 
quicker than other kinds, and are the best kind* 
for cooking. 

ANOTHER APPLE SAUCE. 

Put a pint of water, and a quarter of a pound of 
sugar into a saucepan; let it boil about ten minutes; 
put in as many apples pealed, cored and quartered 
as the syrup will cover when it boils up. Simmer 
until quite tender. The apples will be transparent, 
and if taken up carefully look very handsome. 

Apple sauce made in this way does not require 
any more sugar than when made in the common 
way ; it requires a little more care, and looks much 
handsomer. 

ANOTHER APPLE SAUCE. 

Put the apples into an earthen crock, with a hand- 
ful of sugar, a pint of cider and water, and cover it 
with a brown crust. Bake it in the oven three or 
four hours. If baked in a brick oven, let it remain 
all night.

PRIED POTATOES. 

Cut cold potatoes into slices, dredge on a little 
flour, pepper and salt, put them into the pan where 
sausages have been fried if you use potatoes that 
have not been cooked, cut them into thin slices, and 
pour boiling water over them ; let them stand while 
you fry a few slices of salt pork, wipe them dry, 
and fry as many at a time as will cover the bottom 
' of the pan. 

All kinds of vegetables should be put into boiling 
water to cook. Every kind of vegetable, excepting 
green peas, should lay in cold water some time before 
cooking them.

TO BOIL PEAS. 

Peas should be well picked over, but hot washed, 
as in washing them that little sweet stem that con- 
nects the pea to the pod is lost; put them into boiling 
water, and boil them thirty minutes; then drain 
them through a cullender, put them into a tin dish 
with a little butter and salt; stir them and keep them 
hot while dishing the meat. As peas grow older, 
they should be boiled longer; and when they are 
quite old, put a little saleratus into the Water in 
which they are to be boiled. 

TO DRESS^EAS ANOTHER WAT. 

Put them into a saucepan, place it into another 
vessel of boiling water; put in a small piece of butter, 
salt, pepper, parsley, the heart of lettuce, and a little 
summer savory. About twenty minutes before dish- 
ing, add another piece of butter, and dredge in some 
flour and stir it. For sauce, take one egg, juice of a 
lemon, a very little salt, pepper, and a little milk ; 
stir it constantly until it thickens. After the peas 
are dished, pour the sauce over them. 

BEANS 

Require one hour to boil. They are dressed the 
same as peas. 

squashes. 

They should boil one hour. Mash them with a 
potato masher, with a little butter and salt. Summer 
squash must be squeezed in a cloth instead of mashed.

flour into a piece of butter, and stir it in the mush- 
rooms; add a little pepper and salt, give it one boil, 
and serve it in an oyster dish.

very fine; add pepper, salt, and a little piece of 
butter ; put it into a saucepan, and simmer it ten 
minutes ; toast some bread and butter it, and dish 
the spinage on the toast.

TO MAKE COFFEE. 

The coffee should be dried in the oven with the 
door open one or two hours before roasting. When 
it is ready to roast, set it on the fire in an iron pan, 
and stir it constantly until it becomes a light brown. 
To two pounds of coffee add a bit of butter about 
the size of a walnut three minutes before taking it 
from the fire. Coffee is much better, when it is 
roasted, ground, and made within one hour. One 
cup of ground coffee will make one quart of coffee. 
To make coffee in a biggin, put the ground coffee 
into the filter, wet it with cold water, and let it stand 
five minutes to swell. Put the filter into the pot 
where it belongs ; fill it up with boiling water and 
set it where it will keep hot, but not boil. When 
this has run through, add water until you have 
made a quart of coffee. It does not require more 
than ten minutes to make good coffee. 

To boil coffee, put into a coffee-pot one cup of 
ground coffee, and stir in one egg, or a piece of salt- 
fish skin two inches square ; add pne quart of water. 
Boil it ten minutes, take it off, turn a cupful out at 
the spout, and back again into the pot Let it stand 
ten minutes. Turn it off into another pot to send to

RICH PUFF PASTE. 

Tb one pound of. flour, allow one pound of butter. 
Wash the butter in cold water, divide it into three 
parts, make it into thin cakes, and lay them on the ice 
to harden. Sift the flour, take one cake of the butter 
and rub it well into the flour, mix it up lightly with 
the hands with cold ice water, sprinkle a little flour 



. 'PASTRY. 73 

on the paste board, an&roll the crust out very thin, 
rolling from you always. Be careful not to break 
the crust with the rolling pin. Roll out one cake 
of butter as thin as possible, lay it on the paste, 
dredge on a little flour, roll up the paste, then roll it 
out thin again ; roll out the other cake of butter, lay 
it on the paste, dredge on a little more flour, and 
roll it up again. Gut it into as many pieces as re- 
quired. For edging, roll out a piece as long as will 
go around the plate without piecing, as it looks much 
better. The edging should be three or four layers of 
paste rolled very thin, and put on the rim of the 
plate. Use sifted flour to dredge on the paste board, 
and to roll the butter and paste together. This 
flour is included in the weight of the flour for the 
paste. 

COMMON PASTE. 

Take one pound of flour, and three quarters of a 
pound of butter ; sift the flour on the paste board ; 
take two thirds of the butter, cut it with a knife into 
the flour, mix it up with just ice water enough to 
stick the flour and butter together, and roll it out 
about an inch thick ; put the rest of the butter on 
the paste, dredge on some flour, roll up the paste, 
flour the board and roll out the paste again smooth, 
and then roll it up again. 

This is a very good paste to line the plates with, 
and use the puff paste for the edging and upper 
crust.

A VERY GOOD COMMON PASTE, 

To a pound of flour, take half a pound of butter 
and a quarter of a pound of lard, (this is best in 
winter,) or half butter and half lard, allowing a 
pound of flour to three quarters of a pound of short- 
ening. Mix the lard and a little salt with the flour 
very lightly and quickly with ice water, flour the 
board, roll out the paste about a quarter of an inch 
thick ; put half the butter on with a knife in little 
bits, dredge on a plenty of flour, roll up the paste, 
then roll it out again, put the other half of the but- 
ter on the same as before, and again roll it up. This 
is a very nice crust for meat pie. 

APPLE PIE. 

In the fall of the year, when apples are very juicy, 
they make nice pies without stewing. Cut them 
thin, line a deep plate with crust, put in a layer of 
apple, some good brown sugar, a little mace or cin- 
namon, grated lemon peel, and a very small piece of 
butter ; then another layer of apples and seasoning,

of water. Let this boil up. Then lay in the apples 
carefully, and let them simmer until they are tender 
and clear; take them out on a dish 'with a spoon, 
keeping them as whole as possible; let the liquor 
boil away until there is only enough juice left for 
the pies, line the plates with crust, and lay in the 
apples carefully. Add a glass of wine to the juice, 
put a double edge of puff paste around the rim of 
the plate, turn in the juice, and brush over the 
paste and the apple with the white of an egg, and

the top add to the appearance of tarts. Bake them 
until the crust is done. 

GOOSEBERRY PIES OR TARTS. 

* 

Pick off all the stalks and little blossoms, and 
make the pies the same as the rhubarb. For the 
tarts, the gooseberries should be strained through a 
coarse sieve. The seasoning should be put in while 
the fruit is hot, but the fruit should be perfectly cold 
when put on the paste. 

MINCE PIE. 

Boil a beef tongue weighing six pounds, and what 
is called the vein of a round of beef weighing six 
pounds, six hours; then skin the tongue, and chop 
the beef and tongue very fine; add five pounds of 
beef suet chopped very fine, five pounds of stoned 
raisins, three pounds of dried currants, a pound and 
a half of citron in small thin pieces, four pounds of 
brown sugar, one pint of good molasses, one quart 
of brandy, one quart of white wine, half a cup each 
of salt, cinnamon, allspice and cloves, three nut- 
megs, and a table-spoonful of mace. Put this all 
into a large pan, mix it well together with the hands, 
and let it stand over night. What you wish to bake 
take into another pan, and add one half as much 
fine-chopped apples as you have meat. Mix it up 



PASTRY. 77 

well, and \et it stand an hour. If it is not quite 
sweet enough, add as much sugar as required, and 
a little more wine. Put the remainder of the meat 
into a jar for future use, and turn on a little brandy. 
Cover it tight to keep the air from it. This not only 
keeps well, but is better than when it is first made. 
When more is required for use, the proportion of 
chopped apples, &c. to be added, as named above, 
with wine to moisten the meat. Champagne wine 
may be used if preferred. 

PEACH PIE.

the same size, cut a hole with a small wine-glass, 
making a rim half an inch thick, and bake them 
until quite done. Just before sending them to the 
table, fill them with preserves of any kind. 

Paste looks much nicer if beat-up egg is brushed 
over it with a paste brush, and white sugar sifted on 
just before it is set into the oven. If it is to be very 
light colored, use only the white of the egg, and 
omit the sugar. 

LEMON PIE. 

Grate the rind off two lemons, peal off the white 
skin, chop the lemon up fine, add two cups of sugar, 
beat up two eggs, and stir it all together. Roll out

water. Fill the dish quite full, set it into a pan with 
a little water, and bake it one hour. Serve it with 
cold or wine sauce.

case it should be made rather sweeter, or the apples 
should be scalded in alittle sugar and water before 
it is baked. 

BAKED APPLE PUDDING.

arrowroot into it; then add two quarts of cold milk, 
the sugar, and flavoring. 

LEMON FLAVOR FOR ICES. 

Rub some lumps of sugar over the outside of three 
good lemons, until you extract the essence. Squeeze 
the juice, strain it, and add as much sugar as the v 
juice will absorb. This will flavor one gallon of 
cream. 

PINEAPPLE FLAVOR. 

Take a common sized pineapple, cut it in slices, 
sprinkle some sugar over it, cover it up, and let it 
stand over night ; strain it, and add more sugar if 
necessary, for one gallon of cream. 

PEACH WATER FLAVOR. 

Take three table-spoonsful of the water to one 
gallon of cream. 

RASPBERRY FLAVOR. 

Add sugar to the raspberries, mash them, and 
strain the juice. A quart of raspberries will flavor 
a gallon of cream.

STRAWBERRY FLAVOR.

VANILLA FLAVOR. 

Simmer one bean in half a pint of milk until the 
flavor is extracted, say two or three hours. 

WATER ICES. 

Take a gallon of ice water, sweeten it very sweet, 
and flavor it with any flavor that is agreeable to the 
taste. Freeze it the same as ice cream. 

ROMAN PUNCH. 

Make the punch with wine and brandy, sugar and 
lemon flavor, as for ice cream. It should be very 
strongly flavored, as in freezing it diminishes one 
half. 

DIRECTIONS FOR FREEZING ICE CREAMS, WATER 

ICES, &c. 

Break the ice in small pieces, say about the size 
of an egg, or smaller, and put some in the bottom of 
a tub; set the kettle in; then put in about a quart 
of coarse rock salt ; then two quarts of ice ; and so 
on until the tub is filled up to the top of the kettle. % 
Stir it until the cream is frozen. In the old-fashioned 
freezer you must take off the cover frequently, and 
scrape off the cream from the sides until it freezes 
evenly. 

If it is to be put into moulds, fill them quite full, 
shut them very tight, and put them in the ice and 
salt, covering them entirely; then throw over a piece 



CAKE. 107 

of carpet to keep the air out. To take them out 
of the mould, have your dish ready, wipe the mould, 
and. then turn over it some boiling water, wiping it 
again very quickly ; then turn it on the dish. Re- 
move the mould very slowly, for fear of breaking. 
When pure essences can be procured, they are quite 
equal to fresh fruits to flavor with.

be obtained at Messrs. Smith & Melvin's, at 325 
Washington street, Boston, who manufacture the 
above-named articles expressly for retailing, and

QUINCES. 

The orange quince is the best to preserve. Peal 
and core the quinces, weigh a pound of crushed 
sugar to a pound of quinces, put the peals and cores 
into a kettle with just water enough to cover them. 
Let this simmer about two hours, then strain the 
liquor, put it back into the kettle, and put in as 
many quinces as the liquor will cover, boil them 
until they are tender, take them out and put them on 
a flat dish to cool ; put in more until all are boiled, 
then put the sugar in, and let it boil until it becomes 
a syrup ; then put in as many quinces as the syrup 
will cover, let them boil about thirty minutes, put 
them on a flat dish to cool, and then more until they 
are all boiled; then boil the syrup until all the water 
is boiled out of it. When the quinces are cool, put 
them into the jars, and strain the syrup while it is 
hot through a very fine sieve on to the quinces. 

QUINCE JELLY. 

Prepare the quinces ^to boil as above directed, cut 
them into small pieces, boil them one hour, strain 
the liquor through a fine sieve ; measure a pint of 
liquor to a pound of sugar, boil it about twenty-five 
minutes, and strain it into the moulds. 



118 RECEIPTS. 

QUINCE MARMALADE. 

Take the quinces that you have boiled for jelly, 
mash them with a spoon. To a pound of quinces 
take a pound of sugar, boil them together until they 
are well softened, then strain through a coarse sieve 
and put it up in small jars. 

PEACHES. 

Weigh to a pound of peaches a pound of sugar, 
put the peaches into a preserving kettle, and turn on 
boiling water enough to just cover them, and let 
them boil ten minutes. Take them out carefully on 
a flat dish to cool, then peel them with your fingers, 
to keep the shape ; take a little of the water that 
they were boiled in, add the sugar, and let it boil 
until it becomes a syrup. Put in a few peaches at a 
time, so as not to crowd them ; when they are done 
put them on a dish to cool. Lay them carefully into 
a jar, boil the syrup a few minutes after the peaches 
are done, and strain it hot over the peaches. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Peel the peaches, weigh a pound of sugar to a 
pound of peaches, strew half the sugar on to the 
peaches, and let them stand over night. Next day 
turn off the syrup and add the rest of the sugar ;

strain the syrup hot through a fine sieve into the 
brandy, and then put it on the peaches. 

PLUMS. 

Grreen Gages. — Take a pound of sugar to a pound 
of plums ; make a syrup of the sugar with a little 
water, just enough to keep the sugar from burning ;

are tender, and take them out on a dish to cool. 
When all are done, put them into jars, then boil 
the syrup about ten minutes, and strain it on the 
plums. Let them stand three or four days ; if the 
syrup then appears watery on -the top, boil them 
over again about twenty minutes.

sieve into the jar while it is hot Let them stand 
two or three days ; then do them up in the same 
manner as currant jelly. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

The currants should be ripe, and fresh picked. 
Put them into a preserving kettle with a very little 
water, say about a cupful; to prevent them from 
burning. Let them stew gently until the currants 
turn white, then strain them through a sieve ; they 
will not require much squeezing. Take a pint of 
juice to a pound of sugar, put them into the kettle, 
and boil it thirty minutes. Take a spoonful out on 
a plate, and set the plate on ice ; if it is done, it will 
stiffen in five minutes. Then strain it through a 
very fine sieve into small glass jars. Set them in 
the sun two days. Put a piece of paper wet in 
brandy on the top, and over this a bladder, and tie 
them up.

Peel the pineapple, and cut it in slices about a 
quarter of an inch thick ; take a pound of sugar to 
a pound of fruit ; sprinkle the sugar over the apple, 
and let it stand until the next day. Then put it into 
the kettle, and boil it until the apple looks clear. 
Take out the apple to cool. Give the syrup one boil, 
and then strain it through a hair sieve on the fruit.

PINEAPPLE JAM. 

Peel the apple and weigh it, a pound to a pound 
of sugar ; grate the apple on a coarse grater, put the 
apple and sugar in the kettle together, and let it boil 
thirty or forty minutes. 

STRAWBERRIES. 

Weigh one pound of sugar to a pound of fruit ; 
put the sugar into the kettle with just water enough 
to prevent its burning, boil to a syrup ; then put in 
as many strawberries at a time as will cover the top 
of the syrup without crowding them, and let them 
boil twenty minutes. Take them out carefully, so 
as not to break them, and put them in a dish to cool 
separately. When cold, put them into glass jars, and 
strain the hot syrup through a hair sieve on to them. 

The Hovey Seedlings are the best to preserve in 
this manner, as they are very large. If however 
they get broken, it would be better to put them back 
into the kettle and boil them thirty minutes for jam. 

ANOTHER WAY TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES. 

Weigh a pound of fine loaf sugar to a pound of 
fruit, sprinkle the sugar over the fruit, and let it 
stand over night. The next day strain off the syrup 
and boil it about ten minutes ; then put in the fruit, 
and let it boil gently twenty minutes more. Skim 
out the fruit on a flat dish to cool. When cool, put 
them in jars, add the syrup, and tie them up tight, 
with paper dipped in brandy, and a bladder over it.

CODDLED APPLES. 

Peel the apples, leaving the stems on, and put as 
many as will stand into the preserving kettle or 
saucepan ; put in a little water, and let them boil 
until they are tender. Take them out carefully. 
Allow a cup of sugar to three apples, put it into the 
water that they were boiled in, and boil it ten min- 
utes. Peal a lemon very thin in very narrow strips, 
lay them around the stem of the apple, put them 
into the syrup, and boil them until they are clear. 
Put them into the dish in which you send them to 
the table, and pour the syrup on them. These will 
not keep more than three or four days. 

PEARS. 

Peel the pears, boil them in water until they 
are quite tender, and then take them out on a dish 
to cool. Make a syrup of white sugar. A few 
pieces of ginger and a slice of lemon make a nice 
flavor to the syrup. Put in the pears, and boil them 
gently until they are quite clear ; the time depends 
oti the size ; if they are small, they require about 
thirty minutes. If to keep all winter, allow a pound 
of sugar to a pound of fruit. 

STEWED PEARS. 

Take large honeyed pears, and peel, core and 
quarter them. Take two quarts of the pears, a pint

twenty-four hours. Turn them into a basket to 
drain. Boil as much of the best cider vinegar as 
will cover the cucumbers, wash out the jars, put the 
cucumbers into them, turn on the vinegar boiling 
hot, cover them with cabbage leaves, and cover the % 
jars tight. In forty-eight hours they will be fit for 
use.

way. 

MANGOES. 

Cut out a small strip at the side and take out the

130 RECEIPTS. 

mustard seed, cloves and peppercorns. Replace the 
piece taken out, tie them up tight, prepare them the 
same as cucumbers, only they should remain in the 
salt and water forty-eight hours instead of twenty- 
four. 



USEFUL HINTS. 

Pieces of stale bread should be kept clean and dry. 
Every two or three days put all the small pieces you 
have on a tin sheet, and set it in the oven with the 
door open to dry. When very dry, pound them fine, 
and sift them through a coarse sieve or fine cullender. 
The fine crumbs are good to use in frying ; the 
coarse ones are good for puddings. The soft part 
of pieces of bread should be used for dressing for 
meats, which would save cutting a whole loaf for 
that purpose. If care is taken of the pieces of bread 
in a family, a great saving may be made, for bread 
is a large item in family expenses. Soft crackers 
pounded make the best crumbs to use in frying, also 
in scalloping oysters. 

The drippings of beef and pork, clarified, is very 
nice to fry in, instead of lard or butter. To clarify 
it, put the drippings into an iron pot ; to a quart of 
fat allow half a pint of cold water ; let it boil until 



USEFUL HINTS. 



131 



the water is boiled out, which may be known by its 
not bubbling. When the water has evaporated, 
strain it into an earthen pot, and keep it in a cool 
place for use. 

The fat from soup stock, and all other fat that 
with proper care accumulates in a kitchen, may be 
used for making soft soap with but very little 
trouble, and a great saving may be made thereby, 
as it is much better than the soap that you get in 
exchange for your house grease. 

To make Soft Soap. — Take seventeen pounds of 
potash to twenty of grease ; lay the potash at the 
bottom of the barrel ; boil the grease, and pour it 
on ; put in two pailsful of scalding water, and stir 
it all together. Fill up the barrel the next morning 
with cold water, stir it up from time to time, and in 
three days it will be fit for use.

PREFACE. 



This little book is the result of twenty years' experience, 
on the part of the author, in housekeeping. The receipts 
which it contains were, in great part, originally written 
down for her own convenience ; others from time to time 
have been added, with the hope that they might be of 
service to her daughters. She has been led to suppose 
that they might be made useful to others, also ; and for 
this reason, with the advice and encouragement of those 
on whom she ought to rely, they are now published. 

Without comparing this book with any other works of a 
similar character, it is thought that it proposes the three 
following characteristics : 

1. It contains no receipt which the author has not 
herself tried and proved, experimentally, to be good. 

2. It contains a sufficient number of receipts to meet all 
the ordinary wants of a family. 

3. A third object kept constantly in view has been to 
provide receipts, which will enable one to furnish a table 
handsomely, at the smallest expense. 

Great attention has been given to the last point. Few 
persons are aware what a difference the mode of cooking 
makes in the cost of a year's housekeeping. Without any 



iv PREFACE. 

increase of expenditure, one person, by means of good 
receipts, skilfully used, and by a tasteful arrangement of 
the table, will make a feast out of the articles of food 
which would have hardly sufficed another for the most 
indifferent meal. There are housekeepers whose table, 
notwithstanding great extravagance, is always disorderly 
and uninviting. They do not know how to make use 
of their materials, and they never get beyond a coarse, 
uninviting abundance. There are others, who, with the 
cheapest materials, and with very limited means, through 
good taste, good judgment, and good cooking, have always 
a table richly and handsomely furnished. 

In this, and in other respects, the intention has been to 
prepare a work for practical use. One of the greatest 
conveniences to a young housekeeper, is a Cook-Book, on 
the excellence of whose judgment she may rely ; while 
few things embarrass her more than one which is filled, 
not with a selection, but with an indiscriminate collection 
of receipts, good, bad, and indifferent, brought together 
hap-hazard, without any reference to their real value. 
This book has at least the negative merit of containing 
nothing inserted merely to swell the size of the volume ; 
and it is believed that it may claim the positive merit of 
containing good and economical rules, sufficient to meet 
any wants which are likely to occur in the common round 
of a housekeeper's life.

RECEIPTS. 



PLAIN BREAD AND CAKE. 

YEAST. 

One handful of hops, boiled half an hour in two 
quarts of water; ten good potatoes boiled half an 
hour, and mashed very fine. Strain the water from 
the hops on to the potatoes, very hot; stir in two 
table-spoonsful of salt, and one pint of flour; set it 
to cool. When lukewarm add one pint of good 
brewer's yeast, and let it rise six hours. Strain all 
through a cullender or sieve; put into a stone jug 
stopped tight. It will keep three weeks in winter, 
and one week in summer. 

BREAD. 

Three quarts of flour, half a cup of yeast, one 
table spoonful of salt, warm water enough to make 
it into dough. Knead this until it is perfectly 
smooth. Be sure to get all the flour off the sides of 



2 RECEIPTS. 

the pan ; set it in a warm place to rise at night; in 
the morning dissolve one teaspoonful of saleratus in 
a little warm water; knead this well into dough, 
divide it into two loaves, and bake, in a tolerable hot 
oven, about three quarters of an hour. 

A pint of Indian meal scalded, and mixed in with 
the flour, is by some persons considered an improve- 
ment. 

THIRD BREAD. 

One pint of rye meal, one pint of Indian meal, 
scalded, one pint of wheat flour, half a cup of yeast; 
mix it up with warm water into a stiff dough ; set 
it to rise eight hours. Bake it either in loaves or 
biscuit; wet the hands in cold water to put it into 
pans. Bake it in a hot oven forty minutes. 

BROWN BREAD. 

One quart of Indian meal ; one quart of rye meal ; 
one large spoonful of salt ; half a teacupful of yeast ; 
half a cup of molasses ; mix it with as warm water 
as the hands will bear; butter a deep pan; wet the 
hands with cold water, to put it in ; set it to rise one 
hour. Bake it in a hot oven four or five hours; if 
baked in a brick oven, it is better to keep it in the 
oven all night. 

BISCUIT. 

Two quarts of flour; about two ounces of butter; 
half a pint of boiling water ; one teaspoonful of salt ; 
a pint of cold milk ; mix this well together with the 



PLAIN BREAD AND CAKE. 3

and mix it well into the dough ; roll it on a bread 
board about an inch thick ; cut it into small biscuits, 
and bake them twenty minutes. 

SODA BISCUIT. 

Two quarts of flour ; four tea-spoonsful of cream 
tartar ; two of soda ; one of salt ; mixed into the 
flour when dry ; then mix it with cold milk to dough ; 
bake them in a quick oven about fifteen minutes. 

SHORT BISCUIT. 

One quart of flour ; a quarter of a pound of butter ; 
a little boiling water to melt the butter ; add milk 
enough to make a stiff dough ; cut into small biscuits 
and bake them quick. 

FLANNEL CAKES. 

To two ounces of butter add a pint of hot milk to 
melt it; a pint of cold milk ; five eggs ; flour enough 
to make a stiff batter ; one tea-spoonful of salt ; two 
table-spoonsful of yeast; set it to rise in a warm 
place about three hours ; butter the griddle, and pour 
on the batter in small cakes. 

CORN MEAL CAKES. 

One quart of sour milk; one table-spoonful of sale- 
ratus stirred in until it froths; four eggs; one table- 
spoonful of salt ; as much meal as will make a stiff 



4 RECEIPTS. 

batter ; butter the pans ; turn in the batter half an 
inch thick ; bake it half an hour. 

The above mixture fried on a griddle, as buck- 
wheat cakes are, are very nice. 

CORN MEAL CAKES. 

One quart of milk ; a quarter of a pound of butter; 
four eggs: one tea-spoonful of salt; (half a cup of 
sugar, if to the taste ;) fine Indian meal, to make a 
stiff batter ; bake it in tin pans half an hour. 

SOUR MILK BISCUIT. 

One quart of flour, a pint of sour milk, one tea- 
spoonful of saleratus, mixed into the milk until it 
froths; stir it into the flour cold ; mix it quick, and 
bake it in a quick oven. 

MUFFINS. 

One quart of warm milk; a piece of butter about 
the size of an egg ; four eggs ; a table-spoonful of 
salt; one cup of yeast; flour enough to make a stiff 
batter ; beat it up with a large spoon ; put it to rise six 
hours; fill the rings half full ; bake them about twenty 
minutes. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 

One quart of buckwheat flour; half a cup of yeast ; 
a table-spoouful of salt; warm water enough to make

cakes while hot. 



RYE CAKES. 



Two cups of rye flour; one cup of warm milk; 
one tea-spoonful of saleratus ; half a tea-spoonful of 
salt; four eggs; beat it lightly; fill the cups one 
third full, and bake one hour. 



RICE CAKES. 

Boil a cup of rice very soft; mash it fine ; add a 
pint of milk, and three eggs ; stir in a little flour ; 
butter the griddle, and turn on the batter in small 
cakes. Served with a little nutmeg and fine sugar. 

WAFFLES. 

Four eggs to a quart of milk ; a quarter of a pound 
of butter; a little salt; flour to make a batter not 
very thick ; heat and butter the irons well ; fill them, 
and bake them very quick. If for tea, grate on a 
little nutmeg and sugar ; if for breakfast, only butter 
them. 

RICE WAFFLES. 

A cup of rice boiled very soft and mashed very 
fine, add a little flour, and made the same as 
above. 



RECEIPTS. 



SOUPS. 

a calf's head soup. 

The head should be soaked in cold water, and 
washed very clean; to a large head take six quarts 
of water; boil it four hours; (the head may be 
dressed for dinner bf directions on page 37;) strain 
the liquor into a stone jar, and set it away to cool 
over night, or until the fat cools ; then skim off the 
fat ; take two quarts of the liquor, one dozen cloves, 
one dozen pepper-corns, salt, two onions, two carrots 
and two turnips cut fine; boil this two hours; cut 
into small pieces what you have left of the head, 
or as much as is required, put it into a sauce-pan, 
with the rest of the stock, and boil it one hour ; strain 
the liquor in which the vegetables were boiled, into 
this, and let it boil an hour and a half; then add 
three spoonsful of browned flour, braided into half a 
pound of butter and a pint of red wine ; give it one 
boil. Have ready some force-meat balls, made of 
some of the head and brains, chopped fine and sea- 
soned with pepper, salt, cloves, and sweet herbs, 
mixed very hard with two eggs, and fried in hot 
butter, also six eggs boiled hard, and two lemons 
sliced ; put the force-meat balls, lemon, the yolk of 
the eggs, and three table-spoonsful of soy, into the 
bottom of the tureen ; then turn the soup on this, and 
send it to the table very hot. All this will make 
about five quarts of soup. 



SOUPS. 7 

GUMBO SOUP. 

Take a shin of veal and an old fowl ; put them 
into a soup pot with two carrots and two turnips 
sliced, an onion whole, and six quarts of water ; boil 
it five hours ; take out the chicken, and cut it into 
small pieces ; cut two onions up in slices, fry them 
brown in butter ; then take out the onion, and put 
in the pieces of chicken, and fry them brown; put 
the onions into a saucepan, shake a little flour into 
the hot butter, stirring it all the time ; care should 
be taken that this does not oil or burn. When this 
is done, put it in with the chicken ; strain the soup 
into it, and boil it half an hour. Take three quarts 
of oysters, wash them out of the liquor, strain the 
liquor into the soup, put the oysters in, and let it boil 
up once ; mix three table-spoonsful of gumbo in half 
a pint of cold water; stir this in the soup, while the 
soup is boiling, but do not let it boil after the gumbo 
is put in. 

Send to the table with the soup, a dish of boiled 
rice to eat with it; a spoonful of it should be served 
with each plate of soup. 

PEA SOUP. 

Put one quart of peas to soak over night in soft 
water ; the next morning wash them out, and put 
them into a soup pot with two carrots, two onions, a 
stock of celery, and four quarts of water ; let this 
boil four or five hours; (have boiling water at hand 
to add, as the water boils away much faster in pea 



8 RECEIPTS. 

soup than any other kind) ; strain the soup through a 
very coarse sieve ; have a piece of salt pork boiled 
in another pot one hour; then take it out and skin 
it; put the soup and the pork back into the pot, and 
boil it gently one hour, frequently stirring it with a 
large spoon ; great care should be taken that it does 
not scorch. 

OYSTER SOUP. 

Take a shin of veal, put it into a pot with three 
quarts of water, two carrots and two onions cut up, 
pepper and salt; boil it three hours, then strain it 
all through a sieve ; add three quarters of a pound 
of butter braided in three table-spoonsful of flour ; 
stir it in, and give it one boil; have ready washed 
out of the liquor one gallon of oysters ; strain the 
liquor into the soup; let it boil up; then put in the 
oysters, and a tumbler and a half of white wine ; 
give it one boil, and send it to the table very hot. 

WHITE OYSTER SOUP 

Is made the same as the above, with the excep- 
tion of the wine ; instead of which, put a pint and 
a half of cream — and stir all the time until it is 
dished. 

LOBSTER SOUP. 

Take a shin of veal, two carrots, two onions, pep- 
per, salt, mace, and four quarts of water. Boil it 
three or four hours. Break up a large lobster, take 
the meat out of the shell, break the shell up, and 



soups. 9 

put it into a saucepan with water enough to cover 
it. Let this simmer while the sonp is boiling; then 
strain all this, and put it back into the soup pot; cut 
the lobster very fine, and put it into the soup; and 
boil it two hours. If you have the row of coral of 
the lobster, grate it and put it into the soup; it 
adds very much to the appearance of the soup. Add 
a quarter of a pound of butter, braided into two 
spoonsful of flour, a cup of white wine, and a spoon- 
ful of vinegar or the juice of a lemon. 

VERY GOOD SOUPS 

May be made with very little expense. In the 
winter you can keep cold meat and poultry bones 
several days, until you have enough to make a very 
nice stock, or the water that mutton, chicken, or 
turkey is boiled in. Let it stand in an earthen jar, 
and it will keep in cold weather two or three days. 

A VERY SIMPLE SOUP. 

Skim off the fat from mutton or chicken stock, 
put it into a soup pot with two or three carrots, tur- 
nips and onions, a cup of rice, the bones and bits of 
cold meat, pepper, salt, and a few tomatoes if you 
have them. Boil it four hours ; then take out the 
bones and send it to the table. 

A ROAST BEEF AND BOILED TURKEY SOUP. 

Take the liquor that the turkey is boiled in, and 
the bones of the turkey and beef, put them into a 



10 EECEIPTS. 

soup pot with two or three carrots, turnips and 
onions, half a dozen cloves, pepper, salt, and toma- 
toes if you have any. Boil it four hours, then strain 
all out. Put the soup back into the pot, mix two 
table-spoonsful of flour in a little cold water ; stir it 
into the soup ; give it one boil ; cut some bread dice- 
form, lay it in the bottom of the tureen, pour the 
soup on to it, and color it with a little soy. 

ROAST VEAL AND CHICKEN-BONES 

Make a very nice soup boiled with vegetables as 
the above ; but add a handful of maccaroni, break 
it up fine, and boil the soup half an hour after it is 
put in. Color the soup with a little soy or catsup. 

ROAST VENISON SOUP. 

Break up the bone, put it into a soup pot with 
about four quarts of water, carrots, onions, pep- 
per, salt and cloves. Boil it three hours, then strain 
it. Take half a pound of butter braided in three 
spoonsful of flour and stir into the soup ; let it boil 
up once ; then add half a pint of red wine ; cut 
some pieces of toasted bread in dice-form, and lay 
in the bottom of the tureen. Turn the soup on to it. 

TO MAKE STOCK FOR WHITE SOUP AND GRAVIES. 

Put two knuckles or shins of veal, two onions, 
two table-spoonsful of salt, into eight quarts of wa- 
ter. Boil this six hours ; strain it into a stone jar, 



SOUPS. 1 1 

and keep it in a cold place. When it is cold, take 
off the fat.* 

WHITE SOUP. 

Take as much of the stock as you think you 
want, put it into a saucepan with one or two carrots 
and turnips, one onion, a little rice or vermicelli, and 
about one fourth as much water as you have stock ; 
a very little mace, pepper and salt, is required. Boil 
this one hour. Take out the vegetables, and serve 
it with the rice or vermicelli only. 

A WHITE VEGETABLE SOUP. 

Take a third as much water as you want soup ; 
two carrots, two turnips, and two onions, cut them 
in dice-form; a very little celery, a table-spoonful of 
salt, and a little mace. Put this all into a saucepan, 
boil it one hour, add the two-thirds of stock. Boil 
this all together three quarters of an hour. If it is 
not seasoned to your taste, add whatever is required. 

VERMICELLI SOUP. 

Put a shin of veal, one onion, two carrots, two 
turnips, and a little salt, into four quarts of water. 
Boil this three hours; then add two cups of vermi- 



* This is very useful to put into any kind of white meat 
soups, gravies, and pies. There should be great care taken to 
skim all kinds of soups, particularly those made of fresh meat. 
The scum rises very thick just before it begins to boil, and that 
is the proper time to skim it. 



12 RECEIPTS. 



celli, and boil it an hour and a half longer. Then, 
before serving, take out the bone and vegetables. 



ANOTHER WHITE SOUP. 

Make soup as above. Beat up two or three eggs 
and put into the tureen ; then strain the soup 
through a sieve on to the eggs, stirring them all 
the time. Send it to the table immediately, or the 
eggs will settle if allowed to stand. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

Boil a shin of veal three hours, or take some soup 
stock. Cut up two onions, two carrots, and two tur- 
nips, and put with it ; also pepper, salt, and one 
dozen tomatoes. Boil this two hours, and strain it 
through a sieve. Toast some pieces of bread a light 
brown, cut them in dice-form, and put them into the 
tureen. The soup should be turned on to the toast 
just before it is taken to the table, as soaking long 
spoils it. 

MUTTON BROTH. 

Boil a shoulder of mutton in four quarts of water 
two hours. Add one onion, two turnips, two carrots 
cut fine, one table-spoonful of salt, and one cup of 
rice. Boil this an hour and a half; cut a little pars- 
ley, and put it in five minutes before dishing. Dish 
the mutton with drawn butter and capers. Garnish 
the dish with carrots and turnips. 



SOUPS. 13 

TO MAKE STOCK FOR BROWN SOUP. 

Take two shins of beef, a shin of veal, eight 
quarts of water, one dozen cloves, and one dozen 
pepper-corns. Boil this eight hours; strain it into a 
stone jar, and when it is cold remove the fat. 

This is a very nice stock to use instead of water 
in making gravies for any kind of dark meat, such 
as beef, mutton, venison, and all kinds of wild 
fowl. 

A SHIN OF BEEF SOUP. 

It is better to have the beef boiled the day before 
the soup is wanted ; if that is not convenient, have 
the shin cracked up well, put it to boil in five or six 
quarts of water, boil it five or six hours, skim it very 
often ; cut up very fine half of a white cabbage, chop 
two turnips, three carrots, and three onions ; put 
them into the soup, with pepper and salt, and boil it 
two hours; half an hour before serving take out the 
bone and gristle. If you have some raised dough, 
make up a dozen little balls the size of a nutmeg, 
and drop them into the soup, and boil it half an 
hour. 

OX-TAIL SOUP 

May be made as the above. Straining the vege- 
tables out, put the soup back into the pot; mix a 
pint of thickening of flour and water, season it with 
pepper, salt, and a little cloves; stir this all into the 
soup, and let it boil half an hour. The ox-tails are 
dressed the same, and put in instead of the shins. 



14 RECEIPTS. 



GIBLET SOUP. 



Take a scrag of veal, one dozen giblets, a little 
mace, pepper, salt, two onions, two carrots ; put 
them into a pot with three quarts of water, and boil 
it three hours ; strain the soup ; cut up the gizzard 
and braid up the liver ; put them into the soup ; mix 
two spoonsful of flour with a quarter of a pound of 
butter ; stir this into the soup with a cup of red 
wine, and let it boil up once. 

COLD BEEF BONE, PIECES OF STEAK, ETC. 

Put them into a pot with three or four quarts of 
water, two or three carrots, turnips and onions, a few 
cloves, pepper, salt, and half a dozen tomatoes if you 
have them ; boil it gently three or four hours, then 
strain it all out, put the soup back into the pot ; mix 
a table-spoonful of flour with water, stir it into the 
soup, and let it boil ten minutes ; cut some pieces of 
toast fine, and put in. 

A BROWN BEEF SOUP. 

Cut what is called a vein of a round of beef in a 
square handsome form, weighing about six pounds ; 
put it into a pot with four or five quarts of water, a 
dozen cloves, pepper and salt, and boil it three hours ; 
cut in dice-form some carrots and turnips, chop up 
two onions and a head of celery, toast brown two 
slices of bread, put them all into the soup, and boil 



SOUPS. 15 

it two hours; then take out the meat if it is not 
quite brown enough, and add a little soy. 

This piece of meat makes a very nice dish next 
day. Cat up two carrots, one turnip, and two onions 
in dice-form ; put the meat and vegetables into a 
sauce-pan, and add pepper, salt, a little cloves, and 
just water enough {o cover the meat ; stew it gently 
two or three hours ; take out the meat, mix a little 
flour in water, and two spoonsful of mixed mustard; 
stir these into the gravy, give it one boil, and turn 
the gravy and vegetables over the meat. 

A SOUP MADE QUICKLY. 

Take two quarts of soup stock, put it to boil with 
an onion, two carrots and one turnip chopped fine, 
and season it with pepper and salt; if it is made of 
brown stock, add half a tea-spoonful of cloves, and 
boil it half an hour, then add a cup of red wine ; but 
if it is made of white stock, put in half a tea-spoonful 
of ground mace, and a cup of white wine. 

BEEF SOUP. 

Take a head of celery, one quarter of a white cab- 
bage shaved very fine, three carrots, two turnips, and 
two onions cut very fine; put this all into a soup pot, 
with two quarts of cold water, and boil it two hours ; 
then add two quarts of the beef stock, boil this one 
hour ; then take three spoonsful of flour, mix it with 
half a pint of water and a little salt and pepper; stir 
this into the soup half an hour before serving it ; put 



16 RECEIPTS. 

two table-spoonsful of India soy into the tureen, turn 
the soup on to it, stir it up, and serve it very hot. 

CLEAR BEEF SOUP. 

Make it as the above ; put some pieces of bread 
toasted brown and cut into dice-form into the bottom 
of the tureen, and strain the soup on it through a 
sieve. 



FISH. 

CHOWDER. 

Take a cod weighing about six pounds, and a 
haddock weighing four pounds; cut them in pieces 
about six inches square, wash them clean and wipe 
them dry, and dredge them with a little flour; cut 
into slices about a quarter of a pound of salt pork and 
two onions; fry the pork a nice brown in a pot large 
enough to make the soup in ; then take out the pork 
and fry the onions, and be careful not to burn them ; 
when these are done, put into the hot fat a layer of 
fish, then put in a little of the onion, a few bits of 
pork, a little pepper and salt, dredge in some flour; 
and if you like the flavor put in a little tomato, then 
another layer of fish, and then the seasoning, and 
continue this until the fish and seasoning are all in 
the pot ; split eight hard crackers, dip them into cold 



FISH. 17 

water, and lay them over the fish ; put in hot water 
enough to cover the fish, and after it begins to boil, 
let it boil thirty minutes. Some like half milk and 
half water; if milk is used, the tomato should be 
omitted : for those who like spice, a little clove and 
mace, with a quart of red wine, is a great improve- 
ment. 

BOILED COD. 

The head and shoulders is considered the best to 
boil ; lay it into cold water, with a handful of salt, 
and let it remain one hour ; then scrape and wash it 
clean, rub a little salt and cayenne pepper into the 
body, flour a cloth, pin the fish up tight, and put it 
into boiling water ; after it begins to boil, let it boil 
thirty minutes, or according to the size of the fish ; 
serve it with drawn butter or oyster sauce. 

BAKED COD. 

A fish weighing six or eight pounds is a good size 
to bake ; it should be cooked whole to look well. 
Make a dressing of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, par- 
sley, and onion, and a little salt pork chopped fine ; 
mix this up with one egg, fill the body, sew it up, 
lay it into a large pan ; lay across it some strips of 
salt pork to flavor it; put one pint of water and a 
little salt into the pan; bake it an hour and a half; 
baste it often with butter; dish the fish, shake into 
the gravy a little flour, a little butter, and two spoons- 
ful of tomato or walnut catsup ; give it one boil, and 
turn it over the fish.

BROILED SCROD. 

Take a small cod, or the tail of a large one, sprin- 
kle a little salt over it, and let it remain over night; 
in the morning wash off the salt, and wipe it dry; 
set the outside to the fire first, and let it broil gently 
half an hour; when it is dished, rub it with a little 
butter and a very little pepper ; send it to the table 
very hot. 

HADDOCK. 

Cut into square pieces a haddock, lay them into a 
saucepan with a little salt, red pepper, a little mace, 
and some small pieces of butter ; dredge in a little 
flour or cracker crumbs, and then another layer of 
fish and seasoning; cover this tight, and let it sim- 
mer gently one hour; dish it very carefully, and 
turn the gravy over the fish. 

TO STEW HADDOCK IN ITS OWN LIQUOR. 

Take a haddock, split it open and take the bone 
wholly out ; then cut the fish into square pieces 
about the length of your finger; take some pounded 
mace and cayenne mixed, and put it upon the pieces 
of fish with your fingers in spots, not quite an inch 
apart upon the inside; then butter the sides and 
bottom of a large stewpan, put the fish in skin side 
down, close together, but not one upon another. The 
pan must be cold when the fish is put in; let it stew 
slowly about an hour and a quarter ; just before it is 
quite done mix some butter and flour well together, 



FISH. 19 

add a glass of white wine, and when well mixed 
turn it into the pan, and let it boil about ten miniftes; 
when ready for serving, take the fish out carefully 
in a deep dish, the spiced side up, and pour the gravy 
over it. 

FRIED COD AND HADDOCK. 

Cut the fish in pieces about the size to help at table, 
wash and wipe them dry, roll them in Indian meal. 
Fry some pieces of salt pork ; take out the pork, and 
put into the frying-pan some lard. When it is quite 
hot, put in the fish and fry it a light brown. Dish it 
with the fried pork. Serve with drawn butter in a 
sauce tureen. 

FRIED SMELTS. 

Split them just far enough to clean them, lay 
them in salt and water, and let them remain an 
hour ; then wash them clean and wipe them dry. 
Have ready two eggs beat up in a plate, and some 
cracker crumbs. Put about two pounds of lard into 
the frying pan, set it on the fire until it is very hot 
dip the smelts into the egg, roll them in the crumbs, 
and put them into the boiling fat. Fry them a light 
brown ; serve them hot, with drawn butter. 

FRIED PERCH. 

Clean all off but the heads ; prepare them the 
same as smelts. They require a longer time to fry 
than smelts, being larger and thicker. 

Fresh cod's tongues, fried in the same way, are 
very nice. 



RECEIPTS. 



FRIED SALMON. 

Cut the salmon into slices half an inch thick, 
shake some flour over them, and fry them in butter, 
or in sweet oil, or with egg and crumbs, as smelts. 

FRIED HALIBUT 

Is fried the same way as salmon. 

BOILED SALMON. 

Salmon should be well cleansed, but not soaked 
in water ; rub a little salt into the body, flour a cloth 
and pin it up, and put it into boiling water. For a 
piece weighing six pounds, after it begins to boil let 
it boil about half an hour. Serve it with drawn 
butter and eggs, or lemon fish sauce, or lobster 
sauce. 

BROILED SALMON. 

It may be either cut in slices, as fried salmon, or 
split to the tail ; broil it very quick, and when it is 
dished rub some butter over it. 

BOILED HALIBUT. 

Some like the tail best, but the next cut is nicest, 
and a much handsomer piece to dish. Rub a little 
salt over it, and lay it in cold water a little while; 
then wash it and scrape it very clean, put it into a 
floured cloth, and then into boiling water. A piece 
weighing eight pounds would require thirty-five 
minutes to cook. 



FISH. 21 

BROILED HALIBUT. 

The nape, a large one, is the best piece for broil- 
ing. Sprinkle a little flour over it, wash it, and wipe 
it dry; put the outside to the fire first, and broil it 
moderately a half an hour. When it is dished, 
spread a little butter and pepper over it. 

BROILED MACKEREL. 

Split it down the back, sprinkle it with a little 
salt, and broil it before a quick fire. Put the outside 
to the fire first. When done, spread over it some 
butter, and send it to the table very hot. 

BOILED MACKEREL. 

Draw the inwards out at the vent, and then put 
the mackerel, if two, into separate cloths. Boil them 
twenty minutes, and serve them with drawn butter. 

SMALL MACKEREL 

Are very nice, cut and fried the same as cod fish. 

SALMON TROUT. 

Salmon trout are broiled or fried the same as 
mackerel. Serve it with fish sauce. 

TAUTOG, OR BLACK FISH. 

This fish is very hard to clean. Lay them in a 
pan, and pour boiling-hot water over them ; then 



22 RECEIPTS. 

scrape them very hard until you get off all the 
scales; then wash and clean them in cold water. 
Let them lay in salt and water a while. Make a 
dressing of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, a little clove, 
a great deal of parsley, one onion, and a little salt 
pork, chopped fine. Mix this all up with a little 
butter. Then stuff the fish, and sew it up ; put it 
into an iron pan, lay some strips of salt pork over it 
to flavor it, and put into the pan a pint of water and 
a pint of red wine ; set it into the oven of the range, 
and do not quite close the door. Let it stew gently 
one hour and a half. Baste it very often with the 
wine and butter. When the fish is done, thicken 
the gravy with a little flour and butter; give it one 
boil, and turn it over the fish. 

EELS. 

After they are skinned, turn boiling water over 
them, and let them remain about half an hour. To 
fry them, cut them up in pieces about six inches 
long, and fry them the same as codfish. 

BAKED EELS. 

Sprinkle some flour over them, and some pieces 
of butter ; put them into a pan with a little water, 
and bake them half an hour. When they are dished, 
make a gravy in the dish that they were baked in 
with some butter, flour, a little water, mustard and 
catsup. Give it one boil, and turn it on the eels. 



FISH. 23 



SALT FISH, OR DUN FISH. 



If you wish to cook a fish whole, put it into the 
fish kettle with six or eight quarts of water at night; 
the next morning wash it clean out of the water, 
wash out the kettle, put in the fish again, with as 
much clean water as at first, and set it so near the 
fire as to scald, but not to boil. One hour before 
dinner time, take the fish up into a pan of clean cold 
water, wash off all the skin and fins, wash out the 
kettle again, and lay in the fish carefully; add fresh 
water, and set the kettle on the fire to boil thirty 
minutes ; dish it in a clean napkin, on a fish dish ; 
to eat with drawn butter and pork scraps. 

To make what is called scraps, cut a quarter of a 
pound of fat salt pork into very small square pieces; 
put it into a frying-pan, stirring them frequently until 
the fat is extracted, and the scraps are done light 
brown. 

If you do not wish to cook a whole fish, cut it 
into pieces about eight inches square; when dished, 
garnish with eggs boiled hard, and cut into slices, 
with boiled beets. Beets should always be served 
with salt fish. 

TO MINCE FISH. 

Chop the fish very fine ; chop half as much more 
boiled potatoes as fish ; fry out the pork as before 
stated ; mix the potatoes and fish together, put it 
into the hot fat, stir it up well, add a little hot water 
and a piece of butter the size of an egg ; stir it all 



04 RECEIPTS. 

up well until it gets very hot; let it stand until it 
browns a little, and serve it hot; or mince the fish as 
before directed, make it into balls, and fry them in 
pork or butter. 

STEWED OYSTERS. 

Wash a gallon of oysters ; let the liquor stand and 
settle about ten minutes; strain it through a fine 
sieve into a saucepan ; add one third as much cold 
water as liquor, and a quarter of a pound of butter; 
braid into it a little flour or cracker crumbs, and stir 
this into the liquor ; add a little cayenne pepper, and 
mace if liked, and boil this up; add the oysters, toast 
half a dozen crackers, and butter them a little ; lay 
them into the oyster dish, and pour the oysters on to 
them. Before dishing, add a wine glass of white 
wine, or half a wine glass of vinegar. 

SCOLLOPED OYSTERS. 

Wash out of the liquor two quarts of oysters; 
pound very fine eight soft crackers, or grate a stale 
loaf of bread; butter a deep dish, sprinkle in a layer 
of crumbs, then a layer of oysters ; a little mace, 
pepper, and bits of butter ; another layer of crumbs, 
another of oysters, then seasoning as before, and so 
on, until the dish is filled ; cover the dish over with 
bread crumbs, seasoning as before ; turn over it a cup 
of the oyster liquor, or a cup of white wine ; set it 
into the oven for thirty or forty minutes to brown. 



FISH. 25 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

Take large oysters, wash them clean out of the 
liquor, and wipe them dry; dip them in eggs, and 
then in crumbs, and fry them in hot fat. 

A DISH OF COLD OYSTERS 

Is very nice in warm weather, to serve before 
meats instead of soup. 

OYSTER PIE. 

Wash out of the liquor two quarts of oysters ; 
season them with pepper, a little mace, a glass of 
white wine ; add a cup of very fine cracker crumbs, 
and some little bits of butter ; put them into the pie 
dish, lined with paste ; add half the liquor. The 
dish must be quite full, and covered with a rich puff 
paste ; baked until the crust is done. 

OYSTER PATTIES. 

Line small patty pans with a good paste ; cut 
some covers to the pans with a rich puff paste ; bake 
the crust on tin sheets ; wash a quart of oysters out 
of the liquor, and put them into a saucepan; add a 
piece of butter the size of an egg, half a tea-spoonful 
of mace, a wineglass-full of white wine, the juice of 
a lemon, and a very little flour; give them one scald, 
stirring all the time; fill the patties, put on the crust, 
and send to the table immediately, as the crusts 
should not get soaked before using them. 



26 ' RECEIPTS. 

STEWED LOBSTER. 

Take out all the meat and soft part from the body, 
and cut it up into small bits ; put them into a sauce- 
pan with two cups of white stock, a little mace, 
cayenne and salt ; drudge in some flour, some bits of 
butter, and stew it about ten or fifteen minutes ; stir 
it frequently, and when done, add a little vinegar or 
white wine. 



MEATS. 



ROAST BEEF. 



A piece of beef weighing ten pounds, requires two 
hours to roast. Allow ten minutes to every pound 
over or under this weight. Do not put the meat too 
close to the fire at first. When half done turn the 
fat out of the roaster, then baste the meat with the 
drippings of the meat two or three times. Do not 
salt or flour it until nearly done. Just before dish- 
ing, dredge on a little salt and flour, baste it well, 
and set it close to the fire to froth. 

The second cut of the sirloin, the second cut of 
the ribs, and the back of the rump, are considered 
the best parts for roasting. 



MEATS. 27 

TO MAKE A GOOD BEEF GRAVY. 

Take the drippings from the meat, turn it into 
a saucepan, and add a cup of boiling water; shake 
in a little flour and salt, and let it just come to a boil, 
stirring it all the time; add a table-spoonful of soy 
or tomato catsup. 

BEEF STEAK. 

A rump steak is the best; a sirloin is the next best. 
To broil a steak requires a quick fire. If cooked by 
a range, it should be put in front, and not on the 
top. Never use a fork to turn the steak, nor salt it 
while cooking. 

A steak half an inch thick requires ten minutes, 
and one an inch thick requires fifteen minutes. 
Have ready a hot dish, put the steak upon it, and a 
little butter upon both sides ; salt and pepper to suit 
the taste ; adding a little tomato catsup to the 
gravy improves it. 

Waterman's patent gridiron is the best to use with 



a range. 



BEEF STEAK WITH OYSTER SAUCE. 

Cook the steak as above. Take the liquor of a 
quart of oysters, put it into a saucepan with about 
six ounces of butter mixed with a little flour, and let 
it come to a boil ; turn in the oysters ; let this boil 
up once ; turn it on the steak, and send it to the 
table very hot. 



28 RECEIPTS. 

BEEF STEAK WITH SMOTHERED ONIONS. 

Cook the beef steak as before directed. Cut up 
six onions very fine, put them into a saucepan with 
a cup of hot water, a piece of butter about the size 
of an egg, pepper, salt, and a little flour ; let it stew 
until the onions are quite soft; turn this over the 
steak quite hot. 

ALAMODE BEEF. 

Take a piece of the round of beef, weighing about 
ten or twelve pounds; tie it up with a strong string, 
in the form of a round. Take half a table-spoonful 
of pepper, one of salt, one of ground cloves, and 
two of sugar; rub these all over the meat the night 
before it is to be cooked ; make a nice force meat of 
half a brick loaf of crumbs, two sausages, one onion 
chopped fine, two table-spoonsful of sweet herbs, one 
of cloves, one of salt, half a one of pepper, and two 
eggs. Mix them well together. Make holes in your 
meat about two inches apart, fill them with the 
dressing, and sew them up. Stick an onion full 
of cloves, put it into the pot, and add one quart of 
water, and one quart of red wine. Place skewers 
in the pot, about two inches from the bottom ; lay 
your beef on them ; cover the pot very tight, to pre- 
vent the steam from escaping. Let this stew gently 
four hours ; turn the meat two or three times while 
cooking; turn a pint of red wine over the meat; 
let it stew an hour longer ; thicken your gravy with 
a little flour and a little salt, skim off the fat, and 



MEATS. 29 

boil it up once. Turn a part over your meat when 
dished, and send the remainder of it to table in a 
sauce tureen. 

BOUILLI BEEF. 

Put a part of a brisket of beef, weighing six 
pounds, into a saucepan, and cold water enough to 
cover it. Let it boil until the scum rises, and skim 
it nicely ; add two carrots, two turnips, and one 
onion, cut in dice form; stick an onion full of cloves. 
Let all this simmer three hours. Add one tumbler 
full of red wine, two tea-spoonsful of mixed mus- 
tard, and one table-spoonful of soy. Let it simmer 
one hour. When done, sprinkle over it some pickled 
cucumbers, cut very fine ; stir a little flour into your 
gravy, give it one boil, turn it into the dish with the 
meat, and send it to the table very hot. 

A BEEF PIE. 

Take cold roast beef or steak, cut it into thin 
slices, and put a layer into a pie dish ; shake in a 
little flour, pepper, and salt; cut up a tomato (if you 
have it), or onion chopped very fine; then another 
layer of beef and seasoning, and so on until the dish 
is filled. If you have any beef gravy, put it in ; if 
not, a little beef drippings, and water enough to 
make sufficient gravy. Have ready one dozen po- 
tatoes well boiled and mashed ; add half a cup of 
milk or cream, and a little butter and salt. Spread it 
over the pie as a crust, an inch thick ; brush it over 
with egg, and bake it about twenty-five minutes. 



30 RECEIPTS. 

BEEF OLIVES. 

Take a slice of the round of beef about an inch 
thick, beat it with a rolling pin to the thickness of 
half an inch, and cut it into four inch squares. 
Have ready some dressing, made of beef, a little salt 
pork, one onion chopped very fine, one cup of bread 
crumbs, pepper, salt, cloves, and sweet marjoram. 
Mix all this up with an egg, put it into the pieces of 
steak, and sew them up in the form of olives ; lay 
them in a tin pan with a cup of brown stock, 
sprinkle a little flour over them, and set them in the 
oven. When half done, baste them with a little 
butter. They require about twenty minutes' cook- 
ing. Dish your olives ; add to the gravy half a cup 
of boiling water, a small piece of butter, a little 
flour, and two tea-spoonsful of soy. Give this one 
boil, and turn it over the olives when ready to send 
to the table. 

TRIPE. 

The honey-comb part is the best. Cut it in square 
pieces of about six inches, wash it in salt and water, 
wipe it dry, dip it in eggs and crumbs or batter, and 
fry it in hot fat. Serve it with oyster sauce. After 
dishing the tripe, turn a quart of oyster sauce 
over it. 

CORNED BEEF. 

The navel end of the brisket is the best piece to 
boil. It should be put into cold water. Just before 
it boils take the scum off. A piece of beef weighing 



MEATS. 31 

eight pounds requires five hours' boiling. Before 
sending to the table, the bone should be taken out, 
and the beef pressed half an hour. If done so, it 
looks much nicer and cuts better. 

EDGE BONE OF BEEF 

Weighing ten pounds, should be boiled three 
hours, as this piece should be a little rare. 

BRISKET OF BEEF STUFFED. 

A piece weighing eight pounds -requires about five 
or six hours to boil. Make a dressing of bread 
crumbs, pepper, salt, sweet herbs, a little mace, and 
one onion chopped fine and mixed with an egg. Put 
the dressing in between the fat and lean of the beef, 
and sew it up tight ; flour a cloth, pin the beef up 
very tight in it, boil it five or six hours. When it is 
done, take the cloth off, and press it until it is cold. 
This is to be cut in thin slices and eaten cold. 

SALTPETRED TONGUE 

Requires five or six hours to boil. When done, 
lay it into cold water three minutes; peal off the 
skin, beginning at the tip end of the tongue, as it 
comes off much easier. 

BOUILLI TONGUE. 

Take a fresh beef tongue, and boil it two hours. 
Lay it into cold water about five minutes, skin it, 



32 RECEIPTS. 

and let it remain until the next day ; then dress it 
the same as bouilli beef. This makes a very nice 
dish. 

ROAST LEG OF MUTTON. 

A leg of mutton weighing ten pounds should be 
roasted two hours. When half done, turn the fat 
out of the roaster; then what drips from the meat, 
you baste the meat with. Make the gravy the same 
as for roast beef, or add a few spoonsful of currant 
jelly and a cup of red wine. Ten minutes more 
should be allowed for every extra pound of mutton. 

ROAST SADDLE OF MUTTON. 

A saddle of mutton, weighing eight pounds, re- 
quires three quarters of an hour to cook; the gravy 
is made the same as for a leg of mutton. 

A SHOULDER OF MUTTON ROASTED, 

Weighing six pounds, requires one hour to roast; 
if stuffed, half an hour longer. Before cooking it, 
take out the bone, and fill the space with a dressing 
of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, sweet marjoram, one 
egg, and a small piece of butter. 

A LEG OF MUTTON BOILED. 

A leg of mutton, weighing ten pounds, requires an 
hour and a half to boil. Flour a cloth, tie the meat 
in it very tight, and put it into boiling water; when 
done, put it into a pan and turn cold water over it 



MEATS. 33 

and let it remain two minutes before removing the 
cloth; this makes the mutton look very white. 

A SHOULDER OF MUTTON BOILED 

Is cooked in the same way as a leg, except that it 
takes a half an hour less time to boil. 

HARICOT MUTTON. 

Take a cold leg of boiled mutton, or a small one not 
boiled, and put it into a saucepan that covers close ; 
cut into dice-form two carrots, two turnips, and two 
onions ; put them around or under the mutton, add 
eight or ten cloves, pepper, salt and water enough to 
cover the mutton; simmer it four hours, and the 
water will waste away, leaving enough to make the 
gravy; after taking out the meat, skim off all the fat 
you can before making the gravy ; about half an 
hour before dishing, stir in a cup of white wine and 
two tea-spoonsful of soy ; dish the mutton ; stir a little 
flour into the gravy, give it one boil, and then turn 
the vegetables and gravy over the meat. 

MUTTON CHOPS, 

If broiled on a gridiron, should be wrapped in 
paper; they require about ten minutes to cook; when 
they are taken out of the papers to be dished, season 
them with pepper, salt, and a little butter. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Lay the mutton chops into a pan, dredge a little 
flour over them, put them into the oven with the

door half open; they require about fifteen minutes to 
cook ; have prepared a hot dish ; after you dish the 
chops, dredge a little flour into your gravy, with a 
few spoonsful of hot water, tomato catsup, pepper, 
and salt ; give it one boil, and turn it over the chops. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Beat up an egg, and season the chops with pepper 
and salt; dip them in the egg, and then roll them in. 
bread crumbs; put them into a pan, and set them in 
the oven; cook them about fifteen minutes; after 
dishing the chops, add to your gravy a little butter, 
red wine, and currant jelly ; dredge in a little flour ; 
let it boil once, and turn it over the chops. 

A FILLET OF VEAL ROASTED. 

The bone should be taken out; fill the cavity with 
a dressing made of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, and 
sweet marjoram, a piece of butter the size of an egg, 
or a little fat pork chopped very fine, and one egg; 
mix this up well ; skewer the veal tight to keep the 
dressing in. It adds to the look and taste of a fillet 
of veal to lard it with pork ; if this is not done, it 
should be basted often with butter. A piece weigh- 
ing eight pounds requires four hours to roast. 

A LOIN OF YEAL 

Is very nice, roasted plain ; it is, however, very 
palatable cooked the same as a fillet of veal, by 



MEATS. 35 

taking out the kidneys, and putting dressing in their 
place. It requires three hours if roasted plain, and 
three and a half hours with dressing. 

A BREAST OF VEAL, ROASTED, 

Requires an hour and a half to roast ; a few strips 
of pork laid across it makes it much nicer. 

BOILED YEAL. 

A fillet or shoulder of veal is very nice boiled ; 
prepared the same as to roast. Boil three hours, and 
serve with celery or oyster sauce. 

TO RAGOUT A BREAST OF VEAL. 

Lay a breast of veal in a pan with a pint of water, 
a little salt, pepper and mace ; to stew an hour and 
a half, and turn it once or twice ; make some force- 
meat balls, with a little veal chopped fine, a few 
bread crumbs, sweet herbs, salt, pepper, a little 
butter, and one egg; mix it well together, and make 
it into small balls, and lay them on the meat ; baste 
it with butter, dredge on a little flour, set it into the 
oven to brown about twenty minutes, and dish the 
veal; add to the gravy a glass of white wine, a little 
butter, and a little flour ; give it one boil, and pour 
the gravy over the meat. 

A RAGOUT VEAL WITH VEGETABLES. 

Cut in small dice-form one carrot and one turnip, 



36 RECEIPTS. 

chop one onion fine, and put them into a pan with 
a quart of water, a little pepper, salt, and mace. 
Put in the veal ; set it into the oven ; turn the meat 
once or twice ; stew it two hours ; take it out, dredge 
on some flour, and baste it with the gravy. Set it 
into the oven again to brown. When done, dish the 
meat, stir into the gravy a little flour, a little soy or 
tomato catsup, give it one boil, and turn it over the 
meat. 

A VEAL PIE. 

A rack of veal cut into small pieces, parboil in 
water enough to fill your pie dish ; when about half 
cooked, take the veal out to cool, season the gravy 
with pepper, salt, a little mace, and a little salt pork; 
dredge in a little flour, line the sides of your dish 
with paste, lay in your meat and gravy, cover it 
with a thick paste, and cut a little hole in the top. 
Bake it half an hour. 

VEAL CUTLET. 

Fry half a dozen slices of salt pork a nice brown 
color ; take out the pork and keep it hot ; and add a 
few spoonsful of cook fat. A slice from the leg of 
veal makes the best cutlet. Wash and wipe the 
slices very dry ; have ready an egg beaten, and some 
bread crumbs ; dip the cutlet first into the egg, and 
then into the crumbs; lay them into the hot fat; fry 
about fifteen or twenty minutes, or until they are of 
a nice brown. Dish the cutlets. Make your gravy

by adding a little hot water and butter ; dredge in 
a little flour and soy, and give it one boil, stirring it 
all the time ; turn it over the cutlets, garnished with 
scraped horseradish and the salt pork. 

VEAL CRQQUETES. 

Mince the veal very fine, and season it with a 
little pepper, salt and mace; with the hands make 
it into balls the form of a pear, roll them in egg, and 
then in crumbs. Fry them in hot fat, and dish them 
on the large end ; place a stalk of parsley in the 
small end ; garnish with parsley. 

MINCE VEAL. 

Take cold roast or boiled veal, and chop it very 
fine; season it with pepper and salt. If you have 
any cold gravy, put it with it ; if not, butter will 
answer. Heat it very hot, stirring it often that the 
gravy may not oil ; serve it on slices of toasted 
bread, and garnish with lemon. 

A CALF'S HEAD. 

Soak a calf's head in cold water two hours, take 
out the brains, scrape the head very clean, flour a 
cloth, pin up the head very tight, and put it into six 
or eight quarts of water to boil with two pounds of 
salt pork. Tie up the brains in a piece of cloth 
separately. Let the head boil about two hours, then 
add the liver, lights and brains, and let it all boil 
two hours more. Remove the cloth, and the large

bones will come out very easily from the head; lay 
it on a dish with the skin side up; this is to be kept 
hot while making the gravy; then take a quart of 
the liquor that the head was boiled in, one third of 
the liver chopped very fine, the brains braided up 
with a spoon, a quarter of a pound of butter, two 
table-spoonsful of flour, pepper, salt, and sweet mar- 
joram. Put this together into a saucepan and let it 
boil ; then add two table-spoonsful of vinegar ; di- 
vide the liver and head, skin the tongue, and ky it 
on around the head on the dish ; put a part of the 
gravy over the head, and send the remainder to 
table in a gravy dish. Garnish your dish with 
scraped horseradish and lemon sliced. 

TO STEW A CALF'S HEAD. 

Boil the head, so that the large bones can be taken 
out with ease, but not enough for eating ; put some 
butter into a stewpan or baking kettle; when the 
butter is melted, put the jelly part of the head down 
with it, so as to brown it handsomely. Move it a 
little while cooking, lest it should stick to the bot- 
tom. Then turn over the head, dredge flour around 
the kettle enough to thicken the gravy, and let it 
brown a little; take about a quart of the liquor in 
which the head was boiled, and pour it on the head 
in the kettle ; put in half a tumbler of wine, red and 
white mixed together, a little sweet marjoram, some 
grated nutmeg, a little mace, a clove or two pounded, 



MEATS. 39 

a little cayenne, and a little black pepper and salt to 
your taste. With all these condiments season the 
gravy; then slice some of the liver and tongue 
which has been previously parboiled; stew all an 
hour or more, watching it constantly lest it stew too 
much. Garnish with egg balls, force-meat balls, 
and sliced lemon. The brains should be taken out 
and boiled separately from the head, and added just 
before serving it all up. 

CALF'S FEET. 

Boil about three hours in four quarts of water ; 
then take out the large bones, split the feet, and lay 
them into a saucepan ; shake in a little flour, two 
ounces of butter, a little pepper, salt, mace, half a 
teacup of white wine, a table-spoonful of vinegar, 
and two teacups of the liquor in which the feet were 
boiled. Simmer this all together about ten minutes, 
and send it to the table very hot, garnished with 
sliced lemon. 

The remainder of the liquor in which the feet 
were boiled may be used for jelly, as directed for 
calf's foot jelly. 

BAKED CALF'S LIVER. 

Lard it with fat pork, and put it into an iron pan 
with a pint of water or veal stock. Bake it three 
quarters of an hour, basting it frequently. Have 
prepared some maccaroni, well boiled in milk and 
water. Dish the liver, lay around the maccaroni, 



40 RECEIPTS. 

add to the gravy a piece of butter the size of an 
egg, a little flour, pepper, salt and soy. Boil it up 
once, and turn it over the dish. 

SWEET BREADS. 

Lard them with salt pork, and boil them in clear 
water about fifteen minutes; put them into cold 
water about ten minutes, and put them into a pan. 
Dredge in a little flour, about half a pint of hot 
water, very little mace, pepper, and salt; set them 
into the oven to brown about twenty minutes. Dish 
the sweet breads, add to the gravy a piece of butter 
about the size of an egg, and a little flour ; give it 
one boil, and turn it over the sweet breads hot. Gar- 
nish the dish with sliced lemon and parsley. 

VEAL OLIVES. 

Veal olives are made in the same manner as beef 
olives. 

ROAST LAMB. 

The fore quarter is much the best piece to roast. 
It should be roasted about one hour and a half, and 
frequently basted. To make the gravy, take all the 
dripping from the tin roaster, add a very little water, 
a little salt and flour, and give it one boil. 

MINT SAUCE, 

To serve with roast lamb. Take a bunch of green 
mint, and chop it very fine with a knife ; add a tea- 



MEATS. 41 

cup of fine brown sugar, and a teacup of sharp vine- 
gar. Stir this up, and send it to the table in a sauce- 
boat. 

A BOILED LEG OF LAMB. 

A common sized one should be boiled about an hour 
and a half; drawn butter and parsley to be served 
with it. 

LAMB CUTLETS AND CHOPS. 

Dressed in the same manner as mutton chops. 
(See page 33.) 

ROAST VENISON. 

A leg of venison weighing fourteen pounds should 
be roasted one hour if eaten on blazers ; if on hot 
plates, two hours. The dry skin should be taken off 
with the fingers, not with a knife. The spit should 
be turned very often. When half done, it should be 
basted with flour, butter, and red wine very fre- 
quently, until done. To make the gravy, take the 
shank of the venison, crack the bone, a pound of 
juicy beef, an onion stuck full of cloves, a little 
pepper and salt. Put it into a saucepan with two 
quarts of water, and boil it gently three hours. Strain 
this, and add to it the drippings from the venison, 
with nearly a quarter of a pound of butter; braid in 
two table-spoonsful of flour, a teacup of red wine, 
and a teacup of currant jelly. Stir it all up, and let 
it boil about five minutes. 



42 RECEIPTS. 

A SADDLE OF VENISON. 

A saddle of venison is much the best piece of the 
deer. It requires but half the time to roast this as it 
does the leg, for it is a much thinner piece. Dressed 
in the same manner as the leg. 

A YENISON STEAK. 

Cut steaks from the leg half an inch thick, broil 
them about five minutes; season with pepper, salt, 
and butter. If you have it, a cup of the roast veni- 
son gravy very hot is very nice poured over it; or 
half a cup of red wine, and half a cup of currant 
jelly, thickened with a little flour and butter, boiled 
up and turned over the steak. It should be served 
very hot. 

VENISON PIE. 

Take the breast and neck of venison, and cut it 
into small pieces. Season with pepper, salt, and a 
little ground cloves, and dredge it well with flour ; 
put it into the pie dish as close as possible, fill up the 
dish with some of the roast venison gravy, or gravy 
prepared in the same manner, and cover the dish 
with a nice crust. Bake it half an hour. 

ROAST PIG. 

Make a dressing of bread crumbs, a little salt, 
pepper, sage, sweet marjoram, an onion chopped 
fine, butter, two eggs, and a little salt pork, and fry 
this a little ; when cold, stuff the pig, sew it up, and 
then wash it in salt and water ; baste it often. A 



MEATS. 43 

pig weighing nine pounds requires four hours to 
roast it. 

A SPARE RIB OR CHINE OF PORK 

Is much nicer if rubbed over, before it is roasted, 
with a little pepper, salt, and fine sage. Take all 
the fat oat of the roaster when about half done, and 
then with the dripping make the gravy. 

FRIED PORK STEAKS. 

Fry a few slices of salt pork, take them out of the 
frying pan, dredge a little flour over the steaks, and 
a little pepper and salt ; fry them fifteen or twenty 
minutes slowly. Slices of apple fried in the fat are 
very nice to eat with the pork. 

FRIED PIGS' FEET. 

Make a batter with a little flour, water, a little 
salt, and one egg. Dip the feet in to cover them. 
Have your fat hot, and fry them until quite brown. 
Make a little drawn butter, and add a spoonful of 
vinegar to serve with them. 

pigs' head cheese. 

Boil a pig's head until the bone comes out, and 
chop this very fine ; pound about eight soft crackers 
very fine, and mix this up well ; add some sweet 
herbs, pepper, salt and spices. Put this into a mould, 
and press it for two or three days. It is very nice 
cut into thin slices, and eaten cold.

ROAST HAM. 

Spit a ham ; set it before a moderate fire to roast 
about two hours, turning the spit frequently; then 
take it up on to a dish, peal off the rind, scrape 
all the fat out of the roaster, put it to the fire 
to roast again about two hours more ; basting it 
frequently in the same way as for beef. To make 
the gravy, put the dripping from the roaster into a 
saucepan, add a cup of water, a little flour, and give 
it one boil. Served in a sauce tureen. 

A roasted ham is far superior to a boiled one. 

BOILED HAM. 

A ham should be put into cold water enough to 
more than cover it, and boiled gently. A ham weigh- 
ing fifteen pounds requires five hours' boiling. When 
about half done, and a part of the water has boiled 
away, add, if approved, a bottle of champagne, or a 
pint of good white wine vinegar; cover the pot close, 
to keep the flavor of the wine. 

An old ham should be laid in cold water over night.

ROAST TURKEY. 

A turkey should be well singed and cleaned of pin- 
feathers ; then draw the inwards. Be sure you take 
every thing out that is inside. Lay the turkey into 



POULTRY. 45 

cold water, clean the gizzards, liver, heart and neck ; 
let all soak one hour if you have time. Wash all very- 
clean, wipe the turkey very dry, inside and out. 
Make a dressing of two cups of bread crumbs, one 
tea-spoonful of salt, two large spoonsful of sweet 
marjoram, two spoonsful of butter, one egg, and mix 
them well together. Cut the skin of the turkey in 
the back part of the neck, that the breast may look 
plump ; fill the breast with the force meat, and sew 
it up. If you have any more force-meat than is 
required for the breast, put the remainder into the 
body, and skewer the vent ; tie the legs clown very 
tight, skewer the wings down to the sides, and turn 
the neck on to the back with a strong skewer. Baste 
with salt and water once, then frequently with butter; 
fifteen minutes before dishing, dredge with a little 
salt and flour, and baste with butter for the last time. 
This will give a fine frothy appearance, and add to 
the flavor of the turkey. 

To make the gravy, put the gizzard, neck, and 
liver into a saucepan with a quart of water, a 
little pepper, salt and mace ; put it on the fire, 
and let it boil to about a half pint. When done, 
braid up the liver very fine with a knife, put it back 
into the water it has boiled in ; then add the drip- 
pings of the turkey and a little flour, and give it one 
boil, stirring it all the time. Dish the gizzard with 
the turkey. Allow twelve minutes to a pound for 
the time to roast a turkey. 

A turkey weighing ten pounds requires two hours 



46 RECEIPTS. 

to roast with a clear fire, not too hot. Turn the spit 
very often. 

BOILED TURKEY 

Is dressed the same as for roasting, except in the 
dressing. Put in the pork chopped very fine, instead 
of butter. In trussing, turn the wings on the back, 
instead of the sides, as for roasting ; flour a cloth 
well, pin up the turkey tight, put it into boiling 
water where one or two pounds of salt pork have 
been boiling some time; let this boil with the turkey 
Dish the pork with the turkey on a separate dish 
with some parsley. Serve with oyster sauce. 

A turkey weighing eight pounds requires an hour 
and a half to boil. 

ROAST CHICKENS. 

Dress and roast the same as a turkey. A pair of 
chickens weighing six pounds requires an hour and 
a half to roast. Make the gravy the same as for a 
turkey, except the mace, which is to be omitted.

BOILED CHICKENS. 

Dressed and boiled the same as a turkey. Some 
cooks do not stuff boiled chickens or turkeys; but 
the dressing adds as much to the boiled as to the 
roast. Pork boiled with chickens is very necessary. 
A pair of chickens requires from one to two hours to 
boil, depending upon the size and age.

TO BONE, AND COOK A BONED TURKEY. 

Clean the turkey well, lay it on the table, have a 
small sharp-pointed knife; begin at the wing, pass 
the knife close to the bone, cut' the flesh from the 
bone, and keep the skin as whole as possible ; then 
pass the knife on each side of the breast, and then 
around the legs ; split the back about half way up, 
and draw out the bones. Have ready a stuffing 
made of the meat of a chicken chopped very fine, 
bread crumbs, pepper, salt, mace, sweet marjoram, a 
piece of butter, and two eggs, all well mixed up. 
Fill the turkey and sew it up, preserving the form. 
Have two calves' feet cracked up well, and the bones 
that have been taken out of the turkey put into a 
deep saucepan with one onion and one carrot cut 
very fine, mace, pepper, salt, and a few cloves. Lay 
the turkey on the bones, and add two quarts of 
water ; cover it tight, and let it simmer three hours, 
then take out the turkey, flour it and baste it well 
with butter, and set it in the oven to brown. If there 
is not one quart of gravy, add more water, and let it 
boil half an hour. , Beat up the whites and shells of 
two eggs, and stir into the gravy, and let it boil 
fifteen minutes; strain it through a cloth into a jelly 
mould. When the turkey is cold and the jelly is 
hard, dish the turkey with the jelly on the breast. 

This is considered a very nice supper dish. 

HASH TURKEY OR CHICKENS. 

Cut the meat from the bone, take off the skin, cut 
the meat into small pieces, put them into a saucepan

with a little pepper, salt, and if you have it a little 
cold gravy ; if not, put in a little butter and a cup 
of hot water. Dredge in a little flour, cover it very 
tight, and simmer it ten or fifteen minutes. Stir it 
frequently to prevent from frying. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

Cut the chicken into four quarters. Season them 
with pepper, salt, a little mace and sweet marjoram. 
Lay the chicken into the dish very close, dredge in 
some flour, a little butter in small bits, and a cupful 
of hot water (or veal stock) enough to fill the dish. 
Make a good paste crust, line the sides of the dish 
and rim, put in the chicken, cover it over with the 
crust, cut a hole in the top, and bake it half an hour. 
If the chickens are not very young, they should be 
boiled, half an hour after they are cut up, with some 
strips of pork. 

EAST INDIAN CURRY. 

Skin a chicken, cut it in small pieces, take two 
table-spoonsful of flour, and one of curry powder; 
stir them together dry, dip the chicken into it, and 
fry it a fine light brown. It may be fried in pork 
or butter; put it into a pot and pour over it boiling 
water enough to cover it ; let it boil slowly until 
tender. Mix the remainder of the flour, and curry 
with a little water, and put into the pot, and boil it 
a few minutes more ; salt to the taste.

WHOLE CHICKENS CURRIED. 

Put the chickens whole into a saucepan, with a 
little pepper, salt, and a few pieces of pork ; cover 
them with cold water. When about half done, add 
a cup of rice and a little more water if required. 
Let it boil until the chicken is quite tender, then put 
the chicken on a dish, and mix with the gravy a 
large spoonful of curry, stir it in well, and turn it 
over the chicken. 

CURRY CHICKEN. 

Cut the chicken into good shaped pieces, put it into 
a saucepan with a few little pieces of salt pork, an 
onion, and a little salt. Put in cold water enouah to 
cover it; let it simmer over the fire until the chick- 
en is very tender, and the water has simmered 
almost away ; then mix a table-spoonful of curry in 
a little water, stir this with the gravy, and let it stew 
with the chicken ten minutes. Have ready some rice 
boiled and formed in cups. Dish the chicken, take 
out. the onion, turn the gravy over the chicken, and 
lay the rice around the dish. 

FRICASSEE OF CHICKENS. 

Cut the chicken into good shaped pieces, wash and 
dry them well ; put into a deep frying-pan half a 
pound of butter, and put it over the fire until it melts. 
While it is quite hot, lay the chicken in to fry a 
little on both sides, then turn in a cup of boiling 
water, with a little flour, salt and pepper, cover it up

fifteen minutes. 

BROILED CHICKENS. 

Chickens to broil should be very young and small. 
Split them through the back, and skewer the legs 
and wings down firmly. Broil them twenty minutes 
slowly, and season them with salt and pepper, and 
plenty of butter. Send them to the table very hot. 

PILAFF. (A FAMOUS TURKISH DISH.) 

Take five cupsful of good beef stock, season it very 
well with pepper, salt, and a plenty of tomatoes ; add 
to it three cups of rice, set it on a moderate fire, 
and simmer it until the rice has absorbed the soup. 
Cut up a chicken, season it with pepper and salt, 
and fry it nicely in butter. Make a hole in the rice, 
put in the chicken, and cover it up in the rice. Melt 
half a pound of butter, do not let it oil, and turn it 
over the rice. Let it stand where it will keep hot 
about fifteen minutes, until the rice absorbs the 
butter, then turn it on the dish, but do not stir it up. 
Serve it very hot. 

ROAST GOOSE. 

Take a common goose, clean it well, and wash it 
the same as turkey. Make a dressing of six or eight 
potatoes well boiled and mashed, two onions chopped 
very fine, two tea-spoonsful of sage, one of salt, and 
one of pepper. Put it into the body of the goose, 
and sew it up. Roast it two hours; baste it in its 
own drippings. When about half done, turn off the 



POULTRY. 51 

fat from the roaster. The last drippings are suffi- 
cient for the gravy ; boil the liver, &c. as for turkey. 
The gravy is made the same as for a turkey. 

A MOUNTAIN GOOSE. 

Cleanse it the same as the turkey. Make a dress- 
ing of bread crumbs, one onion chopped very fine, 
two spoonsful of sage, pepper, salt, and a little pork 
chopped fine, and one egg. To roast a large goose, 
requires two hours' cooking. The gravy is made the 
same as for common goose. 

A MONGREL GOOSE 

Is dressed the same as the common goose, but as 
the mongrel has so much flavor, the dressing is 
unnecessary. Without dressing, an hour and a half 
will roast a large sized goose. 

WILD GOOSE. 

A wild goose should be roasted rare ; one hour's 
roasting is sufficient. Add a glass of red wine, and 
half a cup of currant jelly to the gravy, which* is 
made the same as for the common goose. Boil it to- 
gether, and send it to the table in a sauce tureen. 

ROAST DUCKS 

Are dressed in the same way as geese. A large 
pair of tame ducks require one hour to roast, black 
ducks half an hour, and canvass back twenty-five 
minutes. The gravy made the same as for goose. 

Wild ducks should be roasted after the soup is 
sent to the table.

PREPARING AND COOKING SMALL BIRDS. 

Some cooks do not take out the entrails of small 
birds ; but the flavor is much nicer to draw all out, 
excepting the heart and liver. This may be done by- 
making a small opening in the vent, and drawing 
very carefully. Wild birds should not lay in cold 
water to soak, but should be washed quickly and 
wiped dry. 

ROAST PARTRIDGES. 

Lard them well with fat pork ; tie the legs down 
to the rump, leaving the feet on ; while cooking, 
baste them well with butter. They require twenty- 
five or thirty minutes to cook. To make the gravy, 
put the drippings into a saucepan with a piece of 
butter about the size of an egg, and a little flour and 
hot water. Let it boil up once. 

For the bread sauce, see page 58. 

TO BOIL PARTRIDGES. 

Cut off the feet, and tie down the legs very closely ; 
boil them with a piece of pork twenty minutes. Serve 
them with parsley and butter, or bread sauce. 

The pork should boil one hour before the par- 
tridges are put into the pot. 

TO BROIL PARTRIDGES. 

Split them through the back, broil them fifteen 
minutes ; dish them with pepper, salt, and a little 
butter. A piece of salt pork broiled to eat with them 
is a very great improvement.

ROAST PIGEONS. 



Pigeons may be roasted with or without stuffing. 
If they are stuffed, the dressing should be made (for 
one dozen pigeons) with two cups of stale bread 
crumbs, two spoonsful of sweet marjoram, one of 
pepper, two of salt, one of ground cloves, one onion 
chopped fine, a little salt pork chopped, and one or 
two eggs. Mix this up well with the hands, stuff 
the bodies, sew them up, and truss them very 
tightly. Roast them half an hour, baste them with 
butter, and a strip of salt pork pinned on to the 
breast with a small needle. For the gravy, take 
the drippings, a cup of meat stock, a piece of 
butter with a little flour; put in half a glass of red 
wine, and half a tea-spoonful of cloves. Give it 
one boil. 

POTTED PIGEONS. 

Prepare them by the directions given for roasting ; 
lay five or six slices of salt pork in the bottom of the 
pot; chop an onion very fine, and fry it in the fat to 
a nice brown; then put the pigeons into the pot quite 
close, with a little pepper and salt, and shake in a 
little flour; turn in hot water, or brown stock enough 
to quite cover over the pigeons, and stew them gently 
one hour ; if the water boils away, add a little more. 
Split six crackers, dip them in cold water, cover 
the pigeons over with them, and stew them fifteen 
minutes longer. Dish them in a deep dish, and turn 
the gravy over them.

according to size and age. Line the sides of your 
pie dish with paste, lay the pigeons into the dish, and 
fill it up with the gravy. Shake in a little flour to 
thicken it, and put in a piece of butter if it is not 
rich enough. Cover it with a nice crust, and bake it 
about three quarters of an hour, until the crust is 
done. 

QUAILS. 

Tie the legs down to the rump with a strong 
thread, letting the feet be up. Dredge them with a 
little flour, baste them with butter, and roast them 
fifteen or twenty minutes. 

QUAIL PIE. 

Stew them in veal stock about ten minutes, take 
them out, thicken the gravy with a little flour and a

fill up the dish with gravy, and cover it with a nice 
paste. Bake it half an hour. 

WOODCOCK. 

Woodcock should be trussed with the bills running

sides of the dish, and cover it with a rich paste crust, 
and bake it half an hour. 

CHICKEN SALLAD. 

Boil chickens, turkey, or veal, remove all the skin 
and gristle, and chop it very fine. Cut heads of 
lettuce into quarters, and lay it into water with a 
piece of ice. Make the dressing by taking the yolks 
of two or three eggs, a table-spoonful of mixed mus- 
tard, a little cayenne pepper and salt, and stir this 
together with a large fork, on aflat dish; turn in 
gently, stirring all the time one way, half a bottle 
of sweet oil; add a little vinegar; turn in a little ■ 
more oil, stirring it up well. Put about half of the 
dressing with the meat, mix it up with a spoon, add 
a little more vinegar, put it into the centre of a flat 
dish, dry the lettuce in a napkin, and lay it neatly 
around the meat ; turn the remainder of the dress- 
ing over the lettuce. If made with celery, it should 
be slivered very fine, and laid into water with ice to

LOBSTER SALLAD 



Is made the same way as chicken sallad, only the 
lobster should be cut into small pieces, and not chop- 
ped. The row or coral of the lobster should be 
grated fine to garnish the dish.

AN EDGING FOR HASHES. 

Boil two teacups of rice half an hour, and sea- 
son it with a little butter and salt ; form the rice 
round a dish about three or four inches high, rub it 
over with the yolk of an egg, and set it in the oven 
to brown. When it is done, turn the hash into the 
middle of the dish. This makes a very handsome 
finish to a dish. 

Rice prepared in this way, spread over a pie made 
of cold meat, for the crust, an inch thick, and 
browned, is nice.

POTATO CRUST OR EDGING. 

Boil one dozen good potatoes, and mash them 
well. Add a piece of butter, a little salt, and half a 
cup of cream or milk. Stir it well with a large 
spoon, and form it the same as the rice. It is even 
better for a crust than rice. 

POTATO EDGING FOR TONGUE. 

Prepare the potato as above. Put it around the 
dish in lumps with a large spoon, and stick into each 
lump a sprig of parsley.

Take two quarts of oysters, wash them out of the 
liquor with the hands to get out all the grit, let the 
liquor stand and settle, then drain it into a saucepan, 
add a little mace, and set it to boil. Braid two 
spoonsful of flour into half a pound of butter ; stir 
this into the boiling liquor, and let it again boil up ; 
then put in the oysters and give it one boil. Serve it 
in an oyster dish. 

CELERY SAUCE. 

Take two or three heads of celery, cut it up fine, 
put it into a saucepan with about three pints of cold 
water, a little salt, and a few peppercorns. Boil it 
two hours. Braid into a quarter of a pound of but- 
ter a table-spoonful of flour, stir it in with half a 
teacup of cream, add the seasoning, and let it boil 
up well. 

BREAD SAUCE FOR PARTRIDGES.

quite soft; then strain the milk into a cup of stale 
bread crumbs, and let it stand one hour. Then put 
it into a saucepan with about two ounces of butter,

it all up together, and serve it in a sauce tureen. 

ANOTHER BREAD SAUCE. 

Take a large slice of stale bread boiled in milk 
and water, a little mace, pepper, and salt; when 
about half done, add a piece of butter and a glass of 
white wine. Let it boil up once. 



GARNISHING FOR DISHES. 59 

FISH SAUCE. 

Take half a pint of milk and cream together, two 
eggs well beaten, salt, and a little pepper, and the 
juice of half a lemon. Pat it over the fire, and stir 
it constantly until it begins to thicken. Serve it the 
same as drawn butter. 

LOBSTER SAUCE. 

Take out all the meat and the soft part from the 
body, cut it up very fine, and put it into a saucepan 
with a pint and a half of white stock. Braid into 
a quarter of a pound of butter a large spoonful of 
flour, stir it in, and add a little salt, pepper, and vin- 
egar. Give it one boil. Send it to the table in an 
oyster dish, as sauce for boiled fish. 

DRAWN BUTTER. 

Take half a pound of butter, braid into it two 
table-spoonsful of flour, put it into a saucepan, and 
add one teacup of boiling water ; set it on the fire, 
stirring it all the time until it almost boils. If it is 
to be served with boiled mutton, add two table- 
spoonsful of capers ; if it is for boiled chicken, add 
two tea-spoonsful of parsley, chopped fine ; if it is 
for boiled fish, add two eggs boiled hard and chop- 
ped fine; and if it is for fried fish, serve it plain. 

APPLE SAUCE. 

Peal, quarter, and core the apples 2 and throw 
them into cold water, rince them out, put them into 
a preserving kettle with a very little water, and 



60 RECEIPTS. 

cover them up tightly. Stew them until nearly done, 
then sprinkle in sugar enough to sweeten them to 
your taste. Cover it up tight again, and simmer 
them until done. Turn the kettle bottom upwards 
so as not to stir the apples and break them, as the 
sauce looks much better with the apples whole as 
possible. 

The time of cooking apple sauce depends upon 
the kind of apples used. Greenings cook much 
quicker than other kinds, and are the best kind 
for cooking. 

ANOTHER APPLE SAUCE. 

Put a pint of water, and a quarter of a pound of 
sugar into a saucepan; let it boil about ten minutes; 
put in as many apples pealed, cored and quartered 
as the syrup will cover when it boils up. Simmer 
until quite tender. The apples will be transparent, 
and if taken up carefully look very handsome. 

Apple sauce made in this way does not require 
any more sugar than when made in the common 
way ; it requires a little more care, and looks much 
handsomer. 

ANOTHER APPLE SAUCE. 

Put the apples into an earthen crock, with a hand- 
ful of sugar, a pint of cider and water, and cover it 
with a brown crust. Bake it in the oven three or 
four hours. If baked in a brick oven, let it remain 
all night. 



VEGETABLES. 61 

CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

Pick and wash the cranberries. Put them into 
the kettle or saucepan with a little water, and stew 
them about half an hour ; then stir them up, and 
add sugar enough to sweeten, stir it in, and cover 
it up tightly. Let it simmer fifteen minutes ; takeoff 
the cover and let it simmer a little longer, and turn 
it into an earthen jar. 

ANOTHER CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

Stew the cranberries forty minutes, strain them 
through a sieve, add sugar to your taste, and then 
give it one boil ; turn it into moulds. To take it out 
of the moulds, put it into hot water about a minute j 
then turn it out on a dish. 



VEGETABLES. 

TO BOIL POTATOES. 

Peal them, lay them into cold water two or three 
hours before you cook them ; put them into boiling 
water and boil them half an hour ; then drain off the 
water, sprinkle over them a little salt, give them a 
shake, put the cover half on, and let them stand 
while dishing dinner; take them up with a spoon. 



62 RECEIPTS. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Boil them as above directed, put them into an 
earthen pot, mash them very quickly with a potato 
masher, add a piece of butter, half a cup of cream, 
and a little salt. Beat this up very lightly with a 
spoon, put it in any form in tin plates, and rub them 
over with egg, and set them in the oven ten or fifteen 
minutes. 

FRICASSEE POTATOES. 

Take cold boiled potatoes, cut them into square 
pieces, put them into a saucepan with a little pepper 
and salt, dredge in a little flour, a teacup of drawn 
butter, a great deal of chopped parsley, and a little 
hot water. Let it simmer until it is very hot, stir- 
ring the pan very often. 

FRIED POTATOES. 

• Cut cold potatoes into slices, dredge on a little 
flour, pepper and salt, put them into the pan where 
sausages have been fried if you use potatoes that 
have not been cooked, cut them into thin slices, and 
pour boiling water over them ; let them stand while 
you fry a few slices of salt pork, wipe them dry, 
and fry as many at a time as will cover the bottom 
of the pan. 

All kinds of vegetables should be put into boiling 
water to cook. Every kind of vegetable, excepting 
green peas, should lay in cold water some time before 
cooking them. 



VEGETABLES. 63 

TO BOIL PEAS. 

Peas should be well picked over, but not washed, 
as in washing them that little sweet stem that con- 
nects the pea to the pod is lost; put them into boiling 
water, and boil them thirty minutes ; then drain 
them through a cullender, put them into a tin dish 
with a little butter and salt; stir them and keep them 
hot while dishing the meat. As peas grow older, 
they should be boiled longer; and when they are 
quite old, put a little saleratus into the water in 
which they are to be boiled. 

TO DRESS PEAS ANOTHER WAY. 

Put them into a saucepan, place it into another 
vessel of boiling water; put in a small piece of butter, 
salt, pepper, parsley, the heart of lettuce, and a little 
summer savory. About twenty minutes before dish- 
ing, add another piece of butter, and dredge in some 
flour and stir it. For sauce, take one egg, juice of a 
lemon, a very little salt, pepper, and a little milk ; 
stir it constantly until it thickens. After the peas 
are dished, pour the sauce over them. 

BEANS 

Require one hour to boil. They are dressed the 
same as peas. 

SQUASHES. 

They should boil one hour. Mash them with a 
potato masher, with a little butter and salt. Summer 
squash must be squeezed in a cloth instead of mashed. 



(J4 RECEIPTS. 

TO BOIL ASPARAGUS. 

Peal the tough skin off the white part, and tie it 
up in small bunches ; put it into boiling water, and 
boil it twenty minutes. Dish it on some slices of 
buttered toast; sprinkle on a little salt, and turn over 
a little drawn butter. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Half boil the asparagus, and take it off to drain ; 
cut it into small bits, and fry it in butter. Garnish 
a dish of veal cutlets, or mutton chop, with the as- 
paragus, laid around the dish in little lumps. 

EGG PLANT. 

Cut the plant in slices, sprinkle them with salt and 
pepper, then dip them in egg and crumbs, and fry 
them quite brown in a little butter. 

OYSTER PLANT. 

Scrape it clean, boil it one hour, take it into a pan 
and mash it with a potato masher. Season it with 
a little pepper and salt ; make it up into small cakes, 
about the size of the top of a teacup; flour them 
well, and fry them in butter. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Boil it one hour, cut it in thin slices, season it with 
pepper and salt, add a cup of cream and a little 
flour; put it in a saucepan, and let it stand on the 
fire to heat the cream, and dish it. 



VEGETABLES. 65 

MUSHROOMS. 

If they are old, turn on some boiling water, and 
let it stand five minutes ; if they are tender, this is 
unnecessary. Cut them in small pieces, put them in 
a saucepan, and let it boil ten minutes. Braid a little 
flour into a piece of butter, and stir it in the mush- 
rooms ; add a little pepper and salt, give it one boil, 
and serve it in an oyster dish. 

SPINAGE. 

Pick it clean, let it lay in cold water an hour, wash 
it out and boil it an hour and a half, then put it in a 
cullender to drain ; drop four eggs in boiling water, 
dish the spinage, and take the eggs out carefully so 
as not to break them ; lay them on the top of the 
spinage. 

ANOTHER MODE. 
Boil the spinage one hour, take it up and chop it 
very fine ; add pepper, salt, and a little piece of 
butter ; put it into a saucepan, and simmer it ten 
minutes ; toast some bread and butter it, and dish 
the spinage on the toast. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

Boil it one hour in water, and then add two cups 
of milk, and let it boil gently an hour longer. Dish 
it in a deep dish, and turn over it some drawn butter. 

CABBAGE. 

Boil it two hours. It is very nice, also, after it is 
boiled, chopped very fine, and fried in a little butter. 
When done, add a little vinegar, and stir it up.

TURNIPS AND PARSNIPS. 

Boil them an hour and a half, mash them the same 
as squash, or cut them in slices, and serve them 
plain. 

CARROTS. 

Boil them two hours, cut them lengthwise in 
slices, or dress them the same as potato fricassees, or 
serve plain. 

BEETS. 

Boil them three or four hours ; be careful not to 
cut them before boiling, as all the color will boil out; 
when they are boiled, lay them into cold water about 
five minutes, rub off the skin, and split them length- 
wise. 

Beets are very nice to make a sallad, if dressed 
the same as lettuce. 

TO BOIL RICE. 

Wash clean two cupsful of rice, put it into a pot 
with two quarts of water, and boil it quite tender; 
turn it into a cullender to drain, but do not stir it. 
Let it stand before the fire to dry about ten minutes. 
Every kernel of rice will be separate, drjr, and look 
very white. 

BAKED TOMATOES. 

Turn boiling water over them ; cover them up, 
and let them remain one hour ; then peal them, and 
lay as many as will cover the bottom of a pie dish ; 
season them with pepper and salt, and sprinkle fine 
bread crumbs over them, with some pieces of butter; 



MISCELLANEOUS. (57 

then put another layer of tomatoes, another season- 
ing, bread crumbs and butter, until the dish is filled. 
Bake it one hour. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Peal them and cut them, and put them into a sauce- 
pan; shake in a little flour, pepper, salt, and a little 
butter, and stew them two hours. Add sugar if 
liked. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Slice them, lay them in a dish, sprinkle a little salt 
over them, and let them stand two or three hours; 
there will be a bitter liquor, which must be drained 
from them. Take them out, and put them into a 
dish, with pepper, salt, and butter. Bake them one 
hour. 

TOMATOES RAW. 

Take raw tomatoes, slice them, and dress them 
with pepper, salt, and vinegar. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 

TO KEEP TOMATOES FOR WINTER. 

Pour boiling water on them, and let them stand 
one hour; peel them, take out what seeds you can 
without breaking them too much, and season them 



68 RECEIPTS. 

with pepper and salt. Stew them about half an 
hour, put them into stone jars, cover them with a 
piece of paper, and try out some very nice beef tallow. 
Strain it into the jars, put in a cork stopper while the 
fat is hot, that it may soak into the pores of the cork, 
and tie a bladder over it. This will keep a year. 
Put them in small jars, for after it is opened and ex- 
posed to the air it will not keep. 

When wanted for use, cook it the same as fresh 
tomatoes. 

TOMATO CATSUP. 

Take half a bushel of tomatoes, cut them in two, 
lay them in a dish, sprinkle a little salt over them, 
and let them stand three or four hours. Then drain 
off the water, and put the tomatoes into a preserving 
kettle with a pint of water ; let them stew two 
hours. Strain them through a cullender, put them 
back into the kettle, with half a teacup of salt, half 
an ounce of cayenne pepper, one ounce of cloves, 
one ounce of nutmeg, one of mace, and one quart of 
good white wine ; boil this one hour. When cold, 
bottle it and stop it tight. 

OMLET. 

Beat up six eggs ; mix a table-spoonful of flour 
in two of milk ; chop very fine half an onion, a little 
ham, a sprig of parsley, and add salt and pepper. 
Mix this all well together; put a bit of butter half 
the size of an egg into a frying-pan, heat it hot, 
turn in the mixture, stirring it all the time until it 



MISCELLANEOUS. 69 

begins to thicken. Then let it stand to brown three 
minutes, lap it half over, slip it on to a dish and 
send it to the table very hot. 

Omit the onion and ham, if preferred without it. 

TOMATO OMLET. 

Beat up six eggs, mix two table-spoonsful of flour 
in a little water, and add some salt and pepper. 
Peal and chop very fine four tomatoes ; stir this all 
together, and fry it the same as above directed. 

OYSTER OMLET. 

Prepare the omlet as above, chop a dozen oysters, 
and stir them into the eggs as before directed. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Beat up six eggs ; mix a spoonful of flour with a 
little milk ; stir it into the egg and season it with 
pepper, salt, and a little chopped parsley. Heat the 
griddle, rub it with butter, turn on the mixture very 
thin. When a little hardened, roll it up, and send 
it to the table very hot. 

DROPPED EGGS. 

Have ready a pan of boiling water, and break the 
eggs, holding it very close to the water. Drop in 
very slowly, that the yolk may not break. With a 
large spoon dip the boiling water over the yolk 
until the white forms a skim over it, and take out 
the egg with an egg slice, half a dozen in a dish. It 



70 RECEIPTS. 

is a very pretty dish dressed with parsley; or dished 
on butter toast they are very nice. 

HARD SCRABBLE. 

Beat up six eggs, season it with a little pepper and 
salt, put a piece of butter into the frying-pan. When 
it is very hot turn in the egg, stir it until it thickens, 
and serve it very hot. 

FRIED HAM AND EGGS. 

Fry the ham, dish it, turn the fat out of the pan, 
wipe out the pan, drain the fat into it, leaving the 
sediments; add some good lard to it, and let it get 
boiling hot. Drop the eggs the same as above, and 
dish them around the ham. 

TO MAKE MILK TOAST. 

Put half a pound of butter into a tin toast-pan, 
dredge on a little flour, rub it in with a spoon, 
turn on a tea-cupful of boiling water, stirring it 
all the time ; then add three gills of milk or cream, 
and stir it until it boils up once. Toast the bread 
a light brown, dip it while it is hot, one piece at a 
time, lay them in the dish, and over each piece put 
a large spoonful of the dip. When the dish is filled, 
pour the dip over the whole. 

SOFT SPREAD TOAST. 

Toast the bread, and spread it while it is hot. 
Have ready half a pint of hot milk or water, dip 



MISCELLANEOUS. 71 

the toast in very quickly that it may not soak too 
much, but merely to moisten it. 

Dry toast should never be laid one slice upon 
another, but set on the edge, to keep it dry. 

TO MAKE COFFEE. 

The coffee should be dried in the oven with the 
door open one or two hours before roasting. When 
it is ready to roast, set it on the fire in an iron pan, 
and stir it constantly until it becomes a light brown. 
To two pounds of coffee add a bit of butter about 
the size of a walnut three minutes before taking it 
from the fire. Coffee is much better, when it is 
roasted, ground, and made within one hour. One 
cup of ground coffee will make one quart of coffee. 
To make coffee in a biggin, put the ground coffee 
into the filter, wet it with cold water, and let it stand 
five minutes to swell. Put the filter into the pot 
where it belongs; fill it up with boiling water and 
set it where it will keep hot, but not boil. When 
this has run through, add water until you have 
made a quart of coffee. It does not require more 
than ten minutes to make good coffee. 

To boil coffee, put into a coffee-pot one cup of 
ground coffee, and stir in one egg, or a piece of salt- 
fish skin two inches square ; add one quart of water. 
Boil it ten minutes, take it off, turn a cupful out at 
the spout, and back again into the pot. Let it stand 
ten minutes. Turn it off into another pot to send to 
table. Boiled cream or milk should always be 
served with coffee. 



72 RECEIPTS. 

TO MAKE TEA. 

Scald the teapot, put in the tea while the pot is 
hot, turn in just water enough to wet the tea, and 
let it stand about five minutes ; then fill up the tea- 
pot with boiling water. 

TO MAKE SHELLS OR COCOA. 

They require two or three hours to boil. Some 
persons like cocoa roasted and pounded before boil- 
ing it. 

CHOCOLATE. 

To a quarter of a pound of chocolate add two 
quarts of water, stirring it frequently until it is dis- 
solved ; give it one boil, then add one pint of cream 
or one quart of milk, and give it one more boil. 
Sweeten it to your taste. 



PASTRY. 



RICH PUFF PASTE. 



To one pound of flour, allow one pound of butter. 
Wash the butter in cold water, divide it into three 
parts, make it into thin cakes, and lay them on the ice 
to harden. Sift the flour, take one cake of the butter 
and rub it well into the flour, mix it up lightly with 
the hands with cold ice water, sprinkle a little flour 



PASTRY. 73 

on the paste board, and roll the crust out very thin, 
rolling from you always. Be careful not to break 
the crust with the rolling pin. Roll out one cake 
of butter as thin as possible, lay it on the paste, 
dredge on a little flour, roll up the paste, then roll it 
out thin again ; roll out the other cake of butter, lay 
it on the paste, dredge on a little more flour, and 
roll it up again. Cut it into as many pieces as re- 
quired. For edging, roll out a piece as long as will 
go around the plate without piecing, as it looks much 
better. The edging should be three or four layers of 
paste rolled very thin, and put on the rim of the 
plate. Use sifted flour to dredge on the paste board, 
and to roll the butter and paste together. This 
flour is included in the weight of the flour for the 
paste. 

COMMON PASTE. 

Take one pound of flour, and three quarters of a 
pound of butter ; sift the flour on the paste board ; 
take two thirds of the butter, cut it with a knife into 
the flour, mix it up with just ice water enough to 
stick the flour and butter together, and roll it out 
about an inch thick; put the rest of the butter on 
the paste, dredge on some flour, roll up the paste, 
flour the board and roll out the paste again smooth, 
and then roll it up again. 

This is a very good paste to line the plates with, 
and use the puff paste for the edging and upper 
crust. 



74 RECEIPTS. 

A VERY GOOD COMMON PASTE. 

To a pound of flour, take half a pound of butter 
and a quarter of a pound of lard, (this is best in 
winter,) or half butter and half lard, allowing a 
pound of flour to three quarters of a pound of short- 
ening. Mix the lard and a little salt with the flour 
very lightly and quickly with ice water, flour the 
board, roll out the paste about a quarter of an inch 
thick ; put half the butter on with a knife in little 
bits, dredge on a plenty of flour, roll up the paste, 
then roll it out again, put the other half of the but- 
ter on the same as before, and again roll it up. This 
is a very nice crust for meat pie. 

APPLE PIE. 

In the fall of the year, when apples are very juicy, 
they make nice pies without stewing. Cut them 
thin, line a deep plate with crust, put in a layer of 
apple, some good brown sugar, a little mace or cin- 
namon, grated lemon peel, and a very small piece of 
butter; then another layer of apples and seasoning, 
cover it with a good paste, and bake it in a moderate 
oven. After the top crust is done, let it stand in the 
oven with the door open fifteen minutes. 

A NICE APPLE PIE. 

Peal, quarter and core about eight apples, to make 
two large plate pies, and put them into a saucepan 
with a very little hot water. Let them stew until 



PASTRY. 75 

they are quite soft, and then turn them into a dish 
to cool. While they are hot, add a piece of butter 
about half the size of an egg, a little mace, the rind 
of a lemon grated, half a glass of wine, and sugar 
to the taste. Let it get quite cold, line flat tin plates 
with a good crust, fill them with the apple, and put 
on a rim and upper crust of puff paste. 

A VERY NICE APPLE PIE, OR TART. 

Halve and core about ten good greening apples, 
put into a saucepan three cups of white sugar, 
one lemon sliced, a little mace, and a large cup 
of water. Let this boil up. Then lay in the apples 
carefully, and let them simmer until they are tender 
and clear; take them out on a dish with a spoon, 
keeping them as whole as possible ; let the liquor 
boil away until there is only enough juice left for 
the pies, line the plates with crust, and lay in the 
apples carefully. Add a glass of wine to the juice, 
put a double edge of puff paste around the rim of 
the plate, turn in the juice, and brush over the 
paste and the apple with the white of an egg, and 
sift a little fine sugar over it. Bake it until the crust 
is done. 

RHUBARB TARTS. 

Peal and cut the rhubarb into small pieces, and 
put them into a saucepan with a little sugar. Stew 
it until it is tender. Put it in a flat dish, and add 



76 RECEIPTS. 

more sugar, a little butter, mace, or cinnamon. Line 
some small tin plates with paste, put a rim of puff 
paste, and fill them with the rhubarb. Strips across 
the top add to the appearance of tarts. Bake them 
until the crust is done. 

GOOSEBERRY PIES OR TARTS. 

Pick off all the stalks and little blossoms, and 
make the pies the same as the rhubarb. For the 
tarts, the gooseberries should be strained through a 
coarse sieve. The seasoning should be put in while 
the fruit is hot, but the fruit should be perfectly cold 
when put on the paste. 

MINCE PIE. 

Boil a beef tongue weighing six pounds, and what 
is called the vein of a round of beef weighing six 
pounds, six hours; then skin the tongue, and chop 
the beef and tongue very fine; add five pounds of 
beef suet chopped very fine, five pounds of stoned 
raisins, three pounds of dried currants, a pound and 
a half of citron in small thin pieces, four pounds of 
brown sugar, one pint of good molasses, one quart 
of brandy, one quart of white wine, half a cup each 
of salt, cinnamon, allspice and cloves, three nut- 
megs, and a table-spoonful of mace. Put this all 
into a large pan, mix it well together with the hands, 
and let it stand over night. What you wish to bake 
take into another pan, and add one half as much 
fine-chopped apples as you have meat. Mix it up 



PASTRY. 77 

well, and let it stand an hour. If it is not quite 
sweet enough, add as much sugar as required, and 
a little more wine. Put the remainder of the meat 
into a jar for future use, and turn on a little brandy. 
Cover it tight to keep the air from it. This not only- 
keeps well, but is better than when it is first made. 
When more is required for use, the proportion of 
chopped apples, &c. to be added, as named above, 
with wine to moisten the meat. Champagne wine 
may be used if preferred. 

PEACH PIE. 

Peal and cut into thin slices the peaches, roll out 
the paste quite thin, line the plate with it, and fill it 
half full with the peaches. Add a cup of sugar; 
then fill the plate with peaches and a little more 
sugar, cover it with a puff paste, and bake it three 
quarters of an hour. 

ANOTHER PEACH PIE. 

Peal the peaches, cut them in halves, and put 
them into a saucepan with a very little water and 
sugar, and let it simmer until the peaches are tender. 
Let them cool, add a little more sugar to the juice, 
and let it simmer until it thickens. Line a plate 
with paste, lay in the pieces, and turn the juice over 
them. Put on a rim of rich puff paste, and cover it 
or not with some of the same paste. Bake it twenty 
minutes. 



78 RECEIPTS. 

BLACKBERRY OR WHORTLEBERRY PIE. 

Line a deep plate with paste, fill it half full with 
berries, and add half a cup of sugar, a small piece 
of butter, and a little cinnamon; fill up the plate 
with berries and a little more sugar, and cover it 
with a good paste. Bake it one hour. A few cur- 
rants improve the pie. 

CURRANT PIE OR TART. 

Stew the currants a few minutes, strain them 
through a sieve, and season them with plenty of 
sugar while hot, and set them away to cool. Line 
small plates with puff paste, fill them with the cur- 
rants, and bake them until the crust is done. 

CRANBERRY TARTS. 

Stew the cranberries with a very little water 
until they are well done, strain them through a 
sieve. Season them with a plenty of sugar while 
hot, add a little spice if to the taste, and let it get 
quite cool. Line small plates with a puff paste, and 
put a rim on of the same; fill the plates, and bake 
them until the crust is done. 

TARTS OF PRESERVED FRUIT. 

Line small plates with a rich crust, make a rim of 
puff paste, and bake it ten or fifteen minutes, until 
the paste is quite done ; then fill them with any kind 
of preserved fruit ; brush them over with the white 



PASTRY. 79 

of an egg, sift on a little white sugar, and set them 
in the oven about three minutes. 

PASTE PUFFS. 

Roll out a rich paste, and cut them with a biscuit 
cutter ; lay them on a tin sheet, cut a rich puff paste 
the same size, cut a hole with a small wine-glass, 
making a rim half an inch thick, and bake them 
until quite done. Just before sending them to the 
table, fill them with preserves of any kind. 

Paste looks much nicer if beat-up egg is brushed 
over it with a paste brush, and white sugar sifted on 
just before it is set into the oven. If it is to be very 
light colored, use only the white of the egg, and 
omit the sugar. 

LEMON PIE. 

Grate the rind off two lemons, peal off the white 
skin, chop the lemon up fine, add two cups of sugar, 
beat up two eggs, and stir it all together. Roll out 
thin a rich paste, line a tin plate with it, and fill it

calf's foot jelly. 

Soak in cold water two hours four large feet, put 
them into six quarts of water and boil them six 
hours, when it will be reduced to three quarts or a 
little less. Then strain it through a sieve into a 
stone jar ; the next day take off the fat, take the 
jelly out of the jar, and take off the sediment from 
the bottom. Put the jelly into a preserving kettle, 
add a pound of loaf sugar, one pint and a half of 
good old Madeira wine, a tea-cupful of brandy, three 
lemons cut up and the seeds taken out, the whites of 
six or seven eggs beat to a froth, a very little saffron, 
and a few cloves. Stir this all up together, and set 
it on the fire; throw in the egg shells, stir it fre- 
quently, and boil it twenty minutes. Then take it 
off the fire, and set it where it will keep hot without 
boiling, turn in a cup of cold water, and let it stand 
fifteen minutes. Have ready the jelly stand and 
flannel bag. Put over the top a thin towel, dip the 
jelly into it, it will strain through and be as clear as 
amber, unless it is too thick. If so, turn it all into 
the kettle, add a little more water and the white of 
two eggs, and strain it as before stated. This may 
be put into moulds hot, or in glasses when it is cold. 

In the winter, when calves' feet are very costly, 
use the shins of veal. Two shins, well soaked in 



96 RECEIPTS. 

cold water two or three hours, will make the same 
quantity as above. When this is done, it will make 
two quarts of jelly. 

Pigs' feet, well cleansed, make quite as handsome 
a jelly as calves' feet, and looks more glassy. Four 
feet will make at least three pints when it is done. 
Make it the same as calf's foot jelly.

of seven eggs thoroughly ) and add it to the rest. Let 
all this stand in a bowl or pitcher, with ice around 
it, till it is quite stiff; then put it into the moulds, 
which must first be lined with sponge fingers. Keep 
it cold until you need it for use. It takes nearly a 
dozen and a half of sponge cakes to line it.

and flavor it with any flavor that is agreeable to the 
taste. Freeze it the same as ice cream. 

ROMAN PUNCH.

lemon flavor, as for ice cream. It should be very 
strongly flavored, as in freezing it diminishes one 
half. 

DIRECTIONS FOR FREEZING ICE CREAMS, WATER 

ICES, &o. 

Break the ice in small pieces, say about the size 
of an egg, or smaller, and put some in the bottom of 
a tub; set the kettle in; then put in about a quart 
of coarse rock salt ; then two quarts of ice ; and so 
on until the tub is filled up to the top of the kettle. 
Stir it until the cream is frozen. In the old-fashioned 
freezer you must take off the cover frequently, and 
scrape off the cream from the sides until it freezes 
evenly. 

If it is to be put into moulds, fill them quite full, 
shut them very tight, and put them in the ice and 
salt, covering them entirely; then throw over a piece 



CAKE. 107 

of carpet to keep the air out. To take them out 
of the mould, have your dish ready, wipe the mould, 
and then turn over it some boiling water, wiping it 
again very quickly ; then turn it on the dish. Re- 
move the mould very slowly, for fear of breaking. 
When pure essences can be procured, they are quite 
equal to fresh fruits to flavor with. 

N. B. — Good and pure Essences and Syrups may 
be obtained at Messrs. Smith & Melvin's, at 325 
Washington street, Boston, who manufacture the 
above-named articles expressly for retailing, and

the cover remain for the bottom of the cake. The 
above named quantity will make two small loaves, 
or one very large loaf. Fill the box two thirds full ; 
it requires about four hours to bake. Try it with a

and core the quinces, weigh a pound of crushed 
sugar to a pound of quinces, put the peals and cores 
into a kettle with just water enough to cover them. 
Let this simmer about two hours, then strain the 
liquor, put it back into the kettle, and put in as 
many quinces as the liquor will cover, boil them 
until they are tender, take them out and put them on 
a flat dish to cool ; put in more until all are boiled, 
then put the sugar in, and let it boil until it becomes 
a syrup ; then put in as many quinces as the syrup 
will cover, let them boil about thirty minutes, put 
them on a flat dish to cool, and then more until they 
are all boiled ; then boil the syrup until all the water

put the peaches into a preserving kettle, and turn on 
boiling water enough to just cover them, and let 
them boil ten minutes. Take them out carefully on 
a flat dish to cool, then peel them with your fingers, 
to keep the shape ; take a little of the water that 
they were boiled in, add the sugar, and let it boil 
until it becomes a syrup. Put in a few peaches at a 
time, so as not to crowd them; when they are done 
put them on a dish to cool. Lay them carefully into 
a jar, boil the syrup a few minutes after the peaches 
are done, and strain it hot over the peaches.

stiffen in five minutes. Then strain it through a 
very fine sieve into small glass jars. Set them in 
the sun two days. Put a piece of paper wet in 
brandy on the top, and over this a bladder, and tie 
them up. 

PINEAPPLE. 

Peel the pineapple, and cut it in slices about a 
quarter of an inch thick; take a pound of sugar to 
a pound of fruit ; sprinkle the sugar over the apple, 
and let it stand until the next day. Then put it into 
the kettle, and boil it until the apple looks clear. 
Take out the apple to cool. Give the syrup one boil, 
and then strain it through a hair sieve on the fruit. 



PRESERVES. 123 



PINEAPPLE JAM. 

Peel the apple and weigh it, a pound to a pound 
of sugar; grate the apple on a coarse grater, .put the 
apple and sugar in the kettle together, and let it boil 
thirty or forty minutes. 

STRAWBERRIES. 

Weigh one pound of sugar to a pound of fruit; 
put the sugar into the kettle with just water enough 
to prevent its burning, boil to a syrup ; then put in 
as many strawberries at a time as will cover the top 
of the syrup without crowding them, and let them 
boil twenty minutes. Take them out carefully, so 
as not to break them, and put them in a dish to cool 
separately. When cold, put them into glass jars, and 
strain the hot syrup through a hair sieve on to them. 

The Hovey Seedlings are the best to preserve in 
this manner, as they are very large. If however 
they get broken, it would be better to put them back 
into the kettle and boil them thirty minutes for jam. 

ANOTHER WAY TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES. 

Weigh a pound of fine loaf sugar to a pound of 
fruit, sprinkle the sugar over the fruit, and let it 
stand over night. The next day strain off the syrup 
and boil it about ten minutes; then put in the fruit, 
and let it boil gently twenty minutes more. Skim 
out the fruit on a flat dish to cool. When cool, put 
them in jars, add the syrup, and tie them up tight, 
with paper dipped in brandy, and a bladder over it.

CODDLED APPLES. 

Peel the apples, leaving the stems on, and put as 
many as will stand into the preserving kettle or 
saucepan; put in a little water, and let them boil 
until they are tender. Take them out carefully. 
Allow a cup of sugar to three apples, put it into the 
water that they were boiled in, and boil it ten min- 
utes. Pea] a lemon very thin in very narrow strips, 
lay them around the stem of the apple, put them 
into the syrup, and boil them until they are clear. 
Put them into the dish in which you send them to 
the table, and pour the syrup on them. These will 
not keep more than three or four days. 

PEARS. 

Peel the pears, boil them in water until they 
are quite tender, and then take them out on a dish 
to cool. Make a syrup of white sugar. A few 
pieces of ginger and a slice of lemon make a nice 
flavor to the syrup. Put in the pears, and boil them 
gently until they are quite clear ; the time depends 
on the size ; if they are small, they require about 
thirty minutes. If to keep all winter, allow a pound 
of sugar to a pound of fruit. 

STEWED PEARS. 

Take large honeyed pears, and peel, core and 
quarter them. Take two quarts of the pears, a pint 
bowl of sugar, a pint of water, and put all this into 
a preserving kettle or saucepan. Cover it tight, and 
stew gently one hour.

piece taken out, tie them up tight, prepare them the 
same as cucumbers, only they should remain in the 
salt and water forty-eight hours instead of twenty- 
four. 



USEFUL HINTS. 

Pieces of stale bread should be kept clean and dry. 
Every two or three days put all the small pieces you 
have on a tin sheet, and set it in the oven with the 
door open to dry. When very dry, pound them fine, 
and sift them through a coarse sieve or fine cullender. 
The fine crumbs are good to use in frying ; the 
coarse ones" are good for puddings. The soft part 
of pieces of bread should be used for dressing for 
meats, which would save cutting a whole loaf for 
that purpose. If care is taken of the pieces of bread 
in a family, a great saving may be made, for bread 
is a large item in family expenses. Soft crackers 
pounded make the best crumbs to use in frying, also 
in scalloping oysters. 

The drippings of beef and pork, clarified, is very 
nice to fry in, instead of lard or butter. To clarify 
it, put the drippings into an iron pot ; to a quart of 
fat allow half a pint of cold water ; let it boil until 



• USEFUL HINTS. 131 

the water is boiled out, which may be known by its 
not bubbling. When the water has evaporated, 
strain it into an earthen pot, and keep it in a cool 
place for use. 

The fat from soup stock, and all other fat that 
with proper care accumulates in a kitchen, may be 
used for making soft soap with but very little 
trouble, and a great saving may be made thereby, 
as it is much better than the soap that you get in 
exchange for your house grease. 

To make Soft Soap. — Take seventeen pounds of 
potash to twenty of grease ; lay the potash at the 
bottom of the barrel ; boil the grease, and pour it 
on ; put in two pailsful of scalding water, and stir 
it all together. Fill up the barrel the next morning 
with cold water, stir it up from time to time, and in 
three days it will be fit for use.
