UBRART 

The Third Edition of the Conservation Recipes 

is published in order to meet, as far as possible, the 

needs of the housewife in conforming strictly to the 

latest rulings of the Food Administration. 

The following ration is given as a guide only. 
It must vary from time to time as the food situa- 
tion changes. Be alert and watch for all Food 
Conservation reports and be guided intelligently by 
them. If there is less need of saving certain com- 
modities in some sections of the country because of 
local conditions, the general rule still holds that 
"Food will win the War." And since that state- 
ment is as true now as when it first startled us with 
its significance, don't waste it, nor use more of it 
than is necessary for normal health.

CONSERVATION RECIPES SUGGESTIONS 

SUGGESTIONS FOR MENUS 

Plan meals as if there were no bread to be had and let 
one of the starchy foods take its place. If fruit, oatmeal, and 
eggs are served for breakfast, substitute barley pancakes, for 
example, for toast. 

For dinner, potatoes, rice, etc., must be made to take the 
place of bread, if the need of bread is felt. Since we have 
the fancy for handling some of our food, make a point of 
serving such articles of diet as potato chips, French-fried 
potatoes, or anything else your ingenuity may devise. 

BREAKFASTS 

1. — Use non-wheat cereals. Oatmeal, cornmeal, cream of bar- 
ley or cream of rice, corn flakes, puffed rice, and others 
give variety. 

2. — Non-wheat pancakes, muffins and biscuits may take the 
place of toast. Use buckwheat, cornmeal, barley and rice 
flour, potato and corn starch. 

3. — Use fruits — bananas and other fresh fruits ; and preserved 
and dried fruits may be served either alone or with the 
cereal. Fresh fruits help supply bulk. Dried fruits sup- 
ply sugar; use these natural sugars freely. 

4. — Use potatoes whenever possible. Try cornbeef or other 
meat hash with poached eggs. Try fish and potato balls ; 
or serve with potatoes creamed or broiled salt fish. 

5. — Use milk freely. Instead of buying cream, remove it 
from the bottle with a Chapin dipper. (There will still 
be some cream in the milk, but even thoroughly skimmed 
milk is nourishing.) 

Various combinations of the above will give all the varie- 
ty necessary. 

DINNERS 

Use no breads except non-wheat breads such as corn 
bread, and then only occasionally. 

1.— Substitute various hot starchy foods such as potatoes, 



5 
SUGGESTIONS CONSERVATION RECIPES 

rice, sweet potatoes, squash or pumpkin. Dried peas and 
beans supply both fuel and body-building materials. Rice, 
hulled corn, and hominy will take the place of bread and 
macaroni. 

2. — Vegetables — provide plenty of fresh vegetables if possible. 
Use these freely also in cream soups, and combine them 
with rice or barley in meat broths. Serve popcorn, puffed 
rice, oat or corn meal crackers with the soup, if neces- 
sary. 

3. — Salads — Vegetable and Fruit. Serve with vegetable 
salad potato chips or hot French-fried potatoes. With a 
generous fruit salad the dinner may be so planned that 
no dessert will be necessary. 

4. — Use meat, except ham and bacon, until further notice. 
But the freer use of fish, eggs, nuts, and cheese is to be 
commended. 

4. — Use starchy desserts such as rice, tapioca, and cornstarch 
puddings either with or without eggs. Serve these with 
fruits or fruit sauces. Serve custards and junket with 
fruit syrups. 

6. — Use non-wheat cakes, cookies, and pastries. 



SCHOOL LUNCHES 

1. — Use as little bread as possible. Non-wheat muffins and 
biscuits, firm and well baked, may be used for sandwiches. 

2. — Potato chips are desirable. 

3. — Potato salad or artichokes may be folded in lettuce leaves 
and wrapped in waxed paper. 

4. — Popcorn balls, nuts, raisins, oatmeal or other non-wheat 
wafers, war cake, and such candies as chocolate nuts and 
raisins, molasses candy, and fruit pastes will afford suffi- 
cient variety. 

5. — Fruits: Bananas, oranges, apples or other fruits in sea- 
son. 

A fuller development of these suggestions will be found 
under their appropriate headings.

CONSERVATION RFXIPES FOOD GROUPS 

A GUIDE IN THE SELECTION OF FOOD FOR THE 

USE OF HOUSEWIVES IN 

MAKING MENUS 

SUITABLE FOR EVERY DAY IN THE YEAR 

Make sure that all the groups are well represented daily. 
If more variety is desired use one or more foods from each 
group in each meal. (Except for flavor, group 4, sugar, may 
be omitted). Make sure that group 1 and group 2 are both 
present. Groups 3, 4 and 5 are all fuel foods. Let group 3 
furnish the basis. 

Take from all groups but use sparingly the foods in the 
left-hand column. When one food is omitted or decreased in 
quantity, use a substitute from the same group. 



FOOD GROUPS 



GROUP 1 

Fruits and vegetables. Food depended upon for mineral 
matters, vegetable acids, and body-regulating substances. Al- 
so supplies bulk. Use liberally in all three meals. Favor 
local products. 

GROUP 2 

Meat and meat substitutes. Protein rich foods. Materials 
for growth and daily repair of tissue. Except in the case of 
milk for children the amount required is not large. 

SAVE USE 

Pork Fish, shell fish 

Ham Poultry, game, (rabbit, hare) 

Bacon Eggs 

Beef Milk, skim milk. Use milk

SOUPS CONSERVATION RECIPES 

SOUPS 

Mrs. N. C. Robson, Editor. 

All kinds of left over meats may be utilized in making 
soup stock, and an average sized family should always be 
able to have a supply without buying fresh meat. 

Clear soups have very little nutritive value, but are useful 
as an aid to digestion. 

Appetizing soups can be made from left over vetegables, 
and the water in which other vegetables have been cooked, 
and seasoned with tomato, onion, celery, okra, parsley, thyme. 

To color soups brown use caramel, browned flour, onions 
fried brown, kitchen bouquet or beef extract. 

Stock made without bone or gristle will not jelly. 

Thickenings are made with either white, barley or potato 
flour, cornstarch, minute tapioca, rice, or left over cereal. 

The meat which is left after cooking retains the nutritive 
qualities, but must be made palatable by other seasoning as 
the juices have gone into the soup stock. 

Save all gravies for your soup kettle. 

Vegetable soups can be made without milk or meat, and a 
rich flavor imparted by using browned barley flour thicken- 
ing. Broken scraps of bone which have been browned may be 
simmered in the vegetable water for additional flavoring. 

Instead of draining asparagus, squash, carrots, corn, pota- 
toes, parsnips, turnips, cabbage, celery, cauliflower, onions, 
peas or beans into the sink, drain into a bowl and every 
second day make resulting mixture into clear soup. Add 
water, milk — or both if you have it — a little rice, cooked 
barley or tapioca. Add the water from rice to make thick 
soup. Press the left over vegetables through a colander and 
add to the clear vegetable stock. Serve with popcorn or 
puffed rice. 

Vegetables when used raw as a seasoning give a strong 
flavor, and only a little of each should be used. For flavor- 
ing soups, sauces, stews, etc., fried vegetables are far superior 
to the raw. 

To prepare them for use, clean and peel or scrape the 
vegetables, then cut them into small pieces and put in a 



10 

CONSERVATION RECIPES SOUPS 

saucepan with butter substitute or sweet fat, allowing two 
generous tablespoonfuls of fat to a pint of vegetables. Place 
on the stove and stir until the vegetables become hot. Par- 
tially cover the saucepan and cook slowly for half an hour, 
stirring the contents frequently until the fat begins to sepa- 
rate from the vegetables. Drain and save the fat for future 
use. Add the vegetables to the dish they are to flavor. 

Chicken fat is excellent as a butter substitute in both 
meat and cream soups. Oleomargarine is also good.

54 cup oil. 1 piece of celery. 

34 cup onion. 1 cup canned tomatoes. 
1 clove garlic. 

Soak the beans over night. Boil until tender. Many 
cooks put the beans to cook in cold water with a pinch of 
soda. When they come to a boil pour off this water and add 
fresh. Chop the onion, garlic, parsley, and celery fine and put 
them to fry in the oil with salt and a generous amount of 
pepper. When the vegetables are a delicate brown, add to 
them two cups of the broth from the beans and the tomatoes. 
Let it boil a moment and pour the mixture into the kettle of 
beans from which some of the water has been drained, if 
they are very liquid. This soup may be served as it is or 
with cheese if preferred. Add the cheese just before serving.

the fat until they are a uniform brown, using a kettle deep 
enough to hold the water afterwards. When the onions are 
thoroughly fried add the hot water, cover and let simmer at 
least three-quarters of an hour, seasoning to taste. The 
onions will make a clear brown liquor without the use of any 
meat stock, but soup stock may be used instead of water, or 
beef extract or buillon cubes may be added to the water if a 
meat stock is preferred.

1 pt. water. 2 tblsp. cornstarch. 

1 pt. milk. 2 tblsp. butter. 

2 cups of vegetable, any kind. Salt and pepper. 
1 small onion. 

Milk soups are both appetizing and nutritious. The basis 
of all is milk, thickened and seasoned by the addition of veg- 
etables boiled, and pressed through a sieve. 

Milk soup with thickening of cornstarch, potato starch, 
barley flour or arrow root and vegetable pulp should be 
usually of the consistency of cream. 

More of the pulp of the vegetable put through a coarse 
sieve, with a little water or milk makes a paste which is called 
a puree. 

Chowder contains fish, pork, potatoes and sometimes other 
vegetables, with a foundation of milk. 

Left over vegetables that have been cooked in white 
cream sauce or mashed potato with a little onion may easily 
be made into a good soup by adding some skim milk.

SALADS CONSERVATION RECIPES 

SALADS 

Mrs. F. C. Torrey, Editor. 

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS 

All fish and meat salads are improved by marinating. 

A good oil for salad is made from equal proportions of 
olive oil and corn or cottonseed oil. 

The secret of good French dressing is making a thorough 
emulsion of the oil and vinegar. 

French dressing is much improved by the addition of a 
little Roquefort cheese, thoroughly incorporated. 

When mayonnaise curdles, put a tablespoon of cold water 
in a clean bowl and add mayonnaise very gradually. 

Mayonnaise sometimes curdles because the oil is too cold. 
Oil should then be warmed by standing in hot water. 

Grated cucumber added to mayonnaise greatly improves it. 

Never mix mayonnaise with meat or fish until ready to 
serve. Use the greater part to spread over the top. 

A clove of garlic left in the vinegar bottle gives a good 
flavor. 

Tarragon leaves added to cider vinegar and left for twenty 
days produces a superior vinegar for salad. 

Vinegar is improved by boiling a few minutes with a little 
brown sugar. 

Paprika should be spread in the sun three days to bring 
out its true flavor. 

Whole pepper ground in a small hand mill gives a pung- 
ency wholly lacking in commercial pepper. 

Lettuce can be quickly dried without bruising by using 
paper toweling. 

Mix canned or cooked left over vegetables with French 
dressing and set in a cold place for one hour. If several kinds 
are used combine just before serving.

CONSERVATION RECIPES POULTRY 

POULTRY AND GAME 

Mrs. Tomse M. Shearman. 

CONSERVATION HINTS 

When boiling fowl or game, the fats which form on top, 
can be skimmed and used for shortening. The fat from 
turkey or chicken is particularly good as a substitute for 
butter in cream gravies. 

After the meat has been sliced from roast chicken or 
turkey the bones may be boiled and every particle of meat 
removed. Use the liquor for soup, with chopped vegetables 
or rice, and the meat minced and served on toast, with any 
preferred sauce. 

Corn meal mush or corn bread may be toasted and used in 
place of bread when serving fowl, meat or fish. 

STUFFINGS 

Use corn bread, corn flakes or other cereals, potatoes, 
and hominy. A generous use of nuts will make good the loss 
in flavor through the elimination of bread and cracker crumbs. 

LIQUID — Moisten with milk or water, but the liquid in 
which the feet and bones of the fowl have been cooked is 
preferable. A little of the giblet stew may be added. 

Ask to have the feet of the fowl delivered with the fowl. 

Cover bones, skin, trimmings, feet or giblets with cold 
water. Add a tablespoon each of carrot, onion and celery or 
parsley for each pint of water. Let simmer an hour or so. 
Strain and use for stuffing or for soup foundation. 

FAT — Grind the fat of the fowl used, or try it out. This 
as more desirable than butter as it helps to extend the flavor 
of the meat used through the stuffing. Use this fat also for 
basting. (A small piece of suet may be used for lean meat 
like hare or rabbit). 

SEASONINGS — Salt, pepper, summer savory, sage, 
thyme, minced parsley, chopped celery, ground onion, etc., 
may be used. 

EXTRAS — Drained oysters, giblets, mushrooms, raisins

ROAST TURKEY «* •* * * 

Take a young turkey, remove feathers carefully, singe and 
draw it, carefully taking out crop. Cut off the head, tie the 
neck close to the body by drawing the skin over. Rinse in- 
side with several waters, in one of which dissolve a teaspoon 
baking soda. Wash and wipe turkey dry inside and out, then 
rub the inside with salt. Stuff with a good dressing, sew up 
with strong thread, tie legs and wings to the body, rubbing it 
over with olive or corn oil Season with salt and pepper, 
dredge with a little flour. Place turkey in a roasting pan, 
pour over it a cup of boiling water and set it in the oven. 
Baste it often, turning it occasionally so every part will be 
thoroughly and uniformly baked. It is done when a clear 
liquid runs out upon piercing it with a fork. It requires be- 
tween three and four hours to bake a 15-pound turkey. Serve 
as usual with cranberry sauce. 

TURKEY GRAVY <* * <* <* 

Giblets. 1 pt. water. 

Flour. 

A good turkey gravy can be made by taking the giblets, 
putting them in a stew pan with water; boil until tender, 
adding necessary water from time to time. When done re- 
move the liquor, chop, then return to liquor and set aside 
until turkey is done. Skim the fat from the pan in which the 
turkey is being roasted; thicken with potato flour or corn- 
starch, add liquor from giblets, and enough boiling water to 
make sufficient quantity ; season and add chopped giblets.

Mrs. Wtn. E. Colby, Editor. 

CONSERVATION HINTS 

The editor wishes to acknowledge her indebtedness to Mr. 
'Grondona of San Francisco, for the information as to local 
fish. 

An increased use of fish, fresh, salted or smoked, is desir- 
able. "Such use not only conserves meat, but whereas cat- 
tle and poultry merely convert, for the most part, one avail- 
able form of food in another, fishes consume animal and veg- 
etable forms unavailable and useless as food for man." 

"Fish are often looked upon as not being meat. There is 
no characteristic difference between fish flesh and the flesh of 
■any other animal. The bulk of it is protein and water. Pound 
for pound there is nearly, if not quite, as much protein in fish 
meat as in beefsteak. Fish could be substituted for all other 
kinds of meat every day in the year without ill effects. Oily 
fish, like shad, herring, and eels, are especially nutritious, af- 
fording a large quantity of fat for fuel as well as the tissue- 
building proteins. Fish roe generally contains more protein 
than beef, and some fat in addition. Fish meat is quite as 
easily digested (i. e., as large a proportion in as short a time) 
as other forms of meat. It has been recommended as being a 
highly suitable form of protein for sedentary workers." — 
Government Bulletins. 

Too much stress cannot be laid on the advisability of 
using our cheaper fish, as sole, Rex sole, sand dabs, hake, 
rock and black cod and skate. Hake or skate can be substi- 
tuted for halibut, salmon or crab in any of the made dishes 
and are very delicate. Other local fish to be considered are 
Spanish mackerel, shad, baracouda, king fish and white fish. 

They have this advantage over halibut that they are fresh- 
ly caught in local waters while the halibut that we get has 
been in cold storage. 

Halibut and salmon may be canned and therefore we 
should use them sparingly. 

The small periodic consumption of fish is largely respon- 
sible for the prevailing high prices in this vicinity. A steady, 
increased demand for fish, six days in the week, soon would 
^ause a lowering of most of the prices. The fisheries of the

FISH CONSERVATION RECIPES 

United States offer large possibilities for increased food pro- 
duction if the people can be induced to eat more fish, espe- 
cially the kinds that have hitherto not been on the market. 

REMEMBER— Salt gives flavor to the fish. Lemon juice 
or vinegar keep the flesh of a boiling fish firm. Cucumbers, 
cold slaw, or a green salad, and potatoes or rice, should ac- 
company fish dishes. This is especially true of those species 
rich in fat, as the Sable fish, or black cod. Fish should al- 
ways be boiled, broiled or baked. Frying renders the fish 
tasteless. 

NOTE — In all recipes calling for white sauce, be sure to 
use a non-wheat flour.

SHELL FISH 

TO PREPARE CLAMS J" * <* <* 

Clams bought in the market vary from the small white 
clam found in Tomales Bay to the large Pismo Beach clam. 
They are not only a meat substitute, but very delicate in 
flavor and a welcome variation for the diet. 

If one digs the clams oneself it is well to put them for 
twelve hours, more or less, in water with a little salt and 
some cornmeal, in order to remove as much sand as possible, 
or they may be cleaned by rinsing through several waters. 
The necks of the smaller varieties are edible and when chop- 
ped or mashed can be added to the chowder, souffle, etc. To 
ensure freeing the juice from the sand it can be settled in 
several pots, straining it each time through cheesecloth and 
taking care not to pour off the sandy dregs. To remove clam 
from shell, scrub shells well and steam over a very small 
amount of water in order that the juice may not be diluted.

MUSSELS J» * * J» 

Sea mussels are as nutritious and wholesome as clams or 
oysters and are considered by some to be superior in flavor. 
They are the most easily digested of foods. 

Fresh mussels only should be used. If gathering them 
oneself, take the mussels from the rocks at low tide, and 
not during a spell of hot weather, which, if they are ex- 
posed at low tide to its effect may kill them. The mussels 
are alive if the shells are tightly closed. Until ready to use, 
keep covered with a damp cloth in a cool dark place.

SALT AND SMOLED FISH 

"Salt and smoked fish contain more nutriment, pound for 
pound, than when fresh. Salt fish must be freshened before 
use by soaking in water, flesh side down. Less freshening is 
required if the fish be boiled, than if fried or broiled. If very 
salty, the freshening process can be hastened by resting the 
fish in the water on a wire tray or on a few clean sticks, and 
if the pieces be thick, by making several deep incisions in the 
flesh."

The substitutes for meats besides fish are dried beans, 
lentils, peas, some nuts, milk, eggs and cheese. 

It is possible to combine these so as to make many un- 
usual and palatable dishes.

which have as their foundation beans, rice, or other foods 
having little flavor of their own. 

Use peppers, onions, garlic, leek, celery, catsup, Worces- 
tershire sauce, etc., for increasing flavor. Bean and nut 
loaves should be served with highly seasoned sauces.

MEATS 

Mrs. A. F. Pillsbury, Editor. 

Conservation must be the keynote in the use of meats as 
it is in the use of wheat, flour, sugar and fats. Less meat 
must be used; and in the choice of cuts those should be se- 
lected that are not so suitable for transportation. This in- 
volves a freer ordering of the cheaper cuts which require 
longer and slower cooking, but are just as nutritious. 

Waste must be avoided in every way. To this end we 
must first of all be sure of the quality of the meat. 

Beef should be of smooth, fine grain, of a bright red color, 
and well covered with white fat. The fat should be abundant 
about the kidneys. 

Mutton should be firm, juicy, and red in color. 

The proper cooking of the different cuts and kinds of meat 
will also eliminate waste. Beef requires more heat in roasting 
than mutton. Frequent basting with the fat in the roasting 
pan is essential. 

For the cuts other than roasts casserole and fireless cook- 
ing are true conservation methods. 

PRIME ROAST BEEF <* <* <* <* 

Sear the roast on both sides before a direct and very hot 
fire, or in a hot pan. Keep the oven at a good heat for 
fifteen minutes, then decrease somewhat. Fifteen minutes to 
the pound is an average allowance. If a very rare roast is 
desired allow less time. Add no salt until the first half 
hour's roasting. Baste often. 

SIMMERED, OR SWISS STEAK ^ ^ * ji 

\y 2 lbs. top round. 1 small onion. 

2 tblsp. drippings. Flour, non-wheat. 

1 large carrot. Salt and pepper. 

Dredge steak with flour and bruise well with meat bruiser, 
or wooden potato masher. Sear quickly in hot fat ; place car- 
rots and onion, chopped fine, on top of steak. Add one cup 
of water and simmer in a covered pan or casserole two hours.

PORTERHOUSE STEAK * * <* <* 

Use the broiler of the gas oven, or the coals of an open

VEGETABLES 

Mrs. Harold W. Fairbanks, Editor. 

To aid the Food Administration use freely fresh and 
home-preserved and dried vegetables and very little of the 
commercial, dried and canned commodity. 

When boiling vegetables never throw away the water ; 
boil down, if necessary, and save the liquor. This can be 
added to almost any soup, or it can be made into a delicious 
and nourishing soup by the addition of left-overs from 
gravies, vegetables, cereals, etc., and a little thickening. The 
proper seasoning of a soup of this kind is important. 

To aid the Administration still further just at this time, 
the extensive use of potatoes is to be especially commended. 
It is hoped that the following suggestions on the value and 
the cooking of potatoes will stimulate their use. 

Eat more potatoes and save bread. Potatoes contain the 
same nutriment as bread. Always serve potatoes with meat. 
Never serve bread and potatoes. French fried potatoes make 
a suitable accompaniment for any salad. For this purpose 
the potatoes may be prepared as for deep frying and then be 
baked in the oven instead, using a little oil. 

BOILED POTATOES <* <* <* <* 

If you wish to freshen old potatoes let them stand in 
water before peeling. If allowed to stand in water after the 
skins are removed, much of the starch is washed away. 

To boil potatoes in their skins, scrub well and then with 
a sharp knife cut a narrow band around the potato and a 
little of the skin from each end. 

If potatoes are to be peeled, use a very sharp knife so that 
the parings may be as thin as possible. This care will help 
to retain the mineral content. 

STEAMED POTATOES J» «* * «* 

Prepare as for boiling potatoes in their skins. Put into 
a saucepan with a perforated bottom and place over a kettle 
of boiling water. The water must be kept boiling every 
minute. They will require from 30 to 40 minutes to cook. 



87 
VEGETABLES CONSERVATION RECIPES 

BAKED POTATOES * * * ^ 

Scrub the potatoes well, cover with boiling water and let 
them stand from 5 to 10 minutes. Then place in a hot oven 
and bake about 25 minutes. If they must be kept hot for any 
length of time, break them and keep them in a warm oven. 

RE-HEATING POTATOES # # # * 

Cold boiled, steamed, or baked potatoes may be used in 

various ways. Several points must be kept well in mind. 

The potatoes must be well seasoned to make them savory; 

they must be thoroughly heated, and they must be served as 

hot as possible. 

The cold potatoes may be sliced or cut into small pieces, 

seasoned well and browned in a little oil or drippings. A little 

minced onion, chives, or green pepper or fine herbs will give 

variety. A little milk may be added; then fry the potatoes 

until well browned. 

CHEESE POTATOES <* <* * <* 
6 large potatoes. Butter substitute. 
y 2 cup grated cheese. Salt and pepper. 
Bake potatoes, remove ends, scrape out inside without 
breaking shells, mash, mix with cheese and season with pep- 
per and salt. Refill shells, put on ends and bake fifteen 
minutes. Mrs. T. M. Shearman. 

POTATOES ON HALF SHELL <* <* * * 

6 medium potatoes. Whites of two eggs. 

y 2 cup hot milk. Salt and pepper.

Bake potatoes, cut in two lengthwise, take out inside; 
mash well, add milk, butter, salt and pepper. Fold in stiffly 
beaten whites of eggs. Refill potato shells, bake about 15 
minutes. Chese may be sprinkled on top if desired.

BROWNED SWEET POTATOES * * * * 

Boil medium sizen sweet potatoes 45 minutes. Peel them

This dish may be varied by adding one tablespoonful of 
grated cheese to the cream sauce and sprinkling the top with 
cheese. Or the dish may be prepared with the raw potatoes. 
Peel and slice the potatoes ; season well, add hot milk enough 
to cover and bake an hour at least.

Mrs. H. C. Newman. 

BAKED SWEET POTATOES <* * <* # 

Wash the potatoes and bake the same as white potatoes. 
Small ones will bake in half an hour, while very large ones 
will require an hour or more. If the potatoes are liked very 
moist and sweet, bake from one to two hours, depending on 
the size. 

FRIED SWEET POTATOES * * <* <* 

Cut the boiled potatoes into slices and fry brown in 
savory drippings. Or the potatoes may be cut in four parts

CONSERVATION HINTS 

The Bread and Cake Departments have been revised by 
Mrs. Grace M. Haring, and all new recipes tested in the 
Household Science Classes of the Berkeley High School. The 
revision has been made to conform to the present wheat sit- 
uation. In view of the Government's earnest request that 
we restrict our consumption of wheat to the least possible 
amount, it has seemed advisable to submit only non-wheat 
recipes for quick breads and cakes. 

A few general hints on the use of substitute flours in bak- 
ing and other forms of cooking may prove helpful. It is 
well to bear constantly in mind that the substitute flours are 
as nourishing as wheat and by careful combinations may be 
made quite as acceptable. 

In California we have corn, oat, rice, barley, potato, buck- 
wheat and soy bean flours ; corn, oat, and barley meals, as 
well as potatoes, rice, and hominy, to use as substitutes. 
With these it is possible to make a great variety of quick 
breads without any wheat flour, and we can also make yeast 
breads in the home with only a fraction of the wheat form- 
erly used, or with none at all if necessary. These loaves are 
not so large nor so light but if the various flours are effec- 
tively combined the flavor is good. 

Quick breads are those best adapted to the substitute 
flours. These should, therefore, be made to take the place of 
the former yeast wheat bread as far as possible. They may 
all be baked at home and they are, of course, better served 
fresh and hot. Hot breads are not unwholesome if light and 
thoroughly baked, but, if preferred, they may be toasted 
when cold. 

For batter cakes and waffles many of the substitutes 
excel wheat flour. They also make excellent pastry because 
they are so short; the only difficulty is in the handling. 
Flours rich in gluten have never been considered desirable 
for pastry and cake. The substitutes, therefore, give better 
results than all wheat for these mixtures. Crisp crackers can

BREADS CONSERVATION RECIPES 

be made, but must be carefully handled because of their 
tendency to crumble. 

Since the substitute flours, as a rule, require more mois- 
ture than wheat flour, they are better for muffins and cup 
cakes than for rolled biscuits or cookies. Although a soft 
dough can be used, a drop biscuit or a drop cake is to be 
recommended instead. The elimination of the bread board 
fs a saving of labor and also of flour. This should be con- 
sidered, even if substitute flours are used. The Government 
has put no limit on the use of flours other than wheat, but 
the drain on the supply of cereals is so great that the Food 
(Administration is urging the substitution of other foods for 
them. In view of this fact any method of cooking that is 
jvvasteful of the substitute flours should be avoided. 

Corn is our largest cereal crop and is adapted to a variety 
of non-wheat breads. 

Oats rank next in availability. Rolled oats put through 
a meat grinder may be made into as fine a flour as wheat. 

Barley, corn, or rice flours may be used just as wheat has 
jbeen for cream sauces and gravies. Cornstarch has always 
jbeen used for such purposes by many housewives. Potato 
jflour is preferred by some cooks. If it is used it must be 
moistened with cold water before adding to the hot gravy. 
For brown gravy use equal parts of barley flour and corn- 
starch. It is well to have a quantity of this flour ready for 
fuse at any time. Prepare it by setting it on the stove in a 
roasting pan and stirring constantly until it is a light brown 
color. When cool put in glass jars and cover. 

Potato flour is good for some mixtures, for sponge cakes 
•especially, but the potatoes themselves are a better and a 
cheaper substitute for bread. 

Rye ranks next to wheat in gluten content and may, 
when available, be substituted for wheat in any recipe, but 
'owing to the present shortage of rye, it can no longer be 
1 advocated as a wheat substitute. Although other non-wheat 
flours are lacking in gluten and vary in weight and in the 
amount of moisture absorbed, they can, with a little care, be 
used in the place of wheat or rye in breads as well as in other 
, foods. 

The only real difficulty in the use of conservation flours 
in the place of all of the wheat or rye is the problem of 
making the mixture light in spite of the lack of gluten. This 
deficiency may be partially made good by the use of eggs.

CONSERVATION RECIPES BREADS | 

Some cooks soak or scald the flour or meal for several 
hours or overnight before using as another means of binding* 
the ingredients. This applies especially to the use of corn, 
oats and rice, and gives a bread of smooth consistency. 

In making quick breads with the substitutes, any standard 
wheat recipe may be used and varied as occasion demands.; I 
Omit the wheat and substitute other flours in its place. When 
this is done by measure instead of by weight, a mixture of 
two or three kinds of flour is advisable. This method also j 
modifies the distinctive and somewhat undesirable flavor of 
certain flours. When using two or more flours, they should 
be sifted together several times. More salt, less shortening, 
and a little more baking powder is needed. Sour milk or 
buttermilk is preferable. 

The addition of currants, raisins, nuts, molasses or spices 
is especially desirable for the non-wheat breads and cakes. 

In general better results are obtained when non-wheat 
batters are thin and baked in small portions, as muffins, very 
small loaves, or thin layers. A hotter oven may then be 
used. Serve fresh and hot if possible. 

In using waffles, hot cakes, or muffins, it is well to bear 
constantly in mind that these articles of diet are to take the 
place of bread. Avoid left overs even though the crumbs 
may be used in other dishes. In escalloped dishes and meat 
loaves calling for crumbs, substitute potatoes, rice, corn- 
flakes, or corn or oatmeal mush, or eggs. If the making of 
crumbs is unavoidable, they should be used again in breads 
to save flour and other cereals. 

The following recipe is submitted as a basis for making 
muffins with any kind of flour. It is capable of many varia- 
tions. All measurements are level, and the flour is measured 
after sifting unless otherwise stated. 

STANDARD MUFFIN RECIPE ■* ■* * <*■ 

2 cups flour (reserve j4 cup to be added later as needed.) 

4 tsp. baking powder. 

1 tsp. salt. 

1 cup milk or other liquid. 

1 tblsp. sugar, syrup, or molasses.

beaten egg last and adding as much of the flour held in re- 
serve as is needed to give a medium, thin batter. Bake in 
well greased tins in a moderate oven 20 to 40 minutes. The 
muffins should be small. 

Any flour may be used, but there are several reasons why 
a combination of flours is preferable. Bread crumbs, dry 
mashed potatoes, cooked rice or hominy may replace % to 
y 2 of the flour. Dried fruits, nuts, or cheese may be added. 

Sour milk or buttermilk may be substituted for sweet 
milk in any of these recipes. Add y 2 teaspoon soda for each 
cup and reduce the quantity of baking powder in the recipe 
by one-half. If the milk is clabbered, less flour is needed. 

The number of eggs may be increased. For each addi- 
tional egg added decrease the baking powder }4 teaspoon 
and use less liquid and slightly less shortening. If eggs are 
not available they may be decreased in number or omitted 
■entirely by making the opposite changes. Eggless non-wheat 
batters should be made thicker. 

If baking powder is the only leavening, instead of using 
2 level teaspoons of baking powder for each cup of flour as 
for wheat flour, substitute a slightly rounded measurement 
obtained by drawing the spoon edges up on the side of the 
slanting baking powder can. A larger increase in baking 
powder is wasteful as the difficulty is not in the lack of bak- 
ing powder but in the inability of non-gluten flours to utilize 
it. 

WHEATLESS CORN BREADS 

Use the flours on hand. In remodeling recipes it is bet- 
ter to use a mixture of flours in place of the wheat flour. If 
rye flour is used, corn meal breads may be eggless. 

SOUR MILK CORN BREAD MODEL Jl 4§ 4» . J»

There are three ways of mixing this bread: 

Method 1. — The meal, milk, salt, fat, and sugar are cooked 
together in a double boiler for ten minutes. When the mix- 
ture is cool, the eggs, well beaten, are added and the soda 
> dissolved in a tablespoon of cold water.

Method 2. — The dry ingredients are mixed together, and 
then the sour milk and eggs, well beaten, and the melted 
shortening are added. If the second method is used, th<| 
cold water is omitted. 

Method 3. — Beat yolks and whites of eggs separately as 
for cake. Add the liquid gradually. Fold in the stiffly beat- 
en whites at the end. 

The bread should be baked in a shallow pan or in indi- 
vidual muffin tins about thirty minutes. 

Raisins, currants, dates, prunes, or cocoanut may be 
added. Dredge these with rice flour and fold in with whites? 
of eggs.

WHEATLESS YEAST BREADS 

Acceptable yeast breads are difficult to make without any 
wheat or rye. A loaf as light as wheat bread is expected 
and as yet this result has not been secured even by experts. 
From 50 to 70 per cent of flour high in gluten is still found 
to be necessary in order to produce a loaf that is salable and 
will keep. 

New combinations are being published daily by those who 
are making an effort to meet this problem in the home and 
hotels and restaurants. These recipes are for breads made in 
large quantities. Those giving the best results when reduced 
to small proportions are submitted here in an effort to re- 
duce the waste in cereals caused by individual experimenta- 
tion. 

But it is well to bear in mind that these breads are more 
difficult to make than wheat breads and should not be at- 
tempted by those who have been unsuccessful in making

CONSERVATION RECIPES BREADS 

yeast breads in the past. Conservation quick breads should 
be substituted. 

In making these breads it is advisable to handle the dough 
as little as possible. The following recipes for Beaten 
Breads will suggest the method : 

BEATEN BREADS 

Good results have been obtained by the use of eggs and 
cereals thickened by scalding. This method is best adapted 
to corn and oatmeal but it gives a dough too soft to be 
kneaded. A fine grain may be secured by beating thoroughly. 

The proportion of yeast in the following recipes is in- 
tended for quick process bread to be raised and baked during 
the day, requiring about five hours. If set over night, omit 
half the yeast. Attention has already been called to the fact 
that with the conservation flours the smaller the loaf the 
better the result. So it is advised to bake the bread mixtures, 
whenever possible, in muffin or layer cake tins. 

EGG CORN BREAD j* # * # 

Zy 2 cups barley flour. 1 egg. 

1 cup corn meal. 2 tblsp. syrup or sugar.

cool. Then add the other ingredients. Beat well, put in 
greased bread pan and when double its bulk bake in mod- 
erate oven fifty minutes.

1 egg (may be omitted). 

Scald corn meal with the boiling water. When cool add 
the other ingredients, the rolled oats last. Mix well, put in 
greased pan and when double its bulk bake in moderate oven 
fifty minutes. 

Oat flour or ground rolled oats may be used in the place 
of rolled oats. This is a coarse bread if the oats are used 
un ground.

BREADS CONSERVATION RECIPES 

KNEADED BREADS 

A bread board is not Required for any of these breads. The 
dough is soft and may be cut down and kneaded in the bowl 
by using rice flour on the hands. 

All of these breads are better baked in small portions or 
small loaves. 

Stiffly beaten whites of eggs folded into the dough before 
molding give a lighter bread. 

It is well to moisten the surface with milk or with a 
mixture made by beating the yolk or the white of an egg in 
1 tablespoon of cold water. To give a smooth surface, this 
should be repeated before baking. 

YEAST BREAD <* <* * * 

2 heaping cups barley flour. 

% cup cornstarch and rice flour mixed. 

1 cake yeast (y 2 if set over night). 

2 tblsp. sugar. 

1 tblsp. shortening. 

1 egg. 

1 tsp. salt. 

Mix the same as wheat yeast bread. Set aside until 
double in bulk. Work down with the tips of the fingers and 
shape into loaves ; put into small well greased pans. When 
again double in bulk, bake in moderate oven fifty minutes. 
May be shaped as rolls and baked in hot oven for twenty 
minutes.

In the following three recipes, the dough is not elastic 
like that of wheat breads after the first rising. It looks 
more like a thick drop cake batter after the last of the flour 
is added and must be scraped from the spoon into the muf- 
fin or bread pans. It cannot be molded. Moisten, and set 
in a warm place to rise and the dough will gradually take 
the shape of the pans, thicken, and rise rapidly to double its 
bulk. When baked it has the texture of wheat bread and 
a crisp crust.

Raisins, currants, nuts, or dates are an addition to any 
bread. They may be kneaded into the dough. The grated 
rind of a lemon or a little lemon juice may be added. 

This fruit dough may be baked as for coffee bread with a 
slightly sweetened meringue on top. 

Muffins or rolls may also be frosted before baking. If, 
while baking, the plain breads or rolls are brushed over with 
slightly beaten white of egg diluted with 1 tablespoonful 
of cold water, a smoother surface will result. Oil should 
not be used. 

Two thin rounds of dough with a coating of egg yolks 
between will give a sandwich roll that will pull apart easily

RYE WITH OTHER FLOURS * * <* <* 

The use of rye alone in breads is not recommended. Be- 
cause of its high gluten content it is needed for export and 
can no longer be regarded as a substitute for wheat. 

The following recipe containing rye is submitted for use 
if }'OU have rye flour on hand. It gives a desirable loaf that 
cuts well and keeps well: 

RYE WITH OTHER FLOURS <* ■* * *

1 large potato. 1 tblsp. salt. 

2 cakes of yeast, or 

Enough rye or barley flour to make a dough that does not 
stick to the fingers (about 2 cups). 

Pare and cook the potato, drain, saving the water. Mash 
the potato and all the liquid and the yeast dissolved by stir- 
ring in the sugar. Sift in the measured dry ingredients and 
add the extra flour. Allow to rise until light. Knead well. 
Place in oiled pans in a warm place to rise again. Bake

Mrs. R. H. Wetmore, Editor. 

The following- recipes have been somewhat changed from 
their original form, to comply with the latest rulings of the

CONSERVATION RECIPES CAKES 

WHEA TLESS CAKES & COOKIES 

In making cakes from substitute flours it is well to sift 
the flour several times. Use the same methods for making a 
light batter as for wheat flour cakes. These cakes require 
longer and more careful baking. Use a moderate oven and 
for a loaf cake do not light the oven before the cake is put in. 

More salt and less shortening or none at all is required. 
These cakes should be more highly flavored or served with a 
jelly or tart filling. 

Satisfactory Cakes and Cookies may be made from any 
one of the substitute flours alone, or from their products, 
such as cornflakes ; but in changing a standard white flour 
recipe it is wiser to use a mixture of the substitute flours. 
The batter for these cakes should be thin. 

Conservation flours are especially well adapted to spice 
cakes or ginger breads ; for sour milk and molasses make 
a desirable batter and the spices modify the flavor and color 
when this is objectionable. 

Sponge Cakes, in which eggs alone are used for leaven- 
ing, are to be recommended at this time when hot quick 
breads are used so extensively, for these cakes have much 
the same consistency as yeast breads, contain no baking pow- 
der, and are served cold.

and continue beating; beat whites stiff and beat into first 
mixture. Add baking powder and salt to the flour and sift 
into the mixture. Add flavors. Bake in a moderate oven 
about thirty minutes. 

Do not fill tins more than half full. This batter can be 
made thick enough to drop from a spoon in small cakes, but 
it is apt to be tasteless unless highly seasoned with chopped 
almonds or almond essence. 

The addition of 2 teaspoonsful of cider vinegar to each 
cup of flour and no flavoring, or 1 tablespoonful lemon juice 
and the grated rind of half a lemon will be found to give 
good results. 

Served with berries, this makes a good short cake.

CORN FLAKE COOKIES JND MJCJROONS 

Cookies and Macaroons made up on a basis of toasted 
corn flakes have a delicious, nutty flavor. They are quickly 
made. They require a slow oven and careful watching as 
they burn easily. The proportions in these recipes are for 
uncrushed flakes. If preferred the flakes can be rolled, but 
a much larger quantity will be required to make a drop 
batter. It is well to bake one as a test cake before all the 
batter is put in the pans. More flakes can be added if it 
spreads. 

The material is crumbly but can be dropped from a tea- 
spoon on greased pans and merges during the cooking.

stones and rub through colander. Add sugar. Beat the eggs 
very stiff. Add the prunes one spoonful at a time. Bake in 
slow oven until a light brown — about 20 minutes. Serve

CANDY DEPARTMENT 

Mrs. Elizabeth M. Spooner 

CANDY MAKING FOR AMATEURS * # * * 

The aim of this department has been not only to call 
attention to recipes that make use of sugar substitutes, but 
also to stimulate home-candy making by selecting more espe- 
cially those that commend themselves because of their sim- 
plicity and ease of preparation. 

The following suggestions from the Food Administration 
may prove helpful when buying or making candy. 

WAR SWEETS <* «* «* J» 

There are at least four groups of candy that contain a 
minimum instead of a maximum amount of sugar, and they 
also contain other pure and wholesome ingredients which are 
plentiful. 

1. The first group includes chocolate coated candies with 
nut and fruit centers, the old fasihoned chocolate creams 
with the bitter-sweet coating, and such candies as Nouga- 
tines and Turkish pastes. There is an abundance of choc- 
olate ; it is pure and wholesome and has high food value. 

2. The second group includes "hard boiled candies" such 
as lemon drops, stick candy, fruit tablets, peanut bars, peanut 
"brittle, glace nuts and the like ; and molasses candies. 

3. Marshmallows and similar candies comprise the third 
group. They may be eaten plain, toasted, dipped in choc- 
olate, rolled in cocoanut and in many other palatable forms. 
Popcorn confections belong to this group. 

4. In the fourth group are included gum drops, jellies, 
jelly beans and the like, giving a wide variety of candy made 
from pure and wholesome ingredients and containing a mini- 
mum amount of sugar. 

PEPPERMINT TAFFY J* * * * 

Ay 2 cups syrup. 1 tblsp. butter. 

y 2 cup vinegar. Peppermint. 

Combine either syrup, molasses, or corn syrup with the 
vinegar and butter, and boil until it becomes brittle when 
dropped in cold water. Remove from the fire, add pepper- 
mint to taste, and pour on a greased platter to cool. Pull 
as soon as it is cool enough to handle.

The following methods for preserving fruits and fruit 
juices have been given by Mr. W. V. Cruess of the Uni- 
versity of California. 

CANNING FRUITS WITHOUT SUGAR <* <* * ■* 

METHOD A: Express juice from ripe grapes or other 
ripe and juicy fruit. This can be done by passing the fruit 
through a meat chopper, heating it to boiling point, straining 
off the juice, etc., as you would for jelly making. If this 
juice is very sweet and low in acid, it can be used without 
further treatment. If it is somewhat sour, the sour taste 
should be reduced by adding a small amount of baking soda. 
This should be added in very small quantities and stirred 
Stop the addition of the soda when the tart taste has been 
sufficiently reduced. Place the peeled or otherwise prepared 
fruit in a pot and add the juice prepared as above. Heat the 
fruit and juice together until the fruit has been heated 
through and then pack into jars and sterilize as directed in 
"Canning Fruits and Vegetables." (See Section B., No. 3, 
p. 170.) 

METHOD B: To one cup of honey or neutral flavored 
table syrup, add about one cup of water. Heat the fruit 
to be canned in this syrup until the fruit is heated through. 
Pour hot into jars and sterilize as directed above. 

METHOD C: If the fruit is to be used for pie making 
purposes, it may be canned in water instead of in juice or 
syrup. The method of sterilizing would be the same as di- 
rected for the above recipe.

CONSERVATION RECIPES CANNING AND 

THE USE OF SYRUPS INSTEAD OF SUGAR IN 
JELLY MAKING * * «* <* 

If three-quarters of a cup of good honey or good table 
syrup is used to each cup of fruit juice suitable for jelly 
making, a good jelly can be made without the use of any 
sugar. It is also possible to substitute half honey or syrup 
for the sugar ordinarily used ; that is to say, use half a cup 
of syrup and half a cup of sugar and the usual amount of 
fruit juice. 

HOME-MADE FRUIT SYRUPS ■* * * * 

Syrups made from grapes, apples, and other fruits, can be 
used in cooking or on the table to replace sugar to a great 
extent. The following simple methods of preparation are 
suited for home use. 

1. FRUIT SYRUPS FOR COOKING PURPOSES 

(A) Crush the fruit and press out the juice. Apples 
and berries may be heated to boiling point after crushing, to 
facilitate extraction of the juice. 

(B) Heat the pressed juice to boiling point and filter 
through a jelly bag or other form of filter until clear. 

(C) Boil the juice down rapidly in a shallow pan. Long 
boiling darkens the color and injures the flavor. 

The hot syrup should be boiled down until it becomes of 
the desired consistency. 

(D) Pour the syrup boiling hot into scalded fruit jars 
or bottles and seal at once. 

Syrups made as above are suitable for use in mince meat, 
etc., but are somewhat too sour for table use. Grapes and 
apples are the most suitable for this purpose. 

2. FRUIT SYRUPS FOR TABLE USE * * # * 

(A) Clarify the fruit juice. To do this heat to boil- 
ing point and filter until clear. 

(B). Divide into two lots representing one-fourth and 
three-fourths of the juice respectively. 

(C) To three-fourths of the juice add 2 ounces (3 table- 
spoonfuls) of precipitated chalk per gallon. Heat to boiling 
point and allow to stand over night. Filter through a jelly 
bag to remove chalk. 



173 
PRESERVING CONSERVATION RECIPES 

(D) To the filtered juice add the one-fourth of the un- 
treated juice. Boil the juice down to a syrup and seal boil- 
ing hot in bottles or jars. This syrup is less acid than that 
made by the preceding recipe and is suitable for use on 
griddle cakes, etc. 

Precipitated chalk can be bought from any drug store. 
Ground limestone may be used instead. 

FRUIT JUICES 

RED GRAPE JUICE * * J> <* 

Take equal quantities of muscat grapes and black grapes. 
Crush together in a pot and heat to about 140 degrees F. A 
dairy thermometer is suitable for testing the temperature. 
Allow to stand over night and on the next day press out the 
juice. Strain it. Put it in bottles and cork bottles with 
corks that have been sterilized in boiling water for five 
minutes. Tie the corks down with a string. Any drug 
store clerk can show you how to tie the cork. Place the 
bottles on their side in a wash boiler sterilizer, covering 
the bottles completely with water. Heat the water slowly 
until it tests 175 degrees F. on the thermometer. Keep the 
water at this temperature for about twenty minutes. Re- 
move the bottles and seal the corks with melted paraffin. 
This makes a very pleasing and refreshing beverage. 

LOGANBERRY AND BLACKBERRY JUICE * <* J» * 
Heat the crushed berries to about 140 degrees F. Press 
out the juice and if the juice is very sour add sugar to taste. 
Pack in bottles and sterilize as directed for grape juice. 

OTHER FRUIT JUICES * J" * * 

Grape fruit, pomegranates, lemons, and apples all make 
satisfactory juices. With these fruits, however, the fruit is 
not heated before the juice is pressed out. Otherwise the 
treatment is the same as described for grape juice. 

FRUIT BUTTERS WITHOUT SUGAR * * J* & 

(A) Peel and pit the fruit. Add enough juice to pre- 
vent scorching. Cook until soft. Pass through a fine sieve. 

(B) To one quart of the pulp add three quarts of apple 
or grape juice and to each four quarts of the mixture two

CONSERVATION RECIPES CANNING AND 

teaspoonfuls of ground cinnamon and one of ground cloves. 

Or, if apple or grape syrup prepared as directed in recipe 
for Syrup for Cooking purposes is available, add one quart 
of syrup to one quart of pulp instead of using the juice as 
noted above. 

(C) Boil down to a thick, buttery consistency. Seal 
boiling hot in jars or cans. This preserve will be tart and 
will be suitable for a relish.

COMPOSITION OF OLEOMARGARINE ■* * <* * 

(From United States Department of Agriculture Bulle- 
tin No. 469). 

The principal fats used in the manufacture of oleomar- 
garine are oleo oil, neutral lard, cottonseed oil and other oils. 
These fats, which must be pure and carefully prepared, are 
thoroughly mixed and then churned with milk or sometimes 
cream. Owing to the ease with which a highly colored 
oleomargarine might be sold as butter, it is illegal to sell it 
unless plainly marked, and the practice of coloring it to imi- 
tate butter is discouraged by a heavy tax. It is a wholesome 
fat.

FOR THE TABLE <* <* <* * 

Oleomargarine and the various brands of margarines now 
on the market, mayonnaise or olive paste, cheese and cottage 
cheese, peanut butter. 

To y 2 pound of butter add 1 cup of milk. Beat together 
until well blended. Add J / 2 teaspoon of salt and y 2 teaspoon 
of butter color. Place on ice and serve in place of butter. 

Serve jams, jellies, syrups, gravy, etc., and less butter 
will be desired. 

FOR COOKING <* * * <* 

Save all fat trimmings ; render and use in cooking. 

Use cracklings from tried out fat for shortening in corn 
muffins, etc. 

Chicken fat makes fine shortening for cakes and is an ex- 
cellent butter substitute for cream sauces. 

Save all drippings. Mix with a little cottonseed oil and 
brown with flour for Brussels, sprouts, etc. 

MUTTON OR LAMB FAT FOR FRYING <* <* <* * 

1 lb. fat cleaned and cut in small pieces. 

1 qt. cold water. 2 tsp. soda. 

Cottonseed oil. Salt. 

Cover the fat with the water ; add the soda and allow it to 
stand for an hour, then drain well. 

Put the fat into a kettle ; add 1 cup cold water and render 
over a slow fire. Strain through a fine strainer or through 
two thicknesses of cheesecloth. 

Measure, and when partially cold, beat into it an equal 
amount of cottonseed oil and a little salt. Use 1 teaspoonful 
of salt to eact pint of the fat. 

Beat until the fat is very white and soft. 

Chicken fat may also be combined with the rendered 
mutton fat.

Measurements of Substitutes 

EQUAL TO ONE CUP OF FLOUR 

These weights and measures were tested in the Experi- 
mental Kitchen of the U. S. Food Administration, Home 
Conservation Division, and of the U. S. Department of Ag- 
riculture, Office of Home Economics. 

In substituting for one cup of flour use the following 
measurements. Each is equal in weight to a cup of flour. 



Barley 1^ cups 

Buckwheat % cup 

Corn Flour cup (scant) 

Corn Meal (coarse) .]/% cup 

Corn Meal (fine) 

1 cup (scant) 

Cornstarch ^ cup 

Peanut Flour 1 cup (scant) 



Potato Flour }i cup 

Rice Flour J£ cup 

Rolled Oats \y 2 cups 

Rolled Oats (ground in 

meat chopper) \y§ cups 

Soy Bean Flour % cup 

Sweet Potato Flour_l^ cups 



This table will help you to make good griddle cakes, 
muffins, cakes, cookies, drop biscuits, and nut or raisin bread 
without using any wheat flour. 

You will not need new recipes. Just use the ones your 
family has always liked, but for each cup of flour use the 
amount of substitute given in the table. You can change 
your muffin recipe like this : 



OLD RECIPE 

2 cups wheat flour. 
4 tsp. baking powder. 
% tsp. salt. 
1 cup milk. 

1 egg- 

1 tblsp. shortening. 

1 tblsp. sugar. 



NEW RECIPE 

\y% cups barley flour. 
1 cup (scant) corn flour. 
4 tsp. baking powder. 
Yt tsp. salt. 
1 cup milk. 

1 egg- 

1 tblsp. shortening. 

1 tblsp. sugar. 



The only difference is the substitution for wheat flour. 
Everything else remains the same. You can change all of 
your recipes in a similar way. 



GOOD COMBINATIONS OF SUBSTITUTES <* J» ^ ^ 

You will get better results if you mix two substitutes 

than if you use just one alone. Some good combinations are — 



Rolled Oats (ground) "* 

or 
Barley Flour 

or 
Buckwheat Flour 

or 
Peanut Flour 

or 
Soy Bean Flour 



Y AND 



"Corn Flour 

or 

Rice Flour 

or 

Potato Flour 

or 
Sweet Potato Flour 
or 
..Corn Meal 



CAUTIONS <* <* £ <* 

1. All measurements should be accurate. A standard meas- 
uring cup is equal to a half pint. 

2. The batter often looks too thick and sometimes too thin, 
but you will find that if you have measured as given in<he 
table the result will be good after baking. 

3. Bake all substitute mixtures more slowly and longer. 

4. Drop biscuits are better than the rolled biscuits, when 
substitutes are used. 

5. Pie crusts often do not roll well and have to be patted 
on to the pan. They do not need chilling before baking.

FOREWORD 

I 

The Patriotic Selective Saving Problem has de- 
termined the choice of recipes compiled in this book. 

"Conservation Recipes" is a war-time supple- 
ment to the ordinary cook book and is designed to 
aid the housewife in keeping the Food Pledge. 

FOOD CONSERVATION COMMITTEE, 
Mobilized Women's Organizations 
of Berkeley 



I 
"Eat Plenty— Eat Wisely— 
But Without Waste. " ] 

\ 

"If we can reduce our average consumption per 
person, 1 pound of flour (4 cups sifted), 2 ounces fat 
(lyi tblsp. butter, lard) 7 ounces of sugar (14 tblsp.) 
and 7 ounces of meat (beef, pork, mutton) per week, 
and if we use our milk and butter carefully and 
without waste, we can maintain our own people on 
a full diet and can still supply the deficiency in our 
Allies' food, for when these apparently small indivi- 
dual savings are multiplied by 100,000,000 every 
week, they assume gigantic proportions and offer 
a complete solution of our problem. 

"FOOD ADMINISTRATION." 

This is the minimum amount for each person to 
save and it remains for the patriotic to assume the 
responsibility of saving more to make up the defici- 
ency of those who fail to do their share.

SOUPS CONSERVATION RECIPES 

SOUPS 

Mrs. N. C. Robson, Editor. 

All kinds of left over meats can be utilized in making soup 
stock, and an average sized family should always be able to 
have a supply without buying fresh meat. 

Clear soups have very little nutritive value, but are useful 
as an aid to digestion. 

Appetizing soups can be made from left over vegetables, 
and the water in which other vegetables have been cooked, 
and seasoned with tomato, onion, celery, okra, parsley, thyme. 

To color soups brown use caramel, browned flour, onions 
fried brown, kitchen bouquet or beef extract. 

Stock made without bone or gristle will not jelly. 

Thickenings are made with either white, barley or potato 
flour, cornstarch or rolled cracker. 

The meat which is left after cooking retains the nutritive 
qualities, but must be made palatable by other seasoning as 
the juices have gone into the soup stock. 

Save all gravies for your soup kettle. 

Vegetable soups can be made without milk or meat, and a 
rich flavor imparted by using browned flour thickening. 
Broken scraps of bone which have been browned may be 
simmered in the vegetable water for additional flavoring. 

Instead of draining asparagus, squash, carrots, corn, pota- 
toes, parsnips, turnips, cabbage, celery, cauliflower, onions, 
peas or beans into the sink, drain into a bowl and every 
second day make resulting mixture into clear soup. Add wa- 
ter, milk — or both if you have it — a little rice, crackers, cooked 
barley or tapioca, croutons or noodles. Add the water from 
macaroni, rice or noodles to make thick soup. Press the left 
over vegetables through a colander and add to the clear veg- 
etable stock. Serve with small cubes of fried toast. 

Vegetables when used raw as a seasoning give a strong 
flavor, and only a little of each should be used. For flavoring 
soups, sauces, stews, etc., fried vegetables are far superior to 
the raw. 

To prepare them for use, clean and peel or scrape the veg- 
etables, then cut them into small pieces and put in a saucepan 
with butter substitute or sweet fat, allowing two generous 
tablespoonfuls of fat to a pint of vegetables. Place on the 

Page Five 



CONSERVATION RECIPES SOUPS 

stove and stir until the vegetables become hot. Partially 
cover the saucepan and cook slowly for half an hour, stirring 
frequently the contents until the fat begins to separate from 
the vegetables. Drain and save the fat for future use. Add 
the vegetables to the dish they are to flavor. 

Many soups are served with croutons. These are lightly 
buttered slices of bread, cut in cubes, and browned in a fry- 
ing pan.

two hours, seasoning with salt and pepper. Then add a hand- 
ful of some Italian paste, or barley. If barley is used it should 
be added with the tomato and potato. This soup is even bet- 
ter when re-heated. Mrs. C. L. Stern.

MILK SOUP •* •* «* * 

1 pt. water. 2 tblsp. butter. 

1 pt. milk. 1 small onion. 

2 cups of any kind of vegetable. Salt and pepper. 

2 tblsp. flour or cornstarch. 

Milk soups are both appetizing and nutritious. The basis 
of all is milk, thickened and seasoned by the addition of veg- 
etables boiled, and pressed through a sieve. 

An average milk soup with thickening of flour, cornstarch, 
potato starch, barley flour or arrow root and vegetable pulp 
should be of the consistency of cream. 

More of the pulp of the vegetable put through a coarse 
sieve, with a little water or milk makes a paste which is called 
a puree. 

Chowder contains fish, pork, potatoes and sometimes other 
vegetables, with a foundation of milk. 

Left over vegetables that have been cooked in white cream 
sauce or mashed potato with a little onion may easily be made 
into a good soup by adding some skim milk.

CONSERVATION RECIPES SALADS 

SALADS 

Mrs. F. C. Torrey, Editor. 

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS 

All fish and meat salads are improved by marinating. 

A good oil for salad is made from equal proportions of olive 
oil and corn or cottonseed oil. 

The secret of good French dressing is making a thorough 
emulsion of the oil and vinegar. 

French dressing is much improved by the addition of a 
little Roquefort cheese, thoroughly incorporated. 

When mayonnaise curdles, put a tablespoon of cold water 
in a clean bowl and add mayonnaise very gradually. 

Mayonnaise sometimes curdles because the oil is too cold. 
Oil should be warmed by standing in hot water. 

Grated cucumber added to mayonnaise greatly improves it. 

Never mix mayonnaise with meat or fish until ready to 
serve. Use the greater part to spread over the top. 

A clove of garlic left in the vinegar bottle gives a good 
flavor. 

Tarragon leaves added to cider vinegar and left for twenty 
days produces a superior vinegar for salad. 

Vinegar is improved by boiling a few minutes with a little 
brown sugar. 

Paprika should be spread in the sun three days to bring 
out its true flavor. 

Whole pepper ground in a small hand mill gives a pung- 
ency wholly lacking in commercial pepper. 

Lettuce can be quickly dried without bruising by using 
paper toweling. 

Mix canned or cooked left over vegetables with French 
dressing and set in a cold place for one hour. If several kinds 
are used combine just before serving.

POULTRY CONSERVATION RECIPES 

POULTRY AND GAME 

Mrs. Tomse M. Shearman. 

CONSERVATION HINTS 

When boiling fowl or game, the fats which form on top, 
can be skimmed and used for shortening. 

After the meat has been sliced from roast chicken or tur- 
key the bones may be boiled and every particle of meat re- 
moved. Use the liquor for soup, with chopped vegetables or 
rice, and the meat minced and served on toast, with any pre- 
ferred sauce. 

Corn meal mush or corn bread may be toasted and used in 
place of bread when serving fowl, meat or fish. 

STUFFINGS 

Use stale bread crumbs, cracker crumbs, corn bread, gra- 
ham bread, corn flakes or other cereals, potatoes, hominy. 

LIQUID — Moisten with milk or water, but the liquid in 
which the feet and bones of the fowl have been cooked is 
preferable. A little of the giblet stew may be added. 

Ask to have the feet of the fowl delivered with the fowl. 

Cover bones, skin, trimmings, feet or giblets with cold 
water. Add a tablespoon each of carrot, onion and celery or 
parsley for each pint of water. Let simmer an hour or so. 
Strain and use for stuffing or for soup foundation. 

FAT — Grind the fat of the fowl used, or try it out. This is 
more desirable than butter as it helps to extend the flavor of 
the meat used through the stuffing. Use this fat also for 
basting. (A small piece of suet or fat salt pork may be used 
for lean meat like hare or rabbit). 

SEASONINGS — Salt, pepper, summer savory, sage, 
thyme, minced parsley, chopped celery, ground onion, etc., 
may be used. 

EXTRAS — Drained oysters, giblets, mushrooms, raisins 
or currants, chestnuts, chopped walnuts or peanuts, a dozen 
or so cranberries or sour apple cut up, olives, whole or minced, 
afford variety.

cold liquid over it. (Hot liquid makes it heavy). Let it 
stand only a minute. Take up a handful at a time, squeeze it 
hard and dry and place in another dish. Toss it up lightly 
through the fingers. Add fat from the fowl, put through a 
meat grinder or tried out. Add a beaten egg or not as desired. 
Season with 1 teaspoon each salt, pepper, powdered summer 
savory, sage or green herb or parsley minced fine. Work 
all together. 

Note : Any of the above foundations may be substituted 
for the whole or a part of the bread. 

OYSTER STUFFING <* <* <* <* 

Y can strained oysters. Cracker crumbs. 

Same as above. Add J /> can strained oysters slightly

pan with butter substitute. Add to the onion the cocoanut 
juice, tomato and salt. When it comes to the boiling 
point thicken it with flour, into which first stir the curry 
powder. Just before serving add the cooked fowl and a few 
squares of toasted bread. Shrimps, prawns or pieces of fish 
may be used instead of the fowl. If fish is used it will require 
2 pounds of fresh halibut lightly baked ; if shrimps or prawns, 
about 1 pint. It will be better, if you have a cup of chicken 
or meat broth to add that also. Serve with rice cooked dry.

Mrs. Wm. E. Colby, Editor. 

CONSER VA TION HINTS 

The editor wishes to acknowlede her indebtedness to Mr. 
Grondona of San Francisco, for the information as to local 
fish. 

An increased use of fish, fresh, salted or smoked, is desir- 
able. "Such use not only conserves meat, but whereas cat- 
tle and poultry merely convert, for the most part, one avail- 
able form of food into another, fishes consume animal and 
vegetable forms unavailable and useless as food for man." 

"Fish are often looked upon as not being meat. There is 
no characteristic difference between fish flesh and the flesh of 
any other animal. The bulk of it is protein and water. Pound 
for pound there is nearly, if not quite, as much protein in fish 
meat as in beefsteak. Fish could be substituted for all other 
kinds of meat every day in the year without ill effects. Oily 
fish, like shad, herring, and eels, are especially nutritious, af- 
fording a large quantity of fat for fuel as well as the tissue- 
building proteins. Fish roe generally contains more protein 
than beef, and some fat in addition. Fish meat is quite as 
easily digested (i. e., as large a proportion in as short a time) 
as other forms of meat. It has been recommended as being a 
highly suitable form of protein for sedentary workers." — 
Government Bulletins. 

Too much stress cannot be laid on the advisability of using 
our cheaper fish, as sole, Rex sole, sand dabs, hake, rock and 
black cod and skate. Hake or skate can be substituted for 
halibut, salmon or crab in any of the made dishes and are very 
delicate. 

They have this advantage over halibut. They are 
freshly caught in local waters while the halibut that we get 
is from three to four weeks old. 

Halibut and salmon may be canned and therefore we should 
use them sparingly. 

The small periodic consumption of fish is largely respon- 
sible for the prevailing high prices in this vicinity. A steady, 
increased demand for fish, six days in the week, soon would 
cause a lowering of most of the prices. The fisheries of the 
United States offer large possibilities for increased food pro-

duction if the people can be induced to eat more fish, especially 
the kinds that have hitherto not been on the market. 

REMEMBER — Salt gives flavor to the fish. Lemon juice 
or vinegar keep the flesh of a boiling fish firm. Cucumbers, 
cold slaw, or a green salad, and potatoes or rice, should ac- 
company fish dishes. This is especially true of those species 
rich in fat, as the Sable fish, or black cod. Fish should always 
be boiled, broiled or baked. Frying renders the fish tasteless.

SABLE FISH &&<£<£ 

The Sable fish, known in our market as the black cod, is 
a new fish, with a firm flesh, white and flaky. It has a full 
rich flavor, while the fats are almost gelatinous in their con- 
sistency. There is little waste, as it is almost free from bone 
and requires but a short time for cooking. It is very accept- 
able if simply split and broiled.

TO PREPARE CLAMS <* <# J* <* 

Clams bought in the market vary from the small white clam 
found in Tomales Bay to the large Pismo Beach clam. They 
are not only a meat substitute, but very delicate in flavor and 
a welcome variation for the diet. 

If one digs the clams oneself it is well to put them for 
twelve hours, more or less, in water with a little salt and some 
cornmeal, in order to remove as much sand as possible, 
or they may be cleaned by rinsing through several waters. 
The necks of the smaller varieties are edible and when chop- 
ped or mashed can be added to the chowder, souffle, etc. To 
ensure freeing the juice from the sand it can be settled in 
several pots, straining it each time through cheesecloth and 
taking care not to pour off the sandy dregs. To remove clam 
from shell, scrub shells well and steam over a very small 
amount of water in order that the juice may not be diluted.

MUSSELS «*■ -" <* J" 

Sea mussels are as nutritious and wholesome as clams or 
oysters and are considered by some to be superior in flavor. 
They are the most easily digested of foods. 

Dead or stale mussels should not be used. If gathering 
them oneself, take the mussels from the rocks at low tide, and 
not during a spell of hot weather, which, if they are exposed 
at low tide to its effect may kill them. The mussels are alive 
if the shells are tightly closed. Until ready to use, keep cov- 
ered with a damp cloth in a cool dark place.

SJLT J1NT> SMOKET) FISH 

"Salt and smoked fish contain more nutriment, pound for 
pound, than when fresh. Salt fish must be freshened before 
use by soaking in water, flesh side down. Less freshening is 
required if the fish be boiled, than if fried or broiled. If very 
salty, the freshening process can be hastened by resting the 
fish in the water on a wire tray or on a few clean sticks, and 
if the pieces be thick, by making several deep incisions in the 
flesh."

MEATS CONSERVATION RECIPES 

MEATS 

Mrs. A. F. Pillsbury, Editor. 

Conservation must be the keynote in the use of meats as it 
is in the use of wheat, flour, sugar and fats. Less meat must be 
used ; and in the choice of cuts those should be selected that 
are not so suitable for transportation. This involves a freer 
ordering of the cheaper cuts which require longer and slower 
cooking, but are just as nutritious. If we comply strictly with 
Government orders we will use very little, if any, veal or lamb 
and no ham or bacon. 

Waste must be avoided in every way. To this end we 
must first of all be sure of the quality of the meat. 

Beef should be of smooth, fine grain, of a bright red color, 
and well covered with white fat. The fat should be abundant 
about the kidneys. 

Mutton should be firm, juicy, and red in color. 

The proper cooking of the different cuts and kinds of meat 
will also eliminate waste. Beef requires more heat in roasting 
than mutton. Frequent basting with the fat in the roasting 
pan is essential. 

For the cuts other than roasts casserole and fireless cook- 
ing are true conservation methods. 

PRIME ROAST BEEF * * <* * 

Sear the roast on both sides before a direct and very hot 
fire, or in a hot pan. Keep the oven at a good heat for fifteen 
minutes, then decrease somewhat. Fifteen minutes to the 
pound is an average allowance. If a very rare roast is de- 
sired allow less time. Add no salt until the first half hour's 
roasting. Baste often. 

PORTERHOUSE STEAK J* * ■* & 

Use the broiler of the gas oven, or the coals of an open 
fire, at top heat. Expose the steak to the direct heat and sear 
on both sides as quickly as possible. A thick steak will cook 
in fifteen minutes ; a thin one in ten. Serve at once with salt 
and butter on a very hot platter. Individual plates must also 
be hot.

VEGETABLES CONSERVATION RECIPES 

VEGETABLES 

Mrs. Harold W. Fairbanks, Editor. 

To aid the Food Administration use freely fresh and home- 
preserved and dried vegetables and very little of the commer- 
cial, dried and canned commodity. 

Baked or steamed vegetables retain all their valuable 
properties. 

When boiling vegetables never throw away the water ; boil 
down, if necessary, and save the liquor. This can be added 
to almost any soup, or it can be made into a delicious and 
nourishing soup by the addition of left-overs from gravies, 
vegetables, cereals, etc., and a little thickening. The proper 
seasoning of a soup of this kind is important. 

APPLES CURRIED <* <* <* # 

6 large apples. 1 cup brown sugar.

CONSER VA 7707V HINTS 

HOW TO SAVE WHEAT— In making bread save wheat 
by substituting other cereals such as barley, rice or corn flour 
for a part of the white flour. The use of whole wheat or gra- 
ham flour saves very little wheat. Watch wastes. Cut bread 
at the table. Use all crumbs and stale bread in some way. Re- 
frain from using toast as a garniture under meat and veg- 
etables unless it is wholly used when served in this way. 
Find some way to avoid the waste of sandwiches in school 
lunches. 

When using cornmeal in yeast bread, the best results are 
obtained when the meal and water, or meal and milk, sweet 
or sour, are heated together in a double boiler, without stir- 
ring, for ten or fifteen minutes. There will be no lumping, 
and the bread will have a better flavor, will be more moist, 
and holds together better. 

BREAT) MJKING 

SHORTENING— Shortening may be lard, beef fat, cot- 
tonseed oil, or any of the ordinary fats used in cooking. 

YEAST — When in good condition, compressed yeast is 
soft yet brittle, and is the same color throughout — a creamy 
white. It should have no odor, except that of yeast, which is 
hard to describe, but familiar to most housewives. 

Yeast dough should be kept covered while rising, other- 
wise a crust will form on top and interfere with the expansion. 

When bread is allowed to rise over night, one-quarter of a 
yeast cake to each pint of liquid used in the mixing is suffi- 
cient. Bread mixed and baked during the day requires a 
whole yeast cake to a pint of liquid. Bread mixed and baked 
in the daytime may be kept at a uniform temperature while 
it is rising by setting the bowl containing the dough in a pan 
of water and keeping the water at a uniform temperature of 
from 95 to 100 degrees. Or use the fireless cooker. 

Good yeast bread should rise to be twice its kneaded bulk. 
If pans containing loaves ready for the second rising are put 

Page Ninety 



BREADS CONSERVATION RECIPES 

in too hot a place while rising, a heavy streak will be found 
near the bottom of the loaf. 

If bread has risen too long it will be full of holes ; if not 
long enough, it will be heavy and soggy. 

BAKING — Bake bread in a moderate oven. Bread should 
continue to rise for the first fifteen minutes it is in the oven, 
then it should begin to brown, and continue browning for the 
next twenty minutes. The last fifteen minutes should finish 
the baking, when less heat may be used. 

Remove loaves from the pan and place side down to cool. 
If a crisp crust is desired, allow bread to cool without cover- 
ing; if a soft crust, cover with a towel during cooling. 
When cool put in a tin box or stone jar and cover closely to 
keep the bread fresh. Never keep bread wrapped in a cloth 
as the cloth will absorb the moisture and give the bread an 
unpleasant taste. Bread tins or jars should be washed and 
scalded twice a week, or oftener, to prevent the bread from 
moulding. 

USES FOR STALE BREAD 

There is probably more bread wasted than any other food. 
Although bread may be dry and uninviting for ordinary pur- 
poses, it holds the same nutritive value as when fresh, and 
can be used in a dozen different ways. 

All bread crumbs left on the plates or bread board or in the 
bread jar, and many broken pieces not suitable for toast, and 
any crusts or trimmings of toast, should be carefully collected 
and dried (not browned) in a moderate oven. They should 
then be pounded in a mortar or rolled on a bread board, and 
put away in tight covered dishes in a dry place. These will 
be useful in covering anything which is to be dipped in egg 
and crumbs and then fried. Bread crumbs brown better than 
cracker crumbs, and are much cheaper, being made from mate- 
rial that is usually thrown away. If necessary these may be 
sifted through a coarse sieve. 

Dried bread crumbs should not be used for bread pudding 
or scalloped dishes, as they absorb too much moisture. Stale 
bread crumbs that are not dried in the oven, but are made 
from odds and ends of stale bread, crumbled finely or grated 
on a coarse grater, are preferable for meat or fish stuffing, 
bread puddings, bread sauce, bread griddle cakes, scalloped 
fish, etc.

QUICK BREAKS 

Try substituting corn flour for one-third of the white flour 
in any baking powder biscuit or bread recipe. Graham, bran, 
barley, rye or any other dark flour may be substituted in the 
same way. 

In many common recipes sour milk may be substituted for 
sweet milk. One pint of thick sour milk will require a level 
teaspoonful of soda to neutralize it. If more is added, a por- 
tion of the soda will not be neutralized, and after baking it will 
give an unpleasant taste and odor, and a greenish color. If 
milk is sour, but not thick, the best results are obtained by add- 
ing half the quantity of soda, and then adding to the mixture, 
just before it is baked, a level teaspoonful of baking powder. 
Sour cream will take the place of both butter and milk. But- 
termilk may be substituted for sour milk, provided it is sour.

COMPOSITION OF OLEOMARGARINE ^ <* * <* 

(From United States Department of Agriculture Bulle- 
tin No. 469). 

The principal fats used in the manufacture of oleomargarine 
are oleo oil, neutral lard, cottonseed oil and other oils. These 
fats, which must be pure and carefully prepared, are thorough- 
ly mixed and then churned with milk or sometimes cream. 
Owing to the ease with which a highly colored oleomargarine 
might be sold as butter it is illegal to sell it unless plainly 
marked, and the practice of coloring it to imitate butter is 
discouraged by a heavy tax. It is a wholesome fat.

EXCHANGE VALUE OF FATS <* <* «* <* 

1 tablespoon of oleomargarine, commercial fat compound, 
clarified chicken fat, goose fat, clarified beef and mutton fat 
is equal to 1 tablespoon of butter. 

14^ tablespoons of hardened vegetable fat is equal to 16 
tablespoons of butter. 

HOW TO COOK WITH FATS •* «* «* •* 

BREADS — Fats may be omitted entirely if desired. Use 
clarified pork or beef fat, oleomargarine, hardened vegetable 
fats, fat compounds. 

HOT BREADS — As biscuits, muffins, pancakes. Use clar- 
ified pork or beef fat, oleomargarine, hardened vegetable fats, 
fat compounds, sour cream. 

CAKES — As cookies, cup, chocolate, spice, ginger. Use 
clarified beef fat, chicken fat, pork fat, hardened vegetable

CONSERVE WHEAT — If each person consumes one 
pound less per week than usual, we can feed our Allies. As 
many will not or cannot make this change, those who are en- 
listed for this service should do much more. 

Substitute as freely as possible, rice, barley, corn, rye, oats 
and cottonseed. 

CAKE FLOUR — Cake flour may be made by adding one 
package of cornstarch to five pounds of white flour. Sift three 
times and store in tin or glass, ready for use. Satisfactory re- 
sults may also be obtained by substituting equal portions of 
cornstarch and flour. 

CONSERVE SUGAR — If the use of white sugar seems 
necessary, ask for beet sugar, a local product, and so relieve 
transportation congestion. Substitute honey, maple, corn 
syrup (glucose), molasses, or brown sugar. 

Cakes made with honey, will keep until the butter is rancid. 
If made without butter, will keep indefinitely. Honey icing 
has the same advantage. Honey does not need heating, boil- 
ing or skimming. Its sweetening power is about the same as 
sugar, but it contains more water. There is very little adult- 
erated honey on the market. — Farmers Bulletin, 653. Honey 
and its uses in the Home. 

CONSERVE DAIRY PRODUCTS— Eliminate waste by 
buying whole milk. Take off the top instead of buying sepa- 
rate cream. Use skim milk, sour milk and buttermilk in cook- 
ing. 

SUGGESTIONS 

Use less milk or water when substituting cream. 

If less shortening is used, use less flour. 

In high altitudes use less baking powder and shortening. 

Coarse sugar makes a heavy, crusty cake. 

Too much flour will cause cake to crack. 

Coarse cake is caused by insufficient beating.

CONSERVATION RECIPES CAKES 

Lay a cold wet cloth on outside of cake pans before re- 
moving from the pans ; this contracts the metal and loosens the 
cake. 

A tin grater will rub off burned edges or surfaces. 

A spatula will be found invaluable for scraping out spoons, 
cups and bowls and for removing cake from pans. 

MIXING 

Have ready everything named in the recipe and all uten- 
sile before beginning to mix. 

Mixing bowls and flour, sugar and liquids should not be 
too cold. 

Have squares of paper cut a convenient size to hold sugar 
and flour. 

Sift flour before measuring. 

When creaming butter or fat, the bowl should be warm, or 
about a tablespoon of warm water added to hasten the cream- 
ing. Always cream the butter, add sugar gradually. 

Add a little flour before any liquid to prevent curdling. 

Add beaten yolks ; beat in thoroughly. 

Stir in flour and liquid alternately. 

Last, add beaten whites folded in lightly. 

BJKMCG 

Have oven ready to regulate before beginning a cake. Thin 
or small cakes need a hotter oven than loaves. Fruit cakes re- 
quire slow cooking. When baking any large cake a slow, even 
heat may be secured by lining the inside of the pan with sev- 
eral thicknesses of paper. Cover the top with paper also. 
Grease pans with unsalted fat. 

Baking time should be divided into four periods : 

1st quarter, rising. 

2nd quarter, finish rising, begin to brown. 

3rd quarter, finish browning lightly. 

4th quarter, all simmering sound of the cake should stop ; it 
should shrink a little from the sides of the pan and settle a very 
little. 

Do not suddenly jar or chill a cake ; set gently in a warm 
place to cool slowly. 

If oven is too cool, cake will be very coarse. 

If too hot, cake will form an uneven loaf. 

All sponge cakes require a cool oven.

ANGEL CAKE <* * <* <* 

1 cup sugar. 1 tsp. cream tartar. 

}i cup flour. Y\ tsp. salt. 

8 whites of eggs. 1 tsp. vanilla. 

Sift flour and sugar separately several times. Beat whites 
until frothy, then add cream tartar, continue beating until 
stiff. Add sugar gradually, and flour mixed with salt. Bake 
fifty minutes in slow oven, preferably in pan that has never 
been greased. Some prefer to add half the cream of tartar to 
the eggs and half to the flour. M. MILLER. 

To vary this recipe in several delicious ways 

1. Sprinkle the top with brown sugar before baking, mak- 
ing a macaroon crust. 

2. Sprinkle bottom of pan with preserved cherries, chop- 
ped walnuts, chopped raisins or peel, then pour in the cake 
mixture. 

3. Add chocolate or cocoa, about 1 tablespoon, moistened 
with a very little warm water, making a dark cake, or marble 
cake. Bake in muffin tins and frost with chocolate. Bake 
in layers and use any filling. 



THREE EGG ANGEL CAKE >* * * * 

1 cup sugar. 1 cup milk.

3 tsp. baking powder. 1 pinch of salt. 

Sift the first four ingredients four times. Add the milk, 
heated to boiling point ; beat well and add flavoring. Fold in 
lightly the egg, whites, beaten to a stiff froth.

A SIMPLE TEST TO USE IN JELLY MAKING 

(Recommended by the Bureau of Chemistry, United States 
Department of Agriculture). 

To determine how much sugar should be used with each 
kind of juice, put a spoonful of juice into a glass and add to it 
one spoonful of 95 per cent grain alcohol and mix by shaking 
the glass gently. 

Pour slowly from the glass, noting how the PECTIN — 
the substance in fruits, which makes them JELL — is precip- 
itated. 

If the pectin is precipitated as one lump, a cup of sugar 
may be used for each cup of juice; if in several lumps, the 
proportion of sugar may be reduced to approximately three- 
fourths of the amount of juice. If the pectin is not in lumps, 
but is merely precipitated, the sugar should be one-half or less 
of the amount of juice. 

If the juice shows no precipitation under the test, it is 
unsuitable for jelly making, and must be combined with apple 
juice or orange pectin, or other juices rich in pectin.

THE REASON FOR THE RAISIN 

By THOMAS J. ALLEN, M. D., D. O. 

Author of "Scientific Food Preparation," "Children's Diet," etc. 



Raisins or other supply of grape sugar, which is very different 
from cane sugar; should be much more largely used by children and 
by adults especially who suffer front weakness of the heart and who 
are called upon for quick and rapid nfuscular movement and for mus- 
cular endurance. It has been observed that mountain climbers have 
found raisins most suitable food. 

As a source of energy and heat, raisins are far superior to bread, 
which means that they are far superior in that rcs-peci to any other 
food. 

Children should be given no candy. The raisin is the best 
supply of the grape sugar that is so readily utilized in the child's 
muscular activities. 

With nuts, the raisin forms an ideal combination, a perfect diet, 
under ordinary conditions, for the adult. Although ivhole wheat 
bread, with raisins would be regarded as incomplete, on account of 
the deficiency in fat, I have proved it in my own case to be a perfect 
ration. 

To Prepare: Pour boiling water over raisins and let them stand 
for five minutes. Then put in a colander and wash with cold water. 
Then let stand in eold water for twelve hours.

CASWELL'S COFFEE— FROM TREE TO CUP 



|m i in r - - ----■■- - f- 

Drink Caswell's Coffee j 

"The Coffee You Drank at the Exposition" 

COFFEE TREE SHRUB grown from seed into small plant, | 

which, transplanted, develops into a bush or tree from 7 I 

to 16 feet high, producing a crop in 4 to 5 years. Leaves ] 

resemble Laurel in form, with star-like blossoms suggestive of i 

Jasmine, which fill the air with fragrance. Then follows clus- I 

ters of green cherries, which color bright red as they ripen and | 

become bouquets of ripe fruit in 6 months from time of flow- | 

i- ering. The cherries each contain two coffee beans, and shrivel | 

and dry as time for picking approaches. Coffee when ripe is | 

I placed in baskets and transported to drying grounds. Outer | 

I covering of coffee berry is a tough hull, and under this is a i 
1 pulpy material with an inside thin skin. 

In the roasting process of Caswell's coffee the berries swell ] 

up by the liberation of gases within their substances, the aro- | 

matic oils contained in their cells are cooked and made ready I 

for immediate solution with boiling water. Timing the roast j 

! and manipulating the fire are necessary to a perfect develop- ? 

. ment of the aroma and flavor. Geo. W. Caswell Co. employ i 
I only expert coffee roasters and blenders. 

The drinking quality is largely dependent upon the experi- j 

j ence and knowledge of the coffee roaster. Geo. W. Caswell Co. | 

1 use only scientific methods and the latest modern machinery. I 

I The true strength and flavor of roasted coffee is ground out, j 

j not boiled out; the finer the grind the more thoroughly are the j 

s cells opened and aromatic oils made ready for separation from i 

I their husks. The aromatic oils constitute the whole true flavor. | 

Caswell's coffee is useful as an aid to digestion. It is more j 

j germ proof than water or milk; it has a strengthening influence = 

s on mind and muscle without reaction; a pure coffee as indi- | 

I cated by Prof. Hollingsworth, of Columbia University, and j 

j from tests made by Dr. Wiestman, Prof, of Physiology, at Hah- j 

s nemann Hospital, in Philadelphia, who claim pure coffee a ! 

I valuable drink, lightening fatigue and sustaining strength, and j 
I develops mental power. 

Do not forget, Geo. W. Caswell Co. are expert coffee roast- s 

ers and blenders. Thirty years of practical experience enables I 

them to give you a pure coffee with all the true strength and j 
flavor without reaction.
