This Volume is Respectfully 

DEDICATED, 

By the Publisher. 



INTRODUCTORY. 

This little volume is sent forth in the confident belief 
that it is the Ne Plus Ultra of Cook Books, or Guides 
to Housekeepers. Unlike the trashy cook and recipe 
books vended about the country for $1.50 or $2.00 a 
copy, " hashed " up from irresponsible sources, more 
with a view to size and show than to practical utility, 
the Home Guide is a " collection of the actual and 
practical experiences, and in the language of 500 lady 
" Home "keepers. It is a compilation and condens-. 
ation of the thousands of recipes and hints contributed 
by the lady readers of the Chicago Tribune, and pub- 
lished in the popular " Home " department of that 
paper during the past two years. 

The contents embrace a very wide range of subjects 
pertaining to Cookery, which is, of course, the chief 
feature of the book. Every branch of the " culin- 
ary art" is treated by practical, successful house- 
keepers, and in a common sense manner, such as will, 
upon examination, be appreciated and understood by 
every lady who looks well to the health and happiness 
of her family. 

The "art" of good cooking is a most valuable 
acquirement to every household. It not only contrib- 



6 INTRODUCTORY. 

utes to health, good temper and domestic peace, but it 
saves many dollars in grocers' bills. Great quantities 
of good food is wasted in American kitchens, for the 
sole reason that housekeepers lack the valuable accom- 
plishment of knowing how to prepare it in various and 
inviting forms. 

In the other Departments of the book will be found 
many valuable Recipes and Hints upon various sub- 
jects pertaining to the Household, the Toilet, and the 
Sick Room. And, finally, although unpretentious in 
size, the reader will find upon due examination that 
" The Home Guide " is rich and voluminous in prac- 
tical and useful information. 



COOKERY. 




SOUP. 

S an introductory to the soup department, the 
following letter from "the best unprofessional 
cook in Chicago," is given : 

Mrs. Sarah, L., of Chicago. 

I believe it was nearly a year ago that I wrote my first 
letter to the Tribune, the burden of which was soup. If 
I have a hobby, this is it. A Frenchman once said, 
"Vat a peoples are ze Americans. Zesty kind of re- 
ligions and but one kinds of soup. Mon dieu!" And, 
I have often thought, if we had one kind of religion, 
perhaps, and 30 kinds of soup, we should be a healthier 
people. 

Now, knowing that the circles of readers has in- 
creased marvelously since I first talked about soups, I 
must beg of you, Mr. Editor, to let me return to my old 
subject, for it lays very near my heart, and urge upon 
mothers of young children to adopt this method of pre- 
paring soup for their principal meal in the middle of 
the day. 

If dinner is to be served at 12 o'clock, the piece of 
meat, costing 20 cents, must be put on the fire at 8, in 
about three quarts of cold water. After it has boiled 
up, skim off everything that may rise, as well as the 
grease, if it should be a fatish piece of meat. Then 
peel and cut an onion in pieces, and salt, about a great 
spoonful. Let it boil slowly all the time. In an hour 
or so peel and cut in slices 2 potatoes, i a small turnip, 
and a piece of carrot. They must all boil up fine; 
about 2 quarts of water must always be kept over the 
meat. At the same time the meat is put on the range, 
another kettle, holding about 2 or 3 quarts, containing 
2i cups of split peas, with just enough water to keep 



8 COOKERY— SOUP. 

them from burning, must be set in a place where they 
will just boil. When more water is needed add the 
soup or bouillons— always boiling. About 20 minutes 
before dinner is to be served, pour all the liquor from 
the meat into the peas, which will make a soup about 
as thick as flour porridge. If not salt enough add 
more, and a little pepper. When the family is seated 
around the table, let the girl dish the soup hot from the 
kettle into each soup-plate. This soup must be hot or 
it is not good. 

Bean and tomato soup I make in the same way, only 
the tomatoes will cook in an hour all that they need. 
These 3 kinds are good and nourishing in the spring, 
and every child coming home from school should have 
a plate to set his or her hungry stomach to work upon. 
The rest of the dinner the stomach is then prepared for. 

In my family I have some kind of soup almost every 
day in the week, and I believe it has made me a new 
stomach in the last 6 years. I was brought up on 
mince pies, roast beef, cocoanut cake and preserves. 
Now I eat my soup, a piece of the soup meat, with 
mustard, horse radish, or a little catsup, some good 
mashed potatoes, a puree, or some well-cooked vege- 
table, a pudding for dessert, and I have no more dys- 
pepsia, and my children are the pictures of health. I 
don't mean that the above is always our dinner, but 
sometimes. Ladies, try it. We have all been brought 
up on too rich food. The nearer we live to nature the 
better bodies and minds we shall have. 

I was reading a book the other day, and came across 
this old English proverb : "Eggs of an hour, fish of 
ten, bread of a day, wine of a year, a woman of 15, and 
a friend of 30." I might agree with the proverb in 
some respects, but a woman and friend are good for 
nothing until 40. So says "my man." 

Turkey Soup. 

Bertha Carlyle, Hyde Park. 
Save all the bones and break the backbone into 2 or 3 
pieces ; boil these in a little more water than you want 
soup, for an hour ; then skim out the bone, and put in 
the meat, cut in very small pieces, and boil a few mo- 
ments more ; then season with a little salt and pepper.

COOKERY— SOUP. 9 

Mock Turtle. 

'■'■Cook,'" Rocltford, lUa. 
Take i a calf's head, fresh and unstripped of skin : 
remove the brains, and clean the head carefully in hot 
water, leaving it in cold water for an hour ; then put 
into 6 quarts of warm water, with 2 pounds of veal, 
ditto pork, a roasted onion stuck with cloves, a rind of 
lemon, 2 sliced carrots, a bunch of herbs and a head of 
celery ; let it boil slowly 2 hours ; then take out the 
head and pork ; make forcemeat balls of the brains and 
tongue; break the bones of the head; put all into 
the soup, and boil two hours more. Put into a small 
stewpan a piece of butter, onions sliced thin, with 
parsley, mace and allspice ; add flour to thicken, and 
stir in soup slowly. Boil gently 1 hour more; pass 
through a sieve; season with salt, cayenne, lemon 
juice and a pint of Maderia wine. Add mushrooms, if 
desired, and serve with lemons cut in quarters. 

Cheat Oyster. 

M . A. £>., Cliicago. 

Take of tomatoes 1 pint, canned or fresh; take a 
large teacup of nice white codfish, picked up fine ; add 
to this 3 pints water ; a small tablespoonf ul good sweet 
butter ; when these have boiled 20 minutes, add 1 pint 
fresh milk — having ready £ teaspoonful baking soda. 
Use immediately. The taste is similar to oysters or 
lobsters ; all taste of tomatoes and fish are gone. 

Tomato Soup. 
Mrs. M. J. T., Chicago. 
To 1 pint canned tomatoes, or 4 large raw ones, cut 
up fine, add 1 quart of boiling water, and let them boil. 
Then add one teaspoon of soda, when it will foam ; 
immediately add 1 pint of sweet milk, with salt, pepper, 
and plenty of butter. When this boils, add 8 small 
crackers, and serve. It tastes very much like oyster 
soup. 

Turkey Soup. 
E. A. E., Chicago. 
Put all the bones, the scraps of meat, and the dress- 
ing of the turkey in a kettle, with enough water to 
cover them. Let it boil for 2 hours. When nearly 



10 COOKERY— SOUP. 

done add the tops of some celery chopped fine, and a 
teaspoonful of currie powder. When it is done, strain 
and set on the table hot. It makes a very rich, nice 
dish. 

White Soup. 

Amie M. Hale, M. D., Chicago. 
Boil a veal bone 3 hours with turnip, celery, onion, 
carrots, and whatever suitable thing else you have 
which will not turn it dark. Strain and boil again ; 
just before you serve it add a pint of cream or milk, 
with 3 eggs well beaten ; remove from the stove and 
stir rapidly. 

Vegetable Soup. 

Mrs. Sarah L., Chicago. 
Scrape 2 carrots, an onion, i of a cabbage, and 2 
turnips. Cut them in pieces a little larger than dice. 
Put the pieces in a large sauce-pan with a little butter 
and water ; let it cook \ hour ; then cut your potatoes 
in the same way. Take your meat out of the soup- 
kettle, skim off the grease and put all into your broth, 
and let cook another \ hour. In tne language of the 
average school-girl, "it's perfectly lovely." 

Beef Soup. 

Myrtle, Dundee, Ills. 
Cut the meat off the bone, and place it, with some 
suet, in the kettle to fry until brown. Then put the 
bone in and cover with cold water. Add £ cup of bar- 
ley, 1 onion and a turnip, put in the barley at once, and 
cook slowly until about 1 an hour before dinner, then 
cut the vegetables very fine, and cook them the I hour. 

"Soup Medley." 

'■'■Mrs. Emily, " Eau Claire, Wis. 

No. 1—1 pint of good gravy, 3 cups boiling water, a 
slice of turnip and i an onion cut in small bits, 2 grated 
crackers. Simmer half an hour. 

No. 2— Cut off the narrow ends from 2 or 3 sirloin 
steaks, chop them into morsels and put in a stewpan 
with a little salt, a tablespoonf ul of rice and a pint of cold 
water. Let it come slowly to a simmer, and simmei 
slowly for 3 hours. Then acid water enough to make 



COOKERY— SOTJP. 11 

quart of soup, a tablespoonful of tomato catsup, and a 
little browned flour mixed with the yolk of an egg. 

jSo. 3 — Pare and slice very thin 4 good-sized potatoes, 
pour over them 2 cups of boiling water, and simmer 

ffently until the potatoes are dissolved. Add salt, a 
ump of nice butter and a pint of sweet milk with a 
dust of pepper. Boil up once, and serve. 

Ko. 4—1 pint meat broth, 1 pint boiling water, slice 
in an onion, or a parsnip, or half a turnip — or all 3 if 
liked— boil until the vegetables are soft, add a little 
salt if needed, and a tablespoonful of Halford sauce. 

Xo. 5 — Let green corn — in the time of green corn — be 
grated, and to a pint of it put a pint of rich milk, a 
pint of water, a little butter, salt and pepper. i$oil 
gently for 15 or 20 minutes. 

doodle Soup. 
"Mrs. C. G. M." Chicago. 
Break 2 eggs into a bowl ; beat until light, adding a 
pinch of salt; then work in flour (with your hand) 
until you have a very stiff dough; turn it on yoiu- 
molding board, and work until it is as smooth as glass; 
pinch off a piece the size of a walnut, and roll it as 
thin as paper ; then with a sharp knife cut off very 
narrow strips ; proceed in the same way until all your 
dough is cut. Have prepared some good veal, chicken, 
or any other kind of broth, well seasoned, i an hour 
before you serve dinner ; drop in the noodles. Be sure 
the soup is boiling. Add a little parsley. If the 
noodles are made according to directions, they will be 
found far superior to maccaroni. 

Tomato Soup. 
"Mrs. E. S. P.," Burlington, Iowa. 
Put a tablespoonful of drippings or butter in a stew- 
pan ; cut an onion flue and fry in the butter ; then add 
one pint of tomatoes, pepper, salt and a teaspoonful 
of allspice ; cut a round steak in two and lay on the 
tomatoes; cover closely and let it simmer for three 
hours. 



FISH. 



Boiled Fish. 

Delmonico's Method. 
[ROM a reliable source, the following is presented 
as Delmonico's method for boiling fish : 



Fish should be washed as little as possible, and 
whitelish, after being cleaned and wiped with a damp 
cloth, should have the stomach stuffed with salt for an 
hour or two before cooking. Fish should be put on in 
colu water, so that the inner part may be sufficiently 
done, and it is also less liable to break. This rule holds 
good, except for very small fish, or for salmon boiled in 
slices, when boiling water should be used. The time 
may be easily known when it is ready by drawing up 
the fish-plate and trying if it will separate from the 
bone. A little salt and vinegar should always be put 
into the water. Some prefer their fish boiled in what 
is called a court bouillon, and this is how it is done : 
Lay the fish in the kettle with enough cold water to 
cover it, add a glass of wine or vinegar, some sliced 
carrot and onions, pepper, salt and a laurel leaf, a 
bunch of parsley, a fagot of sweet herbs, or some of 
the same tied up in a muslin bag. These seasonings 
impart a fine flavor to most boiled fish, excepting sal- 
mon, and for fresh-water fish it is considered very use- 
ful for getting rid of the muddy taste they often have. 

Boiled Fish. 

Mrs. M. A. D., Chicago. 
After well cleansing a good-sized fish, put into a fish- 
kettle, and set into a pot of boiling water well salted ; 
let it boil for 20 minutes ; take of vinegar sufficient to 
cover ; put into the vinegar 1 ounce of cloves, 1 of all- 
spice and 1 of pepper whole ; boil all together for 15 
minutes ; when nearly cold pour over the fish ; let it 
stand for 2 or 3 hours before using. 



COOKERY— FISH. 13 

Baked Fish. 

Mrs. W. S. G., Baraboo, Wis. 
Scale, wash and wipe dry, inside and out, a 2 or 3 
pound fish. Make a stuffing as follows : One pint 
grated bread ; 2 tablespoonfuls melted butter ; pepper 
and salt to taste ; 1 raw egg : a little celery salt ; 1 
onion, chopped fine, is, to my taste, an improvement, 
but can be omitted if not liked. Care should be taken 
not to wet the bread-crumbs ; the egg and melted bu- 
ter will moisten sufficiently. Tie over the fish thin 
slices of salt pork ; fill a dripping pan i full hot water ; 
then, if you have not a wire grate, place the gridiron on 
the pan, and after laying the fish on the gridiron cover 
all with another pan ; bake in a hot oven till the pork 
is well shrivelled ; then remove the upper tin, allowing 
your fish to brown. 1| hours will cook thoroughly, if a 
steady fire is kept. 

Mrs. E, G., Geneva. 
First, dip the fish quickly in boiling water; then 
wipe the scales off ; rinse in cold water ; wipe it dry ; 
sprinkle salt both inside and out, about as much as you 
would for steaks. Then dip it in flour : place the pan 
that you are going to bake it in in the stove with a 
piece of butter in it the size of an egg. Let it melt so 
that it covers the pan. Your pan should be about the 
length of your fish ; if larger, the butter will be apt to 
burn. Place your fish in it, the inside of it next to the 
pan. Put it in a hot oven, and bake 1 hour, if it is a 
large fish, less time if smaller. It should be well done 
and of a nice brown color. 

Mrs. S. D. L., Chicago. 
Skin and bone the fish, by running a sharp knife 
along the back. Spread over dripping-pan a thin 
layer of butter, i an onion in fine pieces. Lay the fish 
upon it, and pour over the fish 1 tablespoonful of vine- 
gar or Catawba wine. For the sauce, rub butter, the 
size of a walnut, and flour together, add a cup of the 
broth or hot water, the juice of the fish, 2 or 3 mush- 
rooms, if you have them. Turn this mixture over the 
fish, dust with bread crumbs, salt and pepper, and bake 
a few minutes or until a little brown. Garnish with 
pieces of bread cut heart-shape. 



14 COOKERY— FISH. 

Mrs. Sarah L., Chicago. 

Dry with a towel, and put belly to back in dripping- 
pan, into which you have previously cut up 2 slices of 
salt pork in inch pieces. Make a stuffing as for veal. 
Stuff, putting only a little in. Now pour over the fish 
a spoonful of lemon-juice or good vinegar. After a 
little, baste with a little soup-broth. Don't let the fish 
dry all up, and don't put a drop of water on it. Make 
your sauce as for veal cutlets, omitting the lemon 
juice, but add £ cup of milk and cut up 2 hard-boiled 
eggs into it. When done, also add the fish-juice. A 
little parsley chopped fine in the sauce, we like. Gar- 
nish with hard-boiled eggs and sprigs of parsley, 
mounted by little carpels of lemon. 
M. A. D.. Chicago. 

Take bread crumbs sufficient for the size of the fish ; 
beat 2 or 3 eggs ; pepper and salt ; add 1 bunch of pars- 
ley, fresh, and chopped fine ; mix all together well ; add 
a small piece of butter ; put all into the fish and sew up. 
If any of the dressing is left, put into the bake-pan ; 
add a pint of boiling water ; put into a hot oven ; baste 
every 10 or 15 minutes for an hour, when it will be well 
cooked and nicely flavored. 

E. L. M., Chicago. 
Buy a 2-pound white fish. If the gills are red, eyes 
full, body firm and stiff, the fish is good. Scale it, cut 
off the head, and split the fish nearly down to the tail, 
make a dressing of bread-crumbs, a little butter, pep- 
per and salt, slightly moistened with water. Stuff the 
tish with this ; then bind it together with fine cotton 
cord or tape, 3 inches apart. Lay the fish on a wire 
gridiron in a dripping-pan, and pour around it a little 
water and melted butter. With a spoon dip this up 
and pour over the fish frequently. Bake 1 hour. Serve 
with the gravy of the fish or drawn butter. 

Fried Fish. 

M. A. D., Chicago. 

When the fish is properly cleansed, instead of putting 

it into a small quantity of fat or grease, wipe dry ; then 

rub with plenty of salt and pepper ; let it lay an hour 

or two before using ; roll in corn-meal or flour ; have 



COOKERY— FISH. 15 

ready int sufficient for it to swim in ; the fat m7::t be 
boiLu.g-hot ; put the fish in whole, or cut in piec: \ It 
will come out nicely browned, and not filled with fat, 
as in the ordinary way of frying. 

Frying Fish. 
N.M.G, New York. 

The artistic mode of frying fish is what is called the 
wet process, which is simply boiling it in fat. Butter 
should never be used, as the color never is good. Lard 
is considered by many to be the best frying medium, 
but Careme. the great Trench cook, gives the prefer- 
ence to beer fat — not, however, the dripping from the 
roast, but lard made by melting beef zuet. We recom- 
mend as best and most economical drippings from the 
joints while roasting, poured into boiling water, and 
removed in a cake when cold. The great point is to 
have the fat at a proper temperature before the article 
to be fried is put m. The skillful cook can see the blue 
smoke rising just at the boiling point, and then she 
knows it is time to put in her fish ; but for those who 
are only acquiring experience it is safer to throw in a 
bit of bread, and if it takes a fine color in a minute or 
so, then the fat is hot enough, and the fish may be put 
in. This is the cardinal point of successful frying, as 
otherwise the fish will be flabby and greasy instead of 
crisp and appetizing. Another point to be attended to 
is that the fat be deep enough in the pan to cover the 
fish, which should be put in a wire basket that will fit 
easily into the pan of fat, and then no turning is re- 
quired. When done strain it into boiling water ; when 
cold take it off in a cake, and put it by to fry fish again. 
Sauces for Fish. 
Georgia H., Chicago. 

To serve with fish : 1 cup vinegar ; 1 cup water ; 
yolks 2 eggs ; 1 large spoon butter ; 1 spoonful mustard 
and corn-starch blended ; sugar, salt and pepper ; mix 
all cold ; heat it gradually and boil for a minute. This 
dressing is also nice, when cold, with salmon, lobster, 
lettuce, etc. 

Fish Sauce. 
Mrs. M. G. L., Chicago. 

Take a pint of milk and the fish drippings mixed ; a 



16 COOKERY— FISH. 

little salt and pepper ; mix until smooth, 2 ounces of 
butter and two teaspoonfuls of flour; stir into the 
liquor when boiling; have ready a hard-boiled egg, 
chopped fine, to add when ready for the table. 
Stewed Codfish. 
Mrs. C. E., Minonk, Ills. 
First, be sure and pick the meat off from the bones : 
then let it stand in water for 15 minutes ; then take it 
out of the water and put in milk. To make the quan- 
tity you may need, beat 3 eggs and put into it a pint of 
milk, a piece of butter half the size of an egg ; thicken 
this with a tablespoonful of flour stirred up with a very 
little water. As soon as it boils it is done. 

Codfish Balls. 

E. B., Coldwatcr, Mich. 

Cut up the fish into small oits, enough to make 2 even 
pints • remove every bone ; pour cold water over it to 
rinse it off, and soak in cold water about H hours ; then 
drain the water off ; put it cooking with sufficient boil- 
ing water to cover it; let it simmer, not boil, for 20 
minutes ; then drain the water all off ; pour in H pints 
of new milk ; add a lump of butter size of hen's egg. 
Take i pint of milk ; rub into it three tablespoons of 
flour— every lump must be dissolved ; stir in two eggs, 
well beaten, and a little black pepper. When the milk 
boils up, stir in this mixture ; cook 5 minutes longer, 
stirring the most of the time. Serve immediately in a ' 
warmed vegetable-dish. This quantity will be suffi- 
cient for a family of six, and enough left for codfish 
balls. 

Busy Bee, Ottumwa, Iowa. 

Pick up fine a teacupful nice white codfish, freshen 
over night in water, pour away this in the morning, add 
i teacup of fresh water, 1 large spoonful of butter, 2 
eggs, beat all well together and heat till hot, but do 
not boil ; mash and season nicely some potatoes, stir 
into the codfish mixture till stiff enough to put in flat 
cakes, and fry in hot butter a nice brown , should be 
turned once. 

E. D., Chicago. 

After dinner, take the mashed potatoes (of which 



COOKERY— FISH. 17 

there should be a double quantity prepared for dinner), 
and fish that is left, using i fish and §■ potatoes. Stir 
and beat them together while warm, till evenly mixed. 
When cold — for the mixture will be so soft it cannot be 
handled while warm — make them into cakes t inch 
thick and as large around as a teacup ; put them in a 
cool place for breakfast. In the morning, roll them in 
flour ; have plenty of butter in the frying-pan just hot 
enough not to burn ; fry quickly to a nice brown on 
both sides. Tarn carefully that they may keep their 
shape. Serve as soon as done. 

Mrs. S. W. L., Tuscola, Ills. 
Take of nice white codfish about 2 pounds ; put into 
a kettle with sufficient cold water to cover the fish, and 
let it boil till perfectly tender ; then remove to a pan of 
cold water ; the fish can then be easily separated from 
bones, skin, etc. Place in an earthen or bright tin mix- 
ing-pan, and mash fine, with about double the quantity 
of nicely steamed potatoes, and 3 or 4 slices of light 
bread crammed, or previously soaked in milk ; add 2 
eggs and a tea cup of butter, with black pepper to suit 
taste. Mash and mix thoroughly, and make as moist 
.as is wished with sweet milk. It is sometimes neces- 
sary to add a little salt. Make into- flat balls, and fry 
in hot lard, as you would mush. This mixture will 
keep in cool weather a number of days. 

Anna Bell, S'pringfiela'. 

Take 1 a codfish, put in a pot, fill with cold water at 
night, in the morning pour off the water, fill up with 
f res h water, stand it on the back of the stove for 3 hours 
let it come to a scalding heat, not boiling. Takeoff 
the skin and pick out the bones, put in a tray and chop 
fine, have potatoes boiled and chop with the fish, double 
the quantity of potatoes to the fish, mix well together, 
make - in balls, with the hands flattening them a little, 
have your frying pan hot, with a tablespoonful of lard ; 
fry to a nice brown. 

Bechamel Sauce. 
Mrs. Sarah L„ Chicago. 

This sauce is good for almost everything, such as car- 
rots, turnips, asparagus, fish, and, with sugar and wine 



18 COOKERY— POULTRY. 

or brandy added, is good for steamed puddings, cake 
pudding, rice, etc., etc. Mix cold, and well together, in 
a tin saucepan, 2 ounces of butter, a tablespoon ful of 
flour ; then acid a pint of milk ; stir continually, and, 
when thickened, take off: the fire. Beat the yolk of an 
egg in a cup, with a teaspoonful of water. Turn into 
the sauce and mix well ; salt a little and pepper for 
vegetables; but for puddings, nutmeg and brandy or 
wine. 



POULTRY. 



Selecting Fowls. 

8. H. M., Chicago. 

In selecting a goose or duck, take hold of the toes 
and pull them apart ; if the web separates easily it is 
young, but if it requires any very great amount of phy- 
sical force to separate, lay it one side — 'tis an old fowl, 
and you will reap no profit from its purchase, unless 
you are keeping boarders. Turkeys may be selected by 
pressing the end of the breast bone. If they are young 
tnere is a gristle at the end which will readily yield to 
the pressure — if old, the end will be found hard and 
sharp, and you cannot bend it. By strictly following 
these instructions no one need ever buy an old fowl. 

Broiled Chicken. 

F., Chicago. 
Split down the back ; pound lightly ; put on the grid- 
iron ; lay a tin baking-pan over the chicken ; set on the 
pan a flatiron — the weight will hold the bird in place 
and keep in the juices. Chicken cooked in this way 
will be tender and eat well warm or cold. Serve with 
with hot apple-sauce. 

Fried Chicken. 

Aunt Lucy, Chicago. 
Cut your chicken to pieces according to the size ; if 
very young, just in half; if good size, divide at the 



COOKERY— POULTRY. 19 

joints ; see that it is thoroughly cleaned. Wipe it with 
a clean bit of muslin. Beat up 2 eggs, have a plate of 
flour, dip each piece first in the flour, then in the egg, 
season with salt and pepper, here pour lard hissing hot 
in your skillet, put your chicken in ; when brown on 
one side turn it, brown the other, place upon the plat- 
ter, mix a tablespoon of flour smoothly into a cup of 
sweet milk, pour into the fat, stir, boil a few minutes, 
pour it over the chicken, and I guess anybody's hus- 
band will think it pretty good. I fry veal cutlets the 
same way. 

Boned Turkey. 
Mrs. M., Chicago. 
First, make the stuffing to suit the family taste. I 
took tenderloin — not too lean — chopped it fine ; a tea- 
cup of cracker crumbs ; 2 eggs ; a pint of oysters ; some 
summer savory ; pepper and salt ; mix all well ; had 
my large needle and stout thread handy, with some 
two-inch- wide soft bleached old cotton cloth. Now for 
your turkey. It being well cleaned and singed, be 
careful not to Break the outside skin. Cut off the legs 
so as to cut all the tendons where they join the drum- 
stick. Cut the first joint from the wing ; leave a good 
length of skin for the neck. Every bone must be taken 
out from the inside. Beginning with the legs, cut each 
ligament at the side bone joint, strip the knife close 
along the bone, so as to cut the flesh clean off, and draw 
the bone out ; when both legs are boneless, follow along 
the back, breast and wings. The neck is more difficult, 
but get it out nicely as you can. Now your turkey is 
one shapeless slump; but begin stuffing at the neck, 
from the inside ; having tied securely the skin to pre- 
vent escape, fill out the wings, breast, body and legs. 
Now sew up the skin ; bandage it in a, shapely manner 
with your strips, not too tig lit, for fear of the stuffing 
swelling so as to burst the skin : salt and pepper the 
outside and steam until perfectly tender. If it's an old 
chap steam 4 or 5 hours. When done, put a tin plate 
and a couple of flat-irons on top of it to press until cold. 
Then cut in nice thin slices. 

Mrs. S„ Fon du Lac, Wis. 
Buy a turkey, one that has not been drawn, so as to 



20 COOKERY— POULTRY. 

have no openings in it if possible ; if drawn, sewing up 
openings firmly before boning; 2 chickens, 1 beef 
tongue, 1 can oysters, 1 pound fresh, lean side pork. 
Have the turkey frozen and thawed, the tongue boiled 
and skinned, the pork roasted, the oysters taken out of 
the liquor, the chickens cut in small pieces, and put on 
to boil with just water enough to cover. Lay the tur- 
key on its breast ; cut off the legs and wings at first 
joint ; cut down the whole length of the back, and with 
a sharp knife scrape the meat at each side from the 
bones; throw the bones in with the chickens to boii. 
now for the filling : First, lay the whole tongue to form 
the breast ; clear all the chicken meat from the bones ; 
cut the pork in small pieces ; fill up your turkey, legs, 
wings and all (first tying ends of legs and wings tight), 
with chicken, pork and oysters, and a little dressing, 
have the chicken liquor well boiled and seasoned, and 
strain it into the turkey, which will form a jelly. Sew 
up the turkey firmly ; turn it over and shape it nicely 
with the hands. Tie a cord tightly to the neck, and 
draw it round and tie it to the right wing close to the 
body. Tie down legs and wings, inserting skewers if 
you have them. Sew around it a piece of strong cloth, 
and steam or roast, and leave the cloth on till cold. 
Carve cold in round, thin slices, commencing at the 
neck. 

Boiled Goose. 

Mrs. D. H. H., Chicago. 
Dress and singe, put into a deep dish, cover with 
boiling milk and leave over night. In the morning 
wash off the milk, and put the goose into cold water on 
the fire ; when boiling hot take it off, wash it in warm 
water and dry wich a cloth. This process takes out the 
oil. Fill the body with a dressing of bread crumbs sea- 
soned with pepper, salt, butter and two chopped onions, 
if relished, and a little sage. Put the goose into cold 
water and boil gently until tender. Serve with giblet 
sauce, and with pickles, or acid jellies. 

Cousin German, Chicago. 
Cook fo*ur calf's feet in 3 quarts of water slowly until 
done ; strain it. Now put goose in a pot, pour over it 
the broth of the calf's feet and so much water that the 



COOKERY— POULTRY. 21 

goose is well covered by it ; add some vinegar, spices, 
salt and onion, and the half neel of a lemon ; cover it 
and boil slow until the goose is soft. Let it cool off in 
the broth, take out the goose after it is cold, cut all the 
meat off the bones and lay it iicely in a deep earthen 
dish. Take all the fat of the broth, taste it, add more 
vinegar and salt if necessary ; let it run through a cloth, 
and pour it over the meat. It will be nice and stiff 
after 24 hours, and you eat it cold with bread or cracker. 
If you can get gelatine it will be so much simpler to 
prepare it. Boil the goose in water, vinegar and spices 
as above ; after the goose is soft add 3 ounces of gela- 
tine dissolved in cold water, and proceed just as before. 
The toughest meat will get tender, if boiled with vine- 
gar. American cooks always steam the goose before 
roasting. Try it once without steaming. Rub it with 
salt in and outside ; put a little water in your frying 
pan, and roast it in a hot oven 2 or 3 hours, according 
to the size, and if it is a young goose you will find it 
superb. 

Pressed Chicken. 

Gypsy, Ionia, Mich. 

Boil 1 chicken until tendei ; cnop fine ; season well 
with pepper, salt and butter , put into a cloth ; put a 
weight upon it and press like head cheese. 

Beatrice, Iowa. 

Boil fowls until tender. Remove the meat from the 
bones and chop very fine, keeping the dark and white 
meat separate. Boil the liquor down until it will jelly ; 
place in a deep buttered dish a layer of the dark meat ; 
season with salt and pepper and cover with liquor; 
then a layer of white meat seasoned, and cover with 
the liquor. Use the liquor when full, put a weight on 
it, and it will mold firmly. 

Maud H., Milwaukee. 

Boil a chicken thoroughly; skin it and pick it to 
pieces ; season with salt and pepper ; put in a bag, and 
place it under a press ; let it remain over night, and 
next day it will be ready for use.

Chicken Pie. 

Isadora, Monroe, Mich. 
Make the crust like baking-powder biscuit, only a 
trifle shorter. Roll half an inch thick and line a 4 
quart tin-pan with it. Have ready 2 small chickens, 
boiled till tender. Place the pieces of chicken smoothly 
in the pan ; sprinkle salt, and pepper, and a little 
flour over them ; add a few pieces of butter, size of a 
hazelnut, about a large tablespoonf ul in all ; pour on a 
little of the liquor they were boiled in ; then roll the top 
crust rather more than half -inch thick ; cut large stars 
or air-holes in it. Bake till crust is thoroughly done. 

Fried Chicken with Oysters. 

Take a nice tender chicken, open it down the back, 
and after cleaning it well pound all the bones flat; 
wash, and wipe it dry on a clean towel ; then season 
with peppei and salt, and fry slowly in sweet lard until 
tender, and a flue brown on both sides. Then put it on 
a dish where it will keep warm. Pour off the lard in 
the pan and any brown particles that may remain ; then 
add i pint of hot water and flour enough to make the 
gravy of the proper consistency. Have ready about 25 
large oysters, which remove from their liquor and put 
into the pan with the gravy ; let them simmer until 
their gills begin to shrivel, observing to stir them all of 
the time. When done, pour them over the chicken and 
send to the table hot. 

Chicken Pie. 

Cut up the chickens by unjointing them; soak 
thoroughly in weak salt water ; wash thoroughly ; put 
3 chickens into a kettle with 2 quarts of water and 3 
teaspoonfuls of salt. Boil * an hour. Make a crust by 
rubbing $ a pound of lard into , l> quarts of flour. Take 
two teacupfuls of sour cream and 7. teaspoonful and a 
half of soda; knead quite harl, and roll out half an 
inch thick. A 4-quart pudding dish will answer to 
bake in ; bring the edge of the crust a little above the 
rim of the dish ; arrange the chicken by packing closely 
around the dish ; if you are fond of pepper, sprinkle 
some over each layer of chicken ; i a pound of butter, 
cut up in lumps and scattered among the meat, is a 
great improvement when the chicken is all in the dish ; 



COOKERY— MEATS. 23 

stir some flour into the gravy and turn over the chick- 
en* then roll out the upper crust and put over the 
whole, ;unching it closely with th~ under crust that 
comes over the rim* prick le top crust for the steam 
to escape. Bake slowly for 1| hours and serve hot. It 
is delicious.

24 COOKERY— 31 EATS. 

A. E. D., Chicago. 

Have your skillet very hot, and fry your steak with 
very little butter, just long enough to brown each side. 
Fill up with boiling water, cover, and let it stew two 
hours. Take up the steak, thicken the gravy, season 
to taste, and pour over the meat. 

Mock Buck. 

Mrs. M. J. T., Chicago. 
Take the round of beefsteak, salt and pepper either 
side , prepare bread or crackers with oysters or without, 
as for stuffing a turkey ; lay your stuffing on the meat ; 
sew up and roast about an hour ; and if yon do not see 
the wings and legs you will think you have roast duck. 

To Cook Briett Beef. 

Mrs. J. M. P., LaSalle, Els. 
"\ Cut in thin slices, place it in the spider and pour hot 
water on it, thicken with a little flour and water stirred 
smoothly in. Then season with butter, salt and pep- 
per, boil about 5 minutes, and while boiling break in 1 
or 2 eggs and stir all together. Halve and butter some 
warm biscuit, place in a deep dish and pour the mix- 
ture upon them. 

Cold Meats. 
Mrs. Emily G., Eau Claire, Wis. 
Remains of boiled ham, mutton, roast beef, etc., are 
good chopped finely with hard boiled eggs, 2 heads let- 
tuce, a bit of onion, and seasoned with mustard, oil, 
vinegar, and, if needed, more salt. Fix it smoothly in 
a salad dish, and adorn the edges with sprigs of parseley 
or leaves of curled lettuce. Keep by the ice or in a 
cool place until wanted. 

Sweet Breads. 
Barry Grey, Chicago. 
Wash clean and let drip ; broil on a gridiron, or fry 
in a little butter and pepper salt and butter just before 
they are brought in. If you place them a moment in 
the oven, the seasoning seems to go through them 
better. 

Beef Spiced. 
"Old Housekeeper," Chicago. 
Spiced round: For a small round— say 25 pounds— 



COOKERY— MEATS. 25 

mix m a jar or bowl that can be covered 2 pounds com- 
mon salt ; 1 pound dark brown sugar ; i pound ground 
allspice : 1 ounce ground cloves ; two ounces black 
pepper ; one teaspoonful cayenne. A wooden bowl or 
unpainted tub, that will just hold the round, will be re- 
quired. Fill the hole from which the marrow bone was 
taken with marrow or nice fat. Bind into nice shape 
with strips of cotton and skewers. First rub with a 
tablespoonful of powdered saltpetre on both sides and 
in all crevices ; leave for 24 hours (it should be in a cool, 
dry place, that will not freeze). Then rub daily with 
some of the above mixture for 2 or 3 weeks, turning 
every 2 days and ladling its own liquor over it. When 
ready to cook the round, provide a tin dish that will 
just hold it. Place small pieces of hard wood to keep 
the meat from sticking to the tin underneath; also 
chopped vegetables, carrots, onions, celery-tops, and 
suet or drippings. Some of these should also be thickly 
strewed on the top. Cover all with a coarse paste 
rolled to keep moist and retain their flavor, and bake 6 
hours in a moderate oven. When done, take off the 
paste cover; remove the vegetables, etc., and put on 
the round heavy weights until quite cold. Slice thinly. 

Pot Pie. 

Mrs. G. B. K., Chicago. 

Boil 2 or 3 pounds of nice fat beef. When nearly 
done add some potatoes, turnips and a head of cabbage, 
cut in 8 or 10 pieces. Season with pepper and salt 
while cooking. Serve very hot with apple sauce. 

Jelly Cheese. 

Aunt Fanny, Denver. 

Two sets of pigs' feet pui into hot, salted water, suf- 
ficient to cover them; boil slowly until the meat falls 
from the bone. Then put the feet on a dish and take 
out all the bones ; cut the meat into small pieces and 
return to the kettle in which they were boiled, with the 
liquor; then season witli salt, pepper, sage, savory and 
sweet marjoram ; stir all well together, and let it sim- 
mer slowly 20 minutes; then put into deep dishes. 
When cold, cut into slices, eat cold or hot, with vinegar. 



26 COOKERY— MEATS. 

Head Cheese. 

. Aunt Fanny, Denver. 
Clean the legs nicely and boil by themselves, so that 
when done there will be plenty of the liquor. Boil the 
upper head, minus ears, eyes and nose, with consider- 
able lean meat, tenderloin is best, and when done re- 
move bones and skin from head and legs; chop the 
lean ; salt and pepper to suit the taste ; add the liquor 
the legs were boiled in, and last, but not least, a tea- 
cupful of vinegar and a teacupful of catsup to every 
gallon. When thoroughly cold it can be cut out in 
slices. 

Pudding Chop. 

Mrs. F B. P., Chicago. 
One pound salt pork, skin off the rind, chop fine with 
2 pounds of bread crumbs, moisten with water until 
thin enough to stir like cake dough ; add 3 eggs well 
beaten, pepper, 1 teaspoon ful of soda dissolved in 
water ; add a little flour ; turn this mixture into a pud- 
ding-dish and bake one hour, with slow fire. Serve hot 
or cold. 

To Make Sausage. 

Mrs. J. T. S., Bloomington, Ills. 
"For every 12 pounds of meat use 6 ounces of salt, 1 
ounce of black pepper, a tablespoonful of powdered 
saltpeter, half a teaspoonf ul of red pepDer, and 4 ounces 
of sage. The sage and red pepper are not essential, 
and may be omitted by those who do not fancy them. 
These proportions should be tried on a small scale first, 
before seasoning the whole batch, to see whether it 
suits. 

To Cook Tongue. 

Georgia H., Chicago. 

French receipt for cooking tongue : After boiling it 

as usual, until tender, cut into small pieces and brown 

with flour and butter. Then add some of the stock ; 

season highly ; let it boil a few moments and serve hot. 

Croquettes. 

'■'■Sojourner, ' ' Minneapolis. 
Cold bits of meat can be finely chopped, and with 



COOKERY— MEATS. 27 

bread crumbs, salt and pepper added, mixed with gravy 
or milk, and made mto balls or croquettes, and deli- 
cately browned in a skillet for tea. This same pre- 
pared meat need not be recooked, but put into a bowl, 
pressed with a heavy weight for a few hours, and then 
sliced down like "head-cneese" for tea, called "pressed 
meat." 

Veal Loaf. 
Mrs. H. JR., Galesburg, IUs. 
Two pounds veal, chopped fine ; 2 coffee-cups bread 
crumbs ; 2 eggs ; 1 even tablespoon of salt and pepper 
mixed; sage to taste; a little butter; bake about 1 
hour ; slice quite thin. The secret of having it slice off 
thin, without breaking, is pressing it down very firmly 
in the dish before baking. 

Baked Veal-Ham. 

&. C, Dubuque, Iowa. 
Bone a breast of veal. Chop the meat very fine. 
Chop an equal quantity of cold boiled ham, and boil 6 
eggs and chop line. Butter a deep pan. Put in a 
layer of veal, sprinkle with salt, pepper, thyme, and 
anchovy or Worcestershire sauce, and then a layer of 
ham sprinkled with the egg. Fill the dish with al- 
ternate layers. Use both fat and lean of the ham. 
Cover and bake slowly 4 hours. When done, lay on it 
a heavy weight. Serve in thin slices. 

Veal Collops. 

Mrs. A. M., Milwaukee. 
Cut part of a leg of veal into pieces 3 or 4 inches 
broad, sprinkle flour on them, fry in butter until brown, 
and then turn in water enough to cover the veal. 
When it boils take off the scum, put in 2 or 3 onions, a 
blade of mace, a little salt and pepper, ana stew until 
tender ; then take up the meat, thicken the gravy with 
flour and water mixed smoothly together, squeeze in 
the juice of a lemon — or a very good ^bstitute is a 
teaspoonful of catsup — and turn the mixture over the 
brown collops. Garnish with thin slices of lemon. 
Irish Stew. 
Mrs. Frank G., Marquette. 
Take lean mutton, potatoes and onions ; first put in 



28 COOKERY— MEATS. 

a deep kettle a layer of potatoes cut in slices, then a 
layer of onions, then mutton, and be sure all the fat is 
cut off; then another layer of potatoes, onions and 
mutton ; and finish by potatoes on top. Between each 
layer sprinkle salt, pepper and a little flour. Then put 
in enough water to cook without burning; cook 4 
hours, and do not stir it up, but let it cook slowly on 
the top of the stove, with a hot fire, and it won't burn. 

Mutton Dinner. 

Mrs. M. E. ilf., Evanston. 
Take 3 pounds of mutton, cut in small pieces,(if you 
skin mutton it loses the strong flavor), put it on the 
stove in cold water ; when half done put in a teacup of 
rice. Pepper and salt to taste. Have water enough 
for soup. Make a nice biscuit crust, cut in diamonds, 
and 20 minutes before dinner drop them around on the 
top of the soup, and cover very closely ; or steam if you 
prefer This, with a dish of nice potato salad and an 
apple pie, makes a very good though not a stylish din- 
ner. 

Pork Tenderloin. 

Barry Grey, Chicago. 
Cut the tenderloin open ; stew in water till nearly 
done, then, with a little butter hissing in a spider, fry 
to a light brown— not too hard ; have a small piece of 
toast buttered for each piece of meat ; place the meat 
on the toast, pepper and salt, and then throw a thin 
milk gravy over all. We call it "quail on toast," and 
think it a very good substitute. 

Baked Ham. 

Busy Bee, Ottumwa, Iowa. 
Make a crust of water and flour ; roll half an inch 
thick ; soak your ham over night and scrape well ; then 
cover nice and tight with the crust, so the juice cannot 
escape, and bake it till done. Then remove all the 
crust and serve. 

Boiled Ham. 
Mrs. J. P. H., Chicago. 
Clean thoroughly before cutting for any purpose. To 
boil, put in kettle of cold water, boil slowly till tender, 



COOKERY— MEATS. 29 

and if intended to be eaten when cold, let it remain in 
the kettle jnst as it was cooked until cold. 

Beef a la Mode. 

Mrs. Sarah L., Chicago. 
Buy a good roast — the tenderloin. Have the butcher 
put in a good piece of fat before he skewers it. Put in 
your ham boiler, or a kettle that can be hermetically 
(air tight) closed, an inch-thick slice of salt pork cut in 
small pieces, a pound of veal, a piece of butter, some 
salt, 2 or 3 cloves, some whole pepper, one onion cut in 
quarters, and one carrot quartered lengthwise. Lay 
the roast in, pour over a spoonful of vinegar, close and 
set over the fire ; not too hot. In about 10 minutes add 
a cup of water, and turn the meat. In 15 another cup, 
and in 20 more another. Turn occasionally, but keep 
closed. Simmer slowly 4 hours. When done, carefully 
place upon a platter, putting a piece of carrot on each 
side, top and bottom. Turn all the grease out of the 
kettle, pour 2 tablespoonfuls of water into the kettle, 
give another boil, and turn over the meat. 

Beef Stew. 

G. M., Tiffin, Ohio. 
In a stew-pan place a large tablespoonf ul of butter, 
in which fry until quite brown 2 sliced onions, adding 
while cooking 12 whole cloves ; ditto allspice ; i a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and i that quantity of black pepper. 
Take from fire, pour in a pint of cold water, wherein 
lay 2 or 3 pounds of tender , lean beef cut in small, thick 
pieces. Cover closely, and let all stew gently 2 hours, 
adding just before serving a little flour thickening. A 
few sprigs of sweet basil is an improvement. 

Beef Loaf. 

X. Y. Z., Hudson, Mich. 
31 pounds of round steak chopped fine, 1 cup rolled 
crackers, 2 eggs, 1 cup milk, 1 teaspoon pepper,l table- 
spoon salt, piece of butter size of an egg. Bake 3£ 
hours. 

Meat Pie. 
Mary Moore, Chicago. 
In a 3-pint basin place a thick layer of stale bread, 
broken or chopped fine ; on this a layer of boiled beef. 



30 COOKERY— MEATS. 

sliced and seasoned with pepper and a pinch of powd- 
ered sage and parseley (the meat was salted enough 
when boiling) ; next a thick layer of bread again ; then 
thoroughly moisten the whole with the broth of the 
beef, and bake half an hour in a moderate oven. The 
bottom of the pan should first be greased. 3 layers fill 
the pan full. 

Veal Pot Pie. 
Rizpah, Fon du Lac, Wis. 
Cut in pieces 2 pounds of veal and boil in water until 
tender; season and add 6 potatoes sliced; boil until 
done and pour in a deep pan. Stir in a spoonful of 
flour and cover with a crust made like biscuit. Bake a 
light brown, but be sure to have plenty of gravy in the 
pie. 

Veal Pie. 

Sympathizer, Peoria, Ills. 
Into 2 quarts of flour put teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder ; sift, and add 1 teacupfnl of lard, wet up with 
i pint of milk and f of a pint of water ; knead but 
little, roll out fc of the dough £ of an inch in thickness, 
and cut out the upper crust a little larger than the pan 
you bake in. { I use a pressed-tin milk-pan 12i inches 
in diameter and 3J deep, and this quantity for crust is 
just enough). With the rest of the dough line the pan, 
pressing it well up around the edge; bake 10 or 15 
minutes. -' hours before you make the crust, cut 3 or 
4 pounds of veal into pieces less than 2 inches in thick- 
ness ; those with bone (if any) should first be placed in 
the kettle, then the others, and cover with boiling 
water. As soon as the crust is the oven, season the 
veal, after removing the largest bones, with salt, pep- 
per, and butter size of an egg ; chicken with flour and 
milk, allowing gravy enough to cover the meat. When 
the undercrust is done, fill it with all of the meat, and 
all the gravy it will hold without running over, while 
you add the top crust ; cut an opening in the center of 
this, and return to the oven for 15 or minutes, or 
until the upper crust is baked through and browned 
slightly. Send to the table in the pan to be carved 
there. An earthen dish is nicer, but they bake slower 
The rest of the gravy will be needed at the table.

Veal Cutlets. 

Mrs. Sarah L., Chicago. 
The way I cook cutlets and chops is to bake them. 
The great object is to have veal and mutton thoroughly 
cooked, and by baking you best accomplish that object. 
Take your dripping-pan, rub a little butter over each 
cutlet, salt and pepper, and lay Mat in pans ; place in 
hot oven, and cover with another pan of same size. 
When done, if you like, make a sauce called butter 
maitre d-'hotel. Rub to a soft paste a small piece of 
butter with flour ; pour over i cup boiling hot water. 
It will then thicken ; then add a teaspoonful of lemon- 
juice ; pour over cutlets and serve. It's good for 
dinner. 

Pork Chops. 

Remove the skin, trim and dip in beaten egg, then 
in cracker-crumbs seasoned with salt, pepper, onion 
and sage. Fry in hot lard 20 minutes, turning often. 



GAME 



Broiled quail. 

Mrs. W. H. P., Peabody, Kansas. 

ACH quail should be carefully picked, cut open 
down the back, and pounded slightly with the 
steak-pounder, to break the bones, so they will 
lie flat on the gridiron ; salt and pepper them, 
and broil to a nice brown ; have a pan of melted butter 
ready to dip each piece in as soon as cooked. Have 
ready slices of bread, toasted to a light brown, and well 
buttered. Lay a quail on each slice of the toast, then 
pour the butter which they were dipped in over the 
whole. Serve hot. 

Wild. Pigeons Stewed. 

Emily W., Carondalet. 

Clean and wash, then lay in salt water for an hour. 



32 COOKERY— GAME. 

Rinse the inside with a solution of soda and water. 
Wash out with clear water, and stuff with bread and 
pork, chopped fine and seasoned. Sew up birds, and 
put on to cook in cold water sufficient to cover them, 
adding a slice of pork to each bird. Season to taste. 
Cook till tender ; when done, place in a covered dish ; 
strain the gravy, add juice of a lemon, a tablespoonful 
currant jelly, and thicken with flour ; boil up, and pour 
over birds. 

Roast Wild Duels.

stuff with usual dressing ; roast till brown and tender, 
"basting with butter- water and drippings ; to the gravy 
add tablespoon currant jell, and thicken with browned 
flour. 

To Cook Venison. 
Observer, Bock Springs, Wis. 

Boil till tender, with sufficient water to keep from 
burning ; when done put in some butter, pepper and 
salt ; let it brown in the kettle , it retains all the flavor 
of the meat. That is the best way to cook roasts of 
beef ; you then have juicy, tender meat. 

Turkey Gravy. 

Mrs. J. D. W., Chicago. 
Heart, liver, gizzard and neck slashed and dredged 
thickly with flour. Put in a sauce pan with a little 
salt, a few peppercorns and allspice, and a little mace ; 
outside skin of 3 onions, lump of butter the size of a 
walnut. When well browned, add boiling water till of 
proper thinness ; let it cook slowly on the back part of 
the stove all the morning. After removing the turkey 
from the dripping-pan and pouring off any greese. put 
the prepared gravy into the dripping-pan. and proceed 
to make gravy same as any gravy. .

Stewed Oysters. 

Mrs. John B. D., Chicago. 

jUT 1 quart of oysters into 3 quarts of boiling 
water, and pepper and salt to suit the taste. 
Leave the oysters in long enough to become 
heated through (as oysters should never be boiled). 
Then skim into the tureen. Now put in 1 pint of sweet 
cream, 12 crackers, and a good sized lump of butter, 
liquid. Let it come to a boil, and then pour into the 
tureen and send to the table. 

Mrs. G. S., Rock River Falls. 
To 1 can of oysters I allow 3 quarts of boiling water. 
I pour the boiling water over the oysters, and let the 
scum raise, and skim it off before seasoning. I then 
add £ tea cup of sweet cream. Butter, salt and pepper 
to taste. Ousters take a great deal of salt. Let come 
to boil as quick as possible, but do not boil. 

I>elnionico's Stews. 

The following is the formula used at the celebrated 
restaurants of Delmonico in New York, where, it is 
said, the finest oyster stews in the world are obtainable: 

"Take 1 quart of liquid oysters, put the liquor (a tea- 
cupful for 3 persons) in a stew-pan, and add i as much 
more water ; salt, a good bit of pepper, a teaspoonful 
of butter for each person, and a teaspoonful of rolled 
cracker for each. Put on the stove and let it boil ; have 
the oysters ready in a bowl. The moment the liquor 
begins to boil pour in all the oysters, say 10 for each 
person. Now watch carefully, and as soon as it begins 
to boil, count just 30 seconds, and take the oysters 
from the stove. Have a big dish ready with H table- 
spoonfuls of cold milk for each person. Pour the stew 
on this milk and serve immediately. Never boil an 
oyster if you wish it to be good."

Invalids' Oyster Soup. 

Mrs. S. C. H., Chicago. 

Procure the largest oysters ; remove 6 from the can, 
1 at a time, to a plate. Insert a fork into the solid 
flesh, and with a sharp knife make a slit up and down 
and across the abdominal cavity ; slip the point of the 
knife under the dark mass thus exposed and thorough- 
ly remove it, being as nice about it as you would in 
dressing any other fish, for the abdominal foulness of 
one is as unsuited to the stomach as the other. Put 
into stew-pan ; pour out proper share of liquor, a pint 
of water and £ gill of cream ; add salt ; pepper, if there 
be no fever ; a teaspoonful of lemon juice, or 2 of pure 
cider vinegar. Bring just to the boil and pour into a 
dish. Break in cracker or nicely toasted thin slice of 
light bread. A little fresh butter makes it richer. 

Escolloped Oysters. 

Ivoline, Baltimore, Md. 
To 2 quarts of fine oysters, 12 fresh crackers powder- 
ed fine, 1 cupful of oyster juice, 1 cupful of milk, a 
piece of butter the size of an egg, a little pepper and 
salt. Place alternate layers of oysters and crackers in 
a deep earthen dish, seasoning each layer of oysters 
with pepper and salt ; when the dish is full, put the 
butter on top of the cracker crumbs, and pour the 
oyster juice and milk over all ; set in a moderate oven 
and bake 50 minutes. 

Jessie, Joliet, 1U. 
First, lift your oysters from the liquor ; then put in a 
deep dish, alternate layers o. rolled crackers and oysters, 
putting on each layer of oysters a little salt, pepper, 
and a little butter. Be sure and have your first and last 
layer consist of crackers. After you have the desired 
quantity in your dish, pour a sufficient amount of the 
liquor over the top to thoroughly moisten the crackers ; 
put into a moderate oven and bake about 20 minutes. 

Oyster Pie.

a considerable quantity of liquor, for the crust soaks 
the liquor up; cover with a top crust — no bottom: 
bake quick, and serve hot. Cold sliced meats prepared 
the same way are very good. 

Escolloped Oysters. 

Shirley Dare, Bryan, Ohio. 
Crush the desired quantity of crackers ; put a layer 
in the bottom of a buttered dish -, wet this with a mix- 
ture of the oyster-liquor and milk slightly warm ; next 
a layer of oysters ; sprinkle them with salt and pepper, 
and lay bits of butter upon them ; then another layer 
of moistened crumbs, and so on. Let the top layer be 
of crumbs thicker than the rest, and beat an egg in the 
milk poured over them. Stick bits of butter thickly 
over it ; cover the dish, and bake 40 minutes ; remove 
the cover and brown by setting it on the upper grate of 
the oven for a few minutes. 

Cream Oysters. On the Halt-Shell. 

Pour into a pan 1 cup of hot water, 1 cup milk, and 1 
of cream (or 3 cupfuls of milk). Set it in a kettle of 
hot water until it boils ; stir in 2 tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter, and pepper and salt to suit ; take from the tire and 
stir in 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of corn-starch, wet up 
in cold milk. Have the shells cleaned and buttered 
and laid in a baking-pan ; place an oyster in each shell ; 
stir the cream hard and till carefully ; bake 5 or 6 min- 
utes after the shells are warm. If shells are not easily 
obtained, patty-pans or small sauce-dishes answer 
every purpose. Serve in the shell or dishes. 

Fried Oysters. 

Dip each oyster in beaten egg ; then in rolled cracker 
or corn-meal, and fry quickly in hot butter. 

Oyster Sauce. 

Louise, Chicago. 
Take 12 good oysters, 6 ounces good melted butter, a 
little red pepper, 3 tablespoons of cream. Stir all 
together over a slow lire, bring to a boil, and then serve. 

Chowder.

delicate brown ; remove, and cut in pieces ; then in the 
pork fat fry 3 or 4 good-sized onions sliced thin ; have 
ready 12 potatoes, pared and sliced, also 4 or 5 cakes of 
hard bread; put the hard bread to soak (whole) in 
some cold water; then take the soup-kettle and put 
first a layer of pork, then of onions, next of potatoes, 
and finally of clams or fish, as the case may be, and so 
on alternately, seasoning highly with pepper and salt ; 
and lastly, putting a layer of the soaked hard bread on 
top ; first cover with water and boil 20 minutes. 

Octavia, Amboy, III. 
For a can of clams, pare and cut in thin slices pota- 
toes to nearly fill a quart measure ; put 3 or 4 thin 
slices of nice salt pork in the kettle in which the 
chowder is to be cooked ; when the pork is about half 
fried, put a layer of the sliced potatoes over the pork, 
then a layer of clams, then a layer of Boston crackers 
which have been split open and slightly buttered and 
dipped quickly in cold water ; then potatoes, clams, 
and crackers again, until all is in the kettle. Now 
sprinkle over a little salt and pepper, and afterwards 
pour on milk, or, if milk is not plenty, milk and water, 
to just cover the whole. Let boil very gently, closely 
covered, without stirring, for about half an hour, or 
until the potatoes are done. Then remove carefully 
to a tureen for the table. The pork prevents the mass 
from sticking to the kettle, and helps to season the 
chowder. Fresh fish chowder made in this way, with 
milk, is delicious. 

Myrtle, Chicago. 
Clam or fish : 1 quart water ; 2 slices pork ; 2 ordin- 
ary-sized onions, sliced thin. Boil 20 minutes ; add 6 
quartered potatoes ; 1 pound halibut laid on the top ; 
put in butter, pepper and salt to taste — the higher 
seasoned the better ; thicken with a little flour ; stew 
$ an hour. Just before taking up put in a pint of oys- 
ter crackers, and you have a genuine chowder, a la 
seaside.

SALADS. 



Chicken Salad. 

Ella, Chicago. 

f AKE the breasts of 2 chickens ; 2 large bunches 
of celery and 4 hard-boiled eggs; chop these 
separately and fine; put together and mix 
thoroughly. Then make a gravy of 1 table- 
spoonful of mustard ; 2 tablespoonf ills of sugar ; 1 cup 
of vinegar; and \ cup of butter; pour hot over the 
salad. 

Mary, Chicago, 
Boil a chicken, seasoned in cooking, until it parts 
readily from the bone ; pour off the liquor. When the 
fowl is cold, pick it from the bones and chop line in a 
wooden bowl. Use the same quantity of celery or 
cabbage cut with a knife and the chopped whites of 2 
hard-boiled eggs. Mix, and put away until with- 
in an hour of using, when the following previously- 
prepared dressing must be mixed with it: Beat the 
yolks and whites of 2 eggs separately ; into that stir 
3 tablespoonfuls of melted butter or table oil ; 1£ tea- 
spoons of salt ; 2 teaspoons of celery salt or seed ; 1 
tablespoon of hard butter, and f of a teacup of vine- 
gar. Cook in an earthen or new tin dish until as thick 
as pound-cake. When cold, add £ of a teacup of sweet 
milk or cream. 

Potato Salad. 

C. L. D. B., Chicago. 
Take medium-sized potatoes; boil; let them get 
cold ; then slice them ; put in a medium-sized onion, 
chopped fine ; take a teacup £ full of best cider-vine- 
gar, into which put a tablespoonful of sweet oil ; heat 
the vinegar and oil very hot ; pour over the potatoes 
and onions, and stir all together with a salad spoon ; 
then let it get cold, and you have a fine potato salad.

Bean Salad. 

M. L. H., Elgin, III. 

Cover the bottom of your salad-dish with cold boiled 
potatoes, sliced thin ; over this spread a layer of cold 
baked (or boiled) beans, and above this a layer of 
onions, sliced very thin ; salt and pepper each layer ; 
heat a piece of butter the size of a walnut in sufficient 
vinegar to cover the salad, and pour over it while hot. 
Cabbage Salad. 
Mrs. Gen. W., Chicago. 

Take 1 head of nice cabbage and chop very fine with 
salt, after which set it away for a few days. Then 
drain off all the water, and add 1 tablespoon of mus- 
tard seed, and enough vinegar to cover, and boil it i 
hour. This is to be eaten cold. 

Lobster Salad. 

Winnie, Charleston. 

Boil a hen lobster; when done remove the meat 
from the shell ; mince it ; rub the coral to a smooth 
paste with a tablespoon of olive oil or melted butter ; 
add the grated yolks of 3 hard-boiled eggs ; 1 teaspoon 
of mustard ; salt and pepper to taste ; a wine-glass of 
good cider vinegar ; mix the sauce with the meat ; add 
a third as much with lettuce or celery, cut fine, just 
before serving. Salmon salad may be made the same 
way, garnished with lemon, sliced thin, and parseley 
or celery. 

Cream Salad. 
\Marion, Racine, Wis, 

Chop fine I a head of cabbage ; into it stir a little 
salt and \ a cup of thick cream ; heat i a cup of vine-

WO cups cold mashed potatoes ; bits of some 
kind of cold meat hashed ; 2 tablespoons melted 
butter ; 2 well-beaten eggs ; 1 cup milk ; pour 
into a deep dish and bake in a quick oven ; if 
rightly done, will merit its name. 

Busy Bee, Ottumwa, Iowa. 
Take cold beef or lean meat of any kind ; cut in 
small bits ; season with salt and pepper ; boil and 
mash some potatoes ; make into paste with 1 or 2 eggs ; 
roll out with a dust of flour ; cut with a saucer ; put 
the cut-meat on i of crust ; fold the other over, and 
pinch together ; fry brown in butter. 

Potatoes a la Crenie. 

Mrs. E. D. G, H., Grand Rapids, Mich. 
Put into a saucepan 2 ounces butter, a dessertspoon- 
ful of flour, some parseley and scallions (both chopped 
small), salt and pepper. Stir them together ; add a 
wineglass of cream, and set on the stove, stirring con- 
stantly until it boils. Cut some boiled potatoes into 
slices and put into the pan with the mixture, and boil 
all together, and serve very hot. 

Steamed Potatoes. 

Mrs. Sarah L., Chicago. 
Steam or boil dry a quart of sound potatoes ; then 
peel and mash in a sauce-pan, and mix an ounce of 
butter ; set over the tire, pouring in slowly nearly i a 
pint of milk ; stir to prevent scorching ; dish into a 
common earthen dish, scollop and put in quick oven 
to brown ; set on table in same dish. This is the most 
palatable way of cooking potatoes, especially in the 
spring.

Fancy Mashed Potatoes. 

Mrs. H. Frank B., Chicago. 

Peel 2 quarts potatoes, and when they are cooked, 
turn off every drop of water, put in a little salt, pep- 
per and butter ; then take a carving-fork and break 
them up a little ; next add a little more butter, say, in 
the whole, a piece as large as an egg, and nearly a cup 
of nice milk or cream. Now take a silver fork, or 
3-pronged one, and beat them briskly 5 minutes, or 
until light and creamy. They must be carried imme- 
diately to the table, or they will become heavy and 
clammy. If once tried this way you will never again 
resort to the old " masher." Remember, they must 
be served immediately. 

To Boil. 

Marian Warren, Chicago. 
In boiling potatoes, when they are not previously ' 
pared, always have a ring of the skin a I of an inch 
peeled from end to end. This is not a " notion," but 
the escape of the water, and consequently the meali- 
ness of the potato, is very much promoted by it. It 
does no harm to cut large potatoes in halves or quar- 
ters before boiling. 

Fried Potatoes. 

Mrs. D. S. F., Rockford. 

Peel, then slice rather thin into cold water. If very 
thin, they may be too crisp. Let them stand in the 
water a short time, and then drain through a colander ; 
have ready on the stove a kettle of hot lard, as for 
fried cakes ; put in part of the potatoes and cover the 
kettle ; stir them occasionally ; when done they should 
be a delicate brown ; skim out into any dish, and 
sprinkle a little salt over them. When the second 
batch of potatoes is partly cooked, let me advise you 
to ring your bell, as they will be cooked by the time 
the first lot is disposed of, and are much better hot. 
Boiled- Baked Sweet Potatoes. 
Nannie C, Lake View. 

Boil your potatoes until tender ; then slice several 
times the long way of the potato ; place a layer of the 
slices on the bottom of an earthen dish ; sprinkle 



COOKERY— VEGETABLES. 41 

lightly with white sugar, and heavily with lumps of 
butter (it is the butter that makes it nice) ; then an- 
other layer of potatoes, and so on, until you have the 
sugar and butter for a top layer ; then bake 30 or 40 
minutes. 

Egg Plant. 
Mrs. EnoSy Evansville, Ind. 
To cook egg-plant, slice the plant i inch thick ; 
sprinkle with salt ; place layer upon layer, and let 
stand 15 minutes ; dip in a batter and fry in butter 
and lard. Another good way is to dip in egg and roll 
in crushed cracker and fry same way. 

Corn Oysters. 
M. H., Chicago. 
Six ears of sweet corn (those which are not too old) ; 
with a sharp knife split each row of the corn in the 
center of the kernel lengthwise ; scrape out all the 
pulp ; add 1 egg, well beaten, a little salt, 1 table- 
spoonful of sweet milk ; flour enough to make a pretty 
stiff batter ; drop in hot lard, and fry a delicate brown. 
If the corn is quite young, omit the milk, using as 
little flour as possible. 

Asparagus. 

Mrs. Sarah I/., Chicago. 
Scrape. Put in water and salt, and at first boil ; 
drop in the asparagus ; boil till tender. Sauce : 1 yolk 
of egg mixed with a teaspoonful of water ; a piece of 
butter added, and when hot, stir in 2 tablespoonfuls 
of milk ; pour over the drained asparagus. 

Baked Beans. 
Mrs. J57-, Kalamazoo. 
Take as many beans as you think you want ; wash, 
boil till tender, and add salt, pepper, and molasses to 
taste. If you like them greasy, put in tw right smart " 
of pork ; a small piece will answer. Bake in covered 
dish of any sort. 

Boston Baked Beans. 

Mrs. H. V. JR., Chicago. 
Wash ; then par-boiLl an hour ; then bake all day or 
night. As to the seasoning, it is much a matter of 



42 COOKERY— VEGETABLES. 

taste. Some like them with a good deal of fat, and 
into a pot that would hold a quart of beans, would put 
£ a pound of pork (salt), cutting through the rind as if 
to slice, then laying it at the top, so that the rind may 
become nicely brown. Then some add a tablespoon- 
ful of molasses. We do not believe much in pork, so 
only put in a very thin slice of it, adding a little salt 
and omitting the sweetening. 

D. £>., Belvidcre, III. 

Take 1 pint of beans and let them soak over night 
in a quart of cold water ; in the morning pour the 
water off, and let them stand about an hour in fresh 
water on top of the stove, and then remove to a regu- 
lar " Boston bean-pot, 11 not a common yellow dish, as 
half of the western people do, and lay i a pound of 
salt pork (not too fat) across the top of them and 2 
tablespoon!' uls of New Orleans molasses, and cover all 
with water, and put in the oven, and let them bake 
until the middle of the afternoon, during the day 
adding water as it cooks away ; and for Sunday morn- 
ing's (breakfast set the bean-pot in the oveii again 
(with your beans undisturbed from the night before), 
and add a cup of hot water, and let them remain about 
an hour, and you will find them delicious. Serve with 
a loaf of brown bread, and you can imagine yourself 
eating a Boston breakfast. I make a sweet sauce 
from ripe tomatoes, which eaten upon beans, gives 
them a great relish. I advise those who never tried 
it, for meats or beans, to immediately make a large 
jar full for winter. 

Baked Beans. 
Mrs. H. Frank B., Chicago. 

For a family of 4 or 5, take 1 quart of beans, the 
smaller the better, and soak them 10 or 12 hours ; then 
put in 1 pound of salt pork, not too lean ; put them in 
a deep jar or " crock," and sink the pork in the beans 
all but the rind, which must be scored, or gashed, 
about I an inch apart ; cover the whole with the water 
the beans were soaked in ; if not enough, add more 
cold water, a little salt and pepper, and bake 10 or 12 
hours. I put mine in the oven at 6 p.m., and cook 
them all night with a slow fire. Some put in a table- 



COOKERY— VEGETABLES. 43 

spoonful of molasses. This will make 2 good meals, 
and the more they are warmed over the better they 
are. 

Fried Tomatoes. 

Take large green tomatoes ; cut off both ends, and 
then cut up 1 in 3 slices. Have some butter in the 
frying-pan ; let it get hot ; then roll the tomatoes in 
flour and lay them in the pan ; salt, pepper, and 
sprinkle a little sugar on while frying ; cook till they 
are done nice and brown, and you will have a most 
delicious article for breakfast. 

Egg Plant. 
Mrs. T. G. E., Chicago. 

Cut slices {- an inch thick, and pare, when first 
starting breakfast. Rub salt lightly over the top of 
each slice and let stand in a pile till the brine starts ; 
then shake off the salt and dip each slice, both sides, 
into flour well , stand in a pile till the flour is moist, 
then fry in a little lard in the frying-pan, like one 
would griddle-cakes. When brown, take up and spread 
a little butter on top of each slice. 

Cooking Egg Plant. 

Mrs. C. G. S., Chicago. 
To cook egg plant — Slice and leave in salt water a 
short time before using ; dip in beaten e^g ; after, in 
corn-meal or cracker crumbs ; fry brown in butter and 
lard. 

To Cook r -3' Peas. 

Kit, Crete, Neb. 
Choose the green, wrinkled peas; soak a pint of 
them over night ; set them on the stove early in the 
morning with cold water enough to cover them well ; 
simmer very gently, adding cold water as they evapo- 
rate. Do not let them boil, and they will come to the 
table whole and sound. Do not salt until they are 
done, and they will be as tender as June peas. A little 
butter is all the dressing they will need. 

Hominy Fritters. 

E. L. M., Chicago. 
Two teacupf uls of cold boiled hominy ; stir in 1 tea- 
cupful of sweet milk and a little salt, 4 tablespoonfuls 



44 COOKERY— VEGETABLES. 

of sifted flour and 1 egg. Beat the white separately 
and add last. Have over the fire a pan of hot lard ; 
drop the batter in by spoonfuls, and fry a nice brown. 
This is especially designed for a breakfast side dish, 
and rice is good used in place of the hominy. 
Boiled Hominy. 
E. L. M., Chicago. 

Boiled : Soak 1 cup of fine hominy in 3 cups of 
water, with salt to taste. In the morning turn it into 
a quart pail, then put the pail into a kettle of boiling 
water, cover tightly, and steam 1 hour ; then add 1 
teacup of sweet milk, and boil 15 minutes after stir- 
ring the milk in. 

Hulled Corn. 
F. S. P., Moline. 

Take 3 quarts corn, 3 quarts unleeched wood 
ashes (or i pound potash) ; to ashes or potash add 6 
quarts water, which boil and skim ; strain lye into 
kettle ; put in the corn ; boil until skins break 
from kernels easily, stirring frequently ; skim out the 
corn, rinse it several times, rubbing thoroughly last 
time ; leave it to soak in clear water 10 minutes, when 
rub off black chits ; rinse again ; put back into kettle, 
cover with water, boil slowly till soft ; keep hot water 
to add until boiled tender ; salt. Eat with cream and 
sugar. 

" Domin Nopinee.*' 

Take a i pint of yellow corn ; roast it like coffee over 
a slow fire ; clean out the coffee-mill ; grind 1 coarse, 
1 fine ; eat with milk and a little salt, after it has stood 
5 or 10 minutes to swell. 

Succotash. 

Aunt Eliza, Andover, Ct. 
Take 1 quart Lima beans, i pound pork, 1£ dozen 
ears sweet corn (green) ; boil the pork 1£ hours in 3 
quarts of water, putting in the beans when the pork 
has boiled I an hour. Cut the corn off, putting it in 
1 dish ; into another scrape the milk from the cobs. 
When the beans are nearly done, put in the corn, and 
boil 15 minutes ; then add the milk from the cobs, 
boiling all 10 minutes longer. It should be a little 



COOKERY— VEGETABLES. 45 

thicker than gruel. Stir all the time after adding the 
milk, or it will burn. If not sweet enough, add 
sugar. 

Scolloped Tomatoes. 
Peel, slice and pack in a pudding dish in alternate 
layers, with a thick layer of bread crumbs mixed with 
butter, salt, pepper and a little white sugar. When 
the dish is nearly full, put tomatoes uppermost ; lay a 
piece of butter on each slice ; dust with pepper, salt 
and sugar ; cover lightly with crumbs and bake cov- 
ered i an hour ; remove lid and bake brown. 

Boiled Cabbage. 

Jennie June. 
Strip off the outside leaves ; cut in quarters, and lay 
for an hour in cold water ; cover with boiling water 
and cook 15 minutes ; turn off the water and cover 
with fresh boiling water ; cook until tender, perhaps 
an hour ; drain well ; chop and stir in a tablespoonf ul 
of butter, pepper and salt. Serve hot. Some prefer 
to boil a piece of pork with the cabbage. It will give 
a delicious flavor. 

Baked Cabbage. 

Cook as for boiled cabbage, after which drain and 
set aside until cold. Chop line, add 2 beaten eggs, a 
tablespoon of butter, pepper, salt, 3 tablespoons rich 
cream ; stir well, and bake in a buttered dish until 
brown. Eat hot. 

<jireen Peas. 

Shell and lay in cold water for an hour ; put into 
salted boiling water and cook i an hour. Drain well, 
and season with butter and pepper. 

Baked Onions. 

Wash, but do not peel the onions ; boil 1 hour in 
boiling water, slightly salt, changing the water twice 
in the time. When tender, drain on a cloth and roll 
each in buttered tissue paper, twisted at the top, and 
bake an hour in a slow oven. Peel and brown them. 
Serve with melted butter.

Escolloped Onions. 
Miss Lee Any, Alton, 111. 

Boil till tender 6 large onions. Afterwards sepa- 
rate them with a large spoon ; then place a layer of 
onions and a layer of grated bread crumbs alternately 
in a pudding dish. Season with pepper and salt to 
taste ; moisten with milk ; put in the oven to brown. 

Cracked Wheat. 

Small Housekeeper, at Home. 
Stir 5 large heaping spoonfuls of the crushed white 
wheat sold by grocers into a quart of boiling water, 
and set the tin pail holding it into a pan of boiling 
water to cook 20 minutes. This prevents its burning, 
and is a cheap and easy substitute for a farina kettle. 
Salt well, and when the kernels have swelled and burst 
like popcorn it is done. Serve it plain to eat with 
meat and gravy like rice, or add i a teaspoonful of 
cinnamon, a pinch of ground cloves, a handful of 
raisins or currants, and a £ cup of sugar while boiling, 
and you have a savory breakfast dish. Sometimes we 
serve it plain in saucers, with a dust of cinnamon on 
the top, and sugar and butter or cream, as German 
pancake is eaten.

EGGS. 

Boiling Eggs. 
Jennie Lee, Chicago. 

JJT the eggs in some vessel which can be closely 
covered, and when the tea-kettle boils pour in 
water enough to cover them, close the vessel 
and place it on the back part of the stove, and 
let it remain 10 minutes. If you wish to be very exact, 
use a thermometer and keep the water 10 minutes at 
exactly the heat which is indicated after the water is 
poured in. 

Bv the ordinary method of letting the eggs boil from 
2 to A minutes the white part is hardened and the yolk 
left uncooked, or if the yolk is cooked the white is too 
hard. By this method the heat penetrates so gradu- 
ally that the yolk is nicely cooked, while the white is 
soft and tender and only just done enough to be 
opaque. 

Poached Eggs. 
Mrs. W. S. D., Lowell. 
Place a frying-pan of salted boiling water on the 
fire filled with as many small muffin-rings as it will 
hold ; break the eggs singly in a cup and pour into the 
rings ; boil them 2i or 3 minutes ; remove the rings 
and take up the eggs singly in a strainer ; serve on £ 
slices of nicely browned and buttered toast; put a 
small piece of butter on each egg; pepper slightly, 
and garnish with sprigs of parseley. Serve hot. 

Omelet. 

Gypsy, Ionia, Mich. 
Take six eggs and beat separately ; allow one table- 
spoonful of milk to each egg ; stir in flour to make a 
batter ; take a cupful of milk, put on the stove, and 
stir in the batter until it is like starch ; add a piece of 
butter the size of a walnut and a pinch of salt ; take

this from the stove ; pour into the dish in which you 
would serve ; then stir in the yolks of the eggs, which 
have been beaten ; beat the whites until you can turn 
the platter bottom side up ; then add them, mixing 
thoroughly ; put in a quick oven and bake 10 minutes. 
Should be eaten immediately. 

Annie M. Hale, M. D., Chicago. 

Break 6 eggs into a bowl. Skim out the yolks into a 
large coffee-cup. Beat the whites to a stiff froth. 
Now beat the yolks enough to make them smooth, fill 
up the cup with milk and pour this into the bowl con- 
taining the whites of the eggs. Put in a little salt and 
stir enough to mix the whole — that is, as little as pos- 
sible. Have the spider warmed and a piece of but- 
ter as large as an egg already melted therein. Now 
pour in your eggs and milk, let it cook slowly ; be sure 
and not burn. If there is danger of this lift it up from 
the bottom with a knife. When the froth sets on the 
top it is done. Put a large plate over the spider and 
deftly turn the whole upside down. Lift off the 
spider and you will have an elegant and delicious 
omelet. 

JaneB., Waukegan. 

Take 1 egg for each person, beat 2 minutes, add 
salt the size of a pea and 1 tablespoonful of milk for 
each egg ; beat 1 minute and turn into a hot, well-but- 
tered frying-pan ; cover it and cook slowly till nearly 
as thick ; raise the edges and put under a little butter 
or lard to prevent sticking, and turn 1 half over on 
the other half, and serve immediately. 

French Eggs. 
Roxey, No. 2, Chicago. 
Boil hard, remove the shells, and roll in cracker 
crumbs ; fry in butter until brown. Make a gravy of 
butter, crumbs and cream, and pour over them. 

Pickled Eggs. 

Algebra, Cliicago. 
Select nine fresh ones, boil them hard, lift them di- 
rectly from the hot water into cold. When cool, re- 
move the shell, stick cloves into them, and drop in 
cold vinegar. 



COOKERY— EGGS. 49 

Agnes, Chicago. 
Put the eggs on the stove in cold water, let stand 
and boil for 1 hour— the heart is then mealy ; remove 
the shells, stick 4 or 5 cloves in each egg, pour hot 
vinegar over (add other spices if you like) ; let stand a 
few days ; they are very nice. 

To Keep Eggs. 

Mrs. C. O. S., Rock River Valley. 
Pour one gallon of boiling water on one quart of 
quicklime. When cold, add one ounce cream tartar. 
The eggs must be covered with the pickle. 

Fancier, Chicago. 
Take any tight package and place a layer of fine salt 
over the bottom; into this set the eggs, large end 
down, as closely as possible without touching each 
other ; fill with salt until the layer is covered, and then 
proceed as before. Care must be taken that the salt 
is dry, and that it be kept so, else it will cake and 
make it very troublesome to get the eggs out without 
breaking. 

French Toast. 

Belle, Chicago. 
For dessert : f of a pint of milk ; 1 egg, well beaten ; 
a little salt. Take 6 slices of bread ; dip into the cus- 
tard (uncooked) 1 by 1 ; then fry in a little butter till a 
delicate brown. For sauce, melted sugar with a little 
cinnamon added. This is very nice, and is a good way 
to use up stale bread. 

P. P. C, Chicago. 

Beat 3 or 4 eggs ; season with salt and pepper ; have 
ready some thin slices of bread; dip them into the 
eggs, and fry them in lard (or after frying ham) until 
of a light brown. 

Another method of cooking eggs and bread together 
is to crumb the bread some, as for dressing ; mix it 
with 3 or 4 beaten eggs; season, and fry until 
thoroughly done ; or mold with the hands into cakes, 
and fry until of a light brown. Either of the above 
dishes form a pleasant addition to the morning's re- 
past. 



50 COOKERY— COFFEE. 



COFFEE. 

A Woman, New Boston, III. 
[AKE the best green coffee, roast to a dark- 
brown, beat the white of 1 egg (so it won't hang 
together nrnch), stir it through the coffee while 
hot. When sufficiently browned, put away in a 
close can while hot. Grind when you want to make 
your coffee enough for a tablespoon heaping full to 
each person; add as many cups cold water as you 
think your family will drink ; put in a hot place ; let 
it just come to a boil ; put it back where it will keep 
hot till your meal is ready ; then put it off the stove 2 
or 3 minutes before pouring out. If not strong 
enough, put in more coffee next time. 

Mrs. F. C. E., Burlington, Iowa. 
A recipe for making coffee which has been used in 
my family for 75 years : Buy the green berry ; brown 
and grind it at home ; grind as fine as mill will grind 
it. Buy a French biggin — dimensions of top portion 
to make coffee for 1 person— If inches in diameter, 5 
inches high ; for 2 or 3 persons, 2i inches diameter, 4 
to 5 inches high. Quantity of unground coffee for 1 
person, contents of a tin cup If inches in diameter, 1£ 
inches deep ; for two persons, If inches in diameter, 2 
inches deep. Put the coffee into the top of the pot, 
with nothing between it and the perforated bottom ; 
press it tight ; put in the strainer. (This is to prevent 
the water from striking the coffee in a body, thus 
boring a hole in it, and running through without 
extracting its strength). Pour in boiling water I of 
a pint at a time, allowing I of a pint for each person, 
and I of a pint for absorption. (Where there are 
more than 3 persons, allow more for absorption; 
where fewer, less). While water is running through, 
the bottom pot or receiver should stand in hot water. 
(This prevents boiling or getting cold). This coffee 



COOKERY— COFFEE. 51 

should always be used with hot milk— proportion, 1 
part coffee, 3 parts milk. 

Lillie W., Englewood, Ills. 
Take 2 or more egg-shells, crush them with the requi- 
site amount of ground Java, add 1 a cup of cold water, 
beat it well together, pour on boiling water, and allow 
it to boil up once. Always wash eggs before breaking 
them, and save the shells for coffee, which will be, 
when so treated, as clear as when the white of an egg 
is used. 

Aunt Sally, Springfield, O. 

Take a piece of Shaker flannel, and make a bag that 
will fit in your coffee-pot, only make it about an inch 
shorter. Hem in a piece of wire or hoop-skirt steel, 
just below the hem at the top (something to hold the 
bag up), and put a loop on. Hang this bag in the 
coffee-pot, and put the coffee in the bag, pour in the 
boiling water, a pint to a heaping tablespoonful of 
coffee, and boil. You will have nice clear coffee, with- 
out using eggs or anything else to clear it. 

Mrs. Lillian D. Bollam, Chicago. 
Boast to a brown color (don"t burn to a black) genuine 
Mocha or old Government Java; grind while yet 
warm; place the quantity required for breakfast, 
loose (not packed), in a thin muslin sack ; drop this 
sack to the bottom of the coffee-pot ; fill the pot with 
cold water; place it on the stove until it gradually 
reaches the boiling heat, but don't let it boil for an in- 
stant; keep the pot on the stove 10 minutes longer, and 
the strength will be drawn from the ground coffee. 
Pour the coffee into warm cups directly from the pot. 
Add warm cream or hot milk, and sugar, and you will 
have an exquisite draught, all things having been 
properly conducted, equal to the fabled nectar we read 
of in mythology. Eoast coffee every morning— use as 
soon as roasted. 

D. D. Chicago. 

One-half egg to 1 cup ground coffee; stir well in a bowl, 
so that every ground is covered; then place in the 
coffee-pot and pour on cold water— shaking constantly 
till the lump of egg and coffee settles to a smooth mass. 
Add your boiling water. 



52 COOKERY— COFFEE. 

Mrs. Evergreen City, Bloomington. 
For each person allow 1 tablespoonful of coffee; 
pour on boiling water sufficient for use ; boil from '6 to 
5 minutes, after which pour out \ a cupful and replace 
it in the pot, allowing it to stand about a minute— this 
settles the coffee nicely — when it is ready to serve. 

Buelah, Ottawa, 111. 
Boil a dessert-spoonful of ground coffee in a pint of 
milk for a i of an hour ; then clear it with white of egg 
or isinglass ; let it boil for a few minutes, and set it by 
the side of the fire to fine. Sweeten according to taste. 
This is a suitable breakfast for those of spare habit 
and disposed to affections of the lungs. 

Queechy, DesPlaines, Ills. 
You can make coffee perfectly clear by putting in a 
small piece of codfish-skin, about 5 minutes before it is 
taken from the stove. A piece an inch square will be 
sufficient for a good sized family. The outside should 
be scraped, then rinse it and drop it in. 

Mrs. Nellie Townsend, Chicago, 

In the first place get the green coffee, roast it, take 
the quantity required, put in coffee-pot, pour boiling 
water on it ; have a pot of boiling water, set in this the 
coffee-pot, with a small piece of wood for the coif ee-pot 
to rest on, so it will not touch the bottom of the pot ; 
let it boil a half-hour, or, for that matter, it might boil 
all day, and be all the better for it. Your coffee will 
be as clear as crystal. You will need no egg, and will 
also find you will not require as much coffee as boiling. 
This way does not boil but steeps it. Be careful to use 
boiling water for both. 

B. Frank, Peoria. 

Get the best of green coffee, and brown nicely, but 
be sure and not burn it ; and while it is cooling, take 
the whites of 3 eggs and beat them until they are 
slightly frothy, and while the coffee is warm pour them 
over and stir well together, and when well mixed, if it 
should not be dry, set the pan under the stove to dry. 
Grind a cupful of the coffee, and to every person put a 
heaping tablespoonful of the coffee in a coffee-pot. 
Then pour a cup of cold water over it and shake well; 



COOKERY— BREAD. 53 

set it on the stove ; let it come to a boil, and put in as 
many cups of boiling water as you have spoonfuls 
of coffee ; stir down the grounds from the sides of 
the coffee-pot ; pour in a little cold water ; let it stand 
a little while and it is ready to serve. 



BREAD. 



Puffett. 

R., Dubuque, Iowa. 
1 quart sifted flour, in which rub 2 teaspoons cream 
tartar ; butter, size of an egg ; 2 teaspoons powdered 
sugar, 2 eggs beaten ; mix very smooth and add 1 pint 
milk and 1 teaspoon soda dissolved in a little boiling 
water. Bake immediately. 

muffins. 

Critic, Chicago. 
1 quart flour ; three teaspoonfuls baking-powder, or 
2 heaping teaspoonfuls of cream tartar (which I prefer), 
and one rounding full of soda, both stirred in the flour ; 
f of a cup of butter, or lard, or half and half ; put on 
the stove to melt without getting hot ; beat 2 eggs in a 
bowl ; add a little less than a pint of milk ; stir into the 
flour a little salt ; add the butter last ; have irons quite 
hot and rill even full ; then bake. 

Mrs. E. D. T. H„ Grand Rapid*, Mich. 
1 quart of rich milk, or, 1 cream and i milk ; 1 quart 
of flour— heaping ; (5 eggs; 1 tablespoonful of butter, 
and 1 of lard, softened together. Beat whites and 
yolks separately, very light. Then add flour and 
shortening, and a scant teaspoonful of salt, and stir in 
the flour the last thing, lightly as possible, and have 
the butter free from lumps. Heat your muffin rings, 
butter well, and half fill them, and bake immediately in 
hot oven . Send them to the table the moment they are 
done.

Cousin Nell, Chicago. 
li cups of corn-meal ; the same of flour ; 2 teaspoons 
of baking-powder ; i cup of sugar ; I teaspoon of salt ; 
small tablespoon of melted butter ; 2 eggs ; milk 
enough to make a stiff batter. 

Drop Biscuits. 

Aunt Sally, Springfield, O. 

1 quart of flour ; 3 teaspoonsf ul of baking powder ; 1 
small teaspoonful of salt ; piece of butter the size of an 
egg, rubbed thoroughly in the flour ; 1 pint of milk ; 
dropped from a spoon in buttered pans ; bake in a quick 
oven. 

Soda Biscuits. 

Mrs. Beal, Dixon. 

3 pints of flour, a tablespoon of butter and do. lard, 
a teaspoon of salt, do. even full cream of tartar, 1 of 
soda ; sift the cream tartar with the flour dry, rub the 
butter and lard very thoroughly through it ; dissolve 
the soda in a pint of milk, and mix all together. Eoll 
out, adding as little flour as possible ; cut with a bis- 
cuit-cutter, and bake 20 minutes in a quick oven. 

Yeast Biscuit. 

Gwendolen, Monzomania, Wis. 

2 quarts of flour, 1 tablespoonful of butter ; 3 table- 



COOKERY— BREAD. 55 

spoonsful of sugar; i cup yeast; a little salt. Mix 
thoroughly with 1 pint of scalded milk when it is 
almost cold. This will seem hard, but when raised 
will mold easily. Mix at night and mold in the morn- 
ing. Cut out and let them stand until raised again ; 
then bake. 

Baking- Powder Biscuit. 
Mrs. O. H. H., Chicago. 
One important point is in having a hot oven ; another 
is, have flour sifted, and roll dough as soft as you can 
handle ; then more baking-powder is needed. For 
each teacup of flour take a teaspoon of powder ; butter, 
the size of a small hen's egg, is sufficient for a quart of 
flour. After rubbing butter and powder into the 
amount of flour needed, I turn in cold water (milk will 
do), stirring all of the time, till the right consistency is 
reached ; salt ; then roll lightly, and bake at once. I 
warrant these will prove flakey, feathery, delicious, and 
more nutritious than biscuit raised with yeast. 

Mrs. G. Clinton Smith, Springfield, Ills. 

Use 3 heaping teaspoons baking powder. Rub this 
with your hands — not a spoon — into a quart of flour 
thoroughly. Then rub in a heaping tablespoonful of 
butter or lard in the same manner you did the baking- 
powder until well mixed. After adding a teaspoon of 
salt, if lard is used, add milk or water sufficient to 
make a soft dough. Roll and cut out quickly, placing 
them at once in a very hot oven. This latter is import- 
ant. Unless the oven is very hot they will not be a 
success. 

Quick Biscuits. 
Mrs. Emily, Eau Claire, Wis. 

Mix a quart of sweet milk with i a cup melted but- 
ter; stir in a pinch of salt, 2 teaspoonfuls baking- 
powder, and flour enough for a stiff batter. Have the 
oven at a brisk heat. Drop the batter, a spoonful in a 
place, on buttered pans. They will bake in 15 minutes. 

Graham Biscuits. 
Mrs. J. H. H„ Moline. 
Take 1 quart water or milk, butter the size of 1 egg, 
3 tablespoonfuls sugar, 2 of baker's yeast, and a pinch 



So COOKERY— BREAD. 

of salt. Take enough white flour to use up the water, 
making it the consistency of batter cakes. Add the 
rest of the ingredients, and as much Graham flour as 
can be stirred in with a spoon. Set it away till morn- 
ing. In the morning grease pan, flour hands. Take a 
lump dough the size ot a large egg ; roll lightly between 
the palms. Let them rise 20 minutes, and bake in a 
tolerably hot oven. 

Rusks. 

Mrs. W. F., Tuscola, Ills. 
Take enough of light dough and work in a teacup of 
sugar and nearly as much shortening, mould out same 
as for light biscuit. Or, take a teacupful of yeast, i a 
cup of lard or butter, a little soda ; knead together, and 
when it rises mold out, and raise again before baking. 

May Ely, Rochester. 
Rusks require a longer time for rising than ordinary 
rolls or biscuits. If wished for tea one evening, begin 
them the day before. In cold weather, to make up 2£ 
quarts of flour, mix into a paste with one pint of boil- 
ing water, 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar, 3 of flour, and 2 
large Irish potatoes, boiled and mashed smooth. In the 
evening make up dough with this sponge, adding 3 well 
beaten eggs, £ of a pound sugar, and i a pint fresh 
milk. Set it away in a covered vessel, leaving plenty 
of room for it to swell. Next morning work into the 
risen dough, which should not be stiff, a i pound of 
butter and lard mixed. Make into rolls or biscuits, 
and let the dough rise for the second time. Flavor with 
2 grated nutmegs or i an ounce of pounded stick cin- 
namon. When very light, bake in a quick, steady oven 
till of a pretty brown color ; glaze with the yolk of an 
egg, and sprinkle lightly with powdered white sugar. 

Spanish Buns. 

H. A. H., Oslikosh, Wis. 
One pint of flour ; 1 pint sugar ; 1 cup sweet milk ; 
1 cup of butter ; 4 eggs, beat separate ; 1 tablespoon of 
cinnamon; 1 teaspoon cloves; 1 teaspoon of soda; 2 
teaspoons cream tartar, or 3 spoons of baking powder. 
Bake on tins, an inch thick, and when taken from the 
oven, sprinkle with white sugar while hot.

Parker House Rolls. 

Mrs. J. C. H., Chicago. 

One pint scalded milk. Let it cool and add 2 table- 
spoons sugar, 2 of lard, 2 of yeast, a little salt. In win- 
ter mix in batter overnight ; in morning knead ; set to 
rise again, and at noon roll out very thin ; cut in large 
rounds ; put on a piece of butter, and lay the dough 
over. Let it rise again, and bake for tea. In summer 
mix early in the morning, instead of at night. 

Rolls. 

Aunt Lucy, Chicago. 
Two quarts sifted flour ; a little more than a pint 
milk ; 1 tablespoon of lard ; a little salt ; a tablespoon- 
ful of white sugar, and £ cup of yeast. Scald the milk ; 
let stand to cool ; put the sugar into the milk ; rub the 
lard into the flour ; make a hole in the center of the 
flour; pour in the milk and yeast; add the salt; 
sprinkle a little flour over the hole ; set to rise ; when 
very light mix in the rest of the flour ; let rise again ; 
about an hour before tea roll out very lightly; 
cut with the cover of a large baking-powder box ; fold 
even (like a turn-over) ; let rise till very light, and bake 
in a quick oven 20 minutes. 

French Rolls. 

May Barnes, Cedar Rapids. 
Into 1 pound of flour rub 2 ounces of butter and the 
whites of 3 eggs, well beaten ; add a tablespoonful of 
good yeast, a little salt, and milk enough to make a stiff 
dough; cover and set it in a warm place till light, 
which will be an hour or more, according to the 
strength of the yeast. Cut into rolls, dip the eclges into 
melted butter to keep them from sticking together, and 
bake in a quick oven.

provement. Sweet apples, chopped line, are also ex- 
cellent. 

Rye Tea Cakes.

One pint sweet milk, 2 eggs well beaten, 1 table- 
spoonful of brown sugar, I a teaspoonful of salt ; stk 
into this sufficient rye flour to make it as stiff as com- 
mon griddle-cake batter. Bake in gem pans I an hour.

spoonful baking powder; stir in sifted Graham flour 
until quite thick ; bake in muffin-rings or gem-tins un- 
til well browned on top. 

Oat Meal Gems. 

Souella M., Eagle, Wis. 
Take 1 cup of oat-meal and soak it over night in 1 
cup of water ; in the morning add 1 cup of sour milk, 
1 teaspoon of saleratus, 1 cup of flour, a little salt. 
They are baked in irons as other gems and muffins. If 
on hrst trial you find them moist and sticky, add a 
little more flour, as some flour thickens more than 
others. 

Graham Gems. 
Mrs. M., Coldwater, Mich. 

Take 3 teacups of soft water or boiled well water, 
and 4i teacups best Graham flour ; beat together about 
10 minutes. Have cast-iron gem pans on the stove 
sissing hot ; put in each pan a tiny piece of butter, and 
fill even full with the batter ; have the oven very hot 
when you put them in, and then gradually allow the 
heat to decrease. This makes the pans twice full ; bake 
20 minutes. We have to vary the flour a little at every 
fresh bagful, or it does not swell alike. 

Aunt Emma, Chicago. 
To 1 quart of Graham flour add 1 pint fine white 
flour, and enough milk or water, a little warm, to make 
a thick batter ; no salt or baking powder. Have your 
oven hotter than for biscuit, and your gem-pans stand- 
ing in the oven till you get ready. Beat batter thor- 
oughly, grease your pans, and drop in while the irons 
are smoking hot. Bake quickly a nice brown.

der. Rub the baking powder into the flour. Add the 
cream with a little salt, then the milk ; mix well, and 
roll as thin as soda-crackers ; cut in any shape ; bake 
quickly ; then leave about the stove for a few hours to 
dry thoroughly. 

Rich Waffles. 
Mary, Lee Center, 111. 

Make a thin paste with 8 ounces of flour, 6 ounces of 
pulverized sugar, 2 eggs, a few drops of essence to 
flavor, i a liquor-glass of brandy or rum, and milk. 
Warm and butter both sides of the mold, put some of 
the paste into it ; close it gently, set it on the fire, turn 
it over to heat both sides equally, dust them with 
sugar when done, and serve either warm or cold. It 
takes hardly a minute for each with a good fire. 

Rye Drops Fried. 

Julia Rive, Tolono. 
One cup sour milk or buttermilk, 3 tablespoonfuls 
sugar, 1 of butter if buttermilk is not used, 1 egg, scant 
teaspoonf ul soda, and one of cinnamon ; add rye flour 
sufficient to make a stiff batter. Take it up by the 
tablespoonful and drop into boiling hot lard, first dip- 
ping the spoon into the hot lard to prevent the dough 
sticking to the spoon. 

Graham or Rye Mush. 

Mrs. R. J. G., Onslow, Iowa. 
Stir. Graham or rye meal into boiling water, with a 
little salt, till quite thick ; cook a few minutes. This is 
very nice either with poached eggs or butter and sugar.

Soak the oatmeal over night in enough water to wet 
it, in the morning stir into boiling water. Cook a few 
minutes. 



62 COOKERY— BREAD. 

Mrs. S. M. B., Chicago. 

Three cups of meal will make a generous dish for a 
party of 4 or 5 persons. When it has cooked about 2 
hours in a double boiler, salt it thoroughly, and at the 
end of three hours it should be found very stiff and dry 
as possible, turned out to cool and mold ; cut in slices 
thin as can be handled without breaking, fry in butter 
and lard, equal parts, or I butter. The rich brown of 
these crisp bits will prove tempting to the veriest 
epicure. 

Whole Wheat. 
Mrs. Louise, Chicago. 

Either boil it slowly until quite soft, or bake 6 or 8 
hours, the same as beans, omitting the pork ; or as a 
pudding, with milk sufficient to allow it to swell, or 
about 2 quarts of milk to a pint of wheat. Sweeten to 
taste, and add a few drops of vanilla or lemon fla- 
voring, if desired. 

Corn Bread. 

Mima C. Morer, Cleveland. 
Two cups sour milk ; £ of a cup molasses ; 2 cups 
of corn meal ; H cups of white flour ; small tablespoon

To be eaten hot. Slice and steam when you wish to 
warm it up. 

Mrs. A. P. F., Highland Park, Ills. 
Two cups meal, 1 cup flour, i cup sugar, 3 teaspoons 
baking-powder, a little salt, moisten with sweet milk 
until like cup-cake. Bake in a quick oven, or it will 
not be nice. 

Rye Bread. 

Mrs. C. G. S., BocTi River Falls, IUs. 
First scald 2 coffee-cups of corn meal with boiling 
water to a thick batter. When this is cool, add i of a 
bowl of light sponge— taken from bread-sponge pre- 
pared with potatoes that has raised over night — £ tea- 
cup of sugar, 3 teaspoons of soda and salt. This stir as 
stiff with rye flour as can be stirred with a spoon. Let 
this raise very light, and then add as much rye again as 
can be worked in with the hands without kneading. 
Drop in a buttered pan, and bake slowly for H hours. 



COOKERY— BREAD. 63 

Graham Bread. 

Blanche, Chicago. 
One pint yeast, same as used for white bread ; stir in 
a pint of warm water and a little salt, then add Graham 
flour until you have a thick batter. Bake 15 minutes 
longer than" the same size loaf of white bread. It will 
not rise as much as other bread. 

Mis B. J. G., Onslow, Iowa. 
Graham 3 quarts, 2 quarts warm water, i pint yeast, 
1 teaspoonful soda, i pint sugar. Mix with a spoon. 
Pour into deep tins, well greased, and set in a warm 
place till quite light. Bake with a steady, moderate 
heat two hours. This recipe makes 3 good loaves. 

Mrs. E. E., Wisconsin. 
Take the '' sponge' 1 of white bread when light, enough 
for 1 loaf or 2, as yon wish, and mix in enough Graham 
flour to make a moderately stiff loaf ; place in a pan, 
and, when light, bake. You can add a little sugar or 
molasses if you like. Can also make very nice rye 
bread in the same way. 

Bread for Dyspeptics. 

C. M. W., Hudson, Mich. 
For 1 loaf, 1 pint of attrition flour; 1 pint wheat 
flour ; prepare with Horsford's Bread Preparation ac- 
cording to directions which come with it, adding salt, 
mixing soft, with sweet milk, with the hands, and bake 
quickly. To be used when a day old. 

Oatmeal Gruel. 

Mrs. W. B. B., Kalamazoo, Mich. 
Take 2 ounces of oatmeal and H pints of water. Rub 
the meal in a basin with the back of a spoon, in a small 
quantity of water, pouring off the fluid after the 
coarser particles are settled, but while the milkiness 
continues, repeat the operation until the milkiness dis- 
appears. Xext put the washings into a pan, stir until 
they boil, and a soft, thick mucilage is formed. 
Sweeten to taste. 

Milk. Sponge Bread. 

Adelaide, Negaunee. 
Put a pint of boiling water in a pitcher, with a tea- 



64 COOKERY— BREAD. 

spoonful of sugar, I teaspoonful salt, and the same of 
soda ; let it stand till you can bear your linger in it ; 
then add flour to make a thick batter ; beat it hard f or 
2 minutes. Now place the pitcher in a kettle of hot 
water — not hot enough to scald the mixture ; keep the 
water at the same temperature till the emptyings are 
light. If set early in the morning they will be ready, if 
watched carefully, at 11 o'clock to make a sponge, the 
same as for other bread, with a quart of very warm 
milk. Let this sponge get very light ; then make into 
loaves and set to rise again, taking care they do not get 
too light this time before putting in the oven, or the 
bread will be dry and tasteless. 

Yeast Bread. 
R. C. F., Chicago. 

At about 4 o'clock in the afternoon take 3 quarts of 
good flour and H quarts lukewarm water — or milk will 
make whiter bread— and a little salt. Place a cake of 
strictly fresh yeast in a small dish of the water. Stir 
your flour and water into a thick batter, mixing in the 
yeast as soon as it is soft, leaving dry flour around the 
edge to keep it warm. Then cover and set away in a 
warm place in the summer, or by the stove in the win- 
ter, until it begins to rise nicely— say 9 or 10 o'clock in 
the evening. Then mix thick, and knead about half as 
much as to bake. Then cover and set away again until 
morning. By 6 o'clock you will find your dish more 
than full, unless it is large. Then knead well and put 
in 'baking-tins, and set by the stove to rise. When 
light enough put in the oven and keep it evenly heated 
until done. This will make 3 good loaves. 
Salt-Rising Bread. 
C. M. W., Hudson, Mich. 

Take newly-ground middlings, put 6 heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of it in a coffee-cup ; add 1 teaspoon of sugar ; 
1 saltspoon of salt; i saltspoon of soda , mix thoroughly; 
pour boiling water in the mixture, stirring it well to- 
gether until it will nearly fill the cup; remove the 
spoon; cover the cup of dough; set it where it will 
keep warm, not scald. Set it Friday morning, and it 
will be light for Saturday's baking. If in a hurry, set 
in a dish of warm water. Now put in bread-pan flour 



COOKERY — BREAD. 65 

enough for bread; acid salt; take 1 quart of boiling 
water for three loaves, and turn into the middle of 
your flour, stirring in slowly ; put enough cold water 
(or milk) to cool sufficiently to bear your finger in it ; 
then add middlings— stir in well ; cover with some of 
the flour, and set in a warm place. When light enough, 
mix soft into loaves; grease bread-pans; also top of 
the loaves, which makes a tender upper crust ; cut 
gashes quite deep across the loaves, and it will rise 
evenly ; set near the stove, and when light enough, 
bake I of an hour. 

B. C. F., Chicago. 
Take i teaspoonful salt, 1 tablespoon fill sugar, 1 
pint lukewarm water, and flour enough to make a good 
batter. Cover closely and set the receptacle in a jar of 
warm water and cover that also. Let i t remain until 
it rises, then use as any other rising. Flour mixed up 
with milk will make wl liter bread than when mixed 
with water. 

Housekeeper iO years, Virginia, 111*. 
In early morning take a teacupf ul of new milk ; pour 
boiling water in until it is blood warm ; put in a small 
quarter teaspoon of salt ; the same of sugar ; then stir 
in 1 large tablespoonful of Graham flour, or corn-meal, 
and 2 tablespoonfuls of line flour, or until it is as thick 
as pancake batter ; mix it all in a quart cup, and set it 
to rise. Keep it of an equal heat by setting the cup in 
warm water ; if water gathers on top dust a little flour 
and stir ; it will rise by noon. Mix as other bread ; 
mold and put in pans at once ; let stand until light, 
when it is ready for the oven. If you have no milk, 
water will do for the rising. 

Betsy, Inavale, Neb. 
The recipe : In the morning take a quart dish and 
scald it out ; then put in a pint of warm water ; put in 
a teaspoonful of salt ; stir flour enough in to make a 
thick batter ; set the dish in a kettle of warm water, 
and where it will keep of the same temperature — just 
warm enough to bear your hand in. If the flour is 
good it will be at the top of the dish in 2 hours ; then 
take flour enough in a pan to make 8 loaves of bread ; 



66 COOKERY— CAKES, COOKIES, ETC. 

make a hole in the middle ; put in the yeast, and the 
same dish full of warm water ; stir it up thick with a 
spoon, and cover it with some of the flour, and set it 
to rise. When light, mold it into loaves, and set in a 
warm place to rise again. When light enough, bake t 
of an hour. 



CAKES, COOKIES, ETC. 



Doughnuts. 

Cousin Nell, Chicago. 

a IX cups of flour ; H cups of sugar ; 3 teaspoons of 
baking powder ; 1 teaspoon of salt ; butter the 
size ot £ an egg ; mix thoroughly ; then add 4 
eggs well beaten, and moisten with sweet milk 
until a soft dough. Flavor with nutmeg or cinnamon. 

Aunt Nellie Ely, St. Joseph, Mich. 
Break 2 eggs in a bowl, with 1 large cup of sugar, 1 
cup sour milk, 1 teaspoon soda, spices to suit the taste. 
Mix very soft. That is the secret of good fried cakes. 
Have your fat hot ; drop in 5 or 6 ; they will almost 
turn over themselves they are so light; keep some 
going in and some coming out all the time ; the last 
ones cool the fat, so the first ones do not get so brown ; 
but cook through. 

Mrs. W., Green Bay. 
I set my sponge for them about 2 or 3 o'clock, so I 
can fry them the next forenoon. Make a sponge, using 
1 quart water and 1 cake yeast. Let it rise until very 
light (about 5 hours is usually sufficient). Then add 1 
coffee-cup full of lard, 2 of white sugar, 3 large mash- 
ed potatoes or 2 eggs (the potatoes are nicer), and a 
small nutmeg. Let rise again until very light. Roll 
and cut, or pull off bits of dough and shape as you like. 
Lay enough to fry at one time on a floured plate, and 
set im .the oven to warm. Drop in boiling lard,' and 
fry longer than cakes made with baking powder. If 
the dough is light enough, and you heat it before

delicious. 

Mrs. N. N., Chicago.

nutmeg, and flour enough to permit the spoon to stand 
upright in the mixture ; add 2 teaspoonfuls baking

Mrs. E.K., Blue Island. 

Three eggs ; 1 cup sugar ; 4 tablespoonf uls melted

any flavoring you wish, and flour to roll nicely. I beat 
the eggs and sugar together first ; then add the lard, 
beating well ; then the milk ; put my baking-powder in 
the flour, and sift it in, stirring it with a spoon as long 
as I can, as I dislike using my hands. 

Three fourths of a pound granulated sugar, i pound 
butter, 1 cupful milk, 5 eggs, pinch of salt, teaspoonful 
vanilla extract, nutmeg to taste, :; pounds sifted flour; 
mix butter, sugar, and part of the milk to a very creamy

till very stiff; then with the hands knead in nearly all the 
flour, reserving a little for flouring the pastry board ; 
cut off a lump, roll out j inch thick, and cut in pieces 
8 inches long and 2 wide, twist in fancy shapes, drop 
few at a time in boiling hot lard, sift powdered sugar 
over them, when cool slip on a large meat-dish, and 
carefully, as they are crisp and break easily. This 
quantity requires'nearly 4 pounds of lard to cook them; 
keep the fat boiling ; slices of peeled white potato drop- 
ped in the fat absorbs the sediment from the dough 
that darkens the fat ; take the potato out when black 
and put in another pie< e.

Strawberry Short Cake. 
Theo. C. C, Chicago. 

First prepare the berries by picking ; after they have 
been well washed— the best way to wash them is to 
hold the boxes under the faucet and let a gentle stream 
of water run over them into an earthen bowl — then 
drain, and pick them into an earthen bowl ; now take 
the potato-masher and bruise them and cover with a 
thick layer of white sugar ; now set them aside till the 
cake is made. Take a quart of sifted flour ; £ a cup of 
sweet butter ; 1 egg, well beaten ; 3 teaspoonfuls of 
baking-powder, and milk enough to make a rather stiff 
dough ; knead well, and roll with the rolling-pin till 
about 1 inch thick ; bake till a nice brown, and when 
done, remove it to the table ; turn it out of the pan; 
with a light, sharp knife, cut it down lengthwise and 
crossways ; now run the knife through it, and lay it 
open for a few moments, just to let the steam escape 
(the steam ruins the color of the berries) ; then set the 
bottom crust on the platter ; cover thickly with the 
berries, an inch and a half deep ; lay the top crust on 
the fruit ; dust thickly with powdered sugar, and if 
any berry juice is left in the bowl, pour it round the 
cake, not over it, and you will have a delicious short 
cake.

each layer and sprinkle over the cocoanut. On the 
top layer of frosting sprinkle the cocoanut thick. 
. If you desire chocolate cake grate a 1 teactipful and 
stir in with the frosting; then spread between the 
layers of cake and on top. Be careful not to get too 
much water, and to bake in a quick oven.

Corn Starch Cake. 

Daily Reader, Hillsdale, Mich. 

Four eggs — whites only ; 1 cup of powdered sugar ; 
I cup of butter ; f- cup corn-starch ; I cup sweet milk ; 
1 cup flour ; 2 teaspoonfuls baking powder, lemon or 
rosewater flavoring. Cream the butter and sugar 
thoroughly either with the hand or a silver spoon ; mix 
the corn-starch with the milk, and add. Then add the 
eggs, beaten stiff; next the sifted flour, into which 
the baking-powder has been stirred. Mix all well; 
bake nicely, and call in your friends to help eat it, as 
this, like all corn-starch cake, is not fit to eat after the 
second day, and is much the best the same day it is 
baked. 

Cream Puffs. 
Mrs. Eve, Kalamazoo, Mich. 

Onerhalf pint cold water, in which rub smooth 6 
ounces of flour ; put it into a spider with 4 ounces of 
butter, and stir it continually over a fire not too hot, 
till it is thoroughly cooked. It will resemble a lump 
of putty and cleave off the spider like a pancake. Cool 
this lump, and add 4 eggs. Beat well, and then drop 
on a buttered tin in neat, compact little " dabs," far 
enough apart not to touch when they rise. Have the 
oven about as hot as for cookies, and in turning them 
lift up the tin. If you shove them before they are set 
you will have pancakes. They should be hollow balls. 
Bake them long enough so they will not fall when re- 
moved, and cool them on brown paper as quickly as 
possible, so they won't sweat. To fill them take {- pint 
milk ; 2 beaten eggs ; i cup of flour or corn-starch wet 
smoothly ; 1 cup sugar ; lemon or vanilla flavor ; cook 
it in a tin pail in a kettle of hot water, and stir it so it 
will be smooth. When both are cold, open the puff 
with a sharp knife ; just a little slit on the side, and 
fill in one tablespoonful of custard.

FROSTING, ICING, ETC. 



Frosting. 

German American. Chicago . 

EAT \ pound pulverized sugar with the juice of 
1 large lemon ; add the white of 1 egg beaten 
to a stiff froth ; and 1 tablespoon of rum or 
arrak. Beat till a snowy white, put over your 
cake and dry in a warm oven. 

C'hocolate Frosting. 

Sarah E., Chicayo. 

One cake (or i pound) JMaillard's French vanilla 
sweet chocolate, grated; i cup granulated sugar; f cup 
sweet milk ; 1 tablespoon butter ; a little salt. Boil 20 
minutes, stirring constantly. Take from the fire and 
pour into a dish. When near cool, add 1 tablespoon of 
vanilla ; spread on the cake. If the mixture is thicker 
than jelly, thin it with milk. This quantity will ice 2 
cakes, 3 layers each. The best cake is gold cake baked 
in jelly-tins. This will prove a success if the experi- 
menter can catch that "twist of the wrist" that forms 
an essential but indefinable part of every woman's 
recipe. 

Aunt Polly, Chicago. 

Whites of 3 eggs, beaten very light ; 9 tablespoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar, and 6 tablespoons of grated 
chocolate. 

Mrs. Knowlton, Rockford. 

First make a cream or custard pie, reserving for 
frosting the whites of 8 eggs, using the yolks and 1 or 
2 whole eggs for the pie. While your pie is baking 
scrape very line 2 tablespoonfuls of Baker's chocolate, 
and place it on the back part of the stove to melt. 
Now beat the whites of your eggs well ; add 6 tea- 
spoonfuls of pulverized sugar. When the chocolate is 



COOKERY— FROSTING, ICING, ETC. 91 

melted, stir a little of the frosting into it, beating very 
hard; add a little more, until all is added. Do not 
make the mistake of stirring the chocolate into the 
egg, as it will remain clouded. When the pie is done, 
pour the frosting on top, and return to the oven for 5 
minutes. I find in using chocolate it is much better 
to warm it until it is soft enough to mix in frosting or 
Charlotte Russe, than to dissolve it with water. 

Icing. 

Yankee Hoosier, Lafayette, hid. 
Two and a half cups sugar, | cup water; boil to- 
gether until it candies ; then add the whites of 3 eggs, 
slightly beaten, stirring briskly for 15 minutes, or until 
it seems perfectly smooth and white; then add the 
juice of 1 lemon. This is sufficient for one large white 
mountain cake, of 8 or 9 layers, covering also top and 
sides. 

Mrs. Rose B„ Addison. 
Beat the whites of 4 eggs with 1 pound of powdered 
sugar sifted, with i a tablespoon starch, and i of an 
ounce of fine gum-arabic. Stir it well. 

Chocolate Icing. 

Evaline, Goodland, Ind. 
Take the whites of two eggs, 1£ cups powdered sugar 
and 6 large tablespoons of chocolate. 

Chocolate Filling. 

Heatherhell, Detroit. 
Whites of 3 eggs ; 1* teacups of sugar : 3 tablespoon- 
mis grated chocolate; 1 teaspoonful vanilla. Beat 
the whites of the eggs well, and then add the other 
ingredients ; then beat all together and spread between 
the layers and on top of cake.

English Mince Pie. 

Mrs. Louisa T., Chicago. 
Three and a half pound? each of beef and suet chop- 
ped fine; 3i pounds each >f raisins and currants; 7 
pounds of apples chopped ; 1 pound of candied citron ; 

2 pounds of sugar; 1 ounce of nutmeg; 4 quarts of 
good cider ; 1 pint of best vinegar ; salt ; and a pint of 
golden sirup. Half the raisins should be stoned and 
chopped, the other 1 left whole. 

Pic Crust. 

Aunt Lucy, Chicago. 
Take 3 cups of sifted Hour, 1 cup of lard, a little salt, 
and i a cup of cold water. Handle as little as possible. 
Never butter or grease your pie pans — it will make the 
under crust stick and the pie hard to slip out. 

Lemon Pie. 

Aunt Sally, Springfield, O. 

Yolks of 2 eggs \ 1 cup of sugar ; the juice and grated 



COOKERY— PIES. 93 

rind of 1 lemon; 1£ cups of cold water; two table- 
spoonfuls of flour, and 5 of water mixed for thickening. 
Bake until done, but not watery. Beat the whites of 
the eggs to a stiff froth and stir in I cup of sugar. 
Spread over the top and brown in the oven. 

Pansy, St. Joseph, Mich. 
Two lemons ; grate off the outer peel ; chop the rest 
very fine ; put 2 tablespoons of corn-starch in 1 teacup 
of hot water, and boil; when cool add 2 teacups of 
white sugar ; the beaten yolks of 4 eggs ; then add the 
chopped peel and the juice ; stir well together ; bake 
till the crust is done — only 1 crust ; beat the whites of 
the 4 eggs to a stiff froth ; add 5 spoons (table) of sugar, 
stirring m well ; pour over the pie while hot ; set in the 
oven to brown. 

Jennie Dean, St. Paid. 
Two large fresh lemons ; grate off the rind ; if not 
bitter, reserve it for the filling of the pie; pare off 
every bit of the white skin of the lemon (as it toughens 
while cooking) ; then cut the lemon into very thin 
slices with sharp knife, and take out the seeds ; 2 cup- 
f uls of sugar, 3 tablespoonfuls of water, and 2 of sifted 
flour. Put into the pie a layer of lemon, then 1 of 
sugar, then 1 of the grated rind, and, lastly, of flour, 
and so on till the ingredients are used ; sprinkle the 
water over all, and cover with upper crust. Be sure to 
have the under crust lap over the upper, and pinch it 
well, as the sirup will cook all out if care is not taken 
when finishing the edge of crust. This quantity makes 
1 medium-sized pie. 

Orange Pie. 

Martha, Galva, 111. 
Take the juice and grated rind of 1 orange ; 1 small 
cup of sugar ; yolks of 3 eggs ; 1 tablespoon of corn- 
starch, made smooth with milk ; piece of butter as 
large as a chestnut, and 1 cup of milk. Beat the whites 
of the 3 eggs with sugar, and place on the top after the 
pie is baked — leaving in the oven until browned.

egg beaten light, 1 tablespoon of flour rubbed smooth 
in i cup of water. Stir in the orange, and bake with 2 
crusts. In this, as indeed in all cooking, judgment 
must be used, as oranges vary in size and sweetness ; 
but these are the usual proportions, and are sufficient 
for an ordinary-sized pie. 

Mrs. J. C. H., Chicago. 

Take 4 good-sized oranges, peel, seed, and cut in very 

small pieces. Add a cup of sugar, and let stand. Into 

a quart of nearly boiling milk stir 2 tablespoonfuls of 

corn-starch mixed with a little water, and the yolks of 

3 eggs. When this is done, let it cool, then mix with 
the oranges. Put it in simply a lower crust. Make a 
frosting of the whites of the eggs and i cup sugar. 
Spread it over top of pies, and place for a few seconds 
in the oven to brown. 

Mother's Lemon Pie. 

Lillic W., Englewood, 111. 
Juice and grated rind of 1 lemon ; 1 cup white sugar; 
1 tablespoonf ul of butter ; 2 tablespoonfuls sweet milk ; 

4 eggs. Mix it all as carefully and thoroughly as for a 
cake. If the mixture is not sufficient to All your pie- 
plate, add more milk. If you want it superexcellent, 
beat the whites of 2 eggs with 2 tablespoonfuls of pow- 
dered sugar for a miringue ; spread it on smoothly after 
the pie is baked, and set back into the oven to brown 
slightly. 

Two- Crust Lemon Pie. 

C. M. W., Hudson, Mich. 
Line your pie-dish with a good crust ; roll your lemons 
to soften them ; grate the rind of one large, or two 
small lemons ; cut the lemons in thin slices : pick out 
the seeds; spread evenly one layer over the crust; 
spread 1 cup of sugar over the lemon ; then add 1 cup 
of paste, made by taking 4 tablespoons of flour, wetting 
it with cold water the same as you would to make 
starch ; turn boiling water on it, stirring while cooking 
on the stove a few moments, adding a pinch of salt 
with the grated rind of the lemons. When thickened 
enough pour it over the sugar and lemon ; cover with 
a crust, cutting slits in to let out the air ; bake slowly.

Squash Pie. 

Germdnia, South Evanston. 
Obtain a good Hubbard squash, saw into quarters, and 
bake 2 of these until dry and thoroughly done. Scoop out 
the dry mealy part, and while warm add a tablespoon- 
ful of flour, and rub it well, wetting as you go with a 
little milk. This should be heated, and to this quan- 
tity of squash you will want 3 pints of milk. Now 
come the eggs ; 2 for a pie will do ; 3 won't hurt. Use 
a small teacup of sugar for each pie. To this add the 
yolks of the eggs, and beat a long time, adding for 
each pie one teaspoonful of ginger and one of cinna- 
mon. Line your tins with a nice paste, in which you 
have sifted a little baking-powder. Beat up your 
whites to a stiff froth ; stir the yolks in first, then the 
whites ; fill your shell and place in oven, which must 
not be too hot, as they will brown too fast and spoil the 
golden foam that comes to the top. 

EloUe Howe, Rockford, 111. 
Boil enough squash with a little salt in the water to 
make a quart of pulp ; 1 quart of milk ; 2 cups of sugar ; 
1 tablespoon ginger ; i a nutmeg the grated rind of a 
lemon ; four eggs, or 2 with corn-starch ; bake in deep 
pie-plates. 

R., Dubuque, Iowa. 

Steam a fine Hubbard squash ; when done beat per- 
fectly smooth ; add 2 eggs, i cup butter, 1 quart rich 
cream ; sugar to taste ; flavor with nutmeg or grated 
lemon. This makes three pies. 

Polly Snooks, Chicago. 
Steam the squash over a pot of corn-beef until it is 
well done ; then inash fine, adding 2 eggs well beaten 
to each pie. It requires a good deal of sugar to make 
them nice, some salt, very little pepper, and enough 
ginger to make it quite strong. Thin with milk and 
cream mixed together, or milk alone, will make good 
pies. Bake without top crust, quite brown. 

Squash Without Crust. 

Mary Moore, Chicago. 
Pare the stewed squash in the ordinary way. Then 
grease the plates (I use earthen ones) and sift corn-

It must not be too thick, and must have no breaks in 
it. Pour the prepared squash into the piates genHy, so 
;ir not to disturb the meal-, baive thoroughly, and cut 
when cold. Use pumpkin in the same way. It is 
quickly prepared, economical, healthy and palatable. 

Pumpkin Pie. 

Aunt Lucy, Chicago. 
Pare and cut in small bits, and boil the day before 
pies are made : when tender rub through the collander ; 
then add to about 3 pints of the strained pumpkin 5 
eggs, a little salt, a pint of sweet milk ; sweeten to 
taste ; a little ginger and lemon extract for flavoring ; 
bake in a quick oven. With this, use "Aunt Lucy's" 
crust, above given. 

Mrs. John T. J3., Quincy. 
Take equal parts stewed pumpkin and rich sweet 
milk. To a quart of the mixture add 3 well-beaten 
eggs, a teacup of sugar, and i a nutmeg grated. Line 
a deep pan with crust, set in the oven and fill full ; 
some like a pinch of salt added to each pie. 

Fruit Pie. 

Mrs. W. K. M„ Green Bay, Wis. 
Line a soup plate with a rich paste, and spread with 
a layer of strawberry or raspberry preserves; over 
which sprinkle 2 tablespoonfuls of finely chopped al- 
monds (blanched of course) and i ounce of candied 
lemon peel cut into shreds. Then mix the following 
ingredients : i pound white sugar ; i pound butter, 
melted ; 4 yolks and 2 whites of eggs, and a few drops 
of almond essence. Beat well together and pour the 
mixture into the soup plate over the preserves, etc. 
Bake in a moderately- warm oven. When cold sprinkle 
or sift a little powdered sugar over the top. A little 
cream eaten with ii is a great addition. 

Washing-ton Pie. 

Mrs. George M., Adrian, Mich.

sifted flour, 4 eggs, i teaspoonful cream tartar. For 
the filling : 1 tablespoonful corn-starch, boiled in i

coreing them ; stir together the butter and sugar, as 
for cake. Then add the other ingredients, and bake in 

rich under-paste only. 

Potato Pie. 

Cora Lee, Bloomington. 
Potato pie is made the same as pumpkin pie : Cook 
and mash the potatoes ; then put in an egg to a pie ; 
thin out with milk, sweeten and flavor to taste. 

Mrs. N. W. H., Chicago. 

Pare and grate 1 large white potato into a deep dish ; 
add the grated rind and juice of 1 lemon ; the white of 
1 egg well beaten ; 1 teacup of cold water ; 1 teacup of 
white sugar. Pour this into a plate lined with a nice 
crust and bake. When done have ready the whites of 
3 eggs, well beaten, with i cup of powdered sugar and 
a few drops of lemon extract. Pour this over the pie 
and return to the oven till of a rich brown color. 
When cool enough a small spoonful of jelly may be put 
over the pie. 

Sweet Potato Pie. 
Aunt Lucy, Chicago. 

Scrape clean 2 good-sized sweet potatoes ; boil ; when 
tender rub through the collander ; beat the yolks of 3 
eggs light ; stir with a pint of sweet milk into the po- 
tato; add a small teacup of sugar, a pinch of salt; 
flavor with a little fresh lemon, or extract will do;

Mince Pie. 

Lena Gray, Chicago. 
Seven pounds beef, after it is boiled and chopped ; 7 
pounds apples ; 6 pounds raisins ; 4 pounds currants ; 
61 pounds sugar; 1 pint molasses; 1 pound suet; a 
little salt ; four large oranges ; cinnamon, cloves, mace, 
allspice and nutmeg to your taste ; 2 pounds citron ; 3 
gallons cider. Boil the orange-peel in some of the 
cider to make it soft ; use the cider the peel was boiled 
in also. If I dared, I'd say put in a teacup of brandy 
when you are ready to bake. 

Mincemeat. 

Aunt Lucy, Chicago. 
Four pounds meat, 3 pounds suet, 3 pounds raisins, 3 
pounds currants, 1 pound citron, 3 pounds brown 
sugar, 1 pint sirup or molasses, grated rind and juice 
of 8 lemons, 2 ounces ground cinnamon, 1 ounce of 
cloves, 1 ounce of nutmeg. Boil meat very tender; 
pick out all bits of fat and gristle. Chop the suet fine, 
removing all strings and threads ; then mix thoroughly 
together; season with salt and black pepper ; wash 
m; my times the currants ; let them well dry, and then 
add to the mixture ; seed the raisins, and chop not fine ; 
add the sirup and spices ; slice the citron thin. To a 
quart of the above add a pint of chopped apples. It is 
best only to add the apples at each baking. Wet with 
sweet cider till the mixture is juicy. When ready to 
bake, take mincemeat, just enough for the number of 
pies wanted ; place it on the stove in a crock or jar and 
let it get heated through ; taste and add whatever you 
think it needs — it may be a little salt or spice, or per- 
haps it is not sweet enough. Make pastry rich ; place 
the mincemeat in the pie, not too full ; and some little 
bits of butter, a few whole raisins, and a few slices of 
citron. Keep mincemeat well covered and in a cool 
place.

all but the meat and spices ; boil until . the raisins are 
tender, and pour on to the meat and spices; add 
brandy after it is cold. If suet is used, scald it. This 
makes a large quantity, but it is very nice and keeps 
well.

A. B. C, Chicago. 
Take about I pint of flour, a pinch of salt, lard the

fine if you want it flaky ; use just enough cold water to 
stick together. Do not knead or work it much. Line 
a pie-tin with crust, and bake. If it rises up while 
baking, press it down with your hand before it gets 
hard. Heat 1 pint of milk boiling hot; then take i 
cup of flour i cup of sugar and the yolks of two eggs. 
Beat them together, and stir into the boiling milk, and 
cook about 5 minutes, (I cook in a 3-pint basin, set in 
another dish containing water, to prevent burning). 
After the crust is baked, put in the mixture ; then put 
upon the top a frosting made of the whites of the eggs, 
and 2 tablespoons of sugar, and brown in the oven.

flour enough to make it the consistency of apple sauce ; 
add sugar, cinnamon, a little nutmeg, allspice, which 
must predominate, and some well-washed currants; 
also a little butter melted and stirred in. If it is 
baker's bread, scald a little saleratus, and stir in thor- 
oughly, but, if it is house-made bread, add a teaspoon- 
ful of baking powder to your Horn, at the rate of 2 
teaspoonfuls to a quart of pudding. Bake in shallow 
pans ; cut in squares when serving ; turn over, and 
put on each a small piece of butter, and dust plenti- 
fully with powdered sugar. This requires a little care 
in making, but is universally liked and very whole- 
some and economical, as no eggs or cream are re- 
quired. 

Mrs. W. A. S., Arlington, Hh 

Of clean, broken pieces, a quart when crumbed — I 
put sweet milk to them right after breakfast, and set 
them on the open top of the boiling teakettle. They 
will swell and soften so as to nearly soak up the milk 
by the middle of the forenoon. Then beat up 3 eggs 
and add them, also 1 teacup of sugar, 1 teaspoonful of 
ground cinnamon, and a i teaspoonful of ground 
cloves, a little grated nutmeg, a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, and I of a pint of raisins, the latter picked over 
carefully and washed by pouring boiling water over 
them. The boiling water softens them and causes 
them to swell. Mix all ingredients together thorough- 
ly, and bake about an hour in a moderately-heated 
oven. It can be sliced and eaten cold with a relish, or 
eaten while warm with sweet sauce. 

Rena's Pudding. 

Agnes, Chicago. 
Take stale bread ; place in a pan ; cover with cold 
water ; set on back of stove — not too hot a place. If 
bread is sour, put a little soda in water ; let soak until 
soft. If you have more water on the bread than it 
takes up, pour it off until dry ; then beat line with a 
spoon; if it is very watery, press water out and throw 
away. To 1 quart of bread, after soaked, add 1 cup 
(large) of currants or raisins ; 1 large tablespoon of 
sugar. Bake in hot oven for 40 minutes, if not too

chopped raisins, a pinch of salt, a teaspoonful of cin- 
namon, 3 pints of flour, and 2 teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder. Put the flour in last, and stir all together 
thoroughly. Boil 2| hours in a bowl or tin pudding 
mold. This may be eaten with wine sauce, and is a 
good imitation of genuine plum pudding.

under the pudding dish to keep from burning in the 
bottom ; let it bake from f to a whole hour, according 
to the quality of the cooking apples.

rubbed with dripping ; press out the plaits so that the 
crust may be of an equal thickness all round ; peel and 
cut up 4 large apples, put i of them in, then add 1 
tablespoonful moist sugar and 1 of cloves ; put in the 
rest of the apples ; cover the top well over with paste ,

turn over the tapioca. Add, when it is blood warm,

Q. M., Tiffin, Ohio. 
Two pounds of stoned raisins ; 2 pounds well wash- 
ed Zante currants ; 1 pound sliced citron ; 2 pounds 
finely chopped beef suet ; 1 pound flour ; 1 pound bread 
crumbs ; 1 pound sugar ; 1 nutmeg ; 1 teaspoonf ul each

Mrs. C. C, Warren, III. 
Take 1 small square loaf of baked bread, peel off the 
crust, cut in pieces, and pour upon it 1 pint of boiling 
water, and add 1 teaspoonful of salt. Take 1 pint of 
flour ; add 1 heaping teaspoonful of baking powder ; 
2 coffee cups of raisins, seeded and chopped ; mix all 
well with the flour, first powders and next raisins ; 
then tidd soaked bread and 1 teaspoonful each of 
allspice, cinnamon, mace and cloves. Then add by 
degrees 1 coffee cup of sweet milk, and beat the mass 
well together. Scald pudding bag, and put in the pud- 
ding, which should be pretty stiff, and boil 3 hours. 
The whole secret lies in plunging puddings in boiling 
water, immediately after they are mixed, and never 
letting them cease boiling. Be sure and turn them 
over, and always leave room in the bag for swelling. 
I have a wire basket made for holding puddings while 
boiling, made with legs, to keep them from the bottom 
of the kettle, so as to prevent burning.

Plum Pudding. 

One quart of flour ; 1 coffee cup chopped raisins ; 1 
teacupf ul of currants ; 1 teacupful chopped suet ; i cup 
candied lemon finely shred ; 1 cup brown sugar ; 1 tea- 
spoonful of salt, and 2 of baking powder, and 2 cups of 
sweet milk. Sift the flour ; put in the baking powder 
and salt, mixing thoroughly. Next add the raisins, 
currants and candied lemon, and incorporate well with 
the flour, so they will not sink to the bottom, as they 
will always do unless mixed first with the flour. Then 
put in suet and sugar, and lastly the milk, and, after 
stirring well, put in a bag which has been dipped in 
boiling water, and boil 3 hours. Do not let the fire 
get low so the pudding will stop boiling, and replenish 
always from a boiling teakettle. When done, put on 
a large platter, remove the strings, and turn the bag 
wrong side out — that is, pull it gently back and it win 
come off smoothly, if the bag is well scalded. Omit 
the lemon if you do not care for it so rich. Sauce : One 
cup sugar, i cup butter, 1 tablespoonful of flour, and 1 
egg ; melt the butter in the sauce-pan and stir in the 
flour until the whole is smooth ; then stir in the egg, 
and pour upon this 1 pint of boiling water. By adding 
3 tablespoons of brandy, it becomes brandy sauce, or 
the juice and grated rind of a lemon, it is called lemon 
sauce.

One cup of tapioca ; 1 quart of milk ; soak 3 hours 
on the back side of the stove ; when soft, and if too 
thick, add more milk ; then i cup of white sugar ; the 
yolks of 2 eggs ; small spoonful of butter ; a little salt 
and nutmeg. Bake slowly for an hour. Beat the 
whites of the eggs as frosting, and serve with pudding 
when done ; or to be eaten as sauce, which I think is 
nicer than putting it on top of the pudding. 
Sago Pudding. 
J. A. S., Menasha, Wis. 

Soak 1 cup of sago in warm water until it is all 
swelled alike ; add water as it thickens, keeping it 
warm on the back side of the stove ; when all swelled, 
peel 6 sour apples, core them, put them in the sago ; 
sprinkle some sugar on top ; bake until the apples are 
soft— say £ an hour. To be eaten with cream and 
sugar. 

Poor Man's Pudding. 
Mrs. M. B. C, Manteno, III. 

One cup molasses, 1 of sour milk, i cup butter or 
beef drippings, 1 teaspoon soda, flour to make as stiff 
as can be easily stirred. Use raisins as taste or purse 
dictate. Put in a spouted cake-tin and steam 3 hours. 
Eat with sweetened cream, or any sauce preferred. 

Malagan Pudding. 

Mrs. J. M. T M Chicago. 
One-third cup of rice ; 1 cup sugar ; 2 eggs ; 1 pint 
of milk ; i a lemon and salt. Soak the rice over night. 
Beat the yolks of the eggs with one tablespoon of the 
sugar, and grate in the lemon rind ; add the rice and 
milk. Bake 1 hour. Take the whites of the eggs and 
beat to a stiff froth with the rest of the sugar, then add 
the lemon juice. Pour it over the pudding after it is 
baked, and brown it in the oven 2 or 3 minutes. To 
be eaten cold. 

Apple Pudding. 

Frank, Chicago. 
Make a plain crust with a little shortening in it, and 
cut in squares. Cut good sour apples in quarters, and 



COOKERY— SAUCES FOR PUDDINGS, ETC. 117 

put 3 of them in each square, after taking out the seeds. 
Then pinch the dough together, and put each one in a 
clean white muslin bag, and boil until they are done. 
Put on the table quite hot as a dessert. For sauce, 
boil good molasses with just enough butter. Pour 
into the gravy-boat and use. 

"Amber's " Apple Pudding. 

Amber, Highivood, 111. 
Take of apples that outblush the cheek of Hebe — 6. 
Slice them thin as the shimmer of ice that flashes upon 
the bosom of your water pail in chill November. 
Grate a quantity of bread crumbs, flue as the drift of 
Sahara sands. Spread unto yourself within an eart hen 
pudding dish alternate layers of apples and crumbs, 
sweetened with sugar and savory with nutmeg, yea, 
even moistened with water. And when the gentle 
heat of a moderate oven hath held your pudding one 
hour, or until the apple is soft as the cheek of happy 
infancy, eat ye of it, garnished with sweetened cream !

Lemon Sauce. 

Janet B., Racine, Wis. 

HE juice of a nice soft lemon, some water, sugar 
till sweet enough, and a little whole cinnamon. 
Let this come to a boil, and pour a little in a 
cup, the well-beaten yolks of 2 eggs, with the 
u eye" of the egg removed, and when you have the 
cup filled with the boiling sauce (be sure and stir with 
1 hand while pouring a little at a time in the cup till 
full), pour back in the pot, set on the stove, and let it 
come to a boil again, stirring all the while; then re- 
move immediately and put in your sauce-dish to get 
cold. Beat the whites of the eggs very stiff with pow- 
dered sugar and put right on top of the sauce. Do 
not pour the sauce over the pudding till just ready to 
eat it.

Orange Sauce. 

Mary B., Toledo, Iowa. 
Place on the fire in porcelain saucepan i of a pound 
of white sugar, i a pint of water, juice of 1 large 
orange, and the rind, cut off exceedingly thin ; boil 5 
ninutes, strain, and add 1 glass of white wine. 

Mrs. W. A. S., Arlington, 111. 

One coffeecup of sugar, i cup of butter, and 1 egg. 
Mix the 3 to a cream, and pour boiling water — H pints 
— over them, mixing well, after flavoring, with lemon 
or vanilla. 

Another : 1 cup of sugar, an even tablespoonful 
flour and the same of butter. Mix to a cream. Put 
boiling water to them, and mix thoroughly, and put on 
the stove to cook, letting it boil 15 minutes, stirring 
occasionally. Flavor with grated nutmeg after taking 
it off the stove, and put in a little molasses, if you like 
it a nice brown color. 

M. S. B., Kenosha, Wis. 

Two cups coffee-sugar ; H of water, put over to boil ; 
a heaping tablespoonful of flour, rubbed to a paste with 
butter as large as an egg ; thin with the sirup while it 
is boiling, till it pours easily ; then turn into sauce : let 
it boil a Tittle ; flavor with nutmeg, or brandy, if your 
conscience allows. 

A nice cold sauce : Squeeze the juice of two oranges ; 
add i a cup of sugar (more or less to taste) ; add a pint 
of cream or rich milk. This is nice, with cottage pud- 
ding, blanc mange, corn-starch, or any requiring cold 
sauce.

Oat-meal Cakes. 

Mrs. R. J. G.. Onslow, la. 
KE cup oat-meal, wet with 1 cup sweet milk ; 
soak over night; in the morning add a little 
salt, 1 teaspoonful baking powder, 1 egg, and 
enough sweet milk and a little cream to make 
as other gems ; bake in gem-pans in a quick oven. 

Buckwheat Cakes. 

C. M. W., Hudson, Mich. 
It will soon be time for buckwheat cakes. For the 
very best, make them i Graham ; set them with yeast 
over night, adding a little sugar and salt. Use milk 
or water. 

Breakfast Cakes. 
J. A. S., Menasha, Wis. 
One egg beaten very light ; 1 cup of Graham flour ; 
1 cup of wheat flour ; a little salt ; sweet milk enough 
to thin them like griddle cakes. To be baked in irons 
heated hot before putting them in. This will make 
just 12. Be particular and beat the eggs very light. 

Corn-meal Cakes. 

Belle M. D., Chicago. 
Take 2 cups of corn-meal, 1 cup of flour, a little salt. 
Mix well together. Two eggs well beaten ; 1 pint of 
thick sour milk, in a little of which stir 1 even tea- 
spoonful of soda. Mix well together in a batter, and 
fry on a well-greased griddle. The ladies need not be 
afraid to let their children eat them. 
Apple Fritters. 
Mrs. B. S. B., Areola. 
Pare, core and parboil some juicy tart apples in a 
very little water ; chop fine ; beat 7 eggs very light : 
add to them slowly f of a pound of sifted prepared 



120 COOKERY— PANCAKES, FRITTERS, ETC. 

flour ; beat very light ; put in apple enough to thicken 
the batter, and the grated yellow rind and juice of a 
lemon ; have the very best lard at a perfectly boiling 
point ; put in it a thick slice of raw apple ; put a large 
spoonful of the batter in at a time, and as many spoon- 
fuls as the pan will hold ; they take but a few mo- 
ments to do and need not be turned over ; must be 
made at the moment you wish to use them and sent to 
the table at once, each panful sent in as quickly as 
baked ; powdered sugar with cinnamon and nutmeg 
in it, is nice for them. 

Crushed Wheat Fritters* 

Pansy, St. Joseph, Mich. 
Take cold crushed wheat; 1 large tablespoon of 
flour; 1 tablespoon sugar. Mix all together with 1 
egg well beaten ; drop with n, large spoon into good 
hot lard, and fry a nice brown. The best way to cook 
crushed wheat is to put it in a double boiler with 
water, boiling hot, enough to cover it. When well 
soaked, which will be in about i an hour, mix up with 
milk and let it simmer f of an hour. 

Corn Fritters. 

Mrs. S. B. C, Elgin. 
Three ears of green corn ; 1 egg ; a little salt and 
pepper ; flour enough to keep from separating in the 
fat. Fry as you do the rice fritters. Shave the corn 
thin, and scrape out the pulp. I used to grate it, but 
this is not so tedious and does as well. 

Buckwheat Short-cake. 

Ruby, Washington Heights. 
. Three cups sour milk ; 1 teaspoon saleratus dissolv- 
ed in the milk, with a little salt ; mix up a dough with 
buckwheat flour thicker than you would for batter 
cakes (say, quite stiff). Put into a buttered tin, and 
bake in hot oven 30 minutes. 

Oat Meal Cakes. 

Young Grandma, Marshall Co., III. 
Oat-meal can be made into mush, porridge, or set 
with rising, like buckwheat cakes, and baked on the 
griddle, only they will require much longer time in

baking than buckwheat. It can also be used in mak- 
ing stir-cake, by using about £ wheat flour. 

S. 8. B., Chicago, 
Put 2 or 3 handfuls of meal into a bowl, and moisten 
it with water merely sufficient to form it into a cake ; 
knead it out round and round with the hands upon the 
board, strewing meal under and over it until it is as 
thin as desired, and put it on a hot griddle, bake it till 
it is slightly brown on the under side, then take it off 
and toast that side before the fire which was upper- 
most on the griddle. 

<■ rail am Griddle Cakes. 

Cousin Sarahs Canton, III. 
Use the white wheat Graham, if possible. Equal 

Earts of Graham flour and corn-meal stirred into sour 
uttermilk, or other sour milk, with a little butter 
added, soda and salt, and 1 or more spoons of sugar. 
Try them, and if sticky, the milk is too sour ; add 1 or 
2 eggs, or a little water. This is not a precise recipe, 
but I think no one will have trouble with it, especial- 
ly as it can be varied considerably and still be good. 
I sometimes use all Graham flour : try it both ways, 
and I think you'll like them.

Apple Meringue. 

E. L. M„ Chicago. 
,AKE, slice, stew and sweeten 6 tart juicy apples. 
Mash very smooth or rub through a sieve. Sea- 
son with nutmeg or lemon-peel. Line a gener- 
ous-sized plate with an under crust, and bake 
first. Whip the whites of 3 eggs— with 3 tablesnoon- 
fuls of pulverized sugar — till it stands alone. Fill the 
crust with apple, then spread the eggs smoothly over 
the top: Return to the oven and brown nicely. If 
you put your eggs in a dish of cold water a while be- 
fore breaking them, they will beat up nicer.

Italian Cream. 

Elma, Milwaukee. 
Put the juice of 1 lemon and the rind of 2 to 1 quart 
of thick cream. Sweeten with £ pound sugar, and let 
it stand for £ an hour. Add 1 ounce of isinglass dis- 
solved in i pint of water till perfectly smooth and free 
from lumps. Strain the whole mixture through a fine 
sieve and then beat together for several minutes. Put 
into a mold, and, when cold and perfectly set, turn 
upon a dessert dish. 

Chocolate Cream. 

Elma, Milwaukee. 
One small cup of grated chocolate, 1 pound of sugar, 

1 quart of milk, 1 box of Cox's gelatine soaked m i 
pint of water 1 hour. Boil all together 4 minutes ; then 
add 1 pint of rich cream and boil 1 minute. Flavor 
with vanilla and pour into molds. This makes nearly 

2 quarts of cream. 

Snow Cream. 
M., La Crosse, Wis. 
Sweeten a pint of cream very sweet; flavor with 
vanilla or lemon as you prefer ; let it stand where it 
will get very cold ; when nearly ready for dessert beat 
new-fallen snow into the cream till stiff enough to 
stand alone ; serve immediately. 

Apple Snow. 

Dorothea, Bloomington, 111. 
Prepare 8 medium-sized apples as for sauce ; after it 
is cold, break the white of 1 egg in a dish ; turn your 
apple-sauce over it, and whip with a fork 30 minutes. 
Care should be taken that each blemish be carefully 
cut away in preparing the apples, as the whiteness of 
the snow depends mainly on this. 

Apple Puffetts. 

Kenn Tucky, Macomb, 111. 
Two eggs ; 1 pint of milk ; sufficient flour to thicken, 
as waffle batter; H teaspoons of baking-powder; fill 
teacup alternately with a layer of batter and then of 
apples chopped fine, steam 1 hour; serve hot, with 
flavored cream and sugar. You can substitute any 
fresh fruit or jams you like.

Charlotte Russe. 

Dryad, Chicago. 
One pint of cream ; & of a box of gelatine ; 2 table- 
spoons of sugar. Flavor to taste. Tut the sugar in 
the cream before whipping it, then whip it until it is 
quite stiff and light. Pour cold water over the gela- 
tine, and let it stand until all is dissolved. Then add 
the cream, and pour into a mold lined with slices of 
sponge cake. Stand in a cool place for a few hours. 
This recipe I use to line my mold with : 4 eggs ; 2 cups 
of sugar; 3 cups of flour ; 3 teaspoons of baking-pow- 
der; 1 cup of sweet milk. Beat the sugar and eggs 
together for 15 minutes. Stir in the sifted flour with 
the baking-powder. Add the milk, and bake. 

Velvet Blanc Mange. 

Bella, Kankakee, III. 
Two cups sweet cream, i ounce Cooper's gelatine, 
soaked in a very little cold water 1 hour ; i a cup white 
powdered sugar. 1 teaspoonful extract of bitter al- 
monds, 1 glass of white wine. Heat the cream to boil- 
ing, stir in the gelatine and sugar, and as soon as they 
are dissolved take from the fire, beat 10 minutes until 
very light, flavor and add the wine by degrees, mixing 
it well. Put into molds wet with clear water. 

Irish moss. 

Mary, Peoria. 
Soak a scant handful of Irish moss in strong soda- 
water until it swells ; then squeeze the moss until it is 
free from water, and put it in a tin bucket which con- 
tains 6 pints of sweet milk. Set the bucket in a large 
iron pot which holds several pints of hot water ; stir 
seldom, and let it remain until it will jell slightly by 
dropping on a cold plate. Strain through a sieve, 
sweeten and flavor to taste. Kinse a mold or a crock 
with tepid water ; pour in the mixture, and set it away 
to cool. In a few hours it will be palatable. Eat with 
cream and sugar— some add jelly. 

Velvet Cream. 

Mrs. E. H.. Chicago. 
Take a package of gelatine and soak it in a cup of 
cold water till nearly dissolved; then place on the 



124 COOKERY— CUSTARD, BLANC MANGE, ETC. 

stove till heated through and thoroughly smooth (hav- 
ing added sufficient sugar to sweeten a quart of cream). 
Strain through a fine sieve, and add the cream when 
nearly cold, stirring until well mixed. Flavor of 
course— almond is very delicate— turn into a mold, and 
it will harden in a short time in cold weather. Some 
people use a cup of white wine instead of water, but it 
will be more apt to curdle. 

Floating Island. 

Lou, Tuscola, 1U, 
Beat the yolks of 3 eggs until very light ; sweeten and 
flavor to taste ; stir into a quart of boiling milk ; cook 
till it thickens ; when cool, pour into a low glass dish ; 
whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth ; sweeten, 
and pour over a dish of boiling water to cook. Take 
a tablespoon and drop the whites on top of the cream, 
far enough apart so that the "little white islands'' 
will not touch each other. By dropping little specks 
of bright jelly on each island will be produced a pleas- 
ing effect. Also by tilling wine glasses and arranging 
around the stand adds to the appearance of the table. 

Russia Cream. 

Mrs. H., Odell, 111. 
Four eggs ; 1 cup sugar ; 1 quart of milk ; i box of 
Cox's gelatine, dissolved in i pint of warm water. 
Beat the yolks of the eggs and sugar together, and 
cook with the milk (like custard). Take this off the 
stove; and add the (well beaten) whites of the eggs, 
stirring rapidly for a few moments. Now add the 
gelatine, and then a teaspoonful of lemon. Pour it 
into a pretty shaped dish to harden, and turn it out on 
a platter, and cut oft in blocks (as ice cream). Make 
this cream the day before you want to use it. 

Chocolate Blanc Mange. 

Mrs. H., Odell, III. 
One-half box gelatine, well soaked. Let 1 pint of

late (not the sweetened) ; 12 tablespoons sugar. Add 
the gelatine just before turning into the molds. To 
be eaten when cold, with sugar and cream.

Aunt Sally, Springfield, O. 

One pint sweet milk ; 1 pint of smooth apple sauce 
well sweetened ; 3 eggs ; flavor with lemon and bake 
without top crust. 

Apple Butter. 
Aunt Sally, Springfield, O. 

Take tart cooking apples, such as will make good 
sauce. To 3 pecks, after they are peeled and quarter- 
ed, allow 9 pounds of brown sugar and 2 gallons, or 
perhaps a little more, of water. Put the sugar and 
water in your kettle, and let it boil ; then add the ap- 
ples. After they begin to cook stir constantly till the 
butter ie done. Try it by putting a little in a saucer, 
and if no water appears around it the marmalade is 
ready for the cinnamon and nutmeg " to your taste." 

Preserved Apples. 

E. L. M., Chicago. 
Pare and core 12 large apples ; cut each into eights ; 
make a sirup of 1 pound of sugar and i a pint of water, 
and boil ; put in as much apple as can be cooked with- 
out breaking ; remove them carefully when tender ; 
after all are done, add to the liquid 1 cup of sugar and 
boil 10 minutes slowly ; flavor with lemon, and pour 
over the apples, or grate nutmeg on them instead. 

Orange Dessert. 

Algebra, Chicago. 
Pare 5 or 6 oranges ; cut into thin slices ; pour over 
them a coffee cup of sugar. Boil 1 pint of milk ; add 
while boiling the yolks of 3 eggs, i tablespoon of corn- 
starch (made smooth with a little cold milk) ; stir all 
the time ; as soon as thickened, pour over the fruit. 
Beat tne whites of the eggs to a froth ; acid 2 table- 
spoons of powdered sugar •, pour over the custard, and 
brown in the oven. Serve cold.

to the boiling point ; add the yolks and sugar,' stirring 
well. Now add the hot milk, a little at a time, beat- 
ing the whole time. Now set the dish inside another 
containing boiling water, and boil until thick as boil- 
ed custard, when pour into another dish to cool, after 
which beat in the cream, and flavor. It is now ready 
for freezing. Always use rock salt for freezing, as 
common will not do.

kettle ; add 3 even cups of sugar ; let it boil a 
few minutes, and then add the pulp and grated rind of 
the lemons, also the dissolved gelatine. Put into a

Two pounds white sugar * 1 pint sherry wine ; 1 pint 



COOKERY— FRUITS, JELLIES, ETC. 127 

cold water; 1 package of Cox's gelatine; juice of 2 
lemons and grated rind of 1 ; 1 quart of boiling water ; 
1 good pinch of cinnamon. Soak the gelatine in the 
cold water 1 hour ; add to this the sugar, lemons and 
cinnamon ; pour over all a quart of boiling water, and 
stir until the gelatine is thoroughly dissolved. Put in 
the wine ; strain through a double flannel bag without 
squeezing; wet your molds with cold water, and set 
the jelly away in them to cool. 

Cider jelly is made the same way by substituting a 
pint of pure sweet cider for the wine. If you wish 
them colored, use the colored sugar, or a very little 
prepared cochineal. 

Quince Jelly. 

Mrs. E. H., Chicago. 
Cover the fruit with water and boil until the good- 
ness is all out (it will require i or f of an hour). Then 
strain through llannel or crash, without much squeez- 
ing. Strain twice if not clear ; add equal quantities of 
juice and sugar and boil steadily about twenty min- 
utes. It is better to leave the glasses several days be- 
fore sealing, even if not quite hard, as yeur jelly will 
be much more delicate than if boiled too long. 

Hmsekeepzr, Chicago. 

Wash the fruit ; save all the nice parings and seeds ; 
cook for an hour or more in more water than will cover 
them ; then run them through the colander and let 
them sit until next day, or until the fruit substance 
has settled ; now throw off the clear juice through a 
thin muslin bag, and sit on the fire ; when boiling well 
add 1 pint of sugar to each pint of juice, and boil until 
it rolls oft the spoon ; fill the jelly-cups, and let them 
sit by the stove or any' warm place a couple of days 
without covers, so as to evaporate any water if the 
jelly is not stiff enough. 

Any jelly is better to be taken from the fire before 
quite done, as it will finish by sitting on the heater or 
near a warm stove, and if it boils 1 minute too long it 
will never be anything but a sticky, good-for-nothing 
kind of sirup. 

Apple or any fruit jelly can be made by boiling the 
fruit (not skins and seeds) and treated in the same way.

Cranberry Jelly. 

Amethyst, Chicago. 
Two ounces isinglass ; 1 pound double refined sugar ; 
3 pints well strained cranberry juice. Make a strong 
jelly of the isinglass ; then add the sugar and cranberry 
juice ; boil up ; strain it into shape. 

Crab Apple Jelly. 

Little Sally, Jefferson, Wis. 
Wash the apples, halve them, and cut out the blos- 
som. Then put them into a porcelain-lined kettle and 
turn boiling water on them, but not enough to cover 
them (as some say), and cook them until very soft, 
stirring them occasionally to prevent burning. (Here 
let me say, that you need not be at all careful for fear 
of mixing the pulp with the sirup, as it makes no dif- 
ference' whatever.) Next remove them from the fire 
and let them cool od some, and then put them into a 
bag made double from a piece of an old table cloth 
coarse and soft, and then put them into a large milk- 
pan and squeeze them. After squeezing out a little, 
empty them into the kettle, and so on doincr, uu.t they 
might not soak into the bag again. Now comes an 
important little item which I found out at the time, 
and did not know before. In consequence of having 
the bag double, I found that I could squeeze them very 
hard without any of the pulp getting throu^n. You 
can easily tell when this part of the work is lone. 
Then I put the juice into the kettle and boil i :, re- 
moving the scum as it rises, until perfectly clear, and 
continue to boil it a few minutes longer. I then 
measure it, and there is H quarts, and add just the 
same amount of sugar (granulated), and boil it a little 
over i an hour. You must " try " it before that time 
— put a little into a tin dish and set it into cold water. 
Make just a little allowance, for, after standing a day 
or two, it will be a little thicker than when you try it. 
If you find that your jelly is not thick enough the next 
day after it is made, you can turn it all back into the 
kettle and bo^l it over. Five minutes will make a great 
difference.

Wine Jelly. 

Mrs. E. H., Chicago. 

Wine jelly requires no eggs for clarifying if made 
from Cox's gelatine. Take 1 25-cent packet, juice of 3 
lemons, rind of 1, and 1 pint of cold water ; let stand 1 
hour ; then add 2 pints boiling water, H pounds white 
sugar, and a pint of sherry wine ; turn into molds to 
cool, after straining. If you like cinnamon flavor, add 
a few drops of that extract. If you wish to make any 
other kind of jelly, omit the sherry and add orange 
juice, or anything you like. An elegant-looking jelly 
for company can be made in two colors by dividing 
when all ready for molding and coloring \ with a few 
drops of cochineal (better procure it prepared at the 
druggist's). A third stripe can be made by dissolving 
a little gelatine in milk, but put no wine in, or it will 
curdle. 

Each color must harden before adding the next, or 

they will run. The result is delightful, but it is rather 

slow work. The top ornament of blanc mange is much 

handsomer if colored with cochineal. 

Stewed Cranberries. 

Mrs. W. S. G., Baraboo, Wis. 

One pound cranberries washed and picked over one 
by one, so as not to put in any soft or decayed ones ; 1 
pound granulated sugar; i pint water. Place the 
water and sugar on the range to boil, stirring con- 
stantly ; when boiling hot, throw in the berries— they 
will soon heat through and begin to burst ; stir contin- 
ually till well cooked ; it will take about 10 minutes 
after all begins to boil ; throw in a mold, previously 
dipped in cold water and not dried, and set till the fol- 
lowing day. The above recipe makes the cranberries 
neither too acid nor too sweet — will invariably turn 
out like jelly — but is far nicer to eat with turkey, game, 
or poultry, as you have the full berry. I often prepare 
10 pounds at a time, and it keeps perfectly, by pasting 
paper over the molds or bowls, 6 or 8 weeks. Always 
use porcelain kettles for cooking fruits in.

the sirup, allowing 1 pound of sugar to each pound of 
fruit. When it boils, put in the fruit, and boil slowly 
1 hour. When cold, add sliced lemon, allowing 1 
lemon for 2 pounds of citron. 1 large teacup of water 
is the general rule for one pound of fruit. 

Mrs. T. G. E., Chicago. 
Pare and cut citron into £ inch cubes, picking out all 
seeds. To 1 pound of citron 2 fresh lemons, and sugar 
equal to weight of lemons and melon. Boil the melon 
in clear water till very tender, skim out, and to same 
water add sugar ; then boil till thick sirup. Cut the 
lemons in halves and boil in a very little water 20 min- 
utes, then squeeze and strain the juice and water. Add 
the citron to the sirup and only let boil 15 minutes ; 
also add the lemon- water 10 minutes before taking off. 
The citron toughens if cooked longer

Mixed. 

X. T. Z., Hudson, Mich. 

STE colander of sliced green tomatoes, 1 quart 
sliced onions, 1 colander of cucumbers pared and 
sliced, 2 good handfuls of salt. Let all stand 
over night ; then drain through sieve, and scald 
$ cup celery seed, i ounce allspice, 1 teacup white mus- 
tard seed, 1 tablespoon black pepper, 1 pound brown 
sugar, 2 tablespoons mustard, 1 gallon vinegar, poured 
over hot. 

Grape. 
K., Galesburg, HI. 
Take ripe grapes ; remove all imperfect and broken 
ones : divide the large bunches, as they will pack more 
closely ; put in an earthen jar a layer of grapes and 
then one of grape leaves (the tannin in the leaves helps 
to preserve the firmness of the grapes). To 4 quarts of 
vinegar take 2 pints of white sugar, 1 oz. of cinnamon, 
i oz. each of cassia and cloves. Let the vinegar, sugar 
and spices all boil together a few minutes, and, when 
quite cold, pour over the grapes. By pouring the vine- 
gar over the grapes cold you avoid cracking the grapes, 
and they retain their natural form and color as long as 
they last. 

Cucumbers. 
C. M. W., Hudson, Mich. 

To 1 gallon of soft water add 1 teacup of rock salt ; 
heat it Doiling hot ; pour it over your cucumbers j let 
them remain in the brine 24 hours ; turn off the brme ; 
heat it again, and turn on the cucumbers the second 
time, and let them remain another 24 hours ; and again 
the third time, when they will be ready for the cider 
vinegar, which must be poured over them cold ; cover 
them with horse radish leaves to prevent mold rising 
on them ; press them under the vinegar with a heavy

plate, and in a few days they will be ready for use, and 
will keep green and bright all winter. 
Sweet Cucumber. 
C. M. W., Hudson. Mich. 
Take small crock of pickled cucumbers and make a 
good rich sirup of New Orleans molasses, and cider 
vinegar, and whole cloves ; heat together, and turn 
over them, and in 2 day you will have a most delicious, 
brittle, hard, sweet pickle. 

Ripe Cucumber. 
F. C, Chicago. 

Remove the seeds and rinds; slice them an inch 
thick soak them in cold vinegar over night ; drain off 
the vinegar and throw it away. Take 1 gallon of vine- 
gar, 4 pounds of sugar a few sticks of cinnamon bark, 
and in this mixture boil the pieces of cucumbers, re- 
moving each piece as it becomes clear, without being 
broken— some pieces will be done before others, and 
place them in a jar, when all are removed to the jar, 
pour the boiling vinegar over them, and keep them 
under the surface. 

Sweet tJrape. 
Mrs. J. P. H., Chicago. 

To 8 pounds fruit use 4 pounds sugar and 1 quart of 
vinegar. Place the fruit in jars. Boil and skim the 
sirup, and pour over the grapes boiling hot. Repeat 
this process 3 or 4 days. Then seal up and set in a 
cool, dry place. Boil any kind of spices in the sirup 
that suits the taste. 

Peaches. 
Mrs. Sarah L., Chicago. 

Take to 1 gallon of good cider vinegar 8 pounds of 
cut sugar. Let it dissolve in a large jar. Stick a clove 
into each peach. Put over the tire about a quart of 
the vinegar with the sugar dissolved, and drop in while 
cold 16 peaches, that will just fill a Mason's quart jar. 
Allow the peaches to boil slowly until a fork will stick 
easily through them. Oh, I forgot. You must put in 
a stick of cinnamon and a little allspice and cloves 
tied up in a rag. Not too much. It makes them black. 
Take out and carefully place in a jar, 1 by 1, fill with 
the liquid and screw on the top. 



COOKERY— PICKLES. 133 

Piealilli. 

Subscriber's Wife, Beloit. 

One peck of green tomatoes, seeded ; 2 large heads 
of cabbage ; 3 green peppers ; a small teacup of salt. 
Chop and mix well, and put in a colander to drain over 
night. In the morning cover it with good cider vine- 
gar, and let it boil until soft. Then drain off that 
vinegar and put in tablespoonful of mustard, 1 of all- 
spice, 1 of cloves ground, 2 pounds of sugar, and about 
i a teacup of horse radish, and 3 onions if you like. 
Cover nicely with cider vinegar, and let it boil a few 
minutes. Put into a stone jar and lay on the top a 
thin white cloth. Put an old plate on to keep it under 
the vinegar. 

Home-Made Vinegar. 
Mrs. Sarah _L„ Chicago. 

Take 6 gallons good cider; put this into a wine 
cask, and in the spring add 4 gallons of rain water, 1 
gallon of molasses, and 4 pounds of sugar. Tear in 
small pieces a i sheet of brown wrapping paper to 
make " mother " ; set the cask in the sun, and stick a 
glass bottle in the bung. In making currant jelly, I 
took the rinsings of the currants and poured that in, 
and a few peach-parings and stones, and cherries and 
blackberries, I poured in after soaking a day or so. 
This was the foundation of my vinegar, and that vine- 
gar barrel has been kept working night and day ever 
since by adding more cider, more water, molasses and 
sugar. 

Picltled Cabbage. 
Mrs. Mac, Kansas. 

Select a nice, firm head of cabbage ; take off all the 
outside leaves and shave it exceedingly fine (not chop 
it, remember) ; place it in the jar you intend to keep 
it in, sprinkle salt and pepper on it to your taste ; then 
cut. a couple of red peppers very fine ; add 2 table- 
spoons celery seed (or it is a great improvement, if 
you can get it, to chop up fine 2 heads of nice celery), 
2 tablespoons white mustard seed; pour over cold 
vinegar enough to cover. 

Chow Chow. 
Mrs. Sarah L., Chicago. 

Two auarts of small white onions ; 2 quarts of gher-

kins ; 2 quarts of string beans ; 2 small cauliflowers : 
£ a dozen ripe red peppers ; i pound mustard seed ; £ 
pound whole pepper ; 1 pound ground mustard, and, 
as there is nothing so adulterated as ground mustard, 
its better to get it at the druggist's ; 20 or 30 bay 
leaves, and 2 quarts of good .cider or wine vinegar. 
Peel the onions, halve the cucumbers, string the beans, 
and cut in pieces the cauliflower. Put all in a wooden 
tray, and sprinkle well with salt. In the morning wash 
and drain thoroughly, and put all into the cold vine- 
gar, except the red peppers. Let boil 20 minutes slow 
ly, frequently turning over. Have wax melted in a 
deepish dish, and, as you till and cork up, dip into the 
wax. The peppers you can put in to show to the best 
advantage. 

Chili Sauce. 

' Mrs. Louisa T., Chicago. 

Take 2 quarts of ripe tomatoes, 4 large onions, and 4 
red peppers. Chop them together ; then add 4 cups of 
vinegar, 3 tablespoons of brown sugar, 2 tablespoons 
of salt, 2 teaspoons each of cloves, ground cinnamon, 
ginger, allspice, and nutmeg. Boil all together for 1 
hour, and bottle for use after straining through a sieve 
or coarse netting. Is equal to famous Worcestershire. 
Tomato Catsup. 
Mrs. Sarah L., Chicago. 

Boil 1 bushel of tomatoes until soft enough to rub 
through a sieve. Then add to the liquid a i gallon of 
vinegar, H pints salt, 2 ounces of cloves, £ pound all- 
spice, 3 ounces good cayenne pepper, 5 heads of garlic, 
skinned and separated, 1 pound of sugar. Boil slowly 
until reduced $. It takes about 1 day. Set away for a 
week : boil over once, and, if too thick, thin with vine- 
gar ; bottle and seal. 

Green Tomato Catsup. 
Mrs. H. L. B., Chicago. 

One peck tomatoes, 6 pods red peppers, or 1 tea- 
spoonful pulverized, 4 tablespoonfuls salt, 4 tablespoon- 
fuls black pepper, 1 tablespoonful mustard, 1 table-

Vinegar Candy. 

Mrs. N. W. H., Chicaijo. 
HREE cups sugar ; 1 cup vinegar ; a piece of but- 
ter the size of an egg. Boil 20 minutes ; pour 
over plates to cool. Elavor, but do not stir. 

Sugar Drops. 

Helen Blazes, Chicago. 
One pound of flour ; f of a pound of sugar ; £ pound 
of butter ; 4 eggs ; a gill of rose water ; hake on but- 
tered paper in a quick oven. This makes 60 drops. 

Cocoanut Drops. 

Busy Bee, Ottumwa, Iowa. 
Peel a cocoanut ; cut in thin slices ; cut these again 
crossways into threads about \ an inch long : add H 
pounds moist brown sugar ;■ 1 teacup of cold water, 
and the sliced nut ; put into basin and boil £ an hour 
over slow hre, stirring frequently to keep from burn- 
ing ; drop a spoonful at a time onto a coarse wet linen 
towel to cool. 

Chocolate Drops. 

Kitten, Warsaw, 111. 
I take 2 cups of sugar (white) to 1 cup of water ; 
after it has boiled 5 minutes, remove from the fire and 
place in plate or dish and stir briskly till cool enough 
to shape into balls, after which place out to get cold 
and hard. In the meantime grate } a cake of Baker's 
chocolate, which you place in a plate and put over the 
teakettle to melt, after which process you roll the balls 
in the chocolate, and then place out to harden ; and 
for butter scotch, take 1 cup of molasses, 1 of sugar, 
and a £ cup of butter ; boil all together till to a candy. 



136 COOKERY— CONFECTIONERY. 

Candying Orange. 

Mrs. H., Ft. Wayne, lnd. 

Peel and quarter them. Make a sirup of 1 pound of 
sugar to a pint of water, and let it boil until it* comes 
to the candying point. Dip the oranges into this can- 
died sirup and place them on a sieve to drain. Put 
this sieve over a long, flat dish, which will catch the 
dripping sirup, and let the oranges remain so in a warm 
place until the candied sirup upon them is dry and 
crystalized. 

Molasses Candy. 
Agnes H., Aurora, 111. 

Boil some molasses in a spider until it hardens on 
snow or cold water. When done, stir in soda until 
there is about twice as much of the candy as there was 
of the molasses, and a little lemon extract for flavor- 
ing. Care must be taken that the candy does not burn, 
or it will have a bitter taste. The soda makes it light 
and gives it a grain. Pour on buttered plates to cool. 

[Note — The following recipe, if carefully followed, 
will prove perfectly satisfactory. It alone is worth $5 
to any lover of candy ] : 

Chocolate Caramels. 
Candy Maker, Chicago. 

Take 4 ounces confectioners' chocolate ; put it in a 
copper or iron kettle ; put in a i dipper of water and 
stir over a slow fire until it dissolves ; add more water 
if needed; then add 3 pounds of A sugar; £ pint 
cream and \ teaspoon of cream-tartar ; put them in 
with the chocolate and stir slow until it comes to a soft 
crack. To try it, dip a spoon in the kettle and then in 
the water. When done, pour in a small dripping pan ; 
grease the pan before putting in. When cool, cut in 
squares to suit yourself. 



COOKERY— YEAST, BAKING POWDEK, ETC. 137 



YEAST, BAKING POWDER, ETC. 



Baking Powder. 
Mrs. J. B. J"., Chicago, 

IX ounces of tartaric acid, 8 of the best baking 
soda, and 1 quart of flour ; sift 5 or 6 times 
through a fine sieve so as to thoroughly mix the 
ingredients; always procure the materials from 

a good druggist ; by so doing you have for 50 cents 

what would cost you $1 if you bought it from a grocer. 

Keep it well corked in a jar ; use the same quantity as 

you would of any other powder. 

Beer or Hop Yeast. 

K., Galesburg, HI. 
Put 1 large handful of hops into your yeast- jar, and 1 
large tablespoonful each of dark brown sugar, white 
flour and salt. Pour over these 1 quart of boiling 
water. Stir, and when luke-warm, put in £ teacup of 
yeast. One-half teacup of this yeast, strained, will 
make 4 ordinary loaves of bread. 

Hop Yeast. 

Mrs. W. S. G M Chicago. 
Grate 10 large potatoes raw ; have ready 6 quarts of 
strong hop tea boiling ; pour over the potatoes, stir- 
ring constantly, and let it boil a moment or two ; add 
1 coffee cup of salt and sugar each. When milk- warm 
rise with a pint of baker's or home-made yeast. Set in 
a warm place until done working. It will take a day 
or two to finish, but it stops after awhile. 

Potato Yeast. 

Take 12 common-sized potatoes, boil soft and mash 
hot ; pour over 1 pint boiling water ; add 1 pint cold 
water ; strain through a colender ; add 1 teacup su- 
gar, 1 tablespoon salt. When cool add 1 teacup bakers 



138 COOKERY— MISCELLANEOUS. 

yeast. Set in a warm place (not hot), allow it to rise 
light seveial times (say 4 or 5), and beat down. After 
which place in a glass jar, cover tightly, and set in a 
cool place. Half a teacupful of this is sufficient for 2 
ordinary-sized loaves of bread. This yeast will not 
sour. 

Potato Sponge. 
Mrs. M. E. M., Evanston, 1U 
Six potatoes boiled ; mash in a pint of flour ; then 
pour on the boiling potato water to scald it. Stir, and 
let it stand until cool. Then add more water and flour 
to make the quantity you wish ; add a cake of yeast 
soaked. Let it rise until bed-time. Give it a good 
stirring, and let it stand until morning, when it is very 
light and ready— 3. cups for coffee-cake, 1 cup and a 
little water for a rye and Indian loaf, the rest for white 
bread and a pan of delicious biscuit. All but the 
coffee-cake are baked before dinner, and only 1 cake of 
yeast used. I use cans which have had tomatoes in 
them to bake the brown bread in. The loaf does not 
have as much crust, and cuts in pretty slices for the 
table. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 

Imitation Wax Candles. 

Candle Maker, Chicago. 
!N"E pound of alum dissolved in warm water to 
each 5 pounds of tallow Melt tallow ; add the 
alum water; let water pass off in steam; run

and look like wax. 

To Sweeten Kancid Butter. 

Butter Maker, Elgin. 
Work the butter thoroughly, in sweet milk. If done 
as it should be, every particle of rancidity will be 
washed out. 

Lemon and Orange Extract. 

As the peel is removed from the fruit, cut it into 



COOKERY— MISCELLANEOUS. 139 

slices, put it into a large-necked bottle, and cover it 
with brandy or wine. As the liquor is used up fill the 
bottle, as the strength is diminished add more peel. 

To Prevent Jars Breaking. 

Mary Moore, Chicago. 
When putting in the fruit I set the cold jar on a 
folded cloth wet with cold water ; then fill with the 
boiling-hot fruit. I have never known a jar to break 
when thus treated. 

Canning Corn. 

Aunt Nancy, Joliet. 
Make a salt brine strong enough to bear up an egg ; 
put it in a i barrel or large crock ; then put in the 
whole ears of corn without cooking, just as you husk 
them. When the barrel is full, put a clean white cloth 
next to the corn, then a piece of board fitted to the 
barrel inside, with a stone on it for a weight, just as 
for pickles. When you wish to cook the corn you 
must freshen it some, as you do salted pickles. Then 
either shave it off or boil it in the cob, a la summer- 
time. 

Canned Berries. 

Heat slowly to boiling, in a large kettle, after adding 
1 tablespoon sugar to each quart of fruit, and a little 
water to prevent burning on. Let all come to a good 
boil and can quickly. This is a good rule for all kinds 
of fruit. 

Welsh Rarebit. 

Hen Huzzy, Elgin. 
We make a Welsh rarebit by melting good old cheese 
with a little vinegar, butter and milk, and pouring it 
over bread, toasted or untoasted, as we happen to

To Sweep Carpets. 
Marian, Racine, Wis. 
Wash, dry and chop potatoes, spread them on one 
side of the room, and sweep across the carpet. 
To Remove Iron Rust. 
Pickles, Ravenswood. 
The juice of lemon and salt placed on the spot, and

Wet the zinc over with muriatic acid, sprinkle over 
it very fine sand or ashes, then scour, wash and dry. 
Or, rub with kerosene. 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 141 

To Remove Fruit Stains. 

Mrs. Kate G., Bryan, 0. 
Place your muslin over a tub, hold it firmly, and 
pour hot water through the spot stained and it will 
soon disappear. This must be done before putting the 
muslin in soapsuds. 

To Polish Furniture. 

Edna, Chicago. 
Mix sufficient vinegar in linseed oil to cut it ; with 
this, saturate raw cotton, over which place soft muslin; 
rub lightly over the article. 

To Polish Metal. 

Aunt Nancy, Joiiet. 
To polish copperware, tea-kettles, reservoirs, etc., 
use a teacup of vinegar and tablespoonful of salt ; heat 
it hot and apply with a cloth, and rub till dry. 

To Remove Mildew. 

S. B., Chicago 
Wet in rainwater ; rub the spots with soap and chalk , 
lay in the sun and dew 2 or 3 days and nights. The 
spot should be thoroughly rubbed with the soap and 
chalk once or twice each day. I have tried this and 
found it effectual. 

Shells. 
Can be thoroughly cleaned by boiling in milk. 

To Mill Mice. 

Mrs. W. A. M., Niles, Mich. 
Spread gas tar around the mice-holes, and you will 
have no further use for cats or traps. 

I.N.P., Peoria. 
Mix equal parts of fine corn-meal and plaster of Paris, 
and set it in dishes on the floor of the harness-room, 
and the mice will leave the harness and premises at 
once. 

To Destroy Cockroaches. 
D. W. M., Jacksonville, 111. 
I have been successful in driving away, if not ex- 
terminating, cockroaches by scattering powdered borax 
in their haunts. 



142 HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 

To Remove Marble Stains. 

Mrs. Will Killem, Chicago. 

Take 2 parts of common soda, 1 part pumice stone, 
and 1 of finely-powdered chalk ; sift through a fine 
sieve, and mix it with water to the consistency of 
paste ; then rub it well over the marble, and the stains 
will be removed. Wash the marble afterwards with 
soap. 

To Clean Silver. 
Kate Somers, Chicago. 

In cleaning silver, do not rub it away with scouring 
materials, but wash in hot water containing a good 
quantity of concentrated lye , or, if very black, boil 
for some time in soft water with a considerable amount 
of washing-soda added ; then wash in a good suds, 
rinse in clear water, and rub with flannel cloth, or 
better, chamois-skin, and your silver will not often re- 
quire cleaning, but will shine like new for a long time. 

To Clean Gloves. 

Polly Perkins, Chicago. 
Buy 1 quart of gasoline at a lamp store, for 5 cents— 
a druggist would ask 20 cents for the same quantity. 
It will clean 4 pairs beautifully. Four a small part, 
say an i, into a dry wash-bowl, put in 1 glove and wash 
immediately, just as though it were a soiled handker- 
chief, being careful to rub harder on the most soiled 
spots ; rinse in clean gasoline ; squeeze out (not wring), 
and in 10 minutes they will be dry. To remove the 
offensive odor, hang them up to air. 

To Color Kid Gloves. 

May Pearce, Chicago. 
India ink, dissolved in water and applied evenly with 
a camel's hair brush, will give a jet black color. A 
i of an ounce of extract of logwood in 2 ounces of 
brandy, will give a lilac ; increase the proportion of 
logwood and a darker color is produced, even nearly 
black. Strong tea gives a handsome brown. 

To Clean Oil Cloths. 

Mrs. F. M. F. y Chicago. 
Wash with warm water ; 150 deg. hot cracks the var- 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 143 

nish. Soap is necessary in smoky districts, though it 
can not be used without dulling the colors somewhat. 
If a sponge is used, examine thoroughly for shells; 
they scratch the varnish. The dirt thus removed, re- 
wash the whole with sweet milk and water ; then wipe 
dry. The milk makes the surface smooth ; dirt does 
not catch readily to it ; the oil in the milk tends to 
restore the colors. Gentle friction with an old silk 
handkerchief will give a polish. 

Renovating Fur. 

Reader, Fon du Lac, Wis. 
Take a large tin pan ; put a pint of wheat flour in it ; 
put the cloak in it ; rub it thoroughly with the hands 
until the flour looks dark ; tnen if the fur is not white 
enough, rub it again with more clean flour; then rub 
it with pulverized chalk— 5 cents worth is enough. 
This gives it a pearly-white look. It is also good to 
clean knit nubias. 

To Remove Ink Stains. 

D. M. W., Jacksonville. 

As soon as possible after the ink is spilled on the car- 
pet, dip a clean sponge in milk, and sponge the ink 
spot, cleansing the sponge again in clean water before 
putting it again in the milk, so as to avoid smearing 
it; continue the operation until all the ink is out; 
then, of course, the milk can be washed out after- 
wards. 

Perhaps every one does not know that the color taken 
out of black goods with acid may be restored by the 
application of liquid ammonia. 

To Retain Colors. 

H. Y. Z., Guttenburg, Iowa. 
To keep the colors of muslins, calicoes, and ging- 
hams bright for a long time, dissolve a piece of alum 
(the size of a shellbark), for every pint of starch, and 
add to it. This will keep the color bright a long time. 

Cleansing Fluid. 

Mother, Chicago. 
Used to wash alpaca, camel's hair, and other woolen 
goods, and invaluable for removing marks on furni- 



144 HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 

ture, carpets, rugs, etc.: Four oz. ammonia; 4 oz. 
white castile soap ; 2 oz. alcohol ; 2 oz. glycerine ; 2 oz. 
ether. Cut the soap fine ; dissolve in 1 quart water 
over the fire ; add 4 quarts water. When nearly cold, 
add the other ingredients. This will make nearly 8 
quarts, and will cost about 75 cents to make it. It 
must be put in a bottle and stoppered tight. It will 
keep good any length of time. Take a pail of luke- 
warm water, and put in about a teacupful of the fluid, 
shake around well in this, and then rinse in plenty ot 
clean water, and iron on wrong side while damp,. For 
washing grease from coat-collars, etc., take a little of 
the fluid in a cup of water, apply with a clean rag, and 
wipe well with a second clean rag. It will make wool- 
en look bright and fresh. 

Excellent Paste. 

Hugo, Hillsdale, Mich. 
One ounce of gum tragacanth — select the white 
flakes ; moisten a part of this (as the whole ounce will 
probably be more than you will want at once) with 
warm water ; then reduce its consistency to suit your 
liking ; if too thin, it will strike through unsized pa- 
per, and, when dry, will give the reading matter a 
dark and illegible appearance. {Should your paste ever 
become dry from exposure, or, as it will in warm 
weather, become sour or moldy, moisten it as from 
time to time it may require with a little good vinegar. 

Glue for Mounting Ferns, Etc. 

Bella, Kankakee, 111. 
Five parts gum arabic ; 3 parts white sugar ; 2 parts 
starch ; add very little water, and boil, stirring until 
thick and white. 

To Make an Aeolian Marp. 

Tom Cat, Spi^ingfield, 111. 
Of very thin pine make a box 5 inches deep, and 7 
inches wide, and a length just equal to the width oi 
the window in which it is to be placed. Across the 
top, near each end, give a strip of wood ■£ inch high 
and i inch thick, for bridges. Into the ends of the box 
insert wooden pins to wind strings around — 2 or 4 pins 
in each end. Make a sounding hole in the middle of 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 

the top, and string the box with blue violin strings. 
The ends of the box should be increased in thickness 
where the pins are inserted by a piece of pine glued 
upon the inside. It is better to have 4 strings, out a 
single string produces a very sweet melody of notes. 
To Make Black Ink. 
Chemist, Chicago. 
Dissolve in an open vessel 42 ounces of coarsely- 
powdered nut-galls, 15 ounces of gum Senegal, 18 
ounces sulphate of iron (free from copper), 3 drachms 
aqua ammonia, 24 ounces of alcohol, and 18 quarts of 
rain water. Mix and let it stand until the fluid has 
assumed a deep black color, then bottle. 

To Wash Flannel. 

Harris & Cobb, Chicago. 
After preparing suds of hot water and soap, wash 
the garment thoroughly with the hands (avoiding a 
wash-board or washing machine of any kind). When 
this is done, rinse in warm water containing a slight 
quantity of soap. Slightly wring the article thus clean- 
ed and hang it up. Take it down while yet a little 
damp, and iron till perfectly soft and dry. Caution ! 
Flannels or woolens of any description should never 
go into water too hot for the hands, or into cold water. 

Washing Iiinen. 

Louise N., Kenwood, 111. 
To wash fine linen so that it will retain its color, 
take as much hay as will color well the amount of 
water you wish to use ; boil and rinse the goods in it, 
using a little soap. Be sure and use this preparation 
for both washing and rinsing. 

To Clean Infants' Socks, W r orsted Goods, Furs, Etc- 
M., Cleveland, O. 
Take a pan with a pint of white flour ; rub the arti- 
cle in the flour well ; shake the flour off out of doors ; 
if there are soiled places still, put it m the flour again. 
It takes a good deal ot rubbing with the flour. This 
will clean almost any knitted worsted article in white 
goods ; also white lace ties, and it will clean white furs 
till they look like new.

TV ashing Black Goods, JLinens, Etc. 

Mrs. M. M. P., Chicago. 
The best method of washing black (mourning) cali- 
coes and dark brown cambrics, is to put a pint of 
wheat bran into 4 quarts of cold water ; boil for § an 
hour ; strain into a tub, and add sufficient warm water 
to wash 1 dress. Do not use soap. Rinse, and add 
blueing to your starch to prevent the white appearance 
starch leaves on dark colors. The bran softens the 
water. Wash brown linen in this way, adding a little 
hay to the bran-water while boiling. If there are 
grease spots on the linen use a little soap on them. 
JBrown linen should not be dried in the sun. 

TV ashing Clothes. 

Old Housekeeper, Chicago. 
Red-border napkins will bear boiling with other 
clothing, but scalding is all that is necessary, as, in- 
deed, it is for all of the washing. For the last 12 years 
I have scalded my clothes instead of boiling them. 
Have, the clothes washed as cleanly as possible, and 
add no soap for the scald. That in the clothes from 
the suds is all that is necessary. In an ordinary-sized 
wash-boiler of water add 1 tablespoonful of ammonia," 
and blueing as desired. Put the clothes in when cold, 
and let them just come to the boil and remove. Rinse 
and dry. The blue put in the scald gives a much 
clearer look than in the rinse, without looking blue. 

To Iron Easily. 

Aunt Nancy, Joliet. 
Put a teaspoonful of kerosene into your cold starch, 
say to a pint, and your iron will not stick. The smell 
will soon pass on ; rub your iron on soap or wax if it is 
rough. 

To Clean l«ace Curtains. 
Aunt Nancy, Joliet. 
To clean lace curtains without washing them : Shake 
the lace gently to remove the loose dust ; then spread 
a clean sheet on a table, and lay the curtains 1 above 
the other with a plentiful sprinkling of unsifted corn- 
meal or bran between them. Then roll them up snug- 
ly, and put away in a safe, dry place for a week or 10 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 147 

days ; then shake the bran out, and with a moderately 
hot iron press out the wrinkles, and your curtains are 
as nice as new. 

To Color Brown, Etc. 

Marsh Mallow, Michigan. 

To color brown : For 4 pounds of cloth or yarn, use 
1 pound of cutch and 4 of bichromate potash. Dissolve 
the cutch in sufficient water to cover the goods, and 
boil them for % an hour ; then dissolve the potash and 
dip the goods into the potash solution until the desir- 
ed shade is obtained. 

Scarlet : For cheap bright red suitable for rag car- 
pets, 1 pound of Nicaragua wood ; boil 2 or 3 hours ; 
then add i a pound of alum ; this will color 3 pounds 
of old flannel, or 2 of new. Let it remain in the dye 24 
hours. 

Green for woolen : To 1 pound of yarn or cloth, 2i 
ounces of alum and 1 pound of fustic. Steep to get 
the strength, but not boil ; soak the goods until it ac- 
quires a good yellow color ; then throw out the chips 
and add Indigo compound slowly until you have the 
desired shade. Rinse in cold water. 

Polish for Linen Cuffs, Etc. 

Aunt Jerusha, Valparaiso, Ind. 
White wax, 3 ounces ; spermaceti, 3 drachms ; borax, 
6 ounces; gum tragacanth, H ounces. Melt together 
with gentle heat. When you have prepared a sufficient 
quantity of starch in the usual manner for a dozen 
pieces, put into it a piece of the polish the size of a 
large walnut — more or less, according to the amount 
of washing. This will make a beautiful polish, and 
also make the goods very stiff. 

Washing Fluid. 

Housewife, Oconomowoc, Wis. 
Here is a washing fluid I have used 6 years, and 
would not be without it : Take 2 pounds salsoda ; dis- 
solve ; take 1 pound unslacked lime ; boil it awhile ; 
then set aside to settle ; drain off, and add water to 
the amount of 2 gallons ; add your salsoda ; set aside 
for use. The night before wash-day, put your clothes 
to soak in warm soap-suds. In the morning put over 



148 HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 

your boiler, and to the boiler f full of water add 1 cup 
of fluid ; wring your clothes from the tub : boil 15 
minutes; then rub through 1 suds, and rinse. It 
bleaches, but does not rot the clothes. 

Soft Soap. 

Mrs. J. A. Pirie, Milwaukee, Wis. 
Try out 14 pounds of grease ; to this add 10 pounds 
of potash, dissolved in just boiling water enough to 
cover the lumps. In 2 or 3 days pour over the mix- 
ture several pailfuls of boiling water. (Be careful to 
use boiling water, as that cooks it). Keep on adding 
the water as fast as the soap thickens until your bar- 
rel is full of nice, sweet, clean soap. It must be stir- 
red hard every time the water is put into the barrel, 
until it is entirely mixed. 

Hard Soap. 

Soap Maker, Chicago. 
Take H pounds of clean, melted grease and 1 gallon 
of ley strong enough to bear an egg. Mix them to- 
gether in a barrel and stir until a good soft soap is the 
result. Then take 6 quarts of this soft soap, 1 pint of 
salt, and a i of a pound of resin ; melt and scald the 
ingredients together, and put it aside to cool. When 
hard cut it, tnrow away the ley that has settled to the 
bottom and melt the soap again to refine it. Pour it 
into a small tub and when hard cut into cakes. 

liice on Canaries. 

Mary, Vincennes. 
To exterminate lice from canary birds, use hollow 
canes for perches ; shake out well mornings into a cup 
of water, and you will catch them all. Two parts 
canary, 1 part rape, and 1 part hemp seed is the best 
food. The canes used are pipe stems. 

To Kill Plant L.iee. 

Etta, Chicago. 

Cigar ashes will kill lice on rose bushes without in- 
juring the plants. I have tried it in many instances 
with great success. 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 149 

Destroying Red Spiders. 

Mrs. W, C. A., Lewiston, 111. 
Wash the plants once or twice a week in good strong 
soap suds — wash thoroughly every leaf on the under 
side with a sponge. Set the pot in a tub of washing- 
suds moderately warm, and throw the suds over them 
then. 

Plant JLioe Exterminator. 

Dabbler, Green Bay, Wis. 
Steep some quassia in water, and then pour over 
the plant, first washing the leaves with it. It is cer- 
tain death to the lodgers, whether lice or worms. 

Raising Canary Rirds. 

Bird Defender, Hillsdale, Mich. 
Place the cage so that no draft of air can strike the 
bird. Give nothing to healthy birds but rape and 
canary seed, water, cuttle-fish bone, and gravel-paper 
or sand on the floor of the cage. No hemp seed. A 
bath 3 times a week. The room should not be over- 
heated — never above 70 degrees. When shedding 
feathers keep warm, avoid all drafts of air. Give 
plenty of German rape seed ; a little hard-boiled egg, 
mixed with crackers grated fine, is excellent. Feed at 
a certain hour in the morning. For birds that are 
sick, or have lost their song, procure bird tonic at a 
bird store. Very many are guilty of great cruelty in 
regard to perches. The perches in a cage should be 
each one of a different size, and the smallest as large 
as a pipe-stem. If perches are of the right sort, no 
trouble is ever had about the bird's toe-nails growing 
too long. Keep the perches clean. The 14th of Feb- 
ruary is the proper time to place the male and female 
in the same cage. 

Everlasting; Whitewash. 

Some years ago the following whitewash was used 
on the east end of the White House, and is as good 
to-day as when first applied : Take i bushel of nice 
unslaked lime ; slake it with boiling water ; cover it 
during the process to keep in the steam. Strain the 
liquid through a fine sieve or strainer, and add to it a 
peck of salt, previously well dissolved in warm water 



150 HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 

3 pounds of ground rice, boiled to a thin paste ; i 
pound of powdered Spanish whiting, and 1 pound of 
clean glue which has been previously dissolved by 
soaking it well, and then hang it over a slow fire in a 
small kettle within a larger one filled with water. Add 
5 gallons of hot water to the mixture, stir it well, and 
let it stand for a few days covered from dust. It should 
be put on hot, and for this purpose it can be kept in a 
kettle on a portable furnace. It is said that about a 
pint of this mixture will cover a square yard upon the 
outside of a house if properly applied. Fine or coarse 
brushes may be used, according to the neatness of the 
job required. It answers as well as oil paint for wood, 
brick, or stone, and is cheaper. It retains its brillian- 
cy for many years. There is nothing of the kind that 
will compare with it, either for inside or outside walls. 
Buildings or fences covered with it will take a much 
longer time to burn than if they were painted with oil 
paint. Coloring matter may be put in and made of 
any shade desired. Spanish brown will make a reddish 
pink, when stirred in, more or less deep, according to 
the quantity. A delicate tinge of this is very pretty 
for inside walls. Finely pulverized common clay, well 
mixed with Spanish brown, makes a reddish stone 
color ; yellow ochre stirred in makes yellow wash, but 
chrome goes further, and makes a color generally es- 
teemed prettier. It is difficult to make rules, because 
tastes differ. It would be best to try experiments on a 
shingle and let it dry. Green must not be mixed with 
lime ; it destroys the color, and the color has an effect 
on the whitewash which makes it crack and peel. 



THE TOILET. 




Tooth Powder. 

Dentist, Chicago. 

IX equal portions of powdered chalk and char- 
coal, adding a small quantity of curd soap. 
This simple recipe not only cleanses the teeth, 
but is a preserva-tive against decay. 
To Whiten and Soften the Hands. 
Mary B., Terre Haute. 
One-half pound of mutton tallow, 1 ounce of cam- 
phor gum, and 1 ounce of glycerine. Melt, and when 
thoroughly mixed, set away to cool. Rub the hands 
with this every night. 

To Remove Freckles. 

Uncle Ben's Niece, Kentland, Ind. 
A very simple and harmless remedy for freckles is 
equal parts of pure glycerine and rosewater, applied 
every night and allowed to dry. 

To Remove Hair. 

Paul H. B., Madison. 
Quicklime, 30 parts ; orpiment, 4 parts , powdered 
gum arabic, 60 parts. Mix and keep in a tightly- 
corked bottle. When used mix with water, so as to 
form a paste. Apply, and let it remain for 5 or 10 
minutes, when the superfluous hair can be removed 
with the back of a knife. The following is a rather 
safe depilatory, and in some respects equal to the for- 
mer : Take a strong solution of sulphuret of barium, 



152 THE TOILET. 

made into a paste with powdered starch. Use as in 
the preceding one. This latter recipe, however, must 
be used immediately after being mixed, as it loses its 
efficiency if kept long. 

To Prevent Hair Turning Gray. 

Paul H. B., Madison. 
Take the hulls of butternuts, say about 4 ounces, 
and infuse in a quart of water for an hour. Then add 
£ an ounce of copperas. Apply with a soft brush every 
second or third day. This preparation is harmless, 
and is far better than those dyes made of nitrate of 
silver. 

To Cure Dandruff. 
Paul H. B., Madison, Wis. 
Dandruff generally comes from an overheated or 
feverish state of the scalp. The cure is simple. Brush 
it well every day ; apply a mixture of bay rum and 
brandy ; avoid much oiling, and wash quite often with 
an egg and soft, tepid water. 

French Curlique. 

Paul H. B., Madison, TTis. 
Oil of sweet almonds, 1 ounce ; spermacetti, 1 
drachm ; tincture of mastich, 3 drachms. Dissolve the 
spermacetti (white wax is as good) in the oil with a 
slow heat, and then add the tincture. Apply a small 
quantity when the hair is to be dressed. This prepa- 
ration is entirely innocent. 

Hints About tlie Hair. 

Paul H. B., Madison, Wis. 

The yolk of an egg will thoroughly cleanse the scalp 
and make the hair soft and glossy — that is, if soft 
water be used. Beware of soap, for the potash it con- 
tains is very objectionable. 

At least 20 minutes each day should be used by those 
who suffer from thin and weak hair in brushing it 
with a stiff brush. Before beginning this, apply every 
day a small quantity of the following : Tincture of can- 
tharides, i ounce ; bay rum and cologne, of each 2 
ounces ; and 1 drachm of oil of rosemary. Do this for 
a month, and the hair will be found to have improved 
wonderfully. Ladies who have, and do not like, red 



THE TOILET. 153 

or blonde hair, will find their hair has grown much 
darker. The weak hairs, by this process, grow strong- 
er, and the coarse ones fall out, causing the hair to 
become healthy and curly. The following method will 
cause bright red hair to become dark brown, or chest- 
nut-hued : Take oils of nutmeg and rosemary, 1 drachm 
each ; castor oil, 1 ounce ; tincture of cantharides, 2 
drachms; strong brandy, 7 ounces. Mix. Wet the 
hair with a small portion of this once a day, and brush 
the hair well with a stiff brush for \ an hour by the 
clock, and ask your lover at the end of 5 or 6 weeks if 
he does not want a fresh lock of your new hair. This 
everyday brushing of the hair is worth more than all 
the " curling fluids " and other like humbugs ever in- 
vented. 

Care of the Hair. 

When the hair grows scantily, naturally, the follow- 
ing lotion may be used 3 or 4 times a week, in the 
morning : Eau-de-Colonge, 2 ounces ; tincture of can- 
tharides, 2 ounces ; oil of rosemary and oil of lavender, 
of each 10 drops. When the hair becomes thin from 
illness, or other causes, use the following recipe : Mix 
equal parts of olive oil and spirits of rosemary ; add a 
few dfops of oil of nutmeg, and anoint the head very 
sparingly before going to bed. When actual baldness 
is commencing, use the following pomade : Macerate 
a drachm of powdered cantharides in an ounce of 
spirits of wine. Shake it wed during a fortnight and 
then filter. Take 10 parts of this tincture and rub it 
with 90 parts of cold lard. Add a little essence of 
bergamot, or any other scent. Kub this pomade well 
into the head night and morning. In 99 cases out of a 
100 this application, if continued, will restore the hair. 
When the hair, after being naturally luxuriant, be- 
gins to grow thin, use the following recipe : Take of 
extract of yellow Peruvian bark, 15 grains ; extract of 
rhatany root, 8 grains ; extract of burdock root, and 
oil of nutmegs (mixed), of each 2 drachms; camphor 
dissolved with spirits of wine, 15 grains ; beef marrow, 
2 ounces; best olive oil, 1 ounce; citron juice, i a 
drachm ; aromatic essential oil, as much as sufficient 
to render it fragrant ; mix ; shake into an ointment. 
Two drachms of bergamot, and a few drops of otto 



154 THE TOILET. 

of roses would suffice. This is to be used every 
morning. 

To Make the Hair Grow. 

Mrs. Will Killem, Chicago. 
Salt and water will not only prevent the hair from 
falling out, but if applied every day will bring out a 
fine growth of soft new hair. Should not be made so 
strong as to leave white particles upon the hair when 
dry. 

For Itching Scalp. 

Mrs. Eve, Kalamazoo. 
One teaspoonful of ammonia, 1 of tincture of arnica, 
and 1 tablespoonf ul of soft water. Use this amount 
for 1 thorough sponging and rubbing of your head, 
and brush till dry. If badly diseased, use twice a 
week. Prepare just what you want for one applica- 
tion each time. 

For IMseased Scalp. 

Aunt Nelly Ely, St. Joe, Mich. 
Buy 25 cents' worth of pine-tar ; take 2 tablespoon- 
fuls and put in an old quart bowl , pour on this 1 pint 
of boiling soft water ; let stand till cool ; remove the 
scum, and pour off in a bottle and cork, and use thor- 
oughly every morning to wet the hair and scalp. It 
will surely cure you. My husband has used this for 
2 years, and now his hair is thick and soft, and has 
hardly a gray hair; besides, the scalp is clean and 
healthy. Keep your tar-bowl always filled with water, 
and pour off when needed ; put in a little more tar 
every 2 months or so. 

All Ahout Preserving and Improving the Com- 
plexion. 

Paul H. B., Madison, Wis. 
All the so-called " Balms," " Blooms of Youth," 
etc., are composed of white lead, glycerine and rose- 
water. For a time such preparations do seem to 
whiten the skin, but in a short time it loses its elastic- 
ity from paralysis of the small nerves, and becomes of 
a dirty, yellowish color. This invariably is the result 
of the application of all the cosmetics containing lead. 



THE TOILET. 155 

Still, there are a number of harmless articles which 
can be used as cosmetics, such as milk of roses, lac 
sulphur, glycerine, bay rum, bitter almonds, oatmeal 
water, and, if a mineral must be used, let it be sub- 
nitrate of bismuth. A few years ago the following 
sold in Paris for $5 a bottle : Pure glycerine and water, 
of each an ounce ; vinegar of cantharides, 40 drops. 
The cantharides slowly destroys the rough, outer skin, 
and leaves the under soft and velvety. Madame Ves- 
tris used to sleep with her face done up in a mixture 
of the whites of eggs, sweet almond oil, and alum. 
This keeps the skin soft, but firm, and retards wrink- 
les. Gowland's Lotion is an excellent preservative of 
the complexion, and is made of 1 ounce of emulsion of 
bitter almonds, and H grains of bi-chloride of mercury. 
If this be applied once a day, on retiring, and the face 
washed in tepid water, on rising, with the following 
soap, no lady need have a poor complexion long. The 
soap is made as follows : A pound of bleached castile 
soap, 4 ounces of fresh, sweet almond oil, 6 ounces of 
oatmeal. Place on the stove in a kettle, and keep 
stirring until all the ingredients are well incorporated. 
Then let it cool, and it is ready for use. The high- 
born ladies of England are noted for the beauty and 
whiteness of their hands. They use the soap above 

fiven. Glycerine is capable of making the skin soft, 
lit it will not whiten it any. The following is the 
recipe for " Sultana," a deservedly-popular cosmetic 
with the titled ladies of London : Take 2 ounces of 
bitter almonds, blanche, and beat into a paste with 1 
ounce of rosewater; then add honey, fine oatmeal, 
and glycerine, 1 ounce each, and when well mixed, 2 
drachms of tincture of benzoin. Apply before a fire a 
short time before retiring. For rendering the com- 
plexion soft, smooth, and brilliant, this preparation 
has no superior. The following is good, and has the 
merit of being more easily prepared than the " Sul- 
tana." It is the French pate au miel, or honey paste : 
Take glycerine, honey, and rosewater, 2 ounces ; sub- 
nitrate of bismuth, 4 drachms, and tincture of benzoin, 
2 drachms. This is to be applied at night, and can 
also be used in the morning instead of soap. 
And now for that torment of so many fair females— 



156 THE TOILET. 

freckles. In many females of a sanguine tempera- 
ment, freckles, even if removed for a time, will be 
sure to return, and, therefore, may be said to be in- 
curable. But in 9 out of every 10 cases the following 
will effect a cure : In the morning on rising, take a 
teaspoonful of lac-sulphur in a few teaspoonfuls of 
milk. Then, for external use, apply the following : 
Corrosive sublimate, 4 grains ; alcohol, 1 ounce. Mix. 
Remember, ladies, that this latter mixture ought not 
to come in contact with the lips. After a few days' 
using, the skin will begin to very slowly peel off, and 
the freckles disappear. Twice daily is sufficient to 
apply it. A French dermatologist recommends the 
following for the same purpose : Take muriatic acid, 
i ounce : alcohol, 1 ounce ; rain water, 7 ounces. Mix 
and apply well with a sponge 3 times daily. When in 
England, a Gypsy woman informed me that she used 
horseradish, boiled in milk, for removing freckles. 
She cured a number of young girls, but whether or 
not she told me the real secret of the means employed, 
I am unable to say, having never given the preparation 
a trial. 

Coltl Cream. 

Helen Blazes, Chicago. 

Take an ounce of rosewater ; 2 ounces of oil of sweet 
almonds ; i an ounce of spermacetti ; 1 drachm of 
white wax ; melt together in a bowl placed in a pan of 
water, boiling. Then remove from the lire, and stir 
until cold. 

For those who prefer " something easier " : One 
ounce glycerine ; 1 ounce rosewater ; 10 drops carbolic 
acid. This is a healing lotion, excellent for sore gtims 
as well as " chaps " — and other excoriations. 

Black-heads, Flesh-worms, Etc. 

Pug, Mattoon, 111. 
They are permanently removed by washing with 
warm water, and severe friction with a- towel, and 
then applying a little of the following preparation : 
Liquor of potassa, 1 ounce ; cologne, 2 ounces ; white 
brandy, 4 ounces. The warm water and friction are 
sometimes sufficient. 



THE TOILET. 157 

Care of the Hands. 

Paul H. B., Madison, Wis. 

What is called cream of roses is also an excellent 
preparation for the hands, either in winter or summer. 
It is made as follows, unless you prefer to purchase it 
at a $1 a bottle : Take compound tincture of benzoin, 
i an ounce ; almond and Malaga oil, of each an ounce ; 
ottar of roses, 5 drops ; honey, 2 ounces ; and enough 
rose water to make the mixture measure 6 ounces. Ap- 
ply as often as you like. 

A mixture of lemon-juice and powdered borax is also 
another fine whitener of the skin, but should only be 
used in warm weather. This is admirably suited to 
those ladies whose general health is not good and who 
have, consequently, bluish hands, in which the blue 
veins show too strongly. 

Ladies who do their own housework are apt, if they 
do not wear gloves, to havp coarse hands. If they 
happen to dip them into waitr, they do not take time 
enough to dry them well before going on with their 
work. To wipe the hands perfectly dry after their be- 
ing immersed in water, is imperatively necessary, if 
they wish their hands to look white. To keep the 
hands from chapping in cold weather, use a mixture 
of glycerine, 1 ounce ; spermacetti, 2 drachms ; olive 
oil, 2 ounces. Mix together with the aid of heat. Ap- 
ply this every night, and, if time will admit of it, 
every morning. In winter, do not wash them in cold 
or hot water. It should be just blood warm, and no 
more or less. Do not go out of doors with them un- 
covered. In summer, use cold water, unless the hands 
perspire very much, as the hands of some people do. 
These latter should use tepid water. In warm weather, 
a good preparation for the hands is this : Take £ an 
ounce of powdered alum, the whites of 2 eggs, and mix 
together. Then add enough bran to make into a thick 
paste. Apply this once a day, after washing, and after 
rubbing the hands together well for a few minutes, 
wipe off with a soft towel. This will give them a soft, 
brilliant hue, and check any undue amount of pers- 
piration. 



THE SICK ROOM, ETC. 



Catarrh Remedy. 

Medico, Chicago. 

QUAL parts of gum arabic, gum myrrh, and 
bloodroot, made into a powder, and used as a 
snuff, is an unfailing remedy for catarrh. 

Chilblain .Lotion. 

Dr. Foot, Chicago. 
Dissolve 1 ounce of muriate of ammonia m £ a pint 
of cider vinegar, and apply frequently. One-half pint 
of alcohol may be added to this lotion with good effect. 

Removing Warts. 

Ella Hosraer, Danville. 
Get at the drug store 5 or 10 cents' worth of oil of 
cinnamon ; wet the warts thoroughly three times a day 
till they disappear. 

Hot Water for Bruises. 

Bruises and injuries do much better when treated 
with hot than cold water. The temperature should be 
about 103 o pah. 

Bands for Children. 

S., Chicago. 
If the bowel complaint should become troublesome, 
keep a flannel band bound snugly around through all 
the hot weather. It supports the bowels, keeps them 
warm ? and will often cure the trouble when medicine 
and diet have been of no avail. 



THE SICK KOOM, ETC. 

Care of Sick Children. 

Mary Moore, Chicago. 

I find that diet, bathing and quiet are the most 
effective remedies I can use. I took a child safely 
through measles, whooping-cough and teething with 
only common sense and general knowledge of the laws 
of health to guide me. 

This time the children had a remittent fever — cold 
chills alternating with fever, When their feet were 
cold and heads hot, I applied hot water to the feet and 
cold water to the head. When the fever came on I 
sponged off the whole body with cool water, wiping 
lightly with a soft towel. I kept them on a light diet 
ot such articles as would keep the bowels open— oat- 
meal, Graham crackers, etc. If this was not sufficient, 
I gave warm water injections. I kept them quiet as 
possible in mind and body, making them sleep all they 
could. And this treatment, with the blessing of God, 
brought them through all right. 

Croup. 

Isadora, Monroe, Mich. 
As soon as my little ones begin to choke up and 
cough like croup, I bind a napkin wet with cold water, 
and a dry one over it, around the throat, and give a 
good dose of sirup of ipecac. The cloths must be 
changed every few minutes till the choking is over. 
If necessary, give the ipecac or hive sirup till the child 
begins to vomit. 

Cough Medicine. 
Anna B., Pittsficld, 111. 
One-half ounce essence of peppermint ; \ ounce es- 
sence of cinnamon ; $ ounce of laudanum ; 2 ounces of 
paregoric— mixed with the same quantity of molasses. 
Dose : A teaspoonf ul to a tablespoon 3 or 4 times a 
day, or oftener if the cough is very bad. 
Dyspepsia Remedy. 
Sympathizer, Peoria. 
On 2 tablespoonfuls of unslacked lime pour 1 quart

ach pains. 

Drinks for Invalids. 

Annie M. Hale, Chicago. 
Take crusts of genuine brown bread (rye and Indian). 
These should be slowly toasted before an open tire un- 
til thoroughly dried and of a rich, dark brown. Break 
them into small bits ; put them into the coffee pot ; 
pour on boiling water, and let the infusion steep from 
i an hour to an hour. Let the pot stand a few min- 
utes after being removed from the fire. The coffee 
will be clear and of a tine color, and if served with 
rich milk or cream, can hardly fail to please an un- 
spoiled palate. It is nutritious and innocent. A 
tablespoonful of ground Mocha or Java put in the 
coffee pot 10 minutes before it is taken from the tire 
will give it both flavor and aroma. The crusts of 
whatever bread may be used in a similar manner. 

Corns, Bunions, and Ingrowing Nails. 

A Friend, Normal, 111. 
Acetic acid is a safe and painless remedy for corns 
and bunions. A few applications night and morning 
will dispel all soreness. A continued application will 
remove them. Inverted toe-nails can be cured with- 
out causing any pain, by simply making a notch in the 
center of the end of the toe-nail in shape of the letter 
V. It causes the sides of the nail to come above and 
over the flesh. Continue this as fast as the nail grows 
out, and it will always keep its proper shape and 
position. 

How to Get Fat. 

Mrs. Sophia F., Chicago, 
If you will try my recipe I think you will succeed in

time a glass of lager beer with eggs. It is prepared in 
the following manner : Take the yolk of 1 egg and 4 
teaspoontuls ot white granulated sugar ; beat well and 
till the glass with beer. It is an agreeable drink, and 
will make any one what I am now getting to be— fat.

INTRODUCTORY 



I 



This little volume is sent forth in the confident belief 
lat it is the Ne Plus Ultra of Cook Books, or Guides 
Housekeepers. Unlike the trashy cook and recipe 
[oks vended about the country for $1.50 or $2.00 a 
jpy, " hashed " up from irreeponsible sources, more 
|th a view to size and show than to practical utility, 
Home Guide is a collection of the actual and 
ictical experiences, and in the language of 500 lady 
[ome "keepers. It is a compilation and condens- 
[ation of the thousands of recipes and hints contributed 
)y the lady readers of the Chicago Tribune, and pub- 
[shed in the popular " Home " department of that 
iper during the past two years, 
'he contents embrace a very wide range of subjects 
lining to Cookery, which is, of course, the chief 
ire of tlie book. Every branch of the " culin- 
irt" is treated by practical, successful house- 
srs, and in a common sense manner, such as will, 
'lipon examination, be appreciated and understood by 
every lady who looks well to the health and happiness 
of 'heEi^ily. 

T'^Wyfcrt" of good cooking is a most valuable 
mt to every household. It not only contrib- 



^

utes to health, good temper and domestic peace, but ; 
saves many dollars in grocers' bills. Great quantitij 
of good food is wasted in American kitchens, for t| 
sole reason that housekeepers lack the valuable accoi 
plishment of knowing how to prepare it in various a] 
inviting forms. 

In the other Departments of the book will be f oi 
many valuable Recipes and Hints upon various s^ 
jects pertaining to the Household, the Toilet, and 
Sick Room. And, finally, although unpretentioi 
size, the reader will find upon due examination 
" The Home Guide " is rich and voluminous in pi 
tical and useful information. 



COOKERY. 



i 




SOUP. 

S an introductory to the soup department, tlie 
following letter from "the best unprofessional 
cook in Chicago," is given : 

Mrs. Sarah L., of Chicago. 

I believe it was nearly a year ago that I wrote my first 
letter to the Trilrune, the bm'den of which was soup. If 
I have a hobby, this is it. A Frenchman once said, 
"Vat a peoples are ze Americans. Zesty kind of re- 
ligions and but one kinds of soup. Mon dieu!" And, 
I have often thought, if we had one kind of religion, 
perhaps, and 30 kinds of soup, we should be a healthier 
people. 

Now, knowing that the circles of readers has in- 
creased marvelously since I first talked about soups, I 
must beg of you, Mr. Editor, to let me return to my old 
subject, for it lays very near my heart, and urge upon 
mothers of young children to adopt this method of pre- 
paring soup for their principal meal in the middle of 
the day. 

If dinner is to be served at 12 o'clock, the piece of 
meat, costing 20 cents, must be put on the fire at 8, in 
about three quarts of cold water. After it has boiled 
up, skim oft" everything that may rise, as well as the 
grease, if it should be a fatish piece of meat. Then 
peel and cut an onion in pieces, and salt, about a great 
spoonful. Let it boil slowly all the time. In an liour 
or so peel and cut in slices 2 potatoes, i a small turnip, 
and a piece of carrot. They must all boil up fine ; 
about 2 quarts of water must always be kept over the 
meat. At the same time the meat is put on the range, 
another kettle, holding about 2 or 3 quarts, containing 
2i cups of split peas, with just enough w^ater to keep 



8 COOKERY— SOUP. 

them from burning, must be set in a place where they 
will just boil. When more water is needed add the 
soup or bouillons— always boiling. About 20 minutes 
before dinner is to be served, pour all the liquor from 
the meat into the peas, which will make a soup about 
as thick as flour porridge. If not salt enough add 
more, and a linle pepper. When the family is seated 
around the table, let the girl dish the soup hot from the 
kettle into each soup-plate. This soup must be hot or 
it is not good. 

Bean and tomato soup I make in the same way, only 
the tomatoes will cook in an hour all that they need. 
These 3 kinds are good and nourishing in the spring, 
and every child commg home from school should have 
a plate to set his or her hungry stomach to work upon. 
The rest of the dinner the stomach is then prepared for. 

In my family I have some kind of soup almost every 
day in the week, and I believe it has made me a new 
stomach in the last 6 years. I was brought up on 
mince pies, roast beef, cocoanut cake and preser\"es. 
Now I eat my soup, a piece of the soup m^at, ^vith 
mustard, horse radish, or a little catsup, some good 
mashed potatoes, a puree, or some weU-cooked vege-^ 
table, a pudding for dessert, and I have no more dys4g 

Sepsia, and my children are the pictures of health. I» 
on't mean that the above is always our dinner, but* 
sometimes. Ladies, tr\' it. We have all been brought^ 
up on too rich food. The nearer we live to nature the- 
better bodies and minds we shall have. 

I was reading a book the other day, and came across 
this old English proverb : "'Eggs or an hour, fish of 
ten, bread of a day, wine of a year, a woman of 15, and 
a friend of 30." I might agree with the proverb in 
some respects, but a woman and friend are good for 
nothing until 40. So says ''my man.*' 

Turkey Soup. 

Bertha Carlyle^ Hyde Park. 
Save all the bones and break the backbone into 2 or 3 
pieces ; boil these in a little more water than you want 
soup, for an hour ; then skim out the bone, and put in 
the meat, cut in very small pieces, and boil a few mo- 
ments more ; then season with a little salt and pepper.

Ihen add one teaspoon of soda, when it will foam- 
immediately add 1 pint of sweet milk, with salt, pepper 
and plenty of butter. When this boils, add 8 small 
crackers, and serve. It tastes very much like ovster 
soup. "^ 

Turkey Soup. 

E. A. E., Chicago. 
 -^^^/ll^^? bones, the scraps of meat, and the dress- 
ing of the turkey in a kettle, with enough water to 
cover them. Let it boil for 2 hours. When nearly 



10 COOKERY— sotrp. 

done add the tops of some celery chopped fine, and a 
teaspoonful of ciirrie powder. When it is done, strain 
and set on the table hot. It makes a very rich, nice 
dish. 

Amie M. Haie, M. D., Chicago. 

Boil a veal bone 3 hours with turnip, celery, onion, 
carrots, and whatever suitable thing else you have 
which will not turn it dark. Strain and boil again ; 
just before you serve it add a pint of cream or milk, 
Avith 3 eggs well beaten ; remove from the stove and 
stir rapidly. 

Vesetable ^onp. 
Mrs. Sarah I/., Chicago. 

Scrape 2 carrots, an onion, i of a cabbage, and 2 
turnips. Cut them in pieces a little larger tluin dice. 
Put the pieces in a large sauce-pan with a little butter 
and water ; let it cook i hour ; then cut your potatoes 
in the same way. Take your meat out of the soup- 
kettle, skim off the grease and put all into your broth, 
and let cook another i hour. In tne language of the 
average school-girl, "it's perfectly lovely." 



*^oap Medley."

pint of water, a little butter, salt and pepper. jBoil 
gently for 15 or 20 minutes. 

Xoodle Soup. 

''Mrs. C. G. M.," Chicago. 
Break 2 eggs into a bowl ; beat imtil light, adding a 
pinch of salt ; then work in flour (with your hand) 
until you have a very stiff dough; tm-n it on voiu* 
molduig board, and work until it is as smooth as glass,; 
pinch off a piece the size of a walnut, and roll it as 
thin as paper ; then with a shari) knife cut off very 
narrow strips ; proceed in the same way until all your 
dough is cut. Have prepared some good veal, chicken, 
or any other kind of broth, well seasoned, i an hour 
before you serve dinner ; drop in the noodles. Be sm-e 
the soup is boiling. Add a little parslev. If the 
noodles are made according to directions, they will be 
found far superior to maccaroni. 

Tomato Soap. 

''Mrs. E. S. P.," Burlington, Iowa. 
Put a tablespoonful of drippings or butter in a stew- 
pan ; cut an onion fine and fry in the butter ; then add 
one pint of tomatoes, pepper, salt and a tcaspoonful 
of allspice ; cut a round steak in two and lay on the 
tomatoes; cover closely and let it simmer for three 
hours.

FISH. 



Boiled Fish. 

Ddmonico'8 Method. 

M a reliable source, the following is presented 
as Delmonico's method for boiling fish : 



Fish should be washed as little as possible, and 
whitefish, after being cleaned and wiped with a damp 
cloth, should have the stomach stuffeci witli salt for an 
hour or two before cooking. Fish should be put on in 
cok- water, so that the inner part may be suthciently 
done, and it is also less liable to break. This rule holds 
good, except for very small fish, or for salmon boiled in 
slices, when boiling water should be used. The time 
may be easily known when it is ready by drawing up 
the fish-plate and trjing if it will separate from the 
bone. A little salt and vinegar should ahvavs be put 
into the water. Some prefer their fish boiled in what 
is called a court bouillon, and this is how it is done : 
Lay the fish in the kettle with enough cold water to 
cover it, add a glass of wine or vinegar, some sliced 
carrot and onions, pepper, salt and a laurel leaf, a 
bunch of parsley, a fagot of sweet herbs, or some of 
the same tied up in a muslin bag. These seasonings 
impart a fine flavor to most boiled fish, excepting sal- 
mon, and for fresh-water fish it is considered very use- 
ful for getting rid of the muddy taste they often have. 
Boiled Fish. 
Mrs. M. A. D., Chicago. 

After well cleansing a good-sized fish, put into a fish- 
kettle, and set into a pot of boiling water well salted ; 
let it boil for 20 minutes ; take of vinegar sufficient to 
cover ; put into the vinegar 1 ounce of cloves, 1 of all- 
spice and 1 of pepper whole ; boil all together for 15 
minutes ; when nearly cold pour over the fish ; let it 
stand for 2 or 3 hours oef ore using. 



COOKERY— FISH. 13 

Baked Fish. 

Mrs. W. S. G., Baraboo, Wis. 
Scale, wash and wipe dry, inside and out, a 2 or 3 
pound fish. Make a stuffing as follows: One pint 
grated bread ; 2 tablespoonfuls melted butter ; pepper 
and salt to taste; 1 raw egg; a little celety salt; 1 
onion, chopped fine, is, to my taste, an improvement, 
but can be omitted if not liked. Care should be taken 
not to wet the bread-crumbs ; the egg and melted bu- 
ter will moisten sufficiently. Tie over the fish thin 
slices of salt pork ; fill a dripping pan i full hot water ; 
then, if you have not a wire grate, place the gridiron on 
the pan, and after laying the fish on the gridiron cover 
all with another pan ; bake in a hot oven till the pork 
is well shrivelled ; then remove the upper tin, allowing 
your fish to brown. U hours will cook thoroughly, if a 
steady fire is kept. 

Mrs. E, G.y Geneva. 
First, dip the fish quickly in boiling water; then 
wipe the scales off ; rinse in cold water ; wipe it diy ; 
sprinkle salt both inside and out, about as much as you 
would for steaks. Then dip it in flour ; place the pan 
that you are going to bake it in in the stove with a 
piece of butter in it the size of an egg. Let it melt so 
that it covers the pan. Your pan should be about the 
length of your fish ; if larger, the butter will be apt to 
bm-n. Place your fish in it, the inside of it next to the 
pan. Put it m a hot oven, and bake 1 hour, if it is a 
large fish, less time if smaller. It should be well done 
and of a nice brown color. 

Mrs. S. D. L.. Chicago. 
Skin and bone the fish, by running a sharp knife 
along the back. Spread over dripping-pan a thin 
layer of butter, i an onion in fine pieces. Lay the fish 
upon it, and pour over the fish 1 talblespoonful of vine- 
gar or Catawba wine. For the sauce, rub butter, the 
size of a walnut, and flour together, add a cup of the 
broth or hot water, the juice of the fish, 2 or 3 mush- 
rooms, if you have them. Turn this mixture over the 
fish, dust with bread crumbs, salt and pepper, and bake 
a few minutes or until a little broA;\Ti. Garnish with 
pieces of bread cut heart-shape. 



14 COOKERY— FISH. 

Mrs. Sarah L., Chicago. 

Dry with a towel, and put belly to back in dri;)ping- 
pan, into which you have previously cut up 2 slices of 
salt pork in inch pieces. Make a stuffing as for veal. 
Stuff, putting only a little in. Now pour over the fish 
a spoonful of lenion-iuice or good vinegar. After a 
little, baste with a little soup-broth. Don't let the fish 
dry all up, and don't put a drop of water on it. Make 
your sauce as for veal cutlets, omitting the lemon 
juice, but add i cup of milk and cut up 2 hard-boiled 
eggs into it. When done, also add the fish-juice. A 
little parsley chopped fine in the sauce, we like. Gar- 
nish with hard-boiled eggs and sprigs of parsley, 
moimted by Utile carpels of lemon. 
M. A, D.. Chicago. 

Take bread crumbs sufficient for the size of the fish ; 
beat 2 or 3 eggs : pepper and salt ; add 1 bunch of pars- 
ley, fresh, and chopped fine ; mix all together well ; add 
a small piece of butter ; put all into the fish and sew up. 
If any of the dressing is left, put into the bake-pan ; 
add a pint of boiling water ; put into a hot oven ; baste 
every 10 or 15 minutes for an hour, when it will be well 
cooked and nicely flavored. 

E. L. M., Chicago. 

Buy a 2-pomid white fish. If the gills are red, eyes 
full, body firm and stiff, the fish is good. Scale it, cut 
off the head, and split the fish nearly down to the tail, 
make a dressing of bread-crumbs, a little buttera)ep- 
per and salt, slightly moistened with water. Stuff the 
fish with this ; then bind it together with fine cotton 
cord or tape, 3 inches apart. Lay the fish on a wire 
gridiron in a di'ipping-pan, and pour around it a little 
water and melted butter. With a spoon dip this up 
and pour over the fish frequently. Bake 1 hour. Serve 
with the gravy of the fish or drawn butter. 

Fried Fish. 

M. A. £>., Chicago. 

When the fish is properly cleansed, instead of putting 

it into a small quantity of fat or grease, wipe dry ; then 

rub with plenty of salt and pepper ; let it lay an hour 

or two before using ; roll in corn-meal or flour ; have 



COOKERY— FISH. 15 

ready lat sufficient for it to swim in ; the fat mT:3t be 
Ijoili-.g-hot ; put the fish in whole, or cut iu piec:' . It 
will come out nicely browned, and not filled with fat, 
as in the ordinary way of frying. 

Frying Fish. 

N.M.G, New York. 

The artistic mode of frying fish is what is called the 
wet process, which is simply boiling it in fat. Butter 
should never be used, as the color : .ever is good. Lard 
is considered by many to be the best frying medium, 
but Careme. the great French cook, gives the prefer- 
ence to beer fat^not, however, the dripping from the 
roast, but lard made by melting beef ::uet. We recom- 
mend as best and most economical drippings from the 
joints while roasting, pom'ed into boiling water, and 
removed in a cake when cold. The great point is to 
have the fat at a proper temperature before the article 
to be fried is i)ut in. The skillful cook can see the blue 
smoke rising just at the boiling point, and then she 
knows it is time to put in her fish ; but for those who 
are only acquiring experience it is safer to throw in a 
bit of bread, and if it takes a fine color in a minute or 
so, then the fat is hot enough, and the fish may be put 
in. This is the cardinal point of successful frying, as 
otherwise the fish will be flabby and greasy instead of 
crisp and appetizing. Another point to be attended to 
is that the fat be deep enough in the pan to cover the 
fish, which should be put in a wire basket that will fit 
easily into the pan of fat, and then no turning is re- 
quired. When done strain it into boiling water ; when 
cold take it off in a cake, and put it by to fry fish again. 
Sauces for Fisli. 
(Georgia H., Chicago. 

To serv^e with fish : 1 cup vinegar ; 1 cup water ; 
yolks 2 eggs ; 1 large spoon butter ; 1 spoonful mustard 
and corn-starch blended ; sugar, salt and pepper ; mix 
all cold ; heat it gradually and boil for a minute. This 
dressing is also nice, when cold, with salmon, lobster, 
lettuce, etc. 

Fish Sauce. 
Mrs. M. O. L., Chicago. 

Take a pint of milk and the fish drippings mixed ; a 



16 COOKERY— FISH. 

little salt and pepper ; mix until smooth, 2 ounces of 
butter and two teaspoonfuls of flour; stir into the 
liquor when boiling; have ready a hard-boiled egg, 
chopped fine, to add \vhen ready for the table. 
lSte\%-ed Codfish. 
Mrs. C. E., Minonk, Ills. 
First, be sure and pick the meat off from the bones ; 
then let it stand in water for 15 minutes ; then take it 
out of the water and put in milk. To make the quan- 
tity you may need, beat 3 eggs and put into it a pint of 
milk, a piece of butter half the size of an egg ; thicken 
this with a tablespoonful of flour stirred up with a very 
liiile water. As soon as it boils it is done. 

Codfish Balls. 

E. B., Colduater, Mich. 

Cut up the fish into small bits, enough to make 2 even 
pints \ remove every bone • pour cold water over it to 
rinse it off, and soak in cold water about H hours ; then 
diain the water off ; put it cooking with suflicient boil- 
ing water to cover it ; let it simmer, not boil, for 20 
mmutes ; then drain the water all off ; pour in U pints 
of new milk; add a lump of butter size of hen's egg. 
Take i pint of milk ; rub into it three tablespoons of 
flour— every lump must be dissolved ; stir in two eggs, 
well beaten, and a little black pepper. When the milk 
boils up, stir in this mixture ; cook 5 minutes longer, 
stirring the most of the time. Serve immediately in a 
warmed vegetable-dish. This quantity will be sufli- 
cient for a family of six, and enough left for codfish 
balls. 

Busy Bee, Ottumwa, Iowa, 

Pick up fine a teacupful nice white codfish, freshen 
over night in water, pour away this in the morning, add 
i teacup of fresh water. 1 large spoonful of butter. 2 
eggs, beat all w^ell together and heat till hot, but do 
not boil ; mash and season nicely some potatoes, stii* 
into the codfish mixture till stiff enough to put in flat 
cakes, and fry in hot butter a nice brown , should be 
turned once. 

E. D., Chicago. 
After dinner, take the mashed potatoes (of which 



COOKERY— FISH. 17 

there should be a double quantity prepared for dinner), 
and fish that is left, using i fish and t potatoes. Stir 
and beat them together while warm, till evenly mixed. 
When cold— for the mixtiu-e will be so soft it cannot be 
handled while warm — make them into cakes f inch 
thick and as large around as a teacup ; put them in a 
cool place for breakfast. In the morning* roll them in 
flour ; have plenty of butter in the frying-pan just hot 
enough not to burn ; fry quickly to a nice brown on 
both sides. Turn carefully that they may keep their 
shape. Serve as soon as done. 

Mrs. S. W. L., Tuscola^ Ills. 
Take of nice white codfish about 2 pounds ; put into 
a kettle with sufficient cold water to cover the fish, and 
let it boil till perfectly tender ; then remove to a pan of 
cold water ; the fish can then be easily separated from 
bones , skin, etc. Place in an earthen or bright tin mix- 
ing-pan, and mash fine, with about double the quantity 
of nicely steamed potatoes, and 3 or 4 slices of light 
bread crummed, or previously soaked in milk ; add 2 
eggs and a tea cup of butter, with black pepper to suit 
taste. Mash and mix thoroughly, and make as moist 
as is wished with sweet milk. It is sometimes neces- 
sary to add a little salt. Make into flat balls, and fry- 
in hot lard, as you would mush. This mixture will 
keep in cool weather a number of days. 

Anna Bell, Springfield. 

Take i a codfish, put in a pot, fill with cold water at 
night, in the morning pour off the water, fill up with 
fres h water, stand it on the back of the stove for 3 hours 
let it come to a scalding heat, not boiling. Take off 
the skin and pick out the bones, put in a tray and chop 
fine, have potatoes boiled and chop with the fish, double 
the quantity of potatoes to the fish, mix well together, 
make in balls, with the hands flattening them a little, 
have your frying pan hot, with a tablespoonf ul of lard ; 
fry to a nice brown. 

Bechamel Sauce. 
Mrs. Sarah i,, Chicago, 

This sauce is good for almost everything, such as car- 
rots, turnips, asparagus, fish, and, with sugar and wine 



18 COOKERY— POULTRY. 

or brandy added, is good for steamed puddings, cake 
pudding, rice, etc., etc. Mix cold, and well together, in 
a tin saucepan, 2 ounces of butter, a tablespoon ful of 
flour; then aad a pint of milk; stir continually, and, 
when thickened, take off the fire. Beat the yolk of an 
egg in a cup, with a teaspoonful of water. Timi into 
the sauce and mix well ; salt a little and pepper for 
vegetables ; but for puddings, nutmeg and brandy or 
wine. 



POTILTRY. 



Selecting Fowls. 

8, H. 3f., Chicago. 

In selecting a goose or duck, take hold of the toes 
and pull them apart ; if the web separates easily it is 
young, but if it requires any very ^eat amount of phy- 
sical force to separate, lay it one side — 'tis an old fowl, 
and you will reap no profit from its purcha.se, unless 
you are keeping boarders. Tiukeys may be selected by 
pressing the end of the breast bone. If they are young 
tnere is a gristle at the end which \N'ill readily >aeld to 
the pressure— if old, the end mil be found hard and 
sharp, and you caimot bend it. By strictly following 
these instructions no one need ever buy an old fowl. 
Broiled Cliickeii- 
F., Chicago. 

Split down the back ; pound lightly ; put on the grid- 
iron ; lay a tin baking-pan over the chicken ; set on the 
pan a flatiron— the weight ^ill hold the bud in place 
and keep in the juices. Chicken cooked in this way 
wiU be tender and eat well warm or cold. Serve ^^'ith 
with hot apple-sauce. 

Fried Chicken. 

Aunt Lucy, Chicago. 
Cut your chicken to pieces according to the size ; if 
very young, just in half; if good size, divide at the 



COOKERY— POULTRY. 19 

joints ; see that it is thoroughly cleaned. Wipe it with 
a clejin bit of muslin. Beat up 2 eggs, have a plate of 
floui-, dip each piece first in the flour, then in the egg, 
season with salt and pepper, here pour lard hissing hot 
in your skillet, put your chicken in ; when brown on 
one side turn it, oro^sTi the other, place upon the plat- 
ter, mix a tablespoon of flour smoothly into a cup of 
sweet milk, pom* into the fat, stir, boil a few minutes, 
pour it over the chicken, and I guess anybody's hus- 
band will think it pretty good. I fry veal cutlets the 
same way. 

Boned Turkey. 

Mrs, Mm Chicago, 
First, make the stufling to suit the family taste. I 
took tenderloin— not too lean — chopped it fine ; a tea- 
cup of cracker crumbs ; 2 eggs ; a pint of oysters ; some 
summer savory ; pepper and salt : mix all well ; had 
my large needle and stout thread handy, with some 
two-inch- wide soft bleached old cotton cloth. Now for 
3^our turkey. It being well cleaned and singed, be 
careful not to break the outside skin. Cut off the legs 
so as to cut all the tendons where they join the drum- 
stick. Cut the first joint from the wing ; leave a good 
length of skin for the neck. Every bone must be taken 
out from the inside. Beginning with the legs, cut each 
ligament at the side bone joint, strip the knife close 
along the bone, so as to cut the flesh clean off, and draw 
the bone out ; when both legs are boneless, follow along 
the back, breast and wings. The neck is more diflicult, 
but get it out nicely as you can. Xow your tiu:key is 
one shapeless slump; but begin stuffing at the neck, 
from the inside ; havmg tied securely the skin to pre- 
vent escape, fill out the wings, breast, body and legs. 
Xow sew up the skin ; bandage it in a shapely manner 
with your strips, not too tight, for fear of the stuffing 
swelling so as to burst the skin ; salt and pepper the 
outside and steam until perfectly tender. If it's an old 
chap steam 4 or 5 hours. When done, put a tin plate 
and a couple of flat-irons on top of it to press until cold. 
Then cut m nice thin slices. 

Mr9. S., Fon du IjOC, Win. 
Buy a turkey, one that has not been drawn, so as to 



20 COOKERY— POITLTTIY. 

have no openings in it if possible ; if drawn, sewing up 
openings firinly before Doning; 2 chickens, 1 beef 
tongue, 1 can oysters, 1 pounof fresh, lean side pork. 
Have the tiurkey frozen and thawed, the tongue boiled 
and skinned, the pork roasted, the oysters taken out of 
the liquor, the chickens cut in small pieces, and put on 
to boil with just water enough to cover. Lay the tur- 
key on its breast ; cut off the legs and wings at first 
joint ; cut down the wliole length of the back, and with 
a sharp knife scrape the meat at each side from the 
bones ; throw the bones in with the chickens to boii. 
now for the filling : First, lay the wiiole tongue to form 
the breast ; clear all the chicken meat from the bones ; 
cut the pork in small pieces ; fill up your turkey, legs, 
wings and all (first tying ends of legs and wings tight), 

fpwith chicken, pork and oysters, and a little dressing. 

^ have the chicken liquor well boiled and seasoned, and 
strain it into the turkey, which will form a jelly. Sew 
up the turkey firmly ; turn it over and shape it nicely 
with the hands. Tie a cord tightly to the neck, and 
draw it round and tie it to the right wing close to the 
body. Tie down legs and wings, inserting skewers if 
you have them. Sew around it a piece of strong cloth, 
and steam or roast, and leave the cloth on till cold. 
Carve cold in round, thin slices, commencing at the 
neck. 

Boiled Ooose. 
Mrs. D. H, H., Chicago, 
Dress and singe, put into a deep dish, cover with 
boiling milk and leave over night. In the morning 
wash off the milk, and put the goose into cold water on 
the fire ; when boiling hot take it off, wash it in warm 
water and dry with a cloth. This process takes out the 
oil. Fill the body with a dressing of bread crumbs sea- 
soned with pepper, salt, butter and two chopped onions, 
if relished, and a little sage. Put the goose into cold 
water and boil gently until tender. Serve with giblet 
sauce, and with pickles, or acid jellies. 
Cousin German, Chicago. 
Cook forur calf's feet in 3 quarts of water slowly until 
done ; strain it. Xow put goose in a pot, pour over it 
the broth of tlie calf's feet and so much water that the 



COOKERY— POULTRY. 21 

goose is well covered by it ; add some vinegar, spices, 
salt and onion, and the half i)eel of a lemon ; cover it 
and boil slow until the goose is soft. Let it cool off in 
the broth, take out the goose after it is cold, cut all the 
meat off the bones and lay it acely in a deep earthen 
dish. Take all the fat of the broth, taste it, add more 
vinegar and salt if necessary ; let it run through a cloth, 
and pour it over the meat. It will be nice and stiff" 
after 24 hours, and you eat it cold with bread or cracker. 
If you can get gelatine it will be so much simpler to 
prepare it. Boil the goose in water, vinegar and spices 
as above ; after the goose is soft add 3 ounces of gela- 
tine dissolved in cold water, and proceed just as before. 
The toughest meat will get tender, if boiled with vine- 
gar. American cooks always steam the goose before 
roasting. Try it once without steaming. Rub it with 
salt in and outside ; put a little water in your frying 
pan, and roast it in a hot oven 2 or 3 hours, according 
to the size, and if it is a young goose you will find it 
superb. 

Pressed Chicken. 
Gypsy, Ionia, Mich. 

Boil 1 chicken until tendei ; cnop fine ; season well 
with pepper, salt and butter , put into a cloth ; put a 
weight upon it and press like head cheese. 

Beatrice, Iowa. 

Boil fowls until tender. Remove the meat from the 
bones and chop very fine, keeping the dark and white 
meat separate. Boil the liquor down until it will jelly ; 
place in a deep buttered dish a layer of the dark meat ; 
season with salt and pepper and cover with liquor; 
then a layer of white meat seasoned, and cover with 
the liquor. Use the liquor when full, put a weight on 
it, and it will mold firmly. 

Matid H., Milwaukee. 

Boil a chicken thoroughly; skin it and pick it to 
pieces ; season with salt and pepper ; put in a bag, and 
place it under a press ; let it remain over night, and 
next day it will be ready for use.

• Chieken Pie. 

Isadora, Monroe Mieh. 
Make the crust like baking-powder biscnit, only a 
tntle shorter. Roll half an inch thick and line a 4 
quart tin-pan with it. Have ready 2 small chickens, 
boiled till tender. Place the pieces of chicken smoothly 
in the pan; sprinkle salt, and pepper, and a little 
flour over them ; add a few pieces of butter, size of a 
hazelnut, about a large tablespoonf ul in all ; pour on a 
little of the liquor they were boiled in ; then roll the top 
crust rather more than half-inch thick ; cut large stars 
or air-holes in it. Bake till crust is thoroughly done. 

Fried Chieken witli Oysters. 

Take a nice tender chicken, open it down the back, 
and after cleaning it well pound all the bones flat; 
wash, and wipe it dry on a clean towel ; then season 
with peppei and salt, and fry slowly in sweet lard until 
tender, and a fine brown on both sides. Then put it on 
a dish where it will keep warm. Pour off the lard in 
the pan and any brown particles that may remain ; then 
add * pint of hot water and flour enough to make the 
gravy of the proper consistency. Have ready about 25 
large oysters, which remove from their liquor and put 
into the pan with the graw ; let them simmer until 
their gills begin to shrivel, observing to stir them all of 
the time. When done, pour them over the chicken and 
send to the table hot. 

Clileken Pie. 

Cut up the chickens by unjointing them; soak 
thoroughly in weak salt water ; wash thoroughly ; put 
3 chickens into a kettle with 2 quarts of water and 3 
teaspoonf uls of salt. Boil i an hour. Make a crust by 
rubbing i a pound of lard into quarts of flour. Take 
two teacupfuls of sour cream and teaspoonful and a 
half of soda; knead quite hail, and roll out half an 
inch thick. A 4-quart pudding dish will answer to 
bake in ; bring the edge of the crust a little above the 
rim of the dish : arrange the chicken by packing closely 
around the dish ; if you are fond of pepper, sprinkle 
some over each laver of chicken ; i a pound of butter, 
cut up in lumps and scattered among the meat, is a 
great improvement when the chicken is all in the dish ;

stir some flour into the gravy and turn over the chick- 
en*, then roll out the upper crust and put over the 
whole, jinching it closely vith th. under crust that 
comes over the rim prick le top crust for the steam 
to escape. Bake slowly for li hours and serve hot. It

unpainted tub, that will just hold the round, will be re- 
quired. Fill the hole from which the marrow bone w^as 
taken with marrow or nice fat. Bind into nice shape 
with strips of cotton and skewers. First rub with a 
tiiblespoonful of powdered saltpetre on both sides and 
in all crevices ; leave for 24 hours (it should be in a cool, 
dry place, that will not freeze). Then rub daily with 
some of the above mixture for 2 or 3 weeks, turning 
every 2 days and ladling its own liquor over it. When 
ready to cook the round, provide a tin dish that will 
just hold it. Place small pieces of hard wood to keep 
the meat from sticking to the tin underneath; also 
chopped vegetables, carrots, onions, celery-tops, and 
suet or drippings. Some of these should also be thickly 
strewed on the top. Cover all with a coarse paste 
rolled to keep moist and retain their flavor, and bake 6 
hours in a moderate oven. When done, take off the 
paste cover; remove the vegetables, etc., and put on 
the round heavy weights untu quite cold. Slice thinly.

Head Cheese. 

Aunt Fanny, Denver. 
Clean the legs nicely and boil by themselves, so that 
when done there will be plenty of the liquor. Boil the 
upper head, minus ears, eyes and nose, with consider- 
able lean meat, tenderloin is best, and when done re- 
move bones and skin from head and legs; chop the 
lean ; salt and pepper to suit the taste ; add the liquor 
the legs were boned in, and last, but not least, a tea- 
cupful of vinegar and a teacupful of catsup to every 
gallon. When thoroughly cold it can be cut out in 
slices. 

Pnddine Chop. 

Mrs. F B. P., Chicago. 
One pound salt pork, skin off the rind, chop fine with 
2 pounds of bread crumbs, moisten \vith water until

To Make Sausage. 
Mrs. J. T. S., Bloomington, Ills. 
For every 12 pounds of meat use 6 ounces of salt, 1 
ounce of black pepper, a tablespoonful of powdered 
saltpeter, half a teaspoonful of red pepner, and 4 ounces 
of sage. The sage and red pepper are not essential, 
and may be omitled by those who do not fancy them. 
These proportions should be tried on a small scale first, 
before seasoning the whole batch, to see whether it 
suits.

pressed with a heavy weight for a few hours, and then 
sliced down like * 'head-cheese" for tea, called "pressed

Two pounds veal, chopped fine ; 2 coffee-cups bread 
crumbs ; 2 eggs ; 1 even tablespoon of salt and pepper 
mixed; sage to taste, a little butter; bake about 1 
hour ; slice quite thin. The secret of having it slice off 
thin, without breaking, is pressing it down very firmly 
in the dish before baking. 

Baked Teal-nam. 

S. C, Dubuque, Iowa. 
Bone a breast of veal. Chop the meat very fine. 
Chop .111 equal quantity of cold boiled ham, and boil 6

Veal Collops. 

Mrs. A. M., Milwaukee. 
Cut part of a leg of veal into pieces 3 or 4 inches 
broad, sprinkle flour on them, fry in butter until brown, 
and then turn, in water enough to cover the veal. 
When it boils take off the scum, put in 2 or 3 onions, a 
blade of mace, a little salt and pepper, and stew until 
tender ; then take up the meat, thicken the gravy with 
flour and water mixed smoothly together, squeeze in 
the juice of a lemon — or a very good --'^bstitute is a

Mutton Dinner. 

Mrs. M. E. 3f., Evanston. 
Take 3 pounds of mutton, cut in small pieces (if you 
skin mutton it loses the strong flavor), put it on the 
stove in cold water ; when half done put in a teacup of 
rice. Pepper and salt to taste. Have water enough 
for soup. Make a nice biscuit crust, cut in diamonds, 
and 20 minutes before dinner drop them around on the 
top of the soup, and cover very closely ; or st-eam if you 
prefer This, with a dish of nice potato salad and an 
apple pie, makes a very good though not a stylish din- 
ner. 

Pork Tenderloin. 

Cut the tenderloin open ; stew in water till nearly 
done, then, with a little butter hissing in a spider, fry 
to a light brown— not too hard ; have a small piece of 
toast buttered for each piece of meat ; place the meat 
on the toast, pepper and salt, and then throw a thin 
milk gravy over all. We call it "quail on toast," and 
think it a very good substitute.

Make a crust of water and flour- roll half an inch

(air tight) closed, an inch-thick slice of salt pork cut in 
small pieces, a pound of veal, a piece of butter, some 
salt, 2 or 3 cloves, some whole pepper, one onion cut in 
quarters, and one carrot quartered lengthwise. Lay 
the roast in, pour over a spoonful of vinegar, close and 
set over the nre ; not too hot. In about 10 minutes add 
a cuj) of water, and turii the meat. In 15 another cup, 
and in 20 more another. Turn occasionally, but keep 
closed. Simmer slowly 4 hours. When done, carefully 
place upon a platter, putting a piece of carrot on each 
side, top and bottom. Turn all the grease out of the 
•kettle, pour 2 tablespoonfuls of water into the kettle, 
give another boil, and tmn over the meat.

Sympaihizer, Peoria, Ills. 

Into 2 quarts of flour put teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder ; sift, and add 1 teacupiul of lard, wet up with 
i pint of milk and f of a pmt of water ; knead bi^t 
little, roll out i of the dough i of an inch in thickness, 
and cut out the upper crust a little larger than the pan 
you bake in. . I use a pressed-tin milk-pan 12i inches 
m diameter and 3-} deep, and this quantity for crust is 
just enough). With the rest of the dough line the pan, 
pressing it well up around the edge; bake 10 or 15 
minut€s. -i hours before you make the crust, cut 3 or 
4 pounds of veal into pieces less than 2 inches in thick- 
ness ; those ith bone (if any) should first be placed in 
the kettle, then the others and cover with boiling 
water. As soon as the crust is the oven, season the 
veal, after removing the largest bones, with salt, pep- 
per, and butter size of an egg ; chicken with flour and 
milk, allowing gravy enough to coyer the meat. When 
the undercrust is done, fill it with all of the meat, and 
all the gravy it will hold without running over, while 
you add the top crust ; cut an opening in the center of 
this, and return to the oven for 15 or minutes, or 
until the upper crust is baked through ana browned 
slightly. Send to the table in the pan to be carved 
there. An earthen dish is nicer, but thev bake slower 
The rest of the gravy wiH be needed at the table.

Teal Cutlets. 

Mrs. Sarah L., Chicago. 
The way I cook cutlets and chops is to bake them. 
The great object is to have veal and mutton thoroughly 
cooked, and by baking you best accomplish that object. 
Take your dripping-pan, rub a little butter over each 
cutlet, salt and pepper, and lay flat in pans ; place in 
hot oven, and cover ^\ith another pan of same size. 
When done, if you like, make a sauce called butter 
maitre dliotel. Kub to a soft paste a small piece of 
butter with flour ; pour over i cup boiling hot water. 
It will then thicken ; then add a teaspoonful of lemon- 
juice; pour over cutlets and serve. It's good for 
dinner.

^ lie flat on the gridiron ; salt and pepper them, 
and broil to a nice brown ; have a pan of melted butter 
ready to dip each piece in as soon as cooked. Have 
ready slices of bread, toasted to a light brown, and well

pork, chopped fine and seasoned. Sew up birds, and 
put on to cook in cold water sufficient to cover them, 
adding a slice of pork to each bird. Season to taste. 
Cook till tender ; when done, place in a covered dish ; 
strain the gravy, add juice of a lemon, a tablespoonful 
currant jelly, and thicken with flour : boil up, and pour 
over birds.

To Cook Tenlson. 
Observer, Bock Springs, Wis. 

Boil till tender, with sufficient water to keep from 
burning ; when done put in some butter, pepper and 
salt • let it brown in the kettle , it retains all the flavor 
of the meat. That is the best way to cook roasts of 
beef ; you then have juicy, tender meat. 

Turkey Oravy.

Stewed Oysters. 

Mrs. John B. D., Chicago, 
^UT 1 quart of oysters into 3 quarts of boiling 
water, and pepper and salt to suit the taste. 
Leave the oysters in long enougli to become 
lieated through (as oysters should never be boiled). 
Then skim into the tureen. Now put in 1 pint of sweet 
cream, 12 crackers, and a good sized lump of butter, 
liquid. Let it come to a boil, and then pour into the 
tureen and send to the table. 

Mrs. G. S., Bock River Falls. 
To 1 can of oysters I allow 3 quarts of boiling water. 
I pour the boiling water over the oysters, and let tlie 
scum raise, and skim it off before seasoning. I tnen 
add i tea cup of sweet cream. Butter, salt and pepper 
to taste. O Jesters take a great deal of salt. Let come 
to boil as quick as possible, but do not boil. 

•Delmonico's Steivs. 

The following is the formula used at the celebrated 
rest<uu-ants of Delmonico in New Yor'.i:, wliere, it is 
said, the finest oyster stews in the world are obtainable: 

"Take 1 quart of liquid oysters, put the liquor (a tea- 
cupful for 3 persons) m a stew-pan, and add i as much 
more water ; salt, a good bit of pepper, a teaspoonful 
of butter for each person, and a teaspoonful of rolled 
cracker for each. Put on the stove and let it boil ; have 
the oysters ready in a bowl. The moment tlie liquor 
begins to boil pour in all the oysters, say 10 for each 
person. Now watch carefully, and as soon as it begins 
to boil, count just 30 seconds, and take the oysters 
from the stove. Have a big dish ready with H table- 
spoonfuls of cold mil k for each person. Pour the stew 
on this milk and serve immediately. Never boil an 
oyster if you wish it to be good."

Invalids' Oyster Soup. 

Mrs. S. C. H., Chicago. 
Procure the largest oysters ; remove 6 from the can, 
1 at a time, to a plate. Insert a fork into the solid 
flesh, and with a sharp knife make a slit up and down 
and across the abdommal cavity ; slip the point of the 
knife under the dark mass thus exposed and thorough- 
ly remove it, being as nice about it as you would in 
dressing any other fish, for the abdominal foulness of 
one is as unsuited to the stomach as the other. Put 
into stew-pan ; pour out proper share of liquor, a pint 
of water and i gill of cream ; add salt ; pepper, if there 
be no fever ; a teaspoonf ul of lemon juice, or 2 of pure 
cider vinegar. Bring just to tlie boil and pour into a 
dish. Break in cracKer or nicely toasted thin slice of 
light bread. A little fresh butter makes it richer. 

Escolloped Oysters. 

Ii'oline, SaZtwttor«rMrf.— ^ 
To 2 quarts of fine oysters, 12 fresh crackers powder- 
ed fine, 1 cupful of oyster juice, 1 cupful of milk, a 
piece of butter the size of an egg, a little pepper and 
salt. Place alternate layera of oysters and crackers in 
a deep earthen dish, seasoning each layer of oysters 
with pepper and salt ; when the dish is full, put the 
butter on top of the cracker crumbs, and pour the 
oyster juice and milk over all \ set in a moderate oven 
and bake 50 minutes. 

Jessie, Joliet, lU. 

First, lift your oysters from the liquor ; then put in a 
deep dish, alternate layers Ox rolled crackers and oysters, 
putting on each layer of oysters a little salt, pepper, 
and a little butter. Be sure and have your first and last 
layer consist of crackers. After you have the desired 
quantity in your dish, pour a sufficient amount of the 
liquor over the top to thoroughly moisten the crackers ; 
put into a moderate oven and bake about 20 minutes.

the liquor up ; cover with a top crust — no bottom ; 
bake quick, and serve hot^ Cold sliced meats prepared 
the same way are verj* good. 

£scollopeil Oysters. 

Sfdrley Dare, Bryan, Ohio. 
Crush the desired quantity of crackers ; put a layer 
in the bottom of a buttered dish -, wet this with a mix- 
ture of the oyster-liquor and milk slightly warm ; next 
a layer of oysters ; sprinkle them with salt and pepper, 
and lay bits of butter upon them ; then another layer 
of moistened crumbs, and so on. Let the top layer be 
of crumbs thicker than the rest, and beat an egg in the 
milk poured over them. Stick bits of butter thickly 
over it ; cover the dish, and bake 40 minutes ; remove 
the cover and brown by setting it on the upper grate of 
the oven for a few minutes. 

Cream Oysters, On the Half- Shell. 

Pour into a pan 1 cup of hot water, 1 cup milk, and 1 
of cream (or 3 cupfuls of milk). 8et it in a kettle of 
hot waier until it boils ; stir in 2 tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter, and pepper and salt to suit ; take from the tire and 
stir in 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of corn-starch, wet up 
in cold milk. Have the shells cleaned and buttered 
and laid in a baking-pan ; place an oyster in each shell ; 
stir the cream hard and till carefully ; bake 5 or 6 min- 
utes after the shells are warm. If shells are not easily 
obtained, patty-pans or small sauce-dishes answer 
every purpose. Berve in the shell or dishes. 

Fried Oysters. 

Dip each oyster in beaten egg ; then in rolled cracker 
or corn-meal, and fry quickly in hot butter.

delicate brown ; remove, and cut in pieces ; then in the 
pork fat fry 3 or 4 good-sized onions sliced thin ; have 
ready 12 potatoes, pared and sliced, also 4 or 5 cakes of 
hard bread; put the hard bread to soak (whole) in 
some cold water; then take the soup-kettle and put 
first a laver of pork, then of onions, next of potatoes, 
and finally of clams or fish, as the case may be, and so 
on alternately, seasoning highly with pepper and salt ; 
and lastly, putting a layer of the soaked hard bread on 
top ; first cover with water and boil 20 minutes. 

Octavia, Amboy, lU. 
For a can of clams, pare and cut in thin slices pota- 
toes to nearly fill a quart measure ; put 3 or 4 thin 
slices of nice salt pork in the kettle in which the 
chowder is to be cooked ; when the pork is about half 
fried, put a layer of the sliced potatoes over the pork, 
then a layer of clams, then a layer of Boston crackers 
which have been split open ana slightly buttered and 
dipped quickly in cold water ; then potatoes, clams, 
and. crackers again, until all is in the kettle. Kow 
sprinkle over a little salt and pepper, and afterwards 
pour on milk, or, if milk is not plenty, milk and water, 
to just cover the whole. Let boil very gently, closely 
covered, without stirring, for about half an hour, or 
until the potatoes are done. Then remove carefully 
to a tureen for the table. The pork prevents the mass 
from sticking to the kettle, and helps to season the 
chowder. Fresh fish chowder made in this way, with 
milk, is delicious. 

Myrtle, Chicago. 
Clam or fish : 1 quart water ; 2 slices pork ; 2 ordin- 
ary-sized onions, sliced thin. Boil 20 minutes ; add 6 
quartered potatoes ; 1 pound halibut laid on the top ; 
put in butter, pepper and salt to taste— the higher 
seasoned the better ; thicken with a little flour ; st«w 
i an hour. Just before taking up put in a pint of oys- 
ter crackers, and you have a genuine chowder, a la 
seaside.

Mai-y, Chicago^ 
Boil a chicken, seasoned in cooking, until it parts 
readily from the bone ; pour off the liquor. When the 
fowl is cold, pick it from the bones and chop fine in a 
wooden bowl. Use the same quantity of celery or 
cabbage cut with a knife and the chopped whites of 2 
hard-boiled eggs. Mix, and put away until with- 
in an hour or using, when the following previously- 
prepared dressing must be mixed with it: Beat the

onions, sliced very thin ; salt and pepper each layer ; 
heat a piece of butter the size of a walnut in sufficient 
vinegar to cover the salad, and pour over it while hot. 

Cabbage Salad. 

Mrs. Gen. W., Chicago. 
Take 1 head of nice cabbage and chop very fine with 
salt, after which set it away for a few days. Then 
drain off all the water, and add 1 tablespoon of mus- 
tard seed, and enough vinegar to cover, and boil it i

AVO cups cold mashed potatoes ; bits of some 
kind of cold meat hashed ; 2 tablespoons melted 
JJI butter ; 2 well-beaten eggs ; 1 cup milk ; pour 
into a deep dish and bake in a quick oven ; if

pinch together ; fry brown in butter. 

Potatoes a la Crenie. 

Mrs. E.D. G,H., Grand Rapids, Mich. 
Put into a saucepan 2 ounces butter, a dessertspoon- 
ful of flour, some parseley and scallions (both chopped 
small), salt and pepper. Stir them together ; add a 
wineglass of cream, and set on the stove, stirring con-

palatable way of cooking potatoes, especially in the 
spring.

Fancy Mashed Potatoes. 

Mrs. H. Frank B., Chicago. 
Peel 2 quarts potatoes, and when they are cooked, 
turn off every drop of water, put in a little salt, pep- 
per and butter ; then take a carving-fork and break 
them up a little ; next add a little more butter, say, in 
the whole, a piece as large as an egg, and nearly a cup 
of nice milk or cream. Now take a silver tork, or 
3-pronged one, and beat them briskly 5 mmutes, or 
until light and creamy. They must be carried imme- 
diately to the table, or they will become heavy and 
clannny. If once tried this way you will never again 
resort to the old '' masher." Remember, they must 
be served immediately. 

To Boil. 

Marian Warren, ChiMigo. 

In boiling potatoes, when they are not previously 
pared, always have a ring of the skin a i ot an inch 
peeled from end to end. This is not a ^'notion," but 
the escape of the water, and consequently the meali- 
ness of the potato, is very much promoted by it. It 
does no harm to cut large potatoes in Iialves or quar- 
ters before boiling. 

Fried Potatoes. 
• Mrs. D. S. F., Rockfwd. 

Peel, then slice rather thin into cold water. If very 
thin, they may be too crisp, l.et them stand in the 
water a short time, and then drain through a colander ; 
have ready on the stove a kettle of hot lard, as for 
fried cakes ; put in part of the potatoes and cover the 
kettle ; stir them occasionally ; when done they should 
be a delicate brown; skim out into any dish, and 
sprinkle a little salt over them. When the second 
batch of potatoes is partly cooked, let me advise you 
to ring vour bell, as they will be cooked by the time 
the tiist^lot is disposed of, and are much better hot. 
Boiled- Baked Sweet Potatoes. 
Nannie C, Lake View. 

Boil your potatoes until tender ; then slice several 
times the long way of tlie potato ; place a layer of the 
slices on the bottom of an* earthen dish ; sprinkle 



COOKERY— VEGETABLES. 41 

lightly with white sugar, and heavily with lumps of 
butter (it is the butter that makes it nice) ; then an- 
other layer of potatoes, and so on, until you have the 
sugar and butter for a top layer ; then bake 30 or 40 
minutes. 

Egg Plant. 
Mrs. Enos, EvansviUe, Ind. 
To cook egg-plant, slice the plant i inch thick ; 
sprinkle with salt ; place layer upon layer, and let 
stand 15 minutes ; dip in a batter and fry in butter 
and lard. Another good way is to dip in egg and roll 
in crushed cracker and fry same way. 

Corn Oysters. 

M. H., Chicago. 
Six ears of sweet corn (those which are not too old) • 
with a sharp knife split each row of the corn in the 
center of the kernel lengthwise ; scrape out all the 
pulp ; add 1 egg, well beaten, a little salt, 1 table- 
spoonful of sweet milk ; flour enough to make a pretty 
stiff batter ; drop in hot lard, and fry a delicate brown. 
If the corn is quite young, omit the milk, using as 
little flour as possible. • 

Asparagus. 

Mrs. Sarah i., Chicago. 
Scrape. Put in water and salt, and at first boil ; 
drop in the asparagus ; boil till tender. Sauce : 1 yolk 
of egg mixed with a teaspoonful of water ; a piece of 
butter added, and when hot, stir in 2 tablespoonfuls 
of milk ; pour over the drained asparagus. 

Baked Beans. 

Mrs. E., Kalamazoo. 
Take as many beans as you think you want ; wash, 
boil till tender, and add salt, pepper, and molasses to 
taste. If you like them greasy, put in '' right smart " 
of pork ; a small piece will answer. Bake in covered 
dish of any sort. 

Boston Baked Beans. 

Mrs. H. V. R., Chicago. 
Wash ; then par-boil i an hour ; then bake all day or 
night. As to the seasoning, it is much a matter of

taste. Some like them with a good deal of fat, and 
into a pot that woTild hold a quart of beans, would put 
i a pound of pork (salt), cutting through the rind as if 
to slice, then laying it at the top, so that the rind may 
become nicely brown. Then some add a tablespoon- 
ful of molasses. We do not believe much in pork, so 
only put in a very thin slice of it, adding a little salt 
and omitting the sweetening. 

D. &'., Belvidere, lU. 

Take 1 pint of beans and let them soak over night 
in a quart of cold water ; in the morning pour the 
water off, and let them stand about an hour in fresh 
water on top of the stove, and then remove to a regu- 
lar '' Boston bean-pot,'' not a common yellow dish, as 
half of the western people do, and lay i a pound of 
salt pork (not too fat) across the top of them and 2 
tablespoonfuls of New Orleans molasses, and cover all 
with water, and put in the oven, and let them bake 
until the middle of the afternoon, during the day 
adding water as it cooks away ; and for Sunday morn- 
ing's breakfast set the bean-pot in the oven again 
(with your beans undisturbed from the night before), 
and add a cup of hot water, and let them remain about 
an hour, and vou will tind them delicious. Serve with 
a loaf of brown bread, and you can imagine yourself 
eating a Boston breakfast. I make a sweet sauce 
from ripe tomatoes, which eaten upon beans, gives 
them a great relish. I advise those who never tried 
it, for meats or beans, to immediately make a large 
jar full for winter. 

Baked Beaii<9. 
Mrs. H. Frank B., Chicago. 

For a family of 4 or 5, take 1 quart of beans, the 
smaller the better, and soak them 10 or 12 hours ; then 
put in 1 pound of salt pork, not too lean ; put them in 
a deep jar or '' crock," and sink the pork in the beans 
all but the rind, which must be scored, or gashed, 
about * an inch apart ; cover the whole with the water 
the beans were soaked in ; if not enough, add more 
cold water, a little salt and pepper, and bake 10 or 12 
hours. I put mine in the oven at 6 p. m., and cook 
them all night with a slow fire. Some put in a table-

spoonful of molasses. This will make 2 good meals, 
and the more they are warmed over the better they 
are. 

Fried Tomatoes. 

Take large green tomatoes ; cut off both ends, and 
then cut up 1 in 3 slices. Have some butter in the 
frying-pan ; let it get hot ; then roll the tomatoes in 
flour and lay them in the pan ; salt, pepper, and 
sprinkle a little sugar on while frying ; cook till they 
are done nice and brown, and you will have a most 
delicious article for breakfast. 

EgS Plant. 

Mrs. T. G. E., Chicago. 
Cut slices i an inch thick, and pare, when first 
starting breakfast. Rub salt lightly over the top of 
each slice and let stand in a pile till the brine starts ; 
then shake off the salt and dip each slice, both sides, 
into flour well , stand in a pile till the flour is moist, 
then fry in a little lard in the frying-pan, like one 
would griddle-cakes. When brown, take up and spread 
a little butter on top of each slice. 

Cooking Egs Plant. 

Mrs. C. O.S., Chicago. 

To cook egg plant — Slice and leave in salt water a 
short time before using ; dip in beaten egg ; after, in 
corn-meal or cracker crumbs ; fry brown in butter and 
lard. 

To Cook r y Peas. 
Kit, Crtlc, 2seb. 

Choose the green, wrinkled peas; soak a pint of 
them over night ; set them on the stove early in the 
morning with cold water enough to cover them well ; 
simmer very gently, adding cold water as they evapo- 
rate. Do not let them boil, and they will come to the 
table whole and sound. Do not salt until they are 
done, and they will be as tender as June peas. A little 
butter is all the dressing they will need.

Boil till tender 6 large onions. Afterwards sepa- 
rate them with a large spoon ; then place a layer of 
onions and a layer of grated bread crumbs alternately 
in a pudding dish. Season with pepper and salt to 
taste ; moisten with milk ; put in the oven to brown. 
Cracked l-Vheat. 
Smail Housekeeper, at Home. 

Stir 5 large heaping spoonfuls of the crushed white 
wheat sold by grocers into a quart of boiling water, 
and set the tin pail holding it into a pan of boiling 
water to cook 20 minutes. This prevents its burning, 
and is a cheap and easy substitute for a farina kettle. 
Salt well, and when the kernels have swelled and burst 
like popcorn it is done. Serve it plain to eat with 
meat and gravy like rice, or add i a teaspoonful of 
cinnamon, a pinch of ground cloves, a handful ot 
raisins or currants, and a i cup of sugar while boiling, 
and you have a savory breakfast dish. Sometimes we 
serve it plain in saucers, with a dust of cinnamon on 
the top, and sugar and butter or cream, as German 
pancake is eaten.

EGGS. 

BoiUns I^Sgrs. 

Jennie Lee, Chicago. 

^UT the eggs in some vessel which can be closely 
covered, and when the tea-kettle boils pour in 
water enough to cover them, close the vessel 
and place it on tlie back part of the stove, and 
let it remain 10 minutes. If you wish to be very exact, 
use a thermometer and keep the water 10 minutes at 
exactly the heat which is indicated after the water is 
poured in. 

Bv the ordinary method of letting the eggs boil from 
2 to '^ minutes the white part is hardened and the yolk 
left uncooked, or if the yolk is cooked the white is too 
hard. By this method the heat penetrates so gradu- 
ally that the yolk is nicelv cooked, while the white is 
soft and tender and only just done enough to be 
opaque. 

« Poached Egg^s. 

Mrs. W. S. £>., Lowell. 
Place a frying-pan of salted boiling water on the 
fire filled with as many small muffin-rings as it will 
hold ; break the eggs singly in a cup and pour into the 
rings; boil them 2i or 3 minutes; remove the rings 
and take up the eggs singly in a strainer; serve oni 
slices of nicely browned and buttered toast; put a 
small piece of butter on each egg; pepper slightly, 
and garnish with sprigs of parseley. Serve hot. 

Omelet. 

Gypsy, Ionia, Mich. 
Take six eg^s and beat separately ; allow one table- 
spoonful of milk to each egg ; stir in flour to make a 
batter ; take a cupful of milk, put on the stove, and 
stir in the batter until it is like starch ; add a piece of 
butter the size of a walnut and a pinch of salt ; take

this from the stove ; pour into the dish in which you 
would serve ; then stir in the yolks of the eggs, which 
have been beaten ; beat the whites until you can turn 
the platter bottom side up; then add them, mixing 
thoroughly ; put in a quick oven and bake 10 minutes. 
Should be eaten immediately. 

Annie M. Hale^ M. D., Chicago. 

Break 6 eggs into a bowl. Skim out the yolks into a 
large coffee-cup. Beat the whites to a stiff froth. 
Now beat the yolks enough to make them smooth, fill 
up the cup with milk and pour this into the bowl con- 
taining the whites of the eggs. Put in a little salt and 
stir enough to mix the whole— that is, as little as pos- 
sible. Have the spider warmed and a piece of but- 
ter as large as an egg already melted therein. Now 
pour in your eggs and milk, let it cook slowly ; be sure 
and not burn. If there is danger of this lift it up from 
the bottom with a knife. When the froth sets on the 
top it is done. Put a large plate over the spider and 
deftly turn the whole upside down. Lift off the 
spider and you will have an elegant and delicious 
omelet. 

JaneB., Waiikegan. 

Take 1 egg for each person, beat 2 minutes, add 
salt the size of a pea and 1 tablespoonf ul o4 milk for 
each egg ; beat 1 minute and turn into a hot, well-but- 
tered frying-pan ; cover it and cook slowly till nearly 
as thick ; raise the edges and put under a little butter 
or lard to prevent sticking, and turn 1 half over on 
the other half, and serve immediately. 

French t^ge». 

Boxey, No. 2, Chicago. 
Boil hard, remove the shells, and roll in cracker 
crumbs ; fry in butter until brown. Make a gravy of 
butter, crumbs and cream, and pour over them. 

Piclcled Egff!^. 

Algebra, Chicago. 
Select nine fresh ones, boil them hard, lift them di- 
rectly from the hot water into cold. When cool, re- 
move the shell, stick cloves into them, and drop in 
cold vinegar. 



COOKERY— EGGS. " 49 

Agnes, Chicago. 
Put the eggs on the stove in cold water, let stand 
and boil for 1 hour— the heart is then mealy ; remove 
the shells, stick 4 or 5 cloves in each egg, pour hot 
vinegar over (add other spices if you like) ; let stand a 
few days ; they are very nice. 

To Keep EffS^. 

Mrs. C. G. S., Rock River Valley. 
Pour one gallon of boiling water on one quart of 
quicklime. When cold, add one ounce cream tartar. 
The eggs must be covered with the pickle. 

Fancier, Chicago. 

Take any tight package and place a layer of fine salt 
over the bottom; into this set the eggs, large end 
down, as closely as possible without touching each 
other ; fill with salt until the layer is covered, and then 
proceed as before. Care must be taken that the salt 
is dry, and that it be kept so, else it will cake and 
make it very troublesome to get the eggs out without 
breaking. 

French Toast. 
Belle, Chicago. 

For dessert : f of a pint of milk ; 1 eg^, well beaten ; 
a little salt. Take 6 slices of bread ; dip into the cus- 
tard (uncooked) 1 by 1 ; then fry in a little butter till a 
delicate brown. For sauce, melted sugar with a little 
cinnamon added. This is very nice, and is a good way 
to use up stale bread. 

p. p. C, Chicago. 

Beat 3 or 4 e^gs ; season with salt and pepper ; have 
ready some thin slices of bread; dip them into the 
eggs, and fry them in lard (or after frying ham) until 
ot a light brown. 

Another method of cooking eggs and bread together 
is to crumb the bread some, as for dressing ; mix it 
with 3 or 4 beaten eggs; season, and fry until 
thoroughly done ; or mold with the hands into cakes, 
and fry until of a light brown. Either of the above 
dishes form a pleasant addition to the morning's re- 
past. 



60 COOKERY— COFFEE. 



COFFEE. 



A Woman^ New Boston, lU, 
^HfiAKE the best green coffee, roast to a dark- 
m hrovm, beat the white of 1 egg (so it won't hang 
W together much), stir it through the coffee while 
•f^ hot. When sufficiently browned, put away in a 
close can while hot. Grind when you want to make 
your coffee enough for a tablespoon heaping full to 
each person; add as many cups cold water as you 
think your family Avill drink ; put in a liot place ; let 
it just come to a boil ; nut it back w^here it will keep 
hot till your meal is ready ; then put it off the stove 2 
or 3 minutes before pouring out. If not strong 
enough, put in more coffee next time. ' 
Mrs. F. C. E., Burlington, Iowa. 
A recipe for making coffee which has been used in 
my family for 75 years : Buy the green berry ; brown 
and grmd it at home ; grind as fine as mill will grind 
it. Buy a French biggin— dimensions of top portion 
to make coffee for 1 person— If inches in diameter, 5 
inches high ; for 2 or 3 persons, 2i inches diameter, 4 
to 5 inches high. Quantity of unground coffee tor 1 
person, contents of a tin cup If inches in diameter, li 
inches deep ; for two persons, If inches m diameter, 2 
inches deep. Put the coffee into the top of the pot, 
with nothing between it and the perforated bottom ; 
press it tight ; put in the strainer. (This is to prevent 
the water from striking the coffee in a body, thus 
boring a hole in it, and running through without 
extracting its strength). Pour in boiling water i ot 
a pint at a time, allowing i of a pint for each person, 
and i of a pint for absorption. (Where there are 
more than 3 persons, allow more for absorption; 
where fewer, less). While water is running through, 
the bottom pot or receiver should stand m hot wa^r. 
(This prevents boiling or getting cold). This coffee 



COOKERY — COFFEE. 51 

should always be used with hot milk— proportion, 1 
part coffee, 3 parts milk. 

LUlie TT., Englewood, lUs. 
Take 2 or more egg-shells, crush them with the requi- 
site amount of ground Java, add i a cup of cold water, 
beat it well together, pour on boiling water, and allow 
it to boil up once. Always wash eggs before breaking 
them, and save the shells for coffee, which will be, 
when so treated, as clear as when the white of an egg 
is used. 

Aunt SaUy, Springfield, O. 

Take a piece of Shaker flannel, and make a bag that 
will fit in your coffee-pot, only make it about an inch 
shorter. Hem in a piece of wu-e or hoop-skirt steel, 
just below the hem at the top (something to hold the 
bag up), and put a loop on. Hang this bag in the 
coffee-pot, and put the coffee in the bag, pour in the 
boiling water, a pint to a heaping tablespoonful of 
coffee, and boil. You ^vill have nice clear coffee, with- 
out using eggs or anything else to clear it. 

Mrs. Lillian D. Bollam, CJiicago. 
Koast to a brown color (don't hum to a black) genuine 
Mocha or old Government Java; grind while yet 
warm; place the quantity required for breakfast, 
loose (not packed), m a thin muslin sack; drop this 
sack to the bottom of the coffee-pot ; fill the pot with 
cold water; place it on the stove until it gradually 
reaches the boiling heat, but dmi't let it boil for an in- 
stant ; keep the pot on the stove 10 minutes longer, and 
the strength will be drawn from the ground coffee. 
Pour the coffee into warm cups directly from the pot. 
Add warm cream or hot milk, and sugar, and you will 
have an exquisite draught, all things having been 
properly conducted, equal to the fabled nectar we read 
of in mythology. Roast coffee every morning— use as 
soon as roasted. 

D. D. Chicago. 
One-half egg to 1 cup ground coffee; stir well in a bowl, 
so that every ground is covered; then place in the 
coffee-pot and pour on cold water — shaking constantly 
till the lump of egg and coffee settles to a smooth mass. 
Add your boiling water. 



52 COOKERY — COFFEE. 

Mrs. Evergreen City, Bloomington. 
For each person allow 1 tablespoonful of coffee; 
pour on boiling water sufficient for use ; boil from '6 to 
5 minutes, after which pour out i a cupful and replace 
it in the pot, allowing it to stand about a minute— this 
settles the coffee nicely— when it is ready to serve. 
Buelah, Ottawa, lU. 
Boil a dessert-spoonful of ground coffee in a pint of 
milk for a i of an hour ; then clear it with white of egg 
or isinglass : let it boil for a few minutes, and set it by 
the side of the fire to fine. Sweeten according to taste. 
This is a suitable breakfast for those of spare habit 
and disposed to affections of the lungs. 
Queechy, DesPlaines, lUs. 
You can make coffee perfectly clear by putting in a 
small piece of codfish-skin, about 5 minutes before it is 
taken from the stove. A piece an inch square will be 
sufficient for a good sized family. The outside should 
be scraped, then rinse it and di'op it in. 
Mrs. Nellie Townsend, Chicago. 
In the first place get the green coffee, roast it, take 
the quantity required, put in coffee-pot, pour boiling 
water on it ; have a pot of boiling water, set in this the 
coffee-pot, with a small piece of wood for the coffee-pot 
to rest on, so it will not touch the bottom of the pot ; 
let it boil a half-hour, or, for that matter, it might boil 
all day, and be all the better for it. Your coffee will 
be as clear as crystal. You will need no egg, and will 
also find you will not require as much coffee as boiling. 
This way does not boil but steeps it. Be careful to use 
boiling water for both. 

B. Frank, Peoria. 
Get the best of green coffee, and brown nicely, but 
be sure and not burn it ; and while it is coolhig, take 
the whites of 3 eggs and beat them until they are 
slightlv frothy, and while the coffee is warm pour them 
over and stir well together, and when well mixed, if it 
should not be dry, set the pan under the stove to dry. 
Grind a cupful of the coffee, and to every person put a 
heaping tablespoonful of the coffee in a coffee-pot. 
Then pour a cup of cold water over it and shake well; 



COOKERY— BREAD. 53 

set it on the stove ; let it come to a boil, and put in as 
many cups of boiling water as you have spoonfuls 
of coffee; stir down the grounds from the sides of 
the coffee-pot ; pour in a little cold water ; let it stand 
a little while and it is ready to serve.

spoonsful of sugar; i cup yeast; a little salt. Mix 
thoroughly with 1 pint of scalded milk when it is 
almost cold. This will seem hard, but when raised 
will mold easily. Mix at night and mold in the morn- 
ing. Cut out and let them stand until raised again ; 
then bake. 

Bakinsc-PoTrder Biscuit. 
Mm. O. H. H., Chicago. 
One important point is in having a hot oven ; another 
is, have Hour sifted, and roll dough as soft as you can 
handle ; then more baking-powder is needed. For 
each teacup of flour take a teaspoon of powder ; butter, 
the size of a small hen's egg, is sufficient for a quart of 
flour. After rubbing butter and powder into the 
amount of flour needed, I turn in cold water (milk will 
do), stirring all of the time, till the right consistency is 
readied ; salt ; then roll lightly, and bake at once. I 
warrant these will prove flakey, feathery, delicious, and 
more nutritious than biscuit raised with yeast. 

Mrs. G. ClinUm Smith, Springfield, lUs. 

Use 3 heaping teaspoons baking powder. Rub this 
with your hands — not a spoon — into a quart of flour 
thorougiily. Then rub in a heaping tablespoonful of 
butter or lard in the same manner you did the baking- 
powder until well mixed. After adding a teaspoon of 
salt, if lard is used, add milk or water sufficient to 
make a soft dough. Roll and cut out quickly, placing 
them at once in a very hot oven. This latter is import- 
ant. Unless the oven is very hot they will not be a 
success. 

Quick Biscuits. 
Mrs. EmUy, Eau Claire, Wis. 

Mix a quart of sweet milk with i a cup melted but- 
ter; stir in a pinch of salt, 2 teaspoonfuls baking- 
powder, and flour enough for a stiff batter. Have the

of salt. Take enough white flour to use up the water, 
making it the consistency of batter cakes. Add the 
rest of the ingredients, and as much Graham flour as 
can be stirred in with a spoon. Set it away till morn- 
ing. In the morning grease pan, Horn* hands. Take^a 
lump dough the size ot a large eg§ ; roll lightly between 
the palms. Let them rise 20 minutes, and bake in a 
tolerably hot oven. 

Rusks. 
Mn. W. F., Tuscola^ lUs. 

Take enough of light dough and work in a teacup of 
sugar and nearly as much shortening, mould out same 
as for light biscuit. Or, take a teacupf ul of yeast, i a 
cup of lard or butter, a little soda ; knead together, and 
when it rises mold out, and raise again before baking. 
May Ely, Rochester, 

Kusks require a longer time for rising than ordinary 
rolls or biscuits. If wished for tea one evening, begin 
them the day before. In cold weather, to make up iH 
quarts of flour, mix into a paste with one pint of boil- 
ing water, 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar, 3 of flour, and 2 
large Irish potatoes, boiled and mashed smooth. In the 
evening make up dough with this sponge, adding 8 well 
beaten eggs, f of a pound sugar, and i a pint fresh 
milk. Set it away in a covered vessel, leavnig plenty 
of room for it to swell. Next morning work mto the 
risen dough, which should not be stiff, a i pound of 
butter and lard mixed. Make into rolls or biscuits, 
and let the dough rise for the second time. Flavor with 
2 grated nutmegs or i an ounce of pounded stick cin- 
namon. When very light, bake in a quick, steady oven 
till of a pretty bro^vn color ; glaze with the yolk of an 
egg, and sprinkle lightly with powdered white sugar.

heat to decrease. This makes the pans twice full ; bake 
20 minutes. We have to vary the flour a little at every 
fresh bagful, or it does not swell alike. 

Aunt Emma, Chicago. 
To 1 quart of Graham flour add i pint fine white 
flour, and enough milk or water, a little warm, to make 
a thick batter ; no salt or baking powder. Have yoiu* 
oven hotter than for biscuit, and your gem-pans stand- 
mg in the oven till you get ready. Beat batter thor- 
oughly, grease your pans, and drop hi while the irons 
are smoking hot. Bake quickly a nice brown.

Make a thin paste with 8 ounces of flour, 6 ounces of 
pulverized sugar, 2 eggs, a few drops of essence to 
flavor, i a liquor-glass of brandy or rum, and milk. 
Warm and butter ooth sides of the mold, put some of 
the paste into it ; close it gently, set it on the fire, turn 
it over to heat both sides equally, dust them with 
sugar when done, and serve either warm or cold. It 
takes hardly a minute for,each with a good fire.

ping the spoon into the hot lard to prevent the dough 
sticking to the spoon. 

Oraliain or Rye Mush. 

Mrs. B. J. G., Onslow, Iowa.

Soak the oatmeal over night in enough water to wet 
it, in the morning stir into boiling water. Cook a few 
minutes. 




62 COOKEKY— BREAD. 

Mr». S. M. B., Chicago. 
Three cups of meal will make a generous dish for a 
party of 4 or 5 persons. When it has cooked about 2 
hours in a double boiler, salt it thoroughly, and at the 
end of three hours it should be found very stiff and dry 
as possible, turned out to cool and mold ; cut in slices 
thin as can be handled without breaking, fry in butter 
and lard, equal parts, or f butter. The rich brown of 
these crisp bits will prove tempting to the veriest 
epicure. 

Whole Wheat. 

Either boil it slowly until quite soft, or bake 6 or 8 
hours, the same as beans, omitting ttie pork ; or as a 
pudding, with milk sufficient to allow it to swell, or 
about 2 quarts of milk to a pint of wheat. Sweeten to 
taste, and add a few drops of vanilla or lemon fla- 
voring, if desired.

water to a thick batter. When this is cool, add i of a 
bowl of light sponge— taken from bread-sponge pre- 
pared with potatoes that has raised over night— i tea- 
cup of sugar, 8 teaspoons of soda and salt. This stir as 
stiff with rye flour as can be stirred witli a spoon. Let 
this raise very li^ht, and then add as much rye again as 
can be worked m with the hands without kneading 
Drop in a buttered pan, and bake slowly for li hours.

Oraliam Bread. 

Blanche, Chicago. 
One pint yeast, same as used for white bread ; stir in 
a pint of warm water and a little salt, then add Graham 
tlour until you have a thick batter. Bake 15 minutes 
longer than the same size loaf of white bread. It will 
not rise as much as other bread. 

Mvs B. J. G., Onslow, Iowa. 
Graham 3 quarts, 2 quarts warm water, i pint yeast, 
1 teaspoonf ul soda, i pint sugar. Mix with a spoon.

place till quite light. Bake with a steady, moderate 
heat two hours. This recipe makes 3 good loaves. 

Mrs. E. E., Wisconsin. 
Take the "sponge" of white bread when light, enough 
for 1 loaf or 2, as you wish, and mix in enough Graham 
flour to make a moderately stiff loaf ; place in a pan, 
and, when light, bake. You can add a little sugar or 
molasses if you like. Can also make very nice rye 
bread in the same way.

Mrs. W. B. B., Kalamazoo^ Mich. 
Take 2 ounces of oatmeal and U pints of water. Rub 
the meal in a basin with the back of a spoon, in a small 
quantity of water, pouring off the fluid after the 
coarser particles are settled, but while the milkiness 
continues, repeat the operation until the milkiness dis- 
appears. Xext put the washings into a pan, stir until 
they boil, and a soft, thick mucilage is formed. 
Sweeten to taste. 

Milk S^ponse Bread. 

Adelaide, Negaunee.

64 COOKERY— BREAD. 

spoonful of sugar, J teaspoonful salt, and the same of 
soda ; let it stand till you can bear your linger in it ; 
then add flour to make a thick batter ; beat it hard for 
2 minutes. Xow place the pitcher in a kettle of hot s, 
water— not hot enough to scald the mixture ; keep the 
wat€r at the same temperature till the emptyings are 
light. If set early in the morning they will be ready, if 
watched carefully, at 11 o'clock to make a sponge, the 
same as for other bread, with a quart of very warm 
milk. Let this sponge get very light ; then make into 
loaves and set to rise again, taking care they do not get 
too light this time before putting in the oven, or the 
bread will be diy and tasteless. 

Yeast Bread. 

B. C. F., Chicago. 
At about 4 o'clock in the afternoon take 3 quarts of 
good flour and H quarts lukewarm water — or milk will 
make whiter bread— and a little salt. Place a cake of 
strictly fresh yeast in a small dish of the water. Stir 
your flour ancl water into a thick batter, mixing in the 
yeast as soon as it is soft, leaving dry flom' around the 
edge to keep it warm. Then cover and set away in a 
warm place in the summer, or by the stove in the win- 
ter, imtil it begins to rise nicely— say 9 or 10 o'clock in 
the evening. Then mix thick, and knead about half as 
much as to bake. Then cover and set away again until 
morning. By 6 o'clock you wiU And your disli more 
than full, unless it is large. Then knead well and put 
in baking-tins, and set by tlie stove to rise. When 
light enough put in the oven and keep it evenly heated 
until done. This Avill make 3 good loaves.

spoonfuls of it 111 a coffee-cup ; add 1 teaspoon of sugar ; 
1 saltspoon of salt ; -} saltspoon of soda , mix thoroughly; 
pour boiling water in the mixture, stirring it well to- 
gether until it will nearly till the cup; remove the 
spoon ; cover tlie cup of clough ; set it where it will 
keep warm, not scald. Set it Friday morning, and it 
will be light for Saturday's baking. If in a hurry, set 
in a dish of warm water. Now put in bread-pan flour 



COOKERY— BREAD. 65 

enough for bread; add salt; take 1 quart of boiling 
water for three loaves, and turn into the middle of 
your flour, stirring in slowly ; put enough cold water 
(or milk) to cool sufficiently to bear your finger in it ; 
then add middlings— stir in well ; cover with some of 
the flour, and set in a warm place. When light enough, 
mix soft into loaves; grease bread-pans; also top of 
the loaves, which makes a tender upper crust: cut 
gashes quite deep across the loaves, and it will rise 
evenly ; set near the stove, and when light enough, 
bake f of an hour. 

B. C. F., Chicago. 
Take i teaspoonful salt, 1 tablespoonful sugar, 1 

Eint lukewarm water, and flour enough to make a good 
atter. Cover closely and set the receptacle in a jar of 
warm water and cover that also. Let it remain until 
it rises, then use as any other rising. Flour mixed up 
with milk will make whiter bread than when mixed 
with water. 

Housekeeper 40 years, Virginia, Ills. 
In early morning take a teacupf ul of new milk ; pour 
boiling water in until it is blood warm ; put in a small 
(juarter teaspoon of salt ; the same of sugar ; then stir 
in 1 large tablespoonful of Graham flour, or corn-meal, 
and 2 tablespoonf uls of fine flour, or until it is as thick 
as pancake oatter : mix it all in a quart cup, and set it 
to rise. Keep it or an equal heat by setting the cup in 
warm water ; if water gathers on top dust a little flour 
and stir ; it will rise by noon. Mix as other bread ; 
mold and put in pans at once ; let stand until li^ht, 
when it is ready for the oven. If you have no milk, 
water will do for the rising. 

Betsy, Inavale, Neb. 
The recipe : In the morning take a quart dish and 
scald it out ; then put in a pint of warm water ; put in 
a teaspoonful of salt ; stir flour enough in to make a 
thick batter ; set the dish in a kettle of warm water, 
and where it will keep of the same temperature— just 
warm enough to bear your hand in. If the flour is 
good it will be at the top of the dish in 2 hours ; then 
take flour enough in a pan to make 3 loaves of bread ;

make a hole in the middle ; put in the yeast, and the 
same dish full of warm water ; stir it up thick with a 
spoon, and cover it with some of the flour, and set it

Aunt NeUie Bly, St. Joseph, Mich. 
Break 2 eggs in a bowl, with 1 large cup of sugar, 1 
cup sour milk, 1 teaspoon soda, spices to suit the taste. 
Mix very soft. That is the secret of good fried cakes. 
Have yom- fat hot ; drop in 5 or 6 ; tliey will almost 
turn over themselves they are so light; keep some 
going in and some coming out all the time ; the last 
ones cool the fat, so the first ones do not get so brown ; 
but cook through. 

Mrs. W., Green Bay. 
I set my sponge for them about 2 or 3 o'clock, so I 
can fry them the next forenoon. Make a sponge, using 
1 quart water and 1 cake yeast. Let it rise until very 
light (about 5 hours is usually suflicient). Then add 1 
coffee-cup full of lard, 2 of white sugar, 3 large mash- 
ed potatoes or 2 eggs (the potatoes are nicer), and a 
small nutmeg. Let rise again until very light. Roll 
and cut, or pull off bits of dough and shape as vou like. 
Lay enough to fry at one time on a floured plate, and 
set'intxthe oven to warm. Drop in boiling lard, and 
fry longer than cakes made with baking powder. If 
the dough is light enough, and you heat it before

Crullers. 

Mrs. E.K., Blue Island. 

Three eggs; 1 cup suffar; 4 tablespoonfuls melted 
lard, 6 sweet milk, 2 taolespoonf uls oaking powder ; 
any flavoring you wish, and flour to roll nicely. I beat 
the eggs and sugar together first ; then add the lard, 
beating well ; then the milk ; ])ut my baking-powder in 
the flour, and sift it in, stirring it with a spoon as long 
as I can, as I dislike using my nands. 

Three fourths of a pound granulated sugar, i pound 
butter, 1 cupful milk, 5 eggs, pinch of salt, teaspoonful 
vanilla extract, nutmeg to taste, 3 i)ounds sifted flour ; 
mix butter, sugar, and part of the milk to a very creamy 
batter; then the eggs, rest of milk and flavormg, then 
some of the flour, ana beat till very light, adding the flour 
till very stiff; then with the hands knead in nearly all the 
flour, reserving a little for flouring the pastry board ; 
cut oft" a lump, roll out i inch thick, and cut in pieces 
3 inches long and 2 wide, twist in fancy shapes, drop 
few at a time in boiling hot lard, sift powdered sugar 
over them, when cool slii) on a large meat-dish, and 
carefully, as they are crisp and break easily. This 
quantity requires nearly 4 pounds of lard to cook them; 
keep the fat boiling ; slices of peeled white potato drop- 
ped in the fat absorbs the sediment from the dough 
that darkens the fat ; take the potato out when black 
and put in another piece.

Strawberry Short Cake. 
Theo. C. C, Chicago. 

First prepare the berries by picking ; after they have 
been well washed— the best way to wash them is to 
hold the boxes under the faucet and let a gentle stream 
of water run over them into an earthen bowl— then 
drain, and pick them into an earthen bowl ; now take 
the potato-masher and bruise them and cover with a 
thick layer of white sugar ; now set them aside till the 
cake is made. Take a quart of sifted flour ; i a cup of 
sweet butter ; 1 egg, well beaten ; 3 teaspoonfuls of 
baking-powder, and milk enough to make a rather stiff 
dough; knead well, and roll with the rolling-pin till 
about 1 inch thick ; bake till a nice brown, and when 
done, remove it to the table ; turn it out of the pan ; 
with a light, sharp knife, cut it down lengthwise and 
crossways ; now run the knife through it, and lay it 
open for a few moments, just to let the steam escape 
(the steam ruins the color of the berries) ; then set the 
bottom crust on the platter ; cover thickly with the 
berries, an inch and a half deep ; lay the top crust on 
the fruit ; dust thickly with powdered sugar, and if 
any berry juice is left in the bowl, pour it round the 
cake, not over it, and you will have a delicious short 
cake.

Daily Reader, HUlsddle, Mich. 

Four eggs — ^whites only ; 1 cup of powdered sugar ;

1 cup flour ; 2 teaspoonfuls baking powder, lemon or 
rosewater flaA^orin^. Cream the butter and sugar 
thoroughly either with the hand or a silver spoon ; mix 
the corn-starch with the milk, and add. Then add the 
eggs, beaten stiff; next the sifted flour, into which 
the baking-powder has been stirred. Mix all well; 
bake nicely, and call in your friends to help eat it, as 
this, like all corn-starch cake, is not fit to eat after the 
second day, and is much the best the same day it is 
baked. 

Cream Puffs. 
Mrs. Eve, Kalamazoo, Mich. 

One-half pint cold water, in which rub smooth 6 
ounces of flour ; put it into a spider with 4 ounces of 
butter, and stir it continually over a fire not too hot, 
. till it is thoroughly cooked. It will resemble a lump 
of putty and cleave off the spider like a pancake. Cool 
this lump, and add 4 eggs. Beat well, and then drop 
on a buttered tin in neat, compact little ''dabs," far 
enough apart not to touch when they rise. Have the 
oven about as hot as for cookies, and in turning them 
lift up the tin. If you shove them before they are set 
you will have pancakes. They should be hollow balls. 
Bake them long enough so they will not fall when re- 
moved, and cool them on brown paper as quickly as 
possible, so tliey won't sweat. To fill them take i pint 
milk ; 2 beaten eggs ; i cup of flour or corn-starch wet 
smoothly ; 1 cup sugar ; lemon or vanilla flavor; cook 
it in a tin pail in a kettle of hot water, and stir it so it 
will be smooth. When both are cold, open the puff 
with a sharp knife ; just a little slit on the side, and 
fill in one tablespoonful of custard, j

Frostins. 

Oerman American, Chicago. 

EAT i pound pulverized sugar with tlie juice of 
1 large lemon ; add the white of 1 egg beaten 
to a stiff froth; and 1 tablespoon of rum or 
arrak. Beat till a snowy white, put over your 
cake and dry in a warm oven. 

Chocolate Frosting. 

I Sarah E., Chicayo. 

I One cake (or i pound) ^laillard's French vanilla 
sweet chocolate, grated; i cup granulated sugar ; f cup 

] sweet milk ; 1 tablespoon butter ; a little salt. Boil 20 
minutes, stirring constantly. Take from the fire and 
pour into a dish. When near cool, add 1 tablespoon of 
vanilla ; spread on the cake. If the mixture is thicker 
than jelly, thin it with milk. This quantity will ice 2 
cakes, 3 layers each. The best cake is gold cake baked 
in jelly-tins. This will prove a success if the experi- 
menter can catch that ''twist of the wrist" that forms 
an essential but indefinable part of every woman's 
recipe. 

Aunt PiMy, Chicago. 
Whites of 3 eggs, beaten very light ; 9 tablespoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar, and 6 tablespoons of grated 
chocolate. 

yirs. Knowlton, Rockford. 
First make a cream or custard pie, reserving for 
frosting the whites of 3 eggs, using the yolks and 1 or 
2 whole eggs for the pie. While your pie is baking 
scrape very fine 2 tablespoonfuls of Baker's chocolate, 
and place it on the back part of the stove to melt. 
Now beat the whites of your eggs well ; add 6 tea- 
spoonfuls of pulverized sugar. When the chocolate is 



COOKERY— FROSTING, ICING, ETC. 91 

melted, stir a little of the frosting into it, beating very 
hard; add a little more, until all is added. Do not 
make the mistake of stirring the chocolate into the 
egg, as it will remain clouded. When the pie is done, 
pour the frosting on top, and return to the oven for 5 
minutes. I find in using chocolate it is nnicli better 
to warm it until it is soft enough to mix in frosting or 
Charlotte Eusse, than to dissolve it with water. 

Icing. 

Tanliee Hoosier, Lafayette, Ind. 
Two and a half cups sugar, I cup water ; boil to- 
gether until it candies ; then add the whites of 3 eggs, 
slightly beaten, stirring briskly for 15 minutes, or until 
it seems perfectly smooth and white; then add the 
juice of 1 lemon. This is sufficient for one large white 
mountain cake, of 8 or 9 layers, covering also top and 
sides. 

Mrs. Rose B., Addison. 
Beat the whites of 4 eggs with 1 pound of powdered 
sugar sifted, with i a tablespoon starch, and i of an 
ounce of fine gum-arabic. 8tn- it well.

Pie Crust. 

Aunt Lucy, Chicago. 
Take 3 cups of sifted flour, 1 cup of lard, a little salt, 
and i a cup of cold water. Handle as little as possible. 
Never butter or grease your pie pans— it will make the 
under crust stick and the pie hard to slip out.

Pansy, St. Joseph, Mich. 
Two lemons ; grate off the outer peel ; chop the rest 
verv fine ; put 2 tablespoons of corn-starch in 1 teacup 
of hot water, and boil; when cool add 2 teacups of 
white sugar ; the beaten yolks of 4 eggs ; then add the

ttie 4 eggs to a stiff froth ; add 5 spoons (table) of sugar, 
stirring in well ; pour over the pie while hot ; set in the 
oven to brown. 

Jennie Dean, St. Paul. 
Two large fresh lemons ; ^ate off the rind ; if not 
bitter, reserve it for the filling of the pie; pare off 
every bit of the white skin of the lemon (as it toughens 
while cooking); then cut the lemon into very thin 
slices with sharp knife, and take out the seeds ; 2 cup- 
f uls of sugar, 3 tablespoonfuls of water, and 2 of sifted 
flour. Put into the pie a layer of lemon, then 1 of 
sugar, then 1 of the grated rind, and, lastly, of flour, 
and so on till the ingredients are used : sprinkle the 
water over all, and cover with upper crust. Be sure to 
have the under crust lap over the upper, and pinch it 
well, as the sirup will cook all out if care is not taken 
when finishing the edge of crust. This quantity makes 
1 medium-sized pie. 

Orange Pie. 

Martha, Galva, lU. 
Take the juice and grated rind of 1 orange ; 1 small 
cup of sugar ; yolks of 3 eggs ; 1 tablespoon of corn-

in i cup of water. iStir in the orange, and bake with 2 
crusts. In this, as indeed in all cooking, judgment 
must be used, as oranges vary in size and sweetness ; 
but these are the usual proportions, and are sufficient 
for an ordinary-sized pie. 

Mrs. J. C. n., Chicago. 

Take 4 good-sized oranges, peel, seed, and cut in very 

small pieces. Add a cup of sugar, and let stand. Into 

a quart of nearly boiling milk stir 2 tablespoonfuls of 

corn-starch mixed with a little water, and the yolks of 

3 eggs. When this is done, let it cool, then mix with 
the oranges. Put it in simply a lower crust. Make a 
frosting of the whites of the esgs and i cup sugar. 
Spread it over top of pies, and place for a few seconds 
in the oven to brown.

it with cold water the same as you would to make 
starch ; turn boiling wat6r on it, stirring while cooking 
on the stove a few moments, adding a pinch of salt 
with the grated rind of the lemons. When thickened

Squash JPie. 

Germania, South Evanston. 
Obtain a good Hubbard squash, saw into quarters, and 
bake 2 of these until dry and thoroughly done. Scoop out 
the dry mealy part, and while warm add a tablespoon- 
ful of flour, and rub it well, wetting as you go with a 
little milk. This should be heated, and to this quan- 
tity of squash you will want 3 pints of milk. Now 
come the eggs ; 2 for a pie will do ; 3 won't hurt. Use 
a small teacup of sugar for each pie. To this add the 
yolks of the eggs, and beat a long time, adding for 
each pie one teaspoonful of ginger and one of cinna- 
mon. Line your tins with a nice paste, in which you 
have sifted a little baking-powder. Beat up your 
whites to a stiff froth ; stir the yolks in first, then the 
whites ; fill your shell and place in oven, which must 
not be too hot, as they will brown too fast and spoil the 
golden foam that comes to the top. 

Eloise Howe, Rockfordy 111. 

Boil enough squash with a little salt in the water to 
make a quart of pulp ; 1 quart of milk ; 2 cups of sugar ; 
1 tablespoon ginger ; i a nutmeg the grated rind of a 
lemon ; four eggs, or 2 with corn-starch ; bake in deep 
pie-plates. 

R., Dubuque, Iowa. 

Steam a fine Hubbard squash ; when done beat per- 
fectly smooth ; add 2 eggs, i cup butter, 1 quart rich 
cream ; sugar to taste ; flavor witli nutmeg or grated 
lemon. Tnis makes three pies. 

PoUy Siiooks, Chicago. 
Steam the squash over a pot of corn-beef until it is 
well done ; then mash fine, adding 2 eggs well beaten 
to each pie. It requires a good deal ot sugar to make 
them nice, some salt, very little pepper, and enough 
ginger to make it quite strong. Thin with milk and 
cream mixed together, or milk alone, will make good 
pies. Bake without top crust, quite brown.

6i pounds sugar; 1 pint molasses; 1 pound suet; a 
little salt ; four large oranges ; cinnamon, cloves, mace, 
allspice and nutmeg to your taste ; 2 pounds citron ; 3 
gallons cider. Boil the orange-peel in some of the 
cider to make it soft ; use the cider the peel was boiled 
in also. If I dared, I'd say put in a teacup of brandy 
when you are ready to bake. 

Mincemeat. 

Aunt Lucy^ Chicago, 
Pour pounds meat, 3 pounds suet, 3 pounds raisins, 3 
pounds currants, 1 pound citron, 3 pounds brown 
sugar, 1 pint sirup or molasses, grated rind and juice 
of 8 lemons, 2 ounces ground cnmamon, 1 ounce of 
cloves, 1 ounce of nutmeg. Boil meat very tender; 
pick out all bits of fat and gristle. Chop the suet line, 
removing all strings and threads ; then mix thoroughly 
together; season with salt and black pepper; wash 
many times the currants ; let them well dry, and then 
add to the mixture ; seed the raisins, and chop not fine ; 
add the sirup and spices ; slice the citron thin. To a 
quart of the above add a pint of chopped apples. It is 
best only to add the apples at each baking. Wet with 
sweet cider till the mixture is juicy. AVhen ready to 
bake, take mincemeat, just enough tor the number of 
pies wanted ; place it on the stove in a crock or jar and 
let it ^et heated through ; taste and add whatever you 
think it needs— it may be a little salt or spice, or per- 
haps it is not sweet enough. Make pastry rich ; place 
the mincemeat in the pie, not too full ; and some little 
bits of butter, a few whole raisins, and a few slices of 
citron. Keep mincemeat well covered and in a cool 
place.

a pie-tin with crust, and bake. If it rises up while 
baking, press it down with your hand before it gets 
hard. Heat 1 pint of milk boiling hot; then take i

Beat them together, and stir into the boiling milk, and 
cook about 5 minutes, (I cook in a 3-pint basin, set in 
another dish containing water, to prevent burning). 
After the crust is baked, put in the mixture ; then put

I put a cup of cocoanut to soak in sweet milk as early 
in the morning as I can. I take a teacup of the cocoa- 
nut and put it into a coffeecup, and fill up with milk. 
When ready to bake I take 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 
mix with milk, and stir in f of a cup of milk (or water), 
place on the stove, and stir until it thickens. Add but- 
ter the size of a walnut while warm. When cool add a 
little salt, 2 eggs, saving out the white of one for the 
top. Sweeten to taste. Add the cocoanut, beating well. 
Fill the crust and bake. When done, have the extra 
white beaten ready to spread over the top. Eeturn to 
the oven and brown lightly. 

Winnifred, Warsaw^ III. 
Open tiie eyes of a cocoanut with a pointed knife or 
a gimlet, and pour out the milk into a cup ; then break 
the shell and take out the meat and grate it fine. Take 
the same weight of sugar and the grated nut and stir 
togetlier ; beat 4 eggs, the whites and yolks separately 
to a stiff foam ; mix 1 cup of cream, and the milk of the 
cocoanut with the sugar and nut, then add the eggs 
and a few drops of orange or lemon extract. Line deep 
pie-tins with a nice crust, fill them with the custard, 
and bake carefully i an horn,-.

flour enough to make it the consistency of apple sauce ; 
add sugar, cinnamon, a little nutmeg, allspice, which 
must predominate, and some well-washed currants; 
also a little butter melted and stirred in. If it is 
baker's bread, scald a little saleratus, and stir in thor- 
oughly, but, if it is house-made bread, add a teaspoon- 
ful of baking powder to your flour, at the rate of 2 
teaspoonf uls to a quart of pudding. Bake in shallow 
pans ; cut in squares when serving ; turn over, and 
put on each a small piece of butter, and dust plenti- 
fully with powdered sugar. This requires a littie care 
in making, but is universally liked and very whole- 
some and economical, as no eggs or cream are re- 
quired. 

Mrs. W. A. S., Arlington, III, 

Of clean, broken pieces, a quart when crumbed— I 
put sweet milk to them right after breakfast, and set 
them on the open top of the boiling teakettle. They 
will swell and soften so as to nearly soak up the milk 
by the middle of the forenoon. Then beat up 3 effgs 
and add tbem, also 1 teacup of sugar, 1 teaspoonf ul of 
ground cinnamon, and a i teaspoonful of ground 
cloves, a little grated nutmeg, a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, and i of a pint of raisins, the latter picked over 
carefully and w^ashed by pouring boiling water over 
them. The boiling water softens them and causes 
them to swell. Mix all ingredients together thorough- 
ly, and bake about an hour in a moderately-heated 
oven. It can be sliced and eaten cold with a relish, or 
eaten while warm with sweet sauce. 

Kena's Pudding.

takes up, pour it ofi until dry ; then beat fine with a 
spoon ; if it is very watery, press w^ater out and throw 
away. To 1 quart of breacl, after soaked, add 1 cup 
(large) of currants or raisins ; 1 large tablespoon of 
sugar. Bake in hot oven for 40 mmutes, if not too

chopped raisins, a pinch of salt, a teaspoonful of cin- 
namon, 3 pints of flour, and 2 teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder. Tut the flour in last, and stir all together 
thoroughly. Boil 2i houre in a bowl or tin pudding 
mold. This may be eaten with wine sauce, and is a 
good imitation of genuine plum pudding. 

Bread and Apple Pudding. 

S. A. T., Champaign. 

Butter a pudding dish ; place in it alternate layers 
of bread crumbs and thinly sliced apples , sprinkle 
sugar over each layer of apples ; when the dish is filled,

Apple Pudding:. 
Mrs. Henry C. Port Huron. 

Make a good paste ; roll it out and place in a basin 
rubbed with dripping ; press out the plaits so that the 
crust may be of an equal thickness all round ; peel and 
cut up 4 lai'ge apples, put -k of them in, then add 1 
tablespoonful moist sugar and 1 of cloves ; put in the 
rest of the apples ; cover the top well over with paste , 
press it down, that the water may not get in ; tie a 
cloth over; put it into boiling water and boil fast for 
2i hours, if the crust be made of dripping, and an hour 
longer if it be made of suet ; take off the cloth, pass a 
knife around the edge of the basin. Turn out the 
pudding carefully when sending it to table.

Mrs. T. IF., Fairbury, in 
Four tablespoonfuls of tapioca ; 1 quart of milk ; 4 
eggs, leaving out the whites of 2 for frosting ; 3 table- 
spoonfuls of sugar. Soak the tapioca over night, or

turn over the tapioca. Add, when it is blood warm, 
the sugar and eggs well beaten ; bake about an hour, 
and after it has cooled a little, add the whites of the 
eggs to i pound sugar for frosting. It answers well for

Plum Pnddins. 

G. M., Tiffln, Ohio, 
Two pounds of stoned raisins ; 2 pounds well wash- 
ed Zante currants ; 1 pound sliced citron ; 2 pounds 
finely chopped beef suet ; 1 pound flour ; 1 pound bread 
crumbs ; 1 pound sugar ; 1 nutmeg ; 1 teaspoonf ul each 
of powdered cloves, allspice andcmnamon ; the grated 
peel of a lemon, and 1 tablespoonful of salt. Mix

Spiced Padding. 

Mrs. C. C, Warren^ lU, 
Take 1 small square loaf of baked bread, peel off the 
crust, cut in pieces, and pour upon it 1 pint of boiling 
water, and add 1 teaspoonf ul of salt. Take 1 pint of 
flour ; add 1 heaping teaspoonful of baking powder : 
2 coffee cups of raisins, seeded and chopped ; mix all 
well with the flour, first powders and next raisins : 
then lidd soaked bread and 1 teaspoonful each of 
allspice, cinnamon, mace and cloves. Then add by 
degrees 1 coffee cup of sweet milk, and beat the mass 
well together. Scald pudding bag, and put in the pud- 
ding, which should be pretty stiff, and boil 3 hours. 
The whole secret lies in plunging puddings in boiling 
water, immediately after they are mixed, and never 
letting them cease boiling. Be sure and turn them 
over, and always leave room in the bag for swelling. 
I have a wire basket made for holding puddings while 
boiling, made with legs, to keep them from the bottom 
of the Kettle, so as to prevent burning.

ding. 

Batter Padding.

one smooth mass. Scald a pudding bag in boiling

kettle of boiling water, and boil 2 hours. To be eaten

Plum Pudding. 

One quart of flour ; 1 coffee cup chopped raisins ; 1 
teacupful of currants ; 1 teacupful chopped suet ; i cup 
candied lemon finely shred ; 1 cup brown sugar ; 1 tea- 
spoonful of salt, and 2 of baking powder, and 2 cups of 
sweet milk.^ Sift the flour; put m the baking powder 
and salt, mixing thoroughly. Next add the raisins, 
currants and candied lemon, and incorporate well with 
the flour, so they will not sink to the bottom, as they 
will always do unless mixed first with the flour. Then 
put in suet and sugar, and lastly the milk, and, after 
stiiring well, put in a bag which has been dipped in 
boiling water, and boil 3 hours. Do not let the fire 
get low so the pudding will stop boiling, and replenish 
always from a boiling teakettle. When done, put on 
a large platter, remove the strings, and turn the bag 
wrong side out — that is, pull it gently back and it will 
come off smoothly, if the bag is well scalded. Omit 
the lemon if you do not care for it so rich. Sauce : One 
cup sugar, i cup butter, 1 tablespoonful of flour, and 1 
egg ; melt the butter in the sauce-pan and stir m the 
flour until the whole is smooth ; then stir in the egg, 
and pour upon this 1 pint of boiling water. By adding 
3 tablespoons of brandy, it becomes brandy sauce, or 
the juice and grated rind of a lemon, it is called lemon 
sauce.

Oat-meal Cake^t. 

Mrs. B. J. G., Onslow, la. 

XE cup oat-meal, wet with 1 cup sweet milk ; 
soak over night; in the morning add a little 
salt, 1 teaspoonful baking powder, 1 egg, and 
enough sweet milk and a little cream to make 
as other gems ; bake in gem-pans in a quick oven. 

Back^vheat Cakes. 

C. M. TF., Hudson, Mich. 

It will soon be time for buckwheat cakes. For the 
very best, make them i Graham ; set them with yeast 
over nighty adding a little sugar and salt. Use milk 
or water. 

Breakfast Cakes. 
J. A. S., Menasha, Wis. 

One egg beaten very light ; 1 cup of Graham flour ; 
1 cup of wheat flour ; a little salt ; sweet milk enough 
to thin them like griddle cakes. To be baked in irons 
heated hot before putting them in. This will make 
just 12. Be particular and beat the eggs very light. 

Corn-meal Cakes. 

Belle M.D., Chicago. 
Take 2 cups of corn-meal, 1 cup of flour, a little salt. 
Mix well together. Two eggs well beaten ; 1 pint of 
thick sour milk, in a little of which stir 1 even tea- 
spoonful of soda. Mix well together in a batter, and 
fry on a well-greased griddle. The ladies need not be 
afraid to let their children eat them.

flour ; beat very light ; put in apple enough to thicken 
the batter, and the grated yellow rind and juice of a 
lemon ; have the very best lard at a perfectly boiling 
point ; put in it a thick slice of raw apple ; put a large 
spoonful of the batter in at a time, and as many spoon- 
fuls as the pan will hold ; they take but a few mo- 
ments to do and need not be turned over ; must be 
made at the moment you wish to use them and sent to 
the table at once, each panful sent in as quickly as 
baked ; powdered sugar with cinnamon and nutmeg 
in it, is nice for them. 

Crashed ^Vheat Fritters. 

Pamy^ St. Joseph, Mich. 

Take cold crushed wheat; 1 large tablespoon of 
flour ; 1 tablespoon sugar. Mix all together with 1 
egg well beaten ; drop with a large spoon into good 
hot lard, and fry a nice browu. The best way to cook 
crushed wheat is to put it in a double boiler with 
water, boiling hot, enough to cover it. When well 
soaked, which will be in about i an hour, mix up with 
milk and let it simmer f of an hour. 

Corn Fritters. 

Mrs. S. B. C, Elgin. 
Three ears of green corn ; 1 egg ; a little salt and 
pepper ; flour enough to keep from separating in the 
fat. Fry as you do the rice fritters. Shave the corn 
thin, and scrape out the pulp. I used to grate it, but 
this is not so tedious and does as well. 

Buck^rheat t^hort-cake. 

Ruby, Washington Heights. 
Three cups sour milk ; 1 teaspoon saleratus dissolv- 
ed in the milk, with a little salt ; mix up a dough with 
buckwheat flour thicker than you would for batter 
cakes (say, quite stiff). Put into a buttered tin, and 
bake in hot oven 30 minutes. 

Oat Meal Cakes.

baking than buckwheat. It can also be used in mak- 
ing stir-cake, by using about i wheat flour. 
S. S. B., Chicago, 

Put 2 or 3 handfuls of meal into a bowl, and moisten 
it with water merely sufficient to form it into a cake ; 
knead it out round and round with the hands upon the 
board, strewing meal under and over it until it is as 
thin as desired, and put it on a hot griddle, bake it till 
it is slightly brown on the under side, then take it off 
and toast that side before the fire which was upper- 
most on the griddle. 

Ciiraliain Griddle Cakes. 
Cousin Sarah^ Canton, 111. 

Use the white wheat Graham, if possible. Equal 
parts of Graham flour and corn-meal stirred into sour 
buttermilk, or other sour milk, with a little butter 
added, soda and salt, and 1 or more spoons of sugar. 
Try them, and if sticky, the milk is too sour ; add 1 or 
2 eggs, or a little water. This is not a precise recipe, 
but I think no one will have trouble with it, especial- 
ly as it can be varied considerably and still be good. 
I sometimes use all Graham flour : try it both ways, 
and I think you'll like them.

,ARE, slice, stew and sweeten 6 tart juicy apples. 
Mash very smooth or rub through a sieve. Sea- 
son with nutmeg or lemon-peel. Line a gener- 
ous-sized plate with an under crust, and bake 
first. Whip the whites of 3 eggs— with 3 tablespoon- 
fuls of pulverized sugar — till it stands alone. Till the 
crust with apple, then spread the eggs smoothly over 
the top: Return to the oven and brown nicely. If 
you put your eggs in a dish of cold water a while be- 
fore breaking them, they will beat up nicer.

Put the juice of 1 lemon and the rind of 2 to 1 quart 
of thick cream. Sweeten with i pound sugar, and let 
it stand for i an hour. Add 1 ounce of isinglass dis- 
solved in i pint of water till perfectly smooth and free

M., La Crosse, Wis. 
Sweeten a pint of cream very sweet; flavor with

will get very cold ; when nearly ready for dessert beat 
new-fallen snow into the cream till stiff enough to 
stand alone ; serve immediately. 

Apple Snoi;%'. 

Dorothea, Bloomington, III. 
Prepare 8 medium-sized apples as for sauce ; after it 
is cold, break the white of 1 egg in a dish ; turn your 
apple-sauce over it, and whip with a fork 30 minutes. 
Care should be taken that each blemish be carefully 
'cut away in preparing the apples, as the whiteness of 
the snow depends mainly on this.

Charlotte Rnsse. 

Dryad, Chicago. 
One pint of cream ; 1 of a box of gelatine ; 2 table- 
spoons of sugar. Flavor to taste. Tut the sugar in 
tne cream before whipping it, then whip it until it is 
quite stiff and light. Pour cold water over the gela- 
tine, and let it stand until all is dissolved. Then add 
the cream, and pour into a mold lined with slices of 
sponge cake. Stand in a cool place for a few hours. 
This recipe I use to line my mold with : 4 eggs ; 2 cups 
of sugar ; 3 cups of flour ; 3 teaspoons of baking-pow- 
der; 1 cup of sweet milk. Beat the sugar and e^gs 
together for 15 minutes. Stir in the sifted flour with 
the baking-powder. Add the milk, and bake. 

Velvet Blanc Mange. 

Bella, Kankakee, lU. 
Two CTjps sweet cream, i ounce Cooper's gelatine, 
soaked in a very little cold water 1 hour ; i a cup white 
powdered sugar. 1 teaspoonful extract of bitter al- 
monds, 1 glass or white wine. Heat the cream to boil- 
ing, stir in the gelatine and sugar, and as soon as they 
are dissolved take from the fire, beat 10 minutes until 
very light, flavor and add the wine by degrees, mixing 
it well. Irut into molds wet with clear water. 

Irish. Moss. 

Mary, Peoria. 
Soak a scant handful of Irish moss in strong soda- 
water until it swells ; then squeeze the moss until it is 
free from water, and put it in a tin bucket which con- 
tains 6 pints of sweet milk. Set the bucket in a lax^e 
iron pot which holds several ^)iiits of hot water ; stir 
seldom, and let it remain until it will jell slightly by 
dropping on a cold plate. Strain through a sieve, 
sweeten and flavor to taste. Rinse a mold or a crock 
with tepid water ; pour in the mixture, and set it away 
to cool. In a few hours it will be palatable. Eat with 
cream and sugar— some add jelly. 

Telvet Cream. 

Mrs. E. H.. Chicago. 
Take a package of gelatine and soak it in a cup of

stove till heated through and thoroughly smooth (hav- 
ing added sufficient sugar to sweeten a quart of cream), 
btrain through a fine sieve, and add the cream when 
nearly cold, stirring until well mixed. Flavor of 
course— almond is very delicate— turn into a mold, and 
It will harden in a short time in cold weather. Some 
people use a cup of white wine instead of water, but it 
will be more apt to curdle. 

Floating Island. 

Lou, Tuscola, lU, 
Beat the yolks of 3 eggs imtil very light ; sweeten and 
flavor to taste ; stir into a quart of boiling milk ; cook 
till it thickens ; when cool, pour into a low glass dish : 
whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth ; sweeten, 
and pour over a dish of boiling water to cook. Take 
a tablespoon and drop the whites on top of the cream, 
far enough apart so that the 'Mittle white islands'^ 
w ill not touch each other. By dropping little specks 
of bright jelly on each island will be produced a pleas- 
ing effect. Also by filling wine glasses and arranging 
aroimd the stand adds to the appearance of the table.

water in your kettle, and let it boil ; then add the ap- 

Eles. After they begin to cook stir constantly till the

COOKERY— FRUITS, JELLIES, ETC. 127 

cold water; 1 package of Cox's gelatine; juice of 2 
lem )ns and grated rind of 1 ; 1 quart of boiling water ; 
1 good pinch of cinnamon. Soak the gelatine in the 
cold water 1 hour ; add to this the sugar, lemons and 
cinnamon ; pour over all a quart of boiling water, and 
stir until the gelatine is thoroughly dissolved. Put in 
the wine ; strain through a double flannel bag without 
squeezing ; wet your molds with cold water, and set 
the jelly aAvajr in them to cool. 

Cider jelly is made the same way by substituting a 
pint of pure sweet cider for the wine. If you wish 
them colored, use the colored sugar, or a very little 
prepared cochineal. 

i^aince Jelly. 

Mrs. E. H., Chicago. 
Cover the fruit with water and boil until the good- 
ness is all out (it will require ^ or f of an hour). Then 
strain tlirough flannel or crash, without much squeez- 
ing. >^:rain twice if not clear ; add equal quantities of 
juice r.nd sugar and boil steadily about twenty min- 
utes. It is better to leave the glasses several days be- 
fore sealing, even if not quite hard, as yeur jelly will 
be much more delicate than if boiled too long. 

Hiusekeepcr, Chicago. 

AVash the fruit ; save all the nice parings and seeds ; 
cook for an hour or more in more water than will cover 
them ; then run them through the colander and let 
them sit until next day, or until the fruit substance 
has settled ; now throw^ofE the clear juice through a 
thin muslin bag, and sit on the fire ; Miien boiling well 
add 1 pint of sugar to each pint of juice, and boil until 
it rolls oil the spoon ; fill the jelly-cups, and let them 
sit by the stove or any warm place a couple of days 
without covers, so as to evaporate any water if the 
jelly is not stilf enough. 

Any jelly is better to be taken from the fire before 
quite done, as it will finish by sitting on the heater or 
near a warm stove, and if it boils 1 minute too long it 
will never be anything but a sticky, good-for-nothing 
kind of sirup. 

Apple or any fruit jelly can be made by boiling the 
fruit (not skins and seeds) and treated in the same way.

Two ounces isinglass ; 1 pound double refined sugar ; 

3 pints well strained cranberry juice. Make a strong

juice ; boil up ; strain it into shape. 

Crab Apple Jelly. 

Little Sally, Jejferson, Wis. 
Wash the apples, halve them, and cut out the blos- 
som. Then put them into a porcelain-lined kettle and 
turn boiling water onthem,DUi not enough to cover 
them (as some say), and cook them until very soft, 
stirring them occasionally to prevent burning. (Here 
let me say, that you need not be at all caref lU for fear 
of mixing the pulp with the sirup, as it makes no dif- 
ference' whatever.) Next remove them from the fire 
and let them cool oa some, and then put them into a 
bag made double from a piece of an old table cloth 
coarse and soft, and then put them into a large milk- 
pan and squeeze them. After squeezing out a little, 
empty them into the kettle, and so on dome:, ui.tt they 
might not soak into the ba^ again. Now comes an 
important little item which I found out at the time, 
and did not know before. In consequence of having 
the bag double, I found that I could squeeze them very 
hard without any of the pulp getting throu^n. You 
can easily tell when this part of the work is lone. 
Then I put the juice into the kettle and boil ., re- 
moving the scum as it rises, until perfectly clear, and 
continue to boil it a few minutes longer. I then 
measure it, and there is li quarts, and add just the 
same amount of sugar (granulated), and boil it a little 
over i an hour. You must " try " it before that time 
—put a little into a tin dish and set it into cold water. 
Make just a little allowance, for, after standing a day 
or two, it will be a little thicker than when you try it. 
If you find that your jelly is not thick enough the next 
day after it is made, you can turn it all back into the 
kettle and bQ^il it over. Five minutes will make a great 
difference. 



COOKERY— FRUITS, JELLIES, ETC. 129 

limine Jelly. 

Mrs. E. H., Chicago, 

Wine jelly requires no eggs for clarifying if made 
from Cox's gelatine. Take 1 25-cent packet, juice of 3 
lemons, rind of 1, and 1 pint of cold water ; let stand 1 
hour ; then add 2 pints boiling water, H pounds white 
sugar, and a pint of sherry wine ; turn into molds to 
cool, after straining. If you like cinnamon flavor, add 
a few drops of that extract. If you wish to make any 
other kind of jelly, omit the sherry and add orange 
juice, or anything you like. An elegant-looking jelly 
for company can be made in two colors by dividing 
when all ready for molding and coloring i with a few 
drops of cochineal (better procm^e it prepared at the 
druggist's). A third stripe can be made by dissolving 
a little gelatine in milk, out put no wine in, or it will 
curdle. 

Each color must harden before adding the next, or 

they will run. The result is delightful, but it is rather 

slow work. The top ornament of blanc mange is much 

handsomer if colored with cochineal. 

Ste-wed Cranberries. 

Mrs. W. S. G., Baraboo, Wis. 

One pound cranberries washed and picked over one 
by one, so as not to put in any soft or decayed ones ; 1 
pound granulated sugar-, i pint water. Place the 
water and sugar on the range to boil, stirring con- 
stantly ; when boiling hot, throw in the berries— they 
will soon heat through and begin to burst ; stir contin- 
ually till well cooked ; it will take about 10 minutes 
after all begins to boil ; throw in a mold, previously 
dipped in cold water and not dried, and set till the fol- 
lowmg day. The above recipe makes the cranberries 
neither too acid nor too sweet— will invariably turn 
out like jelly— but is far nicer to eat with turkey, game, 
or poultry, as you have the full berry. I often prepare 
10 pounds at a time, and it keeps perfectly, by pasting 
paper over the molds or bowls, 6 or 8 weeks. Always 
use porcelain kettles for cooking fruits in. 
i^piced Citron. 
Jane Eyre., Michigan City. 

Prepare the fruit, cover with vinegar and let it stand 



130 COOKERY— FRUITS, JELLIES, ETC. 

over night ; in the morning pour off, and to every 7 
pounds fruit allow 3i pounds of white sugar and a pint 
of vinegar ; tie in a muslin bag a tablespoonful of each 
of the different spices ; make a skup of the sugar, put 
in the fruit and cook for i hour ; when all the fruit is 
done add the vinegar and let the sirup boil thick ; pour 
it over the fruit not, and let it get cold before sealing 
up the jars. 

Preserved Citron. 
Mrs. L. M. Gm Lawrence, Kansas. 
Pare and remove the seeds, rejecting all but the solid 
part of the melon , cut in such pieces as you choose ; 
weigh the pieces, and boil in water until you can easily 
cut them ; remove the fruit, and add sugar to make 
the sirup, allowing 1 pound of sugar to each pound of 
fruit. When it boils, put in the fruit, and boil slowly 
1 hom:. When cold, add sliced lemon, allowing 1 
lemon for 2 pounds of citron. 1 lar^e teacup of water 
is the general rule for one pound of fruit. 

Mrs. T. O. E., Chicago. 
Pare and cut citron into i inch cubes, picking out all 
seeds. To 1 pound of citron 2 fresh lemons, and sugar 
equal to weight of lemons and melon. Boil the melon 
in clear water till very tender, skim out, and to same 
water add sugar ; then boil till thick sirup. Cut the 
lemons in halves and boil in a verj^ little water 20 min- 
utes, then squeeze and strain the juice and water. Add 
the citron to the sirup and only let boil 15 minutes ; 
also add the lemon- water 10 minutes before taking off. 
The citron toughens if cooked longer

Mixed. 

X. Y. Z., Hudson, Mich, 

^E colander of sliced green tomatoes, 1 quart 
sliced onions, 1 colander of cucumbers pared and 
sliced, 2 good handfuls of salt. Let all stand 
over night ; then drain through sieve, and scald 
i cup celery seed, i ounce allspice, 1 teacup white mus- 
tard seed, 1 tablespoon black pepper, 1 pound brown 
sugar, 2 tablespoons mustard, 1 gallon vinegar, poured 
over hot. 

Orape. 
K., Galesburg^IU. 
Take ripe grapes ; remove all imperfect and broken 
ones : divide the large bunches, as they will pack more 
closely ; put in an earthen jar a layer of grapes and 
then one of grape leaves (the tannin in the leaves helps 
to preserve tne firmness of the grapes). To 4 quarts of 
vinegar take 2 pints of white sugar, 1 oz. of cinnamon, 
i oz. each of cassia and cloves. Let the vinegar, sugar 
and spices all boil together a few minutes, and, when 
quite cold, pour over the grapes. By pouring the vine- 
gar over the grapes cold you avoid cracking the grapes, 
and they retam their natural form and color as long as 
they last. 

Cucumbers. 
C. M. TF., Hudson, Mich. 
To 1 gallon of soft water add 1 teacup of rock salt ; 
heat it coiling hot ; pour it over your cucumbers j let 
them remain m the brine 24 hours ; turn off the brme ; 
heat it again, and turn on the cucumbers the second 
time, and let them remain another 24 hours ; and again 
the third time, when they will be ready for the cider 
vinegar, which must be poured over them cold ; cover 
them with horse radish leaves to prevent mold rising 
on them ; press them under the vinegar with a heavy

plate, and in a few days they will be ready for use, and 
will keep green and bright all winter. 

S\*'eet Cucumber. 

C. M. TV., Hudson. Mich. 

Take small crock of pickled cucumbers and make a 
good rich sirup of New Orleans molasses, and cider 
vinegar, and whole cloves ; heat together, and turn 
over them, and in 2 day you will have a most delicious, 
brittle, hard, sweet pickle. 

Ripe Cucumber. 
F. C, Chicago. 

Remove the seeds and rinds; slice them an inch 
thick soak them in cold vinegar over night ; drain off 
the vinegar and throw it away. Take 1 gallon of vine- 
gar, 4 pounds of sugar a few sticks of cinnamon bark, 
and in this mixture boil the pieces of cucumbers, re- 
moving each piece as it becomes clear, without being 
broken— some pieces will be done before others, and 
place them in a jar, wiien all are removed to the jar, 
pour the boiling vinegar over them, and keep them 
imder ihe surface. 

Si%'eet <Krape. 
Mrs. J. P. H., Chicago. 

To 8 pounds fruit use 4 pounds sngar and 1 quart of 
vinegar. Place the fruit in jars. Boil and skim the 
sirup, and pour over the grapes boiling hot. Repeat 
this process 3 or 4 days. Then seal up and set in a 
cool, dry place. Boil any kind of spices in the sirup 
that suits the taste. 

Peaches. 
Mrs. Sarah L., Chicago. 

Take to 1 gallon of good cider vinegar 8 pounds of 
cut sugar. Let it dissolve in a large jar. Stick a clove 
into each peach. Put over the fire about a guart of 
the vinegar with the sugar dissolved, and drop m while 
cold 16 peaches, that will just fill a Mason's quart jar. 
Allow the peaches to boil slowly until a fork will stick 
easily through them. Oh, I forgot. You must put in 
a stick of cinnamon and a little allspice and cloves 
tied up in a rag. Xot too much. It makes them black. 
Take out and carefully place in a jar, 1 by 1, fill with 
the liquid and screw on the top. 



COOKERY— PICKLES. 133 

Picalilli. 

Subscriber's Wife, Beloit. 

One peck of green tomatoes, seeded ; 2 large heads 
of cabbage \ 3 green peppers ; a small teacup of salt. 
Chop and mix well, and put in a colander to drain over 
night. In the morning cover it with good cider vine- 
gar, and let it boil until soft. Then drain off that 
vinegar and put in tablespoonful of mustard, 1 of all- 
spice, 1 of cloves ground, 2 pounds of sugar, and about 
i a teacup of horse radish, and 3 onions if you like. 
Cover nicely with cider vinegar, and let it boil a few 
minutes. Put into a stone jar and lay on the top a 
thin white cloth. Put an old plate on to keep it under 
the vinegar. 

Home-lVIade Vinegar. 
Mrs. Sarah L„ Chicago. 

Take 6 gallons good cider; put this into a wine 
cask, and in the spring add 4 gallons of rain water, 1 
gallon of molasses, and 4 pounds of sugar. Tear in 
small pieces a i sheet of brown WTapping paper to 
make '• mother " ; set the cask in the sun, and stick a 
glass bottle in the bung. In making currant jelly, I 
took the rinsings of the currants and poured that in, 
and a few peach-parings and stones, and cherries and 
blackberries, I poured in after soaking a day or so. 
This was the foundation of my vinegar, and that vine- 
gar barrel has been kept working night and day ever 
Bince by adding more cider, more water, molasses and 
sugar. 

Pickled Cabbage. 
Mrs. Mac, Kansas. 

Select a nice, firm head of cabbage ; take off all the 
outside leaves and shave it exceedingly fine (not chop 
it, remember) ; place it in the jar you intend to keep 
it in, sprinkle salt and pepper on it to your taste ; then 
cut a couple of red peppers very fine ; add 2 table- 
spoons celery seed (or it is a great improvement, if 
you can get it, to chop up fine 2 heads of nice celery), 
2 tablespoons white mustard seed; pour over cold 
vinegar enough to cover. 

Cboiv Chow.

i a dozen ripe red peppers ; i pound mustard seed ; i 
pound whole pepper ; 1 pound ground mustard, and, 
as there is nothing so adulterated as ground mustard, 
its better to get it at the druggist's ; 20 or 30 bay 
leaves, and 2 quarts of good cider or wine vinegar. 
Peel the onions, halve the cucumbers, string the beans, 
and cut in pieces the caulitlower. Put all in a wooden 
tray, and sprinkle well with salt. In the morning wash 
and drain thoroughly, and put all into the cold vine- 
gar, except the red peppers. Let boil 20 minutes slow 
ly, frequently turning over. Have wax melted in a 
deepish dish, and, as you fill and cork up, dip into the 
wax. The peppers you can put in to show to the best 
advantage. 

Chili Sauce. 
Mrs. Louisa T., Chicago. 

Take 2 quarts of ripe tomatoes, 4 large onions, and 4 
red peppers. Chop them together ; then add 4 cups of 
vinegar, 3 tablespoons of brown sugar. 2 tablespoons 
of salt, 2 teaspoons each of cloves, ground cinnamon, 

finger, allspice, and nutmeg. Boil all together for 1 
our, and bottle for use after straining through a sieve 
or coarse netting. Is equal to famous Worcestershire. 

Tomato CatHup.

over plates to cool. Flavor, but do not stir. 

Sugar Drops. 

Helen Blazes, Chicago. 
One pound of flour ; f of a pound of sugar ; i pound 
of butter ; 4 eggs ; a gill of rose water ; Dake on but- 
tered paper in a quick oven. This makes 60 drops. 
Cocoannt Drops. 
Busy Bee, Ottumwa, Iowa, 
Peel a cocoanut ; cut in thin slices ; cut these again 
crossways into threads about i an inch long ; add li 
pounds moist brown sugar ; 1 teacup of cold water, 
and the sliced nut ; put into basin and boil i an hour 
over slow tire, stirring frequently to keep from burn- 
ing ; drop a spoonful at a time onto a coarse wet linen 
towel to cool. 

Chocolate Drops. 

Kitten, Warsaw, lU. 
I take 2 cups of sugar (white) to 1 cup of water: 
after it has boiled 5 minutes, remove from the fire and 
place in plate or dish and stir briskly till cool enough 
to shape into balls, after which place out to get cold 
and hard. In the meantime grate i a cake of Baker's 
chocolate, which you place in a plate and put over the 
teakettle to melt, after which process you roll the balls 
in the chocolate, and then place out to harden ; and 
for butter scotch, take 1 cup of molasses, 1 of sugar, 
and a i cup of butter ; boil all together till to a candy.

Candying Orang^e. 

Mrs. H., Ft. Wayne, Ind. 

Peel and quarter them. Make a sirup of 1 pound of 
sugar to a pint of water, and let it boil until it comes 
to the candying point. Dip the oranges into this can- 
died sirup and place them on a sieve to drain. Put 
this sieve over a long, flat dish, which will catch the 
dripping sirup, and let the oranges remain so in a warm 
place until the candied sirup upon them is dry and 
crystalized. 

Molasses Candy. 
Agnes H., Aurora, 111, 

Boil some molasses in a spider until it hardens on 
snow or cold water. When done, stir in soda until 
there is about twice as much of the candy as there was 
of the molasses, and a little lemon extract for flavor- 
ing. Care must be taken that the candy does not burn, 
or it will have a bitter taste. The soda makes it light 
and gives it a grain. Pour on buttered plates to cool. 

[Note— The following recipe, if carefully followed, 
will prove perfectly satisfactory. It alone is worth $5 
to any lover of candy ] : 

Chocolate Caramels. 
Candy Maker, Chicago. 

Take 4 ounces confectioners' chocolate ; put it in a 
copper or iron kettle ; put in a i dipper of water and 
stir over a slow fire until it dissolves ; add more water 
if needed; then add 3 pounds of A sugar; i pint 
cream and i teaspoon ot cream-tartar; put them in 
with the chocolate and stir slow until it comes to a soft 
crack. To try it, dip a spoon in the kettle and then in 
the water. When done, pour in a small dripping pan ; 
grease the pan before putting in. When cool, cut in 
squares to suit yourself. 



COOKERY— YEAST, BAKING POWDER, ETC. 137 



YEAST, BAKIIS^G POWDER. ETC. 



Baking; Powder. 

Mrs. J. B. J., Chicago^ 
IX ounces of tartaric acid, 8 of the best baking 
soda, and 1 quart of flour ; sift 5 or 6 times 
through a fine sieve so as to thoroughly mix the 
ingredients ; always procure the materials from 
a good druggist ; by so doing you have for 50 cents 
what would cost you $1 if you Dought it from a grocer. 
Keep it well corked in a jar ; use the same quantity as 
you would of any other powder. 

Beer or Hop Yeast. 

K.^ Galesburg, lU. 
Put 1 large handful of hops into your yeast-jar, and 1 
large tablespoonful each of dark brown sugar, white 
flour and salt. Pour over these 1 quart of boiling 
water. Stir, and when luke-warm, put in i teacup of 
yeast. One-half teacup of this yeast, strained, will 
make 4 ordinary loaves of bread. 

Hop Yeast. 

Mrs. W. S. G., Chicago. 
Grate 10 large potatoes raw ; have ready 6 quarts of 
strong hop tea boiling ; pour over the potatoes, stir- 
ring constantly, and let it boil a moment or two ; add 
1 coffee cup of salt and sugar each. When milk-warm 
rise with a pint of baker's or home-made yeast. Set in 
a warm place until done working. It will take a day 
or two to finish, but it stops after awhile. 

Potato Yeast. 

Take 12 common-sized potatoes, boil soft and mash 
hot ; pour over 1 pint boiling water ; add 1 pint cold 
water ; strain through a colender ; add 1 teacup su- 
gar, 1 tablespoon salt. When cool add 1 teacup baker's 



138 COOKERY— 3nSCELLANE0US. 

yeast. Set in a warm place (not hot), allow it to rise 
light seveial times (say 4 or 5), and beat down. After 
which place in a glass jar, cover tightly, and set in a 
cool place. Half a teacupful of this is suflScient for 2 
ordinary-sized loaves of bread. This yeast will not 
sour. 

Potato Spongre. 
Mr8. M. E. M., Evamton, lU 
Six potatoes boiled ; mash in a pint of flour ; then 
pour on the boiling potato water to scald it. Stir, and 
let it stand imtil cool. Then add more water and flour 
to make the (quantity you wish ; add a cake of yeast 
soaked. Let it rise until bed-time. Give it a good 
stiiTing, and let it stand until morning, when it is very 
light and ready— 3 cups for coffee-cake, 1 cup and a 
little water for a rye and Indian loaf, the rest for white 
bread and a pan of delicious biscuit. All but the 
coffee-cake are baked before dinner, and only 1 cake of 
yeast used. I use cans which have had tomatoes in 
them to bake the brown bread in. The loaf does not 
have as much crust, and cuts in pretty slices for the 
table. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 

Imitation fl'ax Candles. 

Candle Maker, Chicago. 
XE pound of alum dissolved in warm water to 
each 5 pounds of tallow Melt tallow ; add the 
alum water ; let water pass off in steam ; run

slices, put it into a large-necked bottle, and cover it 
with brandy or wine. As the liquor is used up fill the 
bottle, as the strength is diminished add more peel. 

To Prevent Jars Breaking. 

Mary Moore, Cliicago. 
"V\lien putting in the fruit I set the cold jar on a 
folded cloth wet with cold water ; then fill with the 
boiling-hot fruit. I have never known a jar to break 
when thus treated. 

Canning Corn. 

Aunt Nancy, Joliet, 
Make a salt brine strong enough to bear up an egg ; 
put it in a i barrel or large crock ; then put in the 
whole ears of corn without cooking, just as you husk 
them. When the barrel is full, put a clean white cloth 
next to the corn, then a piece of board fitted to the 
barrel inside, with a stone on it for a weight, just as 
for pickles. ' When you wish to cook the corn you 
must freshen it some, as you do salted pickles. Then 
either shave it off or boil it in the cob, a la summer- 
time. 

Canned Berries. 

Heat slowly to boiling, in a large kettle, after adding 
1 tablespoon sugar to each quart of fruit, and a little 
water to prevent burning on. Let all come to a good 
boil and can quickly. This is a good rule for all kinds 
of fruit.

HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 



To Remove Marble Stains. 

Mrs. Will Kaiem, Chicago. 
Take 2 parts of common soda, 1 part pumice stone, 
and 1 of finely-powdered chalk ; sift through a fine 
sieve, and mix it with w^ater to the consistency of 
paste ; then rub it w^ell over the marble, and the stains 
will be removed. Wash the marble afterwards with 
soap. 

To Clean Silver. 
Kate Somers, Chicago. 
In cleaning silver, do not rub it away with scouring 
materials, but wash in hot water containing a good 

Quantity of concentrated lye , or, if very black, boil 
or some time in soft water with a considerable amount 
of washing-soda added ; then wash in a good suds, 
rinse in clear water, and rub with flannel cloth, or 
better, chamois-skin, and your silver will not often re- 
quire cleaning, but will shine like new for a long time. 

To Clean Oloves. 

Polly Perkins, Chicago. 
Buy 1 quart of gasoline at a lamp store, for 5 cents— 
a druggist would ask 20 cents for the same quantity. 
It will clean 4 pairs beautifully. Pour a small part, 
say an i, into a dry wash-bowl, put in 1 glove and wash 
immediately, just as though it were a soiled handker- 
chief, being careful to rub harder on the most soiled 
spots ; rinse in clean gasoline : squeeze oilt (not WTing), 
and in 10 minutes they will be dry. To remove the 
offensive odor, hang them up to air. 

To Color Kid Gloves. 

3fey— P£flrgg, Ghimgo. 

f^ India ink, dissolved in water and applied evenly with 
f a camePs hair brush, will give a jet black color. A 
i of an ounce of extract of logwood in 2 ounces of 
brandy, will give a lilac ; increase the proportion of 
logwood and a darker color is produced, even nearly 
black. Strong tea gives a handsome brown. 

To Clean Oil Cloths.

nish. Soap is necessary in smoky districts, though it 
can not be used without dulling the colors somewhat. 
If a sponge is used, examine thoroughly for shells; 
they scratch the varnish. The dirt thus removed, re- 
wash the whole with sweet milk and water ; then wipe 
dry. The milk makes the surface smooth ; dirt does 
not catch readily to it ; the oil in the milk tends to 
restore the colors. Gentle friction with an old silk 
handkerchief will give a polish. 

Renovating Fur. 
Reader, Fon du Lac, Wis. 

Take a large tin pan ; put a pint of wheat flour in it ; 
put the cloak in it ; rub it thoroughly with the hands 
imtil the flour looks dark ; tnen if the fur is not white 
enough, rub it again with more clean flour; then rub 
it with pulverized chalk— 5 cents worth is enough. 
This gives it a pearly-white look. It is also good to 
clean Knit nubias. 

To Remove Ink Stains. 
D. M. W., Jacksonville. 

As soon as possible after the ink is spilled on the car- 
pet, dip a clean sponge ir milk, and sponge the ink 
spot, cleansing the sponge again in clean water before 
putting it agam in the milk, so as to avoid smearing 
it ; continue the operation until all the ink is out ; 
then, of course, the milk can be washed out after- 
wards. 

Perhaps every one does not know that the color taken 
out of black goods with acid may be restored by the 
application ot liquid ammonia. 

To Retain Colors. 

H. Y. Z., Outtenburg, Iowa. 
To keep the colors of muslins, calicoes, and ging- 
hams bright for a long time, dissolve a piece of alum 
(the size of a shellbark), for every pint of starch, and 
add to it. This will keep the color bright a long time.

ture, carpets, rugs, etc. : Four oz. ammonia ; 4 oz. 
white castile soap ; 2 oz. alcohol ; 2 oz. glycerine ; 2 oz. 
ether. Cut the soap fine ; dissolve in 1 quart water 
over the fire ; add 4 quarts water. T\^hen nearlv cold, 
add the other ingredients. This will make nearly 8 
quarts, and will cost about 75 cents to make it. It 
must be put in a bottle and stoppered tight. It will 
keep good any length of time. Take a pail of luke- 
warm water, and put in about a teacupf ul of the fluid, 
shake around well in this, and then rinse in plenty ot 
clean water, and iron on wrong side while damp. For 
washing grease from coat-collars, etc., take a little of 
the fluid in a cup of water, apply with a clean rag, and 
wipe well with a second clean rag. It will make wool- 
en look bright and fresh. 

Excellent Paste. 

Hugo, HUlsdale, Mich. 
One ounce of gum tragacanth— select the white 
flakes ; moisten a part of this (as the whole ounce will 
probably be more than you will want at once) with 
warm water ; then reduce its consistencv to suit your 
liking ; if too thin, it will strike through unsized pa- 

§er, and, when dry, will give the reading matter a 
ark and illegible appearance. Should your paste ever 
become dry from exposure, or, as it will in warm 
weather, become sour or moldv, moisten it as from 
time to time it may require with a little good vinegar. 
Glue for Mounting: Ferns, Etc. 
BeUa, Kankakee, IIL 
Five parts gum arable ; 3 parts white sugar ; 2 parts 
starch ; add very little water, and boil, stirring until 
thick and white. 

To Hake an Aeolian Harp. 

Tom Cat, Springfield, 111. 
Of very thin pine make a box 5 inches deep, and 7 
inches wide, and a length just equal to the width ol 
the window in which it is to be placed. Across the 
top, near each end, give a strip of wood 4 inch high 
and i inch thick, for bridges. Into the ends of the box 
insert wooden pins to wind strings around— 2 or 4 pms 
in each end. Make a sounding hole in the middle of 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 

the top, and string the box with blue violin strings. 
The ends of the box should be increased in thickness 
where the pins are inserted by a piece of pine fflued 
upon the inside. It is better to have 4 strings, out a 
single string produces a very sweet melody of notes. 
To Make Black Ink. 
Chemist, Chicago. 
Dissolve in an open vessel 42 ounces of coarsely- 
powdered nut-galls, 15 ounces of gum. Senegal, 18 
ounces sulphate of iron (free from copper), 3 drachms 
aqua ammonia, 24 ounces of alcohol, and 18 quarts of 
rain water. Mix and let it stand until the fluid has 
assumed a deep black color, then bottle. 

To i;*^ash Flannel. 

Harris & Cobb, Chicago. 
After preparing suds of hot water and soap, wash 
the garment thoroughly with the hands (avoiding a 
wash-board or washing machine of any kind). When 
this is done, rinse in warm water containing a slight 
quantity of soap. Slightly TVTing the article thus clean- 
ed and nang it up. Take it down while yet a little 
damp, and iron till perfectly soft and dry. Caution I 
Flannels or woolens of any description should never 
go into water too hot for the hands, or into cold water. 

TT ashing liinen. 

Louise N., Kenwood, IIL 
To wash fine linen so that it will retain its color, 
take as much hay as will color well the amount of 
water you wish to use ; boil and rinse the goods in it, 
using a little soap. Be sure and use this preparation 
for both washing and rinsing. 

To Clean Inf)ant»' Socks, H'orsted Coods, Fnrs, Etc- 

M., aeveland, O. 
Take a pan with a pint of white flour ; rub the arti- 
cle in the flour well ; shake the flour off out of doors ; 
if there are soiled places still, put it in the flour again. 
It takes a good deal ot rubbing with the flour. This 
will clean almost any knitted worsted article in white 
goods ; also white lace ties, and it will clean white furs 
till they look like new. 



146 HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 

1¥ ashing Black Goods, JLinens, Etc. 

Mrs. M. M. P., Chicago. 

The best method of washing black (mourning) cali- 
coes and dark brown cambrics, is to put a pint of 
wheat bran into 4 quarts of cold water ; boil for i an 
hour ; strain into a tub, and add sufficient warai water 
to wash 1 dress. Do not use soap. Kinse, and add 
blueing to your starch to prevent the white appearance 
starch leaves on dark colors. The bran softens the 
water. Wash brown linen in this way, adding a little 
hay to the bran-water while boiling. If there are 
grease spots on the linen use a little soap on them. 
Brown linen should not be dried in the sun. 

Washing Clothes. 

Old Housekeeper, Chicago. 
Red-border napkins will bear boiling with other 
clothing, but scalding is all that is necessary, as, in- 
deed, it is for all of the washing. For the last 12 years 
I have scalded my clothes instead of boiling them. 
Have the clothes washed as cleanly as possible, and 
add no soap for the scald. That in the clothes from 
the suds is all that is necessary. In an ordinary-sized 
wash-boiler of water add 1 tablespoonf ul of ammonia, 
and blueing as desired. Put the clothes in when cold, 
and let them just come to the boil and remove. Rinse 
and dry. The blue put in the scald gives a much 
clearer look than in the rinse, without looking blue. 

To Iron Easily. 

Aunt Nancy, Joliet. 
Put a teaspoonful of kerosene into your cold starch, 
say to a pint, and your iron will not stick. The smell 
will soon pass off ; rub your iron on soap or wax if it is 
rough. 

To Clean £iace Curtains. 
Aunt Nancy, Joliet. 
To clean lace curtains without washing them : Shake 
the lace gently to remove the loose dust ; then spread 
a clean sheet on a table, and lay the curtains 1 above 
the other with a plentiful sprinkling of unsifted corn- 
meal or bran between them. Then roll them up snug- 
ly, and put away in a safe, dry place for a weeK or 10 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 147 

davs ; then shake the bran out, and with a moderately- 
hot iron press out the wrinkles, and your curtains are 
as nice as new. 

To Color BroTrn, Etc. 

Marsh MdUow, Michigan. 

To color brown : For 4 pounds of cloth or yarn, use 
1 pound of cutch and 4 of bichromate potash. Dissolve 
the cutch in sufficient water to cover the goods, and 
boil them for i an hour ; then dissolve the potash and 
dip the goods into the potash solution until the desir- 
ea shade is obtained. 

Scarlet : For cheap bright red suitable for rag car- 
pets, 1 pound of Nicaragua wood ; boil 2 or 3 hours ; 
then add i a pound of alum ; this will color 3 pounds 
of old flannel, or 2 of new. Let it remain in the dye 24 
hours. 

Green for woolen : To 1 pound of yarn or cloth, 2i 
ounces of alum and 1 pound of fustic. Steep to get 
the strength, but not boil ; soak the goods until it ac- 
quires a good yellow color ; then throw out the chips 
and add Indigo compound slowly until you have the 
desired shade. Kinse in cold water. 

Polish for iiinen Cuffs, Etc. 
Aunt Jerusha, Valparaiso, Ind. 

White wax, 3 ounces ; spermaceti, 3 drachms ; borax, 
6 ounces ; gum tragacanth, H ounces. Melt together 
with gentle heat. When you have prepared a sufficient 
quantity of starch in the usukl manner for a dozen 
pieces, put into it a piece of the polish the size of a 
large walnut>— more or less, according to the amount 
of washing. This will make a beautiful polish, and 
also make the goods very stiff. 

IVashing Fluid. 

Housewife, Oconomowoc, Wis. 
Here is a washing fluid I have used 6 years, and 
would not be without it : Take 2 pounds salsoda : dis- 
solve ; take 1 pound unslacked lime ; boil it awhile ; 
then set aside to settle ; drain off, and add water to 
the amount of 2 gallons ; add your salsoda ; set aside 
for use. The night before wash-day, put your clothes 
to soak in warm soap-suds. In the morning put over 



148 HOUSEBOLD HINTS. 

your boiler, and to the boiler t full of water add 1 cup 
of fluid ; wring your clothes from the tub ; boil 15 
minutes; then rub through 1 suds, and rinse. It 
bleaches, but does not rot the clothes. 

Soft Soap. 

Mrs. J. A. Pirie, MQwaukee^ Wis. 
Try out 14 pounds of ^ease ; to this add 10 pounds 
of potash, dissolved in just boiling water enough to 
cover the lumps. In 2 or 3 days pour over the mix- 
ture several pailfuls of boiling water. (Be careful to 
use boiling water, as that cooks it). Keep on adding 
the water as fast as the soap thickens until your bar- 
rel is full of nice, sweet, clean soap. It must be stir- 
red luird every time the water is put into the barrel, 
until it is entirely mixed. 

Hard Soap. 

Soap Maker^ Chicago. 
Take li pounds of clean, melted grease and 1 gallon 
of ley strong enough to bear an egg. Mix them to- 
gether in a barrel and stir until a good soft soap is the 
result. Then take 6 quarts of this soft soap, 1 pint of 
salt, and a i of a pound of resin ; melt and scald the 
ingredients together, and put it aside to cool. "VMien 
hard cut it, turow away the ley that has settled to the 
bottom and melt the soap again to refine it. Pour it 
into a small tub and when hard cut into cakes. 

Idee on Canaries. 

Mary^ Vincaines. 
To exterminate lice from canary birds, use hoUow 
canes for perches ; shake out well mornings into a cup 
of water, and you will catch them all. Two parts 
canary^ part rape, and 1 part hemp seed is the best 
food. The canes used are pipe stems. 

ToKUl Plant liiee. 

Etta, Chicofjo. 

Cigar ashes wiQ kill lice on rose bushes without in- 
juring the plants. I have tried it in many instances 
with great success. 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 149 

Destroying Red Spiders. 

Mrs. W, C. A., LcwisUm, lU. 

Wash the plants once or twice a week in good strong 
soap suds— wash thoroughly every leaf on the under 
side with a sponge. Set the pot in a tub of washing- 
suds moderately warm, and throw the suds over them 
then. 

Plant liice Exterminator. 

Dabbler, Oreen Bay, Wis. 
Steep some quassia in w^ater, and then pour over 
the plant, first washing the leaves with it. It is cer- 
tain death to the lodgers, whether lice or worms. 

Raising: Canary Birds. 

Bird Defender, Hillsdale, Mich. 
Place the cage so that no draft of air can strike the 
bird. Give nothing to healthy birds but rape and 
canary seed, water, cuttle-fish bone, and gravel-paper 
or sand on the floor of the cage. No hemp seed. A 
bath 3 times a week. The room should not be over- 
heated—never above 70 degrees. When shedding 
feathers keep warm, avoid all drafts of air. Give 
plenty of German rape seed ; a little hard-boiled egg, 
mixed with crackers grated fine, is excellent. Feed at 
a certain hour in the morning. For birds that are 
sick, or have lost their song, procure bird tonic at a 
bird store. Very many are guilty of great cruelty in 
regard to perches. The perches in a cage should be 
each one of a different size, and the smallest as large 
as a pipe-stem. If perches are of the right sort, no 
trouble is ever had about the bird's toe-nails growing 
too long. Keep the perches clean. The 14th of Feb- 
ruary is the proper time to place the male and female 
in the same cage. 

£veriastins M'^biitev^'ash. 

Some years ago the following whitewash was used 
on the east end of the White House, and is as good 
to-day as when first applied : Take! bushel of nice 
unslaked lime ; slake it with boiling water ; cover it 
during the process to keep in the steam. Strain the 
liquid through a fine sieve or strainer, and add to it a 
peck of suit, previously well dissolved in warm water 



150 HOUSEBOIiD HINTS. 

3 pounds of ground rice, boiled to a thin paste ; i 
pound of powdered Spanish whiting, and 1 pound of 
clean glue which has been previously dissolved by 
soaking it well, and then hang it over a slow fire in a 
small kettle within a larger one filled with water. Add 
5 gallons of hot water to the mixture, stir it well, and 
let it stand for a few days covered from dust. It should 
he put on hot, and for this purpose it can be kept in a 
kettle on a portable furnace. It is said that about a 
pint of this mixture will cover a square yard upon the 
outside of a house if properly applied. Fine or coarse 
brushes may be used, according to the neatness of the 
job required. It answers as well as oil paint for wood, 
brick, or stone, and is cheaper. It retains its brillian- 
cy for many years. There is nothing of the kind that 
will compare with it, either for inside or outside walls. 
Buildings or fences covered with it will take a much 
longer time to burn than if they were painted with oil 
paint. Coloring matter may be put in and made of 
any shade desired. Spanish brown will make a reddish 
pink, when stirred in, more or less deep, according to 
the quantity. A delicate tinge of this is very pretty 
for inside walls. Finely pulverized common clay, well 
mixed with Spanish brown, makes a reddish stone 
color ; yellow ochre stirred in makes yellow wash, but 
chrome goes further, and makes a color generally es- 
teemed prettier. It is difficult to* make rules, because 
tastes differ. It would be best to try experiments on a 
shingle and let it dry. Green must not oe mixed with 
lime ; it destroys the color, and the color has an effect 
on the whitewash which makes it crack and peeL

This simple recipe not only cleanses the teeth, 
but is a preserva-tive against decay. 
To Whiten and Soften the Hands. 
Mary B., Terre Haute. 
One-half pound of mutton tallow, 1 ounce of cam- 
phor gum. and 1 ounce of glycerine. Melt, and when 
thoroughly mixed, set away to cool. Rub the hands 
with this every night. 

To Remove Freckles.

A very simple and harmless remedy for freckles is 
equal parts of pure glycerine and rosewater, applied 
erery night and allowed to dry. 

To Remove Hair. 

Paul H. B., Madison. 
Quicklime, 30 parts ; orpiment, 4 parts , powdered 
gum arable, 60 parts. Mix and keep in a tightly- 
corked bottle. When used mix with water, so as to 
form a paste. Apply, and let it remain for 5 or 10 
minutes, when the superfluous hair can be removed 
with the back of a knife. The following is a rather 
safe depilatory, and in some respects equal to the for- 
mer : Take a strong solution of sulphuret of barium,

made into a paste with powdered starch. Use as in 
the preceding one. This latter recipe, however, must 
be used immediately after being mixed, as it loses its 
efficiency if kept long. 

To Prevent Hair Turning: Gray. 

Paid H. B., Madison. 
Take the hulls of butternuts, say about 4 ounces, 
and infuse in a quart of water for an hour. Then add 
i an ounce of copperas. Apply with a soft brush every 
second or third day. This preparation is harmless, 
and is far better than those dyes made of nitrate or 
silver. 

To Cure Dandruff. 
Paid H. B., Madison, Wis. 
Dandruff generally comes from an overheated or 
feverish state of the scalp. The cure is simple. Brush 
it well every day ; apply a mixture of bay rum and 
brandy ; avoid much oiling, and wash quite often with 
an egg and soft, tepid water. 

French Cnrlique. 

Paid H. B., Madison, TFwt. 
Oil of sweet almonds, 1 oimce; spermacetti, 1 
drachm ; tincture of mastich, 3 drachms. Dissolve the 
spermacetti (white wax is as good) in the oil with a 
slow heat, and then add the tincture. Apply a small 
quantity when the hair is to be dressed. This prepa- 
ration is entirely innocent. 

Hints About the Hair. 

Paul H. B., Madison, Wis. 

The yolk of an egg will thoroughly cleanse the scalp 
and make the hair soft and glossy— that is, if soft 
water be used. Beware of soap, for the potash it con- 
tains is very objectionable. 

At least 20 minutes each day should be used by those 
who suffer from thin and weak hair in brushing it 
with a stiff brush. Before beginning this, apply every 
day a small quantity of the following : Tincture of can- 
tharides, i ounce ; bay rum and cologne, of each 2 
ounces ; and 1 drachm of oil of rosemary. Do this for 
a month, and the hair will be found to have improved 
wonderfully. Ladies who have, and do not like, red 



THE TOILET. 153 

or blonde hair, will find their hair has grown much 
darker. The weak hairs, by this process, grow strong- 
er, and the coarse ones fall out, causing the hair to 
become healthy and curly. The following method will 
cause bright red liair to "become dark brown, or chest- 
nut-hued : Take oils of nutmeg and rosemary, 1 drachm 
each ; castor oil, 1 ounce ; tincture of cantharides, 2 
drachms; strong brandy, 7 ounces. Mix. Wet the 
hair with a small portion of this once a day, and brush 
the Iiair well with a stiff brush for i an hour by the 
clock, and ask your lover at the end of 5 or 6 weeks if 
he does not want a fresh lock of your new hair. This 
everyday brushing of the hair is worth more than all 
the '^ curling fluids " and other like humbugs ever in- 
vented. 

Care of the Hair. 

When the hair grows scantily, naturally, the follow- 
ing lotion may be used 3 or 4 times a week, in the 
morning : Eau-de-Colonge, 2 ounces ; tincture of can- 
tharides, 2 ounces ; oil of rosemary and oil of lavender, 
of each 10 drops. When the hair becomes thin from 
illness, or other causes, use the following recipe : Mix 
ecjual parts of olive oil and spirits of rosemary ; add a 
few drops of oil of nutmeg, and anoint the head very 
sparingly before going to bed. When actual baldness 
is commencing, use the following pomade : Macerate 
a drachm of powdered cantharides in an ounce of 
spirits of wine. Shake it well during a fortnight and 
then filter. Take 10 parts of this tincture and rub it 
with 90 parts of cold lard. Add a little essence of 
bergamot, or any other scent. Rub this pomade well 
into the head flight and morning. In 99 cases out of a 
100 this application, if continued, will restore the hair. 
When the hair, after being naturally luxuriant, be- 
gins to grow thin^se the following recipe : Take of 
extract of yellow Peruvian bark, 15 grains •. extract of 
rhatany root, 8 grains ; extract of burdock root, and 
oil of nutmenjs (mixed), of each 2 drachms; camphor 
dissolved with spirits of wine, 15 grains ; beef marrow, 
2 ounces; best olive oil, 1 ounce; citron juice, i a 
drachm ; aromatic essential oil, as much as sufficient 
to render it fragrant; mix; sliake into an ointment. 
Two drachms of bergamot, and a few drops of otto 



154 THE TOILET. 

of roses would suffice. This is to be used every 
morning. 

To Make the Hair Orow. 

Mrs. Will KiXLem, Chicago. 
Salt and water will not only prevent the hair from 
falling out, but if applied every day will bring out a 
fine growth of soft new hair. Should not be made so 
strong as to leave white particles upon the hair when 
dry. 

For Itchins i$calp. 

Mrs. Eve, Kalamazoo. 
One teaspoonful of ammonia, 1 of tincture of arnica, 
and 1 tablespoonf ul of soft water. Use this amount 
for 1 thorough sponging and rubbing of your head, 
and brush till dry. If badly diseased, use twice a 
week. Prepare just what you want for one applica- 
tion each time. 

For Diseased Scalp. 

Aunt NeUy Bly, St. Joe, Mich. 

Buy 25 cents' worth of pine-tar ; take 2 tablespoon- 
fuls and put in an old quart bowl , pour on this 1 pint 
of boiling soft water ; let stand till cool ; remove the 
scum, and pour off in a bottle and cork, and use thor- 
oughly every morning to wet the hair and scaip. It 
will surely cure you. My husband has used this for 
2 years, and now his han- is thick and soft, and has 
hardly a gray hair; besides, the scalp is clean and 
healthy. Keep your tar-bowl always filled with water, 
and pour off when needed ; put in a little more tar 
every 2 months or so. 

All About Preserving and Improvins the Com- 
plexion. 

Paul H. J3., Madison, Wis. 
All the so-called "Balms," "Blooms of Youth," 
etc., are composed of white lead, glycerine and rose- 
water. For a time such preparations do seem to 
whiten the skin, but in a short time it loses its elastic- 
ity from paralysis of the small nerves, and becomes of 
a dirty, yellowish color. This invariably is the result 
of the application of all the cosmetics containing lead. 



THE TOILET. 155 

Still, there are a number of harmless articles which 
can be used as cosmetics, such as milk of roses, lac 
sulphur, glycerine, bay rum, bitter almonds, oatmeal 
water, and, if a mineral must be used, let it be sub- 
nitrate of bismuth. A few years ago the following 
sold in Paris for $5 a bottle : Pure glycerine and water, 
of each an ounce ; vinegar of cantharides, 40 drops. 
The cantharides slowly destroys the rough, outer skin, 
and leaves the under soft and velvety. Madame Ves- 
tris used to sleep with her face done up in a mixture 
of the whites of eggs, sweet almond oil, and alum. 
This keeps the skin soft, but firm, and retards wrink- 
les. Gowland's Lotion is an excellent preservative of 
the complexion, and is made of 1 ounce of emulsion of 
bitter almonds, and li grains of bi-chloride of mercury. 
If this be applied once a day, on retiring, and the face 
washed in tepid water, on rising, with the following 
soap, no lady need have a pooi: complexion long. The 
soap is made as follows : A pound of bleached castile 
soap, 4 ounces of fresh, sweet almond oil, 6 ounces of 
oatmeal. Place on the stove in a kettle, and keep 
stirring until all the ingredients are well incorporated. 
Then let it cool, and it is ready for use. The high- 
born ladies of England are noted for the beauty and 
whiteness of their hands. They use the soap above 
given. Glycerine is capable of making the skin soft, 
but it will not whiten it any. The following is the 
recipe for " Sultana," a deservedly-popular cosmetic 
with the titled ladies of London : Take 2 ounces of 
bitter almonds, blanche, and beat into a paste with 1 
ounce of rosewater; then add honey, fine oatmeal, 
and glycerine, 1 ounce each, and when well mixed, 2 
drachms of tincture of benzoin. Apply before a fire a 
short time before retiring. For rendering the com- 

Elexion soft, smooth, and brilliant, this preparation 
as no superior. The following is good, and has the 
merit of being more easily prepared than the '' Sul- 
tana." It is me French pate au miel, or honey paste : 
Take glycerine, honey, and rosewater, 2 ounces ; sub- 
nitrate of bismuth, 4 drachms, and tincture of benzoin, 
2 drachms. This is to be applied at night, and can 
also be used in the morning instead of soap. 
And now for that torment of so many fair females— 



156 THE TOILET. 

freckles. In many females of a sanguine tempera- 
ment, freckles, even if removed for a time, will be 
sure to return, and, therefore, may be said to be in- 
curable. But in 9 out of every 10 cases the following 
will effect a cure : In the morning on rising, take a 
teaspoonful of lac-sulphur in a few teaspoonfuls of 
milk. Then, for external use, apply the following : 
Corrosive sublimate, 4 grains ; alcoliol, 1 ounce. Mix. 
Kemember, ladies, that this latter mixture ought not 
to come in contact with the lips. After a few days' 
using, the skin will begin to very slowly peel off, and 
the freckles disappear. Twice daily is sufficient to 
apply it. A French dermatologist recommends the 
following for the same purpose : Take muriatic acid, 
i ounce : alcohol, 1 ounce ; rain water, 7 ounces. Mix 
and apply well with a sponge 3 times daily. When in 
England, a Gypsy woman informed me that she used 
horseradish, boiled in milk, for removing freckles. 
She cured a number of young girls, but whether or 
not she told me the real secret of the means employed, 
I am unable to say, having never given the preparation 
a trial. 

Cold. Cream. 

Helen Blazes, Chicago. 

Take an ounce of rosew^ater ; 2 ounces of oil of sweet 
almonds ; i an ounce of spermacetti ; 1 drachm of 
white wax ; melt together in a bowl placed in a pan of 
water, boiling. Then remove from the fire, and stir 
until cold. 

For those who prefer " something easier '" : One 
ounce glycerine : 1 ounce rosewater ; 10 drops carbolic 
acid. This is a liealing lotion, excellent for sore gums 
as well as " chaps " — and other excoriations. 

Bla«k-lieads, Flesh-Trorms, Etc.

They are permanently removed by washing with 
warm w^ater, and severe friction with a towel, and 
then applying a little of the following preparation : 
Liquor of potassa, 1 ounce ; cologne, 2 ounces ; white 
brandy, 4 ounces. The warm water and friction are 
sometimes sufficient.

Care of the Hands. 

Paul n. B., Madison, Wis. 

What is called cream of roses is also an excellent 
preparation for the hands, either in winter or summer, 
it is made as follows, unless you prefer to purchase it 
at a SI a bottle : Take compound tincture of benzoin, 
i an ounce ; almond and Malaga oil, of each an ounce ; 
ottar of roses, 5 drops ; honey, 2 ounces ; and enough 
rosewater to make the mixture measure 6 ounces. Ap- 
ply as often as you like. 

A mixture of lemon-juice and powdered borax is also 
another fine whitener of the skm, but shoula only be 
used in warm weather. This is admirably suited to 
those ladies whose general health is not good and who 
have, consequently, bluish hands, in which the blue 
veins show too strongly. 

Ladies who do their own housework are apt, if they 
do not wear gloves, to havp coarse hands. If they 
happen to dip them into w^atcr, thej^ do not take time 
enough to dry them well before going on with their 
work. To wipe the hands perfectly dry after their be- 
ing immersed in water, is imperatively necessary, if 
they wish their hands to look white. To keep the 
hands from chapping in cold weather, use a mixture 
of glycerine, 1 ounce ; spermacetti, 2 drachms ; olive 
oil, 2 ounces. Mix together with the aid of heat. Ap- 
ply this every night, and, if time will admit of it, 
every morning. In winter, do not wash them in cold 
or hot water. It should be just blood warm, and no 
more or less. Do not go out of doors with them un- 
covered. In summer, use cold water, unless the hands 
perspire very much, as the hands of some people do. 
These latter should use tepid water. In warm weather, 
a good preparation for the hands is this : Take i an 
ounce of powdered alum, the whites of 2 eggs, and mix 
together. Then add enough bran to make into a thick 
paste. Apply this once a day, after washing, and after 
rubbing the hands together well for a few minutes, 
wipe off with a soft towel. This will give them a soft, 
brilliant hue, and check any undue amount of pers- 
piration.

Bands for Children. 

S., Chicago. 
If the bowel complaint should become troublesome, 
keep a flannel band bound snugly around through all 
the not weather. It supports the bowels, keeps them 
warm, and will often cure the trouble when medicine 
and diet have been of no avail.

Drinks for Invalids. 

Annie M. Hale, Chicago. 
Take crusts of genuine brown bread (rye and Indian). 
These should be slowly toasted before an open fire un- 
til thoroughly dried and of a rich, dark brown. Break 
them into small bits ; put th6m into the coffee pot ; 
pour on boiling water, and let the infusion steep from 
i an hour to an hour. Let the pot stand a few min- 
utes after being removed from the fire. The coffee 
will be clear and of a fine color, and if served with 
rich milk or cream, can hardly fail to please an un- 
spoiled palate. It is nutritious and innocent. A 
tablespoonful of ground Mocha or Java put in the 
coffee pot 10 minutes before it is taken from the fire 
will give it both flavor and aroma. The crusts of 
whatever bread may be used in a similar manner. 

Corns, Bunions, and Ingrroivins Xails. 

A Friend, NormaU lU. 
Acetic acid is a safe and painless remedy for corns 
and bunions. A fe.w applications night and morning 
will dispel all soreness. A continued application will 
remove them. Inverted toe-nails can be cured with- 
out causing any pain, by simply making a notch in the 
center of the end of the toe-nail in shape of the letter 
V. It causes the sides of the nail to come above and 
over the flesh. Continue this as fast as the nail grows 
out, and it will always keep its proper shape and 
posits" on. 

How to Ci^et Fat. 

Mrs. Sophia F., Chicago, 
If you will try my recipe I think you will succeed in 
getting fat. I drink every day at 10 a. m. and at bed- 
time a glass of lager beer with eggs. It is prepared in 
the following manner : Take the yolk of 1 e^f^ and 4 
teaspoontuls ot white granulated sugar ; beat well and 
fill the glass with beer. It is an agreeable drink, and 
will make any one what I am now getting to be— fat.
