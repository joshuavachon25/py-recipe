PREFACE 

The Commissary School established at the Naval Train- 
ing Station, Newport, Khode Island, is for the purpose of 
qualifying men for the various ratings of the commissary 
branch. 

The present capacity of the school is as follows: Com- 
missary stewards class, 30; ship's class, 130; and bakers 
class, 80. The length of the course of instruction in each 
class is four months. 

Candidates for the rate of commissary steward must be 
ship's cooks, first class, or bakers, first class, and recom- 
mended by their commanding officer to the Bureau of 
Navigation for a course of instruction in the Commissary 
School. On arrival at the school they are given an oral 
examination to determine their qualifications. They are 
then given lectures and practical work in the general duties 
of a commissary steward, the navy rations, the organization 
of the general mess, the routine of the commissary depart- 
ment, placing the commissary department in and out of 
commission, accounting, dietary principles, provisions, the 
menu and the efficiency in the commissary department. 
The course of instruction is divided into four grades or 
classes; the time required to complete each grade is about 
four weeks. A new class is started on the first of each 
month and men who are in the waiting class are admitted 
to the first grade. Students received during the month are 
placed in the waiting class. Before advancing from one 
grade to another, students are required to pass a satis- 
factory examination. Monthly reports of fitness are made 
of each student and after completing the course he is given 

ivilG044:3

a written examination and, if found qualified, is recom- 
mended for the rating of conmiissary steward and sent to 
general service. 

Candidates for the rate of ship^s cook are enlisted in 
the rating of ship's cook, third or fourth class, or landsman. 
On arrival at the Training Station they are given one 
month of military training before being transferred to the 
Commissary School. On entering they are given an oral 
examination to determine their knowledge of cooking and 
butchering. They are then given lectures and practical 
work in the experimental galley. The practical work con- 
sists of butchering and the preparation and cooking of the 
different foodstuffs. Lectures cover the personnel of the 
commissary department, the general duties of a ship's cook, 
cooking, preparation of dishes, beverages, carving, the 
daily bill of fare, dietary principles and efl&ciency in the 
galley. After satisfactorily completing the course, they 
are rated according to their ability as ship's cooks, third 
or fourth class, and sent to general service. 

Candidates for the rate of baker are enlisted as baker, 
second class, or landsman, and receive the same military 
training as ship's cooks. On entering the school they are 
given an oral examination and lectures and practical work. 
The practical work consists of making bread and pastry. 
The lectures cover the personnel of the commissary depart- 
ment, general duties of a baker in the navy, dietary prin- 
ciples, materiais, baking wheat bread and other breads, 
cakes, past/y, aesserts, efficiency in the bake shop and 
adverse conditions. After satisfactorily completing the 
course they are rated baker, second class, and sent to gen-

METHODS OF COOKING 

The cooking of foodstuffs for the proper nutrition of the 
human body while necessary to some articles of food is 
riot necessary to all articles. Foods are cooked for various 
reasons ; for instance, to render mastication easy by soften- 
ing the tissues and fibers of meats and vegetables, to facili- 
tate and aid digestion, to eliminate certain foreign para- 
sites, such as tinea of tapeworm in beef and mutton, 
trichina in pork and the ptomain poisons of decayed tis- 
sues, especially in fish. 

The actual cooking of food should not be confounded 
with the preparation of dishes of food; as there are only 
about eight methods of cooking, while in the preparation 
of dishes the methods are almost countless. 

Whatever method is used in the cooking of food the 
results are the same, the only difference obtained being the 
flavors produced by the method employed. For example: 
It would be impossible to obtain the flavor of roast beef by 
boiling it, yet as far as the eupeptic properties of the meat 
go they would be the same cooked by either method, as 
both methods soften the tissues and fibers, and aside from 
the individual flavors obtained by the manner of cooking 
there would be but little difference. 

Whether meats are roasted, boiled or fried it is our ob- 
ject to retain as much as possible of the nutritive and 
flavoring extracts in the meats, and this result can be 
obtained only by using the proper tempefatlft€s. The 



6'': .•• •. ;: :tf.:S: Navy Cook Book 

• \ .' : • ^ 

meats should, first be ^subjected to a high temperature, as 
'. tQT'ffiiS/Kieitis 'tlie pores of the meat are quickly closed and 
'the alUuinih nearest to the surface of the meat is coagulated ; 
then the temperature is reduced to enable the heat to 
slowly penetrate to the center of the meat, thus cooking it 
through; then the temperature again reduced and con- 
tinued until the cooking has become complete. 

ROASTING AND BROILING 

Both these forms of cooking are practically the same 
and consist of exposing the meats to the action of the heat 
from an open fire. In roasting, the meats are continually 
turned while in the process of cooking, this turning being 
accomplished by means of a mechanical device known as a 
roasting jack; but this form of cooking meats is practiced 
very little outside of the larger hotels. However, a similar 
result may be obtained if the meat is broiled, whereby it is 
placed in a broiler and held over a very hot, clear fire and 
allowed to remain until the Surface has become seared 
and the pores of the meat have become closed; the meat 
should then be turned and the other side treated in the same 
manner. The meat is then moved further from the heat 
when the cooking is continued until done. 

The broiler should be clean, well heated, and greased 
before using. As salt applied to raw meat tends to toughen 
the fibers, it should not be applied to the meat until it is 
very nearly cooked. 

BAKING 

The practice of baking meats is much more general than 
roasting or broiling, and when meats ga^eby^operly baked 



TJ. S. Navy Cook Book 7 

they have a flavor ahnost as good as that produced before 
the open fire. The meat should first be cut into pieces of 
desired size, then wiped with a damp cloth and placed in 
a baking pan, into which small pieces of fat, or some drip- 
pings, have previously been placed. The oven should have 
a temperature of at least 450° F., then the meat placed 
within and allowed to remain for at least 30 minutes. At 
the end of this time the meat has become well seared (or 
browned), and in the meanwhile should have been turned 
and basted with the fats in the bottom of the pan. The 
temperature of the oven should then be reduced to about 
350° F., the meat seasoned with salt and pepper, and a 
small quantity of stock or water poured over it. The meat . 
should then be turned and baited frequently until it has 
finished cooking. Whether the meat has been thoroughly 
cooked or not, may be determined by the color of the juices 
that flow from it when it is cut; this juice should be of a 
dark wine color. 

BOILING AND SIMMERING 

These are two methods of cooking that are simply the 
result of the temperature used, and the principle is identi- 
cal with that of roasting with the exception that the 
flavor of roasted meat is lacking; however, meats may be 
boiled and be just as juicy and tender as meats that have 
been roasted, if proper attention is given to the process. 
In the first place, we must obtain the maximum tem- 
perature of 212° F. (or boiling), the meats should be as 
near as possible all of one size, placed in the boiling water, 
and allowed to remain for at least 30 minutes; then the 
heat should be reduced until the water but simmers. This 

Digitized by Vj U<jy I tT 



8 TJ. S. Navy Cook Book 

simmering should be continued until the toeats have be- 
come tender. Boiling should never be allowed to take place 
after the meat has been in the water for the first 30 minutes, 
as the continued boiling would serve to toughen the fibers 
of the meat and spoil the flavor near its surface. Season 
at the end of the first 30-minute period. The process of 
simmering should be strictly adhered to in order that 
proper results may be obtained when meats are cooked by 
boiling. The proper temperature for simmering is about 
180° F. Serve the meat with a good sauce. 

FRYING AND SAUT^INQ 

Prying consists of completely submerging the article to 
be cooked in deep fat or oil. The fat should always be at 
the boiling point, otherwise the food would absorb the fat 
and produce a very indigestible article. It must be kept 
in mind that fat at a boiling heat does not bubble, but re- 
mains perfectly still with a thin, blue vapor rising from its 
surface, and this thin, blue vapor must not be confounded 
with the thick, dark-colored smoke that arises from burn- 
ing fats. Poods cooked by frying are usually first coated 
with beaten egg and then covered with bread- or cracker- 
crumbs, which is, indeed, a very good method, serving as 
it does to retain the juices of the meats. The articles to 
be fried should be placed within the hot fat in very small 
quantities or their entrance would serve to cool the fat 
below the desirable temperature and thus cause the food 
to absorb the fat. 

Care should be taken that the fat does not burn, as fat 
that reaches this temperature imdergoes a chemical change 
and is split up into fatty acids and glycerine; and from 

Digitized by Vj U<jy I tT 



U. S. Navy Cook Boor 9 

glycerine is produced a substance called acrolein which has 
a very irritating effect upon the mucous membrane ; hence, 
the disfavor in which fried food is held. 

Unlike frying, sauteing is a method of cooking food in 
only enough fat to keep the article from sticking to the pan 
in which it is being cooked. The pan should be well heated 
and then a small quantity of fat or oil put in it, then the 
article should be placed in it and quickly seared on both 
sides, the temperature then reduced and the article allowed 
to finish cooking. The article should never be completely 
cooked on one side as this method would serve to drive out 
all the juices of the meat, making it tough and tasteless. 

BRAISING 

This manner of cooking comprises, three distinct 
methods: First, the meats, with a small quantity of fats, 
are placed within a closed vessel or braising pan and al- 
lowed to remain there imtil the meats have become thor- 
oughly brown; then flavoring herbs and vegetables are 
added. The whole is then cooled for about 15 minutes, 
after being well dredged with flour; then sufficient water 
or stock to half cover the meat is added. The temperature 
is then sufficiently reduced to allow the article to simmer 
for about 3 or four hours, or until tender. Thus we have 
the three distinct methods which comprise sauteing, steam- 
ing and simmering, obtaining the flavor of roast meat with 
the tenderness produced by the prolonged steaming and 
simmering. Tough meats may be treated in this way with 
a marked tenderness resulting. In braising meats they 
should at all times be kept tightly covered in order that the 
steam may be retained in the vessel. r^^^^i

STEAMING 

This is a process useful in cooking puddings, etc. It 
has no advantages over boiling such articles of food. The 
steam merely tends to keep the article dry while cooking. 
Such articles may be steamed in an ordinary pot or copper 
by placing a small quantity of water in the bottom of such 
receptacles and inverting a pan over the water, then placing 
the article to be cooked upon the inverted pan. The water 
should be replaced as it boils away until the article is 
cooked.

THE PREPARATION OF SOUP STOCK 

Strictly speaking, soups should be regarded more as a 
stimulant than as a food, composed, as they are, chiefly of 
water combined with flavoring juices of meats, herbs and 
vegetables. Soups are divided into two classes: clear and 
thick. In the latter, such materials as are rich in carbo- 
hydrates are used, as beans, peas, rice, lentils and starch, 
and in this class of soups the caloric value is greatly in- 
creased, so that practically the main function of soups is 
that of a stimulant. They excite the salivary glands, caus- 
ing a copious flow of saliva and gastric juices, which mate- 
rial is very necessary to the proper digestion of the more 
solid foods. 

The basis of all soups is commonly known as stock, which 
is simply a combination of water, the flavoring juices of 
meats, vegetables and spices, together with a small per- 
centage of the nutritive principles contained in meats. 
When meats that are used in the preparation of stock are 
white (such as chicken and veal) the stock is known as 
white stock and is used in the preparation of soup that is 
required to be of a light color. Stocks required for light or 
brown soup may be prepared from any kind of meats, 
cooked or raw. All stocks are prepared in the same man- 
ner, with one object in view, namely: to extract as much 
as is possible of the flavoring and nutritive juices of the 
materials used. The flavoring juices are readily extracted 
by the process of long and slow cookiif^.'^'^^yTfri^^yjooking 



12 U. S. Navy Cook Book 

should take place at a temperature of less than 160® F., 
as the nutritive juices are of an albuminous nature and wil] 
coagulate at a temperature above 160° F., after which il 
becomes insoluble in water. To illustrate the meaning 
more fully, we may take a bowl of cold water and mix the 
water with the white of an egg ; it will be noticed that noj 
change takes place with the exception that the liquid turns 
a little opaque. But if the water should be boiling and then 
the egg mixed with it, we see a decided change. ThQ 
albumin immediately becomes coagulated and it is thei^ 
impossible to bring it back to a liquid state. That should 
teach us that in order to extract the greater amount of the 
nutritive principles, it is necessary to keep the temperature 
of the water in which the meats are cooking as low as pos- 
sible for some considerable time to facilitate the dissiolving 
of the albumen. 

Aside from the flavoring and nutritive extracts from the 
meats, we have the flavors of herbs, vegetables and spices, 
These, combined with various minerals and salts, tend to 
produce palatable stock. Great care should be exercised in 
the use of these vegetables and herbs, as each has a dis- 
tinctive flavor and no one flavor should be allowed to pre- 
dominate over the others, but all should blend to produce 
a palatable flavor. 

Nothing is more nauseating than the excessive use ol 
bay-leaves or strong turnips in a soup, as they will pre- 
dominate over the natural flavor of the meats; the lattei 
flavor being much desired in a properly prepared soup 
stock. 

The following rules may be found useful in the prepara- 
tion of soup stocks : 



U. S. Navy Cook Book 13 

2. Bones should be broken and the large joints cut with 
cleaver. 

3. Vegetables should be cleaned, washed and cut into 
halves. 

4. Spices should be placed in a muslin bag. 

Meats, bones and vegetables should be placed in cold 
water and allowed to remain so for 30 minutes, then the heat 
applied slowly and kept near, but below, 160° F. for some 
time, then more heat applied until the simmering point is 
reached. The simmering should be allowed to continue 
without ceasing for at least 5 hours. The spices should be 
cooked for 1 hour and then removed. The fats should be 
removed and the stock strained, and then it is ready for 
use in the preparation of soups. The stock should never 
be allowed to boil. 

The following is a summary of ingredients needed for 
the preparation of soup stock for 100 men : 

Bones and soup meats 25 lbs. 

Carrots 2 

Onions 4 

Parsley i 

Celery ^ 

Leeks ^ 

Cloves 12 No. 

Whole peppers i oz. 

Mace i " 

SuflBcient water to make 12 gals, of stock. 

In consideration of the fact that the amount of soup pre- 
pared for a number of men depends somewhat on the 
amount of other dishes that will be served in the dinner, 
the quantity of soup must, of course, be lowered where the 



14 U. S. Navy Cook Book 

quantity of the other part of the meal is raised; however, 
the following recipes are given : 

MACARONI SOUP 

12 gals, stock 12 egg yolks 

4 lbs. macaroni Salt and pepper to taste 

Break the macaroni into 2-inch lengths. Place in boil- 
ing salted water and cook for 20 minutes, then remove and 
add it to the stock and cook it for 15 minutes. Beat the 
egg yolks and add them gradually to some of the soup, then 
mix the whole amount together 5 minutes before serving. 

NOODLE SOUP 

12 gals, stock 12 egg yolks 

4 lbs. noodles Salt and pepper to taste 

Prepare in the same manner as the previous recipe. 

VERMICELLI SOUP 

12 gals, stock 12 egg yolks 

5 lbs. vermicelli Salt and pepper to taste

U. S. Navy Cook Book 15 

gieatly improved if the vegetables are slightly saut6d in 
hot butter or fat. Prepare as for soup stock. After remov- 
ing the bones from the stock, the tomatoes are added and 
cooked for 1 hour longer. Thicken with the flour and serve. 

ENGLISH BEEF SOUP 

Use the same ingredients as for vegetable soup, except 
that 4 pounds of pearl barley are substituted for the flour, 
also that small pieces of the soup meat may be served in the 
soup. The barley should first be soaked in cold water for 
30 minutes and then either boiled separately or in the soup. 
If boiled separately, the liquid should be added to the soup. 

SCOTCH BROTH 

12 gals, stock 2 lbs. carrots 

•J oz. thyme 2 lbs. turnips 

5 lbs. pearl barley 1 lb. leeks or onions 

This soup is best prepared from the stock of boiled 
mutton. Strain the stock and add the barley and vegeta- 
bles, and then simmer until the barley is soft. Season with 
the thyme, and salt and pepper as required. (This soup 
may be slightly thickened with flour.) 

ONION SOUP 

12 gals, stock 3 lbs. milk 

10 lbs. onions . 5 lbs. bread for 

4 lbs. flour croutons

Just before serving, the croutons are added. A little 
chopped parsley greatly improves the appearance and flavor 
of this soup. 

CREAM OF CELERY SOUP 

12 gals, stock 3 lbs. milk 

5 lbs. celery 5 lbs. bread for 

5 lbs. flour croutons 

Wash the celery well and separate the whitest parts. 
Cook the remainder in the stock until tender. Eeraove the 
celery and strain the stock. Dice the white parts of the 
celery and boil them in salted water until they are tender ; 
then prepare a white roux, with which thicken the soup ; 
add the diced celery, and bring to a boil. Add the milk, 
season, and just before serving add the croutons. 

RICE AND TOMATO SOUP 

10 gals, stock 4 lbs. rice 

10 lbs. tomatoes 5 lbs. onions

being cut into long, thin strings may be used, such as 
carrots, cabbage, turnips, onions, etc. 

BEAN SOUP 

12 gals, ham stock or water 5 lbs. onions 

3 gals, beans 12 lbs. tomatoes 

In preparing this soup the beans should first be soaked 
in cold water for about two hours, then the water removed 
and replaced with fresh water, and the beans allowed to boil 
slowly. In ihe meantime, cut the onions into small slices 
and add them to the soup with some ham stock or ham 
bones. Cook all together until the beans are well broken. 
One hour before serving, the tomatoes should be added; 
the ham bones should be removed after a slight boiling. 

DRIED PEA SOUP 

12 gals, ham stock or water 5 lbs. carrots 
15 lbs. peas 5 lbs. bread or 

5 lbs. onions croutons 

Prepare in the same manner as for bean soup, estimating 
the quantity of tomatoes needed. A few carrots improve 
the flavor of this soup.

HOW TO CLEAR STOCK 

The clearing of soup stock for consomme may be accom- 
plished by careful preparation. Stock may be cleared 
without trouble if the following directions are adhered to : 
Keep the stock continually simmering, but do not allow to 
boil. Use a stock pot if available, whereby the stock may 
be drawn off through a spigot and strained through a 
flannel cloth; but as this method cannot be used where a 
ship is in motion, the following directions are given: 

Chop fine, some lean beef, add 2 egg whites together with 
the shells of same to every pound of meat; and after the 
stock has cooled, add this to it, mix well and gradually bring 
to a boil ; then reduce the temperature and allow to simmer 
slowly for about 30 minutes; strain through a fine cloth. 
The liquid thus produced is called consomme, and may be 
drunk either hot or cold, and is used in the preparation of 
the following soups : 

CONSOMME ROYAL 

12 gals, cleared stock (consomme^ 24 egg yolks 

Mix the well-beaten yolks with a little more than their 
bulk of milk, season, and pour into a pan 1 or 2 inches deep ; 
then place in a second pan containing boiling water and 
bake in a moderate oven until firm ; cut into half -inch dice, 
add to the consomm6 and then serve. ^ i

reserve the stock. Dice the salt pork or bacon and place 
in the pan with a little water and fry until the meat becomes 
slightly brown; then add the onions, finely chopped, and 
cook for 5 minutes; add the flour and stir well. Remove 
from the fire and add to the potato stock and simmer 
slowly. If soft-shell clams are used the bellies are removed 
and the tough parts are added io the potato stock together 
with the liquid, onions and meat, and allowed to simmer 
for 30 minutes. Fifteen minutes before serving add the 
potatoes, clam bellies, seasoning, and pepper and salt, and 
a small pinch of thyme. If the clams ar tough they should 
be finely chopped and cooked for 30 minutes in the stock. 
This chowder may be greatly improved if the milk is added 
just before serving. Tomatoes may or may not be used 
with this chowder.

FISH DISHES 

Great care should be taken to see that fish to be used for 
food are fresh. The best way to determine this is by the 
firmness of the flesh, the brightness of the eye and the 
bright red color of the .gills. 

The most common methods of cooking are boiling, bak- 
ing and frying. Large fish are generally boiled, medium- 
sized are baked or broiled and the smaller ones are fried. 
Extremely large ones, such as cod, haddock and halibut, are 
usually cut into steaks and then fried. When boiling fish 
the flavor may be greatly improved by adding vinegar, salt, 
bay-leaves, whole peppers, parsley, onions, or a few slices 
of lemon to the water. 

Fish for baking should be well cleaned and scaled and 
have fins and tails removed. A prepared dressing of stale 
bread, well seasoned with butter and sage, onions, pepper, 
salt and any other aromatic herbs that may be fancied 
should be placed in the fish. The fish should then be placed 
in well-greased baking pans and have a little melted butter 
or fat poured over it, then covered with bread-crumbs or 
cracker dust, and a few slices of bacon or salt pork laid on 
the top of it. The addition of tomatoes and a few slices of 
onion will improve the fish. 

FRIED FISH 

60 lbs. fish 4 lbs. flour 

8 eggs Bread-crumbs or cracker dust 

Clean and scale the fish, wash well in cold water, then 
^^ain and dip it in dry flour, then in well-beaten eggs, and

lastly in bread-crumbs. Allow it to stand for 10 minutes 
and then fry in deep, hot fat. 

FISH FRIED IN BATTER 

60 lbs. fish 4 lbs. flour 

4 eggs 3 oz. baking powder 

Clean as before, and then prepare a frying batter from the 
flour, eggs and baking powder, seasoned with salt. Dip the 
fish into the batter and then fry in deep, hot fat. 

FISH FRITTERS 

25 lbs. fish 8 eggs 

10 lbs. flour 2 lbs. milk 

8 oz. baking powder 

Cold boiled fish or salt cod may be used for these fritters. 
If using salt fish it must first be well freshened and then 
picked apart and added to a batter composed of the follow- 
ing: Flour, egg, milk and baking powder. When using 
cold boiled fish salt will be necessary. Mix well and fry as 
ordinary fritters in hot fat. 

CANNED SALMON FRITTERS 

25 lbs. salmon 8 oz. baking powder 

10 lbs. flour 2 lbs. milk 

Prepare the batter as above and season with salt and 
pepper ; drain off the liquor, break the fish in small pieces

MEATS 

ROAST BEEF 

Cut 80 pounds ribs of beef into 6-pound pieces; wipe 
dry. Place in roasting pans and rub in as much flour all 
over as the meat will hold, letting a little of the flour drop 
over the bottom of the pan. Place dots of drippings over 
the top of the roast, using about 4 tablespoonfuls in all. 
Place pan in the oven and let alone for 25 minutes or until 
browned nicely. Then draw out the pan and pour in about 
3 cupfuls of boiling water. Baste the meat all over, place 
back in the oven and close drafts, reducing the temperature 
of the oven to a very moderate heat. Baste every 10 or 15 
minutes. When nearly done season with salt and pepper; 
baste again. You cannot baste the meat too often. Figure 
about 13 minutes to the pound to cook the meat. The first 
intense heat of the oven sears the meat, retaining the juices. 
Reducing the heat cooks th^. inside without further scorch- 
ing the surface. 

When meat is done, remove from pan. Set pan on top of 
the range, add a little hot water and stir well to detach all 
the particles of flour that have adhered to tlie pan. Boil 
and stir for 4 or 5 minutes, then strain into a gravy dish. 
Skim off all fat which you keep for drippings. 

The practice of adding flour to the roasting pan, to burn 
and thicken the gravy, and with burned, bitter tasting 
sugar, should be discouraged. No more thickening is really 
required than the stray particles of flour which fell from 



U. S. Navy Cook Book 29 

the meat when first started to roast. These have cooked 
well and brow'ned during the time of roasting. 

BRAISED BEEF 

56 lbs. beef 4 bay-leaves 

2 lbs. salt pork 12 cloves 

2 lbs. carrots Celery tops 

2 lbs. turnips 3 lbs. onions 

Flour 

The kind of meat best for this purpose is round, vein 
and shoulder-clods. Cut the fat pork 3 inches long and 
i inch square ; dice the vegetables. Cut the meat in about 
8-pound pieces, take a steel and punch a hole parallel with 
the grain of tlie meat and insert one of the lardons of pork, 
continue this until all the pork is used. Place a baking 
pan on top of the range, put remaining scraps of salt pork 
together with some beef drippings in the bottom of the pan, 
allow to become hot, then add the beef which has been pre- 
viously well dredged with flour, allow to become well 
browned, then add the diced vegetables and cook for 20 
minutes, then add the stock or water to fill the pan, invert 
another pan to prevent escape of steam and finish cookinix 
in the oven, turning the basting the meat frequently; this 
process of braising may be carried out in the same manner 
by using the steam coppers. Eemove the fat from the liquid, 
strain, season and serve.

butter. In cooking large quantities of steak the first cooked 
should be rather rare. Steak may be cooked on top of the 
range, first wiping oflE the plates and well greasing with 
fat; in cooking steak in this manner it may be left in large 
pieces and cut later. 

BROILED STEAK

pounds of chopped corned beef and 5 pounds of chopped 
onions ; season with salt and pepper ; place in a well-greased 
baking pan, smooth over the top, baste with beef drippings, 
bake brown in the oven. This hash may be fried and 
browned on both sides in a frying pan on the top of the 
range. 

BOILED CORNED BEEF 

Wash 75 pounds of corned beef, place in the copper in 
cold water and bring to a boil. If the stock is too salty, 
renew the water and let boil slowly or simmer for about 
3 hours. 

FRESH BEEF HASH 

Peel and cut into cubes 70 pounds of potatoes, cook in 
copper until almost done, then drain. Cut 25 pounds of 
meat into small cubes. Have 5 pounds of partly fried 
onions in 4 pans, add the meat and potatoes to them, 
season with salt and pepper, and saute on the range until 
brown. 

BEEF CROQUETTES

cooked mashed potatoes, mix well, let cool, shape, ?ind pro- 
ceed as for beef croquettes. Fry in deep, hot fat. 

FRIED BEEF LIVER 

Wash, skin and remove sinew from 45 pounds of liver. 
Cut into slices about ^ inch thick, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, dip in plenty of flour and fry in a little hot fat until 
well browned. Cooking liver too long makes it hard and 
tough. I If bacon is to be served with the liver, use only 
40 pounds of liver and add 10 pounds of bacon. This dish 
should be served with a good onion gravy. 

VEAL CUTLETS 

Take 60 pounds of veal cutlets, cut thin. Sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, clip in flour, then in beaten eggs, then in 
bread-crumbs. Fry in deep, hot fat until a golden brown.

CORNED BEEF FRIED IN BATTER 

Slice cold corned beef in J-inch slices, dip in good batter 
and fry quickly in deep, hot fat, then serve with tomato 
sauce. 

RISSOLES AND CROQUETTES OF CORNED BEEF 

Gut the cold corned beef in 2-inch cubes, place in black 
pans and sauU in hot oven, drain off the liquid, then brown 
some salt pork (cut in small dice) on the range, add some 
chopped onions, then add sufficient flour to absorb all the 
fat; reduce this roux with the liquid from some tinned 
peas and the strained liquid from the corned beef, season 
with thyme, pepper and a little salt, then add some parsley, 
and cooked diced potatoes ; add the peas to the meat, pour 
on the sauce, cover with a good biscuit paste and bake in 
a good oven. The addition of canned tomatoes greatly 
improves the dish. 

BOILED SALT PORK (NAVY) 

Remove the pork from the barrels and cut off the fat> 
allowing only about i inch to remain on the lean (return 
the fat to the barrels and reserve for other use) ; place the 
pork in cold water to soak all night. When ready to cook 
place the pork in the copper with plenty of cold water, 
allow to come very slowly to a boil, then repeat the process 
twice more, and the last time allow to remain simmering 
until tender. 

FRIED SALT PORK 

After the pork has soaked all night and has been par- 
boiled, it may be cut in slices and fried on the range, in this 
case it is advisable to allow a little more fat to remain. A

U. S, Navy Cook Book 43 

brown gravy may be made by frying some onions in a pan, 
after the pork has cooked, then add flour and reduce with 
water. 

BOILED HAM 

Ham should be placed in cold water to soak over night, 
then washed off and placed in the copper with plenty of cold 
water (if very salty bring very slowly to a boil and remove 
the water once or twice), then bring to a boil, simmer 
slowly until the small bone in the hock can be easily removed. 
This process will take about 4 hours. A better way is to 
allow the hams to boil about 2 hours, then turn off the steam 
and cover tight and allow the hams to finish cooking and 
cooling at the same time in their own liquid, this will be in 
about 4 hours more. This method produces a very juicy 
ham. 

FRIED SMOKED HAM 

Take 65 pounds of ham, wipe clean and trim the hams. 
Cut into thin slices, place in pan or copper of cold water 
(just enough to cover the ham), bring water to a boil and 
strain off. Put as many pans as necessary on the range and 
cover the bottom with clean grease, fry ham slowly until 
brown on both sides, season with pepper and serve with 
fried eggs or with fried potatoes (omitting eggs), or with 
fried hominy, or it can be served with creamed potatoes. 
Compressed ham can be used in place of smoked ham, in 
which case it is not necessary to bring the ham to a boil, 
and use only 35 pounds of ham. 

BAKED SPICED HAM 

Take hams that have not been boiled too much^ remove 
the skin and stick whole cloves in the faf fliichSapart, then

dust with cinnamon, sprinkle with powdered sugar and 
fine bread-crumbs, and bake in a good oven, basting with 
fat in pan. The addition of a few sliced onions in the pan 
improves the flavor. 

TINNED HAM 

Canned ham for use should be prepared in this manner : 
Remove the hams from the cans, break apart, place in 
black pans and bake in a good hot oven, removing the fat 
and liquid from time to time. In this manner, the ham will 
be browned and will have the flavor of fried ham. 

FRIED BACON 

The bacon may be sliced in thin slices, then placed in cold 
water and allowed to come to a slow boil, drain off all the 
water and fry on top of the range. Bacon should not be 
cooked too much, for it has a tendency to dry out after 
cooking. 

SMOKED TONGUE 

Tongues should be soaked in cold water over night, then 
cooked in the same way as ham ; when done the small bone 
in the root may be detached and the skin should be removed. 
As with ham, tongues are greatly improved by allowing 
them to cool off in the liquid in which they were cooked.

out in cold water, wiped dry and all the pin feathers re- 
moved ; then cut off the tips of the wings, feet at the knee- 
joints, cut off head at the end of the neck, remove crop, 
remove the oil sack, cut around the vent, make a cut across 
the belly, and remove the entrails, taking care not to break 
the gall sack, trim off the liver, gizzard and heart, wash the 
chicken or turkey. All poultry should be singed to remove 
the fine hair.

over, wash well, removing all decayed or unripe parts; let 
them stand in cold water for some time before using. 
Always have the water boiling before putting them in it. 
Young or summer vegetables do not require as much cook- 
ing as old ones*. All green vegetables should be cooked 
uncovered. Potatoes may be boiled in cold or hot water. 
If vegetables, such as beets, turnips and cabbage, are very 
old and tough, a little bicarbonate of soda cooked in the 
water with them will help the cooking. All dried vegetables 
should be allowed to soak in cold water for some time 
before using. 

BOILED POTATOES 

Pare and eye the potatoes and boil in slightly salted 
water ; when cooled, drain off half the water, place a little 
butter on top of the potatoes, drain off the remainder of the 
water and pour over two or three times, finally drain off 
the water, then allow the potatoes to steam. 

PEELED BAKED POTATOES 

Prepare potatoes as for boiling, cut large ones in half,

THICKENING AGENTS AND SAUCES 

The use of sauces for meats, vegetables and certain des- 
serts is required to give flavor to what may be otherwise a 
tasteless dish. In cooking, certain cuts of meats, owing to 
their toughness, usually require prolonged cooking and if 
it were not for the sauce served with them they would be 
exceedingly unpalatable and tasteless. A number of sauces 
are thick, and about the consistency of good cream. There 
are several methods of producing this condition by means 
of the following preparations : 

WHITE ROUX 

White roux may be prepared from either butter fats, or 
oil; when prepared from the latter we, of course, do not 
obtain the individual flavor of butter, consequently the roux 
is not rich. Take equal quantities of good drippings and 
sieve in the flour, stirring continually until the mass be- 
comes firm, care must be taken that it does not become 
brown. 

BROWN ROUX 

Prepare in the same manner as white roux, using* one- 
fourth more drippings. Heat the drippings to a frying 
point, then sieve in the flour, stirring continually until the 
desired color has been obtained, care must be taken that the 
heat is not too intense or the flour will not brown evenly.

56 U. S. Navy Cook Book 

FLOUR 

In using flour as a medium for thickening sauces, stews, 
etc., care must be taken that it has been worked perfectly 
smooth ; sieve the flour in the pan, then make a large hole 
in the center of the flour, place the cold water in the center 
and with a spoon or wire, stir or whip the water in rotation, 
the water will gradually absorb the flour, producing a 
smooth paste. 

CORNSTARCH 

This article is used where a clear, transparent sauce is 
required, it is prepared in the same manner as flour. 

BROWN SAUCE 

Eeduce a brown roux with stock, fry a few onions, add to 
the sauce and simmer for 30 minutes, then strain and 
season with salt and pepper. 

WHITE SAUCE 

Reduce a good white roux with some good white stock, 
chop or grind a few onions, add to the sauce, allow to 
simmer for 30 minutes, then strain, season with salt and 
pepper and a small piece of butter. 

CREAM SAUCE 

Reduce a white roux with boiling milk to the desired 
(onsistency, "season with salt, pepper and butter, finish with 
a little cream. 

CAPER SAUCE 

Prepare a good white sauce, add whole capers or finely 
tlioj)ped pickles ; if capers are used a small quantity of the 

Digitized by VjCXJ*^ ItT 



TJ. S. Navy Cook Book 57 

taragon vinegar may be added. The stock from the boiling 
mutton may be used in preparing the white roux. 

ONION SAUCE 

Prepare a thick cream sauce, slice up tfie onions and boil 
separately, when cooked tender add to the cream sauce, 
season with butter, salt and pepper. 

CELERY SAUCE 

Boil the tops and roots of celery in some good stock, 
when tender mash and strain, thicken the liquid with a 
white roux,* take the tender white parts of celery, dice in 
small pieces and boil, when tender add to the sauce, season 
with butter, pepper and salt. 

HORSERADISH SAUCE 

Prepare a good white sauce, add sufficient grated horse- 
radish to flavor well. 

CUSTARD SAUCE 

Heat some water to a boiling point, then thicken well 
with cornstarch, beat some eggs well, together with some 
sugar, milk and vanilla extract ; when the thickened water 
has cooled off well, add the mixture, allow to come almost 
to a boiling point, but do not allow to boil, then serve. 

VANILLA SAUCE 

Prepare in the same manner as custard sauce, flavoring 
well with vanilla extract 

Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



58 U. S. Navy Cook Book 

TINNED FRUIT SAUCE 

Take the syrup from tinned fruit, add suflBcient sugar to 
sweeten, add a little lemon peel and then add an equal 
quantity of water, bring to a boil, then thicken with corn- 
starch, boil for 10 minutes, then serve. 

CHOCOLATE SAUCE 

Bring some water to a boil, mix well together sufficient 
cornstarch and enough cocoa to give a light brown color, 
add to the boiling water, cook 10 minutes, then allow to 
cool off. Beat well together some eggs, flavor with vanilla, 
add to the liquid, heat and serve. 

HARD SAUCE 

Cream some butter with the hand with twice the amount 
of powdered sugar ; when soft as thick cream, add flavoring 
of nutmeg and some well-beaten whites of eggs, beat well 
together with an egg-whip and set aside in the refrigerator 
to become hard. 

GOLDEN SAUCE 

Prepare a hard sauce, then substitute yolks of eggs for 
the white and mix, omit nutmeg, using a flavoring of 
vanilla. 

The following sauces are suitable for service with the 
articles mentioned: 

Roast Meats. — Brown sauce, tomato sauce, onion sauce.

8 oz. baking powder 


12 eggs 


4 lbs. milk 





Sift the flour, baking powder and salt well together, re- 
duce the milk with water, beat the eggs light, add the milk 
to the flour, then add the eggs. Care should be taken in 
mixing all kinds of batter containing baking powder, as the 
more it is worked the greater the loss of the gas from the 
baking powder. Griddle cakes of all descriptions should be 
cooked on a well-greased and hot griddle on the top of the 
range. The top of the range may be well cleaned and the 
cakes cooked on the plates, pieces of fat pork or such thing 
being the mest medium for doing this.

OYSTER DRESSING FOR POULTRY 

8 lbs. stale bread or crumbs 1 lb. parsley 
2 qts. oysters J lb. butter 

6 eggs Salt and pepper 

Strain the oysters, remove all shells and place the liquid 
on the fire, allow to come to a boil, remove the scum and 
strain over the bread. Beat the eggs well and add to the 
bread, then add the parsley, salt, pepper and melted butter 
and oysters. Mix and stuff the poultry, or it may be baked 
in greased pans. 

SWEET POTATO DRESSING FOR POULTRY 

Prepare in the same manner as for oyster dressing. Sub- 
stitute sweet potatoes cut in small pieces and use 5 pounds 
of bread instead of 8 pounds, 

STUFFED GREEN PEPPERS 

Green peppers may be stuffed with any meat croquette 
preparation or may be stuffed with a mixture of boiled rice 
and chopped meat. The peppers should be cut through the 
center and all seeds removed. Tlie stalks may be trimmed 
off and if desired they may be blanched in boiled water, 
boiling for 5 minutes. This removes the necessity of being 
too long in the oven, and also removes some of the heat of 
the pepper. After blanching they should be stuffed with the 
preparation, a little cracker- or bread-crumbs placed on the 
top, then place in baking pans and brown well in the oven, 
basting frequently with a little milk or butter.

BREAD AND PASTRY 

FLOUR 

Flour should be stored at a temperature ranging from 
65 degrees to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. It should be neither 
too cold nor to warm. It is best to place it in bakeshop a 
few days before using. 

WATER 

The temperature at which a dough is to be made, as well 
as the amount of yeast used, depends a great deal. upon the 
quality of water — hard water requiring more yeast than 
soft water. In normal conditions the temperature of the 
dough should be 84 degrees Fahrenheit. 

SALT 

Salt retards fermentation, and the lightness of the loaf 
depends upon the amount of salt used. 8 to 10 ounces 
of salt is the proper amount for a 10-quart pail of water. 
The amount used depends upon other ingredients, such as 
sugar, lard, oil, etc., added to the dough. 

A good quantity of salt and yeast will make a better loaf 
and flavor than where less salt is used; it is well to use a 
little more salt in hot weather to prevent a possibility of 
sour bread. 

FLAVOR 

A cool dough with plenty of salt and yeast will make a 
highly flavored loaf of bread. The lack of flavor to the 

Digitized by VjUijy It: 



74 U. S. Navy Cook Book 

bread is usually caused by letting the dough get too old 
or setting it too warm, as well as not using enough salt. 

KEEPING OF YEAST 

Immediately upon receiving yeast it should be stored im 
a cool, dry place, but should be kept from freezing. 

YIELD 

100 pounds of flour will absorb from 25 to 32 quarts of 
water, depending upon the quality of flour used. The yield 
of bread to the 100 pounds of flour averages approximately 
from 140 to 150 one-pound loaves. 

TEMPERATURE 

The temperature of the dough should be regulated ac- 
cording to the temperature of the bakeshop, ranging from 
74 degrees to 84 degrees Fahrenheit. If the flour is cool, 
the water should be a little warmer than usual, but if the 
flour is warm the water should be cool in proportion. 

BREAD DOUGH (SPONGE SYSTEM) 

70 lbs. 14 oz. flour ' 1 lb. lard 

1 lb. sugar 10 oz. yeast 

1 lb. salt 19 qts. water 

Set sponge, using all of the yeast, one-half of the water 
(lukewarm) and about three-sevenths of the flour, after 
this is well mixed set aside and dust well with flour, allow 
to rise until it has been up and dropped back 1 inch from 
the top, time 3 to 3^ hours, the sponge is then ready for 
douerhinff. Add the remaining water, which should be 

° Digitized by VjUUy It: 



U. S. Navy Cook Book 75 

regulated to temperature, that is, it should not be as warm 
as used for sponge, next add salt, sugar and lard, all this 
should be well mixed and sponge well broken up before 
adding remainder of flour, then add remaining flour and 
mix the whole thoroughly ; after mixing allow to rise until 
it will recede to the touch of the hand, time about IJ hours ; 
lay over and let rise for about 30 to 45 minutes more ; it is 
then ready to be scaled into loaves. 

NEW FLOUR 

When using a new grade of flour always make it a point 
as to the amount of water a hundred pounds will absorb so 
as to regulate the stiffness of your dough. 

In cold weather always store flour for immediate use in a 
warm place. 

Sponges and doughs should always be well mixed, as a 
poorly mixed dough never gives good results. 

Use as little flour as possible in forming loaves. 

Always weigh all ingredients carefully, especially the salt. 

Never dissolve yeast in water more than lukewarm, as 
hot water will kill the yeast. 

Always be careful not to let bread proof too much, as an 
overproof loaf will show a coarse grain. 

If you have not developed the touch of the dough, a good 
way is to put it in the oven when it becomes proofed to 
twice its original size. 

The proper heat for baking is 400 degrees Fahrenheit, 
this heat is used for most all bread baking; time about 
46 minutes.

board, pull the cloth up enough between each loaf to prevent 
them from sticking together. Allow to rest until double in 
size, then bake in medium hot oven. Before putting in 
oven (top down) wash with a little milk, also put 3 or 4 
slanting cuts on top of loaf, for this operation always use 
a sharp knife. If part milk is used, deduct 3 ounces of 
sugar and 2 ounces of lard for each quart of milk used in 
place of water. If there is not a brick hearth in your oven, 
turn a sheet pan upside down, wipe clean and dust lightly 
with flour, lay bread or rolls on this and bake.
