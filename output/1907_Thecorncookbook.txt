PREFACE 




N compiling this little Corn Cook Book, my 
chief aim has been to awaken a greater in- 
terest among the housekeepers and cooks of 
this country in the Food Value of Corn and 
Corn Products. I have therefore created 
some new recipes, revised many old ones, 
formerly used in New England by our forefathers and else- 
where in the United States. 

Personally, I have for years been very much interested in 
the preparation of this most valuable cereal. Regardless of the 
fact that corn is a native of America and is grown in every state 
in the Union, and some of the foods prepared from it are known 
as our "National dishes," many of our young American house- 
wives of today do not seem to appreciate its true value as a 
"human food." That corn is not used by the modern house- 
wife as extensively as it should be, is doubtless due to the preju- 
dice existing among many people against cooking corn, owang 
to the time involved and its heating qualities. , Others insisting 
that it is only to be eaten in cold weather. This is all a grave 
error. This cereal must be well cooked ; long slow cooking im- 
proves its flavor, and increases its digestibility. The process 
of milling corn in this century is vastly different from the 
"old or Southern Milled Corn," the germ and hull, or crude 
fibre, is all removed. The former was the great "heat producer," 
and too, when left in the meal lessened its keeping qualities. 
The meal would become rancid and infested with vermin. As it 



is milled today all of this is eliminated. Coming in contact 
with thousands of housewives in my professional life, I have 
learned of this lack of interest in the cooking of cereals, and 
especially corn or hominy. 

Fully realizing the positive need of a more wide-spread 
knowledge of its food value and preparation, I set to work to 
wTite the "Corn Cook Book," when to my delight the "Na- 
tional Corn Exposition" came into existence. The Corn Kitchen 
was. assigned to my care and management and of course the 
Corn Cook Book, must needs be completed. I have therefore 
spent months experimenting w^ith the corn products, making 
the new creations, testing the old recipes, which had been sent 
to me from East, West, North and South, especially East and 
South, hoping that I might awaken the "old time" interest in 
its use. Corn pone with crisp bacon, hominy and fried salt pork 
are just as toothsome today as they were years ago. The Phila- 
delphia Scrapple and Pannhaus, both old-time Pennsylvania 
dishes, Boston brown bread, etc., are appetizing, inexpensive 
and wholesome foods, and many others too numerous to mention 
here. 

The story of the origin of corn, its cultivation, milling com- 
mercial and food value, is most attractively told by the United 
States Department of Agriculture in "Farmers' Bulletin No. 
298," "Food Value of Corn and' Corn Products." This bulletin 
should be found in every home in this country; it was a great 
inspiration to me. 

I have endeavored to incorporate in this little book the 
simple, inexpensive and substantial dishes, some of the richer 
creations, then the more delicate custards, creams, etc., finally 
trying to exhaust the possibilities of sweet green corn, closing 
the little volume with Corn Balls and Popcorn Brittle. In 



arranging this compilation of delectable dishes, I trust I have 
succeeded in giving to the housewives, into whose hands this 
book may fall, some valuable information, as well as many 
simple, wholesome dishes, which will aid her in giving variety 
to the daily menus, also supplying a food which ranks in food 
value with wheat, at the lowest possible cost. 

To the housewives and cooks of America (the greatest corn 
growing country in the world), I most graciously dedicate this 
little volume, "The Corn Cook Book." 

Faithfully yours, 
Mrs. Elizabeth O. Hiller. 



HOW TO MEASURE INGREDIENTS. 

It is absolutely necessary to measure all ingredients correctly 
to insure success in cooking. 

Satisfactory results have been attained, occasionally, by those 
of long experience and good judgment in measuring by sight; 
but when failures are made, discouragement follows and, too, 
habits of wastefulness are acquired by this "hit or miss" method. 
The majority of people need a definite system of measurements 
which, when carefully followed, must yield good results. Gran- 
ite, glass and tin measuring cups, divided in thirds and quarters, 
holding one-half pint, table and teaspoons of regulation size, a 
common case knife, all of which may be purchased at any 
kitchen furnishing store, are ^mong the essential articles for 
measuring correctly. Flour, meal, powdered sugar, soda, mus- 
tard, ginger, baking powder, and all ingredients which stand in 
boxes, settle and sometimes harden in lumps, should- be crushed 
and sifted before measuring. A cupful is a half-pint cup filled, 
and leveled with a knife. 

TO FILL A MEASURING CUP. A TABLE OR 
TEASPOON. 

Toss the dry ingredients lightly into a measuring cup, heap 
it slightly, and level it with a knife. Shortening, such as but- 
ter, lard and other fats, are packed solidly into both cup and 
spoon, and leveled with a knife. A tablespoon is measured 
level. A teaspoon is- measured level. 

In measuring with either tea or tablespoon, dip the spoon 
into the material, fill it, lift, and level with a case knife, turn- 
ing sharp edge of blade toward handle of spoon. Divide with 
the knife, lengthwise of bowl of spoon for a half, divide the 
half crosswise for a quarter and the quarter crosswise for an 
eighth. When less than an eighth is called for use a few 
grains. A tablespoon of correct size should hold three level 
teaspoons. A teaspoon should hold sixty drops of liquid. 



Measuring Liquids. 

A cup of liquid is an even cupful or all the cup will hold. 
Tablespoon and teaspoonful is all the spoon will hold. When 
the following ingredients are called for in a recipe, measure 
the dry, fats and liquids in the order given, thereby making 
one cup serve the purpose of all. 

To Combine Mixtures. 

Use an earthen mixing bowl of ample size for mixing cakes, 
batters and doughs. Mix with a wooden spoon. Measure all 
ingredients correctly; mix and sift the flour, baking powder, 
spices, etc., before measuring. 

Count out the desired number of eggs, selecting those of 
uniform size, especially if a cake is to be made. Break each 
egg separately over a cup; that there may be no loss should a 
stale one chance to be one of the number. 

Separate the whites from the yolks when so specified. Eggs 
are beaten three degrees of lightness. They are ''slightly 
beaten" when whites and yolks, beaten together, will run from 
the tines of a fork. They are ''lightly beaten,"- when beaten 
thick, very light and a lemon tint. 

Whites are beaten alone stifiE and dry. 

Measure butter and liquid as suggested in the foregoing. 
Having everything in readiness, the mixing and baking of 
these mixtures may be quickly done. 

TIMELY SUGGESTIONS. 

Milk should always be scalded over hot water. Water 
should be boiling rapidly when cooking corn meal. Pearl or 
Granulated Hominy. The water should be seasoned before 
adding the meal. 

Long, slow cooking developes the flavor of corn meal or 
hominy. 

If prepared for slicing cold or for frying, pour mixture 
into a granite pan previously wet with cold water,, set aside 
until cold and solid. 



Turn out on a moulding board and cut in half inch slices, 
saute in hot, well greased spider or griddle. 

Tin or Russia pans, if used for this purpose, will rust or 
darken the porridge. 

MOTIONS USED IN MIXING INGREDIENTS. 

' Three motions are considered in mixing batters, doughs 
and. other ingredients, namely: stirring, beating, cutting and 
folding. 

STIRRING, is a rotary motion ordinarily used in all cook- 
ery. It is to thoroughly mix the ingredients. 

BEATING, is turning the ingredients over and over to 
thoroughly mix, and at the same time incorporating air into 
the mixture. With each beating motion the spoon is brought 
constantly in contact with the bottom of the dish, bringing the 
contents over the top folding them in again. Beating is used 
in combination with stirring. 

CUTTING and FOLDING, is introducing one ingre- 
dient into a mixture, one or the other being the lighter of the 
two. This is accomplished with the cake spoon, making vertical 
cuts downward and turning mixture over, allowing the bowl 
of the spoon to bring the contents of the bottom of the dish 
over the top then folding them in again. The spoon turns 
entirely around in one's hand in making this motion. Repeat 
this motion alternately with beating until mixtures are 
thoroughly blended. Lightly beaten whites of eggs are cut and 
folded into cake mixtures, etc. 

NOTE. 

THE FOREGOING INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE CAREFULLY FOL- 
LOWED; THE INGREDIENTS CALLED FOR IN THE RECIPES 
MUST BE USED, IF YOU. WOULD HAVE SUCCESS IN USING 
THE RECIPES INCORPORATED IN THIS LITTLE BOOK.

PART I 



'Aye, the Corn, the Golden Corn, 

Within whose yellow heart there is 
Of life and strength for all the nation!' 



HASTY PUDDING. 

(Corn Meal Mush.) 

Put one quart of boiling water in top of the double boiler, 
add one and one-half teaspoons salt, mix two cups yellow or 
white corn meal, and one tablespoon flour, with two cups of 
cold milk, stir this slowly into the boiling water, boil five min- 
utes, stirring constantly, then place vessel over hot water, let 
cook an hour or two, stirring occasionally to prevent mush from 
lumping. The longer it steams the more delicious the flavor, 
serve with milk or cream. If white and yellow corn meal is 
made into "Hasty Pudding" in separate vessels, then packed in 
alternate layers in a brick-shaped mold, then sliced cold and 
served with cream, it makes a very attractive dish. 

FRIED HASTY PUDDING. 

(Corn Meal Mush.) 

Prepare as corn meal mush; pack solidly in a wet granite 
brick-shaped bread pan; when cold, cut in three-quarter inch 
slices ; either dip in flour and fry in hot fat or fry without dip- 
ping; brown richly on one side, then turn and brown on the 
other. These slices may be dipped in egg and fine cracker 
crumbs, and fried in deep, hot fat. Serve with crisp bacon. 

11 



CORN MEAL "DABS" OR DODGERS. 

2 cups fine white corn meal J-2 teaspoon salt 

1 tablespoon sugar 3 tablespoons rich milk 

2 eggs Boiling water

ficient boiling water to wet the meal, but not to make it soft ; 
add butter and milk ; when cold add the yolks, beaten very light ; 
then cut and fold in the whites beaten stiff. The batter should 
drop readily from the spoon, but not thin enough to pour nor 
stiff enough to be scraped from the bowl. Shape in oval cakes, 
and lay in a hissing, hot, well-greased dripping pan, and bake in 
a very hot oven until brown and puffed ; split, butter and serve 
with fried salt pork with cream sauce.

from a large spoon, pat to one half inch thickness, cook slowly 
until well browned, put a small bit of butter on top of each 
cake, turn and brown on top side. Add more fat to griddle 
if necessary. It will do them no harm to cook a long time, 
if they are not allowed to scorch. Serve, when thoroughly 
cooked, with butter and Syrup. 

CORN DODGERS. 

1 quart corn meal 1 teaspoon salt 

2 tablespoons maple sugar or 2 tablespoons lard 

syrup Scalded milk and water

CORN PONE. 

To one quart of white corn meal (southern milled) add 
one and one-half teaspoons salt, one tablespoon melted lard, 
and sufficient scalded milk and boiling water (equal parts) to 
make a mixture that can be molded with^the hands into oblong 
cakes six inches long, three inches wide and one inch thick; 
they should be thin on the edges and ends. Before molding 
them the mixture should be worked well with the hands, then 
shape cakes, place them on a hot well greased tin sheet, brush over 
with melted butter or milk and bake twenty-five minutes in a 
hot oven. When done, split each one, butter and lay a thin 
slice or two of crisp bacon on each. Serve immediately.

then cut in squares, dipped in flour, egg and crumbs, and fried 
in deep fat. Serve with tomato sauce. 



MUSHROOM SAUCE FOR POLENTA. 

Slice six mushrooms (if dried mushrooms are used soak them 
several hours in cold water), chop fine one small onion and one 
clove of garlic. Cook mushrooms, onion and garlic in one 
half cup butter, until a gold brown, add one-half cup brown 
stock or hot water in which one teaspoon beef extract is melted,

on range, bring to boiling point and add buckwheat flour, 
■mixed wnth one cup of corn meal ; remove the casing from 
sausage, break into small pieces and add to porridge, stirring 
constantly that mixture may be smooth; add remaining corn 
meal slowly, continue stirring; season to taste with salt and 
pepper. 

Remove pot to back of range and simmer two hours. Pour

halves. Put ft into stock pot and cover with boiling water; 

15 



cook until meat falls from the bones. Remove the meat, 
strain the liquor and set aside to cool ; remove most of the 
fat, all gristle and bones; chop meat fine. Remove fat from 
liquor, place on range, bring to boiling point, add meat and 
one pound of beef liver, previously parboiled ten minutes, and 
cut in very small pieces; season with salt, pepper and sage 
to taste. Add one cup of buckwheat, mixed with one cup of 
cornmeal, letting it slip through the fingers of the left hand 
while you stir briskly with the right; thicken with cornmeal 
until mixture is the consistency of corn meal mush ; stir until 
free from lumps. Remove to back of range and simmer two or 
three hours. Use a heavy vessel to cook the mixture in. This 
lessens the danger of scorching. 

Pour mixture into brick shaped bread pans previously wet 
with cold water. When cold, cut in half-inch slices and saute' 
in a well greased hot spider; brown on both sides. Serve for 
breakfast or luncheon. This is an inexpensive dish, and is 
highly nutritious, and will keep several weeks in cold weather. 

HULLED CORN. 

Tie a quart of hard wood ashes (oak ashes are preferable) 
in a flannelette bag, and put it in a large kettle, add three 
gallons of cold water. Let it boil and become lye. When 
the right stage of boiling has been reached water will look 
black. 

Put into this four quarts of hard yellow or white corn, and 
boil until the hulls have all started to loosen. Stir it well with 
a wooden mush paddle, then pour it into a large dishpan of 
cold water and rub with the hands thoroughly to loosen and 
remove all the hulls. Change the water six times, washing 
and rubbing the kernels until they are white and clean. 

Soak in cold water over night; in the morning drain, add 
fresh cold water to cover; and simmer four hours or until 
corn Is tender; skim off hulls and scum from water when 
necessary, and add freshly boiled water as It evaporates during 
simmering; drain and serve hot or cold with pepper, salt and 
butter, or with cream and sugar.

See how every kernel of corn is neatly cut open 
and all the nourishing, sweet, milky meat deftly 
removed, leaving behind every bit of the irritat-

grow^n goes through this marvelous patent pro-

What toothsome fritters this makes — and what delicious pud-

Physicians frown on ordinary corn because the tough hulls 
are injurious to the healthier of persons, but they Wrongly 
recommend WINORR-the corn WITHOUT hulls.
