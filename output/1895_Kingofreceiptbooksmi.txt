Herein you will find one hundred (loo) recipes which 
I have tried myself, personally, and know them to be the 
best that can be produced, being the most simple and 
effective, thereby saving much extra expense, • vch is 
generally incurred by the use of lengthy recipes, ^vhich 
give less results than those which you will find contained in 
this book. 

In presenting this book to the public with much trouble 
and expense, I know 1 shall be fully repaid by the apprecia- 
tion of a public which is always alive to the want of such a 
book as I now put before you, and which I hope will meet 
with success. 

In putting up the preparations contained herein, they can 
be put up in proportions to suit purchasers' use.

PUT UP IN T O SOLUTlONvS. 

SoLunoN "A" 

Potassium Iodide, - - 120 gr. 

Iodine, - - - - 6 gr. 

' ( Glycerine, - - - 3 fl. dr. 

Infusion of Rose, - - 4 fl. oz. 

Dissolve the Potassium Iodide in a small quantity of the 
Rose infusion, and one fluid drachm of the Glycerine. 
With this fluid moisten the Iodine in a mortar or earthen 
dish, and rub it down, gradually adding more liquid, until 
a complete solution is obtained ; then stir in the remainder 
of the ingredients and bottle the mixture. 

Solution " B " 

Sodium Hypophosphite, - 240 gr. 

Rose Water, - . 16 fl. oz. 

Dissolve and filter. 



How TO Use.- With a camel's hair brush or piece of 
fine sponge, apply a little of the Solution "A" to the tanned 
or freckled surface, until a slight but tolerably uniform 
brownish surface has been produced. At the expiration of 
fifteen or twenty minutes moisten a piece of soft rag with 
Solution " 15 " and lay it on the affected part, removing and 
squeezing away the liquid, soaking it again afresh and ap- 
plying until the Iodine otain has disappeared. Repeat the 
entire process three times daily, but diminish the frecjuency 
of the application if tenderness is produced. In the course 
of a few days to as many weeks, the discoloration will have 
entirely disappeared. This you will find a sure remedy for 
the removal of freckles and sunburn.

To make the starch : For two shirts, collars, and 
cuffs, take one tablespoonful of starch dissolved in water ; 
shave a piece of the above into it the size of a bean ; pour 
boiling water into it until thick, cook twenty minutes, and 
set away to cool. Take one tablespoonful of starch, dissolve 
it in cold water and when the boiled gets luke warm, pour 
it over it, stir well and strain. 

Have the garments dry, and lay the starch on the wrong 
side and work it through, (be careful that the right side is 
wet through^ then roll up in a clean cloth, and leave stand 
for a few minutes ; stretch them on a bosom board and 
with a damp cloth rub out all wrinkles ; lay a fine cloth 
over and iron twice ; take off the cloth and iron perfectly 
dry. For the polishing process you need a good, smooth, 
hard board. Put the bosom on the board, dip a clean, 
white cloth in water, wring dry and rub lightly over the 
bosom, then rub it with a dry cloth and polish it with back 
of iron or polishing iron, and your shirts and collars will 
give you satisfaction.

3/Caple Syiup and Sugar. 

It is astonishing that nine-tenths of the maple syrup and 
sugar that are sold as the genuine articles, are nothing more 
than clever imitations. The method of making the best 
quality of these imitations, and which really defies detection 
of a majority of dealers and consumers, is very cheap and 
simple. A gallon of the syrup costing about fifty cents, and 
the sugar simply the cost of the ordinary cheap sugar. 

We are told by a Mr. Baldwin, of Kentucky, a son of 
the reputed discoverer of the secret of producing maple 
flavoring, that various manufacturers o\ imitations of maple 
sugar and syrups in large cities had paid his father thousands 
of dollars in royalties for his discovery. 

I'rocure a quantity of the rough outside bark of what is 
known as the scaly bark hickory tree. Take about three or 
four pounds of the bark and boil in one-half gallon of water 
until it is reduced to a quart, then strain and add five 
pounds of brown sugar, heat again and thoroughly dissolve, 
when it is ready for use. To make the sugar, simply boil 
the syrup until it is reduced back to sugar again, and 
when it is made properly, the flavor and appearance of the 
genuine article is obtained.

as an injection for vaginitis in women. 



^Rli-£ciicorrhoeal £olioTi. 

« Leucorrhoea in young girls," says Dr. Bonchit, " is due 
to inflammation of the vulvae, and not of the vagina or the 
womb. That is the complaint that must be treated both 
locally and generally. The local treatment consists : First, 
in maintaining extreme cleanliness in the parts affected, by 
means of washing with bran water ; and, second, by modi- 
fying the inflamed surfaces. To fulfil this mdication, use 
a solution of carbolic acid— seventy-five grains to a quart of 
water— in hip baths, or in lotions. In the interval between 
the lotions, keep a piece of lint impregnated with a solu- 
tion of coal tar, or covered with Red Precipitate Oint- 
ment, between the vulvae. For internal medication pure
