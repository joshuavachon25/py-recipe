APPETIZERS 

These are served at dinner or luncheon 
in the place of shell-fish, immediately before 
the soup, or they may precede the shell fish. 



Anchovy Canapes 

Mash three anchovies, add a teaspoonful 
of onion juice, the yolk of a hard-boiled 
egg, a dash of pepper and a tablespoonful 
of olive oil. Cut rounds from thin slices 
of brown bread, toast them quickly, spread 
with soft butter, then with the anchovy 
mixture. Garnish with slices of pimolas 
and the white of the egg pressed through a 
vegetable press. Dish on paper mats on a 
heated plate, and send to the table. 



Sardine Canapes 

Make precisely the same as anchovy can- 
apes, using two sardines. 



6 MRS. RORER S DAINTIES 

Caviar Canapes 

Turn the desired quantity of caviar from 
the jar into a Httle bowl; add a tablespoon- 
ful of lemon juice and a dash of tabasco. 
Have ready a little finely chopped onion and 
hard-boiled egg pressed through a sieve, 
white and yolk separate. Cut rounds or 
squares of bread, toast them quickly, spread 
with butter, then with the caviar mixture, 
garnish with chopped onion and hard-boiled 
egg, and send to the table. 



Tongue Canapes 

Chop two ounces of cold boiled tongue 
very fine; add to it a tablespoonful of olive 
oil, a dash of pepper, a half teaspoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce, and use precisely the 
same as the preceding mixture. 



Oyster Canapes 

Toast brown bread, butter it quickly, 
cover the top neatly with pickled oysters, and 
send at once to the table. 



APPETIZERS 7 

Fish Canapes 

Mince cold boiled fish. To each half 
cupful add a tablespoonful of lemon juice and 
a tablespoonful of olive oil. Rub the spoon 
with garlic, stir the fish, then add a half 
teaspoonful of salt and a dash of tabasco. 
Cut white bread into squares or rounds, 
toast quickly and spread with butter; put 
over it the fish mixture, garnish with pickled 
oyster crabs, and send at once to the table. 

These are the most sightly and elegant 
of the canapes. 



VEGETABLE COCKTAILS 

These, as well as fruit cocktails, are 
served at the beginning of a dinner in the 
place of shell-fish. At a summer luncheon 
they take the place of both shell-fish and 
soup. All sorts of vegetables may be used, 
served in small punch glasses, or in peppers 
with the seeds removed, or in scooped out 
tomatoes, or in apple shells. 

Fruit cocktails are attractive in the rinds 
of oranges, lemons, shaddocks or in apple 
shells. Serve with them both an oyster fork 
and a small spoon. 

Tomato Cocktails 

4 good-sized tomatoes 
2 tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup 
I dash of tabasco 
Yt. teaspoonful of salt 
6 sweet peppers 

I teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce 
I tablespoonful of grated onion 

Peel the tomatoes, cut them into halves, 
press out the seeds; cut the flesh in small 
blocks. Add all the other ingredients and 



VEGETABLE COCKTAILS 9 

stand them on the ice to cool. At serving 
time cut the bottoms from the peppers, and 
after taking out the seeds, stand them in a 
bowl filled with finely shaved ice; put in 
the tomato "cocktail," put on the "lid," and 
send to the table. 

String Beans may be boiled, cut into 
small pieces and used in the same way, or 
stuffed into peeled, scooped-out tomatoes. 

In this case the tomato can be eaten; in 
the first case the peppers are not eaten, al- 
though frequently a portion cut off with the 
lid is chopped and mixed with the tomato 
inside. 

Boiled Cauliflower, Asparagus, Jeru- 
salem Artichokes, all make admirable 
"cocktails." Use them in precisely the same 
way, either in punch glasses or in tomatoes 
placed in shallow bowls, partly filled with 
cracked ice. 



FRUIT COCKTAILS 

Orange and Rose Cocktails 

Cut three nice oranges into halves; 
scoop out the pulp and remove the white 
membrane, leaving the shells clean. Wash 
and place them on the ice. To the pulp add 
three level tablespoonfuls of powdered 
sugar, and stand it also on the ice or in a 
cold place. At serving time add to the pulp 
a cupful of mashed rose petals and a tea- 
spoonful of rose water. Fill the shells, put 
a tablespoonful of shaved ice in the center 
of each, dish on dainty paper mats or ferns, 
and serve at once. 



Violet Cocktails 

Peel one very ripe banana, slice and cut 
each slice into halves; add, cut into halves, 
a quarter pound of candied or maraschino 
cherries. Cut three nice oranges into halves ; 
scoop out the pulp; add it and the juice of 
half a lemon to the other ingredients. Stand 
on ice. Prepare the orange shells as in the 



FRUIT COCKTAILS II 

preceding recipe. At serving lime fill the 
shells, garnish the top with candied violets, 
dish on sprays of maidenhair, and serve. 

Orange cups filled with sliced strawber- 
ries make strawberry cocktails. 

Apple Cocktails 

Cut a slice from the stem end of nice 
red apples, scoop out the flesh, leaving a thin 
wall. Cover both flesh and shells with cold 
water to prevent discoloration. Pare and 
grate a small, very ripe pineapple. Put it 
on ice. At serving time add to it four table- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar, and the apple 
flesh cut into blocks; fill the shells, dish on 
paper mats, and serve. 

East Indian Cocktails 

A DESSERT 

The day before you expect to serve these, 
grate a cocoanut, and pour over it a pint of 
boiling water. Stir it well ; put it in a cloth 
or bag and press thoroughly. Stand the 
milk thus obtained aside to cool. Next day 
cut three or four oranges into halves, scoop 



X2 



out the pulp, and prepare the shells as in 
the first recipe. At serving time mix the 
orange pulp with sufficient of the cocoanut 
"cream" to give it a good consistency. Add 
four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, a 
tablespoonful of orange flower water and 
the juice of one lemon; mix and fill the 
shells, cover the top with chopped almonds, 
pistachio nuts or grated macaroons. Dish 
in little nests of any sweet, fresh flowers — 
sweet peas, violets, asparagus vine or scarlet 
rambler. 



PUNCHES 

Cranberry Punch 

Wash one pint of cranberries; add one 
pint of cold water, cover and cook five min- 
utes. Press them through a sieve, add a 
half pint of sugar, and when the mixture 
is cold, freeze it lightly. Serve in glasses, 
with the game or meat course at dinner. 
Currants may be used in place of cran- 
berries. 



Currant Jelly Punch 

Add one pint of boiling water and the 
juice of one lemon to one glass of red cur- 
rant jelly. Stir the mixture over the fire 
until the jelly is thoroughly dissolved. When 
cold, freeze lightly. Beat the white of an 
egg until light, add one tablespoonful of 
powdered sugar, beat again, and stir it in 
the frozen punch. Serve in glasses with 
the meat or game course at dinner. 



14 MRS. rorer's dainties 

Grape Punch 

Add the juice of one lemon and a half 
cup of sugar to one pint of grape juice. Mix 
and add a pint of cold water. Freeze and 
serve in glasses with the red meat course at 
dinner. 

Mint Punch 

Pick the leaves from twelve nice stalks 
of mint. Wash, chop and pound them to a 
pulp. Boil together for five minutes a half 
pound of sugar and a pint of water; add 
the mint, stir well and- cool. When cold, 
add the juice of two lemons, and freeze. 
Serve in glasses with lamb or mutton at 
dinner. 

Ginger Punch 

Slice or chop a quarter pound of can- 
died ginger, add a quart of water, soak it 
two. hours and simmer for thirty minutes; 
add a half pint of sugar and the juice of 
two lemons. When cold, freeze and serve 
in glasses with the meat course at dinner. 

Plain frozen ginger ale is also nice. 



PUNCHES 15 

All dinner punches are made in the same 
way; they must not be very sweet, espe- 
cially when served with red meats. 



Watermelon Punch 

Cut the stem end from a ripe melon and 
scoop out all the pulp, leaving the rind nice 
and evenly cleaned inside. Cut a very thin 
slice from the blossom end, stand the "shell" 
in a deep chop plate and surround it with 
dainty flowers and greens. Remove all 
seeds and mash the pulp, add to it a pint of 
orange juice and a cup of powdered sugar. 
Freeze, turning the crank very slowly. 
Serve in the shell, using it the same as a 
punch bowl. This is nice for little after- 
noon affairs. Pass lady fingers or rolled 
wafers. 



1 6 MRS. roeer's dainties 

Orange Punch 

1 pound of sugar 

2 lemons 

1 quart of water 
6 oranges 

2 tablespoonfuls of granulated gelatin 

Put the sugar, water and grated lemon 
and one orange rind and the gelatin in a 
saucepan ; let them stand for fifteen minutes, 
and then stir over the fire until the mixture 
reaches the boiling point ; take from the fire, 
and when cool add the juice of the lemons 
and oranges and a bottle of ginger ale ; strain 
the mixture, turn it into the freezing can, 
and stir it now and then until frozen like 
wet snow. 

Serve in punch glasses at afternoon teas 
or evening affairs, or as a punch course at 
dinner. 

Strawberry Frappe 

I quart of mashed strawberries 

Juice of one orange 
I quart of water 
I pound of sugar 

Mash the berries, add the orange juice, 
sugar and water, and stand aside for an 



PUNCHES 17 

hour; then stir until the sugar is thor- 
oughly dissolved. This can be partly frozen 
as in the preceding recipe, or made icy cold 
by adding shaved ice at serving time. Serve 
at afternoon or evening affairs. 



Jamaica Ginger Punch 

I two-ounce bottle of the best Jamaica ginger 
Yi ounce of cream of tartar 
Yi. pound of sugar 

I Grated yellow rind and juice of a lemon 

I quart of water 

Add the sugar and the grated rind of 
the lemon to the water, bring to boiling 
point and cool; strain, add the lemon juice 
and the Jamaica ginger; turn into the 
freezer, stir slowly until frozen like wet 
snow. 

This is exceedingly nice for a lawn party 
during hot weather. Serve with it choco- 
late or plain wafers. 



1 8 MRS. rorer's dainties 

Lemon Squash 

1 lemon 

y^ pint of soda or seltzer 

2 rounding teaspoonfuls of powdered sugar 

Roll the lemon in the sugar. The better 
way to do this is to put the sugar on paper 
and then roll the lemon on it; brush off 
that which sticks to the outside. Put the 
sugar in a tumbler, add the juice of the 
lemon, strained, then the soda or seltzer 
from a siphon, and serve at once. 

Grape Squash 

I quart of grape juice 
J4 cupful of powdered sugar 
4 bottles of soda, or 2 siphons of seltzer 

The better way to serve this is to get 
four or five siphons of soda, seltzer or Vichy 
at the drug store, put the sweetened grape 
juice in a pitcher, pour the tumbler half full, 
and fill it up with the carbonated waters. 



PUNCHES 19 

Combination Squash 

This is one of the nicest of all the 
squashes. It can easily be served for an 
evening card party or an afternoon recep- 
tion. For the latter, however, I should use 
a punch bowl. 

Grate the yellow rind of three oranges 
into two pounds of sugar, add one quart of 
water, bring to a boil, boil five minutes, 
strain and cool. Add the juice of the 
oranges, the juice of three lemons, one 
grated pineapple, one pound of powdered 
sugar and one teaspoonful of vanilla. At 
serving time pour this into your punch bowl 
over a block of ice; or, for a small party, 
put it into a pitcher, pour it into tumblers 
of cracked ice, fill the tumblers with soda 
water and serve at once. In the punch bowl 
add the soda or ApoUinaris at the last min- 
ute, just at serving time. 



20 MRS. RORER S DAINTIES 

Tea Punch 

6 lemons 

2 oranges 

2 pounds of sugar 

1 teaspoonful of almond extract 

2 ripe red bananas 

4 tablespoonfuls of English breakfast tea 

3 quarts of Apollinaris 
I pint of ginger ale 

Put the tea into a pitcher and pour over 
one quart of the water, boihng hot; cover 
and stand aside for twenty minutes and 
strain. . Add the grated yellow rinds of 
three lemons, and the oranges, to the sugar, 
and add the remaining two quarts of water. 
Stir until the sugar is dissolved, boil five 
minutes, strain and cool. To this add the 
orange and lemon juice and the almond 
extract. When very, very cold, and ready 
to serve, turn it into the punch bowl over a 
block of ice; add the ginger ale, and, if 
you like, a few white grapes or other fresh 
fruit, cut into small bits, 



PUNCHES 21 

Lemon Syrup 

This is exceedingly nice to make when 
lemons are plentiful, to be put aside to use 
during the summer months. Squeeze suffi- 
cient lemons to make one quart of strained 
juice. Put six pounds of sugar into a por- 
celain lined kettle. Beat the whites of two 
eggs until they are quite light, and then stir 
into them one quart of cold water; stir this 
into the sugar, and stir until the sugar is 
dissolved. Place the kettle over the fire, 
bring quickly to a boil, and boil and skim 
until no scum can be seen on the surface. 
Add the lemon juice, stand the kettle over 
a moderate fire, where it will just bubble, 
for fifteen minutes, and then stand it aside 
to cool. Have ready perfectly sterile bot- 
tles — bottles that have been put in cold 
water and brought to the boiling point. 
Have the corks also in boiling water. Fill 
the bottles to within two inches of the top 
of the neck with the hot syrup, put in the 
corks and hammer them down; dip them at 
once into sealing wax and stand aside in a 
cool place. 



22 MRS. ROREr's DAINTIES 

Strawberry Syrup 

Select fine, fresh, perfect berries; mash 
them and squeeze them in cheese cloth. To 
each quart of this allow one quart of sugar. 
Put the juice in the preserving kettle, add 
the sugar, stir until the sugar is dissolved, 
and boil two minutes. Fill into sterilized 
bottles, cork, put the bottles down in a kettle 
of hot water so that they will be entirely- 
covered, boil fifteen minutes, dip the corks 
at once into sealing wax, and put aside. 

Raspberry and currant juice, blackberry 
or grape juice, may be made in the same 
way to use for pudding sauces, ice cream or 
the various punches. 

Horse Neck 

Pare a lemon around and around with- 
out breaking the peel; put it, in the shape 
of a corkscrew, in a long tumbler, and fill 
the tumbler with cold ginger ale. 



PUNCHES 23 

William's Medley 

Wash a good-sized pineapple; chop it 
fine without peeling, put it in three quarts 
of cold water, bring to a boil; boil for 
thirty minutes, and press as much as you 
can through a sieve. To this liquid add 
one pound of sugar, boil ten minutes after 
it begins to boil, cool, add one cupful of 
lemon juice and two cupfuls of strawberry 
or raspberry juice. When cold pour this 
over a block of ice, and at serving time add 
ApoUinaris to make it palatable. 

Mint Phosphate 

I bunch of mint 
Yz cupful of powdered sugar 
I or 2 lemons 
Phosphate 
Chopped candied cherries 

It is better to make this immediately in 
the tumblers. Have the mint washed and 
chopped rather fine, put a teaspoonful in the 
bottom of each tumbler, put on top two or 
three tablespoonfuls of ice, powdered sugar, 
a dash of lemon juice, a dash of phosphate, 
and fill up with cold water. 



24 MRS. RORER's dainties 

Egg Fizz 

Put two tablespoonfuls of fruit syrup 
into a glass, add two or three tablespoonfuls 
of finely cracked ice, drop in one whole egg, 
and fill the glass half full of milk. Shake 
until thoroughly mixed, then fill up with 
soda water. 

Cold Coffee 

This is exceedingly nice for a warm 
evening, where people are fond of coffee. 
Prepare quite strong coffee in the French 
fashion, drain it from the grounds, sweeten 
to taste, and stand aside to cool. At serving 
time fill tall glasses half full of finely shaved 
ice, pour over the coffee, beat rapidly for a 
moment with a spoon, cover with whipped 
cream, and serve at once. 

Chocolate may be used in the same way. 



Half and Half 

This is one of the nicest of the hot- 
weather drinks. If it is to be served at an 
ordinary table, I should put a bottle of gin- 
ger ale and a split of Apollinaris at each 



PUNCHES 35 

plate, or put a block of ice into a large, pref- 
erably glass, pitcher, put in two bottles of 
good ginger ale, add a pint of ApoUinaris, 
and serve at once. The rule is to use one 
split of ApoUinaris (this is a half pint) to 
each bottle of ginger ale. Put the ginger 
ale in the pitcher or glass first, and then add 
the ApoUinaris. 

Mint Frappe 

2 good-sized bunches of mint 
6 lemons 

2 pounds of sugar 
I quart of water 
ApoUinaris 

Wash the mint, remove the leaves from 
the stems, chop them fine and pound them 
in a mortar, or rub them in a bowl. Add 
these to the water and then stir them into 
the sugar. Bring to a boil and strain. 
When cool, add the juice of the lemons, and 
if the color is too pale, add a drop of green 
vegetable coloring. Stand aside until very 
cold. At serving time fill the punch bowl 
quarter full of shaved ice, pour over the 
mint syrup, add one or two bottles of Apol- 
linaris, and serve. 



26 MRS. rorer's dainties 

Pop 

Yi gallon of water 
y-i pound of sugar 

1 white of an egg 

2 ounces of Jamaica ginger 
I lemon 

1 teaspoonful of gelatin 
]/i compressed yeast cake 

Beat the white of the &%'g, add a pint of 
water, then add the sugar and juice of the 
lemon. Bring this to a boil, and skim. 
When cool, add the ginger, the gelatine 
moistened in cold water, and the remaining 
water. Add the yeast cake, moistened; mix 
thoroughly. Let it stand one hour, bottle, 
and tie down the corks. 



English Mead 

y-i ounce of hops 
2 pounds of strained honey 
J4 gallon of water 
J4 compressed yeast cake 
The juice of two lemons 

Boil the hops and water together for a 
half hour, strain and add the honey and 
lemon juice. Boil for another half hour, 
cool to lukewarm, add the yeast, bottle, tie 



PUNCHES 27 

down the corks and stand in a cold place. 
This will be ready to use in twenty-four to 
thirty-six hours. 

Apple Juice 

Wash tart apples, quarter and remove 
the cores. Put the quarters in a porcelain 
lined kettle, add water to prevent scorching, 
cover the kettle, boil and stir until the apples 
are thoroughly cooked. Turn them into a 
muslin bag and drain over night. Next 
morning select your bottles and corks, put 
them in water and bring to the boiling point. 
Boil the juice, skim it, and fill it, while hot, 
into the hot bottles. Cork the bottles, put 
them at once into a boiler of hot water, cover 
the boiler, and boil a half hour. Lift the 
bottles, dip the corks at once into sealing 
wax, and stand in your preserve closet for 
keeping. This is much better than cider for 
a winter drink. 



CAKES 

Chocolate Macaroons 

4 whites of eggs 
Yz pound of powdered sugar 
2 ounces of grated chocolate 

Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiflf 
froth; then sift and stir in the sugar care- 
fully and quickly, and then the chocolate. 
Drop by teaspoonfuls on waxed paper in the 
bottom of a baking pan, and bake in a mod- 
erately quick oven until crisp — about ten 
minutes. 

Almond Cookies 

Yi cupful of almonds 
Ij4 cupfuls of sugar 

1 cupful of thick sour milk 
J^ cupful of butter 

2 eggs 

I level teaspoonful of soda

Blanch, dry and chop the almonds. Beat 
the eggs, sugar and butter until very light, 
and add the almonds. Dissolve the soda in 



CAKES 29 

two tablespoonfuls of water, add it to the 
sour milk, and then to the other ingredients 
add the almond extract and flour, about three 
and a half cupfuls, to make a soft dough. 
Roll about an inch thick, cut in round cakes, 
and bake in a moderate oven ten minutes. 

Serve with chocolate at afternoon teas, 
or with desserts at luncheons. 



Fruit Cookies 

y-i cupful of butter 
y-2 pound of raisins 
4 tablespoonfuls of milk 

1 teaspoonful of cinnamon 

2 cupfuls of sugar 
2 eggs 

I rounding teaspoonful of baking powder 

Beat the butter to a cream, add the 
sugar, beat again, and then add the eggs, 
well beaten. Seed and chop the raisins; 
add them to the sugar mixture, then the milk 
and cinnamon. Sift three cupfuls of flour 
with the baking powder, add it to the other 
ingredients, mix, and then add sufficient 
flour to make a dough that will roll and cut ; 
handle it as soft as possible. Bake in a 
quick oven until brown. 



30 MRS. RORER S DAINTIES 

Anise Drops 

I cupful of powdered sugar 
I level teaspoonful of anise seed 
5 eggs 
J4 pound of Jordan almonds 
J4 pint of bread or cracker crumbs 

Beat the eggs, without separating, and 
the sugar for thirty minutes; add the 
almonds, blanched, dried and chopped fine. 
Have the bread or cracker crumbs sifted. 
Add the anise seed, then the nuts, and last 
the bread crumbs. Mix quickly and turn 
into a shallow baking pan that has been 
lined with rice paper. Bake in a moderately 
quick oven about thirty minutes. 

The cake is too delicate to turn from 
the pan; let it remain until cool, then cut 
into squares or strips. Serve with choco- 
late or coffee at afternoon teas. If well 
made, this cake is light and very good. 



CAKES 31 

Chocolate Wafers 

I cupful of sugar 

I egg 

1 teaspoonful of vanilla 
J4 cupful of butter 

4 ounces of grated chocolate 

2 cupfuls of pastry flour

Beat the butter to a cream; add gradu- 
ally the sugar, and beat until light; add 
the eggs beaten and the chocolate grated. 
Dissolve the soda in a tablespoonf ul of warm 
water, add it to the mixture, then add the 
vanilla and flour. Whole wheat or graham 
flour may be substituted for pastry flour. 
The dough must be sufficiently stiff to roll 
as thin as a "wafer"; cut in squares and 
bake in a moderate oven until crisp — about 
ten minutes. 

These are very nice with cocoa or choc- 
olate for afternoon teas. 



32 MRS. RORER S DAINTIES 

Nut Cream Cakes

Yi pint of pastry flour 

Yz pint of water 

3 eggs

2 yolks of eggs 
Y2 cupful of powdered sugar 

I teaspoonful of coffee extract 

Put the butter and the water over the 
fire, and when boihng, add hastily the flour ; 
stir until you have a smooth, soft dough, 
take from the fire, and when cool, add one 
£§■§■ without beating; mix until smooth, 
then drop in another ^^^ and beat again, 
and then the third; beat the mixture until 
smooth and rather soft. Drop by teaspoon- 
fuls on a shallow greased baking pan, and 
bake in a moderate oven about a half hour, 
until the cakes are perfectly light and crisp. 
While they are baking, blanch and chop the 
nuts very fine. Beat the yolks of the eggs 
with the powdered sugar until very light; 
add the nuts and a tablespoonful of black 
cofifee or a teaspoonful of cofifee extract. 
When the cakes are done, make an incision 



CAKES 33 

at the side, fill with the nut mixture, dust 
with powdered sugar, and they are ready 
to serve. 

They will keep nicely several hours, but 
are not good the next day.

ally the sugar. Measure the milk, sift the 
flour and baking powder, and beat the 
whites of the eggs. First add the milk to 
the sugar mixture, then nearly all the flour 
and the lemon, and beat for at least five 
minutes ; then fold in the well-beaten whites 
and stir in the remaining quantity of flour. 
Be sure you have exceedingly light flour, or 
the cakes will be heavy. Bake in tiny patty 
pans. When cold, ice with lemon icing.

layer. When done, make a circle on the 
top crust, leaving a rim at the &&^t of at 
least two inches; lift this lid, using a dull

take out a portion of the crumb; fill it with 

MARSH MALLOW TUTTI FRUTTI 

I cupful of mixed chopped dates, cherries and raisins

6 Brazilian nuts 
J4 cupful of Jordan almonds, blanched and chopped 
Yi pint of marshmallow whip 

Put all the nuts and fruits through the

the marshmallow whip. Pour this into the 
cake, smoothing the top. If you use it, put 
four tablespoonf uls of sherry over the filling, 
and put on the lid. In the absence of sherry, 
use orange juice. Put on the lid, dust 
thickly with powdered sugar, and serve at 
once.

To Glace Cherries on the Stalks 

Put a pound of sugar and a half pint of 
water in a saucepan; add a saltspoonful of 
cream of tartar, stir until the sugar is dis- 
solved ; then boil carefully, without stirring, 
to the "crack." Have the cherries in 
bunches, and, if you like, have one or two 
leaves on each bunch. Place at one side a 
pint of boiling vinegar, dip the cherries 
quickly in this; hold them in the air for a 
moment, then dip them in the hot syrup and 
lay them on oiled paper on a sieve. 

This cannot be done on a damp day, and 
they must be used within twenty-four hours 
after making. Dip each cherry separately. 
Do not dip the leaves.

a heavy thread. Turn it on a large platter 
that has been slightly oiled, and when cool, 
not cold, stir with a spoon until it becomes 
perfectly white and creamy. Knead the 
mixture for a moment; then put it in a 
small saucepan, stand this in another of 
boiling water, and stir continuously until 
the "fondant" melts. If then it seems too 
thick, add, drop by drop, a little boiling 
water until it is the right consistency to 
"ice" the fruit. Have ready little paper 
cases or oiled paper. Select perfect red, 
white and black cherries. If you allow them 
to remain in bunches, see that each cherry 
is dry and clean. Dip one at a time in the 
hot cream or icing, and put it aside to dry. 
If you wish to ice three or four cherries on 
a single bunch and have each one a differ- 
ent color, separate the fondant and flavor 
and color to taste; for instance, add a drop 
of bitter almond with green, red with rose, 
vanilla with white, chocolate or coffee with 
brown, and yellow with orange. If you dip 
one cherry in vanilla, hold until dry, which 
will take but a moment, then dip the second 
in orange, the third in rose, and so on. 



SIMPLE CANDIES 59 

Creamed Strawberries

preceding recipe. Select medium-sized ripe 
berries ; pull the hulls close to the stem, dip 
the berries in the fondant, replace the hulls 
and put at once in paper cases, or stand 
them on oiled paper to dry. Serve heaped 
on a cut-glass dish. 

Strawberries, having a soft outside cov- 
ering, not a skin like cherries, will keep 
only a few hours. 

Creamed Oranges 

The carpels of oranges or mandarins 
must be separated carefully, not broken. 
Dip them in white or orange "fondant." 
These are usually placed in paper cases 
made for the purpose. 

Creamed White Grapes 

Cut white grapes from the bunch, leav- 
ing a bit of stem on each grape. By this 
stem dip the grapes in fondant, and place 
at once in paper cases. All small fruits may 
be dipped in the same manner.

oyster crackers or very light, small biscuits 
into chocolate fondant. 

Chocolettes are made in precisely the 
same way, using opera wafers broken into 
halves. Crackers, being free from sugar, 
make an exceedingly pleasant cake when 
dipped in fondant.

soak for fifteen minutes; add the cherry 
juice, and stand it over hot water to dis- 



68 MRS. rorer's dainties 

solve the gelatin; add the sugar and lemon 
juice, and stir until it is dissolved. If the 
cherries are rather dry, and you have not at 
least a half cup of cherry juice, make up that 
quantity by adding hot water. Strain the 
gelatin over the cherries, turn them into a 
fancy mold, and stand away for two or three 
hours to harden. 

They should not be stiff, but just firm 
enough to hold together. Serve plain with 
sponge cake.

DESSERTS 69 

hot water until dissolved, strain it in the 
pineapple; turn into small individual molds 
and stand aside in a very cold place for at 
least two hours. 

This mixture cannot stand all night ; the 
pineapple will digest the gelatin and the mix- 
ture will become liquid. At serving time 
turn the compote on dainty small dishes, 
whip the cream to a stiff froth, heap it 
around the compotes, and send to the table.

root moistened; stir until the mixture is 
as thick as cream and transparent. Cut 
pieces of bread the shape of a half pear; 
drop them in a small quantity of hot oil; 
when brown on one side, turn and quickly 



70 MRS. RORER S DAINTIES 

brown the other; drain on soft paper. Ar- 
range these on a round heated dish. Put 
the pears for a moment in the hot syrup; 
lift the halves carefully, put them on the 
toast, points in, leaving a space in the center 
about the size of a small saucer. Put a 
quarter pound of candied or glazed cher- 
ries in the boiling syrup, boil for a moment,

flour that has been sifted two or three times ; 
turn the batter carefully in a Turk's head, 
and bake in a moderately quick oven for 
thirty minutes. When thoroughly done, turn 
the cake on a sieve, and when cold, cover 
it with chocolate icing. When the icing is 
cold, remove a slice from the top of the cake 
and take out the entire inside, leaving a wall 
three-quarters of an inch in thickness at the 
bottom and sides. When ready to serve, 
fill this space with chocolate charlotte, re- 
place the slice on the top, dish on a large 
lace paper mat, and send to the table.

lotte russe, using plain vanilla icing, which 
may be thickly dusted with chopped almonds 
or pistachio nuts. An angels' food filled 
with charlotte russe, iced, and garnished 
with chopped pistachio nuts, the base gar- 
nished with preserved green English wal- 
nuts, is one of the most sightly and attract- 
ive of all desserts.

the bottom of each "well" put a tablespoon- 
ful of jam or preserves, heap whipped cream

plunge the can a moment in hot water, and 
turn the souffle on a round dish. This 
should be frozen quite hard on the outside, 
but should be soft and creamy in the center ; 
or, if one prefers to serve it from the pantry,

milk, then turn the mixture back in the 
boiler, cook until it thickens, and take from 
the fire. Add the gelatin, strain, and add the 
pulled figs, that have been soaked over night

Bombe Glace 

This dessert is made by lining a bombe 
mold with a thick layer of ice cream and 
filling the center with water ice, using flavor- 
ings that are agreeable, and those that blend 
nicely. Vanilla ice cream may be used with 
orange water ice; pistachio ice cream with 
strawberry water ice. A frozen French 
pudding may be filled with strawberry water 
ice. Vanilla ice cream may also be filled 
with cafe or chocolate parfait. 



io8 MRS. rorer's dainties 

After the mold is lined and filled, put on 
the cover, repack, and let it stand for at 
least two hours. Bombe glace is usually 
served with a sauce.

boil until they form a very light syrup, one 
that scarcely spins a thread; add the yolks, 
well beaten. Beat the mixture over the fire 
for a moment, take from the fire, and beat 
until quite cool. When very cold, add the 
vanilla and freeze; then fold in the cream, 
whipped to a stiff froth. Repack and stand 
aside for at least two hours. Chopped con- 
served fruits may be added at serving time. 
If they are dry and hard, soak in a little 
water, wine or orange juice. 



FROZEN PUDDINGS lOQ

to cool. At serving time mix the cold syrup 
with the cold fruit, fill tall glasses half full, 
cover with a layer of lemon or pineapple 
ice, garnish with a maraschino cherry, and 
serve. 



ICE CREAM SAUCES 

Chocolate Sauce 

Put four ounces of chocolate, with a cup- 
ful of sugar and a half cup of milk, over the 
fire in a saucepan; stir and boil until it 
forms a very thick syrup when dropped in 
cold water; take from the fire, add a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla, and pour at once in a 
hot pitcher; serve hot with ice cream. 

Dish the ice cream, put over it one or 
two tablespoonfuls of chocolate sauce, which 
will harden quickly, forming a sort of choc- 
olate icing. 

Maple Sauce 

Make according to preceding recipe, using 
one and a half cupfuls of maple sugar and 
only two ounces of chocolate. 

Hot Claret Sauce

together the yolks of three eggs and a half 
cup of sugar until light; add a little of 
the milk, turn the mixture back into the 
double boiler, and cook until it begins to 
thicken. Take from the fire, and add a 
tablespoonful of gelatin that has been soak- 
ing fifteen minutes in a quarter cup of 
water ; beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff 
froth, gradually add the hot custard, beating 
all the while. Stand aside to cool, and when 
very cold, add a teaspoonful of vanilla and, 
if you use it, four tablespoonfuls of sherry 
and two of brandy. This sauce must be the 
thickness of rich cream.

bigness is no criterion of its goodness. The fact that 
it is the best work of the best years of Mrs. Rorer's 
life ; that it is a complete new book telling of the things 
one needs to know about cooking, living, health, and 
the easiest and best way of housekeeping — these are 
what make for goodness, and place this book far in 
advance of any other of a like nature. 

The New Cook Book covers all departments of 
cookery. A masterly exposition of each subject is 
given, followed by recipes for the proper preparation, 
cooking and serving of the various kinds of foods. 
There are over 1500 recipes in the book. 

The illustrations are an important feature. One 
set of pictures shows the proper dressing of the table 
during a course dinner. Then there is a complete set 
showing the method of carving meats, poultry, game, 
etc.; and many others illustrating special features of 
the book.

Mrs. Rorer's 

Philadelphia Cook Book 

This is the standard book of Mrs. Rorer's that has 
been before the public for a number of years. It has 
no connection with Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book. 
Each book is independent of the other, and the posses- 
sion of one forms no reason for doing without the 
other. 

The Philadelphia Cook Book is full of good things, 
and, like all of Mrs. Rorer's works, is eminently prac- 
tical. It is a standard of excellence, in that it is 
full of the brightest things in cookery; the recipes 
are absolutely reliable, and the general instructions 
to housekeepers of the most helpful and necessary 
character. 

Nearly all cook books assume some knowledge and 
experience on the part of those who use them, but Mrs. 
Rorer makes her explanations so clear, and gives such 
definite directions, as to quantities, that the beginner 
has no difficulty in successfully accomplishing all the 
book calls for. Then there are frequent hints as to 
the proper use of left-overs, how to market, and, in 
many ways, information is given that is alike useful to 
the experienced cook as to the tyro in matters culinary. 

The book is full of choice recipes, every one of 
which has been successfully tested by Mrs. Rorer and 
found to come out right. This alone is of incalculable 
benefit and ought to commend the book to the favorable 
consideration of every housekeeper. 

The use of this book in the home means better 
health, better living, economy in the use of food, and 
a consequent saving in dollars and cents.

Mrs, Rorer^s 

Vegetable Cookery and Meat 

Substitutes 

This book has a twofold object: 

1. To show the value of vegetables in their relation to 
diet and health, how to prepare, cook and serve 
them, what to eat under certain conditions of health, 
and thus have them perform their proper work. 

2. To give to the prudent housewife a knowledge of 
combinations of foods in the shape of toothsome 
recipes to take the place of meat, or as we call 
them — Meat Substitutes. 

It goes without saying that we all know too little 
about the value of vegetables as food. We eat them 
because they are palatable, not realizing their immense 
importance as body builders. Here they are classified, 
and thus made to give us a right idea of their use. 

Then as to Meat Substitutes. It is not necessary 
to be a vegetarian to desire a change from a meat diet. 
There are health reasons often demanding abstention 
from meats ; or economy may be an impelling motive ; 
or a desire for change and variety in the daily bill of 
fare may be warrant enough. However we look at it 
here is the wonder book to point the way to better and 
healthier living. 

There is an abundance of the choicest and most 
palatable recipes, and they are given in such a manner, 
that if the directions are followed, the results are sure. 
You cannot make mistakes.

Mrs. Rorer^s 
Every Day Menu Book 

In the course of her teaching and editorial work, 
there have come to Mrs. Rorer frequent requests for 
a book that will provide a daily bill of fare, one that 
will be at once rational, its directions easy of accom- 
plishment, and give an excellent variety. Hence this 
Menu Book. 

It contains a menu for every meal in the year, 
systematically arranged by months and days ; menus for 
special occasions, such as holidays, weddings, luncheons, 
teas, etc.; illustrations of decorated tables for various 
social events, with appropriate menus ; menus arranged 
for the seasons both as to food and decorations; a 
department of menus without meats. A fine volume 
that ought to commend itself to every housekeeper.

Mrs, Rorer^s 
Cakes, Icings and Fillings 

Every one is interested in the cake problem. There 
is possibly no item in the home bill of fare on which 
a woman prides herself as the ability to make a good 
cake. But how to add variety to the goodness ? Here's 
the book to help. Contains a large number of enticing 
and valuable recipes for cakes of all sorts and condi- 
tions. Some need filling, some need icing — well, here 
you have all the necessary information. Best of all, 
there is no fear as to results. Follow the directions 
and your cake is bound to come out right.

Mrs, Rover's 
Canning and Preserving 

The only book on the subject worth the name. In 
it Mrs. Rorer discusses at length the canning and pre- 
serving of fruits and vegetables, with the kindred 
subjects of marmalades, butters, fruit jelHes and syrups, 
drying and pickling. The recipes are clearly and simply 
given. In the new edition now presented, the author 
has brought the book up to date, and has included 
many new, rare and original recipes that have been 
accumulating since the book was first introduced. It 
has always been a favorite book with the public, and 
now it will be doubly welcome.

Mrs. Rorer's 
My Best 250 Recipes 

It would be strange indeed if, out of the multitude 
of recipes Mrs. Rorer has invented and used during 
her long career as a teacher, writer and lecturer, she 
did not have some that appealed to her more strongly 
than others. She has gathered these together, classi- 
fying them under their different heads. There are Best 
20 Soups; Best 20 Fish Recipes; Best 20 Meats; Best 
20 Salads; Best 20 Desserts; Best 20 Sauces, Vegeta- 
bles, Fruit Preserves, Luncheon Dishes, Ices, Summer

Mrs. Rover's New Salads 

For Dinners, Luncheons, Suppers and Receptions. 
With a group of Odd Salads and some Ceylon Salads. 

A salad made from a succulent green vegetable and 
French dressing, should be seen on the dinner table 
in every well-regulated household three hundred and 
sixty-five times a year. These green vegetables contain 
the salts necessary to the well being of our blood ; the 
oil is an easily-digested form of fatty matter ; the lemon 
juice gives us sufficient acid; therefore simple salads 
are exceedingly wholesome. 

During the summer, the dinner salad may be com- 
posed of any well-cooked green vegetable, served with 
a French dressing ; string laeans, cauliflower, a mixture 
of peas, turnips, carrots and new beets, boiled radishes, 
cucumbers, tomatoes, uncooked cabbage, and cooked 
spinach. In the winter serve celery, lettuce, endive and 
chicory.

Mrs. Rorer's Dainties 

Possibly no part of the daily bill of fare so taxes 
the ingenuity of the housewife as the dessert, that final 
touch to the meal that lingers in the palate like a bene- 
diction. We tire of constant repetitions of familiar 
things. We want variety. Why not have it when 
there are so many ways and means of gratifying our 
tastes. Mrs. Rorer has given here a number of choice 
things covering quite a range of possibilities.

Mrs, Rorer^s 
Many Ways for Cooking Eggs 

Did you ever reflect what an important part eggs 
play in our domestic economy ? When from any reason 
other things fail, the perplexed housewife knows she 
can do something to tide over her difficulties by the 
use of eggs. But how many know the great possibilities 
that lie in an egg — the very many ways of cooking and 
preparing them for the table? To many, boiled, fried, 
poached and scrambled form the limit of their knowl- 
edge. But get this book and you'll be surprised at the 
feast in store for you. You'll also find recipes for 
delectable Egg Sauces.

Made -Over Dishes 

How to transform the left overs into palatable and 
wholesome dishes. With many new and valuable 
recipes. 
We quote from the author's introduction: 

"Economical marketing does not mean the purchase 
of inferior articles at a cheap price, but of a small 
quantity of the best materials found in the market; 
these materials to be wisely and economically used. 
Small quantity and no waste, just enough and not a 
piece too much, is a good rule to remember. In roasts 
and steaks, however, there will be, in spite of careful 
buying, bits left over, that if economically used, may 
be converted into palatable, sightly and wholesome 
dishes for the next day's lunch or supper.

Mrs. Rorer's 
How to Use a Chafing Dish 

Of all the useful and dependable articles of food, 
commend us to the Sandwich. Nothing in the whole 
range of foods presents such a wonderful opportunity 
for variety. The sandwich is the handy thing for 
suppers, teas, social calls, school lunch baskets, picnics — 
but where can you not use it to advantage and enjoy- 
ment ? In this book Mrs. Rorer has given a lot of new, 
original recipes, with some very odd ones. She has 
drawn upon her wonderful knowledge and inventive 
faculty and the result is a bewildering array of delect- 
able sandwiches.

Mrs. Rorer's Sandwiches 

It is wonderful the amount of pleasure and satis- 
faction that can be had with a Chafing Dish. Few 
people know how to use one successfully, although the 
art is easily acquired. This book, for instance, gives 
the proper directions for making hosts of good things, 
and if they are followed implicitly, the most inexperi- 
enced person can be sure of results. It is a handy 
thing in an emergency, and it forms a delightful adjunct 
to a supper or dinner. Guests are always interested in 
watching the evolution of some delectable dish, and 
the head of the table has a chance to show his or 
her skill.

PINEAPPLE HULNAH 

Pare and remove the eyes from 
one large or two small pineapples ; 
grate, rejecting the core. Mix four 
even tablespoonfuls of cornstarch 
with half cup granulated sugar; 
now add this to the pineapple, turn 
the whole into a double boiler and 
stir constantly until boiling hot and 
thick ; add a tablespoonful of butter, 
or two of cocoanut cream, and turn 
into a fancy pudding mold. Stand 
in a cold place to harden. When 
ready to serve, turn on a pretty 
plate, heap whipped cream around, 
garnish with candied violets, and 
serve.

EAST INDIA CHARLOTTE 

Put one pint of milk into a double 
boiler. Moisten four tablespoonfuls 
of cornstarch in a little cold milk, 
add this to the hot milk, cook until 
thick and smooth ; add half cup of 
sugar and one cup of grated cocoa- 
nut; mix and turn into a shallow 
pan to cool. Do not have the mix- 
ture over one inch thick. When 
cold and hard, with a round cutter, 
cut the whole into cakes. Lift each 
carefully and put it on the individual 
dish on which it is to be served. 

Cover quarter box of gelatin with 
quarter cup of cold milk and soak 
ten minutes. Stand over hot water

of thick cream, add three-quarters 
cup of powdered sugar and tea- 
spoonful of vanilla sugar. Make 
the cream icy cold and whip it to a

using a star tube; force it around 
the cakes, in fancy designs. Heap 
blocks of a clear, bright jelly in the 
center, and, when cold again, serve.

CREAM CHERRIES 

Put a half pound of granulated 
sugar and a half cup of water over 
the fire to boil. Stir until the sugar 
is dissolved, then boil carefully until 
you can spin a thread from the tine 
of a fork. Turn on a greased plat- 
ter and when cool (not cold), stir 
with a spoon until it granulates and 
is perfectly white. Scrape the mix- 
ture together and knead it for a mo- 
ment, then put it into a little sauce- 
pan, stand this in another of boiling 
water and stir constantly until it 
melts. If, then, you find it too 
thick, add, drop by drop, sufficient 
water to make it the right consist- 
ency. Have ready your little paper

cases, or a cut-glass dish upon which 
you are going to serve the cherries. 
vSelect red, white and black cherries 
and allow them to remain in bunches 
on the stem. Dip, one at a time, 
carefully into the cream, which must 
be kept hot. Hold for an instant, 
and then heap gracefully on the 
plate, or, if they are single cherries, 
you may place at once in the little 
paper cases. 

All kinds of small fruit are exceed- 
ingly pretty dipped in this way.

CREAM STRAWBERRIES 

Make and melt the cream as 
directed in the preceding recipe. 
Select medium-sized ripe berries. 
Pull the hulls close to the stem, dip 
the berries down into the cream and 
then replace the hull. Put them at 
once into paper cases and stand them 
away for use, or these may also be 
heaped on a cut-glass dish. Straw- 
berries, having a soft outside cover, 
will only keep a few hours. 

Carpels of oranges, white grapes 
— in fact, all kinds of grapes — may 
be served in this way.

STUFFED DATES 

Select the rich, dark dates and 
those that are in good shape. Split 
on one side and carefully remove the 
stone. In the place of the stone put 
quarter of an English walnut. Wrap 
the date over until it looks perfect 
and arrange neatly on a pretty plate. 



CHERRIES IN JELLY 

Select one quart of ripe red cher- 
ries. Stone them carefully, saving 
all the liquor that is lost during ston- 
ing. Put three teaspoonfuls of gran- 
ulated gelatin in a half pint of cold 
water; let it soak while you are

cherry juice to the gelatin. Stir over 
boiling water until the gelatin is 
thoroughly dissolved, and at the 
same time put a cup of sugar over 
the cherries. As soon as the gela- 
tin has thoroughly melted strain it 
carefully over the cherries, mix and 
turn into a fancy mold. Stand away 
for two or three hours until con- 
gealed enough to hold its shape. 
This must not be stiff but just hold 
together.

COMPOTE OF PINEAPPLE 

Peel, and pick apart with a silver 
fork one good-sized, very ripe pine- 
apple. Cover three teaspoonfuls oi 
granulated gelatin with a half cup or 
cold water and soak for five min- 
utes. Cut two good-sized oranges 
into halves, carefully remove the 
seeds, and then, with a spoon, take 
out each little carpel. Mix with the 
pineapple. Turn over this, one cup 
of granulated sugar. Mix until the 
sugar is thoroughly dissolved, then 
heat the gelatin over hot water, add 
it to the pineapple and orange, and 
turn into small individual molds. 
Stand away in a cold place for at 
least two hours. Turn out and

serve, with whipped cream. This 
cannot stand too long, or it will 
become liquid. 



CREAM JELLY 

Put two teaspoonfuls of granu- 
lated gelatin into one pint of cream ; 
add half cup of granulated sugar 
and teaspoonful of vanilla ; stand in 
a cold place for ten minutes. Then 
stir over hot water until the cream 
is sufficiently hot to dissolve the

BAVAROISE 



Cover two teaspoonfuls of gran-

with a teaspoonful of vanilla sugar; 
bring it to scalding point and then 
stand it aside for twenty minutes 
until the cream is thoroughly flavored 
with the vanilla. Add the gelatin to 
this and stir until dissolved. Now, 
mix a half cup of sugar, gradually, 
with the yolks of four eggs. Beat 
until light, add to the cream, and stir 
it over the fire in a double boiler 
until it begins to thicken. Be 
exceedingly careful not to curdle. 
Now strain this into a basin and

When ready to serve, dip the

fruit — raspberries, strawberries oi 
peaches. Turn pudding out in

PISTACH CREAM

Add half cup of powdered sugar, 
four tablespoonfuls of Madeira and 
a half teaspoonful of bitter almond. 
Stand the gelatin over hot water 
until dissolved. Strain it into the 
cream and stir carefully until the 
mixture begins to thicken. Then 
turn into a fancy mold and stand 
away on the ice for two or three 
hours. Remove the hulls from two 
ounces of pistachio nuts and chop 
them very, very fine. Put them in

RICE A L'IMPERATRICE 

Wash a half cup of rice through 
several cold waters, rubbing it well 
in the hands. Let it soak over 
night. Next morning when you are 
ready to make the dessert throw this 
rice into about one pint of boiling 
water. Stand it on the back part 
of the stove where it cannot possi- 
bly boil, and simply steam for thirty 
minutes until the rice is tender, 
white and dry. Turn it into a col- 
ander and drain away the last drop 
of moisture, then throw it on a clean 
towel or napkin, and, with your 
hands, spread it out without break- 
ing the grains. Put three teaspoon- 
fuls of gelatin into half pint of milk 

23 



Dainties 

and let it soak for fifteen minutes. 
Put another half pint of milk, with 
two-thirds of a cup of sugar, into a 
double boiler; add the grated rind 
of one lemen and stir until the milk 
is steaming hot; add the gelatin. 
Now add the rice to this and turn 
into a basin. Stand this in another 
of cracked ice, stir continuously 
until the mixture begins to thicken, 
then add carefully and quickly one 
pint of cream that has been whipped 
to a stiff froth. Turn this mixture 
into a border mold and stand it 
away on the ice. 

If it is the strawberry season, 
have stemmed one quart of fine 
berries. Raspberries, peaches or 
pineapple may be used. The pine- 

24 



t 



Dainties 

apple must be sugared at least a half 
hour before using. When you are 
ready to serve the pudding, turn it 
carefully on a round dish and heap 
I the fruit in the center. If you have 

pineapple, pour the syrup over the 
pudding. If you wish to serve this 
in a solid mold, without fresh fruit, 
after you have turned it on the serv- 
ing dish, add a little hot water to a 
glass of either apple or quince jelly, 
and stir it over the fire until it 
becomes slightly liquid, then turn it 
into a sieve, and hold the sieve over 
the pudding, and with a spoon stir 
until the pudding is covered with 
the jelly. Serve at once.

CARAMEL CUSTARDS 

Take eight small custard cups. 
Put half cup of sugar in a saucepan 
and stir it over the fire until it melts. 
When perfectly liquid and a dark 
straw color, pour in sufficient to 
cover the bottom of each cup. Beat 
three eggs without separating ; add 
four tablespoonfuls of sugar and a 
teaspoonful of vanilla. When well 
mixed, add one and a half cups of 
milk. Beat again and turn this mix- 
ture into the cups on top of the cara- 
mel. Stand the cups in a pan of hot 
water and bake in the oven until the 
custard is set in the center. Take 
from the fire and turn out while hot. 
The better way is to turn each cus- 

26 



Dainties 

tard into a saucer on which it is to 
be served. Stand away until cold, 
and serve. 



CAKE RISSOLES 

Cut stale sponge cake into thin 
slices, then, with a round cutter, 
into cakes about two inches in diam- 
eter. Cover each with almond paste, 
put two together as you would a 
sandwich. Dip quickly in egg and 
crumbs ; fry in hot oil. Serve, with 
pur^e of apricots poured over.

COCOANUT MILK 

Purchase two fresh cocoanuts; 
grate them, put the grated cocoanut 
into a bowl and pour over one quart 
of boiling water. Allow it to stand 
until cool. Then, with your hand, 
press all the liquid out of the cocoa- 
nut. Wring the cocoanut carefully, 
a handful at a time, and put into a 
bowl. Strain the milk thus pro- 
duced through a cheese cloth and 
stand away until the cream comes 
to the surface. This will take about 
two hours. Wash the cocoanut 
with another quart of boiling 
water; proceed as before, strain and 
stand aside. Throw the cocoanut 
away.

CUCUMBER SAUCE 

This sauce is exceedingly nice 
served with either broiled, boiled or 
creamed fish. Peel and grate four 
good-sized cucumbers. Put the 
pulp in a sieve and allow the water 
to drairr carefully away. Then put 
the pulp in a bowl ; add a teaspoon- 
ful of grated onion, dash of cayenne, 
half teaspoonful of salt and, if you 
have it at hand, a tablespoonful of 
chopped green pepper. Turn this 
mixture into the serving dish, add 
four tablespoonfuls of thick cocoa- 
nut cream, tablespoonful of lemon 
juice and it is ready to use.

CEYLON TOMATO SAUCE 

This is a delicious sauce to serve 
with thin, cold roasted beef or 
mutton. Select three good-sized 
solid tomatoes. Remove the skins, 
cut them into halves, press out the 
seeds and stand the tomatoes aside 
until perfectly cold. When ready 
to use, chop them fine, add half 
teaspoonful of salt, grain of red 
pepper and teaspoonful of onion 
juice or grated onion. Mix and put 
into the serving dish. Carefully 
remove the cream from the top of 
the first bowl of cocoanut milk. 
Pour four tablespoonfuls of this 
cream over the tomato ; sprinkle 
over a tablespoonful of lemon juice 

30 



Dainties 

and it is ready to serve. One table- 
spoonful of chopped green pepper, 
and one of green ginger, is an 
improvement. 



CURRIED RICE 

Wash one cup of rice through 
several cold waters, rubbing it well 
between the hands. Then throw it 
into a large kettle of boiling water 
and boil rapidly for thirty minutes. 
Strain in a colander and stand the 
colander in the oven for a few 
minutes until the rice is perfectly 
dry and white. While the rice is 
boiling put two tablespoonfuls of 
butter into a saucepan and add one 

31 



Dainties 

onion, sliced. Stir constantly until 
the onion is a golden color, but not 
brown. Now add a level table- 
spoonful of flour. Mix carefully 
with the butter and add half pint of 
cocoanut milk. Stir until boiling, 
then add a teaspoonful of turmeric, 
teaspoonful of curry, moistened in a 
little cocoanut milk ; bring to boil- 
ing point again, and add a half 
teaspoonful of salt. Dish the rice ; 
strain and curry over, and it is ready 
to serve.

CEYLON TOMATOES 

Scald and peel six solid toma- 
toes. Press out the seeds. Put the 
tomatoes into a saucepan, add a bay 
leaf, a slice of onion, clove or garlic, 
chopped fine. Now cover the 
tomatoes with the cocoanut milk. 
Moisten a teaspoonful of turmeric in 
a little cocoanut milk, add to the 
tomatoes and cover the saucepan. 
Cook slowly for fifteen minutes. 
The tomatoes must remain in perfect 
halves. Have ready the serving 
dish, heated, lift the tomatoes care- 
fully, without breaking, and put 
them on the dish. Now add to the 
sauce one tablespoonful of butter 
and one of flour rubbed together. 

33 



Dainties 

Stir until boiling ; add a teaspoonful 
of salt, quarter of a teaspoonful of 
pepper and two teaspoonfuls of 
l^mon juice. Strain this sauce over 
5 tomatoes and serve. - 



PUREE OF APRICOTS 

Press through a sieve twelve 
^Ives of apricots. Put this in a 
^lucepan, adding half cup of the 
s^-rrained liquor from the can. When 
l^oiling* add one teaspoonful of 
^if-row-root which has been mois- 
tied in a little cold water. Boil a 
oment, take from fire and add two 
blespoonfuls of sherry.

RAGLETS 



Put half pint of water and two 
ounces of butter in a saucepan over 
the fire. When boiling, add four 
ounces of flour ; beat until a ball of 
dough is formed. Take from fire, 
and stand aside to cool. When 
cool, add one egg, without separat- 
ing or beating; mix, add another, 
mix again, and so continue until 
you have added four eggs. Now 
beat four or five minutes. Have 
ready a deep pan of hot fat (oil pref- 
erable). Put the mixture into a 
pastry bag with star tube ; press it 
out into smoking fat, making the 
ragle as nearly as possible the shape 
of small pretzel. Cook on one side, 

35 



Dainties 

then turn and cook the other. Have 
ready a dusting material made from 
a half cup of powdered sugar, one 
teaspoonful of cinnamon and one of 
vanilla sugar. Lift the raglets from 
the fat, drain a moment and then dust 
well with the mixture. These are 
very good and must be served the 
same day on which they are made.

APPETIZERS 

These are served at dinner or luncheon 
in the place of shell-fish, immediately before 
the soup, or they may precede the shell fish. 



Anchovy Canapes 

Mash three anchovies, add a teaspoonful 
of onion juice, the yolk of a hard-boiled 
egg, a dash of pepper and a tablespoonful 
of olive oil. Cut rounds from thin slices 
of brown bread, toast them quickly, spread 
with soft butter, then with the anchovy 
mixture. Garnish with slices of pimolas 
and the white of the egg pressed through a 
vegetable press. Dish on paper mats on a 
heated plate, and send to the table. 



Sardine Canapes 

Make precisely the same as anchovy can- 
apes, using two sardines. 



6 MRS. rorer's dainties 

Caviar Canapes 

Turn the desired quantity of caviar from 
the jar into a little bowl; add a tablespoon- 
ful of lemon juice and a dash of tabasco. 
Have ready a little finely chopped onion and 
hard-boiled egg pressed through a sieve, 
white and yolk separate. Cut rounds or 
squares of bread, toast them quickly, spread 
with butter, then with the caviar mixture, 
garnish with chopped onion and hard-boiled 
egg, and send to the table. 



Tongue Canapes 

Chop two ounces of cold boiled tongue 
very fine; add to it a tablespoonful of olive 
oil, a dash of pepper, a half teaspoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce, and use precisely the 
same as the preceding mixture. 



Oyster Canapes 

Toast brown bread, butter it quickly, 
cover the top neatly with pickled oysters, and 
send at once to the table. 



APPETIZERS 7 

Fish Canapes 

Mince cold boiled fish. To each half 
cupful add a tablespoonful of lemon juice and 
a tablespoonful of olive oil. Rub the spoon 
with garlic, stir the fish, then add a half 
teaspoonful of salt and a dash of tabasco. 
Cut white bread into squares or rounds, 
toast quickly and spread with butter; put 
over it the fish mixture, garnish with pickled 
oyster crabs, and send at once to the table. 

These are the most sightly and elegant 
of the canapes. 



VEGETABLE COCKTAILS 

These, as well as fruit cocktails, are 
served at the beginning of a dinner in the 
place of shell-fish. At a summer luncheon 
they take the place of both shell-fish and 
soup. All sorts of vegetables may be used, 
served in small punch glasses, or in peppers 
with the seeds removed, or in scooped out 
tomatoes, or in apple shells. 

Fruit cocktails are attractive in the rinds 
of oranges, lemons, shaddocks or in apple 
shells. Serve with them both an oyster fork 
and a small spoon. 

Tomato Cocktails 

4 good-sized tomatoes 
2 tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup 
i dash of tabasco 
y 2 teaspoonful of salt 
6 sweet peppers 

i teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce 
i tablespoonful of grated onion 

Peel the tomatoes, cut them into halves, 
press out the seeds; cut the flesh in small 
blocks. Add all the other ingredients and 



VEGETABLE COCKTAILS 



stand them on the ice to cool. At serving 
time cut the bottoms from the peppers, and 
after taking out the seeds, stand them in a 
bowl filled with finely shaved ice; put in 
the tomato "cocktail/' put on the "lid," and 
send to the table. 

String Beans may be boiled, cut into 
small pieces and used in the same way, or 
stuffed into peeled, scooped-out tomatoes. 

In this case the tomato can be eaten; in 
the first case the peppers are not eaten, al- 
though frequently a portion cut off with the 
lid is chopped and mixed with the tomato 
inside. 

Boiled Cauliflower, Asparagus, Jeru- 
salem Artichokes, all make admirable 
"cocktails." Use them in precisely the same 
way, either in punch glasses or in tomatoes 
placed in shallow bowls, partly filled with 
cracked ice. 



FRUIT COCKTAILS 

Orange and Rose Cocktails 

Cut three nice oranges into halves; 
scoop out the pulp and remove the white 
membrane, leaving the shells clean. Wash 
and place them on the ice. To the pulp add 
three level tablespoonfuls of powdered 
sugar, and stand it also on the ice or in a 
cold place. At serving time add to the pulp 
a cupful of mashed rose petals and a tea- 
spoonful of rose water. Fill the shells, put 
a tablespoonful of shaved ice in the center 
of each, dish on dainty paper mats or ferns, 
and serve at once. 

Violet Cocktails 

Peel one very ripe banana, slice and cut 
each slice into halves; add, cut into halves, 
a quarter pound of candied or maraschino 
cherries. Cut three nice oranges into halves ; 
scoop out the pulp; add it and the juice of 
half a lemon to the other ingredients. Stand 
on ice. Prepare the orange shells as in the 



FRUIT COCKTAILS 1 ! 

preceding recipe. At serving lime fill the 
shells, garnish the top with candied violets, 
dish on sprays of maidenhair, and serve. 

Orange cups filled with sliced strawber- 
ries make strawberry cocktails. 

Apple Cocktails 

Cut a slice from the stem end of nice 
red apples, scoop out the flesh, leaving a thin 
wall. Cover both flesh and shells with cold 
water to prevent discoloration. Pare and 
grate a small, very ripe pineapple. Put it 
on ice. At serving time add to it four table- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar, and the apple 
flesh cut into blocks; fill the shells, dish on 
paper mats, and serve. 

East Indian Cocktails 

A DESSERT 

The day before you expect to serve these, 
grate a cocoanut, and pour over it a pint of 
boiling water. Stir it well ; put it in a cloth 
or bag and press thoroughly. Stand the 
milk thus obtained aside to cool. Next day 
cut three or four oranges into halves, scoop 



12 MRS. RORER S DAINTIES 

out the pulp, and prepare the shells as in 
the first recipe. At serving time mix the 
orange pulp with sufficient of the cocoanut 
"cream" to give it a good consistency. Add 
four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, a 
tablespoonful of orange flower water and 
the juice of one lemon; mix and fill the 
shells, cover the top with chopped almonds, 
pistachio nuts or grated macaroons. Dish 
in little nests of any sweet, fresh flowers — 
sweet peas, violets, asparagus vine or scarlet 
rambler. 



PUNCHES 

Cranberry Punch 

Wash one pint of cranberries; add one 
pint of cold water, cover and cook five min- 
utes. Press them through a sieve, add a 
half pint of sugar, and when the mixture 
is cold, freeze it lightly. Serve in glasses, 
with the game or meat course at dinner. 
Currants may be used in place of cran- 
berries. 

Currant Jelly Punch 

Add one pint of boiling water and the 
juice of one lemon to one glass of red cur- 
rant jelly. Stir the mixture over the fire 
until the jelly is thoroughly dissolved. When 
cold, freeze lightly. Beat the white of an 
Qgg until light, add one tablespoonful of 
powdered sugar, beat again, and stir it in 
the frozen punch. Serve in glasses with 
the meat or game course at dinner. 



Grape Punch 

Add the juice of one lemon and a half 
cup of sugar to one pint of grape juice. Mix 
and add a pint of cold water. Freeze and 
serve in glasses with the red meat course at 
dinner. 

Mint Punch 

Pick the leaves from twelve nice stalks 
of mint. Wash, chop and pound them to a 
pulp. Boil together for five minutes a half 
pound of sugar and a pint of water; add 
the mint, stir well and cool. When cold, 
add the juice of two lemons, and freeze. 
Serve in glasses with lamb or mutton at 
dinner. 

Ginger Punch 

Slice or chop a quarter pound of can- 
died ginger, add a quart of water, soak it 
two hours and simmer for thirty minutes; 
add a half pint of sugar and the juice of 
two lemons. When cold, freeze and serve 
in glasses with the meat course at dinner. 

Plain frozen ginger ale is also nice. 



PUNCHES 15 

All dinner punches are made in the same 
way; they must not be very sweet, espe- 
cially when served with red meats. 



Watermelon Punch 

Cut the stem end from a ripe melon and 
scoop out all the pulp, leaving the rind nice 
and evenly cleaned inside. Cut a very thin 
slice from the blossom end, stand the "shell'' 
in a deep chop plate and surround it with 
dainty flowers and greens. Remove all 
seeds and mash the pulp, add to it a pint of 
orange juice and a cup of powdered sugar. 
Freeze, turning the crank very slowly. 
Serve in the shell, using it the same as a 
punch bowl. This is nice for little after- 
noon affairs. Pass lady fingers or rolled 
wafers. 



1 6 MRS. rorer's dainties 

Orange Punch 

1 pound of sugar 

2 lemons 

i quart of water 

6 oranges 

2 tablespoonfuls of granulated gelatin 

Put the sugar, water and grated lemon 
and one orange rind and the gelatin in a 
saucepan; let them stand for fifteen minutes, 
and then stir over the fire until the mixture 
reaches the boiling point ; take from the fire, 
and when cool add the juice of the lemons 
and oranges and a bottle of ginger ale ; strain 
the mixture, turn it into the freezing can, 
and stir it now and then until frozen like 
wet snow. 

Serve in punch glasses at afternoon teas 
or evening affairs, or as a punch course at 
dinner. 

Strawberry Frappe 

I quart of mashed strawberries 

Juice of one orange 
i quart of water 
i pound of sugar 

Mash the berries, add the orange juice, 
sugar and water, and stand aside for an 



PUNCHES 1 7 

hour; then stir until the sugar is thor- 
oughly dissolved. This can be partly frozen 
as in the preceding recipe, or made icy cold 
by adding shaved ice at serving time. Serve 
at afternoon or evening affairs. 



Jamaica Ginger Punch 

I two-ounce bottle of the best Jamaica ginger 

l / 2 ounce of cream of tartar 

Yz pound of sugar 

i Grated yellow rind and juice of a lemon 

i quart of water 

Add the sugar and the grated rind of 
the lemon to the water, bring to boiling 
point and cool; strain, add the lemon juice 
and the Jamaica ginger; turn into the 
freezer, stir slowly until frozen like wet 
snow. 

This is exceedingly nice for a lawn party 
during hot weather. Serve with it choco- 
late or plain wafers. 



1 8 MRS. rorer's dainties 

Lemon Squash 

1 lemon 

]/z pint of soda or seltzer 

2 rounding teaspoonfuls of powdered sugar 

Roll the lemon in the sugar. The better 
way to do this is to put the sugar on paper 
and then roll the lemon on it; brush off 
that which sticks to the outside. Put the 
sugar in a tumbler, add the juice of the 
lemon, strained, then the soda or seltzer 
from a siphon, and serve at once. 

Grape Squash 

I quart of grape juice 
y 2 cupful of powdered sugar 
4 bottles of soda, or 2 siphons of seltzer 

The better way to serve this is to get 
four or five siphons of soda, seltzer or Vichy 
at the drug store, put the sweetened grape 
juice in a pitcher, pour the tumbler half full, 
and fill it up with the carbonated waters. 



PUNCHES 19 

Combination Squash 

This is one of the nicest of all the 
squashes. It can easily be served for an 
evening card party or an afternoon recep- 
tion. For the latter, however, I should use 
a punch bowl. 

Grate the yellow rind of three oranges 
into two pounds of sugar, add one quart of 
water, bring to a *boil, boil five minutes, 
strain and cool. Add the juice of the 
oranges, the juice of three lemons, one 
grated pineapple, one pound of powdered 
sugar and one teaspoonful of vanilla. At 
serving time pour this into your punch bowl 
over a block of ice; or, for a small party, 
put it into a pitcher, pour it into tumblers 
of cracked ice, fill the tumblers with soda 
water and serve at once. In the punch bowl 
add the soda or Apollinaris at the last min- 
ute, just at serving time. 



20 

Tea Punch 

6 lemons 

2 oranges 

2 pounds of sugar 

i teaspoonful of almond extract 

2 ripe red bananas 

4 tablespoonfuls of English breakfast tea 

3 quarts of Apollinaris 
I pint of ginger ale 

Put the tea into a pitcher and pour over 
one quart of the water, boiling hot; cover 
and stand aside for twenty minutes and 
strain. Add the grated yellow rinds of 
three lemons, and the oranges, to the sugar, 
and add the remaining two quarts of water. 
Stir until the sugar is dissolved, boil five 
minutes, strain and cool. To this add the 
orange and lemon juice and the almond 
extract. When very, very cold, and ready 
to serve, turn it into the punch bowl over a 
block of ice; add the ginger ale, and, if 
you like, a few white grapes or other fresh 
fruit, cut into small bits, 



PUNCHES 21 

Lemon Syrup 

This is exceedingly nice to make when 
lemons are plentiful, to be put aside to use 
during the summer months. Squeeze suffi- 
cient lemons to make one quart of strained 
juice. Put six pounds of sugar into a por- 
celain lined kettle. Beat the whites of two 
eggs until they are quite light, and then stir 
into them one quart of cold water; stir this 
into the sugar, and stir until the sugar is 
dissolved. Place the kettle over the fire, 
bring quickly to a boil, and boil and skim 
until no scum can be seen on the surface. 
Add the lemon juice, stand the kettle over 
a moderate fire, where it will just bubble, 
for fifteen minutes, and then stand it aside 
to cool. Have ready perfectly sterile bot- 
tles — bottles that have been put in cold 
water and brought to the boiling point. 
Have the corks also in boiling water. Fill 
the bottles to within two inches of the top 
of the neck with the hot syrup, put in the 
corks and hammer them down ; dip them at 
once into sealing wax and stand aside in a 
cool place. 



22 MRS. RORER'S DAINTIES 

Strawberry Syrup 

Select fine, fresh, perfect berries; mash 
them and squeeze them in cheese cloth. To 
each quart of this allow one quart of sugar. 
Put the juice in the preserving kettle, add 
the sugar, stir until the sugar is dissolved, 
and boil two minutes. Fill into sterilized 
bottles, cork, put the bottles down in a kettle 
of hot water so that they will be entirely 
covered, boil fifteen minutes, dip the corks 
at once into sealing wax, and put aside. 

Raspberry and currant juice, blackberry 
or grape juice, may be made in the same 
way to use for pudding sauces, ice cream or 
the various punches. 



Horse Neck 

Pare a lemon around and around with- 
out breaking the peel; put it, in the shape 
of a corkscrew, in a long tumbler, and fill 
the tumbler with cold ginger ale. 



PUNCHES 23 

William's Medley 

Wash a good-sized pineapple; chop it 
fine without peeling, put it in three quarts 
of cold water, bring to a boil; boil for 
thirty minutes, and press as much as you 
can through a sieve. To this liquid add 
one pound of sugar, boil ten minutes after 
it begins to boil, cool, add one cupful of 
lemon juice and two cupfuls of strawberry 
or raspberry juice. When cold pour this 
over a block of ice, and at serving time add 
Apollinaris to make it palatable. 



Mint Phosphate 

1 bunch of mint 
]/ 2 cupful of powdered sugar 
1 or 2 lemons 

Phosphate 

Chopped candied cherries 

It is better to make this immediately in 
the tumblers. Have the mint washed and 
chopped rather fine, put a teaspoonful in the 
bottom of each tumbler, put on top two or 
three tablespoonfuls of ice, powdered sugar, 
a dash of lemon juice, a dash of phosphate, 
and fill up with cold water. 



24 MRS. RORER S DAINTIES 

Egg Fizz 

Put two tablespoonfuls of fruit syrup 
into a glass, add two or three tablespoonfuls 
of finely cracked ice, drop in one whole egg, 
and fill the glass half full of milk. Shake 
until thoroughly mixed, then fill up with 
soda water. 

Cold Coffee 

This is exceedingly nice for a warm 
evening, where people are fond of coffee. 
Prepare quite strong coffee in the French 
fashion, drain it from the grounds, sweeten 
to taste, and stand aside to cool. At serving 
time fill tall glasses half full of finely shaved 
ice, pour over the coffee, beat rapidly for a 
moment with a spoon, cover with whipped 
cream, and serve at once. 

Chocolate may be used in the same way. 

Half and Half 

This is one of the nicest of the hot- 
weather drinks. If it is to be served at an 
ordinary table, I should put a bottle of gin- 
ger ale and a split of Apollinaris at each 



PUNCHES 25 

plate, cr put a block of ice into a large, pref- 
erably glass, pitcher, put in two bottles of 
good ginger ale, add a pint of Apollinaris, 
and serve at once. The rule is to use one 
split of Apollinaris (this is a half pint) to 
each bottle of ginger ale. Put the ginger 
ale in the pitcher or glass first, and then add 
the Apollinaris. 

Mint Frappe 

2 good-sized bunches of mint 
6 lemons 

2 pounds of sugar 
1 quart of water 
Apollinaris 

Wash the mint, remove the leaves from 
the stems, chop them fine and pound them 
in a mortar, or rub them in a bowl. Add 
these to the water and then stir them into 
the sugar. Bring to a boil and strain. 
When cool, add the juice of the lemons, and 
if the color is too pale, add a drop of green 
vegetable coloring. Stand aside until very 
cold. At serving time fill the punch bowl 
quarter full of shaved ice, pour over the 
mint syrup, add one or two bottles of Apol- 
linaris, and serve. 



26 MRS. RORER'S DAINTIES 

Pop 

y 2 gallon of water 
y 2 pound of sugar 

i white of an egg 

2 ounces of Jamaica ginger 

i lemon 

i teaspoonful of gelatin 
Yz compressed yeast cake 

Beat the white of the egg, add a pint of 
water, then add the sugar and juice of the 
lemon. Bring this to a boil, and skim. 
When cool, add the ginger, the gelatine 
moistened in cold water, and the remaining 
water. Add the yeast cake, moistened ; mix 
thoroughly. Let it stand one hour, bottle, 
and tie down the corks. 



English Mead 

y 2 ounce of hops 
2 pounds of strained honey 
y 2 gallon of water 
y 2 compressed yeast cake 
The juice of two lemons 

Boil the hops and water together for a 
half hour, strain and add the honey and 
lemon juice. Boil for another half hour, 
cool to lukewarm, add the veast, bottle, tie 



PUNCHES 27 

down the corks and stand in a cold place. 
This will be ready to use in twenty-four to 
thirty-six hours. 

Apple Juice 

Wash tart apples, quarter and remove 
the cores. Put the quarters in a porcelain 
lined kettle, add water to prevent scorching, 
cover the kettle, boil and stir until the apples 
are thoroughly cooked. Turn them into a 
muslin bag and drain over night. Next 
morning select your bottles and corks, put 
them in water and bring to the boiling point. 
Boil the juice, skim it, and fill it, while hot, 
into the hot bottles. Cork the bottles, put 
them at once into a boiler of hot water, cover 
the boiler, and boil a half hour. Lift the 
bottles, dip the corks at once into sealing 
wax, and stand in your preserve closet for 
keeping. This is much better than cider for 
a winter drink. 



CAKES 

Chocolate Macaroons 

4 whites of eggs 
]/ 2 pound of powdered sugar 
2 ounces of grated chocolate

that has been slightly oiled, and when cool, 
not cold, stir with a spoon until it becomes 
perfectly white and creamy. Knead the 
mixture for a moment; then put it in a 
small saucepan, stand this in another of 
boiling water, and stir continuously until 
the "fondant" melts. If then it seems too 
thick, add, drop by drop, a little boiling 
water until it is the right consistency to 
"ice" the fruit. Have ready little paper 
cases or oiled paper. Select perfect red, 
white and black cherries. If you allow them 
to remain in bunches, see that each cherry 
is dry and clean. Dip one at a time in the 
hot cream or icing, and put it aside to dry. 
If you wish to ice three or four cherries on 
a single bunch and have each one a differ- 
ent color, separate the fondant and flavor 
and color to taste; for instance, add a drop 
of bitter almond with green, red with rose, 
vanilla with white, chocolate or coffee with 
brown, and yellow with orange. If you dip 
one cherry in vanilla, hold until dry, which 
will take but a moment, then dip the second 
in orange, the third in rose, and so on. 



SIMPLE CANDIES 59 

Creamed Strawberries 

Make and melt the fondant as in the 
preceding recipe. Select medium-sized ripe 
berries; pull the hulls close to the stem, dip 
the berries in the fondant, replace the hulls 
and put at once in paper cases, or stand 
them on oiled paper to dry. Serve heaped 
on a cut-glass dish. 

Strawberries, having a soft outside cov- 
ering, not a skin like cherries, will keep 
only a few hours. 

Creamed Oranges 

The carpels of oranges or mandarins 
must be separated carefully, not broken. 
Dip them in white or orange "fondant." 
These are usually placed in paper cases 
made for the purpose. 

Creamed White Grapes 

Cut white grapes from the bunch, leav- 
ing a bit of stem on each grape. By this 
stem dip the grapes in fondant, and place 
at once in paper cases. All small fruits may 
be dipped in the same manner.

Stuffed Dates 

y pound of almonds 
*4 pound of pine nuts 
34 pound of pecans 
y pound of Brazilian nuts 
2 pounds of dates 

Blanch and dry the almonds; shell and 
peel the Brazilian nuts; wash and dry the 
pine nuts; mix all the nuts and put them 
through a nut grinder or a fine meat chop- 
per; add sufficient rock candy or plain 
syrup, or, if you use wine, a little sherry or 
maraschino, to bind the whole together. 
Remove the stones from the dates, put in 
a goodly quantity of mixed nuts, put on top 
another date, and press the two together. 
One stuffed date takes two dates, and is 
the width of a date spread open. Roll in 
granulated sugar, place between layers of 
waxed paper, and keep in a cool place. 



Stuffed Figs 

Cut pulled or preserved figs into halves, 
scoop out a portion of the inside, mix it 
with nuts prepared as in the preceding 
recipe, and stuff the figs. 



SIMPLE CANDIES 6 1 

Stuffed Prunes 

Wiesbaden or French prunes may be 
stuffed in the same way. To make the 
prunes exceedingly nice, purchase the Wies- 
baden prunes and take out the stuffing, a 
small prune inside, chop it and three pre- 
served or brandied figs with the nuts, and 
fill the large prune from the end. 



Syrup of Roses 

Pick sufficient petals from any of the 
large sweet roses to make one pound; 
pour over them a quart of boiling water, 
cover and let stand over night. Bring to 
boiling point; turn them in a piece of 
cheese cloth and wring perfectly dry. Add 
to this water another pound of fresh rose 
leaves, let them stand over night, then 
bring to boiling point, press and wring 
again. To this add four pounds of loaf 
sugar and ten grains of cream of tartar, 
bring slowly to a boil, and boil without stir- 
ring until it forms a thin syrup. Bottle for 
use. 



62 MRS. RORER's DAINTIES 

This may be used as flavoring for all 
kinds of desserts and creams. 

Violets may be used in the same way. 

Rose Conserves 

2 pounds of rose leaves 
i pound of loaf sugar 
Yi pint of water 

Pick and look over the rose leaves. Boil 
the water and sugar with a saltspoonful of 
cream of tartar until the syrup spins a 
thread. Add the leaves, take from the fire 
and stir until the sugar granulates; quickly 
break apart the conserves and dry on a 
sieve. 

Manipulate violets the same way. 



Divinity Fudge 

2 cupfuls of granulated sugar 
i cupful of golden syrup 
I cupful of water 
i cupful of nut meats 

Mix the sugar and water, and stir in the 
syrup. Stand this over the fire and boil,

hard ball when dropped into cold water. 
Pour, while hot, into the well-beaten whites 
of two eggs, beating all the time. Stand 
the bowl in a pan of cold water, and beat 
until the mixture will harden quickly when 
dropped from a spoon on oiled paper. Then 
stir in one cupful of chopped nut meats. 

To give variety, at one time stir in a 
half cupful of chopped nuts and one cupful 
of chopped dates or cherries, or any other 
conserved fruits. This mixture may be 
poured into square, lightly greased pans, 
and when cold cut into cubes, or it may be 
dropped by spoonfuls on greased paper.

Put the sugar, water, butter and cream 
into a saucepan and stir until the sugar is 
dissolved, then stir constantly until the mix- 
ture is thoroughly hot, then boil, without 



64 mrs. rorer's dainties 

stirring, until it forms a soft ball when 
dropped into cold water. Take it from the 
fire and stir until the mixture begins to 
grain, then add quickly the nuts and flavor- 
ing, and drop by spoonfuls on buttered 
paper. 



DAINTIES TO TAKE THE 
PLACE OF CANDIES 

Fruit Marguerites 

Put through the meat chopper a small 
quantity of candied cherries, candied pine- 
apple, apricots and figs; add sufficient 
orange juice to moisten. Finish as directed 
in the preceding recipe. 

Nut Marguerites 

Blanch and dry a quarter pound of 
almonds ; wash and dry a quarter pound of 
pine nuts; add to them a pound of shelled 
and peeled Brazilian nuts and the same 
amount of grated cocoanut; put the mix- 
ture through a nut grinder or a very fine 
meat chopper. Beat the white of one egg 
until fairly light ; add two tablespoonf uls of 
powdered sugar, and beat again. Add this 
to the nuts, mix thoroughly. Spread on 
"water thins," Roquefort biscuits or any 
unsweetened crackers. Beat the whites of 
four eggs until light; add four tablespoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar, and beat again 



66 MRS. rorer's dainties 

until fine and dry. Spread a thin layer over 
the top of the nuts, dust with powdered 
sugar, and brown in a moderate oven. 

These are nutritious, wholesome, and 
may be served in place of cake or pie. 

Fruit Sandwiches 

Stone a half pound of dates, mix with 
them an equal quantity of pulled figs or 
French prunes, stoned; put them through 
a meat chopper; add sufficient orange juice 
to moisten, and spread between slices of 
bread and butter. Cut the slices in rounds, 
triangles or fingers. 

These are nice to serve with chocolate 
at afternoon or evening affairs. 

Chocolate Crackers 

These are made by dipping tiny round 
oyster crackers or very light, small biscuits 
into chocolate fondant. 

Chocolettes are made in precisely the 
same way, using opera wafers broken into 
halves. Crackers, being free from sugar, 
make an exceedingly pleasant cake when 
dipped in fondant. 



DESSERTS 

White Marmalade 

2 pounds of quinces 

I pound of sugar 

i tumbler of quince jelly 

Pare the quinces, core and cut in thin 
slices. Put them into a preserving kettle, 
cover with the sugar, add a half cup of 
water, cover and stew slowly until the 
quinces are perfectly tender. Add the jelly, 
press through a sieve, put into tumblers, 
and when cold, cover with melted paraffin. 

Cherries in Jelly 

i quart of ripe red cherries 

y 2 pint of cold water 

i level tablespoonful of granulated gelatin 

i cupful of sugar 

i lemon's juice 

Stone the cherries, saving the liquor 
that drops from them during the stoning. 
Cover the gelatin with the cold water, and 
soak for fifteen minutes; add the cherry 
juice, and stand it over hot water to dis- 



68 MRS. rorer's dainties 

solve the gelatin; add the sugar and lemon 
juice, and stir until it is dissolved. If the 
cherries are rather dry, and you have not at 
least a half cup of cherry juice, make up that 
quantity by adding hot water. Strain the 
gelatin over the cherries, turn them into a 
fancy mold, and stand away for two or three 
hours to harden. 

They should not be stiff, but just firm 
enough to hold together. Serve plain with 
sponge cake, 

Compote of Pineapple 

1 good-sized pineapple 
y 2 cupful of cold water 

2 good-sized oranges 

2 tablespoonfuls granulated gelatin 
I cupful of granulated sugar

pineapple, rejecting the core. Cover the 
gelatin with cold water to soak for fifteen 
minutes. Cut the oranges into halves, re- 
move the seeds and with a spoon scoop out 
the pulp, and add it to the pineapple. Then 
add the sugar; stir occasionally until the 
sugar is dissolved. Stand the gelatin over 



DESSERTS 69 

hot water until dissolved, strain it in the 
pineapple; turn into small individual molds 
and stand aside in a very cold place for at 
least two hours. 

This mixture cannot stand all night ; the 
pineapple will digest the gelatin and the mix- 
ture will become liquid. At serving time 
turn the compote on dainty small dishes, 
whip the cream to a stiff froth, heap it 
around the compotes, and send to the table. 

Compote of Pears and Cherries 

6 pears

from liquor; put the liquor over the fire, 
add the sugar and cochineal, and the arrow- 
root moistened; stir until the mixture is 
as thick as cream and transparent. Cut 
pieces of bread the shape of a half pear; 
drop them in a small quantity of hot oil; 
when brown on one side, turn and quickly 



JO MRS. RORER S DAINTIES 

brown the other; drain on soft paper. Ar- 
range these on a round heated dish. Put 
the pears for a moment in the hot syrup; 
lift the halves carefully, put them on the 
toast, points in, leaving a space in the center 
about the size of a small saucer. Put a 
quarter pound of candied or glazed cher- 
ries in the boiling syrup, boil for a moment, 
and then add a slice of pineapple, candied 
or fresh ; when this is smoking hot, put the 
pineapple in the center of the dish, heap the 
cherries on top, cannon-ball fashion; baste 
over the syrup and send at once to the table. 

A Compote of Apples or Peaches may 
be made in the same fashion. 



Cherry Compote 

Stone a pint of sour cherries. Boil a 
cupful of rice; drain, have it perfectly dry, 
each grain separate, and arrange it in the 
form of a bed or mound in the center of the 
serving dish. Add to the cherries a cupful of 
sugar, put them in a saucepan, toss them 
carefully until they reach the boiling point, 
and put them around the rice. If you ar- 



DESSERTS 71 

range the rice in a border, put the cherries 
in the center. Serve warm. 

Currants may be substituted for cher- 
ries and served in the same fashion. 



Rice Compotes 

These dishes or sweet entrees are all 
made from carefully boiled rice, garnished 
with different kinds of fruit. One may use 
canned, preserved, candied or fresh fruits. 



Compote of Pineapple with Rice 

Pare and remove the eyes from the pine- 
apple; pick it apart with a silver fork, be- 
ginning at the stem end. Add a half cup 
of sugar, put it in a saucepan on the back 
part of the stove, bring slowly to the boiling 
point. Have ready a cupful of rice carefully 
boiled; put it in the center of a round or 
oblong plate, pour the pineapple over it, and 
send at once to the table. Serve plain or 
with whipped cream.

stiff froth. Turn the mixture in a border 
mold, and stand on the ice to harden. At 
serving time dip the mold in hot water, and 
quickly turn the rice on a round dish, fill 
the center with the strawberries, dust with 
powdered sugar, and serve. 

Raspberries, Peaches and Pineapple 
may be used in the same way. 

This dessert may also be served without 
fruit. Turn the mixture into a fancy pud- 
ding mold and stand it on the ice to harden. 
At serving time plunge the mold in hot

DESSERTS 79 

a shallow baking pan that has been dipped 
in cold water, and stand aside to cool. The 
mixture should not be over a half inch thick. 
When cold and hard, cut the whole in rounds 
with an ordinary cake cutter; lift each 
round carefully with a broad knife, and 
place it on a paper mat in the individual 
dish on which it is to be served. While 
these are cooling, cover the gelatin with a 
quarter cup of cold milk, and soak for 
fifteen minutes. Stand this over hot water 
until dissolved; add it to one pint of good, 
thick, sweet cream ; add the powdered sugar 
and a teaspoonful of vanilla. When this is 
icy cold, whip it to a stiff froth. Put the 
mixture into a pastry bag having a half-inch

80 MRS. rorer's dainties 

in carefully the well-beaten whites of the 
eggs, and last a quarter pound of pastry 
flour that has been sifted two or three times ; 
turn the batter carefully in a Turk's head, 
and bake in a moderately quick oven for 
thirty minutes. When thoroughly done, turn 
the cake on a sieve, and when cold, cover 
it with chocolate icing. When the icing is 
cold, remove a slice from the top of the cake 
and take out the entire inside, leaving a wall 
three-quarters of an inch in thickness at the 
bottom and sides. When ready to serve, 
fill this space with chocolate charlotte, re- 
place the slice on the top, dish on a large 
lace paper mat, and send to the table. 

This may be varied by using angels' 
food or sunshine cake, filled with plain char- 
lotte russe, using plain vanilla icing, which 
may be thickly dusted with chopped almonds 
or pistachio nuts. An angels' food filled 
with charlotte russe, iced, and garnished 
with chopped pistachio nuts, the base gar- 
nished with preserved green English wal- 
nuts, is one of the most sightly and attract- 
ive of all desserts.

SOME OTHER BOOKS 
Published by 

Arnold and Company 



Mrs. Rorer's 
NEW Cook Book 

A big book of 731 pages, abundantly illustrated. Its 
bigness is no criterion of its goodness. The fact that 
it is the best work of the best years of Mrs. Rorer's 
life; that it is a complete new book telling of the things 
one needs to know about cooking, living, health, and 
the easiest and best way of housekeeping — these are 
what make for goodness, and place this book far in 
advance of any other of a like nature. 

The New Cook Book covers all departments of 
cookery. A masterly exposition of each subject is 
given, followed by recipes for the proper preparation, 
cooking and serving of the various kinds of foods. 
There are over 1500 recipes in the book. 

The illustrations are an important feature. One 
set of pictures shows the proper dressing of the table 
during a course dinner. Then there is a complete set 
showing the method of carving meats, poultry, game, 
etc.; and many others illustrating special features of 
the book.

Mrs. Rorer's 

Philadelphia Cook Book 

This is the standard book of Mrs. Rorer's that has 
been before the public for a number of years. It has 
no connection with Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book. 
Each book is independent of the other, and the posses- 
sion of one forms no reason for doing without the 
other. 

The Philadelphia Cook Book is full of good things, 
and, like all of Mrs. Rorer's works, is eminently prac- 
tical. It is a standard of excellence, in that it is 
full of the brightest things in cookery; the recipes 
are absolutely reliable, and the general instructions 
to housekeepers of the most helpful and necessary 
character. 

Nearly all cook books assume some knowledge and 
experience on the part of those who use them, but Mrs. 
Rorer makes her explanations so clear, and gives such 
definite directions, as to quantities, that the beginner 
has no difficulty in successfully accomplishing all the 
book calls for. Then there are frequent hints as to 
the proper use of left-overs, how to market, and, in 
many ways, information is given that is alike useful to 
the experienced cook as to the tyro in matters culinary. 

The book is full of choice recipes, every one of 
which has been successfully tested by Mrs. Rorer and 
found to come out right. This alone is of incalculable 
benefit and ought to commend the book to the favorable 
consideration of every housekeeper. 

The use of this book in the home means better 
health, better living, economy in the use of food, and 
a consequent saving in dollars and cents.

Mrs. Borer's 

Vegetable Cookery and Meat 

Substitutes 

This book has a twofold object: 

i. To show the value of vegetables in their relation to 
diet and health, how to prepare, cook and serve 
them, what to eat under certain conditions of health, 
and thus have them perform their proper work. 

2. To give to the prudent housewife a knowledge of 
combinations of foods in the shape of toothsome 
recipes to take the place of meat, or as we call 
them — Meat Substitutes. 

It goes without saying that we all know too little 
about the value of vegetables as food. We eat them 
because they are palatable, not realizing their immense 
importance as body builders. Here they are classified, 
and thus made to give us a right idea of their use. 

Then as to Meat Substitutes. It is not necessary 
to be a vegetarian to desire a change from a meat diet. 
There are health reasons often demanding abstention 
from meats ; or economy may be an impelling motive ; 
or a desire for change and variety in the daily bill of 
fare may be warrant enough. However we look at it 
here is the wonder book to point the way to better and 
healthier living. 

There is an abundance of the choicest and most 
palatable recipes, and they are given in such a manner, 
that if the directions are followed, the results are sure. 
You cannot make mistakes.

Mrs. Rorer's 
Every Day Menu Book 

In the course of her teaching and editorial work, 
there have come to Mrs. Rorer frequent requests for 
a book that will provide a daily bill of fare, one that 
will be at once rational, its directions easy of accom- 
plishment, and give an excellent variety. Hence this 
Menu Book. 

It contains a menu for every meal in the year, 
systematically arranged by months and days ; menus for 
special occasions, such as holidays, weddings, luncheons, 
teas, etc.; illustrations of decorated tables for various 
social events, with appropriate menus; menus arranged 
for the seasons both as to food and decorations; a 
department of menus without meats. A fine volume 
that ought to commend itself to every housekeeper.

cloth $1.50 net; by mail, $1.65 

Mrs. Rorer's 
Cakes, Icings and Fillings 

Every one is interested" in the cake problem. There 
is possibly no item in the home bill of fare on which 
a woman prides herself as the ability to make a good 
cake. But how to add variety to the goodness ? Here's 
the book to help. Contains a large number of enticing 
and valuable recipes for cakes of all sorts and condi- 
tions. Some need filling, some need icing — well, here 
you have all the necessary information. Best of all, 
there is no fear as to results. Follow the directions 
and your cake is bound to come out right.

Mrs. Rorer's 
Canning and Preserving 

The only book on the subject worth the name. In 
it Mrs. Rorer discusses at length the canning and pre- 
serving of fruits and vegetables, with the kindred 
subjects of marmalades, butters, fruit jellies and syrups, 
drying and pickling. The recipes are clearly and simply 
given. In the new edition now presented, the author 
has brought the book up to date, and has included 
many new, rare and original recipes that have been 
accumulating since the book was first introduced. It 
has always been a favorite book with the public, and 
now it will be doubly welcome.

Mrs. Rorer's 
My Best 250 Recipes 

It would be strange indeed if, out of the multitude 
of recipes Mrs. Rorer has invented and used during 
her long career as a teacher, writer and lecturer, she 
did not have some that appealed to her more strongly 
than others. She has gathered these together, classi- 
fying them under their different heads. There are Best 
20 Soups ; Best 20 Fish Recipes ; Best 20 Meats ; Best 
20 Salads ; Best 20 Desserts ; Best 20 Sauces, Vegeta- 
bles, Fruit Preserves, Luncheon Dishes, Ices, Summer 
Recipes, Left Overs, Game and Poultry, Breads and 
Biscuits, etc.

Mrs. Rover's New Salads 

For Dinners, Luncheons, Suppers and Receptions. 
With a group of Odd Salads and some Ceylon Salads. 

A salad made from a succulent green vegetable and 
French dressing, should be seen on the dinner table 
in every well-regulated household three hundred and 
sixty-five times a year. These green vegetables contain 
the salts necessary to the well being of our blood; the 
oil is an easily-digested form of fatty matter ; the lemon 
juice gives us sufficient acid; therefore simple salads 
are exceedingly wholesome. 

During the summer, the dinner salad may be com- 
posed of any well-cooked green vegetable, served with 
a French dressing; string beans, cauliflower, a mixture 
of peas, turnips, carrots and new beets, boiled radishes, 
cucumbers, tomatoes, uncooked cabbage, and cooked 
spinach. In the winter serve celery, lettuce, endive and 
chicory.

Mrs. Rorer's Dainties 

Possibly no part of the daily bill of fare so taxes 
the ingenuity of the housewife as the dessert, that final 
touch to the meal that lingers in the palate like a bene- 
diction. We tire of constant repetitions of familiar 
things. We want variety. Why not have it when 
there are so many ways and means of gratifying our 
tastes. Mrs. Rorer has given here a number of choice 
things covering quite a range of possibilities.

Mrs. Rorer's 
Many Ways for Cooking Eggs 

Did you ever reflect what an important part eggs 
play in our domestic economy ? When from any reason 
other things fail, the perplexed housewife knows she 
can do something to tide over her difficulties by the 
use of eggs. But how many know the great possibilities 
that lie in an egg — the very many ways of cooking and 
preparing them for the table? To many, boiled, fried, 
poached and scrambled form the limit of their knowl- 
edge. But get this book and you'll be surprised at the 
feast in store for you. You'll also find recipes for 
delectable Egg Sauces.

Mrs. Rorer's 
Made-Over Dishes 

How to transform the left overs into palatable and 
wholesome dishes. With many new and valuable 
recipes. 
We quote from the author's introduction: 

"Economical marketing does not mean the purchase 
of inferior articles at a cheap price, but of a small 
quantity of the best materials found in the market; 
these materials to be wisely and economically used. 
Small quantity and no waste, just enough and not a 
piece too much, is a good rule to remember. In roasts 
and steaks, however, there will be, in spite of careful 
buying, bits left over, that if economically used, may 
be converted into palatable, sightly and wholesome 
dishes for the next day's lunch or supper.

Mrs. Rorer's 
How to Use a Chafing Dish 

Of all the useful and dependable articles of food, 
commend us to the Sandwich. Nothing in the whole 
range of foods presents such a wonderful opportunity 
for variety. The sandwich is the handy thing for 
suppers, teas, social calls, school lunch baskets, picnics — 
but where can you not use it to advantage and enjoy- 
ment? In this book Mrs. Rorer has given a lot of new, 
original recipes, with some very odd ones. She has 
drawn upon her wonderful knowledge and inventive 
faculty and the result is a bewildering array of delect- 
able sandwiches.

Mrs. Rorer s Sandwiches 

It is wonderful the amount of pleasure and satis- 
faction that can be had with a Chafing Dish. Few 
people know how to use one successfully, although the 
art is easily acquired. This book, for instance, gives 
the proper directions for making hosts of good things, 
and if they are followed implicitly, the most inexperi- 
enced person can be sure of results. It is a handy 
thing in an emergency, and it forms a delightful adjunct 
to a supper or dinner. Guests are always interested in 
watching the evolution of some delectable dish, and 
the head of the table has a chance to show his or 
her skill.

Hot Weather Dishes 

Its name tells the whole story. It is the only book

the inventive faculty of even the best housekeepers, 
and at a season when the appetite needs every help 
and encouragement, this book will be found of the 
greatest use.
