In the art of cooking the "Old Southern Mammy" has

The following recipes have, with great patience and 
kindly perseverance, been drawn from the treasured mem- 
ories of Aunt Caroline Pickett, a famous old Virginia cook,

fully and mysteriously combined by the culinary masters of

and recorded in this volume, and after a practical test of each 
recipe herein presented, the author can, with the fullest de- 
griee of confidence, recommend the following as the most at- 
tractive and economical combination ever presented. 

The variety covers a range sufficient to fully gratify the 
demands of the modest as well as the exacting tastes of the 
most pronounced epicure, and have been carefully classified 
and alphabetically arranged for the convenience of the house- 
wife, and a page has been left blank opposite each page of 
recipes for her own favorite dishes. It is the author's in- 
tention that this little book become a veritable treasure trove

may be used. After beating the dough, put it into a vessel 
to rise in warm place for about three hours. When risen, 
roll it lightly until about one-fourth of an inch thick. Then 
cut with biscuit cutter and dip into hot grease. Lastly fold 
the biscuits over and put into pans to rise about an hour or 
more.

Foreword 

In the art of cooking the "Old Southern Mammy" has 
few equals and recogonizes no peers. 

The following recipes have, with great patience and 
kindly perseverance, been drawn from the treasured mem- 
ories of Aunt Caroline Pickett, a famous old Virginia cook, 
the "pinch of this" and "just a smacker of that" so wonder- 
fully and mysteriously combined by the culinary masters of 
the Southland have been carefully and scientifically ana\yzed 
and recorded in this volume, and after a practical test of each 
recipe herein presented, the author can, with the fullest de- 
gTiee of confidence, recommend the following as the most at- 
tractive and economical combination ever presented. 

The variety covers a range sufficient to fully gratify the 
demands of the modest as well as the exacting tastes of the 
most pronounced epicure, and have been carefully classified 
and alphabetically arranged for the convenience of the house- 
;wife, and a page has been left blank opposite each page of 
recipes for her own favorite dishes. It is the author's in- 
tention that this little book become a veritable treasure trove 
of dainty, appetizing and tasty dishes. 



In sweet memories of a happy childhood spent in the 
atmosphere of the plantations and cabins of Virginia under 
the benign influence of my Dear Old Southern Mammy, 
Aunt Caroline, this volume is affectionately dedicated. 

William McKinney

may be used. After beating the dough, put it into a vessel

roll it lightly until about one-fourth of an inch thick. Then 
cut with biscuit cutter and dip into hot grease. Lastly fold 
the biscuits over and put into pans to rise about an hour or

OLD VIRGINIA MOLASSES TAFFY 

Put a pint of New Orleans molasses over the fire in a 
saucepan and boil for twenty minutes. Stir in a quarter tea- 
spoon of baking soda and boil fifteen minutes longer, or until 
a little, dropped into cold water, becomes brittle. This candy 
must be stirred contsantly while it is cooking or it will 
scorch. When it reaches the brittle stage, add a teaspoon of 
vinegar and a tablespoon of butter and pour into well-but- 
tered pans. Mark into shape with a buttered knife after the 
candy begins to form and before it is really hard. 



CREAM PEPPERMINT DROPS 

Put a half cup of cold water and two cups of granulated

Take from the stove, leavie it untouched until it is about blood- 
warm, then stir steadily, always in one direction until the mix- 
ture begins to become creamy. Flavor to taste with essence 
of peppermint, adding this cautiously so as not to get the 
flavor too strong. Drop by the teaspoonful upon waxed paper, 
being careful not to put the drops so close together that they 
will run into each other. A candy dipper is even better for 
this purpose than a teaspoon.
