Remarks— Pertinent and Impertinent 

This book has been made for the use of those 
people who wish to eat properly and really don't 
know how. 

More and more we human beings are discover- 
ing that our own internal organs are of quite as 
much importance as are those of our motors, and 
that our happiness may depend as much on the 
proper care of a digestive tract as on the cleanli- 
ness of a carburetor or the proper oiling of a 
crank case. 

But we Americans have bolted and stuffed 
rich food for so long that it is amazing how very 
few of us know how to stop or what to do, when 
the family physician, treacherously upheld by our 
own inner selves, demands a change in the catch- 
as-catch-can style of eating we have so long en- 
joyed. 

This was brought home to me recently when 
one of my best friends developed a bad case of 
auto-intoxication. He was promised all sorts of 
evil results, from head aches right on to death, if 
he did not at once stop eating meat, fried stuff 
and sweets, for at least a year. 

The day after this ultimatum had gone forth I 
dropped in to see the invalid and was greeted 
with delicious odors from the kitchen. 

**What are you cooking!'' I asked, and the 
wife of the victim answered, **Why, something

for John. Poor dear, he's on such a strict diet. 
It's so hard to think of things for him to eat. 
No meat — no fried stuff — so I just remembered 
how fond he is 'of brains, and I'm fixing him a 
mess — in butter, of course." 

After I had recovered from the shock I gently 
explained that *^meat" was not roast beef and 
steaks and chops only, but anything that grew 
on or in an animal, and that deep frying was 
deep frying, whether conducted via the lard or 
butter route. 

Poor John had a really terrible time, and his 
devoted wife a worse one, before they managed 
to get into their heads the idea of proper diet. 
But both, having brains and sense, and both be- 
ing in earnest, they finally did it. And as she 
dropped much unwelcome weight and John's 
business took a decided up-hill trend, as his 
brains grew less fuddled with food and his body 
more willing and active, they went to the other 
extreme and became food faddists. It's no fun 
dining there nowadays. You eat, always and 
eternally, what you ought to eat, and your con- 
versation is so saturated with calories and 
balanced rations and vitamines, that you have no 
pleasure, gastronomic or otherwise. They cer- 
tainly are well — but they are bores! It isn't 
necessary to be as frightfully extreme about it 
as they are. They learned through necessity. 
Most folks do. But it is quite possible to eat in 
such a way that you need never grow too fat or 
too thin, or be ill through improper food — pro- 



Remarks — Pertinent and Impertinent 11 

viding always, of course, that yon are a normal 
sort of person, with no inherited or acquired dis- 
eases to upset you. 

And it's a case where prevention is so very 
much easier than cure! Treated with any con- 
sideration at all from the beginning of life the 
average digestive organs will prove willing and 
good natured servants to the end. 

Of course those persons who were abused by 
fond but foolish parents in childhood start with a 
bad handicap. A youngster who has been allowed 
candy between meals, meals when he chose, was 
encouraged to overeat, and permitted to eat 
only the things he fancied has, as a general rule, 
to be much more careful when he is grown than 
the adult who has been taught self control, regu- 
lar eating habits and the wise selection of food 
when he was young. 

Self control! That is the base of it all. It is 
so amusing to hear the enemies of prohibition 
wail and rail because they think boys will have 
nothing on which to practise the virtue of self 
control if they are not put to the necessity of re- 
straining themselves from becoming drunkards. 

Let an5^ fat person go on a reducing diet for 
just one day — stay on it for a week — a month — 
a year — ^maybe always — and you'll see an ex- 
hibition of self control that is the real article! 

Let any child who has been allowed unlimited 
candy stop eating it entirely, or have it only for 
dessert at meal times, and he'll learn to be the 



12 The Calorie Cook Booh 

master of his fate and the captain of his 
stomach ! 

Bad habits are always hard to break, excesses 
always hard to control, but the earlier we learn 
to boss ourselves the easier it is to do it. 

There are a few fortunates who won't need 
this book. Who on looking over the menus will 
say, **0h, I eat more wisely than that right 
now. * * 

If that is true, they are lucky; probably well 
and possessors of sylphlike forms. 

But there are many many more who are going 
to read the maintenance menus and moan, 
turn to the reducing lists and faint with horror, 
and only feel happy and at home when immersed 
in the descriptions of the meals suggested for 
the adding of flesh. 

A **good eater,'' even an *' average eater," 
stows away a good deal more excess matter than 
he realizes. 

Not only do most of us eat too much, but as a 
general rule our food is too rich and too highly 
seasoned. There are a few recipes in this book 
that will tax weak digestions, but very few. The 
menus contain lots of fruit, much of it raw, as it 
is best, and there are many salads, most of them 
the simpler ones. We need much fruit and green 
stuff. All this worry about lack of vitamines, all 
this taking of vitamines in artificial forms, would 
be imnecessary if people would eat fresh green 
stuff and fruit the year around. Vitamines 
have their natural abiding place in milk, cereals, 



Remarks — Pertinent and Impertinent 13 

raw fruits and vegetables. Eat plenty of lettuce 
and watercress, celery, raw cabbage and carrots, 
** greens'' of all kinds, oranges, apples, lemons 
and so on, and you will get all the vitamines you 
need. 

It is well to remember — 

(First) That few of us use enough milk in 
our daily diet, one expert announcing that every 
adult ought to consume a quart of milk each day. 

(Second) That whole wheat flour is more 
healthful than white flour. 

(Third) That it is well to use molasses where 
you can instead of sugar. 

(Fourth) That whole cereals are richer, not 
only in vitamines but in minerals, than the re- 
fined cereals. 

Eefining everything! That is one of the sins 
of civilization. WeVe been so proud of our suc- 
cess in refining flour and sugar and rice and so 
on, that it is hard to realize that from a health 
standpoint all the work along these lines might 
better have been left undone; that we ought to 
go backward and get as close as we can to food 
prepared as Nature prepares it. 

The heavy eater of meat will not think much 
of this book. Meat once a day is enough for all 
except those who do hard out-door work all day, 
and there ought to be one meatless day a week 
for everybody. It won't do anyone a mite of 
harm, and will do those who get little out-door 
exercise much good, if two such days are worked 
into every seven. There are plenty of other 



14 The Calorie Cook Booh 

protein-bearing foods to have instead of meat. 
And when I use the word meat I do not nse it as 
a vegetarian would. Your true vegetarian does 
not eat anything that has ever lived. He even 
spares the feelings — and the flesh — of the dumb 
and lowly oyster. I mean by meat, beef, mutton, 
lamb, veal, pork, venison, woodchuck, rhinoceros, 
kangaroo or monkey, if you are situated where 
such animals might find their way to your 
platter. 

Fowl and fish, in this sense, are not meat 
Fowl, to the city dweller, or to any dweller at all 
who does not raise his own, is expensive — too 
expensive for the average housewife to serve 
very often. But fish ! Ah, fish ! Fish is a terribly 
neglected article of food. There seems to be al- 
most a prejudice against dt in some families, 
while others just forget about it. They'll have 
a can of salmon for a hurry-up lunch, perhaps — 
creamed tuna fish for a chafing dish supper — 
sardines for the picnic — maybe even a codfish 
ball or so some cold winter morning — or shrimp 
salad when the whist club comes. 

But the bewilderingly delightful array of fresh 
fish which may be found at any good city market, 
is neglected — often absolutely unknown, espe- 
cially in inland towns, while small communities 
too seldom make the best use -of the local supply 
generally to be found in near-by lakes and rivers, 
brooks and ponds. 

If you can, serve a platter of skinned pike, 
rolled in ^gg and corn meal, and then fried — ^in 



Remarks — Pertinent and Impertment 15 

plenty of very hot fat — a golden brown, and see 
them vanish. I once served such a meal to four 
guests who didn't know the fish at all. There 
were eight people at the table and twenty-two 
fish, each weighing about a quarter of a pound, 
and all my plans for using the left-overs next 
day were rendered null and void. There were 
no left-overs! 

Fish, with very few exceptions, notably lob- 
sters when served in the richer and more intri- 
cate ways, are healthful and few of them are very 
fattening. Most fish is cheaper than most meat 
Fish is easy to cook, easy to serve and it is easy 
to use the left-overs next day. Then as another 
meat substitute, there is the ever faithful dried 
bean — ^navy, kidney and lima. Lentils, too, and 
dried peas. Cheese, which combines so deli- 
ciously with so many things ; nuts, which need not 
be treated as a sort of extra dessert, but can take 
their place proudly and adequately with either 
the meat or salad course, and last but not least, 
eggs, which can be served in literally dozens of 
different and delightful fashions. Hurry up and 
get over that notion that you cannot plan a meal 
without a meat dish as a sort of keystone on 
which to rest all the remainder of your menu. 
You can. And you'll be wealthier, healthier and 
happier if you learn to do it. Especially if you 
are the lazy and extravagant sort of cook, whose 
mind runneth not beyond steaks and chops sur- 
rounded by the halo of a frying pan. 



16 The Calorie Cook Book 

WMch remark brings us to the second thing 
which I've striven to get into this book — 

ECONOMY!! 

IVe asked the printer man to please let that 
word stand out just like that — boldly, defiantly, 
all by its little lone self! 

Economy! If over-eating is a national trait, 
over-spending is certainly another. Some of us 
seem to have acquired the wild notion that it is 
clever to be extravagant with food. That it 
shows gentility and superiority to throw away 
left-overs. That the true aristocrat must show 
his — or generally her — ^blue blood by being 
wasteful and scorning care with the family 
funds. All of which would be very funny, if it 
wasn't 90 tragic. It shows brains and breeding 
— to say nothing of common sense — to be care- 
ful in the buying and the using of food. It 
merely shows selfishness, laziness and stupidity 
to have what the man on the garbage route 
would call *^ swell swill." 

Extravagance with food is not clever, it is 
simply silly. Meal planning or preparing is no 
job to be slouched and hurried over as quickly 
and as extravagantly as possible. You do not 
need to use fussy, difficult recipes, either. It is 
no harder to cook a flank steak than a porter- 
house. It only takes a little more skill. 

Look on your marketing and cooking as a 
game. Take pleasure in seeing how cheaply you 
can set a healthful, delicious and plentiful table. 



Remarks — Pertinent and Impertment 17 

Think ahead a little, invest in a fireless cooker 
maybe, and you can have as much time for 
other things as you ever had, and more money. 
Eemember that what won't go into a salad will 
go into a soup. That stews and meat pies, 
croquettes and sandwich fillings are delightful 
rivals of the ever popular but often overworked 
hash. 

Don't throw good food away. Not for the 
sake of anybody else, but for your own. If you 
like to spend money, remember that what you 
save on the table is just so much more to have 
for lip sticks and matinees, hats, traveling, or 
gas for the car. If you like to see neat little, 
trim little figures sprouting in a bank book, help 
their growth with the dollars saved from the 
butcher and grocer and delicatessen store. Oh, 
yes, I know there are some men who refuse to 
eat left-overs. They are the victims of wrong 
ideas, of a desire to **show off" and boast of 
being **good providers,'' or of poorly made 
dishes ! A well cooked left-over is generally bet- 
ter than it was in its original state. A poorly 
cooked one is the last degree of awfulness ! The 
mere average, however, is tastier and m'ore nu- 
tritious than the ready-to-eat food generally pur- 
veyed for the households which are being ex- 
pensively and inadequately fed upon them. 

Again, some of you will exclaim in shocked 
accents, **But I never eat carrots and turnips 
and parsnips and all those coarser vegetables," 
just as if I was asking you to do something 



18 The Calorie Cook Book 

rather low and unrefined. Others will announce 
with great pride, *^But I don't like anything but 
bread and meat and potatoes/' Just why a 
woman should think it marks her as superior to her 
onion-eating sisters to disdain that crisp white 
bulb, or why a man should swell with pride over 
the fact that he doesn't like prunes, I never could 
understand. Personal culinary disHkes are not 
assets to boast of, though most people seem to 
think they are. They are liabilities to be got rid 
of as quickly as possible. Learn to like the things 
that are good for you. Can't? Bosh! Non- 
sense! And again tut, tut! I guess I know. I 
did it. 

Up to my twenties I ate only bread, meat, po- 
tatoes, and sweets. I got sick — ^very sick — and 
suffered more than I should have suffered had 
I eaten properly. That was one reason for wak- 
ing up and behaving. There were two others 
though. First — if other people ate and relished 
all these things I despised, they must be good, 
and I was ndssing something. I wished to miss 
nothing. Second — I discovered my limited diet 
made me a terror to hostesses. People dreaded 
to invite me, as I since have dreaded to invite 
people with limited tastes. No one likes to have 
to keep a card index system of the intricate dis- 
likes of one's friends. It's a nuisance. I real- 
ized this as I saw harassed glances at things I 
wasn't eating. I was unhappy. I didn't want 
the particular hostess of the moment to worry 
about me, but she did, of course, and I do not like 



Remarks — Pertinent and Impertment 19 

to be a worry and a bother to otber folks, and 
I do like to be invited out. I was afraid if I 
didn^t reform I'd be an unwelcome guest. So I 
set to work. Sea foods, salads, vegetables — ^I 
can eat 'em all, though I freely acknowledge there 
are some I like better than others, and cocoanut 
and caraway seeds still do go down very, very 
hard and only when I am being polite. I am hop- 
ing to like them eventually. 

It is possible, though not easy, to conquer one's 
likes and dislikes. Try it, at least, for a varied 
diet is best, and fruits and vegetables of all kinds 
are most essential. 

There aren't such a lot of recipes in this book. 
Things you like very much may not be included 
at all. But if you will look up the simple food 
tables I have given, it should be easy for you to 
figure out for yourselves the food values of most 
of your favorite dishes. Take pound cake for 
instance. An old fashioned recipe I have by me 
reads, one pound of butter (which would be 
about 3605 calories), one pound of sugar (1860 
o.), 12 eggs (70 c. each makes 840 c altogether), 
one pound of flour (1625 c), one glass of wine 
and one glass of rose water. No authority I own 
gives me the caloric value -of rose water, but 
sherry is reported as having 42 calories to the 
sherry glass, and I believe that sherry was more 
generally used for cooking than any other wine. 
Hence, counting up the grand total for the cake, 
we reach the approximate sum of 8000 c. Truly 
a large and noble figure! Now then, supposing 



20 The Calorie Cook Book 

the piece of cake that falls to your portion is one 
twentieth of the whole, by dividing the grand 
total by twenty you find that you are adding 
about 400 c. to your system when you eat it. Or 
if you prefer another way of measuring, weigh 
the cake, weigh your own piece and discover your 
calories in that fashion. 

It is undoubtedly true that if you would be 
absolutely exact in this food portion business, 
scales are the thing. Almost unconsciously, 
you're apt to cheat. Even if you really want to 
take no more than you should, your idea of a 
* ^ heaping tablespoonf ul* ' or an * * average serving" 
may be totally different from mine, and mine 
different from that of the man who made the 
government food tables. That gentleman's '^me- 
dium sized orange'' may seem big to me, and 
small to you, and so on, ad infinitum, while even 
in the matter of butter or sugar no one may claim 
absolute accuracy. All butter and sugar are not 
made from exactly the same milk or cane or by 
exactly the same kind of people. 

Every measurement ought to have "about" 
printed before it. Especially measurements for 
such variable things as pancakes and mufiins, 
slices of bread, pieces of cake, helpings of sauce 
or slices of meat. All I can do for you here is to 
give you a general idea of food values, that wil] 
start you in the right direction, without fright- 
ening you or boring you. 

If this short, easy-to-learn lesson on food values 
interests you, go on, learn more for yourself. 



Remarks — Pertinent cmd Impertinent 21 

There are plenty of good technical, but not fear- 
somely technical, books you can buy. I learned 
what I know by buying them and reading them. 
For I am no trained dietitian; only a practical 
housewife who likes to cook, and who pre- 
fers to feel well herself, and be surrounded by a 
healthy good natured family instead of a lot of 
cranky, whining dyspeptics. 

If you do go on, and study more, and apply 
what you learn, you will find it interesting, and 
you will be rewarded with both cash and comfort. 



what Some Things are Worth 
in Calories 

A calorie is a measure of food value estimated 
bj its power to produce heat. Literally and scien- 
tifically, **A calorie is the amount of heat neces- 
sary to raise one kilogram of water from 0° to 1* 
C. or 1 pound 4° F/^ 

Know a lot about it now? That's nice! Pre- 
tend you do, anyhow. 

We have to bum things in our bodies all the 
time to keep said bodies going. When the body 
is asleep, very few ; more as it wakes ; more as it 
works a little; and so on — more and more and 
more with added activities. This needed energy is 
supplied, of course, by food, and the intake of the 
food needed is measured by calories. Foods with 
high calorie value are necessary for heat and mus- 
cular power, but we cannot eat such food only, and 
if we eat more than we need for heat they make 
themselves into fat. Vegetables very low in cal- 
ories contain minerals and vitamines just as neces- 
sary to health. So — to proceed —

It must be said again that these estimates are 
all approximate. On some of them the authorities 
disagree ; on a few things, not generally the most 
important, they disagree a good deal. The values 
of eatables by the pound are all copied out of the 
government report, by W. 0. Atwater, Ph. D., and 
A. P. Bryant, M. S. My other authority, for the 
cup measurements, and most of the tablespoon 
ones, too, is Mary Swartz Rose, Ph. D., and are 
taken from her book, ^^ Feeding the Family," 



A Foreword for the Fat 

Now for those who will agonize most 'over those 
suggestions — my brethren and sistren of the too, 
too solid flesh. 

May these menus aid you I 

The object has been to plan the meals with due 
regard to the housewives who have to cook them 
and eat them with other people. I have tried not 
to make lists of special dishes, but to show what 
may be eaten of ordinary every-day ones, served 
to the entire family. 

Of course you already know you cannot drop 
what we all know as ^^fattening foods'' entirely, 
because they all have elements that make you not 
only fat, but healthy. You need starch and fat 
and sweets. But the portions of such things must 
of necessity be small. If you feel the need of 
space fillers you must fall back upon lettuce, spin- 
ach, cabbage, parsnips, turnips, carrots, water 
cress, endive and such. And with them you must 
have little or no oil or cream or butter dressings. 
Oil and cream and butter are chuck full of **fat." 

You must be everlastingly careful. Calories 
pile up from such apparently simple things. It is 
hard to remember that you can't suck an extra 
orange without adding anywhere from seventy to 
a hundred calories to your too, too solid flesh — 
but you can't! ' You mustn't steal a few grapes 
for yourself while arranging the dish of fruit. 

25 



26 The Calorie Cook Book 

Grapes have an astounding number of calories. 
Don't abstract a raisin or so while mixing the 
spice cake, and don't, oh DO NOT keep tasting 
while you cook! You can ^* taste'' yourself to a 
whole meal just as easily as not ! 

Your motto will have to be, ^ ' Every ounce added 
to what I've got makes just a pound or two more.'* 

Absolutely nothing is taken for granted in these 
menus. If there is no cream or sugar spoken of 
for the tea or coffee in a menu, none has been al- 
lowed in that meal. 

If you just simply have to have them, why of 
course you will, but if you do, you 'ought to pare 
a calorie or two off here and there to make up, 
or you'll defeat yourself. Clear tea and coffee 
have no food value at all ; both cream and sugar 
have a very great deal. Condiments and relishes 
have little food value, but apart from a modest 
amount of tomato catsup you won't find them 
listed here, for you or for anybody else either, 
but you especially ought to keep away from them. 
They are bad for your ^* innards," and also they 
help to create the very thing you are trying to 
avoid — appetite. Beware of the spicy things, the 
hot things and the too salty things. Use prefer- 
ably whole wheat or graham bread instead of 
white. Not that it's thinning — just wholesome. 

If you have to cook the family meals, watch 
yourself while you do it. If you do not have to 
cook them, keep away from the kitchen. If you 
are generally alone for some meal — lunch for in- 
stance — arrange to do your real hard dieting then. 



A Foreword for the Fat 27 

It is so much easier to go without good things you 
neither see nor smell, than it is to say * ^ no ' ' when 
they are flaunting themselves shamelessly before 
your very nose and eyes. If, while things are be- 
ing prepared, it is possible to have your portions 
fixed so that they are less rich than those served 
for other people, have them prepared that way. 
Maybe your vegetables can appear with only skim 
milk and a bit of butter over them, instead of rich 
thickened dressing. Perhaps your salad 'can be 
dressed with a little less oil, your dessert come to 
you minus the entrancing little pompom of 
whipped cream on top. 

As to my food measurements, they are, as I 
have said before, and as I shall say again, approx- 
imate only. Calories are still wild things, not en- 
tirely broken to the uses of mankind. The most 
eminent authorities still disagree on the food 
value of many things. This book has tried to strike 
as near the happy average as possible. You will 
notice I speak of **thin cream" and ** average 
cream," listing the thin cream as having a value 
of 30 c. per tablespoonful. It must be really thin 
cream. When you know that ** average" is listed 
at a little less than 60 c. for the same amount, 
** heavy cream" at about 70 c. whole milk at 14 e. 
and skim milk at 7 c. for a tablespoon, you can fig- 
ure out for yourself about how thin that ^Hhin 
cream" ought to be. Don't cheat on it. 

As for the butter, one pat, as mentioned, means 
one thirty-second of a pound, or half of an ounce. 
You can get the right amount most easily by buy-

ing your table butter in those convenient little 
quarter pound sticks in which it is now put up, 
and dividing each stick into eight portions. Then 
that portion into halves or quarters, as needed. 

A quarter pat not much ? Indeed it is not ! If 
you ** reduce'' or ** maintain'' on these diets it is 
very likely that you will get over that habit of 
just slathering on the butter in luscious golden 
gobs. Hurt you to have so little ? Not at all. As 
long as you get some along with the fats that will 
be used in cooking, you'll be all right. These 
menus are not for growing children or invalids. 
That of course, must be understood. 

Right here, it seems well to make a statement, 
too, about oleomargarine. The poor stuff has been 
so dreadfully maligned ! Every authority I have 
studied gives margarine very neariy as high a 
food value as butter. The United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, for instance, rates oleomar- 
garine as worth 3525 calories per pound, and but- 
ter as worth 3605. Margarine is made in the 
cleanliest of ways from cleanly materials and is 
endorsed by women's magazines of the highest 
grade and by cooking schools. As it is always the 
same price the year around, and that price is 
sometimes less than one-third the price of butter, 
it is wise for the housewife, especially the house- 
wife who has a large family or limited funds, to 
use it, for cooking at least. The new nut marga- 
rines when properly colored are very hard indeed 
to tell from the best dairy product, even when 
served on the table, and the rabid prejudice 



A Foreword for the Fat 29 

against them one sometimes encounters, seems old 
fashioned. 

But don't get the idea that if you use oleomar- 
garine you're doing something that will help you 
reduce. I know a woman who thought that — and 
it simply isn't so! 

It is true though that even honest, earnest diet- 
ing isn't apt to help much unless you take exercise 
too, preferably in the open air. Don't get too 
strenuous. Walk every day, do some golfing or 
riding or swimming if you can. Devote ten min- 
utes night and morning to simple ** setting up" 
exercises. Don't be lazy mentally or physically. 

Above all, if you once have the strength of mind 
to start on a diet, stick to it ! Generally the actual 
deciding, the first half dozen **no, thank yous" 
are the hardest part. Don't waste all that effort 
and backslide. The oftener you betray yourself 
the harder it will be to start again, because each 
time you fail you'll lose confidence in your own 
strength. And it is never pleasant to know your- 
self a weakling. 

Don't expect rapid results. No harmless meth- 
od of reducing ever showed marvelous results right 
away. Don't fly hopefully to the scales at the end 
of one day, or order your dressmaker for a gen- 
eral making-over spree at the end of the first week. 

All things worth achieving take time. Also 
patience. And everlasting perseverance. 

So here follow a series of reducing menus — one 
full week each for spring, summer, autumn and 
winter use.

Hints for the Thin 

The thin folks may feel that I have been stingy 
with them. They have been given only one menu 
a season instead of seven. 

It is from no lack of interest or sympathy. It 
is simply that in their case there is a distinction 
-svith a difference. 

There is always the fact that excessive thinness 
may mean ill health or -overwork. No one can 
recommend a diet of more food, or richer food, 
unless quite certain that the person who is to eat 
all that extra stuff is able to get away with it. 

So if your collar bones make you resemble a 
hat rack, and your vertebrae are altogether too in- 
terested in popping out to look at the world for 
themselves, first see your doctor. If he says you 
are physically fit — fall to and eat up ! Only don't 
try to pad out with dill pickles or sauerkraut. 

Eat more of everything. Be sure you eat a va- 
riety. Eat starches, fats and the simpler sweets. 
Don't think it necessary to dispose of French 
pastries by the dozen. You may gain flesh but 
you'll lose your health. And good health is more 
to be prized than beauty. There's no comfort 
without it, and really no lasting beauty, either. 

You will notice in your menus that I have sim- 
ply arranged a variety of fattening foods, well in- 
terspersed with green salads and fruits, and that 

58 



Hints for the Thi/n 59 

things ^asy of digestion have been chosen most 
often. In your own planning, do likewise. 

The meals suggested here are not so very big. 
No second helpings are allowed for, and almost 
everybody wants a second helping of some thing. 
If you can eat them, do of course. But if the 
meals, on the other hand, seem too big, don't force 
yourself to the point of disgust. 

Don't eat between meals — that is bad for every- 
body. But arrange for extra meals at regular 
hours. Milk is the best thing to take at such 
meals, as you aren't apt to get enough anyhow, 
and it's the best thing for you. But you may 
take cocoa, or simple ice cream, without extra 
rich sauces, or a bowl of rice — brown rice pref- 
erably — or oat meal, or whole wheat, steamed 
soft, with whole milk or cream and brown sugar. 
Have maybe five meals a day. Breakfast, early 
lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, and a bedtime sup- 
per. Food eaten just before you sleep produces 
more fat than food eaten at any other time. 

You should reverse the advice given the fat 
folk. If possible have your food portions made 
more buttery, more creamy, than those served 
to other people — and if you can eat them, more 
generous too. 

Remember you need all the fresh air you can 
get, exercise, though that in m'oderation, and 
above all — peace! Don't worry! You very, very 
seldom see a fat worrier ! 

Here follow seasonal groups of upbuilding 
menus.

Supposing You Are Normal 

Lives there a man with soul so dead, who never 
to himself has said, * * This is my own, my native 
shape. It suits me and I hope to keep it just so 
forever r' Maybe, but if such a man exists, the 
conversations one hears point pretty strongly to 
the supposition that there is no such woman ! 

Every one of them seems to be trying to do 
something to alter the design of her mortal en- 
velope. 

But if few are conceited enough to think them- 
selves perfect, at least there are plenty who do 
not wish to go any further towards either too- 
thinness or too-thickness, than they have gone 
already. 

For such, these maintenance menus have been 
compiled. You are supposed, if you stick to them, 
to remain strictly * ^ as is. ' ' It may be possible, if 
you're a really heavy eater, that you'll reduce a 
little on them. 

They are supposed to count up to about twenty- 
four hundred calories a day. That is said to be 
about the average amount of food units needed 
to keep the normal human engine going health- 
fully and evenly. There are of course many ex- 
ceptions. Age makes a difference, so does sex, oc- 
cupation, of course, and very likely **race, color 
and previous condition of servitude.'' Every- 
thing seems to make a difference ! 

64 



Supposi/ng You Are Normal 65 

If you who read are a woodchopper, a deep-sea 
fisherman, a structural ironworker, a washwoman, 
or a farmerette, you are going to need from one 
thousand calories extra each day, up — ^up to may- 
be two thousand extra. Heavy work, especially 
heavy outdoor work, requires lots of steam, made 
from lots of simple, nourishing food. 

On the other hand, the manicurist or bookkeeper 
or stenographer who sits down nearly all day, and 
gets his or her only exercise by walking a block 
to and from the street car at each end of the trip 
to work, does not need twenty-four hundred calo- 
ries — ought to cut out from four to six hundred of 
them — ^while the woman who rises at noon, does 
nothing more strenuous than pencil her eyebrows, 
raise the bid at auction bridge, or pat-a-cake a bit 
of applause at the matinee, needs — oh, but why 
bother with what such a thing needs at all, es- 
pecially as what she needs most is a good 'old fash- 
ioned spanking ! 

Eemember that these menus allow for no eating 
between meals. That is the most pernicious habit 
anyone can have, and ought to be eliminated as 
thoroughly for the adult as for the child. 

It is possible that the luncheons here given have 
been arranged with too little thought for the office 
worker, who must eat at a restaurant. I fear I Ve 
used those luncheons to show off my ideas about 
economies and left-overs and such, for the home 
folk. 

But the business people, by reading the food 
values given, over and -over again, for all of the 



66 The Calorie Cook Book 

simpler things, can quickly get an idea of what to 
order from any menu. It is surprising — indeed it 
is almost distressing — ^how quickly the calorie 
value of your favorite foods, especially if they are 
terribly fattening foods like potatoes au gratin 
or chocolate cornstarch pudding — can get firmly 
fixed in your mind! And the fiendish rapidity 
Avith which those values can pop out at you when 
your most subconscious of subconscious selves 
starts the merest suggestion of a second helping, 
makes one believe in witchcraft. 

Second helpings ! They are the ban of beauty ! 
They do more harm to fat folk than any other gas- 
tronomic item. 

A professional beauty said in a recent interview 
that she kept her lovely figure by never indulging 
in second helpings. It is a good hint to remember 
— and a very hard one to follow. 

It is not easy to keep yourself well or shapely 
by proper eating. But it is a whole lot easier than 
it is to eat yourself well once you are sick, to pad 
over the bones that have become thoroughly used 
to too much social prominence, or to drop off the 
pounds that have once lovingly gathered to the 
support of your too hospitable curves. 

Remember that, and be careful ! The menus that 
follow will help you.

The Calorie Cook Book Recipes 

This does not pretend to be a full and complete 
cook book. There are plenty of those, much more 
comprehensive ones than I could compile. I have 
tried to include recipes mentioned in the menus, 
and others that are exceptionally good. They are 
recipes gathered from my relatives and friends, 
adapted from cook books, invented — I like to 
imagine — by myself — and in some cases the same 
recipes found in the Boston Cooking School book. 

There is some explanation necessary. Of 
course you know that *^tbsp.'' stands for table- 
spoon and *^tsp.^' for teaspoon, though 111 men- 
tion the fact to be sure. 

When I say *^ whole milk^' I mean milk with the 
cream left in. I do not think there is a place in 
the book where, if whole milk is meant, IVe not 
called it that. Most of the recipes are computed 
with skimmed milk. Of course whole milk can be 
used instead. It will make things better — and 
more fattening. Where a cream soup, for in- 
stance, is the main dish at a meal, whole milk 
ought to be used, but where the soup is a first 
course only, it isn't necessary. 

In adding my calories IVe allowed 400 c. a cup 
for flour — 395 is the exact figure — but that is sifted 
flour. If you are measuring unsifted it should be 
459 c. Graham flour has a still higher value. 

I must say again that the values in calories are 

95 



96 The Calorie CooTc Book 

approximate only. They cannot be anything else. 
On all meats, for instance, figures are given in the 
scientific reference works for the value per pound 
of ^4ean,'' *^very lean," *^fat,'^ and **very fat,'' 
and each time there are three subdivisions — max- 
imum, minimum, and average. Now that would 
make twelve sets of figures to hand out for roast 
beef, let's say. Obviously, it can't be done. I 
have tried to take the medium figures. 

All those different grades, all those intricate 
tables, telling what calories we should burn per 
hour while sleeping, waking, washing, walking, 
manicuring our nails and chasing the neighbor's 
hens out of the flower bed, are for the teacher or 
the expert alone. 

The average housewife can't learn them — 
shouldn't have to learn them — won't learn them! 

But of course the fact that all these differences 
exist, makes the absolutely accurate computing 
of food values difficult, if not quite impossible. 
Just remember that with everything, in every 
case, I have tried to strike a medium. 

It should be understood that the calorie content 
indicated just below the name of each of the fol- 
lowing recipes meams the number of calories con- 
tained in the material called for in thQ recipe. 



Bread Recipes 

White Bread 

2685 Calories 
1 cup scalded milk 1 yeast cake 

1 cup boiling water ^ cup warm water 

2 tbsps. vegetable shortening 6 cups sifted flour 
2% tsps. salt 

Put the shortening, sugar and salt in a deep 
smooth bowl, and pour on the boiling water. Dis- 
solve the yeast in lukewarm water, and when the 
other mixture is lukewarm too, add it, and, grad- 
ually, five cups of flour. Stir with a strong spoon 
until thoroughly mixed. Add the rest of the flour, 
mix, and turn all out onto a well floured board. 
Knead it until the mixture is smooth, elastic to 
the touch, and has little bubbles under the sur- 
face. Eeturn to the bowl, cover with a clean cloth, 
and a cover of board or tin. Let it rise overnight 
in a warm place. In the morning turn it out ontO' 
a floured board again, and cut it down, separating 
into several pieces with a knife. Knead again, 
shape into loaves or biscuits, put into greased 
pans, and set to rise again. When the loaves have 
risen to double their original bulk, bake in a hot 
oven. This same recipe may be used for entire 
wheat bread, but when entire white flour is used, 
three tablespoons of molasses should be added. 
Whole wheat bread is said to be very much the 
best for us in every way.

Grandma's Brown Bread 

2000 Calories 
1 pt. white sponge ^2 cup of molasses 

1/^ cup brown sugar % cup warm water 

1/2 tsp. salt Graham flour 

Take a good, generous pint from your white 
sponge. Put the brown sugar in a bowl and pour 
over it the warm water, stirring so all lumps will 
be dissolved. Add the molasses and salt and then 
the white sponge; lastly, graham flour until the 
batter is as thick as can be stirred with a spoon. 
Place in a greased pan and set away in a warm 
place to rise till light. Bake about an hour. 


Parker House Rolls 

1890 Calories 
1 pint sweet milk 1 tsp. salt, level 

1 heaping tbsp. shortening 1 heaping tbsp. sugar 

2 compressed yeast cakes 4 cups flour 

^ cup lukewarm water 

Heat milk, shortening, salt and sugar together 
and cool. When only lukewarm add the yeast 
cakes, which have already been dissolved in warm 
water, and about four cups of flour, stirring the 
flour in carefully, so batter will be smooth. Beat 
well, cover and set in a warm place to rise. Put 
out on floured board, cut in two, and knead in 
more flour. Eoll thin, and cut with a biscuit cut- 
ter. Brush half the round with butter, fold over 
in the center and lay in greased pans. Set away 
to rise again. Bake fifteen or twenty minutes in 
a moderate oven. The joy of these rolls is that 



Bread Recipes 99 



they may be got ready so quickly. If **set^* at 
two in the afternoon, they can be ready for din- 
ner, and they are deliciously light and fluffy. 



Baking Powder Biscuit 

1080 Calories 

2 cups flour 2 tbsps. shortening 

3 tsps. baking powder 1 cup milk 
1 tsp. salt 

Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together; 
then mix in the shortening with the tips of the fin- 
gers. Then gradually add the milk until there is 
a dough soft enough to roll out but not soft enough 
to be squashy. More liquid may be needed — and 
by the way, you can use half milk and half water, 
or at a pinch, all water, and have good biscuit. 
Have a well floured board, put your dough on it 
and roll it out till it is about half an inch thick. Cut 
in rounds and bake fifteen minutes in a hot oven. 



Cinnamon Rolls 

1660 Calories 

2 cups flour V2 tsp. salt 

3 tsps. baking powder 2 tbsps. shortening 
1 tbsp. granulated sugar % cup milk 

1 tbsp. brown sugar 1 cup raisins and currants 

1 tsp. cinnamon 

Mix the dry ingredients except the brown sugar ; 
add the shortening, rubbing it in with your fingers, 
then the beaten egg and then the milk. Put the 
dough out on a well floured board and roll it much 
thinner than you roll it for biscuit, and as evenly 
as possible. Sprinkle over it the brown sugar. 



100 The Calorie Cook Booh 

the fruit and tlie cinnamon. E/oll it gently until 
the whole is in a long roll. Then with a sharp, 
floured knife cut off rounds about one-half inch 
in thickness, place them in a greased pan, and bake 
a little longer than you bake biscuits, watching 
them carefully, as they need a quick oven. 



Graham Gems 
1710 Calories 

3 cups graham flour 1 egg 

3 tsps. baking powder 1 tbsp. melted shortening 

1 scant tsp. salt l^^ cups skimmed milk 

1 tbsp. molasses 

Mix the flour, salt and baking powder well to- 
gether, add the molasses — more if you like things 
pretty sweet — the Qgg^ well beaten, shortening and 
last the milk. Beat together, and bake in buttered 
gem pans, about twenty-five minutes. If you wish, 
you can use the same recipe with sour milk, using 
half the amount of baking powder and a teaspoon 
of baking soda, beaten into the sour milk till the 
milk foams. If you're reducing, make 'em with 
water. If enlarging, add some raisins. 



White Gems 

1585 Calories 

3 cups flour 1 egg 

1 tbsp. sugar V/^ tbsps. melted butter 

3 tsps. baking powder V/2 cups sweet skimmed milk 

1 level tsp. salt or water 

Mix dry ingredients, sift them together, stir in 
the butter, the beaten ^gg^ and then, gradually, 
the milk or water. Bake about twenty or twenty- 



Bread Recipes 101 



five minutes. Don't use too hot an oven. These 
and the graham gems are good reheated. Before 
reheating, however, sprinkle them with water. 



Pop-Overs 

1385 Calories 

cups flour 1 tsp. melted butter 
% tsp. salt 1% cups whole milk 

4 eg^s 
In the first place, if yon haven't iron gem pans 
or small earthen cups to bake in, you can't have 
pop-overs. A rose by any other name might smell 
as sweet, but a pop-over baked in granite or tin 
wouldn't be a pop-over. The pans for them must 
be piping, sizzling hot. Mix the salt and flour 
and pour in the milk, little by little, so the batter 
will be very smooth. Beat the eggs till they are 
as light as can be, add them and the butter; beat 
frantically with the Qgg beater for three minutes, 
and while all light and foamy pour into your hot 
pans, and pop them, pronto, into a hot open. They 
too will pop, and come out the most luscious tid- 
bits ever eaten for any meal. As there is no bak- 
ing powder used, you can see that their lightness 
depends on your beating, so — don't spare your- 
self. 



Quick Bran Bread 

Without Nuts or Eaisins 

820 Calories 

1 cup bran 2 tbsps. sugar 
1 tsp. baking powder ^/^ tsp. salt 

1 cup white flour Sweet milk 



102 The Calorie Cook Booh 

Mix the bran, flour, salt, sugar and baking pow- 
der; then stir in enough milk — a little more than 
half a cup — to make a stiff batter. If you are just 
maintaining, or adding, mix in last of all a half 
cup of raisins and a half cup of chopped nut 
meats. But if you are reducing, oh, I pray you, 
do not so ! 



Corn Bread 

1315 Calories 
ly^ Clips yellow com meal % tsp. salt 
V2 cup white flour 1 e^g 

^ cup sugar 1 cup milk 

3 tsps. baking powder 2 tbsps. shortening, melted 

Mix the dry ingredients thoroughly. Beat the 
egg well, then beat it into the milk and add. Add 
the melted shortening last. Turn into greased 
pans and bake about thirty minutes in a hot oven. 
Good as muffins, or baked in a sheet. Should be 
baked rather thin. 

Corn bread is extra good made with sour milk. 
In using that, beat a scant teaspoon of soda into

Sift the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder to-

eggs and beat each thoroughly. Add the shorten- 
ing, melted, the egg yolks, the molasses, and stir 
in the milk gradually. At the very last fold in 
the stiffly beaten whites. This may make a batter 
too thin to suit some tastes. Personally, I like it 
pretty thin. If you don't, just put in less milk, of 
course. Be sure in baking the waffles that your 
pans are hot on both sides and well greased, or 
the waffles will stick. Don't put in too much bat- 
ter at once, or the waffles will come out soggy. 
If you prefer all your sweetening added after 
baldng, leave out the sugar and molasses, though, 
the molasses helps in the browning, and I think 
in the taste, too.

Mix the dry ingredients well ; add the ^gg, well 
beaten, and gradually, the milk. Chop the nuts — 
English walnuts are best^ — and add them last. 
Pour into a bread pan and bake slowly and care- 
fully for about forty-five minutes. Of course if 
you live near hickory, butternut, or black walnut 
trees, you can use the nuts from them. But their 
meats are much richer and less easily digested 
than the meats of the English walnuts. 



Croutons 

Many people prefer croutons to crackers, as an 
accompaniment to soup. They are at least a 
change and they are some help in solving the 
what-to-do-with-dry-bread problem. 

Croutons are made by cutting slices of bread, 
from which the crust has been trimmed, into 
strips or dice. For the simpler ones, toast the 
bread first and cut to the desired size. For the 
richer ones, cut the bread, have ready a frying pan 
^th melted fat in it, hot, and fry the croutons till 
they are a crisp golden brown. In either case, 
serve them hot. 



Soup Recipes 

As I remark in another portion of this work, 
what won't go into a salad will go into a soup. 
It is very true. The soup kettle, if you will for- 
give me, should be a sort of antigarbagepail. 
Many a time and oft has my family smacked its 
collective lips and said, **Um-m-m, that's good 
soup. What kind is it?'' And when I repeat the 
component parts they sit aghast — but they don't 
stop eating it ! The bones from that rib roast or 
from the leg of lamb. Cooked once? Why of 
course. But not boiled. The pathetic ** slats" of 
the turkey or chicken or duck. The trimmings 
from ^*veal birds"; the tails of porterhouse 
steaks, plus the T-bone when it comes from the 
table. All these things hold within themselves the 
possibilities of delectable meals. They must be 
aided and upheld, of course. But how seldom is 
the nice fresh bought-on-purpose soup bone ex- 
pected to fulfill its mission in life cfuite alow! . 
Doesn't it also call loudly for the able support of a 
company of vegetables ? Vegetable men the coun- 
try over anticipate those calls by rows of neatly 
tied up **soup packages." Well, then, use those 
bunches of mixed vegetables on your own home- 
grown soup bones, or better yet, bring those left 
over bones onto the stage of your table supported 
by home talent. The outside leaves of the cab- 
bage or lettuce, the coarse leaves of the celery 

106 



Soup Recipes 107 



tops, the heavy butts of the carrots you grated 
for salad — these, with the aid of the ever faithful 
onioin will boil up into a delicious dish, and after 
the soup is strained you can add the saucer of cold 
rice, that dab of cold peas or the few string beans, 
heat them up in the soup and serve them in it. 
When soup is not a course only, but a big part of 
a meal it is more satisfactory, as well as more 
entertaining, to have it full of unexpected good 
things. 

After you have considered the possibilities of 
soups, as described, think of the rack of the chick- 
en or turkey, boiled till every last bit of meat falls 
into the soup, the cold gravy added, the whole 
thickened till it is hardly soup any more, and 
served over slices 'of crisp toast or flaky baking 
powder biscuit. That, my friends, is to smile! 

And fish — again I call your attention to the 
possibilities of the finny tribe. 

Any fish that ever swam in water will swim as 
agreeably in the soup plate ! Make his left-over 
fragments into cream soup, or chowder. It has 
been said that milk and fish should never be cooked 
together, but that is all poppycock. 

If it were really so, think of the confirmation we 
should receive day by day. Creamed codfish, sal- 
mon, tuna, creamed sauces on boiled fish — ^why 
folks are eating those combinations by the thou- 
sands every day and, except for one here and 
there whose digestion may be peculiar in some 
way, with no ill results at all. The ^^ freaks" can't 
be considered in the ordinary menu. There are 



108 The Calorie Cook Booh 

plenty of people wboi become violently ill if they 
eat so much as a scrap of egg — or even a bit of 
one egg cake. But on their account we don't leave 
eggs out of our cook books or our diets. 

Any left-over fresh fish can be made into a 
soup, generally with the addition of vegetables, 
almost always with milk. Or it can become a fish 
chowder, chowder being a sort of mixture of soup 
and stew. For the chowder slice potatoes and 
onions together, cover with water and stew gently 
till done. Have some sliced bacon fried crisp, 
break it in pieces, add the pieces and some of the 
grease to the potatoes and onions ; add the bits of 
fish, stew together and serve with big pilot crack- 
ers. You don't need milk for a chowder but you 
can use it if you like. 

And now, after this bit of loitering by the way- 
side, we will step back into the marching column 
of real recipes again.

all chopped. Put in the rest of the seasoning and 
cook slowly for another hour. Then strain it, let 
it cool, remove the fat and clear. To clear it suc- 
cessfully put in the slightly beaten white of one

Cream of Celery Soup 
610 Calories

the onion, in water to cover, until they are soft. 
Put through a sieve. Scald the milk and put into 
it the strained celery mth any of the water that 
was left from boiling it, also one cup of water. 
Have the butter and flour rubbed together and 
add them slowly to bind the soup together. Sea- 
son and serve. When the soup is not a first course 
but part of a meal it is often better not to put 
the celery through the sieve. In such a case heat, 
thicken and season the milk and celery water and

1 tbsp. bacon grease 

See that the corn is very well cooked. Then put 
through a sieve or leave it *^as is,'' according to 
family tastes. Fry or bake the bacon till crisp 
and break the strips into bits. Scald the milk and 
thicken it with the flour rubbed into the bacon 
grease. Or if you think you can handle it better 
another way, just thin the flour with a bit of the 
milk, cold, and stir in slowly, adding the grease 
afterward. Some people can't handle grease and 
flour thickening without making the soup or gravy 
into which it goes lumpy — and it is such a nui- 
sance to strain the whole thing after it's done! 
However you dO' it, have the milk thickened, 
greased and seasoned, and then stir in the corn 
and the bits of bacon and serve.

Boiled Fresh Codfish 

325 Calories per Pound 

Buy about two pounds of fresh cod, getting it 
out of the center of the fish if you can. Clean it 
thoroughly, lay it on a plate, put in a steamer, 
drop a couple of bay leaves, some summer savory 
and celery seeds into the water in the lower part 
of the steamer, cover all tightly, and steam for an 
hour, or until the meat is quite tender and flaky. 
Eemove all skin, trim neatly, put on a hot platter, 
garnish with parsley, and serve with plain boiled 
potatoes and egg sauce, or if you wish, shrimp or 
oyster sauce. Of course, you can steam it without 
the bay leaf et cetera in the water, and maybe 
you'd like it better plain. You can cook fresh 
halibut, haddock or salmon in exactly the same 
way, and all of them are just as good as they can 
be. You can boil them too, but they are apt to go 
to pieces when boiled. If you do try it, add salt 
and a bit of vinegar or lemon juice to the water, 
and tie the fish up in a cloth before dropping it in, 
so it won't get scummy and will keep together. 



Baked Bluefish 
410 Calories per Pound 

Buy a four-pound bluefish, cut off his tail and 
his head, clean well, stuff with fish stuffing, which 
differs a little from chicken stuffing, though you 
can use chicken stuffing if you like, and bake about 
an hour. Add a little hot water after baking has 
begun. When half done rub butter over the fish, 



116 The Calorie Co oh Booh 

and baste it now and then. In the same way bake 
fresh mackerel, whitefish, lake trout, wall-eyed 
pike, or for that matter, about any fish big enough 
to be stuffed. The drier fishes may need strips of 
bacon laid over them while baking, the fatter, 
richer ones will not. Garnish them all with sprigs 
of parsley before serving. 



Creamed Codfish 
Salt Cod, 410 Calories per Pound 
White Sauce, 1080 Calories per Pint 
If you use the prepared codfish, it'll be easy, 
but it won't be the regular article which real cod- 
fish fans demand. Buy the dried, salted fish, and 
soak it well in at least two waters. Pick it over 
carefully. Make a plain white sauce of milk, but- 
ter and flour. Cook the picked over fish flakes in 
this sauce a minute or sO', and after taking from 
the fire, beat in quickly an e^g, already beaten 
up. Hard boiled eggs, chopped, are good in the 
fish, or as a garnish around it.

mento and olives together. Make a white sauce 
from the milk, butter, flour and cream, and season

with the mashed potato. Separate the egg^ beat 
the yolk slightly, and add to the fish and potato. 
Mix thoroughly and season to taste. Beat the egg 
white a little, form the salmon mixture into cro-

the pan, and fry them crisp in their own oil. Serve 
on toast, which has been barely moistened with a 
little hot water and butter. 



Planked Whitefish 

700 Calories per Pomid 
Planked fish are extra good ! As the planks are 
not expensive, especially if you buy just a plain 
one without any fancy holder, it pays to have one 
for a family that serves fish often. It's such an 
easy way of cooking the fish, too. Buy a fish that 
weighs two and a half or three pounds. Split it, 
scrape it, and put it skin side down, on the plank, 
which has been generously buttered. Sprinkle the 
fish with salt and pepper and dot with butter. If 
you cook with a coal range, set the plank in a hot 
oven and bake twenty-five minutes. If you have 
a gas range, try it in the broiler, under the flame. 
When done, take out; have hot mashed potato 
ready ; arrange the potato in a low mound around 
the edge of the plank; set it back under a hot 
flame until the potato is browned delicately; add 
sprigs of parsley; serve. 



Fish Recipes 119 



Lake trout can be planked to great advantage, 
too, and shad is delicious that way, but then, is 
there a way or fashion of cooking in which shad 
is not delicious ? If midland and far western peo- 
ple could only know it better!

juice and cook in it the washed, drained oysters 
and the celery, which has been already parboiled. 
When the edges of the oysters begin to curl pour 
in a cup of hot white sauce, well seasoned with salt 
and pepper; add the chopped parsley, stir all to- 
gether well, and serve on hot toast. 



Fried Skinned Pike 
365 Calories per Pound 

Buy as many skinned pike as you need, roll 
them in com meal, and fry them in rather deep 
fat. If the fat is not deep enough they are apt to 
be much greasier than when there is plenty, and 
it must be hot, but not hot enough to burn the 
fish. If a bit of the soft part of bread cooks brown 
in the fat in one minute, it is right for frying the 
fish. 

Follow these same directions for codfish steaks, 
halibut steaks, and for most of the little fresh

Clean roast well, wipe dry, rub with salt, dredge 
with flour and put in baking pan. One with a rack 
on which to lay the meat is best. Add one-half 
cup hot water. Put at once into a hot oven, so 
meat may be seared rapidly and its juices re-

twenty minutes to the pound — a little more if you 
wish the roast well done, less if you prefer meat 
rare. Baste often. If you buy a ^^ rolled roast'' 
you will have no left-overs of raw meat. But if 
you buy a standing roast, have the bones saved so 
you can make a soup, and have the lower part 
of the ribs sawed off for another and different

Yorkshire Pudding 

1 cup milk 2 eggs 

1 cup flour ^ tsp. salt 

This is an English goodie we Americans ought 
to cultivate more than we do. We may have 
neglected it, due to the fact that we like *'made 
gravy. ' ' The English are apt to think our made 
gravies silly, to say the least, and according to 
their modus operandi, Yorkshire pudding and 
made gravy can not exist at one and the same 
time. But they really can. The English man — 
or I should say English woman, I suppose — bakes 
the pudding in the pan in which the meat is 
roasted, and it takes up all the grease unto itself, 
and is very good, but there's no chance for gravy 
after it's done ! However, don't bake it that way. 
Have a separate pan for the pudding. Get some 
extra suet with the roast, if it's not a fat one from 
which you can cut what is needed. Try out the 
grease and put in the bottom of a hot pan. Don't 
just grease the pan, have a little grease standing 
in the bottom — hot. Now, mix the salt with the 
flour of your recipe, and sift together, then add 
the milk gradually, so the batter will be very 
smooth. Beat the eggs until they are very, very 
light, and beat into the rest of the batter. Then

pour into the liot fat in the hot pan and put in a 
hot oven. It will bake in about twenty minutes, 
and after it has raised well, it makes it good to 
baste it with drippings from the roast. In this 
way you can be both English and American, en- 
joying the advantages of both schools of cookery

admit that Yorkshire pudding done this way is 
as good as the English article. 

The recipe, you will notice, is the same as for 
pop-overs, and like them depends for lightness on 
beating. The pudding should be served in slices 
or squares, a portion with each helping of beef. 



Pot Roast of Beef

1/2 lb. spaghetti 4 strips bacon 

1/2 can tomatoes I/2 bay leaf 

Salt and pepper 

Naturally, when buying pot roast, the better 
the cut the better the taste. But the purchaser 
of pot roast seldom cares to pay top sirloin or 
round steak prices per pound, and the best aver- 
age cut sold for this form of cooking is a piece 
of chuck. And very delicious a chuck pot roast 
is. You can of course have a big one or a little 
one, but six pounds is a good average. It always 
pays to have plenty of pot roast left over, it is 
so good sliced cold, or made up into a meat pie, 
stew or hash. Take your roast and see it is well 
trimmed and cleaned. Dry it, and pop it into a 



124 The Calorie CooTc Booh 

skillet in which you have cooked your bacon till 
it was almost done, laying the bacon aside for 
the moment. Fry the roast on both sides till 
it is crisp. This keeps in the juices, and gives 
the finished product a delicious flavor. When it 
is done, put it in your fireless cooker, or the big 
pot in which it is to simmer — an iron pot makes 
the meat extra good. Put on top your onions, 
peeled but whole ; on top of them lay the strips 
of bacon, and pour over all the bacon grease from 
the frying pan, a half cup of hot water, added 
first to the pan, to help in getting out all the 
grease there is, and the tomatoes, with the bay 
leaf and salt and pepper. Finish in the fireless 
cooker, or let it simmer three hours, adding water 
in cooking if necessary. About thirty minutes 
before the roast is done add to the liquor the 
spaghetti, broken into two-inch pieces, letting that 
cook with the meat till it is tender. Arrange the 
onions around the roast on the platter; serve the 
spaghetti in a separate dish. A wonderful * * next 
day'' dish is made by taking the left-over 
spaghetti and onions, putting them in a baking 
dish, onions on top, moistening them with any 
gravy there is, and baking about twenty minutes.

it in a well greased casserole (or the kettle of your 
fireless cooker) and pour over it the tomatoes and 
a little water. Stand the onions on top, and dot 
them with bits of suet. Add your bay leaf and 
sprinkle over your celery seed and salt and pepper 
to taste. Cook slowly for three hours in the 
cooker of a tightly covered casserole. Serve on 
one platter, arranging the onions around the edge 
and pouring over the meat a thickened gravy 
made from the tomatoes and drippings in the pan. 
If you are not acquainted with bay leaves, intro-

chop onion or celery very fine and add. Add

moderate oven three-quarters of an hour longer, 
basting often. Cracker crumbs can be used 
instead of bread, or rice, but both are higher in

basting, for an hour. Of course you don't really 
have to baste it, especially if it is done in a regu-

Stand over your butcher and make him cut the 
steak a great deal thinner than he thinks you 
ought to have it. Make him just shave it. Have 
a rather shallow baking dish with slightly sloping 
sides. Cut your meat into pieces three or four 
inches square and roll into tight little rolls, with 
a bit of suet in the heart of each roll. Flour each 
roll and arrange them neatly in the bottom of 
your baking dish until it is covered. Salt and 
pepper the rolls slightly, then put in a layer of 
mushrooms or sliced celery; then another layer 
of meat rolls and pour in gently half a cup of 
water. Then take your pastry dough, roll it 
thicker than for an ordinary fruit pie, cover the

meat and decorate around the edge of the dish 
with two long strips of pastry coiled together into 
a rope eifect. With a knife make a design on top, 
with one hole in the center big enough to let you 
add water as the pie needs it. Bake in a slow oven 
three and one-half hours, carefully adding water 
now and then. If the crust shows signs of baking 
too rapidly cover with folds of heavy paper. This 
is an old English recipe and must have come from 
the royal kitchen, as it is indeed a dish fit for a

Beef liver is best for this dish, so you can use

putting in the water, salt, pepper, bay leaf and 
clove. While it is boiling, fry or broil five strips 
of bacon till it is crisp and mash it or break it 
into bits. 

When the liver has boiled, cool it a little and 
trim out all the parts that are tough or stringy; 
then put it through one of the finer knives of the

mixture into a loaf add some of the water in 
which the bacon was cooked. Mold it as you 
would a beef or veal loaf and lay it in a well 
greased pan, laying three strips of bacon over 
its top. 

Slice the onions in rather thick slices, parboil 
them &ve minutes, drain and lay them in the pan 
around the loaf. Salt and pepper them, pour in 
a half cup of the liquor in which the liver boiled 
and roast until the onions are done — about half 
an hour. Serve on a platter surrounded by the 
onions. This is best when baked in a heavy iron 
frying pan. Somehow iron does roast and fry

Buy, if you can, a piece of the upper end of 
the brisket, as that piece has more lean meat in 
it than most pieces used for this process of curing 
meat. Wipe the meat well, tie it into shape, put 
it into a large kettle and let it come gradually to 
a boil. Boil hard for about ten minutes, skim off 
the scum that will gather, and then let it just 
simmer — or put it in the fireless cooker for two 
hours. Maybe it "vvill require still longer cooking 
if youVe been unlucky enough to acquire a sec- 
tion of too ancient an animal. Choice beeves are 
not often corned. 

Wash and scrape the carrots and turnips, peel 
the onions and potatoes and cut up the cabbage. 
Halve the carrots and turnips and put them and 
the onions in to cook with the meat an hour before 
it is to be served. Add the potatoes half an hour 
later, as they cook more quickly, and allow the 
cabbage only twenty minutes to cook. This is 
against precedent, I know, but the reason why so 
many people ^* taste'' a boiled dinner is because 
the cabbage has been overcooked and becomes 
hard to digest. Try it the twenty-minute way

Roast Veal 
Leg of Veal, 1055 Calories per Pound 

Veal is the second hardest meat to digest, pork 
holding first place. If veal is killed too young — 
when it is less than six weeks old, it is really dan- 
gerous — ^not deadly, just apt to produce a bad 
stomach ache. It should be eaten as fresh as pos- 
sible. It helps beef and mutton to ^^hang" but it 
does not help lamb or veal. For roasting, buy a 
leg, loin, or shoulder. All are good, the leg or 
loin making the best looking roast, the shoulder 
being the cheapest. If you get the leg, have them 
bone it at market, if the shoulder — or even the 
breast — have the butcher put a ^^ pocket" in it. 
Fill the place where the leg bone was, or the 



132 The Calorie Cooh Book 

pocket in the shoulder or breast, with stuffing such 
as you use in turkey. You won't need nearly so 
much, however. Clean and wipe the meat, stuff 
it and sew or skewer it into shape. Rub it lightly 
with salt and dredge with flour. As veal has 
practically no fat, lay over it while roasting strips 
of bacon or salt pork, or a string of little sausages. 
Put on the rack in the roasting pan, add a cup of 
hot water and bake thoroughly, basting often. 
Three hours will do for a medium sized roast, but 
veal should be very well done. Serve with gravy 
made in the pan.

family has not inherited one of the meat pounders 
with which all steaks were massacred a generation 
ago. Now cut in strips about three inches long 
and about half as wide and lay on each strip 
enough dressing to almost cover half the meat. 
Roll up the strips as snugly and neatly as possible 
— the stuffing will want to get out of place — 
fasten with toothpicks or skewers. Roll a long 
strip of bacon around each ^^bird,'* fasten that 
on, sprinkle the whole with salt and pepper, roll

Roast Leg Lamb 

900 Calories per Pound 
Americans have gone so utterly daffy over 
lamb that the word *^ mutton *' is seldom heard 
and if I gave any directions for mutton they 
might not be at all popular. However, mutton is 
better than lamb to many palates and it is ad- 
mittedly more nutritious. It is more than likely 
that we buy and eat many a sheep masquerading 
under the name of its own offspring. It hardly 
seems possible that there could be enough bona 
fide lambs to fill the demand! You can tell the 
difference, not only by the size, but by the flesh 



134 The Calorie Cooh Boole 

and bones. Mutton is a deeper color than lamb, 
and in lamb the bones are pink, while mutton 
bones are white. For a roast of either the leg is 
the commonest cut, though a crown roast, made of 
the rib chops, is often used. Too few know the 
possibilities of a shoulder roast of lamb or mutton, 
although veal shoulder roast is popular in many 
families. The shoulder roast does not make quite 
such even, pretty slices, when carved, but the meat 
is tenderer and is just as *' tasty ^' as the meat of 
the leg. If you have a good butcher, who will roll 
it nicely for you, it will be a good looking roast, 
too. It is roasted as is the leg. A roast saddle 
of mutton is also delicious. 

Trim and clean the leg of lamb — or mutton — 
wipe dry and sprinkle it with salt and pepper. 
Put it in a roasting pan, one with a rack if pos- 
sible, and dredge the meat with flour. Pour a half 
cup of hot water in the pan. Bake in a hot oven 
until the flour is brown; then lower the fire and 
roast, for lamb, two hours, basting frequently and 
if necessary adding water from time to time. 
Lamb should always be well done. Mutton is 
sometimes preferred rare, like beef. Vegetables 
— carrots, turnips and potatoes — are delicious 
when roasted in the pan with lamb. When carv- 
ing a leg of lamb for pity's sake don't let your 
husband slice it from side to side as he would 
roast beef. There's a special way to carve each 
piece of meat, and the rule is always to cut across 
the grain of meat — never with it. A leg of lamb 
should be cut down, straight to the bone. The 



Meat Recipes 135 



slices will lift away from the bone easily enough 
and the meat is more tender, as well as better 
looking, when carved properly.

skim well, add more hot water, if necessary, and 
put in your salt, pepper and thyme. (Of course 
you needn't use thyme if you don't like it, but 
it's a hint from the Greeks, who excel in the cook- 
ing of lamb, and you might try it once anyhow.) 
Add your onions and turnips and parsnips, cut 
in pieces about the size of the onions. Cook till 
meat and vegetables both seem growing tender, 
then add potatoes, peeled, which ought to cook in 
thirty minutes. When done put the meat in the 
center of a big platter and arrange the vegetables 
round about; thicken your gravy and pour over 
the whole, or serve in a gravy boat. It is some- 
times a very acceptable change to have dumplings 
with this stew instead of potatoes. Veal or beef 
can be substituted for the lamb in this stew, 
though veal stew is really better made with rice, 
and beef stew rather calls for the addition of 
tomatoes.

To make the best corned beef hash you ought 
first to boil your own corned beef. If you can't or 
won't do this, you can make a substitute that will 
taste fairly well out of canned corned beef. A 
good dish of corned beef hash is one of the most 
delectable things in the world. But a bad one is 
truly awful. Be sure your boiled potatoes are 



Meat Recipes 137 



cold before you chop them — otherwise, theyUl 
mash. Do not chop either meat or potatoes in the 
meat chopper. Do 'em by hand in the old wooden 
chopping bowl. Corned beef, like the potatoes, is 
too soft to be ground successfully. Chop the meat 
awhile first, then add the potatoes and chop to- 
gether so they'll be well blended. Chop medium 
fine but not so each piece absolutely loses its iden- 
tity. Turn into a skillet in which you already have 
your fat sizzling. Pour on about a third of a cup 
of water, turn your fire low, and putting on a 
cover, let your hash simmer a bit, then take off the 
cover, pat the hash down, let it brown on one side, 
turn the mass as evenly as you can, brown again 
and serve. It ought not to be soggy, it ought not 
to be dry, but crisp on the outside and soft in the 
middle.

Buy the whole of a small ham or half a big one,

to be cut before cooking. A shoulder, or Cali- 
fornia ham, if well cured, tastes just as good as 
the regular ham and looks very attractive on the 
table, too. It's generally lots cheaper. 

When you get the ham home scrape off any 
dubious looking spots and wash it with a stiif 
brush. Then soak it in warm water for at least 
two hours — over night is better. Take the ham 
from that water and put it into a kettle filled with 
cold water. Bring to the boiling point and then 
simmer slowly; put in the fireless cooker for at 
least three hours — four is better. Let the ham 
cool down in the liquor in which it was boiled. 
When cold, or nearly so, take out, put on a platter, 
and carefully remove the skin. Make a paste of 
the egg, sugar and crumbs ; spread it on the ham ; 
stick in rows of whole cloves, about a half an inch

apart; put in a roasting pan with about a cup 
of the liquor in which it boiled and bake for an 
hour and a half, slowly. Have the oven hot at 
first, though, so as to ^^sef the crackling. When 
this stops showing a desire to coast for the pan 
all the time, baste the ham with the liquor in the 
pan. If you have some sweet vinegar in which 
pears or peaches have been put up to pickle, use 
about half a cup of this to baste with. Serve with 
escalloped potatoes and spinach as a hot dish, 
though most folks just cook a ham to have it 
cold. 

At the last, the tag ends of a ham may be ground 
and made into croquettes, or served as a ham loaf. 
Either way is good. And ham hash is awfully 
good, too. 



Pork Tenderloin Stuffed

3 pork tenderloins 3 strips bacon 

11/2 cups poultry stuffing 1 tbsp. bacon grease 

Fresh pork is the very hardest meat in the 
world to digest and most American families eat 
entirely too much of it without any aid from me. 
My butcher says there are families who buy from 
him who patronize practically no animal but the 
pig. It isn't good for them — though pork cer- 
tainly does taste good. But do try to have pork 
for a treat rather than an everyday affair — or 
even an every week dish. Ham is not so hard to 
digest, for some reason — I mean smoked ham, of 
course, not fresh — and crisp bacon, properly 



142 The Calorie Cook Book 

broiled or baked until the fat is out of it, is not 
at all hard to digest. So I am going to put in this 
book just one little lone, lorn pork recipe. The 
excess eating of pig must be on your own shoul- 
ders. So — buy the tenderloins and have them 
split lengthwise, but not cut in two. Wash them, 
wipe them dry, and lay on each half a cup of 
stuffing such as you'd use for a hen. Bring the 
meat up around the dressing as much as you can 
and fasten mth string, which must be removed be- 
fore serving, of course. Have one tablespoon of 
bacon grease heating in a baking pan and pour 
over the tenderloins. Over each put a strip of 
bacon. Place the meat in a moderate oven and 
bake about an hour. Fresh pork, like veal, 
must be very, very, very well done. The rawer it 
is the less digestible it is. Make milk gravy in the 
pan in which the meat was cooked.

Roast Chicken 
Edible Porticm, 1045 Calories per Pound 
Select a chicken with smooth skin, soft feet, and 
a pliable breast bone. If you get hold of one 
decorated with long hairs, beware ! Roast it long 
and tenderly, or don^t roast it at all — stew it. Be 
sure a chicken is thoroughly clean, inside and out. 
After washing, dry it well and rub a little salt 
over body, wings and legs. Stuff it carefully^ 
being particular to plump out the breast so it i? 
even and rounded, not lumpy. Sew the chicken 
up. For this you will find that the soft white cord 
that comes on your grocery parcels is best. It 
doesn't tear the flesh as thread does. Tie the 
legs together and fasten them close to the sides. 
Now make a paste of flour and creamy butter, 
about two tablespoonfuls of each, and spread it 
over the legs and breast; then dredge the whole 
with flour and lay the chicken in a roasting pan. 
on its back. Add a very little hot water to the pan. 
place in a hot oven, and when the flour has 
browned lower the heat. Baste with three table- 



144 The Calorie Coolc Book 

spoonfuls of melted butter, mixed with half a cup 
of boiling water. After you have used this mix- 
ture there will be enough fat in the pan for bast- 
ing. It will very likely be necessary to add a cup 
of boiling water to the liquid in the pan. Fre- 
quent basting adds to the taste of the chicken and 
prevents it from becoming too dry. Do not roast 
too rapidly. For a five-pound chicken allow about 
two hours.

hot water until it is within about an inch of the 
top of the casserole. Put on the cover and place

Fried Chicken 
Broilers, Edible Portion, 505 Calories per Pound 
Be sure your chicken is young and tender, 
though a broiler is not necessary. Clean the bird 
and cut it up. Roll each piece thoroughly in flour 
in which salt and pepper have been mixed and 
drop pieces in a frying pan half full of hot fat. 
Cover tightly and cook till brown on one side, turn, 
cover and brown on the other. Sometimes it is 
best to first parboil the chicken slightly, to be 
sure it will be tender. Wlien done lay on a hot 
platter, drain off most of the fat from the pan, 
pour in skimmed milk, thicken with a paste of 
flour, stirring all the time, and let it simmer at 
least five minutes. Pour this gravy over the 
chicken or serve in a separate dish.

Turn out the pies on the plates on which they are

Fricasseed Chicken 

Fowls, Edible Portion, 1045 Calories per Pound 
For this style of cooking, you do not need a 
young chicken, though, of course, no elderly hens 
or rooster rivals of Methuselah should gain ad- 
mittance to your cooking pot. Clean the fowl well, 
put in the sauce pan and cover with boiling water. 
Cover and stew gently until the chicken is tender 
when pricked with a fork. This will take any- 
where from two to four hours, according to the 
fowl in question. If the chicken is not very fat 
add a quarter pound of salt pork cut in dice. 
When done, thicken the liquor in the pan with 
flour. This dish is good when noodles are cooked 
with the chicken for the last thirty minutes of 
stewing, or when dumplings are served with it 
In either case a good deal more liquor is necessary 
than when only gravy is to be considered, as both 
noodles and dumplings use up an astonishing 
amount of fluid. So, if you decide on either, be 



Meat Recipes 147 



sure and have plenty of water added to the stock, 
though, of course, you mustn^t drown the chicken 
in it or you'll lose all flavor. Enough to almost 
cover the chicken when the dumplings or noodles 
are put in will be about right.

Broiled Chicken 
Edible Portion 505 Calories per Pound 
For broiling you need young and tender 
chickens. You can camouflage a fairly old bird 
for frying but broiling brooks no deceit. Split 
the bird open, cut the tendons at all joints, clean 
thoroughly, dry, sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
and arrange on a hot well-greased broiler. Broil 
at least twenty minutes, taking great care that all 
parts shall be cooked evenly and that the chicken 
does not burn. If you are very much afraid of 
its burning you can give it a good running start 
in the nice safe hot oven and finish it on the 
broiler. Bake it, in a well-buttered pan, about 
fifteen minutes, then set in the broiler and finish. 
Before serving spread with butter and scatter a 
tiny bit of chopped parsley over the meat.

Beat the egg and add that, then add the milk or

148 The Calorie Cooh Book 

are to be cooked in liquid full of fat from the meat 
that has been boiling in it. The dumplings may 
either be rolled out and cut, like biscuit, or simply 
dropped from the spoon. If this is to be done, it 
is better to use a full cup of milk in mixing them. 
The dumplings must not sink down in the liquid 
but must rest on the meat, so they can rise up 
light and puffy. It is a good plan to throw a very 
little cold water into the pot just before putting 
in the dumplings, so that the water will not be 
boiling just as they go in. Put them in as rapidly 
as possible, and after they are in put on a tight 
cover and boil steadily but not too rapidly for 
twenty minutes. Lots of folks have an idea good 
dumplings are hard to make. They're not — only 
you mustn't fuss with them. Don't keep looking 
to see how they're getting on or they'll be as hard 
and leathery as can be. Keep that tight, tight 
cover on the full twenty minutes before you peek, 
and when you do you'll see something worth look- 
ing at, let alone tasting.

have chicken with dumplings, if you're wise you'll 
make more dumplings than you'll need. Then 
next day put the left-over chicken in a greased 
baking pan, add gravy, or some white sauce if

no gravy was left, or half a can of clear chicken 
soup — store soup — thickened. Then on top put the 
left-over dumplings, crowding them together till 
you have a rather solid top to the pie ; brush them 
lightly with a little bit of water; put the dish in 
the oven and bake. It'll be the best chicken pie 
you ever tasted. It doesn't need much cooking, 
everything being already done. It ought to be 
ready for the table in twenty minutes.

Roast Turkey 

Turkey, 1360 Calories per Pound 
Turkey is the king of the winter table. It may 
be that there are people who don^t enjoy roast 
turkey, but the poor things are luckily few. But — 
if you aren^t careful, your turkey will not be as 
good as he ought to be. First, don't pick out a 
bird whose breast bone is as unbending as iron, 
and the legs shouldn't be nice and white, but sort 
of bluish. Gentlemen turkeys are said to be best, 
but I think that's sex prejudice. I've had some 
delectable meals from lady birds. Clean your tur- 
key thoroughly, pull the tendons from the legs — 
if you can — and cut out the oil bag at the root of 
the tail. Wash, and then dry him, inside and out. 
Have the dressing ready, and pack it into the 
breast first, so you will be sure to have enough to 
give the bird a proud and swelling breast to pre- 
sent to the table. Sew up neatly with cord. It 
generally looks best if you cut off the neck, and 
draw the skin neatly backward and sew it into 
place so the front of the bird is all smooth and 
even. Put the rest of the dressing into the body 
and sew up that vent. Then rub the whole bird 
over with salt and a paste made of two table- 
spoons of butter and two of flour creamed together. 
Fasten down the legs and wings and lay him in a 



Meat Recipes 151 



big double roaster, which has a cup of hot water 
in the bottom. Put the pan into a very hot oven 
and when the flour has b^gun to brown turn down 
the fire and roast slowly. Three hours and a half 
for a ten-pound bird, more and more the bigger 
they get. Turkey should be well done and should 
be turned over in the pan from time to time. 
Baste the bird often while roasting. Three- 
quarters of an hour before he is done slip about 
him a necklace of half a dozen little link sausages 
and let them roast with him. When he is done re- 
move him to a hot platter, necklace and all. Pour 
off some of the grease in the pan and make the 
rest into gravy, thicken it with flour stirred to a 
paste with cold water. If you like giblet gravy, 
boil or roast the gizzard, heart and liver, chop 
them fine, and add to the gravy. When serving 
the fowl add a sausage to each serving. It's a 
wonderful addition. You can cook some extra 
ones in a pan and lay them around on the platter, 
with sprigs of parsley, so there'll be plenty, but 
don't roast too many on the bird or there'll l3e too 
much sausage fat in the gravy.

% cup chopped prunes Salt 

Cook the prunes until they are very soft. If 
they are sweet, use no sugar. Stone them and 
chop them. Make a rather dry apple sauce, adding 
some sugar but no flavoring. The dressing should

not be distinctly sweet. Mix the three ingredients 
together, salt to your own taste, and fill up the 
duck. To be sure there are no special directions 
for roast duck in this book, so the dressing may 
be not strictly au fait, but the preparing and roast- 
ing of a duck does not differ materially from the 
modus operandi of getting any other sort of fowl 
ready to be introduced to your carving knife. 

But the average goose is better with this dress- 
ing than with one made in the ordinary way. If 
you want something else again, try equal por- 
tions of mashed potato and onions boiled very 
soft, mixed up together. That's ever so good, too. 



Turkey Dressing

1 large loaf of bread (1% lb. 14 cup milk

1 onion 1 tsp. poultry seasoning 

1 clove of garlic % tsp. powdered thyme 

% cup fat Salt and pepper 

There is nothing that puzzles me in the general 
run of modern cook books as do the recipes for 
poultry dressing. They read to the woman who 
has cooked like advice to one about to roast a 
bantam hen of a particularly small variety, or 
maybe a nice fat robin. ^^One cup of crumbs'' is 
suggested. And one cup of cracker crumbs at 
that. Now I never made cracker crumb dressing. 
I never knew anybody else that made it, so it is 
very likely indeed that I do not know how per- 
fectly delicious it is. But in my own little private 



Meat Recipes 153 



cook book I'm going to set down another sort. 

First, it will differ in quantity. I have never 
roasted a hen whose interior would be comfortably 
filled with one cup of crumbs of any variety, and 
for a fifteen, or even a twelve-pound turkey, you 
can generally use up two loaves of bread. The 
bread must not be too fresh — nor too stale. It is 
best about two days old. Crumb it up in your 
hands, breaking it into pieces about as big as the 
end of your finger. If the crust is not too hard, 
that can be used, too. After breaking it up, salt 
and pepper it to taste, add the poultry seasoning, 
the th}Tne and an equal amount of powdered sage 
if you fancy it ; mix it aU up well, cover, and let 
stand an hour or so. Chop the onion, garlic and 
celery into small pieces and cook in a little water 
until almost done. Pour this over the dressing 
and mix thoroughly again. Add the milk. If 
your bread is pretty dry or you have a great deal, 
you may need more milk. You will have to use 
your judgment. The dressing should be moist 
enough so it can be squeezed into a ball, but you 
shouldn't be able to squeeze out a drop of liquid. 
Now comes a thing that is an innovation. I learned 
it from a friend who brought the idea from Vir- 
ginia. Put the fat — butter, margarine or bacon or 
ham fat — into a frying pan, an iron one, and fry 
the dressing. It does make it extra good, but, oh, 
how careful you have to be to see it doesn't burn! 
When it has been pretty well browned, let it cool, 
and stuff the breast and body of the turkey. Of 
course, this same recipe is used for chicken, too. 



Meat Substitutes 

It is hardly fair to advise people to eat less meat 
and not help them a bit in filling its place. It 
would be awfully funny, if it weren't pathetic, to 
see the expression of bewilderment that comes to 
the average face when a dinner minus meat is 
suggested. Some of my dearest friends are vege- 
tarians, and when I speak of entertaining them 
people say in hushed voices, **But how do you 
dare to do it? What do you feed them? And how 
do you manage to get along when you actually 
stay at their house?'* 

I get along very well. I enjoy it. I'm quite 
willing to admit right here — as I do in their own 
homes — that after a bit I hanker for the crispy 
taste of a broiled lamb chop, for a slice of beef 
steak of just the most delectable shade of pink, 
for bacon, or chicken, or a bit of fish. But when 
I'm not at their house I think with longing of nut 
roasts, Protose croquettes, or the wonderful dishes 
of mushrooms they serve. You see, your true 
vegetarian has a few dainties that ordinary mor- 
tals wot not of. Protose croquettes now! What 
is Protose? I'll bet a hole with a cooky 'round 
it you don't know. 

Why it's vegetarian meat. A substitute. And 
it's good. It is really a conglomeration of grains 
made into a sort of loaf and packed in cans. You 
have to buy it at vegetarian centers, I believe, but 

154 



Meat Substitutes 155 

if you take the trouble to hunt it up you won't re- 
gret doing so. And at the place where you pro- 
cure Protose you can get a list of other vegetarian 
goodies. 

Unless you have friends in the vegetarian camp 
you won't know their pet ways of cooking. The 
best and very likely the most complete vegetarian 
cook book on the market is ''The New Cookery" 
by Lenna Frances Cooper, and I have taken the 
liberty of ^^ lifting" a few of her recipes for you. 
She, too, has given the calorie value of her dishes. 
I have, of course, no means to discover the calorie 
value of Protose. I couldn't add up her recipes 
myself if I tried. So I hope she '11 forgive me for 
just annexing the whole thing. Her recipes I have 
marked with her initials, and I've put in some 
others too, giving you quite a choice of meat sub- 
stitutes. 

Notice, please, that there are few egg recipes 
among them. Why the average brain flops egg- 
ward only when a meatless meal is in view, is 
beyond my comprehension, but it generally does, 
and your vegetarian, who looks on an egg as a 
breakfast or luncheon staple, just as the rest ot 
us do, is pretty generally egged to the point of 
repletion when he dines out. 

You will notice that Nuttolene is also mentioned 
in The New Cookery recipes, and, of course, you'll 
expect me to tell you what it is, but I can't. I 
shall have to speak sharply to my vegetarian 
friends. They have been remiss, and let Nuttolene 
remain unknown to me. But it'll be easy enough 



156 The Calorie Cook Book 

to find out from vegetarian headquarters, if you 
are interested. There are other strange things 
mentioned in that book. I think that I shall go 
adventuring some day. Part of the fun of going 
to foreign countries is to eat foreign foods and 
bring home foreign recipes with which to astound 
and delight your friends. Why not take advan- 
tage of new things right here at home?

The dressing being just about the same as that

There are directions for chipped Protose in

Protose steak with onions, which has a natural 
sound to the ears of a meat eater and a natural 
look to eyes used to reading meat recipes. It is 
tasty to meat-eating lips I know. 

Then comes this new Nuttolene stuff, with di- 
rections for broiling that, like the recipe for 
broiled Protose, and roast Nuttolene, to be served 
with mint sauce, mighty like lamb, and Nuttolene 
creamed with hard boiled eggs — ^thank goodness, 
this cooking person talks of them being hard 
boiled in the good old fashioned way! No ^^hard 
cooked" evasions for her! Then Nuttolene is to 
be taken from the can whole, cut in halves and 
baked surrounded by a cup of stewed tomatoes, 
staying in the oven for an hour. I gather that 
Nuttolene averages about 803 c. a pound. Vege- 
table Ham calls for not only Nuttolene but also 
another dark entry — I really couldn't say dark 
horse when discussing a vegetarian food product, 
could I? — and demands also Vegetable Gelatine, 
so I won't copy that for you. Too many strangers

There, that is all from The New Cookery, There 
are plenty more enticing looking suggestions for 
meatless meals — naturally, it being compiled for 
those whose whole meals are entirely meatless for 
ever and ever, amen — and many goodies in the line 
of desserts that sound new. You will note that 
there is no mention of pepper in any of the above. 
Vegetarians do not approve of pepper. They say 
it is very bad for the * innards,'' and don't use it, 
but it can of course be added by unbelievers. 
Though it is always well to remember that all 
*^hof things are truly too irritating and too stim- 
ulating and should be indulged in with discretion 
at all times. 

In arranging meatless meals remember that a 
central dish to take the place of a roast is not 
really necessary. We eat meat for its protein 



Meat Substitutes 163 

value — though we most of us think we eat it only 
because it's good — and of course the protein must 
be supplied to furnish energy and to upbuild the 
tissues of the body. The meat substitutes are 
eggs, cheese, nuts and the vegetables of the ever- 
helpful bean family, but milk has a lot of protein 
value, too. So, for instance, if you have a dinner 
of baked potatoes, creamed celery, hot graham 
muffins, honey, salad; a dessert of custard or ice 
cream or junket; and maybe milk or cocoa to 
drink, youVe protein enough right there. We 
housewives have just got this notion of sajdng 
*'I11 have beefsteak for dinner" and thinking 
the whole meal is planned and the other dishes 
are simply the chorus girls supporting the star. 

However, we admit that a central dish is desir- 
able — makes the table look sort of rounded out 
and satisfies our inherited ideas of convention, too. 

One of the best is a bean loaf. 



Kidney Bean Loaf

^ lb. red kidney beans 2 eggs 

2 cups bread crumbs 1 tsp. salt 

1 small onion Pepper and paprika, and 

4 large stalks celery thyme 

3 tbsps. butter or margarine 

Soak the kidney beans over night. Have the 
onion and celery chopped and when the beans are 
ready put them, with the onion, celery and a pinch 
of powdered thyme — or sage, if you prefer it — 
to cook together in boiling water. When the beans 



164 The Calorie Cook Book 

are quite soft drain them thoroughly. Stir into 
them the melted fat, the bread crumbs, the eggs 
slightly beaten, and the seasoning. Mix all thor- 
oughly. If the mass seems so dry as to be crumbly 
and threatens not to hold its shape, add a little 
milk. Pack it tightly in a well greased baking dish 
and bake half an hour. It is good served with left- 
over gravy from some other meal or with tomato 
sauce. If you bake it with two or three strips of 
bacon across the top you'll have fat enough in the 
pan to make some gravy right there and won't 
accumulate enough meat to spoil the record of the 
day for any but a real vegetarian. This may also 
be made with navy beans or split peas, or dried 
lima beans. 



Baked Lima Beans 

975 Calories 
y2 lb. dried lima beans iy2 tbsps. molasses

Soak the beans over night. Parboil them in hot 
water in which you have put half a teaspoon of 
baking soda, cooking gently about half an hour. 
Drain in a colander, and rim cold water over them. 
Thoroughly scrape and clean the rind of the piece 
of pork. Make deep slashes in the meat, almost to 
the rind. Put it and the beans to cook in more hot 
water and cook gently till the beans are soft. 
They cook more quickly than the navy beans. 
Then put the beans in a greased baking dish, add- 
ing the molasses and stirring it through them,

need. Then bury the pork in the beans, rind side 
up, and add a little clear hot water. Bake slowly 
for an hour.

greased baking dish. If too dry moisten with the 
water from the vegetables, or milk. Dot bits of 
fat over the top and bake about half an hour. By 
using two eggs you can mold this into a regula- 
tion loaf and bake in a roasting pan. It is better 
and prettier if you make for it milk gravy, with 
milk and butter and flour, into which a half cup of 
peas are stirred. 

This can be called a vegetable loaf, for the bene- 
fit of those who pride themselves on being above 
carrots. It generally fools 'em. Sliced cold and 
fried, for a second day dish, IVe known it to be 
eaten and praised loudly by those who would have 
fled in horror from the mere mention of its humble

,, , It seems to be the style nowadays to say **hard 
cuoked'' eggs, instead of *^hard boiled," the 
leaders of cooking schools explaining that an ^gg 
should never, never be allowed to do such a horrid 
thing as boil. But when I say *^hard cook" your 
eggs, be sure I don't mean fry 'em hard or 
scramble 'em to leather. Put them in hot water 
and let it do something to them long enough to 
make them resemble the hard boiled stage of our 
youthful picnic experiences. Then slice them 
lengthwise, lay them in a well buttered, shallow

butter and flour; add enough finely chopped red 
pimento to look pretty and taste good; pour it 
over the eggs; pop the dish into a hot oven and 
bake about ten minutes. Good served on toast. 



Broiled Mushrooms

1 lb. mushrooms 1 tbsp. butter 

Salt and pepper Toast 

Brush the mushrooms, remove stems and save 
for sauce or soup. Peel the caps and put them on 
a well buttered broiler cap side up. After that 
side has cooked, turn them and in the little cups 
now uppermost place bits of butter, salt and pep-

ready and put the mushrooms on it, being very 
careful when serving not to upset the little cups 
and lose out the melted butter. 



Egg Cutlets 

1840 Calories 
6 eggs 6 rounds of toast 

1/4 lb. strong American cheese 6 tbsps, whole milk 
2 tbsps. butter or margarine Salt and paprika 

First, cut the bread in rounds, slightly bigger 
than your gem pans, and quite thick — about half 
an inch. Butter, with part of the butter. Grate 
the cheese, spread the bread with that and bake 
until brown. Break the eggs into well buttered 
gem pans, pour a tablespoon of hot milk over each 
and bake till they can be lifted out without break-

ing. Salt them, put a generous dash of paprika 
over each. Take the bread and the eggs from the 
oven at once, if you can time it that way; put 
an egg on top of each round of toast and serve. 
Sometimes the cheese gets humpy and refuses to 
let the egg stay balanced, in which case you can 
generally accomplish your end by laying the 
round of toast on the platter cheese side down, 
landing your egg successfully on the unadorned 
side.

Brush the mushrooms well, remove the stems,

and caps into boiling water — barely enough to 
cover — and cook ten minutes. Drain, saving the 
water in which they cooked, and drop them into 
a frying pan in which the butter has been heating. 
Salt and pepper them to taste. Brown them on 
both sides, then add the cream and any of the 
water in which they were cooked which may be 
left, and cook a minute longer. Arrange the toast 
on a hot platter, place the mushrooms on the toast, 
pour over the cream and serve. If the mushrooms 
are thick meaty ones, I prefer them boiled fifteen 
minutes. Most cook books call for only five min- 
utes. You buys your mushrooms and you takes

the onion fine, add a finely shaved clove of garlic 
too, if you like it, and fry till a golden brown in 
the oil. Strain the tomatoes, add them, and cook 
all together. Put the spaghetti into the pan and 
cook with the sauce till it is thoroughly heated, 
then pile on a platter and serve with grated 
cheese. The hard Italian cheese that you may 
buy at any Italian grocery is best.

As to Salads 

I would like to make a few salad remarks, as I 
made some soupy ones, and though, of course, you 
needn't read them I don't see how you can stop 
my making them. 

Eemember, then — almost every known thing 
will go into a salad and almost every known thing 
is improved by the application of salad dressing. 
Cold veal makes wonder salad. If you have no 
particular demand for sweet and shining truth in 
your soul you can call it chicken salad and fool 
'most anybody. Cold lamb is good mixed up with 
peas and celery — and dressing. So is any kind of 
fowl that flies — or any sort of fish that swims. 
Beef's a bit chewy somehow, but beef salad has 
been made — and eaten. Any cold vegetables may 
be gathered up and whisked into a salad in no time 
at all. And the combinations of fruit are as end- 
less as are the fruits themselves. 

Too few know how delicious an addition to 
salads fresh mint may be. My mint bed had been 
so fearfully misjudged. I always have one when 
I can, yet liquid refreshment doesn't enter into 
my desires at all — though I will say that a sprig 
of mint crushed and put into the pitcher of cold 
tea is delectable, and it adds a wonderful spice 
to lemonade. There, now — no amendments broken 
after all. 

But in salads! Just try mint on cucumbers —

It adds a zest to tomatoes. It improves any com- 
bination salad ever combined by mortal hand. And 
in potato salad it's just wonderful. 

Nasturtium leaves are good too, but are not 
quite as universally liked as mint, and the green 
nasturtium seeds are often used instead of capers.

Fruit Salad

Fruit dressing 

Fruit salad is, of course, made of any sort of 
fruit, but this is an especially happy combination 
to come after a heavy, hot dinner, or to use for 
Sunday night tea on a warm night. Served with 
a dressing made of half mayonnaise or boiled 
dressing, and half whipped cream, with a light 
powdering of ground nuts mixed in, it is excellent 



As to Salads 187 



as a combination salad and dessert. After a big 
dinner it would be so often best for us if we did 
combine these two courses and have the combina- 
tion made of fruit. Well — to the main point. Get 
solid oranges, cut them in two, and cut the grape 
fruit. Eemove the fruit meat as neatly as pos- 
sible and pile the little triangular sections in a 
bowl. Cut the pineapple in sections about the 
same size and mix. Take juice from all three 
fruits and mix with an equal amount of French 
dressing; drench the fruit with it and serve on 
lettuce. Or arrange the mixed fruit on individual 
plates and place the dressing in a bowl, so each 
person can help himself. 



Combination Salad 
Really it 's rather silly to give amounts or direc- 
tions for this. Combination salad is generally a 
mixture of tomatoes, cucumbers and onions, but 
almost any cold vegetable can be fitted in. Rad- 
ishes are good with everything ; so are beets, plain 
boiled or pickled ; and string beans or peas add a 
great deal to any salad combination that there is. 
If you just combine what you have on hand, or buy 
a combination ever^^one will approve, and put it 
together with French dressing, on lettuce leaves, 
why that is combination salad and sure to be a 
success. Cucumbers, celery, lettuce, have little 
value in calories. Tomatoes have a bit more, 
onions a little more, peas and beans more still. 
While in round numbers you can count French 
dressing at 100 calories a tablespoonful, it is really 



188 The Calorie CooJc Boole 

less, some of the tablespoon of dressing being 
composed of oil. Sort of figure it out yourself. 



Apple, Date and Nut Salad

nuts together; pile on lettuce leaves on plates, 
put a tablespoon of mayonnaise and whipped 
cream, mixed, on each pile, and on the dressing lay 
the whole walnut meat, as a garnish. This salad 
should not be used, except in very small portions, 
as a regular salad course. Use as given for salad

fresh cod or halibut or salmon is best, but all 
are good. Or open a can of salmon or tuna fish if 
you have no left-overs and just want fish salad 
because you want it. Flake the fish, mix it with 
the celery, add the capers, or if you haven't them, 
or don 't like them, chopped parsley or chives. Mix

Grind the nut meats very fine. Arrange the 
halves of pears on beds of lettuce ; sprinkle over 
them the chopped nuts and top with mayonnaise. A 
very delicious dressing for this salad is made by 
mixing the mayonnaise, half and half, with 
whipped cream. It has the same food value as the 
pure mayonnaise. A slightly smaller calorie value 
may be gained by using a dressing made of half 
French dressing and half fruit juice — ^pear and 
grape juice or pear and peach juice blended.

add the water, and bake in a moderate oven about 
thirty minutes — till the bananas are brown. It 
may be necessary to add more water before they

starch and stir until thick. Take from the fire, 
add a pinch of salt and two teaspoons vanilla.

a time, stirring well. Pour into one large or six 
individual buttered moulds ; grate a dash of nut- 
meg over the top, and put in a shallow pan of hot 
water — hot, but not boiling. Have the oven slow 
and bake until you can run a silver knife into the 
custard and have it come out clean. If the oven 



198 The Calorie Cook Book 

gets too hot, or the water in the surrounding pan 
boils, the custard will be watery. This custard, 
baked in individual cups, should turn out in soKd 
form on a serving dish. To be certain it will do 
this, if you bake it all in one mould, add another 
egg. You can make a very good baked custard, to 
be served from the dish in which it was baked, by 
using only three eggs.

add the hot milk, stirring all the time. Last, add 
the cornstarch dissolved in a little cold milk. Cook 
in a double boiler until it becomes thick and a film 
of it forms over the spoon. Take from the fire at 
once, flavor, and if it is at all lumpy, strain. Pour 
into a serving dish — it looks prettiest in glass. 
Beat the egg whites to a stiff froth, adding to them 
a heaping tablespoon of powdered sugar, lemon 
or vanilla flavoring, and about a third of a tea- 
spoonful of baking powder, which helps the me- 
ringue to stand up. This is sometimes varied by 
beating into the meringue any jelly with a bright 
color, to serve as flavoring and coloring both. 
Drop this meringue by the spoonful on top of the 
custard, when the custard has cooled, and serve 
very cold.

the dough over, put on more berries, and so on till 
your roll is full. Pinch the dough together so the 
roll will be as neat as possible — huckleberries are 
possessed to hurry to all sorts of places where you 
don't want them. Lay the roll on a pan or plate

dates, in even rows, and when the pan is full, pour

over them the milk. Let the dish stand at least 
two hours, so the dates are well soaked with the 
milk. Then sprinkle the nuts over the top and 
bake five minutes in a moderate oven. This is 
ever so handy a dessert, as it can be made the 
day before and served cold or the dates may be 
put to soak at noon and baked while the dinner is 
cooking, to serve hot at night. It is good as long 
as a bit lasts and with a little extra milk added 
can be reheated if preferred hot. Good with cream 
or whipped cream, but doesn^t demand either, as 
it is quite rich enough in itself.

care to cook your own, buy canned. Very good 
pies can be born out of a can. Add your spices 
and sugar and mix them in well. Beat the eggs 
thoroughly, and then stir them in, adding the milk 
last. Pour into a pastry shell and bake slowly at 
least three-quarters of an hour. If eggs grow 
wings before their time and soar up to unheard

well. 



Apple Pie 

2140 Calories 

5 medium sized tart apples ^ tsp. nutmeg or cinnamon 

% cup sugar Salt 

1 tsp. butter 

Line a pie pan with pastry, letting it come well 
over the edge. Peel and core the apples and slice 
them into the pan, making an even, rounding 
mound. Pour over them the sugar — it is very 
good to use half brown sugar — the nutmeg or cin- 
namon, and dot bits of butter here and there. 
Some people like the addition of a tea spoonful 
of lemon juice. If you do not use that put in a tea- 
spoonful of water. If the apples are very dry you 
may need a little more water. Moisten the edges 
of the under crust, lay the upper crust over, and 
pinch the edges tightly together, then trim off 
the surplus crust. Prick a few holes in the top 
crust to allow the steam to escape. If you're ar- 
tistic you can make very stunning designs in a 
pie top. 



Mince Pie — Mince Meat

There are people aplenty who have the good old 
fashioned notion of ** putting down the mince

art. Not alone because the city woman thinks she 
hasn't time for the process, but because she very, 
very seldom has the space for the finished product. 
There are many good prepared mince meats on 
the market but all I have ever tried needed a little 
doctoring. They are the better for adding a bit 
of suet, some extra raisins, a chopped apple, thos;e 
three extra dates Tommie forgot to eat, or the 
fig preserves that have been around so long every- 
one 's sick of them. Mince meat may cover a mul- 
titude of left-overs in the fruit line and be the 
better for 'em. Also I have discovered that in 
these arid days, it is good to save the spiced vine- 
gar from sweet pickled pears and peaches and 
pour it into mince pies. It makes them good. I 
can't give a set list of articles for mince pie. Just 
add most anything to a good mercantile founda- 
tion, put it snugly between two crusts; bake it 
slowly and evenly till the crust is a delicate brown, 
and it's apt to be pretty tasty.

which has already been baked. Beat the whites 
of the eggs to a stiff meringue, adding one table- 
spoon of sugar and one-half teaspoon baking 
powder. Spread on top of pie, and put it into a 
very quick oven, or under the broiler, for just long 
enough to brown the top. This pie is generally 
served cold, but is good warm. Some cooks find 
it difficult to bake a pastry shell evenly and well 
inside a pie tin, and so turn the pan upside down, 
stretch the pastry over it, prick here and there 
with a fork to keep it from bubbling, and bake it 
that way. It is not nearly so apt to shrink out 
of shape. Pastry enough for one shell can be 
made from two-thirds of a cup of flour and a scant 
quarter cup of shortening.

Butter a baking dish and scatter in it some of 
the bread crumbs. Pit the prunes, which have 
been cooked till soft; put in a layer of fruit; 
sprinkle over some of each kind of sugar and the 
merest dash of cinnamon ; cover with crumbs ; dot 
the crumbs with butter; put in another layer of

half an hour in a moderate oven. Serve with 
either hard or liquid sauce. Of course, you can 
make a pudding richer, and so tastier, by adding 
more sugar and butter. If you are not reducing, 
you can; otherwise, mind your calories. 



Apple Slump 
1180 Calories Without Sauce 

5 medium sized tart apples % cup white flour 

1/2 cup granulated and 1 tsp. baking powder 

brown sugar, mixed 1 tsp. sugar 

Cinnamon or nutmeg % tsp. salt 

1 tsp. butter 1 tbsp. cooking fat 

Pare and slice your apples and lay them in a 
buttered baking dish. Sift over them the sugar, 
cinnamon, nutmeg, or maybe cloves, to taste, and 
dot with the teaspoonful of butter. Pour in gently 
enough water to almost but not quite cover them. 
Then make a paste of your other ingredients. Sift 
the salt, sugar and baking powder well into the 
flour; rub in the fat; add enough water to make 
a stiff paste ; roll it, or pat it between your hands, 
until it is the right size and shape to cover your 
dish of apples. Lay it on. Pop the dish inio a 
moderate oven and bake until the apples are done, 
which they ought to be in thirty or forty minutes. 
Glass baking dishes are very nice for this sort of 
pudding — you can see so plainly what the insides 
are up to. Serve with a pitcher of whole milk, 
cream, or sauce, as you prefer. Eemember, milk's

till very fine. Serve in sherbet glasses, each 
topped with a teaspoon of whipped cream, or in 
one large pudding dish with dabs of whipped 
cream over it. If the prunes used were not cooked 
with sugar, a Httle more may be needed. Some 
people like this dessert put in a pudding dish and 
baked a few minutes in a hot oven, as one would 
bake the meringue on top of a pie. In this case, 
of course, the whipped cream would best be added 
at the table. If you're reducing don't have the 
whipped cream at all.

half a dozen little old-time red cinnamon candies

Apples may be done this way, and quinces, too, 
but it does take a quince all eternity plus to cook 
tender. 



Junket 

This is not so much a recipe for junket as a dis- 
sertation on junket. Junket is, to many families, 
one of its greatest lost opportunities. Compara- 
tively few seem to use it, and yet in families where 
it is known it is generally as popular as ice cream. 
It is one of the very easiest things to make and 
one of the most healthful that can be eaten. You 
can swing its food value up or down to a very 
great degree. Also, it is cheap. 

You buy the little round junket tablets at gro- 
cery or drug store for fifteen cents a box. There 
are twelve tablets in a box. If you have a small 
family and use only half a tablet and a pint of 
milk at a time, that means twenty-four times you 
can have junket from one box — not far from a 
half a cent a time. To this add the cost of milk 
and a little sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla or some 
grated nutmeg. There you are ! Could anything 
be simpler? 

The best directions for making the junket are 
right on the boxes, and your only trouble will be 
in following them. You must not get your milk 



Recipes for Desserts 213 

too hot. You must let it **sef in a warm room 
before chilling. You must have fresh sweet milk 
that has never been frozen. Given all these things 
and you have at your quick command as deliciously 
smooth and soft and melting a dish as you could 
wish. And people who won't drink milk, and 
need it, can often be persuaded to take what they 
need via the junket route. 

Junket is an acknowledged dish for invalids, and 
a fine baby food. One of my friends was aston- 
ished — I thought a bit horrified — to discover it 
was ever considered as anything else. But to 
keep it from your own table because it is those two 
things would be like saying, *^0h, no ice cream — 
that's only for fever patients!" 

The junket tablets themselves have little food 
value. If you use whole milk, a cupful, really 
full you know, gives you 160 calories, with two 
teaspoons of sugar 40 calories more, making a 
round two hundred. If you use skimmed milk, 
and but one spoon of sugar, which makes a pala- 
table dish, you just cut that sum neatly in two, and 
get a good dessert for 100 calories — ^which is not 
easy. I'm rooting for junket. Try it yourself.

to make a paste stiff enough to hold its shape 
when dropped from a spoon. Put the grape juice 
in a pan that has a tight cover, and bring to a

boil. Now, as the dumplings must have something 
to rest on, put in this pan, bottom side up, a small 
flat sieve or an old pie pan with a few holes 
punched in it — anything that will hold the dum- 
plings up and not interfere with the boiling of the 
grape juice. When the grape juice boils, throw in 
one-fourth cup of cold water and before it has a 
chance to start bubbling again, drop in the dum- 
plings — rather small dumplings. Cover tightly 
and let boil for fifteen to twenty minutes, steadily 
but not too energetically. Serve the dumplings on 
a platter or chop plate, surrounded and covered 
by the grape juice.

seems clear. Add the pineapple, pour into a serv- 
ing dish and set away to cool. If you are on re- 
ducing bent, make this with water instead of milk. 
It's good. If you're fattening up, see that it's 
made of whole milk — maybe use some extra cream. 
The recipe is computed with skim milk.

in summer, in a woods-cottage where there was no 
ice or cellar. I generally double the recipe and 
put it up in half -pint jars. If you wish you can 
use three eggs, put the yolks only in the mayon-

Then begin to add your oil, gradually, oh, very 
very gradually, if you would avert disaster ! Stir 
constantly, and as the mixture thickens thin it 
with the vinegar and lemon juice. Add these and 
the oil till all is used. It helps to have the bowl 
very cold and the oil very, very cold. To make this

add the rest of the butter, cut in tiny pieces. This 
drawn butter sauce is the basis of many sauces, 
or it can be used by itself. It is good as it is with 
fish. For fresh boiled salmon, cod, halibut or had-

boiled eggs, chopped. For boiled leg of mutton — 
and if youVe never tried that dish, get hold of a

eggs thoroughly, and beat them in. Add salt and 
baking powder to about a cup of flour, beating 
well, and add gradually, till the mixture is thick 
enough to hold its shape when dropped on a but- 
tered pan. This cake is very good flavored with 
a dash of nutmeg, but vanilla or orange is good 
in it, too. It can also be baked in buttered gem 
pans and appear as little frosted cup cakes.

21/2 tbsps. shortening ^ tsp. grated nutmeg 

2 eggs 1 tsp. salt 

1 cup milk ^ tsp. lemon juice or lemon 

4 tsps. baking powder extract 

4 cups flour 

Cream together the butter and one-half the 
sugar. Beat the Qgg until it is very light and add, 
then add the rest of the sugar. Add gradually 
about four cups of flour, through which has been 
sifted the baking powder, salt and spices. If the 
dough is stiff enough to roll, take out a part at a 
time, put on floured board and roll about one- 
fourth inch thick. You may have to add more 
flour before rolling. Cut mth a doughnut cutter 
and drop into deep hot fat. The fat must be kept 
at an even temperature, a temperature which will 
not let the doughnuts absorb the fat, and which 
will not brown them before they have raised suf- 
ficiently. They should be light and puffy, not hard 
little dark rings. Never try to handle all the dough 
at once. Use the trimmings from one batch, to 
mould in with the next lot. When browned on both 
sides take out carefully and lay on brown paper 
to drain. While still hot sift over them powdered 
sugar. In frying, let one side become thoroughly 
done before turning. Doughnuts are not so good 
when turned more than once in the cooking. 



Recipes for Sandwiches 

Dried Beef Sandwiches 

Mixture 510 Calories 
14 lb. dried beef 2 tbsps. mayonnaise 

1 tbsp. cooking fat 

Freshen the beef a little by pouring hot water 
over it and then wringing the water out. Have the 
grease hot in a frying pan and fry the beef till 
it is crisp. Put through the food grinder and mix 
with the mayonnaise, adding more if necessary to 
make the filling spread nicely. This sandwich fill- 
ing is extremely good. It can be made without 
frying the beef first, but that little crisp fried 
taste pays for the extra trouble. The very thin 
bread cut for sandwiches does not average 100 c. 
per slice ; 60 c. would be more accurate. 



Economy Club Sandwiches 
525 Calories for Each Sandwich 
3 slices bread 3 strips bacon, broiled 

1 slice tomato 1 hard boiled egg 

2 crisp lettuce leaves Mayonnaise dressing 

Toast the bread and lay a slice on a hot plate. 
Butter it, place on it a lettuce leaf, spread with 
mayonnaise, and lay on the strips of bacon and 
half the sliced egg. Add the second slice of but- 
tered toast, and on that lay a lettuce leaf, spread 
with dressing, on that the tomato, with more dress- 
ing, and on that the other half of the egg. Top

with the third slice of toast, buttered. Quick, easy 
and satisfactory for unexpected evening suppers 
or lunches and almost as good as the real club 
sandwich, which, as of course everyone knows, has 
sliced cold chicken or turkey in place of the Qgg. 



Cold Bacon Sandwiches 
Mixture 300 Calories 

3 strips bacon 2 tbsps. mayonnaise 
^ small sour pickle 

Broil or bake the bacon very crisp and dry. 
Break it into small bits when it is cold and add, 
with the pickle, cut very fine, to the mayonnaise. 
Green olives, or bits of paprika or green pepper, 
are good instead of the pickle, or they may all be 
used together.

Slice the bread thin, and butter it rather lightly. 
Mix together thoroughly the cream cheese, cream, 
and the teaspoon of mayonnaise. Grind the nut 
meats fine, and chop the dates very fine. Stir into 
the cheese and spread on the bread, putting a slice 
of brown with a slice of white. Cut each sandwich 
in two diagonally. Best made with ** Grandma's

the breads.

Cartwheel Sandwiches 

200 Calories Each 

6 rounds white bread Butter 

6 rounds Boston brown bread Orange marmalade 

6 salted filberts 

Cut the white bread a little thicker than for an 
ordinary sandwich, and cut each slice round with 
a cooky cutter, saving the scraps for the bread 
crumb jar. Spread these rounds with butter and 
then with orange marmalade. It will be best to 
chop the sections of orange and grape fruit in the 
marmalade first, so it will spread on smoothly and 
look well, not jagged. Cut the Boston brown bread 
with a much smaller cooky cutter, place a round 
in the center of the spread white bread, and then 
force down into the middle of each bit of brown 
bread a nice round salted filbert, or hazel nut, as 
they are more generally called. 



Hot Cheese Sandwiches 

^^ 555 Calories Without Bread 

14 pt. milk 1 cup diced York state cheese 

1 heap. tsp. flour Salt and paprika 

1 tsp. butter 

Cream the flour and butter together and add 
gradually to the milk, then put in the cheese and 
salt and paprika to taste. Cook the mixture in a 
double boiler until it is thick. Turn out in a flat 
square pan and let it cool. When cold cut it in 
slices, lay each slice on buttered bread and put 
in the toaster and brown, or if you prefer it, in 
the oven to bake. Better than plain cheese sand- 
wiches.

Hot Bacon Sandwiches 

750 Calories 
6 strips bacon 6 slices bread 

Cut the bread rather thick. Cut each slice of 
bacon very thin, and cut it in two. Lay the bacon 
on the bread so that every slice of bread is about 
covered with the bacon, put on a flat pan and bake 
till the bacon is done. It is best to turn it over 
once so both sides will be brown. No butter is 
needed, but if you can stand the added richness 
a dab of mayonnaise on each sandwich is good. 



Pepper Hash Sandwiches 
Mixture About 80 Calories per Thsp. 

Just mix pepper hash and any one of the thick 
salad dressings together and spread on buttered 
bread. If the sandwiches are to be eaten at once, 
add a crisp little lettuce leaf to each sandwich. 
Lettuce sandwiches are good but they don't keep 
or pack very well. 



Mixed Olive Sandwiches 
Mixture About 90 Calories per Tbsp. 

Ripe olives Raw cabbage 

Stuffed olives Salad dressing 

Chop olives and cabbage together, very fine, but 
do not put through the food grinder, as it crushes 
them too much. Have about one-third cabbage. 
Mix to spreading consistency with salad dressing 
and put on bread. Or instead, mix with half salad 
dressing and half cream cheese, which is a very 
good sandwich filling, too. 



Marmalades and Pickles 

Peach Marmalade 

Fruit 475 Calories 
Sugar 840 Calories per Cup 

9 medium sized peaches Sugar 

1 large orange Water 

Put all the orange, except its seeds, through the 
food grinder, using pulp, rind and juice. Peel and 
stone the peaches, add the ground orange, mash 
all . together ; weigh the mass and add an equal 
amount of sugar. Cook the fruit first, however, 
with a little water. After adding the sugar stir 
constantly till desired thickness is attained. 



Orange Marmalade 
6250 Calories 
2 oranges Sugar 

2 lemons Water 

2 grapefruit 

First slice the fruit as thin as you possibly can. 
Save the seeds. After slicing the fruit, measure 
it carefully and add exactly as much water as you 
have fruit. Pour the water over the fruit, cover, 
and let it stand for forty-eight hours. (Oh, no, you 
can't make the marmalade for Sunday breakfast 
on Saturday afternoon!) After the forty-eight 
hours are over put the mixture on to boil, and 
boil for one hour. Boil the seeds up in water, 
strain them out and add the water in which they 

235 



236 The Calorie Cook Booh 

cooked to the fruit. The seeds contain the stuff 
called pectin, which is responsible for the jellying 
process, you see. After boiling let the marmalade 
stand over night again, and next day boil again, 
this time adding sugar — the same amount of sugar 
that you had fruit and water. Boil till the mixture 
is as thick as suits your individual fancy; then 
pour into jars and seal. It is well to remember to 
stir the fruit several times while it is standing, so 
that all the pieces will be sure to have an equal 
chance to soften in the water. 



Pepper Hash 
1510 Calories 

6 red peppers y2 cup vinegar 

6 green peppers iy2 cups sugar 

8 medium sized onions IV2 tbsp. salt 

Seed the peppers carefully — you must be care- 
ful to get sweet peppers — and peel the onions. 
Put them all through the food chopper, using a 
medium coarse knife. Place in a sauce pan and 
pour on enough scalding water to cover, letting it 
stand five minutes. Drain carefully, then pour 
over one-half cup of vinegar mixed with enough 
hot water so the peppers are again covered. Let 
stand another five minutes and drain well. Then 
pour over the remaining cup of vinegar, in which 
you have dissolved the sugar and salt. Add one 
cup of water. Bring to the boiling point ; boil ten 
minutes ; then seal in jars.

Sweet Watermelon Pickle 

Value Rind Very Small, Sweet Vmegar 6120 
Calories 

4 cups vinegar 4 tbsps. whole cloves 

8 cups sugar (half brown) 1 tbsp. whole allspice 

4 tbsps. stick cinnamon Rind 1 medium watermelon 

Cut the rind into strips about one and a half to 
two inches long; put it in a kettle, cover with 
water, throw in a large handful of salt, and allow 
to stand over night. Next day drain and wash. 
Soak two hours in alum water, allowing one tea- 
spoon of powdered alum for each quart of water. 

Drain and wash again. Cover with water and 
boil half an hour. Boil the sugar and vinegar to- 
gether ten minutes; add the spices, and simmer 
a quarter of an hour. Add the melon, and let 
the whole thing cook gently for an hour or more. 
Seal in jars while hot. 



Sweet Pickled Pears or Peaches 

Sweet Vinegar 6120 Calories. Pears (Small) 75

Prepare the syrup as for the watermelon 
pickle, only stick three cloves in each pear or 
peach, and add only cinnamon to the vinegar. Put 
the fruit at once into the syrup and cook until 
tender. Pears and peaches which are not very soft 
are best for pickling, and they should be rather 
small, too. Sometimes small apples, or crab ap- 
ples, are put up in this way and are very good 
indeed.

Spiced Tomatoes 

8500 Calories 

10 lbs. ripe tomatoes 2 tbsps. cloves 

1 qt. vinegar 2 tbsps. allspice 
4 lbs. sugar 1 tbsp. salt 

2 tbsps. cinnamon 

Scald the tomatoes and peel them. Add to them 
the sugar, vinegar and spices. Boil slowly until 
the mixture is thick, stirring very, very often. You 
can put in the spices ground. That is easiest, but 
a prettier color is obtained by getting them whole, 
tying them in a thin cloth and dropping that in, 
to be removed when the tomatoes are done. If 
one of the pounds of sugar is brown it will add a 
specially good taste. 



Pear Butter 

Buy sound pears — the hard winter pears are 
good for this use — ^wash them, remove the stem 
ends, quarter them, but do not peel or core them. 
Stew the fruit till it is very tender ; then force it 
through a fine sieve, till all that can be pushed 
through is a mass of pulp in the pan. Weigh or 
measure this pulp. Add an equal amount of sugar 
and put on to boil. In a little bag made of cheese- 
cloth tie up whole cloves, whole cinnamon and all- 
spice. Throw the bag into the butter. Boil slowly 
at least one hour. You must stir all the time or 
it will burn. If it does scorch a little you can kill 
the burned taste by adding lemon juice. A large 
pear has about 90c. ; sugar 840 c. per cup. Spices 
practically no value. 



Beverages 

Russian Tea 

Make in the usual way the sort of tea you usu- 
ally use. Pour it, hot, into a glass that holds a 
slice of orange, a slice of lemon, each stuck with 
a whole clove, and two candied cherries. Add 
what sugar you wish. 



Tea a la Julep 

This is to be served cold, not hot like the Eus- 
sian tea. Make the tea as usual, and pour while 
piping hot over some sprays of well washed fresh 
mint. Let it stand until cold, and serve with slices 
of lemon floating in it and sprays of fresh mint 
sticking out of the top of the pitcher. A glass 
pitcher is prettiest. You will have to regulate the 
quantity of mint used while the tea is hot, by the 
strength of flavor you like — and that you'll have 
to discover by trying. 



Russian Chocolate 

Make cocoa of ordinary regulation strength, and 
coifee, not too strong. Pour together while still 
hot ; add a teaspoon of cream for each glass to be 
served; sugar to taste, beat well together; chill, 
and serve in tall glasses with ice, each glass topped 
by whipped cream. Very good and also extremely 
filling — and fattening. Oh, yes — of course — ^I 
know all really good things are!

Fruit Nectar 

To the jnice of two lemons, one orange and one 
grapefruit, add one cup of red raspberry juice and 
one of juice from canned pineapple. Weaken and 
sweeten to suit your taste. Serve in a glass bowl 
or pitcher, with slices of orange, cut in halves, 
and a few red cherries floating on top. Sprigs of 
fresh green mint also add to the looks and the 
taste of this drink.
