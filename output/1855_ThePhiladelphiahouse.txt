PREFACE. 



As the health of a family depends more 
upon the quality of their food than upon any 
other cause whatever, it is a public benefac- 
tion to give good advice upon this subject. 
That this advice may be most widely benefi- 
cial, it should have reference to the material 
and the preparation of food; and in both 
these respects, regard should be had to eco- 
nomy. The rich, who are able to provide the 
most choice and expensive articles of diet, 
frequently fail in having them prepared for 
the table in an agreeable and healthful man- 
ner; and the poor, and even those in mode- 
rate circumstances, are not only not generally 
well informed as to healthful and nutritious 
articles of food, which may be purchased at 
moderate expense, but when procured, they 
more generally err in the healthful prepara- 
tion of them, mistaking high seasoning and 
rich mixtures for delicious and wholesome 
food. It is to aid the family in procuring 



IV PREFACE. 

and preparing their food according to their 
means, and with a view to elegance, taste, 
and health, that the authoress of this book 
has been induced to publish these receipts 
and the accompanying advice and reflections. 
She does this at the solicitation of many 
heads of families, and with the confidence of 
knowledge founded on long personal experi- 
ence. This is the only source of reliable 
knowledge on the subject of procuring and 
preparing healthful food, in good taste, and 
with elegance and economy. 

But proper materials may be obtained for 
food, and the cook may understand how to 
prepare them; yet she will fail if she does 
not have the kitchen furnished with proper 
articles for culinary purposes. Each of these 
articles should be kept in its proper place, 
and scrupulously clean, while every thing 
should be done with exactness, and at the 
proper time. 

The authoress has the greatest confidence 
that the circulation of this book will promote 
elegance and comfort in wealthy families, and 
economy and health in families of moderate 
means. 



THE 



FAMILY EECEIPT BOOK 



TO PKEPARE AND TO SELECT BEEF, MUTTON, 
LAMB, VEAL, AND BACON. 

White meats, such as veal, mutton, and lamb, 
should be washed as quickly as possible, or the juices 
of the meat will be extracted by the water. Fresh 
beef should never be washed, but well scraped with 
a clean knife twice over; any soiled parts which 
cannot be scraped must be cut off. If the bones 
are soiled, saw off the part with the meat saw. 
Salted meat should be well washed in three or four 
waters, and soaked at least fifteen minutes in cold 
water, before putting it down to boil. The pot 
should be filled with cold water, and boil slowly till 
done, according to the size of the meat, or allow a 
quarter of an hour for every pound of the meat; 
quick boiling will make the meat hard and insipid. 
Be careful that it does not stop boiling, or the meat 
will be injured; remove the scum frequently. Peo- 
ple are not generally aware of the injurious effects

from eating the flesh of diseased animals. It has 
been my practice to choose beef from the whiteness 
of the fat, and always object to it if a dark shade 
of yellow ; let the fat be clear and thick, and the 
beef smooth and close ; if otherwise, it is old. The 
flesh of a young ox should be a good red, and have 
a smooth and open grain, and feel tender. Pork 
may be judged by the thinness of the skin, and by 
pinching the lean ; if young, it will.break. When 
clammy, it is not fit for use. Fresh pork will be al- 
ways cool and smooth. The fat of mutton should 
be white and firm, and the lean a good colour. If 
the vein in the neck of lamb has a greenish cast, it 
is stale : it should be of a bluish hue. 

Bacon. — The lean should be of a good colour, 
and tender, and firm on the bone, the fat should be 
firm and of a red tinge, and the rind thin. Try a 
ham by putting a sharp knife in under the bone. If 
the smell is agreeable, the ham is good ; if otherwise, 
and the knife soiled, reject it. Veal, — The whitest 
is the most juicy, having been made so by frequent 
bleeding : the flesh of a bull calf is firmest, but of a 
darker colour. Old and diseased meat will shrink 
very much in cooking. Hams and tongues, if they 
are old and hard, should be put to soak in warm 
water the night before they are boiled. A large 
ham will take from four to six hours to boil, and a 
tongue will take nearly as long. They should be 
kept constantly boiling, and well skimmed: put 
them down in plenty of cold water. Fish should 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 11 

always be boiled in Lot water Avitli a little salt in it : 
let them boil slowly. 

Wild fowls do not require as much, cooking as 
tame. They should be done before a brisk fire, and 
be constantly basted. Wild ducks will cook suffi- 
ciently in a quarter of an hour; pheasants in 
twenty minutes. A large turkey will take from 
two liours and a half to three hours. Hen tur- 
keys are the best for boiling. The time will de- 
pend on the size : if a large one, it will take two 
hours and a half, and should be boiled in a cloth. 
All meats when roasting should be put some dis- 
tance from the fire, and brought gradually nearer ; 
the more they are turned and basted, the more juicy 
they will be. Vegetables should be freshly gathered ; 
they are mucli sweeter and more healthy, if cooked 
as soon as taken out of the ground. When potatoes 
are to be fried, throw them in water with plenty of 
ice in it after slicing. This will make them crisp. 

BEEF SOUP, THIN. 
Wash and scrape well a shin of beef, put it down 
early in the morning in plenty of cold water, with 
a piece of veal, and a small piece of lean tarn ; let 
it boil slowly one hour, and skim it well; then add

potatoes, four onions, and one turnip ; some horse- 
radish cut in small pieces ; season with black and 
cayenne pepper, and salt to your taste : about half 
an hour before it is done, put in a bunch of sweet

and a tablespoonful of mustard seed, a tablespoonful 
of cloves, the same of allspice, a little mace; boil 
the spices in the vinegar, and pour over the peppers, 
mixing all well together; put in bottles or jars, 
and cork it. 

CELERY VINEGAR. 

Bruise a pint of celery seed ; after putting it into 
your bottles, fill them with strong cider vinegar; 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 29 

set It away for a month, not forgetting to shake it 
every day : it will then be fit for use. 

GKAVY FOR EOAST TURKEY AND CHICKENS. 

Boil the liver and gizzard with a little salt; 
when done, chop them up fine ; mix with the water 
they were boiled in, some of the drippings in the 
bottom of the oven, a very little brown flour, then 
add the giblets : season to your taste. 

VEAL GRAVY. 
Take some of the drippings in the bottom of 
your oven, to which add some boiling water ; put it 
on to boil, season with pepper, salt, and a little brown 
sugar and flour ; send hot to table. 

VENISON SAUCE. 
Take equal quantities of claret and currant jelly, 
and some brown sugar ; put it down and let it stew 
till thick ; send hot to table ; this sauce is very good 
for venison or roast leg of mutton. 

APPLE DUMPLING SAUCE ANOTHER WAY. 

Beat loaf sugar and butter to a cream as light as 
possible, and stir slowly into it one wine glass of 
brandy. An excellent cold sauce for apple dumplings 
or fritters. 

APPLE SAUCE. 
Pare a quarter of a peck of ripe green pippins ; 
cut them in quarters and core them ; then put them 



30 FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 

in a pipkin or eartlion pitcher, with a little water 
to stew slowly ; shake the pipkin or pitcher fre- 
quently ; do not put a spoon in ; it might break them 
when nearly done : put in a little loaf sugar ; shake 
them several times ; when done, pour them into a dish 
without breaking : serve up cold or hot. 

CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

Wash and pick four quarts of cranberries ; put 
them in a bell-metal kettle with one quart of water 
to stew slowly : when half done, add two pounds of 
brown sugar : every berry must be broken with a 
spoon before it comes off the fire : stir frequently. 
Another way would be to add more sugar and strain 
it through a fine cullender, and set it away in forms 
to cool: this we would call cranberry jelly. 

TO STEW DRIED FRUIT. 

Dried fruit should be well washed in three or four 
different waters, and put to soak over night in the 
water in which you intend stewing them ; to four 
quarts of fruit, put water enough to cover them, 
so that none need be added while cooking : season 
and sweeten to your taste. Some persons like 
dried orange peel in peaches. 

TO ROAST BEEF. 

Scrape till clean the fat, the lean, and the bones 
of the beef. If any soil remain on the bones, saw 
it off with a beef saw. It can be more thoroughly 
cleaned in this way than in any other. It spoils 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 31 

beef to wash it. Spit it and put it in a tin kitclicn 
before the fire, with a half pint of water in the hot. 
torn of the kitchen ; do not set it close to the fire at 
first, but bring it gradually nearer ; turn, and baste 
it every few minutes. It should be cooked slowly. 
When nearly done, season with black and cayenne 
pepper and salt. The habit of dredging beef with 
flour is a very bad one. Flour is no improvement 
to beef. Ten pounds of beef will roast, before a 
good fire, in two hours. For the gravy, pour off 
the grease, add a little water, pepper and salt ; send 
to table in a gravy boat. This receipt will answer 
for any part of the beef that is fit to roast. Gar- 
nish with horse-radish, grated. All roasts should 
be well skewered to the spit. 

BEEF STEAKS. 

The sirloin is the best. Cut the steak half an 
inch thick ; put it on a gridiron over clear coals ; 
turn it very often ; when half done, put it on a dish 
and squeeze as much of the juice out as possible; 
put it back ; season with pepper and salt. When 
done, place it in the dish with the juice ; add a 
spoonful of water, and if you prefer, a small piece 
of butter : send to the table immediately. 

TO STEW BEEF. 
Cut all the meat from cold roast beef; put the

will improve it : let it stew till all of the vcgcta])lcs 
are done; then take out the bones, cut your meat 
in small pieces, rub a piece of butter in flour and 
stir in: put the meat in till it is hot through; then 
dish it. 

BEEF A LA MODE. 
Chop fine some parsley, thyme and onions ; add 
some grated bread, nutmeg, cloves, pepper and salt, 
•with the yolks of three eggs beaten ; take out the 
bone and fill the space with these ingredients well 
mixed ; make holes in the lean part and stuff it ; bind 
it firmly with tape ; put it into an iron pot, suffi- 
ciently large to hold it, cover it with water and let it 
stew slowly for three hours. Make a gravy of the 
liquor it was stewed in with a half pint of red wine 
and mushroom catsup ; rub a little butter in flour, 
and let it simmer five minutes ; then take it up. 

A BEISKET OF BEEF BAKED. 

Take a brisket, say ten pounds ; make a dressing 
of ham, parsley, oysters, seasoned with pounded 
cloves, pepper, salt and nutmeg, and the yolk of two 
eggs well beaten ; make holes in the beef and stuff 
it ; put it in a pan with a little water and half a 
pint of wine ; bake it three hours ; send hot to table. 
Garnish with sliced lemons. 

BEEF STEAK PIE. 
Stew some tender pieces of beef, cut it up in small 
pieces, season with pepper and salt; have some 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 83

of beef with some gravy ; put on a cover and bake. 

TO BOIL CORN BEEF. 
Wash it well, and soak it thirty or forty minutes ; 
put it down to boil in plenty of cold water : let it boil 
slowly, and skim often. 

A BEEFS HEART.

a few moments, then take out the ventricles ; put it 
down to boil ; when nearly done, take it up : make a 
dressing of small pieces of ham, pepper, salt, parsley, 
and some beef chopped fine ; make incisions with a 
knife ; stuff and bake it ; pour a pint of the water 
in which it was boiled in the pan for gravy, and 
thicken it with browned flour and butter. 

DIRECTIONS FOR COOKING THE DIFFERENT 
PARTS OF VEAL. 

The fore quarter, the rack, and breast, are best 
boiled. The fillet or leg is very good stuffed and 
baked. The loin should be roasted. The knuckle 
is proper for soup, also the neck and shoulder. 

TO ROAST A LOIN OF VEAL. 

Wash it well, and put it in a tin kitchen some dis- 
tance from the fire ; when it is hot through, place it 
nearer to the fire ; baste it well ; when nearly done,

First, boil till done ; then skin and trim it ; spread 
the yolk of egg over, then sprinkle with finely 
rolled cracker, and put in the oven for a few minutes ;

bear an egg ; pour over them, cover, and let them 
remain in pickle for five weeks, then hang them up 
with the hock down to preserve the juice. The 
shoulders will not require to be in pickle so long ; it 
is not necessary to put saltpetre on the middlings; 
the jowls will be ready to hang up in two weeks, 
shoulders and middlings in four: they should be 
smoked but three times a week till done ; if smoked 
too much, they will be hard. Before the weather 
gets warm, take them down and rub well with hickory 
ashes.

After the chines have been in pickle a week or 
ten days, boil them and let them freeze. They are 
considered a great delicacy.

Take the tender pieces of pork, lean and fat, one 
third fat and two thirds lean, season with salt and 
pepper, and those that are for immediate use are 
improved by putting in some sage finely pulverized,

44 FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 

sausage meat is put in to skins, laid for ten days in 
pickle, then hung up and smoked a little, they will

distance from the fire at first, but move them gra- 
dually closer : they will roast in an hour : baste them

stew them until done ; when cold cut them into small 
pieces ; season with pepper, salt, a grated nutmeg, 
and a little mushroom catsup ; stir them over the 
fire a few minutes ; then spread them on a dish to 
cool ; the croquettes must then be shaped ; rolled in 
egg and bread crumbs, and fried in lard. 

TO BOIL EGGS. 
Boiling eggs depends upon the person for whom 
you cook. Two minutes and a half will boil to suit 
most persons : if you want them very soft, two mi- 
mutes will answer. If hard, they will take ten mi- 
nutes.

stalk ; take off the outside leaves ; put it down to 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 55 

boil in hot water, with a little salt : a large one will 
take half an hour. Do not let it boil too much: 
eat with drawn butter. 

PARSNIPS.

and let them boil till tender, which will be from one 
to two hours : send to table with butter, pepper and 
salt, or fry them brown.

TO BOIL POTATOES. 
Have the water boiling. Put in the potatoes; 
let them boil till nearly done, then pour off the water 



56 FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 

and throAY in some salt ; uncover tlie saucepan and 
set them on the back part of the stove. If the po- 
tatoes are boiled fast, the skin will crack before they 
are done. For mashed potatoes, pare them before you 
boil them ; when done, mash them with a small piece 
of butter, a cup of cream, and a little salt. Another 
way to boil old potatoes is to pare them around the 
middle, before you boil them, and throw in a little 
salt. When potatoes are young, scrape and boil 
them ; when done, pour ofiF the water and dress them 
with a little cream, butter, pepper and salt. 

TO FRY POTATOES. 

Pare large potatoes; cut them lengthwise: cut 
them into four pieces, of about a quarter of an inch 
thick. Have some butter boiling hot into which put

Avith just enough water to cover them ; when nearly 
done, pour oflf the water, and add milk and a lump 
of butter rolled in flour, parsley and salt.

you wish them. Touch them over with the yolk of 
egg, and put them in an oven to brown. 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 67 

TO ROAST POTATOES. 

Large potatoes will roast in an hour. Do not 
put them too near the fire, or they will burn before 
they are cooked. Sweet potatoes, if they are large, 
will take an hour and a half to roast. 

TO FRY SWEET POTATOES. 

Parboil them, then peel ; cut them in slices, and 
fry in butter : send them hot to table. 

TO BOIL SWEET POTATOES. 

Have them as nearly of a size as possible. Put 
them in boiling water; as soon as they are done, 
(which will depend upon the size,) pour oflF the water ; 
then lay them on the back part of the stove, where 
they will dry, but not burn. Some persons par- 
boil them, cut them in two, and broil them over a 
gridiioa. 

SPINACH. 

Take great care in picking it ; wash it well, and 
put it in a steamer with a little salt. It will cook 
in twenty minutes. Have some toast on a dish ; 
put your spinach on the toast, and some poached 
eggs on the top. 

TO BOIL GREENS.

pork or bacon. Eat with hard-boiled eggs, and if 
cooked without the meat, have drawn butter or 
vinegar.

Lima beans will require about three quarters of 
an hour to boil. Put them on in cold water ; when 
done, drain them : season with pepper, salt and butter. 

STRING BEANS. 

String and cut them down the middle ; put them 
down in as little water as you can cook them in, 
without burning them : do not strain off the water, 
but let them cook till nearly all the water has eva- 
porated : season with butter, pepper and salt, and 
send to table. 

PEAS. 

Shell and wash the peas. Cook them just as the 
beans. This is the best way to cook peas and beans ; 
or you can boil them in the common way, and drain 
ofiP the water: season with butter, pepper and salt. 

ASPARAGUS. 
Scrape and wash the asparagus ; tie it up in bunch- 
es ; and put it on to boil in water in which there is 
some salt; it requires about fifteen minutes to boil it, 
and it must not remain in the water after it is done. 
Have some bread nicely toasted, on which place it, 
and pour over drawn butter. A better way is to 
cook it in just as^ little water as possible ; do not 
pour off the water, but let it evaporate as much as 
possible; then season with butter, pepper and salt, 
and send to table with the liquor around it. This 
is the German manner of cooking beans, peas, and 
asparagus. 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 59 

TO FRTCASEE CORN. 
Have young corn cut from the cob. Save the 
juice; put it down to stew with pepper, salt, and a 
little creain ; roll a lump of butter in flour, and stir 
in. If the corn is young, it will cook in twenty mi- 
nutes. Corn will boil in half an hour; put it in 
boiling water, and take it up as soon as done. 

TO KEEP CORN FOR WINTER. 
Get the corn when young. Boil it ten minutes ; 
a longer time would injure it ; cut it from the cob ; 
spread it on dishes, and put it in the oven after the 
bread comes out; be careful the oven is not too hot; 
if it is, the corn will be spoiled. If not dry enough, 
put it in the sun for a few days, stirring it frequently. 
When perfectly dry, tie it up in bags and keep it 
in a dry place. When you cook it, wash it well : 
put it down with a little water, butter, pepper and 
salt. It will require much longer to cook than it 
does in summer. 

HOMINY. 

Wash it well, and soak it over night in the water 
you intend to boil it in ; put it on early in the morn- 
ing with a few beans and a piece of salt pork. Let 
it boil slowly for three hours or more, if not soft. 

TO FRY HOMINY. 

After your hominy is boiled and cold, mash and 
season with pepper and salt; have some lard hot in 



60 FAMILY RECEIPT DOOK. 

a pan, into which put your hominy. Cover it for 
five minutes, then stir it well, and cover again, and 
let it fry a light brown. Fried hominy is very good 
for breakfast. 

TO FRY EGG PLANT. 
Pare and let them lie ten or fifteen minutes in 
salt and water, to take away the bitter taste ; wipe 
them perfectly dry; have ready cracker rolled fine, 
and seasoned with pepper and salt ; dip each piece 
in the yolk of an egg beaten, then in the rolled 
cracker, and fry in hot lard. 

TO STEW EGG PLANT. 
Cut in half with the skin on, then soak in vinegar 
to extract the bitter taste, say half an hour, then 
boil till quite tender ; scrape out the pulp and fill 
them with bread crumbs, butter, cayenne pepper and 
salt ; lay them open in your bake pan with a little 
water in the bottom, put them in the oven and baste 
them often so that they will not be dry ; rub a little 
flour and butter together for the gravy. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

Prepare as above, and mix with pepper, salt, but- 
ter, and bread crumbs; fry in sweet oil. 

TO STEW TOMATOES. 
Take oif the skins by pouring boiling water over 
them ; then stew them with butter, pepper and salt; 
put in a little soda to correct the acidity; pour in 



FAMILY RECEIPT ROOK. 61 

some cream, and stew for a few minutes longer. 
Some persons prefer them without cream, and then 
it is not necessary to use the soda. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

"Wash and boil your tomatoes whole ; then pass 
them through a hair sieve ; season with butter, pep- 
per and salt ; let them stew some twenty minutes, 
and serve. Or dress them with sugar and a little 
wine. 

TO BROIL TOMATOES. 
Wash some large ripe tomatoes: wipe them dry; 
put them on a gridiron over hot coals to broil ; when 
they are hot through, they are done ; send them hot 
to table: to be eaten with butter, pepper and salt. 

TO BAKE TOMATOES. 
Have some large ripe tomatoes ; wash and peel 
them; cut them up in a dish — have ready bread, 
butter, pepper and salt; put a layer of tomatoes, 
then the bread crumbs, butter, pepper and salt, and 
so on, till your dish is full; bake, and send them to 
table in the dish in which they were baked. 

ANOTHER WAY. 
Take some large tomatoes ; peel them, cut the top 
off, and take out some of the seeds ; have ready some 
mushrooms chopped fine to fill them ; season with 
butter, pepper and salt ; then put them in a pan, and 
bake them ; serve up hot. 

6* 



62 THE FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

Peel your tomatoes ; slice tliem and put down to 
stew ; season with some onions cut fine, bread crumbs, 
butter, pepper and salt; they will be sufiiciently 
done in twenty minutes. Some persons prefer a little 
flour rolled in butter. 

TO BOIL CORN. 

Take off carefully all the silk and all the husks. 
Put the corn in boiling water : if young and tender, 
it will boil in half an hour. Some persons serve it 
up in a napkin on the dish, but if it is sufficiently 
cooked, and can be served hot, it is better not to be 
steamed in a napkin. 

TOMATOES AND OCHRAS. 

Take some tomatoes; skin and cut them up with 
equal quantities of ochras ; season with pepper, salt 
and butter; stew them till tender; which will be 
nearly an hour. Ochras may be stewed alone, sea- 
soned with butter, pepper and salt : add very little 
water when you put them down. 

EGGS AND TOMATOES. 
Skin some tomatoes ; slice and fry them with butter, 
pepper and salt; cut up two onions, and put in with 
four eggs; stir all well together, and send hot to table. 

TO DRY OCHRAS FOR WINTER. 

Get the young ochras ; slice and string them ; hang 
them up to dry ; when di-y, put them away for soup 
in winter. 



FAMILY KECEIPT BOOK. 63 

CUCUMBERS. 
Gather them fresh. Pare, slice and lay them in 
salt and water; just hefore dinner, pour oS the 
"water; season with pepper, salt, vinegar and onions. 

SQUASHES. 
Squashes should he young and tender; try them 
with a fork ; if they are old, do not use them. Peel 
them and take out the seed ; cut them in pieces and 
hoil till tender; when done, pass them through a 
cullender. Stew with hutter, pepper, salt and a 
little cream ; send them hot to table. 

TO BOIL BEETS. 

The early turnip beet is best in summer : wash 
them, but do not cut the tops too close, as they are 
much sweeter with some of the tops boiled on them. 
They will boil in three quarters of an hour ; when 
done, take them up, put them in cold water for a 
moment, so that the skin will easily peel off. Slice 
them, and season with pepper, salt and butter. Old, 
or winter beets, will take much longer. They will 
take from two to three hours to boil. It is better 
to put them to soak over night, if they are very so- 
lid: cut them in slices, and pour vinegar over them. 

TO COOK OXIONS. 
The small white onions are preferred. Peel 
them, and put them down in a little water and salt ; 
when nearly done, pour off the water, and add milk 
and a little flour mixed with butter. 



G4 FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 

TO KEEP VEGETABLES FOR WINTER. 

Salsify, parsnips, beets, and carrots should be 
gathered in the early part of November. Those 
you want to use during the winter should be put in 
boxes, and covered with sand. Celery should be 
put in a box with the roots down, covered with sand. 
Some gardeners keep it in the ground all winter, 
and dig it as they wish it, for use. 

TO STEW MUSHROOMS. 
Wash and peel the mushrooms ; put them down 
in a stew pan with a little water, pepper, salt and 
butter; let them stew slowly for ten or fifteen mi- 
nutes ; then take them up. They are very good 
broiled. 

HOT OR COLD SLAW. 

The hard white cabbage is the best for slaw. 
Wash it well, and cut it fine ; have some butter 
boiling hot; put in the slaw and keep stirring till it 
is shrivelled : then beat up some vinegar and the 
yolk of an egg : season with pepper and salt ; pour 
this in the pan over the slaw, and stir in till quite 
hot : send to table either hot or cold, as preferred. 

COLD SLAW. 

Cut fine some hard cabbage ; dress with hard- 
boiled eggs, oil, vinegar, mustard, pepper and salt. 

TO BOIL CABBAGE. 

Wash your cabbage well ; cut it in two, and boil 
till tender in salt and water. Some persons prefer 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 65 

it boiled with a piece of pork or bacon. If it is 
boiled with bacon, the pot should be well skimmed 
before the cabbage goes in. 

BKOCOLI. 
Pick and wash it well ; tie it up in bunches and 
boil it; when done, drain it and serve it up with 
drawn butter. Put a little salt in the water when 
nearly boiled. 

SEA KALE. 

Sea kale is cooked in the same way as brocoli. 

BUTTEK. 

In winter the pans should be scalded before the 
milk is strained into them ; in summer the pans and 
strainer should be rinsed with cold water. Do not 
cover the milk until it is perfectly cold; a stone 
crock is the best for keeping the cream in, and it 
should be stirred two or three times a day; if the 
cream is not stirred, the butter will have a bad taste ; 
do not let your milk stand too long, or this will 
make the butter taste very unpleasant. Be particu- 
lar to put cold water in your churn the night before 
you wish to use it ; pour it out in the morning, and 
rinse it again ; before the butter comes, or while it is 
gathering, take off the lid of the churn ; have your 
butter-bowl scalded and cooled ; work the milk out 
well, but do not put in any water ; add salt to your 
taste. Everything connected with milk or butter 
should be kept very carefully clean. 



C6 FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 

TO KEEP BUTTER. 

Butter, to keep, should be well worked ; pack it 
in stone jars, and tie it up tight, and set it in a cool 
place. 

TO KEEP EGGS. 

Get eggs as fresh as possible ; put a layer of salt 
in a jar; then put in some eggs, the small end down, 
then another layer of salt, then the eggs; be care- 
ful not to let the eggs touch each other ; set them 
in a dry cool place, and they will keep all winter. 

TO MAKE COFFEE. 

Coffee should be roasted with great care, to a dark 
brown colour, stirring it all the time it is on the fire, 
with a long-handled iron spoon ; when it is done, put 
it in a stone jar, and cover it up. Freshly roasted 
coffee is much the best ; grind it into a bowl, beat it 
up with part of the white of an egg, and cold water ; 
put it into the tin coffee-pot, and pour on it boihng 
water, out of a tea-kettle, stirring it all the while ; 
set it on the fire, and let it boil fifteen minutes ; stir 
it frequently from the sides of the pot; when it is 
done, set it a moment on the hearth, and it will settle ; 
do not pour into it either cold or warm water, or 
coffee, to settle it: this spoils the coffee. Pour it 
into your silver or china coffee pot, and send to 
table. 

TO MAKE TEA. 

Black tea should be boiled fifteen or twenty mi- 
nutes. Green tea should not boil : but have boiling 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 67 

water poured on about five minutes before it comes 
to table. 

TO MAKE CHOCOLATE. 
Have a quart of good milk boiling ; grate a piece 
of chocolate three inches square ; mix it with a little 
cold milk ; then stir it gradually into the milk on 
the fire. If preferred thinner, use less chocolate. 
It should boil at least half an hour. 

YEAST. 
Pare six good-sized potatoes ; put them on to boil 
with three pints of water and a handful of hops ; 
pour the water through a sieve on a pint of flour ; stir 
it until perfectly smooth ; mash your potatoes through 
a cullender into the yeast; stir all well together, and 
let it stand till nearly cold ; then stir into it a pint 
bowl half full of dry yeast, dissolved in water ; put 
the water on the dry yeast as soon as you mix your 
flour and potatoes, and when it has sufficiently cooled, 
your yeast will be ready to go in. Set it in a warm 
place to rise. When it is light enough, keep it in 
a cool place; cover it close. Yeast should be made 
the day before you bake ; then it is good and fresh. 

TO MAKE DRY YEAST. 

Make as directed above. When perfectly light, 
stir in corn meal till it is quite dry ; spread it on 
dishes to dry. Be careful not to let it be in the sun, 
as this would sour it. When dry, put it in a bag, in 



68 FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 

a dry, cool place. In summer time, when the flies 
are numerous, spread a thin piece of gauze over to 
keep them off when it is drying. 

BREAD. 

Sift the flour ; put it in an earthen vessel ; the 
quantity of flour you take will depend upon the num- 
ber of loaves you want. Four loaves of bread will 
require two quarts of water; pour the water, which 
may be as warm as milk just from the cow, upon 
the flour, enough to make a thick batter ; put in two 
tablespoonsful of salt, and a pint of home-made yeast ; 
do not beat it after the yeast goes in. Set it in a 
warm place to rise; when it is light, work it very 
well with flour. The more you knead it, the better. 
If the flour is running, the bread will require to be 
made stiff'er than when it is superfine flour. Let it 
rise again, covering it, and set it in a warm place. 
When it is broken on top, make it into loaves, with 
as little flour as possible. Put each loaf into a 
basket: cover it over, and set it to rise again. 
When quite light, bake it in a brick oven, from three 
quarters to one hour. 

TO BAKE IN A BRICK OVEN. 
A brick oven will require one hour to heat. The 
wood should be split fine ; make a little fire at first, 
then add more wood ; when the oven is white at the 
top, it is sufficiently hot. Spread the coals over 
the bottom of the oven, and let them remain a quarter 
of an hour. 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 69 

Rusk or biscuit, if they are very light, will bake in 
from ten to fifteen minutes. Bread requires one hour. 

PHILADELPHIA BUNNS. 
One pound of flour, and a half pound of sugar, 
one pint of milk, with one teaspoonful of soda, a few 
currants, and half a pound of butter, a tea-cup full of 
yeast. Mix all well, and let it rise ; when well risen, 
put in six eggs, beaten separately : pour it in the pans, 
and let it rise again ; then bake. 

BREAD ROLLS. 
When your bread is very light, take a piece of 
dough, into which rub a small piece of butter ; make 
them into rolls a quarter of an inch thick : let them 
rise, and bake. 

DIET BREAD. 
f Rub into a pound of flour, one tablespoonful of 
butter, and a teaspoonful of salt : work it very well, 
or beat it ; roll very thin : stick with a fork, and 
bake. 

MUSH ROLLS. 
Have a pint of corn mush ; when a little warm, 
add a little salt and flour, enough to make a dough; 
add a tea-cup full of yeast ; let it rise, and when quite 
light, make into rolls ; let them rise again, and bake. 
You can put a little butter with them, if you prefer : 
but they are very palatable without.

70 FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 

RISEN MUFFINS. 
Warm a quart of milk, into which put a quarter 
pound of butter, enough flour to make a batter, two 
eggs, well beaten, and a cup of yeast, a little salt ; 
when quite light, bake in rings. Do not beat them 
after the yeast is in: they will be light enough in 
three hours. 

SODA CAKES, VERY SUPERIOR. 

Sift into three pints of flour, three teaspoonsful 
of cream of tartar; rub one quarter of a pound of 
butter in the flour ; dissolve one teaspoonful of soda 
in as much milk as will make a dough, thick enough 
to roll out; then take a large spoonful, sift flour on 
the board, roll out and bake : do not touch them with 
the hands. 

PHILADELPHIA MILK BISCUIT. 
Rub half a pound of butter in three pounds of 
flour, a teaspoonful of salt ; warm the milk and pour 
on enough to make a thick batter ; beat it well, then 
add a cup of good yeast. Do not beat it after the 
yeast goes in; let it rise; when quite light mix in 
flour, enough to make it out, but as little as possible : 
roll it out and cut into cakes with a small tumbler : 
let them rise again, and bake as soon as light. 

TWIST ROLLS. 
Twist rolls are made in the same way, only make 
in small twists or rings, and bake. 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 71

REMARKS ON MAKING INDIAN BREAD. 
It is better in making Indian bread to pour the 
liquid, either water or milk, boiling hot on the In- 
dian meal. Indian takes more salt than wheat. 

TO MAKE MUSH.

corn meal to make it thick. Salt it to your taste: 
let it boil one hour. When it is cold, slice it and 
fry it a light brown: send to table hot. 

CORN BATTER CAKES. 
Pour boiling milk on meal, enough to make a batter ; 
add a little salt and two eggs. The eggs will pre- 
vent them breaking when they are turned : send hot 
to table. If this batter is made thick and baked in 
a pan, it is called pone. 

JOURNEY CAKE. ' 

Mix well some corn meal with water, and a little 
salt. Have ready the middle board of a flour bar- 
rel-head ; wet the board, upon which put the dough 
with a large spoon ; smooth it over ; bake before the 
fire ; when baked brown, turn the other side. Send 
hot to table. 

LIGHTENED PONE. 

Pour either milk or water boiling hot on a pint of 
corn meal ; add salt, and, when it is cool, some yeast 
and two eggs ; when it is light, it will open at top : 
bake in pans an inch thick.

TO MAKE PUFF PASTE. 
Take one pound and a half of flour ; sift half of it 
into a tin pan. The remainder keep for rolling out 
the paste ; take a pound of butter which has been 
washed and well worked the night before, and kept 
in a cold place. Cut up half of it with two knives 
into the flour, then mix it with a tumbler of ice 
water. Then roll it out very thin, and spread on 
it in small thin pieces a quarter of a pound of butter, 
and sift flour over it. Cut it in strips, about four 
inches wide, and six long ; lay one upon another till 
they are all on ; then roll again, and put the remain- 
ing quarter of butter on as before; roll and cut it 
in strips, and those strips in squares, and lay one upon 
another. When you make the pie do not take one of 
the strips, but cut it down, so as to have as many 
layers as possible in each pie. Always use the 
knives: never touch the paste with the hand.

and a quarter of flour ; sift half a pound of the flour 
into a tin pan, (such a pan as should be always kept 
for making pastry,) keep the rest of the flour in the 
sieve. Cut up in the pan with the half pound of 
flour, a quarter of a pound of butter with two knives. 
(The hands should never touch the pastry.) Then 
pour slowly into the pan half a pint of ice water; 
mixing it with the knives. Sift some of the flour 
on your board, and roll it out very thin, with a 
floured rolling pin ; suiBBcient flour must be used to 
prevent it sticking to the board; put over the 
paste in small pieces as regularly as possible, one 
quarter of butter ; then sift flour over and cut it in 
strips about three inches wide; then cut across as 
many times, placing one piece upon another till it 
makes quite a high mound. Flour it and roll it out 
again as thin as possible. Then put on in very 
small pieces the third quarter of butter, and proceed 
as above, with the last quarter ; roll out very thin, 
cutting it as before. The flour is now all rolled in 
except half of a pound, reserved for rolling out the 
paste when making up. It should be made in a cold 
place, and near an open window. When you make

hair sieve ; press all the juice out ; allow a pound of

properly done and put up in this way will be as 
good at the end of three years as the fii'st. Glass 
tumblers are excellent for putting up jelly and pre- 
serves. Prune plums, egg plums, and the common 
blue plums may all be done in the same way.

next day repeat the process; then put them in the 
oven, after the bread comes out, on a flat dish ; do 
this till they are dry; pack them in jars, sprinkling

in the soup, stirring it well : season it to your taste : 
add eggs, balls fried, and a pint of wine. Serve it 
up hot. 

TURTLE SOUP. 

In most of the markets the turtle can be bousht 
cleaned and ready for cooking. If not, place it on 
its back to make it extend itself. Then cut off its 
head and fins; let it bleed freely; when quite dead, 
cut the belly part clean off, take out the gall and 
the sand bag. Draw and wash the entrails well. 
Scald the black meat, so that the skin will come off, 
which must be done very carefully. Cut the meat 
in joints like a chicken, then put it down with five 
quarts of water. Let it boil till soft, (which will de-

pend upon the turtle ; if it is old, it will take a long 
time.) Make forcemeat balls of one pound and a half 
of veal, chopped fine, with parsley, thyme, pepper, 
salt, and two eggs and flour to thicken ; fry them in 
butter and lard ; put half a pound of butter in the 
pan, and when hot, stir in enough flour to thicken 
it. Put these all in the soup, and season with pep- 
per, cayenne and black, with salt to your taste ; let 
it simmer, till the flour is well cooked : put in just as 
you dish it up, one quart of Madeira wine. This 
is very superior. 

EGG SOUP. 

Boil a small piece of beef or the scrag end of the 
neck of veal : season it with pepper and salt, and 
let it boil very gently till the meat is well cooked. 
Then strain it. Beat the yolks of two eggs well, 
with some chopped parsley, and pour the soup in the 
tureen on the eggs. Keep stirring it all the time. 
A little rice will improve this soup very much: 
put the soup in the boiler again, after it is strained, 
and cook till done. 

CLAM SOUP. 
Take two quarts of clams. After they are opened, 
cut ofi" the beards and put them down to cook, with 
equal quantities of the water and the liquor. Take 
four crackers pounded fine and rolled in butter ; stir 
in very gently: season with pepper, salt, chopped 
parsley, a little mace, and add a pint of sweet cream, 
just before you take it up. 



130 FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 

OYSTER SOUP. 

Oyster soup is made as clam soup, only omitting 
parsley and substituting a little mace. 

SOUP FOR THE SICK. 
In a pint of boiling water put half a wine-glass full 
of wine; beat up the yolk of one egg; when the 
water and wine boils, pour it out into a bowl ; then 
on the egg; continue to pour it from one bowl to 
another, two or three times ; then add a small piece 
of butter, a little sugar and nutmeg. 

TERRAPINS. 

Take the terrapins one at a time, and immerse 
them in boiling water for half a minute ; take them 
out and remove the skin ; put them back into hot 
water, and watch them carefully that they do not 
boil too much; (some will be done in half an 
hour, others will take much longer. They are suf- 
ficiently done when the feet are soft to the touch.) 
Take off the shell and remove the sand bag and the 
gall, (which will be found in the liver; the sand 
bag is full of water ;) then put them down to stew 
with one pound of best butter to three good-sized 
terrapins : season with red and a little black pep- 
per; (no salt;) when they are perfectly heated 
through, put in the following dressing, and when it 
boils furnish the seasoning with a little salt, &c., if 
required. Dressing, — Take three yolks of hard- 
boiled eggs, to one large terrapin ; mash them up 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 137 

fine, and add the best Madeira, a little at a time, 
until you make a thin paste; stir this into the ter- 
rapins, and add more wine, if necessary. There 
should be just dressing enough to float near to the 
top of your terrapin in the saucepan. 

ROMAN PUNCH. 

One gallon of water, one quart of cream, the 
juice of a dozen lemons, one pint of the best brandy, 
and a pint of rum ; sugar to the taste ; to be frozen 
before the cream goes in. The cream stirred in and 
frozen again. 

APPLE TODDY. 
One bushel of apples baked on white paper, and 
strained next day through a sieve, three gallons of 
water, one gallon of brandy, three quarts of Jamai- 
ca spirits; sweeten to your taste. 

TO MAKE A VEAL POT-PIE. 

Half boil some veal ; then cut it in small pieces ; 
season it with cayenne pepper, salt, nutmeg, parsley 
and a little butter: make a good paste; line the 
sides of a deep dish ; put in the meat, and add some 
cream ; have a small cup in the middle of the pie ; 
cut across the centre, and turn back the sides to 
let the steam escape : bake slowly. 

GUINEA FOWL. 

They are very good cooked as pheasants or 
stewed like chickens. 



138 FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 

SUCCOTASH. 
Boil some string beans in as little water as thSy" 
can be cooked in, with salt; when nearly done, have 
some corn cut from the ears put in, and season 
with pepper, salt, butter and a little cream ; twenty 
minutes will be long enough for the corn to cook ; 
but the beans will require an hour and a half. In 
winter, succotash can be made with dried corn and 
beans ; let them both soak all night in the water you 
boil them in, after washing them well. 

POTTED SHAD. 

Take fine large shad, and when they are tho- 
roughly cleaned and washed, split them in two and 
cut them in square pieces. Place a layer of fish 
in a stone crock; (a glazed one will not answer;) 
sprinkle over it salt, cloves, whole pepper and mace ; 
thus continue till your crock is filled ; pour over it 
the best pure cider vinegar ; cover the mouth of the 
crock with a bladder, which should be tied down suf- 
ficiently tight, to prevent the steam from escaping ; 
place it in a moderately warm oven, and let it bake 
for several hours. It is a good plan to send it to 
a bake-house, and let it be put in a brick oven,, 
after the bread is taken out. If properly done, the 
bones will all be dissolved, and it will be almost equal 
to salmon. 

TO MAKE STOCK FOR SOUPS AND GRAVY. 
To one shin of beef and one of veal, add eight 
quarts of water, and salt to the taste ; skim it well, 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 139 

and let it boil till it is quite thick : take out all the 
meat, and pour off the stock ; set it away till next 
day : you can add some of this to your soup, and it 
will improve it very much. Geese, ducks, and 
chickens are very good stewed in stock made after 
the above receipt, and then browned in an oven. 

TO STEW SWEET-BREADS. 

Parboil them ; then cut in small pieces ; season 
with pepper, salt, and nutmeg; put them down to 
stew in some veal gravy, and just before you take 
them up, add some mushroom catsup and a glass of 
wine. 

TO KOAST SWEET-BREADS. 
Half boil them ; then take them up ; lard them 
with ham, and roast before the fire: season with 
cayenne pepper, salt and mushroom catsup. 

TO HASH MUTTON. 

Cut in small pieces ; have two onions fried brown ; 
put it down in a little good gravy; just before you 
dish it, season with pepper, salt, a little currant 
jelly and wine, or a spoonful of walnut pickle. 

SUGAR DROPS. 
Beat to a cream a quarter of a pound of butter 
and half a pound of sugar, rose water to the taste, 
half a pound of flour; stir all well together, and 
drop them on buttered paper, and bake : ornament 
with sugar plums.

half a pint of cream, mace, cinnamon, sugar, and 
nutmeg, to the taste ; add a little brandy ; bake in

pounds of sugar, the whites of five eggs, one pint of 
wine, and six tablespoonsful of brandy, and six 
lemons, peel and juice. The gelatine must be soaked 
in one quart of water for half an hour ; stir all the

are an excellent application. 



144 FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 

ELDEE-BEREY JAM. 

Put two quarts of eldcr-bcrriea in a kettle, with 
some water, say a pint ; stir and mash them well ; 
when the juice is all extracted, strain it, and add 
two pounds of the best loaf sugar; let this simmer 
twenty minutes. This is good for colds, and soro 
throat, and is a great purifier of the blood. 

BLACK CURRANT JELLY. 

Mash your currants well, and strain them through 
a sieve ; to one pint of juice, put one pound of loaf 
sugar; boil twenty minutes. Quince jelly is also 
very good for the throat. The seeds should always 
be kept, as they are very good for sore mouth or 
throat. 

TO PRESERVE ORANGE PEEL. 

Take out all the inside ; then let them soak in salt 
and water twenty-four hours ; take them out ; wash 
them well, and let them boil for ten minutes ; throw 
off the water ; make a rich syrup ; after boiling the 
peel till they are tender, put them in the syrup ; let 
them boil for ten minutes ; and when the syrup is 
thick, pour it over the peel. 

SCOTCH CAKE. 

Beat to a cream one pound of sugar, and three 

quarters of a pound of butter ; beat separately nine 

eggs; put them into the cake; add the juice and

it is put in the pans, a pound of seeded raisins. 

HARD GINGER BREAD. 

One quart of molasses, one pound of brown sugar,

six eggs, one teaspoonful of soda, one cup full of sour

Articles oi Bid for ti)t ^icfe* 

Here we may observe that neatness in serving 
up, as well as care and cleanliness in the prepara- 
tion, makes food for the sick room more likely to 
be attractive to the fastidious appetite of the in- 
valid. 

BARLEY WATER. 

Wash well a tea-cup full of pearl barley ; put it 

in a sauce pan, with two quarts of water, and a small 

cup full of raisins ; boil it to a quart ; then strain, 

and add sugar, nutmeg, and lemon juice, to your 

taste. 

OATMEAL GRUEL. 

Mix smoothly a dessert spoonful of meal, with 

two of cold water; pour on a pint of boiling water, 

and let it boil for fifteen minutes, stirring all the 

time ; sugar or salt may be added as preferred. Wine 

is sometimes used. 

CORN MEAL GRUEL. 
Wash several times in cold water, three table- 
spoonsful of corn meal ; pouring ofi" the water as it 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 147 

settles; then ponr on a quart of water, and boil, 
stirring all the time ; add a little salt ; strain and 
sweeten, adding butter, wine, and nutmeg. 

ARROW ROOT. 
Mix a dessert spoonful of arrow root smoothly, 
in a little cold water ; pour on it a pint of boiling 
water; let it boil five minutes; then sweeten to your 
taste, and add nutmeg and wine. If richer food is 
required, this can be made in the same way, with 
milk instead of water. 

WINE WHEY. 
To half a pint of boiling milk, add one glass full of 
sherry wine, and a little sugar ; let it boil until the 
curd has separated, and strain through a fine sieve. 

RICE GRUEL. 

Stir into a pint of boiling water, a tablespoonful 
of rice flour, which has been mixed with a little 
water; let it boil fifteen minutes, stirring all the 
time ; then season with sugar and nutmeg, or a little 
cream. 

TAMARIND WATER. 

Upon a gill of good tamarinds, pour a pint of 
boiling water; cover it, and let it stand until cold, 
with a lump of ice : it is very grateful to a feverish 
person. Both currant and quince jelly make pleasant 
drinks, prepared in the same way. 



148 FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 

CREAM OF TARTAR PUNCH. 

Pour on a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, a tumbler 
full of boiling water; sweeten to your taste, with 
loaf sugar, and drink as hot as possible, upon get- 
ting into bed; a teaspoonful of nitre in it is excel- 
lent for a fever, qr a cold. 

LEMONADE. 

Squeeze and strain the juice of six lemons into 
three pints of ice water ; sweeten to your taste : by 
adding a gill of good French brandy, it will be 
lemon punch. Some persons prefer it made with 
boiling water, and then cooled with ice. 

VEGETABLE SOUP. 

Slice one potato, one turnip, one onion, one car- 
rot, and a little celery ; boil in a quart of water one 
hour ; toast some bread nicely ; cut in small pieces, 
and lay in a bowl: add salt to the soup, and pour 
over the toast. 

TOAST WATER. 

Let the water be boiled and cooled ; then toast 
bread of a deep brown, and pour over it the water ; 
let it stand half an hour. A small piece of dried 
lemon or orange peel gives it a pleasant taste. 

SAGO. 

Sago should be well washed; put a tablespoonful 
in a pint of milk, and boil it until it is quite soft; 
sweeten to the taste, and add wine or lemon juice. 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 149 

Tapioca is made in the same way, but does not re- 
quire so much washing. 

CARRAGEEN MOSS. 

Pour upon one ounce of carrageen (after it has 
been well washed) one quart of warm water; cover 
it, and let it stand on top of a stove all night : it 
will form a tasteless jelly, which when sweetened 
and seasoned with lemon, is palatable and strength- 
ening. 

CRACKER JELLY. 
Take a quarter of a pound of crackers ; pour on 
them two quarts of water ; boil down to one quart ; 
strain it : add one pound of sugar, one pint of Ma- 
deira wine, and a little nutmeg.

pieces ; put into a bottle with a little salt, and a 

tablespoonful of water : place the bottle in a pan of 

hot water, and let it boil three quarters of an hour. 

BEEF JEA. 

Cut up into small pieces a pound of juicy beef; 
cover it with a quart of water, and let it stand for 
two hours : then boil it until it is reduced to a pint ;

drink it while warm. 



150 FAMILY RECEirT BOOK.

Pour upon a tea-cup full of the leaves of dried 
balm, a pint of boiling water; let it stand fifteen 
minutes, when it is ready for use. 

CHICKEN TEA.

chicken ; put it in a stew pan, with a pint of water 
and a little salt; cover it, and let it boil twenty mi- 
nutes ; then skim and strain it. 

MILK TOAST. 

Cut a thin slice from a loaf of stale baker's bread ; 
toast it a light brown. Boil half a pint of milk, 
and a small piece of butter ten minutes ; then sprin- 
kle in a little salt, and pour over the toast. Cream 
toast is made in the same way. 

TO KEEP FLOWERS FOPt A LONG TIME. 

To one quart of water, add one tcaspoonful of 
carbonate of soda : do not change the water. 

TO KEEP FURS FROM MOTHS. 

Get the gum camphor; as soon as you can do 
without the furs, beat them, and put small pieces 
of camphor rolled in paper, in, and around them; 
sew them up tightly in linen, and keep in a cool 
place. Black pepper will not prevent the moths 
getting in, nor will it kill them. 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 151 

TO WASH FLANNELS. 

Wash tliem in clean suds as hot as you can bear 
the hands in ; then in water of the same tempera- 
ture, with a little soap in, but not so much as the 
first ; rinse in hot water, and hang up immediately. 

TO WASH WINDOWS. 

Never put soap on the windows, but wash them 
off with a shammy, and then dry them with the 
same ; if the shammy cannot be obtained, paper will 
answer, but it is not so good. 

TO WASH BOTTLES BELONGING TO THE 
CASTOR. 

^ Wash them well with water, with a little soap 
and soda in it, also some clean coarse sand or rice 
to get the marks out. 

TO WASH CALICOES. 

' Wash out the grease spots before putting the 
dress in, as the spots cannot be seen after it is wet ; 
wash them well through two suds ; then rinse them, 
throwing a little salt in the water to set the colours ; 
starch and hang them in the shade, as the sun will 
fade them. If the calico is black, make the starch 
water as blue as possible. Wash, and hang up 
quickly. 

TO GATHER GARDEN HERBS. 

Herbs should be gathered on a dry day, just be- 
fore they blossom. Wash them and hang them in 



152 FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 

a dry place ; as soon as they are dry, put them in a 
paper bag. Sage, sweet marjoram, summer savoury, 
and thyme should be pounded fine, and kept in bot- 
tles corked tight. When parsley is dry, cut it fine, 
and keep in bottles. 

FOK A COUGH. 

Make a strong tea of hoarhound ; then strain it, 
and add half a pound of the best loaf sugar, to a 
pint of the tea : let it simmer till thick ; then bottle 
it, and take a little two or three times a day. 

FOR A SORE THROAT OR MOUTH. 

Make a sage tea by boiling some sage leaves; 
when strong, add honey and some alum or borax. 
Gargle the throat with this often through the day. 

FOR THE STING OF A BEE OR WASP. 

Rub the part with hot tallow, or with hartshorn, 
or wet clay. 

FOR POISON. 

Mix in a tumbler full of warm water one teaspoon- 
ful of the flour of mustard ; drink while warm : it will 
make the patient throw off the poison. This is good 
for the cramp. 

FOR BURXS. 
When the skin is not off, apply scraped raw po- 
tatoes. When the skin is off, apply sweet oil and 
cotton, or linseed oil and lime water made into a 
paste. Elder ointment is very good: make the 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 153 

ointment of the green bark of the elder ; stew in 
lard. 

Linseed oil andjime water mixed in a paste, is 
also an excellent cure. 

TO PICK DUCKS AND GEESE. 
Dip them in boiling water ; then wrap them for a 
few moments in flannel, and pick them, holding 
them by the feet, with the head down ; be careful 
to dry the feathers as soon as possible. A very 
good way to cure feathers is to put them several 
times in a brick oven after the bread comes out: 
then let them lie on the ground for several days, 
bringing them in at night. This will take away all 
the disagreeable smell which is so unpleasant in 
feathers when they are not properly dried. 

TO TAKE INK STAINS OUT OF LINEN. 

Rub the stain with lemon juice and salt, or a 
little hot tallow; when the lemon juice and salt are 
used, it must go in the sun for several hours ; then 
rinse it: new milk boiling hot will take out most 
kinds of fruit stains; dip in them when dry, and 
repeat it often. 

TO CLEAN CARPETS. 
Shake them well; then spread them on a clean 
floor, and rub them with a soft brush dipped in cam- 
phine, or with a piece of cloth : when they are dry, 
if the grease is not out, repeat the operation.

154 FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 

TO TAKE GREASE SPOTS OUT OF SILK OR 

WOOLLEN. 

Rub the spots with a sponge dipped in camphine ; 

rub, or if the article soiled be silk, spread magnesia 

on the wrong side ; let it remain for a day or two ; 

then brush it ofi', and the spot will have disappeared. 

TO CLEAN KNIVES AND FORKS. 

The iron filings from the blacksmith shop are ex- 
cellent to clean knives and forks mih. Rotten 
stone or fine brick dust is also very good. Do not 
put the handles in hot water, as this injures them; 
wipe them dry, and keep them rolled in brown 
paper. 

TO CLEAN BRASS AND COPPER UTENSILS. 

All brass and copper utensils should be well 
cleaned before using them, with hot vinegar and 
salt, then washed in hot water'; keep the vessel warm 
till ready for use ; when done with it, clean it well, 
and keej) in a dry place. 

TO CLEAN BRITANNIA. 

Rub them well with sweet oil and whitening ; 
when dry, rub them oiF with buckskin. If they are 
well washed in hot soap suds, and rinsed in clean 
hot water every day, and let dry quickly near the 
fire or in the sun, they will seldom require rubbing. 

TO CLEAN STOVES. 
Mix some British lustre with alum water; put it 
on with a brush, and with a dry brush rub it off. 



FAMILY RECEIPT BOOK. 155 

TO PRESERVE CORN FOR WINTER USE. 

Take oiF all the outside husks ; fasten the inside 
ones down tight, and pack in barrels or boxes with 
salt in alternate layers ; keep in a cool place, or the 
corn will heat and spoil. 

TO PRESERVE GRAPES. 

Gather the bunches on a dry day ; be' careful 
that the grapes are all sound; pack them in saw- 
dust or cotton : put them in a box; fasten it up, and 
keep in a dry place.
