SOUPS 

GUMBO FILft 

Let me tell you what file is: A powder 
made by drying sassafras and bay leaves, 
then grinding to a powder. 

One large chicken, or two pounds of bris- 
ket, one tablespoonful of lard (kitchen 
spoon), two tablespoonfuls of flour, sifted, 
one onion chopped fine, also some parsley 
and thyme chopped fine, two quarts of oyster 
liquor, heated, two quarts of boiling water, 
salt and pepper to taste; one can of tomatoes 
(pint) , one hundred oysters. Cut up chicken 
as for frying, put lard in kettle, which has 
become hot. When lard is melted and hot 
add flour and cook till brown, stirring con- 
stantly to keep from burning. Then brown 
the chopped onion in this flour and lard. 



2 SOUTHERN RECIPES 

Now put in your meat, and stir it for twenty 
minutes. In this roux add water gradually, 
and when all is added, put in the pint can of 
tomatoes, also parsley and thyme; set the 
kettle back on the stove to cook slowly for 
three hours. A half hour before serving 
put in your oysters, let them cook only half 
an hour, then take kettle off the fire, and put 
two tablespoonfuls of file in, stirring all the 
time. This thickens gumbo. Pour at once 
into hot tureen and serve. This should be 
served with boiled rice. 

SPINACH SOUP 

Half a peck of spinach, one quart of 
stock, one pint of milk, half a pint of cream, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter and three of 
flour, one teaspoonful of sugar; salt, and pep- 
per to taste. Wash spinach, simmer half an 
hour in covered stewpan, without water, 
chop fine, pound to a paste; put butter and 
flour in stewpan, stir until smooth and frothy, 
then add spinach, sugar, salt and pepper and 
stir ten minutes; gradually add stock, and 
when the mixture begins to boil add hot milk 



SOUPS 3 

and cream, boil up once, rub through a fine 
sieve, return to fire. Serve when hot. A 
little onion improves it. 

WHITE POTATO SOUP 

One quart milk, six large potatoes, one 
stalk celery, one onion, and one tablespoon- 
ful of butter. Put milk to boil with onion 
and celery. Pare potatoes and boil thirty 
minutes, mash fine and light, add boiling milk 
and butter, salt and pepper, to taste. Rub 
through a strainer and serve immediately. 
One tablespoonful whipped cream added im- 
proves it. 

BLACK BEAN" SOUP 

Beef, chicken (any bones except duck), 
put with them one quart of black beans into 
cold water, one tablespoonful of cloves 
(whole), three-fourths of a tablespoonful of 
allspice, (no vegetables). Cook all day, 
stirring occasionally, so the beans will not 
burn; strain, add good glass of wine, hard 
boiled egg, and slice lemon. Pepper and 
salt. 



4 SOUTHERN RECIPES 

OKRA GUMBO 

Make roux of lard, flour and onion, as for 
gumbo file, also cook chicken in this, then add 
two quarts of okra cut up fine. Cover pot 
and let it simmer a little while, then pour in 
about two quarts of boiling water if needed. 
Season with salt and pepper to taste. Fresh 
corn is very good in this. Serve with rice. 

CRAB SOUP 

A heaping dessertspoonful of flour, a 
heaping tablespoonful butter, one quart of 
milk, season with salt, pepper, spices, and a 
wineglass of sherry. Put flour and butter in 
one pot; milk with spices (tied up in cloth) 
in another pot; when the milk boils, add it 
slowly to the flour and butter, then add crab 
meat, and sherry when you pour into tureen. 

GOPHER SOUP 

Gopher is a dry land turtle. 

Make roux of flour and lard and onion, 
then put in gopher, cook a few minutes in 
roux, then pour in two quarts of boiling 



SOUPS 5 

water, a can of tomatoes, salt and pepper to 
taste. Tie in a thin piece of cloth some 
whole spice and cloves, put this in, cook all 
slowly for two hours, then put in a tumbler 
of claret, and a lemon sliced, as you remove 
soup from fire. 



FISH 

TURBOT 2 LA CR&ME 

Boil your fish (red snapper if turbot can- 
not be had) in strong salt water, remove 
bones and flake it in as large pieces as possi- 
ble. Boil one quart of sweet cream, into 
which put a small onion (whole), a bunch 
of parsley; then add three tablespoonfuls of 
flour, smoothly mixed in a little milk, stir 
until cream begins to thicken and is smooth. 
(It will take about five or eight minutes.) 
Remove onion and parsley and pour into the 
mixture quarter of a pound of melted butter. 
Butter a deep baking dish ; put in first a layer 
of fish, then a layer of grated cheese (stale 
Edam is very fine), then a layer of cream 
mixture, and so on until dish is filled; sift 
over the top a layer of stale grated bread 
crumbs or cracker crumbs and cheese. Bake 
from three-quarters of an hour to one hour

FISH 7 

according to oven; must not get too dry; gar- 
nish with parsley and serve with the follow- 
ing sauce: 

SAUCE 

Put in saucepan the yolks of four eggs, 
two dessertspoonfuls of vinegar and a pinch 
of salt; whip the mixture well and when it 
forms a sort of cream add four dessert- 
spoonfuls of olive oil, small teaspoonful of 
mixed mustard, a pinch of finely minced 
parsley, a little cayenne pepper and a lemon 
which has been very delicately sliced. Let 
this mixture come to a boil, and when it has 
boiled two minutes remove from the fire and 
serve hot with the fish. If sauce should get 
too stiff, it can be thinned by adding a little 
vinegar. 

COURTBOUILLON 

Three pounds of red snapper or red fish, 
one tablespoonful of lard, two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour, one large onion, six fresh to- 
matoes or a pint of canned tomatoes, four 
sprigs of parsley, one clove of garlic, six or 



8 SOUTHERN RECIPES 

eight large fresh potatoes sliced thin, table- 
spoonful of allspice well mashed, juice of 
one lemon, a tumbler of claret; salt and cay- 
enne pepper to taste; one quart of water. 
Cut the fish as for frying, put lard in deep 
kettle, and when hot add gradually the flour, 
constantly stirring to prevent burning. 
Then put in onion and garlic (which has 
been chopped fine), also parsley chopped, 
mashed allspice. Add the tomatoes chopped 
fine, also the potatoes, sliced thin, the glass 
of claret and the quart of water; let it boil 
well, and then add the salt and cayenne pep- 
per to taste and when it has boiled five or 
ten minutes, add the fish, putting in one piece 
at a time; add the juice of a lemon, and let 
all boil fifteen minutes. 

FISH SAUCE 

The fish may be either broiled or boiled, 
the latter is best if red snapper is used. 

Ingredients: Tomatoes, garlic, Worces- 
ter sauce, beef extract, black pepper, salt. 

The tomatoes are stewed with a small 
piece of garlic in them for about two hours, 



FISH 9 

and then strained through a cloth, and re- 
turned to the pot to be thickened with corn 
starch to a proper consistency. The Wor- 
cester sauce, beef extract, pepper and salt 
must be put into the tomatoes after being 
strained; half a teacup of beef extract, of 
course diluted, using only a dessertspoonful 
of beef to half a cup of water, two or three 
tablespoonfuls of Worcester sauce, two cans 
of mushrooms are stewed, separately, sea- 
soned with pepper, salt and butter, and put 
around the fish; the sauce is then poured over 
it. 

ESCABACHIO, COLD 

Ingredients: â Fried fish, cold, onions, 
vinegar, allspice and cloves. The vinegar 
is boiled with cloves and allspice in it. Put 
fish in dish with thin sliced onions on it, then 
pour the boiling vinegar and spices over this. 
Cover tightly, and set aside to cool. 

CRAB J A MB A LAY A 

One dozen crabs, boiled and cut up, one 
and a half cups of rice, three tomatoes, or a 



io SOUTHERN RECIPES 

half pint of canned tomatoes, one table- 
spoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of 
flour, one onion, chopped, one clove of garlic 
(minced fine), two quarts of boiling water. 
Salt and black pepper to taste. Put butter 
in pan and when hot, add onion and brown; 
then add flour and stir well, then add garlic; 
cook all a few minutes, but do not let burn 
or brown too much; add the tomatoes 
(which have been chopped fine), let all 
brown and simmer for ten minutes. When 
cooked add three quarts of boiling water 
(stock is better), then the crabs. Let this 
boil for ten minutes, then add one and a half 
cups of rice which has been well washed in 
cold water. Mix well together, and let boil 
for three quarters of an hour, stirring very 
little. 

TOSSED UP CODFISH 

Pick to pieces cold boiled codfish or use 
the desiccated which is already prepared. 
Prepare half a pint of thin cream and butter, 
to which add half a pint of milk, three hard 
boiled eggs cut up fine, a tablespoonful of 



FISH ii 

butter, a few grains of red pepper and some 
chopped parsley. Heat this till nearly boil- 
ing, then throw in the fish and boil up once. 

i 

CODFISH BALLS 

One pint of boneless codfish soaked over 
night, one quart of Irish potatoes; put Irish 
potatoes in a saucepan, after peeling, and 
the codfish on top of them, and enough water 
to cover all. Boil a half hour, drain off 
water, and mash fish and potatoes together, 
until light, then whip well together two eggs ; 
no salt, as fish is salt enough, but season with 
pepper. Mix with fish and potatoes, make 
into balls, and fry in plenty of lard. 

CURRY OF OYSTERS 

Two tablespoonfuls of butter, half a tea- 
spoonful of onion juice, one tablespoonful 
of flour, two teaspoonfuls curry powder, one- 
quarter of a pint of oyster liquor, one-quar- 
ter pint of milk, one small teaspoonful of 
salt, one solid pint of oysters. Put the but- 
ter and onion juice in a saucepan, when 
melted add the flour and curry powder and 



12 SOUTHERN RECIPES 

stir until smooth and bubbling, then add the 
oyster liquor and milk, also the salt. When 
the sauce is smooth and boils, put in the oys- 
ters and cook until they plump and the edges 
curl. 

PICKLED OYSTERS 

Get nice plump oysters, strain them in a 
colander to get the liquor. Take some of 
the liquor to wash the oysters in, then plump 
them in their own liquor, adding some salt. 
(Plumping means scalding.) Next, take 
the liquor, and if your vinegar is strong mix 
it with it, half and half; if not strong, use 
more vinegar than liquor; in this put cloves, 
allspice and a pod or two of red pepper, 
scald it and pour over your oysters, set them 
aside to cool and they are ready for use. 

Two gallons of opened oysters is about 
what we make at a time â use your own 
judgment about the quantity of cloves and 
allspice, you know they are strong. Keep 
them covered in a large tureen or stone jar 
for use 



MEATS 

BARBECUED PIG 

A pit two and a half feet deep by three 
feet long, and two feet wide, sticks of green 
wood, or, better still, iron rods, to fit across 
the pit. Build a large wood fire, and when it 
burns down to ashes, put on plenty of char- 
coal, as the fire is kept up by this. 

Split pig down the front, then rub well 
with salt and red pepper, cut slashes in the 
skin, so that the seasoning will get through, 
put pig over pit with skin side down. Into 
a pot put one quart of vinegar to boil, add 
one pound of butter, some Worcester sauce, 
tomato catsup, French mustard, and English 
mustard mixed, chowchow mustard, a few 
drops of tobasco and some salt, all of these 
I put to taste. Have a stick, with a mop 
made of cheese-cloth, and with this keep the 
pig well mopped all the time it is cooking,

quarts of cold water. Let this come to a 
hard boil, then add vegetables and season- 
ing. Put kettle back on fire, and let it sim-

soned stock, beat the yolks of three eggs 
slightly, add one-fourth of a teaspoonful each

paprika and cook until the mixture coats the 
spoon as a boiled custard. Remove from 
the fire and add one tablespoonful of granu- 
lated gelatine softened in one-fourth of a 
cup of the chicken stock. Strain over four 
ounces of cooked white meat of a chicken 
chopped and pounded in a mortar and passed

BIRDS (IN CHAFING DISH) 

Split birds open as for broiling and to one 
dozen sprinkle half a dozen small red pep- 
pers cut fine with scissors. Place in dish,

water), cover and steam until butter is 
melted, then add the following preparation: 
Put in a tumbler two tablespoonfuls of Wor- 
cestershire sauce, juice of one lemon and fill 
tumbler with port wine. After cooking for 
half an hour, add two cans of small mush- 
rooms. If birds are young, about two hours' 



MEATS 21 

time will be required to cook them. When 
thoroughly cooked and just before serving, 
add one teacup of cream thickened with flour. 

CALVES' HEARTS 
Take two calves' hearts, wash them well, 
put them to soak for twenty-four hours, well 
covered with one part vinegar and two parts 
water, with a light sprinkle of salt. When 
ready to cook, wash them again and fill the 
cells with grated bread crumbs and minced 
bacon seasoned with a little onion juice, pap- 
rika and salt. Lay strips of bacon on the 
hearts and bake until done. Serve with 
brown gravy. 

WHITE STEW (TERRAPIW

22 SOUTHERN RECIPES 

meat Let it only come to a boil, but stir 
continuously to prevent scorching. 

SWEETBREADS 

Soak them in salt water for about an hour, 
then parboil until tender, take out the stringy 
parts, put them in water for a few moments, 
dry them in a towel, dip in egg and crumbs 
and fry brown in butter. When they are 
done, put on a dish, pour into a frying pan 
a large cup of sweet cream, a little pepper 
and salt, a little green parsley chopped fine, 
dust in a very little flour; when it boils up

hot. 



VEGETABLES 

RICE CRUSTADES 

Two small teacups of rice boiled with 
plenty of salt; when soft add a can of toma- 
toes (or a quart of fresh tomatoes stewed), 
a good sized onion, parsley, two bay leaves 
and pepper; cook this in a double boiler for 
two hours until very stiff; mold in cups. 
When ready to use, turn out of cups, roll in 
egg and cracker crumbs and fry in deep fat; 
when hot, take out the center to form a pate 
case and fill with creamed sweetbread and 
mushrooms. 

SPANISH TOMATOES 

Cut up three large white onions, three bell 
peppers, and one ripe tomato. Melt a 
spoonful of butter in a frying pan and fry 
some of the tomatoes, peppers and onions, 
adding salt and pepper and a pinch of sugar. 
23 



24 SOUTHERN RECIPES 

Turn in a baking dish, add another spoonful 
of butter to pan, fry as before until all are 
done and in baking dish. Cover top layer 
with bread crumbs, and bake slowly. 

It is a rich dish, keeps nicely in ice box and 
is good cold for breakfast with hominy. 

CANDIED SWEET POTATOES 

Boil potatoes, then slice lengthwise, put in 
baking dish, adding butter, sugar and nutmeg 
(grated) to each layer of potatoes. Then 
pour over all a cup of boiling water. Bake 
in oven for fifteen or twenty minutes. 

BOILED RICE 

Rice should be well washed before boiling, 
in at least three waters. Put a quart of 
water on fire with a teaspoonful of salt in it 
and let it boil well, then add the rice. Stir 
occasionally, and with a wooden spoon. The 
boiling water tosses the grains of rice, and 
prevents them from sticking together. As 
soon as the grains begin to soften, do not 
by any circumstances stir or touch the rice 
again. Let it boil rapidly for twenty min- 



VEGETABLES 25 

utes, or until the grains swell out, and it ap-, 
pears to thicken. When it has reached this 
stage take off the cover, and pour off the 
water. Set pot in oven for a few minutes, 
do not let it brown, but simply dry out the 
water. 

SWEET POTATO PONE 

Six or eight potatoes (according to size), 
two eggs, half a cup of sugar (brown), half 
a cup of syrup, a little orange peel, and a 
teaspoonful of cinnamon. Wash and grate, 
without peeling, the potatoes. Beat sugar 
and eggs together, mix syrup with potatoes, 
then sugar and eggs and orange peel and cin- 
namon. Put all in a dish and bake. 



SALADS 

GVSPACHIO 

Ingredients â Hardtack, tomatoes, cucum- 
bers, sweet peppers (bell peppers), may- 
onnaise dressing. Soak the hardtack in 
water until soft enough to split; while this is 
soaking, peel and slice the tomatoes and cu- 
cumbers and cut the peppers in small pieces. 
Make mayonnaise thick, as all the vegetables 
are so watery. Put first a layer of hardtack, 
then the mayonnaise, tomatoes, then dress- 
ing, cucumbers and peppers, and more dress- 
ing. Fill the bowl in this way. This dish 
is much better kept for twenty-four hours. 

ONION SALAD 

Two or three large Spanish onions sliced 

thin, pour boiling water over them, drain, 

put on cold water with a teaspoonful of salt, 

stand half an hour, repeat four or five times.

SALADS 27 

Then stand in cold water and salt until ready 
to serve. French dressing. For a noon 
dinner prepare the night before. 

FROZEN FRUIT SALAD 

Six large oranges, four bananas, six ap- 
ples, one pound of Malaga grapes, one tea- 
cup of Maraschino cherries, one-half a tea-

ing pan, pour boiling water into the dish 
around the molds, bake until the centers are 
firm, do not allow the water to boil, be sure 
that the egg mixture comes to the top of the 
pimento. Serve with cream sauce. Color 
sauce green. 

EGG-NOG 

Allowing one egg to each person, beat the 
yolks and whites separately. Beat the yolks 
until creamy, then beat in the sugar (granu- 
lated), one tablespoonful to each tgg, beat 
until very light, then add whiskey (three 
tablespoonfuls to an egg), drop it in slowly 
to the yolks and sugar, beating all the time; 
then add whites which have been beaten to a 



MISCELLANEOUS 59 

stiff froth. A half cup of whipped cream to 
each egg adds very much to the goodness. 

PEACH BLOW 

Peel peaches and cut up fine, sugar and 
pour over some whiskey (to taste) or better 
still, brandy. Let stand for several hours 
then serve in a glass with crushed ice, mixing 
well together ice and peaches. 

FOR AFTERNOON TEA 

Put into a bowl two slices of preserved 
pineapple and cover well with rum. Let 
stand five or six hours, then cut up pineapples 
in small pieces and put a teaspoonful of the 
rum and a small piece of pineapple in each 
cup of tea. 

A NICE CHEESE DISH 

A medium sized piece of Roquefort cheese, 
butter or cream cheese; as many drops of 
tobasco sauce as there are people to be 
served, a liberal quantity of Worcester sauce, 
a little mustard, salt and pepper (blacK and 



60 SOUTHERN RECIPES 

red), a little paprika, a wineglass of sherry. 
Mix all these thoroughly and serve with 
salads. Make into balls or a pyramid. 

MINT JULEP 

Put one lump of sugar to every person and 
two or three extras. Put into a pitcher with 
several sprigs of mint and pour over this boil- 
ing water (half a pint) ; set aside to cool. 
Have julep glasses ready (by rubbing the 
rims with lemon and dipping in granulated 
sugar to frost them), fill glasses with crushed 
ice and stick a sprig of mint in the sides, also 
straws. Then take the syrup and put two 
jiggers of whiskey to one of syrup and pour 
over the crushed ice. I usually measure all 
I want to make, putting it in a pitcher and 
adding more whiskey or brandy if necessary, 
then pour over ice. Serve at once. 

YEAST 

Eight pints of boiling water in a porcelain 
kettle, have ready twelve large Irish potatoes 
peeled and in cold water, grate rapidly one 
by one and stir in the boiling water until it 



MISCELLANEOUS 61 

is as thick as paste, remove from the fire as 
soon as the potatoes are well done. Add 
when cool one pint of yeast, put in a large 
bowl to rise. Next day beat down, add one 
cup of sugar, one cup of salt, let it rise a 
second time, beat down again, pour into a 
jug and keep well corked. This yeast will 
keep several months. I frequently add to 
the above a pint of strong hop tea.

SOUPS 

GUMBO FILi 

Let me tell you what file is: A powder 
made by drying sassafras and bay leaves, 
then grinding to a powder. 

One large chicken, or two pounds of bris- 
ket, one tablespoonful of lard (kitchen 
spoon), two tablespoonfuls of flour, sifted, 
one onion chopped fine, also some parsley 
and thyme chopped fine, two quarts of oyster 
liquor, heated, two quarts of boiling water, 
salt and pepper to taste; one can of tomatoes 
(pint) , one hundred oysters. Cut up chicken 
as for frying, put lard in kettle, which has 
become hot. When lard is melted and hot 
add flour and cook till brown, stirring con- 
stantly to keep from burning. Then brown 
the diopped onion In this flour and lard. 



2 SOUTHERN RECIPES 

Now put in your meat, and stir it for twenty 
minutes. In this roux add water gradually, 
and when all is added, put in the pint can of 
tomatoes, also parsley and thyme; set the 
kettle back on the stove to cook slowly for 
three hours. A half hour before serving 
put in your oysters, let them cook only half 
an hour, then take kettle off the fire, and put 
two tablespoonfuls of file in, stirring all the 
time. This thickens gumbo. Pour at once 
into hot tureen and serve. This should be 
served with boiled rice. 

SPINACH SOUP 

Half a peck of spinach, one quart of 
stock, one pint of milk, half a pint of cream, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter and three of 
flour, one teaspoonful of sugar; salt, and pep- 
per to taste. Wash spinach, simmer half an 
hour in covered stewpan, without water, 
chop fine, pound to a paste; put butter and 
flour in stewpan, stir until smooth and frothy, 
then add spinach, sugar, salt and pepper and 
stir ten minutes; gradually add stock, and 
when the mixture begins to boil add hot milk

and creamy boil up once, rub through a fine 
sieve, return to fire. Serve when hot A 
little onion improves it. 

WHITE POTATO SOUP 

One quart milk, six large potatoes, one 
stalk celery, one onion, and one tablespoon* 
ful of butter. Put milk to boil with onion 
and celery. Pare potatoes and boil thirty 
minutes, mash fine and light, add boiling milk 
and butter, salt and pepper, to taste. Rub 
through a strainer and serve immediately.

put with them one quart of black beans into 
cold water, one tablespoonful of cloves 
(whole) , three-fourths of a tablespoonful of 
allspice, (no vegetables). Cook all day, 
stirring occasionally, so the beans will not 
bum; strain, add good glass of wine, hard 
boiled egg, and slice lemon. Pepper and 
salt.

heaping tablespoonful butter, one quart of 
milk, season with salt, pepper, spices, and a 
wineglass of sherry. Put flour and butter in

FISH 

TURBOT 2 LA CRkME 

Boil your fish (red snapper if turbot canÂ« 
not be had) in strong salt water, remove 
bones and flake it in as large pieces as possi- 
ble. Boil one quart of sweet cream, into 
which put a small onion (whole), a bunch 
of parsley; then add three tablespoonfuls of 
flour, smoothly mixed in a little milk, stir 
until cream begins to thicken and is smooth. 
(It will take about five or eight minutes.) 
Remove onion and parsley and pour into the 
mixture quarter of a pound of melted butter. 
Butter a deep baking dish ; put in first a layer 
of fish, then a layer of grated cheese (stale 
Edam is very fine), then a layer of cream 
mixture, and so on until dish is filled; sift 
over the top a layer of stale grated bread 
crumbs or cracker crumbs and cheese. Bake

parsley, a little cayenne pepper and a lemon 
which has been very delicately sliced. Let 
this mixture come to a boil, and when it has 
boiled two minutes remove from the fire and 
serve hot with the fish. If sauce should get 
too stiff, it can be thinned by adding a little 
vinegar. 

COURTBOUILLON

fuls of flour, one large onion, six fresh to- 
matoes or a pint of canned tomatoes, four

Cut the fish as for frying, put lard in deep 
kettle, and when hot add gradually the flour^ 
constantly stirring to prevent burning. 
Then put in onion and garlic (which has 
been chopped fine), also parsley chopped, 
mashed allspice. Add the tomatoes chopped 
fine, also the potatoes, sliced thin, the glass

well, and then add the salt and cayenne pep- 
per to taste and when it has boiled five or 
ten minutes, add the fish, putting in one piece 
at a time; add the juice of a lemon, and let 
all boil fifteen minutes.

the latter is best if red snapper is used. 

Ingredients: Tomatoes, garlic, Worces- 
ter sauce, beef extract, black pepper, salt. 

The tomatoes are stewed with a small 
piece of garlic in them for about two hours, 



FISH 9 

and then strained through a cloth, and re- 
tu]*ned to the pot to be thickened with corn 
starch to a proper consistency. The Wor- 
cester sauce, beef extract, pepper and salt 
must be put into the tomatoes after being 
strained; half a teacup of beef extract, of 
course diluted, using only a dessertspoonful 
of beef to half a cup of water, two or three 
tablespoonfuls of Worcester sauce, two cans

soned with pepper, salt and butter, and put

Cover tightly, and set aside to cool. 

CRAB JAMBALAYA

and a half cups of rice, three tomatoes, or a 



lo SOUTHERN RECIPES 

half pint of canned tomatoes, one table- 
spoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of 
flour, one onion, chopped, one clove of garlic 
(minced fine), two quarts of boiling water. 
Salt ajnd black pepper to taste. Put butter 
in pan and when hot, add onion and brown; 
then add flour and stir well, then add garlic; 
cook all a few minutes, but do not let burn 
or brown too much; add the tomatoes 
(which have been chopped fine), let all 
brown and simmer for ten minutes. When 
cooked add three quarts of boiling water 
(stock is better), then the crabs. Let this 
boil for ten minutes, then add one and a half 
cups of rice which has been well washed in 
cold water. Mix well together, and let boil 
for three quarters of an hour, stirring very 
little. 

TOSSED UP CODFISH 

Pick to pieces cold boiled codfish or use 
the desiccated which Is already prepared. 
Prepare half a pint of thin cream and butter, 
to which add half a pint of milk, three hard 
boiled eggs cut up fine, a tablespoonful of 



FISH II 

butter, a few grains of red pepper and some 
chopped parsley. Heat this till nearly boil- 
ing, then throw in the fish and boil up once. 

CODFISH BALLS 

One pint of boneless codfish soaked over 
night, one quart of Irish potatoes; put Irish 
potatoes in a saucepan, after peeling, and 
the codfish on top of them, and enough water 
to cover all. Boil a half hour, drain off 
water, and mash fish and potatoes together, 
until light, then whip well together two eggs ; 
no salt, as fish is salt enough, but season with 
pepper. Mix with fish and potatoes, make 
into balls, and fry in plenty of lard. 

CURRY OF OYSTERS 

Two tablespoonfuls of butter, half a tea- 
spoonful of onion juice, one tablespoonful 
of flour, two teaspoonfuls curry powder, one- 
quarter of a pint of oyster liquor, one-quar- 
ter pint of milk, one small teaspoonful of 
salt, one solid pint of oysters. Put the but- 
ter and onion juice in a saucepan, when 
melted add the flour and curry powder and 



12 SOUTHERN RECIPES 

stir until smooth and bubbling, then add the 
oyster liquor and milk, also the salt. When 
the sauce is smooth and boils, put in the oys- 
ters and cook until they plump and the edges 
curl. 

PICKLED OYSTERS 

Get nice plump oysters, strain them in a 
colander to get the liquor. Take some of 
the liquor to wash the oysters in, then plump 
them in their own liquor, adding some salt. 
(Plumping means scalding.) Next, take 
the liquor, and if your vinegar is strong mix 
it with it, half and half; if not strong, use 
more vinegar than liquor; in this put cloves, 
allspice and a pod or two of red pepper, 
scald it and pour over your oysters, set them 
aside to cool and they are ready for use. 

Two gallons of opened oysters is about 
what we make at a time â use your own 
judgment about the quantity of cloves and 
allspice, you know they are strong. Keep 
them covered in a large tureen or stone jar 
for use

coffeespoonful of white peppercorns have 
been added, remove it from the fire and pour 
about half a gill of cold water, five egg yolks, 
two ounces of butter, salt and grated nutmeg.

boiling water or on a very slow fire. Stir 
constantly with a wire egg-beater and as soon 
as the sauce thickens add in small pieces six 
ounces of butter until all is consumed; 
squeeze in the juice of one lemon and if the 
sauce is too thick, add a little more water to 
it. Strain, put into a vessel, in a fain marie,

line each with a canned pimento. Trim (with

form a perfect edge. Beat six eggs without 
separating, add a scant teaspoonful of salt, 
a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, twenty 
drops of onion juice, and a half cup of milk; 
stir until well mixed; use this to fill the 
pimentos. Set the molds on paper in a bak- 
ing pan, pour boiling water into the dish 
around the molds, bake until the centers are 
firm, do not allow the water to boil, be sure 
that the egg mixture comes to the top of the 
pimento. Serve with cream sauce. Color 
sauce green.

until very light, then add whiskey (three 
tablespoonfuls to an egg), drop it in slowly 
to the yolks and sugar, beating all the time; 
then add whites which have been beaten to a

stiff froth. A half cup of whipped cream to 
each egg adds very much to the goodness. 

PEACH BLOW 

Peel peaches and cut up fine, sugar and 
pour over some whiskey (to taste) or better 
still, brandy. Let stand for several hours 
then serve in a glass with crushed ice, mixing 
well together ice and peaches.

â¢ Mmr JVLEP 

Put one lump of sugar to every person and 
two or three extras. Put into a pitcher with 
several sprigs of mint and pour over this boil- 
ing water (half a pint) ; set aside to cool. 
Have julep glasses ready (by rubbing the 
rims with lemon and dipping in granulated 
sugar to frost them), fill glasses with crushed 
ice and stick a sprig of mint in die sides, also 
straws. Then take the syrup and put two 
jiggers of whiskey to one of syrup and pour 
over the crushed ice. I usually measure all 
I want to make, putting it in a pitcher and 
adding more whiskey or brandy if necessary, 
then pour over ice. Serve at once.

kettle, have ready twelve large Irish potatoes

is as thick as paste, remove from the Hre as 
soon as the potatoes are well done. Add 
when cool one pint of yeast, put in a large 
bowl to rise. Next day beat down, add one 
cup of sugar, one cup of salt, let it rise a 
second time, beat down again, pour into a 
jug and keep well corked. This yeast will 
keep several months. I frequently add to 
the above a pint of strong hop tea.
