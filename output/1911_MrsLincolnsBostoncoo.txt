PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION 



When the ''Boston Cook Book" was first published, 
cooking schools were in their infancy, and some sugges- 
tions as to their management were included in its pages. 
But now, after sixteen years' dissemination of these sug- 
gestions, it seems no longer advisable to include them in 
a cook book. Therefore, in making this first revision of 
my book I have utilized the pages previously devoted to 
this subject and to the general index, which is superfluous, 
as the alphabetical index is so comprehensive, also the 
blank spaces at the end of some chapters, for about three 
hundred additional recipes, and this without increasing the 
size or the price. 

The subject of each section forms the heading of the 
page. 

Since granulated gelatine and baking powder are now 
sa universally used, the proportions of each are given 
where needed. Recipes for many new food products are 
inserted, and many minor changes made in the text. 

This revised edition is not the new hook which has been 
in preparation for some time. Unavoidable delays in the 
completion of the latter and the large demand for extra 
copies from many persons who have worn out their first 



viii Preface to the Revised Edition. 

books have led me to make this revision of the "Boston 
Cook Book -' now. 

The new book will contain many features not practicable 
here, and is designed not to supi^lant but to su2?jyle7nent 
my first book.

PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION, 



To compile a book which shall be not only a collection 
of receipts, given briefly for the experienced housekeeper, 
and with sufficient clearness for the beginner, but which 
shall also embody enough of physiolog}', and of the chem- 
istiy and philosoph}' of food, to make every principle in- 
telligible to a child and interesting to the mature mind ; 
which shall serve equallv well for the cook in the kitchen, 
the pupil in the school-room, and the teacher in the normal 
class, — is a difficult task. Yet the need of a book of 
moderate cost, containing in a reasonably small compass all 
this and much more, has been seriously felt bj^ all who are 
engaged in teaching cookery. Moreover, there is a special 
reason for the publication of this work. It is undertaken 
at the urgent request of the pupils of the Boston Cooking 
School, who have desired that the receipts and lessons 
given during the last four years in that institution should 
be arranged in a permanent form. 

To one who from childhood has been trained in all de- 
tails of housework, learning by observation or b}' actual 
experience much that it is impossible to receive from 
books, the amount of ignorance shown by man}- women is 
surprising. That a person of ordinary intelligence pre- 
siding over her household can be satisfied with only a 
vague conception of the common domestic methods, or 
that any true woman can see anything degrading in an}' 
labor necessary for the highest physical condition of her 



^DBLIC j

family, would be incredible if the truth of it were not 
dail}^ manifest. 

Happil}', popular opinion now decides that no 3'oung 
lady's education is complete without a course of training 
in one or more branches of domestic work. And those 
who are not so fortunate as to have the best of all train- 
ing — that of actual work under a wise and competent 
mother — gladl}" resort to the cooking-schools for in- 
struction. 

In compiling these receipts for use in a school and in 
the family, several things were demanded. In a school 
of pupils from every class and station in life, a great 
variety of receipts is desirable. They must be clear, 
but concise, for those who are already well grounded in 
first principles. The}' must be explained, illustrated, and 
reiterated for the inexperienced and the careless. They 
must have a word of caution for those who seem alwa3'S 
to have the knack of doing the wrong thing. They must 
include the most healthful foods for those who have been 
made ill by improper food ; the cheapest as well as the 
most nutritious, for the laboring class ; the richest and 
most elaborately prepared, for those who can afford them 
physically as well as pecuniaril3\ 

These receipts are not a mere compilation. A large 
portion have accumulated during a long period of house- 
keeping ; and many have been received from friends who 
are practical housekeepers. Others have been taken from 
standard authorities on cooking ; and all have been fre- 
quently and thoroughly tested by pupils under the eye of 
the author. As far as possible, acknowledgment has been 
made for the receipts received. Where changes and im- 
provements have been made, or where there were many 
authorities for the same formula, no credit has been given. 

Some cook-books presuppose the presence of an as- 
sistant ; but as three fourths of the women in this country 



Preface, xi 



do their own work, these receipts are arranged so as to 
require the attention of but one person. 

It is proverbial that 3'oung housekeepers are often 
greatly perplexed in attempting to provide little enough 
for onl}' two. For their benefit man^' of our receipts are 
prepared on a scale of smaller measurements. 

The materials to be used are given in the order in which 
the}^ are to be put together. They are arranged in col- 
umns, where the eye may catch them readil}^, or in italics 
where economy of space seemed desirable. 

Every caution or suggestion has been given at the re- 
quest of some pupil who failed to find in other books just 
what she needed ; or because, in the experience of teach- 
ing, it has been shown that, unless forewarned, pupils 
inevitably make certain mistakes. Many subjects which 
in other books are omitted or given briefly, will be found 
to have received here an extensive treatment, because 
they have seemed of paramount importance. 

All the chemical and ph3'siological knowledge that is 
necessar}' for a clear understanding of the laws of health, 
so far as they are involved in the science of cooker}^, is 
given in this book. Nine tenths of the women who go 
through a scientific course in seminaries never put any 
of the knowledge gained into practical use. B}' the time 
the}' have occasion to use such knowledge in their own 
homes, the Chemistr}- and Physiologj^ have been relegated 
to the attic, where they help mice to material for their 
nests, but help no woman to appl}' the principles of 
science upon which the health and welfare of her house- 
hold largely depend. 

The statement will appear incredible to most people, 
and 3'et it is true, that many women do not know what 
the simplest things in our dailj' food are ; cannot tell when 
water boils, or the difl'erence between lamb and veal, lard 
and drippings. They cannot give the names of kitchen 



xii Preface. 



utensils ; do not know anj'thing about a stove, or how to 
pare a potato. This will explain what might otherwise 
seem an unnecessarj^ minuteness of detail. The expe- 
rience of such ignorance also suggested the sub-title oi 
the " Boston Cook Book," — " What to do and what not 
to do in Cooking," — just how to hold your bowl and spoon, 
to use your hands, to regulate your stove, to wash youf 
dishes ; and just how not to fall into the errors into which 
so many have stumbled before 3'ou. But, more than all, 
it is attempted to give a reason for everj' step taken, and 
a clear answer to any questions that are likelj' to arise in 
tlie experience of either housekeeper or cook, 

A WORD of grateful acknowledgment is due the manj 
friends who have aided in this work. 

First, to my mother I owe much for her excellent judg- 
ment in training me as a child to a love for all house- 
hold work. Although it was often hard to " help mother " 
when other children were at play, the knowledge thus 
gained has proved invaluable. Every year's experience 
in teaching has made me prize more and more this earl^ 
training. 

Also, I am deeply indebted to Miss M. S. Devereux 
for the Illustrations of this book. In all my work I have 
been greatly aided by her suggestions and generous 
sympathy. 

And, lastly, I would not forget my obligations to a large 
circle of personal friends. Especially would I remember 
the one who, twenty years ago, aided me in making my 
first loaf of bread, and the many among my pupils who, 
out of their varied experience, have contributed much that 
has proved helpful.

THE BOSTOIT COOK BOOK. 




COOKERY 

Cookery is the art of preparing food for the nourish- 
ment of the human body. When given its proper impor- 
tance in the consideration of health and comfort, it must 
be based upon scientific principles of hygiene and what 
the French call the minor moralities of the household. 
All civilized nations cook their food, to improve its taste 
and digestibility. The degree of civilization is often 
measured by the cuisine. 

Cooking (from the Latin coquo, to boil, bake, heat, dry, 
scorch, or ripen) is usually done by the direct application 
of heat. Fruits and some vegetables which are eaten in a 
natural state have really been cooked or ripened by the 
heat of the sun. Milk and eggs, which are types of per- 
fect food, would be useless as food unless they came from 
the warm living animal. Fish, flesh, and fruits which 
have been dried in the sun or smoked, and are often eaten 
without any further preparation, have undergone a certain 
process of natural cooking. 

Beat seems to create new flavors, and to change the 
odor, taste, and digestibility of nearly all articles of food. 
It swells and bursts the starch cells in flour, rice, and 
potatoes ; hardens the albumen in eo^as, flsh, and meat ; 
softens the fibrous substances in tough meats, hard vege- 
tables and fruits. It develops new flavors in tea, coflee, 
roasted meat, crusts of bread, baked beans, etc. 

1 



The Boston Cook Book, 



Cold is also an important matter to be regarded in the 
preparation of food. Sweet dislies and certain flavors, 
like hone}-, ices, and custards ; the water, wine, or milk we 
drink ; our butter, fruits, and salads, — are all more pala- 
table when cold. 

Water ^ or some other liquid, in connection with heat is 
necessarj^ in many forms of cookery. Grains, peas, beans, 
dried fruits which have parted with nearly all their moisture 
in the ripening or drjing process necessarj' for their preser- 
vation, need a large portion of water in cooking, to soften 
and swell the cellulose, gluten, and starch before thej- can 
be masticated and digested. In some vegetables and fruits 
water draws out certain undesirable flavors ; it softens 
.and dissolves the gelatinous portions of meat, and makes 
palatable and nourishing man}' substances which would be 
rendered unwholesome b}" a dry heat. 

Air^ or the free action of oxj-gen, upon our food while 
cooking develops certain flavors not otherwise to be ob- 
tained. Meat roasted or broiled has a much finer flavor 
than when boiled, baked, or fried. Toasted bread, thin 
corn cake baked before the fire, roasted apples, and many 
articles cooked in the open air, show the benefit of this 
free combined action of heat and air. 

Drying in the sun was one of the earliest modes of 
cooker}'. Then came roasting before an open fire, or 
broihng over the coals, and baking in the hot ashes. 
This last was the primitive oven. As the art of making 
cooking-utensils developed, stewing, boiUng, and frying 
were adopted. Then, to economize heat, portable ovens 
were invented ; these were originally a covered dish set 
over or near the fire, having sometimes ft double cover 
filled with coals. Afterwards, stoves which kept the fire 
and heat in a limited space were introduced; and im- 
provements have been made in them so extensively that 
we now have them with conveniences for doing every form 
of cooking with wood, coal, oil, or gas. 

Some one oive^^ this distinction between man and other 
animals : " Man is an animal that builds a fire and uses it 



Fire, 3 

to cook his food." It is quite important then, as a step- 
ping-stone to cooking, to learn the properties and manage- '^OSt^: 
ment of a fire. , ^^' O i^r 

Fire. 

Fire is heat and light produced b}- the combustion of 
inflammable substances. Combustion is a chemical opera- 
tion carried on in the air, or the chemical union of the 
ox3'gen of the air with some combustible bod}', like h}^- 
drogen gas or the solid carbon, and is attended with the 
evolution of heat and lioht. The heat and the lio;ht come 
from the sun. With every particle of vegetable matter 
that is formed by the combined action of the sun and the 
carbonic acid gas in the air, a portion of the sun's heat 
and light is absorbed and held fast in it. And whenever 
this vegetable matter is decomposed, — as in burning wood, 
coal, or oil, which are onh' definite forms of vegetable mat- 
ter, — this heat and light are given out. The amount of 
each depends upon the mode of burning. 

Ah' is composed mainh' of two elementary gases, ox3'gen 
and nitrogen (one part oxygen and four parts nitrogen), 
with a small amount of watery vapor and carbonic acid gas. 

Pure oxj'gen is a gas ^.'hich has a wonderful attraction 
for, and power of combination with, every other element. 
If it were everywhere present in a perfect!}' pure state, it 
would consume or burn up everything ; but it is diluted 
or mixed (not combined) with nitrogen, another gas which 
is incombustible, and which lessens the combustibility of 
everything with which it comes in contact. Owing to this 
dilution, the ox3'gen will not unite with the carbon and 
hydrogen with which it is everywhere surrounded, and 
produce ra/7zW combustion, except at a high temperature. 
The temperature at which this union takes place is called 
the burning-point, and this varies in different substances. 
Thus combustion is within the power and control of man ; 
and some extra means are usually employed to increase 
the temperature to the burning-point, — friction, or per- 
cussion, or the use of some more highly inflammable 



The Boston Cook Booh. 



substances, like sulphur and phosphorus. This produces 
heat sufficient to complete the chemical union, or, in com- 
mon phrase, " kindles the fire." 

The heat generated for all household purposes is produced 
b}' the chemical action of the oxygen of the air upon the h}'- 
drogen and carbon which are found in the various kinds ot 
wood and coal. The ox3'gen first combines with the car- 
bon and decomposes it, producing carbonic acid gas, which 
escapes into the air, from which it is absorbed b}- plants, or 
b}' human lungs when there is no proper ventilation. The 
oxygen also combines with the hj'drogen gas in the fuel, 
and this produces the flame ; the larger the amount of 
h3'drogen in the fuel, the greater the amount of flame. 
Some of the products of combustion are not entirelj' con^ 
suraed, and pass ofi" as smoke ; some are incombustible, and 
remain as ashes. The intensity of a fire and the amount 
of heat which it produces are always in proportion to the 
amount of oxygen with which it is supplied. There should 
be just air enough for perfect combustion. An excess of 
air projected upon a fire convejs away the heat, cools the 
fuel, and checks the combustion. The suppl}' of air should 
be controlled bv confining it in a limited space. 

Fires are usuall_y kindled at the bottom of a flue or chim« 
ney. The heated air, being lighter, rises ; the colder, den- 
ser air rushes in to take its place, becomes heated, and 
ascends. Thus a continuous current is established, and a 
constant supply of fresh air secured. The chimnej^ serves 
to cany off the smoke and poisonous products of combus- 
tion ; the heavier, incombustible products settle in the form 
of ashes. The force of this current of air drawing through 
the chimney (a matter of great importance) is called the 
draught. It varies with the temperature and amount of 
air in the room, and the length and width of the chimney. 

Fuel. 

The materials generally used as fuel are wood, charcoal, 
coal, kerosene oil, and gas. 



Fuel. 5 

Soft woods, such as pine or birch, kindle quickl}', produce 
intense heat, and are best for a quick, blazing fire. 

Hard woods, like oak, ash, and hickory, burn more slowly, 
but produce harder coals, which retain the heat longer, and 
are better where long-continued heat is required. 

Charcoal, which is coal made by charring or burning 
wood with only a limited supply of air, burns easily and 
produces greater heat in proportion to its weight than an}^ 
other fuel. It should never be burned in a close room. 

Anthracite coal is a kind of mineral charcoal derived from 
ancient vegetation buried in the earth, and so thoroughly 
pressed that nothing is left but pure carbon, a little sul- 
phur, and the incombustible ash. It kindles slowlj', jields 
an intense, steady heat, and burns for a longer time with- 
out replenishing than the hardest wood. 

Coke, often used in cities, is the residue of coal from 
which illuminating gas has been manufactured. The beat 
is intense, but transient. 

Stoves for burning kerosene oil and gas have recently 
been introduced, and are now so nearl}' perfect that the 
care of a fire for cooking purposes is trifling. Gas can 
only be used in certain localities. 

The cheapest fuel is the best kerosene oil. There need 
be no waste, no superfluous heat, no vitiated air, if the fire 
be extinguished immediately after the work is done, and if 
the stove be kept perfectly clean, so as to secure a free 
burning and perfect combustion. With two good stoves 
having all the latest and best improvements, a large amount 
of work can be easil}" and satisfactorily accomplished. 

The Making and Care of a Coal Fire. 

If you intend to bu}' a new stove or range, get one sim- 
ple in construction, that 3'ou ma\^ quickly learn all its parts 
and their uses ; plain in finish, that you may easily keep it 
clean ; and perfectly fitted part to part, with doors and 
dampers shutting absolutely close, so that 3'ou may con- 
trol the fire and heat. This latter point is of essentia: 




The Boston Cook Book. 



importance in regulating the oven and in preventing a 
waste of fuel. 

Become thorouglil}' acquainted with whatever stove j^ou 
may have. If necessarj', take it apart ; learn how to 
clean it in the inside, to regulate the dampers for all the 
variations of wind, temperature, and fuel; and then learn. 
how to make and keep a fire. 

All stoves have a fire-box, with more or less space under- 
neath for ashes ; a slide damper under the fire, letting in 
the air ; an outlet for the smoke ; and a damper which reg- 
ulates the suppl3' of hot air, sending it around and under- 
neath the oven, or letting it escape into tlie chimne}'. 
Remove the covers aad brush the soot from the top of the 
oven into the fire-box ; then clean out the grate ; and if 
the stove have conveniences for so doing, sift the ashes in 
the stove and save all the old coal and cinders. Put in 
shavings or loose rolls of paper, then fine pine kindlings, 
arranged crosswise, and a lajer of hard wood, leaving 
plenty of air space between the pieces. Be sure the wood 
comes out to each end of the fire-box. Put on the covers ; 
and if the stove need cleaning, moisten some pulverized 
stove polish with water, and rub the stove with a paint 
brush dipped in the polish. When all blackened, rub with 
a dry polishing-brush until nearly dry. Open the direct 
draught and oven damper, and light the paper, as a slight 
heat facilitates the process of polishing. When the wood 
is thoroughly kindled, fill the fire-box with coal even with 
the top of the oven. Brush up the hearth and floor, empty 
the teakettle, and fill it witli fresh water. Watch the fire, 
and push the coal down as the wood burns away, and 
add enough more coal to keep it even with the top of the 
fire bricks. When the blue flame becomes white, close the 
oven damper ; and when the coal is burning freely, but not 
red, shut the direct draught. It seems impossible for some 
persons to understand that a coal fire is at its height as 
soon as well kindled, and needs only air enough to keep it 
burning. When it becomes bright red all through, it has 
parted with most of its heat, and begins to die out. Tons

of coal are wasted in many kitchens, and ranges are need- 
lessl}^ burned out, by filling the fire-box till the coal touches 
the covers, aixl leaving the draughts open till the coal is 
red. 

Nearly all stoves and portable ranges have the oven at 
one side of and a little below the fire. In brick-set ranges 
the ovens are sometimes over the fire. A stove has a door 
on each side of the oven, with the fire-box in front. A 
portable range has only one oven-door, and the fire-box at / f- q 
the end. In ranges where the oven is over the fire, the V^^^. 
articles to be baked are placed on a grate near the middle, 
as the bottom of the oven is usually very hot. In stoves 
or portable ranges anything which has to rise in the oven, 
like bread, pastry, cake, etc., is placed on the bottom of 
the oven, and, if the heat be too great, a small rack or 
grate may be placed under it. Large pieces of meat are 
placed on a rack in a pan ; while small cuts of meat, birds, 
etc., which are to be baked quickly, and any dishes which 
are to be merely browned, like scalloped dishes, must be 
placed on the grate near the top. Cultivate the habit of 
opening and shutting the oven-door quickly but gently. 
Learn the hottest and coolest places in the oven. Look at 
things as th^y are baking, and turn and watch till you are 
sure they can be left alone. If anything bake uneven!}^ or 
too fast, put a screen between it and the heat, — a pan on 
the grate above or underneath, or a frame of stiff" paper 
made larger than the pan, that it may not touch the dough. 
When the regulating dampers are closed and the oven is 
still too hot, lift a cover on the top partly off", although in 
a stove in which the parts are perfectl}' adjusted this will 
never be necessar3\ When the oven is not hot enough, 
open the direct draught, and rake out the ashes from the 
grate. Keep the grate cleaned out and the fire burning 
freety, when a very hot oven is needed. At other times 
keep the draughts shut and do not waste the coal. 

To keep a brisk fire for several hours or all dav, it is 
better to add a sprinkling of coal often, rather than to let 
It burn nearly out, and then, by adding a larger quantity,

check the fire and retard the work. lu using the top of 
the stove remember the hottest place is over the fire and 
toward the middle, not on the front of the stove. When 
you have once watched the flame in its passage over the 
top, down the back, and under the oven, then across, out 
and up on the opposite side and out into the chimney, you 
will understand where the greatest heat must be. 



Boiling. 

The term " boiling'* is often used erroneousl}^ in cook- 
ery. The expressions '' the teakettle boils," " the rice is 
boiling," "boiled beef," etc., are all good illustrations of 
the rhetorical figure metonymy^ but they are practically 
incorrect. In all cases it is onh' the water or liquid which 
boils. No solid can boil until first changed to a liquid. 
Solids become liquid at the melting-point. Liquids take 
the form of steam or vapor at the boiling-point. Boiling 
is the conversion of a hquid into steam by the application 
of heat sufficient to cause ebullition^ or agitation of its sur- 
face. Boiling, therefore, as applied to the cooking of 
solids, is heating or cooking in a boiling liquid. It is one 
of the most generally used, and abused, forms of cooking. 
Boihng water, which is really cooked water, is the liquid 
usually employed. Water, as it is heated from below, ex- 
pands into vapor. The air of the water and the steam 
shoot up in the form of bubbles ; as they come in contact 
with the cold water near the surface, the bubbles collapse, 
the steam is condensed and descends with the cold water, 
making a double set of currents, which causes quite a com- 
motion among the particles. As the whole bod}^ of water 
becomes hotter, these bubbles of steam rise higher and 
higher before collapsing, and occasion the sound which 
we call the " singing of the kettle." When the water is 
sufficiently heated, they rise and break at the surface, 
causing more or less agitation, according to the rapidity 
with which they are formed. Water is scalding hot at 
150°, or when the hand cannot be borne in it. Water 



Boiling Water, 



timmers when the bubbles all collapse beneath the surfaeej 
and the steam is condensed to water again, or at 185°* 
Water boils when the bubbles rise to the surface, and the 
steam is thrown off, as at 212°. When this boiling-point 
is reached, the heat escapes with the steam ; and all the fire 
in the world cannot make the water any hotter, so long as 
the steam escapes. If the fire be ver}- fierce, so that these 
bubbles are formed and expelled rapidl3', and the water 
boils over, the water is no hotter ; it only evaporates or 
boils away faster, and can onl}' be made hotter by confin- 
ing the steam, which in ordinar}' kettles is impossible, 
owing to the enormous expansive force of the steam. 
With a few exceptions it is a waste of fuel, time, and ma~ 
terial to keep the water boiling at such a galloping rate 
that the cover has to be lifted to prevent boiling over. 

A kettle should never be quite full, as the water ex- 
pands in heating, and, in boiling over, makes needless 
work and injures the stove. Water will boil more quickly 




in a kettle with a rough surface than in one with a smooth 
surface, as the water adheres to a smooth surface with 
greater force, and this force or attraction must be over- 
come before boiling takes place. Small, clean gravel is 
sometimes kept in a smooth kettle to facilitate the boiling. 

Water boils at a higher temperature when there is sugar, 
or salt, or anything in it to increase its density'. It takes 
longer for it to boil ; but it is hotter, when that point is 
reached. No one who has been burned by boiling syrup 
ever doubted this fact. Fresh water boils at 212°; salt 
water, at 224°. If we put salt with the water in the lower 
part of a double boiler, a greater degree of heat is obtained 
hy which to cook the articles in the top. 

Water boils at a lower temperature, that is, more quickl}^, 
when the pressure of the air upon the water is diminished. 
Before a rain the pressure of the air is lessened, because 
the air when filled with vapor is lighter. Observing house- 
keepers have often noticed how quickh' things burn at such 
a time, and foretell a rain by the rapidity with which wat&i 
evaporates. 



lo The Boston Cook Booh 

The pressure of the air is less the higher we ascend 
above the level of the sea, since we leave much of the air 
below us. Cooking in boiling water requires a much 
longer time in mountainous regions ; for the water boils so 
quickly that it holds less heat than in lower altitudes, 
where it is subject to greater pressure. Water, in boiling, 
loses the air or gases which give it a fresh taste and spark- 
ling appearance. It becomes flat and tasteless. If there 
be an}^ impurit}' in water, boiling or cooking will destroy 
it. Then, by cooling, and exposing to pure air again, it 
becomes aerated and palatable. But water for cooking, 
unless there are impurities to be removed, should be used 
when freshly boiled. This is especiall}' important in mak- 
ing tea and coflTee. 

Soft water should be used in boihng where the object is 
to soften the texture, and extract the soluble parts, as in 
soups, broths, tea, and coflfee. Hard water, or soft water 
salted, is better where we wish to preserve the articles 
whole, and retain the soluble and flavoring principles, as in 
most green vegetables. Beans or dried peas, which contain 
casein or vegetable albumen in large proportion, should be 
cooked in soft water, as the lime in hard water hardens the 
casein, and prevents the vegetables from becoming soft. 

In cooking meat, fish, and vegetables in water, we should 
remember these two facts : — 

Gold lOater draws out the albuminous juices, softens the 
fibres and gelatinous portions of meat, and holds them in 
solution. It draws out starch, but does not unite with it. 

Boiling water hardens and toughens albumen and fibrine, 
bursts the starch grains, and is absorbed by the swelling 
starch. 

Meat is cooked in water for three distinct purposes : — 

First. To keep the nutriment within the meat, as in 
what is usually called boiled meat. To do this, we leave the 
meat whole, that only a little surface may be exposed. 
Plunge it into boiling salted water, and keep it there for 
five or ten minutes ; this hardens the albumen over the 
entire surface, and makes a coating through which the juices 



Boiling Meat^ etc, i\ 



cannot escape. Then move the kettle where the water 
will simmer slowlj'. See that the cover fits tightl}-, to keep 
in the steam. The water should be salted to raise the 
boiling-point, and increase the density of the water, and 
thus prevent the escape of the juices. A small amount of 
the albumen in the outer surface will be dissolved and rise 
as scum. This should be removed, or it will settle on the 
meat and render it uninviting in appearance. If the meat 
be put in the kettle with the bones uppermost, then the scum 
will not settle on the meat. In turning the meat do not 
pierce into it to let the juices escape. It will take a longer 
time to cook in this way, but the fibrine will be softened, 
and the meat made more tender and of better flavor, than 
when kept boiling furiously. 

Second. Meats are cooked in water to have the nutri- 
ment wholly in the liquid^ as in soups and meat teas. Cut 
the meat in small pieces ; soak in cold water, the longer 
the better ; heat graduall}', and keep hot, but not boiling, 
until all the goodness is extracted. 

Third. Meats are cooked in water to have the nutri- 
ment partly in the liquid and partly in the meat., as in stews^ 
fricassees., etc. Put the meat in cold water, let the water 
boil quickl}', then skim, and keep at the simmering-point. 
The cold water will draw out enough of the juices to enrich 
the liquid ; then, as it reaches the boiling-point, the meat 
hardens, and retains the remainder. 

Fish is usually cooked in boiling water for the purpose 
of keeping the juices in the fish. As the flesh of fish 
breaks easily, the water should never be allowed to boil 
rapidl}'. Salmon, mackerel, or any ver}^ oily fish, should 
be put into cold water, and brought almost to the boiUng- 
point quickly, as they have a very strong, rich flavor. A 
little of this flavor can be lost without injury to the fish. 

Vegetables, which are mostly starch and water, should 
be put into boiUng water and boiled rapidly, that the small 
portions of albumen which they contain may be hardened 
on the surface ; then, if the starch grains are burst quicklj^ 
they will absorb the albuminous juices within. . 



12 The Boston Cook Book. 

Milk boils at 196°. Being thicker than water, less of 
the steam escapes, and the whole liquid becomes hot sooner 
than water. The bubbles rise rapidlj^, and, owing to their 
tenacity, do not burst at the surface, but climb over one 
another till they run over the edge of the pan. 

Milk, grains, custards, and any substances which, from 
their glutinous nature, would be liable to adhere to the 
kettle, are much more easily and safely cooked in a double 
boiler, or in a pail within a kettle of water. This is one 
form of steaming^ or cooking over boiling water. In steam- 
ing, the water should not stop boiling until the articles are 
cooked. This is a convenient form of cooking many arti- 
cles which it is troublesome to cook with a dr}- heat, and 
yet do not need the solvent powers of water. Watery 
vegetables are rendered drier by steaming ; and tough 
pieces of meat which cannot be roasted, are first made 
tender hy steaming, and then browned in the oven. Some- 
times meat is steamed in its own juices alone ; this is 
called smothering^ or pot-roasting . 

Stewing is another form of boiling or cooking in a small 
qnantit}^ of water, at a moderate heat, and for a long time. 
The word means a slow, moist, gentle heat. It is an eco- 
nomical mode of cooking, except where a fire has to be 
kept for this purpose alone. The long-continued action of 
a gentle heat softens the fibres ; and the coarsest and 
cheapest kinds of meat, cooked in this wa}', with vegeta- 
bles, ma}" be made tender and nutritious. B3' judicious use 
of seasoning material, remnants can be made into savory 
and nourishing dishes. Whether we call it simply a stew^ 
or ragout^ haricot^ or salmi^ the principle is the same, — 
that o^ slow, steady simmering, rather than fierce boiling. 

Fricasseeing (meaning "to fry") is a form pf stewing. 
The term is usuall}' applied to chicken, veal, or some small 
game, which is cut into pieces, and fried either before or 
after stewing, and served with a rich white or brown 
sauce, and without vegetables. Any meat that is quite 
juicy and not verj' tough mav be first browned on the out- 
side to keep in the juices, and improve the flavor. Coarse, 



Braising^ Baking. 



tough pieces sliould not be browned, but dipped in vinegar 
to soften the fibre ; and pieces containing much gristle 
should be put into cold water. 

Braising is a form of stewing done usuallj^ in a braising- 
pan or kettle which has coals in the cover. Any granite 
or iron pan with a close cover to keep in the steam will 
answer the purpose. When placed in the oven, where it 
is surrounded b}' a slow, uniform heat, it needs ver}- little 
attention. It is one of the most economical and satisfac- 
tor}' w^a3S of cooking large pieces of tough, lean meat, 
pigeons, liver, fowls, heart, etc. Stock, vegetables, and 
bacon may be used, if a rich liquor be required ; but water, 
herbs, and simple seasoning make it very palatable. 

Baking is hardening or cooking in a dr}' heat, as in a 
close oven. Nearly all flour mixtures — bread, pastry, and 
some forms of pudding — are more wholesome baked than 
when cooked in any other wa3\ Many forms of baking 
are really stewing : but the closely confined heat of the 
oven gives an entirel}^ different flavor from that obtained 
b}^ stewing over the fire. This is seen in the difference 
between stewed and baked apple-sauce, beans, etc. 

Meat and fish, if baked in the right wa}', lose less in 
weight than when boiled or roasted. To bake them prop- 
erly, the juices must be kept within the meat. An intense 
heat at first is necessar}' to harden the albumen ; then re- 
duce the heat, that the outside may not become too hard, 
and baste frequently to prevent drying. No water should 
be put in the pan at first, as it will then be impossible to 
have a greater heat than that of boiUng water (212°) , while 
for baking meat 280°, or more, is required. Put one or 
two tablespoonfuls of beef drippings, or some of the fat 
from the meat, in the pan, to use in basting, as the fat can 
be made much hotter than water. If the joint be very 
large, or the meat need thorough cooking, like poultr}', 
veal, or pork, water can be added to check the heat as 
soon as the outside is cooked sufficiently to keep in the 
juices. This will keep the meat moist. Small cuts, and 
meats to be eaten rare, are better baked with^ttU water. 



^^'C 



14 The Boston Cook Book, 

Man}' persons accustomed to meat roasted before the 
open fire object to the flavor of baked meat. If the oven 
be ver}^ hot at first, and opened every five minutes just 
long enough for the basting, which is an essential part of 
the cooking process, the smoky odor escapes. If there 
be no damper to check the heat underneath the oven, put 
the grate or another pan under the dripping-pan, as no 
heat is requii'ed under the meat. This will prevent the fat 
in the pan from burning and smoking the meat. Place 
the meat with the skin side down at first ; then, if the 
juices begin to flow, the skin keeps them in ; and, when 
turned, it brings the side which is to be up in serving 
next the hottest part of the oven, for the final browning. 
All baked meat or fish should be salted and floured all 
over. Salt draws out the juices ; but the flour unites with 
them, making a paste which soon hardens, and keeps them 
w^ithiu. Baste often, and dredge with salt and flour after 
basting. If there be no shelf attached to the stove near 
the oven, keep a box or frame of wood just the height of 
the oven, near by, and pushed up close to it; it will be 
found very convenient to pull the pan out upon it when 
basting or turning the meat. 

Frying. 

Frying is cooking in hot fat, — not hoiling fat, as it is so 
often called, for fat can be made much hotter than the 
temperature required for cooking, which is 385° ; the tem- 
perature for boiling fat is from 565° to 600°. Frying, 
when properl}' done, is immersion in smoking-hot fat. The 
fat should be deep enough to entirely cover the articles to 
be cooked ; and as it may be used many times, it is not so 
extravagant as some suppose to use such a quantit3^ The 
prime secret of nice frying is to have the fat hot enough 
to harden instantly the albumen on the outer surface, and 
thus prevent the fat from soaking into the inside of what- 
ever is to be fried. As a much higher temp'^rature is 
required than that for boiling or baking, the articles are 



Frying. 15 



very quicklj' cooked ; and the}' have a flavor quite unUke 
that given b}' an}' other form of cooking. 

All articles to be fried should be thoroughly dried and 
slightly warmed. If very moist, or very cold, or too many 
articles be fried at a time, the fat becomes chilled, and 
the grease soaks into them. Then, as the moisture heats 
and boils, it causes such a commotion that the fat and 
water boil over, and there is great danger from the fat 
taking fire and spreading to your clothing, to sa}' nothing 
of the trouble of cleaning the stove and floor. For this 
reason be careful not to let a drop of water, or of con- 
densed steam from another kettle, fall into the hot fat. 

Meat, fish, oysters, croquettes, etc., should be dried, 
and rolled in fine bread-crumbs, to absorb any moisture ; 
then rolled in beaten e^g, and in fine crumbs again. The 
hot fat hardens the albumen of the Qgg instantly ; and that, 
with the crumbs, makes a fat-proof crust. 

Fish balls, fritters, and fried muffin mixtures contain 
egg and albumen sufficient to keep them from soaking fat, 
if the fat be only hot enough. A Scotch bowl,, or deep 
iron or granite kettle, and a wire basket small enough to 
fit down into the kettle, are best to use in frying, 

TTie Test for Hot Fat. — When the fat begin? to smoke 
put in a bit of bread ; if it brown quickl}', or while jow 
can count sixty as the clock ticks, it is hot enough for 
fried potatoes, doughnuts, etc. When hot enough to 
brown the bread while you connl fort}', it will do for fish 
balls, croquettes, etc. 

When ready to fry, plunge the basket into the hot fat 
to grease it, and then place in it the croquettes, or what- 
ever you may be frying, so that they will not touch each 
other. Hold the handle of the basket with a long fork, 
and plunge it quickly into the fat, but do not drop the 
handle, because if the fat begin to boil up, you can then 
raise the basket quickly, and wait till the ebullition has 
subsided before plunging it in again ; and thus avoid 
the danger of burning from the overflowing fat. The fat 
cools rapidl}', when many articles are fried at once, and 



iO The Boston Cook Book. 

should be reheated to the test point before frying any 
more. 

Time. — Any cooked mixture, such as fish balls and cro- 
quettes, or very small fish, oysters, scallops, etc., will be 
fried brown in one minute. Thicker fish, chops, and frit- 
ters require longer cooking ; and, after plunging them into 
the hot fat, the kettle should be set back from the fire to 
prevent them from becoming too brown before they are 
sufficiently cooked. While fiying, be careful not to spill 
any fat on the stove. Keep a tin plate in your left hand, 
and hold it under the basket, or ladle, as you take things 
from the fat. 

Braining. — Thorough draining is another secret of nice 
frying, and 3'ou cannot find a much hotter place than right 
over the hot fat ; so hold your basket of fried food over the 
hot fat, and shake slightl}^, till all dripping has stopped. 
Then place the fried articles on soft or unglazed paper, to 
absorb the fat, and keep them hot till ready to serve, 
Never pile fried articles one on another. 

Fat for Frying. 

Lard, a mixture of half suet and half lard, drippings, or 
oil, may be used for frying. Suet and drippings are cheap- 
est, and are preferred by many. Suet used alone cools 
very quickly and leaves a tallowy taste. Drippings should 
be carefull}' clarified (se^ page 18) and freed from water, 
or the articles cooked will soak fat. Lard, with a small 
proportion of suet or drippings, is more generallj' satisfac- 
tor}'. There is often a very disagreeable odor to new lard, 
and more or less water in it, as is shown bj' the froth and 
ebuUition as soon as it becomes hot. Before it is used for 
any purpose it should be clarified with slices of raw potato 
and heated until it becomes still. Olive oil is the purest fat 
for frying, but it is too expensive for general use. Cotton- 
seed oil has been recently introduced for cooking purposes, 
and is an excellent fat for ftying, though jnany dislike its 
neculiar odor It may be heated much hotter than iardj

without burning, and, when properly used, imparts no 
flavor to the food. When the fat becomes too brown tor 
potatoes or doughnuts, use it for croquettes, etc., and then 
use it for nothing except fish balls and fish. When it be- 
comes very brown, put it with the soap-grease. 

If 3'ou wish to fty several kinds at the same time, begin 
with potatoes, following with doughnuts or flour mixtures, 
and crumbed articles last ; otherwise the crumbs will fall 
off, and adhere to whatever is put in subsequently. After 
every ftying, strain the fat through a fine wire strainer or 
fine strainer cloth into a tin pail, not pouring it, but dip- 
ping it from the kettle with a small long-handled dipper. 
Let it cool slightly before straining, as, if very hot, it will 
melt the strainer. Sprinkle coflTee on the stove, while fty- 
ing, to disguise the odor. 

Sauteing. 

The ordinar}' way of ftying in a shallow pan with only a 
little fat, first on one side and then on the other, which the 
French call sauteing, answers ver}" well for some purposes, 
— omelets, fried cakes, and many things browned in butter ; 
but nearly everything that requires an}^ more fat than just 
enough to keep it from sticking, is much better immersed 
in hot fat. Fish balls, chops, and 03'sters are more quickly 
cooked, and absorb less fat, when fried b}' immersion than 
when sauted. Some people are extremel}^ unwilling to 
make the change, and persist in going on in the old way 
of cooking in a little, half-hot fat which spatters over 
stove and floor, soaks into the fish or meat, and is often 
served as the only grsLvy. Upon such, dyspepsia is a fell 
avenger. 

These directions for frying are given thus minutely not 
from any desire to recommend this method of cooking ; 
but, if people will fiy their food, the}' should do it in the 
only correct wa}'. With the exception of salt-fish balls 
and small, dry, white fish, there is nothing fried, even in

the right wa}', that would not be equally good, and much 
more conducive to health, were it cooked otherwise. Sar- 
atoga potatoes, or chips as the}' are called, are reall}' chips, 
for persons with weak digestion. 03'sters, chops, fritters, 
and the materials in croquettes, muffins, and doughnuts 
may be cooked in many better wass. 

Frying answers very well for open-air cooking, on the 
seashore or in camp, where appetite and digestion are 
strengthened. But in most modern houses, where the 
odors from the kitchen penetrate the remotest nook and 
corner, there are many serious objections, apart from the 
indigestibilit\' of the food thus prepared. The acrid odors 
given off during the heating of fat are verj^ irritating to 
the toucous membrane of the nose and throat, and they are 
equall}' so to a sensitive stomach. Some persons who can. 
usuallj' digest fried food cannot do so when the stomach 
has been irritated b}' the odor in frying. If all those who 
are so fond of croquettes, fritters, etc., were ol^liged to 
inhale the smoking fat, these dishes would seldom appear 
on the table. 

To clarify Fat. 

An}' uncooked fat, such as suet, the fat from chickens, 
and all superfluous beef fat, should be saved and clarified, 
or made pure and clear. Cut the fat into small pieces, 
cover with cold water, and cook over a slow fire until the 
fat has melted, and the water nearl}' all evaporated. Then 
strain and press all the fat from the scraps. When cool, 
remove the cake of hard fat, or, if soft, draw it to one side 
and let the water underneath run off. You ma}' put with 
the new fat any fat from soup stock, corned beef, drippings 
from roast beef, veal, fresh pork, or chicken ; in fact, any- 
thing except the fat from mutton, turkey, and smoked 
meat. If tliere be any sediment adhering to the fat, add 
a little very cold water, and, after stirring well, pour the 
water off, or skim the fat from the water. Place the fat 
in a pan over the fire, and, when melted, add one small 
raw potato, cut into thin slices. Let it stand on the top 



Egg and Bread Crumbing. 19 

of the stove or in the oven till the fat has stopped bub- 
bling, is still, and the scraps are brown and crisp and 
rise to the top. Strain through a fine strainer, and keep 
in a cool place. Fat thus cleared will keep sweet for 
weeks, if melted occasionally, which should always be 
done when any new fat is added. 

Boiling the fat causes the water in it to evaporate, and 
the organic matters or impurities to be decomposed, and 
deposited as sediment ; the potato, owing to its porosity 
and power of absorption (being mostly starch and car- 
bon), absorbs any odors or gases, collects the sediment, 
and thus cleanses the fat, very much as charcoal purifies 
water. Clarified fat (or dripping, as it is usually termed) 
answers for many purposes in cooking, — frying, saute- 
ing, basting roast meat, greasing pans ; and as shorten- 
ing for bread, plain pastry, and gingerbread. 

Egg and Bread Crumbing. 

Hints on saving bread crusts and stale pieces, for egg 
and bread crumbing, are given on page 75. The crumbs 
should be sifted through a fine sieve. For fish or meat 
mix a little salt, pepper, and chopped parsley- with them. 
Beat the eggs slightly with a fork in a shallow dish. Add 
one tablespoonful of water or two tablespoonfuls of milk 
for each ^gg. Add a little sugar if they are to be used for 
sweet dishes, and salt and pepper for all others. Sprinkle 
the crumbs on a board, and roll the chop, fish, or cro- 
quettes first in the crumbs ; shake off all that do not adhere. 
Cover all the articles with the crumbs and let them stand 
till drj^, then dip into the beaten egg^ and be careful to 
have ever}' part covered. Drain from the egg^ and roll 
again in the crumbs. Croquettes or any soft mixture 
should be held on a broad knife while being placed in the

Roasting. 

Roasting (meaning " to heat violently" ) is cooking be- 
fore an open fire ; it implies the action of a much greater 
degree of heat than that employed in any of the previously 
specified methods of cooking. The heat of an open fire is 
about 1,000^ 

In the days of open fireplaces this was the general way 
of cooking large pieces of meat ; but now it is adopted 
onl}^ in large establishments, or by those who can afford 
the additional expense of a tin kitchen, and a range con- 
structed especiall}- for roasting. Baking, or roasting in a 
very hot oven, being a cheaper and more convenient way, 
is more general^ used. Ovens in stoves and ranges are 
now well ventilated ; and meat when properly cooked in a 
ver}' hot oven, and basted often, is nearl}- equal in flavor 
to that roasted before an open fii-e. The fire for roasting 
should be clear and bright, and of suflftcient body to last, 
with onh' a slight sprinkhng of coal, through the time for 
roasting. 

The meat is placed on a spit, and hung in the jack in a 
tin kitchen, and made to revolve slowly before the fire by 
winding a spring in the jack, or bj^ turning the spit at 
regular intervals. The meat should be rubbed with salt 
and flour, and placed on the spit, ver}- near the fire at 
first, to harden the albumen ; then removed a little dis- 
tance to prevent the meat from burning, before the inside 
is cooked. Place two or three spoonfuls of dripping in 
the pan to use in basting the meat ; baste often, and 
dredge two or three times with flour. When the joint is 
ver}^ large, place a buttered paper over it. 

As the juices of meat are composed largely of water, 
the water will be evaporated as soon as it reaches the 
boiling-point, or 212°. When meat is placed in a moder- 
ate oven, the heat is not suflic' "ot to harden the '"^^^nmen 



Broiling. 21 



on the outer surface ; the watery juices evaporate, the 
steam escapes, and the meat becomes dry and tasteless. 
But when meat is exposed to the intense heat of an open 
fire, or a ver\' hot oven, the albumen hardens ; and if 
basted frequentlj' with hot fat, the meat is completely en- 
veloped in a varnish of hot melted fat, which assists in 
communicating the heat to the inside, and checks the 
evaporation of the juices ; this prevents the escape of the 
steam, so that the inside of propcily roasted meat is 
really cooked in the steam of its owni juices. The evapo 
ration of juices is proportionate to the amount of surface 
exposed. A small joint has a larger surface in proportion 
to its w^eight than a large joint w'eighing double or treble 
the amount ; therefore the smaller the joint to be roasted, 
the higher the temperature to which its surface should be ex- 
posed, that the evaporation may be more quickly' arrested. 
For very thin pieces of meat, which have a still larger 
surface in proportion to the weight, such as steaks and 
chops, a greater heat is required. This is accomplished 
b}' broiling^ which should be done near the burning- 
point, the highest degree of heat employed in any form of 
cooking. 

Broiling. 

Broiling (meaning " to burn" ) is cooking directly over 
the hot coals. The degree of heat is so intense that the 
articles to be cooked would be very quickly burned, were 
they allowx^d to remain for any length of time over the fire. 
The secret of nice broiling is frequent turning. The fire 
should be bright red, and nearly to the top of the fire-box, 
so that the broiler may almost touch the fire. There 
should be no flame, as the flame from coal is due to the 
combustion of tarr}' vapors, and will cause a deposit of 
coal tar on the meat, giving it a smok}', nauseating flavor. 
When the fat from the chop or steak drips on the coals 
and blazes, it deposits a film of mutton or beef fat all 
over the meat, which has a very difl^erent flavor from that 
of the coal flame. When the steak has much fat, remove 



22 The Boston Cook Book, 

part of it. A little fat will improve the flavor, baste 
the meat, and keep it from becoming too cby. The 
oven damper should always be opened while broiling, 
that the smoke of the dripping fat ma^^ be carried into the 
chimne}'. 

There is nothing better for broiling than a double wive 
broiler. It is well to have several sizes. Grease it wxll 
with a bit of the fat from the hieat, or with salt-pork rind. 
Place the thickest part of whatever is to be broiled next 
the middle of the broiler. Do not salt the meat, as salt 
draws out the juice. Have the platter heating, and every- 
thing else read}-, that you may not leave the broihng for 
an instant. Hold the broiler firmly, with a coarse towel 
wrapped around 3'our hand to protect it from the heat. 
Place it as near the fire as possible, to sear the outside 
instantly ; count ten, then sear the other side. The heat 
hardens the outside, and starts the flow of the juices. 
Thej- cannot escape through the hardened outer surface ; 
but if the meat were cooked whoU}' on one side before 
turning, the}- would soon come to the top, and then, in 
turning the meat, the juices would drip into the fire. But 
if the meat be turned before the juices reach the top, the 
other surface is hardened, and the}' cannot escape, but flow 
to the centre, and are there retained. As the juices are 
converted into steam by the heat, they swell and give the 
meat a puff}- appearance. If the broiling be carried on 
too long, these juices gradually ooze between the fibres 
to the surface, and are evaporated ; and the meat becomes 
.Iry, leathery, and indigestible. 

Meat should be broiled only long enough to loosen all 
the fibres, and start the flow of the juices. The meat will 
spring up instantly when pressed with the knife ; and when 
it ceases to do this, the juices have begun to evaporate, 
and the meat shrinks. A little experience will enable one 
to decide just when to remove the meat. Do not cut into 
it, as this lets out the juices. It should be pink and juicy, 
not raw and purple, nor brown and dry. Turn over as 
often as you can count ten, and cook four minutes, if 



Broiling. 23 



one inch thick; six, if one inch and a half thick. Tlie 
smaller and thinner the article, the hotter should be the 
fire ; the larger the article, the more temperate the fire, 
or the greater the distance from the fire. 

Fish should be floured to keep the skin from sticking. 
A large baking- pan to keep in the heat should be laid 
over the fish if thick, or it may be first partly cooked in 
the oven. 

Chickens, to be thoroughly broiled but not burned or 
dried, require about twent}^ minutes. A safe way is to 
wrap them in buttered glazed paper ; cook the inner side 
first, and after the first searing keep them farther from 
the fire, or cook them first in the oven. 

Chops, bacon, birds, and dr3' fish are also improved by 
broiling in the buttered paper. Take a large sheet of 
white letter paper, or two small sheets. Rub them well 
with softened butter. This keeps out the air. Season the 
chop or fish with salt and pepper, place it near the centre 
of the paper, and fold the edges of the paper over several 
times and pinch them together close to the meat. The 
paper will char a long time before blazing, if care be taken 
not to break through the paper and thus let in the air and 
let out all the fat. The meat will be basted with its own 
fat and juices. A longer time will be required for the 
broiling ; but when the paper is well browned, the chop will 
be done. It will be found juicj^ and delicious, — ^ free 
from an}' smok}' flavor. 

Pan-hroiling is broiling in a hissing hot spider or ftying- 
pan. Heat the pan to a blue heat. Kub it with a bit of 
the beef fat, just enough to keep the meat from sticking, 
but do not leave an}' fat in the pan. Sear the meat quickl}'' 
on one side, then turn without cutting into the meat, and 
brown the other side before an}' juice escapes into the 
pan. Cook about four minutes, turning twice, and serve 
very hot with salt and butter. If the pan be hot enough 
and no fat used, this is i^ot frying, it is hroiling on hot 
iron-, and the flavor is almost equal to broiling over the 
eoals.

Larding. 

Man}' kinds of meat which are very lean and dry are 
improved by the addition of some kind of fat. The tender- 
loin or fillet of beef, the thick part of the leg of veal, grouse, 
and liver, are often prepared in this wa^'. 

Larding is drawing small strips of fat salt pork or bacon 
through the surface of the meat ; daubing is forcing strips 
of pork through the entire thickness of the meat. Take a 
piece of fat salt pork two inches wide and four inches 
long. Shave off' the rind the long wa}^ of the pork ; then 
cut two or three slices about a quarter of an inch thick, 
the same wa}' as the rind ; cut only to the membrane which 
lies about an inch below the rind, as this is the firmc^st 
part of the pork ; then cut each slice across the width, into 
strips one quarter of an inch thick. This will make the 
lardoons one quarter of an inch wide and thick and two 
inches long. Insert one end of the lardoon into the end 
of the larding-needle, then with the point of the needle 
take up a stitch half an inch deep and one inch wide in 
the surface of the meat. Draw the needle through, and 
help the pork to go through by |)ushing until partly through, 
then hold the end of the pork and draw the needle out, 
leaving the pork in the meat, with the ends projecting 
at equal lengths. Take up more stitches one inch apart 
in parallel or alternate rows, until the whole surface is 
covered. 

Dauhing is applied to a broad, thick piece of beef or 
veal. Cut the pork in strips one third of an inch wide and 
thick, and as long as the meat is thick. Punch a hole 
clear throuorh the meat with a steel, and then insert the

lardoon with a large lardiug-needle or with the fingers. 
The salt aud fat from the lardoon s penetrate the inside of 
the meat, and by many are considered an improvement. 
Those who object to the pork will find that beef ma}' be 
seasoned as well b}^ covering the surface with nice beef 
suet, salted ; or the pork ma}' be laid on the meat and 
removed after cooking. The process is not difficult, re- 
quiring no more skill than au}' other kind of sewing. 

Boning. 

An}^ one who can use a sharp knife, and scrape meat or 
fish from a bone, without cutting her own flesh, can bone 
anj'thing, from the smallest ])ird, chop, or fish, to a leg or 
forequarter of lamb, or a turkey. A small knife with a 
sharp, short, pointed blade, is all that is required. It is 
well to begin on a small scale by removing the bone from 
a chop or steak. The aim is to remove the flesh from the 
bone without cutting into the flesh, or destroying its shape 
more than is necessar}'. 

To Bone a Chop or Steak. — Begin at the bone end, scrape 
the meat awa}', leaving the bone clean and the flesh un- 
broken. If there be a piece of tenderloin under the bone, 
remove it, and put it up close to the meat, which was 
above the bone in the original form. 

Directions for boning fish are given on page 161. 

To Bone a Leg of Mutton. — Qnt it off" at- the first joint, 
insert the knife near the joint, and loosen tlie flesh from 
the bone, leaving all the gristle and tendons on the bone. 
Then begin at the tail end, and scrape the fat away from 
the backbone, then follow the bone (you can easih' tell by 
the feeling, if you cannot see it) until you come to the 
joint ; leave all the gristle and cords on the bone, and con- 
tinue scraping oflT the flesh till the whole bone is out. One 
could easil}' cut through ^rom the outside to the bone and 
remove it in that wa}' ; but the flesh would have to be 
sewed together, and much of the juice would escape. 
After removing the bone, stuflT the cavity left b}^ the bone, 



Boning. 27 

and sew the skin together at the smaller end. Then bring 
the edges together at the upper end, crowding all the flesh 
inside, and sew the skin together tightly*. Tliis gives a 
rectangular form of solid meat and stuffing. When salted 
and floured and exposed to a hot oven, the juices are kept 
inside ; the meat is more conveniently served, and, when 
cold, does not become dry and hard. 

An}' other pieces of meat are boned in a similar manner. 

2^0 Bone a Bird, Fowl, or Turkey. — In this case the 
flesh is to be kept in the skin in order to preserve the 
shape. The skin should be firm and unbroken, and 
the bird should not be drawn. Remove the head and pin- 
feathers, singe and wipe carefull}'. Remove the tendons 
from the legs, and loosen the skin round the end of the 
drumstick. Make an incision through the skin from the 
neck to the middle of the back, or near the junction of 
the side bone. Scrape the flesh with the skin away from 
the backbone imtil you feel the end of the shoulder-blade ; 
loosen the flesh from this, and then follow the bone to the 
wing joint, and down to the middle joint in the wing. 
The skin lies very near the bone underneath the joint, 
and care must be taken to avoid cutting through the skin 
at these places. Leave the first bone in the wing to aid 
in keeping the shape ; it ma}' be removed before serving. 
In small birds there is so little meat on the wings, that 
it is just as well to cut them off at the middle joint. Re- 
move the bone from the other wing in the same wa}', then 
follow the collar bone from the wing down to the breast- 
bone, loosening the crop from the flesh. In removing the 
flesh lYom the breastbone, be careful not to cut through 
the skin on the ridge. The flesh may be pushed awa}' 
with the fingers, and the fillets or pieces that are detached 
from the other flesh can be laid aside, and put in place 
afterwards. When the breastbone is bare, separate the 
flesh from the ribs, and be careful not to break through 
the membrane into the inside. Remove the flesh round 
the second joint, then the drumsticks, turning the flesh 
wrong side out as in pulling a glove from the finger. 



^<D' 



UX 



2S The Boston Cook Book, 

Repeat this process on the other side. Then scrape down 
to the end of the backbone, and cut through the bone, 
leaving a part of it in the tail. Separate the membrane 
under the body without breaking. Thus 3'ou have the 
flesh in the skin, and the skeleton left entire with the con- 
tents undisturbed in the inside. La}' the stuffing in, filling 
out the legs and wings, then sew the skin along the back^ 
and skewer or tie into the original shape. 

An easier wa}' of boning a fowl where it is to be rolled 
like a galantine^ is to cut off the wings at the second joint, 
break the drumstick half-way from the joint, cut the skin 
down the entire length of the back, remove the flesh from 
the wing and second joint, turning the skin and flesh ofl 
like a glove ; then do the same on the other wing and leg, 
leaving the breast till the last. The wings and legs are 
turned inside, the stuffing is laid in the flesh, and the 
whole rolled over and over, and sewed on the edge of tlie 
skin and at the ends of the roll. 

Measmlng. 

It has been said that ' ' good cooks never measure any- 
thing." Thej' do. The}' measure by judgment and ex- 
perience ; and until you have a large share of both these 
essential qualities, use 3'our spoon and cup or scales. 

Measures, in preference to weights, are used in nearb 
all these receipts, as the}' are more convenient for the ma- 
jority of housekeepers. When measured and estimated by 
the Table of Weights and Measures on page 30, the cup 
and spoon may be used as accurately as the scales. 

Flour, meal, sugar, salt, spices, and soda should al- 
ways be sifted before measuring. Any other materials 
that have been packed, like mustard and baking powder, 
if not sifted, should be stirred, and broken up lightly. 
One tablespoonful of solid mustard taken carelessly from 
the box has been found equal to three tablespoonfuls 
measured after sifting. 

The saltspoons, teaspoons, and tablespoons used in these 
receipts are the silver spoons now in general use. Iron 



Measuring. 29 



mixing-spoons vary much in size, but there is a size 
which holds exactly the same as a silver tablespoon. Be 
careful to use this size in measuring. The cup is the 
common kitchen cup holding half a pint Those with 
handles are more convenient. 

To measure a rounded teaspoonful of dry material, dip 
into the sifted material, and take up a heaping spoonful, 
shake it slightly until it is just rounded over, or convex 
in the same proportion as the spoon is concave. A level 
teaspoonfid means the spoon filled lightly, and levelled off 
with a knife. One half teaspoonful is most accurately 
measured by dividing through the middle lengthwise. 
When divided across the width the tip is smaller than the 
lower half. A heaping teaspoonful is all the spoon \fill 
hold of an}' lightly sifted material. A teaspoonful of liquid 
is the spoon full to the brim. 

Tahlespoonfuls are measured in the same waj'. 

A cupful of dry material should be filled and heaped 
hghtly (not shaken down), then levelled off even with the 
top. A small scoop should be kept in the flour or sugar 
to use in filling the cup. A heaping cupful is all the cup will 
hold. A cupful of liquid is not what 3'ou can carrj" without 
spiUing, but what the cup will hold without running over ; 
full to the brim. Place 3'our cup in a saucer, while filling 
it, or in the bowl in which the hquid is to be poured. 
Half a cupful is not half the distance from the bottom to 
the rim. Most cups are smaller at the bottom, for which 
allowance must be made. Take two cups of the same 
size and shape, fill one with water, then pour the water 
without spilling into the other cup until it stands at the 
same level in both cups. This gives 3'ou the half-cupful 
exactly, which in the cups used here is two thirds of the 
height, or within an inch of the top. The quarter and 
three-quarter measures ma}' be found in the same way. A 
scant cupful is within a quarter of an inch of the top. 

^''Butter the size of an egg^' is a very common expression. 
This equals about one quarter of a cupful, or two ounces, 
or one heaping tablespoonful, either of which is more easily 



30 The Boston Cook Book, 

written than the first expression. Place an egg in one 
tablespoon, then pack butter in another till it fills the 
spoon in the same proportion as the egg, and 3'ou will 
easil}' carr}^ it in mind. 

Have 3'our materials measured or at hand, and all uten- 
sils ready before beginning the mixing, or putting the 
ingredients together. Keep a bucket or pan full of flour, 
freshl}^ sifted each da}', and read}' for use. Measure flour 
first, and put it in a bowl or pan together with salt, soda, 
cream of tartar, and spice ; measure butter and put it in 
the mixing-bowl ; then measure the sugar, and, in scraping 
out the sugar, take the butter which has adhered to the 
cup. Break 3'our eggs on the edge of the cup ; if the white 
be clear, the egg is good. Put the 3'olks in one bowl and 
the whites in another ; measure the milk or liquid, and, 
after using the beaten 3'olk, clean out the bowl with the 
milk. Or, measure all the dr}' ingredients, break and sep- 
arate the eggs, measure the milk, add it to the beaten 
yolks, and measure the melted butter last. In either way 
you can make one cup do for all without washing. "Two 
eggs beaten separately " means that the 3'olks and whites 
are to be beaten separatel}', not each whole egg beaten 
separatel3\ 

A tablespoonful of melted butter is measured after melt- 
ing. A tablespocnful of butter melted is measured before 
melting. 

To economize space, in man3' of the receipts the abbre- 
viations are written : one cup for one cupful, tablesp. for 
tablespoonful, teasp. for teaspoonful, and saltsp. for salt- 
spoonful. All these measures mean a full measure, unless 
scant or heaping measures are specified.

Next to care in measuring comes the manner of mixing. 
The most accurate measurement of the best materials is 
often rendered useless by a neglect to put them together 
properly, and the blame is usuall}- charged to the oven or 
the receipt. There are three distinct ways of mixing: 
Stirring^ Beating^ and Cutting or Folding. 

Stirring. — Let the bowl of the spoon rest slightly on 
the bottom of the mixing-bowl ; then move round and 
jrpuud in widening circles, without lifting the spoon out of 



Mixing. 33 



the mixture, except to scrape the sides of the bowl occa- 
sionally. Stir slowly at first, to avoid spattering ; add the 
liquid g'raduall}', and be sure the bowl of the spoon (not 
the edge nor the tip merel}') touches the bottom and sides 
of the bowl. This is mashing as well as stirring, and the 
mixture soon becomes a paste. When perfectl}^ smooth 
and free from lumps, add more liquid till 3'ou have the 
desired consistenc3^ We stir flour and water together for 
a thickening, or butter and flour and milk for a sauce. 
We stir when we rub butter to a cream, or when we make 
a batter or semi-dough. When we make a stiff* dough we 
stir at first, and then turn the whole ma:ss over, bringing 
the knife or spoon round the bowl and cutting up through 
the dough. 

Beatinij. — Tip the bowl slightly, and hold the spoon so 
that the edge scrapes the bowl, and bring it up through 
the mixture and over with a long quick stroke to the 
opposite side; under, and up through again, lifting the 
6poon*out of the mass and cutting clear through, scrap- 
ing from the bottom at every stroke. Keep the bowl of 
the spoon and the sides of the mixing-bowl well scraped 
out, that all the ma,teria,l may be equally beaten. 

We stir simply to "blend two or more materials ; we 
heat to add all the air possible to the mixture. We 
beat eggs or battier or soft dough. The albumen of the 
eggs and the gluten of the flour, owing to their viscidity or 
glutinous properties, catch the air and hold it in the form 
of cells, something as we make soap bubbles by blowing 
air into soapy water. The faster we beat, and the more 
we bring the material up from the bowl into the air, the 
more bubbles we have ; but one stirring motion will de- 
stroy them. Yolks of eggs should be beaten nearly as 
much as the whites, or till they are hght or lemon-colored, 
and thicken perceptibly. The whites should be beaten till 
they are stiff" and dry, or fly off* in flakes, or can be turned 
upside down without spiUing. When the two are to be 
put together, always plan to turn the whites into the yolks, 
as there is less waste than when the yolks are turned into 



34 The Boston Cook Book, 

the whites. Let the whites stiind a minute, then run a 
palette knife round the edge close to the bowl ; they will 
slip out easil}', and leave the bowl almost clean. For 
beating eggs, for nearl}' all purposes the Dover egg-beater 
is the i3est. There should be two sizes, the larger one for 
the whites of eggs. Hold the beater lightly in the left 
hand, and move it round through the ^g while turning 
the handle. For frosting, and snow pudding, and all beat- 
ing of soft dough, use a perforated wooden spoon. Bowls 
with slighth' flaring sides, and not too deep to be clasped 
from bottom to rim in the left hand, are most convenient. 
If tipped slightly toward the right, the beating is done 
more effectuallj'. 

Cutting, or Folding, or Lifting. — Omelets, sponge cake, 
whipped cream, etc., should have the beaten white cut or 
folded in careful!}^ to avoid breaking the air bubbles. Turn 
the mixture over with the spoon, cut through, lift up, and 
fold the materials together, lifting the part from below, up 
and over, and mixing very gently until just blended. Do 
not stir round and round, nor beat quickh\ 

All mixtures which are raised with eggs alone, should 
have the 3'olks and whites of the eggs thoroughly and 
separately beaten ; any very thin batter, like pop-overs, 
pancakes, or gems made without eggs, should be beaten 
vigorously just before baking. And many persons are 
most successful when all the beating of the eggs is done 
in the batter. 

Graham or whole-wheat flour is better than white flour 
.for gems that are made without eggs, because it contains 
more gluten. 

Shall we stir only one way? No; stir any way you 
please, so long as you blend or mix the materials. But 
after heating in air bubbles, don't break them by stirring^ 
unless you wish to keep up the game of cross purposes 
indefinitely. Always let the last motion, before turning 
into the pans, be one of quick, vigorous beating, except 
in those receipts where folding instead of beating is 
indicated.

BREAD AND BREAD MAKING. 

Importance of Bread. — Bread is one of the earliest, the 
most general!}^ used, aud the most important forms of 
food adopted b}- mankind. Nothing in the whole range 
of domestic life more affects the health and happiness of 
the family than the quality of its daily bread. With good 
bread, the plainest meal is a feast in itself ; without it, the 
most elaboratel}' prepared and elegantly served menu is 
unsatisfactory. 

Bread-making is at once the easiest and the most difficult 
branch of culinary science, — eas}', if onl}^ sufficient inter- 
est be taken to master a few elementary principles and 
to follow them always, using the judgment of the best 
authorities, until experience furnishes a sufficient guide ; 
difficult, if there be any neglect to use proper care and 
materials. It should be regarded as one of the highest 
accomplishments ; and if one tenth part of the interest, 
time, and thought which are devoted to cake and pastry 
and fancy cooking were spent upon this most important 
article of food, the presence of good bread upon our tables 
would be Invariabl}' secured. 

Origin and Meaning of'-'' Breads — Bread is made from a 
variety of substances, — roots, fruits, and the bark of trees ; 
but more generally from certain grains. The word bread 
is derived from the verb to bray., or pound., expressive of the 
old method of preparing the grain. Bread is therefore 
made of something braj-ed, as braced wheat or bra^'ed 
corn. But these bra3-ed or ground materials are not prop- 
erl}^ bread until they are mixed or moistened with water. 
Then the bra3'ed grain becomes dough., from a word mean- 
ing to wet, or moisten. In primitive times this wetted 
meal or dough was baked at once in hot ashes, and made 



Wheat. 37 



a firm, compact bread, exceedingh' hard of digestion. 
Accidentally some one discovered that by letting the dough 
stand till it had fermented, and then mixing it with new 
dough, it raised, or lifted, the whole mass, and made it 
lighter and more porous. Thus we have our word loaf, 
from lifian, to raise, or lift up. The old dough — or leaven, 
as it is called — lifts up the dough. The raised mL^s is held 
in place by the heat in baking, and becomes the loaf of 
raised bread. 

Bread made from Wheat. — Bread is made principally from 
wheat fiour. Rye and corn meal are sometimes used, but 
better results are obtained when there is a mixture of wheat 
with one or more of these grains. Rye used alone makes 
a close, moist, sticky bread ; while corn meal alone makes 
too diy and crumbly a loaf. 

Wheat is an annual grass of unknown origin, cultivated 
more extensively in the Northern hemisphere. There are 
over one hundred and fifty varieties of wheat- They are 
classified as red or white, in reference to the color of the 
grains; as winter or summer, — winter wheat being sown 
in the autumn, and summer wheat in the spring , as soft 
or hard, — soft wheat being tender and flouiy or starch}^ 
and hard wheat being tough, firm, and containing more 
gluten. 

Chemical Composition of Wheat. — Wheat is the on!}' gram 
which contains gluten in the proper proportion and of the 
desired qualitv essential to 
the making of light, spong}^ 
bread. It contains all the 
elements necessaiy for the 
growth of the body ; but, to 
meet all the requirements of 
nutrition, the whole of the 
grain, with the exception of ^ , ^ . , , , , .

used. Wheat has several 

layers of bran coats, the outer one of which is almost wholly 

pure silica and is perfectly indigestible. Underneath this

husk lie the inner bran coats, containing gluten, a dark sub- 
stance which is the nitrogenous or flesh- forming element, 

the phosphates and other min- 
era/ matters which help to 
make up the bony parts of 
the bod}', and the oil which 
gives the characteristic odor 
to wheat grains. The ceu' 
tre, or heart, of the grain 
consists of cells filled with 
starch, a fine, white, mealy 
powder, which has little value as food except as a heat 
producer. There is also a small amount of gluten dif- 
fused among the starch cells. For convenience, these dif- 
ferent parts of the wheat will be designated as bran, or 
the outer husk ; gluten, or 
the inner -bran coats ; and 
starch, or the heart of the 
wheat. The proportion and 
quality of the gluten and 
starch in different kinds of 
wheat vary according to the 
climate and soil in which 
they are grown. Thej' are 
also affected by the method 
of grinding the grain. Wheat grown in Southern or warm 
chmates, and in the intense, though short, summer of our 
own Northwest, contains more nitrogen than that grown in 
cold, damp climates. It loses more water b}' evaporation, 
and consequently the seed is smaller and harder. In some 
varieties of wheat the outer husk is thin and smooth, and 
peels off readil}' under the stones. In others, it is thick 
and rough, and adheres closel}' to the kernel. In some, it 
is light-colored or brittle , in others, dark-colored or tough. 
The husky portion of wheat is about fourteen or sixteen 
per cent of the whole weight. 

The gluten of wheat is a gray, tough, elastic substance, 
consisting chiefly of vegetable fibrine. It can be examined 




c^y^e^BiaaetSS[»

easily by making a dough of flour and water, and working 
it on a sieve under a stream of water. The water will 
carry the starch, sugar, gum, and mineral matters into the 
pan below, leaving a lump of gluten on the sieve. It 
closely resembles a piece of animal skin, and, when dried, 
has a glue-like appearance ; hence its name, gluten. The 
proportion of gluten varies from eleven to fifteen per cent. 
This tough, elastic qualit3' of the gluten determines the 
quality of the flour. The more gluten and the tougher or 
stronger it is, the better the flour. The gluten of good 
flour will swell to four or five times its original bulk ; w^hile 
that of poor flour does not swell, but becomes water}' and 
stick}', and sometimes gives off* a disagreeable odor, owing 

to the deterioration ot the fatty or oily element. 

r 

Preparing the Flour. 

St. Louis Process. — There are several methods of con- 
verting wheat into flour. One is by grinding between two 
horizontal stones, the upper one revolving, and the lower 
one stationary. The surface of the stones presents an 
infinite number of minute cutting edges. The upper stone 
IS convex, the lower one concave ; but instead of fitting 
perfectly, they approacli closer together from the centre 
outward, so that, as the grain is poured into an opening in 
the upper stone, it is at first rather coarsely crushed, and 
then cut finer and finer, as it is carried to the circumfer- 
ence by the centrifugal force. As the grain leaves the 
stones, the outer husk has been least affected ; the tough, 
coherent gluten is divided minutely, while the brittle starch, 
which forms two thirds of the grain, is completely crushed. 
The miller then divides these products, by sifting or bolt- 
ing, into ^ne^oi^r, coarse Jloui', and bran. 

The bra7i should be discarded as utterly useless for 
human food ; but it is often mixed with an inferior quality 
of fine flour, and sold as Graham flour. It was at one 
time considered valuable as a food for those suffering 
from constipation, chiefly on account of its coarseness ; but 



^ 



40 The Boston Cook Book. 

scieDce has shown us receutl}' that minute points of glass 
(and bran is nothing else) are not Nature's best agents in 
removing effete matters from the S3'stem. All of the so- 
called Graham flour made by this process should be sifted 
before using. 

The coarse flour will vary in quality, according as it has 
more or less of the outer bran mixed with it. In the soft 
wheats the husk peels off readil}' under the stones, and is 
easily separated b}' bolting ; and as these soft varieties 
contain the smallest proportion of gluten, the}' yield a coarse 
flour, containing only an average amount of gluten, and 
the whitest flne flour. But in the hard^i fl^'^iy wheats, this 
outer husk clings so closely that much of it is ground up 
finely with the flour, giving it a dark color. This flour, as 
it contains a large proportion of gluten, would be more 
nutritious were it not that much of the gluten adheres to 
the hulls, and is lost by sifting them out, and much of the 
fine, flint}' bran is retained in the flour, which makes it 
irritating and indigestible. 

The quality of the flne flour depends upon the quality of 
the wheat, in the first place ; also upon the number of sift- 
ings, being richer in gluten the less it is sifted ; and upon 
the way in which it is stored. The process of grinding 
with the stones heats the flour ; and as it is often thrust 
upon the market without being properly cooled and dried, 
it spoils very rapidly. Flour made by this process of 
grinding is called the St. Louis, or old-process flour. When 
made of the very best quality of grain and carefully pre- 
pared, it makes a sweet, nutritious bread, and is excellent 
in cake and pastry. It is often designated pastry flour. 

Haxall Process. — Another method of making flour is 
by the new, or Haxall process, so called from the name of 
the inventor. By this process the outer husk is first re- 
moved, or decorticated ; then the cleaned grain is cut by a 
system of knives, which reduces it to a fine powder with- 
out the injurious effects of heating. This flour has a 
slightly granular consistency, owing to the presence of 
minute particles of hard, flinty cluten. It is usuaUy made 



Flour. 41 



from the best quality of wheat, and keeps well. It is con- 
sidered by man}' as the best flour for bread, as it makes a 
whiter, nicer-looking loaf. Haxall flour swells more than 
that made b}' the old process, as it contains more of the 
gluten ; the same measure making a greater quantity of 
bread than the St. Louis flour. It is, therefore, cheaper 
in the end, though costing more per barrel. By repeated 
siftings, this flour loses its gluten, as does that made by 
the St. Louis process, and consequently is then inferior as 
a food. But we can supply b}' other flours and other food 
what this flour lacks in nutritious qualities ; and until the 
popular taste is educated to demand the amount of nutri- 
ment contained in bread rather than the whiteness of it, as 
a test of its qualit}^ it is well to make our fine, white bread 
from this, which is the best flour, and have it as nearly 
perfect as possible. 

There have been man}- variations of the Haxall process, 
and all are included under the term neio-process jiour . 

Minnesota. — The Minnesota, or patent-process, flour is 
now considered one of the best grades. The Washburn, 
Pillsbury, and mail}- other mills located in Minneapolis are 
the largest flour-mills in the world, and produce an excel- 
lent quality of flour, in which a large proportion of the 
gluten is retained. This Minnesota flour is made from 
carefuU}' selected wheat grown in the Red River region, 
the best wheat-growing section in America. The first step 
in the process is the breaking off of tiie germinal point of 
each grain b}' what are called ending stones. Then it is 
sent through corrugated iron rollers, having shallow grooves 
cut spirally upon them, with rounded ridges between, and 
the opposing rollers grooved in an opposite direction. The 
grains are crushed (not ground) ; the starchy parts, or 
middlings, being quite finely powdered and easily separa- 
ted from the bran or tailings. After this separation the 
middlings are passed through ten bolting-cloths, and 
then through other aufl finer corrugated machines, and 
made into the various grades oi fine, superfine^ and fannj 
flours, 



42 The Boston Cook Book, 

Health-Food Flour. — A still better method of convert- 
ing wheat into flour, and one which is indorsed b}' leading 
scientists and phj'siciaus, has been recenth' introduced by 
the Health Food Company of New York. Onh; the choicest 
kinds of wheat are used. The outer husk is first removed 
b}' moistening the grain, and subjecting it to a gentle rub- 
bing by what is termed the "attrition process." This 
softens the wood}' fibre of the outer bran, which is easily 
removed b}' sifting, but does not aff"ect the hard gluten 
coats. The grains are dried, then pulverized into various 
grades by a compressed cold- air blast, which dashes the 
grains into atoms with tremendous force. This is called 
whole-wheat flour, the name indicating that the whole of the 
gluten, or nutritive part of the flour, is retained. It is not 
sifted like other flours, but pulverized into all the varieties 
of crushed wheats coarse granulated and fine granulated wheat; 
each variet}^, even the flnest flour, containing all that is 
valuable as food. Bread made with this flour has been 
found, after repeated trial, to be sweet and agreeable to the 
taste, light and spongy in texture, with none of the objec- 
tionable features of Graham bread, and answering fully all 
the demands of perfect nutrition. 

Cheap inferior Graham flour, made of poor flour mixed 
with bran, is worse than no food at all. Any flour con- 
taining much of the indigestible bran causes irritation of 
the digestive organs ; all the food is hurried through the 
alimentary canal before digestion is complete or all the 
nutriment can be absorbed, and thus is neither economical 
nor healthful. Fine flour containing the most gluten is the 
most nuti'itious, because it is all digested, and the loss of 
albuminous material can be supplied from other sources. 

The Arlington, the Franklin, and some other brands of 
whole-wheat flour, are highly indorsed by those famihar 
with them. 

The Tests of Good Flour. 

The first requisite in making good bread is to use good 
flour. Good flour should not be pure white in color, but 



Tests of Flour, 43 

of a creamy, yellowish-white shade. If it feel damp, 
clammy, or stick}', and gradually form into lumps or 
cakes, it is not the best. Good flour holds together in a 
mass, when squeezed b}' the hand, and retains the impres- 
sion of the fingers, and even the marks of the skin, much 
longer than poor flour ; when made into a dough, it is 
elastic, easy to be kneaded, will stay in a round puff}- 
shape, and will take up a large amount of water : while 
poor flour will be stick}', flatten, or spread itself over the 
board, and will never seem to be stiff enough to be handled, 
no matter how much flour is used. Haxall flour has a fine 
granular consistency, and runs easily through the sieve or 
the fingers like fine meal ; while good St. Louis fiour feels 
soft and oil}'. It is extravagant to buy poor or even 
doubtful flour. But, should it have every appearance of 
being good flour, and yet not make good bread, do not 
condemn the flour without a fair trial ; and be sure the 
fault is nowhere else. 

Every experienced cook has her own tests for flour, and 
some of them are amusing, if not reliable. The best way 
is to buy a small quantity at first, and make it into dough ; 
then, if satisfactory, purchase whatever amount is re- 
quired, and buy this same brand as long as it proves of 
uniform quality. The names given to flour are not a sure 
criterion of the quality. The flour may come from the 
same growth of wheat, and be ground in the same manner 
and at the same mill, and yet the miller or the wholesale 
dealers will brand it differently. And the same brand will 
vary in quality from year to year. Some of the varieties 
sold in lioston, and known to be good by personal trial, 
are Pillsbury's, Washburn & Crosby's, Swan's Down, 
Taylor's Best, Brown's Best, Marguerite, etc. ; the same 
flour may be known in other cities under different names. 
There are others equally good, and every year some new 
brand is announced. It is estimated that one barrel of 
flour will last one person one year ; which gives a rule 
of proportion by which to buy. Most good housekeepers 
agree that flour is not improved by long keeping, though 



44 The Boston Cook Book. 

flour dealers think differentl}'. Flour should be kept in a 
cool, drj- place, as the least dampness causes it to absorb 
moisture ; the gluten loses its tenacity', becomes stick}', 
and the bread made from it is coarser and less light. 

¥ov small families it is better to buy whole-wheat flour 
by the bag or half-barrel ; Haxall, for bread, by the bar- 
rel ; and the best St. Louis flour for cake and pastr}', by 
the bag, as a much smaller proportion is needed (or should 
be) for these indigestibles, than for the " staff of life." 

Bread, Fermented and Unfermented. 

Now, having discussed the subject of the flour, the next 
step in order is the different wa3'S of making it into bread. 
These may all be included under two divisions, — those 
made bj^ fermentation, and those without fermentation. 

Fermentation^ what is it'? — Fermentation is that change 
in organic substances by which their sugar, starch, gluten, 
etc., are decomposed or recombined into new compounds. 
This change may be spontaneous under favorable condi- 
tions of air, moisture, and warmth ; or it may be hastened 
b}^ the presence of a ferment. A ferment is some albu- 
minous substance in a state of decomposition, and, when 
introduced into any other albuminous substance, in how- 
ever minute a quantity, causes a change which pervades 
the whole mass. These fermenting substances are in great 
variet}', and the germs of some of them are always present 
in the air. There are different kinds of fermentation. 

The lactic fermentation is the change in milk when it 
sours. The casein, or albuminous part of the^milk, by 
exposure to the air and warmth, begins to decompose, 
becomes a ferment, and changes the sugar of the milk into 
an acid called lactic acid. This reacts upon the remainder 
of the milk, as any acid would, and causes it to coagulate 
or harden, and gives it a sour taste. 

The alcoholic fermentation is that which is produced in 
substances rich in sugar or starch, as the fruits and grains 
from which wines and beer are made. Some of these fer- 



Fermentation. 45 



ment germs are present in the juice of grapes ; and under 
the influence of air, moisture, and warmth, the}' seize 
upon the sugar already present in the natural fruit juices, 
and any that may be added, and convert it into carbonic 
acid gas and alcohol. In the grains, a portion of the 
gluten ferments and changes tlie starch into sugar, and 
then the sugar into carbonic acid and alcohol. In con- 
verting the starch into sugar there is no change evident to 
the e^'e ; but as soon as the sugar is decomposed into alco- 
hol and carbonic acid gas, large bubbles of gas appear, 
which swell the whole mass. 

Acetic fermentation is caused by allowing alcoholic fer- 
mentation to go on beyond a certain limit, or in a tem- 
perature above 90°. A familiar illustration of this is the 
change of wine or cider into vinegar. 

Now, bread-dough contains gluten, sugar, and starch ; 
and if the dough be kept warm for a certain time, lactic 
fermentation will be developed spontaneously^ and the bread 
made from such dough will be sour and heavy. Alco- 
holic fermentation can also be spontaneously produced in 
dough, b}' making first a batter (as the semi-fluid state 
is more favorable to rapid chemical change), and subject- 
ing it to a temperature of 110° for five or six hours ; then, 
adding more flour, allowing it to rise again, and then 
baking it. Bread made in this way is called salt or milk- 
rising's bread. But it does not keep well, and is not gen- 
erally liked. 

It is not always convenient to wait for dough to be 
raised in this manner, so we hasten the process by the 
addition of some active ferment. Leaven, or a piece of 
old dough, left to sour, and then mixed with the new 
dough was formerly used ; this produced lactic as well as 
alcoholic fermentation, and though the bread was light and 
spong}' in texture, it had an unpleasant sour taste. But 
since the chemistry of yeast fermentation has been under- 
stood, yeast has come to be considered the best ferment for 
producing alcoholic fermentation in bread rapidly, and 
with no objectionable result.

Teast, ivhat is ttf — Yeast is a plant or germ of the 
funo"iis tribe. Under tlie microscope it is found to consist 
of numberless minute rounded or oval bodies which are 
true vegetable cells. Yeast is therefore one of the simplest 

and smallest of vegetable 
organisms. Each little 
cell consists of an en- 
velopinof skin or mem- 

FiG. 4. Yeast Plant. , ^ ^ . . , . . -, 

brane, containing a liquid 
or sap. The}^ grow or expand from the minutest micro- 
scopic points, and seem to bud off from each other and 
multiply into many millions to the cubic inch. These 
cells are easily propagated in any medium where they find 
congenial food, particularly in the juice of grapes. If 
grape-juice be filtered and left to stand in a warm place 
two or three hours, it becomes first cloudy, then thick, and 
gives off bubbles of gas, showing there has been some 
change in its composition. In a short time a gra3'ish- 
yellow froth, or layer of 3'east cells, collects on the surface. 
" Whether the germs or spores of the 3'east plant exist 
alread}' in the juices of the living grape, or whether thev 
are always floating in the air, and cling to the exterior ot 
the fruit, and only become mixed with the juice in the wine- 
press, is not known ; " neither is it known just how they 
decompose the sugar of the grape. But it is enough for 
our purpose to know that the}- grow in the juice and ex- 
pand there, and that an active ferment ma}' be dissolved 
out of these yeast cells, sufficient to cause alcoholic 
fermentation. 

The natural development of yeast through the agency of 
plants is too slow and inconvenient a process to rely upon ; 
therefore we manufacture it from various substances rich 
in starch and sugar. Brewer's yeast is made from malt, 
or sprouting grain, usually barley ; home-made yeast, from 
flour and potatoes. 

Teast Bread the Result of Chemical Changes. — Bread 
properly made with yeast undergoes certain chemical 
changes which render it lighter, more porous, more pleas-

ant to the taste, and more healthful, because more easily 
digested, and more convenient for general use. It is gen- 
erally recommended by scientific and medical men as the 
best form of bread. 

Wheat contains a larger percentage of starch than of an}-- 
thing else. We learn, in the chapter on Digestion, that 
starch as such is not absorbed into the human S3'stem. It 
must first be transformed into sugar. All starch that is. 
not changed into sugar by the process of cooking or before 
our food is eaten, is so changed by the ptyalin^ or ferment of 
the saliva, and the ferment of the pancreatic fluid. Any 
process which produces this change for us makes our food 
more digestible. '• Powdered alum will dissolve in water 
sooner than a crystal of alum." Any fluid will penetrate 
more easil}- through a sponge than through puttj^, and the 
salivary' and gastric fluids are no exception to this rule. 
Wheat starch in its natural state is close and compact ; and 
bread made simply with flour and water, and baked at once., 
will be close, dry, and diflficult to masticate and digest. 
Good bread should be sufficiently soft to be easily crushed 
in the mouth, and of such a light, spongy texture that all 
the starch cells ma}' be ruptured, and the greatest possible 
amount of surface be presented to the action of the diges- 
tive fluids. To obtain these qualities in bread, we try to 
expand the dough as much as possible without destroying 
its natural sweetness. Owing to the peculiar elasticity 
and tenacity of the wheat gluten, this is very easily accom- 
plished by alcoholic fermentation. The flour is moistened 
with some warm liquid, yeast and salt are added, and it is 
then exposed for some hours to a temperature of about 
70°. The yeast changes some of the starch of the flour 
into sugar, and the sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid 
gas. This gas, being lighter than the dough, rises, and, in 
its efforts to escape, expands the elastic, glutinous dough 
into a mass two or three times its original bulk. The 
toughness or elasticity of the gluten prevents the gas from 
escaping ; and when this expansion has reached the desired 
limit, — that is,beforethe alcoholic fermentation has changed

to the acetic and soured the dough, or the tough, glutinous 
walls of the air cells are broken, — we check the forma- 
tion of gas, and kill the ferment by baking the dough in a 
hot oven. The alcohol escapes into the oven ; some of the 
starch is changed into gum, and forms the crust ; and the 
rapid decomposition, produced b}' the intense heat, causes 
the crust to assume a brown color. 

Unferniented Bread. — This is made without 3'east ; but 
the principle is the same as in fermented bread, namely, the 
liberation of gas within the dough. The gas escapes quickly, 
and all such bread must be baked as soon as possible after 
mixing. There are no chemical changes in the starch or 
sugar ; the elastic, glutinous dough is simpl}' expanded by 
the gas. The starch cells are ruptured hy the intense heat 
in baking ; but if the gas bubbles burst before the heat has 
fixed the gluten wall, the bread will be heav3^ This gas 
is produced in the bread dough in various ways : 1st. By 
the gas in ver^' cold water, and the air obtained hy vig- 
orous beating ; 2d. B3' the introduction of water under 
pressure, highly charged with gas. The first method is 
only suitable for mixtures which are to be baked quickly 
in a very hot oven, and eaten immediatel}', like gems, 
puffs, etc. The latter method produces what is known as 
aerated bread, making a light, sweet, spongy loaf; but it 
is not practicable for home use. 3d. The usual method 
is by some gas-generating compound, as the union of an 
acid and an alkali ; usuall}' soda, with either sour milk, 
cream of tartar, or muriatic acid. This is a convenient 
form adopted b^- many people who think it hard work to 
make 3'east bread. When the chemicals used are pure, 
and in such a proportion that the}' neutralize each other, 
and leave onl}- Rochelle salt as a residue, this bread, if 
used only occasionall}', is harmless. But Rochelle salt is 
a medicine, not a nutritive food ; and "those who are well 
do not need the disturbing influence of a medicine in their 
dailv bread," and those who are ill do not often need this 
particular form of medicine. Through ignorance or care- 
lessness this bread is often made so that there is an excess

of alkali or a residue of alum ; and then, if used habitually, 
it is injurious, and to some extent poisonous. It is con- 
venient to know how to make it well in an emergency, and 
it iielps make variety. It is best, when freshly baked, in 
the form of small biscuit rather than in loaves, and is not 
as indigestible, when eaten hot, as hot yeast bread. But 
for a bread for general use, for bread that will keep well, 
for bread that will leave a sweet, clean taste in the mouth, 
for bread that will 3-ield the most in bulk from a given 
amount of flour, for bread for promoting health, there is 
nothing equal to perfect, home-made yeast bread. It is 
not so difficult a task to make perfect bread as most youn^ 
housekeepers imagine, or old housekeepers assert. It i 
not impossible for a 3'oung girl to succeed as well in he\ 
first attempt in this art as the mature housekeeper who 
counts her loaves by the thousand, provided she learns the 
best way of making it, and uses a reasonable amount of 
common-sense. 

The Best Kinds of Yeast. 

Who made the first 3'east ? and how does a 3^oung house, 
keeper start her own, when away from stores or friends, 
where she can neither buy nor borrow V are questions often 
asked. Simply make a thin batter with flour and water, 
and let it stand in a warm place till it ferments, and is full 
of bubbles. A pint of this ferment is equal to one cup of 
old 3'east in starting the new. 

There are three kinds of yeast in general use, — the 
dry, the compressed, and the liquid, — each of which has 
its peculiar merits. 

Dry yeast cakes are inexpensive, always ready to use, 
and generally liked by those who care more for economy 
of time and trouble than for the quality of their bread. 

Comjyressed yeast cakes, \\]ie '' Fleischmann's'* are ex- 
cellent, when perfectly fresh; the best form of 3'east where 
bread is made in large quantities. But for a small famil3', 
where onl3' a quarter of a cake is used perhaps twice a

week, or for those living at a distance from the stores, 
they are not so convenient or cheap as good home-made 
yeast. They have almost entirely taken the place of baker's 
yeast. 

As. to which is best of the man}' varieties of home-made 
yeast, who shall decide when housekeepers disagree? 
Ever}' good cook thinks her way the best. They are all good 
that make good bread ; the only special advantage of one 
over another being the greater ease in making or the 
length of time it will keep good. People who are inclined 
to shirk think it a deal of trouble to make yeast of any 
kind ; but there are none so independent as those who make 
their own y^ast. 

The simplest form of liquid yeast is made with flour, salt, 
and boiling h^p water. To this many add potatoes and a 
little sugar, and some add ginger. Chemists say that the 
potato is the best form of starch for the growth of yeast. 
Potato yeast rises more rapidly, and keeps longer without 
souring, than flour yeast ; bread made from it is sweet, 
light, and does not dry quickly. As to the comparative 
merits of grated raw potato or boiled potato, those who 
have used them both ways with equally good results think 
the grated potato has the advantage of being made in much 
less time. 

The really essential points are that the water shall be 
boiling, so that all the cells of the flour or potato may be 
ruptured. The salt and sugar assist in the fermentation, 
and the hops and ginger serve to prevent the yeast from 
souring by checking the fermentation before all the sugar 
is converted into alcohol ; they also give it an agreeably 
pungent taste, if not used in too large quantities. Old 
potatoes are better than new for yeast, because they con- 
tain more sugar. Porcelain or granite kettles for boiling 
the hops and potatoes, and earthen bowls and wooden 
spoons for mixing, are best, as iron and tin cause the yeast 
to turn dark-colored. 

The yeast for starting must be fresh and lively, and 
never added till the boilinoj mixture has become lukewarm,

or the plant will be killed. It must be kej . A^arm, and 
stirred several times while rising, and the next day put 
awa}' in well-scalded glass jars. Keep it in a cool place ; 
freezing or intense heat will kill the yeast plant. Reserve 
a portion for the next rising in a small jar by itself, as 
opening the jar often causes the yeast to lose its strength. 
Always shake or stir well before using. Yeast is good 
■when it is foamy or full of beads, has a brisk, pungent 
odor, and a good deal of snap or vim ; it is poor when it 
has an acid odor, and looks water}' or has a thin film 
over the top. 

Making the Dough. 

Flour is moistened, or made into dough, with water or 
with milk. This softens the gluten and starch, dissolves 
the sugar, and cements all the particles together. Those 
who prefer water claim that water bread is cheaper, has 
more of the natural sweet taste of the wheat, and will 
keep longer ; while those in favor of using milk are equally 
sure that milk bread is more nutritious, more tender, more 
agreeable to the taste and the eye, more easily made, and 
with proper care will keep sweet and moist longer. 

Proportion. — The proportion of liquid and flour varies[ 
both with the flour and the liquid. Bread made of St. 
Louis flour, or mixed with water, takes more flour to make 
the same amount, than when made of Haxall flour, or 
mixed with milk. The general rule is one scant measure of 
liquid, including the yeast, to three full measures of flour. 
Water bread will need about one cupful more ; and milk 
bread, or whole-wheat bread, from one half to one cupful 
less of flour. Dough which is to be kneaded, or rolled 
and cut into special shapes, should be stiff"er than that 
which is not kneaded, or is to be made into loaves ; but in 
all cases it should be mixed just as soft as can be handled 
easily without sticking, and just as little extra flour as 
possible should be used. If the dough be too stitf, make 
several deep incisions, and work in a little more liquid. 
The proportion of yeast is half a cupful of fresh home- 




52 The Boston Cook Booh. 

made yeast to a pint of liquid: a little less in warm weather ; 
or when mixed at night, when the dough has a longer 
time to rise; or when made with a "sponge," or with 
whole-wheat flour, as the extra amount of gluten in 
this flour causes it to ferment more rapidl}'. A larger 
amount of jeast can be used when it is necessary' to mak 
bread in a limited time ; but great care must be taken not 
lo allow the dough to rise beyond the desired doubhng 
in bulk. With compressed yeast, dissolve one fourth of 
a cake in half a cupful of lukewarm tvater, and use as 
home-made yeast. It will dissolve in one tablespoonful 
of water ; but it is important to have the half-cupful, that 
the proportion of liquid may be the same. 

Manner of Mixing. — Many people prefer to measure the 
flour, and add enough of the liquid to make it the desired 
consistency. The better wa}- is to measure the liquid, and 
add flour, using more or less according to the quality of 
the flour, as the measure of the liquid determines the size 
of the loaf. All the flour may be added at first, and the 
dough raised in a mass ; or a drop batter ma}' be made with 
about half the flour, and when this has well risen, the re- 
mainder of the flour ma}^ be added, and the whole allowed 
to rise again. The latter method is preferable when it is 
inconvenient to knead at the first mixing, as is often the 
case in the evening, or when there is an}^ doubt about the 
quality of the yeast, as, if the yeast will not raise three 
cups of flour, it certainl}^ will not raise six. This method 
is advisable, also, when it is necessary to hasten the pro- 
cess of bread-making. Dough made by "setting a 
sponge," as this wa}' is called, requires less j^east, the fer- 
mentation being more rapid in a batter than in a stiff 
dough ; and this fermented batter acts like a double portion 
of yeast on the fresh flour, raising it very quickly. It is 
the best wa}^ of making bread with milk in the summer, as 
it may be mixed earl}' in the morning and baked by noon ; 
and as it may be easil}^ watched, it need not become sour. 
The question of mixing at night or in the morning is 
one which every housekeeper can best answer for herself. 



Mixing Bread. 53 



Man}- old receipts read, '' Make a hole in the flour, 
add the yeast, and then pour in the hquid." If the 
3'east be added to the milk or water, and well mixed with 
it, and the flour then stirred thoroughly into this liquid 
mixture, the yeast will be more evenly distributed through 
the dough, and less kneading will be required than when 
made by the old method. 

The other ing)"edients added to the dough are salt and 
sugar., in the proportion of one even teaspooyiful of salt and 
one even tahlespoonfal of sugar to three pints of flour ^ using a 
little less salt if butter is added, and a little more with 
compressed yeast, as that is not as salt as home-made 
3'east, and doubling the amount of sugar when using whole- 
wheat flour. 

Sugar in Bread. — Many object to the use of sugar 
in bread. Flour in its natural state contains sugar ; this 
sugar is changed in fermentation. Just enough sugar to 
restore the natural sweetness, but not enough to give a 
really sweet taste, is necessar}- in fermented bread. 

Potatoes. — Potatoes are sometimes added to bread 
dough. Where the flour is of an inferior quahty, the 
bread is ver}- much improved by their use ; but with good 
flour they are unnecessary, and the use of them increases 
the labor of making bread. 

Shortening. — Whether bread shall be ' ' shortened or not 
shortened," is another question on which there is great 
diversity of opinion. Those who disapprove of fat of any 
kind in bread claim that we eat fat enough in other forms 
of food, and also that the same crisp tenderness of tex- 
ture may be produced b}- skilful kneading. Bread made 
with new or unskimmed milk, and kneaded well, requires 
no other shortening ; but water bread, when shortened, is 
made more tender, and therefore is more easily pene- 
trated by the digestive fluids. The latest decision of the 
best physicians is that fat is absolutel}' necessary as an 
element of food, and it is otlen given as a remedj' for 
some diseases. The proportion which one person would 
receive from one tablespoonful of butter, or drippings, or 



54 The Boston Cook Book. 

lard, in two loaves of bread would not harm the most deli- 
cate stomach. Butter tastes best ; drippings are cheap- 
est. Lard has for its chief merit that of making whiter 
bread than either of the others. The shortening may be 
rubbed into the flour, or, better still, melted in the warm 
liquid. Too much shortening clogs the glutinous cell- 
walls, and therefore checks the rising. Rolls, rusks, and 
buns, w^hich are usually shortened more than loaf bread, 
should have the butter added at the last kneading. 

The bread should be mixed in a deep stone-china or 
granite bowl ; wooden bowls are difficult to keep sweet and 
clean. Brown earthenware is awkward in shape and 
clumsy to handle, while tinware, being a better conductor 
than china, lets the heat within the mass escape, and the 
tin rubs off from the constant friction. Use a wooden 
spoon, or a wooden-handled iron spoon, or a broad-bladed 
knife. 

Kneading the Dough. — Kneading is the process of press- 
ing or working the dough in such a manner that the flour 
and water ma}^ be thoroughl}' mixed, and the 3'east be so 
evenly distributed that the fermentation may be equal 
through the whole mass. It may be done hy cutting or 
chopping, either with the hand or machiner}' ; but there is 
nothing that gives the fine, even grain to bread so well as 
hand-kneading ; and no surer test of the proper consist- 
ency of dough than that given by the sense of touch. 
There are some kinds of milk bread and rolls which are 
very good without it ; but water bread should always be 
kneaded. It is often done in the mixing-bowl, hy draw- 
ing the dough over from the side and pressing it down 
in the centre, turning the bowl with the other hand ; but 
it is more effectually accomplished on a bread-board. In 
Spain the bakers knead the bread with such force that 
the palms of the hands and the second joints of the fingers 
are covered with corns ; but strength and force are not so 
essential to good kneading as a peculiar and dexterous 
handling of the dough. The most approved process is the 
fo' jwing : — 



Kneading. 55 



Sprinkle the board with flour, find leave a little in the 
corner to lay your hands upon. Scrape the dough from 
the bowl, and toss it over with the knife that it may 
be well floured. Flour the hands ; then, with the flnger- 
tips, draw the dough farthest from 30U up and over to- 
ward the centre, letting the ball of the hand meet the 
dough, and then press down firml}^, giving the dough some- 
what of a rolling motion, that it ma}' not stick to the 
board. Repeat this motion until the dough is in a long 
narrow shape, then turn it at right angles, and draw up, 
fold, and press down again ; and continue this process 
until the dough is smooth, elastic, fine, and even-grained. 
Dust the board and the palms of the hands with flour often, 
but onl}' slightl}'. Should the dough stick, lift it quicklj', 
and always scrape off what has adhered to the board before 
dusting again, that the board may be kept smooth. But 
do not let it stick ; keep it in constant motion. Do not 
knead hard enough to break into the dough, nor let the 
finger-tips pierce the smooth crust that soon forms under 
proper kneading. Use the fingers merel}' in drawing the 
dough over, and keep them up and out of it when press- 
ing with the ball of the hand. Use both hands in the 
same manner, or draw up and press with the right, and 
turn the ball of dougli with the left, that all parts may 
receive an equal pressure. When enough of this smooth, 
soft texture has been formed all through the dough, it can 
be worked for some time without even a dusting of flour. 
After a little experience, if care be taken in the beginning, 
and only a little flour added at each dusting, when the 
dough is sufficiently kneaded, the hands, the apron, and 
the board will be clean, and the dough of an even, elastic 
consistency, springing up instantly as- you toss or pound 
or punch into it. The habit of mixing with the hands, 
and rubbing off httle wads of dough from the fingers into 
the whole mass, should be avoided, especially toward the 
last of the process. There is no mechanical operation in 
cooking more fascinating than the deft, quick touclies a 
natural kneader gives to a mass of dough. Young ladies

with pretty hands can display them there quite as well as 
with embroidery, etc. ; but the rings and bracelets should 
be left in the jewel-case. The stitches in tight dress 
sleeves are not "^ warranted not to break " during this pro- 
cess. Perfect freedom for the muscles of the arms and 
chest is absolutely essential to the making and kneading 
of bread. 

Temperature and Time for the Raising of Bread. — In 
winter the water or milk used in mixing should be luke- 
warm ; and if the flour be kept in a yer3' cold place, warm 
it before using. In summer the water need not be 
warmed, neither should it be ice- water ; the milk should 
be scalded (not boiled), and cooled. After the bread is 
kneaded sufficiently it must be made into a smooth round 
ball, with no dry flour left on the surface, and put back in 
the mixing-bowl to rise. If 3'ou have learned the knack 
of scraping a bowl thoroughly, it need not be washed ; 
otherwise it is well to w^ash and grease the bowl, that the 
dough may come out more easily after it has risen. Notice 
how it fills the bowl, and let it rise until it has a little 
more than doubled in size. Cover it, not with a cloth 
alone, as that serves merely to keep out the dust, but with 
several thicknesses of cloth, and a tightly fitting tin cover. 
It is important that the air be excluded, as it causes a 
hard crust to form, which will be difficult to mix thoroughly 
in the dough at the next kneading, and will also leave dark 
spots or streaks in the bread. 

The dough should rise in a temperature of about 75°. 
Avoid a draught of cold air, or sudden alternations of ex- 
treme heat and cold. If it be placed on a mantel or near 
a stove, it must be turned frequently. When necessary to 
hasten the rising, pface the bowl in a pan of warm (not 
hot) water, and keep the water at the same temperature 
until it begins to rise. After fermentation has been well 
established the temperature can be lowered without harm, 
provided it does not fall below 45°. In winter, bread 
should be mixed early in the evening ; and if the kitchen 
become very cold before morning, keep the dough in a 



Bread Raising. 57 



ivarmer room ; it will be risen by six or seven in the morn- 
ing. In summer, mix it later at night, leave it in a cool 
place, and the next morning attend to it earl}' ; if possible, 
b}' five o'clock. In ver}' hot weather mix early in the 
morning, and bake by noon. It should never be allowed 
to rise to the point of '' caving in," or settling, or running 
over the bowl. Even if it does not become sour, it loses 
the natural sweet flavor of the wheat, and is tasteless and 
insipid. It siiould rise in a light, pufly, well-roun(k^d 
mass ; and if it half filled the bowl at first, it will be ready, 
when risen nearly to the top of the bowl, " to cut down," 
as most cooks express it. This is done hy cutting it awa}' 
from the sides of the bowl, and working it over into the 
centre with the knife. This releases some of the gas, 
checks the fermentation, and reduces the bulk somewhat. 
It will rise again very quickl}-, and the cutting-down pro- 
cess can be repeated several times, and the bread will be 
the better for it, provided the rising does not go too far at 
any time. It takes but a moment, and should alwa3s be 
done when the dough is risen sufficientl}', if 30U are not 
ready to shape it at once into loaves. If 3'ou do not wish 
to bake the bread for several hours, it can be kneaded 
again and put in the ice-chest or cellar. When the dough 
rises too long, and has soured, it will have a strong, tin- 
gling acid odor as you cut into it, and it will pull away 
from the bowl in long threads, having a watery appear- 
ance, quite unlike the proper spong}- consistency and pun- 
gent alcoholic odor when it is just right. The practice of 
using soda to sweeten it, when in this state, cannot be too 
severely condemned. Chemists sa}' that light sour bread 
is not unhealthful, although unpalatable to most Americans. 
Bread in that condition is eaten largel}' by the Germans. 
Sour bread sweetened I)}' soda is unhealthful, as it is very 
rarely that the alkali is wholl>' neutralized b}' the acetic 
acid. Those who boast of never having sour bread be- 
cause the}' always keep a bottle of soda dissolved and 
ready for instant use, should, instead, blush at the fact of 
such careless housewifery. AVith proper care, bread, evey

when made with milk, need never sour. But should the 
accident ever occur, it is better to eat the bread, or dr}' it 
for crumbs, or. throw it away even, than to use the soda. 
This practice is so abominable that here it will receive 
neither aid nor encouragement. 

Shaping into Loaves or Biscuit. — At least an hour be- 
fore the time for baking, scrape the dough from the bowl, 
and turn it out upon the board, which should be dusted 
with flour ; knead it slightly, and divide into the proper 
proportion for loaves. 

The measures given in the following receipts fill two 
brickloaf pans, which are eight inches long by four inches 
broad and five inches deep, with nearly straight sides. 
This shape gives small uniform slices. Small round pans 
were formerl\^ considered best for baking both bread and 
cake ; and there is some truth in the reason given, namel}^ 
that the cells which are formed by the gas are circular in 
form, and are much more uniform in a round than in an 
oblong loaf, in which the corner cells are easily flat- 
tened or compressed, forming heavj' streaks around the 
edges. But man}' people dislike the shape of the slices in 
a round loaf, and oblong pans have been more generallj^ 
adopted. They should be greased with lard or drippings. 
It is better to divide the dough into four equal parts and 
put two in each pan, for several reasons : a small round 
loaf is more easily shaped, and can be broken, if wanted, 
while fresh, better than a long loaf; two small loaves 
rise and fill the pan more evenl}' than one long loaf ; and 
unless great care be taken in shaping to have the one 
loaf of uniform thickness, it will rise more in the middle 
and give uneven slices. Man}' make a deep cut through 
the middle to prevent this ; but that spoils the smooth 
round efl^ect which adds so much to the looks of the 
crust. 

Use the merest dusting of flour in shaping, and knead 
just enough to work out the large bubbles of gas by fold- 
ing the mass over into the middle, then letting it spring 
open, Pat, coax, and work it with the hand and fingers 



Loaves 59 



until there are no wrinkles, and tlie loaves are smooth. 
Greasing the hands slightly witli butter helps. All the 
flour added at this kneading rises but once, and too much 
will make the loaf burst out unevenl}' at the sides. Some 
careless kneaders merelj' fold it over, and if it look 
smooth on the top tliev think that enough ; but their loaf 
will sometimes have a seam or crack through it, which will 
cause the slices to fall apart easilj*. 

The loaves should come nearh' half-wa}' up the pan ; and 
the same rule follows as for the first rising, namelj- , let it 
come to tiie top, or till the bulk is doubled. Cover with 
cloth and tin cover, or a large tin pan. The time for rising 
varies with the lightness -of the dough and the temperature 
of the room. It is impossible to give a definite rule ; but 
should it rise too far and stick to the cloth, or look " tum- 
bled in," cut it down, knead, and let it rise again. Never 
bake it in the above state, as it will be coarse-grained, if 
not hollow. It is better to bake it a little too soon than 
to let it rise too long. 

Rolls and small biscuit should rise in the pans longer 
and be baked in a hotter oven than the loaf, because the 
loaf rises in the oven until the heat has penetrated to the

Many people prepare biscuit for breakfast b}^ letting them 
rise ten or fifteen minutes in a very hot place while the 
oven is heating. They are often only half baked, and then 
eaten smoking hot ; and those who have never had au}--

practice have been the occasion for much of the outer}' 
against hot, or even fresh, biscuit. Such are entirel}' dif- 
ferent from the dry, light, delicious biscuit which have had

is, never tr}^ to have raised biscuit for breakfast without

rising at least tliree hours before breakfast- time, unless 
you wish your famil}^ to become slaves to indigestion. 

The Temperature for Baking. — The object of baking 
bread is to kill the ferment, rupture the starch grains, 
fix the air cells, and form a nicely flavored crust. Bread 
could be baked by steam, as the air cells become fixed 
at 212°, and the temperature of the inside of the loaf, 
owing to the moisture, never rises above that point ; but, 
to give the delicious flavor of the browned crust, a much 
higher temperature is needed. The oven should be hot 
enough to brown a teaspoonful of flour in one minute 
for rolls, and in Jive minutes for loaves. This is a good 
rule for those who do not use a thermometer, or cannot 
judge of the heat by their hands. The heat should be 
greater at the bottom than at the top of the oven, and of 
sufficient strength to last through the time of baking (which 
is about an hour) without replenishing the fire. Divide 
the time into thirds ; the first fifteen or twenty minutes 
the heat should increase, remain stead}' during the next, 
and deci'ease toward the last. The dough should rise, and, 
after fifteen minutes, begin to brown slightl}'. If the oven 
be too hot, and the loaf brown too fast, a hard crust will 
be formed before the heat reaches the centre, and, pressing 
down on the air cells, make a heav}' streak ; or, if removed 
from the oven too soon, it will be raw and doughy inside. 
If the heat be not sufficient to form the crust in fifteen 
minutes, the dough will go on rising until it becomes sour 
and pasty, and the air cells will run together, making a 
hole in the middle. The baking of bread is something that 
will not take care of itself. The old notion that 3'ou must 
not look at an3'thing in the oven is erroneous ; and until 
you have learned by experience just how to regulate the 
fire and oven, and the many tests by which every good 
cook determines when bread is done, look at it often, 
and bake according to the clock from fift}' to sixtj' min- 
utes. Better bake ten minutes too long, putting a paper 
over the top to prevent a burned crust, than not long 
enough. Bake it brown ^ not black, nor pale whity-brown,

but brown all over. Rolls are often brushed with milk just 
before and after baking, to give them a richer brown color. 
Rubbing over with soft butter while still hot makes a crisp, 
delicious crust. When well baked, if tapped with the fin- 
gers, a hollow, empt}^ sound will be emitted ; the crust 
feels firm, and, if broken apart, the inside rebounds in- 
stantly on any slight pressure. 

The Care of Dread after Baking. — Remove the loaves 
immediately from the pans, and place them where the air 
can circulate freeh' round them and thus carry off the gas 
which has been formed, but is no longer needed. A bread 
or cake cooler, made of fine wire, set in a narrow frame 
thirty inches long b}' twelve or fifteen broad, is a very use- 
ful article, as it will hold several loaves. An old wire 
window-screen, too small for modern windows, with cleats 
on the ends, to keep it two or three inches from the table, 
answers the purpose admirabl3\ Man}' use a wire sieve ; 
but that is small, and leaves the marks of the larger cross 
wires on the loaf. Never leave the bread in the pan, or on 
a pine table, to sweat and absorb the odor of the wood. 

If you like crusts that are crisp, do not cover the loaves ; 
but to give the soft, tender, wafer-like consistency which 
many prefer, wrap them, while still hot, in several thick- 
nesses of bread cloth. When cold, put them into a stone 
jar or tin box ; remove the cloth, as that absorbs the mois- 
ture, and gives the bread an unpleasant taste and odor. 
Keep the jar well covered and carefully cleansed from 
crumbs and stale pieces. Scald and dry it thoroughly 
every two or three days. A yard and a half square of 
coarse table linen makes the best bread cloth. Keep a 
good supply ; keep them sweet and clean, and use them 
for no other purpose. 

Fine white bread should be partaken of in moderation. 
Although the "staff of life," it is not necessary to eat 
bread with every kind of diet. It is most useful when 
taken with articles containiug a large proportion of nour' 
ishment in a small bulk, as it then gives the stomach ihe 
proper degree of expansion.

Raw Potato Yeast. 



1^ cup flour. 
>4 cup sugar. 



3 raw potatoes. 

1 to 2 quarts boiling water. 

1 cup yeast. 



1 tablespoonful salt. 

First, see that 3^011 have at least three quarts of water 
boiling rapidh'. Pare the potatoes, and keep them cov- 
ered with cold water. Mix the flour, sugar, and salt in a 
large bowl, and grate the potatoes as quickly as possible, 
not stopping to grate every scrap ; mix them at once with 
the flour, using a wooden or silver spoon, that the mixture 
may not be dark-colored. Pour the boiling water directly 
from the teakettle over the grater, and rinse off" the potato 
into the bowl, using perhaps a pint of water at first. Mix 
the water thoroughly with the potato and flour ; then add, 
slowly, enough more boiling water to make it the consist- 
ency of thin starch. The amount of water will depend 
upon the quality of the flour and potatoes. If it does not 
thicken, pour the mixture into a double boiler or granite 
pan, and let it come to the boiling-point, stirring well to 
keep it from sticking. Strain through a squash strainer and 
let it cool. When lukewarm (clear through the mixture, 
not merely on the top) , add the 3'east. Cover slightl}', and 
keep in a warm (not hot) place, until light and covered 
with white foam. After it begins to rise, beat it well sev- 
eral times, as this makes it stronger. At night, or when 
well risen, put it into wide-mouthed earthen or glass jars. 
The next morning cover tightly, and keep it in a cool 
place. Reserve one cupful or more in a small glass jar, 
and do not open it until ready for the next j^east-making. 
Alwaj's shake yeast well before using ; take j^our cup to 
the jar instead of taking the jar to the hot kitchen ; when 
empt}', scald the jar and the cover thoroughly. This is 
the quickest and easiest way of making j^east, fifteen min- 
utes being ample time for the first part of tlie process. It 
is whiter and looks more inviting than that made with hops. 
It keeps well two weeks, and makes delicious bread. 

This receipt can be varied by using boiUng hop-water.

turiiiiig luul woikliig it over until all the dry flour is well 
mixed with the other materials. Mix it just soft enough 
to be shaped into a loaf after it has risen. Scrape the 
dough from the sides of the bowl ; smooth the top with 
a knife ; cover and let it rise. Shape it into loaves, and 
when well risen bake about forty minutes. 

Water Bread (with a Sponge). 



1 tablcspoonful butter. 
1 teaspooiiful salt. 
1 tablespoonfui sugar. 



1 j)int water. 

^ :^ cup yeast, scant. 

About 2 quarts flour. 



Put the butter, sugar, and salt in the mixing-bowl ; add 
one fourth cup of boiling water to dissolve them ; then add 
enough more lukewarm water to make a pint in all, half 
a cup of yeast, and three and a half or four cups of flour, 
enough to make a batter that will drop, not pour, from 
the spoon. Give it a vigorous beating; cover and let it 
rise over niglit. This soft mixture is called a sponge. In 
the morning add flour to make it stiff enough to knead. 
Knead it half an hour. Cover ; let it rise in the bowl 
until noon, or till light and spongy ; then shape it into 
loaves or rolls ; let it rise again in the pans ; bake as 
usual. This sponge can be divided in the morning, add- 
ing to one part of it white flour enough to knead it, and 
to the other part whole-wheat or rye flour and another 
tablespoonfui of sugar. Make it just stiff enough to shape 
easih' into a loaf after it is risen. Use white flour to 
shape it on the board, as the rye and whole-wheat floui 
are sticky. Or make the dough a little softer, All gem 
pans two thirds full, let them rise to the top, bake in a hot 
oven, and you have " raised rye or whole-wheat gems.'" 

Milk Bread, No. 3 (with Sponge). 

Pour one pint of scalded milk on one tahle spoonful each 
of hutter and sugar., and one teaspoonful of salt ; when luke- 
warm, add half a cup of yeast if mixed in the morning or 
one fourth of a cup if mixed at 7iight. Stir in three cups of

fiour, and beat well. Let it rise over night, or, if mixed in 
the morning, about three hours. Then add from two to 
three cups of Jiour, or enough to knead it, and knead half 
an hour. Let it rise in the bowl, and again after being 
shaped into loaves or rolls, and bake as usual. 

Whole-wheat or rye bi^ead or gems can be made from this 
sponge the same as in the preceding rule. 

Whole- Wheat or Graham Bread. 



1 pint milk, scalded and cooled. 

2 tablespoonf uls sugar. 
1 teaspoonf ul salt. 

y^ cup yeast. 



5 or 6 cups fine granulated wheat 
flour, or 

2 cups white flour, and 

3 or Sj^o cups sifted Graham flour. 



In the morning mix, in the order given, into a dough, a 
little softer than for white bread ; let it rise till light, stir 
it down, pour it into well-greased pans ^ or, if stiff enough, 
shape it into loaves ; let it rise again, and bake a little 
longer and in a less hot oven than white bread. Graham 
or whole-wheat flour rises more rapidly than white flour, 
as it contains more gluten. It is liable to become sour 
if mixed over night, and then the cooks resort to the soda. 
For the true remedj' use less yeast, and use sugar instead 
of molasses, or mix in the morning. Always sift the flour, 
notwithstanding all cook-books sa}' to the contrar3\ Use 
a coarse sieve or squash strainer. Sift once, and, if 3'ou 
observe the character of the refuse, 3'ou will be glad

When made with ordinary Graham flour, the bread is 
much lighter if at least one third white flour be used. . 



Squash Bread.

Pot the corn meal in the mixing-bowl, and scald it with 
boiling water, just enough to wet it ; let it stand ten min- 
utes, then add cold water enough to make a soft batter. 
When lukewarm, add the 3'east, molasses, soda, salt, and 
r^e meal. Beat it well, and let it rise over night, or until it 
cracks open. Stir it down ; put it in a buttered and floured 
tin to rise again ; sprinkle flour over the top. Bake in a 
moderate oven two hours. Brown bread made b}' this rule 
was first tested by the writer thirty years ago, when it was 
a wonder and delight to watch it as it was put on a wooden 
shovel and placed ^n the great brick oven. It has been 
made in the same house regular^ every week since dien» 
and proves just as good now as it was in the olden tim

Raised Biscuit and Rolls. 

The name ''biscuit'* is from the French, and means 
" twice baked." It was originalbr applied to a kind of hard, 
thin bread, made in that manner to deprive it of all moist- 
ure and insure its remaining in good condition for a long 
time. It was something like our crackers and ship bread 
But in America it means an}' kind of bread made into 
small, round cakes and intended to be eaten hot or fresh. 
Raised hiscuit may be made from any of the doughs mads 



Rolls. 69 



by the receipts for bread ; the proportions are enough for 
one pan of bread, and one pan of biscuit containing twelve 
or sixteen according to the size. Thej' sliould always be 
made small, and shaped with the fingers, not cut with a 
cutter. Divide the portion of dough reserved for biscuit 
into halves, then into quarters, and each quarter into 
thirds or quarters. 2h shape a biscuit, take one of these 
quarters in the left hand and rest it lightl}' on the board. 
With the right tluunb and forefinger draw a point of the 
dough up and over to .the centre, and hold it down with the 
left thumb. Give the dough a slight turn toward the left, 
and repeat the drawing up and folding over until you have 
been all round the ball. You may roll them in the hands 
until all these foldings have disappeared and they are 
smooth and round, and call them simply biscuit; or you 
may make the folds as distinct as possible, and place them 
at once in the pan. The folds will spread apart in rising, 
and when baked thc}^ can be peeled off in layers. They 
are then honored with the name of Imperial Rolls. Put 
the biscuit in a shallow round pan, fitting them closely', 
that they may rise up, round and puff}', instead of spread- 
ing. When ver}' light, bake in a very hot oven fifteen or 
twenty minutes. Keep them wrapped in a bread cloth for 
at least half an hour before serving. The receipts for 
Milk Bread are especially nice for biscuit. 

Bolls. 

Rolls are made by rolling the raised dough into small 
forms, with the hands or with a rolling-pin, and afterward 
cutting and folding into the desired shape ; the shape and 
manner of manipulation giving the distinctive names. The 
dough for rolls should be very light, and when wanted un- 
usually nice, more shortening should be worked into it after 
the second kneading. The rule for Water Bread made 
with a sponge is good for plain rolls ; Milk Bread made 
with a sponge is the same as Parker House Rolls, which 
have been generally adopted by housekeepers as the stand-

ard. The following are some of the best varieties and 
shapes : — 

For Finger Rolls ^ make a dough b}' the rule for Milk 
Bread, No. 2, and when risen and read}' to shape, divide 
the half reserved for rolls into twelve pieces. Make each 
piece into a smooth ball as if for biscuit, then roll it be- 
tween the palms, or with the palm of one hand on the 
board, into a long roll about the size of the second finger. 
Roll with buttered hands or with as little flour as possible. 
Place them close together in a long, shallow pan. Let 
them rise to the top of the pan, and bake in a very hot 
oven for ten or fifteen minutes. 

To make a Cleft Eoll, make the dough into smooth balls, 
then with a floured knife-handle press through the centre 
but not quite through on the ends. Or make them round, 
and place them some distance apart on the pan, and when 
ready to bake, make a deep cut through the middle. Make 
another cut at right angles with the first and you have 
a Cross Roll. 

Parker Bouse Rolls are made after the receipt for Milk 
Bread with sponge, and when well risen and ready to shape, 
roll the dough on the board as you would pastry, and, if 
wanted richer, spread a generous tablespoonful of soft- 
ened butter all over it. Fold the dough, and roll out again 
until nearl}' half an inch thick. Lift the rolled dough from 
the board and let it shrink back all it will, and be sure it 
is of uniform thickness before cutting, or the rolls will lose 
their shape. Cut with a round or oval cutter ; press the 
thumb across the middle and fold over like a turnover, 
letting the edges come together. As they rise the}' will 
open a little, and, if folded onl}- half-wa}^ over, they are 
liable to open too far. Spread a bit of soft butter the 
size of a pea on the edge before folding it, if you like 
the crusty inside which that gives. Or roll the dough 
thinner, and put two rounds together with a thin spread- 
ing of butter between ; these are called Twin Rolls. 

To make Pocket-book or Letter Rolls, roll the dough in a 
rectangular shape one fourth of an inch thick, and cut it in 



Stieks. 



7 



fitiips four inches wide and as long as the dough will allow. 
Spread with soft butter ; fold one end of the strip over 
about an inch and a half, and then over again. Cut off 
even with the folding, and then fold another, and so on. 
Or cut the dough into strips two inches wide by seven long, 
and spread each strip with butter, and fold one third over 
and then again like a letter. Or roll the dough out one 
fourth of an inch thick, then roll up and cut pieces one 
inch wide from the end of the roll, turn them over on the 
side, and place close together in a pan to rise. 

To make a Braid^ cut the rolled dough in strips one 
inch wide by six inches long, and pinch three strips together 
at the end, then form into a braid. Or roll little balls of 
dough into long pieces the same as for sticks, and then 
braid them. 

To make Crescents^ or Vienna Rolls ^ roll the dough 
until onh' an eightli of an inch thick ; cut into pieces five 
inches square and then into triangles. Hold the apex of 
the triangle in the right hand, roll the edge next the left 
hand over and over towards the right, stretch the point 
and bring it over and under the roll ; bend the ends of the 
roil around like a horseshoe, being careful to keep in the 
folding. Any dough that is quite stiff may be shaped with 
the hands into small, oval rolls with quite tapering ends, 
and baked far enough apart to allow each roll to have a 
crust all over. These are called French Rolls. Any of 
these rolls may be rubbed with a cloth dipped in melted 
butter ; or, better still, twist a piece of butter in a clean 
cloth and rub it over them just as they are taken from the 
oven. 



Sticks.

it rise over night or till Ught. Shape into small balls ; 
then roll into sticks a foot long. Let them rise slowh' and 
bake in a moderate oven, that the}' ma}' be dried through 
before browning. When shaped into large plain rolls, thev 
are called White Mountain Rolls. 

Rolls designed for breakfast or dinner are better not to 
be sweetened enough to taste sweet ; but for tea or lunch 
more sugar may be added. This brings us to another vari- 
ety of rolls which are made richer by the addition of but- 
ter, sugar, eggs, and fruit, including Sivedish Rolls, Rusks, 
and Bunns. 

Swedish Rolls. 



1 pint milk, scalded. 

}.2 cup butter. 

I4 cup sugar. 

1 scant teaspoonful salt. 



Whites of 2 eggs. 
1^ oup yeast. 
7 or 8 cups flour. 



Melt the butter, and dissolve the sugar and salt in the 
hot milk ; when lukewarm, add the yeast and beaten whites. 
Mix in flour to make a sponge or drop batter. In the 
morning add the remainder of the flour, and knead twenty 
minutes. Let it rise till noon or till light ; then knead 
again slightly, and roll out into a large, rectangular piece, 
half an inch thick. Have the edges as straight as possi- 
ble. Spread all over with a thin layer of soft butter, and 
a sprinkling of sugar, cinnamon, grated lemon rind, and 
currants. Roll up like a jelly roll, cut off slices an inch 
wide, lay them with the cut side down on well-greased 
pans, and when well risen bake in a hot oven fifteen or 
twenty minutes. When done, glaze them with sugar dis- 
solved in milk, and dry them a few minutes in the^ven, or 
rub them with soft butter. If mixed in the morning, 
make a sponge with the scalded milk cooled, the eggs, 
salt, sugar, and part of the flour. Place the bowl in a 
pan of warm water for three or four hours ; then add the 
butter and the remainder of the flour. Knead, and after 
it is well risen roll out as above. 



Rusk. 73 



Rusk, No. 1. 

1 cup milk, scalded and cooled. 34 cup yeast. 

1 tablespoonful sugar. 2 cups flour. 

% teaspoonful salt. 

Mix in a sponge at night or very early in the morning. 
When well risen, acid flour enough to make a stiff dough. 
Knead and let it rise again, then add one fourth of a cup 
of 'biitU:r^ rubbed to a cream, half a cup of sugar ^ and one 
egtj, beaten with butter and sugar. Let it rise in the bowl 
till light. Shape into small round biscuit ; put them close 
together in a shallow cake pan, that they may rise very 
high. When read}^ to bake, rub the tops with sugar dis- 
solved in milk, sprinkle with dry sugar, and bake in a 
moderate oven. 

Rusk, No. 2. 

Make a dough at night by the rule for Milk Bread, No. 1. 
In the morning make half the dough into a loaf for bread. 
Put with the remainder half a cup of butter^ creamed, with 
one cup of sugar and one egg^ well beaten ; mix and beat 
well ; add half a cup oi flour ^ or enough to shape it easily. 
Let it rise in the bowl, shape into small rounds or into 
long narrow rolls, and when very light, glaze them and 
bake as in the preceding rule. 

Rusk, No. 3. {Miss Yarules.) 



1 pint milk, scalded. 

}.2 cup butter and lard, mixed. 



1 cup potato yeast. 

3 eggs. 

Flour as required. 



Mix early in the morning, in the order given, adding 
flour enough to make a thin batter. Let it rise till full of 
bubliles, then add flour enough to knead it. When well 
risen, shape into rounds, or roll out and cut them. Let 
them rise in tlie pans till very light ; then bake in a hot 
oven about half an hour. 



74 The Boston Cook Book, 

Dried Rushs are made after either of these receipts, and 
when risen are rolled thin, cut into rounds, and put two 
together into the pan. When baked, the}' are pulled apart 
and left in a very moderate oven to dr}'. Or the}- are cut 
in slices when cold, and dried until crisp and brown. 
They are delicious soaked in milk and eaten with butter, 
or used the same as bread in puddings, or soaked in«a 
custard and sauted. 



Bunns. 
Make a sponge over night with 



1 cup milk, scalded. 
1 tablespoonful sugar and 1 egg 
beaten together. 



1 saltspoonful salt. 
34 cup yeast. 

2 cups flour. 



Beat it well and in the morning add flour to made a stiff 
dough. Knead fifteen minutes. Let it rise until light, 
then add one fourth of a cup of butter^ softened, half a cup 
of currants^ and one saltspoonful of cinnamon or nutmeg. 
Let it rise in the bowl till light. Shape into small 
round cakes, put them close together, and when well 
risen bake in a moderate oven. Glaze them with sugar 
and milk, or with white of e^^ beaten stiff with sugar. 
Make a deep cut like a cross just before they are put into 
the oven, and you liave Hot Cross Bunns. Many prefer 
a bit of citron put into the middle of each bunn. These 
are better when f res hi}' baked. It is therefore well to 
make only a small quantity. They may be made from 
risen milk-bread dough in the same manner as Rusk, No. 
2, by using the spices and the fruit and a smaller quantity 
of sugar. This receipt for bunns makes excellent raised 
doughnuts l)y omitting the currants and rolling half an 
inch thick and cutting with a doughnut cutter. 

Raised Bread Cake, or Loaf Cake. 

This is similar to rusks and bunns, only richer ; and as 
it improves by keeping, it is well to make a large quantity. 



Stale Bread. 75 



At night mix one pint of milk, scalded and cooled, one 
ieaspoonful of salt, half a cup of yeast, five or six cups of 
flour, enough to make a soft dough. In the morning pre- 
pare one cap of butter, creamed ; add two cups of brown 
sugar, one tablespoonfid of mixed spices, — cinnamon, nut- 
meg, and allspice, — and/owr eggs, 3'olks and whites beaten 
separatel}'. Add this mixture to the beaten dough, and 
beat well. Add two cups of stoned and cJiopped raisins, or 
one cup of raisins, one cup of currants and half a cup of 
sliced citron. Flour the fruit. Let it rise in the bowl till 
light. Stir it down, and pour into two deep cake tins, 
making them two thirds full. Let it stand in a warm 
place fifteen or twent}' minutes, then bake one hour or 
longer in a moderate oven. 




Uses for Stale Bread. 

All bread crumbs left on the plates or bread board or in 
the bread jar, an^^ broken pieces not suitable for toast, 
and an}' crusts or trimmings of toast should be carefully 
collected in a pan by themselves, and dried (not browned) 
in the hot closet or in a moderate oven, then pounded in 
a mortar or rolled on an old bread board, sifted through 
a coarse sieve, and put awa}' in a dr}' place. These will 
be useful in covering anything which is to be dipped in Qgg 
and crumbs and then fried. Bread crumbs brown better 
than cracker crumbs, and are much cheaper, being made

Stale Bread Steamed. 

Have a large covered steamer fitting tiglitl}' over a ket- 
tle of boiling water. One with holes all over the bottom 
is best, as the steam condenses and runs down the sides 
and through the holes ; while in those with holes onl}' in 
the middle it forms little pools of water round the edge, 
which make the bread soggy. Do not put in the bread 
until everything else is read}', as it takes onl}' a few min- 
utes for it to become heated through. Arrange it all in 
the middle of the steamer, tilted against a small cup or 
dish so that the steam may pass between the slices. Do 
not let any of it touch the sides of the steamer, or it will 
become water-soaked. When ready to remove it, lift the 
cover quicklj', turning it over instantl}', that no water may 
drip on the bread. Spread each slice with butter as you 
take it out, and arrange them on a hot platter. Cover 
with a napkin and serve immediatel}'. Stale biscuit may 
be made much nicer than new in this wa}'. These direc- 
tions ma}' seem needlessh' minute ; but it is just these 
little things that make the difference between light, deli- 
cate, hot steamed bread, and the heav}', water-soaked 
stuff that is often served. 



Egg Toast, or Bread Sauted. 

1 egg. I 1 cup milk. 

1 saltspoonful salt. | 4 to slices stale bread. 

Beat the egg lightl}' with a fork in a shallow pudding- 
dish ; add salt and milk. Soak the bread in this until soft. 
Turn the slices b}' putting those underneath on the top, 
and dip the custard over them, being careful not to break 
them. Have a griddle hot and well buttered. Brown 
them on one side ; then put a piece of butter on the top of 
each slice, and turn and brown on the other side. To be 
eaten hot with butter, also with sugar and cinnamon if 
liked. This is one of the nicest ways of freshening stale 
bread, and is especiall}' convenient when the fire is not in

order for toasting. It is called French, Spanish, German, 
and Nun's Toast ; but Egg Toast seems to best indicate 
the character of the dish. When fried in deep fat, it may 
be used as a pudding by serving with a sweet sauce, and 
is then called Italian Fritters. 

Brown Bread Brewis. 

Break one pint of dry brown bread and half a cup of stale 
white bread into inch pieces. Put a tablespoonful of butter 
in a large frying pan, and when it is melted, but not brown, 
add the bread and cover with one pint or more of milk. 
Let it simmer, stirring occasionally to keep it from stick- 
ing, until the bread is soft and the milk absorbed. Salt 
to taste. 

Brown Bread Brewis, No. 2. 

Mix the same proportion of bread with one fourth of a 
cup of butter in a double boiler ; add 7nilk to cover, and cook 
over hot water without stirring until the bread has absorbed 
all the milk. If the bread be very dry, more milk will be 
needed. 

Toast. 

Bread is toasted, or dried and browned, before the fire 
to extract the moisture and make it more palatable and 
digestible. If the slices be cut thick and carelessl}- ex- 
posed to a blazing fire, the outside is blackened and 
made into charcoal before the heat can reach the inside ; 
the moisture is only heated, not evaporated, making the 
inside dough}^ or clamm^^, and when spread with butter, 
which cannot penetrate the charcoal, but floats on the sur- 
face in the form of oil, it forms one of the most indigestible 
compounds. The correct way is to have the bread stale, 
and cut into thin, uniform slices about one quarter of an 
inch thick. The fire should be clear, red (not blazing) 
coals. The crusts maj" be removed or not according to 
your taste, or the purpose for which the toasr is intended. 
If you require onl3' one or two slices, a toasting-fork will

answer ; but if a larger quantity be needed, there is nothing 
better tlian a double broiler with wires about a third of an 
inch apart. Place the slices evenly on one side of the 
broiler, being careful not to put in more than can be 
equally exposed to the fire ; close the broiler and hold it 
firml}', that the slices may not slip ; move it gently over the 
fire for one or two minutes ; then turn it over, that all the 
moisture may be drawn out ; hold it nearer to the coals, 
and color it a delicate golden-brown. Serve at once in a, 
toast rack or piled lightlj^, that it may not lose its crisp- 
ness. Butter before serving, or send it dr}^ to the table. 
Bread properly dried and toasted is changed from the 
nature of dough, which alwaj's has a tendency to sour on 
the stomach, into pure wheat farina. It is not so scorched 
as to turn the butter into oil, but absorbs the butter ; and 
butter and farina, being easily separated, are quickly acted 
upon by the gastric fluid. Many persons prefer toast that 
is soft inside, but it should never be served to sick people 
in that manner. It is better to have it dry, and then mois- 
tened with milk or water, than to have it doughy. If the 
bread be freshly baked and 3'ou must make toast, dry the 
slices in a warm oven before toasting. Alwa3's toast over 
the coals, or in the oven. If toasted over a hot stove, the 
crumbs fall through and burn, giving it a scorched and 
smoky flavor. 



Milk Toast. 



1 pint milk, scalded. 

1 t&blespoonful cornstarch. 

1 large tablespoonf ul butter. 



1^ teaspoonf ul salt. 
6 slices dry toast. 



Scald the milk ; put the butter in a granite saucepan ; 
when melted, add the dr}' cornstarch ; when well mixed, 
add one third of the milk. Let it boil, and stir constantly 
till it is a smooth paste ; add the remainder of the milk 
gradualh% stirring well ; then add the salt. Put the toast 
in a hot deep dish ; pour the thickened milk between each 
slice and over the whole. Keep the dish over hot water 
until ready to serve. If liked very soft, the slices may be

first dipped in hot salted water, or in the hot milk before 
it is thickened. 

Cream Toast. 

Cream toast may be made in the same way, using a 
scant Uihlespoonful of hutter^ and cream instead of milk, 
or b}' thickening the boiling cream with one tahlesjjoonful 
of cornstarch wet in a little cold milk or wa^er4-.tiien salt 
to taste, and boil eight or ten minutes. 

Water Toast. 

Have a shallow pan with one quart of boiling water and 
a teaspoonful of salt. Dip each slice of dr}^ toast quickly 
in the water, then pile on a hot platter. Spread evenl}^ 
with butter and serve very hot. Do not let them soak an 
instant in the water. 

Toast for Garnishing, 

For poached eggs, cut the bread into rounds with a 
large cake-cutter before toasting. For small birds or as' 
paragus, remove the crusts and cut into oblong pieces 
For minces and fricassees, cut into small squares or dia- 
monds. For a border, cut, after toasting, into inch and a 
half squares, and then into halves diagonally, making tri- 
angles ; or cut into long pointed triangles. 

Entire Wheat Bread, Made Quickly. 

Put one teaspoon of butter and half a teaspoon each 
of sugar and salt in one cup of scalded milk. When cool, 
add half a cake of compressed yeast dissolved in one third 
of a cup of lukewarm water. Stir in fine wliole-wheat flour 
till stiff enough to keep in shape after you stop stirring. 
Mix it well, but do not knead it. Let it rise to double its 
bulk, then knead it just enough to shape it into a long 
thin roll. When light and double, bake in a hot oven 
about thirty minutes. Mix in the morning and it will 
be baked before dinner.

SODA BISCUIT, MUFFINS, GEMS, ETC. 

In making biscuit, etc., our grandmothers used saleratus, 
an alkali prepared by exposing pearlash, i. e., purified 
potash, to carbonic acid gas. Potash is a fixed alkali 
made from wood ashes. Now soda bicarbonate, made 
from common salt, is generally used. 

Crude soda is known as sal-soda or soda-saleratus ; 
when refined, it is carbonate and bicarbonate of soda. 
But the purest soda obtained to-day is that made from 
Kryolith, a mineral found only in Greenland. It is 
called Natrona Bicarbonate of Soda, and is an ingredient 
of the purest baking-powders. 

Pure, strong alkalies are powerful corrosive poisons, 
eating the coats of the stomach perhaps quicker than any 
other poisonous agent. This caustic or burning property 
is somewhat weakened hy the carbonic acid united with 
them, and is therefore less in bicarbonate of soda than in 
the potash compounds. The latter are now seldom used. 
Alkalies when properly combined with acids lose this poi- 
sonous property- ; the carbonic acid gas is liberated, and 
the compound formed by this union is called a neutral salt, 
being neither acid nor alkaline. When not properly com- 
bined, if the acid be stronger than the alkali, tu? salt is 
acid ; and if the alkali be in excess, the salt is alkaline and 
still poisonous. 

Soda has a great affinity for water; and when wet, a 
combination takes place which allows some of the carbonic 
acid gas to escape. This may easil}" be seen b}' the eflfer- 
vescence which occurs when soda is dissolved in hot water. 
This, the old way of using soda, was theoreticall}^ wrong, 
as much of the gas was lost ; 3'et practicall}' good results 
were obtained, becanse the saleratus formerh' used was 
much stronger than the bicarbonate of soda of to-day, and 
could well be weakened. 



ISoda and Cream of Tartar, 



Soda alone, when mixed with wet dough, will give ofT gas 
enough to raise the dough ; but it leaves a strong alkaline 
taste and a greenish jellow color, and, being poisonous, 
must be neutralized b}' an acid, or else its use is not ad- 
missible. The best acid for this purpose is one which does 
not liberate the gas instantly on contact with the soda, 
before the heat can fix the air cells, and also the one 
which leaves no unwholesome residue. 

Muriatic Acid, which is sometimes used, would be the 
best, as it leaves onl}' common salt as a residue ; but the 
gas is liberated instantl}^, and onlv a skilled hand can mix 
the bread and place it in the oven without losing much 
of the gas. 

Cream of Tartar, which is tartaric acid combined with 
potash, and is obtained from the crj'stals or argols which 
collect in wine casks, is preferred by chemists. Being 
only slightl}' soluble in cold water, it unites w^ith soda 
only when heated, and the gas is not all liberated until 
the mixture is in the oven. The residue from the union 
is Rochelle salt, wiiich is not injurious taken occasionally 
in small quantities. The objections to cream of tartar are 
these : being very expensive (the price var} ing with the 
grape crop), it is often adulterated with cornstarch, flour, 
or other substances ; and the careless cook guesses at the 
proportions of soda needed instead of measuring accu- 
rately. The only safe way to use these chemicals is to 
purchase cream of tartar of a reliable grocer, and to 
measure carefully one level teaspoonfal of soda to tivo 
sUffhthj rounded teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar for one 
quart of flour. It takes a trifle more than twice the 
quantity of cream of tartar to make the reaction complete. 
The soda must be finely pulverized before measuring; 
rub it on the board with a knife, measure, and then sift 
through the finest wire strainer into the flour. Sifting 
with the flour through an ordinary flour sieve is not 
enough. Cream of tartar does not become lumpy like 
soda ; but it is better to sift it, and salt also, into the 
flour, and then sift all together two or three times.

82 The Boston Cook Book. 

Baking-Fowders. — The most reliable and conveuieut 
quick leaveuiDg agent is a pure cream of tartar baking- 
powder. If pure, it will contain only soda bicarbonate 
and cream of tartar mixed by weight in the correct pro- 
portion, and combined with the least possible amount of 
cornstarch or flour necessary for its perfect keeping. 
Any amount of starch above this is an adulteration as 
truly as if some harmful substance were used. Baking- 
powders having their formula printed on the label of 
their tins, may be relied upon. Biscuits made without 
eggs require two level teaspoons of baking-powder for 
each cup of flour. Muffins and rich cakes with eggs, 
from one and one-half to one level teaspoon for each 
cup of flour or meal. 

Soda is also neutralized by sour milk or lactic acid. 
This is economical, particularly for those who have 
plenty of pure milk. But milk in winter grows bitter 
before it sours ; and the degree of acidity varies so much 
that the result is often failure. Sour milk is best when 
it sours quickly, and is thick and smooth, not separated. 
One even teaspoonful of soda to one pint of nicely thickened or 
loppered milk is the proportion. When the milk tastes 
or smells sour, but is not thick, use it as sweet milk in 
gingerbread or brown bread, where j'ou have molasses to 
complete the acidit3\ Add a very little more soda if 
the receipt call for sweet milk, or a little less if for sour 
milk. 

Nearty all kinds of soda biscuit, muffins, gems, etc., 
should have the dry ingredients mixed in one bowl, and 
the liquids, such as milk, eggs, melted butter, etc., in 
another ; and when read}^ to bake, stir the two quickl}^ and 
thoroughly together, and bake immediately in a very hot 
oven. 

Molasses gives another acid which is combined with 
soda, to raise and lighten dough. Directions for its use 
are given under rules for brown bread and molassea 
gingerbread. 



Baking-Powder. 83 



Soda and Cream of Tartar Biscuit. 



2 full teaspoonfuls cream of 

tartar. 
1 large tablespoonful butter. 



1 quart sifted flour. 

1 even teuspoonful salt. 

1 even teaspoonful soda, meas 

ured after pulverizing. 

Milk to make a very soft dough : new-process flour will take a 
pint or more; St. Louis flour, less. 

Mix in the order given, sifting the soda, salt, and cream of 
tartar into the flour. Then sift all together twice. Rub in 
the butter with the tips of the fingers, until there are no 
large lumps. Mix in the milk gradually, using a broad 
knife and wetting onl}- a small part of the flour with each 
addition of the milk. When just stifl" enough to be handled 
(not kneaded), cut it through with the knife until barely 
mixed ; it should look spongy in the cuts and seem full of 
air. Turn it out on a well-Jioured board ; toss with the 
knife till well floured ; touch it with the hands as little as 
possible ; pat it with the rolling-pin, which must be lifted 
quickl}^ that it may not stick ; and when the dough is 
about half an inch thick, cut it into rounds and bake 
at once. 

To make Twin Biscuit^ roll the dough out less than half 
an inch thick, cut into rounds, spread with softened but- 
ter, and put two together, and bake ten or fifteen minutes. 

Baking-Powder Biscuit. 

These are made in the same way as the preceding, 
using three rounding teaspoonfuls or eight level of 
baking-powder in place of soda and cream of tartar. 

Sour Milk Biscuit. 

These should be made the same as cream of tartar bis- 
cuit, using one pint of thick sour milk instead of sweet 
milk, and omitting the cream of tartar. Observe the same 
directions as to lightness and dexterity in mixing, and 
vary the amount of milk according to the flour.

Mix the salt, soda, and cream of tartar with the flour, 
and sift two or three times. Rub in the butter until fine 
like meal, or if Uked very short and crisp, melt the butter 
and add it hot with the milk. Add the liquid gradually, 
mixing and cutting with a knife, and use just enough to 
make it of a light spongy consistency. Scrape out the 
dough upon a well-floured board ; toss it with the knife 
until floured ; pat into a flat cake, and roll gently, till half 
an inch thick ; cut with a small round cutter, and bake on 
the griddle or in the oven. If you use a griddle, grease 
it well with salt pork or butter, and cook the cakes slowly ; 
watch and turn them, that all may be browned alike. 

1 4 level teaspoons baking-powder may be used instead of soda and cream 
of tartar. '

When they are well puffed up, put a bit of butter on the top 
of each, and turn over, — -or move them to one side and 
grease again with the pork, and turn over upon the freshly 
greased place. When browned on the other side and 
done, of which you can judge by the firmness of texture 
or by pulling one partly open, serve immediately. Tear 
them open, as cutting with a knife makes them heavy and 
indigestible. If to be baked in the oven, put them quite 
close together in a shallow pan, and bake ten or fifteen

each ring ; cook until brown and well risen, then turn ring 
and muffin together, and brown the other side. Pull them 
apart, never cut them. This same mixture, when risen and 
baked in a buttered pudding-dish in which it is to be 
served, is the old-fashioned Sally Lunn. Cut with the 
point of a warm knife. If intended for breakfast, make a

water to a veiy stiff dough. Knead ten minutes, or until 
well mixed ; then beat hard with a biscuit beater or heavy 
rolling-pin, turning the mass over and over until it begins 
to blister and looks light and puffy, or " till, pulling off a 
piece quickl}', it will give a sharp, snapping sound." When 
in this condition, pull off a small piece suddenly, form 
it into a round biscuit, then pinch off a bit from the top. 
Turn over and press with the thumb, leaving a hollow in 
the centre. Put the biscuit some distance apart in the 
pan. Prick with a fork. Bake twent}' minutes in a quick 
oven. The}' should be light, of a fine, even grain, and

Waflaes, Griddle-Cakes, Pancakes, etc. 

The names pancakes, fritters, flap-jacks, slap-jacks, 
batter-cakes, griddle-cakes, slappers, etc., are applied in- 
discriminateh' in diflferent localities. 

Pancakes were formerl}' a kind of muffin mixture, made 
a little stiffer than a drop batter, but not stilT enough to 
roll out, and were dropped from a spoon into hot fat. and 
fried like doughnuts. But, recentl}', the name has been 
applied to a very thin batter made usuall}^ without soda, 
cooked one cake at a time on a small well-buttered fr} ing- 
pan, and turned like a griddle-cake ; then buttered, and 
rolled over and over, or spread with sugar and jell}', and 
then rolled. In "ye oklen time" good cooks were sup- 
posed to have the knack of tossing the pan so skilfully 
that the cake would turn over itself ; but this is now one 
of the lost arts. 

For convenience and clearness, the following names will 
be used in this work : — 

Griddle- Cahes : any kind of small, thin batter-cakes 
cooked on a griddle. 

Pancakes : larger, thin batter-cakes, made without soda, 
and cooked in a small frying-pan. 

French or Rolled Pancakes : the same as the preceding, 
buttered, sweetened, and rolled. 

Fried Drop Cakes or Fried Muffins : an}' muffin mixture, 
dropped from a spoon into deep hot fat. 

Fritters: a_ thinner mixture made without soda, either 
plain or with meat, fish, or fruit, and cooked by dropping 
into deep hot fat.

Waffles and Griddle- Cakes. 

A waffle irou is made of two corrugated iron gi'iddles 
fitted and fastened together at one side with a hinge, and 
revolving in an iron frame, which is to be placed over the 
fire. It ma}' be either circular or oblong. Each griddle 
is divided into compartments, which are usually- grooved 
into diamonds, hearts, rounds, etc. 

The iron should be placed over the fire, heated on each 
side, and greased thoroughl}', as it is very hard to clean 
if the cakes stick. Put a piece of salt pork on a fork, or 
put a small piece of butter in a clean cloth, and rub all 
over both griddles. The heat will melt the butter and let 
just enough of it go through the cloth. This is better 
than to put it on with a knife. Close the griddles and 
turn them ; this causes the fat to run evenl}' over them. 
Open, and pour the waffle mixture into the centre of the 
half over the fire, or put a spoonful in each compartment, 
filling them about two thirds full. Cover, and cook one 
minute on one side, then turn and cook a little longer 
on the other. An}- kind of griddle-cake mixture, with 
the addition of the melted butter to make them crisp, 
may be cooked on a waffle-iron, if one cares to take the 
extra trouble. 



Waffles.

last. Serve with butter, or s3Tup, or caramel sauce. 

Lemon Syrup (served with Waffles). 

1 cup sugar. I 1 teaspoonful butter. 

1^ cup water. J 1 tablespoonful lemon juice. 

Boil the sugar with the water until it thickens slightly. 



Grriddle- OaJces. 99 



Add the butter and lemon juice. Serve as soon as the 
butter is melted. 



Raised Waffles. 

Mix at night one pint of milk^ one third of a cuj) of yeasty 
and one pint of flour. In the morning add half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt^ two eggs, yolks and whites beaten separately, and 
one tablespoonful of melted butter. 

Use only one egg^ make the batter a trifle thinner, and 
fry on the griddle, and you have Flannel Cakes. 

Either of these receipts ma}' be varied by using half or 
one third fine white corn meal or Graham flour with the 
white flour. If intended for tea, mix in the forenoon. ,

To Cook Griddle-Cakes. '-''■:.:,^^' 



A soapstone griddle, which needs no greasing, is the 
best ; but of whatever material, let it be large enough to 
hold seven cakes. Let it heat while you are making the 
cakes. If an iron griddle be used, put a piece of salt pork 
two inches square on a fork ; and when the griddle is 
hot enough for the fat to sizzle, rub it all over with 
the pork. Just grease it ; do not leave little pools of fat 
on the edge to burn, and smoke the cakes. Take up 
a tablespoonful of the mixture, and pour it from the end 
of the spoon. The mixture should hiss or sizzle as it 
touches the griddle. Put one in the centre and six 
around the outside. By the time you have the seventh 
cake on, the first one will be fall of bubbles and ready 
to turn ; and when the seventh is turned, the first will 
have stopped puffing and be done. Wipe the griddle 
with a dr}' cloth, and grease again after each baking. 
Turn 3'our griddle often, bringing each edge of it in 
turn over the hottest part of the stove, that the cakes may 
cook evenly. Always mix wafl[les or griddle-cakes in 
a bowl with a lip, and beat up the mixture well between 
each baking. 



lOO The Boston Cook Book. 



Griddle-Cakes. 



1 pint flour. 

}■£ teaspoonful salt. 
1 teaspoonful soda. 



1 scant pint sour milk or cream. 

2 eggs, well beaten. 



Crush, measure, and sift the soda and salt into the 
flour. Mix thoroughl}'. Add the milk, and beat well ; 
then add the beaten 3'olks, and lastly, the whites, beaten 
stiff. Bake on a hot, well-greased griddle ; turn when 
full of bubbles, and bake on the other side till they stop 
puffing. Use 07ie half or one third Jine corn meal or Gra- 
ham flour ^ to make a variet3\ 

To make Huckleberry Griddle- Cakes ^ add 07ie pint of 
berries, picked over and rolled in flour. 

Some persons prefer to mix the sour milk with the 
flour, and let the mixture stand over night. In the morn- 
ing add the salt, soda, and eggs. 

Sour milk is the best for griddle-cakes, and when thick- 
ened just right, the cakes are very good without the eggs. 



Rice or Hominy Griddle-Cakes (no Soda). 

2 eggs, yolks and whites beaten 

separately. 
1 tablespoonful melted butter. 
Flour enough to make a thin 

batter. 



1 cup sweet milk. 

1 cup warm boiled rice, or fine 

hominy. 
3^ teaspoonful salt. 



Bake either as griddle-cakes or waflies. 



Bread Griddle-Cakes. 



1 pint stale (not dried) bread- 1 1 pint milk, scalded, 
crumbs. | 1 tablespoonful butter. 

Pour the hot milk over the crumbs, add the butter, and 
soak over night or till the crimibs are softened. Then 
rub through a squash strainer ; add 



2 eggs, yolks and whites beaten 

separately. 
1 cup flour. 



Jo teaspoonful salt. 

2 level teasp. baking-poAvder. 

Cold milk to thin it if needed. 



Bake slowly : spread with butter and sugar, and serve hot. 



Buckivheat Calces. lOi 



Raised Graham Griddle-Cakes. 

Mix o?ie pint of milk^ scalded and cooled, one cup of 
whole-wheat Jiour^ one cup of white jiour, one fourth of a cup 
of liquid yeast. Let it rise over night. In the morning 
add half a teaspoonful of salt^ one tablespoonful of mo- 
lasses^ one saltspoonful o? soda. If too thick, add a little 
warm water. These are more wholesome than buckwheat 
cakes. 

Buckwheat Cakes. 

Pour one pint of boiling ivater on half a cup of fine 
corn meal; add half a teaspoonfd of salt. Mix well, 
and when lukewarm add half a cup of white flour^ one 
cup of buckwheat flour ^ one fourth of a cup of yeast. Beat 
vigorously. Let it rise over night. In the morning stir 
down, and beat again. When risen and read}' to bake, 
add one saltspoonful of soda, sifted through a line strainer. 
Beat again, and fty in large cakes. 

Buckwheat cakes, even if not sour, usually' require the 
addition of soda just before baking, to make them light and 
tender. But when in their best estate, the}' are far from 
perfect food. The}- should be eaten only in ver}- cold 
weather, and but seldom even then. They are better and 
orown better when made with boiling milk instead of 
water. 

Com Meal Slappers, or Griddle-Cakes (no Soda). 

1 pint corn-meal. I 1 sahspoonful salt. 

1 teaspoonful butter. | 1 teaspoonful sugar. 

Pour into this mixture boiling milk or water enough 
to wet the meal. When cool, add two eggs, well beaten, 
and cold milk enough to make a ver}' thin batter.

Take green pease which have been boiled, but are too 
hard to eat as a vegetable. Drain very dr}', then mash,

1 cup flour. 



Pour the boiUug milk into the squash ; add the butter, 
sugar, and salt. When cool, add the agg^ well beaten, 
then the baking-powder, mixed and sifted with the flour. 
If too thin, use more flour; and if too thick, add a little 
milk. The dry mealy squash is the best. 

French Pancakes (no Soda). {Miss Parloa.') 



3 eggs. 

1 cup milk. 

J^ teaspoonf ul salt. 



1 teaspoonful sugar. 

}'2 cup flour. 

% tablespoonful salad oil. 



Beat the yolks and whites separately. Add the milk, 
salt, and sugar to the yolks. Pour one third of this mix- 
ture on the flour, and stir to a smooth paste. Add the 
remainder of the milk, and beat well ; then add the oil. 
Heat and butter a small ftying-pan, and pour into it 
enough of the mixture to cover the pan ; when brown, 
turn and brown the other side. Spread with butter and 
sugar or jelh- ; roll up, and sprinkle with powdered sugar. 

Fried Drop Cakes. 

The fat for fried cakes should be clean, new fat, half 
lard and half clarified beef drippings. By new fat is 
meant fat that has not been used for meat or fish, or be- 
come browned b}- previous frying. The same fat may 
be used several times by clarifying with several thin 
slices of raw potato, and straining through a fine strainer 
after each frying. When it becomes too brown for any 



Friea Mvffins.

mixtures, it will answer for croquettes or fish balls. 



flour 

It should be very hot, and still, not bubbling ; but not 
as hot as for mixtures which have been previously cooked. 
The surest way is to fty a bit of the mixture. It should 
rise at once to the surface, with much spluttering of the 
fat, swell, and begin to brown on the under side. Drop 
cakes will nsuall}- turn over themselves, but doughnuts 
and fritters should be turned. They should be cooked an 
even golden brown, and the fat be kept at the right tem- 
perature by moving the kettle farther from or nearer to 
the fire. Try them with a fork, and if it come out clean, 
they are done. 

Drain each cake over the hot fat, and when the}' cease to 
drip, put them in a squash strainer placed in a pan on the 
back of the stove, or drain on soft brown paper, 
the first cooked to another pan when the next are ready 
to be taken out. If the fat be not hot enough, or if there 
be too much soda, doughnuts will absorb the fat. The 
alkali in them unites with the grease, as it does in making 
soap. The eggs will prevent the cakes from soaking in the 
fat, and it is healthful and more economical to use them.

"Wonders, or Cheats. 

Beat one egg ; add one saltspoonful of salt and enough 
flour to make a very stiff batter. Roll out as thin as a 
wafer, cut with large round cutter, and ivy one minute in 
hot fat. Serve with honey or syrup, or with cream and 
jelly, or any delicate pudding sauce. 

Henriettes. 



1 egg, yolk and white beaten sep- 
arately. 
1^ cup cream. 
1 saltspoonful salt. 



1 saltspoonful baking-powder. 
lo sahspoonful cinnamon. 
1 teaspoonful wine or brandy. 
Flour enouarh to roll out. 



Roll as thin as a wafer, and cut with a pastry jagger 
into small squares or diamonds. Fry in boiling lard. 
Drain, and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Or add less 
flour, make a thick, stiff batter instead of a dough, and 
press the batter through a pastry tube into boiling lard, 
making rings or any shape preferred. 



i cup flour. 

1 saltspoonful salt. 



Cinci, or Rags. 

^ cup boiling water. 
1 egg. 



Pour the boiling water gradually upon the flour and salt, 
and stir to a smooth paste ; cool, add the egg, and beat 
well. Press through a pastry tube into hot lard. Drain, 
and sprinkle with sugar. 



Fritter Batter (for Oysters, Clams, or Fruit). 

Tolks of two eggs, beaten well ; add half a cup of milk or 
water, and one tablespoonful of olive oiU one saltspoonful of 
salt, and one cup of jiour, or enough to make it almost a 
drop batter. When ready to use, add the whites of the 
eggs, beaten ver}' stiff. If intended for fruit, add a tea- 
spoonful of sugar to the batter. If for clams, tripe, or meat, 



Fritters, 107 



add one table spoonful of lemon juice or vinegar. This bat- 
ter will keep several days. 

Oyster Fritters. — Boil the 03'sters till the liquor flows 
freely. Drain, strain the liquor, and use it to make a bat- 
ter, as in the preceding rule. Dip each oyster in the 
batter and fry until brown in hot fat. 

Clam Fritters. — Drain the clams, and chop the hard 
part. Use the liquor to make a fritter batter. Add the 
clams and fty by small spoonfuls in hot fat. Clams in the 
shell should be steamed and dressed. Drain, and dip each 
whole clam into the batter. If large and tough, chop the 
hard part, and use the same as raw clams. 

Apple Fritters. — Core and pare three or four apples., 
but do not break them. Cut them in slices one third of 
an inch thick, leaving the opening in the centre. Sprinkle 
with sugar., lemon ^ and spice. Dip each slice in the fritter 
batter and fry in hot fat. Drain, and sprinkle with pow- 
dered sugar. 

Vegetables for fritters, such as celery, salsify, or parsnip, 
should be boiled till tender, then drained and cut into 
small pieces ; then stir them into the fritter batter. 

Swedish Timhale Cups. — Make one half the recipe for 
Fritter Batter, without separating the eggs, put the batter 
in a cup, heat the timbale iron in hot fat, then low^er it 
into the batter about one inch, turn it partly over as you 
take it out, plunge it into deep hot fat, and when browned 
slightly, remove, drain, and remove cup from the iron. 

Parmesan Fritters., for Soup. — Boil four tablespoons of 
water (or five of milk) with one rounded tablespoon of 
butter and a pinch of salt. Stir in quickly one third of a 
cup of flour ; when well mixed, remove ; add three table- 
spoons grated Parmesan ; cool, and add three unbeaten 
eggs, reser\ang one white. Beat well, and drop in bean- 
like bits from a teaspoon into deep hot fat. Cook till a 
light brown, drain, and serve with cream soups.

OATMEAL, INDIAN CORN, AND OTHER 
GRAINS USED AS FOOD. 

Oatmeal is highl}^ nutritious, being richer in nitrogen 
than any other grain ; but a^ it does not contain a tough, 
adhesive gluten, like wheat, it is not easily' made into fer- 
mented bread. Its nitrogenous matter resembles casein 
more than gluten, and is called avenin (from avena^ the 
oat). It is used as a mush or porridge, eaten with sugar 
and milk. It is rich in food for muscle and brain, useful 
for children and laboring people, but irritathig to mau}^ 
})eople whose digestive powers are weak. 

Groats, or Grits^ are oats from which the outer husk and 
inner flint}^ cuticle are removed. 

Indian Corn is used in manj' forms. Some varieties 
which contain a large proportion of sugar, are eaten green 
from the cob as a vegetable. The whole grains, hulled, 
are eaten as samp ; broken grains of various sizes, as 
homin}^ ; the ground grains, as either coarse or fine meal. 
Meal grows musty very quickly when ground by the old 
process, owing to the moisture of the corn and the heat of 
the stones. In the new-process, or granulated, meal the 
corn is first dried for two years, then ground into coarse 
grains like sugar. Indian corn is also used in the form of 
a very fine powder, called cornstarch. Corn meal, when 
cooked, is best made into small loaves or cakes and eaten 
hot. It is rich in nitrogen, and contains more fat than 
the other grains. This causes it to attract the oxygen 
from the air, and spoil rapidly. It should be purchased 
in small quantities. It is better adapted to strong labor- 
ing people, as it is ver}^ heating for persons with weak 
digestion. 



Cereals. 



109 



Rye meal and flour are used, more especially in New 
England, in the form of bread and mush. Rye is sweeter 
than wheat, and makes a moist bread which can be kept 
for some time without becoming hard and unpalatable. 
Rye should be purchased in small quantities, kept in a cool, 
dry place, sifted and examined thoroughly before using. 

Barley is used in soups and sometimes in gruels. It 
cannot be made into good bread, as it has too little gluten. 
It is nutritious, being rich in phosphates. It contains 
starch and mucilage, and, in the form of gruel, makes a 
soothing drink in fevers. The husk is removed, the 
grains are ground and polished, and then it is termed 
Ijearl barley. Barley crystals or flakes and granulated 
barley are also used. 

Buckwheat has less flesh-forming and more heat-giving 
elements than wiieat. It is therefore suitable only when 
used in cold weather and by those who labor hard or exer- 
cise freely. It is used principally in the form of griddle- 
cakes. 

Rice contains very little of the flesh- forming element' 
It has more starch and less fat than any other grain. It 
is cheap, and is largely used by people in very hot cli- 
mates. It should always be used with milk, esgs, or 
some fatty substance. Rice 



'^osrg; 



used with milk, eggs, 
is easily digested. 



Oatmeal Mush. 

One cup of B. B. oatmeal, and one teaspoonful of salt., to 
a scant quart of boiling water. Put the meal and salt in 
the top of the double boiler ; add the boiling water. Place 
the upper boiler on the stove, and boil rapidly eight or ten 
minutes, stirring occasionall}^ with a fork. Then place it 
over the hot water, and cook from fort}' to sixt}' minutes if 
liked dry, from two to three hours if liked very soft. Re- 
move the cover just before serving, and stir with a fork to 
let the steam escape, to dry it off". Served with baked 
apples and sugar and cream. 

Oatmeal comes in three grades. B. B. is the whole oat 
with the outer husk removed. It is less past}* than the 



I lo The Boston Cook Book. 

finer grades. The Scotch consider the coarse oatmeal the 
best, the finer kinds being onl}' suitable for children and 
invalids. 

Oatmeal, rice, or an}" mush that contains much starch, 
is more easil}^ digested if it is masticated, and mixed with 
the saliva. When eaten as a soft porridge and still fur- 
ther thinned with milk, if it be swallowed whole, the saliva 
has no chance to do its part, and tlie whole process of the 
digestion of the starch is left for the intestines. The meal 
should be thoroughly cooked, stiff, and drj', rather than 
thin. 

Hominy^ cracked wheats and granulated reheat are cooked 
in the same way, using only three cups of boiling water 
instead of one quart. 

The cracked wheat ma}" be poured into a mould wet with 
cold water, and when jellied eaten cold with sugar and 
cream. 

Whole wheat requires five cups of boiling water to one 
cup of wheats and should cook six hours. 

Hasty Pudding, or Indian Meal Mush. 

Put one quart of water on to boil. Mix one pint of corn 
meal, one teaspoonful of salt, and one tablespoonful of fiour 
with one pint of cold milk. Stii' this gradually into the 
boiling water and boil half an hour, stirring often. Eat it 
hot, with milk, and only in cold winter weather. 

Fried Hasty Pudding. 

^ ook as above and pour it into a brickloaf pan ; when 
cool, cut into three-quarter inch slices. Dip them in fiour., 
and brown each side in hot fat in a frying-pan. Or dip 
in crumbs, egg, and again in crumbs, and//-y in deep fat. 

Any of these mushes may be fried the same way. 
When eaten with bacon, they make a nice relish for 
breakfast. 



Tea. 1 1 1 



BEVERAGES. 

Tea. 

There are three varieties of the tea-plant ; both black 
and green tea can be prepared from them all. Green 
tea is made from young leaves steamed, roasted, and 
dried quickly on copper plates. Black tea is made from 
leaves which have been exposed to the air ten or twelve 
hours before roasting. The action of the air upon the 
leaves during this long exposure causes the dark color. 
Green tea gives up less of its juices in drying, and this 
accounts for its energetic action on the nervous sj'stem. 

The tea-leaf contains the largest amount of nutritive 
matter of an}' plant used as human food, though onlj^ 
a small portion of it is extracted b}' our common method 
of making tea. There is a large proportion of casein in 
the leaves. Many of the savage tribes of Tartar}^ boil the 
leaves with soda, and eat them with salt and butter. But 
in our method of using tea as a beverage merely, we use 
such a comparatively small quantit}' that the amount of 
nutriment is very little ; its chief value being the sense 
of warmth and comfort that it gives. It excites the brain 
to increased activit}', and })roduces wakefulness ; hence it 
is useful to students and night- workers. It retards the 
action of the natural functions, causes less waste, and, to 
a certain extent, saves food. For this reason, when not 
used in excess, it is suited to poor people, whose suppUes 
of substantial food are scant}' ; and to old persons, whose 
powers of digestion and whose bodily substance have 
begun to fail. It should not be used early in the morning, 
as the body needs immediate nourishment in a larger 
quantity ; and it should at all times be taken moderately, 
both as to quantity and strength. 



112 The Boston Cook Book. 

The water should be freshly boiled. Scald and heat 
the teapot, which should be of eartheu or china, never of 
tin. Allow one teaspoonful of tea for one cup of boiling 
water. Reduce the proportion of tea when several cups 
are required. Put the tea in a strainer, pour through it 
half a cup of boiling water to cleanse the grounds. Then 
put the tea in the teapot ; pour on the boiling water ; 
cover closely and place it where it will keep hot, but 
not boil, for five minutes. If cold or lukewarm water be 
used in making tea, the thein^ or nitrogenous substance, 
will not be obtained. 

In boiling tea or allowing the leaves to remain long in 
the tea, by repeated steeping, the fragrant aroma is wasted 
and the tannin is extracted, which may cause gastric dis- 
orders to those who drink it. Never make tea in a 
tin teapot, as the tannic acid acts upon the metal and 
produces a poisonous compound. 

A slice of lemon is a good substitute for milk in tea. 
The lemon prevents the headache and sleeplessness which 
the tea causes in some persons. 

A French chemist recommends grinding tea like coffee. 
It will yield nearl}' double the amount of its exhilarating 
quality. Also to put a lump of sugar into the teapot 
with the tea. 

Iced Tea, or Russian Tea. 

Make the tea by the first receipt, strain it from the 
grounds, and keep it cool. When ready to serve, put two 
cubes of block sugar in a glass, half Jill with broken ice^ add 
a slice of lemon, and fill the glass with cold tea. 

Coffee. 

Coffee grows on small trees. Mocha, the best variety, 
is grown in Arabia. Other choice kinds come from Java, 
the West Indies, and South America. The fruit of the 
coffee tree is something like the cherry, and contains two 
seeds or beans. Bruising the fruit separates the berries, 



Coffee, 113 

which are then washed and dried. The raw berries are 
tough, dillicult to grind, and have but little flavor. Coffee 
should be roasted and kept in air-tight cans, that the fine 
flavor ma}' be perfectl}' developed and preserved. Coffee 
is more stimulating than tea, and, when taken very stroiig 
after a heart}' meal, aids digestion. It should be made in 
such a way that the full strength and aroma are obtained, 
without developing the tannic acid. This is done by pour- 
ing boiUng water upon the coflTee and keeping it in a 
closel}" covered vessel just below the boiling-point, or 
boiling not longer than five minutes. If allowed to boil 
longer, or left uncovered, the volatile oil which forms the 
fragrant aroma is dissipated, and the tannic acid extracted. 
This acid, when combined with cream or milk, forms a 
leather}', indigestible compound which irritates the internal 
membranes. 

The proportion of one third Mocha and two thirds Java 
coffee is agreeable to most people. Many prefer to roast 
and grind the coffee for themselves ; but in coffee-houses 
the arrangements for roasting are now so complete, that it 
is well for small families to buy coffee alread}' roasted, 
and to grind it as needed, or buy it ground in a smaU 
quantity. 

The coffee-pot should be of granite ware or porcelain, 
and kept scrupulously clean, cleansing the spout as well 
as the pot every time it is used. A brownish deposit is 
soon formed on the inside of the pot, if the coffee be 
allowed to stand in it long, or if it be not often scoured. 
Many a cup of ill-flavored coffee is owing to its having 
been made in an unclean pot. 

The proportions are, one heaping tahlespoonful of coffee 
to one cup of boiling water^ reducing the proportion 
slightl}^ when several cups are required. Half a cup of 
ground coffee is enough for one quart of water ^ and will 
make sufficient for five people. It takes a greater pro- 
portion of coffee and water, and it is more difficult to 
make just enough for one person than for more, as the 
last coffee poured out is not as clear as the first. The 



114 The Boston Cook Book, 

old notion of allowing extra for the pot is not without 
reason. 

Fish glue or inferior isinglass, which can be purchased 
at a druggist's, is a cheap and convenient article to use in 
clearing coffee. Egg shells should be saved and used for 
the same purpose. Wipe the eggs as soon as they come 
from the market, and then the shells may all be used. Two 
or three shells contain albumen sufficient to clear a quart 
of coffee. 

Various modifications of the biggin, or French coffee-pot, 
are in use, and the coffee made in them is excellent, as 
none of the aroma is wasted. They are general!}- quite 
expensive, and some soon get out of order, if not handled 
carefulh\ The spout of the coffee-pot should be closed 
with a cork, or a thimble fitted for that purpose, or a piece 
of soft brown paper twisted so as to form a stopper. This 
prevents the escape of the steam and aroma. Coffee, if 
allowed to boil, should stand at least ten minutes after 
boiling, to give it time to settle and become clear. 

Roasting Coffee. 

Put one pound of raw coffee in a small ftying-pan. Place 
it on the stove, and shake and stir occasional!}' for fifteen 
minutes, or till yellow. Then cover it, and increase the 
heat, and shake till the kernels are all a deep cinnamon or 
chestnut color, and have an oily appearance. Be careful 
that none are burned. Keep it covered, and when still 
warm, not hot, add one egg and its shell. Beat until every 
kernel is coated with the egg. The egg will dry quickly. 
It helps to preserve the flavor, is the cheapest form in 
which to use egg for clearing, and does not interfere with 
the grinding of the coffee. 

Coffee should be" kept in air-tight tin cans, and ground 
onl}^ as required. The finer it is ground, the stronger will 
be the extract. 



Coffee. 



Coffee (Common Coffee-Pot). 

1 heaping tablesp. ground coffee. I 1 egg shell. 

1 square mch isinglass, or | 1 cup freshly boiling water. 

Scald the coffee-pot. Put in the coffee and isinglass. 
Add the boiling water. Cover the spout, and boil just five 
minutes. Stir it well. Set the pot on the back of the 
stove, where it will keep hot, but not boil. Add half a cup of 
cold water. Pour out a httle of the coffee and pour it back 
again to clear the grounds from the spout. Let it stand 
at least ten minutes. If served in the pot, be careful not 
to roil the coffee by shaking the pot or b}' careless pour- 
ing. A tablespoonful of caramel mixed with the ground 
coffee gives additional flavor and color. 

Steamed Coffee. 

The same proportions as in the preceding rule. Place 
the coffee-pot in a kettle of boiling water, or make the 
coffee in a granite double boiler kept express!}' for that 
purpose, and steam twenty minutes. Pour it from the 
grounds into a hot coffee-pot for serving. 

Coffee made with Cold Water. — Put the required propor- 
tion of cold water and coffee into a china or granite coffee- 
pot, cover closely, and let it stand over night. In the 
morning let it just come to the boiling-point, and serve at 
once. J"--, needs no straining nor clearing. {Miss Devereux.) 

Coffee made with an Egg. 

One egg is sufficient to clear one cup of ground coffee. If 
a smaller quantit}' be desired, half an egg may be used, as, 
if fresh, the remainder will keep till the next day. Or the 
whole egg may be beaten with the ground coffee, and such 
portion of it used as is needed, keeping the remainder 
closely covered. 

To make the coffee^ add half a cup of cold water to the 
portion of egg to be used and one third of a cup of coffee. 




Ii6 The Boston Cook Book, 

Beat .well ; put it in the hot coffee-pot ; add one pint of 
boiling water and boil five minutes. Keep it hot, but not 
boiling, for ten minutes. Pour out a little and pour it 
back to clear the spout. 

FUtered Coffee. 
This is made in a French biggin, or an}- double coffee- 
pot fitted with one or more strainers. The coffee, which 
is gi'ound very fine, is placed in the strainer ; this is put 
into the receptacle for holding the made coffee, the boiling 
water is poured in and allowed to drip slowly through the 
coffee. If there be only two parts to it, the coffee-pot 
should stand where the coffee will keep hot, but not boil. 
Many of the coffee-pots made on this principle are placed 
in another vessel containing boiling water. 

To serve Coffee. 

Oream, scalded milk, and block sugar are essential to good 
breakfast coffee. Put in one taUespooiiful of cream and two 
tablespoonfids of milk, and fill the cup three fourths full. 
Never fill to overflowing. Let each person add the sugar 
desired, unless 3'ou know the individual tastes of the fam- 
\\y. The milk should be just hot, but never boiled, as 
boiled milk gives a very unpleasant flavor. 

After-dinner coffee, or black coffee, is made by either of 
the receipts previously' given, using double the proportion 
of coffee : two heaping tablespoonfids of coffee to one cup of 
water. It should be ver}' strong and perfectl}- clear ; served 
in small cups, with block sugar if desired, but not with 
cream or milk, as the milk counteracts the purpose for 
which the coffee is taken. 

The addition of three tablespoonfuls of whipped cream to a 
cup of coffee gives Vienna Coffee. An equal amount of 
boiled milk and filtered coffee is called Cafe au Lait. 

Cocoa and Chocolate. 
Cocoa is the fruit of a small tree which grows in Mexico, 
Central America, and the West Indies. The fruit is shaped 



Cocoa. 117 

like a large, thick cucumber, and contains from six to 
thirty beans. The beans are roasted, like coffee. The 
husks or shells are taken off, and used in that form as 
cocoa shells. The}' need longer boiling, and are preferred 
b}' many persons with weak digestion. The}^ are some- 
times ground with the bean, making an inferior article of 
cocoa. Starch is also used to adulterate cocoa. The best 
cocoa is made from the whole bean after the husk is re- 
moved. Cocoa nibs are the beans broken instead of 
gi'ound. 

Chocolate is the finelj^ ground powder from the kernels 
mixed to a stiff paste with sugar, and sometimes flavored 
with vanilla. It is the most nutritious and convenient form 
of cocoa ; a small cake of it will satisfy hunger. It is a 
very good lunch for travellers. If the oily scum which 
forms on the surface after boiling be removed, it is less 
indigestible. 

Chocolate does not produce the injurious effects which 
render tea and coffee objectionable, and is far better for 
children and working-people. 

Cocoa. ^'^ 

Put half a cup of broken cocoa into a pot with tivo quarts 
of ivater. Boil gently two hours, until reduced to one 
quart ; or use half cocoa and half shells. Serve with sugar 
and cream, or scalded milk. It is more digestible if allowed 
to cool and the globules of fat removed, then reheated. 

Prepared Cocoa. 
This ground cocoa comes in many forms, and some are 
recommended to be prepared at the table ; but all kinds 
are better boiled oiie minute in a very little water, the same 
as chocolate, and thinned with hot milk. 

Shells. 
Steep one cup of shells in one quart of boiling water three 
or four hours, adding more hot water as it boils away. 
Strain, and serve with hot milk, or cream and sugar. 



Ii8 The Boston Cook Book, 

Chocolate. 

Put one square of Baker's chocolate^ two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar ^ two tablespoonfuls of hot water ^ and a pinch of salt in 
a small saucepan, and boil until smooth ; stir constantly ; 
add gradually one pint of boiling water ^ and when ready to 
serve add one pint of hot milk. Use all milk and two squares 
of chocolate^ if liked richer ; or thicken with one teaspoon- 
fid of cornstarch wet in a little cold water ^ and boil five min- 
utes before adding the milk. 

German, or Sweetened Vanilla Chocolate. 

Melt two sticks of chocolate in two or three tablespoonfuls of 
hot water. Stir to a smooth paste ; add gradual ojie pint 
of hot milk and stir or mill it five minutes. Serve in cups 
three quarters full with two or three tablespoonfuls of ivhipped 
cream on the top. Sweeten and flavor the cream before 
whipping. 

Hot Milk. 

Heat the milk over boiling water until it is barely hot, 
but not scalded. Test the heat by tasting. Shake in a 
few grains of salt, and sip it by the teaspoonful. One of 
the best " nightcap drinks." 

Lemonade. 

Boil one cup of sugar and one pint of water ten minutes ; 
add ihin shavings of the yellow peel of one lemon, and 
pour it hot over the juice of three lemons. When cold, 
strain it, and add chipped ice and water as desired. 

Fruit Punch. 

Boil two cups of sugar and one quart of water twenty 
minutes. Pour it boiling hot over the following mixture : 
half a cup each of lemon and orange juice, one cup of 
strawberry juice, half a cup of canned cherry syrup, 
and one cup of chopped pineapple. When ready to 
serve, strain it, dilute with ice water, and add one cup 
of fresh strawberries quartered, one banana sliced, and 
iialf a cup stoned cherries. Dilute with Apollinaris if 
preferred. 



Soup, 119 




SOUP. 



Nothing can be easier than to make a good soup if 
one only knows hoio and has the will to do it ; and if one 
will, it is easy to know how. Considerations of econ- 
omy and healthfulness make it the dut}' of every house- 
keeper to thoroughly inform herself on the few essential 
points in soup-making. When these are learned it will 
be as simple as any other duty. 

As soups are not made from nothing^ a supply of mate- 
rials should always be kept on hand, such as dried sweet 
herbs (which ma}' be purchased at any city market for a 
trifle ; twent3'-five cents' worth will last a j^ear or more) ; 
also whole^ as well as ground spices; and, more particu- 
larly, fresh vegetables, — onions^ carrots^ and turnips. If 
we had access to the French market, we could buy the 
smallest amount whenever it might be desired ; but as 
onl}^ a few marlvctmen in America will sell a single onion 
or a single carrot, it is well for those who cannot cultivate 
for themselves to purchase in large quantities. They 
may be kept in a cool place by covering with clean sand. 
Parsley may be grown in the house if 3'oa have a sunny 
window ; and we can all have salt and pepper. Now, 
having these seasoning materials alwaj'S at hand, 3'ou 
may easily find other material in the store-room, or from 
the day's supplj^ of fresh meat, fish, etc., without buying 
expressly for soup ; that is, if you, instead of the market- 
man, have the bones and trimmings. 

Ever}^ pantry should have a " catch all." It is vastly 
more important there than in the sewing-room or on the 
toilet-table. The coal-hod, refuse [)ail, and sink catch all 
in many households. One or two large bowls — not tin, 
but deep earthen dishes, provided they are sw^et and do 



I20 The Boston Cook Booh 

not leak — will better answer the purpose. After breakfast 
or dinner, do not put away the remnants of steaks or 
roasts on the platters, but look them over and put by 
themselves any pieces that can be used again, either cold 
or in what are called made dishes. Then put all the bones, 
trimmings, fat, gristle, and everything, especially the 
platter gravy, which usually flavors the dish-water, into 
the " catch all." If 30U have just one bone from a steak 
or chop, if it be not bui^ied it is worth saving, and in cool 
weather will keep till 3'ou have another. If there be a 
tablespoonful of anj^ vegetables, a stalk of celer}^, an egg^ 
baked apple, or a bit of macaroni, put them away neatly. 
You will find a use for them. If 3'ou have boiled a fresh 
tongue, a fowl, a leg of lamb, or a cup of rice, plan to 
make a soup also, and thus save the water. This economy 
may be carried to the extreme of saving the water In which 
cabbages, beans, or potatoes have been boiled, or of keep- 
ing a fire several hours in a hot day only to save a few 
cents' worth of bone, or of spoiling all the soup b}' adding 
a spoonful of turnip alread}^ sour ; but as a rule we err in 
the opposite practice. 

Soups are made from meat, fish, and vegetables, with 
water or milk ; seasoned or flavored with an}" or every 
kind of vegetable, sweet herbs, spices, cnvvj powder, 
catchups, aromatic sauces, and with some kinds of fruit. 
They are served thin and clear, or thickened with vegeta* 
bles or cereals, and with or without meat. 

Soups are classifled and named in various ways, accord- 
ing to material, color, qualit}', etc. Soups ivith stock have 
meat as the basis. Soups without stock are made of flsh, 
vegetables, and milk. They are sometimes called soup 
maigre. Soups are named from the principal ingredient, 
or an imitation of the same, as Potato, Onion, Beef, 
Mutton, Chicken, Gumbo, Macaroni, Okra, Ox-tail, Gib- 
let, Cock-a-leekie, Lobster, Mock Turtle, Mock Bisque, 
etc. ; or from the color, as Clear, or Amber, Brown, and 
White ; or from the consistency, as Thin soups and Purees ; 
or from the qualitj^, as simple Broths, Bouillon, and Con- 



Stock, 121 



somme ; or from the season of the 3'ear, as Julienne ; 
or from the people who use them, as Scoteh Broth, Freneh 
Pot-aa-feu, Indian Mullagatawney ; or from the name of 
the makers, or in any way one's fanc}' and invention may 
suggest. But from the scores, 3'es, hundreds of receipts 
in the cook-books, which seem so bewildering to the be- 
ginner, a few simple rules may be deduced which will 
make the process of soup-making intelligible ; and when 
once the foundation is laid, you ma}' build and enlarge as 
you choose. 

Do not be discouraged because you have not all tlie 
dozen or more ingredients mentioned in most receipts. * 
You will find man}' of them may be omitted with a per- 
fectl}' satisfactorj' result. Much depends upon what is 
omitted, though, as Potage a la Reine without chicken, or 
Julienne without vegetables, or Mullagatawney without 
curr}' pow^ler, would disappoint those who think only 
of the name ; but, called by any other name, you would 
find them very good soups. : 

Soups with Stock. 

Soups made with stock include all the varieties made 
from beef, veal, mutton, and poultr}'. Perhaps a glance 
at the meaning of the word stock will make clear its appli- 
cation to cooker}'. Stock is from the Anglo-Saxon sticicm, 
to stick, and the idea of fixedness is expressed in all its 
forms. Stock in trade or business means the money or 
material laid bj-, or stored, stocked, fixed, us a source of 
supplv, ready for use at an}' time ; and in the business 
of soup-making, stock is the material stored or prepared 
in such a way that it may be kept or fixed for use in 
making difl[*erent kinds of meat soup ; or, more definitely, 
it is a liquid containing the juices and soluble parts of 
meat, bone, and vegetables, which have been extracted 
by proper cooking. This liquid is more or less solid when 
cold, according to the gelatinous nature of the ingredients. 
It varies greatly in quahty, owing to the manner in which 
it is prepared and the material used. 



122 The Boston Cook Book, 

Stock is usuall}' made from the cheaper, inferior parts 
of meat, which 3'ield the most nutriment when cooked in 
this wa}^ ; also from odds and ends of cooked meat, 
which perhaps could not be used otherwise. The chief 
object in making stock is to obtain in the quickest manner 
the largest possible amount of nutriment from the cheap* 
est parts of meat, and after getting it to keep and use it. 
This is best accomplished by observing the following 
rules : — 

Fh^st. Cut the meat into small pieces, and soak them 
in cold water before heating, that every atom of nourish- 
ment may be extracted. Cold water draws out and 
dissolves the meat juices, while hot water hardens the 
albumen on the outside of the meat and prevents the 
juices from escaping into the liquid. 

Second, Use a careful selection and proportion of meat, 
bone, and water, and season judiciouslj^, so that no one 
flavor will predominate. 

Third. Use a steam-tight kettle, and simmer^ — not boil 
the material rapidl}', — that the juices may be retained in 
the water, and not wasted b}' evaporation. 

Fourth. Make stock the da}^ before using, if possible, 
that the fat may be more easil}' removed ; but do not give 
up making it simply from 'Mack of time," for it can be 
made quickl}'. 

A soup digester is the proper vessel for making stock. 
This is a porcelain-lined iron kettle with a bale, and hav 
ing a cover fitting closel}' into a groove, so that no steam 
can escape except from the valve in the top of the cover, 
which at once indicates when the water is boiling rapidly. 
One holding six quarts, and costing three dollars, is a con- 
venient size for a small family. If you cannot afford a 
digester, get a granite ironware kettle, with a tightly fit- 
ting cover. Plain ironware will do if 3'ou have nothing 
better; but it rusts easil}', and, if tin-lined, the tin melts 
in careless usage. 

The meats used in making stock should contain gelatine^ 
osmazome^ and a small amount of fat ^ 



Stock. 123 

Gelatine is found in tlie bones, skin, tendinous and gristly 
portions of flesh, especially in veal. It is this which causes 
the stock to become a jell}'. But a soup which forms a 
jell}-, or is made principall}' from bones, is not the most 
nutritious. The jell}- of bones and shiews boiled into soup 
can furnish only jelly for our bones and sinews. It is use- 
ful in convalescence, for then the portions of the system in 
vvhich gelatine is needed have been wasted ; but in other 
cases, though easily digested, it is unwholesome, for it 
loads the blood with disturbing products. It is entirely 
destitute of flavor, and therefore we need with it meat con- 
taining osmazome. 

Osmazome is that part of meat which gives to each of the 
various kinds its distinctive flavor. It is more abundant 
in brown than in white meats, and in the meat of old 
rather than in that of young animals. It is found largely 
in lean beef, mutton, and fowls. Osmazome is more highly 
developed in roasted meals ; therefore all the bones and 
remnants of roasts which cannot be utilized in entrees^ 
should be put into the soup-kettle. 

We need also the alkaline and acid salts found in the 
blood and juices of the flesh ; therefore a small portion of 
raw^ lean meat should form a part of all stock. 

Fat is necessary, as an element of perfect food, and 
should always be used in making stock. It adds to the 
flavor, and all that is not absorbed in the stock may be re- 
moved when cold. The marrow^ found in the shin bone, 
is the best form of fat. The browned fat of roast beef 
gives a fine flavor, and occasionally a bit of ham or bacon 
may be used. But all mutton fat should be avoided, be- 
cause of its rankness. 

These four kinds of meat — beef, mutton, veal, and poul- 
try — may be used together or separately. It is better to 
use mutton, if in a large quantity, by itself, as the flavor 
is disagreeable to many. After having extracted all the 
nutriment from the meat In its juices, fat, albumen, and 
flavor, do not attempt to make further use ol' the worthless 
residue of muscular fibre. It is not only harmful, but dry, 






124 The Boston Cook Booh 

tasteless, and utterly' useless as food. It needs the addi- 
tion of many other materials to make it palatable even, 
and it is cheaper to get the fi brine we need from meat 
cooked in other ways, directions for which will be given 
under Boihug Meats and Stews. Therefore do not hesi- 
tate, as a matter of economy', to throw away this useless 
meat. 

When fresh meat is bought expressly for stock, select ? 
piece from the shin or lower part of the round of beef or 
veal. This has bone with marrow, a large proportion ot 
gelatine, more or less osmazome, according to the amount 
of flesh, and costs less than other parts. In mutton, pieces 
from the neck and forequarter are the best. Fowls are 
better than chickens. With this fresh meat may be used 
the bones and trimmings from steak or chops, and the 
flank ends of roasting pieces, which 3ield more nutriment 
if added to the stock pot before being cooked. Add also 
any remnants of roasted or broiled meat, bone, fat, gristle, 
anything except mutton fat. In families where large roasts 
of beef and poultr3' are often used, there should be mate- 
rial enough for stock, without bujing new meat, except for 
the nicest of clear soups, which the French call Consomme. 

The proportions of bone and meat should be about equal 
b}' weight. When read}^ to begin the stock, wipe the fresh 
meat with a clean cloth wet in cold water. Never put 
the meat in a pan of cold water to soak. It takes out all 
the juices that 3'ou wish to save. Wipe before cutting. The 
inside is clean. But rinse the cloth and scrub the outside 
thoroughl}'. Cut awa}- the parts that are tainted or dis- 
colored b}' rust}^ meat-hooks, etc. Examine all the odds 
and ends of cooked meat, and remove au}^ smoked or 
burned parts from ham or broiled meat, also the stuffing 
and skin from roast poultr}', if 3'ou wish to have the stock 
clear. Scrape the meat clean from the bones and cut into 
inch pieces. Break or saw the bones as small as you con- 
veniently can. Remove the marrow (a soft, fatty sub- 
stance, which 3'Ou will find in the hollow of the bones) and 
put it in the soup kettle to keep the bones from sticking. 



Stock, 125 

Put in the bones and pack the meat around them. Place 
your kettle on the back of the range before adding tlie 
water, so that there need be no heav3" weight to lift. Allow 
one quart of fresh cold water to every pound of meat and 
bone ; one fourth less water if your stock is to be made 
altogether of cooked meats, or if 3'ou use a digester. Cover 
the kettle, and after the water is quite red, and the juices 
are well drawn out, draw the kettle forward and let it heat 
slowl}', and simmer^ or boil slowl}', but never boil hard. 

The scum, which soon rises on the surface, is the albu- 
men and juices of the meat which have been drawn out 
and mixed with the cold water. They coagulate, or har- 
den, as the water heats, and, being lighter than the water, 
rise to the surface in the form of scum. It has usually 
been considered essential, in making soup, to remove every 
particle of this scum ; but the practice is wholly unnecessary 
and wasteful. We learn, in the article on Boiling, the 
three distinct purposes and methods of cooking meat in 
water ; and yet in skimming a soup we act directly con- 
trary to the general principle there explained. If the kettle 
be clean, the water pure, and the meat well cleansed from 
anj' impurities on its outer surface, what can there be in 
the meat not suitable to eat, any more than in roast beef, 
or steak, or boiled mutton? In making beef tea we are 
directed b}- the highest scientific authorities to remove the 
fat, cut the meat small, soak it in cold water, heat gradu- 
ally, and never skim, as the scum or thickened material in 
the water is the ver}^ thing desired. Soup is onl}' another 
form of beef tea, and the fat which is objectionable can 
better be removed when the stock is cold. These juices 
and soluble parts of the meat should be retained ; they 
increase, rather than diminish, the flavor, and all the sedi 
ment which is fine enough to go through the strainer 
should be used. In any thickened soup it is so mingled 
with the other ingredients as not to be unpleasant to the 
e3'e. And for those who wish clear soups, which are not 
as nutritious, this sediment can easily be removed in the 
clearing. 



126 Tlie Boston Cook Book. 

lu a criticism which so decidedl}' rejects a prevailiDg 
custom, it ma}' be well to remark that the method of pre- 
paring soups which is recommended in the preceding 
paragraph has been snccessfullj' proved in the Boston 
Cooking School for the last three years. The French, who 
regard skimming as very important in making their Pot- 
au-feu^ remove the meat as soon as tender, and serve it as 
bouiUi^ or boiled heef. As it has not been cut in small 
pieces, and is heated quickly, some of the juices are re- 
tained in the meat, and it is nourishing and palatable. 
Their Pot-au-feu is more like our beef stew than like soup 
stock. 

In the preparation of the stock, the next step is to add 
the seasoning, which ma}' be used in these proportions : 
For every quart of water, one even teaspoonful of salt, two 
peppercorns or half a saltspoonful of ground pepper^ two 
doves ^ two allspice berries, one fourth of a saltspoonful of 
celery seed or a bit of celery root^ a sprig of parsley, a 
teaspoonful of mixed herbs, and a tableapoonful of each 
vegetable. 

Herbs and spices are better whole than ground, as they 
may be more readil}^ removed b}' straining. The French 
cooks use a bouquet of herbs, made with two leaves or 
blossoms of each herb wrapped in a sprig of parsley and 
tied securely so that it may be easil}' removed. A con- 
venient and economical wa}^ is to strip off the leaves and 
blossoms, break the stalks in tiny pieces, mix them, and 
keep in a tin box. Use sage, summer savory, thyme, marjo- 
ram, and bay leaves: a teaspoonful of the mixture (not 
of each herb) for every quart. The vegetables generally 
used are onion, carrot, turnip, and celery. It is better to 
omit them entirely in warm weather, or if 3'ou wish to 
keep the stock more than a week, as the vegetable juices 
ferment quickl}' and sour the stock. 

Wash, scrape, or pare the vegetables ; cut them into 
small pieces for convenience in measuring, as one onion 
or one slice of carrot is rather indefinite. Keep them 
in cold water until the juices are drawn from the meat. 



Stock. 127 



When old or strong, tliey ma^' be blanched or parboiled 
first. 

Onions, potatoes, and cabbage should alwaj's be scalded 
to draw out the indigestible qualities. Some object to the 
use of onions, particularly on account of the disagreeable 
odor ; but when added with the other seasoning material, 
they are so completel^^ absorbed in the stock that no 
trace of their presence can be detected. All or part of the 
vegetables may be fried first, if 3'ou like. One or two 
sour apples give a pleasant flavor to stock. Wines or 
catchups should be added just before serving, as boiling 
dissipates the flavor. 

If 3'Ou wish to have a dark hrown stocky reserve part of 
the lean meat to brown with the onions. Fr}^ the onions 
in a little fat, and when ver}- brown remove them, to pre- 
vent burning, and brown the meat in the same fat. Add 
the onions and meat to the stock. Take a little water 
from the stock, and wash ofl" all the browned glaze ad- 
hering to the ftying-pan, as this is the best part. A table- 
spoonful of browned sugar or caramel (see page 134), 
which should alwa3's be kept on hand, will also give a 
rich dark color. After the seasoning is placed in the 
mixture, put the kettle where it will keep at a gentle, 
steady simmering. Do not let it boil furiouslv one half- 
hour and not at all the next, but find the place on the 
range where it will keep at just the right temperature, and 
then, if you have a steady fire, it will need no furthei 
attention until ready to strain. It is hot enough if the 
water just bubbles on one side of the kettle. 

When the stock has simmered till the meat is in rags 
and the bones clean, strain at once. Do not let it stand, 
if in an iron kettle. If you have used a digester or steam- 
tight kettle, the water will not have lessened much. If 
boiled in an ordinary kettle, it will be reduced about one 
half b}' evaporation, and ma}' be diluted when ready for 
the table. Strain in this way. Place a stone jar beside 
your kettle. It should be of a size suited to the amount 
of stock. Put a colander over the jar (it should fit inside 



f 



F [

it), and a strainer cloth over tlie colander. Then, with 
a ladle or dipper, dip the contents of the kettle and pour 
into the strainer. Never tr}' to lift the kettle and pour 
it out, unless you have more strength and skill than most 
beginners. When you have only a pint left, you may try 
the pouring. Do not squeeze the cloth, but let the con- 
tents drain ten or fifteen minutes, then throw the scraps 
awa}'. Remember that 3'ou have extracted all the nutri- 
ment, and have it in the water ; so do not expect to have 
any virtue in the meat or vegetables. Set the jar in a 
cool place, uncovered, but not in the ice chest while hot. 
It keeps better to cool quickly. In cold weather, and if 
you have used a large proportion of bone, the stock will 
harden like jelly, with a cake of solid fat on the top. This 
fat, by excluding the air, helps to keep the stock, and 
should not be removed until the stock is needed. In 
winter stock will keep a week, and longer, if made without 
vegetables. It should be heated occasionally to the boil- 
ing-point, or after taking off an}^ portion of it, that what 
remains may harden again in an unbroken form. A little 
fresh charcoal tied in a bag and boiled with the stock is 
said to restore it when only slightly changed. 

In very warm weather, make only enough for each day, 
as sometimes it spoils in one night. If 3'ou wish to make 
a soup while the stock is still hot, put what portion you 
may need into a shallow pan and place the pan in ice 
water, with a larger pan of ice water over it. This will 
soon harden the fat ; or if 3'ou have not time to do this, 
take off what fat you can with a spoon, and wipe off the 
remainder with soft tissue paper, or strain several times 
through a fine napkin. The grease will adhere to the 
napkin, which should be rinsed in cold water. That 
hardens the fat. Or you may let the soup bcil gently, 
and nearly all can be taken off. 

To remove the fat after the stock has jellied, rim a knife 
around between the cake of fat and the jar. If the fat be 
solid, it will sometimes come off whole ; but if soft, take 
off all you can without cutting into the jellj^, then wring 



Clearing Stock, 1 29 

a clolli out of ver}' hot water, and wipe the stock. The 
hoi cloth w . absorb the fat readily. Remember, if the 
soup is to be served clear, not a pin-head of fat must be 
left ; but if it is to be thickened with any starchy material, 
this will absorb what cannot be removed with a spoon. 
This fat must be saved and clarified according to direc- 
tions on page 18. 

With this stock for a foundation, 3'ou may make an 
sndless variet}^ of soups, each soup taking its name from 
the principal sohd ingredient ; and it is equally valuable to 
use, instead of water, in making gravies or sauces. No 
matter how little 30U have, one cupful is worth more than 
it costs to make it, as an addition to fricassees and braised 
meats. This stock, if properl}' made and strained, will be 
sufficientl}' clear for an}^ common soups. But for clear 
sparkling soups and aspic jell}', it must be clarified with the 
white of an Qgg. 

To clear Soup Stock. 

Remove the fat, and allow the ivhite and shell of one egg 
for every quart of stock. If you wish to flavor the stock 
more higlil}', add half a saltspoonfnl of celery seed and the 
thinnest possible shavings from the rind of half a lemon} 
Add also the lemon juice, and more salt and pepper if 
needed. Mix celery seed, lemon, Qgg, etc. with the cold 
stock, and beat it well. If the stock be hot when the ^gg 
is aided, tbe Qgg will harden before it has done its work. 
This is a point where man}^ fail. Set it over the fire and 
stir it all the time, until it is hot, to keep the egg from 
settling. Then leave it, and let it boil ten minutes. By 
this time a thick scum will have formed, and as it breaks 
the liquid will be clear and sparkling, like wine, and darker 
than before. Draw it back on the stove, and add half a 
cup of cold water. Let it stand ten minutes, w^hile you 
get your jar, colander, and fine napkin read}' for straining. 
Wring your napkin out of hot water, and lay it over the 
colander. Put the finest wire strainer on the napkin and 
then pour it all through. This strainer will catch the scum 

1 Clear soup should be highly seasoned, as clearing destroys some of the 
strength. 



I30 The Boston Cook Book. 

and shells which would otherwise clog the nankin. Let it 
take its own time to drain ; but if 3'ou must h ten it, raise 
the napkin first at one corner, and then at another, and let 
the liquid run down to a clean place. This is better than 
squeezing. This is all ready to serve as a clear soup by 
simph' heating to the boiling-point. Serve with it, in the 
tureen, thin slices of lemon, a glass of sherr}', 3-olks of 
hard-boiled eggs, or delicate flavored force-meat balls ; or 
put on each plate a poached egg, or a spoonful of grated 
Parmesan cheese. 

In making soups from this stock, bear this fact in mind : 
Do not waste the stock by boiling in it an}^ material 
which requires long boiling. Vegetables, rice, sago, tapi- 
oca, macaroni, vermicelli, etc., should be cooked separately 
and then added to the stock, which should be brought to 
the boiling-point. 

The following are some of the principal varieties. 
These soups are all supposed to have no meat served 
with them. The broth is clear and thin, and every particle 
of vegetable or cereal should be distinct, except in the 
soups called Mixed Vegetable and Tomato.

Left-over Soup. 



Bones and trimmings from a 6- 

pound roast of beef. 
2 cold mutton-chops. 
The flank end of a sirloin steak, 

uncooked. 
4 quarts cold water. 
1 tablespoonful salt. 



4 cloves. 

4 peppercorns. 

1 cold fried egg. 

2 baked apples. 

1 cup cold boiled onions. 

2 stalks celery.

Cut up the meat and bones, and put them in the kettle 
with the cold water. Add all the other ingredients, and 
simmer till the bones are clean, the meat is in rags, and 
the water reduced one half. Strain, and the next morning 
remove the fat ; when ready to serve, heat the stock to 
the boiling-point ; warm with it one cup of cold macaroni 
or tomatoes left from yesterday's dinner. Add more salt 
if needed, and flavor with Kitchen Bouquet. 

Julienne Soup. 

1 quart stock. I ^'2 teaspoonful salt. 

1 pint mixed vegetables. \ % saltspoonful pepper. 

Cut the celery into thin slices, the turnip into quarter- 
inch dice, and the carrot into three-quarters by one- 
eighth inch strips or straws, using onl}' the orange part. 
Or cut carrot and turnip into quarter-inch slices, and 
then into fancy shapes with small vegetable cutters. 
Cover with boiling water, add half a teaspoonful of salt, 
and cook until soft, but not long enough to destroy their 
shapes. Let the quart of stock come to a boil ; add the 
vegetables, the water, and more salt if necessary-. Serve 
hot. In spring and summer use asparagus, peas, and 
string beans. It is quite important that the vegetables 
should be small and of uniform thickness ; but if an}' 
require a longer time to cook, they should be cut into 
smaller pieces. 



Brown Soups. 133 



Macaroni Soup. 



1 quart stock. 

3 or 4 sticks macaroni. 



1 teaspoonful salt. 

}/2 saltspoonf ul pepper. 



Cook the macaroni in boiling salted water, about half an 
hour, or until tender ; drain, pour cold water through it, 
to keep it from sticking together. Lay the sticks close 
together on a board, and divide them into eighth-inch 
pieces, making tiny rings, or cut them into half-inch 
pieces. There should be about a pint of macaroni for a 
quart of stock. Bring the stock to a boil ; add the maca- 
roni, the salt, and the pepper ; then pour all into the 
tureen. 

Vermicelli Soup. 

1 quart stock. I 1 teaspoonful salt. 

^^ cup vermicelli. j ^ saltspoonful pepper. 

The vermicelli may be broken or not, as you please. 
Cook about ten minutes in boiling salted water. Drain, 
put it in the tureen, and pour over it the boiling stock. 
Spaghetti and Italian Paste may be used in the same way. 



Rice, Tapioca, Sago, or Barley Soup. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

}2 saltspoonful pepper. 



1 quart stock. 

2 tablespoonfuls either rice, bar- 
ley, tapioca, or sago. 

Wash the grains, and cook until tender in boiling salted 
water ; then add them to the boiling stock. Serve with 
croiitons. Barley should be soaked one hour, and boiled 
two hours or more. Vegetables and macaroni are better 
with beef stock ; and rice, tapioca, and barley with mutton 
or chicken stock. 



Tomato Soup with Stock. 

1 can tomatoes. 
1 teaspoonful salt. 



1 quart stock. 

1 teaspoonful sugar. 

1 saltspoonful pepper. 

Stew the tomatoes until soft enough to strain. Rub all 
but the seeds through the strainer. Add the sugar, salt,

croutons. 

Carrot, or Crecy Soup. 



1 quart rich, brown stock. 

1 pint carrot. 

1 teaspoonful sugar. 



1 teaspoonful salt.- 
ig saltspoonf ul pepper. 
1 small onion, sliced. 



Wash and scrape the carrot ; shave off in thin slices a 
pint of the outer part. Do not use the yellow centre. 
Cook the carrot with the onion in boiling salted water to 
cover, till ver}' tender. Rub the carrot through a squash 
strainer. Add the stock and heat again. Add the sugar, 
salt, and pepper, and when hot serve immediately with 
croutons. 

Mixed Vegetajble Soup. 



1 cup strained tomatoes. 

1 tablespoonful chopped parsley. 

1 teaspoonful sugar. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

1 saltspoonf ul pepper. 



1 quart stock. 

1 quart boiling water. 

1 cup each chopped onion, carrot, 
and celery. 

y^ cup each chopped turnip, pars- 
nip, and cabbage. 

Use all or as manj' varieties of vegetables as you wish, 
or if you have only a few, add macaroni, rice, or barley, 
having in all half the amount of vegetables that 3'ou have 
of liquid. Chop all the vegetables fine. Cabbage, cauli- 
flower, parsnip, potatoes, or onions should be parboiled five 
minutes, and drained carefully. Fry the onions and car- 
rot; then put all with the water and stock, and simmer 
until tender. Add the seasoning. Serve without strain- 
ing. Alwa3's add sugar to all mixed vegetable soups. 

The next division of soups includes those which are 
thickened in various ways, and in which the meat is served 
with the soup ; also White Soups, and the materials to be 
served with soups. 

Caramel, for coloring Soups, etc. 

Melt one cup of sugar (either brown or white) with one 
tablespoonful of water in a frying-pan. Stir until it becomes 



The Boston Cook Boole. 135 

of a (lark brown color. Add one cup of boiling ivater ; 
simmer ten minutes, and bottle when cool. It gives a 
rich, dark color to soups, coffee, and jelly ; is more 
wholesome than browned butter in sauces, and is delicious 
as a flavoring in custards and pudding sauces. In many- 
kitchens Tournade's Kitchen Bouquet is preferred for 
soups and meat sauces to give flavor and color. 

Glaze. 

Glaze is simply clear stock boiled down to one fourth of 
its original amount. Put two quarts of rich, strong stock 
into a saucepan, and boil it uncovered until reduced to 
one pint. It should have a gluey consistency, and will

It is useful in browning meats which have not been colored 
b}- cooking, but which we wish to have the appearance of 
bavins: been roasted or browned. 




'O 



Thickening for Soups. 

Soups are thickened with flour, cornstarch, or rice flour : 
one tablespoonful for a quart of soup, — heaping, if flour ; 
scant, if rice flour or cornstarch. Flour is the cheapest, 
but cornstarch gives a smoother consistenc}*. Mix the 
flour with a ver}^ little cold water or milk until it is a smooth 
paste ; then add more liquid, until it can be poured easilj^ 
into the boiling soup. Remember to boil the soup fifteen 
or twenty minutes after the thickening is added, that there 
ma}^ be no raw taste of the flour. Where butter and flour 
are used, the butter is rubbed to a cream, mixed or braided 
with the flour, and then made into a paste with a little of 
the soup. 

A better waj' is to put the butter in a small saucepan, 
and when melted and bubbling stir in the flour quickly, 
until smooth (be careful not to brown butter for any 
white soup) ; then add gradually about a cup of the hot 
soup, letting it boil and thicken as you add the soup. It 
should be thin enough to pour. In vegetable soups or 
purees, as soon as the hot butter and flour are blended* 



136 The Boston Cook Booh, 

\hQy ma}' be stirred at once into the soup. This is what is 
meant in man}" of the receipts b}" tliickening with butter 
and flour which have been cooked together. The hot but- 
ter cooks the flour more thoroughl}' than it can be cooked 
in an}' other wa}'. When a brown thickening is desired, 
as in Mock Turtle Soup, melt the butter and let it become 
as brown as it will without burning ; then add all the 
flour at once and stir quickl}', that ever}' particle of it 
may be moistened in the hot butter ; add the water or 
soup graduall}'. 

Flour that is browned while dry, either in the oven or 
X)ver the fire, colors, but does not thicken. A certain 
amount of moisture, of either fat or water, is necessary 
with the heat to thoroughly swell the grains of starch in 
the flour. Thickened soups should be about the consist- 
ency of good cream. Purees are thicker. 

Material to be served with Soup. 

Croutons, or Fried Bread. Xo. 1. — Cut stale bread into 
half-inch slices, remove the crusts, and cut into half-inch 
cubes ; put them in a frying-basket, plunge into fat hot 
enough to brown them while you count forty ; drain and 
sprinkle with salt. They may be fried at any time and 
heated in the oven just before serving. They are espe- 
cially nice with pea and bean soup. 

No, 2. — Cut the bread into cubes, and brown in butter 
in an omelet pan ; or butter first, then cut into cubes and 
brown in the oven. They are best when prepared after 
the first receipt. 

Crisped Crackers. — Split butter crackers and spread with 
butter ; put them, the buttered side up, into a pan, and 
brown in a hot oven. They are delicious with white or 
vegetable soups, and in fish chowder and oyster stews. 

Egg Balls. 

Boil/o?^r eggs twenty minutes ; put them in cold water. 
When cool, cut carefully through the white, and remove 



SoifJJi: 



137 



the 3'olks whole. They may be served in the soup whoiQ 
or cut into quarters. Or put the yolks in a small bowl 
and rub them to a paste with a wooden spoon. Season 
with one salispoonfid of salt ; one fourth of a sal*spoonf,'U 
o^ pepper ; one teaspoonfal of melted butter. Moisten it with 
the beaten yolk or white of one raw egg^ using just enough 
to shape it easily into balls about the size of a walnut. 
Roll in flour and fry in butter ; the same as force-meat 
balls. They are sometimes boiled live minutes in the soup, 
but are better fried. 

Force-Meat Balls for Soup. 



i cup of any cooked meat. 

I saltsp. each of salt and thyme. 

Jo salispoonful pepper. 

1 teaspoonful lemon juice. 

i teaspoonful choi)ped parsley. 



Yolk of 1 raw egg. 
A few drops onion juice. 
1 tablespoonful flour. 
1 tablespoonful butter. 



Chop the meat very fine ; add the seasoning ; beat the 
yolk of the egg, and add enough of it to moisten the meat ; 
make it into balls the size of a nutmeg, put them in a soup 
plate, sprinkle them with flour, shake the plate until the 
balls are all floured ; put the butter in an omelet pan, and 
when l)rown [)ut in the balls, and shake the pan occasion- 
all}' until the balls are browned. 



Mock Turtle Soup. 



1 calf's head. 

4 quarts cold water. 

1 tablespoonful salt. 
6 cloves. 

6 peppercorns. 

6 allspice. 

I/O inch stick cinnamon. 

Bouquet of lierbs. 

2 onions. 



1 carrot. 

1 turnip. 
Celery root. 

2 tablespoonfuls butter. 

2 tablespoonfuls flour. 
1 pint brown stock. 

3 eggs. 

1 lemon. 



Wash, scrape, and clean the head, and soak an hour in 
qold water. Remove the brains and tongue. Lay them 



138 The Boston Cook Book, 

in cold water, to be reserved for separate dishes. Cut the 
head into four or fiA^e pieces, and put it into the kettle with 
the skin side up, to prevent sticking. Add the cold water ; 
heat slowly and skim thoroughly, as the meat is to be used 
again. Add the salt, and simmer two hours, or until the 
meat slips from the bones. Remove the meat, and put 
the face meat smoothly- on a plate, so it can easily be cut 
into dice when cool. Reserve the remainder of the meat 
for force-meat balls. Put the bones on to boil again. 
Add the herbs, spices, and vegetables, and simmer until 
reduced to two quarts. Strain, and set away to cool. 
HaJf an hour before serving, remove the fat, put the stock 
on to boil, and season with one saltspoonful each of ground 
thyme or marjoram and pepper, and one teaspoonful of salt. 
Make a brown thickening with two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
browned, two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch or flour, and 
one pint of brown stock. Stir this into the stock. Add 
one cup of meat dice, made bj' cutting the face meat into 
half-inch cubes. Boil the three eggs twent}^ minutes, and 
make the 3'olks into egg balls, or cut the whole eggs in 
half- inch slices. Make force-meat balls with the reserved 
meat, according to directions on page 137. Put the meat 
balls and egg balls into the tureen, add the soup, and serve 
very hot with thin slices of lemon. 

This is usuall}' flavored with a glass of sherr}^ wine, but 
is very good with onl}' the lemon, or a tablespoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce. Or you may boil with it one pint 
of strained tomatoes. 

If you have no brown stock, boil one pound of lean beef 
with the head, and use the head stock with the flour and 
butter thickening. This soup is often made from calf's 
feet, and one or two pounds of lean veal. The feet should 
be soaked and scalded, boiled in four quarts of water with 
the herbs, spices, and vegetables, until the water is reduced 
to two quarts. Strain, and use as directed in the first 
receipt, making force-meat balls of the veal, and meat 
dice from the gelatinous meat of the feet. 



Ox-Tail Soup. 



2 ox-tails. 

1 large onion. 

1 tablespoonf 111 beef drippings. 

4 quarts cold water. 



1 tablespoonful salt. 

1 tablespoonful mixed herbs. 

4 cloves. 

4 peppercorns. 



Wash and cut up the ox- tails, separating them at the 
joints. Cut the onion fine and fiy it in the hot beef drip- 
pings. When slightly browned, draw the onion to one side 
of the pan, and brown half of the ox-tails. Put the fried 
onion and ox- tails in the soup kettle, and cover with four 
quarts of cold water. Tie the cloves, peppercorns, and 
herbs in a small piece of strainer cloth, and add them to 
the soup. Add the salt, and simmer three or four hours, 
or until the meat separates from the bones, and the gristl}' 
portions are perfectly soft. Select some of the nicest 
johits to serve with the soup. Skim off the fat, and add 
more salt and pepper, if needed. Strain and serve very hot. 

If vegetables are served with this soup, add one pint of 
mixed vegetables, — onion, carrot, turnip, and celery. Cut 
them into small pieces, or into fanc3^ shapes with a vege* 
table cutter. Add them to the liquor after straining, and 
boil twenty minutes or until tender. 

Mullagatawny Soup. 

This is an Indian soup, and means " pepper pot." It 
can be made from veal, calfs head, chicken, or rabbit. 
Use one, or a mixture of two or more of these varieties 
of meat. Mullagatawny soup should alwa3'S be very highly 
seasoned with onions, curry powder, and apples, or lemons, 
or softie strong acid fruit. The best portions of the meat 
are usually removed as soon as tender, and served with the 
strained soup. Rice should also be served with this soup. 

3 pounds chicken, or young fowl. 2 sour apples, or 

1 pound veal bones. The juice of 1 lemon. 

2 onions. 4 quarts cold water. 
1 tablespoonful beef drippings. 1 tablespoonful curry powder 

4 cloves. 1 teaspoonful salt. 
4 peppercorns. .1 teaspoonful sugar. 



140 



The Boston Cook Book. 



Clean the chicken, and cut it at the joints into nice 
pieces for serving. Put it in the soup kettle with the veal 
bones, or an}' pieces of veax 3'ou ma}' have. Cover with 
four quarts of cold water. Slice the onions, and fry thein 
brown in the beef drippings. Put the onions, cloves, pep- 
percorns, and apples in the kettle. Mix the curry powder, 
salt, and sugar to a smooth paste witli a little of the water ; 
add it to the soup. Let the soup simmer until the chicken 
is tender. Remove the chicken and cut into small pieces. 
Put the bones back in the kettle, and simmer another hour. 
Strain the soup, remove the fat, and put the liquor on to 
boil again, with the pieces of chicken and three or four 
tablespoonfuls of boiled rice. When the chicken is hot, 
serve at once. 



Scotch Brotn. 



}^ cup pearl barley. 
2 pounds neck of mutton. 
2 quarts cold water. 
\^ cup each of carrot, turnif>, on- 
ion, and celery. 



2 tablespoonfuls butter. 

1 tablespoonful flour. 

2 teaspoonfuls salt. 

1 saltspoonful white pepper. 

1 tablespoonful chopped parsley. 



Pick over, and soak the barley over night or several 
hours in cold water. Wipe the meat with a clean wet 
cloth. Remove the fat and skin. Scrape the meat from 
the bones and cut it into half-inch dice. Put the bones on 
to boil in one pint of cold water, and the meat in three 
pints of cold water. Let tlie latter boil quickly, and skim 
carefully just as it begins to boil. When the scu.m comes 
up white, add the barley and skim again. Cut the vege- 
tables into quarter-inch dice, fry them five minutes in 
one tablespoonful of the butter, and add them to thenneat. 
Simmer three or four hours, or until the meat and barley 
are tender. Strain the water in which the bones have sim- 
mered. Cook one tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan 
with one tablespoonful of flour. When smooth, add the 
strained water gradually, and stir into the broth. Add 
the salt, pepper, and parsley. Simmer ten minutes, and 
serve without straining. Many people have a prejudice 



Broth. 141 

against mutton in stews or broths. The strong, disagree- 
able flavor lies mostly in the skin. If this be removed 
together with the fat, it will repay one for the time and 
trouble. As this broth is not to be strained, it is always 
well to boil the bones separateh\ Care must be taken not 
to let the water boil awa}'. This is a favorite dish among 
the Scotch. The}' often serve it with a larger proportion ot 
vegetables. The carrots are sometimes grated, giving the 
broth a fine color, and sometimes the dice of meat are first 
browned in the butter. Rice may be used instead of bar- 
le}'. Scotch broth made after this receipt has been tested 
by a native Scotchman, and pronounced more hke the 
*' auld countree " than an}- other dish eaten in America. 

Mutton Broth. 

Allow one quart of cold luater to each pound of meat and 
bone. Break the bones and cut the meat (which should 
be lean) into small pieces. Cover with cold water and 
heat slowl}'. Add one teaspoonfid of salt and half a salt- 
spoonfid of pepper^ and a small slice oi onion and turnip if 
3'ou like. Simmer until the meat is in shreds. Strain it, 
and when it is cool remove the fat. To one quart of the 
broth allow tivo tahlespoonfids of rice^ washed and soaked 
half an hour. When the broth is boiling, add the rice ; 
simmer until it is tender, being careful not to let the water 
boil away. Season, ard serve at once. For seasoning, 
a little curry powder, used as you would use cayenne 
pepper, or a saltspoouful of celer}' salt, or a few leaves of 
fresh mint, are agreeable as a change. 

When you have not time to cool the broth, a piece of 
soft tissue paper passed over the surface helps to take up 
any globules of fat which cannot be removed with a spoon. 
To make it quicklv for a sick person, chop one pound of 
perfecth' lean, juic}' mutton \Qvy fine ; pour over it one pint 
of cold water. Let it stand until the water is very red ; 
then heat it slowly. Let it simmer ten minutes. Strain, 
and serve hot. 



142 The Boston Cook Book, 



Chicken Broth. 

Clean the chicken, and separate it at the joints. Re- 
move all the skin and fat. Cover the chicken with cold 
water. Add one tahlespoonful of salt^ one saltspoonful of 
pepper^ one small onion ^ sliced. Simmer until the chicken 
is tender. Remove the best part of the meat, and put 
the bones and gristle back and simmer until the bones are 
clean. Wash and soak two tablespoonfuls of rice half an 
hour. Strain the broth. Remove the fat. Put the broth 
on to boil again, and add to it the rice, and the nicest 
portions of meat cut into small pieces. Simmer until the 
rice is tender. Add seasoning to taste, and serve at once. 
A few spoonfuls of cream may be added if desired. Serve 
with toasted crackers. 



Turkey Soup. 

Take the bones and scraps left from roast turkey or 
chicken, or any kind of game. Scrape the meat from the 
bones, and laj^ aside any nice pieces, no matter how small. 
Remove all the stuffing, and keep that by itself. Break 
the bones, and pack them closely in a kettle. Cover with 
cold water. Add one small onion^ sliced, one teaspoonful of 
salt^ and a little pepper. Simmer two or three hours, or 
until the bones are clean. Strain, and remove the fat. 
Put the liquor on to boil again, and add for every quart of 
liquor, one cup of cold meat, cut into small pieces, and half 
a cup of the stuffing. Or omit the stuffing and thicken the 
soup with flour. Simmer till the meat is tender, and 
serve at once. If there be a much larger proportion of 
meat and stuffing left, use it in making scalloped turkey 
or croquettes. This is much better than to boil meat, 
bones, and stuffing together. In that case the stuffing 
absorbs the oil, and gives a ver}^ strong, disagreeable 
flavor to the soup. 



White Stock. 143 



White Soup Stock. 

White soup stock is made from veal or chicken, sea- 
soned with onion, celer}- salt, and white pepper, avoiding 
an^'thing which will give it color. White soups are thick- 
ened with rice, cornstarch, flour, eggs, or the white meat 
of chicken chopped fine, and are made still richer by milk 
or cream. 



White Soup (from Veal). 



4 pounds knuckle of veal. 
3 quarts cold water. 

1 even tablespoonf ul salt. 
6 peppercorns. 

2 small onions. 
2 stalks celery. 



1 pint milk. 

1 tablespoonful butter. 

1 heaping tablespoonful flour. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

1 saltspoonful celery salt. 

}/2 saltspoonful white pepper. 



Wipe and cut the veal into small pieces. Put it into 
the kettle w^ith the cold water. Heat slowly and skim, 
because we do not wish the soup colored. Add the salt, 
peppercorns, onions, and celery. Simmer five hours, 
strain, and when cool remove the fat. There should be 
about three pints of stock. When read\' to use it, put 
the stock on to boil, and the milk into the double boiler. 
Thicken the stock with one tablespoonful of butter and 
one heaping tablespoonful of cornstarch, cooked together. 
Add the boiling milk, the salt, and pepper. Beat two 
eggs until light, put them in the tureen, and strain the 
boiling soup over them. Many people prefer to use the 
3^olks of the eggs only. This makes a 3'ellow soup. 
Others vary it by boiling the eggs hard and rubbing the 
3'olks through a gravy strainer after the soup is in the 
tureen. 

This veal stock may be clarified with the white of an 
egg, if 3'ou wish it transparent. But it is better with the 
milk or cream, and should be highl}" seasoned, and re- 
duced one half by boiling, as when made from veal aloDe 
it is insipid. Serve with croutons. 



144 TJie Boston Cook Book, 



White Soup (from Chicken). 



3 or 4 pounds fowl. 
3 quarts cold water. 
1 tablespoonful salt. 
6 peppercorns. 

1 tablespoonful chopped onion. 

2 tablespoonfuls chopped celery. 



1 pint cream. 

1 tablespoonful butter. 

1 tablespoonful cornstarch. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

1 saltspoonful white pepper. 

2 eggs. 



Singe, clean, and wipe the fowl. Cat off the legs and 
wings, and disjoint the bod}'. Put it on to boil in cold 
water. Let it come to a boil quickly^ because we wish to 
use the meat as well as the water, and skim thoroughly. 
The meat may be removed when tender, and the bones put 
on to boil again. (Use the meat for croquettes or other 
made dishes.) Add the salt and vegetables. Simmer until 
reduced one half. Strain, and when cool remove the fat. 
For one quart of stock allow one pint of cream or milk. 
If cream, use a little less flour for thickening. Boil the 
stock ; add the butter and flour, cooked together, and the 
seasoning. Strain it over the eggs, stirring as you pour, 
or the eggs will curdle. By substituting, for the eggs in 
this white soup, the white meat of the chicken, chopped 
fine and rubbed to a powder, we have Potage a la Heine, 
which man}' think too elaborate for any but a professional 
cook to undertake. The breast of a roast chicken may be 
used. Add it to the boiling stock, then thicken it with 
the flour and batter. Add the cream, and if not perfectly 
smooth, strain into the tureen. It should be quite thick 
like cream. Whole rice is sometimes served with clear 
chicken soup. If used as a thickening, boil the rice until 
soft enoagh to rub through a strainer. Add it to the 
chicken liquor, and unite them with butter and flour cooked 
together. 

The liquor in which a fowl or chicken has been boiled, 
when not wanted for au}^ other purpose, should be saved 
for white soup. If the vegetables and spices are not 
boiled with the fowl, fry them five minutes without burn- 
ing, add them to the stock, and simmer fifteen minutes. 



Wliite Soups. T45 



Strain before serving. Chicken stock clarified makes a 
pale straw-colored, transparent soup. 

Potage a la Reine, No. 2. {Queen Victoria's favorite Soup.") 

Remove the fat from one quart of the water in which a 
chicken has been boiled. Season highly with salt^ pepper^ 
and celery salt, and a little 07iio)i if desired, and put on to 
boil. Mash the yolks of thi^ee hard-boiled eggs fine, and 
mix them with half a cup of bread or cracker crumbs, 
soaked until soft in a little milk. Chop the white meat of 
the chicken until fine like meal, and stir it into the eorcr 
and bread paste. Add one pint of hot cream slowly, and 
then rub all into the hot chicken liquor. Boil five minutes ; 
add more salt if needed, and if too thick add more cream, 
or if not thick enough add more fine cracker dust. K 
should be liJi^e a puree. 

Cocoanux Soup. 

Cook two pounds of veal bones in two quarts of cold 
water until the meat is tender and the stock reduced to 
one quart. Grate the cocoanut and let it simmer with 
the veal the last half hour. Strain out the bones and 
cocoanut, and add to it the milk of the cocoanut and one 
pint of cream. Put it on the fire again, and when boiling, 
thicken it with one tablespoon each of cornstarch and 
]»utter which must first be blended or cooked as for 
white sauce. Add salt and pepper, and just before 
serving add a little of the broth to two slightly beaten 
eggs, then stir it quickly into the broth and serve at 
once with dried dice of bread. 

Quick Bouillon. 

Combine the liquor from oysters and clams, stock from 
left overs, water from boiled vegetables (except potato) 
with water to make one quart. Boil, add salt, one tea- 
spoon of beef extract and one of Kitchen Bouquet.

SOUPS WITHOUT STOCK. 

Any of the soups or purees in this division ma}' be at- 
tempted before one has mastered the imaghiary difficulties 
of stock- making. The}' are palatable, nutritious, inex 
pensive, and quickl}- prepared. 

Potato Soup. 



% teaspoonful celery salt. 
% saltspoonf ul white pepper. 
}y^ sahspoonf ul cayenne. 
)o tablespoonf ul flour. 
1 tablespoonf ul butter. 



3 potatoes. 

1 pint milk. 

1 teaspoonful chopped onion. 

1 stalk celery. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

Wash and pare the potatoes, and let them soak in coia 
water half an hour. Put them into boiling water, and 
cook until verj* soft. Cook the onion and celerj' with the 
milk in a double boiler. When the potatoes are soft, drain 
oflTthe water and mash them. Add the boiling milk and 
seasoning. Rub through a strainer, and put it on to boil 
again. Put the butter in a small saucepan, and when 
melted and bubbling, add the flour, and when well mixed 
stir into the boiling soup ; let it boil five minutes, and serve 
very hot. This flour thickening keeps the potato and 
milk from separating, and gives a smoothness and con- 
sistenc}' quite unlike the granular effect which is often 
noticed. If the soup be too thick, add more hot milk. 

The celery salt ma}' be omitted if you haA-e the fresh 
celery, or, if you like, put one taUespoonfid of fine choppeJ 
parsley into the sc^p just before serving. 

When you wish a richer soup, use a quart of milk, mak- 
ing it much thinner, and add tivo eggs^ well beaten, after 
you take it from the fire ; or put them in the tureen, 
and stir rapidly as you pour in the boiling soup. New raw 
potatoes, cut into small dice or balls and cooked till tender 
^ut not broken, are sometimes served in potato soup. 



Soup without Stoeh.

Celery Soup. 



1 head celery. 

1 pint water. 

1 pint milk. 

1 tablespoonf ul chopped onion. 



1 tables poonful butter. 
1 tablespoonf ul flour. 
)^ teaspoonful salt. 
^ saltspoonf ul pepper. 



Wash and scrape the celerj', cat into half-inch pieces, 
put it into one pint of boiling salted water, and cook until 
very soft. Mash in the water in which it was boiled. Cook 
the onion with the milk, in a double boiler, ten minutes, 
and add it to the celery. Rub all through a strainer, and 
put it on to boil again. Cook the butter and flour together 
in a small saucepan until smooth, but not brown, and 
stir it into the boiling soup. Add the salt and pepper ; 
boil five minutes, and strain into the tureen. Serve very 
hot. 



Tomato Soup. 



1 quart can tomatoes. 

1 pint hot water. 

1 tablespoonful sugar. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

4 cloves. 

4 peppercorns, or 



1 saltspoonful white pepper. 
1 tablespoonful butter. 
1 tablespoonful chopped onion. 
1 tablespoonful cliopped parsley. 
1 tablespoonful cornstarch. 



Put the tomatoes, water, sugar, salt, cloves, and pep- 
percorns on to boil in a porcelain stewpan. Put the but- 
ter in a small saucepan, and when it bubbles put in the 
onion and parslc}'. Fr}^ five minutes, being careful not to 
burn it. Add the cornstarch, and when well mixed stir 
it into the tomato. Let it simmer ten minutes. Add 
more salt and pepper if needed. Strain, and serve with 
plain boiled rice, or croutons, or toasted crackers.

Stew the tomatoes until soft enough to strain easily. 
Boil the milk in a double boiler. Cook one tablespoonful 



148 The Boston Cook Book. 

of the butter and the cornstarch together in a small sauce- 
pan, adding enough of the hot milk to make it pour easily. 
Stir it carefully into the boiling milk, and boil ten minutes. 
Add the remainder of the butter in small pieces, and stii 
till well mixed. Add salt and pepper and the strained 
tomatoes. If the tomatoes be very acid, add half a salt- 
spoonful of soda before straining. Serve ver}' hot. Many 
would use more tomatoes, but it is more delicate with a 
small quantity. 

Black Bean Soup. 



1 pint black beans. 

2 quarts cold water. 

1 small onion. 

2 teaspoonfuls salt. 

1 saltspoonf ul pepper. 
3^ saltspoonf ul cayenne. 



1 saltspoonful mustard. 

1 tablespoonful fiour. 

2 tablespoonfuls butter. 

1 lemon. 

2 hard-boiled eggs. 



Soak the beans over night. In the morning pour ofl 
the water, and put them on to boil in two quarts of cold 
water. Slice the onion and fty it in one tablespoonful of 
the butter. Put it with the beans. Add a bit of celery 
root, if you have it. Simmer four or five hours, or until 
the beans are soft. Add more cold water as it boils away, 
— about half a cup every half-hour, — to check the boil- 
ing and soften the beans, leaving about two quarts when 
done. Rub the beans through a strainer, put the soup 
on to boil again, and add the salt, pepper, and mustard. 
When boiling, thicken it with the flour and butter which 
have been cooked together. This will prevent the beans 
from settling. Season to taste. Cut the lemon and eggs 
into thin slices, put them into the tureen, and pour the hot 
soup over them. Serve with croutons. 

Many think tomatoes are an improvement. If that 
flavor be desired, add to the above half a can of to\]natoes, 
before straining. Others think it is not just right unless 
a quarter of a pound of salt pork, or some bones and odds 
and ends of meat, have been boiled with It. The beans 
are sometimes boiled to quite a thick pulp, and after sifting 
made of the proper consistency by thinning with brown 



Pea Sovp, 149 

soup stock, and seasoned more liighlj with the addition 
of ground herbs, spices, force-meat balls, and wine. It 
is then not unlike Mock Turtle Soup. 

A very good bean soup may be made from the remains 
of baked beans. Add one quart of water and a slice of 
onion to each pint of beans. Boil to a pulp, mash, and 
season. Or make the soup of equal parts of white beans 
and canned or dried sweet corn. If dried corn, soak it 
over night, chop it fine, and boil it with the beans. If 
canned corn, chop it, and add it to the beans after 
straining. But whichever way it is prepared, do not boil 
the beans in the water in which they were soaked, nor 
serve them without straining, to remove the hulls, which 
contain no nutriment and are indigestible. 



Split Pea Soup. 




1 cup dried split peas. 
3 pints cold water. 
1 tablespoonful butter. 
1 tablespoonful flour. 



}o teaspoonful sugar. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

1 saltspoonf ul white pepper. 



Pick over and wash the peas. Soak over night, or for 
several hours in cold water. Put them on to boil in three 
pints of fresh cold water, and let them simmer until dis- 
solved, adding en(3Ugh more water, as it boils awa}', to 
keo[) three pints of liquid in the kettle. Keep it well 
scraped from the sides of the kettle. When soft, rub through 
a strainer and put on to boil again. Add either water, 
stock, milk, or cream to make the consistency you wish. 
It should be more like a puree than a soup. Cook one 
large tablespoonful of butter and one of flour together, 
and add to the strained soup when boiling. Add the salt 
and pepper, and when it has simmered ten minutes, serve 
at once with fried dice of bread. 

This is delicious made in this simple wa}'. It must 
always be strained, and thickened with the flour and but- 
ter, or it will separate as it cools. It will be smooth, per- 
fectly free from grease ; and those who like the natural 



150 The Boston Cook Book, 

taste of the peas prefer it to any other wa^^ of cookiug. 
Do not think you must boil more or less salt pork with it, 
as most receipts advise. It may be varied in many ways, 
by adding half a can of tomatoes before straining, or 
by boiling with the peas a small onion which has first been 
cut fine and fried in a little butter, or b}^ adding any rem- 
nants of bone or meat, being careful to remove them before 
straining. Alwajs use the split peas, as the hulls have 
been removed, and the}' cook much more quickly than the 
whole peas. 



Green Pea Soup. 



1 quart green peas. 
1 quart water. 
1 pint milk. 



3^ saltspoonful pepper. 
^2 teaspoonful sugar. 



1 tablespoonful butter. 
1 tablespoonful flour. 



Put the peas into one pint of boiUng water, and cook 
until soft. Mash them in the water in which they were 
boiled, and rub through a strainer, gradually adding a pint 
of hot water, which will help to separate the pulp from the 
skins. Put on to boil again. Cook the butter and flour 
in a small saucepan, being careful not to brown it. Stir 
it into the boiling soup. Add the salt, sugar, pepper, and 
the milk, which should be hot, using enough milk to make 
it the consistency you prefer. This is a very good way to 
use peas that are old and hard, and unfit to serve as a 
vegetable, which is often the case with those that come 
from a market. When the pods are fresh, wash them 
thoroughly ; allow more water, and boil them with the 
peas. 

Green Com Soup. 

6 ears sweet corn, or enough to 

make 1 pint raw pulp. 
Water to cover the ears. 
1 pint milk, or cream. 
1 teaspoonful salt. 

With a ver}- sharp knife scrape the thinnest possible 
shaving from each row of kernels, and then, with the back

1 teaspoonful sugar. 
1 teaspoonful flour. 
1 tablespoonful butter. 



Vegetable Soup. i?l 



of the knife, scrape out the pulp, leaving the hull on the 
cob. Break the cobs if long, and put them on to boil in 
enough cold water to cover them. Boil thirty minutes and 
strain. There should be about one pint of water after 
straining. Put the corn water on to boil again, and when 
boiling add the corn pulp. Cook fifteen minutes. Add 
the salt, pepper, sugar, and the boiling milk. Thicken 
it with one teaspoon ful of flour and one tablespoonful of 
butter cooked together. Boil five minutes and serve at 
once. 

Corn is better for soup when it is a little old for the 
table, and the pulp is thick rather than milky. 



Vegetable Soup (Winter). 



1 cup each of onion and carrot. 
1 cup each of turnip and parsnip. 
1 pint each of celery and potato, 
1^ cup butter or drippings. 
1 teaspoonfui salt. 
1 tablespoonful flour. 



1 teaspoonfui sugar. 
1 saltspoonf ul white pepper. 
34 saltspoonful cayenne pepper. 
1 tablespoonful chopped parsley. 
1 slice of bread crust toasted very 
brown. 



Cut the onion, carrot, turnip, parsnip, and celery into 
half-inch dice, reserving the onions to frv, and the pota- 
toes to boil by themselves. Put the butter in a stew- 
pan or soup kettle, and when hot add the onions. After 
frying them carefully until colored but not burned, add the 
flour, and when well mixed pour on gradually a pint of 
hot water. Add the salt, pepper, sugar, bread, vegetables 
(except the potatoes), and enough boiling water to cover 
all. Let them simmer two hours. Boil the potatoes ten 
minutes, drain, and add them to the soup. When the 
vegetables are soft, rub all through a strainer. Add more 
salt and pepper if desired- and keep over hot water until 
ready to serve. 

A summer vegetable soup may be made in a similar man- 
ner, using 3'oung onions, turnips, carrots, and cauliflower. 
Cut fine and parboil ; then cover with fresh boiling water, 
simmer until soft, mash, strain, season, make quite thin

with hot cream or milk, and pour this over a small quan- 
tity of tender green peas and asparagus tips, previously 
boiled. 



Fish Soup. 



1 pound any boiled fish, — salmon, 

cod, or halibut. 
1 quart milk. 
1 slice onion. 



1 tablespoonful butter. 

2 tablespoonfuls flour. 
1 teaspoonful salt. 

1 saltspoonf ul pepper. 



Cook the fish in boiling salted water, until it flakes 
easil3\ Drain it, remove the skin and bones, and rub 
through a coarse strainer. Cook the onion with one 
quart of milk ten minutes, remove the onion, and thicken 
the milk with the flour and butter cooked together. Add 
the seasoning and fish. Let it boil up once and serve. 

Puree of Canned Salmon. 

Remove the oil, bones, and sldn from half a can of 
salmon. Chop the salmon ver}' fine. Boil one quart of 
milk^ and season and thicken it as for fish soup. Add the 
salmon, and when heated it is read}^ to serve. 

Lobster Soup, or Bisque of Lobster. 



2 pounds lobster, 
1 quart milk. 

1 tablespoonful butter, 

2 tablesp. flour or cornstarch. 



1 teaspoonful salt. 
1 saltspoonful white pepper. 
1;^ saltspoonful cayenne pepper. 
1 pint water. 



Remove the meat of the lobster from the shell, and cut 
the tender pieces into quarter-inch dice. Put the ends of 
the claw meat and any other tough, hard parts, with the 
bones of the bodj', into one pint of cold water, and boil 
twent}' minutes, adding more water as it boils away. Put 
the coral on a piece of paper, and dr}' it in the oven. 
Boil one quart of milk, and thicken itwath one tablespoon- 
ful of butter and two of flour or cornstarch. Boil ten 
minutes. Strain the water from the bones and add it to 
the milk. Add tlie salt and pepper, using more if high 



Fish Soups. 153 



seasoning be desired. Rnb the dried coral through a 
strainer, using enough to give the soup a bright pink color. 
Put the green fat and lobster dice into the tureen, and 
strain the boiling soup over them. Serve immediately. 

If you do not like so much of the lobster in the soup, 
chop it all very fine, boil it with the milk, and rub it 
through a squash or grav}' strainer. Many like the addi- 
tional thickening of half a cup oi fine cracker crumbs. 

This soup may also be varied by using one pint of stocky 
either chicken or veal, and one pint of milk; or b}' the 
addition of force-meat balls made in the following manner : 
Cut onl}' half of the meat into dice ; chop the remainder, 
and pound it to a fine paste with the yolks of two hard-boiled 
eggs^ one teaspoonful of butter^ a little salt^ and pepper ; beat 
one raw egg^ and add enough of it to moisten the paste so 
that it ma}' easily- be made into balls the size of a nutmeg ; 
let them simmer in the soup about five minutes, ju^ 
enough to cook the egg. 



Lobster Soup, No. 2. 

The meat of two small lobsters^ cut fine, one pint of cream^ 
one pint of milk. Simmer twenty minutes. Add one table- 
spoonful of flour wet in cold milk. Salt and cayenne pepper 
to taste. Just before serving add half a cup of butter^ cut 
into small pieces, and stir till it is entirely absorbed. 
Strain, and serve very hot. 




1 quart oysters. 

1 pint milk. 

1 tablespoonful butter. 



Oyster Soup. 

2 tablespoonfuls flour. 

Salt to taste. 

}o saltspoonful pepper. 



Put the milk on to boil in the double boiler, while you 
prepare the 03'sters. Place a colander over a pan. Put 
the oysters in a large bowl, and pour over them one cup of 
water. Take up each oyster with the fingers, to make sure 
no pieces of shell adhere to it, and drain in the colander. 
Strain the oyster liquor, which has drained fro'.n the 



154 ^^ Boston Cook Book, 

colander, through the finest strainer. Put it on to boil. 
Remove the scum, and when clear put in the 03'sters. 
Let them simmer, but not boil, until they begin to grow 
plump and the edges to curl or separate. Strain the liquor 
into the milk, and put the 03'sters where they will keep 
hot, but not cook. Thicken the milk with the butter and 
flour, which have been cooked together ; add salt and 
pepper to taste (the amount of salt depending upon the 
saltness of the 03'sters) . Boil five minutes ; add the oys- 
ters and serve at once. This receipt may be varied b}" 
boiling o?ie cup of fine chopped celery and a small slice of 
onion with the milk ten minutes ; then straining and thick- 
ening it with half a cup of powdered cracker. Add the 
butter, the seasoning, and the parboiled 03'sters. Serve 
at once. 

Oyster Stew is made hke oyster soup, without the 
thickening. 

Clam Soup. 



1 tablespoonful chopped parsley. 

1 heaping tablespoonful butter. 

2 heaping tablespoonf uls flour. 
1 pint milk or cream. 



}^ peck clams in the shell. 

Salt to taste. 

1 saltspoonful pepper.- 

l^ saltspoonful cayenne pepper. 

1 tablespoonful chopped onion. 

Prepare the clams b}' boiling in the shells, and cutting 
as directed for clam chowder, keeping the soft part sepa- 
rate from the hard. Pour off one quart of the clam liquor 
after it settles, being careful not to take any of the sedi- 
ment ; put it on to boil, and remove the scum. Add one 
pint of hot water ^ and season to taste with salt, pepper, ca}'- 
enne, onion, and parsley. Put in the hard part of the 
clams. Simmer fifteen minutes, strain, and boil again, 
and when boiling thicken with the flour cooked in the 
butter. Add the hot milk or cream, and the soft part of 
the clams ; serve at once, with crackers and pickles. 

Another method of preparing clam soup, if needed 
quickly : Heat the clam broth to a boihng point ; add the 
clams cut fine ; season, and pour into the tureen over tWQ 
eggs beaten up with the boiling milk. 



Fttih Chowder. 1^5 



The clam broth served hot with toasted crackers will oftei. 
tempt a person with a capricious appetite. 



Fish Chowder. 



4 or 5 pounds cod or haddock or 

bass. 
6 potatoes. 

A 2-inch cube of fat salt pork. 
2 small onions. 



1 tablespoonful salt. 

}/2 teaspoonful white pepper. 

1 tablespoonful butter. 

1 quart milk. 

6 butter crackers. 



When bu^'ing a fish for a chowder, have the head left on 
but the skin removed ; or if 3'ou have to depend upon your 
self, remove the skin according to directions on page 161. 
Then begin at the tail and cut the fish from the bone on 
one side, keeping the knife as close as possible to the 
bone ; remove the bone from the other side. Do not for- 
get to take out the small bones near the head. Wipe the 
fish carefull}' with a damp cloth, cut it into pieces about 
two inches square, and put it away in a cool place. Break 
the bones and head, cover with cold water, and put them 
on to boil. Pare and slice the potatoes one eighth of an 
inch thick, lising enough to make the same quantity by 
measurement as you have of fish. Soak them in cold water 
half an hour, and parboil or scald in boiling water five 
minutes ; then pour off the water. Cut the pork into 
quarter-inch dice, and fry it in an omelet pan. Cut the 
onions into thin slices and fry them in the pork fat, being 
careful that it does not burn. Pour the fat through a 
strainer into the kettle, leaving the pork scraps and onions 
m the strainer. Put the sliced potatoes into the kettle ; 
hold the strainer over the potatoes, and pour through it 
enough boiling water to cover them. This is easier than 
to fry in the kettle, and skim out the pork and onions, — 
which to a novice would be running the risk of burning the 
fat, cleaning the kettle, and beginning again. When the 
potatoes have boiled ten minutes, strain the water in which 
the bones were boiled, and pour it into the kettle. Add 
the salt and pepper, and when the chowder is boiling 
briskly, put in the fish, and set it back where it can siip- 



156 The Boston Cook Book, 

mer ten minutes. Do not break the fish b}' stirring it. 
Add the butter and the hot milk. Spht the crackers, put 
them in the tureen, and pour the chowder over them. Do 
not soak the crackers in cold water. Butter crackers will 
soften easil}' in the hot chowder. If you wish the broth 
thicker, stir in one cup of fine cracker crumbs, or one 
tablespoonful of flour cooked in one tablespoonful of butter. 
More milk and a little more seasoning may be added to 
this amount of fish and potato, if you wish to make a larger 
quantit}'. When wanted richer, beat two eggs, mix them 
with the hot milk, and put in the tureen before turning in 
the chowder. If added while the chowder is in the hot 
kettle, the eggs will curdle. Any firm white fish ma}' be 
used for a chowder, but cod and haddock are best. Many 
use a cod's head with the haddock. The head is rich and 
gelatinous, and it should always be boiled with. the bones, 
and the liquor added to the chowder. In this chowder you 
have nothing but what the most daint}- person may relish. 
There are no bones, skin, or scraps of boiled pork. Fish, 
potatoes, and crackers are all distinct in the cream}- liquid, 
instead of being a pasty mush, such as is often served. 
For a change, the crackers may be buttered and browned. 

If a highly seasoned dish be desired, boil an onion, cut 
into thin slices, with the potatoes ; add more pepper, and 
either cayenne pepper, Worcestershire sauce, or curry 
powder. Omit the boiling water, and use only that in 
which the bones were boiled, when making a smaller 
quantity. 

Clam Chowder. 



% teaspoonf ul white pepper. 
1 large tablespoonful butted. 
1 quart milk. 
6 butter crackers. 



J4 peck clams in the shells. 
1 quart potatoes, sliced thin. 
A 2-inch cube of fat salt pork. 
1 or 2 onions. 
1 teaspoonf ul salt. 

Clam chowder is made in the same manner as fish 
chowder, substituting half a peck of clams for the fish. 
Clams in the shells are better, as you then have more 
clam liquor. Wash with a small brush, and put them 



Cho^vder. 



157 



in a large kettle with half a cupful of water, or just enough 
to keep the under ones from burning ; set them over the 
fire. When the clams at the top have opened, take them 
out with a skimmer, and when cool enough to handle, take 
tlie clams from the shell ; remove the thin skin ; then witli 
scissors cut off all the black end, cut the " leather straps" 
into small pieces, leaving the soft part whole. Let the 
clam liquor settle, and pour it off carefully. Use half 
water and half clam liquor. Fry the pork and onion the 
same as in fish chowder ; add the potatoes, which have been 
soaked and scalded, and boiling water to cover. When 
the potatoes are soft, add the clam liquor, the seasoning, 
and the clams ; when warmed through, add the hot milk 
and turn into the tureen. Do not put the clams into the 
chowder until the potatoes are nearly' done, as prolonged 
boiling hardens them. /^^(^^- ^ 

Com Chowder. 



1 quart raw sweet corn.

1 large tablespooiiful butter. 
1 tahlespoonful flour. 
1 pint sliced tomatoes. 
1 pint milk. 




^1.^ 



Scrape the raw corn from the cob. Boil the cobs twent}' 
minutes in water enough to cover them ; then skim them 
out. Pare, soak, and scald the potatoes. Fry the onion 
in the salt pork fat, and strain the fat into the kettle with 
the corn water. Add the potatoes, corn, salt, and pepper. 
Simmer fifteen minutes, or till the potatoes and corn are 
tender. Add the butter and milk, and serve very hot 
with crisped crackers. 



1 pound lobster. 
1 quart milk. 
3 crackers.

of the lobster. Season with one scant teaspoonful of 
salt, half a saltspoonful of white pepper, and one fourth 
of a saltspoonful of caj^enne pepper. Pour the boiling 
milk gradually over the paste. Put it back in the double 
boiler ; add the lobster meat cut into dice ; let it boil up 
once, and serve. 

Puree of Clams. 

One pint of boiled clams ; remove the dark substance 
from the soft part, and chop the hard part very fine. 
Thicken one pint of hot cream with one tahlespoonful of jiour 
cooked in one heaping tahlespoonful of hot butter ; add the 
chopped clams, the soft parts, and salt and pepper. Add 
more hot cream or a little of the clam liquor if the puree 
be too thick. When hot, strain it into the tureen. 

CourbouilloD. 



3'ouions. 

2 tablespoonfuls butter. 
1 tablespoouful flour. 
1 cup claret, or 



y^ cup vinegar. 

1 pint beef stock. 

2 pounds fish, sliced. 
4 tomatoes. 



Fry the sliced onions in the butter in the bottom of the 
stewpan ; be careful not to burn them ; add the flour, 
mix well; add gradually the stock, and, when smooth, 
put in half the fish, then half the tomatoes peeled and 
sliced, and the wine or vinegar; then another layer of 
fish and tomatoes. Simmer half an hour. The fish 
should be skinned and boned. 

Cherry Soup. 

Soups made from fruit juices only slightly sweetened, 
thickened with arrowroot and served cold in bouillon cups 
are quite acceptable in hot days. Allow one pint of water 
to a pint of fruit. Stew, mash, and sift the fruit, sweeten 
and thicken slightly, then boil till clear. Some fruits re- 
quire a little lemon juice or wine. Add chipped ice an<? 
serve with zwieback or toasted wafers. 



Fish.

FISH. 

Fish, on account of its abundance, cheapness, and 
wholesomeness, is invaluable as an article of food. It is 
less nutritious and less stimulating than meat, as it con- 
tains less solid matter and more water. An exaggerated 
idea of the value of fish as brain food has prevailed ; the 
latest authorities, however, state that there is no evidence 
to prove that fish is an}^ richer than meat in phosphorus. 
But as it contains little fat, the white varieties particularly, 
it is easil}^ digested, and as it has a large proportion of 
nitrogenous material, it is especiall}' adapted to all those 
upon whom there are great demands for nervous energj' . 

Salmon heads the list " of whatsoever hath scales and 
fins," in nutritive qualities ; and it is richer than meat. 
The next in value are fat haliluit, shad, white-fish, mack- 
erel, blue-fish, lean halil)ut, bass, flounder, trout, cod, 
haddock, cusk, etc. 

Red-blooded fish, like salmon, mackerel, and blue-fish, 
have the oil distributed through the bod}'. They are 
nutritious for those who can digest them, but are too rich 
and oily for invalids. White fish, like flounder, halibut, 
cod, and haddock, have the oil in the liver, and are more 
easily digested. Fish should be perfectl}' fresh and thor- 
ougfdy cooked, or it will be very indigestible and some- 
times poisonous. Broiling and baking are the best methods. 
Small pan-fish and fillets of large white dry fish are good 
if fried ; but oily fish should never be fried. Salting draws 
out the nutritive part of fish the same as it does in meat ; 
and either, when thus prepared, should be used as a relish, 
and not depended upon for nourishment. Fat fish are 
injured less than white fish, as the fat is not removed by 
bultiuir. 



l6o The Boston Cook Booh 

All varieties of fish need an accompaniment of starch3^ 
foods, like bread and potatoes ; and white fish need beside 
to be cooked with butter or fat to make them desirable as 
food. The juices of fish, shell-fish particularl}', are of an 
alkaline nature ; and this renders lemon juice or vinegar 
a desirable condiment as a neutralizing agenc3\ 

The flesh of good, fresh fish is firm and hard, and will 
rise at once when pressed with the finger. If the eyes be 
dull and sunken, the gills pale, and the flesh flabby oi 
soft, the fish is not fresh. 

Fish should be cleaned as soon as possible, in strongly 
salted water. They should be washed (not soaked) by 
wiping with a cloth wet in salt water. Then wrap them 
iti a cloth which is sprinkled with salt, and put them in 
a cool place. If put in the ice-chest, the}' will taint the 
butter and milk. Put ice around them, if necessar}- ; but 
do not let them touch the ice, as fresh water and ice will 
soften them. When once they lose their hard, firm con- 
sistency, they are considered unfit to eat by those who 
know what good fish really are. 

Frozen fish should be thawed in cold water. Fresh- 
water fish having a muddy taste or smell are improved by 
soaknig in salt and water. Salt fish should be soaked in 
fresh water, with the skin side up, to draw out the salt, 
and should be eaten only occasionall}', for the reason 
before stated. 

To Clean a Fish. — If the fish have scales, remove them 
before opening. Scrape with a small, sharp knife from 
the tail to the head ; hold the knife flat and slanting, 
resting it on the fish, that the scales may be taken 
upon the knife ; scrape slowly, that the scales may not 
fly over everything near, and rinse the knife often in cold 
water. 

When the fish is to be served whole, do not remove the 
head and tail. Smelts and small fish served whole are 
opened under the gills, and the contents squeezed out by 
pressing from the middle with the thumb and finger. Large 
fish are spUt open from the gills half-way down the lowei 



Fish. i6i 

part of the bod^', the entrails removed, and the inside 
scraped and cleaned. Open far. enough to remove all the 
blood on the backbone. Man}' leave the sound, which is 
the white part adhering to the bone ; but it is better to 
remove it. 

To Skin a Fish. — Cut a thin, narrow strip down the 
backbone, taking off the dorsal fin. Then open the lower 
part half-way down. Slip the knife under and up thi'ough 
the bon}' part of the gills, and hold this bony part between 
the thumb and finger, and strip the skin off toward the 
tail. Then do the same on the other side. 

Small fish, like mackerel and white-fish, when dressed 
for broiling, should be split through the back. 

2b Bone a Fish. — Clean, and strip off the skin ; la}' the 
fish flat on a board ; begin at the tail, and run the knife in 
under the flesh close to the bone, and scrape it away clean 
from the bone, holding the flesh carefully, not to break 
the flakes. When the flesh on one side is removed, slip 
the knife under the bone on the other side, and raise the 
bone, leaving the flesh on the board ; then pull out all the 
small bones left in the flesh, which you can easily feel with 
the fingers. Fish with many fine bones, like shad and her- 
ring, are not boned ; but from cod, cusk, mackerel, white- 
fish, and haddock they may be easily removed. 

Fillets of Fish are the flesh separated from the bone, and 
served whole or divided, as the case may require. Floun- 
ders or sole, chicken halibut, and bass, should have the 
fillets on each side divided lengthwise ; making fbur long 
thin pieces, or fillets. Other fish are cut into thin slices 
or small squares. Very small fish may be split, the bone 
removed, and the whole fish rolled up from the tail to the 
head and fastened with a skewer. 



Broiled Fish. 

First clean the fish. Wash with a cloth wet in salt water 
and dry on a clean fish towel, kept for no other purpose. 
Mackerel, white-fish, small blue-fish, trout, small cod, and 



1 62 The Boston Cook Book. 

shad should be split down the back, and if yon prefer, cut 
off the head and tail. Halibut and salmon should be cut 
into inch slices, the skin and bone removed, and turned 
often while broiUng. Cut flounder, bass, and chicken hal- 
ibut into fillets. Oily fish need onl^' salt and pepjoer ; but 
dr}^ white-fish should be spread with soft hutter or olive oil 
before broiUr j. 

Use a double wire broiler, and grease well with salt pork 
rind. Put the thickest edge of the fish next the middle of 
the broiler, and always broil the flesh side first, as the skin 
burns easily. Cook the flesh side until it is brown. The 
time should var\' with the thickness of the fish ; move the 
broiler up and down, that all parts ma}^ be equally- browned ; 
then turn, and cook on the other side just enough to crisp 
the skin. Small fish require from five to ten minutes ; 
thicker fish, fifteen or twent}' minutes. The fire should be 
hot and clear. If the fish be verj- thick, hold it farther 
from the fire ; or when niceh' browned, put the broiler in 
the oven on a dripping-pan, and cook till the flesh sepa- 
rates easil}' from the bones. Mackerel, trout, and fresh 
herring are sometimes broiled whole. Clean without open- 
ing more than is necessary. Wipe and dr}' well. Gash 
through to the bone at intervals one inch apart on each side, 
and rub salt^ pepper, and hutter or oil in the incisions ; wrap 
in buttered paper, and broil carefully from ten to twenty 
minutes. When ready to serve, loosen the fish from the 
broiler on each side, open the broiler, and, leaving the flesh 
side of the fish uppermost, slide it off" without breaking. Or 
open the opposite way, hold a platter over the skin side, 
and invert platter and broiler together. Spread with hutter^ 
salt, and pepper ; or add chopped parsley or icatercresses ; 
or serve with Maitre d'hotel, Tartare, Tomato, or Curry 
sauce. Garnish with parsley and slices of lemon. 

Baked Fish. 

Cod, haddock, cusk, blue-fish, small salmon, bass, and 
shad mav be stuflfed, and baked whole. 



Baked Fish. 163 



Stuffing for Baked Fish weighing from four to six Pounds. 



1 cup cracker crumbs. 

1 saltspoonful salt. 

2 saltspoonful pepper. 

1 teaspoonful chopped onion. 



1 teaspoonful chopped parsley. 
1 teaspoonful capers. 
1 teaspoonful pickles. 
3^4 cup melted butter. 



This makes a diy, crumbl}' stuffing. If a moist stuffing 
be desired, use stale (not dried) bread crumbs^ and moisten 
with one beaten egg and the butter ; or moisten the crackers 
with warm water. 

Oyster Stuffing. — One 'pint of oysters, one cup of seasoned 
and buttered cracker crumbs. Drain and roll each oyster in 
the crumbs. Fill the fish with the oysters, and sprinkle 
the remainder of the crumbs over the oysters. 

General Directions. — Fish bake through more evenly, 
brown better, and are more easily served, if placed upright 
in the pan instead of on one side. Fish that are broad 
and short, like shad, may be kept in place by propping 
with stale bread or pared potatoes. But all others that are 
narrow in proportion to the length ma}" be skewered or 
tied into the shape of a letter S ; run a threaded trussing- 
needle through the head, middle of the body and tail in 
the direction indicated b}- the dotted line above ; then 
draw the string tight, and fasten the ends. Fish thus 
prepared w^ill keep their shape after baking. 

Have an iron sheet with rings at the ends for handles, 
and just large enough to fit into the dripping-pan. Rub 
the sheet well with salt pork, and put pieces of pork under 
the fish to keep it from sticking. This sheet will enable 
you to lift the fish from the pan and place it on the platter 
without breaking. If 3'ou have no sheet, put two broad 
strips of cotton cloth across the pan, before laying in the 
fish. When done, lift out on the cloth. Do not put water 
in the pan, unless you wish to steam instead of bake the 
fish. Put two or three slices cf fat salt pork over and 
near the fish, and when the floui has browned, baste 
often with the pork fat. Bake till brown, and baste 
often.

carefully from the fish sheet, and place it on a hot platter. 
Draw out the strings or skewer, wipe off all the water or 
fat which runs from the fish, and remove the pieces of 
pork. Pour Plollandaise sauce around (not over) the 
fish, or serve a drawn butter sauce flavored with lemon, 
in a sauce-boat ; and pile Saratoga potatoes lighth' around 
the fish. Garnish the head of the fish with parsle}^ or 
watercresses. 

To serve the Fish. — Make an incision along the backbone 
the entire length of the fish ; then draw the fish away from 
the bone on each side, cutting at right angles with the 
bone. Raise the bone to reach the stuffing, and serve a 
little of the fish, stuffing, and sauce to each person. The 
skeleton should be left entire on the platter. 

No. 2. — Remove the head, tail, and skin. Rub well with 
salt and lemo7i juice. Stuff with ot/ster stuffing., and sew 
securel3\ Skewer it into shape, if long enough, or put 
it upright on a greased fish sheet, with bread to keep 
it in place. Or remove the bone, place the fish on a 
platter, and lay the prepared 03'sters between the laj'ers 
of fish. Season cracker crumbs with salt., pepper, and 
chopped parsley., and moisten with melted butter. Brush the

fish with beaten egg^ then sprinkle with the crumbs. Set 
the platter in the oven over a pan of hot water to keep the 
platter from cracking. Bake from fort}' to sixty minutes. 
Serve with tomato or Hollandaise sauce poured ai'ound 
the fish. 

No. 3. Baked Halibut. — Three or four pounds of halibut 
Dip the dark skin in boiling water ^ and scrape clean. Rub 
well with salt and pepper. Put it into a clean pan, and 
pour milk over it till half an inch deep. Bake about an 
hour, basting with the milk. Remove the bone and skin, 
and arrange on the platter in the original form. Serve 
with plain drawn butter, egg sauce, or cream sauce, and 
garnish with slices of boiled eggs. The milk keeps the 
fish moist, is a good substitute for pork, and makes the 
fish brown better. Use just enough milk to baste, and 
let it cook away toward the last. Or sprinkle buttered 
crumbs over the top, when the fish is nearly done, and 
serve with tomato sauce. 

A large cod, or any whole fish too large for a small 
family, may be cooked as follows : Remove the skin and 
bones from the middle and thickest part ; stuff and bake. 
Use the bones and head for a chowder. Cut the tail 
piece into shces, salt well, and fty or broil them. Or crimp 
them by soaking in salted water ; then simmer in water 
with salt and lemon juice^ and serve cold with Tartare 
sauce. 

Fried Fish. 

Mackerel, salmon, blue-fish, and all oily fish should 
never be fried. Smelts, perch, and other small pan-fish 
may be fried whole. When fried smelts are used as a 
garnish, fry them in the shape of rings by pinning the tail 
in the mouth. Cod, halibut, etc., should be skinned and 
boned, and cut into slices one inch thick and two or three 
inches square. Flounder and bass may be cut in fillets, as 
described on page IGl, and each fillet seasoned with salt 
and pepper, and fastened with a small wooden skewer. 
Small fish may be boned without parting in the middle. 



1 66 The Boston Cook Book. 

and rolled from tail to head. Fish for frying should be 
thoroughly cleaned and dried, seasoned with salt and 
pepper, and covered first with flour or fine bread crumbs, 
then dipped in beaten egg, then in crumbs again. If this 
does not cover them completelj', repeat the process. 

When the fish has been kept on ice, let it become slightly 
warm before frying, as otherwise it will chill the fat and 
become greasy. Fry in deep, smoking hot fat. Observe 
the directions given for frying on page 15, testing the fat 
first with bread ; and after the first plunge into the hot fat 
set the kettle back to keep from burning ; then reheat 
before frying any more. Fr}' from two to five minutes. 
Drain and serve with tomato, or Tartare, or any acid 
sauce. Garnish with slices of pickle or lemon, and 
parsley. 

Arrange small fish with heads and tails alternating ; 

or two or three on a 
skewer, one skewer 
for each person ; or 
in a circle round a

the centre of the 
platter and holding the sauce. Slices or rolled fillets may 
be arranged in a circle, with the sauce in the centre. 

Boiled Fish. 

Boiling is the most insipid and wasteful wa}- of cooking 
fish. To make boiled fish palatable, a rich sauce, like 
lobster, oyster, or shrimp sauce, is needed for all kinds 
except salmon and blue-fish. Salmon is so much richer 
and more oily than other fish that boiling does not injure 
it. Hollandaise and sauce piquante are appropriate for 
salmon. A fish kettle with a drainer for lifting out the 
fish is quite essential. Or you ma}' put a small piece of 
fish in a wire basket or on a plate ; tie the plate in a 
square of cloth, and lift cloth, plate, and fish together. 
Never try to boil a fish whole, as nothing can be more 




Boiled Fish. '[6y 



unsightly than the head of a boiled fish. Clean tlie fish 
thoroughly, and remove the head, tail, and skin. Rub 
well ^ith salt and lemon juice. Fish should be of uniform 
thickness, to boil nicely. A small salmon or the middle cut 
of a large o?ie, or the thickest part of cod or blue-Jish, or a 
thick piece of halibut, should be selected for boiling. Cod, 
haddock, and cusk, unless perfectly fresh, will break in 
boiling. 

J f fish be put into cold water, the juices are drawn out 
into the water. If cooked in rapidly boiling water, the 
fish breaks on the outside before the middle is done. The 
best and most economical way is to cook it in a steamer 
over boiling water. If that is not convenient, put the 
fish into boiling salted water, and simmer till done. Fish 
is cooked when the flesh separates easily from the bones, 
and should be taken up immediateh', and well drained be- 
fore serving. A ver}^ good wa}' of boiling fish is to steep 
it for five minutes in strongl}' salted boiling water, with one 
or two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, then plunge it into 
fresh boiling water without salt, and simmer till done. 
Less scum rises in the fresh water, and the fish looks 
whiter. Allow about six minutes to a pound for boiling ; 
more if in a cubical form than for a thin narrow piece of 
the same weight. 

Serve boiled fish on a folded napkin, and the sauce in a 
sauce-boat. Parisienne potatoes boiled or fried and piled 
hke cannon balls, alternating with parsley and button 
mushrooms ; or sliced pickles, fried oysters, Saratoga po- 
tatoes, slices of lemon, or hard-boiled eggs may be used 
as a garnish. If the fish break and look unsightly, re- 
move the bones, and flake it ; pile it lightly on a platter, 
and pour the sauce over the fish. 

7o boil Fish au Court Buuillon. — Fish are improved by 
cooking in water flavored with vegetables and spices. 
Mince one onion, one stalk of celery, and two or th7'€e sprigs 
of parsley. Fry them in a little butter ; add two tablespoon- 
fids of salt., six peppercorns, a bay leaf, three cloves, two 
quarts of boiling watei', and one pint of vinegar or souf

wine. Boil fifteen minutes, skim well, strain, and keep 
to use in boiling fish. Rub the fish with salt and lemon 
juice^ and put it into the boiling liquor, and simmer til] 
the flesh separates from the bone. 

Stewed Fish. — Any dry white fish or fresh-water fish 
may be stewed, and made into a ver}^ palatable and eco- 
nomical dish. Remove the skin, head, and bones from 
a four-pound Jish. Cover the bones and head with cold 
water, and cook them for half an hour. Slice and scald 
two small onions. Drain, and fry them till yellow, in the 
fat obtained from a two-inch cube of salt pork. Pour it all 
into tlie kettle with the bones. Cut the fish into pieces 
two inches square, and season them with salt and pepper. 
Put them in a clean kettle with a little butter to keep them 
from sticking, and strain the boiling bone water over 
them, using just enough to cover. Add the juice of halj 
a lemon, and when boiling thicken with one heaping table- 
spoonful of butter and tivo of Jlour cooked together. Sim- 
mer fifteen minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste, and 
one tablespoonful each of chopped parsley^ and tomato or 
mushroom catchup., if desired ; or add one quart of drained 
oysters, and simmer till the 03'sters are plump. A Matelote 
of fish is the French name for fish stewed with wine. 



Fish a la Creme. 

Four to six pounds of fsh, one to one and a half pints of 
cream sauce, and one cup of cracker crumbs^ moistened in 
one third of a cup of melted butter. 

This is one of the most attractive and convenient 
methods of serving au}^ kind of dr}' white fish, — cod, had- 
dock, or cusk. Clean the fish ; cook in boiling salted 
water with one tablespoonful of vinegar till the flesh sepa- 
rates easily. Drain, and when cool remove the skin and 
bones, and pick apart in flakes. Sprinkle well with salt 
and pepper. Make a rich white sauce. Put a layer of 
fish on a platter suitable for serving. Cover with the 
white sauce, letting the fish soak up all it will ; then arrange 



Fish Left Overs. 169 



another layer of fish and sauce. Moisten cracker crumbs 
in melted butter, and spread over the top with a fork. 
Set the platter in the oven over a pan of hot water, to 
keep the platter from cracking, and bake till the crumbs 
are brown. Garnish with parsley. The ivhites of two or 
three eggs, beaten stiff and salted, are sometimes used in 
the place of crumbs, but are not so palatable. Two or 
t/^ree tahlespoonfuls of grated cheese may be mixed with 
the crumbs, if 3'ou like the flavor. 

The sauce may be mixed with the fish ; but be careful 
not to mash the fish or get it too moist. Then the fish 
may be piled on the platter, higher and broader at one 
end and giving the outline of a flat fish ; or arranged in 
the form of a fish shaped like the letter S, and covered 
with the crumbs. Or, if the fish be not broken in boiling, 
take it up carefully on the drainer, remove the head, skin, 
and small bones from one side, put a platter over the fish 
and invert platter and fish together ; then remove the 
skin and the backbone from the other side, leaving the fish 
as whole as possible. Cover with the sauce and crumbs, 
and bake as above. This is not so desirable as the first 
method, because some fine bones are liable to be over- 
looked, and the sauce is not so well mixed with the fish. 

Remnants of Cooked Fish. 

Remnants of cold boiled or baked fish (using stuffing 
and sauce also) may be freed from skin and bones, flaked, 
and used in any of the following ways : — 

Scalloped Fish. — Vutjish and stuffing into a shallow dish 
in alternate layers, with cream sauce to moisten ; cover 
with buttered crumbs^ and bake till the crumbs are brown. 

Fish in Potato Border. — Warm the fsh slightl}' in a 
white sauce, and put it in the centre of a dish with a border 
of mashed potatoes. Or, if you have enough material for 
a large platter, put the border on the edge and a higher 
mound oi' potatoes in the centre, and fill the space between 
with the fsh. Sprinkle buttered crumbs lightly over the 
whole and set in the oven till brown. 



170 The Boston Cook Booh 

Chartreuse^ or Casserole of Fish ^ No. 1. — One cup of anj* 
cold Jishy flaked, seasoned, and moistened with a little 
cream ; the same quantity* of mashed potatoes ; and two hard- 
boiled eggs. Butter a small mould and put in alternate lay 
ers of potatoes, fish, and slices of egg. Steam twenty 
minutes, turn out upon a hot platter, and garnish with 
varsley. 

No. 2. — Mix one cup of stale bread crumbs^ one pint of 
cold Jish, flaked, and two eggs. Season to taste with Wor- 
cestershire or tomato catchup^ salt, and cayenne pepper. Put 
into a buttered mould. Boil thirty minutes, and serve 
with an}^ fish sauce. 

Kedgeree. — "NYarm cold flaked fish slightly over hot 
water ; and just before serving stir in one egg., beaten 
wdth one or two tablespoonfuls of hot milk and a bit of butter^ 
and serve in a rice border. Steam the rice, one cupful^ in 
two cupfuls of highly seasoned stock, in a double boiler thirty 
minutes, or till tender and drj^. 

Curried Fish. — Warm awy cold flaked fish in curry 
sauce, page 190. 

Creamed Fish loith Oysters. — Add an equal amount of 
oysters to the^^A, and cook in white sauce till the 03'sters 
are plump. Garnish with points of toast. 

Sjjiced Fish. — Steep six cloves, six allspice kernels, six 
peppercorns, and one tablespoonful of brown sugar in one cup 
of sharp vinegar ten minutes, and pom' it over 07ie pitit of 
any cold flaked flsh. 

Crimped Fish. 

Soak slices of any firm white fresh fish in very strongly 
salted water. Put them into boiling salted water enough 
to cover, with tioo tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and boil about 
ten minutes. Drain ; arrange on a platter ; remove the 
skin and bones. Serve hot with oyster or lobster sauce, 
or cold with a Mayonnaise or Tartare sauce poured 
into the cavity left by the bone. Garnish with watev 
cresses. 



Fish Balls. 17] 



Potted Fish. 

Three shad or six small mackerel^ uncooked ; one third of a 
vup of salt with half a saltspoonful of cayenne pepper mixed 
with it, and half a cup of whole spices^ — cloves., peppercorns, 
and allspice mixed in about equal proportions. Vine- 
gar to cover. Clean, remove the skin, split in halves, cut 
each half into three pieces, and remove all the larger bones. 
Pack the fish in la3'ers in a small stone jar. (Earthenw^are 
must not be used on account of the vinegar.) Sprinkle 
the salt and spices over each layer. Add one onion sliced 
thin, ii' you do not dislike the flavor. Add vinegar enough 
to completely cover the fish. Tie a thick paper over the 
top, or tie a cloth over and cover with a crust of dough to 
keep in all the steam. Bake in a ver}' moderate oven five 
or six hours. Remove the dough-crust, and when cooled 
cover, and keep in a cool place. 

This will keep some time, if the fish be kept under the 
vinegar ; the bones will be dissolved, and it makes an ex- 
cellent relish for lunch or tea. 

Rules for Fish Salad, Croquettes, and Chowder are given 
elsewhere. 



Salt Fish Balls. 



1 cup raw salt fish. 

1 pint potatoes. 

1 teaspoonf ul butter. 



1 egg, well beaten. 

3^ saltspoonful pepper. 

More salt, if needed. 



Wash the fish, pick in half-inch pieces, and free from 
bones. Pare the potatoes, and cut in quarters. Put the 
potatoes and fish in a stewpan, and cover with boiling 
water. Boil twent^'-five minutes, or till the potatoes are 
soft. Be careful not to let them boil long enough to be- 
come soggy. Drain off" all the water ; mash and beat the 
fish and potatoes till very light. Add the butter and 
pepper, and when slighdy cooled add the egg and more 
salt, if needed. Shape in a tablespoon without smoothing 
much, slip them off" into a basket, and fry in smoking h<4 



3^2 The Boston Cook Booh, 

lard one minute. Fiy only five at a time, as more will 
oool the fat. The lard should be hot enough to brown a 
piece of bread while j'ou count forty. Or, first dipping 
the spoon in the fat, take up a spoonful of the fish and 
plunge it into the hot fat. Drain on soft paper. 

These fish balls should be mixed while the potatoes and 
fish are hot. If 3'ou wish to prepare them the night 
before, omit the egg, and in the morning warm the fish 
and potato in a double boiler, then add the e^g. Keep the 
fish in a bowl of cold water while picking it apart, and 
it will need no further soaking. 

Contrary to all old theories, boiling the fish with the 
potato does not harden it. When well mashed and beaten 
with a strong fork, the fish will only be recognized in the 
potato by the taste, and not by the presence of hard, lumpy 
piec*as. Never chop salt fish. If picked apart into small 
pieces and then rubbed with a potato masher till it is re- 
duced to fine threads, it will blend with au}^ mixture 
better than it will when chopped. These are the most 
quickly prepared and the most delicious fish balls ever 
made, and are worthy the superlative adjectives which 
have been given them b}^ enthusiastic pupils. 

Fish Hash. — The same mixture as above, cooked in a 
little salt pork fat in a frying-pan till brown, and turned 
out like an omelet. 

Fish Souffle. — Prepare the fish as for fish balls ; add two 
taUespoonfuls of cream and two eggs, beaten separately ; and 
bake in a buttered dish. 

To prepare Salt Fish for Cooking, 

Soak over night in cold water with the skin side up, that 
the salt ma}^ be drawn out ; or, if 3^ou can, strip the skin 
ofl" before soaking. By changing the water often, less time 
will be required. Salt mackerel and other small corned fish 
should be broiled. Salt codfish should be put on the stove 
in fresh water and kept warm, but not boiling, till softened. 
Then remove the bones and skin, and flake in delicate 
pieces. Serve with egg or cream sauce, potatoes, sweet beets, 



Fish Roes. 173 



carrots^ and onions^ and crisp salt pork scraps, and yon have 
the old-fashioned saltjisli dinner. 

Creamed Salt Fish.- — Serve one cup of the picked up 
Jish in a rich cream sauce with potato border or on toast. 

Mock Oyster Stew. (Mrs. S. M. Bailey.) — Prepare one 
cup of salt Jish by washing, shredding, and simmering till 
soft ; when ready to serve, put it in a shallow dish with 
one pint of oyster crackers or three butter crackers split and 
browned, and pour over it one pint of hot milk. Add a 
tablespoonful of butter and half a scdtspoonful of pepper^ and 
serve. 

Scorched Salt Fish. — Pick a small piece of the thickest 
part of salt Jish into long flakes. If very salt, soak a few 
minutes in cold water. Brown over hot coals. Spread 
with butter, and serve hot. Fish thus prepared is a nice 
relish with potatoes which have been roasted in the ashes. 
It will also tempt a convalescent. Smoked salmon or hali- 
but may be prepared in the same manner. 

Tongues and Sounds. — Soak them in warm water several 
hours, or till freshened ; scrape off the skin. Cut them in 
small pieces and heat slowly in milk or water. Make a 
thin white sauce to pour over them, and serve on toast 
garnished with hard-boiled eggs. 

Fish Roes, Fried. 

Wash the roes and cook them ten minutes in boiling 
salted water with one tablespoonful of vinegar. Then 
plunge them into cold water. Drain, and roll in beaten 
egg., then in seasoned crumbs, and fry till brown in smok- 
ing hot fat. 

Scalloped Roes. — Boil the roes as in the preceding re- 
ceipt. Drain, and break up lightly with a fork. Sprinkle 
a layer of the roe in a shallow dish ; then rub the yolk of 
hard-boiled egg through a fine strainer. Add a sprinklin^g 
of parsley and a little le77ion juice. Moisten with a thin 
white sauce. Then another layer of roe, egg, seasoning, 
and sauce. Cover with buttered crumbs and bake till

brown. If a larger dish be required, use with the roes 
any cold Jlaked Jish, or a small quantity of cooked rice. 

Small Fresh Fish Baked in a Crust. 

Clean the fish, and wipe dry. Cut gashes one inch apart 
on each side ; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Make a rich 
biscuit crust with baking-powder, or make a pastry crust; 
roll it out half an inch thick ; wrap the fish in the crust, 
pinch the edges together, and bake about half an hour. 
Serve with egg sauce.

SHELL FISH. 

Oysters^ Clams^ Scallops^ Lobsters, Crabs, Shrimps, and 
Prawns are the principal varieties of shell fish used as 
food. 

Oysters. 

These shell fish are found in perfection in the cool waters 
of the Northern Atlantic coast. The Blue Points from 
Long Island are considered the best in the New York 
market. The Wareham and Providence River are equall}^ ja>^ 

esteemed in Boston. 03'sters are neither healthful nor 
well flavored from Ma}^ to September ; at all other times 
the}' are used more extensive^ and are more highly prized 
than an}^ other shell fish. They ar,3 nutritious, and are 
easil}' digested when fresh and eaten raw, or when only 
slightly cooked. When over-cooked, they are tough and 
leathery. Oysters should never be kept long after being 
taken from the shell ; and if to be used raw, should not 
be opened till just before using. 

Oysters cooked in the Shells. — Wash and scrub the shells, 
and put them in a pan with the round side down (to hold 
the juice), and cook either in a hot oven, on the top of a 
hot stove, on a gridiron over the coals, or in a steamer, 
ten to twenty minutes. When the shells open, the oysters 
are done. Remove the upper shell ; season the 03'ster on 
the lower shell with butter, pepper, salt, and vinegar, and 
serve at once. Or take from the shells, put into a hot 
dish, season, and serve immediately. There is no other 
wa}' of cooking the oyster in which the natural flavor is 
so fully developed. 

Haw Oysters. — Open the oysters ; look them over care- 
fulh' ; remove any fine pieces of shell which ma}' adhere to 
them ; then season slightly with salt and pepper, and let 



176 The Boston Cook Book. 

them stand half an hour in the ice chest. Serve on fancy 
oyster plates, or on the deep half-shell, with slices of lemon. 
Serve with small squares of buttered brown bread. 

Oysters on Ice. — Put a rectangular block of clear ice^ 
having smooth, regular surfaces, in a large pan. With a 
hot brick or flat-iron melt a cavity large enough to hold 
the desired number of oysters. Pour the water from the 
cavity, and fill with 03'sters, which should first be drained, 
and seasoned with salt and pepper. Place a thick napkin 
on a platter, put the ice upon this, cover the dish with 
parsley or smilax, and garnish with lemon. The ice is some- 
times roughl}' chipped to resemble a rock. If the dinner 
be served from the sideboard, individual plates of ice are 
made. 

To prepare Oysters for Cooking. — Pour half a cup of cold 
water over one quart of oysters ; then with clean hands 
take out the 03'sters separately and remove an}' bits of 
shell or seaweed. Serious accidents have often resulted 
from the presence of pieces of shell. The crabs which 
are found among the oj^sters are considered a delicac}^ 
and should be saved. The 03'ster liquor is seldom used, 
as enough comes from the 03'sters in cooking ; but, if de- 
sired, it should be strained before using. The 03'sters ma}' 
then be cooked in an3' of the following wa3'S. 

To cook or 2>ttrboil Oysters in their Liquor. — Put them 
in a saucepan without water ; stir them, or shake the pan 
slightl3' ; as soon as heated, sufficient liquor comes from 
them to keep them from burning. When the edges curl or 
ruffle, and the 03'sters look plump instead of flat, the3' 
are cooked. Season with salt., pepper^ and butter., and 
serve as a jjlain roast; or pour on toast ^ and call it a 
fancy roast. 

For Oyster Stew, see page 154. 

Smothered Oysters. — Put one tablespoonful of butter in a 
covered saucepan with half a saltspoonful of lohite pepper, 
one teaspoonful of salt, and a few grains of cayenne pepper. 
When hot, add one pint of oysters carefulh' prepared. 
Cover closel}', aud shake the pan to keep the 03'sters from 



Oi/sfers. lyy 



sticking; cook two or three minutes, or till plump. SeiTC 
on toasted crackers. 

Creamed Oysters. — Make one cup of thick cream sauce 
(see page 190), and season with salt^ pepper^ cayenne^ and 
celery salt. Wash and pick over one pint of oysters., and 
parboil until plump. Skim carefully ; drain and add them 
to the sauce. Serve on toast ^ and garnish the dish with 
points of toast; or the toast ma}' be omitted, and bread 
crumbs browned in butter sprinkled over the oysters. 
When served in patty shells or in a vol-au-vent., make the 
cream sauce thicker. 

Fricasseed Oysters. — Cook one pint of oysters in hot but- 
ter, till plump, as directed for smothered oysters. Drain, 
and keep the oysters hot, and add enough cream to the 
oyster liquor to make one cupful. Cook one tablespoonfuX 
of Jlour in one tablespoonful of hot butter. Add slowly the 
hot cream and oyster liquor. Season with one teaspoonful 
of lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste. Pour the sauce 
into one loell-beaten egg, add the hot 03'sters, and heat one 
minute. Serve on toast, if for breakfast ; or in paper 
cases, or patties, if for lunch or dinner. 

Scalloped Oysters. — One pint of solid oysters, washed 
and drained ; one third of a cup of melted butter; one cup of 
cracker or stale bread crumbs, moistened in the melted but- 
ter. Butter a shallow dish ; put in a layer of crumbst 
then a layer of oysters ; season with salt and pepper; and, 
if 3'ou like, add Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, wine, or 
mace. Then put in another la^'cr of crumbs, then 03'sters 
and seasoning, with a thick la3'er of crumbs on the top. 
Bake in a hot oven about twent}^ minutes, until the crumbs 
are brown. Many prefer to heat the 03'ster liquor and 
the butter with an equal quantity of milk or cream, and 
use more cracker. Moisten each la3'er of cracker with the 
hot liquid. Reserve the larger part of the butter for the 
top layer of crumbs. In this wa3' a larger dish ma3^ be 
prepared with the same quantity of oysters. 

Oysters en Coquille. — Prepare as for scalloped oysters. 
Put one or two very large or several smaller 03'sters in 

1 




178 Tlie Boston Cook Book. 

03'ster or scallop shells ; season, and cover with buttered 
crumbs. Bake till the crumbs are brown. Place the shells 
on small plates, and serve one to each person. 

Large scallop shells ma}' be obtained at the fish market, 
then cleaned and used several times. Tin, granite, or 
silver shells may also be used. 

Oysters and Mushrooms in Crusts. — Bake Parker- House- 
roll dough in round pans, or as small round biscuit placed 
some distance apart. When cold, cut a slice from the top 
of each, and remove the soft inside without breaking 
through the crust. Fill with the following mixture : — 

Parboil half a pint of oysters. Strain, and save the liquor. 
Cut the 03'sters fine, and mix with them half a can of 
chopped mushrooms. Mix the ouster liquor and mush- 
room juice with enough cream to make one pint in all. 
Pour this hot liquid slowly on one tahlespoonful of hutter 
and three of flour cooked together. Season highly with 
salt^ pepper, lemon juice, and cayenne. Pour this into the 
crusts, and serve at once. This dish is acceptable to 
those who cannot eat 03'sters in puff-paste patties. 

Pigs in Blankets, or Huttres au Lit. — Season large 03'S- 
ters with salt and pepper. Cut ver}' thin slices of fat 
bacon ; wrap each oyster in a slice of bacon, and fasten 
with a wooden skewer. Put in a hot omelet pan, and 
cook just long enough to crisp the bacon. Serve on small 
pieces of delicate toast. 

Fried Oysters. — Wash the 03'sters, drain, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, and let them stand twent3^ minutes. Roll 
first in seasoned crumbs, then dip in beaten egg mixed with 
one tablespoonful of milk ; roll in crumbs again, and fty one 
minute in smoking hot lard. Drain on paper, and garnish 
with chopped or sliced pickle, or chowchow. Serve with cold 
slaw or celery salad. 

Fried 03'sters are much better, and spatter less in fr3ing, 
if parboiled shghtly and drained before rolling in the 
crumbs. When only a few are wanted, and those espe- 
ciall3' nice, select the large 03'sters, roll them in fine crumbs, 
then in Mayonnaise dressing, then in crumbs again, and fry. 



Clams. 179 



Sauted Oysters. — Prepare as for fr3'ing, and brown on 
each side in hot butter ; or roll in the cracker only, and 
brown them. 

Oysters in Fritter Batter^ see page 107. 

Broiled Oysters. — Pick over, and drain large oysters. 
Dip in melted butter^ then in Jine cracker crumbs seasoned 
with salt and pepper. Butter a fine wire gridiron ; put 
the 03'sters in closel}', and broil till the juice flows. Some 
prefer to broil them without the crumbs, but more juice is 
lost in this way. 

Pickled Oysters. — Cook one quart of oysters in their 
liquor, till plump. Remove the oysters, and add to the 
liquor half a cup of good cider vinegar. Skim as it boils, 
and add one teaspoonful of salt., two blades of mace., ten 
cloves., ten peppercorns., ten allspice berries., and a few grains 
of cayenne pepper. Boil five minutes. Pour the liquor 
over the oysters, and when cold seal in glass jars, and put 
in a cool dark place. They will keep two weeks. 



Clams. 

Thin shell clams, and round shell clams, or quahaugs, 
furnish a delicious and wholesome form of food if eaten 
onl}' when fresh. The}^ are more easily opened and have 
a finer flavor when cooked in the shells. 

Steamed Clams. — Wash and scrub the shells. Put them 
in a kettle without water, cover closely, and cook till the 
shells open. Take them out with a skimmer, pour the 
clam water into a pitcher, and let it settle. Straining is 
not sufficient, as the fine sand will go through the finest 
strainer ; but the water will be clear if care be taken not 
to disturb the sediment. Remove the clams from the 
shells, peel off the thin skin around the edge, and cut off 
the whole of the black end. Scissors are better than a 
knife for this purpose. Rinse each clam in a little of the 
clam water, and if very large, cut the tough part into 
small pieces. When the water is clear, pour it into a 
saucepan, add the clams, and heat again till just hot, but 



i8o The Boston Cook Book. 

do not let them boil. Serve with brown bread., or toasted 
crackers; and let each person season them to taste with 
melted butter., pepper., and vinegar. 

Scalloped Cla7ns. — Prepare the clams as in steamed 
clams. Make a white sauce, as for fish (see page 189) ; 
put the clams in a shallow dish or in clean shells ; cover 
with the sauce and buttered crumbs, and bake till brown. 

For Clam Soup, Clam Chowder, and Clam Fritters, see 
the Index. 

A Clam Bake. 

An impromptu clam bake may be had at any time at 
low tide along the coast where clams are found. If 3'ou 
wish to have genuine fun, and to know what an appetite 
one can have for the bivalves, make up a pleasant party 
and dig for the clams yourselves. A short thick dress, 
shade hat, rubber boots, — or, better still, no boots at all, 
if you can bring your mind to the comfort of bare feet, 
-^— a small garden trowel, a fork, and a basket, and 3'ou are 
read}'. Let those who are not digging gather a large pile 
of driftwood and seaweed, alwaj's to be found along the 
shore. Select a dozen or more large stones, and of them 
make a level floor ; pile the driftwood upon them, and make 
a good brisk fire to heat the stones thoroughl3\ When hot 
enough to crackle as you sprinkle water upon them, brush 
off the embers, letting them fall between the stones. Put 
a thin layer of seaweed on the hot stones, to keep the 
lower clams from burning. Rinse the clams in salt water 
by plunging the basket which contains them in the briny 
pools near by. Pile them over the hot stones, heaping 
them high in the centre. Cover with a thick layer of sea- 
weed, and a piece of old canvas, blanket, carpet, or dry 
leaves, to keep in the steam. The time for baking will 
depend upon the size and quantity of the clams. Peep in 
occasionally at those around the edge. When the shells 
are open, the clams are done. The}' are delicious eaten 
from the shell, with no other sauce than their own briny 
sweetness, Melted butter, pepper, and vinegar should be 



Lobsters. 1 8 



ready for those wiio wish them ; then all ma^- " fall to." 
Fingers must be used. A Rhode Islander would laugh at 
an}' one trying to use a knife and fork. Pull off the thin 
skin, take them by the black end, dip them in the prepared 
butter, and bite off close to the end. If j^ou swallow them 
whole, the}' will not hurt you. At a genuine Rhode Island 
clam bake, blue-fish, lobsters, crabs, sweet potatoes, and 
ears of sweet corn in their gauzy husks are baked with 
the clams. The clam steam gives them a delicious flavor. 
Brown bread is served with the clams, and watermelon 
dessert completes the feast. 

Scallops, 

This shell fish has a round, deeply grooved shell. The 
muscle which unites the shell is the only part eaten. Scal- 
lops have a sweet flavor, and are in season during the fall 
ftnd winter. They may be stewed like oysters, but are 
better fried. 

Fried Scallops. — Pick over, and wash quickly ; drain 
between towels ; season fine cracker crumbs with salt and 
pepper. Dip the scallops in the crumbs, then in beaten egg, 
and again in crumbs. Fry in smoking hot fat, and seiTO 
at once. 

Lobsters. 

The markets are now so well supplied with these deli- 
cious shell fish, that they may be obtained in good condi- 
tion all the year. The canned lobster is also convenient 
in an emergency, for use in soups and salads. Lobsters 
are put alive into boiling salted water, and cooked twenty 
minutes from the time the water boils. They should not 
be eaten until cold, and never be kept more than eighteen 
hours after boiling. Lobsters are difficult of digestion, 
and should be eaten with mustard, cayenne pepper, and 
lemon juice or vinegar. 

To Choose a Lobster. — Select one of medium size, heavy 
in proportion to the size. Those with hard, solid shells, 
etreaked with black, will be found full of meat; those wita 




1 82 The Boston Cook Booh. 

thin shells are water}'. If the tail spring back quicklj 
when straightened, the lobster is fresh. 

To Open a Lobster. — Wipe the shell with a wet cloth. 
Break off the large claws, separate the tail from the bodj 
and the body from the shell, leaving the stomach, or lady, 
in the shell; then remove the small claws. Save the 
green liver and coral. Crush the tail by pressing the 
sides together, then pull it open on the under side, and 
take out the meat in one piece. Draw back the flesh 
on the upper end of this meat, and remove the intestinal 
canal, which runs the entire length. This is sometimes 
black, and sometimes the color of the meat. Break off all 
the gills on the body before picking the meat from tne 
Joints, as they are liable to drop off with the meat, and 
are too woolly to be palatable. The gills,- stomach, and 
intestines are the only parts not eaten. Break the body 
in the middle, and pick the meat from the joints, being 
careful not to take any of the bones. When the shells of 
the large claws are thin, cut off a strip down the sharp 
edge, and remove the meat whole ; or break them by 
hammering on the edge. Never pound them in the mid- 
dle, as that crushes the meat. If the lobster shell is to 
be used for serving the meat, cut down the under side of 
the tail with a sharp knife, and remove the meat without 
breaking the outside shell. Trim the inside, and clean 
the shell. The body shell may be cleaned, split in halves, 
and trimmed with sharp scissors into the shape of clam 
shells. 

Plain Lohster. — The simplest way of serving lobster is 
by man}' considered the best. Remove the meat from the 
shell, and arrange in a tasteful manner; or cut it into 
small pieces. Let each person season to taste with salt, 
pepper^ vinegar^ and oz7, or melted butter. 

Stewed Lobster. — Cut the lobster fine ; put it in a stew- 
pan, with a little milk or ^ream. Boil up once ; add one 
tablespoonful of butter, a little pepper, and serve plain or on 
toasted crackers. Cook lobster just long enough to heat it, 
as a longer cooking renders it tough. 



Crahs. 183 

Creamed Lobster. — For one jnnt of lobster meat cut fine, 
iiKike one 2>iiit o^ ivhite sauce (see puge 180). Season with 
salt, cayenne^ and lemon. Heat the lobster in the saiici^, 
but do not let it boil. Serve on toast. 

Curried Lobster. — Make a curry sauce (see page 190) 
and warm the diced lobster in the sauce. 




Fig. 9. Scalloped Lobster. 

Scalloped Lobster, — Season one pint of lobster., cut into 
dice, with salt., pepper^ and cayenne. Mix with one cup 
of cream sauce (see page 190) ; fill the lobster shells, using 
the tail shells of two lobsters. Cover the meat with 
cracker crumbs., moistened with melted butter. Bake till 
the crumbs are brown. Put the two shells together on a 
platter, with the tail ends out. to look like a long canoe. 
La}' the small claws over the side to represent oars. Gar- 
nish with parsley. The lobster ma^* also be served in 
scallop shells. 

Devilled I^obster. — The same as the preceding receipt, 
with the addition of more salt., pepper., and cayenne ; add, 
also, chopped 'parsley., onion juice., mustard., and Worcester^ 
shire sauce. 

For Lobster Soup., Chowder., Cutlets., Croquettes., and Salad, 
see the Index. 

Crabs. 

These are found near the coast of the Southern and 
Middle States, and are considered such a luxury in Marj'- 
land that special means are taken for their propagation. 
They are usually quite expensive in Eastern markets. 



1 84 The Boston Cook Booh, 

Crabs, like lobsters, shed their shell annuallj'. When the 
new shell is forming, they are called soft shell crabs, and 
are highly esteemed by epicures. 

Soft Shell Crabs. — Use them only when freshly caught, 
as the shells harden after twenty-four hours. Pull off the 
sand bags, and the shaggy substance from the side ; then 
wash, and wipe dry ; sprinkle with salt and pepper ; roll in 
crumbs^ then in egg^ again in crumbs; and fry in smoking 
hot lard. 

Boiled Crabs. — These should be heavy, of medium size, 
and with stiff joints. Plunge them head first into boihng 
water, and cook fifteen minutes ; then remove the outside 
shells and the shaggy substance, rinse in hot water, and 
arrange on a platter. They are eaten from the shell. 

Scalloped Crabs. — Pick the meat from the shells, mince 
it, and mix with a cream sauce ; season with salt and pep- 
per^ put the mixture in the crab shell or in scallop shells, 
cover with buttered cracher crinnbs, and bake till brown. 

Devilled Crabs. — Prepare as for scalloped crabs, add- 
ing mustard^ cayenne pepper.^ and lemon juice to the 
seasoning. 

Crab Salad. — Mix the meat with a Mayonnaise dress- 
ing^ pack in the crab shells, and garnish with sliced lemon 
and cresses. 

Shrimps. 

Shrimps and Prawns are found in the summer season on 
the Southern coasts. The}- are similar in form to a 
lobster, but ver}' small. The}' should be cooked in boiling 
salted water from five to eight minutes. Remove the 
shells and head ; the part that is eaten resembles in shape 
the tail of a lobster. They are used in fish sauces, and 
are ver}' eflfective as a garnish. 

Shrimp Salad and Shrimps en Coquille may be prepared 
like lobster. Canned shrimps are generallj' used in East- 
ern markets. 

Scalloped Shrimps. — Make a tomato sauce (see page 193). 
Pick over one can of shrimps, and heat them in the sauce i

add one glass of wine. Turn into a scallop disli, cover 
with buttered crumbs., and bake till the crumbs are brown. 



Reptiles. 

Fried Frogs. — Frogs are considered a delicacy by those 
who have cultivated a taste for them. If not already pre- 
pared for cooking, remove the skin from the hind legs., 
which is the only part used. Dip in crumbs., seasoned 
with salt and pepper., then in egg., and again in crumbs. 
Wipe the bone at the end ; put in a basket, and fry one 
minute in smoking hot fat. Drain, and serve in a circle.; 
around a centre of green peas. Some parboil them three 
minutes in boiling salted water and a little lemon juice^ 
before ftying. 

Frogs' legs may also be broiled., or they ma^^ be made 
into a white or brown fricassee, seasoned with mushrooms 
or tomato catchup. 

Terrapin. 

This expensive member of the turtle family is highly 
prized in Baltimore and Philadelphia, but seldom used 
'.a New England. Terrapin may be kept ahve through 
the winter by putting them in a barrel, where thej-.will 
not freeze, and feeding them occasionally with vegetable 
parings. Before cooking, soak them in strong salt water. 
Put them alive into boiling water, and boil rapidl}' ten 
or fifteen minutes. Remove the black outside skin from 
the shells, and the nails from the claws. AVash in warm 
water ; then put them on again, in fresh boihng water ; 
add a little salt, and boil about three quarters of an hour, 
or until the under shell cracks. Open them carefully over 
a bowl to save the gravy, remove the under shell, the sand 
bags, the head, and the gall bladder from the liver. If 
the gall bladder be broken in the process, the whole dish 
will be ruined by the escaping gall. Put the upper shells 
on to boil again in the same water, and boil until tender j" 
watch theip tjarefuUj', and take each out as soon i>Q

tender. Pick the liver and meat from the upper shell, and 
cut into several pieces. The intestines are used with the 
meat in winter, when the turtle is in a torpid condition ; 
but in the summer the^' should be thrown awa}-. Boil the 
intestines b}' themselves one hour. This should be pre- 
pared the day before. Heat the meat in the gi'av}'. To 
each terrapin add 07ie wineglassful of cream ^ half a cup of 
hutter, a little salt^ cayenne^ and one wineglassful of sherry. 
Use the turtle eggs if there be va\y ; if not, the yolhs of 
two hard-hoiled eggs to each terrapin. Rub smooth, mixing 
with raw yolk enough to make into balls the size of tur- 
tle eggs. Add these and the wine just as ^-ou send the 
dish to the table. 

Green Tartle Soup. 

The green turtle is highly prized on account of the deli- 
cious quality of its flesh ; but as it is very large and ex- 
pensive the canned turtle is more generally used. 

One can of green turtle^ one quart of hrown stock, tivo 
tahlespoonfuls each of butter and flour, one lemon. Cut the 
green fat into dice and la}' it aside. Simmer the remain- 
der of the turtle meat in the stock for half an hour. 
Brown the flour in the browned butter, add it to the soup, 
season highly with salt and pepper. Serve with thin slices 
of lemon, egg balls, and the reserved green fat. 

Crab Olio-- A Southern Recipe. 
Scald and skin six large, smooth tomatoes, and drain 
on a sieve until the water is out. Chop fine the me?it ipf 
four large crabs and the inside of o?ie egg-plant which 
has been boiled, also the cold tomatoes. Add three eggs, 
slightly beaten, salt and pepper to taste, a'ld half a cap 
of bread crumbs. Cook until warmed through in a 
tablesjwonful of butter, but do not brown it. Put it into 
the crab shells, cover with buttered crumbs, place the 
shells in a pan, and bake until the crumbs are brown. 



Drawn Butter tS'aiice. 187 



MEAT AND FISH SAUCES. 

Brawn Batter, or water and melted butter thickened 
with, flour, and seasoned, is the simplest form of a sauce. 

When milk, or cream, or white stock is used in place of 
water, less butter is required, and the sauce is called White, 
or Cream, or Bechamel sauce. 

By browning the butter, using brown stock, and adding 
different seasoning materials, we .have all the varieties of 
Brown sauces. 

Many people fail in making sauces by not cooking the 
flour sufficiently, and also by serving them with a mass of 
oily butter on the surface. Usually the flour is wet to a 
smooth paste and stirred into the boiling liquid. When 
made in this manner, the sauce should boil at least ten min- 
utes to have the flour thoroughly cooked. But by cooking 
the dry flour in the hot butter the starch in the flour is 
more quickly cooked, and the butter is all absorbed and 
converted into an emulsion. Sauces made in this manner 
are perfectl}^ smooth, free from grease, and have a fine 
flavor. Ever}^ one should learn how to make both white 
and brown sauces. They are adapted to nearly everj' 
form of food. Meats, fish, vegetables, eggs, macaroni, 
rice, toast, etc., are rendered more palatable by being 
served with an appropriate sauce. 

Drawn Butter Sauce. 



1 pint hot watep or 

white stock. 
y^ cup butter, scant 



2 tablespoonfuls flour. 
% teaspoonf 111 salt. 
% saltspoonf ul pepper. 



Put half the butter in a saucepan ; be careful not to let 
it become brown ; when melted, add the dry flour, and mix 



The Boston Cook Booh. 



well. Add the hot water, a little at a time, and stir 
rapidly as it thickens. When perfectly smooth, add the 
remainder of the butter in small pieces, and stir till it is 
absorbed. Add the salt and pepper. When carefully 
made, this sauce should be free from lumps ; but if not 
smooth, strain it before serving. 

The following sauces ma}' be made with one pint of 
this plain drawn butter as a foundation : — 

Caper Sauce (for Boiled Mutton). — Add six tablespoon- 
fuls of capers. Pickled Nasturtium seeds may be used in 
place of capers. 

Egg Sauce (for Baked or Boiled Fish). — Add two or 
three hard-boiled eggs^ sliced or chopped. 

Parsley Sauce (for Boiled Fish or Fowls) . — Add two 
iahlespoonfuls of chopped parsley. 

Lemon Sauce (for Boiled Fowl). — Add the juice and 
pulp of one large lemon, and the chicken liver boiled and 
mashed fine. 

Shrimp Sauce (for Fish) . — Add half a pint of shrimps, 
whole or chopped, two teaspoonfuls of lemon juice, and a few 
grains of cayenne pepper. 

Acid Sauce. — Add one tcdAespoonful of lemon juice or 
vinegar, and a few grains of cayenne pepper. 

Mustard Sauce (for Devilled Turkej', Salt Fish, etc.). — 
Add three tahlespoonfuls of mixed mustard and a little cayenne 
pepper. 

Lobster Sauce (for Boiled Fish). — One pint of lobster 
meat, cut into quarter-inch dice. Put the inner shells and 
scraggy parts in one and a half pints of cold water, and 
boil fifteen minutes. Strain and use the water in making 
one pint of drawn butter sauce. Add the lobster dice, the 
dried and powdered coral, a little cayenne pepper, and 
two tahlespoonfuls of lemon juice. 

Oyster Sauce (for Boiled Fish, Turke}', or Chicken). — 
Parboil one pint of oysters ; drain, and use the oyster liquor 
in making one pint of drawn hitter sauce. Season with 
celery salt and cayenne pepper. Add the 03'sters ; cook one 
minute longer, and pour it over the fish or chicken. Add 



White Sauce. 



the beaten 3'olk of one egg or one glass of claret wme^ if you 
wish a richer sauce. 

Oeler>/ Sauce (for Boiled Fowl). — ■ One pint of the ten- 
der part of celery^ cut very fine. Cook in boiling salted 
water ^ enough to cover, till tender. Drain ; add enough 
hot water to that in which the celery was cooked to make 
a pint, and use it in making one pint of drawn butter 
sauce. Add the cooked celery and the seasoning. 

Richer Drawn Butter Sauce. — Make a plain drawn 
butter sauce, and when ready to serve, pour it boiling hot 
into the well-beaten yolks of two eggs. Stir thoroughly, 
season to taste, and serve at once. 

Sauce Piquante. — Add one tablespoonful each of vinegar 
and lemon juice, two tablespoonfuls each of chopped capers, 
pickles, and olives, half a teaspoonful of onion juice, and «/ 
few grains of cayenne pepper, to one pint of drawn butter. 

White Sauce (for Vegetables, Chicken, Eggs, etc.). 



1 pint milk, or half milk and half 
white stock. 

2 tablespoonfuls butter. 



2 heaping tablespoonfuls flour. 

)^ teaspoonful salt. 
3^ saltspoonful pepper. 



Heat the milk over hot water. Put the butter in a 
granite saucepan, and stir till it melts and bubbles. Be 
careful not to brown it. Add the dr}' flour, and stir 
quickly till well mixed. Pour on one third of the milk. 
Let it boil, and stir well as it thickens ; tip the saucepan 
slightly to keep the sauce from sticking. Add another 
third of the milk ; let it boil up and thicken, and stir vig- 
oroush' till perfectl}^ smooth. Be sure that all the lumps 
are rubbed out while it is in this thick state. Then add 
the remainder of the milk ; let it boil, and when smooth 
add the salt and pepper, using more if high seasoning be 
desired. 

This white sauce may be used in place of drawn butter 
in any of the preceding rules. 

Bechamel Sauce. — A white sauce made partly with 
cream and partly with rich white stock, either veal or 



IQO The Boston Cook Book. 

chicken, according to directions for white sauce, is called 
Bechamel. 

The water in which celery, oysters, or lobsters have 
been cooked ma}- be mixed with milk in making sauces 
given under these names. 

For Fish a la creme and other preparations of fish, boil 
one slice of onion with the milk, or add half a teaspoonful of 
onion juice and one tahlespoonf id o^ chopped parsley. 

For Oysters^ add half a teaspoonful of celery salt^ a few 
grains of cayenne pepper^ and 07ie tablespoonful of lemon 
juice. 

For boiled Fowl^ add half a can of mushrooms. 

A richer white sauce is made by heating the yolhs of two 
eggs, and pouring the hot sauce into them just before 
serving. 

Curry Sauce (for Curried Eggs, Chicken, etc.). — Cook 
07ie tablespoonful of chopped onion in one tablespoonful of 
butter five minutes. Be careful not to burn it. Mix o7ie 
tablespoonful of curry powder with two tablespoonfuls oi flour y 
and stir it into the butter. Add one pint of hot milk grad- 
ually-, and stir as directed for white sauce. 



3^ teaspoonful salt. 
3^ saltspoonf ul pepper. 



Cream Sauce, No. 1. 

1 pint hot cream. 
1 heaping tablespoonful butter. 
"2 heaping tablespoonfuls flour. 

Make in the same manner as white sauce, and var}- the 
seasoning for the diflferent dishes for which it is to be 
used, as directed in white sauce. 

A thicker Cream Sauce is given under rules for Cro- 
quettes. 

Cream Sauce, No. 2. 

Warm one cup of cream. Beat the yolks of two eggs, 
strain them into the warm cream, and cook over hot 
water till the eggs thicken the cream like boiled custard. 
Stir all the time and when smooth and thickened remove 
from the fire, and add salt and pepper to taste. Serve 
with boiled celery, cauliflower, chicken, oysters, fish, etc. 



Brown Sauce, 191 



Brown Sauce. 



1 pint hot stock. 

2 tablespoonfuls minced onion. 
2 tablespoonfuls butter. 

2 heaping tablespoonfuls flour. 



32 teaspoonful salt. 
3^ saltspoonf ul pepper, 
1 tablespoonful lemon juice. 
Kitchen Bouquet to color. 



Mince the onion and fry it in the butter five minutes. 
Be careful not to burn it. When the butter is brown, add 
the dr}' flour and stir well. Add the hot stock a little at 
a time, and stir rapidly as it thickens, until perfect!}' 
smooth. Add the salt and pepper, using more if high 
seasoning be desired. Simmer five minutes, and strain 
to remove the onion. 

The stock for brown sauces ma}' be made from bones 
and remnants of any kind of meat, by soaking them in 
cold water, and boiling until the nutriment is extracted. 
The onion maj' be omitted if the flavor be not desired ; 
but the sauce is better with it if it be not burned. 

B3- the addition of different seasoning materials to this 
brown sauce a great variety of sauces may be made. Half 
the quantit}' given is sufficient for most entrees, or to 
use for an}' purpose in a small family. Be very careful 
not to burn the butter, as the desired color can better be 
obtained by adding Kitchen Bouquet. 

Brown Sauce Piquante (for Beef) . — To one cup of 
hrown sauce add one tablespoonful each of chopped pickles and 
capers. 

Sauce Poivrade. — Make one cup of hroivn sauce; add 
07ie teaspoonful of mixed herbs., thyme., parsley, bay leaf and 
cloves. Simmer ten minutes ; add two tablespoonfuls of 
claret., and strain. 

Sauce Robert. — To one cup of brown sauce., add one 
teaspoonful of sugar., one teaspoonful of made mustard., and

192 The Boston Cook Book, 

brown sauce, strain it, and add half a cup of melted currant 
jelly. Heat till the jelly is well mixed, and serve very 
hot. 

Olive Sauce (for Roast Duck). — Soak twelve olives 
in hot water enough to cover, thirty minutes, to extract 
the salt. Pare them round and round, close to the stone,

Eggs, 197 




EGGS. 

Whatever else jou may economize in, do not limit your 
family in respect to eggs. They are nutritious, and even 
at four cents each are cheaper than meat. They should 
be used freely by all except those who know the}- cannot 
digest them. Using freely does not mean their unnecessary 
or extravagant use in rich cakes, custards, etc., nor in tlie 
indigestible form of fried or what is ordinaril}- called hard- 
boiled eggs ; but it means the frequent use of them in any 
of the simple forms of boiling, baking, omelets, plain cake, 
and other wholesome combinations. It is very poor econ- 
om}', especially for those who keep hens, to exchange eggs 
for corned beef or salt fish ; or to use soda and cream of 
tartar as a substitute for eggs in sponge cake, or half- 
cooked flour in an omelet. They ma^^ be served in an 
unlimited variety of styles, are especially suitable for 
breakfast or lunch, attractive as a garnish, and when 
combined with sugar and milk make the most healthful 
puddings, desserts, or tea dishes. 

But though a type of perfect food, eggs are not intended 
to be eaten exclusively, any more than other foods. They 
are one of the most highly concentrated forms of food, and, 
being wholly destitute of starch, should be eaten with 
bread or rice 

The white of the e^^ has but a trace of fat in it, and 
requires the addition of butter, milk, or fat meat, like 
bacon or ham. The white of q^^ contains water, mineral 
ingredients, and soluble albumen ; the 3'olk has, in addi- 
tion to these, oil and sulphur. The albumen is enclosed 
in layers of thin- walled cells. When beaten, these walls 
break, and the albumen, owing to its glutinous nature, 
catches and holds the air, and increases to many times its 
oriorinal bulk. 



iqS The Boston Cook Book. 

Do not use an egg till it has been laid ten hours, as the 
white does not become set or thick till then, and cannot be 
beaten stiff. Eggs for poaching or boiling are best when 
thirty-six hours old. Albumen, when heated, becomes a 
dense solid ; if mixed and heated with a liquid, it hardens 
and entangles in its meshes any solids or impurities in the 
liquid, and rises to the surface with them as scum, or pre 
cipitates them. It is thus the white of egg clears soups^^ 
jelhes, and coffee. Strong acids, corrosive sublimate, 
and creosote will also coagulate albumen ; and there- 
fore, if any of tliese poisons be taken into the system, 
the white of egg, swallowed quickly, will combine with 
the poison and protect the stomach. 

The shells of newlj' laid eggs are almost full ; but as 
the shells are porous, on exposure to. the air, the water 
inside evaporates, and the eggs grow hghter, while air 
rushes in to fill the place of the water, and causes the 
nitrogenous elements to decompose, and the eggs soon 
spoil. This explains wh}^ a good Qgg is heav}', and will 
sink in water ; and why a stale egg is lighter, has a 
rattling or gurgling sound, and floats in the water. Any- 
thing which will fill up the pores and thus exclude the 
air, when applied to perfect!}' fresh eggs, will preserve 
them indefinitely ; a coating of hquid fat or gum, or a 
packing in Dran or salt, with the small end downward, is 
effectual. Eggs should be kept in a cool, dark place, 
and handled carefully, as any rough motion may cause 
the white and yolk to become mixed, by rupturing the 
membrane which separates them, and then the Qg^ spoils 
quick!}'. 

Never buy eggs about the freshness of which you have 
any doubt, not even in winter. One can easily judge 
which is the better economy, — to pay twenty-five or thirty 
cents a dozen, and find none of them full and fresh, and 
perhops half of tliem really rotten ; or to pay fifty cents, 
and obtain them freshly laid, — not merely fresh from the 
country, — and all sound and good. Eggs with a dark 
shell are richer and have larger yolks. Eggs are of better 



Boiled J^(jgs, 199 



flavor and more palatable in the spring, but are good 
and suitable, if perlectly fresh, at any season. 

Boiled Eggs (the Best Way). 

Put the eggs in a saucepan, cover with boiling water, 
and let them stand about ten minutes where the water 
will keep hot (180°), but not boiling. The white should 
be of a soft jell^'-like consistenc}', and the jolk soft but 
not liquid. Experience will show the exact time to keep 
the eggs in the water to suit individual tastes. The}'' 
should be served immediately, as they harden by being 
kept in the hot shell. An egg^ to be cooked soft, should 
never be cooked in hoiling water ^ as the white hardens un- 
evenl}' before the heat reaches the yolk. 

Hard-boiled Eggs. — Cook eggs for twenty minutes in 
water just below the boiling-point, for use in any receipt 
which specifies hard-boiled eggs. The 3'olk of an egg cooked 
ten minutes is tough and indigestible ; twentj' minutes will 
make the j^olk dry and mealy ; then it may be more easily 
rubbed smooth for salad or other mixtures, and more 
quickly penetrated by the gastric fluid. If the shell of an 
egg be cracked before boiling, pierce several small holes 
in the large end to keep the contents from bursting out at 
the crack. 

Dropped or Poached Eggs on Toast. 

Toast a slice of bread for each egg, and trim neatly, or 
cut with a round cutter before toasting. Have a very 
clean shallow pan nearly full of salted and boiling water. 
Remove all the scum, and let the water simmer. Break 
each egg carefuU}' into a cup, and slip it genth' into the 
water. Dip the water over them with a spoon, and when 
a film has formed on the yolk and the white is firm, take 
each up with a skimmer ; drain, trim the edges, and place 
on the toast. Put a bit of butter and a little salt and 
pepper on each Qgg ; or make a thin cream sauce and 
pour it around them. Put a tablespoonful of lemon juice 



200 The Boston Cook Book. 

in the water, or poach the eggs in muffin-rings to give 
them a better shape. An egg-poacher, something like a 
castor with perforated cups, is ver^' convenient. 

No. 2. — Spread the toast with butter and anchovy 
paste or sardine paste ^ and serve a poached egg on each 
slice ; or spread the toast with potted or finely minced 
boiled ham. 

Ham and Eggs. — Serve poached eggs on thin slices of 
broiled ov fried ham; when served on hot, highly seasoned 
boiled rice^ they are called Spanish Eggs. 

Eggs poached in Tomatoes^ or a la Dauphine. (31. E, 
Clarke.) — Stew slowly for ten minutes half a can of toma^ 
toes and one small oniony cut fine. Season highly with salt 
and pepper and butter. Break six eggs into a bowl with- 
out beating, and when everything else is ready to serve 
slip them into the hot tomatoes. Lift the white care- 
fully with a fork, as it cooks, until it is all firm; then 
prick the yolks and let them mix with the tomato and 
white. It should be quite soft, but with the red toma- 
toes, the white and yellow of the egg, quite distinct. 
Serve at once on toast. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Beat four eggs slightly with a fork ; 
add half a teaspoonful of scdt^ half a saltspoonful of pepper ., 
and half a cup of milk. Turn into a hot buttered omelet 
pan and cook quickl}', stirring all the time till the ^g% is 
fii*m but soft. SeiTe on toast or with hot minced ham or 
veal. Any of the ingredients given in fanc}' omelets may 
be mixed with the beaten eggs before cooking. 

No. 2. — Put a tablespoonfid of butter in an omelet pan : 
when hot, add three whole eggs ; stir quickl}^ till the mix- 
ture is finn but soft. Add a little salt and pepper, and 
serve at once. 

Omelets. 

Beat the yolhs of two eggs till light- colored and thick ; 
add two tablespoonfuls of milk^ one saltspoonful of salt^ and 
one fourth of a saltspoonful of pepper. Beat the ivhitei 
of tivo eggs till stiff and dr3\ Cut and fold them lightly 
into the j^olks till just covered. Have a clean, smooth

omelet pan. When hot, rub it round the edge with a 
teaspoonful of butter on a broad knife ; let the butter run 
all over the pan and Avhen bubbling turn in the omelet 
quickly and spread it evenly on the pan. Lift the pan 
from the hottest part of the fire and cook carefully, un 
slightly browned l, 

underneath ; slip _^ ,,,^^__.,_,^ \^^ 

the knife under 
to keep it from 
burning in the 
middle. Put it on 
the oven grate to 
dry (not brown) 

the top. When the whole centre is dry as 3'ou cut into it, 
run a knife round the edge, then under the half nearest 
the handle, and fold over to the right. Hold the edge of 
a hot platter against the lower edge of the pan, and in- 
vert the omelet upon the platter. Or add only half of the 
beaten whites to the 3'olks, and when nearl}^ cooked spread 
the remainder over the top ; let it heat through ; fold over, 
and the white will burst out round the edge like a border 
of foam, making 2^ foam omelet^ or any fanc}' name you may 
choose to give it. 

If 3'OU have no omelet pan, or no convenience for dry- 
ing the omelet in the oven, use a smooth iron spider or 
frying-pan with a tin cover, and double the quantities 
given. Heat the pan and the cover ver}^ hot. Butter the 
pan, turn in the mixture, cover it, and place on the back 
of the stove for five minutes, or till firm. Fold as usual. 
Omelets should be only slightly browned, never burned, 
as the flavor of scorched Qg^ is not agreeable. 

One tahlespoonful of chopped parsley^ or a teaspoonful of 
fine grated onion ^ or two or three tablespoonfuls of grated 
sweet com may be added to the yolks before cooking. 

Thin slices of cold ham^ or three spoonfuls of chopped ham^

cheese, — ma}^ be spread on the omelet before folding, 
giving all the varieties of fancy omelets^ each variety taking 
the name of the additional ingredient. 

]^Q^ 2. — Beat six eggs until light and foamy with a Dover 
egg-beater ; add half a teaspoonfid of salt and one scant salt- 
spoonful of pepper, and one cup of 7nilk. Fry a large spoon- 
ful at a time in a hot pan or on a griddle, and roll over 
quickl}' like a French pancake. This is a convenient wa}^ 
where the family come irregularly to breakfast. The mix- 
ture may stand for some time if beaten again thoroughly 
before frying. 

Creamy Omelet. {Mrs. Ewing.) — Beat/owr eggs slightly 
with a spoon till you can take up a spoonful. Add a 
scant half-teaspoonful of salt, half a saltspoonful of pepper, 
four taUespoonfuls of milk or cream, and mix well. Butter 
a hot omelet pan, and before the butter browns turn in 
the mixture. Then with the point of a fork pick or lift 
up the cooked egg from the centre and let the uncooked 
eo-o- run under. This leaves the butter on the pan, and 
is better than stirring. Continue the lifting until the whole 
is of a soft creamy consistency ; then place it over a 
hotter part of the fire to brown slightly ; fold and turn out 
as usual. 

Sweet or Jelly Omelet. — Allow a teaspoonful of powdered 
sugar to each egg, and omit the pepper. Mix and cook 
as in Omelet No= 1, and when ready to fold put two or 
three table spoonfuls of an}' kind of preserves, marmalade, 
ov jelly on the top. Fold and sprinkle with sugar. 

Orange Omelet. — The thinly 
grated rind of one orange and 
three tahlespoonfids of the 
juice, three eggs, and three tea- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar.

Ueat the yolks; add the sugar, 
rind, and juice; fold in the heaten whites, and cook as 
in Omelet, No. 1. Fold, turn out, sprinkle thickly 
with powdered sugar, and score in diagonal lines with a 
clean red-hot poker. The buinit sugar gives to the omelet

a delicious flavor. Or cut the orange into sections, re- 
move tlie seeds and tough inner skin ; cut each section 
into pieces, and mix with the yolks before cooking ; or 
spread part of the orange over the omelet before folding, 
and sprinkle the remainder over the sugared top. 

This is a convenient dessert for an emergenc}', and may 
be prepared in ten minutes if one have the oranges. 

Omelet Souffle. — Allow a heaping teaspoonful of pow- 
dered sugar, a few drops of lemon or vanilla for flavoring, 
and two whites to each 3'olk. To make a small omelet, 
beat the yolks of two eggs till light and thick ; add two 
heaping teaspoonfuls of powdered sugar and half a teaspoon- 
ful of lemon or vanilla. Beat the whites of four eggs till 
stiff and dr}', and fold them lightl}' into the yolks. Put it 
b}' the tablespoonfuls lightly into a well-buttered baking- 
dish. Cook in a moderate oven about twelve minutes, or 
till well pufled up and a straw comes out clean. Serve at 
once, as it falls quickly. 



Baked Eggs. 

Small stone china dishes or egg-shirrers, holding one oi 
two eggs for each person, are convenient for this method 
of serving eggs ; or use a common platter placed over hot 
water ; or bake in the shells in a moderate oven ten minutes, 
first pricking several holes with a large pin in the large end 
of the Qgg^ to keep the air within from bursting the shell 
as it expands c 

No. 1. — Break each egg into a cup, being careful not to 
break the yolk, and put the eggs on a hot buttered dish 
suitable for serving. Put a little salt on each egg. Bake 
until the white is firm. Add a little butter and serve 
at once. Garnish each ^gg with thin strips of breakfast 
bacon. 

No. 2. — Cover the buttered dish Yf\i]ifine cracker crumbs. 
Put each o^gg carefull}^ in the dish, and cover lightl}^ with 
seasoned and buttered crumbs. Bake till the crumbs are 
brown.

No. 3. — Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and 
salt sUghtl}'. Spread it roughly on a platter ; make a 
nest or cavit}' for each 3'olk some distance apart. Season, 
and bake till the white is brown. 

No. 4. — Cover the dish with any poultry gravy 3'ou may 
chance to have, or with wldte sauce ^ and have a slice of 
toast or bread sauted for each ^g^. Set the platter in the 
oven over a pan of hot wtiter, and when toast and gravy 
are hot drop the eggs on the toast, and bake till the eggs 
are set. 

Eggs en Coquille, — Cut slices of stale bread in large rounds ; 
then with a smaller cutter cut half-wa}' through and scoop 
out the centre, leaving them shaped like a pate shell, with 
the cavity large enough to hold one egg. Dip these bread 
shells in i^aw egg^ beaten with a little milk^ and saute, or 
fty them in hot fat. Put them on a platter covered with 
hot white sauce or poultry gravy ^ and serve a poached egg 
in each shell ; or put a raw egg in each and bake till the 
eggs are set. Half a cup of chopped or sliced mushrooms 
m2iy be cooked in the grav}'. The shells may be toasted if 
you prefer. 

No. 2. — Take half a cup of soft bread crumbs^ an equal 
amount of f)ie chopped ham or tongue, and a little pepper, 
salt, parsley, mustard, and melted butter. Make it into a 
smooth paste with hot milk or cream. Spread the mixture 
on some scallop shells. Break the eggs carefully, and put 
one in the centre of each shell ; sprinkle with a little salt 
and pepper, and^we cracker crumbs moistened with melted 
butter. Set in the oven, and bake five or six minutes, or 
until the egg is firm. Or put the bread and meat mixture 
in a baking-dish, shaping it a httle to hold six or seven 
raw eggs ; cover lightly with buttered crumbs, and bake till 
the whites of the eggs are firm. 

Eggs and Minced Meat. — Chop one pint of cold chicken, 
ham, or veal fine, and rub it to a smooth paste ; add one table- 
spoonful of melted butter, one tahlespoonful of chopped parsley, 
salt and pepper to taste, and two beaten eggs, [f too dry, 
moisten "with a little cream, or stock or gravy, but do not

have it too soft to shape. Heat it in a frying-pan just 
enough to warm through, letting it dry off if too moist. 
Form it on a hot platter into a flat mound ; hollow the cen- 
tre, leaving a ridge of the mixture round the edge. Keep 
it hot, and put three or four poached eggs in the centre- 




Fig. 12. Eggs and Minced Meat. 

Garnish with triangles of toast laid round the base of the 
meat. Or, if you have a larger quantity of meat, prepare 
as above, and make a mound one inch deep on a round 
dish and a smaller mound above that, and place eggs 
baked in cups, or hard-boiled eggs cut in halves, or egg 
baskets on the space between the mounds. Garnish with 
parsley. 

Pannikins. — Warm minced ham or tongue or veal in a 
thick cream sauce, and pile it in the centre of a platter. 
Heat and butter some earthen cups, break an egg in each, 
and bake till the egg is firm. Turn them out and arrange 
round the meat. 



Various Ways of Serving Hard-boiled Eggs. 

Curried Eggs. — Boil six eggs twenty minutes. Remove 
the shells and cut into halves or slices. Fry one teaspoon- 
ful of chopped onion in one tahlespoonful of butter., being 
careful not to burn it ; add one heaping tahlespoonful of 
flour or one even tahlespoonful of coimstarch mixed with hcdj 
a tahlespoonful of curry powder. Pour on slowl}^ one cup 
and a half of white stock or milk or cream ; add salt and 
pepper to taste. Simmer till the onions are soft. Add

the eggs, and when warmed through serve in a shallow 
dish ; or arrange the eggs on hot toast^ and pour the 
sauce over them ; or cover with buttered crumbs and bake 
till the crumbs are brown. 

Egg Vermicelli. — Boil three eggs twent}^ minutes. Sepa- 
rate the 3'olks and chop the whites fine. Toast four slices 
of bread; cut half into small squares and half into points 
or triangles. Make one cup of thin white sauce with one 
cup of cream or milk^ one teaspoonful of butter^ one heaping 
teaspoonful of Jiour^ half a teaspoonful of salt^ and half a 
saltspoonful of pepper. Stir the whites into the sauce, and 
when hot pour it over the squares of toast. Rub the 
yolks through a fine strainer over the whole, and garnish 
with a border of toast points and a bit of parsley in the 
centre. 

Or cut the bread into rounds before toasting. Pour the 
white sauce on the hot platter, and put the rounds of toast 
on the sauce some distance apart. Put a little of the 
chopped white on each slice, pile it high on the edge, rub 
the 3'olks through a fine strainer over the centre, and lay 
small sprigs of fine parsley between the toast. 

Stuffed Eggs. — Boil six eggs twenty minutes. Re- 
move the shells and cut carefulh' lengthwise. Remove 
the yolks, and put the two whites of each egg together, 

that the}' ma}' not become 
mixed. Mash the yolks, 
and add one teaspoonful of 
soft butter.^ a feio drops of

any chicken or veal gravy ; sprinkle buttered crumbs over the 
whole, and bake till the crumbs are a delicate brown.

put together as above, roll each Qg^ in fine bread crumbs 
and beaten egg and in crumbs again, then repeat the pro- 
cess, and fty in smoking hot fat. Drain, and serve hot 
with tomato sauce or garnished with parsley. 

Scotch Eggs. — One cup of lean cooked ham chopped 
ver\' fine ; six hard-boiled eggs. Cook one third of a cup of 
stale bread crumbs in one third of a cup of milk to a smooth 
paste. Mix it with the ham ; add half a teaspoonful of 
mixed mustard^ half a saltspoonful of cayenne^ and one raw 
egg. Mix well^ remove the shells from the eggs, and cover 
"with the mixture. Fr}^ in hot fat two minutes. Drain, 
and serve hot or cold, for lunch or picnics. Cut them into 
halves lengthwise, and arrange each half on a bed of fine 
parsley. The contrast between the green, red, white, and 
yellow gives a ver3' pretty efl^ect. 

No. 2. —Boil six eggs twent}' minutes. Make a force- 
meat with one cup of any kind of cold meat finel}' chopped, 
half a cup of soft bread crumbs cooked to a paste, in one 
third of a cup of milk and one raw egg., beaten light, nsing 
just enough of the Q,gg to unite the mixture, being careful 
not to have it too soft. 

If chicken be used, season with chopped parsley and a 
pinch of herbs ; season ham with mustard and cayenne ; 
veal, with lemoii juice or horseradish ; and salmon, with 
lemon and cayenne. 

Divide the eggs crosswise or lengthwise, or leave them 
whole. Cover each half or whole egg thickly with the 
force-meat, and place them on a buttered tin pan and bake 
in a hot oven till slightl}' browned. Arrange on a hot 
platter with a white sauce poured around (not over) them. 

Scalloped Eggs. — Boil six eggs twent}^ minutes. Make 
one pint of white sauce with stock and cream or milk., and

buttered crumbs in a buttered scallop dish, then a la3'er of 
chopped whites^ lohite sauce, minced meat, yolks rubbed 
through a fine strainer, and so on, until the material is all 
used, having the buttered crumbs on the top. Bake till 
the crumbs are brown. 

Bgg Balls in Baskets. — Boil thi-ee eggs twent}' minutes. 
Remove the shells, cut oflT a thin slice at each end, that 
the eggs may stand upright, and cut in halves cr6sswise. 
Remove the yolks, and stand the cups or baskets thus made 
around the edge of a platter. Rub the yolks to a smooth 
paste ; add an equal amount of cooked ham or tongue, 
chopped fine, one tablespoonful of melted butter, salt, pep- 
per, and mustard to taste. Make into balls the size of 
the original yolks, and fill the cups. Make o?ie cup of 
white sauce, with cream or 77iilk and white stock, seasoned 
with salt and pepper. Pour it in the centre of the eggs. 
Set the platter in the oven a few minutes, and when ready 
to serve put a tiny bit of parsley on each ball. 

In place of the meat, you ma}- use, if 3'ou prefer, two 
tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, a speck of cayenne pepper, 
and moisten with vinegar and olive oil. 

Eggs a la Creme. 

Boil three eggs twenty minutes. Cut oflT a shce at each 
end, and cut the eggs in halves crosswise. Remove the

taste. Fill the white 
cups with the mixture. Place them on a shallow dish and 
pour one cup of thick cream sauce (page 190) around them. 
The sauce should come nearly to the top of the cups. Or 
cut the eggs in halves, and place them with the cut side 
down and serve in the sauce.

Eggs in a Nest. 

Boil six eggs twent}' minutes. Remove the shells. 
Separate the yolks witliout breaking ; or rub them to a 
smooth paste with a little olive oil to moisten, and 
sliape into small balls. Cut the whites in thin narrow 
slices, and mix with them an equal quantit}^ of fine 
shredded cliichen^ ham^ or salmon^ and a tablespoonful of fine 
sprigs o^ parsleg. Pile this mixture, which should be light 
and dry, on a platter in a circular or oval ring, and put 
the 3'olks in the centre. Set tiie platter in a steamer, to 
heat the mixture. Make a pint of' thick white sauce ; pour 
enough of it round the edge of the dish to come half-way 
up the nest, and serve the remainder in a sauce-boat. 

The same materials may be served cold as Devilled 
Eggs. Mix a little cayenne pepper and made mustard with 
the yolhs and also with the shredded meat ; add a sprink- 
ling of vinegar^ and garnish the dish with parsley or water- 
cresses. Or serve as a salad, garnished with cresses or 
lettuce., and sprinkle a French dressing over the whole. 

Egg Salad ma}' be served in this form. Cut the yolks in 
dice, and mix them lightl}- with diced chicken, salmon, fish^ 
or lobster; fill the white cups heaping with the mixture, 
and serve on a bed of lettuce or cresses, with French or 
Mayonnaise dressing. 

Egg Timbales. 
Beat six eggs lightly with fork till well mixed, add one 
and one-half cups of milk, one teaspoonful of salt, a little 
pepper rf one teaspoonful of minced jyarsley., one-fourth tea- 
spoonful of onion juice ; stir all well, pour into well-biittered 
moulds, — set in pan of hot water, and cook in moderate 
oven till firm. Serve with either cream or tomato sauce. 

Hot Eggs. 
Into a hot bowl kept in very hot water break tico eggs, 
add one teaspoon of butter and a dash of salt and pepper^ 
beat them slightly, and when they taste hot, serve at 
once. Excellent when nourishment is needed quickly.

MEAT. 

Meat is a general term applied to the flesh of animals 
used for food. It includes the muscular flesh, sinews, fat, 
heart, liver, stomach, brains, and tongue. Meat is divided 
into three classes : — 

3£eat, including beef, veal, mutton, lamb, and pork. 

Poultry^ including chicken, turke3\ geese, and ducks, or 
all domestic fowls. 

Game., including partridges, grouse, pigeons, quail, or 
other birds, venison, and anj^ wild meat that is hunted 
in the forest or field. 

Meat consists of several substances, — fihrine., albumen., 
gelatine., fat .f and \hQ, juice of flesh. 

Fihrine exists in the blood and flesh. In the former 
it is soluble, owing to the alkaline nature of the blood ; 
it is deposited by the blood, made into flesh, and becomes 
insoluble flesh-fibrine, and forms the basis or fibre of mus- 
cular tissue. It is separated into bundles b}' membranes, 
and into larger separate masses by cellular tissue, in 
which fat is deposited. Its true color is white ; but the 
blood in the veins which penetrate every part of the fibre 
gives it a reddish tinge. This may be seen by washing 
a piece of lean meat in cold water. The red coloring 
matter is soon drawn into the water, and the meat is a 
mass of white fibre. Fibrine is hardened and contracted 
by intense heat, but softened by moderate and long- 
continued heat. Meat that has tough fibre should simmer 
and not boil. 

Albumen exists in the flesh and in the blood. It is the 
soluble portion of the flesh. It dissolves in cokl water, 
but hardens in hot water. 

Gelatine is a peculiar substance found in the tendons 



Meat. 2 1 1 

and gristly parts of flesh, the shin, and the sinewy parts 
about the joints, and in the nutritive parts of bones. It 
may be dissolved by soaking in cold water, and then boil- 
ing gentl}' for several hours. The solution hardens when 
cold. Gelatine hardens in a dvy heat, and such parts of 
meat as contain it in abundance should be stewed, rather 
than roasted or broiled. 

Fat of meat is contained, a good measure of it, in the 
adipose tissue of almost all flesh which is used as food. 
It is liquefied by heat, and resolved into various acid and 
acrid bodies. It is a warmth-giver, and is therefore most 
appropriately used in cold seasons and climates. 

The juice of the flesh consists of water, a small propor- 
tion of albumen, and a mixture of other compounds. It 
is not the blood, for it still exists after the blood has been 
withdrawn. It may be obtained by chopping lean meat 
fine, putting it in a closel}' covered jar without water, and 
heating it graduall}'. If heated above 160°, the albumi- 
nous matters in it harden and turn brown. The solid 
residue, consisting of fibres, tissue, etc., is white, tasteless, 
and inodorous. This separated juice is strongl}^ acid, 
while the blood is always alkaline. It contains many sub- 
stances which are ver^^ valuable as food, and the savor}" 
principle, or ozmazome^ which gives flavor to the meat and 
causes it to differ in different animals. Meat should 
alwaj's be cooked in such a manner as to retain the largest 
proportion of this juice. The juice is drawn out into the 
brine in salting, and this renders salt meat less nutritious. 
The juice when the water has been separated from it by 
evaporation, is termed extract of meat. 

The flesh of all 3'oung animals is more tender, but not 
so nutritious as that of maturer animals. Nearly all parts 
of an animal may be used as food. 

Meat is in season all the year ; bnt certain kinds are 
better at stated times. Porh is good onh' in autumn and 
winter ; veal^ in the spring and summer ; venison^ in the 
winter ; fowls, in autumn and winter ; Jamh, in the summer 
and fall ; mutton and beef at any time.

All meat should be removed from the brown paper in 
which it is wrapped as soon as it comes from the market, 
or it will taste of the paper and the paper will absorb the 
meat juices. Wipe all over with a clean wet cloth. 
Chops and steaks will keep sweet much longer if examined 
at once, and an}' parts that are not clean and sweet 
removed. In warm weather look at the meat often. Put 
it on a dish near, but never directly upon, the ice.

BEEF. 



Good beef should be bright red, well marbled with yel- 
lowish-white fat, and with a thick outside layer of fat. 
The flesh must be firm, and when pressed with the finger 
no mark should be left. The suet should be dry, and 
crumble easil}^ 

A side of beef is divided into the hind quarter and 
fore quarter^ The hind quarter consists of the round, 
the rump, and the loin. The fore quarter is divided 
into the back half and the rattle rand. In cutting up a 
hind quarter, the flank is first removed. The cut should 
slant two or three inches toward the tip. The upper part 

of the flank has 
the ends of the 
short ribs, and is 
used for corning. 
The lower end of 
the flank has no 
bones. This may 
be stuffed, rolled, 
and boiled, either 
fresh or corned. 
The round is sep- 
arated from the 
rump in the line 
from 7 to 9. The aitch bone (7) lies between the back 
and middle cut of the rump and the top of the round. It 
is usually sold whole ; it makes a good roast for a small 
family, considering the price (10 cents), and is the best 
piece for a beef stew. 

The first cuts of the vein (9) which joins the face of 
the rump make good steak. The top of the round is 




Fig. 17, Aitch Bone. 



Beef. 



215 



the inside of the thickest part of the leg (8^, behind 8 
in the diagram) . As seen on the connter, it is above the 
bone. It consists of one hxrge section or muscle with a 
thick edge of fat. The best round steaks lie between this 
point and the ridge of fat. The thil-d slice is considered 
the best. After cutting beyond this ridge comes the 
beginning of another muscle, which is ver}' tough. One 
may easily detect, by the separation of this narrow strip of 
meat along the top of the slice, whether the meat came 
from the best part of the top of the round. It may be the 




Fig. 18. Round, showing the beginning of tlie tough muscle on the top. 

best the marketman has ; but it is not the best cut, though 
often palmed off in place of the third slice. The under 
part of the round has two sections or muscles, the one 
nearest the bone being larger than the outside section. 
The skin is thin, with ver}' little fat. Steaks from this cut 
are sometimes sold as good round steak to the ignorant 
bu3'er ; but keep in mind that in the top cut there is one 
large muscle witli thick fat, instead of two smaller muscles 
and thin fat, and 3'ou will not be deceived. This under 
c\\^ of the round is excellent for braising. It is well shaped, 
requires no trimming, and is the cheapest cut, as every 
scrap of it ma}' be eaten. Below this, as we follow down 
the leg, are nice pieces for stews, pie meat, etc. 

The marrow bone, running through the round to the 
shin, contains the best marrow. The next best is in the 



2l6

foreshin. The hind shin differs from the fore shin in hav- 
ing a thick tendon, which separates entirely- from the end 
of tlie leg, and nnites again at the joint, forming a loop by 
which the hind quarter is hung on the meat hook. The 

middle cut. of the 
sliin may be used 
for stews and brais- 
ing, and the lower 
part for soups. 

The rump is usu- 
ally separated from 
the loin, and divid- 
ed into the back, 
middle, and face 
of the rump. The 
back of the rump, one of the best pieces for roasting, has 
part of the backbone and sometimes the rump bone, as 
some marketmen will not cut it out before weighing. 
The small end nearest the loin has the most tender meat. 




Fig. 



Back of Rump. 




Pig. 20. First Cut of Sirloin, sliowing the bulging 
on upper edge. 



The middle cut has no bone, but it is not 
tender. It is better for braising than for roasting. Some- 
times the rump is not divided, and is cut into steaks. If 
cut |)arallcl with the backbone, 11 will be tough. If cut at 
nglit angles, and from the end nearest the loin, it makes the

best steaks, and is well worth the extra price charged for 
cutting in this manner. The face of the rump has a thick 
piece of fat in the middle, often purposely covered by a 
thin cutting from the ten- 
derloin. This is a cheap 
piece for roasting, l)ut not 
of the best quality. 

The sirloin is separated 
from the rump in a slant- 
ing direction. Never buy 
the first slice, as it always 
has a small narrow bone 
near the top in addition to 
the rib, and a larger por- 
tion of tough flank and 
gristle than the middle or 
second cuts. As it lies on 
the counter 3'ou may easily 

tell if it be the first slice by the small bone ; and if you 
press on the top of tlie meat near the middle, a small sec- 
tion of meat bulges out. This is the end of the muscle 
forming the face of the rump and vein, and is very tough. 
The second cut of sirloin has the most tenderloin, and 
only a straight rib at right angles with the backbone. 
An3' part after the first slice is taken oflT, until you come 
to the tip, is called the second cut, and is sold for roasts 
or steak. The tip is very juicy. The whole hind-quarter 
is hung up by the shin, the juices all flow down, and the 
tip holds a large portion. The muscles which are the least 
used have the most tender fibre and the least juice. These 
muscles, lying along the loin or middle of the backbone, 
above the ribs, and forming the top of the sirloin, are more 
tender, but less juicy, than those of the rump and round. 
The tenderloin, lying along the middle of the back under 
the sirloin, from below the tip to the face of the rump, is 
protected b}^ its bed of suet below, and its roof of bones 
above. It is a muscle very little used, is vcrj' tender, 
but dry, and entirely without flavor. This is removed

whole, and sold as the long fillet ; or divided, and the 
smaller part, 13'ing under the rump, sold as the short 
fillet. 

In cold weather it is economy to buy a large sirloin. 
Remove the fillet, or tenderloin, and cook that first, as it

spoils easily ; corn the flank, or use it for a stew ; and 
roast the upper part. If ver}^ large, roast it slightly the 
first time, and it may be roasted again for a second dinner. 

The Fore Quarter. 

The back half of the fore quarter has the backbone on 
the upper edge. The best roasting piece is the first cut of 
the rib, which joins the tip of the sirloin, and is sometimes 
sold for the tip. The tip has only one thick muscle above 
the rib, and the bones are usuallv slanting. One side of 
the first cut of the rib looks just like the tip ; the other 
side has the beginning of another tough muscle next to the 
skin, and the bones are straight. There are ten ribs in 
the fore quarter; three are left in the sirloin. This first 
cut may be one, two, three, or four libs ; but two are 
enough to roast for a small famil3\ The shoulder blade 
begins in the fifth rib, and above this lie what are called 
the chuck ribs. The meat above the blade is tough, and

219 



only suitable for stews. The part nnderneatli is cut into 
small steaks, and is often offered for sale as sirloin steaks. 
The shoulder of mutton, just above the fore shin, is good 
for braising and pie 
meat. ^ 

The rattle rand is 
divided into three 
long narrow strips, 
thick and lean at 
the upper end, and 
thin and fat at the 
lower end, all of 
which are usually 
corned. The upper 
part, called the rat- 
tle, is divided into 
three cuts. The 

thick upper end is preferred by those who like lean corned 
beef. The second cut has straight ribs running through it, 
and three distinct laj^rs of meat with fat, and is considered 
the choicest piece by those who like " a streak of fat and 




Fig. 23. First Cut of Rilt. 




Fig. 24. Chuck Rib, with six ribs removed. 



a streak of lean." The middle strip has a thick layer of 
fat, and only one laj^er of lean, and the bones are slanting. 
This is not a desirable piece. The lower strip is the 
brisket, the upper end of which is thick ; the lower end, 



220 The Boston Cook Book. 

toward the middle of the creature, is called the navel end. 
Brisket pieces alwa3'S have what is called a selvedge on 
the lower side, and the breast bones running at right angles 
with the rib. After a little experience in marketing one 
may easily' distinguish the various cuts of beef. It is w^ell 
to know what you want, and to know whether you get 
what you have ordered. 

Roast Sirloin of Beef. 

Six or eight pounds from the tip or second cut of the sirloin. 
Wipe, trim, and tie or skewer into shape. If there be a 
large piece of the flank, cut it off, and use it for soups or 
stews. If you prefer to use it for this purpose after roast- 
ing, draw it round underneath and fasten it with a skewer. 
La}' the meat on a rack in a pan, and dredge all over with 
salt., pepper^ and flour. Put it in a very hot oven with two 
or three tablespoonfuls of drippings or pieces of the beef fat 
placed in the pan. Place a rack under the pan, or turn the 
heat off from the bottom of the oven. Put the skin side 
down at first, that the heat may harden the juices in the 
lean part. When the flour is brown on the pan and the 
meat is seared, baste with the fat and reduce the heat. 
Baste often, and dredge twice with salt and flour. When 
seared all over, turn and bring the skin side up for the 
final basting and browning. Bake fifty or sixty minutes, 
if liked very rare ; an hour and a quarter to an hour and 
a half, if liked well done. If there be any danger of 
burning the fat in the pan, add a little hot water after 
the flour is browned. Meat may be roasted and carved 
better if placed in the pan and on the platter with the 
6kin up instead of the flesh side. 

Carve a sirloin roast by cutting several thin slices parallel 
with the ribs. Then cut down near the backbone and sep- 
arate the slices. Cut out the tenderloin from under the 
bone, and slice it in the same manner. Many turn the 
eirloin over and remove the tenderloin first. Serve a little 
of the crisp fat on the flank to those who wish it. 



Roaat Beef. 22 i 



Rib Roast. — Remove the backbone and ribs. Skewer or 
tie into a round shape, and prepare as for sirloin. Allow 
a longer time for roasting, as the meat is in a more com- 
pact form without the bones. Place it skin side up on the 
platter, and carve thin slices from the flesh side. 

The Back of the Rump. — This is the best and cheapest 
piece for roasting, as the meat is all good and there is not 
as much bone as in other pieces. It is usually too large 
for a small family' ; but in cold weather it may be used to 
advantage, by cutting steaks from the thickest end, using 
the small end for a roast and the bones for soup. 

In carving the rump, when the bone has not been taken 
out, a deep cut should be made at the base, to loosen the 
meat ; then the slices ma}' be cut lengthwise or crosswise. 
When the family is large and all the meat is to be used, 
it is well to cut it lengthwise. Should onl}- a small quan- 
tity be needed, cut only from the small end, and save the 
tougher parts for a stew. Many think it more economical 
to serve the poorer parts the first da}', as they are then 
more palatable, reserving the tender meat to be served 
cold. 

Roast from the Round. — A slice three inches thick, from 
the best part of the top of the round, may be dredged with 
salt, pepper, and four, and roasted. Carve in thin slices, 
the same as steak. It is rather tough, but juicy and well 
flavored. 

Yorkshire Pudding. — Beat three eggs very light. Add 
one sca7it teaspoonful of salt and one pint of milk. Pour halj 
a cup of this mixture on two thirds of a cup of flour, and 
stir to a smooth paste. Add the remainder of the mixture 
and beat well. Bake in hot gem pans forty-five minutes. 
Baste with the drippings from the beef. This is a more 
convenient way than to bake in the pan under the beef, 
and gives more crust. Serve as a garnish for roast beef. 

Gravy for Roast Beef. — When the meat is done, put it 
on a plate, and keep it hot while making the gravy. Hold 
the corner of the dripping-pan over a bowl ; let the liquid 
in the pan settle ; then pour off all the fat and save it. 



222 The Boston Cook Book, 

When no water is used in baking and the oven is very hot, 
this liquid will be the fat from the meat. The brown flour 
will settle, and some will adhere to the pan. Pour one pint 
of hot water or stock into the pan, and scrape off all the sedi- 
ment. Pour this water into a saucepan from which it may 
be poured easih', and place it on the stove to heat. Put 
four tahlespoonfuh of the hot fat into a small ftying-pan, 
and when browned stir in two heaping tahlespoonfuh of dry 
flour ^ or enough to absorb all the fat. Stir until the flour 
is brown and well mixed ; then add the hot liquid grad- 
ually, and stir as it thickens. Season with salt and pepper^ 
and simmer five minutes. Strain if not perfectly smooth. 
Gravy can be made in the dripping-pan ; but such pans are 
usualh' large, inconvenient to handle, and take up more 
space than can be spared on the top of the stove, and are 
much harder to wash when the grav}^ has been made in 
them. To make it in the pan, pour ofi" nearl}^ all the fat. 
Put the pan on the stove and add dry flour until the fat is 
all absorbed. Then add hot water or hot stocky and stir as it 
thickens. Cook five to eight minutes, and strain. It is well 
for those who like gravies to make a large quantity, as it 
is useful in warming over the remnants of the roast. But 
there is no sauce or made grav5' equal to the natural 
juices contained in the meat, which should flow freely 
into the platter when the meat is carved.

Fillet of Beef. — Wipe, and remove the fat, veins, and 
tough tendinous portion in the middle. Trim into shape.

the meat. Bake in a hot oven twenty or thirt}' minutes. 
If you prefer, omit the pork and put the choice pieces of 
beef fat over the meat. Serve with mushroom sauce. Or 
brush the fillet with beaten egg^ and sprinkle seasoned and 
buttered crumbs all over it, and bake thirty minutes. Or 
stuff the incisions left b}' the removal of the veins and 
tendons with an}' stuffing or force-meat. Dredge with salt 
and jlour^ and bake. 

Broiled Steak. 

Wipe, trim off the superfluous fat, and remove the bone. 
Save the flank end for broiled meat cakes. Grease the 
gridiron with some of the fat. Broil over a clear fire, 
turning every ten seconds. Cook three or four minutes, if 
liked rare ; longer, if well done. Serve on a hot platter. 
Season with butter^ salt, and pejjper^ or serve with 3Iaitrp 
d' Hotel butter. Steaks should be cut at least an inch 
thick. Man}' prefer thQUi much thicker. Sirloin, cross 
cut of the rump, and top of the round are all good steaks. 
The round is juic}', but has a net work of tough white fibre, 
w'hich makes it difficult to masticate. If the steak be very 
tough, pound it with a meat hammer (a hammer with sharp 
teeth for cutting) or cut across it several times with a 
sharp knife on each side. The intense heat will sear the 
surface quickly, and prevent the escape of the juices. 

Man}' prefer not to remove the bone in a sirloin steak ; 
but it burns quickl}', and is better for the soup kettle if 
not cooked, and the steak is more easily carved when the 
bone is removed. Carve in narrow slices, giving each 
person a bit of tenderloin, fat, and upper part. 

Broiled Fillet of Beef — Cut slices from the tenderloin. 
Wipe the meat ; grease the gridiron ; broil over a clear 
fire, turning every ten counts, for three or five minutes. 
Spread with Maitre d' Hotel butter. 

Broiled Meat Cakes. — Chop leaii, ratv beef quite fine. 
Season with salt^ pepper., and a little chopped onion., or onion 
juice. Make it into small Hat cakes, and broil on a w^ell- 
greased gridiron or on a hot frying-pan. Serve very hot 




224 The Boston Cook Book. 

with huiter or Maitre d^ Hotel sauce. Th6 flank end of the 
sirloin is better when cooked in this manner than when 
broiled with the other part of the steak. 

Hamburgh Steak. — Pound a slice of round steak enough 
to break the fibre. Fr}' two or three onions, minced fine, 
in butter until slightl}' browned. Spread the onions over 
the meat, fold the ends of the meat together, and pound 
again, to keep the onions in the middle. Broil two or 
three minutes. Spread with butter, salt, and pepper. 

Braised Beef. 

Four to six pounds of beef from the lower part of the 
round or face of the rump. Trim, and rub well with salt, 
pepper, and flour. Cut two small onions into dice, and fry 
them until light brown in salt pork fiit or drippings. Skim 
them out into a braising-pan or large granite pan ; then 
brown the meat all over, adding more fat if needed. Put 
the meat into the pan on skewers, to keep it from stick- 
ing, with the onions around, not under, the meat. Add 
one quart of boiling water and one tablespoonful of mixed 
herbs, which should be tied in a small piece of strainer 
cloth. Cover closely, putting a brick on the cover to keep 
it down, and cook in a moderate oven four hours, basting 
ever}^ twent}' minutes. Turn over after two hours ; add 
more water as it evaporates, so as to have one pint left for 
grav3\ When tender, take up the meat, remove the fat 
and bag of herbs from the gravy ; add more salt and pep- 
per, and if desired add lemon juice, tomato, or mushrooms ; 
thicken with tiuo tablespoonfuls of flour, wet in a little cold 
water. Cook ten minutes, and pour the gravy over the 
meat. Garnish with potato balls, boiled onions, or with veg- 
etables a la Jardiniere. Horseradish sauce ma}" be served 
with the meat. This is a ver}' nutritious, palatable, and 
convenient wa}' of cooking the cheaper parts of beef, a 
cusQivjn of veal, tongues, fowls, liver, and some other kinds 
of meat. The meat is equally good cold or hot ; there is 
no fvaste if care be taken not to let it become hard and dry

by being exposed to the air. Tiiis method of cooking 
commends itself especiall}'' to those who " are tired of 
roasted, boiled, or fried meat.'* 

Beef a la Mode. 

Four to six pounds from the under part of the round of 
beef cut thick. Wipe, and trim off the rough edges. Put 
it in a deep earthen dish, and pour ovei it spiced vine- 
gar, made b}- boiling for five minutes one cup of vinegar, 
one onion ^ chopped fine ^ three teaspoonfuls of salt, and half a 
teaspoonful each of mustard, pepper, cloves, and cdlspice. 
Let the meat stand several hours, turning it often. Then 
daub it with ten or twelve strips of scdt pork, cut one third of 
an inch ivide, and as long as the meat is thick, inserting 
them with a larding-needle or carving-steel. Or make 
large incisions and stuff with bread crumbs, highl}' seasoned 
with salt, pepper, onions, thyme, marjoram, etc., moistened 
with hot ivater, one tablespoonful of butter, and one ivell-beaten 
ujg. Tie it into good shape with a narrow strip of cotton 
cloth, to keep in the stufiing. Dredge with flour. Cut 
two onions, half a carrot, and half a turnip fine, and fry 
them in fat or drippings until brown. Put them in the 
stewpan. Then brown the meat all over in the fat ; put 
it on a trivet in the pan, and half cover with boiling water. 
Add one tablespoonful of mixed herbs, tied in a small 
strainer cloth. Cover closel}', and simmer four hours, or 
until tender. Take it up carefull}', remove the strings, and 
put it on a large platter. Remove the fat from the grav}- , 
add more seasoning, and thicken with flour wet in a little 
cold water ; boil eight minutes, and strain it over the meat. 
Garnish with potato balls and small onions. 

Beef Stew with Dumplings. 

The aitch bone is the nicest piece for a beef stew. There 
is some ver^' juicy meat on the upper side in the large 
muscle which lies next to the top of the round, and it will 
serve a small family for a roast, and then maj' be made 

15 



226 The Boston Cook Book, 

into a stew. The flavor obtained by roasting adds much 
to the stew ; for this reason, when the meat has not been 
cooked, brown it in a little fat before stewing. The bones 
should never be chopped and splintered, but sawed care- 
fully, and all the fine, crumbly pieces removed before 
cooking. Other good pieces for stews are two or three 
pounds from the middle cut of the shin^ or the jianh end bi 
a large sirloin roast, or the upper part of the chuch rib. 
Any part that has bone and fat, as well as lean, either 
cooked or uncooked, makes the best-flavored stew. The 
fat and bones may be removed before serving, and such 
pieces are much better than drj-, lean meat. Remove the 
meat from the bones, and put them with part of the fat 
into the stewpan. Cut the meat into small pieces, and if not 
previous!}^ cooked, dredge with scdt^ pepper^ and j^q?^?', and 
brown all. over in salt pork fat or drippings. Put it into 
the stewpan. Cut two onions^ one small white turnip^ and 
half a small carrot (if you like the flavor) into half-inch 
dice. Cook them slightl}^ in the dripping, and add them 
to the stew. Add boiling water enough to cover, and sim* 
mer two or three hours, or till the meat is tender. Remove 
the bones, and skim off the fat. While the meat is cook- 
ing pare six or eight small potatoes^ and soak them in cold 
water. When the meat is tender, pour boiUng water over 
them, and boil five minutes to take out the acrid taste. 
Drain, and add them to the stew. Add salt and pepper to 
taste. When dumplings are to be served with the stew, 
add them when the potatoes are nearl}' done. The liquor 
should come up just even with the potatoes, that the dump- 
plings may rest on them. Cover closeh^ to keep in the 
steam, and cook ten minutes without lifting the cover. 
Take out the dumplings, put the meat and potatoes in 
the centre of a hot platter, and the dumplings round the 
edge. 

Remove the fat, and add more sau and pepper^ if needed, 
to the broth ; and if not thick enough, add a little flout 
wet smooth in cold water ^ and boil five minutes. Add one 
cup of strained tomato and one teaspoonful of chopped parsley 



Pot Roast. 227 



Pour the gravy over the meat, putting part of it in a 
sauce tureen if there be more than the platter will hold. 

Dumplings. — One pint of Jlour, half a teaspoonful of 
salt, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, and half a tea- 
spoonful of soda (or three level teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder). Mix with one scant cup of sweet milk into a 
dough soft enough to handle easily. Pat it out half an 
inch thick. Cut in small rounds, or mix softer and drop- 
by the spoonful into the boiling stew. Cook ten minute^. 

Rolled Flank of Beef. 

Four or Jive pounds of the flank. Wipe, and remove the 
skin, membrane, and extra fat. Pound and trim until of 
uniform thickness. Make a stuffing with 07ie cup of cy^acker 
crumbs, two tahlespoonfuls of fine chopped salt pork, half a 
teaspoonfid of salt, one saltspoonful each of thyme, marjoram, 
and sage, half a saltspoonful of pepper, a few drops of onion 
juice, or one teaspoonful of chojyped o7iion, and one egg. 
Moisten with hot water until soft enough to spread over the 
meat. Roll over, and tie or sew securel}'. Wrap a cloth 
around it. Put it into boiling water, and simmer six 
hours or until tender. Remove the cloth, press it, and 
when cold remove the strings. Serve cold, cut in thin 
slices. Corned flank ma}' be prepared in the same way. 
The stuffing ma}^ be omitted, and the meat covered with 
vinegar spiced and flavored with onion, and after remain- 
ing in the pickle several hours, rolled, and boiled as above. 

Smothered Beef, or Pot Roast. 

Four to six pounds from the middle ov face of the rump^ 
the vein, or the round. Wipe with a clean wet cloth. 
Sear all over by placing in a hot ftying-pan and turning 
till all the surface is browned. Put in a kettle with one 
cup of water, and place it where it will keep just below the 
boiling-point. Do not let the water boil cntireh' away, 
but add only enough to keep the meat from burning 



>N 



228 The Boston Cook Book, 

Have the cover fitting closely to keep in the steam. Cook 
until very tender, but do not let it break. Serve hot or 
cold. The meat when cold is delicious, cut in quarter- 
inch slices, and sauted in hot butter. 

Spiced Beef. 

^our to six pounds from the middle cut of the shin. Wash 
the meat on the outside, and cut off any part of the skin 
which is not sweet and clean. Pick off all the fine frag- 
ments of bone. Cut the meat into several pieces ; cover 
with boiling water. Skim carefully as it boils, and then 
simmer until the meat falls to pieces, and the liquor is 
reduced to half a pint. Remove the meat ; season tlie 
hquor highly with salt^ pepper^ sage, and thyme. Add it 
to the meat, and mix with a fork till the meat is all 
broken. Pack in a brickloaf pan. When cold, cut in 
thin slices. 

Corned Beef. 

Select a piece of beef which has a fair proportion of fat, — ■ 
the brisket or second cut of rattle rand. If very salt, soak 
in cold water half an hour. Put on to boil in fresh cold 
water, enough to cover it. If not very salt, wash it and 
use boiling water, but never let it boil fast. Skim care- 
fully when it begins to boil, and cook slowly, simmering 
(not boiling) until so tender that you can pick it to 
pieces with a fork. Let the water boil away toward the 
last, and let the beef stand in the water until partially 
cooled. Lift it out of the ^ water with a skimmer, and 
pack it in a brickloaf pan; let the long fibres run the 
length of the pan ; mix in the fat so that it will be well 
marbled. Put a thin board, a trifle smaller than the in- 
side of the pan, over the meat, and press by putting a 
heavy weight on the board. When cold, cut in thin slices. 
This is the most appetizing way of serving the fat of the 
meat, which in corned beef is a desirable part and is often 
untouched if offered in a mass on the edge of the lean. 



Boiled Dinner, 220 



An Old-fashioned Boiled Dinner. {Mrs. Poor.} 

Notwithstanding that this dish has fallen into ill-repute 
with man}' people, it may be prepared so as to be both pal- 
atable and nutritious for those who exercise freely. It is 
more suitable for cold seasons. The most healthful and 
economical wa}', though perhaps not the old-fashioned wa^', 
is to boil the beef the day before. 

Four pounds of corned beef, tivo or three beets., a snicdl cab- 
hage, two small carrots., one small white French turnip., six or 
iight potatoes of uniform size., and one small crooked-neck 
squash. 

Wash and soak the corned beef in cold water, and put it 
on to boil in fresh cold water ; skim, and simmer until ten- 
der, but not long enough for it to fall to pieces. Let it 
cool in the liquor in which it was boiled. Put it into a 
flat shallow dish, cover it with a board, and press it. 
Remove all the fat from the meat liquor, and save it to 
clarif}' for shortening. Save the meat liquor, but do not 
let it stand in an iron kettle or tin pan. Boil the beets 
the day before, also, and cover them with vinegar. The 
next day prepare the vegetables. Wash them all, scrape 
the carrots, and cut the cabbage into quarters ; pare the 
turnip and squash, and cut iuto three-quarter-inch slices, 
and pare the potatoes. Put the meat liquor on to boil 
about two hours before dinner time ; when boiling, put in 
the carrots, afterward the cabbage and turnip, and half an 
hour before dinner add the squash and potatoes. When 
tender, take the vegetables up carefully ; drain the water 
from the cabbage by pressing it in a colander. Slice the 
carrots. Put the cold meat in the centre of a large dish, 
and serve the carrots, turnips, and potatoes round the edge, 
with the squash, cabbage, and pickled beets in separate 
dishes ; or serve each vegetable in a dish by itself. This 
may all be done the same da}' if the meat be put on to 
boil very early, removed as soon as tender, the fat taken 
off, and the vegetables added to the boiling meat liquor, 
beginning with those which require the longest time to 



230 The Boston Cook Book. 

cook. This will depeucl very much upon their freshness. 
But whichever way the dish is prepared, boil the beets 
alone, remove the meat and fat before adding the vege- 
tables, and serve each as whole and daintily as possible. 
The next morning use what remains of the vegetables as a 
vegetable hash. 

Vegetable Hash. — Equal parts of cabbage^ beets, and tur- 
nips, and as much potato as there is of all the other vege- 
tables. Chop all ver}' fine ; add a little salt and pepper ,- 
put a spoonful of drippings in the frjing-pan, and when 
hot add the hash, and cook slowl}^ until warmed through. 

Tongue in Jelly. 

Wash a fresh tongue, and skewer the tip to the root. 
Cook until tender in boihng salted water ; remove the skin ; 
tiim and tie it in good shape. Season two quarts of soup 
stock highl}' with salt, pepper, herbs, and wine or lemon. 
Clear it with eggs, and stiffen with the proportion of Cox's 
gelatine, as given for Aspic Jelly. Pour a little jelly into 
a mould ; when cool, lay in the cold tongue, and add the 
remainder of the jelly slowl^'. 

SmoJced Tongue. — Smoked tongues are much more pala- 
table, though not so economical as when fresh. Bend the 
tip of the tongue around, and tie It to the root. Put it in 
cold water and place over the fire. When the water boils, 
pour off the water, and put it on again in cold water. 
Boil until tender, or about two hours. Remove the skin, 
roots, and fat. Pour a white sauce over the tongue, and 
serve it hot; or serve it cold with a salad dressing. 
Tongues may also be braised (see Braised Beef, page 224) 
and served hot or cold. 

Lyonnaise Tripe. 

Tripe should always be boiled twenty to thirty minutes 
before cooking, or it will be tough. 

Cut the tripe in small pieces ; boil twenty-five minutes, 
and drain. Fry one tablespoonful of chopped onion in one 



Liver. 231 

heaping tahlespoonful of butter till 3'ellow. Add the tripe, 
one tahlespoonful of vinegar^ and one tahlespoonful of chopped 
parsley^ salt and pepper to taste. Simmer five minutes, 
and serve plain or on toast. 

Broiled Tripe. — Boil the tripe twenty minutes; dry it, 
spread with soft butter, salt, and pepper, and broil until 
brown. 

Tripe in Batter. — Boil the tripe twenty minutes. Cut 
in pieces two inches square, dip in batter, and fiy in salt 
pork fat in a ftying-pan. 

Batter. — One egg, one quarter of a cup of water, one 
tahlespoonful of vinegar, one teaspoonful of salt, and flour to 
make almost a drop batter. 

Liver. 

Soak ten minutes in boiling water to draw out the 
blood. Drain ; remove the thin skin and veins. Cut 
into pieces for serving. Season with salt and pepper; 
roll iw flour, and fty in salt pork or bacon fat. Drain, and 
serve with a brown gravy, seasoned with onion, lemon 
juice, or vinegar. Or spread with butter, and broil^,;^i^d 
season with salt, pepper, and butter. 

Kidneys. 

Beef and sheep's kidneys are often recommended for 
food on account of their cheapness. Epicures are fond 
of them. The taste for tliem is an acquired taste, which 
it is not desirable to cultivate. The latest decision of 
ph3^sicians is that they are not suitable to eat ; as "from 
their constant use in the animal system as excretory or- 
gans, — organs which separate from the blood that w^hich, 
if it remained in the blood, would poison the system, — 
they are often liable to become diseased." 




232 The Boston Cook Booh. 



MUTTON AND LAMB. 

Mutton stands next to beef in nutritive qualities, and 
with many has even more vaUie as food, because more 
easily digested. In mutton about one half the weight is 
in fat, while with beef it is onl}' one thh'd. 

The choicest mutton comes from the mountainous re- 
gions of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina. 
Good mutton should be large and heavy, the fat clear 
white and very hard, the flesh fine-grained and bright 
red. Poor mutton has but' little fat, and little flesh as 
compared with the bone. 

Mutton is cut at the market by splitting down the back, 
and dividing at the loin into the hind and fore quarters ; 
or the hind and fore quarters are separated without split- 
ting, and the loin is taken out whole and sold as the sad- 
dle of mutton. The leg, loin, and saddle are best for 
roasting, and are better if kept for some time before cook- 
ing. The leg, if to be boiled, should be fresh. The fore 
quarter is good boned and stuff'ed ; then steamed, and 
browned in the oven. The neck and bones are used for 
broths and stews. Chops are cut from the ribs and from 
the loin. The rib chops are sometimes cut long, with the 
flank on. The bone is removed and the meat rolled. 
These roll chops are not economical, as the flank forms the 
greater part. French chops are cut short from the rib, 
and the flesh is scraped clean from the end of the bone. 
The best-flavored, most tender, and cheapest in the end, 
are the chops from the loin. The^' have \Qvy little bone, 
and a piece of tenderloin. 

Mutton has a strong flavor, disagreeable to man3\ It 
is said to be caused by the oil from the wool, which pen- 
etrates the skin. The pink skin above the fat should 
alwa^^s be removed from chops, and wherever it is pos* 



Leg of Mutton. 233 



sible, scrape it off without cutting into the lean. The 
caul, or lining membrane of the abdomen, is fastened 
round the meat, particularly on the leg, partly to increase 
its weight. This is often left on in roasting to help baste 
the meat ; but it gives a strong flavor, and should always 
be removed, and the kidne^^ fat used if needed. If care 
be taken in selecting only the best mutton, and in cook- 
ing it in the best manner, man}^ who have become preju- 
diced against it could eat it with as much relish as beef. 
Mutton may be cooked rare, but lamb should always be 
well cooked. Tiie end of the bone in a leg of mutton ig 
smooth and oval, and is separated at the joint ; while 
lamb may be known from mutton by the flat, irregularly 
grooved end of the bone, which is broken off squarel^^, 
instead of separated at the joint. Sometimes the bone 
is cut off close to tlie second joint, and then you will have 
to depend upon the word of your butcher. 

Saddle or Loin of Mutton or Lamb. 

Trim off all the pink skin and superfluous fat. Remove 
the ends of the ribs, the cord, and veins along the back. 
Wipe, and rub the inside with salt. Roll the flank under 
on each side, and sew it across the middle. Dredge with 
salt^ pepper^ and Jlour ; place it in the pan, with the inside 
up, in order to thoroughly cook the fat. Baste, and 
dredge often. When the fat is brown and crisp, turn, 
and cook the upper part till brown. Keep a buttered 
paper over it to prevent burning. 

Carve long slices parallel with the backbone, then slip 
the knife under and separate the slices from the ribs. 
Divide the slices, and serve with some of the crisp fat. 

A loin of mutton may be staffed and rolled, having first 
removed the ends of the ribs. Bake, and serve in slices 
cut at right angles with the backbone. 

Leg of Mutton, Stuffed and Roasted. 

Remove the bone ; wipe inside and out with a wet cloth ; 
sprinkle the inside with salt ; stuff and sew. Put it on a 



234 The Boston Cook Book. 

rack in a dripping-pan, with some of tlie kidney suet on 
the meat and in the pan. Dredge with salt, pepper, and 
flow, and bake in a hot oven. Baste as soon as the floui 
is brown, and baste often. Bake one hour, if liked rare ; 
one hour and a quarter, if well done. 

Stuffing. — One cup of cracker or stale bread crumbs. 
Season with oiie saltspoonful each of salt, pepper, thyme, or 
marjoram, and moisten with a quarter of a cup of melted 
butter. Add hot water if a moist stuffing be desired. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton or Lamb. — Wipe, remove the fat, 
and put into well-salted boiling water. Skim, and simmer 
twelve minutes for each pound of meat. One quarter of a 
cup of rice is sometimes boiled with the mutton, or the 
meat may be tied in a cloth to keep it from becomiug 
discolored. Serve with a thick caper sauce poured over the 
mutton. Garnish with parsley. Serve with currant jelly. 

Carve slices from the thickest part of the leg down to 
the bone ; then slip the knife under and remove the slices 
from the bone. The thickest part of the leg should be 
toward the back of the platter. 

What to do with a Fore Quarter of Mutton. 

Mutton Buck. — Select a fore quarter of mutton with 
the whole length of the leg bone left on. Ask the butcher 
to cut off what is called a raised shoulder, that is, raised 
from the backbone aud ribs, cutting it far up on the 
shoulder to take in the whole of the shoulder blade, bone, 
and gristle. You may cut it 3'ourself by removing the 
neck, the back bones, the ribs, and breast bones, leaving 
i,he shoulder blade in the upper part. Then scrape the 
flesh from the shoulder blade, and separate the blade at 
the joint. Lay it aside for further use. Remove the meat 
from the leg bone, turning the meat over, as 3'ou would 
turn a glove over 3'our hand. Be careful not to cut 
through the thin skin at the end of the leg. When within 
three inches of the lower joint, saw the bone off, and saw 
or trim the bone below the joint into the shape of a duck's 
bill. Bend the joint without breaking the skin. Wipe the 



Mutton Duck. 235 



iiieat and rub inside with salt. Make a moist stuffing and 
put it ill between the layers of meat. With a coarse needle 
threaded with twine gather the edges of the meat, draw 
them together, fill the caAity with stuffing, and shape the 
meat into a long oval form like the body of a duck. Bend 
the leg at the lower joint to represent the duck's head and 
neck, and keep it in place with skewers, liun one skewer 




Fig. 26. Mutton Duck. 

through the side at the top of the body, and put one into the 
body on each side of the neck. Wind a string around the 
bill, and fasten it to the skewers. Scrape the shoulder blade 
clean, trim the bony end into a sharp point, and notch the 
gristle at the opposite end. Insert this in the body to 
represent the tail, and fasten with twine. Put the bones 
and scraps of meat in water in a steamer or kettle. Place 
the duck on a plate, and steam it over the bones one hour 
to make it tender. Dredge with salt., pepper.^ and flour., 
and bake one hour, or till brown ; use the water in the 
kettle for basting if needed, or for a grav}'. Tie paper 
over the head and tail to prevent burning. This maj^ be 
made of lamb, and if tender will require no steaming. 
Garnish with parsley and Scotch eggs., or with an}' kind of 
force-meat balls, crumbed and fried, or with egg-shaped 
potato croquettes. 

This Mock Duck is an attractive way of serving what is 
usuall}' considered an inferior piece of meat, and solves the 
vexing problem, " how to carve a fore quarter of mutton." 



236 The Boston Cook Book, 

The bones may be entirelj^ removed, and the meat 
stuffed, and sewed in an oval shape, then steamed and 
browned ; this will prove just as palatable to those who do 
not crave something new. In serving, cut it across in 
medium slices. 

Braised Mutton. — Bone and stuff the leg or the fore 
quarter, as directed in the preceding receipts ; cut the bone 
at the joints. Add 03'sters to the stuffiug if preferred, 
and cook the same as braised beef. The breast of mut- 
ton may be boned and rolled without stuffing and then 
braised. 

Lamb or Mutton Chops. — Wipe with a wet cloth; re- 
move the skin and extra fat ; have a frying-pan hissing 
hot, without an}^ fat ; put in the chops and cook one 
minute, turn, and sear the other side ; cook more slowl}' 
until done, five minutes if liked rare. Stand them up 
on the fat edge to brown the fat, without over-cooking 
the meat. When nearly done, sprinkle a little salt on each 
side. Drain on paper, and serve hot, either plain or with 
tomato or Souhise sauce. 

Mutton Cutlets, Breaded. — Trim the cutlets, and season 
with salt and pepper. Dip in crumbs, beaten egg, and crumbs 
again, and fry in smoking hot fat, four to six 
minutes if rare, eight to ten if well done. Ar- 
range in the centre of a hot dish, and pour tomato 
sauce around them, or place them around a mound 
of mashed potatoes or spinach. Trim the bones 
with a paper ruffle; or arrange them with the 
bone end up, stacked like baj'onets, and gar- 
nish with stuffed tomatoes. 

Chops en Papillote. — Wipe, trim, wmp in but- 
tered papers, and broil from three to five min- 
utes ; season, and serve plain or trimmed with paper 
ruffles. Or make a thick sauce with one cup of boiling 
stock, thickened with one heaping tablespoonful of flour and 
one tablespoonful of butter, cooked together and flavored 
with mushrooms, parsley, and lemon juice. La}' the cutlets 
on clean papers, spread the sauce over them, fold the

edges, place in a pan in the oven for ten minutes. Serve 
in the papers. If the chops be tough, dip them in olive oil 
before broiling. 

Fricassee of Glut- 
ton or Lamb with 
Peas. — Cut two 
pounds of the breast 
of mutton or lamb 
into square pieces. 
Dredge with salt 
and Jlour^ and 
brown in b2itter 
or drippings. Put 
them in a stew- 
pan with one onion 
sliced, cover with 
boiling water ^ and 
simmer until the 
bones slip out. Remove the bones, strain the liquor, skim 
off the fat, and when the liquor boils again, add the meat, 
salt., and pepper, and stew until 
nearh' tender ; then add 072e quart 
of peas., or one pint of boiled mac- 
aroni cut into half -inch pieces, or 
one pint of asparagus tips., and sim- 
mer fifteen minutes. 

Mutton Steiafor Two. — Two mut- 
ton chops., cut from near the shoul- 
der. Put them in a shallow pan 
having a tight cover. Pour on 
boiling water to the depth of one 
inch ; cover and simmer one hour ; 
add more water as it boils awa}', 
using onh' enough to keep the 
meat from burning. Add two 
slices of French turnip., two small 
onions whole ; and when the meat and turnip are nearh' 
tender, add two common-sized potatoes, having first soaked 




Fio. 29. Chop in Paper.

and scalded them. Add one teaspoonful of salt and a little 
pepper. Remove the vegetables without breaking ; let the 
water boil nearl}' awaj', leaving enough for a grav}'. Re- 
move the fat, thicken the grav}' with Jiour^ and if needed 
add salt and tomato catchup. Pour it over the meat. 

Curry of Mutton. — Fry 07ie large onion., cut fine, in one 
heading fablespoonful of butter. Mix one tahlespoonful of 
curry powder^ one teasjjoonful of salt^ one tahlespoonful of 
flour., and stir it into the butter and onion. Add gradu- 
ally one 'pint of liot water or stocl^. Cut two pounds of lean 
mutton into small pieces, and brown them in hot fat ; add 
them to the sauce, and simmer until tender. Place the 
meat on a hot dish, and arrange a border of boiled rice 
or Turkish jt?z7«/ around the meat. Slices of cold cooked 
mutton may be used instead of the fresh meat. Veal 
curr}' is prepared in the same manner. 

Ragout of Mutton., made from the fore quarter, or any 
cooked mutton, may be prepared as directed for beef 
stew, adding carrots and turnips cut small, and seasoning 
highly. 

Sheep's Tongues, Braised. 

Wash, dredge with salt and flour, and brown in salt pork 
fat, with one or two minced onions. Put them in a pan 
with water or stock to half cover ; add one sprig of parsley., 
a little salt und pepper ; cover and cook two hours, or until 
tender. Remove the skin, and trim neatly at the roots. 
Place a mound of spinach in the centre of the dish ; ar- 
range the tongues around the spinach, alternating with 
diamonds of fried bread. 

Lambs' Tongues, Boiled. — Boil six tongues in salted 
water, with the juice of half a lemon, until tender. Serve 
cold with Tartar sauce. Or pickle them by covering with 
hot spiced vinegar. 



Veal, 239 




VEAL. 



Veal is always in the market, but is better in the 
spring. The fat should be white and clear ; and the lean, 
pink or flesh color. If the flesli be white, the calf has 
been bled before being killed, and the meat is unfit to eat. 
Veal contains less nitrogen, but more gelatine, than beef. 
It has very little flavor, and needs to be highly- seasoned 
to make it even palatable. Veal stands lowest among 
heat-producing meats, and should be eaten with potatoes 
or rice, which stand highest, or with bacon and jell}', which 
furnish in their fat and sugar the carbon w^anting in the 
flesh. It should always be thoroughlj' cooked, as under* 
done veal is not wholesome. At its lowest price veal is 
never a cheap food when we take into consideration the 
small amount of nutriment it contains, the large amount of 
fuel required to cook it, and the danger of being made ill 
by its use. 

The lower part of the leg or knuckle and all tlie gristly 
portions are used for soups. Cutlets, or steaks, the fillet, 
fricandeau, or cushion, are cut from the thickest part of 
the leg. The loin is used for chops or roasts, the breast 
for roasts, and the neck for stews and soups. Calfs head 
and pluck includes the lights, heart, and liver. The head 
Is used for soup, the heart and liver for braising. The 
lights are now seldom used. 

Roast Veal. 

The loin, breast, and fillet (a thick piece from the upper 
part of the leg) are the b(»st pieces for roasting. Tlie 
bone should be removed from tlie fillet, and the cavity 
iilled with a highly seasoned and very moist stuffing. Tie 
or skewer into a round shape. Dredge with saU^ peppet^ 



240 The Boston Cook Book, 

and flour. Put strips of pork over the top, and bake. 
Allow half an hour to a pound. Co^•er with a buttered 
paper to keep the meat from burning. Add water, when 
the flour has browned, and baste often. Serve with horse- 
radish or tomato sauce. 

Fricandeau of Veal. — This is made of a thick piece of 
lean meat from the top of the leg. Trim it off high in the 
centre and thin on the edges, and lard the top. Braise it 
in stock highlj' seasoned with bacon^ onions^ and herbs (see 
Braised Beef) . Serve it with tomato or horseradish sauce. 

Veal Stew or Fricassee. 

The ends of the ribs^ the neck^ and the knuckle may be 
utilized in a stew. Cut the meat — two pounds — in small 
pieces, and remove all the fine bones. Cover the meat 
with boiling water ; skim as it begins to boil ; add two small 
onions., two teaspoonfuls of salt., and one saltspoonful of pej)- 
per. Simmer until thoroughl}' tender. Cut four potatoes 
in halves ; soak in cold water, and parboil them five min- 
utes ; add them to the stew. Add one tablespoonfid of 
flour wet in cold water, and more seasoning if desired ; 
and just before serving add one cup o^ cream., or if milk be 
used add one tablespoonfid of butter. Remove the bones 
before serving. To make Veal Pot-Pie add dumplings^ as 
in Beef Stew. If intended for a fricassee^ fry the veal in 
salt pork fat before stewing, and omit the potatoes. Add 
one egg to the liquor just before serving, if you wish it 
richer. 

Veal Cutlets. {Joanna Sweemj.) 

One slice of veal from the leg. Wipe, and remove the 
bone, skin, and tough membranes. Pound and cut. or shape 
into pieces for serving. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
Roll in fine crumbs., then dip in beaten egg., then in crumbs 
again. Fry several slices of salt pork., and fry the cutlets 
brown in the pork fat. When brown, put the cutlets in a 
stewpan. Make a brown gravy with one taUespoonful of 
butter^ or the fat remaining in the pan if it be not

'turned, and two heapinrf tablespoon fids of flour. Pour 
)ii gradually a cup and a half of slock or water. Season 
ivith Worcestershire sauce or lemon or horseradish or tomato. 
Pour the gravy over the cutlets, and simmer forty-five min- 
utes or till tender. Take them out on a platter, remove 
the fat from the gravy, add more seasoning if needed, and 
strain over the cutlets. Garnish with lemon uml parsley. 



Calfs Liver, Braised. 

Wipe with a clean wet cloth. Lard the rounded side 
with bacon or s(dt pork. Fry one onion in salt pork fat. 
Put the liver and Iried onion in a braising-pan ; add hot 
water or slock to half cover, one leaspoonfid of salt., one salt- 
spoonful of pepper., and one tablespoon/id of herbs. Cover, 
and cook in a moderate oven two hours, basting often. 
When read}' to serve, strain the liquor, season with lemon 
juice, and pour it over the liver. 

Calf^s Heart, Braised. — Wash, remove the veins and 
arteries, and stuft' with cracker crumbs., seasoned with onion 
niice^ salt, pepper, and herbs, and moistened with butter. 




Fio. 30. Calfs Heart. 

Lard with bacon or salt pork. Dredge with salt and flour. 
Fry one onion in salt pork fat or dripping ; brown the meat 
in the pork fat. Cook it as liver is cooked, by the preced- 
ing receipt. 

Calf's Head. 

Scrape and clean a calfs head. Take out the brains and 
tongue, and put them in cold water. Remove all the dark 
membrane from the inside, and the gristle around the nose 

16 



242 The Boston Cook Book, 

and e^'es. Soak two hours in lukewarm water to whiten 
it. Put the head, tongue, and heart on to boil in cold 
water, and skim earefull3\ Add one tablespoonfal of herbs 
tied in a piece of strainer cloth, one tablespoonful of salt^ 
and one saltspoonful o^ pepper. Pour boiling water over the 
hver, let it stand ten minutes, and when the head is nearly 
done, add the liver. When done, take up the head ; re- 
move the skin in as nice pieces as possible. Put the 
pieces of head meat on the platter ; la}' the skin over them. 
Cut the heart, tongue, and liver in slices, and place them 
round the edge of the dish. If the head is to be served 
with the bones, tie it in a floured cloth, and boil it until 
tender, but not long enough for the skin to fall off. Serve 
it plain ; or score the top, brush with beaten egg, sprinkle 
buttered cracker crumbs over it, and brown in the oven. 
Serve with it a brown sauce piquante^ -toTiiato sauce, or 
brain sauce. 

Brain Sauce. — Clean the brains, remove the red mem- 
brane, and soak in cold water. Put them into one pint of 
cold water with one tablespoonful of lemon juice and half a 
teaspoonful of salt. Boil ten minutes ; then plunge into 
cold water. INIake one pint of drawn butter sauce; flavor 
with lemon and parsley ; add the brains chopped fine, and 
when hot serve. 

Calf's Head, Minced. — Chop what is left of the head, 
tongue, and liver verj' fine, and warm it in a sauce made 
with the meat liquor ; season with lemon or horseradish, salt, 
and pepper. 

Sweetbreads. 

The sweetbreads found in veal are considered the best. 
They are two large glands lying along the back of the 
throat and in the breast. The lower oiie is round and 
compact, and called the heart sweetbread, because nearer 
the heart. The upper, or throat, sweetbread is long and 
narrow, and easily divided into sections. The connecting 
membrane is sometimes broken, and each gland sold as a 
whole sweetbread. But there should always be two. Sweet- 



Sweetbreads. 



243 



breads were formerly thrown away as worthless ; but the 
demand for them has increased so that now they are a lux- 
ury. They have a delicate flavor, and as they spoil 
quickly, should be put into cold water as soon as pur- 
cliased, and parboiled before using in any form, to insure 
their being thoroughly cooked. They are sometimes left 
on the breast of veal, and may then be roasted with the 
meat. 

To Prepare Sweetbreads. — Put them in cold water; re- 
move the pipes and membranes. Cook them in boiling 
salted water, with one tablespoonful of. lemon juice, twenty 
minutes, and plunge into cold water to harden. They may 
then be cooked in either of the following ways : — 

Larded. — Lard, and bake until brown, basting with 
brown stock. Serve with peas. 

Fried. — Roll in fine bread crumbs^ egg^ and a second 
time in crumbs, and fry in deep fat, or saute in a little fat. 

No. 2. — Cut in 
half-inch slices, roll 
in seasoned crumbs, 
egg, and crumbs again. 
Put three slices on a 
small skewer, alter- 
nating with three thin 
slices of bacon one 
inch square. Fry in 
deep fat. Serve on the skewers, with tomato sauce. 

Creamed. — Cut in small pieces, and serve in a white 
muce, on toast or in toast patties or in puff-paste shells or 
as a vol-au-vent. 

Broiled. — Rub with butter, salt, and pepper ; wrap in 
buttered paper, and broil ten minutes. Serve with Maitre 
d' Hotel butter. 

Scalloped or in Cases. — Cut or break the sweetbreads 
into small sections. Mix with a rich cream sauce made 
with eggs (see page 190). Put them in a scallop dish, in 
shells, or in paper cases. Cover with buttered crumbs, and 
bake until the crumbs are brown. 




Fig. 31. Sweetbreads and Bacon. 



244 ^^^^ Boston Cook Book, 

With Mushrooms. — Prepare as for creamed or scalloped^ 
and add half or an equal amount of mushrooms^ chopped 
or cut into quarters. Garnish with toast points. 

Braised, — Lard with hacon. Put in a covered pan 
with fried onions^ and parsley^ and a pinch of herhs^ tied 
in a cloth. Half cover with stock. Bake forty or fifty 
minutes. 

Fritters. — Break into sections, and mix with a fritter 
batter (page 106). Fry by small spoonfuls in deep fat. 

Sweetbread Croquettes^ see Index. 

To serve sweetbreads, either larded, broiled, or fried, 
arrange around a centre of tomato sauce, mushrooms, or 




Fig. 32. Sweetbreads on Macaroni 

peas. Or put the sweetbreads in the centre on a nest 
of boiled macaroni. Sprinkle the macaroni with cheese, 
and pour white sauce or tomato sauce over it ; or garnish 
tile sweetbreads with stuffed tomatoes. 

Garnish for Fried or Larded Sweethreads. — Cut int,o 
strips the size of matches, part of the breast of a roasted 
or boiled chicken, some cold boiled ham and cooked 
spaghetti, about a cup of each. Keep them hot in a 
steamer until the sauce is ready. Stew hcdf a can of 
tomato until soft. Rub all but the seeds through a 
puree strainer. Heat again and boil dovrn till quite thick 
and reduced to one cup. Season with one tahlespoonful 
of butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, a hit of cayenne, and 
07ie tahlespoonful oi lemon juice. Add one tahlespoonful 
of glaze if you have it. When the sweetbreads are ready, 
arrange the mixture of ham, spaghetti, and chicken on a 
hot platter ; pour the tomato over it and lay the sweet- 
breads on the top. 



Pork. 245 




PORK. 



' Pork is an unwholesome meat, and should never be 
eaten by children, or people with weak digestion, nor, 
indeed, b}- any one except in cold weather. Salt pork, 
bacon, and ham are less objectionable than fresh pork. 
If fresh pork be desired, obtain it, if possible, from a 
source where 3'ou can be sure the animal has been kept 
in a cleanly manner and fattened on corn. Fresh pork 
should be young and firm, the fat white, the lean a i)ale 
red, and the skin white and clear. The fat, when salted, 
should be a delicate pink, and the rind should be thin 
Soft, flabby flesh, and yellowish fat with kernels, indicate 
that the pork is not of the best qualit}^ Unlike other 
meat, pork is divided into fat and lean. The flank and 
the thick la3'er of fat above the flesh are salted. The 
sides of very young pigs are smoked, as well as sailed, and 
are called bacon. The hams and shoulders are salted 
and smoked. The head and feet are pickled or boiled , 
and made into souse or head cheese. After the fat is 
removed, the loin and ribs are used for roasting or for 
chops. The leaf fat from the kidneys is heated until 
melted, then strained, cooled, and used as lard. The 
trimmings of lean and fat, when chopped and highly 
seasoned, are called sausage meat. 

Roast Pig. 

Select a pig from three to five weeks old. Clean well, 
and stuff" with hot mashed potatoes^ or stale hread^ highl3' 
seasoned with sage^ salt, pepper, and onions. If bread be 
used, moisten with warm water, melted butter, and o?ie beaten 
tgg, Stuflf and sew. Skewer the fore legs forward, and 



246 The Boston Cook Book. 

the hind legs backward. Rub all over with butter, salt, 
pepper, and flour. Put it into a pan with a little water ; 
the oven should not be ver^^ hot at first, as it should be 
thoroughl}' warmed through before browning. Baste very 
often, and at first use melted butter to make the skin tender 
and soft. Be careful not to let it burn. Bake two and a 
half or three hours. Arrange in a bed of parsley and 
celery leaves, with a " tuft of cauliflower in the mouth and a 
garland of parsley round the neck." Serve with apple sauce 
or pickles. In carving, cut off the head, then the hams 
and shoulders ; split down the back, and separate the 
ribs. 

Roast Pork. — The chine, or loin, and the spare ribs are 
the best pieces for roasting. Rub well with pepper, or mge, 
salt, and Jlmir, and bake twent}' minutes for each pound. 
Baste often, and do not have the oven as liot as for 
other meat. Roast pork is more wholesome when eaten 
cold. 

Pork Chops or Steaks. — If pork chops are to be broiled, 
the3' should be cut verj' thin, salted, and peppered, wrapped 
in greased paper, and broiled until thoroughh^ cooked, - — 
from ten to fifteen minutes. To fty or saute them, cook 
them in a hot frying-pan in a little hot lard or salt pork fat. 
Cook slowlv after they are brown, and be careful not to 
burn them. If a gravy be desired, pour off nearly all the 
fat left in the frying-pan, add two tablespoonfuls of flour, 
and when brown add hot water until of the desired consist- 
ency'. Season with salt, pepper, vinegar, and chopped 
pickles. 

Breakfast Bacon. — Cut off the rind and smoked part; 
slice very thin ; cook in a fiying-pan till the fat is tried 
out and the bacon is drj' and crisp, or fty in deep fat. 
Drain on paper, and serve alone or as a gaiTiish for 
beefsteak. 

Fried Salt Pork. — Cut fat salt pork in thin slices : pour 
hot water over them ; drain, and fry in a pan until crisp ; 
or roll in er/g and cnunhs. and fiy in deep hot fat. Servf* 
with salt ftsh 01 fried mush or baked potatoes. 



Ham. 247 



Boiled Ham. 



Sf very Bait, let it soak over night. Scrub well ; trim oflf 
the hard black part, cover with cold water, and let it 
simmer slowly, allowing half an hour to the pound. Take 
it from the fire ; let it remain in the water until nearl}' 
cold ; then peel off the skin and sprinkle sugar and grated 
breads or cracker crumbs^ over the top, and brown in the 
oven. Or boil until nearly tender ; remove the skin and 
bake two hours ; baste often with vinegar. Cover with 
crumbs, return to the oven, and brown. Or omit the 
crumbs and cover with a paste made with one teaspoonful 
of brown flour and half a cup of brown sugar ^ moistened 
with a little port wine. Spread this over the ham, and 
brown in the oven. Serve with a brown sauce flavored 
viiih half a glass of champagne. Trim the knuckle with a 
paper ruffle. In carving, cut in very thin slices. Old 
liams are improved b}' adding a pint of vinegar and a table- 
spoonful of herbs to the water in which they are boiled, 
^f the ham is not to be served whole, boil till it is very 
tender ; let it cool, and remove the skin and bones, and 
press it, with the fat well mixed with the lean. A boiled 
ham is done when the skin will peel easily. 

To serve Cold Boiled Ham. — Cut in thin slices ; season 
higlily with cayenne iiepper., or with mustard and lemon 
juice., and broil two minutes. 

Melt half a glass of currant jelly ; add a teaspoonfid of 
butter., a little pepper., and when hot add several small 
thin slices of ham. Let it boil up and serve at once. 

Fried Ham. — Cut the ham in thin slices, remove the 
outside, gash the fat, and cook in a frying-pan till the 
fat is crisp. If cooked too long, it will become hard and 
dry. Ham will fry quicker and be less dry if cooked in 
hot lard or some of the ham fat from a previous frying. 

Broiled Ham. — Cut in very thin slices, and broil three 
or four minutes. Old or very salt ham should be parboiled 
five minutes be fore being broiled. Serve with ^oacAede^^s. 



248 The Boston Cook Book, 



If you like to know what you are eating, have 3'our 
sausage meat prepared at home or b}' some one whom you 
can trust. Of sweet /resA /jor.i- take one third fat s^nd f wo 
thirds lean, and chop fine, or have it ground b\' your 
butcher. Season highly with salt, pepper, and sage 
(use the whole sage ; dr^', pound, and sift it). Mix thor- 
oughly. Make cotton bags, one yard long and four 
inches wide. Dip them in strong salt and water, and dry 
before filling. Crowd the meat into the bags closely, 
pressing it with a pestle or potato-masher. Tie the bag 
tightl}' and keep in a cool place. When wanted for use, 
turn the end of the bag back, and cut off the meat in half- 
inch slices, and cook in a frying-pan till brown. Core 
and quarter several apples, and fry in the hot fat and serve 
with the sausages. 

A safe rule in seasoning sausage meat is o}ie even tahle^ 
spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of sifted sage, and a scant 
half-teaspoonfid of lohite pepper to each pound of meat. 

Souse. 

Take the gristly part of the pig's head, but not the fat; 
also the ears and feet. Remove the hard part from the 
feet. Scald or singe the hairs, soak in warm water, and 
scrape thoroughly. Let them remain in salt and water 
for ten hours. Scrape, and clean again, and put them a 
second time in freshly salted water. With proper care 
they will be perfectly clean. Put them in a kettle and 
cover with cold water ; skim when it begins to boil ; set 
back and let it simmer till the bones slip out easily. Skim 
out the meat, and remove the hard gristle, bones, and 
any superfluous fat. Season with salt, pepper, and vinegar, 
and pack in stone jars. When hard, cut in slices, and 
brown in the oven. 

Head Cheese. — Prepare the same as souse, omitting the 
yinegar, and season with sage. Put into a strainer cloth,

and press out the fat. Pack it in jars or moulds. Serve 
cold, or brown slightly in a ftying-pan. 

Though seldom seen on modern tables, these dishes 
when carefully prepared are ver}- acceptable to many who 
have pleasant recollections of them as served at ' ' grand- 
mother's table." 

To Try out Lard. 

Cut the leaves into small pieces ; remove all flesh and 
membrane ; put a few pieces in a kettle on the back of 
the stove, and when they are heated through, put in the 
remainder. Cook slowly- until the scraps are crisp ; strain 
through a fine cloth into tin pails or pans, and press that 
obtained from the scraps into a separate pail. Never put 
water with the leaves, as the object is to expel that which 
the}^ already contain, and there is no danger of burning 
if only a few pieces be put in at first, and the kettle be 
not over the hot fire. The kettle should not be covered 
until the scraps are crisp ; then cover it, and if no stea 
condenses on the cover, the water is evaporated. 



Baked Pork and Beans. 

Soak one quart of pea beans in cold water over night. 
In the morning put them into fresh cold water, and simmer 
till soft enough to pierce with a pin, being careful not to 
let them boil enough to break. If you like, boil one onion 
with them. AVhen soft, turn them into a colander, and 
pour cold water through them. Place them with tlie onion 
in a bean-pot. Pour boiling water over one quarter of a 
pound of salt pork., i)art fat and part lean ; scuape the rind 
till white. Cut the rind in half-inch strips ; l)ur3' the pork 
in the beans, leaving only the rind exposed. Mix one 
teaspoonfui of salt — more, if the pork is not very salt — 
and one teaspoonfui of mustard with one quarter of a cup of 
molasses. Fill the cup with hot water, and when well 
mixed pour it over the beans ; add enough more water to 
cover them. Keep them covered ^'^^ water until the 




250 The Boston Cook Book, 

last hour ; then lift the pork to the surface and let it ciisp. 
Bake eight hours in a moderate oven. Use more salt and 
one third of a cup of butter if you dislike pork, or use 
half a pound of fat and lean corned beef. 

The mustard gives the beans a delicious flavor, and 
also renders them more wholesome. Man}^ add a tea- 
spoonful of soda to the water in which the beans are boiled, 
to destroy' the acid in the skin of the beans. Yellow-eyed 
beans and Lima beans are also good when baked. 

Much of the excellence of baked beans depends upon the 
bean-pot. It should be earthen, with a narrow mouth and 
bulging sides. This shape is seldom found outside of 
New England, and is said to have been modelled after the 
Ass3Tian pots. In spite of the slurs against "Boston 
Baked Beans " it is often remarked that strangers enjo}' 
them as much as natives ; and man}' a New England bean- 
pot has been carried to the extreme South and West, that 
people there might have "baked beans" in perfection. 
They afford a nutritious and cheap food for people who 
labor in the open aii\ 

Parsnip and Pork Stew. 

Clean and scrape the rind of one quarter of a pound of 
"at t>altpork. Put it on to boil in tv^o quarts of cold water. 
Put with it any remuiiuts of cold roast pork or i^ork 
chops., first removing any burned parts ; or you may use 
one pound of fresh, uncooked pork^ or only the salt pork, 
if you pilfer. After it has stewed for an hour, skim off 
the fat. Wash and scrape two large j^ci'i'snips, cut then. 
in inch slices, and add them to the stew ; add, also, one 
small onion, sliced. Half an hour before dinner, add 
four or Jive potatoes., cut in small pieces, and parboiled 
five minutes. When done, skim out the meat and vegeta- 
bles, thicken the liquor with flour and water, add more 
salt and pepper, if necessary, cook ten minutes longer, 
then pour it over the meat. 



Poultry. 25 



POULTRY AND GAME. 

The flesh of poultiy and of game birds has less red 
blood than the flesh of animals ; but as it abounds in phos- 
phates, it is valuable food, particularly^ for invalids. The 
flesh is drier, and not marbled with fat as in that of quad- 
rupeds. All game has a strong odor and flavor, which is 
]\V some mistaken for that of tainted meat. It should be 
kept till tender, but no longer, unless frozen. 

White-fleshed game should be cooked till well done ; 
that with dark flesh may be served underdone. The 
breast of all birds is the most juicy and nutritious part. 
" The wing of a walker and the leg of a flier are consid- 
ered choice tidbits." 

To Choose Poultry and Game. — The best chickens have 
soft 3'ellow feet, short thick legs, smooth moist skin, plump 
breast ; and the cartilage on the end of the breast bone 
is soft and pliable. This is sometimes broken in fowls to 
deceive purchasers ; but the diflerence between a broken 
bone, that slips when moved, and a soft yielding cartilage 
ma}' be very easily detected. Pin feathers always indicate 
a young l)ird ; and long hairs, an older one. The bodies 
of capons are very plump and fat, and larger in proportion 
than those of fowls or chickens. The meat is of finer 
flavor. 

Old fowls have long thin necks and feet, and sharp 
scales ; the flesh has a purplish tinge, and they usually have 
a large amount of fat. 

The best turkeys have smooth black legs, with soft, 
loose spurs, full breasts, and white plump flesh. 

Geese and ducks should be young, not more than a year 
Old, have white soft fat, yellow feet, and tender wings, 
and be thick and hard on- the breast. The windpipe 



252 The Boston Cook Book. 

should break when pressed with the thumb and finger. 
Wild ducks have reddish feet. Tame ducks have thick 
yellowish feet. 

Young pigeons have light red flesh on the breast, and 
full flesh-colored legs. Old pigeons are thin, and the breast 
very dark. Wild pigeons are cheaper, but are dry and tough. 
Stall-fed pigeons are the best. Squabs are young tame 
pigeons, and always have pin feathers. 

Grouse, partridge, and quail should have full heavy 
breasts, dark bills, and yellowish legs. 

Young rabbits should have smooth, sharp claws, tender 
ears and paws, and short necks. 

Venison should be dark red, with some white fat. 

To Clean and Truss Poultry and Game. — The practice 
of sending poultry to market undressed is one that de- 
mands as earnest opposition from housekeepers as that of 
the adulteration of food. The meat is rendered unfit to 
eat, is sometimes infected with poison ; and the increase in 
weight makes poultry a very expensive food. All poultry 
should be dressed as soon as killed. The feathers come 
out more easilv when the fowl is warm, and when stripped 
off toward the head. If the skin be ver}' tender, pull the 
feathers out the opposite wa}'. Use a knife to remove the 
pin feathers. Singe the hairs and down by holding the 
fowl over a gas jet, or over a roll of lighted paper held 
over the fire. Cut off the head, and if the fowl is to be 
roasted, slip the skin back from the neck and cut the neck 
off close to the bod}', leaving skin enough to fold over on 
the back. Remove the windpipe ; pull the crop away 
from the skin on the neck and breast, and cut off close to 
the opening into the body. Be careful not to tear the skin. 
Always pull the crop out from the end of the neck, rather 
than through a cut in the skin, which if made has to be 
sewed together. Cut through the skin about two inches 
below the leg joint ; bend the leg at the cut hj pressing it 
on the edge of the table, and break off the bone. Then 
pull, not cut, out the tendons. If care be taken to cut 
only through the skin, these cords may be pulled out easily, 



Fowl. 253 

one at a time, with the fingers. Or take them all out at 
once, by putting the foot of the fowl against the casing of 
a door, then shut the door tightly and pull on the leg. 
The tendons wull come out with the foot ; but if once cut 
thc}^ cannot be removed. The drumstick of a roast chicken 
or turkey is greatly improved by removing the tendons, 
which always become hard and bon}^ in baking. There is 
a special advantage in cutting the leg below the joint, as 
the ends of the bones afford more length for tying, and 
after roasting this is easily broken off, leaving a clean, un- 
burned joint for the table. Cut out the oil bag in the tail. 
It is better to di'ess a fowl for a fricassee first. Then you 
Icai-n the position of the internal organs, and can tell bet- 
ter how to remove them when dressing for roasting, as 
with the whole fowl you work b}- feeling and not by sight.. 

To Cut nj) a Fowl for a Fricasspc. — Cut througli the 
loose skin between the legs and bod}', bend the leg over, 
and cut oflT at the joint ; then cut off the wings. Make an 
incision in the skin near the vent, and cut the membrane 
lying between the breastbone and the tail, down to the 
backbone, on each side. Then you have the intestines, 
gizzard, liver, and heart exposed, and can easily' remove 
them. Do not forget the kidnej's, lying in the hollow of 
the backbone, and the lungs in the ribs. Cut the ribs 
through the cartilage, separate the collar bone, and break 
the backbone just below the ribs. Divide at the joints 
in the wings and legs ; separate the side bones from the 
back, and remove the bone from the breast. Never chop 
the bones, but divide smoothl}^ at the joints. 

To Dress a Fowl for Foastinrj. — Make an incision near 
the vent; insert two fingers, loosen the fat from the skin, 
and separate the membranes lying close to the bod}'. 
Keep the fingers up close to the breastbone, until you can 
reach in beyond the liver and heart, and loosen on either 
side down toward the back. The gall l)ladder lies under 
the lobe of the liver on the loft side, and if the fingers be 
kept up, and everything loosened before drawing out, 
there will be no danger of its breaking. The kidneys and 




254 Th^ Boston Cook Book. 

lungs are often left in by careless cooks ; but everything 
that can be taken out must be removed. When the fowl 
has been cleaned careful!}-, it will not require much wash- 
ing. Hold it under the faucet, or rinse out the inside 
quickly ; then wipe dry. 

If the brea&tbone protrude more than is desirable, put a 
small knife in at the opening, and cut through the cartilage 
in the ribs or through the breastbone. Or put a pestle 
in the inside, la}' a towel over the breast, and pound slightly 
until the bone gives way. 

To Stuff a Fold. — Place the fowl in a bowl, and put 
the stuffing in at the neck ; fill out the breast until plump 
and even. Then draw the neck skin together at the end, 
and sew it over on the back. Put the remainder of the 
stuffing into the body at the other opening, and if full, sew 
it with coarse thread or fine twine. If not full, sewing is 
unnecessary, except when the fowl is to be boiled. 

To Truss a Fowl. — Draw the thighs up close to the body, 
and cross the legs over the tail, and tie firml}' with twine. 
Put a long skewer through the thigh into the body and out 
through the opposite thigh, and another through the wings, 
drawing them close to the body. Wind a string from 
the tail to the skewer in the thigh, then up to the one in the 
wing, across the back to the other wing, then down to the 
opposite thigh, and tie firmly round the tail. If you have 
no skewers, the strings must be passed round the body, 
over the thighs and wings ; and care must be taken, in 
remo^dng them, not to tear the browned crust on the breast. 
Sometimes the feet are cut off in the joint, and the legs 
passed into the body and out through an opening under 
the sidebone near the tail, or left in the body and covered 
with the skin. 

To Clean the Giblets. — Slip off the thin membrane round 
the heart, cut out the veins and arteries, remove the liver, 
and cut off all that looks green near the gall bladder. 
Trim the fat and membranes from the gizzard, cut thi'ough 
the thick part ; open it, and remove the inner lining with- 
out breakingc Cut otf all the white gristle, and use only 



Carving Poultry. 255 



the thick fleshy part. Wasli, and put thcin in cold water, 
and simmer till tender. The neck and tips of the wings 
are often cooked with the gihlels. 

These directions apply to all kinds of poultry and game. 

Wild ducks, coot, and geese should be washed thor- 
oughly on the outside before being drawn. Scrub them 
with slightly warm water and soap. The skin is very thick 
and oily, and it is impossible to get it clean without 
soap. 

The strong smell in old fowls may be removed by wash» 
ing in w^arm soda water. 

To dress Fowls or Birds for Broiling. — Singe, wipe, and 
split down the middle of the back ; lay open, and then 
remove the contents from the inside. Cut the tendons in 
the thigh, or break the joi;:tS, and remove the breastbone 
to facilitate the carving. 

To Carve Poidtrij, — Place the fowl on the platter, with 
the head at the left. Put the fork in across the breast- 
bone. Cut through the skin round the leg joint. Bend 
the leg over and cut off at the joint. Then cut off the 
wings, and divide wings and legs at the joints. Carve the 
breast in thin slices parallel with the breastbone. Some 
prefer to cut it nt right angles with the bone. Take off 
the wish-bone ; sepai-ate the collar-bone from the breast ; 
slip the knife under the shoulder blade, and turn it over. 
Cut through the cartilage wdiich divides the ribs, separat- 
ing the breast from the back. Then turn the back over, 
place the knife midway, and with the fork lift up the tail 
end, separating the back from the body. Place the fork 
in the middle of the backbone, and cut close to the l)ack- 
bone, from one end to the other, freeing the side bone. 
As soon as the legs and wings are disjointed, begin to 
serve, offering white or dark meat and stuffing as each 
prefers. Do not remove the fork from the breastbone till 
tlie breast is sei)arated from the back. Use an extra fork 
in serving. If all the fowl be not required, carve only 
from one side, leaving the opposite side whole for another 
meal. 



256 The Boston Cook Book, 

Gravy for Roast Poultry and Game. — Put the giblets^ or 
neck, liver, gizzard, and heart, on to boil in one quart of 
water^ and boil till tender, and the water reduced to one 
pint. Mash the liver, and if desired chop the gizzard, 
heart, and meat from the neck. Pour off the clear fat 
from the dripping-pan, and put the settlings into a sauce- 
pan ; rinse out the pan with the water in which the giblets 
were boiled, and pour this water into the saucepan and 
put on to boil. Put three or four tablespooitfuls of the fat 
into a small fryiug-pau ; add enough dry flour to absorb 
all the fat, and when brown add the giblet hquor gradu- 
ally, and stir till it thickens. Season with salt and pep- 
per. If not smooth, strahi it ; pour half of it into the 
gravy boat, and add the chopped gi])lets to the remaining 
half, and serve separately', as all may not care for the 
giblet gravy. 

Roast Turkey. 

Clean as directed on page 252. Stuff with sof bread or 
cracker crumbs highly seasoned with sage, thyme, salt, 
and pepper ; moisten the stuffing with half a cup of melted 
butter., and hot water enough to make it quite moist. Add 
one beaten egg. Some use salt pork chopped fine, but 
stuffing is more wholesome without it. Oysters, chestnuts, 
chopped celery, stoned raisins, or dates make a pleasing 
variet}'. 

For Stuffing and Trussing, see page 254. Put the turkey 
on a rack in a pan, rub well with butter, and dredge with 
salt, pepper^ and flour. Put in a hot oven, and when the 
flour is browned reduce the heat, and add a pint of loater. 
Baste Yv'ith butter until nicely browned ; then with the fat 
in the pan. Baste often, and dredge v>4th salt and flour 
after every basting. Allow three hours for an eight-pound 
turke3\ Cook till the legs will separate from the hocly. 
Prepare the graA'y as directed above. Garnish the lur- 
ke}' with parsley or celery leaves and sausages or force-meat 
balls. Serve cranberry sauce or currant jelly with roasl 
turkey. 



Roast Chicken 257 



If the giblets be not desired in tlie gravy, they ma}' be 
boiled, chopped fine, and mixed with the stuffing ; or 
make them into force-meat balls, with an equal amount of 
soft bread crumbs. Moisten, and season highl}', and br 
them in hot butter. 



Boiled or Steamed Turkey or Fowl. 

Clean; rub well with salt, pepper, and lemon juice, and 
stuff with oijster or bread stuffinr/. It is better without the 
stuffing, as the 03'sters are usualh' over-done, and the 
same flavor may be obtained from an 03'ster sauce served 
with the turkey. Truss the legs and wings close to the 
body ; pin the fowl in a cloth to keep it whiter and preserve 
the shape. Put into boiling salted water. Allow twenty 
minutes to the pound. Cook slowly till tender, but not 
long enough for it to fall apart. Turkeys are much nicer 
steamed than boiled. Serve with oyster, celery, lemon, 
or caper sauce. Garnish with a border of boiled rice or 
macaroni, and pour part of the sauce over the fowl. 

Fowls are sometimes stuffed with boiled celery, cut into 
pieces an inch long ; or with macaroni which has beec 
boiled and seasoned with salt and pepper. 

Roast Chicken. 

Singe ; remove the pin feathers, oil bag, crop, entrails, 
legs, and tendons. Wipe, stuff, sew, and tie or skewer 
into shape. Place it on one side, on a rack in a dripping- 
pan, without water. Dredge, and rub all over with salt, 
pepper, soft butter, sindjlour. Put chicken fat or beef drip- 
pings over it and in the pan. Roast in a hot oven, with 
a rack under the pan. When the flour is brown, check 
the heat, baste with the fat, and afterwards with one third 
of a cup of butter, melted in 07ie cup of hot tvater. When 
brown, turn the other side up ; then place it on the back, 
that the breast may be browned. Baste often, and dredge 
with flour after basting. Add more water if needed. 
Bake a four-pound chicken an hour and a half, or till the

joints separate easil}'. Lay buttered paper over it, if it 
brown too fast. 

Stuffing. — Moisten 07ie cup of cracker or soft bread crumbs. 
with one third of a cup of melted butter; season highly 
with salt^ pepper, and thyme. 

Chestnut Stuffing. — Shell one quart of large chestnuts. 
Pour on boiling water, and remove the inner brown skin. 
Boil in scdted water or stock till soft. Mash fine. Take 
half for the stuffing, and mix with it one cup of fine cracker 
crumbs ; season with one teaspoonful of salt., one saltspoon- 
ful of pepper., and one teaspoonful of chopped parsley. 
Moisten with one third of a cup of melted butter. Profes- 
sional cooks sometimes mix a little apple sauce., flavored 
with wine, lemon^ and sugar^ with a chestnut stuffing. 

Chestnut Sauce. — Remove the fat from the dripping- 
pan ; add nearly a pint of hot water ; thicken with fiour 
which has been cooked in brown butter ; add salt and pepper^ 
and the remainder of the chestnuts^ 

Braised Fowl. 

Prepare the same as for roasting ; dredge with salt., 
pepper, and flour^ and brown slightly in hot butter or 
chicken fat in a frying-pan. Put in a deep pan ; half 
cover with water. Add the giblets, one onion, and one table- 
spoonful of herbs tied in a bag. Cover with a tightly fitting 
pan, and bake till tender, basting often. Chop the gib- 
lets, thicken, season, and strain the gravy ; add the giblets, 
and pour around the fowl. 

Chicken Fricassee. 

Singe, and cut the chicken at the joints, in pieces for 
serving Cover with boiling water ; add one heaping teaspoon- 
fid of salt, and half a saltspoonful of pepper. Simmer one 
hour, or till tender, reducing the water to nearly a pint. 
Remove all the large bones, dredge with salt, pepper., and 
flour., and brown in hot butter. Put the chicken on toast 
on a hot platter. Strain the liquor and remove the fat. 



Chicken Curry. 259 



Add to the liquor one cup of cream or milk, and heat it 
again. Melt one large tablespoonftd of butter in a saucepan ; 
add two table spoonfuls of flour, and when well mixed pour 
on slowl}' the cream and chicken liquor. Add salt, pepper, 
Aalfa teaspoonful of celery salt, one teaspoonful of lemon juice. 
Beat one egg ; pour the sauce slowlj^ on the Qg^ ; stir well, 
and pour over the chicken. The chicken may be browned 
before cooking, then stewed, and a brown grav}' made bj^ 
browning the butter before adding the flour. Half a can 
of mushrooms may be added to improve the flavor, letting 
them simmer in the sauce five minutes. Arrange the body 
of the chicken in the centre of the dish, with the wings at 
the top, the thighs below, and the ends of the drumsticks 
crossed at the tail. 

If the chicken be not fried, it is simpl}^ a chicken stew ,- 
and dumplings may be added, or not, as you prefer. And 
if put into a deep dish with a rich grav}', made as for 
fricassee, but without the Qgg^ and covered with a rich 
(;rust of pastry and baked, it is chicken pie. 

Chicken Curry. 

Cut the chicken at the joints, and remove the breast 
bones. Wipe, season with salt and pepper, dredge with 
flour, and browai lightly in hot butter. Put in a stewpan- 
Fry one large onion, cut in thin slices, in the butter left in 
the pan till colored, but not browned. Mix one large 
tahlespoonfnl of flour, one teaspoonful of sugar, and one 
tablespoo7ful of curry powder, and brown them in the but- 
ter. Add slowd}' 07ie cup of wafer or stock and one cup of 
strained tomatoes, or 07ie sour apple chopped, and salt and 
pepper to taste. Pour this sauce over the chicken, and 
simmer one hour, or till tender. Add one cup of hot milk 
or cream. Boil one minute longer, and serve with a bor- 
der of boiled rice. 

Rabbit, veal, and lamb may be curried in the same 
way. 



26o The Boston Cook Booh. 



Broiled Chicken. 

Singe, and split a young spring chicken down the back. 
Break the joints ; remove the breastbone, clean, and wipe 
with a wet cloth. Sprinkle with salt and pepper^ and rub 
well with soft batter. Place in a double gridiron, and broil 
twentj' minutes over a clear fire. Spread with butter^ and 
serve very hot. Or cover with^«e bread crumbs and bake 
in a hot oven half an hour. Serve with Tartar sauce. 

To Carve. — Separate the legs and wings, and then sep- 
arate the breast from the lower part. 

Fried Chicken. 

Singe ; cut at the joints ; remove the breast bones. 
Wipe each piece with a clean w^et cloth ; dredge with salt. 
pepper^ and Jlour^ and saute them in hot salt porh fat till 
brown and tender, but not burned. Arrange on a dish, 
with boiled cauliflower or potato halls^ and pour a ivluto 
sauce over them. Or dip in egg and crumbs, and fry in 
deep hot fat ^ and serve with tomato sauce. 

Broiled Fillets of Chicken. 

Remove the bone from the breast and thighs. Rub the 
meat with butter or olive oil ; season, and cover with fine 
cracker dust. Broil about ten minutes. 



Devilled Chicken. 

Boil a chicken until tender in boiling salted water. 
When cold, cut at the joints, baste with soft butter, and 
broil till brown. Or cut any cold boiled or roasted chicken 
at the joints, rub with salt and butter, and broil till warmed 
through. Pour hot Tartar sauce over them. Or make 
several incisions in the flesh, and rub with mustard and 
cayenne pepper before broiling. 



Geese^ Bucks. 261 



Roast Goose. 

Singe, remove the pin feathers, and before it is cut or 
drawn, wash and scrub thoroughly in warm soapsuds, to 
open and cleanse the pores, and render the oil more easy ^ 
to be extracted. Then draw, as directed on page 253./^^^ 
Wash and rinse the inside in clear water, and wipe dry.J ' 
Stuff with mashed potatoes highly seasoned with onion, ^'^i^ 
sage, salt, and pepper, or with equal parts of bread crumbs, 
chopped apples, and boiled onions, seasoned with salt, sage, 
and pepper. Sew and truss ; put on a rack in a pan, and 
cover the breast with sUces of fat salt pork. Place in the 
oven for three quarters of an hour. The pork fat is 
quickly drawn out by the heat, flows over the goose, and 
aids in drawing out the oil. When considerable oil is 
extracted, take the pan from the oven, and pour off all the 
oil. Remove the pork, and dredge the goose with flour, 
and place again in the oven. When the flour is browned, 
add a little hot water, and baste often. Dredge with flour 
after basting. Cook until brown and tender. Make a 
gravy as on page 256. Garnish with watercresses. Serve 
with apple sauce. 

Roast Ducks. 

Pick, singe, and remove the crop, entrails, oil bag, legs, 
and pinions. Wipe, truss, dredge with salt, pepper, butter, 
and flour. Bake in a hot oven twent}' minutes if liked 
rare, or thirty minutes if preferred well done. Serve with 
olive sauce and green peas. Geese and ducks have a strong 
flavor, and are improved b}^ stuffing the craw and bod}* 
with apples cored and quartered. The apples absorb the 
strong flavor, therefore should not be eaten. Celery and 
onions are also placed inside the duck, to improve its 
flavor. 

Braised Ducks. 

Ducks that are tough and unfit to roast are improved 
b}' being braised with onions, carrots, and turnips. Or 
they may be stewed, and served with canned joeas. 



262 The Boston Cook Book, 



Larded Grouse. 

Clean, wipe, lard the breast and legs, and truss. Rub 
with salt and soft butter^ and dredge with flour. Roast 
twenty minutes in a quick oven if liked rare, thirty minutes 
if well done. Serve with bread sauce. 



Potted Pigeons. 

Draw and clean. Break the legs just above the feet ; 
leave enough below the joint to tie down to the tail. 
Wash and wipe. If old and tough, cover thera with vine- 
gar^ spiced and flavored with onion^ and let them stand 
several hours. This makes them tender. Drain and wipe ; 
stuff, if you like, with cracker crumbs highly seasoned and 
moistened with butter. Dredge with salt^ pepper^ and flour. 
Fry several slices of salt pork '; cut one large onion fine, 
and fiy in the salt pork fat. Put the crisp fat in the stew- 
pan, add the fried onion, then brown the pigeons all over 
in the fat left in the pan. Put them in the stewpan ; add 
boiling ivater or stock enough to half cover them ; add a 
pinch of herbs tied in a bag. Simmer from one to three 
hours, or till the pigeons are tender. Remove the fat 
from the broth, season to taste, and thicken with flour 
and butter cooked together. Strain over the pigeons, and 
serve hot. 

Braised Pigeons. 

Prepare the pigeons as for potted pigeons, and cook in a 
braising-pan. Cook spinach (see page 296) ; chop it fine, 
and season. Spread the spinach on slices of toast., and 
lay the pigeons on the spinach one on each slice. Serve 
the grav}' in a boat. 

Pigeons Stuffed with Parsley. {Miss Ward.) 

Allow one pint of loose parsley fov each pigeon. Wash, 
remove the large stems, and chop very fine, adding salt 



Birds. 263 

and jwpper and two or three tablespoon fids of water while 
chopping. 8tiitF the pigeons with the parsley' ; add also 
the heart and a half-inch cube o{ salt pork for each pigeon. 
Add the water left in the tray to tiiat in the stewpan. 
and cook as in the preceding rule. 

Roast Birds, 

Draw, and wash quickh' ; season witli salt and pepper. 
Pin a thin slice of salt pork on tlie breast. Put on a shal- 
low pan, and bake in a hot oven, fifteen or twent}' minutes. 
Baste often. Serve on toast with currant jelUj or with 
bread sauce. Small birds ma}' be baked in sweet potatoes, 
or if large cut in halves, using the breast only. Cut the 
potatoes in halves lengthwise, make a cavit}' in each 
half, season the bird with salt, pepper, and butter; fit 
it into the potato, put the other half over it, and bake 
till the potatoes are soft. Remove the string, tie with a 
bright ribbon, and serve in the potatoes, garnished with 
parsley. An inviting dish to serve to an invalid. 

Small birds are also broiled or stewed. 

Quail. 

Quail may be roasted, broiled, or braised ; or the breasts 
only ma}' be removed and broiled. Use the bones and 
trimmings to make stock for a rich sauce. 

Woodcock. 

Dress, and wipe clean. Dredge inside and out with salt 
and pepper ; tie the legs close to the body, skin the head 
and neck, and tie the Jbeak under the wings. Tie a piece 
of bacon over the breast, and fty in boiling lard two 
minutes ; or roast in the oven, and serve on toast. 

Venison. 

Venison is one of the most easily digested meats. It 
may be cooked after the same rules as mutton or beef. It 



264 



The Boston Cook Book, 



should be cooked rare, and served verj- hot with currant 
jell?/. The saddle, or loin, is the choicest cut for roasting 
or for steaks. Steaks are also cut from the leg. 

Venison steaks should be broiled the same as beefsteaks, 
and served with Maitre d' Hotel butter, made with currant 
jelly instead of lemon juice. The cheaper, tougher parts 
of venison ma}' be stewed or braised. Venison should be 
wiped carefully before cooking, as the hairs are often found 
clinging to the meat. 

Rabbits and Squirrels. 

These may be cooked the same as chickens, — stewed, 
fricasseed, or larded and ])aked.

long thin strips, la}' it aside, and chop all the remainder 
with the veal. Do not use any salt pork unless you wish 
the stuffing to taste like sausage meat. Add the cracker 
crumbs ; make it quite moist w'ith hot stock, and season 
to taste. Fill the legs and wings of the turkc}' with the force- 
meat. Put the fillets, which came out in boning, on the 
skin below the breast ; then a layer of force-meat with 
a little of the tongue here and there ; or you maj' use thin 
slices of boiled tongue or ham. Tlien a layer of the re- 
served meat from the chicken, and force-meat again. Sew 
and tie into the natural sha[)e. Or, if for a galantine, turn 
the legs and wings inside before stuffing, and roll up. Sew 
tightl}' in a cloth. Put the bones of chicken and turkey

and all the trimmings from the veal in a kettle, and cover 
with cold water. ISteam the turkey over the bones three 
hours. Remove the cloth, dredge with salt and Jiour^ and 
bake one hour or until nicely browned. Serve cold, and 
garnish with parsley, sparkling jelly, carrots, and beets cut 
into fancy shapes, or with potato balls. Carve in slices 
across the breast. 

When the turkey is to be moulded in jelly, strain the 
liquor in which the bones were boiled ; remove the fat, 
clear, and stitfen with gelatine as directed below. Make a 
brown aspic jelly with soup stock. Mould in the dark 
jelly and garnish wath the light, or vice versa.

given in stuffing for turkc}', according to the size of the 
fowl. Lardoons of pork may be inserted all over the top 
when the chicken is to be browned in the oven. 

To Mould hi Aspic Jelly. — Take enough stock to fill the 
mould, — beef if for dark jell}', and veal or chicken, if for 
light. Season highl}' with salt, pepper, celery seed, herbs, 
J^mon, or ivine. If a darker shade be desired, add a little 
caramel. For three pints of stock mix the whites and shells

Chicken in Jelly. 



mth. fancy vegetables of different colors^ slices o^ hard-boiled 
eggs^ Italian paste^ rings of macaroni^ etc. Fasten each 
oniaiiicnt in place with Hquid jell}', and when hard add 
enough jell}' to cover all. When this is hard, place the 
meat, or whatever you have to mould, in the centre, being 
careful not to let it 
break the jell}'. Keep 
the meat in place with 
some of the liquid jel- 
ly, and when hard add 
enough jelly to fill the 
mould. If to be dec- 
orated on the side, dip 
the ornaments in the liquid jelly, and if the mould be icy 
cold, they will adhere. The jelly must be added slowly. 
Keep in the mould in a cool place till ready to serve. 
To remove it, dip the mould quickly in warm (not hot) 
water, put the dish over it, and invert dish and mould 
together. Garnish Vi\i\\ parsley and sparkling jelly. 

Tongue^ boned turkey or chicken., birds., moulds of different 
kinds of meat andjlsh^ etc., may be served in jelly. 

Pressed Chicken. 

An Easy Way of Preparing Boneless Chicken. — Boil a 
fowl in as little water as possible till the bones slip out 
and the gristly portions are soft. Remove the skin, pick 
the meat apart, and mix the dark and white meats. Re- 
move the fat, and season the liquor highly with salt and 
pepper; also with celery salt and leinon juice., if you like. 
Boil down to one cupful, and mix with the meat. Butter 
a mould, and decorate the bottom and sides with slices of 
hard-boiled eggs ; also with thin slices of tongue or ham cut 
into round or fancy shapes. Pack the meat in, and set 
away to cool with a weight on the meat. When ready to 
serve, dip the mould in warm water, and turn out carefully. 
Garnish with parsley, strips of lettuce or celery leaves, and 
radishes or beets.

small pieces, and put them on the dough quite close to- 
gether. Sprinkle a little flour over the butter, and roll 
the paste over and over. Roll out again half an inch thick 
and roll up. Cut off from the ends of the roll, turn the 
pieces over and roll out half an inch thick for rims. Wet 
the paste in the dish with milk, and lay the rims round 
the sides of the dish. Put on two, three, or four rims, 
showing one above another, the inside rim the highest. 
Wet each rim to make it adhere. Fill the centre with the 
parboiled chicken. Take out some of the larger bones. 
Season the chicken liquor with salt and pepper^ and pour 
it over the chicken ; use enough to nearly cover. Cut the 
remaining quarter of butter into pieces the size of a chest- 
nutj and put them o/er the meat. Roll the remainder of 
the crust to fit the top. Make a curving cut in the crust 
and turn it back, that the steam may escape. Bake three 
hours in a bi'ick oven. If baked in a stove oven, put on 
onl}' two rims of crust and bake two hours.

salt and pepper to taste, the amount depending upon the 
seasoning in the sausages. The sausages ma}' be omitted, 
and a larger amount of chicken used. Butter a small 
mould, and pack the meat in closel}' to within an inch ol 
the top to allow for swelling. Put it on a trivet in a kettle, 
and steam three hours. If no uncooked meat be used, 
one hour will be sufficient. Cool it in the mould ; when 
read 3' to serve, dip the mould quickh^ into warm water

Rolls may be made in the same way by using raw lean 
meat from the round, cut in small thin slices ; pound it to 
break the fibre, and trim into shape. Rolls may be made 
of veal or thin slices of liver (parboil and remove the skin 
before using the liver) . If there be any of the chopped 
mixture left, make it into round or oval balls, roll in 
crumbs^ then in ogg^ and again in crumbs ; and brown in 
the oven or fry m fat. 

Beef Roulette. — Take a large thin slice of meat from 
the round, or any tough part ; pound it enough to break 
the fibre, and trim into rectangular shape. Season and

bacon. Bake till brown. The bacon will baste the mea*- 
sufficiently. 

Ragout of Cocked Meat. 

Cut one pint oH cold meat into half-inch dice ; remove the 
fat, bono, and gristle. Put the meat in a stewpan ; cover 
with boiling water^ and simmer slowly two or three hours,

potatoes shaped into a mound like a wall on the edge of 
a platter. Brush over with beaten white or yolk of an egg, 
and brown slightl3\ Fill with anj^ kind of cooked meat or 
fish warmed iu a white or brown sauce. 

Veal Birds. 

Slices of veal from the loin, cut ver}' thin. Wipe, re- 
move the bones, skin, and fat, and pound till one fourth 
of an inch thick. Trim into pieces two and a half b}' 
four inches. Chop the trimmings fine with one square

venient wa^' of using pieces of veal that vroiild not other- 
wise be utilized. 

Veal Loaf. 

Parboil two pounds of lean veal. Chop fine with ona 
fourth of a pound of salt pork or bacon ; add four butter 
crackers^ pounded, two eggs^ well beaten, tivo teaspoonfuh 
of salt^ one saltspoonful of pepper^ and half a saltspooiifid o\

into an oval loaf, and put into a shallow tin pan. Add 
a little of the water in which the meat was boiled. Bake 
till quite brown, basting often. Serve hot or cold, cut in 
slices. Raw veal may be used in the same way, baking 
it two hours or more. 

No. 2. — Select a knuckle of veal^ or an}' bony piece that 
has a large proportion o^ gelatine. Cut in small pieces, and 
remove an}- fragments of bone. Cover with cold icater^ 
boil quickly, skim, and add one onion ^ one teaspoonful of salt, 
and one saltspoonful of pepper. Let it simmer till the meat

liquor will harden, and hold the meat together without 
pressure. 

Meat Souffle. 

Make one cup of cream sauce, and season with chopped 
parsley and onion juice. Stir one cup of chopped meat 
(chicken, fresh tongue, veal, or lamb) into the sauce. 
When hot, add the beaten yolks of two eggs; cook one min- 
ute, and set away to cool. When cool, stir in the ichites, 
beaten stiff. Bake in a buttered dish about twenty min- 
utes, and serve immedialel}'. If for lunch, serve with a 
^nmhroom sauce. 



Potting. 277 



Potting. 

Chop and pound to a paste any fragments of cooked 
ham^ tongue^ bee f^ poultry^ game^ ov Jish. With ham use a 
quarter part fat. Remove all gristle and skin, and pound 
till free from an}- fibre and reduced to a paste. Season 
highly with salt^ ptppei\ cayenne, and 7nade mustard, and 
moisten with a little melted butter (except ham, which has 
fat enough). Pack closelj' in small stone or earthen jars. 
Put the jars in a steamer, and heat for half an hour. Then 
press the meat down again, and cover with hot melted 
butter. This will keep some time, and may be served in 
slices or used for sandwiches. Ham and tongue may be 
mixed with veal or chicken. Beef, game, and fish are 
better alone. 

Potted Liver. 

Braise a calf^s or lamb's liver in rich, highly seasoned 
stock. When tender, cut fine and pound to a paste, add- 
ing enough of the strained liquor in which it was cooked to 
moisten it ; add half a cup of butter, melted and strained. 
Rub all through a sieve; pack in jars and pour melted 
butter over the top. 

Ragout of Lamb's or Calf s Liver.

slices of lemon and hard-l)oiled eggs. 

Croquettes. 

These may be made of any kind of cooked meat, fish, 
oysters, rice, homin3% and man}* kinds of vegetables, or 
from a mixture of several ingredients. When mixed with 
a thick white sauce (see page 278), which adds ver}' 
much to the delicac}' of meat or fish croquettes, less meat 
is required. The sauce is a stiff paste when cold, and 
being mixed with the meat or fish the croquettes may be 




2/8 The Boston Cook Book, 

handled and shaped perfectly-, and when cooked will be 
soft and creamy inside. 

To Shape a Croquette. — Croquettes may be shaped into 
rolls, or ovals, or like pears, with a bit of parslej^ or a 
clove in the end to represent the stem. Take a tahlespoon- 
ful of the cold mi xtw-e, and shape into a smooth ball. If 
the mixture stick, wet the palms of the hands slightly. 
Give the ball a gentle, rolUng pressure between the palms 
till slightly cyhndrical ; then roll it lightly in the crumbs, 
clasp it gently in the hand, and flatten one end on the 
board. Turn the hand over, and flatten the opposite end. 
Place the croquette on a broad knife, and roll it in beaten 
eg^. With a spoon dip the egg over the croquette, drain 
on the knife, and roll again in the crumbs. Fry in deep 
hot fat (see page 15). Drain on paper. 

In rolling any kind of croquettes, if the mixture be too 
soft to be handled easilv, stir in enough fine cracker dusi 
to stiffen it, but never add an}' uncooked material liko 
flour, nor the dried bread crumbs used in rolling, as thosi 
will make the croquettes too stiff". 



Thick Cream Sauce (for Croquettes and Patties). 

lo teaspoonful salt. 
3^2 saltspoonful white pepper. 
72 teaspoonful celery salt. 
A few grains of cayenne. 



1 pint hot cream. 

2 even tablespoonfuls butter. 
4 heaping tablespoonfuls flour, or 
2 heaping tablesp. cornstarch. 

Scald the cream. Melt the butter in a granite sauce- 
pan. When bubbling, add the (by cornstarch. Stir till 
well mixed. Add one third of tlie cream, and stir as it 
boils and thickens. Add more cream, and boil again. 
When perfectly smooth, add the remainder of the cream. 
The sauce should be very thick, almost like a drop batter. 
Add the seasoning, and mix it while hot with the meat or 
fish. For croquettes, one beaten egg msiy be added just as 
the sauce is taken from the fire ; but the croquettes are 
whiter and more creamy without the egg. For patties, 
warm the meat or fish in the sauce, and use the egg or not 
as you please.

If this be done, use less of the sauce, or the croquettes 
will be difficult to shape. The white meat of chicken will 
absorb more sauce than the dark. Mushrooms, boiled 
rice, sweetbreads, calfs brains, or veal may be mixed with 
chicken. Cold roast chicken, chopi)ed fine, may be mixed 
with the stuflfing, moistened with the gravy, and shaped 
into croquettes.

butter, and steam it, or cook on the back of the stove until 
the rice is soft. Add one beaten egg and a little cream 
sauce, or thick tomato sauce, using enough to make it quite 

moist. When cool, shape into rolls. Roll in fine bread -, 

crumbs, then in egg, then in crumbs again, and fry in smoking /^^^ 
hot fat. Sometimes it is better to parboil the rice for five* 
minutes, as it is more difficult to soften it in stock than in 
clear water. 

Sweet Rice Croquettes. — Steam one scant cup of well- 
washed rice in one pint of boiling luater, or milk and water, 
thirty minutes, or till very soft. Add, while hot, one tea- 
spoonful of baiter, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and the well- 
beaten yolk of one egg, and a little hot milk, if it need more 
moisture. When cool, shape into small ovals, roll in 
crumbs, dip in egg, roll in crumbs again, and fty. Or, after 
shaping, press the thumb into the centre of each, and put 
in two boiled raisins or candied cherries, or half a teaspoonful 
of jelly or marmalade. Close the rice over the centre, roll 
in crutnbs, dip in egg, roll in crumbs again, and Ay. 

Savory Rice Croquettes. — One pint of cold boiled rice 
warmed in the double boiler with two or tlirte tablespoonfuls 
of milk. When soft, add one egg, well beaten, one table- 
spoonful of butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, one fourth of a 
saltspoonful of white p)cpper, a few grains of cayenne^ and 
one heaping tablespoo nful of fine chopped parsley. Shape, 
roll, and fry as usual. 

Rice or Macaroni Croquettes, — One pint of cold hoiiea 



282 The Boston Cook Book, 

rice or macaroni or spaghetti. Heat, and moisten with a 
little thick white sauce; add the beaten yolk of one egg^ two 
tablespoon/ills of grated cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. 
Cool, shape, roll in crumbs, dip in egg, roll in crumbs again, 
and fry. 

Hominy Croquettes. — Warm one pint of cooked hominy in 
one or tivo tablespoonfuls of hot milk ; add the beaten yolk of 
one egg, and salt to taste. Cool, shape, roll, and fry. 

Creme Frete. — Boil one pint of milk with an inch stick 
oi cinnamon. Beat together half a cup of sugar, two table- 
spoonfuls of cornstarch, one tablespoonful of flour, the yolks 
of three eggs, a quarter of a cup of cold milk, and one salt- 
spoonful of salt. Pour the boiling milk on the mixture, and 
stir well. Strain into the double boiler, and cook fifteen 
minutes, stirring often. Add one teaspoonful of butter and 
one teaspoonful of vanilla. Pour into a buttered bread pan 
about one inch deep, and set away to cool. When very 
hard, sprinkle a bread board v^iih fine bread crumbs. Turn 
the cream out on it, and cut into strips two and a half 
inches long and one inch wide, or in squares or diamonds. 
Roll these in crumbs, then dip in beaten egg, then in crmnbs, 
aiid fry brown in boiling lard. Sprinkle sugar over them, 
and serve hot.

Break the cheese in small pieces, or if hard grate it. 
Put it with the milk in a double boiler. Toast the bread, 
and keep it hot. Mix the mustard, salt, and pepper ; add 
the egg, and beat well. When the cheese is melted, stir 
in the egg and butter, and cook two minutes, or until it 
thickens a little, but do not let it curdle Pour it over the 
toast. Many use ale instead of cream. 

Cheese SojifjUe. — Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a 
saucepan ; add one heaping tablespoonful of flour ; when

smooth, add half a cup of milk^ half a teaspooiiful of salt, 
and i\ few (/rains of caijeune. Cook two minutes. Atld the 
yolks o^ three eggs, well beaten, and one cup o^ grated cheese. 
Set away to cool. When cold, add the whites, beaten to 
a stiff froth. Turn into a buttered dish and bake twenty- 
five or thirty minutes. Serve immediately. 

Crackers a la Creme. — Split butter crackers, and spread 
with butter, salt, pepper, mustard, and cheese if you like. 
Put them in a buttered pudding-dish, cover with milk, and 
bake thirty minutes. Omit the mustard, pepper, and cheese, 
prepare in the same way, and it is called Cracker Brewis. 

Sardine Canapes. — Mix the yolks of hard-boiled eggs 
with an equal amount of sardines rubbed to a paste ; season 
with lemon juice, and spread on thin slices of delicate toast- 
Put two pieces together, and cut in narrow strips. 

Turkish Pilaf. 

One cup of stewed and strained tomatoes, one cup of 
stock, seasoned highh' with salt, pepper, and minced onion. 
When boiling, add one cup of well-washed rice ; stir lightly 
with a fork until the liquor is absorbed, then add half a 
cup of butter. Set on the back of the stove or in a double 
boiler, and steam twenty minutes. Remove the cover, 
stir it hghtly, cover with a towel, and let the steam 
escape. Serve as a vegetable, or as a border for curry 
or fricassee. 

No. 2. — Prepare as in the preceding receipt. Add 
with the butter one cup of cooked 7npat (lamb, veal, or 
chicken), cut into half-inch pieces and shredded very fine- 
Serve as an entree. 



Sour Milk Cheese (sometimes called Dutch, Curd, or 
Cottage Cheese). 

1 quart thick sour milk. 1 saltspoonful salt. 

1 teaspoonful butter. 1 tablespoonful cream. 

Place the milk in a pan on the back of the stove, and 
scald it until the curd has separated from the whey. 



284 Tli^^ Boston Cook Book, 

Spread a strainer cloth over a bowl, pour in tlie milk, 
lift the edges of the cloth, and draw them together ; drain 
or wring quite drj'. There will be but half or two thirds 
of a cup of curd, but it is worth saving. It is the flesh- 
formhig or nutritive part of the milk. Put it in a small 
bowl, with the butter, salt, and cream ; mix it to a smooth 
paste with a spoon. Take a teaspoonful, and roll in the hand 
into a smooth ball. It should be quite moist, or the balls 
will crack. If too soft to handle, put it in a cool place for 
an hour, and then it will shape easil}'. Or it may be 
served without shaping, just broken up lightly with a 
fork. If scalded too long, the curd becomes veiy hard 
and brittle. It is better when freshl}' made, and is deli- 
cious with warm gingerbread. An excellent lunch or tea 
dish. Season this cheese with one tahlesjooonful of finely 
powdered sage, if 3'ou like the flavor. 

Forefathers' Dinner. 

Succotash is the great dish in Plymouth at every cele- 
bration of Forefathers' Day, December 22. Tradition 
says it has been made in that town ever since the 
Pilgrims raised their first corn and beans, and it is 
supposed the3' learned to make it from the Indians. 

Strangers are rather shy of this peculiar mixture ; bnt 
it is a favorite dish with the natives, and to this day is 
made b}' some families man}' times through the winter 
season. Although the dish has never been made by vhe 
writer, it has been tested by her in that ancient town 
many times, and the excellence of the following receipt 
is unquestionable. It is given in the name of Mrs. 
Barnabas Churchill of Plymouth, a lady who has made 
it for fifty years after the manner handed down through 
man}^ generations. 

One quart of large ivhite leans (not the pea beans) ; six 
quarts of hulled corn, — the smutty white Southern corn ; 
six to eight pounds of corned heef, from the second cut of 
the rattle rand; one pound of salt porJc, fat and lean; 



Succotash. 285 



chicken weighing from four to six pounds ; one large 
white French turnip ; eight or ten mediuin-sized potatoes. 
Wash the beans, and soak over inght in cold water. In 
the morning pat them on in cold soft water. When boil- 
ing, change the water, and simmer until soft enough to 
mash to a pulp and the water is nearl}^ all absorbed. 
Wash the salt pork and the corned beef, which should 
be corned onl^' three or four days. Put them on about 
eight o'clock, in cold water, in a very large kettle, and 
skim as they begin to boil. Clean, and truss the chicken 
as for boiling, and put it with the meat about an hour and 
a quarter before dinner time. Allow a longer time if a 
fowl be used, and keep plenty of water in the kettle. 
Two hours before dinner time, put the beans, mashed to 
a pulp, and the hulled corn into another kettle, with some 
of the fat from the meat in the bottom to keep them from 
sticking. Take out enough liquor from the meat to cover 
the corn and beans, and let them simmer where the}' will 
not burn. Stir often, and add more liquor if needed. 
The mixture should be like a thick soup, and the beans 
should absorb all the liquor, vet it must not be too 
dry. 

Pare, and cut the turnip into inch slices ; add it about 
eleven o'clock, and the potatoes (pared) half an hour 
later. Take up the chicl^^n as soon as tender, that it 
may be served whole. Serve the beef and pork together, 
the chicken, turnip, and potatoes each on separate dishes, 
and the beans and corn in a tureen. The meat usually' 
salts the mixture sufficiently, and no other seasoning is 
necessar}'. Save the water left from the meat, to use in 
warming the corn and beans the next da}^ serving the 
meat cold. This will keep several da3's in cold weather ; 
and, like many other dishes, it is better the oftener it is 
warmed over, so there is no objection to making a farge 
quantity. The white Southern corn is considered the only 
kind suitable for this ancient dinner. 



286 The Boston Cook Book, 



HuUed Com. 

Tie a quart of oah wood ashes in a flannel bag, and put 
it with three gallons of cold water into an iron kettle. Let 
it boil and become l3e, or till the water is black. Put in 
four quarts of corn^ and boil till the hulls have all started. 
Stir it well with a wooden spoon. Then pour it into a 
large pan of cold water, and rub with the hand thoroughly 
to loosen the hulls. Change the water five or six times, 
and wash and rub till the corn is white and clean. Keep 
in cold water over night ; then put on in fresh cold water, 
and simmer four hours, or till soft and floury. Take ofl 
the hulls and scum from the water, and add fresh water 
several times during the simmering. 

Indian Meal Pudding. {Mrs. Barnabas Churchill.) 

Rub a tahlespoonfid of hutter round the bottom and sides 
of a smooth iron kettle, — granite or porcelain will do; 
when melted, add half a cup of boiling water. This will 
prevent the milk from burning. Add one quart of milk. 
Let it boil up, and almost over the kettle ; then sift in one 
pint ofjine yellow granulated -corn meed., sifting with the left 
hand, and holding the meal high, that ever}' grain may be 
thoroughl}' scalded. Stir constantly; add half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt^ and set away till cold. Then add half a pint of 
New Orleans molasses and o?ie quart of cold milk. Put into 
a well-buttered deep pudding-dish, cover with a plate, and 
bake ver}' slowh' ten or twelve hours. Put it in a " Satur- 
da}^ afternoon oven," where the flre will keep low nearl}' 
all night. Let it remain over night, and serve for a Sun- 
day breakfast. 

Chickins fore'd with Oysters. 

(Taken from a receipt book written in 1764.) 

Take Oysters, parsley, Onions, butter, pepper, Salt, grated 
Bread, Mushrooms — if you can get y"\ & as many eggs 
as you think propper, fill them inside, & Cut y™ on the 



Bean Porridge 287 



breast, if you have a mind to, & put some of the stuffing 
there, make gravy of Oysters, butter & mace, pepper, 
roast them well. 



Bean Porridge. {Mrs. C. M. Poor.) 

Five pounds of corned beef, not too salt, or four pounds 
of heefviud one of salt pork; one pint of dry white beans, four 
tablespoonfuls oi corn meal, pepper and salt to taste, one pint 
of hulled corn. Soak the beans over night. In the morn- 
ing parboil in fresh water with a pinch of soda till soft. 
Put the corned beef and pork in cold water, skim carefully, 
and simmer four or five hours, or till tender. Take out, 
and cut into two-inch pieces, and remove the bone and 
gristle ; also the fat from the liquor. Put the meat and 
beans into the meat liquor, and simmer ver}' slowly three 
or four hours, or till most of the beans are broken. Half 
an hour before serving stir in the meal, first wetting it in 
cold water to a smooth paste. The meal should thicken 
the porridge to about the consistency of a thick soup. The 
meat should be cooked till it falls apart. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper. Add the hulled corn, and when hot 
serve with brown bread. Sometimes the vegetables usu- 
all}' served with a boiled dinner are cooked with the meat, 
then removed, and the beans cooked as above, in the meat 
liquor. 

" This old-fashioned and very nutritious dish was one of 
the chief articles of winter food at my grandmother's farm 
in Northern New Hampshire eight3' years ago. When 
cooked, it was poursd into bowls or basins holding from 
a pint to two quarts. A nice tow string was laid in a loop 
over the edge, and the porridge was placed where it would 
freeze. By holding the dish in hot water it would cause 
the porridge to slip out ; then it was hung up by the loops 
in the ' butter}',' and was considered ' best when nine 
days old.* At early dawn the ' men folks ' who went into 
the forest ' chopping' would take the skillet, or a little 
three-legged iron kettle, some large slices of 'r3'e and 



288 The Boston Cook Book. 

Indian' bread in their pockets to keep it from freezing. 
The porridge was hung, wrapped in a clean towel, upon 
the sled stakes. Their spoons were made of wood. The 
hay that laj' on the floor of the ox sled was of use to keep 
their feet warm, and given to the oxen for 'bait' at noon. 
When it was twelve o'clock ' b}' the sun,' they kindled a 
fire by the aid of a ' tinder box,' warmed their porridge, 
and with their brown bread enjoyed this strong food as no 
modern epicure can his costly French dishes." 

Smothered Chicken. {A daline Miller.) 

Clean a chicken, too old for broiling ; split down the 
back, and put it breast upwards in a shallow pan ; pour 
over it one cup of boiling loater^ and cover tightly to keep 
in the steam. Cook half an hour ; then baste with the hot 
water, rub all over with softened butter^ and dredge with 
salt and pepper. Baste often, keep closel}- covered, and 
cook till tender. It should be yellow, not dark brown. 
Thicken the grav}^ ; add cliopped parsley, salt, and pep- 
per, and pour it over the chicken. 

Steamed Apple and Indian Meal Pudding. {Mrs. Faunce.) 

Scald two cups of cor7i meal with boiUng water. Add 
one teaspoonful of salt, one fourth of a cup of molasses, 
and two tart apples cut into eighths and cored, but not 
pared. Dissolve half a teaspoonful of soda in warm 
water, and add to the meal. Add more warm water to 
make a batter thin enough to pour. Pour into a grea^sed 
pail, place it on a trivet in a kettle of boiling water. 
Cook three hours. The water must not stop boihng. To 
be eaten with roast meat. The next day warm what is 
left in the meat gravy. 



Bolani) of Food. 289 



VEGETABLES. 

Vegetable food, in its widest sense, includes some pai't 
of every form of plant growth, — herb, shrub, or tree, — 
used either as vegetables, fruits, grains, condiments, or 
beverages. Vegetables, as the term is generall}' used, are 
such plants as are cultivated for culinary purposes. They 
comprise a variety of the parts of the plant, — roots, 
stems, leaves, flowers, and fruit. 

Before studying vegetables proper, it may be interesting 
for those who have never considered food from a botan- 
ical point of view to glance at the various forms of veg- 
etable growth commonly used as food. 

Beginning with roots^ we find, among fleshy roots, the 
carrot, turnip, parsnip, beet, salsifv, and radish, which are 
cooked in their natural state or used raw. Also from 
roots we get ginger, aiTowroot, and tapioca. Rootstocks^ or 
stems growing underground, consist of tubers^ like the 
potato, yam, and artichoke, and of scaly bulhs, like the onion, 
chives, leek, and garlic. Stems we eat in asparagus ; and 
whole trunks of trees are felled and used in making sago, 
which is the pith of a species of palm-tree. 

Leaves include lettuce, endive, spinach, parsley, cabbage, 
and greens of various kinds. Dried leaves and flowers are 
used in the form of tea, sage, thyme, bay leaves, tobacco, 
marjoram, savory, and other herbs. Leaf stalks include 
celery and rhubarb ; flower stalks^ cauliflower and globe arti- 
chokes. The juices of vegetables furnish many forms of 
food, — sugar, acids, honey, oil, gum, and wines. The 
bark we use in cinnamon. Unexpanded flower-buds are 
pickled, as in capers, or dried, as in cloves. Ripe cloves 
have no aroma. 

Many seeds or berries are gathered green, and are then 
dried for use. Allspice, or Jamaica pepper, cassia buds. 

19 




290 The Boston Cook Book, 

long pc[)pers, and black i)epper are of this class. Mustard 
and cclev}- seeds are used as well as the leaves. Nutmegs 
are seeds ; and mace is the unl, or covering, of the nutmeg. 
Seed vessels are used green, as in string beans, and also dried 
and ground, as in ca3'enne pepper. Farinaceous seeds or 
grains include wheat, rye, oats, corn, barle}', rice, and buck- 
wheat. They have a thin seed vessel adhering closely to 
the whole surface of the seed. Oleaginous seeds contain 
oil and starch, like the cocoanut, walnut, chestnut, almond, 
etc. Leguminous seeds are enclosed in pods, as peas, beans, 
lentils, etc. 

Under the general name oi fruit we eat ver}^ different 
things. Flesliy fruits^ like grapes, tomatoes, gooseberries, 
blueberries, cranberries, and currants, are pulpy seed vessels. 
Oranges and lemons are pulpy seed vessels, with a thick 
leathery rind. Squashes, melon, cucumbers, egg-plant, etc., 
are flesJiy fruits with a hard rind. Chocolate is made 
from the seed of tx fleshy fruit. In checkerberries, quinces, 
and in all parts of the apple and pear but the core, we cat 
2i fleshy., enlarged calyx. In peaches, plums, apricots, cher- 
ries, and other stone fruits, we eat the outer part of a peri- 
carp or seed vessel. Olives belong to this class, and are 
used green and in the form of oil expressed from the 
fleshy pericarp. Coffee is the seed of a stone fruit. In 
figs we eat a hollow flower stalk, grown pulpy, and the 
inside lined with a great number of flowers. Mulberries 
are clusters of the jmlpy flower leaves and stalk of minute 
multiple flowers. Pineapples are mulberries on a large 
scale. The strawberry is the receptacle of a flower grown 
juicy and pulpy, and bearing man}' one-seeded seed vessels 
on its surface. Blackberries also are receptacles, though 
smaller, covered wdth clusters of little stone fruits. Rasp- 
berries are the little stone fruits in a cluster without the 
receptacle. 

JNIany fruits, when dried, are called by different names. 
Dried currants are small grapes. Sultanas are larger 
grapes, and raisins are another and larger variety of the 
same fruit. Prunes and prunellas are dried plums. 



Vegetables, 29 1 




Some of the lower orders of vegetation afford valuable 
food. Irish and Ceylon mosses are seaweeds. Iceland 
moss is a lichen. Truffles and mushrooms are a species of 
fungi of vegetable growth, but possessing a strong meaty 
or animal flavor. 

We need a large varietj' of vegetables in our food to 
promote perfect health. Vegetables are rich in saline 
substances which counteract the evil effect of too much 
animal food. Some are rich in organic acids, and man}' 
abound in indigestible ligneous tissues which are useful 
in certain conditions. Those which contain starch and 
albumen and which can be stored for use during tlie winte^ 
months are considered the most valuable. All vegetables j 
need the addition of salt and butter, or some form of fat^< 
and many are rendered less indigestible bj' seasoning with "^^^~A5^ 
pepper. Peas, beans, squashes, beets, turnips, etc., which 
contain sugar, should be slightl}' sweetened, as much of 
the natural sweetness is lost in cooking ; and those con- 
taining potash salts, as caljljage and lettuce, need an acid 
condiment. Beans, peas, and other vegetables, which are 
difficult of digestion, are less indigestible if eaten in the 
form of purees. 

Green vegetables should be freshly gathered, thoroughly 
washed in cold water, and cooked in freshl}- boiling 
salted water. It is impossible to give a definite time 
for cooking, as much depends upon their age and the time 
they have been gatliered. Wilted vegetables require a 
much longer time than fresh. All vegetables should be 
cooked until soft and tender, and no longer. This is 
better ascertained by watcliing them carefully and piercing 
with a fork than by depending upon any time-table. Veg- 
etables which are eaten raw and are liable to ferment in 
the stomach are usually dressed with some condiment, — 
oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. 

Ever}' green vegetable keeps its color better if it be 
boiled rapidl}' and uncovered. Many use soda for the 
same purpose, but unwisely. 



292 The Boston Cook Book, 



Potatoes. 

The potato is more generall}^ used than an}' other veg- 
etable. It combines with other foods — meats particularly 
— to give the desired elements. But it should not be used 
alone, or in too great a proportion, as it gives very little 
flesh-forming material. When taken exclusivel}', such a 
large bulk of it is required for sustenance that it results 
in increased size and prominence of the stomach, which 
sometimes amounts to deformit}'. 

Potatoes are three fourths water. The solid matter 
consists largely- of starch, with a small quantit}' of albumen 
and mineral matter held in solution in the juices. The 
quantit}" of starch increases during the autumn, and remains 
stationary daring the winter. In spring, when germination 
commences, the starch is changed to gum, and renders 
the potatoes mucilaginous. The sugar formed from this 
gum renders them sweeter. Potatoes which have been 
frozen and thawed suddenly are sweeter and more watery 
than before, because on exposure to the warmth and air 
the starch is changed to sugar. They should be kept 
frozen until ready to use, or used immediately after thaw- 
ing in cold water. The sprouts on potatoes should be 
removed as soon as the}' appear, since, if the}' are allowed 
to grow, the}' exhaust the starch, and render the potatoes 
unfit for food. Potatoes should be kept in a dry, cool 
cellar. 

Botanicall}^ potatoes belong to the same poisonous 
order as tobacco and deadly nightshade, and contain an 
acid juice which is unpleasant to the taste and often 
renders them indigestible. This lies in and near the rind 
of the potato. It is drawn out by heat. When the 
potatoes are baked it escapes in the steam, if they are 
opened at once ; and when the}' are boiled, it is absorbed 
by the water. It is not wasteful, therefore, to peel pota- 
toes before cooking, or to take ofl^ quite a thick peel, as 
they are thus rendered more wholesome. Taste the water 
in which potatoes have been boiled, and you will have no 



Potatoes, 



293 



desire to use it in 3'our 3'east, bread, or stews. Potatoes 
when first peeled are white, but turn brown on exposure 
to the air. For this reason they should be covered with 
cold water as soon as peeled. New potatoes are watery-, 
as the starch is not fully formed. They have a very thin 
skhi, which may be rubbed or scraped off. 

Raw potatoes which are to be fried should be thinly 
sliced, and soaked in cold water to draw out all the starch, 
that thej' may be crisp and not meal}'. The cells which 
hold the starch grains are of an albuminous nature. 
These cells are divided in slicing the potatoes, and the 
starch is drawn out into the water ; the albuminous mem- 
brane hardens in frying, and makes the potatoes crisp. 

Boiled potatoes should be drained the moment the heat 
bursts all the starch grains, which ma}' easih* be determined 
by their soft texture when pierced with a fork, else the 
starch will absorb water, and the potatoes become pasty 
and unwholesome. 

Baked potatoes should be served as soon as soft, and 
the skin should be slightly ruptured by squeezing to let 
the steam within escape, else it will condense and make 
the potato watery and unwholesome. Potatoes which are 
cut or sliced for stews and chowders should be soaked 
and scalded to remove the greenness before adding them 
to the stew. 

Boiled Potatoes. — Select potatoes of uniform size. 
Wash and scrub with a brush. Pare, and soak in cold 
water. Put them in boiling salted water, — one quart 
of ivater and one fahlespoonful of salt for six large potatoes. 
Cook half an hour or until soft, but not until broken. 
Drain off every drop of the water. Place the kettle un- 
covered on the back of the stove to let the steam escape. 
Keep hot until read}' to serve. 

Potatoes a la Neige. — Prepare the potatoes as above, 
and when well drained and mealy beat them thoroughly 
with a fork, add salt to taste, and serve at once, piled 
lightly on the dish. 

Rice Potato. — Rub the beaten potato through a squash

strainer iuto the dish in which it is to be served. Keep 
the dish in a pan of hot water, and use a potato masher 
or pestle to facilitate the rubbing. Mashed and riced 
potatoes ma}' be browned b}' placing the dish in the oven 
a few minutes. 

Mashed Potatoes. — To one pint of hot hoiled potatoes^ 
add one tahlespoonful of butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
half a saltspoonfid of pepper, and hot milk or cream to 
moisten. Mash in the kettle in which the}' were boiled, 
and beat with a fork until light and cream}*, and turn out 
lightl}- on a dish. Never smooth it over, as that wih make 
it heav}' and compact. 

Potato Balls. — One pint of hot mashed potatoes highh' 
seasoned with salt, pepper, celery salt, chopped parsley, and 
hatter; moisten, if needed, with a \\tt\Q hot milk or cream. 
Beat one egg light, and add part of it to the potatoes. 
Shape into smooth round balls. Brush over with the re- 
mainder of the Qgg, and bake on a buttered tin until 
brown. Be careful not to get them too moist. 

Potato Puff. — Prepare as for potato balls, making it 
quite moist with cream or milk. Beat the yolks and whiter 
of two eggs separately, and stir them into the potatoes 
when slightl}' cooled. Turn into a shallow baking-dish, 
pile it in a rock}' form, and bake ten minutes, or until it is 
puffed and browned. x\dd half a cup of finely chopped 
cooked meat, to give a variety. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes. — Cut one pint of cold hoiled potatoes 
into dice, and season with salt and pepper. Fry one scant 
tahlespoonful of minced onion in one heaping tahlespoonful of 
hatter, until yellow. Add the potatoes, and stir with a 
fork until they have absorbed all the butter, being careful 
not to break them. Add one tahlespoonful of chopped 
parsley, and serve hot. One tahlespoonful of vinegar 
heated with the butter gives the potatoes a nice flavor. 

Creamed Potatoes. — Cut cold boiled potatoes into cubes 
measuring one third of an inch, or into thin slices. Put 
them in a small shallow pan. cover with milk, and cook 
until the potatoes have absorbed nearly all the milk. To

one pint of potatoes add one tablcspoonful of butter^ half a 
teaspoonfid of salt^ half a saltspoonJ'aL of j)epper, and a little 
chopped parsley. 

Fried Potatoes. — Cut cold boiled potatoes into slices 
about a quarter of an inch thick. Have a fiying-pan hot 
and well greased with salt pork or bacon fat. Cook the 
potatoes in the fat until brown, then turn, and brown the 
other side. 

French Potatoes. — Fr}' as above, pour a white sauce on 
a platter, and arrange the fried potatoes on the sauce. 

Potatoes a la Matt re d' Hotel. — Prepare the Mattre 
d^Hotel butter ; mix one tablespoonfid of butter^ creamed, with 
the whole yolk of one egg. Add one teaspoonfid of lemon juice ^ 
one tablespoonfid of chopped parsley ., half a teaspoonfid of salt., 
and half a saltspoonfid of pepper. Cut oiie pint of cold boiled 
potatoes in thin slices or dice, or cut raw potatoes into 
balls with a French cutter, and boil them ten minutes. 
Warm the potatoes in milk enough to barely cover them. 
When the milk is nearly absorbed, stir in quickly the 
Maitre d'Hotel butter, and serve at once. 

Baked Potatoes. — Select smooth potatoes of uniform 
size. Wash, and scrub well. Bake in a hot cr\^en about 
forty-five minutes, or until soft. Pinch them to break the 
skins, and let the steam escape. Serve at once, and 
never cover, as the steam causes them to become soggy. 

Franconia Potatoes {Baked with Meat) . — Wash, scrub, 
and pare potatoes of uniform size. Put them in the drip- 
ping-pan with the moat, and baste when the meat is 
basted. Or place them in a small tin pan beside the 
meat or on the grato, and baste with the dripping. 

Potatoes in the Half- Shell., or Souffle. — Wash, scrub, 
and bake three smooth potatoes. Cut in halves lengthwise, 
and without breaking the skin scoop out the potato into a 
hot bowl. iSrash. and add one even tablcspoonful of butter, 
one of hot milk, and salt and pepper to taste. Boat the whites 
of two eggs stiff, and mix it with the potato. Fill the skins 
with the potato mixture, heaping it lightl}' on the top. 
Brown slightly. 




Fig. 39. Stuffed Potatoes. 



296 The Boston Cook Book. 

Stuffed Potatoes. — Bake potatoes of equal size ; when 
done, aDcl still hot, cut off a small piece from tlie end of 
each potato. Scoop out the inside. Mash, and mix with 

it half the quautitj' o^ cooked 
meat^ highh' seasoned and 
finely chopped. Fill tlie 
skins a little above the 
edge. Set in the oven to 
brown the tops. Or omit 
the meat, and fill onl}' with 
the mashed and seasoned 
potato. Replace the cover, and heat again. 

Fried Raw Potatoes. — Pare, wash, and cut into the de- 
sired shape. Soak in cold salted water, drain, and dry 
between towels. Fry in clear fat, hot enough to brown 
while counting sixt}'. Drain, and sprinkle with salt. 

Saratoga Potatoes are shaved in thin slices. Parisienne 
Potatoes are cut in small balls with a French vegetable 
cutter. Macaroni.! or Shoo Fhj., Potatoes are cut in quarter- 
inch slices, then in quarter-inch strips. Crescents and 
other shapes may be cut with vegetable cutters. 

These are all to be fried ; but some prefer to boil the 
Parisienne potatoes, and serve in a cream sauce., flavored 
with parsley. 

Sweet Potatoes may be baked or boiled. They are better 
baked. Cold sweet potatoes may be cut in slices, warmed 
in milk., and seasoned with butter and salt., or browned in 
hutter. 

A Southern Dish. {Adaline Miller.)'— Cut cold baked 
sweet potatoes into quarter-inch slices, and put them in an 
earthen dish. Spread each layer with butter, and sprinkle 
slightly with sugar, and bake nntil hot and slightly browned. 
Sweet potatoes are much richer when twice cooked. 

Spinach. 

Pick over, trim off the roots and decayed leaves ; wash 
thoroughly, lifting the spinach from one pan of water into 
another, that the sand may be left in the water, and 



Greens. 297 

changing the water until it is clear. Put the spinach in a 
large kettle without water. Place it on the stove where it 
will cook slowly until the juice is drawn out, then boil 
until tender. Drain and chop fine. For half a peck of 
spinach add one large tablespoonful of butter, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt^ and a quarter of a saltspoonful of pepper ; 
or add a little thin cream sauce. Heat again and serve on 
toast. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs and toast points, or 
serve cold with French dressing. 

Spinach is nearly all water, and a smaller portion of the 
potash salts — its most valuable constituent — is lost when 
it is cooked in its own juices. 

Greens. 

The leaves and stalks of 3'oung beets, milkweed, dande- 
lions, and narrow dock are useful as food in the earlj- 
spring, chiefly for the water and alkaline salts which the}' 
contain. They should be picked over, and washed care- 
fully, cooked in boiling salted water until tender, then 
drained, and seasoned with butter and salt. Vinegar is 
often used with them as a desirable condiment. Many 
people consider it necessaiy to boil a piece of salt pork with 
greens, but the}' are more wholesome when seasoned with 
butter. Dandelions should be cooked in plenty of water ; 
but other tender greens may be cooked, like spinach, in 
their own juices. 

Asparagus. 

Wash carefully and break (not cut) into inch pieces 
as far as each stalk can be broken. When it will not snap 
off quickly, the stalk is too tough to be used. Cook in 
boiling salted water, deep enough to cover, for fifteen min- 
utes, or until tender. "When the asparagus is not fresh 
and tender, it is well to boil the hardest part first, and add 
the tender heads after ten minutes. Drain, season with 
butter and salt, or pour white sauce over it, and serve on 
toast. Man}' people prefer to leave the stalks whole, and 
tie them into bundles before boiling. When served in this 
wav, unless all the tough part be broken off before cook- 



2g8 The Boston Cook Book, 

ing, it is inconvenient, if not impossible, to cut the stalk 

afterward. 

Green Peas. 

Peas are fresh when the pods are green, crisp, and 
plump. The fresh pods are sweet, and full of flavor. 
Wash the pods before shelling, then the peas will requh'e 
no washing. Put the peas into a colander, and sift out 
the fine particles. Boil the pods ten minutes, skim them 
out, and add the peas. Boil fifteen minutes, or till tender. 
When nearly done, add the salt. Let the water boil nearly 
away, and serve without draining, except when the peas 
are to be served as a garnish. Season with butter, cream, 
salt^ and a little sugar. 

Old peas should be cooked until tender, drained, mashed, 
and rubbed through a sieve, and served as a vegetable or 
made into a puree. 

Peas are nutritious, but they are indigestible unless the 
hull be broken before they are swallowed. 

Beans. 

String Beans. — Remove the strings. The surest way 
to do that is to pare a thin strip from each edge of the pods. 
Man}' persons think this unnecessarv ; but the beans are 
much more delicate, and two or three strings are enough 
to spoil the whole dish. La}' a handful of the pods on a 
board with the ends even, and cut them all at once into 
inch pieces. Wash, and cook in boiling salted water from 
one to three hours, the time varying with different vari- 
eties of beans. Drain ; season with butter, salt, and cream, 
and serve hot, or serve cold as a salad. When ver}' young 
and tender, the}' may be cooked in just water enough to 
keep them from burning. 

Shelled Beans. — Wash, and cook in boiling water; al- 
ways use soft water. Add salt after ten minutes, and boil 
until tender. Let the water boil nearly away, and serve 
without draining. Season with buffer and salt. Lima 
beans and other white varieties are improved by adding 
a little hot cream. 



Corn. 299 



Green or Sweet Com. 

Remove the husk, and every thread of the silk}^ fibre. 
Put into boiling water, cover with the clean inner husks, 
and cook from five to fifteen minutes. Try a kernel, and 
take up the corn as soon as the milk has thickened and 
the raw taste is destroyed. Corn, if boiled a long time, is 
made hard and its flavor impaired. 

Green Corn Fritters^ or Mock Oysters. — Cut through 
each row of kernels with the point of a sharp knife. Then 
with the back of the knife press out the pulp, and leave 
the hull on the cob. This is better and easier than to 
shave or grate off the kernels. To one pint of corn pulp 
add two well-beaten eggs., half a teaspoonful of salt^ half 
a saltspoonfid oi pepjper., and two tahlespoonfuls of flour .^ 
or just enough to keep the corn and egg together. Do 
not add milk, as then more flour will be required, and this 
destro3's the flavor of the corn. Fry in small cakes on a 
buttered griddle, and brown well on each side ; or add 
more flour, and drop by spoonfuls into deep fat. When 
highly seasoned with salt and pepper., these fritters have 
the flavor of 03'sters. Make in the same way with canned 
com, finely chopped. Add two tahlespoonfuls of milk., as 
the canned corn is less moist than the fresh. 

Succotash. — This may be made b}' mixing equal quan- 
tities of shelled beans and coryi cut from the cob, having 
first cooked and seasoned them separate!}'. Or cut the 
raw corn from the cob, by scoring each row and pressing 
the pulp out with the back of the knife, leaving the hulls 
on the cob, and when the beans are nearh' soft, add the 
corn, and cook fifteen minutes. Add crea^n, butter, salt, 
and sugar to taste. 

In winter, when the vegetables are drj' and hard, soak 
the corn and Lima beans over night. Put the beans on 
in cold water, changing it twice. As soon as it boils, add 
the corn, and cook slowly' several hours, or till soft. Sea- 
son with butter, sugar, and salt. Canned Lima beans and 
canned corn are also used. 



30J The Boston Cook Book, 

Corn, beans, and peas are delicious and wholesome sum- 
mer vegetables. Much of the prejudice against their use 
among children results from imperfect mastication, which 
renders them indigestible. Ever}' row of kernels should 
be cut with a sharp knife if the corn be served on the 
cob, and every pea or bean should be mashed with a fork 
to insure their perfect digestion. Thus eaten, these vege- 
tables are valuable food, and will cause no trouble. 

Tomatoes. 

Haw Tomatoes. — Scald and peel at least an hour be- 
fore using. Keep them on the ice, and serve with sugar ^ 
salt, vinegar, or with Mayonnaise dressing. If very 
large, they may be sliced before serving. 

Steiced Tomatoes. — Pour boiling water over them, 
remove the skins and the hard green stem. Cut them 
into quarters, and stew in a granite pan fifteen minutes, 
until the pulp is soft and the juice is partly boiled awa}'. 
Add salt, pepper, butter, and sugar if desired. The 
tomato ma}' be thickened with cracker crumbs or with 
cornstarch wet in a little cold w^ater. 

Scalloped Tomatoes. — Season one quart of tomatoes 
with one teaspoonful of salt, one scdtspoonfid oi p)epper, 
half a cup of sugar, and a few drops of onion juice. 
Butter a deep dish, and sprinkle with^^ie crumbs. Pour 
in the tomatoes. Moisten one cup of cracker crumbs with 
half a cup of m^elted butter. Spread over the top, and 
brown in the oven. Raw tomatoes sliced may be used in 
layers, alternating with crumbs and seasoning. 

Stuffed Tomatoes. — Cut a thin slice from the stem end 
of large, smooth tomatoes. Remove the seeds and soft 
pulp, and mix with the pulp an equal amount of buttered 
cracker crumbs. Season to taste with salt, pepper, sugar, 
and onion juice. Fill the cavit}' with the mixture, heap- 
ing it in the centre, and sprinkle buttered crumbs over the 
top. Place the tomatoes in a granite pan, and bake until 
^he crumbs are brown. Take them up carefully with a 



Onions. 301 



broad knife, and serve very hot. A small quantity of 
cooked meat finely chopped ma}' be used with the 
crumbs. 

Onions. 

Pour boiling water over them, and remove the skins. 
Put them in boihng salted water. When they have 
boiled five minutes, change the water, aHd change again 
after ten minutes. Boil half an hour, or until tender, but „.— . 
not until broken. Drain off the water, add milk enough/ - 
to cover, and cook five or ten minutes longer. Season 
with butter., salt., anH peppe?'. Serve plain or as a garnish '< *i] 
for beef. Or omit the seasoning, and pour ichite sauce 
over them. 

Haked or Scalloped Onions. — Boil, and if large cut 
into quarters. Put into a shallow dish, cover with ichite 
sauce and buttered crumbs^ and bake until the crumbs are 
brown. 

Onions are rich in flesh-forming elements, are soothing 
to the mucous membrane, and are otherwise medicinal- 
They impart an agreeable flavor to many kinds of food. 



Cauliflower. 

The leaves should be green and fresh, and the heads 
creamy white. When there are dark spots, the cauliflower 
is wilted. Pick off the outside leaves, soak in cold salted 
water, top downwards, for one hour, to cleanse it thor- 
oughly. Tie it in a twine bag, to prevent breaking. Cook 
in boiling salted water fifteen or twcnt}' minutes, or until 
tender. If not boiled in a bag, remove the scum before 
it settles on the cauliflower. Serve in a shallow dish, and 
cover with a cream or Ilollandaise sauce. Or add a little 
grated cheese., and cover with cracker crumbs moistened 
in melted butter^ and bake until the crumbs are brown. 
Or when cold, serve as a salad w\\h Mayonnaise dressing. 
Cauliflower ma}' be cut in small pieces, and served as a 
garnish around broiled chicken or sweetbreads. 



302 The Boston Cook Book. 



Cabbage. 

Select a small heav}^ cabbage. Remove the outside 
leaves, cut into quarters, cut off the tough stalk, soak iu 
cold salted water half an hour. Cook till tender in boil- 
ing salted water, changing the water twice. Drain, cut 
or chop fine, season with salt and huttei\ or cover with 
white sauce and buttered crumbs^ and bake till the crumbs 
are brown. 

The cauliflower and cabbage contain more gluten, and 
are therefore more nutritious, than any other vegetable 
food. They should be eaten with fat and oil}' food, and 
require an acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, as a condi- 
ment. Cabbage is considered indigestible, and many boil 
with it a small piece of red pepper to counteract this 
effect. If the water in which cabbage is boiled be changed 
two or three times, less of the strong odor and flavor is 
retained. With proper treatment this vegetable ma}' be 
served as temptingly as any other. It is more wholesome 
when served in its raw state as a salad than when cooked. 

Celery. 

Scrape clean, and cut the stalks into inch pieces ; cook 
in boiling salted water half an hour, or until tender.- 
Drain and mix with a lohite sauce ; or dip them m fritter 
batter^ and fry in \\ot fat. Celery is usually eaten raw, as 
a salad, but is more digestible when cooked. Celery is 
particularly good for nervous or rheumatic people. 

Egg Plant. 

Cut the plant into slices one third of an inch thick, with- 
out removing the skin. Sprinkle salt over each slice, pile 
them, and cover with a weight to press out the juice. Drain, 
and dip each slice first \nfine crumbs^ then in beaten egg^ 
and again in crumbs., and saute them in hot fat. Egg 
plants belong to the same family as the potato and tobacco, 
all of which contain a bitter juice, more or less poisonous. 



Mushrooms. 303 



Egg Plant Fritters. {Adaline Miller.) — Put the egg 
plant whole into boiling salted water, mixed with 07ie 
tahlespoonful of vinegar or lemon juice ; cook twenty 
minutes or until tender ; mash and drain. To 07ie pint of 
egg plant add half a cup oi flour ^ two eggs., well beaten, 
and salt and pepper to taste. Frj^ in small cakes in hot 
fat., browning well on both sides. 

Artichokes. 

The Jerusaleyn Artichoke is a tuber, something like the 
potato ; but as it contains no starch, it is not meal}'. Peel 
and throw at once into cold water and vinegar to preserve 
the color. Cook in boiling salted water until tender, watch 
closel}', and take them out as they become soft, for if left 
in longer the}' will harden again. Serve with a white sauce. 
Jerusalem artichokes may be used as a salad, or they maj^ 
be pickled. 

Globe Artichokes. — These are thick, flesh^'-petalled 
flowers which grow on a plant that resembles the thistle. 
The thickened receptacle and scales of the involucre form 
the edible portion. Soak the artichokes, cut off the out- 
side leaves, trim awa}' the lower leaves and the ends of 
the others. Cook in boiling salted water, with the tops 
downward, half an hour, or until the leaves can be drawn 
out. Drain, remove the choke, and serve with draion 
butter. 

Mushrooms. 

Peel the top and stalk, break in small pieces, place 
them in a stewpan, sprinkle slightly with salt s^n^ pepper, 
and let them stand half an hour, until the juice is drawn 
out. Stew the mushrooms in the juice and a little butter 
until tender, add cream to cover, and when the cream is 
hot serve on toast. Mushrooms are considered difficult of 
digestion. They are a fungous growth, and have a woody 
odor and a meaty flavor. The}' are used largel}' in sauces. 
Unless familiar with the difference between the edible and 
the poisonous mushrooms, it is safer to use the canned 
mushrooms, or tc obtain the fresh at a reliable market. 



304 The Boston Cook Book. 

The eatable mushroom first appears ver3^ small, and of 
a round button shape, on a short underground stalk. At 
this stage it is all white. It grows rapidly', and soon the 
skin breaks around the base of the button, which there 
spreads like an umbrella, and shows underneath a fringed 
fur of a fine salmon-color, which changes to a chocolate 
and then to a dark brown color, when the mushrooms have 
attained some size. They are in perfection before the last 
change. The skin should peel easily-. Those with j^ellow 
or white fur, and which grow in low, damp shady places, 
should be avoided. The good mushrooms spring up in 
open sunny fields in August and September. Do not trust 
to any written description, but search the fields with some 
one who can unerringly distinguish them. 

The common puff-ball, when white and hard, though not 
so delicate as the mushroom, makes a palatable dish. It 
should be peeled with a silver knife, cut in slices half an 
inch thick, dipped in crumbs and egg, or in a batter, and 
fried. Serve at once. 

Winter Squash. 

If the shell be soft, pare the squash, remove the seeds, 
and steam or cook in boiling salted water. It the shell be 
hard, split the squash, remove the seeds, an^ steam or 
boil until soft. Scrape out the soft part from the shell, 
mash, and season to taste. A pint of squash needsi one 
tablespoonful of butter, a few grains of pepper, half 
a teaspoonful of sugar, and salt to taste. Squash 
may be baked in the shell, then mashed, and seasoned as 
above. 

Summer Squashes are good only when young, fresh, 
and tender. Wash, and cut into quarters or small pieces. 
The skin and seeds need not be removed. Cook in boilins: 
salted water twenty minutes, or until tender. Place the 
squash in a strainer cloth, mash it thoroughly, squeeze the 
cloth until the squasn is dr}'. Add a little ci^eayn or butter, 
salt and pepjoer, and heat again before serv'ing. 



Parsnips. 305 



Carrots and Turnips. 

Carrots and turnips contain, instead of starch, a gelati- 
nous gummy substance, called pectine. They are useful 
in soups, giving them a fine flavor and color. Soups in 
which carrots are used are gelatinous when cold. Carrots 
are not a favorite vegetable for the table ; but if 3'oung 
and tender, they are palatable when boiled, and served in 
a white sauce. The}' should be washed and scraped (not 
pared) before boiling. Old carrots are sometimes boiled, 
and served with corned beef and salt fish. Their rich 
color makes them eff'ective as a garnish. The red, outside 
part is considered the best, as the inside is stringy. 

Turnips contain but little nutriment. They are very 
water>', and having no starch are agreeable food to be 
eaten with potatoes. They contain no salt, and therefore 
need more than other vegetables. Being wholly deficient 
in starch and fat, the}' are good with fat meat, corned beef, 
roast pork, and mutton. 

Tw)iij?s in White Sauce. — Wash and cut French tur- 
nips into half or three-quarter inch slices ; pare and cut 
each slice into strips, and then into cubes. Boil in boiling 
salted water until tender. Drain and pour white saucf 
over them. Turnips ma}' also be mashed, drained, and 
seasoned with butter, pej^j^er, and salt. 

Parsnips. 

Parsnips contain starch and sugar, a small portion o' 
gluten, and less water than carrots or turnips. They are 
eaten with salt fish and corned beef Those which have 
remained in the ground tlu'ough the winter are considered 
the best. They should be washed and scrubbed thor- 
oughly, but are more easily peeled after boihng. Cut 
them into half-inch cubes, and serve in tchite sauce. 

Pars7iip Fritters. — After boiling the parsnips, plunge 
them into cold water and the skins will slip off easily, 
mash them,' and season to taste with butter, salt., and 
pepper. Flour the hands, and shape the mashed parsnip 

1 Parsnips are more digestible if mashed and rubbed through a puree 
sieve to remove the woody fibre.

■ — y __ — ___ — ■ 

into small, flat oval cakes. Roll them in flour, aud ff}' 
them in butter until brown ; or dip them in 7nolasses, and 
then fry. 

Salsify, or Oyster Plant. 

Scrape, and throw at once into cold water, wdth a little 
vinegar in it to keep them from turning black. Cook in 
boiling salted water one hour, or until tender. Drain, 
mash, and season, and fry like parsnip fritters ; or cut 
into inch lengths, and mix with a ic/iite sauce; or dip the 
pieces \i\ fritter hatter^ and fry in hoty*a^. 

Beets. 

Wash, but do not cut them, as that destro^'s the sweet- 
ness and color. Cook in boiling water until tender. Young 
beets wnll cook in one hour, old beets require a longer 
time ; and if tough, wilted, or stringy, thej will never boil 
tender. When cooked, put them in a pan of cold water, 
and rub oflT the skin. Young beets are cut in slices, and 
served hot with butter^ salt, and x>epper, or cut in small 
cubes and served in a xohite sauce. The}^ are often pickled 
in vinegar, spiced or plain, and served cold ; or they may 
be cut into dice, and mixed with other vegetables for a 
salad. 

Rice. 

Rice should be thoroughl}' washed. Turn the rice into 
a coarse strainer, and place the strainer in a deep dish of 
cold water. Rub the rice, and lift it in the strainer out of 
the water, changing the water till it is clear. It is impor- 
tant to observe all the steps of this process, for in this 
wa}' all the grit is deposited in the water, leaving the rice 
thoroughly cleansed. Drain, and cook in either of the 
following ways, each of which, if followed carefully, will 
insure white, distinct kernels of thoroughl}' cooked rice. 

Boiled Bice. — Have tioo quarts of water with 07ie table- 
spoonful of salt boiling rapidly in an uncovered kettle. 
Throw in 07ie cup of icell'ioashed rice, and le^ it boil so 
fast that the kernels fairly dance in the water. Skim care- 



Rice. 307 

fully, and stir with a fork, never with a spoon, as that 
mashes the kernels. Cook twelve, fifteen, or twenty min- 
utes, according to the age of the rice, and add more boihng 
water if needed. Test the grains often, and the moment 
the}' are soft, and before the starch begins to dissolve and 
cloud the water, pour into a squash strainer. Drain, and 
place the rice — still in the strainer — in a pan in the hot 
closet or on the back of the stove. Stir it before serving, 
to let the steam escape and the kernels become ^vy. Be 
careful not to cook the rice enough to burst the grains, 
as then nothing can prevent them from sticking together. 

Steamed Bice. — Pour tioo cups of boiling loater on one 
cup of well-washed rice ; add half a teaspoonful of salt. 
Cook in the double boiler thirt}' minutes, or till soft. Re- 
move the cover, stir with a fork to let the steam escape, 
and dr}' off the rice. Rice will usually absorb twice its 
bulk of water ; but when cooked in milk or stock a little 
more moisture will be required. 

Some of the nitrogenous and mineral constituents, of 
which rice has but a small amount, are lost in the boiling 
water, and unless the water be used for soup, to boil rice 
is a wasteful process. Steaming is a much easier method, 
and is more economical. Man}' dishes may be prepared 
from combinations of rice and various seasoning materials. 

Savory Hice. — Steam one scant cup of rice and tioo 
cups of rich ichite or broion stock highly seasoned with 
salt, cayenne, cliopped parsley, and ground herbs. Stir 
in one tablespoonful of butter with a fork, just before 
serving. 

iVb. 2. — Fr}' one tablespoonful of chopped onio7i in 
one heaping tcdjlespoonful of butter until 3'ellow ; add 
one scant cup of uncooked rice, and stir until slightly 
colored ; then add one pint of chicken stock, and pour 
all into the double boiler, and steam thirty minutes. 

Scdmon Bice. — Use hcdf stock and hcdf strained toma- 
toes ; season highly with curry, and cook like Savory Rice. 

Bice with Cheese. — Steam the rice after either of the 
preceding receipts, and put it in a shallow dish in layers, 



3o8 Tlie Boston Cook Book. 

alternating with gyrated cheese and tomato sauce ^ or with 
sUces of hard-boiled eggs and thin cream sauce. Heat in 
the oven with or without a crust of buttered crumbs. 

Macaroni, Spaghetti, and Vermicelli. 

These are thick pastes made from wheaten flour mixed 
with a small quantity' of water. Thej are made to take 
various shapes by being forced through holes in metallic 
plates. These plates are arranged over a fire ; and the 
macaroni, as it issues from the holes, is partially baked, 
and afterward hung to dry over rods. Vermicelli is used 
in soup and puddings ; macaroni and spaghetti as vege- 
tables. 

Macaroni is a nutritious and economical food, and should 
be used more extensivel}' than it is. Do not wash it, as 
the boiling water will better take off an3'thing that needs 
to be removed. Alwaj's cook it in boiling salted water 
until tender, before serving it in any way. Drain, and 
pour cold water over it to keep it from becoming pasty. 
Macaroni, as frequently' prepared, in long pieces, which 
utterly refuse to come out of the dish in a proper manner 
when served, is not attractive. Nor is it palatable when 
it is onl}^ slightlj' seasoned, and is dried in the oven with- 
out a covering of sauce or crumbs. 

Macaroni. — Break one quarter of a pound of maca- 
roni in three-inch pieces, and put into three pipits of boil- 
ing salted icater. Boil twent}' minutes, or until soft. 
Drain in a colander, and pour cold water through it to 
cleanse and keep it from sticking. Cut into inch pieces. 
La}' the strips on a board, parallel to each other, and cut 
through them all at once. Put in a shallow baking-dish 
and cover with a white sauce, made with a cup and a hcd-f 
of hot milk., one tablespoonful of butter, and one table- 
spoonfid of flour, cooked according to directions for White 
Sauce (see page 189). A(\6. half a teaspoonful of salt. 
Mix two thirds of a cup oifine cracker crumbs with a third 
of a cup of melted butter, and sprinkle over the top. Bake 
till the crumbs are brown. 



Macaroni. 309 



If cheese be liked with it, use half a cup of grated Par- 
mesan or an}' other diy cheese. Put part of it with the 
macaroni, and mix the remainder with the crumbs. 

No. 2. — Mix two hard-boiled eggs., chopped fine, with 
the macaroni. Sprinkle each layer with salt and pepper^ 
and add a little made mustard., if 30U wish. Cover with 
7nilk and buttered crumbs., and bake until the crumbs are 
brown. 

iVb. 3. — Pour a rich white sauce over the macaroni^ 
and serve grated cheese on a separate dish. 

Macaroon and Tomatoes. — Boil as above, and cover 
with tomato sauce. Yvy one tablespoonful of chopped 
onion in one tablespoonfid of butter. Add one large table- 
spoonfid of flour \ when well mixed, add gradually a (pj^ 
and a hcdf of strained tomato and half a teaspoonfu\ of 
scdt. Pour over the macaroni, and warm in the oven ; or 
cover with buttered crumbs., and bake until the crumbs are 
brown. 

Spaghetti. — This is a variety of macaroni about one 
eighth of an inch in diameter. It is usually served un- 
broken. Take a handful of the long sticks, plunge the 
ends into rapidly boiling salted water. As they soften, 
bend and coil the spaghetti in the water, without breaking 
it, until it is all softened. Boil until tender. Drain, pour 
cold water through it, and serve without cutting, if you are 
skilled in the art of winding it around your fork, as the 
Italians do. Serve the same as macaroni, with cream or 
tomato sauce., cheese., and crumbs. 



Salads. 

Green vegetables which are eaten raw and dressed 
with oil, acids, salt, and pepper, are classed as salads. 
Potatoes, string beans, beets, asparagus, cauliflower, and 
many other vegetables which have been cooked, are eaten 
cold with a salad dressing. Lobster, oysters, salmon, and 
other kinds of cooked fish, eggs, chicken, and delicate 
meats are combined with lettuce, cresses, or celery, and

salad dressing, and furnish man}' appetizing and refreshing 
varieties of this useful form of food. 

There is a strong prejudice with many against the use 
of oil. It is not strange when we remember the rancid 
oil sometimes offered us. Pure olive oil is seldom to be 
obtained, if we are to believe all that the opposers of adul- 
teration assert. No doubt much that is sold as olive oil 
is made from cotton seed ; but if it were sold under its 
right name and at a reasonable price there would be no 
objection to its use. When properly purified, and sweet, 
it ma}^ be as wholesome as ohve oil. The}^ are both veg- 
etable oils, which are alwaj'S considered more nutritious 
than animal oils. Oil is one of the best forms of fat we 
can use, and aids in digestion. Oil, when taken onty in 
lobster salad or at late suppers, as is often the case, is 
held accountable for the horrors and torment following 
such a use ; but if used seasonably and moderateh', there 
will be no ill effects. 



French Dressing. 



1 saltspoonful salt. 

% saltspoonful pepper. 

3 tablespoonf uls oil. 



^ teaspoonf ul onion juice. 
1 tablespoonful vinegar. 



Mix in the order given, adding oil slowl}'. 

This dressing is suitable for vegetable and Qgg salads, 
and is also used to marinate, or pickle, a meat or fish salad. 
The onion ma}' be omitted, and lemon juice may be used 
instead of vinegar. A teaspooiiful of made m^ustard 
added to a French dressing is liked by man}-. 



Boiled Dressing. 



Yolks of 3 eggs beaten. 

1 teaspoonful mustard. 

2 teaspoonfuls salt. 

3^ saltspoonful cayenne. 
2 tablespoonfuls sugar. 



2 tablespoonfuls melted buttei 

or oil. 
1 cup cream or milk. 
I/O cup hot vinegar. 
Whites of 3 eggs, beaten stiff. 



Cook in the double boiler until it thickens like soft cus- 
tard. Stii- well. This will keep in a cool place two weeks,

and is excellent for lettuce, celer}', asparagus, string beans, 
and cauliflower. 

Boiled Dressing for Cold Slaw. — Boil half a cup of 
vinegar with tioo teasjyoonfuls of sugar, half a teaspoon- 
fid each of salt and mustard, and half a saltspoonful 
^i pepper. Rub a quarter of a cup of butter to a cream, 
with one teaspoonful oi flour, and pour the boiling vinegar 
on it. Cook five minutes, then pour it over one mell-heaten 
egg. The yolk only may be used, and the white saved for 
clearing coffee. Mix this dressing, while hot, with one 
pint of red cabbage, shaved or chopped, or with a mixed 
vegetable salad. Cold slaw is delicious served with fried 
'Oysters or fish. 



Mayonnaise Dressing. 



1 teaspoonful mustard. 

1 teaspoonful powdered sugar. 

y2. teaspoonful salt. 

^ saltspoonful cayenne. 



Yolks of 2 raw eggs. 

1 pint olive oil. 

2 tablespoonfuls vinegar. 

2 tablespoonfuls lemon juice 




Mix the first four ingredients in a small bowl. Add the 
eggs. Stir well with a small wooden spoon. Add the oil, 
a few drops at a time, stirring until it thickens. If b}' 
chance you add too much oil, do not attempt to stir it 
all in at once, but take it up graduall}'. AVhen the dress- 
ing is thick, thin it with a little lemon, then add ofl and 
lemon alternately, and lastly the vinegar. When ready to 
serve, acid half a cup of v:hipp)ed cream, if 30U like. The 
cream makes it whiter and thinner. The oil should 
thicken the ogg almost immediately, and the mixture 
should be thick enough to be taken up in a ball on 
the spoon, before adding the vinegar. Should the 
egg not thicken quickly, and have a curdled appearance, 
half a teaspoojiful of the unbeaten lohite of egg or a few 
drops of vinegar will often restore the smooth consistency. 
Be careful not to use too much, as it will make the dressing 
thin. The dressing liquefies as soon as mixed with vege- 
tables or meat ; therefore it should be made stiff enough 
to keep in shape until used. Many prefer to use a Dover

egg-beater, and others succeed best -with a fork. The 
mixture soon becomes too hard to use an egg-beater to 
advantage. Lobster coral, dried and pounded to a powder, 
will give a Mayonnaise a bright red color. Spinach green, 
green peas mashed, or chopped parsle}' will color it green. 
Never mix the Mayonnaise dressing with the meat or 
fish until read}' to serve, and then only part of it, and 
spread the remainder over the top. 

Mayonnaise Tartare is simpl}- the addition of chopped 
olives^ pickles, parsley, capers, and onions to the May- 
onnaise. 

Lettuce Salad. — Pick over and wash each leaf with- 
out breaking. Shake off the water and drain in a net. 
Keep the lettuce in a cool place until read}' to serve. 
Just before serving, dry between two towels. Arrange the 
leaves in a salad bowl, the larger leaves around the edge 
and the light ones in the centre. Serve with boiled dress- 
ing, or French dressing, or sugar, salt, and vinegar to 
taste. Lettuce should be served cool, fresh, and crisp. 
Never cut it, as that causes the leaves to wilt quicklj-. 
Tear them apart. 

Radishes or olives may be served with lettuce ; and 
when a brilliant effect is desired, garnish with a few nas- 
turtium blossoms. When lettuce is used with other mate- 
rials* never mix them until read}' to serve. 

Dressed Celery. — Use only the white, crisp part of the 
celery stalks. The green parts may be made into a puree 
or used in soups. Scrape off the brown discolored part, 
and wash thoroughly. Keep in cold water, and when 
ready to serve, drain and arrange in aceler}- glass. Serve 
with salt. Or cut the celery in thin slices, moisten with 
French or Mayonnaise dressing, and garnish with lettuce, 
cresses, or celery leaves. Lettuce and celery may be 
served with the roast if desired. 

Cucumber Salad. — Cut off an inch from each end of 
the cucumber, and pare off a thick paring, as a bitter juice 
lies near the skin. Cut in thin slices, or shave with a 
vegetable cutter. Keep in cold water until ready to serve. 



Salads. 3 1 3 



Drain, and place in the bowl with ice. Serve with salt., 
peppei', and vinegar., or with a French dressing. Young 
onions thinl}- sliced are sometimes mixed with cucumbers. 

Cucumber and Tomato Salad. — Place a bed of crisp 
lettuce in a salad dish, then a layer of sliced cucumbers., 
then sliced toynatoes^ and pour a French dressing., or a 
Mayonnaise^ over the whole. Tomatoes peeled and cut 
into halves, and served with a spoonful of Mayonnaise 
on each half, make an attractive salad. 

Potato Salad. — One pint of cold boiled potatoes., cut 
in half-inch dice or shaved in thin slices, and seasoned v^ 
with salt and pepper ; the yolk of one hard-boiled egg., \- 
one heaping tahlespooyiful of chopped parsley ^ half a cup^ 
of cold beet dice., and a French dressing. Put alternate 
layers of potato, beet, yolk of 0^%^., rubbed through a 
fine strainer, parsley, and French dressing, until the 
materials are all used. Have parsle}' and egg on the 
top, and leave half of the dressing for the last la3'er. 
Or arrange the potatoes, parsley, and ^gg in the centre 
of the dish, then a circle of beets and lettuce around the 
edge, with French dressing sprinkled over the whole. 
Shced onions., red cabbage chopped, capers., dice of 
turnips^ and carrots cut into fancy shapes or rubbed 
through a strainer, may be used with potatoes for a 
salad. 

N'o. 2. — One pint of hot potatoes^ mashed or cut in 
slices, half a cup of chopped cabbage^ half a cup of 
chopped celery^ one tablespoonful of chopped parsley., 
one cucumber pickle., and one hard-boiled egg., chopped 
fine. Mix well, and add enough of Boiled Dressing 
No. 2 to moisten. Keep on the ice until ready to serve. 
Place two tablespoon fids on a leaf of lettuce., and serve 
in the leaf. 

Many professional cooks prefer to mix a potato salad 
while the potatoes are hot, as the salad looks more 
appetizing, will keep longer, and have less of the soggy 
peculiar taste than when made with cold potatoes. 
Rubbing a cut onion or a little garlic round the salad

bowl is sufficient where only a slight flavor of onion is 
desired. Vegetable salads are suitable for lunch or tea, 
or may be served as a course at dinner. 

Egg Salad. — Boil six eggs twentj^ minutes. Cut the 
whites in thin slices, or chop them ver}^ fine. Arrange 
a bed of cresses on a dish. Make nests of the whites, 
and put one whole yolk in tlie centre of each nest ; or rub 
the yolks through a fine strainer over the whites. Sprinkle 
a French dressing over the whole. Serve small balls of 
cottage cheese with the salad. 

Oyster Salad. — Steam or parboil one pint of oysters. 
Drain, cool, and marinate them with a French dressing. 
Serve with cresses^ celery^ or lettuce^ and a Ma3'onnaise 
dressing. 

Fish Salad. — One quart of an}- kind of cold cooked 
fish^ flaked and freed from bones and skin, and placed on 
a bed of lettuce. Pound the yolks of three hard-boiled 
eggs., and three sardines (bones and skin removed) to a 
smooth paste. Mix this paste with the Boiled or the 
Mayonnaise dressing^ and pour it over the fish. Gar- 
nish with slices of lemon. 

Chicken Salad. — One pint each of cold boiled or 
roasted chicken and celery^ or half as much celery as

chicken. Cut the chicken into quarter-inch dice. Scrape, 
wasli, and cut the celery in dice. Mix and marinate with 
a French dressing, and keep on the ice until ready to 
serve. Make a Mayonnaise dressing, and mix part of it 
with the chicken ; arrange the salad in a dish, pour the 
remainder of the dressing over it, and garnish with celery

PASTRY AND PIES. 

Puff Paste, when skilfully made, is light and tender, 
and so delicate that it cannot be touched without crushing. 
It should be thoroughl}^ baked, and is therefore more suit- 
able for tarts and patties and the upper crust of pies. Eat 
it sparingly ; unless you have a good digestion, and exer- 
cise freel}', never eat it. It is, however, less injurious 
than the ordinary pastr}- seen on many tables, as it con- 
tains no more shortening than much of the pastrj^ made 
with a "guess measure" of lard. It is not so much the 
amount of fat the paste contains that makes it indigestible, 
as the inferior quality of the fat, such as rancid butter or 
impure lard, or the sogg}', greas}', half-cooked paste. 

Pastrj' that is light, dr}^, and flaky is more easil}' sepa- 
rated by the gastric fluids than that which is heavy. Many 
housekeepers use lard in making pastry, as it is cheaper 
than butter, and makes a softer and more tender crust. 
Butter is more wholesome, and is preferable if 3'ou wish to 
make a brown crust. A mixture of half lard and half 
butter answers very well for common paste, but for puff 
paste butter alone should be used. In French receipts for 
pufl" paste eggs are considered essential, but there is no 
necessity' for their use. 

It requires practice to make pufl" paste well ; and as 
there are so many other dishes more easily made and 
vastly more important, it is better not to waste time 
and strength upon it. Let your ambition as a house- 
keeper soar higher than perfection in making puff" paste. 
But those who will have it may observe the following 
directions. 

Puff Paste.— One pound of the best butter, one pound 
of pastry flour, one scant teaspoonful of salt, about one 



Puff Paste. 317 

cup of ice water. By measure, use one quart o^ flour and 
one pint of butter. Scald the bowl, then fill with cold 
water. Dip the hands into hot and then into cold water ; 
this makes bowl and hands smooth, and keeps the butter 
from sticking. Wash the butter, by working it in the cold 
water, till soft and wax3\ Divide into four parts ; pat 
each part into a long and narrow piece, and wrap in a 
clean napkin. 

Have three shallow oblong pans that will fit the one into 
the other. Fill tlie largest and smallest of the pans with 
broken ice. Put the butter, covered with the napkin, into' 
the other, and place it between the two pans of ice to 
harden. Mix the salt with the flour, then break in one 
quarter of the butter. Rub with the tips of the fingers, 
and keep plent\' of flour between the fingers and the but- 
ter. Many prefer to chop it, that the warmth of the hand 
may not soften the butter. When the butter and flour 
are well mixed, and fine and dry like meal, pour in the cup 
of ice water slowly. Mix with a knife, and cut, rather 
than stir. Wet onh' part of the flour at first and toss it 
to one side of the bowl, then wet another part ; and when 
it is all of the proper consistenc}', cut and mix it together 
till it can be taken up clean from the bowl with the knife. 
Add the last of the water cautiousl}', wetting only the dry 
flour, and use less or more than the cupful as the flour 
may require. If the butter be softened by the heat in 
rubbing, it will moisten the flour, and less water will be 
required. But it should not be allowed to soften. The 
mixture should be light and dr^-, like separate minute 
crumbs of butter coated with flour. 

Use a large smooth rolling-board and a glass rolling- 
pin. Put half a cup of flour in the dredger, and sprinkle 
the middle of the board with a liglit coating of flour. Toss 
the ball of paste in the flour with a knife until floured all 
over, then pat with the rolling-pin into a flat cake an inch 
thick. Have the end of the board next you, that 3'ou may 
roll the paste the required length. Hold the handles of 
the pin firmly, and roll with a light quick stroke as far as 



3i8 The Boston Cook Book. 

your arms will allow, — the whole length of the paste, if 
possible, at every stroke. Do not attempt to roll the paste 
when it is in a ball or a cubical form, but pat it lighth^, to 
make as large and flat a surface as possible before rolling. 
Roll out to the thickness of one third of an inch, and to a 
rectangular form. La}^ one of the quarters of butter in a 
little flour on the corner of the board, and roll quickl}- into 
a long thin piece ; scrape it up with a knife, and la}' along 
the middle of the whole length of the paste. Fold over 
one side of the paste, then the other, letting the edges just 
meet in the middle of the butter. Do not pat it doion. 
Then fold each end to the middle and double again. Pound 
into a flat cake and roll again one quarter of an inch thick. 
Roll another piece of butter thin, lay it on the paste, fold 
the sides over, then the ends over, and then together, and 
repeat the process with the remaining pieces of butter. 
When the butter is all rolled in, the paste may be folded, 
patted, and rolled out, two, three, or seven times, as your 
strength will permit. Twice is enough for pies, three or 
four times for patties ; but more are needed for a vol-au- 
vent. 

When the butter is of the right texture, fine, smooth, 
and firm, not drj' and crumbly, and the mixing and rolling 
are done so quickly and deftly- that the butter does not 
soften, the paste will not stick, and ver}' little flour will be 
required in rolling. Do not strike a hard blow in rolhng, 
nor press the paste down to the board, but roll with a 
light gentle stroke. When the paste does not slip along the 
board, you may know it is sticking, and it must be lifted 
at once, the board scraped clean, and floured slightl3% 

Should the paste become soft and sticky, fold again, 
and pat it out to the size of the pan, and put it in the 
napkin between the two pans of ice. It will harden in ten 
minutes, and then may be rolled easily. After all the but- 
ter is in the dough, cut in two pieces, then roll and fold 
one, while the other is in the ice pan. Keep the board 
and pin wiped dry, and use only a little floui', but use 
enough to keep the paste from sticking. 



Patty Shells. 319 



Keep the edges even while rolUng, and fold evenl}', that 
there may be an equal number of layers in all parts. Each 
time the paste is folded over the butter a small amount of 
air is enclosed and is retained, unless the fold be patted 
down and allow the air to escape at the end. These bub- 
bles of air may be plainly seen when the ball of dough is 
patted and rolled out, and care must be taken not to let 
the air escape. For this reason roll llgJuhj and always 
from yoii^ as a hard motion back and forth is more lia])le 
to break the bubbles. Roll with a fan-like sweep, a little 
to the right and left, to widen it and keep the rectangular 
shape ; then roll genth' on the edge nearest 3'ou, to make 
it of uniform X\ jkness. The more of the bubbles 3'ou can 
retain in the paste, the lighter and more puffy it will be. 
The number of folds or la3^ers of butter and paste makes 
the paste flak}', but the amount of air in it makes it rise 
and puff in baking. 

The paste should be folded and rolled till no streaks of 
butter can be seen. After the last rolling, place it on the 
ice to harden, as it ma}' then be cut and shaped more 
easil}'. 

To Bale Puff Paste. — The dough should be icy cold 
when it is put into the oven. If the patties soften after 
being shaped, place them between the pans of ice till they 
are hard. The oven should be about as hot as for rolls, 
with the heat greater underneath, that the paste may rise 
nearl}' to its full height before browning ; then quicken the 
fire to brown the tops, and turn the heat from underneath 
or put a pan or grate under to prevent burning. If the 
oven be too hot, the paste will burn before it is risen ; if 
too slow, it will melt and spread. 



Patty SheUs, Tarts, Vol-au-vents, and other Forms of 
Puff Paste. 

There are two wa3's of shaping the paste for patties 
and tarts. First, roll puff paste one eighth of an inch 
thick, and stamp out circular pieces with a cutter, two ;>nd 



320 The Boston Cook Book. 

one half inches in diameter. With a smaller cutter stamp 
out the centres from half of these pieces, leaving rings half 
an inch wide. Dip the cutters in hot water, and cut 
quickly, that the edges ma}' not be pressed together or 
cut unevenl}'. Rub a little white of egg on the top of 
the large rounds near the edge, put on the rings, and press 
them lightly to make them adhere, but be careful not to 
get any egg on the edges, as that will prevent them from 
rising. Put round pieces of stale bread, cut half an inch 
thick, in the centre, to keep the paste from rising and fill- 
ing the cavit}'. Bake on shallow pans lined with paper, 
and when done remove the bread and soft paste under- 
neath. Bake the small pieces cut from the centre on a 
pan b}' themselves, as the}' take less time for baking. In 
serving place them on the top of the shells for a cover. 

Another wa}^ is to roll the paste one fourth of an 
inch thick, cut with a round cutter, and then with the 
smaller cutter cut nearl}' through the centre of each round, 
making a rim half an inch wide. After baking remove the 
centre crust and soft part underneath, without breaking 
through, as then the shell will not hold any liquid mixture. 
Some persons prefer this method ; but there is less waste 
when cut in the first way, as the parts cut out may be 
baked for covers, and usuall}' prove to be the most delicate 
part of the paste. Or, if covers are not wanted, these cen- 
tres ma}^ be rolled out thinner, and used as bottom pieces. 

The paste for patties is usually rolled one fourth of an 
inch thick and cut with a plain cutter. Two or three rims 
may be put on when a deeper shell is desired. Any kind 
of delicate cooked meat or fish ( chicken, sweetbreads, 
oysters, lobster, etc.) ma}' be cut into small pieces, and 
warmed in a thick cream sauce (see page 278), and served 
hot in patty shells, with a cover of the paste. 

Tarts are made thinner, and cut with a fluted cutter. 
They are filled with jelly or preserves, and served cold 
without a cover. 

CupicVs Wells. — Cut the rounds of puff paste of three 
or four different sizes ; use the largest one for the bottom, 



Fancy Puff Paste. 321 



and cut the centres from the others, leaving the rims of 
different widths, and put them on the whole round, with 
the narrowest at the top. Bake, and fill with jell}'. 

Vol-aiC'Vent. — This is made from the lightest form of 
puff paste, cut to any size and shape desired, a large oval 
being generall}' preferred. Mark the outline with an oval 
mould or pan, and cut quickl}' with a knife dipped in hot 
water. Put on two or three rims, wetting the edge of each 
with white of egg. Make an oval hoop of stiff paper, two 
inches high, and slightlj' larger than the vol-au-vent, and 
place around i"- to prevent scorchmg. Bake a large vol- 
au-vent nearly an hour. 

Cakes a la Polonaise, — Ro' puff paste very thin, cut 
into pieces three inches square, wet tha centre, turn each 
corner over, press the point down in the centre, and put 
a very small round of paste on the centre. Bake, and 
when cool put dots of jelly on each corner. 







^ 



Fio. 42. Bow-Knots. 

BoW'Knotfi. — Cut thin puff paste into half-inch strips, 
and shape them on the baking-pan into the form of Q 
double bow-knot. When baked, put jelly on each loop 
of the bow. 

Rissoles, —Roll the scraps of puff paste thin, and cut 
into rounds. Put a spoonful of whatever material is to be 
used in the centre of half of the number, wet the edges, 
and cover with the remaining rounds, first cutting a cross 
in the middle, or stamping out a small piece with a vege- 
table cutter or pastry tube. Any kind of cold meat may 
be cut fine, seasoned to taste, moistened with a white 
sauce, and used in the rissoles. Or they may be filled 
with stewed and sweetened fruit, or mince meat prepared

as for pies. Thej' ma^' be cut into larger rounds, the 
filling placed on one half, and the edges folded together 
like turnovers. Bake in a hot oven. 

Plaits. — Roll very cold puff paste thin, and cut into 
half-inch strips. Braid them together, and bake quiekl}' . 

Cheese Straws. — Roll scraps of putf paste thin, 
sprinkle with grated cheese, and caj'enne pepper if 3'ou 
like, fold, roll out, and sprinkle again, and repeat the 

process. Then place on the 
ice to harden. When cold, 
roll into rectangular shape 
one eighth of an inch thick ; 
place it on a baking-pan, and 

^ Fig. 43. Cheese Straws. ^i^ll a pastrv CUtter dipped 

in hot water, cut into strips 
four or five inches long and less than a quarter of an inch 
wide. Bake, and serve piled cob-house fashion. Some- 
times, when the paste is ver}' hard, they are cut as narrow 
as possible, laid on the pan in groups of five or six, with 
one straw laid over the middle to represent a bundle of 
straws, and baked in that form. 

Pies. 
For Pies^ roll the puff paste out a quarter of an inch 
thick, then roll up, and cut from the end of the roll. Turn 
each piece on the side, so that the folds show in rings, and 
pat out flat, then roll to fit the plate. Keep the paste in a 
circular form, and roll evenl}' in every direction. Make 
slightly larger than the plate, as the paste shrinks when 
taken from the board, and should be fulled in rather than 
stretched to the required size. After a little practice it 
is just as easy *o judge of the amount of paste required for 
one crust, and roll it in this way to fit the plate, as to roll 
so large a quantity that the edges have to be trimmed off 
and mixed with the remainder of the paste. Roll some of 
the paste, and cut into strips three quartors of an inch wide ; 
wet the under crust and place the rim on the edge. Use 
one rim for pies which are to be covered, and two, if you 



Pla'ui Pastrij. 323 



like, for pies without an upper crust. Fill the plate with 
the material to be used. Roll the upper crust larger than 
the plate, make a cut in the centre to let the steam escape, 
wet the rims, put the crust on the edge even with the 
rim and slightly fuller in the centre, to allow for shrinking 
in baking ; otherwise the crust, as it is forced up by the 
steam within, will draw away from the edge. 

Wet every spot of the rim and edge, and press closely 
but lightly together, to keep the juices from boiling out. 
All pies, meat pies especially, with a top crust should have 
several holes cue in the crust to let the steam escape. 
All fruit pies are better flavored if made with fresh, rather 
than stewed, fruits. If to be filled with juic}' fruit, or 
cream, thej^ are more wholesome prepared as follows: 
Bake the two crusts separately, stew the fruit, fill, and put 
the two together. Or fill with a mock filling of pieces of 
clean cloth, bake, remove the cloth, and just before serving 
fill with the prepared fruit. 

Pies should bake from half to three quarters of an hour, 
or till hrovm. Use tin. plates, as pies bake better on the 
bottom in them. No greasing is needed, and the pies 
should be changed to earthen plates as soon as done. 

Pastry for One Pie, — One heaping cup of pastry 
flour, one saltspoonful of hahing-poicder, one saltspooii- 
ful of salt, and from 07ie third to one half of a cup of 
butter and lard mixed. Mix the baking-powder and salt 
with the flour, and rub in the lard. Mix quite stiff" with 
cold water. Roll out, put the butter on the paste in little 
pieces, and sprinkle with flour. Fold over, and roll out. 
Roll up like a jelly roll. Divide in two parts, and roll to 
6t the plate. 

Cream Paste. — Mix lialf a teaspoonful of salt and 
half a saltspooiiful of soda with one cup of cream, and 
stir in flour enough to mix to a stiff" paste. Roll half 
an inch thick. Cut half a cup of butter into small pieces, 
and put it on the paste. Sprinkle with flour, fold and roll 
out thin ; roil up. cut a piece from the end, and roll to fit 
the plate.

Plain Paste. {31rs. Tilton.^ — Beat the white of 
one egg with one tahlespoonful of lard. Work it into one 
quart of flour with the hauds, till fine as meal. Add 
about one cup of ice icater. Roll out, and put half a 
pound of butter on the paste in little pieces, either all at 
once or half of it at a time. Dredge lighth^ with flour. 
Fold the edges over, roll up, pat, and roll out. 

Lemon Pie^ JVo. 1. — Mix o?ie heaping tahlespoonful

molasses, and stir it into the dry mixture. Steam in a 
buttered pudding-mould three hours. Serve with foamy 
sauce. 

If water and butter be used, three cups of flour will be 
required, as these thicken less than milh and suet. This 
pudding is sometimes steamed in small stone cups. 

Cabinet Pudding. 

Butter a melon mould, and decorate it with candied 
fruity or with raisins boiled till soft and seeded ; then put 



340 The Boston Cook Book. 

in a la3'er of lady fingers or stale sponge cake^ then a 
few pieces of fruit, and repeat till the mould is nearl}^ full. 
Pour one pint of boiling milk into the yolks of three eggs^ 
beaten with three tahlespoonfuls of sugar and half a salt- 
spoonful of salt. Pour over the cake in the mould. Set 
the mould in a pan of warm water on the back of the stove 
half an hour, then bake one hour, keeping it in the pan of 
hot water. Or steam it one hour. Serve hot with wine 
or foamy sauce. 

Six macaroons or six cocoanut cakes may also be used, 
and the custard may be flavored w^ith wine. 

Christmas Plum Pudding. {Mrs. J. M. Towne.) 

One pint and a half of grated bread crumbs (soft, not 
dried), one pint of chopped suet, one pint and a half of 
currants and stoned raisins mixed, half a cup of citron 
shaved thin, one scant cup of sugar ^ half a teaspoonful 
of salt., half a teaspoonful of grated nuttneg, five eggs., 
two even tahlespoonfuls of flour ^ made into a thin batter 
with ??ii7A', and half a glass of brandy. Mix in the order 
given, and boil or steam four hours. Serve with yellow 
sauce. 

Thanksgiving Plum Pudding. {Mrs. S. M. Bailey.) 

Six butter crackers, rolled fine, and soaked in three 
pi7its of tnilk. Cream one quarter of a cup of butter with 
one cup of sugar ; add half a teaspoonful of salt., one 
teaspoonful of mixed spice., and six well-beaten eggs. Stir 
it all into the milk, and add one pound of the best raisins. 
Bake in a deep pudding-dish, well greased with cold 
butter. Bake ver}" slowly in a moderate oven three or 
four hours. Stir several times during the first hour, to 
keep the raisins from settling. Make half of this receipt 
and steam it in a pudding- mould. Butter the mould, and 
line it with macaroons. 



Blanc Mange. 341 



CUSTARDS, JELLIES, AND CREAMS. 



Irish Moss Blanc-Mange. 

3^ cup Irish moss. I 1 saltspoonful salt. • 

1 quart milk. 1 1 teaspoonf ul vanilla. 

Soak the moss in cold water fifteen minutes ; pick over, 
wash, tie in a lace bag, and put it into the double 
boiler with the milk. Boil until the milk thickens when 
dropped on a cool plate. Add the salt ; strain and flavor. 
Mould in small cups or in egg-shells. Break off a piece 
as large as a ten-cent piece on one end of the egg-shell, 
pour out the Qgg, rinse the shells, stand them upright in a 
pan of meal, and fill with the blanc-mange. Serve blanc- 
mange with sur/ar and cream^ also with apple or grape 
jelly ; or put half a peach or anj- candied fruit in the bot- 
tom of the cup before filling. 

Blanc-mange ma}' be made b}' using one tablespoon- 
fid of sea-moss farina. Stir it into the boiling milk, 
and cook twenty minutes. Or use three tahlespooifuls of 
Ileckef s farina in the same wa}'. Cornstarch and gela- 
tine are often used, but the}' are neither palatable nor 
nutritious without egois. 

Chocolate Piiddiyig. — Use the same proportion of moss 
and milk as in the preceding rule. Put one square of 
chocolate in a saucepan with tico tablespoon fids each of 
sugar and icater. Stir, and boil until smooth ; add a little 
of the milk, until thin enough to pour easily, then mix it 
well with the remainder of the milk. Add the moss, and 
boil till thick.

Danish Pudding, or Fruit Tapioca, 



^ cup pearl tapioca. 
\y^ pint boiling water. 
1 saltspoonful salt. 



^ cup sugar. 

^ tumbler currant jelly. 



Pick over and wash the tapioca. Put it inthe double 
boiler with the boiling water, and cook one hour, or till 
soft and transparent, stirring often. Add the salt, sugar, 
and currant jelly. Stir till the jelly is all dissolved. Pour 
into a glass dish, and keep on ice. Serve very cold with 
sugar and cream. Haifa cup of lemon juice ^ or any acid 
fruit syrup, or one cup of canned apricot, peachy or quince^ 
may be used instead of the jellj'. Or, in summer, use one 
pint of ripe berries^ or any stnall fruits^ adding more sugar 
as required. 

Fruit Pudding. — Cook one quart of 'inp)e berries or 
canned peaches or apricots with one pint of water ^ and 
sugar to taste, till the fruit is well scalded. Skun out the 
fruit into a dish for serving. Wet one scant cupful of 
fine granulated wheat flour in a little cold water, stir it 
into the boiling syrup ; cook ten minutes, and pour it over 
the fruit. Serve very cold with cream. 



Boiled Custard. 



1 pint milk. 

Yolks of 3 eggs. 

3 tablespoonf uls sugar. 



y^ saltspoonful salt 
J^ teaspoonf ul vanilla. 



Scald the milk. Beat the yolks, add the sugar and 
salt, and beat well. Pour the hot milk slowly into the 
eggs, and when well mixed pour all back into the double 
boiler, and stir constantly till smooth and thick like cream. 
Strain, and when cool add the flavoring. Do not stir the 
egg into the hot milk, as there is danger of curdling, and 
a part of the egg will be left in the bowl. Scalding the 
milk hastens the process, so that less stirring is required. 
When nearly thick enough, the foam on the top disappears, 
and the custard coats the spoon ; but the surest test is 



Custards. 343 



given b}' the sense of feeling. You are conscious that the 
custard is thicker by the way the spoon goes through it. 
Do not leave the custard an instant ; take it off as soon as 
it is smooth, as it will thicken in cooling, and curdles 
quickh^ if cooked a moment too long or if left in the boiler. 
Have a fine strainer placed in a bowl or pitcher before you 
begin to cook the custard, that you may strain it quickly. 

Boiled custard, when to be used as a sauce, should be 
thin enough to pour ; when to be served as a custard, it 
should be cooked a moment longer, to make it thicker. 

Four or even^we eggs to a pint of milk may be used 
when a rich custard is desired. But three are sufficient 
for nearl}' all purposes. 

Boiled custard is much smoother when only the yolks of 
the eggs are used. Man}' combinations may be made by 
adding the whites of the eggs after the custard is cold. 
Beat the whites stiti\ put them on a sieve, and cook over 
steam, or pour boiling water througli them. The water 
will cook and stiffen the egg, and when well drained it may 
be piled in rocky form on the custard. Or the white may 
be poached by dipping it b}' the spoonful into boiUng milk. 
Serve the custard in a large glass dish, and pile the white 
in a mass, or put spoonfuls of it here and there on the cus- 
tard, with bright-colored jelly on the white ; or serve in 
small glass custard cups with the white and jelly on the 
top. Or pour the custard over slices of sponge cake 
(soaked in wine, if 3'ou prefer), and cover with a me'ringue 
of the whites sweetened and flavored. Floating Island^ 
Flummery , Tipsy Pudding, and hosts of other dishes 
are onh' fancy names given to the different combinations 
of cake, boiled custard, and meringue. 

Any of the following ingredients may be used as flavor- 
ing ; this will give a variety of dishes, which want of space 
prevents us from giving as separate receipts : half a square 
of chocolate, melted ; the three tahlespoonfuls of sugar 
melted to a caramel before mixing with the 3'olks ; one cup 
of grated cocoanut^ or cocoanut cakes crumbled ; six maC' 
aroons soaked in icine; one cup of chopped almonds or

an}' of the varieties of candied fniits; four oranges^ 
peeled, seeded, and cut fine ; one pint of any canned fruit ; 
one pint of lemon ^ wine^ or orange jelly ^ cut in cubes. 
Or color the meringue j92>?/^ by beating three tablespoon- 
fuls of bright-colored jelly with the whites ; or brown it 
with a salamander or hot poker, or by putting the dish 
on a board in the oven. 

Baked or Steamed Custard. 

1 quart miik. i 6 tablespoonfuls sugar. 

6 eggs. I 1 sahspoonf ul salt. 

Scald the milk. Beat the eggs ; add the sugar and salt, 
then the scalded milk. Strain, add a little nutmeg, and 
bake about twent}' minutes in a deep dish or in cups set 
in a pan of warm w^ater ; or steam in a bowl or in cups. 
Test the custard with a spoon ; if it come out clean, the 
custard is done. 



Caramel Custard. 



% cup sugar. 

2 tablespoonfuls water. 

1 quart milk. 



6 eggs. 

fo teaspoonful salt. 

1 teaspoonful vanilla. 



Put the sugar in an omelet pan, and stir until it melts 
and is light brown ; add the water, and stir into the warm 
milk. Beat the eggs slight!}', add the salt and vanilla and 
part of the milk. Strain into the remainder of the milk, 
and pour into a buttered two-quart mould. Set the mould 
in a pan of warm water, and bake thirty to fort}' minutes, 
or till firm. Cut into the middle with a knife ; if it come 
out clean, the custard is done. Serve cold with caramel 
sauce. 

Delicate Pudding. 

fo saltspoonful salt. 
Sugar to taste. 
3 eggs. 



1 cup water. 

1 cup fruit juice. 

3 tablespoonfuls cornstarch. 



Boil the water and fruit juice (orange, lemon, or canned 
cherries, quince, or apricot). Wet the cornstarch in a little

cold water ^ stir into the boiling syrup, and cook ten min- 
utes. Add the salt and sugar to taste ; the quantity de- 
pending upou the fruit. Beat the whites of the eggs till 
foam}", and stir into the starch. Turn at once into a 
mould. Serve cold with a boiled custard sauce made with 
the 3'olks of the eggs. 

Apple Snow. 



3 large tart apples. 

3 eggs (whites). I )^ cup jelly. 

Stew or steam the apples (cored and quartered, but not 
pared), drain, and then rub them through a hair sieve. 
Beat the whites of the eggs stiff, add the sugar, beat again ; 
add the apple, and beat till like snow. Pile lightl}^ in a 
glass dish, garnish with jellj' or holly leaves. Serve with 
boiled custard. 

Tapioca Cream. 




2 tablespoonfuls pearl tapioca. 
1 pint milk. 
Yolks of 2 eggs. 
% cup sugar. 



}4 saltspoonful salt. 

Whites of 2 eggs. 

% teaspoonf ul vanilla. 



Soak the tapioca in hot icater enough to cover it, in the 
top of the double boiler placed on the back of the stove. 
When the water is absorbed, add the milk, and cook until 
the tapioca is soft and transparent. Beat the yolks of the 
eggs, add the sugar and salt. Pour the boiling mixture on 
them, and cook tw^o or three minutes, or till it thickens like 
boiled custard. Remove from the fire, add the whites of 
the eggs, beaten to a foam. Stir well, and when cool 
flavor. Do not try to mould it, as it is more delicate when 
soft. 

Jellies and Fancy Dishes made with Gelatine, Custard, 
and Cream. 

Gelatine, as now obtained, is refined and clarified during 
the process of manufacti^re, and this renders it unnecessary 
to use the white of ag^ in making jellies, as was required 



346 The Boston Cook Booh. 

when using the old preparation of isinglass and gelatine. 
Much of the strength and flavor of jellies is lost in clearing 
them with eggs. Cox's gelatine makes a clear jelly, but it 
softens slowly and requires a strong flavoring like wine 
or lemon to disguise the fishy taste. Nelson's English 
gelatine is of fine qualit}^, softens quickly, has an agree- 
able flavor, and is well adapted to creams and other 
delicate dishes. Granulated gelatines are convenient for 
accurate measurement and quick work. 

Never cook gelatine. Soak (not dissolve) it in cold 
water, in the proportion of one cup of cold water to one 
box of gelatine. It will soften in fifteen minutes, if stirred 
often. Then dissolve in boiling liquid, — either water, 
milk, or custard, — and always strain through a fine 
strainer after it is dissolved. 

Gelatine Pudding, or Spanish Cream. 



^ box gelatine.^ 
3^ cup cold water. 
^ cup boiUng water. 
Yolks of 3 eggs. 
3 tablespoonf uls sugar. 



}/2 saltspoonf ul salt. 
1 pint milk. 
Whites of 3 eggs. 
1 teaspoonful vanilla. 



Soak the gelatine in the cold water till soft, then dis- 
solve it in boiling water. Make a custard with the 3'olks 
of the eggs, beaten, and mixed with the sugar and salt. 
Pour on the hot milk, and cook in the double boiler till 
it thickens. Then add the strained gelatine water, the 
vanilla, and the w^hites of the eggs, beaten stiflT. Mix all 
well, and turn into moulds wet in cold water. Place in ice 
water, and when hard and ready to serve turn out on a 
dish. 

Italian Cream. — Use the same proportions as in the 
preceding receipt. Dissolve the soaked gelatine in the hot 
custard instead of in hot water, and strain the whole while 
hot into the beaten whites. When well mixed, add Itmon 
or vanilla., and pour into a mould. 

Quaking Custard. — The same proportions as in Span- 

J If granulated geiatme, use 1^ tablespoons.

ish Cream. Dissolve the soaked gelatine in the hot cus- 
tard, and strain into a mould. When ready to serve, 
beat the whites of the eggs stiff, add three heaping table* 
spoonfuls oi powdered sugar, and ih^ juice of one lemon. 
Turn the custard on a platter, and heap the meringue 
around it. 



Snow Pudding. 



)^ box gelatine. 1 
3^ cup cold water. 
1 cup boiling water. 
1 cup sugar. 
3^ cup lemon juice. 
Whites of 3 eggs. 



Yolks of 3 eggs. 

3 tablespoonfuls sugar. 

y^ saltspoonf ul salt. 

1 pint hot milk. 

^ teaspoonful vanilla. 



Soak the gelatine in the cold water fifteen minutes, or 
until soft. Then dissolve it in the boiling water ; add the 
sugar and lemon juice. Stir till the sugar is dissolved. 
Strain into a large bowl, and set in ice water to cool. Stir 
occasionalh'. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, 
and when the gelatine begins to thicken, add the beaten 
whites, and beat all togetlier till xQvy light. When nearlj- 
stiff enough to drop, pour into a mould. Or beat until 
stiff enough to hold its shape, if your strength will allow, 
and pile lightly in a tall glass dish. Make a boiled custard 
of the yolks of the eggs, the sugar, salt, and milk, and when 
cool flavor with vanilla. Serve the sauce in a pitcher. Or, 
if the snow^ be moulded, turn it out on a dish, and pour the 
sauce around the pudding. The snow may be turned into 
a shallow dish, two inches deep, to harden, and when ready 
to serve cut into blocks and piled like a pyramid. Blocks 
of lemon or loine jelly ^ mixed with the snow or sparkling 
jelly (jelly broken up lightly with a fork), mak^ a pleasing 
variet}'. If the whites of the eggs be added to the gelatine 
mixture before it becomes cold, as is directed in many re- 
ceipts, more time will be required for the beating. Man}' 
have never made the dish a second time on account of the 
time and strength expended. Fifteen minutes is sufficient 
when made according to this receipt. 

I If granulated gelahne, use l\ tablespoons.

Imperial Cream. 

Make the rule for Lemon Jelly (page 350), and color part 
of it pink with cochineal or cranberry juice. Harden it in 
a shallow pan. Make Snow Padding (page 347) , and when 
nearl}' stiff enough to drop, stir in small squares of the 
pink and lemon jetty. Mould, and when readj^ to serve, 
turn out on a dish, garnish the base and top with maca^ 
roons soaked in wine. Pour rich boiled cusiard round the 
dish, and put macaroons and cubes of the jellies in the 
custard. 

Whipped Cream. 

Many wholesome, delicious, and attractive dishes may 
made with whipped cream. To those who can obtain 
of cream, these dishes afford a cheaper, more 
V.' ~^'ed, and far more satisfactory course than 

pie a^ forms of hot puddings. Many of them 

are equally uitable for tea. Very rich cream should be 
diluted and well mixed with an equal quantity of miUc. 
The best quality of cream obtained from the milkman is 
asuallj^ of the proper consistenc}'. Thin cream will become 
liquid after whipping, and thick cream will turn to butter. 
The cream should alwaj's be ic}" cold ; when it is to be 
served as a garnish, or for cream whips, it should be 
sweetened and flavored before it is whipped. 

A whip churn is the best utensil for whipping cream. 
This is a tin cylinder, perforated at the bottom and sides, 
and having a perforated dasher. When the churn is placed 
in a bowl of cream, and the dasher worked up and down, 
the air is forced from the C3'linder into the cream, causing 
it to become light and froth3\ A Dover egg-beater will 
make the cream light, but it has a different consistency? 
irom liial obtained by churning. 



Whipped Cream. 



353 



To Whip Cream, — Place a bowl half filled with cream 
in a pan of broken ice. When ver^' cold, put the churn into 
the cream, hold the cylinder firmly, and keep the cover in 
place with tJie left hand. Tip the churn slightly, that the 
cream may flow out at the bottom. Work the daslier with 
9 light short stroke icp^ and a hard^ pxLshing stroke doicn. 
When the froth appears, stir it down once or twice, as the 
first bubbles are too large ; and when the bowl \s full of 
froth, skim it off into a gi'anite pan placed on ice. Take 
off t\iQ froth onl}', and do not take it off below the holes 
in the cylinder, as it whips better when the}' are covered. 
For this reason never whip a pint of cream in a three- 
quart bowl, and do not try to whip it all, as usually a little 
is left in the bowl which is too thin to whip. 

One phit of cream should treble in whipping. If for a 
garnish, drain the whipped cream on a hair sieve placed 
over a pan, and keep it on ice till stiff enough to keep it 
shape. Creams that are to be moulded are made stiffer 
by the addition of gelatin?

whipped cream, and add the vanilla and wine. Dissolve 
the gelatine in the boiling water, and strain through a 
fine strainer over the whipped cream. Then stir (not 
beat) rapidl}' with the bowl of the spoon resting on the 
bottom of the pan. Turn the pan with the left hand while 
stirring with the right. If it feel lump}', lift the pan 
from the ice and place it in warm water to melt the gela- 
tine. Stir till the gelatine is well mixed with the cream, 
and when nearly stiff enough to drop, turn it into the 
mould. Keep on ice, and when ready to serve, turn out 
and garnish the top with Je%.

Plain Bavarian Cream. 

^ box gelatin&i 
^ cup cold water. 
1 pint cream. 



1^ cup sugar. 

1 teaspoonful vanilla. 



Soak the gelatine in cold water till soft. Chill and 
whip the cream till 3'ou have three pints of the whip. 
Boil the remainder of the cream (or if it be all whipped, 
use a cup of milk), with the sugar ; and when boiling add 
the soaked gelatine. Stir till dissolved. Strain into a 
granite pan, add the vanilla or lemon, and wine if you 
wish ; or flavor with tioo tablespoonfuls of melted choco- 
late^ or one quarter of a cup of strong coffee. Place the 
pan in ice water, stir occasionall}', and when the mixture 
is thoroughly cold and beginning to thicken, stir in lightly 
the whipped cream. When nearly stiff enough to drop, 
pour into the moulds. 

This cream is sometimes moulded in small cups. 
Put half of a canned apricot or peachy or three sections 
of orange^ or several small cherries^ or a candied plum, 
in the bottom of the cup before filling with the cream. 
Or line a bowl with whole strawberries and fill with the

with a few drops of the liquid jelly, and when hard add 
jelly to cover the fruit. When this is hard, place a smaller 
mould in the centre on the jelly and fill with ice. Pour 
tlie remainder of the jell}' between the two moulds, adding 
it slowly, and dropping in fruit here and there, if j^ou 
choose, until the mould is full. When the jell}^ is all firm, 
remove the ice, and add warm, not hot, water to the 
smaller mould, and take it out carefully', without breaking 
the wall of jelly. Fill the space with a Bavarian cream 
(page 356). Make a rich soft custard with the yolks of 
five eggs, half a cup of sugar, and a pint of milk; strain, 
and flavor with vanilla. When read}' to serve, dip the 
mould in warm water, i:>ut a dish over it, and invert dish 
and mould together. Remove the mould careful!}', and 
pour the soft custard around the pudding. Make the soft 
custard while the jell}- is hardening ; and do not put the 
materials for the Bavarian cream together until the small 
mould is removed from the jell}-, and the cavit}' read}- for 
the cream. Do not turn out of the mould until just before 
it goes to the table, as the slightest jarring breaks the 
jell}'. A coffee cup within a quart bowl, and a small pail 
within a larger one, have been successfully used by those 
who had no moulds. 

A variety of dishes may be made by using the differ- 
ent colored jellies and fruits ; and any of the creams stiff 
enough to mould can be used as filling. Snow Pudding, 
or Crenie Diplomate and ^Vine Jelly, Norfolk Cream 
and Lemon Jelly, Orange Sponge and Orange Jelly, are 
attractive combinations. It may also be made in two sizes 
of small moulds, serving one mould to each person. 

Gdteaii St. Honore. — Line a pie plate with thin puff 
paste, prick with a fork, and bake light brown. Make a

Sombe Glace. — Line a mould or the freezer with one 
quart of raspberry or pomegranate sherbet. Pack the 
sherbet round the bottom and sides of the mould oae inch 
deep. Fill the centre with Bavarian cream, or Charlotte 
Musse cream, or Creme Diplomate. Cover with the sher- 
bet, and pack in ice and salt one hour. 

Biscuit Glace. — Ice-cream and sherbet are often served 
in small, fancy paper cases, which may be obtained at a 
confectioner's. Make and freeze the cream, and fill the 
paper cases with two kinds, either sherbet and plain ice- 
cream, or sherbet and tutti frutti, or Charlotte Russe cream 
and sherbet, or ice-cream. Pack the cases in a freezer, 
and keep on ice and salt till ver}^ hard. Serve on a lace 
paper napkin laid on a fanc}^ plate. Sometimes the bis- 
cuits are covered with a meringue, and colored slightly 
with a salamander just before serving. 

Frozen Apricots. — Cut one can of apricots into smal! 
pieces, add one pint of sugar and one quart of water. 
When the sugar is dissolved, freeze. When parth' frozen 
add, if you like, one pint of whipped cream, measured 
after whipping. This is delicious without the cream. 
Peaches, pineapples, cherries, and strawberries are deli- 
cious when frozen. Varj^ the amount of sugar as the fruit 
requires. 

Sherbets, or Water Ices. 

Sherbets, or water ices, are made with the juice of fruit, 
water, and sugar. With a supply of canned fruit, or fruit 
syrup alwaj's at hand, a variety of delicious desserts may 
be quickl}' prepared. A tablespoonful of gelatine, soaked 
and dissolved, gives a light and smooth consistency to 
water ices. Many prefer to boil the water and sugar to a 
clear sjTup, remove the scum, and when cool add the fruit 
juice ; and others use the white of (i%g beaten stiff, add- 
ing it after the sherbet is partly frozen. The following 
are some of the most delicious water ices. Follow the 
directions given under Orange Sherbet, for all the othei 
varieties.

Cake Making. 369 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING 
CAKE. 

Study first the directions given under Measuring, Mix- 
ing, and Baking. 

Cake is a mixture of part or all of the following mate- 
rials ; eggs, sugar or molasses, flour, butter or cream, milk 
or water, fruit, soda, cream of tartar, spices, etc. 

An unlimited variety of cakes may be made by varying 
the proportions of these materials, and to the same pro- 
portions many different names are given. Many amusing 
experiences are known of the eagerness with which a newly 
named receipt for cake is received, which, after many trials, 
has been found to be an old receipt arranged in a different 
order. An analysis of the hundreds of receipts given in 
books devoted to cake-making would show that the gen- 
eral principles involved may be included under two di- 
visions, namelv, receipts for sponge cakes, made loithoiit 
hutter; and^:>ow/if?or cup cakes, made icith butter. Sponge 
cakes are made rich with eggs, the lightness depending 
wholly upon the amount of air beaten into the ^g'g ; or an 
inferior quality is sometimes made by substituting soda 
and cream of tartar for part of the eggs, and adding more 
flour and some liquid, usually water. They vary in color, 
3iccording as the white or yolk of the egg is used. Butter 
cakes are varied in the same way, and also by the addi- 
tion of fruit, or spices, or various coloring and flavoring 
materials. 

There is no one department in cooking where so much 
depends upon the baking as in making cake. The fire 
should be rather low, but suflacient to last through the 
entire baking. In many stoves it is exceedingly difficult 
to bake cake by a morning fire ; as so much coal is put on, 

24 




370 The Boston Cook Book. 

the fire is too hot and cannot be checked sufficient!}'. The 
oven should be less hot than for bread. If too hot, leave 
the oven door open for ten minutes before putting in the 
cake, then watch it, and protect it by putting over it a 
covering of paper, or a pan on the grate above. Do not 
attempt to make cake unless 3'ou can have entire control 
of the fire. 

Thin cakes require a hotter oven than those baked in 
thick loaves. If the oven be not hot enough at first,, or be 
cooled too suddenh' during the baking, the cake will not 
be light. Cakes with molasses in them burn more quickly 
than others. Thin cakes should bake from fifteen to 
twenty minutes, thicker cakes from thirt}' to fort}- minutes, 
very thick loaA^es about an hour, and fruit cake from two 
to three hours. Whichever kind 3'ou are baking, divide 
the time required into quarters. During the first quarter 
the heating is not manifested in appearance except b}- the 
rising ; during the second the cake should continue to rise 
and begin to brown ; then should become all over a rich 
golden brown ; and in the last quarter settle a little, brown 
in the cracks, and shrink from the pan. Be careful not to 
take it out too soon. If necessary to move it, do it very 
gently, and never mov^e it when it has risen to the full 
height, but is not browned or fixed in its shape. 

If cake brown before rising, the oven is too hot. When 
it rises more in the centre, cracks open, and sta3-s up, it is 
too stiflT with flour. It should rise first on the edges, then 
in the middle, crack slightly, settle to a level again, when 
the cracks usually come together. Nothing is more sug- 
gestive of bakeshop cake, or inferior qualit}' in material, 
than a loaf with an upper surface having sharp edges, 
then hollows, and a peaked centre, as if the inside of the 
cake had boiled up and run out over the top. 

Line 3'our cake tins with paper, to prevent burning the 
bottom and edges and to aid in removing the cake from 
the pans. Lay the paper over the outside of the pan, and 
crease it round the edge of the bottom. Allow it large 
enough to come above the top of the pan. Fold in the 



Cahe Making. 371 



middle lengthwise and crosswise, and cut out the open 
corners to the crease made b}' the pan. Then fit it into 
the inside of the pan, and grease the paper, not the pan, 
with fresh butter or lard. Many use a rag tied on a stick ; 
others grease with a brush. Nice brushes are very ex- 
pensive (and no others are suitable), and unless carefully 
cleaned are quite objectionable. Rags and paper absorb 
the grease which should be put on the pan, and in any case 
the fingers should be washed after the process. So there 
is no quicker, easier, or more economical way of greasing 
a tin than to rub the butter on with the fingers. 

Mix cake in an earthen bowl, and never in a tin pan. 
Use a wooden spoon, as iron spoons discolor the hand and 
the mixture. Use only the best materials. Go without 
cake rather than try to make it, or eat it when made, with 
what is called cooking butter and second-rate eggs. Such 
cake cannot be good or wholesome. Wash the butter, if 
very salt. Brown sugar is good for fruit cake, but for 
all other varieties use the finest granulated or powdered 
sugar. Very coarse granulated sugar makes heavy cake, 
with a hard and stick}" crust. The flour should be dr3\ 
When it has been kept in a cool place it should be 
slightly warmed, and alwajs sifted before using. St. 
Louis flour — or pastry flour, as it is sometimes called — 
is best for cake. Wlien new-process flour is used, taivc 
one eighth less. Soda, cream of tartar, and baking- 
powders should be crushed and sifted into the flour, then 
sifted two or three times with the flour. Mix spices 
with the flour or with the sugar. Mix a little of the 
measure of flour with the fruit to keep it from sticking 
together or settling. If the sugar be lumpy, crush and sift 
before using. Eggs should be fresh, and cooled hy keep- 
ing in cold water or in the ice-chest. The yolks and 
whites should be beaten separately. Break each Qg% on 
the edge of the cup, just enough to crack the middle of the 
shell, so the white will flow out, but not hard enough to 
break into the yolks. Then hold the Qg^ over the cup, 
with the cracked side up, and break it apart. Let the 



372 The Boston Cook Booh. 

white run into the cup, and keep the 3'olk in the half shell 
until all the white is drained off. Be careful not to break 
the jolk, as the smallest" portion of it in the whites will 
prevent them from frothing. Beat the j'olks in a bowl, 
and the whites in a platter if 3'ou use a fork or whisk, or 
in a bowl if you use a Dover beater. Never stop beating 
the whites until the}^ are stiff and dry, as it is impossible 
to have them light if they become liquid again. 

Measure all the ingredients, and have the fire and all 
utensils read}', before 3'ou begin to mix. Observe the fol- 
lowing order in putting materials together. 

Sponge Cake Mixtures. — Beat the yolks until light or 
lemon-colored and thick. Add the sugar graduallj', and 
beat again. Add the lemon juice or flavoring, and water, 
if that is to be used. Beat the whites until stiff and dry, 
and cut or fold them in lightly, then sift in the flour, and 
fold in carefull}' without an}' stirring. Sponge cakes should 
not be beaten after adding the flour. Those made with 
soda and cream of tartar require less beating than those 
without, but they are a A^er}' poor substitute for genuine 
sponge cake. 

Butter Cake Mixtures. — "Warm the bowl with hot 
water, then wipe dr}'. Put in the butter, and rub with 
a wooden or silver spoon until light and creamy. Be 
careful not to have the bowl so hot as to melt the butter. 
Add the sugar and beat again. If the habit of rubbing 
the butter and sugar together with the hand be alreadv 
formed, and 3'Ou find it easier than to use a spoon, it is 
hardly worth while to change ; but for those who are 
wholl}^ inexperienced it is better to learn to use the 
spoon, and ever}" lad}' would prefer to have her cook 
mix in that way. If the proportion of sugar be large 
for the butter, — more than double, — beat part of the 
sugar with the butter, and the remainder with the yolks 
of the eggs. Where a very small proportion of butter 
is to be used, it may be melted and mixed with the 
eggs and sugar. Beat the yolks till light and thick, 
then beat thetn well with the butter and su2;ar. Add the 



Sjponge Cake. 373 



flavoring. Then add a little milk, then a little flour, and 
milk again, and continue until all the milk and flour are 
used. Lastly, add the beaten whites. All cakes made 
with butter require to be beaten long and vigorously- after 
adding the flour, that they may be smooth and fine- 
grained. Fruit should be added last ; cake with fruit 
should be a little stitFer with flour than that without 
fruit. Citron and large pieces of fruit may be put in 
in layers, or spread over the dough in the pan. 

All cake should be baked as soon as possible after it is 
mixed. Put the scrapings from the bowl into small tins. 
If put into the loaf, they sometimes cause a heavy streak 
through the top. 

Cake is baked when it shrinks from the pan and stops 
hissing, or when a straw inserted in the centre comes out 
clean. Remove the loaf from the pan as soon as baked, 
Mfting it out by the paper ; or, if not papered, loosen the 
edges with a knife, and turn the pan over upon a cloth 
laid over a bread-cooler. Remove the pan as soon as 
possible. Never let cake stand in the pan to become 
moist. When cake is baked too hard or burned, rub oflf 
the burned surface with a coarse grater. 




Sponge Cake. 



5 eggs. 

1 cup sugar, powdered or fine 
granulated. 



1 saltspoonful salt. 

3^.3 lemon (grated rind and juice). 

1 cup pastry flour. 



See general directions for putting together (page 372) c 
The mixture should be stitf and spongy, of the consistency 
of Charlotte Russe filling, as it is poured into the pan. 
Bake in a deep bread pan, in a moderate oven, nearly an 
hour, — in a shallow pan, about forty minutes. If stirred 
instead of beaten, the bubbles of air will be broken and the 
mixture will become Hquid. When baked, it will be tough 
and too close-grained. To make this cake well, requires 
strength in beating and judgment in baking ; but when 
successful, it is one of the most satisfactory and perfect

Lady Fingers and Sponge Drops. — Four eggs, half 
a cup of poiudered sugar, half a saltspoonful of salt, one 
teaspoonful of flavoring, and three quarters of a cup of 
pastry flour. See general directions for mixing sponge 
cakes. Pour the mixture into a pastry bag, and press 
through it into shape, about three inches long and not 
quite one inch wide. Or drop by the spoonful on a but- 
tered pan, and you have Sponge Drops. Sprinkle pow- 
dered sugar over them, and bake twelve or sixteen minutes 
in a very slow oven. 

3Iiss Ward's Sponge Cake. — Break teyi eggs into a 
bowl; add one pound of powdered sugar, and beat to- 
gether for half an hour without stopping. Add half a

and a loineglassful oi wine. Bake in deep pans one hour; 
slowly at first, then quicken the fire the last half-hour.

flaky. Add one cup and a half of fne granulated sugar, 
and beat again ; add one teaspoonful of vanilla or almond, 
then mix in the flour quickly and lightly. Line the bottom 
and funnel of a cake pan with paper not greased, pour in 
the mixture, and bake about forty minutes. When done, 
loosen the cake around the edge, and turn out at once. 
Some persons have been more successful with this cake by 
mixins: the sufjar with the flour and cream of tartar, and 
adding all at once to the beaten egg.

Frosting. 

Plain FroSti7ig. — White of 07ie egg^ one teaspoonful 
of lemon juice^ and 07ie scant cup of poicdered sugar. Put 
the egg and lemon juice in a bowl, and stir the sugar in 
gradually. Then beat, not stir, all together five minutes. 

Boiled Icing. — One cup of gramdated sugar ^ one third 
of a cup of boiling water ^ ichite of one egg., and one salt- 
spoonful of cream of tartar. Boil the sugar and water 
without stirring, until the sjTup taken up on a skewer will 
"thread" or "rope." When it is nearly at that point, 
beat the egg stiff", add the cream of tartar, and pour the 
boiling syrup over the egg in a fine stream, beating well. 
When it thickens and is perfectly smooth, pour it over the 
cake. It hardens quickly, and should be put on the cake 
before it stiffens enough to drop.

powdered sugar till stiff" enough to spread, not to run. 
Flavor with vanilla or wine.

Frosting.

sugar every five minutes. When it begins to thicken add 
the lemon juice and beat as belbre. It should thicken by 
the beating of the Qgg^ and not by the addition of too much 
sugar. Do not use all the measure of sugar unless needed. 
Beat with a long flop, over and over, and never stir. When 
stiff enough to leave a " clean cut," or not to run together 
when cut with a knife, spread a thin layer of frosting on 
the cake, and when this is hard put on another lajer a 
quarter of an inch thick. When this is firm, mark it for 
cutting. To the remainder of the frosting add sugar more 
rapidly, until it begins to harden on the spoon and bowl. 
Put a confectioner's tube into the end of a pastr}' bag, fill 
the bag with frosting, twist the end tightl}', and press the 
frosting through the tube on the cake in any design you 
wish. 

Pink Frosting. — Color a portion of the Ornamental 
Frosting with cochineal^ adding it slowh' till of the desired 
shade. "i 

Chocolate Frosting. — Melt a square of chocolate in a 
saucepan, and add to the Ornamental Frosting, using 
enough to color light or dark as you prefer. 

Orange Frosting. — Grate the thin rind of an orange^ 
and soak it half an hour in three or four teaspoonfuls of 
the orange juice. Then squeeze the juice through a fine 
cloth, and use the same as lemon juice in Ornamental 
Frosting.

Bake twenty to thirty minutes, or till brown and well 
puffed. Split when cool, and fill with cream. 

I^clairs. — Bake the Cream Cake mixture in pieces 
four inches long and one and a half wide. When cool, 
split and fill with cream. Ice with chocolate or vanilla 
frosting. 

Cream for Cream Cakes and ifcclairs. 



1 pint milk, boiled. 

2 tablespoonfuls cornstarch. 

3 eggs, well beaten. 



1 saltspoonful salt, or 
1 teaspoonful butter. 



Wet the cornstarch in cold milk, and cook in the boiling 
milk ten minutes. Beat the eggs ; add the sugar and the 
thickened milk. Cook in the double boiler five minutes. 
Add the salt or butter, and when cool, flavor with lemon^ 
vanilla, or almond. 



Kisses, or Cream Meringues. 

Beat the whites of three eg{/s stiff and flak}' ; add three 
quarters of a cup of powdered sugar ^ sifting and cutting

open for half an hour. Then brown slightl}'. Put two 
together ; or put them on the paper in oblong shape, dry 
one hour, brown, remove the soft part, and fill with whipped 
cream. 

To make these successfull}', the steady', moderate heat 
of a confectioner's brick oven is essential. It Is a waste ot 
time and material to attempt them in an ordinary stove 
oven. 

Macaroons.* 

Half a pound oi almonds^ blanched, dried, and pounded 
to a paste, with one teaspjoonfid of rose water. Beat to- 
gether the whites of three eggs^ and half a cup of poiodered 
sugar ^ adding the sugar b}' the teaspoonful. Add half a 
teaspoonful of cdmond essence^ then add the pounded 
almonds and, if too soft to be shaped, add one tablespoon- 
ful of flour. Roll with wet hands into balls the size of 
walnuts, flatten them slightl}', and place some distance 
apart on buttered paper. Bake slowh'. 

Almond paste, ready for use, may be obtained at a con- 
fectioner's. Break H up with a fork, add the beaten whites 
and sugar, using four or five eggs for half a pound of 
paste. Drop by teaspoonfuls on paper, and bake as 
above.

Fresh Fruit. 39] 



FRUIT. ■^'^^^-^^^ 

It would be a great saving of time and work, give a 
pleasing variety to bills of fare, and be above all a great 
promoter of health, if people would use ripe fruit abun- 
dantl}' in its season at their tables (not between meals). 
With the markets bountifull}- supplied with many varieties 
of fruit, it is to be regretted that it cannot be found at 
ever}^ table at least once a da3\ Much of the money spent 
for some kinds of meat would be better expended for frr.it. 
A simple course of fruit is all that is needed after a dinner, 
and is much more wholesome than pies. But it is so hard 
for some people to break away from old customs that it 
will be long before housekeepers generally will be content 
to serve the queen of all fruits, the apple, in its natural 
state instead of making it into the " persistent pie," over 
the preparation of which many women toil, for naught save 
the fear that they may be considered shiftless if they 
have n't a pie in the house. 

Eipe fruit is especially appropriate at the breakfast- 
table, and may be taken before or after the principal 
dishes, according to individual needs and taste. Some peo- 
ple require the acid of oranges or grapes before they can 
eat anything substantial ; others might be made ill by their 
use at that time, but be benefited by them afterwards. 

All fruit should be served as fresh and cold as possible. 
A dish of fruit which has been kept from day to day in a 
warm room may answer for an ornament, but it is not 
tempting to the palate. Only sound, fresh fruit should 
appear at the table. 

Apples for table use should have a pleasant spic}' flavor, 
not too acid, and should be wiped clean, or polished if you 
prefer the street-vender's style. 



392 The Boston Cook Booh. 

Oranges may be served whole or cut. Manj' slice them 
across the sections ; but the presence of the seeds and tough 
inner skin is objectionable. A better wa}- is to remove all 
the rind and white skin, divide into sections, then with the 
point of a silver fruit-knife cut off the inner skin in the 
middle, slip out the seeds, and cut each section into three 
pieces. Never serve with the seeds left in, nor sweeten 
until just before serving. A neat way to peel an orange 
is to cut the rind from the ends and leave a strip round 
the middle, then open, leaving the sections on the strip 
of peel. Or cut the oranges in halves crosswise without 
peeling, sprinkle with sugar, and eat with a spoon. 

Grapes^ Malagas especially, should be carefull}- rinsed in 
cold water, then drained. Fruit scissors should be used to 
divide the clusters. 

Bananas maj' be served whole, or sliced and slightly 
sweetened or salted. 

Peaches should have the wool wiped off, or if pared and 
quartered should be sprinkled with fine granulated sugar, 
and served at once. 

Straioherries^ if gritt}', should be rinsed and drained, 
then hulled, and not sweetened till served. Large selected 
berries may be served with the stems on. Pass sugar with 
them, that those who prefer may roll them in it. 

Currants should be sweetened, and large whole clusters 
maybe served on the stem. Currants and raspberries are 
delicious when served together. 

Watermelons should be served very cold. Cut off a 
slice at each end, that each half may stand upright. Serve 
the core only, taking it out with a tablespoon in cone- 
shaped pieces. Other melons should have the seeds re- 
moved before serving, be cut in halves, a lump of ice in 
each, and served with sugar or salt. 

Pineapples. — Pare, remove the eyes, and cut in thin 
slices ; then remove the fibrous centre, and serve in sHces, 
or cut the tender parts into small pieces and sweeten to 
taste. Or pare and pull off the tender part with a fork, as 
directed for preserved pineapple. 



Stewed and Baked Fruits. 393 

Iced Fruits. — Dip selected fruit into the white of egg 
slightly beaten, then roll in fine granulated sugar. Dr}-, 
and serve very cold. 

Whole fruit should be served in a high dish, garnished 
with green leaves, flowers, or vines, and, with a tasteful 
combination of colors, arranged in a convenient way for 
serving. 

Nuts should be cracked, and served with salt. 

Almonds and other nuts having a tough inner skin 
should be blanched. 

Raisiiis. — Use only choice varieties, and serve with 
nuts. 



Tropical Snow. 



8 sweet oranges. 
1 cocoanut, grated. 
6 red bananas. 



1 glass sherry wine, or 
3^ cup lemon juice. 
Powdered sugar to taste. 



Peel the oranges, divide into sections, and remove the 
seeds and tough membrane. Put a layer of orange in the 
bottom of a glass dish, pour over it a little wine or lemon 
juice, and strew with powdered sugar ; add cocoanut, and 
then the banana cut in thin slices ; repeat the process, 
using orange, cocoanut, banana, etc., as before. The top 
layer is to be heaped high in the centre, and sprinkled 
thickly with cocoanut and powdered sugar, and garnished 
around the base with slices of banana. 

Other combinations of fruit ma}' be arranged to suit the 
taste ; and cocoanut cakes or macaroons^ crumbled, or a 
meringue of ichite of egg and sugar ^ may take the plac« 
of the grated cocoanut. 

Stewed and Baked Fruits. 

The simplest forms of cooking fruit are stewing and 
baking. Onl}* a small amount of sugar is needed, and it 
is not well to prepare a large quantity at a time, as stewed 
fruits do not keep long. In cooking fruit alwa3's use porce- 
lain or granite kettles, earthen dishes, wooden spoons, and 



394 ^'^^ Boston Cook Book. 

silver knives, and pare just before cooking, that the deli- 
cate flavor of the fruit may be preserved, and its attractive 
appearance not impaired b}' discoloration. 

Stewed A2yple Sauce. — Pare, core, and quarter six or 
eight tart apples. Make a sjTup with one cup of sugar ^ 
two thirds of a cup of water^ and a little lemon peel. 
When boiling, add the apples, and cook carefully two or 
three minutes, till the}^ are just tender, but not broken. 
Remove them carefull}', boil the sjrup down a little, and 
strain it over the apples. Cook them in granite or porcelain 
pans, and use a wooden spoon. 

Compote of Apples. — Make a syrup with one cup of 
sugar .^ one cup of icater^ and a square-inch of stick cin- 
namon. Boil slowl}' for ten minutes, skimming well. 
Core and pare eight or ten tart apples ; cook till nearly 
done in the syrup. Drain, and cook them a few minutes 
in the oven. Boil the S3'rup till almost like a jelly. Ar- 
range the apples on a dish for serving. Fill the ■ core 
cavities with jelly or marmalade. Pour the syrup over 
them. Put whipp>ed cream around the base, and garnish 
the cream with Je%. 

Baked Apples. — Core and pare sour apples. Put them 
in a shallow earthen dish, fill the cavities with sugar ^ 
mixed with grated lemon rind ; add water to cover the 
bottom of the dish. Bake in a very quick oven till soft, 
basting often with the syrup. 

Quinces may be baked in the same waj- , adding a little 
more water, as the}' require a longer time for baking. 
When eaten hot with butter and sugar ^ they are delicious. 

iVo. 2. — Fill a deep pudding-dish with apples, pared, 
cored, and quartered. For two quarts add one cup of 
sugar and one cup of water. Bake, closel}^ covered, in a 
very moderate oven several hours, or till dark red. 

Baked Pears. — Hard pears, or "windfalls," are deli- 
cious pared and baked as in the preceding receipt. When 
done, and still hot, they may be sealed in Mason's jars, 
and will keep indefinitely. B\' preparing one large dishful 
every day during the pear season, a supply of wholesome 



Jellies. 395 



sauce may be easily obtained from fruit that is often 
left to waste on the ground. 

Steamed Rhubarb. — Wash and cut the rhubarb into 
inch pieces without peeling. Put it into a granite double 
boiler, add one cup of sugar for a pint of fruit, and cook 
till the rhubarb is soft. Do not stir it. When the rhu- ,- 
barb is very sour, steam it without sugar until the juic^' 
flows, then drain it, add the sugar, and steam again til^x 
the sugar is dissolved. Or pour boiling water over it ^^I^AB^ 
and let it stand Ave minutes, then drain and steam. 

Stewed Prunes. — Wash carefully, and if hard and dry 
soak an hour before cooking. Put them into a porcelain 
kettle, with boiling water to cover them. Boil, closely 
covered, from five to ten minutes, or until swollen and 
tender. Then add one tablespoonful of sugar for one pint 
of prunes, and boil a few moments longer, but not enough 
to break them. Use only the best selected prunes. If 
they lack flavor, add a little lemon juice. 

Cranberries. — Put three pints of washed cranberries in 
a granite stewpan. On top of them put three cups of gran- 
idated sugar and three gills of water. After they begin 
to boil cook them ten minutes, closely covered, and do not 
stir them. Remove the scum. They will jelly when cool, 
and the skins will be soft and tender. 

No. 2. (^Miss Ward.) — Equal measure of cranberries 
and sugar. Wash, drain, put in a porcelain kettle with 
cold water to just show among the berries when they are 
pressed down. When they boil add a quarter of the sugar. 
Sprinkle it over the berries without stirring. Let it boil 
again a minute, add another quarter, etc., till all the sugar 
is in. Boil up once more, and turn out. Boil slowly, and 
do not stir. This method is preferred by those who like a 
very rich sweet sauce. 

Jellies. 

Jellies are made of equal parts of clear fruit juice and 
sugar. Apples, currants, quinces, grapes, and barberries 
are the fruits usually used. Low blackberries and sivamp 



39^ The Boston Cook Book, 

huckleherries make delicious i^Wy. Crab apples and quinces 
will form jellj^ easilj' ; but grapes are unreliable, and cur- 
rants, if not gathered at the proper time, will sometimes 
fail. Cherries and some other fruits require the addition 
of gelatine. Berries, currants, and grapes require no 
water. Simply mash them in their own juice. Apples, 
peaches, and quinces should be stewed in as little water as 
possible, then mashed, and the juice strained. The juices 
of fruits contain a gelatinous substance called pectose, or 
pectic acid, which is soluble in the fruit juice, but has the 
property of coagulation when mixed with sugar, exposed 
to a slight heat, and then cooled. Sometimes the heat of 
the sun is sufficient, but usualh' a short but more intense 
heat is necessar}'. When the sugar has a bluish tinge, or 
when there is not enough sugar to absorb the water in the 
juice, or when the juice is unusuall}'' watery, as when the 
fruit is over-ripe, and the fruit is boiled a long time to evap- 
orate this water, the mixture loses its gelatinous properties 
and becomes gumm}', or, as disconsolate housekeepers say, 
"will not jelly." 

Currant Jelly. — Currants should not be over-ripe, nor 
gathered after a rain, as then the}' are too water}'. In 
New England currants are in the best condition about 
the 10th of July. Equal parts of rec/and white currants^ 
or currants and raspberries, make a delicately colored 
and flavored jelly. Pick over and remove the leaves and 
poor fruit, and if gritty wash and drain them, but do not 
stem them. Mash them in a porcelain kettle with a 
wooden pestle, without heating, as that makes the jelly 
darker. Let them drain in a flannel bag over night Do 
not squeeze them, or the jelly will be cloudy. In :]ie 
morning measure a bowl of sugar for each bowl of juice, 
and heat the sugar carefully in an earthen dish in the 
oven. Stir it often to prevent burning. Boil the juice 
twenty minutes, and skim thoroughly. Add the hot 
sugar, and boil from three to five minutes, or till it 
thickens on a spoon when exposed to the air. Turn at 
once into glasses, and let them remain in the sun several 



Marmalade, 397 



days, then cover with paper dipped in brandy, and paste 
paper over the top of the glass. 

One who is authorit}' on this subject recommends cov- 
ering with melted parafflne, or putting a lump of paraffine 
on the jelly while still hot ; then no paper is needed. If 
one can be sure of several sunny days, and a perfectly 
drj' place in which to keep jelhes, they may be made 
without boiUng. Mix the sugar with an equal weight of 
currant juice, and stir till dissolved. Fill the glasses and 
keep in the sun till dry. 

After draining the juice the currants may be squeezed, 
and a second qualit}' of jelly made. It ma}' not be clear, 
but answers for some purposes. 

Crab-Apple^ Wild-Apple^ or Porter- Apple Jelly, {Miss 
Harriott T. Ward.) — Wash the fruit ; cut into pieces, 
but do not pare, nor remove the seeds ; barely cover with 
cold water. Boil and mash them until soft. Then drain 
on a sieve. Use the juice only, and do not squeeze the 
fruit. Boil the juice with an equal quantity of sugar, 
until it jellies. Peach jelly is made in the same manner. 

Quince Jelly. — Wipe the fruit carefully, and remove 
all the stems, and parts not fair and sound. Use the 
best parts of the fruit for canning or preserving, and the 
skin, cores, and hard parts for jell}^ The seeds contain a 
large portion of gelatinous substance. Boil all together, 
in enough water to cover, till the pulp is soft. Mash, and 
drain. Use the juice only, and when boiling add an equal 
weight of hot sugar, and boil till it jelhes in the spoon. 

Grape Jelly. — Select the grapes when not fully ripe. 
Wash and drain, then put them in a preserving-kettle, 
mash well, and heat till all the skins are broken and the 
juice flows freel}'. Strain, and use the juice only with an 
equal weight of sugar, as for Currant Jelly. 



Marmalade. 

This is made of the pulp of fruits with the juice, unless 
that has been used for jell}^ When fruit is not abundant, 



39^ The Boston Cook Book. 

it is well to make marmalade at the same time with jellies, 
especially' from peaches, quinces, and grapes. After drain- 
ing, rub the fruit pulp through a sieve, add an equal weight 
of sugar, and boil very slowly half or three quarters of an 
hour. Stir often to prevent burning. 

Preserves. 

These are usually prepared with equal weights of sugar 
and fruit. Although too rich for dail}- use, there are 
many people who prefer them to the canned fruit, and 
there are some fruits which are better with the full weight 
of sugar. The fruit should be ripe, fresh, and perfectly 
sound. The following rules illustrate the best methods 
for the different varieties of fruit. 

Beaches. — Pare the peaches ; or remove the skins b}' 
plunging the peaches into boiling 13'e (two gallons of water 
and one pint of wood ashes) . When the skins will slip 
easily, take the peaches out with a skimmer and plunge 
them into cold water ; rinse in several waters, and there 
will be no taste of the lye. Weigh, and add three fourths 
of a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. Halve them, 
and use some of the pits, or leave them whole as you 
please. The stones improve the flavor. Make a S3Tup 
by adding as little water as possible to the sugar, — 
about 07ie cupful to each pyound of sugar. When it 
boils, skim till clear, then add the peaches, and cook until 
transparent. 

Brandy Beaches. — Prepare the peaches as above, and 
use half a cup of the best brandy to every pound of fruit. 
Add the brandy just as the syrup is taken from the fire. 
Some people prefer the 3'ellow peaches, but white-fleshed 
freestone peaches have a delicious flavor. 

Damsons and Greengages should be pricked in many 
places with a large needle, to prevent the skins from 
bursting. Or scald them and remove the skins, as some- 
times they harden in cooking. Prepare the syrup as for 
peaches. Cook onl}- a few at a time, that they may not 
be broken. On three successive mornings pour ofl* the 



Preserves. 399 



S3TUP, and boil it gentlj' for ten minutes. Tiiis will 
thoroughly cook the fruit, without destroying the shape. 

Preserved Quinces. — Use the orange quinces. Wipe, 
pare, quarter, and remove all the core and the hard part 
under the core. Take an equal weight of sugar. Cover 
the quinces with cold water. Let them come slowly to a 
boil. Skim, and when nearly soft put one quarter of the 
sugar on the top, but do not stir. When this boils, add 
another part of the sugar, and continue until all the sugar 
is in the kettle. >Let them boil slowly until the color you 
like, either light or dark. 

Another way is to cook the quinces in water till ten- 
der, drain, and put them in a stone jar in layers, with an 
equal weight of sugar. Cover closel}^ In a cold dry 
place they will keep perfectly. The}^ are lighter-colored 
and more tender than when cooked in the sj'rup. Watch 
them during the first month, and if there be any signs of 
fermentation, set the jar in a kettle of hot water till the 
fruit is scalded. Reserve the broken or unshapely pieces 
of quince, cut them in small cubes, and use with Strav;herry 
Tomatoes. Allow three quarters of a pound of sugar to a ;.c^:r--^ 
pound of fruit. Make the s3Tup, and cook the fruit in it '^ ^^ 
till tender. Skim it out, and boil the S3Tup down for tlnu^ ^^^ /' 
minutes. Fill the jars, and seal at once. Equal parts oS^ftA^ 
siceet apple^ cooked with the quince but with no extra sugar, 
can scarcel}' be distinguished from the quince. 

Preserved Pineapple. — Remove the skin and all the 
eyes, take the pineapple in your kft hand, and with a sil- 
ver fork begin at the stem end of the fruit and fork out 
small bits. This will leave the core, which is juiceless 
and tasteless, in your hand. Weigh the pineapple after it 
is thuS' prepared, and sprinkle over it three quarters of a 
pound of sugar to one pound of pineapple. When a 
syrup is formed, cook the apple slowly in it until trans- 
parent, then remove the fruit and boil the syrup a little 
longer. Or slice the pineapple in half-inch slices, and cut 
out the core. Cook in the syrup, being careful not to 
break the slices. 



400 The Boston Cook Book. 

Preserved Strawberries^ Raspberries, Currants, Blacks 
berries, and Cherries. — Measure a bowl of fruit and the 
same quantit}^ of sugar. Put in a preserving-kettle, over 
night, a laj-er of fruit, and then one of sugar. In the 
morning cook slowly without stirring, until the liquid is 
clear aad the fruit soft. Skim thoroughl}^ before putting 
into the jars. Cherries should be stoned. The pits may 
be used if the flavor be desired. 

No. 2. — Use onl}' large and selected fruit, and allow 
one cup of sugar to a pint jar of fruit. Pick over the 
fruit, and put at once into the jars, with as little hand- 
ling as possible, and sprinkle each laj^er with sugar. Place 
pi^the jars in a boiler of water, and let the water boil ten 
minutes. Have a little S3Tup boiling, and fill each jar to 
the brim with the boiling syrup, and seal at once. 

Jams. 

Jams are made with whole small fruits, or large fruit cut 
fine, and cooked in an equal weight of sugar. 

Grape Jam. — Wash the grapes, and squeeze or pinch 
the pulp from the skins. Boil the pulp until it separates 
from the seeds, and rub it through a sieve. Then add the 
skins to the pulp, and boil with an equal w^eight of sugar 
fifteen minutes. Put into small jars or tumblers, and cover 
with paper. 

Currant, Raspberry, or Blackberry Jam. — Pick over 
and mash the fruit ; allow one pound of sugar to a pound 
of fruit. Put the fruit and one quarter of the sugar into 
a granite or porcelain kettle ; when boiling, add another 
quarter of the sugar ; boil again, add more sugar, and 
when all is used, let it boil till it hardens on the spoon 
in the air. 

Apples, pears, peaches, and quinces should be pared, 
cut small, and treated in the same way. Cooking in only 
a little sugar at a time prevents the fruit from becoming 
hard. 



Canning. 40 1 



Canning. 

Canning differs from preserving in that the fruit is kept, 
either with or without sugar, by sealing in air-tight jars or 
cans, and is not cooked long enough to destro}' its natural 
flavor. Some authorities state that fruit may be kept b}' 
putting it in the jars, filling with cold water, and sealing 
iramediatel}'. But nearl}' all fruits, are improved by the 
addition of more or less sugar. As a rule, all fruits that 
require sugar when fresh require it when canned. 

The important points in canning are to have the fruit 
perfect in shape and quality ; tlie syrup clear, righth' pro- 
portioned, and boiling hot ; the jars hot and filled to over-* 
flowing, and sealed quickly and thoroughly, that no air 
may be left inside. Have all utensils in order and at 
hand, that there ma}^ be no needless dela3\ Large-mouthed 
glass jars with glass covers or porcelain-lined screw covers 
are the best. Pint jars are more convenient for a small 
famil}'. The}' should be scalded, and the covers and rub- 
bers clean and perfectl}' fitted. Keep the jars in hot water 
until ready to fill, or roll each one in hot water just before 
filling, or place them in a folded towel wrung out of hot 
water, and put a silver spoon or fork in the jar while 
filling. A clamp is a great convenience, as the jar may 
be held in the clamp directly over the kettle and filled very 
quickly. If without this, have a broad shallow pan, half 
filled with hot water, on the stove or on a table near b}', 
and place the jars in it while filling them. A wide-mouthed 
tunnel aids in filling the jars. When the fruit is to be boiled 
in the jars, place a perforated tin or some flat stones or 
muffin rings in the boiler, to keep the jars from resting on 
the bottom. Then the water will be under as well as 
around the jar, and there will be no danger of breaking. 

All ripe mellow fruit ma}' be prepared and put at once 
into the jars. Place the jars in a boiler or kettle of warm 
water, with something underneath to avoid breaking. 
Make the syrup, using sugar according to taste, or in the 
proportion of one cup of sugar and one cup of water for 

26 



402 TJie Boston Cook Book, 

each jar o^ small juicy berries^ and one cup of sugar and 
two ciq^s of water for ^^ea?-^ and lai'(/e fruits. Pour the 
S3'rup boiling hot into the hot jars, boil five minutes, and 
seal at once. 

Strawberries^ plums ^ and cherries will require more 
sugar. Cherries should be stoned, but the stones may be 
used if liked. 

Quinces^ apples^ hard peaches^ pears ^ and fruits which 
require softening, should be cooked in water or in syrup 
until tender. Then fill the jars with boiling syrup, strain* 
ing it if not clear. 

Peaches ma}- be canned whole, or if halved, a few of 
the pits removed and cooked in the syrup to give addi' 
tional flavor. 

Pears should be well ripened and of fine flavor. A taste- 
less, insipid pear is onl}' suitable for sweet pickle. 

Tomatoes should be peeled and cooked till well scalded; 
then salted and sealed at once. 

Always fill to overflowing, using boiling water when 
there is not enough S3'rup. Run the handle of a silver 
tablespoon down the inside of the jar, that the syrup ma}- 
completel}^ surround the fruit. Fasten the covers on se- 
curel}^ and give the screw an extra turn everj^ half-hour 
until the fruit is cold. If the jars be kept bottom up and 
in a dark place, there is hardh* a chance of failure. The 
best qualit}' of thick tin-foil may be used as a cover for 
an}" large-mouthed bottle or jar minus a cover. Fill the 
jar with the fruit and syrup, cover with a large piece of 
tin- foil, work it down over the rim until perfectly smooth 
and tight. If air-tight, there will be a depression in the 
cover as soon as the fruit is cold. Fruit thus covered 
should be kept away from mice, as they will eat the tin- 
foil. 

Canned fruit should be opened some time before using, 
that it may be aerated and the flavor improved. There 
has been a strong feeling against the use of fruit prepared 
in tin cans. Chemists have examined canned fruit as soon 
as opened, and found it harmless ; but if the fruit be left 



Sweet Pickles. 403 



in the tin can, the action of the air causes the acid in the 
fruit to act upon the metal and form a poisonous compound. 
Care should be taken to remove the fruit from the can as 
soon as opened. 

Sweet Pickles. 

Eight pounds of fruit, four pounds of best brown sugar ^ 
Me quart of vinegar, and o?ie cup of mixed whole spices, 
— stick cinnamo/i, cassia buds, allsjnce, and cloves / less 
of the latter than of the former. Tie the spices in a bag, 
and boil with the vinegar and sugar. Skim well ; then add 
the fruit. Cook ten minutes, or till scalded and tender 
Skim out the fruit, and put into stone jars. Boil the S3rup 
five minutes longer, and pour over the fruit. The next 
da\' pour off the syrup and boil down again, and do 
this for three mornings. Keep the bag of spices in the 
syrup. 

Tomatoes. — Scald, remove the skins, and cook without 
breaking if possible. 

Peaches. — Scald or wipe off the *' wool," and leave 
them whole. Do not stick them with cloves. If very 
ripe, merel}' pour the hot S3'rup over them on three suc- 
cessive mornings. 

Pears. — Select sound fruit, not too ripe. Pare, and 
leave them whole with the stems on. Cook till tender. 

Pipe Cucumber or Watermelon Pind. — Cut the pared 
rind into thick slices. Boil one ounce of cdum in one gal- 
lon :ifioater, pour it on the rinds, and let them stand in it 
several hours on the back of the stove. Take out into 
cold water, and when cold boil them half an hour in the 
3weet pickle. 

Pipe Mushmelon or Canteloupe. — Pare, and cut into 
thick slices. Pour the boiling syrup over them. The 
next morning pour off the S3Tup, boil five minutes, and 
pour it boiling hot over the melon. Repeat this on three 
mornings. 

Pineapple. — Slice it, or with a fork pick it off from 
the centre, in small pieces, and prepare as for melon.

Tomato Catchup. {Mrs. CajnpbeU.} 

Boil 07ie bushel of inpe tomatoes, skins and all, and when 
soft strain through a colander to remove the skins only. 
Mix 07ie cup of salt^ tioo pounds of broiGii sugar^ half an 
ounce of cayenne pepper., three ou7ices each of ground all- 
spice., mace., and celery seed., two ounces of ground china- 
tnon^ and stir into the tomato. Add two quarts of best 
cider vinegar^ and when thoroughly mixed strain through 
a sieve. Pour all that runs through into a large kettle, and 
boil slowly till reduced one half. It is an improvement 
to add a pint of brandy ten minutes before the catchup 
is done, but man}- think it unnecessar3\ Put it in small 
bottles, seal, and keep in a cool, dark place. 

Piccallili, or Chow Chow. 



1 peck green tomatoes. 

1 cup ialt. 

6 small onions. 

1 large head celery. 

2 cups brown sugar. 



1 teaspoonful white pepper. 

1 tablespoonf ul ground cinnamon. 

1 tablespoonful ground allspice. 

1 tablespoonful mustard. 

2 quarts good, sharp vinegar. 



Chop the tomatoes, mix the salt with them thoroughly, 
and let them stand over night. In the morning pour off 
the water, and chop the onion and celery. Mix the sugar, 
pepper, cinnamon, and mustard. Put in a porcelain kettle 
a la3^er of tomatoes, onion, celery, and spices, and so on 
until all is used, and cover with the vinegar. Cook slowly 
all day, or until the tomatoes are soft. Cauliflower, or 
cabbage, or one quart of cucumbers may be used with the 
tomatoes. Sliced or grated horseradish gives a pleasant 
flavor. 

Pickled Cucumbers. {Mbs Harriott Ward.) 

To 07ie hu7uhed a7id fifty small-sized cucumbers take 
one pi7it of salt, dissolved in boiling water to cover them. 
I^et them remain in a covered vessel for fortj^-eight hours. 
Then drain, and wipe each one carefully. Put them in a 
pickle-pot or firkin with 07ie large onio7i, peeled and 



Mixed Pickles.

stuck full of cloves, one green pepper^ some scraped horse- 
racUs/i, aud a small bit of alum. Boil vinegar enough 
to cover them. Fill a muslin bag with one cup of mixed 
spices^ — lohole cloves, tohole allspice, pjepper corns, stick 



Ginnamon, white mustard seed, aud a flake of mace, aud 
boil ten minutes with the vinegar. Put this bag in the 
firkin when 3'ou pour on the boiling vinegar. 

AVhen cucumbers are gathered fresh from the vines 
ever}' da^-, the\- ma^- be kept in brine till wanted. Make 
the brine strong enough to float an egg, — a pint of coarse 
salt and six quarts of boiling water, boiled and skimmecl 
clear. Pick the cucumbers as th'ej' ripen, wash carefullj- 
without removing the prickles, leave a bit of the stem on, 
and keep them covered with the brine. Soak, as required, 
in fresh cold water two days, aud pour boiling spiced 
vinegar over them. 



Mixed Pickles. {Mrs. Poor.) 



150 small cucumbers. 
1 quart small martinoes. 
1 quart small button onions. 
1 medium cauliflower. 
Rind of )2 watermelon. 
3 pints green string beans. 

3 cups salt. 

4 quarts cold water, 

34 pound horseradish root. 
1 tablespoonful white mustard 
seed. 



1 tablespoonful stick cinnamon, 

broken into half-inch pieces. 
1 tablespoonful whole cloves. 
3^2 tablespoonful peppercorns. 
3^2 tablespoonful allspice. 
% tablespoonful whole mace. 

1 teasjioonful celery seed. 

2 quarts white wine vinegar. 

1 ounce alum. 

2 quarts boiling water. 
1 gill alcohol. 



Wipe the cucumbers and martinoes with a damp cloth. 
Cut the cucmnbers lengthwise into quarters, and the mar- 
tinoes into halves. Scald and peel the onions ; wash the 
cauliflower, watermelon rind, and beans ; break the cauli- 
flower into' small pieces, and cut the melon rind about 
the size of the pieces of cucumber. Dissolve the salt in 
the cold water. Put the pickles in a large earthen or 
tight wooden vessel, and pour the brine over them ; if they 
are not covered, add more cold water. Put a large earthen 
plate over them, with a clean brick or stone to keep them 



4o6 The Boston Cook Book. 

under the brine. Let them stand two da3's, remove them 
from the brine, and wash in cold water. Wash and scrape 
the horseradish root. Pack the pickles in a stone jar or 
firkin. Put all the spices into a bag made of strainer cloth. 
Boil the vinegar, spices, and alum in a porcelain kettle ten 
minutes, skim carefully, add the boiling water, and pour 
immediately over the pickles. If a stronger spice be 
desired, leave the bag on the top of the pickles. Set them 
in a cold place, with the plate and weight over them to 
keep them under the vinegar. In about two weeks add 
the alcohol, and in four weeks they will be ready to use. 

Mustard Pickles. {Mrs. John Sheldon.) 

Equal quantities of small cucumbers.^ the largest ones 
sliced, green tomatoes sliced, cauliflower picked into flow- 
erets, and small button onio7is. Keep them covered with 
strongl3" salted water twenty-four hours. In the morning 
scald the brine, and dissolve in it a bit of alum the size of 
a nutmeg. Pour the boiling brine over the pickles. When 
cold, drain thoroughly and prepare as much vinegar as 
there were quarts of brine. To one quart of vinegar 
use one cup of broion sugar., half a cup of flour, and one 
fourth oi a pound of ground mustard. Boil the sugar and 
vinegar. Mix the flour and mustard, and stir the boiling 
vinegar into it, and when smooth pour it over the pickles. 

Canned Fruit. {Mrs. John Sheldon.) 

Put the prepared fruit in a jar, and cover with boiUng 
s^Tup sweetened to taste. On three successive mornings 
drain off the syrup, boil again, and pour over the fruit. 
The last morning, let fruit and syrup come just.to the boil- 
ing-point, but do not boil ; then seal immediately. Fruit 
prepared in this way has been tested by the author and 
found perfect. Strawberries preserve their shape and 
never ferment. 



Invalid Cookery, 407 




GENERAL HINTS ON CARING AND 
COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 

Ventilation. — The first condition of comfort and re- 
covery to the patient is tliat the room be perfectly ven- 
tilated, either directly- or from fresh air in an adjoining 
room. A sunn}' exposure and an open fire, and in sum- 
mer an open fireplace, are essential aids. After all 
these points are secured, care must be taken that the air 
be not vitiated b}* anything in the room. Growing plants 
are more healthful than cut flowers ; unless the room be 
large and air}', the latter should not be allowed for any 
length of time, and even then should be removed as soon 
as their freshness is gone. If possible, avoid having a 
kerosene lamp in a sick-room. The odor is irritating to 
the mucous membrane, and in some conditions positively 
harmful. The wick should never be turned below the 
point of free combustion, either in the room of the sick 
or well. If you wish a dim light, place the lamp outside 
the door, or shade it b}- a screen. Never turn it down, 
as it will inevitabl}' vitiate the atmosphere. 

Avoid noise in replenishing the fire, by bringing the 
coal in a paper bag, and putting bag and all upon the 
fire. Keep all medicines and everything suggestive of a 
sick-room out of sight. 

The Bed. — Arrange the bed so that the patient may 
be shielded from any draught Neither sun nor lamp 
light should shine directly in the eyes. Whenever it is 
possible, change the position of the bed, furniture, and 
pictures, that the eye ma}' have something new and inter- 
esting to dwell upon, if such changes interest instead of 



4o8 The Boston Cook Booh, 

distress the invalid. Two small beds, that the patient 
may find relief in change, are desirable ; or, if possible, 
procure an invalid's bed, which admits of many changes of 
position and the airing and changing of the bed with no 
accompanying fatigue. 

Cleanliness. — It is of the first importance that the bed 
linen and clothing of the patient should be kept fresh by 
frequent changes, and thoroughly dried and aired. Be 
careful to supply the needed warmth by light but not over- 
abundant clothing. The patient should be batlied freely ; 
avoid a chill by giving a sponge bath with alcohol and 
warm water, exposing only a part of the body at a time to 
the air, and rub till perfectly dry. 

Wet a cotton-flannel bag, made w4th the nap side out, 
in cold water, wring it slightly, and tie it over the broom 
to use in sweeping. Be careful to wash it every time it is 
used. It is quite essential that the floor of a sick-room 
should be kept clean. Remove all dust with a damp 
cloth. The cleansing, drying, or airing of all objects 
should be done outside of the sick-room. Keep the 
room, the bed, the patient, and everything about yourself 
absolutely neat and clean. 

Conversation. — In extreme sickness let no unnecessary 
word be spoken in a sick-room, and no needless, noisy, 
nor abrupt movements be made. Let the voice be calm 
and clear, neither loud nor wliispering. In speaking to 
the patient do so in the way that requires the least efibrt 
in response, and never consult him about his food. Avoid 
all discussions of the disease, the medicine, and any excit- 
ing topic either with or before him. Do not excite the 
patient by needless conversation with the doctor outside of 
the sick-room. Never whisper, even when the patient is 
asleep or in delirium, because a whisper is more penetrat- 
ins: than a low full tone. During convalescence do not 
weary with conversation ; let it always be bright and cheer- 
ful, and, as far as possible, of things outside the sick-room. 
Cultivate the power of talking to^ rather than with, a sick 
person. 



Care of Invalids. 409 



Conveniences in a Sick- Room. — "In severe sickness 
a glass tube is useful for feeding drinks and gruels ; and 
little white china boats with spouts are also good. A 
wooden traj with legs six or seven inches high, to stand 
upon the bed, is ver}- convenient for serving meals." 

To keep Ice for a Sick-Mooni. — Tie a square of coarse 
white flannel over a pitcher, leaving a cup-shaped depres- 
sion of the flannel in the pitcher. Put broken ice in the 
flannel, and cover it tightly with a thicker flannel. The 
ice will keep all night, and the water may be poured oflT as 
wanted. 

In applying hot bandages dip the flannel in boiling 
water, place it in the centre of a coarse towel, and twist 
and wring the ends of the towel ; or place the flannels in a 
steamer over hot water until penetrated with the steam ; 
they will then need no wringing. 

Feeding the Patient. — When feeding the patient, do it 
gently and neatly. Anticipate his wants, and let the food 
be a surprise as far as practicable. In severe sickness give 
nourishment in a small quantity often^ and never fail to 
give it immediately' after a long sleep. During convales- 
cence food should be given at longer, but regular intervals. 
If the patient be unable to use a toothbrush, wet a bit of 
soft cloth and wipe the teeth and gums, and give a little 
water or acid drink to soften the diy mucous membrane 
and destroy the bad taste in the mouth, before offering 
an}' food. 

Let everything prepared for the invalid be arranged to 
please the eye as well as the palate. Serve less than you 
think the patient requires, and give as much variet}' as 
possible, serving in diff'erent forms or in diff"erent dishes 
if the material must be the same. Hot liquids should be 
hot when the}' reach the patient, not merel}' when they 
leave the kitchen. Serve them in a hot pitcher, and pour 
only a little into the hot cup or bowl, and so avoid its run- 
ning over into the saucer or too rapid cooling. Never 
insult the patient by oflfering him a slice of dough covered 
with charcoal, under the name of toasL When the meal \^ 



4IO The Boston Cook Book. 

over, remove immediatel}^ ever}^ trace of food from the 
room. Keep in the sick-room choice fruit or an}- deUca- 
cies which have been sent to the patient only long enough 
to gratify" the eye, then remove to a cool place, and serve 
as fresh and daintil}' as possible. 

Wines or liquors of an}' kind should never be given 
without the advice of a ph} sician. Young persons do not 
need them, and, in an}^ form of fever, stimulants are posi- 
tively harmful. In some extreme cases, among ver}' old 
people, or where there is a great lack of recuperative 
power, they may be given. 

Visitors. — Visitors should never be admitted to a sick- 
room, except with the consent of the physician. Never 
visit a sick-room when in a violent perspiration or with 
an empty stomach, as then the system more readilj^ re- 
ceives contagion. If obliged to sit up all night with a 
patient, provide yourself with something to eat, if nothing 
more than a cake of chocolate, that there may be no 
needless exhaustion. 

Not the least of the many qualifications desirable in a 
good nurse is a thorough knowledge of the nature, use, and 
digestibility, as well as the best methods of preparing dif- 
ferent kinds of food, and of their adaptation to different 
forms of disease. Such knowledge is of still greater im- 
portance to every physician, and fully as essential as the 
study of drugs. Nurses, alas ! are often wholly unquali- 
fied, or not to be obtained at all ; and then that patient 
is fortunate, indeed, who has a physician who can in 
emergency fill the treble office of nurse, cook, and doctor. 



Diet for the Invalid. 

Mrst Condition. — Sometimes the system from over- 
taxation, either mental or physical, needs a period of 
complete rest or comparative inaction ; or, as in the com- 
mencement of many forms of sickness, the diet should be 
food which merely satisfies the hunger and which soothes 
jvnd reduces inflammation and quenches thirst, but does 



Gruels, 411 



not nourish nor stimulate. Foods proper at such times 
come under the head of starchy gruels, gelatinous soups 
and jellies, oranges, grapes, etc., and mucilaffioous, aci(J, 



and aromatic drinks. 



Flour or Arrowroot Gruel. 

1 cup boiling water. I 2 teaspoonfuls flour, wet in cold 

1 saltspoonful salt. j water. 

Cornstarch and rice-flour gruels are made in a similar 
manner. Use a little more of wheat flour than of the 
others. 

Mix the flour and salt, and make into a smooth thin 
paste with cold water, then stir it into the boiling w^ater. 
Cook five minutes, or until the desired consistenc}' is ob- 
tained. Strain ; then add sugm\ if preferred, and thin 
with a little milk. If intended for a fever patient, a little 
leynon juice improves the flavor ; if for a patient with sum- 
mer complaint, boil with the gruel half mi inch stick of 
cinnamon or a little nutmeg^ — the spice will help to re- 
duce the laxative condition. Sick people soon tire of 
sweets, and gruels should be sweetened onl}^ slightly-, if 
at all. Flour and starch}- gruels should not be given in 
t3'phoid fever, or when the disease is located in the intes- 
tines. Nor should they ever be used in excess, as, being 
rapidly swallowed, they are unaflected b}^ the alkaline 
action of the saliva, and pass through the stomach un- 
changed and severely tax the intestines. They should 
be kept in the mout^ and mingled with the saliva before 
swallowing. 

Milk Porridge. 

2 dozen raisins, quartered. I 1 tablespoonful flour. 
2 cups milk. | Salt to taste. 

Boil the raisins in a little water twenty minutes. Let 
the water boil away, and add the milk. When boiling, 
add the flour rubbed to a thin paste with a Httle cold 
milk. Boil eight or ten minutes. Season with salt and 



412 The Boston Cook Booh 

strain. Or omit tiie raisins, and add sugar to taste ; 
or add the beaten white of one egg after it comes from 
the stove. 

Barley Gruel. 

Boil one ounce oi peari barley a few minutes, to cleanse 
it. Pour off the water, add one quart of cold water and 
half a teasjpoonful of salt^ and simmer one hour, or until 
reduced one half. Strain it ; sweeten to taste, and add a 
little lemon or nutmeg^ if desired. Barley contains muci- 
lage, and is soothing and refreshing in fevers and gastric 
inflammation. 

Indian Meal Gruel. 

1 tablespoonful flour. I 1 teaspoonful salt. 

2 tablespoonfuls corn meal. | 1 quart boiling water* 

Mix the flour, meal^ and salt. Make into a thin paste 
with a little cold water, and stir into the boiling water. 
Boil tliirt}' minutes, stirring often ; thin with milk oi 
cream. Milk ma}^ be used instead of water by mak- 
ing the gruel in a double boiler. Indian meal gruel 
reqiures longer time for cooking than an}' purely starch} 
gruels. 

No, 2. — Wet one heaping teaspoonful of meal and 
one saltspoonful of salt in a little cold water, and stir into 
one ciqj of boiling icater. Boil slowly thirty minutes. 

Indian corn meal is heating in its nature, and should 
never be given where there is any inflammatory condition 
of the system. If given during convalescence after scarlet 
fever, it sometimes produces glandular swellings. When 
there is a deficiency of natural warmth, and no inflamma- 
tion, it may be given without harm. 

Oatmeal Gruel. 

2 tablespoonfuls oatmeal. I 1 quart boiling water. 
^ teaspoonful salt. | 

Boil one hour. Strain, and serve with m,ilk or cream. 



Gruels. 413 



No. 2. — Pound half a cup of coarse oatmeal until it is 
mealy. Put it in a tumbler, and fill the tumbler with cold 
water. Stir well ; let it settle ; then pour off the mealy 
water into a saucepan. Fill again, and pour off the water, 
and again repeat this, being careful each time not to dis- 
turb the sediment in the bottom of tiie tumbler. Then boil 
the water twent}^ minutes. Add one saltspoonful of salt. 
If very thick, add a little cream or milk. Strain and serve 
hot. Beef essence or beef tea may be used in place of cream. 
This is the most palatable and convenient way of making 
gruel from oatmeal. "^ 



Farina Gruel. 



1 tablespoonful Hecker's farina. 
1 saltspoonful salt. 



1 cup boiling water. 
1 cup milk. 




Put all but the milk in the double boiler, and cook fifteen 
minutes, or until it thickens, then add the milk and boil 
again. Sweeten to taste. 

Farina is a granuluted preparation of the inner portion 
of the finest wheat, freed from bran and floury dust. It 
contains nitrogenous or flesh-forming material, is easily 
digested, and is a more nutritive food for invalids and 
children than cornstarch, sago, arrowroot, or tapioca, 
which contain onl}- starch. 

Cracker Gruel. 

4 tablesp. powdered cracker. I 1 cup milk. 

1 cup boiling water. | 1^ teaspoonful SAlt 

Boil up once and serve. 

Egg Gruel, 

1 e^g (yolk beaten well). I 1 cup hot milk. 

1 teaspoonful sugar. j White of egg, beaten till foamy. 

Flavor with nutmeg or lemon. Good for a violent cold 
if taken very hot after retiring. 



414 The Boston Cook Book, 



Panada, No. 1. 



1 cup stoned raisins. 

1 quart water. 

2 slices toasted bread, or 



1 cup bread crumbs. 

2 eggs. 

1 tablespoonf ul sugar. 



Boil the raisins one hour. Skim out the raisins, and 
add the bread to the boihng water ; boil fifteen minutes, 
stirring well. Beat the eggs, add the sugar, and pour the 
panada over them, stirring all the time. 

]Sfo, 2. — Split tioo Boston or Graham crackers. Put 
them into a bowl, sprinkle with sugar and salt^ and cover 
with boiling 2vate7\ Set the bowl in a pan of boiling 
water for half an hour, or until the crackers are clear. 
Shde them out into a hot saucer, and serve very hot with 
sugar and cream. 

No. 3. — Boil one tahlespoonful of cracker crumbs five 
minutes in one cup of boiling water., slightly sweetened^ 
salted^ and flavored with lemon. 

Oatmeal Mush for Children or Invalids. 

1 cup granulated oatmeal. I 1 scant quart boiling water. 

^ teaspoonf ul salt. | 

Put the meal and salt in the double boiler, pour on the 
boiling water, and cook two or three hours. Remove 
the cover just before serving, and stir with a fork to let the 
steam escape. If the water in the lower boiler be strongly 
salted, the meal will cook more quickly. Serve with sugar., 
or salt., and cream.. Baked sour apples^ ajjple sauce, and 
apple jelly are delicious eaten with the oatmeal. They 
should be served with the mush, and the cream and sugar 
poured over the whole. They give the acid iavor which 
so many crave in the morning. 

Coarse oatmeal is not suitable for any form of water 
brash, acidity, or bowel irritation. It often causes erup- 
tions on the skin in waim weather. 



Mushes, 415 



Indian Meal Mush. 

1 cup com meal. I 1 cup cold milk. 

% teaspoonf ul salt. | 1 pint boiling water. 

Mix the meal and salt with the cold milk. Stir this 
gradiiall}^ into the boiling water. Cook half an hour in a 
double boiler, stirring often. 

Graham Mush. 

Mix half a cup of Graham flour and half a teaspoon* 
ful of salt. Make it into a thin sjQooth paste with a little 
cold loater. Stir it into one pint of boiling water. Cook 
twent}' minutes, stirring often. Serve with cream. 

Rye Mush is made in the same manner, and sometimes 
served with molasses. 

Gluten Mush. — Use one cup of gluten to one pint of 
boiling loater^ and cook as above. Being destitute of 
starch, it will not thicken like Rye Mush. 

Brain Food. {Health Food Co.) 

Wet one cup of Brain Food in a little cold water., and 
stir it into one quart of salted boiling water. Cook over 
hot water one to two hours. Eat, hot or cold, with sugar 
and cream. 

Rice Water or Jelly. 

2 tablespoonfuls rice. I Salt and sugar to taste. 
1 quart cold water. | 

Pick over and wash the rice, and cook in water one hour, 
or till the rice is dissolved. Add salt and sugar to taste. 
If intended for jell}', add lemon juice and strain into a 
mould. When cold, serve with sugar and cream. If to 
be used as a drink, add more hot water, enough to make a 
thin liquid, and boil longer. Add half a square inch of 
stick cinnamon^ and strain. Serve hot or cold. 

Rice is easily digested and almost wholly assimilated" 
it is good in diarrhoea or dysentery. 



41 6 The Boston Cook Book, 



1 tablespoonful lemon juice. 
1 heaping tablespoonful sugar. 



Tapioca Jelly. 

)^ cup pearl tapioca. 
1 pint cold water. 
1 saltspoonful salt. 

Pick over and wash the tapioca. Add the cold water, 
and cook in a double boiler until entirel}' dissolved. Then 
add the salt, lemon juice, and sugar. Turn into a mould. 
Serve with sugar and cream. Half a cup of strawberry, 
raspberry, or blackberry jam or currant jelly may be used 
in place of lemons. 

Irish Moss Jelly. 

% cup Irish moss. I 1 lemon. 

1 pint boiling water. | % cup sugar. 

Soak the moss in cold water until soft. Pick over and 
wash again. Then put it into the boiling water, and sim- 
mer until it is dissolved. Add the lemon juice and sugar. 
Strain into a mould. Use currant jelly in place of lemon, 
or steep j/^oi^r or Jive figs with the moss. 

Sea mosses contain bromine and iodine, and are useful 
in rheumatic affections. Iceland moss may be used in the 
same manner. This, when dried, contains more starch 
than potatoes, and more flesh food than oatmeal or corn. 



2 tablespoonf uls lemon juice. 

3 tablespoonfuls sugar. 
2 cloves. 



Restorative Jelly. 

3^ box gelatine. 
1 cup port wine. 
1 tablesp. powdered gum arable. 

Put all together in a glass jar, and cover closely. Place 
the jar on a trivet in a kettle of cold water. Heat it slowly, 
and when the mixture is dissolved, stir well and strain. 
Pour into a shallow dish, and when cool cut it into small 
squares. This is good for an old person or a very weak 
patient. 

Mutton Broth. 

To make it quickly for an invalid, chop one pound of 
Uan juicy mutton very fine ; pour over it one pint of cold 



Invalid Cookery. 417 



water. Let it stand until the water is very red, then heat 
it slowly. Let it simmer ten minutes. Strain, season, and 
add two tablespoonfuls of soft-boiled rice, or thicken it 
slightly with rice flour wet with cold water. Serve hot. 
When given to a person with a severe cold, or a consump- 
tive, the fat should not be removed, as it, is soothing to 
the chest, and when absorbed b}' the rice or some starchy 
material is not uninviting to the eye. For a fever patient, 
tne fat should be removed. When you have not time to 
cool the broth, a piece of soft tissue paper passed over the 
surface helps to take up any globules of fat which wjjl-^rr^-:^ 
not come off with a spoon. 

Barley Soup. 

Remove the fat and bones from one pound of the nech of 
mutton. Cut the meat into dice, and add to it one table- 
spoonful of well-ioashed barley and one pint of cold water. 
Heat slowl}', and simmer two hours. Put the bones into 
one cup of cold loater, and boil gentl}^ half an hour. Then 
strain into the meat and barley. Season with salt. Skim 
off the fat, and serve with lohole-wheat or gluten wafers. 




Calves'-Foot Jelly or Broth. 



4 calves' feet. 

4 quarts cold water. 

1 cup sugar. 

2 lemons. 



2 inch stick cinnamon. 
1 inch blade mace. 

3 eggs (whites and shells). 
1 pint wine. 



Scald the feet, and clean thoroughly-. Split, break the 
bones, and put them into the cold water. Heat slowly, 
and simmer gently until reduced to three pints. Strain, 
and when cool remove the fat. Add the other ingredients 
except the wine. Put it over the fire, and stir until hot. 
Let it boil five minutes, or till a thick scum has formed. 
Set it back on the stove ; skim, and add the wine. Strain 
through a fine napkin into a shallow dish. When ready to 
serve, cut it into blocks, or break it up lightly with a fork. 
If intended for broth, simply remove the fat, season to

taste, and stir it into a beaten egg ; or add sago or tapi- 
oca, having first soaked and boiled it till soft. Veal broth 
is not ver}' palatable in itself; and as it does not contain 
the nutritive qualities of beef or mutton broth, it is not 
well to use it in the sick-room except for a variety. 

Chicken Jelly or Broth. 

Clean a small chicken. Disjoint and cut the meat into 
half-inch pieces. Remove all the fat. Break or pound the 
bones. Dip the feet into boiling water, and scald until the 
skin and nails will peel off. The feet contain gelatine, and 
when well cleaned ma3^be used for jelly. Cover the meat, 
feet, and bones with cold water ; heat very slowly, and sim- 
mer till the meat is tender. Strain, and when cool remove 
the fat. Season with salt^ pepper., and lemo7i, and add the 
shell and ichite of 07ie egg. Put it over the fire, and stir 
well until hot. Let it boil five minutes. Skim, and strain 
through a fine napkin. Pour it into small cups, and cool 
it if intended for jelly. When the patient can take it, 
small dice of the breast meat may be moulded in the jelly. 
Serve hot, without clearing, if intended for broth. 

Beef Jelly or Broth. 

Prepare the same as for Bouillon (page 131). If in- 
tended for jelly, clear it as directed for Clear Soup. 

Barley "Water. 



1 tablespoonful pearl barley. 
3 blocks sugar. 



lo lemon. 

1 quart boiling water. 



Wash the bade}' in cold water, then pour off the water, 
and put the barle}', sugar, and lemon into the boiling water, 
and let it stand covered and warm for three hours ; then 
strain it. Currant jelly or orange juice ma}' be used in- 
stead of lemon. This is a valuable demulcent in colds, 
affections of the chest, hectic fever, strangur}^ and other 
diseases of the bladder or urinar}' organs. 



Invalid Cookery, 419 



Gum Water. 

1 ounce clean gum arable, and I 1 pint boiling water. 

lo ounce sugar, dissolved in j 1 lemon (juice). 

When dissolved, add the lemon juice, and strain through 
a fine strainer. This is soothing in inflammation of the 
mucous membrane. 

Toast Water. — Toast one pint of white or brown bread 
crusts \ev\ brown, but be careful not to burn them ; add 
one pint of cold water ; let it stand for one hour, then 
strain, and add cream and sugar to taste. The nourish- 
ment in the bread is easily absorbed when taken in this 
liquid form. 

Crust Coffee. — Pour one pint of boiling water over 
two slices of brown toast. Steep ten minutes, and strain. 
Add sugar and cream to taste. 

Corn Tea and Hice Coff^ee. — Brown one cup of dried 
sweet corn or rice. Pound or grind it fine. Add. one pint 
of cold water ^ and steep it one hour. Strain, and serve 
with sugar and cream. These are pleasant and nourishing 
beverages. 

Slippery-Elm Tea. — Pour one cup of boiling water 
upon one teaspoonful of slippery-elm poioder or a piece 
of the bark. When cool, strain and flavor with lemon 
juice and sugar. This is soothing in any inflammation 
of the mucous membrane. 

Acid Fruit Drinks. 

Pour boiling water on mashed cranberries., barberries., 
or whortleberries. When cold, strain, and sweeten to taste. 

No. 2. — Stir a tablespoonful of any acid jelly or fruit 
syrup into one tumbler of ice icater. 

JVo. 3. — Dissolve 07ie tablespoonful of cream of tartar 
in one p)int o^ water. Sweeten to taste. 

Apple Tea. — Roast two large sour apples., cover with 
boiling water ; when cool, pour off the water and strain. 
Add sugar to taste-

Jelly and Ice. — With a large needle or pin, chip half a 
cup of ice into bits as large as a pea. Mix with it about 
the same quantity of lemon, currant^ blackberry, or bar- 
berry jelly. Ver}^ refreshing in fevers. 

Tamarind Water. — Boil tivo ounces of taniarinds with 
four ounces of stoned raisins in three pints of tcater for 
one hour. Strain and cool. 

Baked Lemon. — Bake a lemon or sour orawje twenty 
minutes in a moderate oven. Wiien done, open at one 
end and take out the inside. Sweeten with sugar or mo- 
lasses. This is excellent for hoarseness. 

Lemonade. — Squeeze the juice from one lemon and 
add one tablespoonful of sugar. Pour on one cup) of 
boiling water, and take hot for a cold, after retiring. 

Flaxseed Lemonade. — Pour one quart of boiling icater 
ovevfour tablespoonfuls of tchole flaxseed, and steep three 
hours. Strain and sweeten to taste, add the juice of two 
lemons and more water if too thick. 

Irish-Moss Lemonade. — Soak, pick over, and wash 
one quarter of a cup of L'ish moss. Pour on one pint 
of boiling water and cook in double boiler half an hour. 
Strain, add lemon juice and sugar to taste. 

Whey. — Dissolve 1 junket tablet in 1 tablespoon cold 
water, warm one quart of pure unscalded milk to blood 
heat, add tablet, keep in warm room, when jellied stir 
till the curd separates, strain and sweeten the water, or 
not, and serve cold. 

Wine Whey. — Boil one cup of new milk, and add one 
cup of wine. Let it stand on the back of the stove five 
minutes. Strain, and sweeten the whey. 

The whey, or water, of milk contains the sngar, palt, 
and other saline bodies necessary for digestion and the 
repair of the mineral part of the body. 

Herb Teas. 

Pour one cup of boiling icater over one tablespoonful of 
the herbs. Cover the bowl, set it over the teakettle, and 



Feeding the Patient, 421 

steep ten minutes. Sweeten if desired. Mullein tea is 
good for inflammation of the lungs ; CItanioinile tea^ for 
sleeplessness ; Calamus and Catnip tea^ for colds and 
infants' colic ; Cinnamon tea^ for hemorrhages ; Water' 
melo7i-seed and PiunjyJdn-seed tea^ for strangury and 
summer complaint. A few sprigs of sage^ bitrnet^ bahn^ 
and sorrel^ half a lemon ^ sliced, and three pints oi boiling 
water, sweetened to taste, and covered closely until cold, 
makes an agreeable drink for a fever patient. 

Another Condition in sickness occurs when, after long 
continued, prostrating, or rapidly wasting disease, the sys- 
tem demands immediate nourishment to supply' that waste, 
or when there is a lack of nutrition from any cause. Food 
that contains the most nourishment in the most easih' as- 
similated form is now needed ; but the physician should 
always be consulted as to the food suitable during the dif- 
ferent diseases. Liquid food is most suitable, and should 
\)^food as well as drink. In nearl}^ all cases of fever milk 
is given when the patient can take it. Two or three grains 
of pepsin in a cup of milk or broth facilitate its digestion. 
In typhoid fever milk has often proved of great value, and 
is now generall}' recommended by the medical faculty in all 
cases of scarlet fever, nervous disorder, and all diseases 
arising from imperfect nutrition. It keeps up the strength 
of the patient, acts well upon the stomach, soothes the in- 
testines, and promotes sleep. It should be taken slowly to 
prevent the curdling in a dense mass which may occur if too 
much be taken at once. A pint of hot milk taken slowly, 
every four hours, will often check the most violent diar- 
rhoea and dysenter}'. It should never be boiled, only 
scalded. 

Eggnog or broth, meat broth, farina and oatmeal gruel, 
and port wine jell}^ are all suitable at such times ; but beef 
juice and tea are most generally used by physicians. They 
alford a fluid and easily assimilated form of food, and have 
a remarkable power of restoring the vigorous action of the 
heart, and dissipating the sense of exhaustion following 




422 The Boston Cook Book. 

severe, prolonged exertion. When taken alone, t\\QY are 
stimulating rather than nutritive, and a patient would soon 
starve if he did not have the addition of the fibrine of the 
meat or of some farinaceous food, like bread crumbs or 
oatmeal. 

Beef Essence and Beef Tea. 

' Beef essence is the pure juice of the meat. This is giver^. 
where a patient needs much nourishment in a small com- 
pass. Beef tea is the juice of the meat diluted with water. 
It is a mistake to think that any beef l)ecause it is lean 
or cheap is good enough for beef tea. It will do for the 
soup-kettle, but not for those who are ill. Meat for beef 
tea should be lean, juic}', and of good flavor. Ever}- par- 
ticle of fat, skin, and membrane must be removed. The 
top of the round and the back and middle of the rump con- 
tain the most and the best-flavored juice. It costs more 
per pound than some other pieces ; but as it yields nearly 
double the amount of juice, it is realh' cheaper. The ten- 
derloin is often recommended for sick persons. It should 
never be used for beef tea, as it contains ver}' little juice 
and lacks flavor. When the tender fibre of the meat is 
desired, it ma}' be broiled, and served with the juice from 
some tougher steak. 

Broiling is the quickest, and sometimes the most 
palatable, wa}' of preparing both essence and tea in an 
emergenc}'. 

Dravnng and heating the meat and juice is best where 
a little nourishment is to be given often, and where all the 
elements of the meat are needed. Soaking in cold water, 
then straining, and heating the juice onlj', is the most 
economical way, as more than twice the usual amount of 
juice may be obtained b}' adding more water when the 
meat has not been heated. 

The albuminous juices of meat coagulate at 160° ; if the 
tea be allowed to boil, the}' become hard, and settle almost 
immediately when served. Man}' make the mistake of 
straining the tea, or leaving the sediment untouched. If 



Beef Essence. 423 



the tea be heated Just enough to make it palatable, it will 
hold the juices in solution, not separated, and will be thick, 
and of the color of chocolate, and much more palatable 
and nutritious than when boiled. 

Broiled JBeef Essence. — Broil half a pound of round 
steak one or two minutes, or until the juice will flow. Cut 
it into small pieces. Squeeze the juice into a bowl placed 
over warm water. Salt., and serve without reheating. Or 
pour it over a slice of hot dry toast. 

Broiled Beef Tea. — Add half a cup of hoilhig water 
to the meat after broiling as above. 

Bottled Beef Essence, — Put tico pounds of round 
steak., cut in small pieces, into a jar without water. Place 
the jar, covered closel3', on a trivet in a kettle of cold 
water. Heat gradually, and keep it not quite at the 
boiUng-point for two hours, or till the meat is white. 
Strain, pressing the meat to obtain all the juice ; season 
with salt. Or place the jar in a moderate oven for three 
hours. The liquid thus obtained contains all the nutritive 
parts of the meat. It may be kept in the refrigerator, 
and a small portion heated (not boiled), as wanted. Or it 
may be made into beef tea b}' diluting with boiling water. 
Beef essence given ice cold is sometimes more agreeable 
to a fever patient. 

Bottled Beef Tea. — Add one cup of cold water to the 
meat in the jar, and make as above. When the patient 
can take a little solid food, add two tahlespooiifuls of 
stale bread crumbs to the beef tea, or mix with it oat- 
meal gruel., or add one teaspoon fid oi finely chopped raw 
meat. 

Stewed Beef Essence, — Cut half a pound of round 
steak into small pieces, season with 07ie saltspoonful of 
salt^ press it with a pestle or potato-masher, and let it 
stand in a covered bowl half an hour. Pour off the juice, 
and heat, but do not boil it. Serve immediatelj', without 
straining. 

As the salt without water will draw out only a small 
portion of the juice from the meat, a beef tea may be made 



424 The Boston Cook Book, 

from the scraps of meat left by adding ojie cup of cold 
water to the meat, and letting it stand two hours. Then 
strain and heat the liquid ; or the scraps of meat maj' be 
put in the soup-kettle. 

Economical Beef Tea. — Cut one pound oi juicy rump 
steak into small pieces, and add one cup of cold water. 
Let it stand in a covered bowl several hours. When 
ready to serve, squeeze the meat and put it into another 
bowl. Strain the juice alread^^ obtained, add salt to taste, 
and heat it just enough to be palatable, but not enough to 
curdle it. Serve at once, while hot. If it be heated over 
the fire, stir constantly, and take it otf the moment it looks 
thick and is hot ; or heat it carefully over hot water. Add 
another cup of cold water to the scraps of meat, and soak 
again. Often the third cup of tea may be obtained from 
the same meat. This is excellent for hard-working people 
to take, in times of great exhaustion, before a hearty meal 
It is one of the best and most easil}' prepared forms of 
soup or meat tea. 

Dr. MitchelVs Beef Tea. — One pound of lean heef cut 
fine ; add one pint of cold water and five drops of muri- 
atic acid. Put into a glass jar. Place the jar in a pan of 
water at 110°, and keep it at that temperature for two 
hours. Then strain through thick muslin until the meat 
is dr}', or press the juice out b}' squeezing. The acid 
makes the tea agreeable to a patient with fever, and also 
aids in drawing out the juices of the meat. 

Baw Beef Sandwiches. — Scrape fine a small piece of 
fresh, juicy, tender, raw beef. Season highly with salt 
and pepper. Spread it on thin slices of bread, put them 
together like a sandwicli, and cut into small squares or 
diamonds. This will often tempt a patient who could not 
otherwise take raw meat. The sandwiches are sometimes 
made more palatable b}' toasting them slightl3\ 

Eggnog. — Beat the yolk of one egg ; add one table- 
spoonful of sugar, and beat to a cream. Add one table- 
spoonfid of wine or brandy., and half a cup of milk. Beat 
the white of the ^gg to a froth, and stir in lightly. Omit 



Beef Tea. 425 



the milk when more condensed nourishment is required, 
or the wine, if not approved by the physician. It is more 
palatable when made with the milk. Whipped cream may 
be substituted for the milk. In many cases it is desirable 
not to have the white beaten to a froth, as it causes wind 
in the stomach. 

.Portable Beef Tea. — Two pounds of heef^ cut fine, 
and half a box of gelatine. Soak together in one pint of 
cold water one hour, squeezing often. Heat to nearly the 
boiling-point. Strain, pressing all the juice from the meat, 
(ill a glass jar with the juice, place the jar in water, 
and heat till the water outside the jar boils. Seal while 
hot. Dissolve two teaspoonfuls of the above prepara- 
tion in half a cup of boiling water., add a few grains of 
salt^ and serve at once. A convenient form of food for 
travellers. 

Broiled Beef Pulp. — Scrape raw beef to a pulp, make 
it into small cakes, and broil as steak. Season with salt 
and a few grains of cayenne pepper^ and serve hot. 

Egg Tea and Coffee. — Beat the yolk of one egg ; add 
one tablespoonful of sugar ^ and beat to a cream ; add one 
cup of tea or coffee ^ either hot or cold, and half a cup of 
cream. Stir in lightly the beaten lohite of the egg, and 
serve at' once. 

Egg and Beef Tea — Add one cup of hot beef tea to 
the egg, beaten as above. 

Dishes for Convalescence. 

When the crisis of disease is past, the s^'stem needs 
gradual but complete nutrition, and the appetite is clamor- 
ous, fickle, or perhaps altogether wanting. Then is th€ 
time most critical for the patient, and most trying to the 
tact, skill, and patience of the nurse. Many a person has 
been carried safely through a long and distressing illness, 
only to succumb at last to injudicious feeding, because of 
the nurse's ignorance or his own indiscretion. When solid 
food can be safely given, the patient ma}' take it in anj' of 
the forms given in the preceding rules. 




426 Tlu Boston Cook Book, 

The following dishes may also be used : broiled squab, 
venison, chicken, chop, steak, salmon, chicken panada, 
boiled halibut, roast beef, mutton, cream toast, eggs, and 
03'sters (except when especially' forbidden by the ph3'si- 
cian), sweetbreads, baked potatoes, asparagus, onions, 
macaroni, custards, Charlotte Russe, snow pudding, ice- 
cream, sherbet, blanc-mange, BaA^arian cream, sponge cake, 
simple puddings, stewed fruits, and man}' otliers, — receipts 
for which will be found as indicated in the table of lessons 
in the Nurse's Course. 

Broiling f 07' the Invalid (^Broiled Steak or Venison), — 
Wipe with a clean wet cloth. Grease the gridiron with a 
bit of the fat. Broil over a clear fire, turning as often as 
3'ou can count ten. Cook four minutes if the steak be 
about one inch thick ; not longer, as further cooking dries 
up the juices and destroys some of the nutritive qualities. 
Be careful to serve on a hot platter, and season v/ith salt^ 
and with pepper and butter if approved. Birds, chicken 
breasts, fish, and chops are better when seasoned, and 
wrapped in buttered paper, and then broiled, as this pre- 
vents them from burning or becoming too dry. Birds, fish, 
and chops are better, and more conveniently eaten, if boned 
before broihng. 

Broiled Steak ^ JSTo. 2. — Broil half a pound of round 
steak and one slice of tenderloin. With a meat or lemon 
squeezer squeeze the juice from the round over the tender- 
loin. Season, and serve hot. 

Chicken Panada. — One cup of cold roasted or boiled 
chicken, pounded to a paste. AM half a cup of stale 
bread crumbs, and enough boiling chicken liquor to make 
it a thick gruel. Salt to taste. Boil one minute, and 
serve hot. When the chicken has been roasted, boil the 
bones to obtain the liquor. 

Chicken Custard. — Scald together one cup of strong 
chicken stock and 07ie cup of cream. Pour it over the 
well-beaten yolks of three eggs, and cook in a double boiler 
till slightly thickened, Salt to taste, and serve cool in 
custard cups,

Crackers and Orange Marmalade. — Toast three crack- 
ers slightly. Dip them quickly into boiling salted water. 
Spread with a little butter^ and put a layer of orange mar- 
malade^ or any other jell}^ or preserve, between them. Set 
them in the oven a few minutes before serving. 

Racahout des Arabes. {Mrs. Devercux.) 

% pound best French chocolate. I )^ pound arrowroot. 

1 pound rice flour. | )^ pound loaf sugar, sifted. 

These materials are to be thoroughly mixed and rubbed 
together. A dessert spoonful of this mixture should be 
slightly wet with milk or icater^ then stirred into one pint 
of boiling milk^ and boiled five minutes. This is excellent 
food for invalids or convalescents. Serve hot, as a bever- 
age ; or make much thicker, to be eaten cold as a delicate 
pudding. 

Laban. {3Iiss Parloa.^ — One quart of 7iew milk., into 
which stir one tablespoonful of yeast. Let it stand in a 
cool place to harden, which will take from three to twent}'- 
four hours. When hard, take a tciblespoonful of the mix- 
ture, and stir it into a quart of new milk^ and set away to 
harden. This is " Laban." It should be eaten with sugar 
and cream. If a constant supply be needed, reserve one 
tablespoonful each da}' for the next preparation. This re- 
ceipt is furnished b}' a lady who obtained it in Syria, and 
who advises a second or a third trial if the first attempt be 
unsuccessful. The dish is often palatable when the stomach 
is too weak for almost an}' other solid food. This is similar 
to Koumiss, or fermented mare's milk. 

Ash Cake. {Mrs. Henderson.) — Wet corn meal^ salted 
to taste, with enough cold loater to make a soft dough. Let 
it stand half an hour, or longer. Mould into a cake one or 
two inches thick, as you prefer. Place it on a clean spot 
on the hearth, and cover with wood ashes. Bake from 
half to three quarters of an hour. Wipe before eating. 
The alkaline properties left by the ashes in the crust render 
it especially good for dyspeptics with an acid stomach.

2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder. 



2 tablespoonfuls sugar. 

1 egg. 

2 cups water or milk. 



Bake in veiy hot buttered gem pans, in a hot oven, half

Diet for Infants and Young Children. 

Let ver}" young children have mother's milk above ever}- 
thing else ; but if this be impossible, dissolve one ounce of 
sugar of milk or loaf sugar in three fourths of a phit of 
boiling water ^ and mix, as required for use, with an equal 
quantity of fresh cow's milk. Give it, slightl}' warm, 
from a sweet, clean bottle. Sugar of milk is quite ex- 
pensive, but it is ver}' much better for an infant than cane 
sugar. 

Teething children should have the milk from but one 
cow ; the cow should not be fed on green corn nor sour 
apples, as these produce aciditj' in the milk. A little 
thin, well-boiled oatmeal, or farina gruel, may be added 
to the milk. 

For summer complaint^ use scalded (not boiled) milk, 
prepared flour, roasted rice, boiled, mashed, and thinned 
with milk ; also rice jell}' or barley gruel. Avoid all purely 
starchy gruels, like arrowroot, sago, and cornstarch, upon 
which many children are fed to death. 

For constipation^ a little salt added to cow's milk is 
often beneficial ; also gruel made from prepared corn meal 
and wheat flour, and oatmeal gruel. For older children 
use oatmeal, hominy or farina mush, and ripe fruit. 

Prepared Flour {for Infants) . — Tie one pint of 
flour in a stout cloth, put it into boiling water, and let it 
boil three hours. Turn out the flour ball, and scrape off 
the gluten which will be found in a mass on the outside of 
the ball and is not desirable. The inside will prove a dry 
powder, which is very astringent. Grate a tahlespoonful 
of this powder from the ball as wanted ; wet it in cold 



Diet for Children. 429 

milk or water^ and stir it into one cup of boiling milk. 
Boil five minutes. Add a little salt. 

This is excellent for teething childi'en. If they be 
troubled with constipation, use 0)ie quarter part corn 
meal and t/tree quarters wheat flom\ boil as above, and 
stir some of the grated lump into hoillng cream and water., 
using one part cream to six parts water. For an infant 
the preparation should be thin enough to be taken from a 
bottle. Flour, after being cooked in this wa}^ and then 
reduced to a fine!}' divided form, loses its adhesiv 
qualit}' ; and the particles are more easily separated an 
digested. 

Children and growing persons need the most nutritious 
food, and plent}' of it at regular intervals ; but nothing 
stimulating nor exciting. The}' should be given, and com- 
pelled to take, sufficient time for eating ; and should be 
taught to masticate everything slowlj' and thoroughl}'. 
The}' should eat milk ; whole-wheat and cornmeal bread ; 
oatmeal, farina, and hominy mush ; plent}' of ripe fruit 
raw, and stewed fruit sweetened ; beef, mutton, veni- 
son, and poultr}', either roasted, broiled, or boiled ; baked 
potatoes, and asparagus ; green peas, beans, and corn, if 
ever}' hull be first broken or cut ; eggs, omelets, and cus- 
tards ; plain sponge cake ; ice-cream, if not too hard 
and cold, and eaten slowly ; simple fruit and bread 
puddings ; fruit, tapioca, and farina ; plain gingerbread 
and molasses cookies ; whole-wheat cookies and wafers. 
Children should avoid hot bread and griddle-cakes ; 
fried meats or cakes or doughnuts ; highly seasoned 
food ; rich gravies ; rich pastry and cake ; pickles, pre- 
serves, all stimulants such as tea or coffee ; raisins, un- 
less cooked three hours and stoned ; sago, arrowroot, and 
other purely starchy foods, except when combined with 
milk, eggs, or fruit, and eaten with sugar and cream ; and 
especially veal and pork. Veal is an immature meat, lack- 
ing in nourishment ; and of the free use of pork, apart 
from the question of the trichinae, a majority of physi- 
cians believe that it is largely responsible for the forms of 




430 The Boston Cook Book, 

scrofulous disease that have so uiidermiued the health of 
civihzed nations. 

What are termed the "fancies" of delicate persons, 
especiall}' children, are often natural instincts, pointing 
out what is beneficial to the system, or the reverse. All 
children have a fondness for sugar, which should be grati- 
fied in moderation rather than repressed. Their desire for 
it is natural, else it would not have been placed in the milk 
which forms their onh' nourishment in infanc}'. But cand}", 
rich preserves, and cake are not the best form of sweets 
for children. Pure block sugar or maple sugar is better 
than anj' form of candy. It should never be allowed be- 
tween meals, but ma}- be given occasionally as a part of 
the dessert. The habit of munching candj' between meals 
destroys the appetite, disturbs the digestion, and is the 
cause of much illness among children. Children troubled 
with worms should avoid sugar, preserves, and green 
vegetables. 

3£ilk should enter largeh' into the diet of children. It con- 
tains caseine, or flesh-forming material ; cream and sugar, 
wTiich are heat producers ; mineral salts, for the bony 
structure ; and water, as a solvent for all the other materials 
necessary in nutrition. It should be used with discretion, 
however ; not drunk immoderateh', but taken slowl}' as 
food after the pattern given by nature. Milk as taken is 
a fluid ; but as soon as it meets the acid of the gastric 
juice, it is changed to a soft, curdy, cheese-like substance, 
and then must be digested, and the stomach is overtasked 
if too much be taken at once. A large glass of milk swal- 
lowed suddenl}' will form in the stomach a lump of dense, 
cheesy curd, which ma}^ even prove fatal to a weak stomach. 
Under the action of the stomach this cheesy mass will turn 
over and over like a heavy weight ; and as the gastric juice 
can onl}^ attack its surface, it digests very slowh'. But 
this same milk, taken slowh', or with dr}" toast, light rolls, 
or soft dry porridge, form« a porous lump through which the 
gastric juice can easily pass, and which breaks up every 
time the stomach turns it over. Milk should be shghtly 



Diet for Invalids, 43 1 

salted, and eaten with bread stuffs or sipped by the 
spoonful. 

Cow's milk produces less heat than human milk ; a child 
would grow thin upon it unless a little sugar were added. 
Wheat flour has such an excess of heat-producing mate- 
rial as would fatten a child unduly, and should have cow's 
milk added to it to reduce its fattening power. 

Hints on Diet for Invalids. 
Vanilla should not be used as a flavoring in food for 
sick people. It is medicinal ; and all medicines are more 
or less poisonous, and are not to be taken as food. 

Pepper is allowable when a slight stimulant is needed. 
It should be white or cayenne pepper, as these are less irri' 
tating than black pepper. 

Boiled onions are soothing to the mucous membrane. 
In inflammation of the stomach thej^ are often helpful 
when a piece of white bread could not be digested. 

Broiled or roasted squab ^ venison^ chicken^ mutton^ 
and heef^ in the order given, are the most easily assim- 
ilated meats. 

Game, being rich in phosphates, is valuable for invalids. 
Broiled haco7i, dusted with cayenne, is an easily digested 
form of fat. 

Tomatoes as an article of diet are considered b}' many 
physicians a remed}' for d3'Spepsia and indigestion. 

Watery^ green^ or diseased p)Otatoes should never be 
eaten. If there be only a small spot of decay, it taints 
the whole potato. Young potatoes are very indigestible. 
Eggs for sick people should be taken raw. When 
beaten with cold milk, they are more quickly absorbed. If 
cooked, they should be either very soft, or hard enough to be 
easil}' crumbled to a powder, as in any intermediate stage 
the albumen is tough instead of brittle, and being tough is 
insoluble by the gastric juice ; these insoluble portions are 
often delayed in the stomach or intestines till they putrefy, 
and the sulphuretted hydrogen and ammonia evolved be- 
come poisonous to the intestinal ci",nal. 



432 Tfie Boston Cook Book. 

Soups which have in them cream or milk are better for 
invalids than those rich in gelatine. Cream of Celery 
and Potage a la Heine are especially suitable. Strong 
Bouillon is adapted to those suffering from hemorrhoids 
or an}' disease of the rectum, as there is no solid waste. 

Dijspeptics should avoid an\'thing which they (not 
others) cannot digest. There are so many causes for and 
forms of dyspepsia, that it is impossible to prescribe one 
and the same diet for all. Nothing is more disagreeable 
or useless than to be cautioned against eating this or that, 
because your neighbor "So-and-so" cannot eat such 
things. If we would all stud}' the nature and digestion of 
food, and remember that air and exercise are as essential 
as food in promoting good health, we could easily decide 
upon the diet best suited to our individual needs. 

The diabetic sliouid abstain from sugar and anj'thing 
which is converted into sugar in digestion, such as all 
starch}' foods, — fine wheat flour, rice, macaroni, tapioca, 
liver, potatoes, beets, carrots, turnips, parsnips, peas, 
beans, very old cheese, sweet omelets, custards, jellies, 
starchy nuts, sweet sauces, wine, and liquors. He may 
eat oysters, all kinds of fish, meat, poultry, and game, 
soups without any starchy thickening, lettuce, cucumbers, 
watercresses, dandehons, young onions, cold slaw, olives, 
cauliflower, spinach, cabbage, string beans, ripe fruit of 
all kinds without sugar, cream, butter, milk sparingly, 
gluten, flour, oily nuts freely salted, eggs, coffee, and 
cocoa. 

The corpulent should abstain from fat as well as sugar 
and starch. A diet of whole- wheat, milk, vegetables, 
fruits, and lean meat will produce only a normal amount of 
fatness ; while an excess of sweets, acids, spices, and 
shortening keeps the system in an unhealthful condition. 

Those who can digest fine flour, pastry, sugar, and fats • 
become loaded with fat, but are neither strong nor vigorous. 
Thin people with weak digestion should also avoid suc'i 
food ; for thin people are often kept thin by the same food 
which makes others fat. If they cannot digest the starch.

for no other reason than that life is burned out by a diet 
which only feeds the fire and does not renew the tissues.

The bilious and gouty should eat sparingly of brown 
meats, cheese, eggs, beans, peas, or food which is rich in 
albuminoids. A certain amount of albuminoid or nitro" 
genized food is requisite for tissue growth and repair ; 
more being required for growing persons and the conva- 
lescent tlian for healthy adults. Most Americans are in- 
clined to eat more albuminoid food than is required. It 
gives a sensation of energy, of being equal to work, which ^sgbST^/ 
is ver}' pleasant. But wiien we have " too much of a goodf y - . .^ 
thing," more than is needed for repair of tissue, this sur-y 
plus of albuminous material is imperfecth' oxidized, the 
blood is laden with waste, and biliousness or gout is the 
result. Fish gives less albuminoid waste than meat. 

People who are inclined to constipation should eat 
whole- wheat, rj^e, and corn bread and mushes, ripe fruit, 
berries, gi'een corn, vegetables, beef, mutton, poultry, 
milk, cream, and butter ; and should avoid fried or greasy 
food, hot bread, rich cake, veal, pork, or anything whic':. 
has so much woody fibre or cellulose :hat it only irritates 
the digestive canal, such as the outer bran of wheat, coarse 
oatmeal, etc. 

Those with consumptive tendencies should eat whole 
some, easily digested and assimilated food, with plenty of 
fat, — not in the indigestible form that it takes when 
mixed with starch, but as in cream, sweet butter, fat of 
roast or boiled meat, the fat, but not the lean, of ham and 
corned beef, oil, salads, corn-meal, oatmeal, etc. 

The diet of people who are well should be governed 
largely by their age, occupation, and exercise. Adults 
sliould have a variety of wholesome food cooked in different 
ways. Aged people should have a diet more like that of

children. If the occupation tax the muscular strength.^ 
use muscle-making food ; not wholl}^ meat, as man}'^ labor- 
ing people are inclined to think, but grains, peas, beans, 
cabbage, milk, cheese, eggs, whole-wheat bread, and 
chocolate, with a small amount of beef, mutton, and 
poultr}^ Students and brain-workers need more of brain- 
producing and less of muscle-making food. Brain food 
must contain phosphorus, which is found largely in oysters, 
eggs, fish, lean meat, wheat, peas, beans, and fruit. Those 
who are engaged in sedentary occupations^ who take 
little exercise and live in close, confined rooms, should 
eat onl}^ the most easil}^ digested food. 

People who engage in regular active labor, who take 
plenty of exercise in the open air, cultivate a cheerful, 
happy disposition, live temperatel}' in ever}' wa}', and have 
naturally strong digestive organs, can eat an}' kind of 
wholesome food that has been properly cooked, and have 
no consciousness of a stomach or any visceral organs ; and 
appetite, unless previousl\' impaired, is their best guide. 
If the digestive organs be not strong naturall}', such a 
mode of life as the above will tend to make them so, more 
than any amount of drugs or quack medicines. 

Junket. — Dissolve one junket tablet in one tablespoon 
of cold water, and two tablespoons of fiue granulated sugar 
in one quart of pure unscalded milk. Heat the milk in 
double boiler to 98°, or till warm all through but not hot. 
Remove, flavor to taste by steeping stick cinnamon or 
bay leaf in the milk and removing when hot ; add the 
tablet, stir once all through, pour into small cups in a 
shallow pan and let it stand undisturbed till jellied ; then 
remove in the pan to a cool place. If jarred it will 
separate into curds and w^hey. 

Serve with cream and powdered sugar. Many rich 
combinations and fancy garuishings may be added, if 
desired; such as custard, fruit juice and pulp, whipped 
cream, etc., but this simple method is most satisfactory, 
especially for children and the invalid conditions which it 
is supposed to help. 



How to Do Tt. 435 



MISCELLANEOUS HINTS. 

To Chop Suet. — Cut into small pieces and removc 
the membrane. Sprinkle with flour, and chop in a cold 
place to prevent its becoming soft and sticky. 

To Clean Currants. — Put them in a squash strainer, 
and sprinkle thickly- with flour. Rub them well until they 
are separated, and the flour, grit, and fine stems have 
passed through the strainer. Then place the strainer and 
currants in a pan of water, and wash thoroughl}'. Lift 
the strainer and currants together, and change the water 
till clear. Drain bet\\'^en towels, and pick over carefullv- 
Dry them in a sunn}' place or between towels, but do not 
harden them by putting them into the oven. 

To Stone Haisins. — Pour boiling water over them, 
and let them stand in it five or ten minutes. Drain, and 
rub each raisin between the thumb and finger till the seeds 
come out clean, then cut or tear apart, or chop, if wanted 
very fine. 

Core Ap)p>les before j^aring, ami there is less danger of 
their breaking. 

Egg Shells. — Wash eggs as soon as thej^ come from 
the market, and then the shells may be used in clearing 
coflee, soup, etc. 

To JBoil a Pudding in a Cloth. — Wring strong cotton 
cloth out of boiling water, and spread over a bowl. 
Sprinkle with flour, fill with the pudding, draw the cloth 
together, and tie tighth', then flour near the opening. 
Plunge into boiling water, and keep the water boiling 
during the time for cooking. Add boiling water as needed, 
and replenish the fire often. 

Meringues should be put on puddings after they are 
slightly cool, as, if the pudding be hot, the Qgg will liquefj'. 



43^ The Boston Cook Book. 



Moulds should be greased for an\- steamed mixture 
wet in cold water for jelh', creams, etc. ; and neither wet 
nor greased if to be lined with cake. A mould of jelly 
will cool quicker if placed in a pan of ice water or snow 
than in the ice-chest. 

Ccmdled or Crystallized Fruit or Niits. {Mrs. Camp- 
bell.) — Boil 0)ie cup iii granulated sugar and one eup of 
boiling water together for half an hour. Then dip the 
point of a skewer into the s^rup and then into cold water. 
If the thread formed break off brittle, the syrup is read}'. 
The sj'rup must never be stirred, and must boil slowly, 
not furiously'. When done, set the saucepan in boiling 
water, or pour the S3rup into a bowl placed in hot water, 
to keep the sjrup from candying. Take the prepared 
fruit or nuts on the point of a large needle or fine skewer, 
dip them into the s3-rup, and then lay them on a dish, 
which has been lightly buttered or oiled ; or string them 
on a thread, and after dipping in the syrup suspend them 
by the thread. When oranges are used, divide them into 
eighths, and wipe all moisture. Cherries should be stoned. 
English walnuts are especially nice prepared in this wa^'. 

To Blanch Almonds and other Nuts. — Remove the 
shells, cover with boiling water, and let them stand till the 
dark skin will rub off easily. Then put them in cold 
water, rub off the skins, and drj' between towels. 

Corned Meat. — Fresh meat may be kept some time b}- 
corning it slighth'. Wipe carefull}', and remove an}' parts 
that are not sweet and fresh, then rub all over thickl}' 
with salt. Or make a brine with rock salt and cold water ; 
use salt enough to float the meat, then cover, and put 
a heavy weight on the cover to keep the meat under the 
brine. Three days' time is sufficient for corned meat. 

To Make Paper Boxes. — These can be obtained, in a 
variety of forms, from the confectioner ; but plain ones 
may be made in this way. Take a piece of stiff white 
paper, five inches square. Find the centre of the square 
by folding two opposite corners together and creasing 
lightly in the middle, then open and fold the other two in 



Hotv to Do It. 43 p7 



the same wa}'. Fold the two sides over till they meet in 
the centre, then Ibid the two ends. Open, and cut in the 
fold down to the line at each end, but not on the side. 
Fold the sides over on tht; outside about one quarter of an 
inch ; then fold the middle part of the end in the same 
way. Then turn the ends of the side pieces round behind 
the end, and let them meet in the middle, and fold the 
edge of the end over them. Fasten the ends with a few 
stitches or with paste. A border of fancy perforated i)aper 
may be pasted on the edge. 

A Pastry Bag. — One third of a yaixl of yard-widei 
rubber sheeting will make three bags one foot square. 
Fold two opposite corners together, stitch along the edge, 
and make a triangular bag. Cut off at the point to make 
an opening large enough to insert the end of a tin tube. 
It is convenient to have three bags, with openings of 
different sizes, — one for eclairs, one for lady fingers, and 
one for frosting. The tube for eclairs is three fourths ol 
an inch wide at the small end ; that for lady fingers, three 
eighths of an inch ; and the frosting tubes, of various sizes, 
some of them quite small. Fit the tube into the opening, 
and fill the bag with the mixture. Draw the edges together, 
and twist the top tightly to keep out the air. Hold the 
bag in the left hand, wdth the tube close to the place where 
the mixture is to be spread ; press with the right, and guide 
the mixture into any shape desired. A slight pressure is 
sufficient. When no longer needed, wash the bags in cold 
(never in hot) water, and dry carefully. 

Vanilla Sugar. — One poiuid of lum2y sugar and one 
ounce of Mexican vanilla heans. Cut the beans in small 
pieces, and pound in a mortar, with the sugar, till fine 
like flour. Sift through a fine strainer, pound the remain- 
der again, and sift till all is fine. Keep in a tightly 
corked bottle. Use a tablesjyoonful for a quart of ice- 
cream. Or cut the beans into small pieces, and split them 
that the seeds may be exposed. Put an ounce of the 
heans in a small jar with a pound of sugar. Sift the 
sugar as re(^uired, and use as above ; add more sugar, 




438 The Boston Cook Book, 

keep closely covered, and use as long as there is anj flavor 
in the sugar. 

Canned Fruit Juices. — Fruit juices ma}^ be kept for 
a long time hy canning the same as whole fruit. They 
are convenient for water ices and summer beverages. 
Mash the fruit, and rub the pulp through a fine sieve. 
Mix about tJwee pounds of sugar with one quart o^ fruit 
juice and pulp. Fill Mason's jars with the syrup, cover, 
and place in a heater with cold water to come nearly to 
the top of the jar. Let the water boil half an hour, then 
fill each jar to the brim, seal, and cool in the water. 

To Mould Ice Cream. — Ice cream is more attractive, 
when served, if moulded, and if one has no fancy moulds, 
the freezer can will always give the round shape. If 
moulds are used, the cream should be packed into them 
closely, filling every crevice. The cover should always fit 
over and not into the mould. Bind a buttered cloth 
round the edge of the cover, or lay a buttered paper over 
the top of the cream, or coat the edge v>'ith butter or 
melted suet to fill all the crevices and keep out the salt 
water. Bury the moulds in ice and salt ; a little less salt 
than is used in freezing. Cover the ice with wet carpet- 
ing. The cream will keep hard several hours, but it is well 
to examine it occasionally, and when the mould floats, 
draw off the water and add more ice and salt. When 
ready to serve, wash off the butter and salt from the 
mould, lift off the cover and paper, and turn the mould 
over a platter. The warmth of the room will soon melt 
the cream sufiiciently for the mould to be lifted ; if not, 
then lay a hot cloth on the mould, or dip the mould quickly 
in warm water. Salt water cannot get into the mould if 
full, but often when cream is left over and you replace it 
in the mould only partially filled, the water will get in. 

To keep Lettuce^ Celery^ Watercress, etc. — Wash them 
and nip off any part that shows signs of decay. Rinse 
each leaf separately to be sure it is free from grit, lay 
the inner leaves, such as may be used for a salad in 
regular order in a wet napkin, and put them away in a 
cold place. Break up the tough outside leaves, and cook 
them until tender in boiling water, as you do any greens. 



The Dlning-Room. 439 



THE DINING-ROOM. 

The subjects of "The Arrangement of the Table,'' 
"Dinner-Giving," and "Bills of Fare " have been fully 
treated in other cook books, and it would be difficult to 
add to what has already been said. Hints on garnishing, 
carving, and appropriate combinations of dishes have been 
given in connection with man}' of these receipts ; and want 
of space forbids anything more than some general rules. 

Above all things, attempt nothing in style or expense 
beyond what you can well afford. There is no more paltry 
ambition, nothing that contains more certainl}' the seeds of 
unhappiness and disaster, than such a desire for "empty 
show," which all sensible people must despise. 

Let your breakfasts be of wholesome and substantial 
food. The system needs nourishment in the morning after 
the long, unbroken fast of the night. The practice of tak- 
ing only a cup of tea or coffee with hot biscuit, and possi- 
bly pie or doughnuts, gives a very poor foundation for the 
morning's labor, which is and should be the hard labor of 
the da}'. Milk, coffee, or chocolate, mushes, fruits, pota- 
toes or bread, meat, fish, or eggs, in some of their simple 
and digestible combinations should form the basis of the 
])reakfast. The morning meal should be taken as soon as 
possible after rising. Any prolonged bodily exertion or 
exposure to the earh' morning air, before the stomach is 
fortified by food, is now condemned b}' the majorit}^ of 
plnsicians. 

The midday and evening meal may vary with the occu- 
pations and habits of the family ; but a regular hour for 
eathig should be observed, whether the more substantial 
meal come at noon or night ; and if at night sufficient time 
should be allowed for digestion to be completed before 



440 The Boston Cook Book. 

sleeping. A supper of cold bread and cake or pie is 
neither appetizing nor satisfying for tliose who have been 
hard at work through the da}'. " Something warm or 
hearty, something for a relish," every man craves for 
supper. Toast, brewis, warm tea-cakes, cocoa, oatmeal, 
warmed-over potatoes, cold meat, made dishes, eggs, 
oysters, etc., are far better than the common supper of 
sweets. 

Every one may have clean, if not fine, table linen. An 
under covering of cotton flannel or felt made to fit the 
table is desirable, as it prevents noise, and a linen cloth 
may be laid over it more smoothly than over the bare table. 
Thin tablecloths remain fresh longer if stiffened slightly 
with ver}' thin starch, but heavy damask requires no stif- 
fening. Keep the cloths in a drawer large enough to hold 
them without much folding. Avoid making many folds in 
ironing, and in handling them fold always in the creases. 
In laying the cloth, place the centre of it in the centre of 
the table, and have the folds straight with the edges of the 
table. ' Crease the cloth round the edge of the table, that 
it may drape smoothl}'. 

Lay a plate, right side up, for each person. If the table 
be long, place one plate at each end, and those at the sides 
opposite each other. Place the napkin at the left of the 
plate, and at dinner place a piece of bread between the 
folds of the napkin. Place the knives, butter plate, and 
tumbler at the right of each plate, the forks at the left, and 
the soup and dessert spoons in front, the handles towaid 
the right hand, — the number of each depending upon the 
number of courses. The fruit dish or flowers should occupy 
the centre of the table ; the salt and pepper, butter, jelly, 
pickles, etc., at the corners. Place the various dishes on 
the table in regular order, straight with the table, or, if at 
an angle, let there be some uniformit}', never helter-skelter. 
The cups, plates, and dishes for hot food should be heated 
in hot water or in a warming-oven. Use a spoon to place 
ice in delicate glasses or pitchers ; or put in the water first, 
and then the ice, to avoid breaking. 



Table Etiquette. 



441 



Do not let the table become disordered during the meal. 
The dishes, plates, etc., should be removed noiseless!}', one 
by one ; and never piled one upon another, after the hast\^ 
fashion of second-class hotels. 

If the serving be done by the host and hostess, it is more 
convenient for them to sit at the sides of the table ; the 
host serving the substantial dishes, and the hostess the tea 
or coffee, vegetables or entrees, puddings, and the dessert 
Where there are servants to do the waiting, the host and 
liostess ma}' sit at the ends of the table, as there they can 
command a better view of their guests, and see that they 
are properl}' served. The hostess should serve the soup, 
salad, dessert, and coffee ; the host, the fish and meat ; and 
the servants, the vegetables and entrees. 

At a dinner served a la Russe^ the fruit and flowers on!}' 
are placed upon the table, the several courses being served 
from the side. 

Many volumes have been written upon table etiquette. 
Some of the suggestions they contain are practical ; others 
useless. What is considered proper at one place or time 
is not approved under other circumstances ; and those 
desirous of observing the usages of good societ}" are 
often sorel}' perplexed to keep pace with the variations 
of fashion. But if, instead of following mere arbitrary 
rules from the low standpoint of " st3'le," we would take 
for our guidance the best definition of true politeness as 
given by Dr. Watts, — " Love manifested in an easy and 
graceful manner," — we need never be at a loss as to '' what 
to do and what not to do." A moment's observation will 
show the strictness of etiquette maintained in the famil}' 
in which you may be a guest, — for instance, whether the 
servants are expected to take entire charge of serving 
everything, or whether tiie family reserve to themselves 
something of the happy privilege of courtesy and thought 
for each other ; and you maj* forget with them, in the 
mutual interchange of the proper attentions, that freezing 
formality which sometimes forbids that you should seem to 
know ov care how your neighbor fares. "Think not of 




442 The Boston Cook Book. 

3'ourself, but of what will contribute most to another's com- 
fort or convenience," remembering that for the time being 
utter deference should be paid to the evident arrangement 
of the house at which you are. This is the safest stand- 
ard for table etiquette, as well as for good manners ever}"- 
where. No selfish person can ever be trul}' polite. Children 
should be carefull}' trained in table manners as soon as 
the}" are old enough to come to the table, and accustomed 
to perfect politeness ; then there will be no fear of mis- 
haps, nor special training needed for " company," nor any 
awkward habits to be overcome in later life. 

After a meal brush up any crumbs that may have fallen, 
lest the}^ be trodden into the carpet. Collect the knives, 
forks, and spoons by themselves. Put au}^ food that maj- 
be used again on small dishes, never on the dishes used in 
serving. Scrape the dishes, empt}' and rinse the cups, 
and pack neatly near where the}' are to be washed. Brush 
the crumbs from the cloth, instead of shaking it, then fold 
and put it away carefully. 

Never pile nice china or an}' other dishes in the dishpan. 
Begin with a pan half filled with hot soap}' water. Keep 
the soap in a shaker made for that purpose, or in a tin 
cup ; make a strong lather in the cup, and use as needed. 
Never leave the soap in the dishpan to waste and stick to 
the dishes. Wash glasses first. Slip them in sideways, 
so that the hot water will touch outside and inside at once, 
and then there will be no danger of breaking from unequal 
expansion. Wash one at a time, and wipe instantly with- 
out draining or rinsing. Wash the silver and wipe at once, 
as it keeps bright longer if wiped out of hot soapy water. 
Keep a cake of silver soap at hand, and rub each piece of 
silver as soon as discolored. Then wash the china, begin- 
ning with the cups, saucers, pitchers, and least greasy 
dishes, and changing the water as soon as cool or greasy. 
Place these dishes in the rinsing-pan with the cups inside 
up and plates resting on the edges, that they may be 
scalded inside as well as outside, and drain quickly. 
Scald and wipe immediately. 



Kitchen Utensils. 443 



"Dave's" method of washing dishes, though not in 
general use, has been proved satisfactor3\ Place a pan 
of cold water between the washing and rinsing pans. 
After washing and wiping the glasses and silver, add 
more hot water, and wash the china first in the hot suds, 
then dip each dish instantl}^ into the cold water, and stand 
it on the edge to drain in ths. rinsing-pan. The cold water 
rinses off the hot suds, and the sudden change of tempera- 
ture dries the dishes almost instantl}' ; and the}' require 
little or no wiping. They will be neither " sticky nor 
streak}'." 

Where there is onl}' one woman for " cook, waitress, 
hostess, .and kitchen girl," it is well, after the table is 
cleared and the dishes neatly packed, to wash first the 
kitchen dishes, and pots and kettles ; then with, clean 
water and towels wash and wipe the table dishes. The 
hands will be left in much better condition than when the 
pots and kettles are washed last. 

The Care of Kitchen Utensils. 

A complete list of kitchen utensils is not given in this 
work, as the variety and number needed will be largely 
determined b}' circumstances. There are several utensils, 
which are not perhaps in general use, which lessen the 
labor of cooking, and add much to the attractiveness of 
food prepared b}^ their aid. 

There is nothing that makes so much diff'erence between 
ordinary and delicate cooking as a set of strainers. There 
should be one of very fine wire for sifting soda, spices, 
etc., and for straining custards and jellies ; others with 
meshes from one sixteenth to one eighth of an inch in 
diameter ; also a squash strainer and a colander. Ex- 
tension wire strainers are very convenient. Keep also a 
supply of strainer cloths^ made from coarse crash or cheese 
cloth., and^/ie napkin linen. 

A set of oval tin moulds^ a melon mouldy and one or 
two fancy moulds are convenient for entrees, puddings, 
and jellies. 



444 ^^^ Boston Cook Book. 

Other useful articles are Dover egg-heaters^ large and 
small ; ordinar}' small wooden spoons and the larger per- 
forated ones ; a ichip churn ; granite saucepans and stem- 
pans^ holding from half a pint to six quarts ; double 
hollers; 2^wirehasketiovix^\\i^\ 2i potato slicer ; 2i fine wire 
broiler for toast, and two coarser ones for steak and fish ; 
a set of pastry hags and f 7^0 sting tubes ; fancy vegetable 
cutters; a glass rolling-pin ; and, above all, a small 
sharp-pointed knife ^ made from the best steel, for paring 
potatoes, turnips, etc., and a set of tin measuring-cups 
holding half a pint, and divided into quarters and thirds. 

It is a mistake to have manj^ large, unwield}' dishes. 
Small saucepans and small bowls are more convenient, and 
granite or agate ware is much lighter to handle and more 
easily kept clean than ironware. Buckets are convenient 
for keeping sugar and small quantities of flour. Glass jars 
or wide-mouthed bottles are best for nearly all groceries, 
such as rice, tapioca, meal, raisins, etc. The}' are easily 
cleansed, and the contents are plainly' seen. They may be 
kept air-tight, or, if that be unnecessar}', old jars not suit- 
able for canning ma}' be utilized. 

A refrigerator should be examined daily and kept thor- 
oughly clean. If a suitable brush cannot be had, a long 
stifle wire with a bit of cloth on the end should be used to 
clean the drain pipe. Pour boiling washing-soda water 
through it every other day, and do not forget to wash off 
the sHme that adheres to the water pan. Fish, onions, 
cheese, any strong vegetables, lemons, or meat not per- 
fectly sweet, should not be kept in the same ice-box w^th 
milk or butter. 

Do not become wedded to the idea that dishes can only 
be washed in a sink. If your pantry or cookroom be some 
distance from your sink, and have a broad shelf or table 
in it, take your dishpan to the pantry, wash and wipe your 
dishes there, and in this way save a few of the unneces- 
sary steps which soon amount to miles wnth many weary 
housekeepers. 

Never wash a bread-board in an iron sink. The iron 



Care of Utensils. 445 



will leave a bluek mark on the board, which it is didicult 
to remove. Wash the board on the table where 30U have 
used it ; use cold water, and scrub occasionally with sand 
soap. In scraping dough from the board, scrape with the 
grain of the wood, and hold the knife in a slanting direc- 
tion, to prevent roughening the surface of the board. 
AV'ash, and wipe dr}', and never let dough accumulate in 
the cracks. Have one board for bread and pastrj', and 
keep it smooth. Use a smaller board for rolling crumbs 
and pounding ana cleaning meat and fish. 

A Dover eo'2:-beater should never be left to soak in 
water, as the oil will be washed out of the gears and the 
beater be hard to turn ; or, if used again before it be dr 
the oil and water will spatter into the beaten mixtu; 
Use it with clean hands, and then the handle will requ 
no washing. Wipe the wires with a damp cloth immedi 
ately after using, dr}' thoroughl}', and keep it well oiled. 

All dishes should be scraped before washing. A small 
wooden knife is best for this purpose. Bread and cake 
bowls, or any dishes in which flour or eggs have been 
used, are more easilj- cleaned if placed in cold water after 
using, or washed immediatel}'. 

Clear up as 3'ou work : it takes but a moment then, and 
saves much time and fatigue afterward. 

Never put pans and kettles half filled with water on the 
stove to soak. It onl}' hardens w^hatever ma}' have atl- 
hered to the kettle, and makes it much more difficult to 
clean. Keep them full of cold water, and soak them away 
from the heat. 

Kitchen knives and forks should never be placed in the 
dish water. Many err in thinking it is only the handles 
which should not be wet. The practice of putting the 
blades into a pitcher of very hot water is wrong, as the 
sudden expansion of the steel by the heat causes the han- 
dles to crack. Keep the knives out of the water, but wash 
thoroughly with the di.shclotli, rub them with mineral soap 
or brick dust, and wipe them dry. Keep them bright, and 
sharpen often on a sandstone. The disadvantage and 




44^ The Boston Cook Book. 

vexation of dull tools would be avoided if ever}' woman 
would learn to use a whetstone, and where and when to 
api)l3' a little oil. 

Milk will sour quickl}' if put into dishes which have not 
been scalded. The}' should first be washed in clear cold 
water, then in hot soap}' water, then rinsed in clear boil- 
ing water, and wiped with a dry fresh towel. Do not for- 
get to scrape the seams and grooves of a double boiler. 

Ironware should be washed, outside as well as inside, in 
hot soap}' water, rinsed in clean hot water, and wiped dry, 
not with the dishcloth, but with a dry towel. Dripping- 
pans, Scotch bowls, and other greasy dishes should be 
scraped, and wiped with soft paper, which will absorb the 
grease. The paper will be found useful in kindling the 
fire, and is a great saving of water, which is sometimes 
an object. A tablespoonful of soda added to the water 
will facilitate the cleaning. 

Kitchen mineral soap or pumice stone may be used 
freely on all dishes. It will remove the stains from 
white knife handles, the brown substance that adheres to 
earthen or tin baking-dishes, and the soot whicli collects 
on pans and kettles used over a wood or kerosene fire. 
Tins should be washed in dean, hot soapy water. Rub 
them frequently with mineral soap, and they may be kept 
as bright as when new. Saucepans and other tin or 
granite dishes browned by use may be cleaned by letting 
them remain half an hour in boiling soda water, then 
rubbing with a wire dishcloth or stiff brush. 

A new tin coffee-pot, if never washed on the inside 
with soap, may be kept much sweeter. Wash the outside, 
and rinse the inside thoroughly with clear water. Then 
put it on the stove to dry, and when dry rub the inside 
well with a clean, dry cloth. All the brown sediment 
may be wiped off in that way, but a soapy dishcloth should 
never be put inside. 

Keep a granite pan near the sink to use in washing 
vegetables, and use the hand basin only for its legitimate 
purpose. Pare vegetables into the pan, and not into the 



Dish Wasliing. 447 



sink. A strainer or any old quart tin pan with small 
holes in the bottom is a great lielp in keeping a sink clean. 
Pour the coffee and tea grounds, the dish water, and 
ever3'thing that is turned into the sink through the strainer 
first, and then empty the contents of the strainer into the 
refuse pail. 

Never use a ragged or linty dishcloth. The lint collects 
round the sink spout, and often causes a serious obstruc- 
tion. A dish mop is best for cups and cleanest dishes, 
but a strong linen cloth should be used for everytbing 
which requires hard rubbing. Wash the sink thoroughl}', 
flush the drainpipe often with hot suds or soda water, 
wipe dr}', and rub with a greased cloth or with kerosene. 
Keep it greased if 3'ou wish to prevent its rusting. 

Cremation is the most satisfactory way of disposing of 
kitchen refuse, both as a matter of convenience and for 
sanitary reasons. But if there must be other disposition 
made of it, keep two pails and use them alternately, 
cleansing each as soon as emptied. 

Wash dish towels in cold water, with plent}^ of soap, 
and rinse thoroughly in cold water, every time they are 
used. If left to dr}' without washing, thej' will be sticky 
to handle and have a disagreeable odor. If the dishes 
be well washed, rinsed, and drained, the dish towels will 
require no rubbing. It is easier to take care of three or 
four which have never been left to become grimy than to 
wash one after it is stained and saturated with grease. 
Towels used in this way may be kept sweet and clean 
without boiling or drying in the sun. This method has 
been proved by 3'cars of trial. 

With a little care in observing these hints, and always 
using clean, hot soap}' water (and not a liquid fit only for 
the swill cart), changing it as soon as greas}', dish-washing 
would be robbed of lialf its terrors. And after the work 
is done, if the hands be care full}' washed with Castile soap, 
not with strong washing-soap, and wiped dry, no un- 
pleasant eflTect upon the skin will be felt. vSome use a httle 
vinegar to counteract the effect of the alkali in the soap.

A large apron made like a child's tire, high in the neck, 
with long sleeves, and buttoned in the back, is the best 
pattern for a work apron. It protects the entire dress, 
and can be easily removed when one is called from the 
kitchen. Print or cambric with a white ground and small 
black figures wears better than colored print. 

New, white mosquito netting and cheese cloth are useful 
for draining lettuce and for putting around fish, chicken, 
or vegetables whicli require careful boiling ; also for bags 
for herbs and spices. Small squares of new cotton cloth 
are useful for wiping meat or fish. Keep them clean, and 
use for nothing else. 

Keep a good supply of small holders, large coarse 
towels to use about the oven, and fine crash towels for 
wiping dishes. Keep a damp towel on the table when 
cooking, for wiping the hands. Avoid the habit of work- 
ing with sticky or flour}' fingers, or using your apron for a 
hand towel or oven holder, or using the dish towels about 
the stove. 

These suggestions are given by one who has alwaj's 
liked to wash dishes, and who thinks it not beneath the 
dignit}' of any woman to learn to do such work in the 
very best manner, and that no apology is needed for 
acknowledging a taste for this much-abused portion of 
domestic work. 

To remove Iron Rust. — Keep a bottle of strong solu- 
tion of oxalic acid, plainly labelled " Poison," in a handy 
place for use on washing day. Gather up the cloth round 
the spot of rust, and dip the spot in cold water, then in 
the acid, and then in rapidly boiling water, holding it 
in the steam a few minutes. If the spot does not quickly 
disappear, repeat the process. The steam seems to be 
necessary with the acid. Then rinse thoroughly.

FOOD: 
ITS USES, CLASSIFICATION, AND PROPORTION. 

Webster defines food as " anything that supports and nour- 
ishes life." 

The kingdom of nature is divided into organic and inorganic 
bodies. Organic bodies have life; inorganic bodies are without 
life. Organic bodies are composed of several reciprocal parts, 
each of which is necessary to, and dependent upon, all the other 
parts. Organic bodies, therefore, include plants and animals, and 
inorganic bodies include earths, me/als, and minerals. Organic 
bodies spring from some parent or immediate producing agent; 
they are supported by means of nourishment, and die without it; 
they increase in size by tlie addition of new particles of matter 
to all parts of their substances. Inorganic bodies are formed by 
some chemical law or union, and grow only by addition to their 
surfaces. 

Organic and inorganic bodies are continually wasting away or 
wearing out. Waste tak?s place in all objects, animate and in- 
animate. The minutest change in position in any plant, ani- 
mal, or rock cannot be eifected without some loss of substance. 
It has always been beyond the power of man to make anytliiiig 
that would not wear out. But there is this important distinction 
between organic and inorganic bodies. Only organic bodies can 
repair their waste, and add to their substance; they alone have 
life, or vital force. When anything wears out in a stone or a 
steam-engine, there is no power in the stone or the engine to 
replace the lost matter; and when a plant or an animal dies, 
the power of repairing waste is gone from it forever. Hence it 
is with animate bodies, or bodies endowed with life, that we have 
to do in considering the subject of food.

Life is that form of energy in creation that results in de- 
velopment from within the object. The energy may be purely 
physical, as in plants; or it may involve mental and moral 
considerations, as in animals. 

There are some essential distinctions between the various 
forms of organic life. Animals grow proportionally in all direc- 
tions, and, at a certain time of life, attain their average size. 
Plants grow. upwards and downwards from a collet only, aHd 
continue to grow^ through a term of existence. Animals feed 
upon organic matter, consume oxygen from the air, and throw 
off carbonic acid; plants feed upon inorganic matter, consume 
carbonic acid, and restore oxygen to the air. 

Living plants or vegetables are, with few exceptions, fixed to 
the spot of earth from which they spring, and receive their 
nourishment from external sources. It is furnished them by 
the soil, air, light, and heat by which they are surrounded; and 
they are every moment receiving all that is necessary for their 
sustenance. K one of these essential conditions be withdrawn, 
death follows. Living animals have the power of locomotion^ 
and, being obliged to wander, they are not always directly in 
contact with their sources of nourishment. They have, there- 
fore, a storehouse in which they lay up at intervals a supply 
of material. The possession of this stomach, or storehouse, 
characterizes all animal beings. 

The changes that occur in animal life are more rapid and 
variable than those in vegetable life. Not being, like vegeta- 
bles, always in connection with their food, animals need some 
monitor to warn them when to seek it. This is provided them 
in the appetite, or the sensations of Imnger and thirst. There is 
also a pleasure in the regulated indulgence of these sensations, 
which never fails to insure attention to their demands. 

The vegetable kingdom is the original source of all organic 
matter. All our food is derived directly from the vegetable 
world, or indirectly through animals which have been nourished 
on vegetable products. The ox and sheep, which are consumed 
in the form of beef and mutton, have not fed on flesh, but on 
grass, hay, oats, and other grains. It is only under exposure to 
the sun's rays that plants will grow. Hence to its influence 
we must refer the production of food in the first instance, and 
therefore the sustenance of all life. 

Life and growth in human beings are dependent upon two 
conditions, — motion and warmth. 

Motion. — Our bodies are constantly in motion. The heart 



Food, 45 1 

and lungs move with every breath. Every thought causes some 
change in the brain. Whenever any part of the body loses its 
power of motion, it dies. All this motion, whether voluntary or 
involuntary, results in the gradual wasting away of the flesh, 
blood, and bones of which the body is composed. " We begin 
to die as soon as we begin to live." If the worn-out materials 
be not replaced, we die. One great object of food is to supply 
this waste. The demand for building material is greatest when 
the body is in a state of activity. Until the human body has 
attained its complete growth, there should be a constant supply 
of material for neiu growth, as well as for repair. In maturity, 
or when, from bodily inactivity, there is less waste, a smaller 
supply will suffice. Food taken at regular intervals supplies 
means of growth, and repairs the worn-out tissues. 

Warmlh. — The temperature of the living human body is about 
98°. In hot or cold climates, in summer or winter, though the 
temperature of the external parts may vary, the internal tempera- 
ture is the same; and if not maintained within a few degrees of 
this point, death invariably follows. The source of this animal 
heat, so independent of outside circumstances, must be from 
within. To keep up this internal heat or fire, a constant supply 
of fuel is necessary. This fuel is supplied by our food. To fur- 
nish material for growth and repair, and to provide fuel for the 
warmth of the body, is the twofold object of food. 

Animal Combustion. — The process by which food maintains 
the motion and warmth of the body is a kind of combustion, 
and has often been compared to the combustion carried on in 
the steatn-engine (see Youmans's Chemistry). We can have no 
combustion without oxygen; therefore oxygen is the first impor- 
tant element of food. The air is our great source of supply of 
oxygen, and a volume might be written on the necessity for 
pure air and perfect ventilation. We breathe oxygen from the 
air into our lungs, and exhale carbonic acid. There must there- 
fore have been some internal union of carbon or hydrogen with 
oxygen, and such a union always produces heat. The carbon 
and hydrogen are obtained from our food, and are important 
elements. They are necessary for animal combustion. 

Food is taken in a natural or in a prepared state, and, after 
undergoing certain processes of digestion and assimilation, be- 
comes a part of our bodies for a time, and then is burned in the 
body, the process resembling somewhat the burning of wood and 
coal in our grates. But this union of carbon and oxygen, ''in- 
stead of taking place in one spot and so rapidly as to be accom- 




452 The Boston Cook Book. 

panied by light, as in the case of the grate fire, takes place in 
each drop of the blood, and so slowly and continuously as not to 
be noticed." The force and heat absorbed from the sun by the 
vegetable in growing, and stored in its starch and sugar, are sf>t 
free, by the decomposition of the vegetable, into carbonic acid 
and water again. These are given out, partly as heat, keeping 
the body temperature at 98°; and partly in other forms, — in 
that of mechanical motion, etc. 

All the external or internal work of the body is done by 
the force and energy of the food which is burnt therein. The 
greater the amount of work to be done, the greater must be the 
supply of fuel. The fire is constantly burning. " The smoke 
passes out in exhalation, inhalation is the bellows to furnish 
more oxygen," and food supplies the fuel. The kidneys are 
the grates through which the ashes are removed. But if we 
are "a house on fire," why are we not consumed? Because, 
lest this internal fire burn too freely, the oxygen of the air is 
diluted with nitrogen, which is incombustible. The blood, 
bones, and muscles of the body are composed largely of nitro- 
gen, sixteen per cent of that element being present; and this 
prevents the complete burning up of the structure. " What the 
iron is to the stove, the nitrogenous tissues are to the body." 
But the stove w^ears out in time, and so our bodies are con- 
stantly wasting away; and these nitrogenous elements must be 
supplied by our food. 

Food, to accomplish its purpose fully, should consist of these 
four elements: oxygen, to support combustion, — obtained from 
the air; carfto/i and hydrogen, to furnish fuel, — obtained from 
water and carbonaceous food ; nitrogen, to build up and repair 
the tissues of the body, — obtained from nitrogenous food. 

Food, in the form in which it is eaten, cannot sustain life. 
It must be converted into a fluid that can pass through very 
small channels into the blood. Then it must be mixed with the 
air, and undergo certain changes, before it can replace the worn- 
out elements of the body. To prepare food so that it can most 
readily be assimilated, that is, made like our bodies, should be 
the chief purpose in cooking. To do this, three things are 
essential : 1st. The food selected should be of the right mate- 
rial, and properly proportioned; 2d. It should be cooked in the 
most digestible and attractive manner; 3d. It should be adapted 
to the various circumstances of age, occupation, climate, and 
state of health. 

Food, to be of the right material, should contain all the ele- 



Human Body. 453 

meuts that our bodies contain. It is of primary importance, 
tlien, in studying food, to understand first the composition of the 
human body. 



THE COMPOSITION OF THE HUMAN BODY. 

Our bodies are made up of different materials: skin, flesh, 
blood, bone, etc. These consist of a large number of substances, 
called compounds; the compounds contain two, three, or four 
elements, united chemically in definite proportion. Some of 
these compounds are: water ^ which forms more than two thirds 
of the whole body, and is the common carrier of food into and 
through the system; fihrine, which is the chief solid material of 
flesh, and forms one tenth of the body; fat, a mixture of three 
compounds, distributed all through the system; albumen, and 
other nitrogenous substances, of which osseine in bones, keratin 
in the hair, nails, and skin, cartilagin in cartilage, and hemo- 
globin, which contains iron and gives the red color to the blood, 
are the most important. Chloride of sodium, or common salt, 
and other mineral salts of pofassa, lime, and magnesia, are 
found in all parts of the body. These compounds are made up 
of two or more separate and distinct elements. 

There are sixteen elements in the human body, — oxygen, 
carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, chlorine, fluo- 
rine, silicon, calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron, 
manganese, and copper. Compounds only, not the separate ele- 
ments, are capable of nourishing the body. Oxygen only exists 
as an element. Its office is to support combustion. 

Combinations of two or more of these elements are found in 
the various articles used as food. It is quite important that our 
food should consist of various materials, containing elements 
similar to, or capable of being changed into, the elements of our 
bodies, of which the most important are: water, to help diges- 
tion and assimilation of food, and to help carry away refuse 
material; salts, to renew the mineral parts and replenish certain 
tissues; carbon, to furnish fuel for warmth; nitrogen, to build up 
and repair the whole structure. 

For convenience the elements are classified chemically into 
Non-Combustibles, or inoi-ganic compounds, including water and 
salts; Combustibles, or organic compounds, including carbona- 
ceous and nitrogenous foods. Some foods contain no carbon, 
some contain no nitrogen, and some have all the elements ua 



454 ^^^^ Boston Cook Booh 

various proportions. Food has been classified into gaseous, oi 
air; liquid, or water; and solid, including animal and vegetable 
foods. But the division into carbonaceous, or heat-pi-oducing, 
and nitrogenous, or flesh-forming foods, answers every purpose. 



liTON-COMBUSTIBLE COMPOUNDS 



"Water and Salts. 

Water forms more than two thirds of the whole body. It 
is especially abundant in the blood and secretions. It gives 
them the necessary fluidity, and enables them to dissolve the 
important materials they contain. It is contained in all kinds 
of solid food, as well as in the liquids drunk as beverages. It 
is most abundant in fruits and vegetables. Every pound of 
perfectly dry food should be accompanied with four pounds of 
water. 

Pure water is composed of oxygen and hydrogen, one ninth 
hydrogen and eight ninths oxygen by weight. The usual test 
for pure drinking water is that it be " free from color, smell, or 
taste, be soft, bright, and aerated, and free from all deposit." 
But it is very seldom found in that condition, as its power of 
dissolving other substances is so great that it nearly always 
holds animal, vegetable, or mineral matters in solution, obtained 
from the earth through which it flows. It also absorbs gases 
and odors from the air. The animal and vegetable substances 
found in it render it impure. But the mineral matters, unless 
in excess, are not objectionable. 

When water contains more than a few grains to the gallon of 
carbonate of lime, it is termed hard water. When water is hard 
or impure, it should be boiled before being used for drinking, 
as this destroys the vegetable and animal impurities. 

Water evaporates at all temperatures, boils at 212°, and freezes 
at 32° Fahrenheit. In freezing, the substances dissolved in 
water are expelled. Water, as it approaches the freezing-point, 
expands, and often bursts the vessels in which it is contained. 
In ponds or rivers it expands, becomes lighter, freezes, and 
floats on the surface in the form of ice. 

Water is perfectly neutral. It combines with acids and with 
bases. It becomes sweet, sour, salt, astringent, bitter, or poison- 
ous, according to the nature of the bodies it holds in solution. 




^/^ ^-s 



Salts. 455 

Salts and other Mineral Matters. — The chief purpose of min- 
eral ingredients is to replenish certain tissues, and aid in the 
transfeiTence and absorption of the combustible nutrients, as a 
scaffolding aids in the construction of a building. 

Chloride of sodium, or common salt, is essential to the life of 
the higher aniuials. It exists in all parts of the body. It is 
more abundant in the blood than any other inorganic ingredient 
except water; but it is an active poisonous irritant if taken in 
excess, causing diseases of the mucous membranes, as in catarrh, 
and stiffening of the muscles, as in rheumatism. We take it as 
a natural ingredient in many kinds of food, and as a condiment 
to increase the relish of many others. 

The desire for salt is instinctive. There are people who <lo 
not use salt in food, but it is probable that they obtain sufficient 
sodium and chlorine in the brackish water they drink ; or it may 
he, their habits of life render less salt necessary. 

Salt must be added plentifully to all vegetable food. Th| 
bad effects of a salt-meat diet can be counteracted by the use 
lemon juice and fresh green vegetables, which are rich in potash^*^/^|i^^,j^^ 
salts. 

Salt taken with our food supplies two substances. Its chlo- 
rine supplies the hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice, that 
helps digest our food; and soda, which is an element of the bile, — 
a fluid which must be added to the dissolved or softened food 
before the nourishment can be extracted from it. People would 
very soon become ill if deprived of salt. A person requires 
from one fourth to half an ounce of salt daily. The attractive 
flavor which is developed by cooking and adding salt to our food 
excites the secretion of saliva and gastric juice, and therefore 
helps digestion. The Dutch used to condemn criminals to a 
diet of unsalted food. They suffered great physical torture, 
which soon ended in death. 

Salt is one of the most abundant of all minerals. It is ob- 
tained from springs by evaporation, and from natural mines. 
It is readily soluble in hot or cold water. It is used for packing 
and preserving meats, as it prevents putrefaction by absorbing 
water from the flesh. 

The other mineral ingredients needed in the system are com- 
binations of lime, soda, potash, magnesia, sulphur, phosphorus, and 
iron. Phosphorus, lime, and magnesia are found in meat, fish, 
the cereals, and potatoes. Potash is found in meat, fish, milk, 
vegetables, and the dry seeds and fleshy parts of fruits, iron, 
in flesh, vegetables, and nearly all food, in VGry minute quantities. 



45 6 Tlie Boston Cook Booh. 

Sulphur is in fibrine, albumen, and caseine. There is sufficient 
saline matter, except common salt, in all the ordinary food we 
eat and the water we drink. 

These mineral matters become rearranged and combined 
before becoming part of the body, but they do not undergo any 
chemical change or decomposition. They are absorbed with 
the food, and form for a time part of the animal tissues, after 
which they are discharged with the secretions, and replaced by 
a fresh supply. They are absolutely indispensable to the neur« 
ishment of the body. 



COMBUSTIBLE COMPOUNDS. 



CARBONACEOUS FOODS. 

The first division of combustible compounds is called carbon- 
aceous because they all contain carbon; or heat- producing^ be- 
cause by their burning they generate heat. They consist of 
starch, sugar, fats and oils, gum, and the softer fibres of plants. 
The}' are found in vegetables, cereals, fruits, milk, eggs, and 
the fat of meat. 

Starch. 

Starch is one of the most important of vegetable foods; it 
is found in grains, seeds, and roots, and in the pith and bark 
of plants. When pure, it is a snow-white, glistening powder. 
It consists of exceedingly minute grains, varying in size and 
shape in the different kinds of starch. These grains are cov- 
ered with an outer skin which is insoluble and unchanged by 
cold water; but in boiling, this membrane bursts and the inte- 
rior of each grain dissolves in the water, forming a thick, 
gummy solution. When cool, it .stiffens into a kind of pasty 
mass. 

Starchy food is very unwholesome unless properly cooked. 
It must be mixed with a sufficient amount of liquid, and sub- 
jected to a great degree of heat, that the grains may swell and 
burst. This liquid is sometimes supplied by the boiling water 
in which certain starchy foods are cooked; and sometimes by fat 
which melts with the heat, as in pastry, or by boiling fat, as in 
anything fried. When flour or starchy food is mixed with fat, 
it should be finely and evenly mixed, that the fat may penetrate 



Starch. 457 



every part of the flour, or else it will cake, atid all the grains 
will not burst. Anything that helps to make pastry lighter 
and the fat more evenly distributed, causes the starch grains to 
burst equally, and makes such food more wholesome. 

Vegetables should be put into boiling water to burst the 
starch cells, and set free the confined air, of which there is a 
great deal in many kinds. They should be taken up as soon 
as they are soft, as they absorb water after the grains are fully 
burst. 

Starch in its uncooked, insoluble state is not digested by the 
human stomach. Seeds and fruits which consist of starch, 
especially if it be combined with oil, as in many nuts, if eaten 
uncooked, are very difficult to digest. 

All starchy articles of food should be masticated thoroughly,- 
aud mixed with the saliva. It is more necessary to chew bread 
and potatoes well than meat. Starch is changed by various 
means into sugar. If an acid be added to it in a watery solu- 
tion, and boiled, it becomes clear and transparent, and after a 
time all the starch disappears, and sugar takes its place. The 
same change is caused by the saliva, and during digestion the 
starch is all changed into sugar, so that none of it is found in 
the fluids and secretions of the body. This is easily seen by 
chewing pure starch; after a while it will become sweet. 

Starch contains no albuminous substances, and therefore 
cannot supply any of the materials of which our bodies are 
formed. But it is the source of the warmth of our bodies, and 
the strength we exert. Taken alone, it would be useless as an 
article of food. It must have the addition of albuminoid and 
fatty substances, like milk or meat. 

Starch is prepared by grinding some vegetable matter that 
contains it in abundance, and mixing it with cold water. The 
water is strained and allowed to stand ; the starch settles at the 
bottom, and is then dried and powdered. Cornstarch is ob- 
tained from Indian corn, by a chemical process. The gluti- 
nous, oily elements are freed from the seed by alkaline solutions, 
and the starchy parts are ground and dried. Sago is starch 
from the pith of a species of palm-tiee. Tapioca is from the 
root of a species of the cassava plant of South America- It is a 
coarsely granulated substance. Cassava^ or mandioc, is a more 
finely granulated form of the same root. Arrowroot is from 
the rhizoma, or rootstalk, of a West Indian plant. The natives 
use the roots of a species of the plant in extracting the poison 
of arrows; hence the name.

Sugar. 

Sugar is composed of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon. There 
are three kinds, — cane sugar, or sucrose; grape sugar, or glu- 
cose; milk sugar, or lactose. 

Cane sugar as an article of food closely resembles starch, but 
it is soluble and therefore more easily digested'. It is readily 
distinguished by its sweet taste. It is found in many animal 
juices and also in fruits, but exists mainly in vegetable juices 
which have little or no acid in their sap, like sugar cane, rock 
maple, and beet-root. In its natural state it is dissolved in the 
vegetable fluids, mingled with many other substances. It is 
obtained by crushing the raw material ; the fluids thus obtained 
are heated with a solution of lime, which causes the impurities 
to separate and rise in scum. These are removed, and the 
purified juice boiled down until it solidifies as a brownish de- 
posit. This brown sugar is again dissolved, boiled, and filtered 
through charcoal, evaporated, and crystallized. Molasses is the 
drainage of the raw sugar. Brown sugar is the first product. 
Granulated sugar is brown sugar refined and re-crystallized. 
All brown and moist sugars are inferior in quality; they contain 
water and mineral matter, and are sometimes infested by a 
minute insect. Loaf sugar is the purest. 

Sucrose, or cane sugar, is changed, by the acids of the gastric 
juice and the nitrogenous matter of the food, into grape sugar, 
or glucose. One of the most remarkable properties of sugar is 
Miat it can be decomposed and converted into other substances 
by fermentation. In its chemical relations sugar ranks with 
acids, and combines with bases, as in sugar of lead. It melts at 
320^ and by cooling foi'ms a transparent amber-colored solid 
known as barley sugar. If heated to 420°, it forms a brown 
mass, called caramel. Sugar has great preservative powers, 
and is used in preserving fruits, hams, bacon, etc. 

Glucose, or grape sugar, is abundantly distributed throughout 
the vegetable kingdom. It is found in honey, figs, grapes, and 
other fruits which have acid juices. It is less sweet than cane 
sugar, and is immediately absorbed into the circulation when 
taken into the stomach. It is less soluble and less easily 
crystallized than sucrose. 

Lactose, or milk sugar, is obtained only from the milk of mam- 
malia. It has the composition of cane sugar, and is converted 
into grape sugar when taken as food. 



Fats. 459 



Fats. 

Fats, or oleaginous substances, are composed of carbon, hydro- 
gen, and oxygen, — the two former elements preponderating, 
— and, having a very strong affinity for oxygen, are highly 
combustible. 

Fats are solid; oils are liquid. Fats may be changed to oil by 
a slight accession of heat, and are obtained from both animal 
and vegetable tissues, — suet and dripping, from beef fat; lard, 
from the fat of pigs; butter, from the cream of milk; olive oil, 
from the fleshy pulp of the fruit of the olive tree. Oil is also 
found in nuts, seeds, cereals, and fruits. Croton oil, used for 
medicinal purposes, is from a plant, a native of India; cod liver 
oil, from the liver of cod fish ; castor oil, from the seeds of the 
castor-oil plant. 

Fats and oils contain three different oleaginous substances, 
known as stearine, margarine, and oleine. Oleine is that portion 
of oil that causes its fluidity. It is more abundant in oils than 
fats, and in the fat of swine than in the harder fat of sheep or 
beef. Lard is better than mutton fat or suet for frying, because, 
having more oleine, it can be converted into a liquid sooner. 
Margarine is harder than oleine. It exists in human fat, in but- 
ter, and olive oil. Stearine is the most solid substance of the 
three, and is most abundant in tallow^ and suet. 

The peculiar odor some fats and oils possess is from the pres- 
ence of an acid. In butter it is butyric acid. Glycerine is the 
base common to all the fats. In stearine, the hardest fat, it 
unites with stearic acid; in margarine, a less solid form, with 
margaric acid; in oleine, or oil, wdth oleic acid. 

" Fat forms the chief material of adipose tissue. It serves to 
fill spaces and give rotundity and beauty to the form, to equalize 
external pressure, to diminish the friction of the parts, to give 
suppleness to the tissues, and, being a non-conductor of heat, to 
keep the body warm. An undue accumulation of fat is a species 
of disease." 

Oils and fats will not mix with water; but if an alkaline sub- 
stance, like potash or soda, be added, the oil becomes separated 
into fine particles, and is held suspended in the watery fluid. 
This is called an emulsion, and this is what takes place in intes- 
tinal digestion. The gastric juice, being acid, does not digest 
fat, but only separates it from these substances, that it may 
digest the albuminous portions with which it is mingled. But 




460 The Boston Cook Book. 

the pancreatic fluid, being alkaline, resolves the fat into an 
emulsion. This completes the digestion, then the fats ai-e ab- 
sorbed and received into the general circulation. Having a 
strong affinity for oxygen, these fatty particles in the venous 
blood, when they come in contact with the oxygen of the air, 
burn, and heat is evolved. The power of fat in maintaining 
heat and activity is two and a half times that of starch. 

Oils which are used as food are Jixed oils. Volatile oils are 
found in many condiments and perfumes. Volatile oils can be 
distilled, or changed to vapor, and recondensed into their origi- 
nal form; they leave no permanent stain on paper. Fixed or 
greasy oils cannot be distilled; before changing to vapor they 
recombine into new compounds. 

Gum, Mucilage, Pectose, and Cellulose. 

These are combustible compounds, but are neither starchy, 
saccharine, nor oily. Gum is found in apple and plum trees. 
Gum arable is from a species of acacia, and is soluble. Muci- 
lage is found in onions, quinces, and flaxseed. It forms a jelly 
with water, but does not dissolve like gum arable. Pectose is 
found in many roots, like the turnip; also in the pear and peach. 
When boiled with water it changes to a vegetable jelly, called 
pectine. Currants, pears, peaches, plums, contain pectine, and 
this is what gives firmness to the preserves made from them. 
Cellulose is the woody fibre of stalks of grain, the membrane 
which envelops the grains, husks, and skin of seeds, rinds, 
cores, and stones of fruits. It is the main and almost the sole 
constituent of linen, and of the paper which is made from linen. 



NITROGENOUS FOODS. 

The second division of the Combustible Compounds is called 
nitrogenous, or Jlesh-forminfj foods. Nitrogen is the flesh-form- 
ing element common to all foods. It enters largely into the 
composition of the body, forming sixteen per cent of the 
animal tissue. A liberal supply is necessary to form and 
repair tissue. Although the atmosphere is four fifths nitro- 
gen, we get no supply from that source. It must be sup- 
plied in a state of combination, not as an element, from such 
compounds as have been produced under the influence of life. 
We require organic nitrogenous matter, and not pure nitrogen. 
This is sometimes derived from vegetable sources, but is most 



Albuminous Food. 461 

abundant in animal substances. Animal food is richer and 
more nutritious than vegetable food; but the lattar, if taken in 
large quantities, yields the same amount of flesh-forming mate- 
i-ial. Nitrogenous substances in plants and animals are identical 
in composition; and, from whichever source they are taken, the 
most important consideration is, to digest them and make them 
into blood. 

Nitrogen is an essential part of some of our most powerful 
medicines, like quinine and morphine, and of our most dangerous 
poisons, such as strychnine and prussic acid. 

Nitrogenous foods are also called albuminous, because albumen 
is their common element, though it is called by different names 
in different things. Alhumen is from albus, meaning white. The 
principal varieties of albuminous food are lean meat, fish, eggs, 
milk, cheese, peas, beans, oatmeal, flour, rye, and corn. These 
are treated more fully in other parts of the book, in chapters on 
Bread, Meats, Fish, Eggs, Milk, and Vegetables. 

The albuminous portion of meat is the juice, or albumen, and 
the fibre, or fibrine. In eggs it is the W'hite. In milk it is the 
caseine, or the curdy part that separates when milk has soured. 
In peas and beans it is called vegetable caseine. In flour it 
is gluten, — the sticky, glutinous substance which is left after 
squeezing or washing out the starch. 

Albumen exists in two states, — one soluble in water and one 
insokible. The soluble may be changed to insoluble by heating 
to 120°, or by adding nitric acid. It is the most easily digested 
of all flesh-forming foods. 

Albuminous substances have the property of coagulation; but 
all albuminoids do not coagulate in the same way. The albumen 
of eggs and the juices of meat coagulate by heating to the boiling- 
point. The fibrine of the blood coagulates when exposed to the 
air. Milk coagulates by the addition of an acid. 

Albuminous substances also have the property oi fermentation. 
This occurs principally in substances which are rich in sugar, 
starch, and gluten, like flour, milk, etc. The fermentation in 
flour and milk is explained in the chapter on Bread-Making. 

Fermentation will not take place without air or moisture, and 
a moderate degree of heat. Therefore, if albuminous substances 
be excluded from air and moisture, and kept very hot or very 
cold, they will not ferment. Fermentation is a change in the 
elements of a body composed of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. 
Sugar is composed of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen in equal 
parts ; when sugar ferments, it decomposes and then reunites in 



462 The Boston Cook Book. 

different proportions, forming different compounds, — alcohol, 
carbonic acid, and water. 

Albuminous substances are the only substances which putrefy. 
Putrefaction resembles fermentation, and is due to the presence, 
in large proportion, of the fickle element, nitrogen, and also to 
the laro-e number of elements combined in ail albuminous sub- 
stances. Complicated machinery is always more easily deranged 
than simple; and in all chemical combinations, the more com- 
plex they are, the more unstable. Nitrogen has a very weak 
affinity for other elements, and forms very unstable compounds. 
All substances rich in nitrogen, when exposed to the air, soon 
pass into a state of decomposition, or putrefaction. The oxygen 
of the air has a greater affinity than the nitrogen for the other 
elements, and unites with them very easily. In putrefaction 
the oxygen unites with the carbon to form carbonic acid, 
and with tlie hydrogen to form water. The hydrogen and 
nitrogen unite and form ammonia, and this occasions the 
peculiar, unpleasant odor of all putrefying bodies. In sub- 
\ stances rich in sulphur and phosphorus, the hydrogen unites 
with them and forms sulphuretted and phosphoretted gases 
which are very offensive. Therefore, if we exclude the air or 
oxygen from such substances, we can arrest decomposition. 
This is done by keeping them in air-tight vessels, thus remov- 
ing the oxygen from the outside ; and by boiling or drying, to 
remove that which is diffused within. Freezing will have the 
same effect; also salting or preserving. The salt draws out the 
moisture, hardens the albumen, and prevents the access of 
oxygen. In preserving, by the use of a strong solution of sugar, 
the watery juices are drawn out and formed into a thick syrup 
which excludes the air. 

There are some albuminous substances, such as isinglass and 
gelatine, which are taken as food ; but, strictly speaking, they 
are not flesh-formers. Isinglass is obtained from the sound, 
or swimming bladder, of the sturgeon, and is imported from 
Russia. It is not actually gelatine, but is transformed into it 
by boiling water. Gelatine is obtained from bones. Ossein is 
that part of the bones to which their strength and elasticity are 
due. It is insoluble in cold water, but is slowly dissolved and 
changed into gelatine by being boiled gently under a pressure 
sufficient to prevent the escape of steam. Gelatine is also ob- 
tained from tendons, calves' feet, fish scales, stag's horns, etc. 

There are other varieties of nitrogenous food which are also 
carbonaceous. These are commonly included under the general 



Milh. 463 

term Beverages; namely, tea, coffee, cocoa, and chocolate. The 
nitrogenous principle of tea is theine; of coffee, caffeine; and of 
chocolate, theobromine. Tea also contains iron and manganese. 

Drinks, Beverages, and Liquid Foods are classified as follows : 
water, including rain, well, and mineral spring water; mucilagi- 
nous, farinaceous, cr saccharine drinks, including toast water, 
Irish moss, and barley water, sago, tapioca, arrowroot, and other 
gruels; aromatic or astringent drinks, including, tea, coffee, choco- 
late, cocoa, and herb teas; acidulous drinks, including lemonade, 
raspberry vinegar, and other fruit syrups; animal broths, or drinks 
containing gelatine, including soups, broths, and beef tea; emul- 
sive drinks, including milk ; alcoholic and intoxicating drinks, 
including wines, cider, beer, ale, porter, brandy, and whiskey. 

AVater is discussed under Non-Combustible Foods. Receipts 
for mucilaginous and acidulous drinks, animal broths, and herb 
teas are given in the chapter on Cookery for the Sick. The 
aromatic drinks are included in a separate article under the head 
of Beverages. Alcoholic drinks will not be discussed for want 
of space. Milk is food as well as drink, and deserves especial -^r^"" 
consideration. 

Milk. V ' ' ' 

Milk consists of three distinct substances, which separate "* " * 
from one another after standing awhile, — the cream, curd, 
and whey. 

The cream is the carbonaceous part, and forms ten or twelve 
per cent of the whole. It consists of very small globules of fat, 
or butter, invisible to the naked eye, surrounded by a fine mem- 
brane of caseine or albuminous matter. These are dispersed in 
the milk at first; but as they are lighter than the other parts, 
they rise to the top of the milk in the form of cream. When the 
cream is churned, the membrane of each globule is ruptured, 
causing the butter to cohere in a separate mass. If all this 
caseine, or albuminous matter, be not removed, the butter soon 
becomes rancid. The butter has more margarine than oleine, 
and is therefore hard and firm instead of fluid. It contains 
butyric acid, which gives it its peculiar flavor. 

The curd is the albuminous part of the milk, which separates 
in a solid form whenever milk sours or curdles. This separa- 
tion is occasioned by the action of the oxygen in the air upon 
the nitrogen in the caseine, causing a poition of the caseine to 
ferment. This ferment acts upon the sugar of the miJk, and 
converts it into lactic acid ; and this acid acts as any other acid 



464 The Boston Cook Boole, 

would, and causes the sourness of the milk. The caseine is in- 
soluble in water, but in the milk it is combined with soda, and 
this compound is soluble. So, when the milk sours, and a suffi- 
cient quantity of acid is formed, it seizes upon the soda, takes it 
away from the caseine, and forms lactate of soda. The caseine, 
being thus set free, shrinks, and gathers into an insoluble curdy 
mass. This separation is spontaneous; but it is ofteu caused 
artificially, by the use of an acid, — usually rennet, which is the 
lining membrane of a calf's stomach. The curd thus separated 
is pressed and prepared in various forms of cheese. It contains 
the nutritious elements of the milk in a condensed, but somewhat 
indigestible form. Cheese is more digestible when made from 
fresh than from skimmed milk. 

The whey is the water of the milk that separates from the curd 
In souring, and contains dissolved in it the sugar of milk and the 
saline and mineral ingredients. It is much better to use milk 
in its natural state than to use the butter or cheese obtained 
from it. It is the cheapest form in which animal food can be 
obtained, and should be used freely, especially by the young 01 
weak. 

Condensed milk, when well prepared, is convenient and valu- 
able as an article of diet, if fresh milk cannot be obtained. It 
can only be made from pure milk, and is therefore perfectly 
harmless. 



CONDIMENTS. 

There is another class of foods, called condiments, which should 
not pass unnoticed. 

Food that " tastes good " is digested more readily, and assimi- 
lated more perfectlj'-, so that we really derive more nourishment 
from it. AA^e use many articles with our food to make it taste 
better, which are not in themselves valuable as food. But by 
stimulating the flow of saliva and gastric juice, and enhancing 
the fine flavor of food, they increase the pleasure of eating, and 
render digestion more complete. These are called condiments. 
They are not necessary to persons of sound digestion, and, with 
the exception of salt, should not be used by children, nor by any 
one in large quantities. In perfect digestion there is the first 
taste in the mouth and the after-taste of the digestive organs 
which require satisfaction. " Any cook may gratify the first, 
but the second requires a skilled chemist." 



Condiments. 465 



The principal condiments are salt, pepper, mustard, and some 
herbs, including mint, thyme, parsley, sage, marjoram, summer 
savory, and bay leaves; spices, including ginger, nutmeg, cinna- 
mon, clove, mace, and allspice; and flavorings or extracts of 
lemon, vanilla, orange, almond, pineapple, etc. 

Salt is the only condiment actually necessary to health (see 
page 455). 

Pepper is a stimulant when taken in small quantities, but irri- 
tating if taken in excess. It is the dried berry of a climbing 
plant of tlie piper family. The whole peppers are called pepper- 
corns. These peppercorns are ground, and we have black pepper. 
The outer shells are sometimes removed before grinding, and 
these kernels ground give us lohite pepper ^ which has a different 
flavor and is less pungent than black pepper. Red or Cayenne 
pepper consists of seed-vessels or pods of different species of 
capsicum ground to powder. It is stimulating, and far more 
wholesome than the black pepper, though not as much used. It 
is valuable as a medicine. 

Mustard is used as a condiment and medicine. It is made 
from seeds of black and white mustard, which are crushed be- 
tween rollers, and then pounded in mortars. In small quantities 
it is good for dic^estion. Both red pepper and mustard, if used 
sparingly with indigestible food, like lobster and baked beans, 
are very useful. 

The herbs are used dried or green, and when used judiciously, 
make meats, soups, and sauces more palatable. 

Spices are used in cakes and articles of food containing sugar, 
and sometimes with meats. They are used whole, ground, and 
in the extract. Ginger is the most healthful, and is often used 
in sickness. It is a valuable stimulating tonic in hot weather. 
The other spices are better when mixed in small quantities, less 
of clove and more of cinnamon being used. When combined so 
that no one spice predominates, they are pleasant to the taste. 
Care should be taken lest they hide the natural flavor of the 
food. 

Flavors are all good in small quantities. Almond, vanilla, 
lemon, and pineapple are often adulterated. They should never 
be added while the article is hot, as the heat wastes the strength 
of the flavor. Vanilla beans are better than the extract. It is 
always well, if possible, to use the fresh fruit juice. 

Lemon juice and vinegar, used in moderation, increase the sol- 
vent properties of the gastric juice, and are useful with meats 
and vegetables which are difficult of digestion.

PROPER PROPORTION OF FOOD. 

These different kinds of food, ivater, salts, sugar, starch, fat^ 
and alhumen, must be combined in our diet; for a simple sub- 
stance which fulfils only one of the purposes required in oui 
food will not support life. A man cannot live on water or salt, 
yet he would soon die without them. A diet composed exclu- 
sively of fats, starch, or sugar is equally incapable of supporting 
life. The albuminous foods, though they are considered the most 
nutritious, must be combined with the others to produce the 
desired result. 

Milk is the only substance prepared by nature expressly as an 
article of food. Seeds grow, and produce plants and fruits after 
their kind; but milk is prepared as the natural f«od of the 
young of all mammalia. A baby fed on milk develops in every 
part; therefore milk must supply every requisite for the growth 
of the young body, and the proportions in woman's milk may be 
taken as the standard for human food. Milk analyzed is found 
to contain water, salt, fat, sugar, and caseine, — the five ele- 
ments of food. It has enough of flesh -producing elements to 
restore the daily waste, and enough heat-giving elements to feed 
the oxygen in Ibreathing. But when the teeth are formed, the 
child's system needs a greater proportion of some elements than 
are supplied by the milk, and other foods are gi*adualiy added 
to the diet. 

Eggs also contain all the necessary elements ; a diet of seven 
eggs per day furnishes all the nutrition a person needs. But 
the elements in eggs are too highly condensed, and are not 
properly proportioned for a continuous diet. 

Many articles of food do not contain all these elements, and 
it is very important to proportion our food rightly, so that one 
kind will supply what another lacks. A certain bulk is also 
necessary in our food to stimulate a thorough action of the diges- 
tive fluids. If the quantity be not sufl&cient to distend the 
stomach, so that the churning motion of the muscular coats can 
affect every part of the food, the digestion is imperfect. Dys- 
pepsia is often caused by lack of sufficient quantity of food, and 
by weakness of the muscles of the stomach. If this requisite 
quantity be wholly nutritious or highly condensed food, capable 
of entire absorption, the effect is too stimulating, and serious 
disorders of the alimentary canal are the result. To remedy 
this, it is necessary to have a certain amount of innutritious 



Proportion of Food. 467 

food, which furnishes the bulk required, and gives all parts of 
the digestive apparatus their proper amount of work to perform. 

Many persons argue in favor of a vegetable diet, as we can 
obtain from vegetables al) the necessary elements. There have 
been many cases known where people lived to an extreme age 
who used exclusively a vegetable diet, and others who lived 
equally as long upon animal food. But the general rule is, that 
we find the highest degree of bodily and mental vigor only 
among those who make use of a mixed diet. One of the strong- 
est physiological arguments in favor of this rule is found in the 
structure and conformation of the teeth and alimentary canal. 
Part of the teeth are of the carnivorous, or flesh-eating kind, 
and part of the herbivorous, or vegetable-eating kind. The 
alimentary canal is equally well adapted to the digestion of ani- 
mal or vegetable food, or an admixture of both. The proper 
proportion, by weight, is one third of animal, and two thirds of 
vegetable food. 

" Nature has given us an unerring guide to a proper choice of 
diet. An unperverted appetite is the voice of the physical sys- 
tem making known its needs, and it may always be trusted to 
indicate the food necessary to the preservation of health. But 
as the voice of nature is often unheeded, it is necessary to exer- 
cise intelligence in selecting our food and adapting it to the 
circumstances of life. By a proper choice we can often coim.^^ 
teract the effects of a violation of nature's laws. 



tsAt^y 



ADAPTATION OF FOOD TO CLIMATE, AGE, OCCIT- 
PATION, AND STATE OF HEALTH. 

In examining the foods adopted by different nations and 
classes of people, we find that many choose instinctively the 
kind best adapted to their individual needs. The climate, occu- 
pation, and water influence their choice. 

Climate. — Animal food is better for cold than for hot cli- 
mates. We breathe more rapidly, take in more oxygen in cold 
weather, and the internal fire burns up more of the food. We 
exercise more, and this causes more rapid wearing out of muscle 
and flesh. Fat meat is not digested easily unless exercise be 
taken freely; more oxygen must be mixed with it to produce 
heat than is required for sugar and starch. In summer, when 
we exercise less, the waste is less, and we need less warmths 



468 The Boston Cook Book. 

giving food. The starch and sugar obtained from fruits and 
vegetables are easily digested, and furnish suflficient warmth. 
The Esquimaux or Greenlander consumes a large quantity of 
fat, or blubber oil, the most condensed form of carbonaceous 
food. This gives him the amount of heat necessary in an ex- 
tremely cold climate. With this blubber he mixes some indi- 
gestible substances to give the needed bulk for the perfect 
action of the stomach. The people of Norway, Sweden, and 
Russia use large quantities of oily Jish. In China, India, and 
other extremely hot climates, rice is the universal food. Rice 
contains a very small amount of flesh-forming material, being 
mostly starch, which is changed into sugar by the action of the 
saliva. The natives of rice-eating countries owe much of their 
lack of spirit and energy to this defective diet. But when eaten 
with butter or olive oil, and made into curries, pilaf, and pilau, 
with a small amount of flesh or fish, it supplies all the elements 
necessary for life in such climates^.. The Spaniard in his olla 
podrida — a stew of peas, bacon, or fowl, with red pepper — finds 
all the necessary elements. The red pepper, used so largely in 
the curries and other dishes common to hot climates, stimulates 
the liver, which is naturally weakened by the long-continued 
heat, and thus assists digestion. The Arab chooses dates. parched 
grains, mare's or cameVs milk. The Turk adds to these melons 
and cucumbers. As we come northward again, we find more 
flesh-forming material in the polenta (a dish made of Indian 
corn) and the chestnuts, macaroni, and cheese used by the Italians. 
The pot-au-feu is the principal dish of every peasant in France. 
This furnishes the cheapest form of nutriment, and contains all 
the necessary elements of food. 

Tne waters of a country sometimes determine the national 
food. In Ireland, where the waters are strongly impregnated 
with lime, they furnish what the potato, which is richer in pot- 
ash and soda, lacks. When potatoes are combined with cabbage 
and pork, as in kolcannon, the flesh-forming element is supplied; 
and this, on account of the cost of meat, the laboring classes are 
unable to obtain in any other form. In England and Scotland, 
■where the waters are soft, oats and wheat, which are rich in 
phosphates, are the staple diet. When combined with milk, 
eggs, rice, peas, beans, bacon, and cheese, their food is complete. 

To satisfy the natural instinct to obtain these five elements, 
we all prefer our bread with butter or cream, our meat with 
potatoes, our rice witii butter, milk, or eggs; our fish we cook 
m fat ; \\ e eat liver with bacon and ham, or bacon with eggs ; 



Choice of Food. 469 



we eat clieese with crackers, butler with cauliflower or cabb.ige, 
salt with all vegetables, oil with salad, and fresh vegetables with 
salt meat. Fruits and foods intended to be eaten raw contain a 
large proportion of water. ^ This is supplied, when lessened by 
evaporation, by cooking and soaking in water. In cooking 
meats, we endeavor to retain all the juices, which are largely 
water. In spring we crave fresh green vegetables and salads, 
that we may have the potash salts of which there has been a 
deficiency in the winter diet. 

Occupation affects our choice of diet. Persons engaged in sed- 
entary occupations cannot digest as much nor as easily as those 
who labor out of doors. Tliey should have food that gives the 
greatest amount of nourishment in the smallest compass, and it 
should be served in the most digestible form. Those who tax 
their brains severely should have animal food and the most 
digestible forms of starchy and warmth-giving foods. Those 
who exercise freely in the open air may take a larger quantity, 
and it need not be the most digestible, as they require food that 
will stay by them. The laborer instinctively prefers potatoes 
underdone, or *' with a bone in them;" and he chooses salt 
meat, not only because it is cheaper, but because it stands by 
him longer. The salt causes him to drink water freely, and 
this supplies the waste caused by excessive perspiration. A 
diet of vegetables, peas, beans, cheese, oatmeal, bacon, and 
the cheaper, more indigestible parts of meat properly cooked, 
is suitable for laboring people. 

State of Health. — In selecting food with reference to health it 
must be remembered that there are certain general rules which 
have been established by the best authorities through many ages 
and in a great variety of circumstances; there are, however, 
some exceptions to these general rules. Milk is considered a 
wholesome food, yet there are some persons who cannot take it. 
Cheese is a cheap and nourishing food for laboi-ing people, but 
there are some persons to whom it is an active poison. This is 
also true of oysters and strawberries. These exceptions are 
owing to some idiosyncrasy of the palate or weakness of the 
digestive organs, and should be regarded only as exceptions, 
which do not affect the general principle. 

The application of these general principles, given throughout 
this book in connection with the vaiious articles used as food, 
must be left to each individual; but to tliose who have given 
the subject no serious study a few hints may be heljtful. They 
will be found in the article treating of Cooking for the Invalid. 



470 The Boston Cook Book, 



NOURISHING AND STIMULATING FOOD. 

There is another classification of food which it is well to con- 
sider briefly. In its effect upon the system food is nourishing 
and stimulating, or the reverse. 

Nourishing foods are those which serve to develop perfectly 
every animal function, but do not increase the strength and 
speed of organic action beyond the point of full nutrition. 
Bread, vegetables, fruits, sugar, salt, and water are nourishing- 
foods. 

Nourishing and Stimulating Food. — All food that nourishes 
the body is in one sense stimulating, as it gives renewed energy 
to the bodily functions. But there are foods which impart a 
speed and energy to the organs above that necessary to per- 
fect nutrition; these are termed stimulating foods. Animal 
food is of this class. 

Stimulants. — Alcoholic drinks and condiments are classed as 
stimulants, because they impart no nourislnnent, but act simply 
as excitants to preternatural activity. 

Innutritions foods are those which are not assimilated ; which 
are by nature indigestible, or have been made so by improper 
combinations and modes of cooking. The bran of v^'heat, fried 
or greasy food, heavy bread, and rich soggy pastry are either 
entirely unassimilated, and therefore not nourishing, or they 
weaken the system by exciting particular organs to excessive 
action 



Digestion, 47 




DIGESTION. 



In studying digestion, it is well to keep in mind the twofold 
division of food into nitrogenous, or flesh-forming, and carbona- 
ceous, or heat-producing, elements. The process of digestion 
differs with the character of the food. The purpose of diges- 
tion is to change and combine all the elements of food into a 
fluid which will mingle with the blood, become assimilated, and 
furnish nutriment for the body. 

Digestion is not confined to the stomach. It begins with in- 
sallvation in the mouth, and, after deglutition^ is carried on in the 
stomach and intestines, the process continuing through the entire 
length of the alimentary canal, — a tube varying in diameter, 
and thirty-six feet in length. 

The first process in digestion, as in any chemical analysis, is 
to crush the materials. The teeth are the grinders for reducing 
the food. If we bolt our food or swallow it in lumps, the soft 
coats of the stomach are made to do the tearing and grinding 
work of the teeth. A solvent being necessary, the saliva is 
secreted from the blood, and is poured through three pairs of 
glands into the mouth, each pair supplying a different saliva. 
This softens the starch and tender cellulose. Animals, like the 
beaver, which feed chiefly on woody matters, have very large 
salivary glands. 

In health the saliva is always alkaline, especially during and 
after meals. It lubricates the mouth, and moistens the food so 
that it may assume a pasty condition. It is also necessary to 
the sense of taste, everything being tasteless that the saliva can- 
not dissolve. For this reason we cook and season our food so 
that it will excite the flow of the saliva. 

'^ This saliva is poured into the mouth not to he cast out, but to 
do a specific work, then pass into the stomach and be again ab- 
sorbed. If the system be drained of the saliva by profuse spit- 
ting, as is the case with those who use tobacco freely, the order 
of bodily functions is reversed, and the mouth is made to do the 
work of the kidneys, which is to carry away a large amount of 
the superfluous water and all the waste salts." 



472 The Boston Cook Book. 

The saliva consists mostly of water, witli a very small amount of 
saline matter and about five parts in one thousand of ptyalin, an 
albuminous ingredient, or ferment, which has the power of con- 
verting the starchy portions of food into sugar, and sugar into 
lactic acid, but does not act upon nitrogenous iood. The saliva 
froths easily, and aids in carrying air into the stomach. 

This is the first step in digestion, and the most important, as 
any error in the beginning leads to evil consequences vshich affect 
the whole process. It is also important, because it is wholly a 
voluntary process. While the food is in the mouth, we may 
masticate it thoroughly or imperfectly, and swallow or reject 
it. But w^hen deglutition has carried it into the stomach, it is 
wholly beyond our control, and we are not responsible for the 
remainder of the process, only so far as it may be affected by 
error in the first stages. Bread, potatoes, and all starchy foods 
should be thoroughly masticated, and mingled with the saliva. 
Meat may be swallowed hastily, or knives may be made to do 
the work of the teeth iu masticating animal food; but no chemist 
can prepare an artificial saliva to be mixed with stai'chy food, to 
save the trouble of chewing it. If a piece of dry light bread be 
masticated thoroughly, it will ci'umble and be quickly mixed 
with the saliva, and become sweeter the longer it is kept in the 
mouth. The alkaline saliva changes the starch into sugar, and 
begins the digestion. Try to chew a piece of hot bread and it 
at once assumes a pasty condition, which neither teeth nor saliva 
can penetrate, and is swallowed involuntarily. A piece of putty 
would not be more indigestible. If this experiment be tried, 
no other argument would be needed against the use of hot 
bread. 

The stomach carries on the second part of digestion. The 
presence of food excites the flow of a fluid called the gastric juice ^ 
which is secreted in large quantities in the mucous mem- 
brane of the stomach. At the same time the muscular coats 
of the stomach contract, and produce a sort of churning motion, 
which carries the food round and round and over and over, ex- 
posing all parts of it to the action of the fluid. This gastiic 
juice is always decidedly acid in its nature, containing hydro- 
chloric acid. The lactic acid formed from the sugar in the 
mouth is also present in the stomach. This acid arrests the 
work begun in the mouth on the starchy foods, renders the alkali 
neutral, and acts only on albuminous food. It contains an 
albuminous ingredient, or ferment, called pepsi?i, in about the 
same propoition as tlie ptyalin of the saliva. The pepsin 



Digestion. 473 



mixed with the lactic acid is powerful enough to dissolve all 
the albumen and fibrine of flesh food into albuminose, and sets 
free the starch, sugar, and fat, melts the fat, but does not 
change either. When there is an excess or deficiency of acid 
in the stomach, the digestion is abnormal. Pepsin is sometimes 
used as a remedy for dyspepsia, and is obtained from the 
stomachs of young, healthy pigs which are kept hungry. 

As all food which is to nourish the system must be converted 
into a fluid form, any substances which are taken in fluid 
form and afteiw^ard solidified in the stomach, as blood or juice 
of flesh, milk, and raw eggs, must be changed again to a per- 
manent liquid form before they can be absorbed. All nitro- 
genous matters are not only dissolved by the gastric fluid, but 
are modified so as to remain dissolved. These changed albu- 
minous matters are called peptones. Oil plays an important 
part in these changes, so that, although oil is not digested, it 
serves a useful purpose in passing through the stomach. 

The stomach would digest itself were it not protected by a 
sheathing of mucus and by a continual forming of cells called 
epithelium^ during the process of digestion. The liquid or watery 
portions of food enter at once into the circulation by absorption. 
If too much water be taken with food, it dilutes the gastric 
juice and retards the digestion; as all that is not needed must 
be absorbed before digestion can go on. 

Digestion is also retarded by the presence of very hot or very 
cold food, as everything taken into the stomach has to be 
changed to the normal temperature of 100' . A large amount of 
food overloads the stomach, distends the muscular coats, and 
lessens the power of motion. Too little food is also a mistake, 
as the stomach needs a certain amount of bulk to work upon. 
Continual or irregular eating is wholly contrary to the intention 
of nature, since it does not allo.*^ the stomach time to rest and 
to form new cells to secrete digestive fluids. Flesh food that 
is finely minced, like hash, croquettes, and many entrees, passes 
rapidly through the stomach without being dissolved by the 
gastric juice; but when taken in larger pieces it remains long 
enough to be all digested. 

The digestive power of the stomach is weakened when there 
is any undue action in any other part of the body, as in great 
muscular exertion or in powerful excitement of the brain. 
Therefore we should eat sparingly at first, when fatigued by 
exercise or study or when unduly excited, and should rest 
awhile after eating. 



474 ^^ Boston Cook Book, 

Lactic acid, small portions of sugar and digested nitrogenou3 
substances, pass into the blood by absorption through the 
stomach veins. Thus the contents of the stomach leave it in 
two directions : a portion is absorbed through the coats of the 
stomach by the process of osmose, or the passage of fluids 
through animal membranes ; the remainder passes through the 
pyloric opening into the duodenum and intestines for the com- 
pletion of digestion. Food from the stomach enters the duode- 
num in an acid state, and in the intestines is mingled with 
three alkaline fluids, all containing soda. 

The pancreatic fluid, secreted from the pancreas, digests the 
fatty matters. It breaks the large granules of oil and fat into a 
great many minute particles, and converts them into a milky 
liquid called chyle, which mixes freely with water and passes 
through the tissues of the intestines into the lacteals. It also 
changes the starch into sugar, and the sugar into lactic acid, but 
has very little action on albuminous substances. 

The hile, secreted from the liver, plays an important part in 
intestinal digestion, the exact nature of which is unknown. 
Bile is a complex liquid, consisting of biliary acid in combina- 
tion with soda. It certainly aids in the absorption of fat, and 
many suppose its purpose is to lubricate the walls of the intes- 
tinal canal; from its soapy consistency it effects a smooth, non- 
irritating passage of the contents. If there be any lack or 
surplus of the bile, it soon produces an injurious result in the 
system. The bile is in the intestines, and not in the stomach 
except when the act.'on of the stomach is inverted, in nausea 
and vomiting; then the bile is forced up into the stomach in- 
stead of down into the intestines. 

The intestinal juice, secreted in the mucous membrane the 
entire length of the intestine, combines the active and digestive 
powers of all the other secretions. 

The lactic acid is formed so rapidly from the digestion of 
sugar that the contents of the intestine quickly becomes acidu- 
lous, and this completes the digestion of any portions of nitro- 
genous food not fully digested in the stomach. The combined 
amount of the salivary, gastric, pancreatic, biliary, and intes- 
tinal fluids secreted daily is twenty-one pints, of which the 
gastric juice forms more than one half. There are mechanical 
aids to intestinal as well as stomach digestion. The writhing, 
worm-like motion, or peristaltic movement, of the muscular coats 
of the intestines forces the food downward, and exposes alj 
portions of it to the digestive fluids. 



Absorption. 475 



Notwithstanding all these powerful agents in digestion, a 
portion of useful matter passes through the intestines un- 
changed; and if there be a deficiency of either fluid, or a 
weakness of the muscular coats, or too great a quantity of irri- 
tating substance, like cellulose, woody fibre, bran, etc., the 
amount is increased. This is carried, with the innutritions 
portion, into the larger intestine, and forms a part of the 
excretions. 

FUBLiC 
ABSORPTION. '"'^FtAt^'^ 

The nutritive and perfectly digested portions of food are 
absorbed partly by the veins of the stomach, entering at once 
Into the circulation, and partly by the intestines. The lining 
membrane of the intestines folds over and over upon itself, like 
a ruffle, along the entire edge; this is fidl of little tubes, or villi, 
which absorb the chyle. 

The blood vessels absorb the nutritive elements from the villi 
and carry them to the veins in two ways: 1st. Through the 
portal vein into the liver, where it penetrates every part of the 
liver, then passes out through the hepatic vein into the veins 
near the heart; 2d. Through the lacteals, which are attached to 
the lining membrane of the intestines and empty into the 
thoracic duct, a tube extending along the spine, and then into 
the subclavian vein, which lies in tlie left side of the neck, 
under the collar bone. The veins also bring with them the 
lymph, — a thin colorless fluid which comes from the absorbent 
vessels situated all over the body, and which contains the 
worn-out particles. 

Then the venous blood, supplied from the lacteals with new 
material, and from the lymphatic vessels with waste materials, 
enters the heart through the upper door, or right auricle, passes 
through the valves down into the right ventricle; out through 
the pulmonary artery into the lungs, where, as purple venous 
blood, it penetrates to the most remote capillaries. 

If the lungs be full of pure fresh air, the oxygen changes the 
purple blood into red blood, and burns up the impurities. The 
waste products of the combustion of carbon and hydrogen are 
expelled from the lungs at every breath in the form of carbonic 
acid and watery vapor; and not until now can the new elements 
in the blood, obtained from the food, become in reality food, or 
perfect blood. 



4/6 The Boston Cook Booh, 

This oxygenized or vitalized blood now returns from the lungs, 
and enters the heart through the left upper door, or left auricle; 
the valves open and allow it to pass into the left ventricle, 
then out through the aorta, or great artery, from which the 
arteries carry it to the capillaries all over the system. 

In the capillaries the new material is deposited wherever 
•needed, and changed by cell growth into new tissue. The 
Jymphatic vessels take up all that is not needed, with the 
worn-out portions; and the veins then carry this impure blood 
back again to the lungs and heart. 

Thus a continuous circulation is established, the blood coursing 
over the whole body once in every three to five minutes, the time 
varying with the amount of exercise and the state of health. 
During this circulation the combustible compounds are burned 
by the oxygen received into the blood in the lungs, the carbona- 
ceous products of combustion are expelled through the lungs as 
carbonic acid gas and watery vapor, and the nitrogenous pro- 
ducts through the kidneys in the form of urates. 

" This process of digestion and absorption is really a kind of 
preliminary cooking process, going on from the mouth downwards 
all the way to the colon ; and from every part of the long canal 
tiny lacteals and absorbing veinlets carry off contributions of 
food either to the general store of chyle, or to the venous blood 
which is hurrying back to the heart." 



NUTRITION". 

♦' Albumen is the basis of all animal nutrition. This is seen 
in the bird's egg during incubation. Under the influence of 
warmth and oxygen, all the tissues, membranes, and bones are 
developed from albumen." 

In the human body a nutritious fluid is prepared from the 
food, and supplies materials for growth and repair. This fluid 
is the blood, and when examined under the microscope is found 
to consist of a clear colorless fluid, of a saline, alkaline, and 
albuminous nature, and an immense number of infinitely minute 
blood globules, or corpuscles. These corpuscles consist of an 
albuminous membrane called globulin, filled 'Vith a red coloring 
matter, hematine, in wliich there is much iron. 

This liquid albuminous portion of the blood must be changed 
to fibrine before it can nourish the muscles of the body. The 



Nutrition. 477 



change of the gluten, caseine, and all the varieties of albuminous 
food into fibrine is a gradual process, begun in the lacteals, con- 
tinued in the circulation of the blood, and completed in the lungs 
by the oxygen whicli they receive in breathing. This fibrine 
remains in the liquid state, owing to the alkaline nature of the 
blood, and is distributed by the circulation into all parts of the 
structure, where it gradually coagulates into a netwoik of tough 
thread-like fibies, enclosing in its meshes the blood corpuscles, 
and is changed by cell growth into new tissue, solid flesh and 
bone. 

The nervous system is also built and repaired from albumen. 
Nervous matter is about seven per cent albumen, and is the 
material by which we are put into relation with the external 
world. By it we see, hear, feel, taste, smell, and are conscious 
of existence. 

Each elementary cell or particle of tissue, whether of bone, 
flesh, or nerves, seems to have a sort of gland-like power, not 
only of attracting materials from the blood, but of causing them 
to assume its structure and participate in its properties. The 
bones and teeth select and appropriate the phosphates of lime, 
and magnesia, also fluorine. The muscles and nerves take 
fibrine, phosphates of magnesia, and potash. The cartilages 
seek for soda; the hair, skin, and nails are made up of silica. 
Iron is needed in the coloring matter of the blood, the black 
pigment of the eye, and in the hair. Sulphur exists in the hair, 
and phosphorus in the brains. The glands of the mouth take 
the substances necessary to form saliva; those of the eye, the 
elements of tears; the coats of the stomach, gastric juice; and 
the liver, bile. Each part of the body has the power to select, 
from the common supply, the material which suits it best for 
building and growing. 

If the conversion of albumen into fibrine be incomplete, the 
tissues are imperfectly nourished. The formation of tubercles 
in the lungs is caused by half-formed cells and coagulated albu- 
men deposited in the lungs. This is caused by a deficiency of 
the oily matter, which is necessary for the perfect formation of 
cells and the growth of healthy tissue. Hence for these cases 
physicians prescribe cod-liver oil. 

Distilled spirits coagulate the albumen which ought to go 
into the blood; this prevents the proper digestion of food, and 
causes one of the great evils resulting from their use. The ner- 
vous tissue is thus deprived of nourishment, which is one of the 
causes of delirium tremens. 



473 The Boston Cook Book, 

Every twinge of pain in neuralgia is the nerves crying out 
for better blood. Imperfect digestion and assimilation of food 
are the chief causes of neuralgia. 

Nutrition, though seemingly complex, is really a simple pro- 
cess; albumen is changed to fibrine, and fibrine to flesh. The 
relation of each to the other has been aptly compared to that of 
the raw cotton, the spun yarn, and the woven fabric. 

The minute corpuscles in the blood are constantly building up 
the body, very much as the coral insect builds its structure. The 
work of each corpuscle is too small for our conception ; but, taken 
in the aggregate, the result is the wonderful growth and renova- 
tion of the human body. And what is still more wonderful, 
every organ of the body is on the alert to keep the whole system 
in natural health. The activity of the vessels which remove 
the waste particles from the blood is untiring. The kidneys 
are the scavengers of the body, and stand next to the lungs in 
renovating it. If too much water be drunk, the kidneys, lungs, 
and skin carry it off, for fear that the blood should become too 
watery. We may cease to convey food into the body for days 
with no evil consequences; but let the removing organs cease 
operations for a single day, and disease ensues. 



LIFE AND MOTION.i 

^^te-B^' Circulation of Water. — As a plant grows, water from the soil 
or air unites chemically with carbon, and forms the w^oody fibre 
of the stem, the sugar of the sap, and the starch of the seed. 
When the plant dies, the water is again set free from its struc- 
ture and passes into the air. The starch and sugar, also, which 
the plant yields having been consumed by some animal, the 
water which they contain passes into the air through the lungs 
and skin. Thus the same water is caused to revolve in a circle 
of life-sustaining combinations. Within a single hour it may 
be in some vegetable structure in the form of sugar; then it 
may pass into and circulate through some animal system and 
be discharged as vapor from the lungs, and afterwards become 

1 This article is mainly an abstract of the chapters on the "Circulation 
of Matter," contained in "Johnston's Chemistry of Common Life." It is 
inserted here as bearing upon the general subject of food, and with the hope 
that all who read this will read the original. 



Life and Motion. 479 



absorbed by thirsty leaves and aid in the growth of flowers and 
fruits. 

Circulation of Carbon. — Vegetables, which are largely starch 
and carbon, absorb carbonic-acid gas from the atmosphere, which 
contains thirty- three grains of carbon in every square inch. K 
the world were all dry land, and covered with dense vegetation, 
all the carbon would be extracted from the atmosphere in twenty- 
three years. This carbonic acid is restored to the atmosphere by 
the waste and decay of vegetable matter, by the exhalations from 
animals, and by combustion. 

The leaf of a living plant draws in carbonic acid gas from the 
air, and gives off the oxygen contained in it, retaining only the 
carbon. The roots drink in moisture from the soil; and out of 
the carbon and water contained in it the plant forms starch, 
sugar, fat, and other substances. 

The animal takes the starch, sugar, or fat into its stomach, 
and draws in oxygen through its lungs. New chemical combina- 
tions are thus formed, undoing the work of the plant, and send- 
ing back to the air, from the lungs and skin, both the starch and 
oxygen, in the form of carbonic-acid gas and water. The same 
material is constantly circulating, — now floating in invisible air, 
now forming the substance of the growing plant, now of the 
moving animal, and now diffusing itself through the air ready 
to go its round again. It forms part of a vegetable to-day; to- 
morrow it is in a man's backbone; a week hence it' may have 
passed through another plant and into another animal. 

In burning coal, we cause its carbon to unite with the oxygen 
of the air and to disappear as carbonic acid gas. The carbon 
returns to the atmosphere from which it may have been taken 
millions of years ago when it was appropriated by the growing 
plants, which, in the form of vegetable matter, were afterwards 
buried beneath the surface of the earth only to reappear ages 
subsequently in the form of fuel. The earth itself breathes 
out carbonic acid, sometimes with water, sometimes alone. It 
sparkles in the springs of Carlsbad and Seltzer; it kills man and 
beast in the terrible " Valley of Death " in the island of Java. 

In this way is supplied the loss of that which is daily buried 
by the shell fish and coral insects in the limestone formations 
and coral growths. These rocks contain, chained down in seem- 
ingly everlasting imprisonment, two fifths of their weight of 
carbonic acid. 

Circulation of Nitrogen. — Gluten and fibrine are distinguished 
from starch and fat by containing nitrogen. The nitrogen forms 



480 The Boston Cook Book. 

four fifths of the air. It exists also in ammonia, ar.d in aqua 
fortis, or nitric acid. These two compound bodies exist and are 
found in the soil; and from the soil the nitrogen is taken up by 
the plants, and gluten is formed. When the animal consumes 
the gluten, it builds up and renews the waste of its several parts. 
The crluten of the plant is transformed into the flesh and tissues 
of the living animal. Thus the nitrogen of the soil through 
the plant has reached the dignity of being a part of breathing, 
intellectual man. 

Having reached this form, this restless element, nitrogen, 
grows weary of inactivity and moves on. Not only the living 
body as a whole is in constant motion, but even its minutest 
parts are continually active. '' They are like the population of 
a great city moving to and fro, coming and going continually, 
weeded out and removed every hour by deaths and departures, 
yet as unceasingly kept up in numbers by new in-comers, chang- 
ing from day to day so insensibly as to escape observation, yet 
so evidently that after a few years scarcely a known face can 
be discovered among the congregated thousands." Scarcely has 
the gluten of the plant been fitted comfortably to its place in the 
muscle, the skin, or the hair of the animal, when it begins to be 
dissolved again and is removed. 

The living animal absorbs much oxygen from the air by its 
lungs. One part of it converts the carbon of the food into car- 
bonic acid; another portion is built into the substance of the 
body; a large part is employed in dissolving and removing tlie 
waste in urea, uric acid, etc. This urea and uric acid return to 
the soil from which the nitrogen they contain originally came, 
and where they are reconverted into ammonia, nitric acid, and 
other substances, and are now ready to enter into new roots and 
go the rounds again. 

The undigested gluten is rejected in the animal droppings, 
mingles with the soil, and is changed to ammonia and nitric 
acid. The vegetables which die undergo natural decay, arid 
again enter the soil and air as elements. Animal bodies tlif-m- 
selves die at last, and the nitrogen they contain is made to assume 
the forms in which plants are able to take it up. The ammonia 
and volatile compounds of nitrogen, produced by animal and 
vegetable decay, rise in the form of gas or vapor, and escape 
into the air. The rains of heaven wash the ammonia out and 
bring it back to the earth. Part of it is, however, resolved into 
elementary nitrogen, and is thus lost to plants. To make up 
for this loss, nitric acid is formed in the air in small quantities. 



Circulation of Matter. 481 

Through the agency of the electric currents the oxygen and 
nitrogen of the air unite to form nitric acid. Ammonia is given 
otf by volcanoes, and is returned to the earth by the rains and 
snows. 

Circulation of Mineral Matter. — Everything which the animal 
body contains is derived, directly or indirectly, from vegetable 
foods; and the mineral or ash it leaves, when burned, must have 
come from the soil through the plant. When the animal dies, 
its body sooner or later returns to the soil. So we have another 
circle in which the earthy matter of animals and plants moves. 
It ascends from the soil to the plant, then to the animal, and 
back again to mother earth, so that it is really " dust to dust." 

The plant does not absorb all mineral matters, but selects the 
rarer and more precious materials from the soil, and such as are 
held in solution by water. Phosphoric acid, lime, magnesia, and 
saline matter, of which common salt is a representative, are the 
principal substances chosen. The animal eating the vegetable, 
these substances enter its stomach, and are dissolved and enter 
the blood. The vessels provided for the purpose select the re- 
quired material, and, like ships in commerce, sail away on the 
blood rivers to their destined havens. The saline portion is car- 
ried to the blood and tissues. The phosphate of lime goes to the 
bones, and phosphate of potash to the muscles. After a time 
the animal, partly as it wastes and finally when it dies, returns 
to the soil all that the plant took from it. New plants receive 
it, and it goes the rounds again. 

So, over and over again, as the modeller fashions his clay, plant 
and animal are formed out of the same material. Is all sense- 
less matter to be constantly working, and are we intelligent 
beings to idle away a precious but limited existence ? One 
should learn from this always to work for a definite purpose. 

How lovely is the plant in its position of bond-servant of man! 
How willing and interesting! It serves till death, yet rises again 
rejoicing as ever, when spring returns, to renew its destined 
toil, 

The least alteration in the natural constitution of things would 
insure the extinction of animal and vegetable life.

by its roots ; carlonic acid, by 
its leaves; nitrogen, in the form 
of ammonia and nitric acid; 
minerals, in the form of phos- 
phoric acid, lime, common and

The Animal takes in, water, 
starch, fat, gluten, and mineral 
matters, in the form of vege- 
table and animal food, into its 
stomach; and oxygen into its 
lungs. 




The Soil takes in, urea and 
other animal excretions, dead 
animals and plants. 



The Plant produces, oxygen, 
from its leaves ; sugar, starch, 
gluten, and mineral matters, in 
its sap and solid substances. 



The Animal produces, car^^ 
honic acid and water, which are 
exhaled from the skin and 
lungs ; urea, -phosphates, and 
other salts, in the excretions; 
the fat in the body, which is 
in time breathed away in the 
form of carbonic acid; water 
and perfect muscle, hone, blood, 
and tissues, to build and rejjair 
the body. 

The Soil produces, carhon in 
the form of wood and coal, and 
in spring water; ammonia, ni- 
tric acid, and other nitrogenous 
compounds ; phosphoric acid, 
lime, common salt, and other 
mineral jnatters. 



So the movement is circular; the beginning is the end. A 
marvellous commerce appears; soil, plant, and animal commin- 
gling ; the elements of each being at different times the elements 
of all, and their interchange perpetual. 



Chocolate Reception. 483 



ADDITIONAL RECIPES. 



Reception 2 qts. milk. 
Chocolate. 1 lb. cocoa powder. 

3 rouDcIed tbsp. white 
sugar. 



1 pt. cream. 

2 eggs. 

3 tsp. vauilla extract. 



Bring milk to boil, work the cocoa in a little of the 
cold milk, then stir into the boiling milk till smooth. 
Boil ten minutes, add the sugar and cream, and stir well 
while boiling. Turn into a double boiler and keep the 
water in lower boiler almost at boiling point for half an 
hour. Then beat the eggs very light, add them and re- 
move immediately from the fire. When cool add the 
flavoring. 

This can be made in the morning, and when ready to 
serve, put from one to two tablespoonfuls of the prepara- 
tion into the cup and fill with boiling water. 

By cooking the cocoa we have a much more delicious 
flavor than that obtained by pouring boiling water directly 
upon the raw cocoa in the cup. The eggs and cream 
give body and richness. It will serve from sixty to 
eighty people. 

Church Sociable Coffee. — If we follow the proportion 
of one rou7ided tablespoon or one-half 02ince of coffee, 
ground, for each half-pint cup water, we must allow one 
pound of coffee for eight quarts of water. This will 
make coffee of medium strength and will be sufficient for 
about thirty persons. 

Soak the coffee one hour in two quarts of cold water 
in a tightly covered jar and then turn it into a cloth bag. 
Have the requisite amount of water in a large boiler with 
a tight cover, and when just ready to boil, put in the bag 
of coffee and the water in which it soaked, and let it boil 
ten minutes. 



484 The Boston Cooh Book. 

Handy Coffee. — Put six rounded tahlespoonfuls of 
coffee in a hot coffee-pot or biggin, pour through it one 
quart boiling water. When all dripped through, pour the 
liquid through the grounds again, and after this second 
filtering let it come to the boiling point and then bottle 
tightly. When coffee is wanted, scald three-fourths cuj) of 
m^7^', heat two tablespoons of the bottled coffee and pour 
the two over the sugar in a hot cup. 

Quick Rolls. — Dissolve three yeast cakes in one cup of 
ivater, add one j^i^it of milk scalded and cooled, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, one tablespoonfal of butter^ and tico 
teaspoonfuls of sugar. Stir in flour enough to make 
a stiff dough, then knead it half an hour, being careful 
not to get it too stiff. Then without waiting for it to 
rise, divide it into equal portions for small rolls, and 
shape into balls and then into finger rolls, or press 
a small knife handle or roller through the middle, mak- 
ing cleft rolls, or it may be rolled with the hands into 
four long rolls. Put the rolls in a greased pan, cover 
with a cloth, let them rise about forty-five minutes. Then 
bake in a quick oven from twenty to forty minutes ac- 
cording to the size. Do not stop kneading until the time 
is up, or let the dough stand before shaping. If the 
dough is disturbed after it begins to rise, it will be diffi- 
cult to avoid having very large air holes. The idea is 
to make the dough light quickly ]:)y the large amount of 
yeast, rather than to exhaust tlie strength and elasticity 
of the flour by slow rising. Thus in less than two hours 
you will have bread or rolls that will surprise you by 
their lightness, fine texture, and rich nutty flavor. Not 
a trace of the yeast in the bread ; light, and 3^et unlike 
the extreme lightness of the usual yeast rolls, a rich 
crust that looks hard but proves to be soft and tender, 
and with none of the dry, chippy flavor common to bread 
raised over nislit.

Zwieback, No. 1. — Scald one cup milk, add half a tea- 
spoon salt, and when cool dissolve in it half a cake of 
compressed yeast. Stir iu flour to make a batter that 
just drops from the spoon. Let the bowl stand in a 
pan of warm (not hot) water, and when the sponge is 
full of bubbles add the following mixture : Tico rounded 
tablespoons butter creamed with quarter cup sugar, and 
two well beaten eggs. 

Add more flour, and when stiff knead it until smooth 
and light. Let it rise until double its bulk, then shape 
it into finger rolls and place them close together in a 
shallow pan. Let them rise again until very light ; then 
bake in a hot oven about half an hour. The next day, 
or when thoroughly cold, cut the loaf in half-inch slices 
and let them stand in a very slow oven until colored and 
dry all through. 

Zwieback, No. 2. — Scald oyie cup milk; when luke- 
warm, dissolve in it two yeast cakes, half a teaspoon 
salt, and four enough to make a soft dough. Let it 
rise until light, then stir in quarter cup incited butter, 
quarter cup sugar, and two eggs unbeaten. Mix thoroughly 
and add enough more flour to shape it into a loaf. Let 
it rise in the pan until very light; then bake in a quick 
oven, and when nearly done brush over with sugar dis- 
solved in milk. When cold cut in half-inch thick slices 
and let them color and dry in a moderate oven.

rolled out, one-third inch thick. Cut in rings and fry in 
clean hot fat. Test the fat by dropping in a piece of the 
dough, which should rise at once to the top with a good 
deal of ebullition and begin to brown at once. Turn only 
once. 

Buckwheat Cakes. — Mix over night, two cups buck- 
wheat, one cup Graham flour, and one level teasp)oon salt. 
Stir in ivarm ivater for thick batter, two tablespoons 
molasses, and one-half cake compressed yeast dissolved 
in water. In morning, stir the batter down ; if too thick, 
thin with warm water, or if any sour odor, add onefourth 
teaspoon soda dissolved in icater. Rise again and fry on 
greased griddle as wanted. 



Oyster Cocktails, 



487 



Hors-d'oeuvre. {M. L. Clarke.) — Remove the crust from 
a loaf of rye bread, cut into slices nearly two inches 
thick, remove crusts and hollow out thecentre sufficiently 
to enable a lemon to stand upright in it. Cut the ends 
of the bread block into thin slices, not quite to the 
bottom. Cut a lemon in halves and scoop out the pulp 
from the sections, being careful to leave the membranous 
wall of every other section so there will be five distinct 
places in the cup thus formed. In these cavities put 
minced olices, pickles, the bits of lemon, pounded sar- 
dines, caviare, finel}^ minced ham, tongue, anchovies, 
capers, or any other relish or combination you prefer. 
Have at least three varieties. Put the filled half lemon 
in the hollow of the bread. Put a dainty doily or paper 
on the plate, the bread on that, and an oyster fork across 
the plate. They may be placed beside the guest's plate 
and the various relishes nibbled as one fancies. The 
bread is broken from the cut end as needed. 

Oyster Cocktail. — Use very small oysters, and allow 
from four to eight for each glass. Keep them on ice 
until wanted, and have the glasses thoroughly chilled 
before filling. Use the common claret glass if you have 
not the regular cocktail glass. When ready to serve, 
put the oysters in the glass and add either of the follow- 
ing mixtures, using from one to two teaspoonfuls accord- 
iucr to taste.

Clam Cocktail. {Lia Rand.) — For every cocktail re- 
quired, take one teaspoonful of lemon juice, oneteaspoonful 
of vinegar, a quarter of a teaspoonful of walnut sauce, 
one-half teaspoonful of mushroom catsup, one-half tea- 
spoonful of grated horseradish, one-half teaspoonful of 
tomato catsup, a pinch of salt, a dash of tabasco sauce ; 
pour this mixture over eight little neck clams and serve 
in an ice cup, or in a glass wliich was set on ice for hours 
previous to serving. This cocktail finds great favor for 
luncheon, high teas, or suppers. 

Caviare. — This is the roe of the sturgeon preserved in 
salt alone or in salt, pepper, and onions and left to fer- 
ment. The best caviare comes from the north of Europe ; 
that made on the Volga, called caviare of Astrachan is 
preferred by some. It is regarded as a heavy food, diffi- 
cult of digestion. The flavor is exceedingly disagreeable 
to an unaccustomed palate, and this has led to the expres- 
sion, " Caviare to the general," for anything that cannot 
be appreciated or understood by the people. Caviare is 
highly esteemed by the Russians, and the most delicate 
species of the sturgeon are reserved for the royal family. 
It is classed among the hors-d'oeuvres, or savouries, and 
is usually served on or with fried toast or crofitons, or 
brown bread, after the soup or fish. It should not be 
long exposed to the air. If you buy it in the little barrels, 
divide it into small bottles and cork them tightly, then 
open only as wanted. If it should become too hard, 
break it up and work in a little olive oil and lemon juice. 
This is often the only preparation given it at gentlemen's 
suppers, where a skilful host, if he prefers, can prepare 
it for each guest. Sometimes it is served on a side dish 
with slices of lemon around it, and sometimes with finely 
chopped scallions or other raw onions. 



Cavaire, 489 



Caviare Canapes, No. 1. — Cut slices of bread quarter 
of an inch thick, then cut out with a two-inch cutter into 
rounds. Saute or fry in hot butter on each side without 
burning, and set away to cool. Cream quarter of a cup 
of fresh hatter^ add salt and paprika to taste, and mix 
with it as much finely minced water-cress as will give it 
a fine flavor. Chop the cress very fine, then squeeze dry 
in a napkin and chop again until very fine and dry. 
Make the butter into balls, and let it become hard. 
When ready to serve, spread the crofitons with the butter^ 
then spread a layer of caviare on top, and squeeze a little 
lemon juice over, and serve. 

Caviare, No. 2. — Cut slices of bread one inch thick, 
then with a pattie cutter stamp them out into rounds. 
With a smaller cutter stamp the centre two-thirds of the 
way down. Fry them in hot deep fat until a delicate 
brown color, drain, and with a sharp knife remove the 
centre crust. Then fill the centres with a mixture made 
in the following proportions. Two tablespoonfuls of 
caviare, one teaspoonful beef extract^ one teaspoonful 
lemon juice ^ a saltspooiful curry poivder, and also of 
paprika. Put all into a sauce pan and stir over the fire 
until quite hot, then put it into the crofitons. This may 
be served hot or cold, one to each person on a plate with 
a paper doily. 

Caviare, No. 3. — Prepare some crotltons from quarter- 
inch slices of breads about three and a half inches long 
and one and a half inches wide, frj% cool, and spread 
with the caviare. Pound together the yolks of tico hard 
boiled eggs, six boned anchovies, a teaspoonful of cho2)ped 
capers, a saltspoonful each of miLStard and paprika, and 
tv)o tahlespoonftds butter. Mix and pound until very 
fine, then press it through a puree strainer, and put it 
into a bag with a small frosting tube, and use as you 
would frosting. Use a paper cornucopia if you have no 
bag or tube. Chop some parsley or ivater-cress very fine 



490 The Boston Cook Book. 

and put it on the corners of the croilton. Cut some hard 
boiled eggs into halves, lengthwise, and place them in 
the centre of the croiltons, then with the tube fill the egg 
cavities with the puree. 

Or, the egg whites may be sifted, and then the crotrtons 
decorated according to your taste, with fancy lines of the 
puree, the white and the green salad. 

Cheese Canapes. — Allow the beaten ivhite of 07ie egg 
to each cuj) of finely crumbled or grated cheese, a sjjeck 
of salt and cayenne. Remove the crust from inch-thick 
slices of bread, hollow out centre making a box, fill with 
the cheese mixture heaped, bake about ten minutes, and 
serve on napkin. 

Thin Brown bread and Butter. — Trim off the crusts 
from a loaf of brown bread, leaving it in rectangular 
shape. Slice it very thin and spread with a thin coating 
of butter. Put two slices together and cut each square 
into triangles. Arrange them neatly on a plate and 
serve them with raw oysters. 

Halibut a La Conant. — In a baking pan put three 
thin slices of fat salt pork about iivo inches square, 
three slices of onio7i and a bit of baj/ leaf. On top of 
these lay a two-pound slice of halibut, spread over it one 
tablespoonful bidter and one tahlespoonfid flour creamed 
together. Cover with buttered cracker crumbs and small 
strips of scdt pork and bake twenty minutes. Take out 
the fish with a fish spade or two long knives, and lay it on 
a hot platter. Garnish with lemon and parsley. Cooked 
in this way the halibut is delicious, moist inside with a 
crisp brown crust, and so nicely flavored that no sauce 
is required. 

Broiled Shad. — Split the shad down the back, lay it 
open, clean, remove the back bone and as many of the 
fine bones as possible, and wape dry. Brush all over 
with oil or melted butter. Lay it on a greased broiler 



Fish. 491 

and cook over coals or under gas, flesh side first, until 
brown, then turn and cook the skin side until crisp. 
Meanwhile have prepared one large tahlespoonful butter 
creamed with one level teaspoonful salt, one saltspoonful 
jxpper or paprika, one tablespoon lemon juice or walnut 
catsup, and one taMespoon minced parsley, and when the 
fish is on the platter spread this over the surface and make 
several incisions that it may penetrate the fish. Garnis' 
with lemon points and pjarsle?/, and serve very hot. 

Planked Fish. — Shad or bluefish are nice cooked in 
this way ; indeed among camping parties along the shores 
of the Connecticut River planked shad is a favorite dish. 
Clean the fish, remove the head, and split entirely open. 
Nail it to a board, set in front of the fire and broil until 
the fisli is browned and cooked through. Remove it 
from the plank, and spread with butter, salt, and cayenne 
jjepper. If dishes are scarce, as they are very likely 
to be in camp, season the fish and serve upon the plank 
as a platter. 

Turbot. — Select a turbot weighing from four to six 
pounds, and with yellowish-white flesh. Wash and soak 
it half an hour in one quaint cold ivater with tivo table- 
spoons salt to remove the slime. Put again into fresh 
water, drain and wipe. Remove the skin, cut the fish 
away from the bone and divide through the centre 
lengthwise, making four fillets. Wipe, sprinkle with 
salt and p)^PP^'^'i brush over with oil or melted butter, 
and broil a delicate brown. Season with h^itter, salt, 
and pejyper, garnish with ivater-cress, and serve with 
cucumber sauce. 

Fried Pickerel or Pike. — This fish is especially nice 
for frying, as the flesh may be sliced into uniform pieces 
about one inch thick, giving round, shapely steaks. Of 
course, the fins, scales, and entrails are first removed, 
and the fish washed and wiped dry. Roll the slices 
lightly in flour or fine white cornmeal, and cook them 




49^ The Boston Cook Book. 

quickly in liot fat, half lard and half butter; or use salt 
fork fat. Do not let the fat burn. Turn the fish when 
brown, and when the other side is cooked, remove thein 
to a pan lined with soft paper, to absorb the grease, 
while 3'ou make a cream gravy. Scrape out any burned 
crumbs left in the pan, but if they are only browned they 
v>'ill do no harm. If pork has been u^ed, remove the 
scraps and fat. Turn in one-fourth cup of Jiot luater^ 
and scrape off any brown glaze from the pan, then add 
one cup of f/zzcA" creain^ and let it boil a few minutes. 
Rub one tahlespooi each of butter and flour together, 
stir it in, with chopped parsleij and salt and peppjer. 
Strain it on to a platter and lay the browned fish in the 
sauce. Serve the crisp pork as a relish for those who 
care for it. If the fish have been frozen, thaw them out 
in cold water. 

Swordfish. — This valuable sea food has many friends 
among those who have eaten it at its best, and especially 
after the excitement of chasing it through the briny 
waves. But tastes differ, and some people dislike it ex- 
ceedingly, and never include it in their summer menus. 
It has quite a strong, distinctive flavor, and in grain and 
texture is not unlike some meats. Some parts of the 
flesh are dark and oily, for it belongs to the red-blooded 
division of the finn}^ tribe, but the lighter-colored por- 
tions, when perfectly fresh, are very rich and delicious. 
It is usually sold in thin steaks or slices after the manner 
of halibut, which it somewhat resembles in size. Sword- 
fish steaks are cut about half an inch thick and are some- 
times broiled over the coals, but more often they are 
parboiled in a hot spider slightly greased. As they are 
rich in fat, they need but little, and will take on a rich 
brown color without the aid of flour or crumbs, and will 
cook through without becoming hard and dry. A little 
salt and pepper., with butter and lemon juice is all the 
dressing required, but fried or broiled tomatoes are an 
excellent accompaniment. 



Fish. 493 

Stuffed Smelts. — Chop six large oysters^ add one cup 
of soft bread crumbs^ one tabiesjwonful of melted butter^ 
and salt and pepper to taste. Clean the smelts, fill with 
the mixture, sew the edges, roll in melted butter, then 
in soft bread crumbs, and bake in a moderate oven ten 
minutes. Serve with Maitre d' Hotel butter. Cream two 
t(d)lespoonfuls butter^ add juice of half Si lemon ov lime, 
and a teaspoonftd of chopped parsley. 

Haddock Rarebit. — Have the haddock cut in slices or 
steaks about one inch thick and free from bone and skin. 
Lay them in a greased baking dish, and season with 
salt and pepper. Turn them over and spread on the 
top of each a cheese mixture prepared as for a rarebit. 
Have the cheese finely crumbled and seasoned with salt^ 
cayenne^ and a bit of mustard^ and if you like you may 
bind the mixture with beaten egg or cream. Put into 
a very hot oven and cook until the cheese melts and 
browns, and the fish is firm. Take up carefully on a 
serving dish and pour over one tablespoon of sherry to 
each slice. 



New 


1 cup raw salt fish. 


^ teasp. pepper. 


Fish 


1 pint potatoes. 


Salt if needed. 


Balls. 


1 teasp. butter. 


Whites of 2 eggs 



Wash the fish, pick in half-inch pieces, and free from 
bones. Pare the potatoes and cut in quarters, allowing 
a heaping pint measure to a level cup of fish. Put 
potatoes and fish in a stew pan and cover with boiling 
water. Boil twenty-five minutes, or till the potatoes are 
soft, but be careful not to let them boil long enough to 
become soggy. Drain off all the water ; mash and beat 
the fish and potatoes with a wire beater till very light ; 
add the butter and pepper, and when cooled add the 
stiffly beaten egg whites and more salt if needed. 

While the fish and potatoes are cooking, try out several 
slices of sweet fat salt pork, being very careful that it 
does not burn, and when crisp remove the slices and 



494 The Boston Coolc Booh. 

keep them warm. Drop a large tablespoonful of the mix- 
ture on a floured board aud shape it ioto a round cake 
about one and one-half inches thick, and floured on each 
side. When all are shaped, put them into the hot pork 
fat and brown them delicately on each side, but not on 
the edges. The white mixture should seem to be burst- 
ing out from the browned surfaces. Drain them on 
paper and serve them with hard-boiled eggs cut length- 
wise and laid on each cake. Boil the eggs eight minutes, 
or just enough to set the yolks. Garnish with the crisp 
pork and pickles cut in fancy shapes. 

Or you may omit the boiled egg garnish and make a 
sauce with the two yolks aud pour it into the centre of 
the dish and lay the cakes around it. Or put the cakes 
in the centre, the yellow sauce at one end, and some 
sliced green tomato pickle at the other. 

Hulled Corn Soup. — There is a distinctive flavor to 
bulled corn that is especially agreeable to mau}^, particu- 
larly to those who have been accustomed to this dish in 
childhood. But often the corn is not quite tender, or 
one wishes to serve it in a more modern way, and a soup 
or puree will be found to be both novel and delicious. 
If the corn is tender, mash it until fine and sift it 
through a puree strainer; otherwise chop the corn fine 
before sifting. Then gradually stir in hot milk enough 
to make it the consistency of any cream vegetable soup. 
Put it on to boil and add salt and loepper to taste, and 
a generous tablespoonful of butter^ for each quart of the 
mixture. Serve it with croutons. It will have a slightly 
granular texture, and if this is not liked, you may add 
the usual flour thickening. One tcihle spoonful of butter 
and one tablespoonful of flour cooked together, and 
stirred into the hot soup. If a corn puree is desired, 
simply mash and sift the corn, heat and season to taste 
with butter., salt., and pepper., and serve as a vegetable, 
or as a garnish for sausage or pork chops. 



Noodles, 495 



Noodles. — Beat two eggs slightly, add two tablespoon- 
fills of 7)iUk, and half a teaspoonful of salt. Stir in flour 
enough to make a very stiff dough. Knead it till stiff as 
possible. Roll it out into rectangular pieces and so thin 
you can see through it. Lay them on a napkin half an 
hour until they are dry, but not brittle. Rub over with 
a little flour so it will not stick. Roll up tight and hard, 
and then slice off from the end about one-eighth of an 
inch thick. Shake them out till long and straight. Put 
them into boiling salted water, stir them at first to pre- 
vent sticking, and cook until they swell and come to the 
top of the water. Skim them out into a dish for serv- 
ing. Melt half a cup of butter in a frying pan, put 
half a slice of bread, crumbled finely, in the butter, 
stir until golden brown, then spoon up butter and bread 
and pour over the noodles. Pass sapsago cheese with 
the noodles. 

If any be left over, warm it in butter until a delicate 
brown, and stir in three or four beaten eggs; serve as 
soon as firm. This makes a nice relish for supper. 

Lentil Soup. — Lentils are rich in proteid material, and 
therefore are very suitable when a meat soup is not 
desired. 

Pick over and wash one cnjy of lentils, and put them on 
to cook in one quart of boiling ivater. Let them cook 
very slowly until soft and the water reduced one-half. 
Rub the pulp through a strainer, add one pint of milk., 
and, when boiling, thicken with one rounded tablespoon 
four cooked in one rounded tablespoon hitter. Season 
\y\th. paprika., salt, and a dash of sugar, and serve with 
wafers or crofttons. 

Cream of Onions. — Onions are usually used merely to 
flavor soups, but they may serve as the foundation or 
body of a soup the same as any other vegetable pulp. 
They are especially valuable in the spring, and by many 
are considered as almost a specific for some physical ills. 




496 TTie Boston Cooh Booh. 

The large white Spanish and the Bermuda variety, 
having a mild flavor, are the best for soups. They 
should be peeled, sliced, and scalded for live minutes ; 
then drain quite dry; this will remove much of the 
pungent oil. Then, for a innt of sliced onion put one 
rounded tablespoonfid of butter in the stewpan, add the 
onions, and let them simmer very slowly for ten minutes. 
Put on boiling water to cover, and let them simmer until 
very soft — about an hour. 

Then rub them through a strainer, add one cup of hot 
milk, thickened with one level teaspoonful of fiour 
cooked in one rounded tablespoonful of butter. Season 
with one-fourth of a teaspoonful of white p)epper, one- 
half teaspoon salt. 

Beat yollzs of two eggs, add one cup hot cream ^ and 
put into the tureen. Turn the hot soup over the egg, 
stirring constantly, and serve at once. 



Cream of 1 can peas. 
Canned 1 pint hot water. 
Peas. 1 qt. milk. 

1 teasp. salt. 



1 saltsp. pepper, 
lo teasp. sugar. 
i tbsp. butter. 
I tbsp. flour. 



Turn the peas from the can into a colander and pour 
cold water over them to remove tlie taste of the tin. 
Drain and heat slightly in quarter of a cup of water. 
Rub them through a puree strainer, gradually adding the 
pint of hot water, which will help to separate the pulp 
from the skins. Put the pea pulp and milk on to boil ; 
add the seasoning ; then the butter and flour, which have 
first been cooked together. Stir as it thickens, and, as 
the pea pulp will vary in thickening quality, it may be 
necessary to add more milk or water if too thick, or to 
let it cook longer if too thin. Remember that all vege= 
table cream soups become thicker as they cool, and 
should be served very hot. 

Clam Bouillon. — Select clams in the shell, wash and 
scrub thoroughly and change the water until clean. Put 



Gomho Soup. 497 



them in a kettle with a pint of cold water for half a peck 
of clams. Cover tightly and let them cook until the 
shells open. Skim out the clams, pour off the liquor 
carefully into a pitcher, and let it stand until clear. 
Then pour off again from the sediment, and if too strong 
dilute it witii water as desired, and to each quart of 
liqui(], add the white and crumbled shell of one Qgg^ and 
a little pepper. 

Place over the fire and let it boil five minutes, con- 
stantly stirring until the egg has thickened. Draw it 
back, and when it is clear, strain it carefully. Serve hot 
or cold, in cups with whipped cream and wafers. 

Gombo Soup. — Cut up a chicken as for a fricassee, and 
dredge it thickly with flour. Fry a sliced onion in bacon 
fat, remove tlie onion and brown the chicken; brown also 
one quart of sliced okra pods. Place the chicken, onion, 
and okra in a kettle, cover with boiling water, add one 
quart of sliced tomatoes. Simmer until the chicken is 
tender. Remove the larger bones and all the fat. Add 
salt, cayenne, and a very little sugar. Serve it without 
straining and with boiled rice. 

Beef a La Russegue. — Select a piece of beef from the 
under part of the round, or the vein, weighing about 
three pounds. Put it on in boiling water to nearly cover, 
sUim as it boils, and let it cook slo-wly three or four hours 
or until tender. When nearly done, add salt and pepper 
to taste. Remove it from the water and set away to cool. 
In the water left in the kettle cook one dozen small 
onions. When nearly done, add the same amount of 
small potatoes pared into round shape, or cut with a 
large potato marl)le cutter. Remove these from the 
water when tender, and set away to cool. 

Half an hour before serving time, cut the meat into 
quarter-inch slices and brown it quickly and delicately in 
hot butter. Use two spiders, so it may be done quickly. 
Put the onions and potatoes in the spider, adding more 
butter as needed, and let them color slightly. Then heat 

32 



498 The Boston Cook Boole, 

the water in which the meat was boiled, which should be 
about a pint, add one cup of cream, and thicken it slightly 
with flour wet in cold water. Add more seasoning, if 
needed, and one cup of canned mushrooms, and simmer 
until the mushrooms are hot. Arrange the potato balls 
around the meat, then a row of the onions around the 
potatoes, and dot here and there with the mushrooms. 
Pour the gravy over the meat, enough to cover and show 
under the vegetable garnish. Put a sprig of parsley at 
the corners. 

This dish may seem to require considerable time in its 
preparation, but it is a very convenient dish for a six 
o'clock dinner, as the meat and vegetables may be boiled 
in the forenoon ; then it takes but little time to reheat 
them at night. Do not think it can be served as soon as 
the meat and vegetables are cooked and be the same, for 
the flavor of the meat when cooled and then reheated is 
quite unlike that of the freshly boiled meat. And we all 
know how the potato changes in texture and flavor when 
warmed over, and while it may not be as wholesome for 
a delicate stomach, it would not harm others. It is an 
economical and appetizing dish. 

Pepper Pot. — Cover two pounds of tripe and four calves' 
feet, or a knuckle of veal, with cold water and heat slowly, 
remove the scum, add one red pepper, and cook till the feet 
are tender, then remove the meat, let the liquor cool, skim 
off the fat, heat the liquor again and add seasoning to 
taste, salt, cayenne, and sweet herbs. Cut the tripe and 
the meat in small pieces, and slice about an equal amount 
of potatoes, add them and cook until the potatoes are 
done. When nearly done, add either egg balls or very 
small flour dumplings, and cook ten minutes. 

Salisbury Steak. — Select the middle cut from the top 
of the best round steak. Free it from fat, skin, and fibre. 
Run it three times through a meat chopper. Make into a 
mass about one and one-fourth inch thick, and shape the 



Braised Veal. 499 



edges even. Put it into a wire broiler and lay an iron 
band round it, which will help to keep the meat in shape. 
If the broiler shuts together too closely, bend it out iu the 
middle slightly. 

Put it over a Charcoal Broiler Stove and turn every ten 
seconds. Cook from four to six minutes. Lift the edge, 
and as soon as the meat is no longer raw, remove it to a 
not plate. Sprinkle with salt. In serving, cut into thin 
strips, and let each person spread it with butter as 
desired. 

In this way you have the full, sweet flavor of the butte 
without the injurious effect of melted butter. 

Veal Chops. — These are cut from the loin and ribs, and 
correspond to the sirloin and rib steaks in beef, and to 
the chops in mutton. They are generally more tender 
than the cutlets from the leg, just as sirloin steak is more 
tender than that from the round. 

Loin or kidney chops have quite a piece of fat with 
them which is very sweet and delicious, and sometimes 
the kidney is sold with the chop. 

Trim off the fat and cook it slowly until crisp. Slice 
the kidney, season with salt and pepper, and cook it iu 
the fat. 

Trim the chops and remove the bone, if preferred. 
Press into compact shape and season slightly. Roll in 
fine cracker crumbs, then dip in beaten egg, then in 
seasoned crumbs, and cook carefully in the hot fat, 
adding more butter or salt pork fat, if needed. Do not 
let them become too brown. Drain and serve, garnished 
witli the crisp fat and sliced kidney and a bit of parsh^y. 

Braised Veal. — Chop half a j^ound ot fat ■pork fine, and 
put half of it iu the bottom of a broad pot ; sprinkle with 
a tablespoon of chopped carrot, minced onion, a hay leaf, 
and a sprig of thyme. Lay a breast of veal on this bed, 
and cover with a similar layer. Pour in carefully a quart 
of stock, cover aud set on back of the range ; let simmer 




500 The Boston Cooh Booh. 

for two hours, remove the meat, nib over with butter, 
then dredge thickly with browned flour. Pour over the 
meat one cupful of the stock, then place in a hot oven 
and bake about half an hour, basting with the remaining 
gravy every few minutes. Serve the veal on a hot platter 
lined with buttered toast, and serve the gravy in a sauce 
boat. Plain boiled spaghetti, or home-made egg noodles 
should be served with it. 

Brown Fricassee of Sweetbreads. — Parboil ten min- 
utes. Remove fat and membranes, dredge with flour ^ 
and fry, till quite brown, in butter^ with a minced onion. 
Add to the butter, one cup of veal stock and two table- 
spoonfuls of Tnushroom ketchup., or hcdf a cup of tomatoes 
and one tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Season to taste 
with salt and peppe)\ cover, and stew slowl}^ for half an 
hour. Strain the gravy, and pour it over the sweetbreads. 

Shoulder of Mutton. — Remove the shoulder blade, 
back, and leg bones, any fine crumbs of bone or stringy 
membranes. Wipe with a wet cloth and rub slightly with 
salt. Roll or fold into shape and tie securely. Put it 
into boiling salted water to cover, remove the scum as 
soon as the water boils again, then turn the meat over 
and skim again. Let it cook gently. When it is nearly 
tender, remove it from the water, drain it, and place it in 
a baking pan. Dredge with salt, pepper, and flour, and 
set it in the oven. Bake until brown and crisp on the 
surface. Baste occasionally with some of the top of the 
water from the kettle, and dredge with flour after basting. 
The whole process will take from two and a half to three 
hours. 

When the meat is suflScieutly browned, remove it to a 
hot dish, put the pan on the stove, and let the water 
nearly boil out, leaving only fat in the pan. Stir into 
this fat about two tablespoonfuls of flour, and let them 
brown together. Scrape off all the glaze from the edges, 
and when well colored, add one pint of hot water from 
that used in boiling the lamb, or you may use half water

and half strained tomato. Stir well as it thickens, and 
season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve in a gravy 
boat. Remove tlie strings from tlie meat, and in serving 
cut at right angles with the back edge. 

After putting the lamb in the oven, put the bones and 
trimmings in the kettle with the water used in the boiling, 
add one onion^ and a few bits of carrot and turnip, if you 
liappen to have them, and let the whole simmer until the 
bones are clear of all gristle or meat. Then strain the 
liquor and set it away to cool, and the next day you may 
remove the fat, heat it again, and have a delicious lamb 
broth with boiled rice or curry. 

Breaded Chops. — Remove the bone and tough portion 
from six chops cut from the loin or ribs. Pat them into 
shape. Make a dressing of stale hr(iad crumbled, higlily 
seasoned with salt, pepper, cayenne^ and a little powdered 
thyme ^ moistened with melted hiitter and one well beaten 
egg and enough hot water to make it soft enough to 
spread easily. Lay the chops in a dripping pan with 
some of the surplus fat under them. Spread the dress- 
ing smoothly all over the top of each, place them in 
a hot oven, and bake about twenty minutes, or until 
brown. 

Pork Chops. — It will be impossible to cook some pork 
chops, and have them juicy and tender. There is no 
meat that varies so much in quality, or that is so decep- 
tive as fresh pork. The lean must be well marked with 
white lines of fat, or it will be dry and hard. It is often 
put into a very hot spider without any fat, and the sur- 
face quickly becomes very hard and brown. 

Put in a tablespoonful of lard, and when hot lay in the 
chops, and then keep them turning constantly ; reduce the 
heat as soon as they are browned on each side, and cook 
slowly until thoroughly done. Do not salt them until 
just before serving. They may be laid in a greased pan 
and baked quickly in a hot oven.

Bacon. — Do uot buy bacon by the pound, nor have it 
cut in thick slices, if cut at the market, but purchase it by 
the whole strip, freshly cured. It will keep well if the 
paper and burlap cover are replaced whenever opened, 
and is as much a necessity in the storeroom as is a supply 
of flour, sugar, or any other staple article of food. It has 
no equal as an appetizer for breakfast, or in helping out 
when there is but a limited supply of other meat. Served 
with omelets, or some other forms of eggs, crisp curly 
bacon is all the meat necessary for a summer breakfast. 
It is invaluable to boil with greens or other vegetables. 
The fat of bacon is one of the most easily digested forms 
of fat, as the curing and smoking seem to have given it 
some qualities which render it less objectionable than 
when fresh. Many physicians prescribe it in place of 
cod liver oil. 

Transparent Bacon. — Shave off the hard, lean strip 
from bacon, also the smoked edges and rind as far back 
on the strip as you require for one meal. Then with a 
very sharp knife shave off in slices not more than an 
eighth of an inch thick. Lay them in a hot frying pan, 
and turn as soon as transparent ; cook a moment on the 
other side, tip the spider and let the fat drain away from 
the bacon. Then serve alone or with eggs, beefsteak, 
veal cutlets, liver, or oysters. The slices may be laid in 
a fine wire broiler and cooked over a clear hot fire, or the 
broiler laid in a pan and the whole placed in a hot oven 
until transparent. 

Keep the bacon in a cold place, that it may be hard and 
firm before slicing, and if not ready to fry immediately, 
put the slices in the refrigerator until wanted. 

Crisp Bacon. — Prepare as directed for Transparent 
Bacon, then shave in the thinnest possible slices ; never 
mind if they are not entire slices so long as they are mere 
shavings. Take two or three tablespoonfuls of clear 
bacon fat from a previous frying, or use lard if you have 



Foivl, 50^ 

no bacon fat ; let it become quite hot in a small pan, then 
pnt the bacon in, stir it quickly with a fork for one 
minute, and skim it out as soon as it rattles. It should 
be only slightly colored, if dark brown, it has been over- 
cooked. Drain on paper. Should the bacon prove to be 
very salt, it may be soaked in milk over night after slicing, 
then drain, roll in very fine crumbs, or flour, and cook it 
quickly in hot fat. 

With a gas stove bacon is readily made crisp by broil- 
ing. Then no additional fat is required. 

Smothered Fowl. — Clean a fowl suitable only for boil- 
ing ; stuff and truss as for roasting. Pnt it in a large 
deep kettle or jar. Parboil some white beans, season 
the same as for baking, and put them in the kettle with 
the fowl, — under, around, and over the fowl. Add 
water and a small piece of pork. Cover, and bake 
slowly about eight hours. Add water as it boils away, 
and treat the same as for beans alone. Pour the beans 
out, remove the fowl carefnlly, put it on a large platter, 
and garnish with the beans. If more convenient, the 
fowl may be cut as for a fricassee. 

Hungarian Chicken or Paprika Huhn. — Put one heaped 
Uiblespoonful butter or dripping in a tight stew pan, add 
two good-sized onions sliced thin and left in long strips. 
When slightly colored, add half teasjyoonful of Hunga- 
rlan pi'pper OY paprika^ and mix well and let them brown. 
Then add the chicken cut in pieces, and salted and pep- 
pered. Brown w^ell, turning often. Then add stock or 
water till nearly covered. Stew until tender. Just be- 
fore serving, take out the meat, put on a hot platter, and 
add a full half cup or more of thick sour cream. Just 
let it scald, but do not boil it, pour it over the chicken 
and serve at once. 

Croustades of Chicken. — Cover the outside of small 
moulds or tin corn-cake cups with thin puff paste. Prick 



504 The Boston Cooh Booh, 

and bake, remove from the moulds and fill with mixture 
of mushrooms and chicken breasts chopped fine and 
moistened with highly-seasoned cream sauce. 

Roast Mallard or Teal Ducks. — Singe, draw, and re- 
move all the tiny pinfeathers. Then wash very quickly, 
both inside and out, with cool water and wipe perfectly 
dry. For the stuffiug, take equal parts of chopped tart 
apijles^ of bread crumbs which have been browned in the 
oven and sifted, and of boiled onions. Season highly 
with salt 2i\id. yepper^ and a little sage^ and moisten with 
two or three tablespoonfids of melted butter. Stuff the 
ducks, sew and truss. Put on a rack in a pan, sprinkle 
with salt, pepper, and a little flour. Cover with small 
slices of salt pork and put into a very hot oven. lu 
about five minutes the ducks will be light brown. Now 
reduce the heat and pour into the pan a very little water. 
The dripping fat will burn unless a little hot water is 
added. Baste every four or five minutes. In fort}" 
minutes the ducks will be sufficiently cooked, if liked a 
trifle rare, but many prefer a longer cooking. When 
nearly done, the pork must be removed and the birds 
evenly browned on all sides. Serve with 

Olive Sauce. — Skim off some of the fat in the dripping 
pan until only four tablespoonfuls remain. To this add 
four tablespoonfuls of broivned flour ^ stir, then add slowly 
one and a Jialf cups of boiling ivater. Let it boil until 
slightly thickened, stirring constantly, then add four 
tablespoonfuls of olive pulp cut in small pieces, one tea- 
spoonful of lemon juice and one teaspoonful of caramel. 

Roast Duck, No. 2. — Prepare as directed in first recipe, 
and stuff with stale bread crumbs, seasoned with a little 
melted butter, salt, pepper, and threefourths of a cuj) of 
chopped celenj. Place the duck on the bottom of the 
pan and not on the rack, and put close around it a sweet 
potato^ a carrot, and a jjursnip, each of them pared and 



Rahhit Fricassee, 505 



cut in halves. When the duck is basted, baste the vege- 
tables also, and when the duck has been taken from the 
pan, mash the vegetables in the drippings and press 
through the sieve. Add about one and a half cujys of 
hoUlng water, season and serve in a gravy boat. The 
vegetables take the place of flour in thickening, help to 
flavor, and we think this is a very good everyday gravy 
for ducks. (Miss Souther.) 

A Missouri Dainty. — Cut a carefully dressed young 
squirrel or rabbit into pieces for frying ; rub each piece 
with salt, pe2)2)er, and dust with a trifle of mace; dredge 
well with flour, and fry to a rich brown in half butter and 
half lard. Remove the meat from the pan, add a heaping 
tablespoonfiil of flour, and when it is brown, enough 
seasoned soup stock to make a gravy as thick as cream. 
Next place the meat in a porcelain-lined pot, or earthen- 
ware " cooking-crock," pour over it the gravy, and a 
generous cupful of tomatoes, which have been well stewed 
down and seasoned with salt, pepper, and a grated onion ; 
place a tight-fitting lid on the vessel, stand it on a muffin 
ring in a moderate oven, and let it cook for three hours. 

Rabbit Fricassee with Curry. — Select a fat, young, 
wild rabbit, which, if fresh, will have no unpleasant odor. 
Skin and clean it, and remove the head and neck, which 
are not to be used. Split it down the back, then disjoint 
it, or cut into convenient pieces. Wipe off with a clean 
wet cloth, and if you prefer you may soak it half an hour 
in salted water. Season with salt and pepper, dredge 
W\\X\ flour, and brown slightly in hot butter oy salt pork 
fat. Put the meat into a stewpan. In the fat left in 
the saucepan, put one sliced onion and cook until slightly 
colored. IMix two tcaspoonfuls of curry powder^ one 
'■.easpoonful of sugar, and one heaping tahlespoonful of 
flour, and brown them in the butter. Add slowly one 
pint of water, one cup of strained tomato, six raisins 
seeded, om cup of chopped sour apple, a dash of cai/' 




5o6 The Boston Cook Book. 

enne^ and salt to taste. Turn this sauce over the rabbit, 
and let it simmer until the flesh is very tender. When 
ready to serve, add one cup of hot milk and quarter of a 
cup of chopped olives. Have ready one cup of rice^ 
cooked in boiling water until soft, turn the rabbit into a 
platter and pile the rice around the edge. 

Brown Fricassee of Partridge. — Dress and clean a pair 
of partridges, split them through the back and breast as 
for broiling. Fry two slices of salt pork in a Scotch 
bowl or other deep iron kettle. Remove the scraps, lay 
the partridges in, and brown them carefully. Then 
add one cup of boiling water; cover the kettle closely 
and let it cook very slowly. Keep that amount of water 
in the kettle, adding a little as it boils away. Cook until 
very tender, about two hours. Then take out the meat, 
remove the fat from the gravy and pour in half a ciip 
of tomato ketchup ; thicken it with a little flour mixed 
with cold water. Add more salt if needed, put the meat 
in again, and when heated through, serve on a shallow 
dish with browned siceet potatoes, {Mrs. Webster.) 

Baked Quail. — Pick, draw, and wipe the birds outside 
and inside with a wet cloth. Be careful to remove any 
shot in the flesh. Cut the wings and neck off close to 
the body, but leave the feet on. Take two oysters to 
each bird., dip them in melted butter, then in cracker 
crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper. Put them into 
the body, tie the feet and fasten them through the tail 
with a small wooden skewer so they will cover the open- 
ing. Rub the breasts with softened butter and dredge with 
-flour. Pin a thin piece of fat salt pork on the breast, 
arrange them in a baking pan so they will keep breast 
up. Place them in a hot oven and bake twelve minutes. 
Baste with melted butter and water three times during the 
baking. They have a dry white meat, and should be well 
done and be basted frequently to make them delicious. 

Have ready a small slice of nicely toasted bread, no 



Chafing-dish. 507 



crusts, and moisten it slightly with hot salt water. Dish 
the birds on the toast wathout spilling an}^ of the juice 
from the inside, as this is needed on the toast. Remove 
the skewers and pork, and garnish with cauliflower. 

Broiled Squabs. — Kemove the feathers, split down the 
back, remove the entrails, and wipe clean. Rub all over 
with soft butter^ and dredge with salt and j)^PP^^^' Lay 
them in a piece of buttered letter-paper, inside down, cross 
the legs over the outside, and fold the edges under to shape 
it well. Fold the paper over and fold the edges together. 
Broil over a clear fire about eight minutes. Spread ciir- 
rant-jelbj on some hot buttered toast; lay a bird on each 
slice, with a little jelly on the breast. Pour over them 
the juice from the papers, and serve very hot. 

ON THE CHAFING-DISH. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Spread /oz^r slices of hot toast with 
a thin layer of j^otted ham. Beat/oz^?* eggs slightly with 
a fork, season with salt and pepper^ add half ^ cupful of 
mill<:. Turn into a hot buttered chafing-pan, and stir 
with a fork until the egg is slightly thickened. Turn at 
once on the toast, and serve quickly. 

Tomato Omelet. — Fry three slices of bacon crisp, re- 
move it, and in the same fat cook one sliced onion until 
light brown. Beat three eggs slightly, season with cay- 
enne^ add three tablespoonfds of thick stewed tomato^ 
the fried onions and the crisp bacon, finely crumbled. 
Turn into a greased chafing-pan, and pick it up with a 
fork as the egg thickens, then let it color slightly, roll 
over and turn out onto a hot platter. 

Scotch "Woodcock. — First toast and butter some bread 
on both sides, and spread on tiiis some chopped anchovies. 
Beat the yolks of foicr eggs with half a print of cream^ and 
thicken this for a few^ moments in the chafing-dish without 
letting it come to a boil. Arrange the small pieces of 
toast into a little pyramid and pour the egg over it.

it while you put the blazer over the flame. Add to the 
lobster, four tablespoons of sherry^ one tablespoon of 
brandy^ and a salispoon of red ptepper, and let them cook 
five minutes. Place the pan of boiling water underneath, 
and then stir the cream and egg mixture in, and stir 
thoroughly. Remove as soon as the egg has thickened, 
that it may not curdle. 

Lobster Newberg, No. 2. — Prepare one pint lobster dice.

Beans, 1 hpd. tbsp. butter. 

German 1 saltsp. pepper. 
Style. 



saltsp. nutmeg, 
tsp. salt. 



Break off the ends and strings, and if the latter do not 
come off readily, take a thin sharp paring knife and pare off 
the thickest string on the inside edge of the pod, taking as 
thin a strip as possible. Hold the bean with this edge 
toward you, and cut in thin slanting pieces not more than 
an inch and a half long, holding the back edge of the 
pod against the left forefinger. I give this minute 
direction because many of my pupils have found it dif- 
ficult to get the knack of cutting them "on the bias," as 
we call it, and it does make a difference in the flavor if 
they are broken or snapped in the old way. It takes 
time to do this, but after you learn the art, it can be 
done as quickly as one shells peas. Beans prepared in 
this way require much less time for cooking, and house- 
keepers who often give up having a dinner of string beans 
because they could not get them on at nine o'clock, or do 
not want a hot fire all the morning, will do well to try 
this recipe. Do not be afraid to use the nutmeg. You 
will not recognize it, yet you will miss something if you 
omit it. 

If the beans are not fresh from tlie vines, it maj' be 
well to put them in cold water before cutting, to make 
them more crisp and firm. After slicing, put them again 
into cold water, but do not prepare them more than half 
an hour before needed. Put the butter, salt, pepper, and 
nutmeg into a broad granite stewpan having a tight cover, 



Puree of Green Beans. 513 

und when the butter is melted, take the beans from the 
water in handfuls, with only the w^ater that clings to 
them, and put them into the butter. 

Add no more water. Cover tightly, and as soon as 
they are hot set them where they will cook very slowly. 
The butter and liquid that is drawn from the beans will 
make sufficient moisture to steam the beans, and they will 
be perfectly tender if cooked slowly and of finer flavor than 
when deluged with water. Stir them up from the bottom 
occasionally, and so long as there is barely liquid enough 
to cover the bottom of the pan they are safe. If they 
cook too rapidly, and become quite dry, you may add two 
or three tablespoonfuls of water. They should be quite 
ilry except for the coating of butter, when done, and 
being already seasoned they are simply turned into the 
iish and sent at once to the table. 

Small fresh-picked beans will cook in from thirty to 
forty minutes, larger or stale ones sometimes require 
nearly an hour. It will do no harm to let them stan(i 
some time in the kettle on the back of the stove or be- 
yond the chance of burning, if they are tender before you 
are ready for them. 

Puree of Green Beans. — One of the most wholesome, 
delicious, and convenient ways of using Lima or other 
shelled beans while in the green state is in a puree. 
Cook the beans in boiling water for ten minutes, then 
drain, rinse, and put again into boiling water, plenty of it, 
and cook until very tender. Turn into a puree strainer 
and press all the pulp through. Put on to boil again, and 
add milk or cream sufficient to make it the usual puree 
consistency. For each quart of the mixture, cook one 
tablespoonful each of butter and flour together as for 
white sauce, and stir it into the boiling liquid. Season 
with salt and pepper. Serve with wafers. 

It is convenient to cook a quantity of the beans at once 
and sift them, then add milk and thickening only to what- 
ever portion may be needed for that meal.

Cucumber Sauce. — Pare two cucumbers. Cut length- 
wise in quarters, remove the seeds if large, chop fine and 
squeeze dry. Season with salt, paprika, and vinegar, and 
stir in one-half cup of thick cream whipped stiff. This is 
especially suitable for broiled fish. 

Stewed Cucumbers. — Pare the large cucumbers, cut 
lengthwise into four parts, and remove the large seeds. 
Soak them half an hour in cold water. Cook in boiling 
salted water to cover until tender. Drain off the water ; 
add a little butter, salt, and pepper, and, when well 
heated, serve on toast ; or make a thin white sauce and 
pour over them. This is worth trying. 

Heidelberg Carrots. — Wash and scrape three medium- 
sized carrots, cut into pieces about an inch and a half 
long, then into thin slices lengthwise, and then again into 
thin strips about like short matches. Put them into cold 
water for a few moments, and then cook in boiling salted 
water, barely enough to keep from burning. They will 
cook tender in from twenty to thirty minutes. For about 
one pint of the carrot allow one heaping teaspoon each of 
butter and flour, creamed together; stir it into the boiling 
liquid. There should be but a few spoonfuls, but by 
tipping the pan toward you they can be blended easily. 
Add half a teaspoonful of salt and a little pepper, let it 
boil about five minutes, then sprinkle over a little fine 
parsley ; turn into the dish and sprinkle again with pars- 
ley, using about one teaspoonful in all. 

Sweet Carrots. — The carrots are best cut in quarter 
inch dice. Boil them in salt water uncovered. When 
they are almost tender, pour off all but perhaps a quarter 
of a cup of the water, put them back on the stove, 
sprinkle with two or three tahlespoonfals of sugar and 
allow them to cook until the water has boiled away, shak- 
ing the pot occasionally and shifting the carrots from top 
to bottom with a fork that they may all come in contact 
with the sweetened water. They should be decidedly 



Italian Chestnuts. 515 

sweet. When the liquid is absorbed, melt a tablespoon- 
fid of butter ia the carrots, and pour over a teaspoonful 
of lemon juice, and they are ready. 

German Cabbage. — Cut a two inch cube of fat salt pork 
in dice and fry it slightly in the bottom of the stewpan, 
add (me cup of boiling water ^ and two quarts of shredded 
cabbage, and one sour apple cut line. Cook one hour very 
slowly. When it is half done, add half a cup of vinegar. 

Summer Squash. — Use only very j^oung, tender 
squashes. Wash and cut off the stem, lay them in a 
kettle with barely water enough to keep them from 
burning on, and cook until tender. Drain and let the 
water boil down to a thick syrup, add butter, salt^ and 
pepper. Cut the squash in portions for serving, and 
pour the seasoned sauce over it. In this way the deli- 
cate flavor of the squash is retained. 

Summer Squash, No. 2. — Steam the squash until tender. 
Then put into a cheese-cloth strainer and squeeze out 
some of the water. Mash and break up fine, and season 
with salt, pepper, and butter. 

Fried Squash. — Cut young tender squash in half-inch 
slices, dip in flour seasoned with salt and pepper. Cook 
slowly in hot butter or salt pork fat, until browned. 

Italian Chestnuts. (Lia Rand.) — Two pounds of lars^e 
chestnuts, the shells taken clean off with a very sharp 
knife. Pour boiling water over them and the under skin 
will come off readily. Peel and cut up four red onions, 
stew them in butter until soft, but not brown. Add the 
peeled chestnuts, and pour over them enough soup stock 
to keep them moist without burning. Salt them but not 
too much. When the chestnuts are nearly done, add to 
them four large apples peeled, cored, and sliced. Add 
them to the chestnuts, and let them simmer until done. 
Then add sugar to taste. 

This dish has a very rich flavor, and may be well worth 
trying by those who w^ant a new combination. 



5i6 The Boston Cooh Booh. 

Many poor families in Italy derive their principal sus- 
tenance from the fruit of the chestnut-trees. The nuts 
are peeled, dried in the sun, ground into flour, and made 
into bread. The chestnuts are used also in soups, sauces, 
pure'es, forcemeats, entrees, and sweet dishes for dessert. 

Barley a la Strassburg. — Pour boiling water over halj 
a cup of pearl barley ; remove any specks or insects, and 
drain dry. Melt one tablespoon butter in a stewpan ; add 
the barley, and let it cook until slightly browned and it 
has absorbed the butter. Then add one quart of thin 
stock and let it boil until tender and dry. Season with 
salt and serve as a vegetable. 

Lentil Hash. {Dr. Alice B. Stockton.) — Take one pint 
cooked lentils, one-half pint of cold potatoes chopped fine, 
tico tablespoonfuls chopped onions, one tablespoonful salt, 
one-half tea spoonful peppjer, two tablespoonfuls butter, one- 
half cup rnilk, cook slowly for an hour, then brown and turn. 

The lentils used for the above should already have been 
cooked at least eight hours in a double boiler at a tem- 
perature of about 200°. When thus cooked they can be 
used for hash, croquettes, soup, and many other purposes. 

B, B. B. Cakes. — A cupful more or less of cold baked 
beans may be left after the family are tired of seeing this 
dish for Saturday's supper, Sunday's breakfast, and wash-, 
ing day lunch, and yet it seems vrasteful to throw them 
away. Sift them, and if very dry add a little hot water 
to moisten enough to shape them into small flat cakes. 
First season them with salt, if needed, and mustard. Cook 
one tablespoonful of chopped onion in a little p)ork fat or 
butter, and when slightly colored put in the cakes and 
brown on each side. Serve with toasted brown bread. 

Baked Corn and Beans. — Take equal quantities of shelled 
beans and sweet corn cut from the cob, — put them into 
a bean-pot in layers, sprinkling salt and pepper between 
each layer. For one innt each of corn and beans take 
one-half pound salt pork, score the rind and place in the 



Mushrooms. 517 



top of the bean-pot, letting the rind come up even with 
the corn and beans. Coyer with boiling water and bake 
slowly seven or eight hours, adding more water as it 
cooks away. 

A Rice Course for a Green-and-White Luncheon. — 

Put one cup of rice and one cup and a half o^ boiling water 
in a small tightly covered stewpan over the fire, and let it 
boil rapidly without raising the cover until the steam from 
the rice lifts the cover. When done, the rice will be full 
of steam holes. Season with salt^ pepper, and butter. 
Drain the liquor from a can of peas., rinse them in cold 
water ; put on to heat, with one tablespoon of butter; 
salt, pepper, and sugar to taste. 

Arrange a portion of rice on a lettuce leaf, making a 
slight depression in the centre, into which pile a portion 
of the peas. Sprinkle a little grated cheese over the whole. 

Mushrooms. Campestris. — Clean, peel the caps, and 
broil from six to ten minutes. Cook the gill side first. 
When done, spread at once with butter, creamed and 
flavored with lemon and parsley. 

Baked Mushrooms. — Place the caps on toast, spread 
with prepared maitre d'hotel butter, and bake in a cov- 
ered dish from twelve to fifteen minutes. 

Fried Green Tomatoes. — Cut off both ends from nice, 
large, green tomatoes, cut in thin slices ; roll them in 
flour, and cook them in hot butter in the frying-pan. 
Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and sugar, and cook until 
brown. Fry a sliced onion with them if you like the 
flavor. Serve them with fish-balls. 

Potatoes au Gratin. — One cup white sauce, one pint 
cold boiled poto^o dice, one-half cup cracker crumbs moist- 
ened with one tablespoon melted butter, and one-half cup) 
cheese. Put potatoes, cheese, and sauce, two layers of 
each, in buttered baking dish, cover with crumbs and 
bake fifteen minutes. 



5i8 The Boston Cook Booh. 

Potatoes Warmed in Stock. — Cut into half-inch dice, 
or into thin slices, enough cold boiled potatoes to make 
one pint. Season well with salt^ pepper., fine-chopped 2>a?*s- 
ley^ and one teaspoon of lemon juice. Cook one sliced 
onion in one tablespoon beef dripping until you have a 
strong odor of the onion, but do not burn them. Add 
the potatoes, and cook a few minutes, or until slightly 
browned ; toss them up and brown again, then add one 
cup of corned beef liquor, and let them simmer until the 
liquor is nearly absorbed. One-fourth p)art of cold beet 
and vinegar may take the place of the parsley and lemon, 
to make another variety. 

Radishes. — The small, smooth, round, or slightly oval 
red radishes are generally preferred, although occasionally 
we find the long pointed varieties both red and white. The 
red skin is sometimes nearly removed by scraping, as it is 
objectionable to some tastes, but it adds so much to the 
attractive appearance of the table that it seems a pity to 
lose it. Trim off the fine roots and cut the leaves about 
an inch from the root. The delicate green will contrast 
prettily with the red, and the stems make a convenient 
handle. Put them in a pan of ice water till firm and 
crisp. With a small sharp knife begin at the point, and 
make several slight incisions through the skin merely, 
down about half-way and one-third inch or more apart. 
Slip the point of the knife under the skin at each point 
and separate it from the flesh. Press the points outward 
slightly, then let them remain in ice water, and when 
ready to serve you will find them open at the cut end like 
a flower. When the radishes are large, the point of each 
petal may be rounded off slightly to imitate a tulip. Use 
them as a garnish for meat or salads, or arrange them in 
a small glass dish, as a part of the table decoration, or 
serve two with two or three olives on fancy individual 
dishes at each plate. Salt is the only condiment needed. 

Spring Salad. — In a salad bowl put first a layer of 
fresh crisp watercress, then a layer of thinly sliced cu- 



Salads. 5 1 9 



cumbers which have been soaked in cold water fifteen 
minutes, then a teaspoonful of minced chives, then an- 
other layer of cucumbers, and around the edge a light 
border of the cresses. When ready to serve, pour a 
French dressing over it and toss it over until well 
mingled. This is appropriate to serve with a course of 
broiled fish. 



Lincoln 1 quart oysters. 
Salad. 3 cucumbers. 
1 tsp. salt. 



1 saltsp. black pepper. 
1 buucli watcrcresses. 
cream dressing to moisten. 



Pick over the oysters and parboil until the edges curl, 
drain very dry, cool and cut into small uniform pieces. 
Pare the cucumbers and leave in cold water until needed. 
Then cut into quarters lengthwise (sixths, if very large), 
trim off the edge containing the seeds, then dry on a 
towel and cut into thin slices. Season them highly with 
salt and black pepper, and add them to the oysters. 
Moisten with cream dressing, turn into a salad bowl 
[ined with cresses, put some of the best sprigs on the 
edge, and cover with the remainder of the dressing. 

German Cucumber Salad. — The slightly acid juice of 
the cucumber is disagreeable to many delicate stomachs, 
and this is drawn out largely by this method of preparing 
them. We have been taught that cucumbers should be 
crisp and firm, and that if wilted or soft they were not 
suitable to serve. But I have eaten them frequently dur- 
ing the last season, prepared as below, and found them 
delicious and less likely to remind me of their presence in 
my internal economy than when served in our way. 

This method also enables one to use cucumbers that are 
older than we generally like to have them, as the seeds 
which are the objectionable part when the fruit is too 
ripe, are not served. 

Pare the cucumbers, and then cut them in half-inch 
slices. Then pare each slice as thinly as possible from 
the outside to the seed part, making a long, thin, curling 
strip. Cover them with cold water and add one round 




520 TliQ Boston Cook Book. 

teaspoon of salt for each cucumber. Let them soak until 
soft, from one to two hours. Then drain off the water 
and squeeze them in a soft cloth until quite (\vy. Toss 
them up in a salad bowl and dress with cayenne, oil, and 
vinegar, and serve very cold. 

Apple and Celery Salad. — Have the celery nicely cleaned 
and crisped by keeping it in a damp napkin on the ice 
until just before ready to use. Then cut it into thin 
crescent-shaped slices. With a silver knife pare and 
core some mildly tart apples, cut into eighths or narrower, 
if very large apples are used, and tlien cut across the 
sections into thin slices. Use equal parts of celery and 
apple. Mix in sufficient mayonnaise dressing to hold the 
pieces together. Arrange crisp cup-shaped lettuce leaves 
on a pretty shallow dish, put a portion of the mixture on 
each leaf, dot the top with a teaspoon of the mayonnaise, 
and serve quickly. Do not pare the apple until ready to 
put the mixture together. A simple French dressing may 
be used if preferred, and by many would be thought more 
suitable for a dinner salad. 

No. 2. — Whip one cup of thick well-chilled cream^ with 
an egg-beater or fork until thick, then add gradually suf- 
ficient lemon juice to thin it slightly, and season with JudJ 
a teaspoon ful of celery salt and a sjjoonful of paprika. 
Use a thin-skinned tart apple. W^ipe, quarter, and core 
without paring, divide again lengthwise into two or three 
pieces, then slice very thin. For two cups of the o2iple 
use one cup of fine cut celery. Moisten with the cream 
dressing. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Arrange 
in a shallow glass dish and garnish with green celery tips 
and crescents of the red apples. 

Chestnut, Apple, and Celery Salad. — Prepare the apple 
and celery as directed in the first recipe. Shell, parboil, 
and skin the large French chestnuts. Roil twelve min- 
utes, or until soft, but not broken. Drain, and when cool 



fSalads. 521 



cut them into thin slices. Use one cup of each measured 
after slicing. Season highly with a French dressing, and 
keep in a cold place. Serve in a salad bowl surrounded 
with crisp lettuce. 

Apple and Onion Salad. — Boil one cup of vinegar. If 
strong, use half water. Mix one teaspoonful mustard^ one 
teaspoonful cornstarch^ one-half teaspoonful salt, and one- 
half saltspoon fid pepper with one well-beaten egg. Stir this 
into the boiling vinegar and cook until creamy. Pour it 
over two mildly acid apples and one ojiion chopped fine. 
Serve it with lettuce cups. 

Nut Salad. — Equal parts of apple, celery, and nuts. 
Cut the apple in eighths, pare and cut from the end in 
thin slices. Split the celery stalks if they are wide, and 
then lay several together and shave off in thin crescents. 

Use almonds, peanuts, pecans, or walnuts. Salted al- 
monds and peanuts may be chopped medium fine, pecans 
and walnuts crumbled, or chopped. Some prefer to par- 
boil the walnuts and remove the skin ; the slight cooking 
softens them somewhat. It is not necessary to have 
equal parts of each, for with almost any proportion that 
I have chanced to have, if the seasoning has been right, 
the salad has been good. 

Mix with a mayonnaise dressing and serve with or 
without crisp lettuce. Salt and pepper the mixture well 
before adding the ma^^onnaise. 

Fruit Salad. — Remove the sections of pineapple with a 
silver fork. Stone the cherries, being careful to save the 
juice. Hull the berries, mix all together, place on lettuce 
leaves and garnish with stars of mayonnaise dressing. 

Another way : Make a bed of lettuce leaves on a 
glass dish, keeping the fruit separated one from the 
other; make three mounds, and garnish in the same way. 
Select the dark, almost black cherries, as it gives you 
three distinct colors. Use equal parts of pineapple, cher- 
ries, and strawberries. 



522 The Boston Cooh Book. 

Fruit Cups. — Cut oranges in halves and with a spoon 
scoop out the pulp and juice, then scrape out the white 
membrane and set the cups in a pan of ice. Cut Malaga 
grapes in halves and remove the seeds. If the skins are 
tough, peel them before cutting. Have equal parts of 
grapes and banana, cut in small pieces. Add the juice 
of one lemon to the juice of three oranges, and sweeten 
it quite sweet. Add also a dash of salt. Fill the orange 
cups with the mixture of fruits, pour the sweetened juice 
over the fruit, and put a spoonful of thick whipped cream 
on top. Serve very cold. 

Tomato Jelly Salad. — Soak one-half box of gelatine in 
07ie-half Clip of cold zvater fifteen minutes, or till soft. 
Stew one can of tomatoes till soft, cutting and mashing 
the pulp to hasten the process. For additional flavoring, 
stew with the tomato a half inch bit of bay leaf one-half 
teaspoon of mixed whole spices, one rounded tablespoon 
of celery salt, and one-half a small Bermuda onion. Strain 
the tomato through a puree sieve, and if there is not 
enough to make three cups add boiling water. Heat 
again to boiling point, add the soaked gelatine, stir till 
dissolved, then pour it into small cups or fancy moulds, 
or into a ring mould, if individual forms are not desired. 
Chill, and when ready to serve, turn out and serve the 
small forms on lettuce leaves with mayonnaise on the 
top. Or turn the ring mould out on a salad dish, fill 
the centre with any salad mixture you prefer, and garnish 
with any appropriate border of green. 

Salad in Tomato Jelly Cups. — Soak one-hcdf box of 
gelatine in one cup of cold icater in wliich some celery has 
been stewed. Put into a stewpan one quart can of toma- 
toes, one tablespoon of minced parsley, one tablespoon 
of chives, one teaspoon of salt, one-fourth teaspoon of 
paprika, two tablespoons of lemon juice, and two carda- 
mom, seeds. Stew until the pulp is tender, then strain it, 
without pressure, heat again to a boiling point, add the 
soaked gelatine and strain it again into a pitcher. Have 



Salads. 523 



ready two sizes of small round moulds or cups. Put the 
larger moulds iu a pan and surround them with broken 
ice. Pour in jelly to the depth of one-third inch. When 
firm, place the smaller mould inside and add a few spoon- 
fuls of jell}^ between the moulds. When this is firm, add 
the remainder till the larger moulds are filled. Fill the 
smaller mould with broken ice to hasten the process. 
When the jelly is firm, remove the ice, add hot water to 
the smaller mould till it can be lifted out carefully. Fill 
the space w^ith oyster salad, or any preferred salad, and 
when ready to serve, invert on a dish, and garnish with 
w^hipped cream dressing and watercress. 

Salad of Remnants. — Mix one cup of cold boiled celery 
cut in bits, one cup of cooked caulijlower, and one-half cup 
of canned butter beans. If you have no mayonnaise 
dressing left over, or do not like the oil in the plain 
French dressing, make a cream dressing as follows: Mix 
one-fourth teaspoon of mustard,, one-fourth teaspoon of 
salt^ one-half teaspoon of sugar,, and a few grains of pap- 
rika. Add the yolk of 07ie egg and mix well, then the 
white beaten till foamy (not stiff), and one tablespoon of 
thick cream. Gradually add one-fourth cup of hot vine- 
gar,, and cook over boiling water till it thickens, stirring 
constantly. AYhen cold pour it over the mixed vege- 
tables. Or the vegetables may be arranged in groups, 
each kind by itself, and the dressing served separately. 

Asparagus. — Break off the stalks where they are tender, 
w^ash, tie in a bundle, cook in boiling water till tender. 
Drain, cut into inch pieces, and pour white sauce over it, 
using only enough to moisten. 

Asparagus Salad. — Use only about three inches of the 
tip end, and cook as directed above, and chill it thor- 
oughly. Serve it on a platter, and pass with it a French 
dressing, served in small dishes, into which each stalk 
may be dipped as desired. 



524 Th^ Boston Cook Booh. 

Potato Salad. — Boil potatoes without paring, and re- 
move when not quite soft. Peel, and when cool slice 
thin, and season with salt and pepper. To one quart, 
allow one small onion sliced, and double the rule for 
French dressing. Mix thoroughly, and add more oil and 
vinegar if needed. Potatoes vary in the amount they will 
absorb. Chill thoroughly, and serve with a garnish of 
lettuce, parsley, celery, or boiled egg. 

French Dressing. — One-fourth teasjjoon of salt, one- 
eighth teaspoon of pepper, three tablesjioons of olive oil, 
and one tablespoon of vinegar, tarragon vinegar preferred. 

Sour Cream Dresssing, No. 1. — Three-fourths cup of 
sour cream, fill the cup with vinegar, stir in half a tea- 
spoonful salt and one saltspoonf id paprika , 

No. 2. — One pint thick sour cream, three tahlesp)oonfuls 
sugar, one level teaspoonful salt, one saltspoonful pap- 
rika, half a saltspoonful black pepper ttoo tablespoonfuls 
vinegar. 

No. 3. — One cup sour cream, one tahlespoonful sugar, 
half a teaspoonful salt, half a saltspoonful white pepper, 
one tablespoonful lemon juice. 

No. 4. — Make the usual mayonnaise with yolk of one 
raw egg, half a teaspoonful salt, one saltspoonful pa2Jri'ka, 
one saltspoonful mustard, one cup oil added in small por- 
tions until the mixture thickens, two tablespoonfuls lemon 
juice, and when ready to use, stir in hcdf a cup of sour 
cream. 

Cream Salad Dressing. — A small quantity of salad 
dressing may be made very quickly in an emergency, by 
simply mixing two teaspoonfuls of vinegar or lemon juice 
with four tablespoonfuls of sweet or sour cream, and 
seasoning with a speck of cayenne and salt and pepp>er 
to taste. 



Sandwiches. 525 



Whipped Cream Dressing. — Surround one cup of thick 
cream with broken ice, and whip it stiff with a wire whisk 
or egg-beater. Add gradually three tablespoons of lemon 
juice, three of grated horse-radish, one-half teaspoon of 
salt, and one-fourth teasj)oon of paprika. It should be 
stiff enough to keep in shape when dropped from the 
spoon. Keep it very cold till ready to serve. Mix a 
small portion of it with the oysters and cucumbers, and 
use the remainder for a garnish. (See Lincoln Salad.) 

Lettuce Salad with Claret Dressing. — Mix one teasp)Oon 
of German mustard, one half teaspoon of ,9^^/^, one-eighth 
teaspoon of freshly-ground pepper, four tablespoons of 
olive oil, one tablespoon of claret. Have a head of let- 
tuce washed and drained dry. Tear it into bits, put it 
in the bowl, pour the dressing over it, and toss about until 
well dressed. 

Boiled Dressing. {Mrs. Webster.) — Heat one-half cup 
vinegar in the top of the double boiler. In a small bowl, 
mix thoroughly, tv:o level teasp)oons of mustard, tivo 
level teaspoons of salt, three level tablespoons of sugar 
(less if preferred), one-fourth teaspoon of cayenne or 
p)aprika, tivo tablespoons of melted butter, and one cup of 
rich cream. Break four eggs into a large bowl and beat 
them until very liglit and thick, add the mixture and pour 
all into the hot vinegar in the double boiler. Cook like 
boiled custard, stirring constantly, and be careful that it 
does not curdle. 

Sorrento Sandwiches. — Boil the liver from a pair of 
chickens until very tender, rub through a strainer, and 
mix it with an equal amount of olives chopped very fine. 
Moisten with mayonnaise dressing, and put between two 
buttered rounds of bread. 

Salmon and Brown Bread Sandwiches. — Use brown 
bread which has been steamed in half-pound baking-powder 
cans. Cut in thin slices. Flake one cupful of cold boiled 



526 The Boston Cooh Book. 

sahnon and mix it to a paste with one tablespoonful may- 
onnaise dressing. Add more salt and cayenrie if desired. 
Spread it on the bread, cover with a layer of thin slices 
of cuciimber, then another round of bread, press lighth^ 
and arrange them in an overlapping circle around a few 
sprigs oi parsley. 

Sweetbread Sandwiches. — Break up one cold boiled 
sweetbread, remove the membranes and press through 
a potato-ricer. Moisten with half as much thick whipped 
cream, and season to taste with salt, cayenne, and lemon 
juice. Spread on thin slices of bread, cover with the 
leaves of watercress and another slice of buttered bread, 
press, and cut into triangles. 

Lettuce Sandwiches. — Select nice tender, crisp lettuce, 
wash and dry well, but do not make the sandwiches until 
just before serving. 

Butter the bread and cover with the lettuce, and spread 
« thin layer of salad dressing on the other slice, and press 
them together tightly. Cut in halves, or cut into rounds 
before filling. Tear the lettuce to fit the slices. When 
a rich mayonnaise is used, it is not necessary to spread 
with butter, although many recipes call for it. 

Flower Sandwiches. — Sweet clover, sweet peas, vio- 
lets, roses, cinnamon pinks, apple blossoms, nasturtiums, 
and heliotrope may be used, some for fragrance merely 
and some for a part of the filling. 

Flavor the butter by cutting the desired quantity ii^ 
small pieces, then la}^ it in thin cheese-cloth with the 
flowers all around it, and let it stand several hours in a 
close-covered jar. 

Spread the bread with the fragrant butter, and, if you 
like, sprinkle a few petals over the butter, then roll over 
and press firmly. Put them back with the flowers and 
cover tightly, and when ready to serve arrange them in a 
/lish with fresh flowers. 




Sayidwiches. . 527 



Cucumber Sandwiches. — Select cucumbers that are 
small and thio, that there may be no large seeds. Peel 
and slice as thinly as possible, into ice water, and let 
them stand ten minutes. Drain very dry, and place them 
between thin slices of bread which have been spread with 
mayonnaise dressing. 

German Cucumber Sandwiches. — Peel the large cu- 
cumbers, cut in quarters lengthwise, and cut off the inside. 
Slice very thin, and let them stand in cold salted water 
until they are soft. Drain and press between towels to 
remove all the water. Butter thin rounds of brown 
bread, cover with a layer of the cucumber, season with a 
thick French dressing, and cover with another buttered 
round of bread. 

Cheese and Nut Sandwiches. — Take equal parts of 
grated cheese and English walnuts pounded to a meal, 
or ground; moisten with thick sweet cream, and season to 
taste with salt. Spread between thin slices of buttered 
bread. 

No. 2. — Chop fine or run through an almond grater 
half a cup of peca?is. Melt half a cup of Edam cheese, 
and blend it thoroughly with the nuts. Add half a salt- 
spoon of paprika, and salt to taste. Spread the paste 
on thin slices of bread, and cut in small squares or 
triangles. 

Cherry Sandwiches. — Chop candied cherries fine, and 
moisten slightly with orange juice, or maraschino. 
Spread them on rounds of thin, lightly buttered bread, 
cover with another round, and serve on a dainty napkin. 

Crab-Apple Sandwiches. — Use whole-wheat bread, cut 
in one-third inch slices. Spread with a thin coating of 
thick cream, a little salt, and thin slivers of crab-ai)ple 
jelly. Serve these with lemonade. 



528 The Boston Cooh Booh. 

Ginger Sandwiches. — Bake a plain gingerbread in a 
thin sheet, or make soft cookies, and wiien cold cut into 
oblong pieces and split carefully. Spread with cream 
cheese, and put a thin slice of preserved ginger in the 
middle, cover, press slightly, and arrange on a napkin. 

Orange Marmalade Sandwiches. — Remove the crust 
from the end of a brick loaf of bread. Spread the end 
with creamed butter, and then cut off a thin even slice and 
repeat until you have sufficient. 

Spread marmalade over the buttered side of one slice, 
being careful not to put it near the crust, lay another 
buttered slice on this, press them together with a broad 
knife, and trim off the crust. If the slices are large, 
divide them into triangles, or squares, or three long nar- 
row pieces. Or you may roll them and press slighth'. 
Arrange them neatly in a fringed napkin, cover and serve 
as soon as possible. For a luncheon course you may use 
bread one day old, and toast it slightly before filling, and 
serve hot. 

Fig Sandwiches. — Use ripe figs that come in cans, or 
the delicious figs in cordial. Drain them from the S3U'up, 
then mash them to a paste, and spread on one part of 
the sandwich as directed for orange marmalade. 

Dates and Nuts. — Remove the stones and scales from 
the dates and break them up with a fork. Take half as 
much in bulk of pecans chopped fine or run through a 
nut-grater, mix them with the dates and moisten with 
creamed butter. Add a dash of salt; and spread between 
two thin slices of bread. 

Mushroom Sandwiches. — A popular sandwich for 
afternoon tea consists of thin slices of entire-wheat bread, 
with a layer of cooked mushrooms between. The mush- 
rooms should be stewed until tender, and superfluous 
moisture allowed to evaporate, that the bread may not 
become soggy. 



Cherry Tarts. 529 



Deep Apple Pie. — Fill a deep earthen or granite dish 
with apples, pared, quartered, and cored. Sprinkle over 
them half a cup of broivn sugar mixed with one saltsjjoon- 
fal of allsjjice; or you may use maple sugar, or half sugar 
and half molasses. Roll a strip of paste, one inch wide, 
wet the edge of the dish, put the paste on the edge, wet 
the rim of paste, then cover with a piece of paste a little 
larger than the dish, with the extra fulness thrown back 
into the centre. Press the cover to the rim, but not on 
the outer edge. Bake half an hour, or until the apples 
are soft. 

Cherry Tarts. — Into one cuj) of pastry JloKr mix one 
scant half teaspoon of salt. Add one-fourth cup of lard., 
and chop it fine, using a knife instead of the fingers to 
avoid softening the lard, which should have been kept on 
the ice till quite hard. Mix with cold water to a stiff 
dough. Toss it out on a floured board, and pound it flat 
half an inch thick. Put on butter in little dabs here and 
there, dredge it slightly with flour, roll up and pat it out 
again. Do this four times, using one-fourth cup in all. 
After the last patting out, put it on ice until chilled. 
Use small tin cups or corn-cake tins to shape the tarts. 
Sprinkle them with flour on the outside, shake off all that 
does not adhere, then cover the outside with a thin la3'er 
of the paste. Roll the paste very thin, and cut with a 
saucer or cutter which will give you just the size to fit 
the tin. Put th^ cups on a baking sheet and bake quickly. 
"When done, remove tlie tin by turning the cup over, and 
fill the crust with tiie prepared cherries. Wash, stem, and 
stone the cherries. Allow about one cup of sugar to one 
jnnt of cherries, if the very sour variety, possibly more 
will be needed. Put the sugar and one-half cup of water 
on the fire, and when boiling add the fruit, and cook ten 
minutes. Stir in one teaspoon of butter, and if the syrup 
seems thin, wet one teaspoon of cornstarch in cold water, 
and stir in sufficient to thicken it slightly. 



530 The Boston Cook Booh. 

A Quick Dessert. — When an emergency arises where a 
dessert must be prepared q.iickly, open a can of peaches, 
apricots, raspberries, or any available fruit. Put it in a 
rather large kettle with a close-fitting cover. While it is 
heating, mix one pint of prepared flour with one beaten 
egg and one scant capful of milk. Drop this like dump- 
lings in a stew over the fruit, cover closely, and steam 
from ten to fifteen minutes. Unless the fruit is juicy, 
there is danger that it will burn on the kettle while the 
dumplings are cooking. Serve the dumplings and fruit 
together with sugar and cream, or with a hard sauce. 

Noodles. {A German Dessert.) — Break two eggs into 
a bowl, and stir in as much flour as they will take up in 
making a very stifl" dough. Knead well. Roll out thin 
as a wafer, and roll up and cut off in thin strips. Let 
them boil in sweetened milk ten or fifteen minutes, or 
until done ; then skim them out. Rub two tablespoons 
of butter to a cream ; add four yolks of eggs beaten ;

A friend who received her culinary education in Aus- 
tria recommends the following as being a most delicious 

Macaroon Pudding. — Take eight zwieback, remove the 
crusts and put them in melted butter to soften ; then let 
them cool. 

Put half a 2)ound of macaroons^ using part butter and 
part suet^ into a bowl, and saturate them in claret icine 
thoroughly, or use syrup from whole pteaches or p)lums, 
if you don't care for the wine. Remove the seeds from 
quarter of a pound of raisins, and cut the same amount 
of citron in small thin slices. Mix one teasjwon of cin- 
namon with one teaspoon of powdered sugar. 



Puddings. 5 3 1 



Butter a pudding mould, sprinkle with fine cracker or 
bread crumbs, and line it with the softened zwieback. 
Putin a layer of macaroons, then a layer of citron, spices, 
and raisins ; then another layer of macaroons and another 
of zwieback. Mix half a cup of cream with four to six 
beaten eggs, and pour this over the pudding. Add also 
the wine or syrup left from the macaroons. Steam it ono 
hour, and serve with creamy sauce. 



Creamy 1 pt. milk. 
Sponge 1 heaped cup flour. 
Pudding. 1^ cup sugar. 



1 rounded tbsp. butter. 
3 eggs. 




Scald half of the milk in a double boiler. Mix the 
sugar and flour, add the cold milk, and stir into the boil- 
ing milk. Cook five minutes, stirring until it thickens. 
Stir the butter in and when well mixed remove from the 
fire, and when nearly cold stir in the well-beaten yolks of 
the eggs. Beat the whites of the eggs until stiff and dry, 
and fold them in lightly. Turn into a buttered pudding 
dish, place the dish in a pan of hot water, and bake half 
an hour in a hot oven. Serve immediately. This is a 
delicious pudding and convenient to make, as the mate- 
rials are such as one would usually have on hand, and the 
first part of the process may be done in the early part of 
the day, leaving nothing to be done at dinner time except 
to beat the whites of the eggs. Plan to put it into the 
oven just half an hour before it will be served, as it is 
better if it be served directly from the oven to the table. 
When properly baked, it will not fall, and if any be left 
over it can be reheated for another meal, and will be 
good, even if not as nice as at first. Creamy sauce 
should be served with it.

Grandmother's Pound Cake. — For many years I tried 
in vain to make a pound cake that would have the soft, 
velvety texture which I remembered in that eaten at the 
table of a dear friend in my girlhood. The recipes which 
I tried made a fairly good cake, light and fine flavor, but 
the texture was never what I desired. 

Soon after my Boston Cook Book was completed a 
friend gave me her mother's recipe for pound cake, and 
it was as definite as most of the old style formulas. One 
and one-half teacups butter.^ two blue cups sugar., five un- 
beaten eggs, added one at a time, and five haiuJfuls of 
unsifted flour. Fortunately, my friend could show me 
by actual measurement just what she meant by handfuls 
of flour, and how she packed the butter in the teacup. 
The recipe then, as it stands, after a careful weighing 
and measurement by our standard half-pint cup, reads 
thus: One cup butter packed solid, OJie and tico-thirds 
cups granulated sugar, one-half teaspoon inace, five un- 
beaten eggs, tico cups sifted \)^^ivy flour. Have a round 
pan, greased and floured, the oven ready and ingredients 
measured, as the mixing must all be done b}^ the hand. 
Cream the butter, add sugar, and work until very light, 
add spice and one egg at a time, and stir with the hand 
until you do not see any of the a^g yolk, then another Q^g^, 
and so on until all are used. Then mix in the flour, and 
turn at once into the pan, and bake slowl}^, about an hour. 

The grain of the cake should be fine and close, with not 
a suspicion of any toughness or heaviness, not porous 
like a cake made light with gas from soda and cream of 
tartar or by long beating, and yet soft, light, and velvety. 
This texture is obtained by the thorough blending of the 
butter and sugar, and not over beating the eggs. 



538 TJie Boston Cook Book. 



Boswell 3 cups butter. 
Cake. 6 cups sugar. 

(Mrs. Gould.) 8 eggs. 

3 cups milk. 

10 cups flour. 

2 lbs. raisins. 



1 nutmeg. 
1 teasp. mace. 
1 teasp. soda. 
1 Avine-glass St. Croix 
rum. 



Pick over aud seed the raisins, and flour them with 
part of the measure of flour. 

Mix the spice with one cup of the flour. 

Measure the butter easy, in pieces about like walnuts 
packed in lightly, cream it with the sugar, and beat into 
it the well-beaten yolks of eggs. 

Reserve one-fourth cup of milk to wet the soda. Warm 
the remainder of milk with the rum. 

Then add the spiced flour to the butter mixture, then 
a little of the milk, and beaten whites of eggs, then al- 
ternate flour, milk, and egg white, until all are used. vStir 
in the fruit before the last portion of flour is added, and, 
if stiff enough, do not use all the flour. Add the soda 
dissolved in the milk last. 

Bake in several small round pans, frost, aud serve in 
the whole loaf, dividing it as needed. 

White Mountain Cake. — The distinguishing feature of 
this cake is that it has a soft frosting, or cream, instead 
of jelly, between the layers. This cream is sometimes 
flavored and enriched with chopped nuts, or fruits. The 
cake is baked in pans which are much deeper than jelly 
cake tins, and in most stores they are known as White 
Mountain cake pans.

Filling for White Mountain Cake. — Put half a cup boil- 
ing ivater and one cup granulated sugar in a smooth 
saucepan over the teakettle, and stir until sugar melts. 
Place it over the fire, and boil without stirring. Dip a 
silver fork in occasionally, and when the syrup forms a 
fine thread as the fork is withdrawn, it is done. Mean- 
while, have the ichites of tivo eggs beaten stiff, and slowly 
pour the syrup onto it, beating as you pour. Beat until 
thick enough to spread easily, then flavor with iico tea- 
spoons lemon juice, and spread it over the cake. Add 
half a cup of pineap2)le chopped and drained, or any fine 
French candied fruit, or raisins, figs, nuts, in any com- 
bination you please. Mix them with a part of the frost- 
ing for the middle layers, and save a few larger pieces 
of the fruit or nuts for the top, pressing them into the 
icing before it hardens.

odor and a warm sweetish taste. 



Hermits. 



1/^ cups sugar. 
y^ cup butter. 
2 eggs. 

2 cups seedless raisins 

3 tbsp. milk. 

Cream the butter and sugar, add the eggs well beaten, 
then the milk. Mix the soda and spices (cinnamon,

nutmeg, and clove) with one cup of flour ; add the raisins, 
which must be washed, boiled until tender in water tcr 
cover, and drained, cut in halves or chopped, and floured. 
Tlien add flour to roll about a quarter of an inch thick, 
cut out in fancy shapes and bake quickly. 

Walnut Wafers. — Cream one-fourth of. a cup (two 
ounces) of butter gradually, add half a cup of poivclered 
sugar, and almost drop by drop four tablespooifuls of 
milk. Next mix in a scant cupful of bread flour, a few 
drops of any flavoring extract jji-eferred, and one-fourth of 
a cuiful of chopped walnuts. Spread on the bottom of an 
inverted dripping pan as thin as possible. The pan 
should be buttered unless it is very smooth. Because it 
is difficult to spread unless the nut meats are very finely 
chopped, many prefer to sprinkle them over the top of 
the dough after it is spread on the pan. Almond iiast€ 
may be creamed in with the butter. 

Mark in squares, then sprinkle with the nuts, and bake 
in a moderate oven. In five minutes they should be ready 
to roll, and this must be done at the oven door before 
they have a chance to cool a particle. With a wafer iron 
the process is slower, but the shape can be made more 
uniform. 

Sand Cakes. — Cream one scant cup of butter with one cap 
and a half of light brown sugar. Beat two eggs, reserving 
part of one ivhite, and beat them into the butter. Mix 
half a teaspoon of cinnamon, two level teaspoons oi baking- 
poivder, with three and a half cups of floui', stir this into 
the butter ; add another half cup of flour if needed to roll 
thin as a wafer. Use fancy cutters, hearts, diamonds, 
etc. ; lay the cakes in a greased baking pan. Brush the 
top with the remaining egg ichite. Split blanched almonds 
and put three ov four on each cake in corners or radiating 
from the centre. Mix one fourth of a teaspoon cinnamon 
with one-fourth of a cup coarse granulated sugar and 
sprinkle it over the cakes. Bake in a quick oven six or 
eight minutes.

Fancy Ice Creams. — Fancy ice creams depend largely 
for their right to this name, upon the moulding. Any 
good recipe for a cream ice or water ice may be used, 
but it is not advisable to attempt much in this line unless 
you have two freezers and a variety of fancy moulds. 
Plain brick moulds, melon moulds, brown bread moulds, 
pails, baking--powder cans, or fruit cans, if they are water 
tight, may all be utilized. Individual fancy moulds are 
quite expensive, but if one can afford their first cost, and 
is likely to use them often, it is cheaper in the end than to 
depend upon the confectiol!er. 

Caf^ Parfait, No. 1. — Mix half a cup of strong clear 
coffee with one pint of medium cream. Sweeten to taste and 
stir until the sugar is dissolved. Place the bowl of cream 
in a pan of ice. When the cream is chilled, whip it with 
a whip-churn and skim off the froth into a strainer placed 
over a granite pan, which should be in another pan of ice 
to keep the whipped portion cold. Pack a mould in ice 
and salt, and when the whipped cream is drained, pack it 
into the mould. The liquid cream which drains through 
may be whipped again. Be careful not to have any liquid 
cream in the mould. Cover the mould and let it stand in 
the ice from two to three hours. 

Cafe Parfait, No. 2. — Make half a cup clear strong coffee. 
Beat the yolks of three eggs^ add half a saltspoon of salt 
and half a cup of sugar, and when well mixed stir it into 
the coffee and cook in a double boiler till thick and 
smooth, stirring constantly. Strain, and when cold add 
one quart of cream, whipped. Beat until well blended, and 
add more sugar if needed. Turn into the freezer can, 
packed in ice and salt, and freeze without turning the 
crank. 

Line a melon mould with an inch-thick la3^er of vanilla 
or plain coffee ice cream, then fill the centre with the 
whipped cream as in No. 1, and cover with ice cream. 
Pack in ice and salt, and let it stand for three hours. 



Sultana Roll. 



551 



lumps of loaf sugar which are afterward dissolved in the 
juice. Mix the lemon s^^rup with the ice-cold milk, and 
freeze as usual. When the milk is very cold, there is 
little danger that it will curdle. 

Ice Cream with Fruit Syrup. — Fill punch glasses 
half full with vanilla ice cream. Crush strawberries 
and sweeten to taste with sugar dissolved in a little 
water boiled and cooled. Pour the fruit over the ice 
cream, nearly filling the glass. 

Banana Ice Cream. — Select eight large nice bananas^ 
ripe, but free from all blemish on the skin. Wipe them, 
and carefully peel off the flat strip of skin. Remove the 
pulp, scrape out the fibrous portion from the skins, and 
put them in the ice chest until the cream is ready. Mash 
the pulp of half of the bananas, mix with it two ciqjs of 
sugar and 07ie quart of cream of medium thickness, add 
one saltspoon of saU., and tivo of lemon juice. Press it 
through a fine sieve and freeze. Chop fine some French 
candied fruity cherries^ green plums, and angelica enough 
to make eigJit rounded tablespoonfuls. When the cream 
is nearly frozen, put a layer of it in the banana skins, 
sprinkle a tablespoonful of the fruit over the cream, add 
enough more cream to fill the skins, lay back the strip, 
and tie them with narrow green ribbons. Put them into 
a clean freezer, and let them stand surrounded with ice 
and salt, for an hour or two to ripen. Serve them on 
plates lined with lace paper. 

Sultana Roll. — Wash and soak o?ie-f on rth of a cup 
of Sultanas in brandy or wi7ie to cover. Mix one scant 
tablespoon of fiour and a speck of salt with one cup of 
sugar ; add one egg^ and beat well. Pour on slowly one 
pint oi hot milk. Turn into the double boiler, and cook 
twenty minutes. Cool and stir in one quart of cream ^ a 
few drojjs of almond and a tablespoon of vanilla. Color 
a delicate green with gveen color 2^<^tste. Freeze it, and 



552 The Boston Cook Book. 

then use it to line baking-powder cans, pound size. Scat 
ter the drained Sultanas through the cream, fill the centre 
with thick cream^ sweetened, flavored with vanilla and 
whipped stiff. Cover, and let the cans stand in ice and 
salt one or two hours. Turn out, cut in slices, and serve 
with 

Claret Sauce. — Boil one cup of sugar with one-fourth 
of a ciqj of water; when slightly thickened, cool and add 
one-half of. a cup of claret. 



Frozen 1 quart milk. 

Pudding. 1 hpd. tbsp. arrowroot. 
[E. E. Squire.) 2 cups sugar. 

3^ level t-sp. salt. 

3 cups cream. 



4 eggs, whites. 

1 tbsp. vanilla. 

1^ lb. French fruit. 

2 oz. pistachio nuts. 
Color and flavor to taste. 



Scald the milk in a double boiler. Mix the arrowroot, 
sugar, and salt thoroughly, turn them into the boiling milk 
and stir constantly until it thickens and is smooth. Cook 
for twenty minutes. Or if you prefer you may wet the 
arrowroot with a little cold milk and stir it, into the boil- 
ing milk and then add the sugar. 

Let this mixture become very cold, and when ready to 
freeze it, whip the cream to a light froth, beat the eggs 
until light, but not stiff, and stir them into the cold mix- 
ture. Should there be any doubt as to the sweetness of 
the cream, scald and cool it, before whipping. Add the 
vanilla, using enough to give a strong flavor. If you like, 
you may color it a delicate tint with yellow, pink, or green 
color paste. 

Turn it into the freezer and when partly frozen stir in 
the French fruit and nuts. The fruit should be cut into 
small bits. Candied cherries, apricots, and green plums 
make an agreeable combination. Blanch the nuts in 
boiling water until the skins loosen easily, remove them, 
and cut into thin slices. 

Frozen pudding as usuall}^ served at first-class hotels 
is flavored with a fine quality of Santa Cruz or Jamaica 




Green Apple Sauce. 553 

Rum, about two tablespoonfuls put in with the fruit. 
Those who approve of and are accustomed to this flavor 
would doubtless consider a frozen pudding made without 
it, as not worthy of the name, but when made after this 
recipe it is delicious with only the vanilla flavoring, and 
although more expensive than the usual formula, ii \d 
well worth an occasional trial. \^ ^

Strawberry Ice Cream. — Sprinkle Uvo cups of sugar 
over tivo quarts of strawberries. Mash them, and let 
them stand half an hour, or until the sugar is dissolved ; 
and meanwhile prepare the ice, and pack the freezer. 
Turn the berries into a large square of cheese-cloth, 
placed over a bowl, and squeeze as long as any juice or 
pulp will come. Then empty the pulp and seeds left in 
the cloth into a pan, and pour on gradually about a pint 
of milk; mix it well with the pulp, until the pulp is sep- 
arated from the seeds. Squeeze again until perfectly 
dry. There should be nothing left in the cloth save a 
ball of seeds. Add to the juice as much cream as you 
may have, from one cup to three innts,, and sugar to 
make it very sweet. Freeze as usual. After tasting 
this, you will never want any other strawberry ice 
cream. 

Stev7ed Green Apple Sauce. — The first green apples 
that are found in the market usually awaken an appetite 
for apple sauce and apple pie. The former is seldom 
seen in perfection. Try this method. 

With a sharp silver knife cut the apples in quarters, 
remove the cores and skin and put them, as fast as pared, 
into a bowl of cold water. When all are ready, skim them 
out into a porcelain-lined or agate kettle with a large 
surface, so there will not be much depth to the apples. 
Add boiling water, just to show among the pieces, cover 
tightly to keep in the steam, and let them cook quickly. 
Shake the pan occasionally, and as soon as soft, mash 
them with a silver fork, sprinkle over sugar to taste, 



554 T^^ Boston Cook Booh. 

cover again and cook until the sugar is dissolved, and 
serve hot or cold. It should be free from lumps, white 
or about the shade of the inside of a lemon, and not too 
sweet. When eaten hot for breakfast, sometimes a pat 
of butter is an improvement. AYhen cooked in this care- 
ful way, it will be far more appetizing than if of a dingy- 
bi'own color, of half cooked, and there will be no occasion 
for sifting it. 

Bananas "with Fruit Sauce. — Pick over one quart of 
curra7its ; wash, drain, and mash them. Sprinkle over 
them one cup of sugar ^ and let them stand until the sugar 
is dissolved. Stir occasiouallj^, then squeeze through 
coarse cheese-cloth, or press through a strainer fine 
enough to keep back the seeds. Peel four ba7ianas^ re- 
move all the stringy membranes, cut them in halves 
lengthwise and crosswise. Arrange them in a shallow 
glass dish, and pour the currant juice over them. Keep 
it in a cold place until ready to serve. The flavor of the 
currant juice improves the bananas, and the color gives 
a pretty effect. Do not use the currants without sifting, 
for the seeds will be quite objectionable in the sauce. 
Blackberry juice may be used in the same way. A cool, 
simple dessert like this is more acceptable on a summer 
day than a hot starchy pudding served with meringue or 
whipped cream. 

Stewed Prunes. — It would appear that so simple a 
thing as a dish of stewed prunes might always be accept- 
ably served, but they are usually too sweet or insuffici- 
ently cooked. All dried fruits — that is, fruits that have 
been deprived of their natural juices by quick evapora- 
tion, or sun drying — need to have this juice or water 
replaced by a long soaking in cool water before being 
subjected to heat. This softens the cellular tissues so 
that they can absorb the water, the fruit swells out to 
nearly its natural condition ; and then by the heat ap- 
plied in cooking, the softening process is continued until 
every particle of the skin is, or should be, perfectly soft. 



Preserved Strawberries. 555 

Just enough water to cover them, so that all may be 
equally softened, is all that is necessary, and when the 
prunes are sufficiently cooked this should boil down to a 
thick syrup. Except in some of the most acid varieties, 
no sugar is needed. In fact, many prunes are so rich in 
sugar that a little lemon juice seems to be an improve- 
ment. It is understood, of course, that the prunes should 
be well washed in tepid water before they are soaked. 

Preserved Strawberries. — Select the choicest berries 
and lay aside not necessarily very large ones, but per- 
fect, firm, and of even size they must be. Press the re- 
mainder of the fruit for juice, taking only what drips 
easily. These berries can be used later for a jam. 

To a pound of juice allow a pound of sugar, and make 
as one does any jelly. Boil fully twenty minutes until 
surely jellied. Meantime weigh the fruit selected and an 
equal amount of sugar. Add these then to the jelly and 
boil carefully a few minutes more. No exact time can be 
given. It would not keep with raw strawberries dropped 
in, neither must they be allowed to shrivel like preserved 
ones. Occasionally try it on a saucer, keeping the kettle 
at a simmer only. Do not do much at a time. It is bet- 
ter to repeat the operation. When it grows firm in the 
saucer, put in a cold place, remove it from the fire (and 
seal, as usual, when cold), dipping it with care into glasses 
soon after taking from the fire. 

It will not be a jelly that moulds like gooseberry or like 
quince and sustains its weight. It is apt to fall in lusci- 
ous masses, catching the light in its clear red depths and 
showing the imprisoned berries. 

A very little apple juice prepared as for jelly — and 
carefully strained — added at the beginning, with the 
same allowance of sugar, pound for pound or fractions 
thereof, would help it to form or "set" as old house- 
keepers say, and the flavor would not be detected. This 
is frequently done for making pear, cherry, and peach 
jellies, for the same reason that they do not form jelly 



556 The Boston Cook Booh. 

well alone. A flaunel jelly bag is very nice for a second 
straining, using the usual linen cheese-cloth for the first 
pressing. Cincinnati Recipe. 

Pot-Pourri. — Put a innt of alcohol or white preserving 
hrandy into a large stone jar that has a tightly fitting 
cover ; then, as the summer fruits come on, put them 
into the alcohol with an equal amount of sugar; thus ci 
cup of sugar and a cup) of fruit. Stir every day with a 
clean wooden spoon. Use strawberries, pineapples, rasp- 
berries, currants, blackberries, apricots, cherries, peaches, 
plums, and grapes. Plums and peaches should be peeled, 
stoned, and cut fine. Cherries should be stoned, and 
grapes should be seeded. The alcohol is enough for the 
jarful of fruit, and will cook and keep the fruit perfectly. 
About a month after putting in the last fruit, it will be 
ready to use. 

As the seeds of small fruits become hard by the brandy, 
it is better to mash them and use only the juice, particu- 
larly with currants, blackberries, and raspberries. 

Rhubarb Jelly. — September, or not earlier than the 
middle of August, is the best time to make rhubarb jelly, 
as it is almost impossible for it to thicken when made of 
the spring rhubarb. 

Wash the rhubarb, but do not peel it, simply cut it into 
small pieces and never mind if it be stringy. To every 
pound of rhubarb add half a cup of water and let it stew 
slowly in a granite or porcelain pan until it is all in 
shreds. Then strain through a fine cloth. Measure the 
juice and allow one pound of sugar to one pint oi juice. 
Let the juice simmer ten minutes, or until it begins to 
thicken on the edge, then add the sugar and let it simmer 
till it jellies on the spoon or when dropped on a cool 
plate. Remove the scum carefully when done, turn into 
glasses which have been rolled in hot water and are still 
standing in it, and when cold and firm, pour melted par- 
aflfine over the top. Cover with paper and keep in a cool, 
dark closet. 



Preserved Citron. 557 

Wild Unripe Grape Sauce. — Wash the grapes and re- 
move the stems. Cut through the middle with a sharp knife 
and remove the seeds. Then weigh the fruit and aUow 
an equal weight of sugar. Put the cut fruit in a kettle 
with cold water to show just to the top of the fruit. Let 
it boil, remove the scum, then sprmkle over it one quarter 
of the sugar. Boil again and press the grapes down, but 
do not stir to break tliem. Then add another quarter of 
the sugar, and when it has boiled five or eight minutes, 
repeat until all the sugar is used. Cook slowly until the 
syrup is thick or will jelly. Turn into small jars or 
glasses and seal with paper. When cold, the grapes 
should be quite distinct in the clear jelly. 

Grape Jelly. — The wild grapes, gathered just as they 
begin to turn, are the best for jelly. Cultivated grapes, 
if fully ripe, are quite likely to disappoint one, if used 
for jelly ; the color is dark and unattractive, and the com- 
pound is often a syrup rather than a jelly, but they make 
delicious marmalade. 

Wash the grapes and free them from the stems. Put 
them in the kettle, and mash them until all broken. Heat 
slowl}', and cook until the juice is well drawn out. Then 
place a square of cheese-cloth over a colander, and set 
the colander over a bowl. Turn in the grapes, and let it 
drip without any pressure. Measure the juice, and allow 
an equal measure of sugar. If wild grapes are used, 
allow a little more than an equal portion of sugar. Boil 
the juice fifteen minutes. Skim, and strain again, then 
add the sugar, and boil until the surface looks wrinkled, 
and the Uquid jellies on the edge. Skiin well, and turn 
into glasses. 

Preserved Citron. — Cut the citron melon in halves each 
way, then cut each quarter in three quarter-inch slices 
from the stem and blossom ends to the middle. In this 
way you cut across the seeds, and they can be more easily 
removed than if the melon be cut in the same direction 
that the seeds lie. 




558 The Boston Cook Book. 

Pick out all the seeds, and cut the slices in squares, 
stars, triaDgles, or any shape preferred. Put the harder 
outside pieces by themselves. Weigh the fruit and allow 
an equal weight of sugar or a little less if you prefer. 
Cook the citron in clear water until tender and transpar- 
ent, the harder pieces first. As the fruit softens, take it 
out into another kettle or deep dish and sprinkle each 
layer with sugar. When it is all cooked, let it stand until 
the sugar is nearl}^ dissolved and some of the citron juice 
is drawn out. Then put it over the fire again, and let it 
heat slowly until the fruit is heated through. Remove 
the fruit into the jars, which should be near at hand, in 
a pan of hot water. Boil the syrup down until it seems 
thick and rich, then pour it into the jars and seal quickly. 
If the fruit seems diy after standing in the sugar, you 
may add a little water when it is put on to boil. If you 
like, you may use the thinly shaved rind and juice of one 
lemon to each jar of fruit. Be sure that the lemon is not 
bitter. One tablespoonful of crystallized ginger cut fine 
gives a flavor preferred by many. 

Strawberry Tomato Preserve. — For one pound of 
strawberry tomatoes allow one-half jmund of sugar and 
one lemon. 

Remove the husks. Make a syrup with the sugar and 
water enough to dissolve it, bring it to a boil and remove 
the scum. Add the tomatoes and let them stew until 
heated through, then skim them out and boil the syrup 
down until quite thick. Cook the sliced lemon in boil- 
ing water until the rind is tender, then add it to the 
syrup. 

Tutti Prutti for Tarts. — Take equal parts of stoned 
cherries, currants, red raspberries, and large gooseberries. 
Mash the currants, squeeze out the juice, and use that to 
dissolve the sugar. Allow one pound of sugar to each 
pou!2^ of frnit. Mis aud boil until thick like jam. De- 
licious for taria 



Mangoes. 559 



Lemon Butter. — The juice and grated rind of tJiree 
lemons^ three eyys well beaten, one pound of sugar^ one 
smaU cup of ivater^ one level teasjmonful oi butter. Beat 
well together and boil five minutes or until thick. Keep 
it in covered jelly-glasses. This is an English recipe. 

Mangoes. — These are made from small, green water or 
muskmelons, green tomatoes, peppers, peaches, large cu- 
cumbers, or any fruit from which the seeds, stone, or 
inside portion can be removed, the cavity filled with a 
higiily-seasoned mixture, and the opening closed again in 
such a way as to give the appearance of whole fruit. In 
using peppers and green tomatoes, cut a circular piece 
from the stem end, remove the seeds, and put the pieces 
in place again, or beside the one from which they were 
taken. If melons are used, cut out a piece one inch wide 
and three long, then scoop out the seeds and soft portion. 
When the fruit is prepared, let it soak over night in 
strongly-salted water. In the morning drain, and be 
careful to have the cut portions kept where they belong. 
Prepare the following mixture to use as stuffing : Chop 
enough firm, white cahhage to fill the cavities, it is im- 
possible to give the exact amount. You may use with it, 
if you prefer, one-fourth part of chopped celery , or green 
tomatoes^ or cucumbers. Sprinkle well with salt and let 
it stand two hours. Allow one small onion, two or three 
nasturtium-seeds ^ and half a teaspoonful of v'hole nuis- 
tard-seed to each pint of chopped vegetables. Season to 
i^^io, yf'xih ground cloves^ cinnamon, allspicey ginger, pep- 
pier, and salt. Mix thoroughly, and then fill the cavities ; 
press it in well, fit in the pieces that were removed, and 
then tie them firmly with fine twine. Put the mangoes in 
a preserving kettle, cover with cold vinegar and let them 
remain over night. The next morning heat all together 
and simmer gently half an hour. Take them out care- 
fully and put in a stone jar and cover with cold vinegar. 
The next morning pour off the vinegar, add h<ilf a cup of 
sugar to each quart of vinegar., bring to a boil, and pour 



560 The Boston Cook Booh. 

it over the mangoes. Repeat this for three or four morn- 
ings, and after the last scalding, cover when cool, and 
put away in a dry place. The latter part of this process 
applies only to mangoes made from melons and cucum- 
bers. Pepper and tomato mangoes are simply covered 
with cold vinegar after stuffing, then put away, and in a 
mouth they will be ready for the table. 

Orange Marmalade. — One dozen of large navel oranges. 
Cut in halves, and scoop out the juice. Boil the peels 
two or three hours in plenty of water until you can run a 
broom corn through them. Drain, and when cool enough 
to handle, scrape out all the white, lea\ing only the yellow 
outside. Cut into straws. Weigh the pulp free from 
membrane and add an equal weight of sugar. Boil pulp, 
sugar, and straws for two hours, and then turn into glasses. 
It makes six one-pint jelly tumblers. 

Vegetable Jelly Salad. 
One quart of sliced cucumbers, or one pint of sliced 
celery. Add one slice of onion, one quart of cold water, 
salt and pepper, and stew till soft and reduced to tliree 
cups of liquid. Add one-half box of Crystal gelatine 
soaked in one-half cup of cold water, stir well, strain 
without pressure, and again through fine cloth if not clear. 
Mould it in a ring ; or small cups ; or make cups of the jelly 
by moulding it in two of different size. Serve as a border 
for fresh cucumbers, or to^iold celery and apple salad. 

Junket Ice Cream. 
Sweeten fresh strawberries, mash well ; when sugar is 
dissolved, strain through fine cheese cloth ; to one cup of 
the juice add one cup of thin cream and one quart of pure 
unscalded milk. Heat over boiling water till blood warm, 
remove, stir in two junket tablets dissolved in two table- 
spoons of cold water, and turn at once into the freezer 
can. Let it stand in a warm place till jellied, then pack 
the freezer with ice and salt and freeze as usual. The 
milk will jelly without beating if it stands several hours.
