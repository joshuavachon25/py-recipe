This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you. 

Usage guidelines 

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 

We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attribution The Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find 
additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it. 

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner 
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite severe.

PREFACE 



**To be a good cook means the 
knowledge of all fruits, herbs, 
balms and spices, and of all that 
is healing and sweet in field and 
proves, and savory in meats; 
means carefulness, inventiveness, 
watchfulness, willingness and 
readiness of appliances. It means 
the economy of your great- 
grandmothers and the science of 
modern chemists. It means much 
tasting and no wasting. It means 
English thoroughness, French 
art and Arabian hospitality. It 
means, in fine, that you are to be 
perfectly and always ladies (loaf- 
givers) and to see that every one 
has something nice to eat."

You want good furniture 
in your home; furniture 
that improves on acquaint- 
ance and is so well made 
that your children, grand- 
children and great grand- 
children may use it and be 
proud of it. 

There's just as real honesty today 
in furniture making as there was in 
the Colonial days, if you know where 
to go to find it. 

SchoIIe furniture is the honest kind, 
and the new Scholle store is the best ap- 
pointed furniture store in the country. 

No matter what you want in furniture 
you'll find it here and at a price as low as 
honest workmanship and honest methods 
will justify — you'll get big value. 

You're as welcome if you come only to look 
around as if you came to buy. Come.

VOU want to be sure of two things 

-■■ about the milk you use: 

1st. It must come from healthy cows: 
2nd. It must be kept clean after it comes from the 
cows. 

There's one certain and safe way to know these — 
use only BORDEN'S milk and cream from healthy 
cows and the cleanest bottling plants on earth.

According to the size of family have Shoulder 
of Lamb cut in small pieces to correspond in size 
with quartered onions and tomatoes, with peppers 
cut about the same size as other vegetables, and 

[)lace alternately on skewers. Sprinkle plentiful- 
y with salt and pepper. 

Have the bottom of the broiler just covered 
with water, place skewers in rows on rack of 
broiler and put in with slow fire, turning fre- 
quently while broiling, that everything may be 
cooked through, being careful not to dry it. 

When done place on platter, leaving food on 
skewers "Oriental Style" just as we serve "corn 
on the cob." 

This may be made on the broiler without 
using skewers, if desired.

prepared as follows : 

2 cups rich sweet milk 2 tablespoons flour 
2 tablespoons butter 

Stir well until smooth over sufficient heat, adding the 
crab meat carefully freed from all hard pieces; at the 
last add Yi cup sherry wine. The cream must be quite 
thick because the wine thins it. Pimentoes may be added. 
This cream is about the quantity for 1 can of Izunni crab 
meat (40 cents), and will serve six persons. Serve on 
slices of dry toast. — Mrs. M, B. Griswold

*'I am one that am nourished by my victuals 
and would fain have meat, * * 

Twf0 GentUmen of Verona 



HOW TO BROIL STEAK PROPERLY 

Trim the steak, cutting out a portion of the suet. Place 
the steak in a wire broiler and if you use coal or wood put 
it very near the fire. First sear it on one side, then turn 
and sear it on the other. Then lift it at least six inches from 
the fire and broil more quickly, turning it 2 or 3 times. 
If the steak is 1 inch thick broil it for 8 minutes; if an 
inch and half thick, for 12 minutes; if 2 inches, for 
20 minutes. In a gas stove put the meat near the burners. 
Turn it at first until both sides are thorougVily seared ; then 
put the broiler near the bottom of the stove where the meat 
will broil slowly for 8, 12 or 20 minutes, according to its 
thickness. Turn 2 or 3 times during the broiling. Season 
when done. 



TO DRY-PAN A STEAK 

Where oil or flat-top gas stoves are used broiling is out 
of the question. The next best method is the dry-pan. 
Select a cast or sheet iron pan, heat it very hot ; quickly rub 
it with suet and put in the steak; when seared turn and 
sear quickly the other side. Cook at a high heat for 5 
minutes, turning every minute. Finish the cooking over 
a hot fire. Do not stand it in the oven to finish, which is 
the common fashion among the untrained cooks. The 
imprisoned odors penetrate the meat and destroy its deli- 
cate flavor. The standing at reduced temperature makes 
it more or less insipid. If the heat be insufficient in any 
method of meat cookery the proper flavor will not be 
developed.

CHICKEN EN CASSEROLE 



1 chicken 1 teaspoon salt 

1 carrot 12 small onions 

1 quart boiling water or 1 saltspoon pepper 
stock 

Draw and truss the chicken. Peel the onions, and put 
them into the bottom of a casserole dish; add the carrot 
cut into fancy shapes, the stock or water, and the pepper. 
Pour it into the mould. Place the chicken on top of the 
vegetables and bake, imcovered, in a hot oven for half an 
hour. When the chicken is nicely browned add the salt, 
cover the dish and bake slowly for 1 hour longer. 

Birds, rabbits, hares, and all the so-called inferior 
pieces of meat may be cooked en casserole the same as 
chicken. The oven must be exceedingly hot at first to 
sear the meat before placing the cover on the mould. Al- 
ways add the salt when the meat is partly done. Adding it 
at first draws out the juices and leaves the fibre exposed 
and tough. 



ROASTED DUCK 

After the duck is picked, drain and thoroughly wash, 
cut the neck close to the back and beat the breast bone 
flat ; tie wings and legs securely and fill with potato stuffing 
prepared as follows: Cook 1 quart potatoes and 2 apples, 
beat up well and season with J/$ teaspoon salt, J4 teaspoon

is sufficient for a large young duck. Cook giblets in 1 quart 
water with small onion, blade of mace and dash of cayenne 
pepper. When very tender cut giblets up very fine, strain 
the water they have cooked in and add to gravy the duck 
was cooked with and boil up and thicken, then add 1 table- 
spoon maderia, pour a little on the duck and the rest in

lay 3 strips of sweet green peppers, crossed, putting over the 
whole a nice mayonnaise dressing ; the bread is then placed 
in a nest of crisp lettuce leaves and a thin slice of lemon is 
placed on each plate.

on a few lettuce leaves on each plate, and over it put a

ricer ; around this put a circle of mayonnaise dressing and 
bar-le-duc in center. A prettier dish can hardly be imagined

GLAZED SWEETBREADS 

Place sweetbreads, prepared as directed below, in a 
saute pan with butter and a few slices onion. Saute them 
for a few minutes on both sides, then place them in the 
oven to finish cooking. Put a little stock in the baking pan 
and baste them frequently and brown and glaze them. 

TO PREPARE THE SWEETBREADS 

Soak the sweetbreads in cold water for 2 hours, 
changing the water several times. Put them on the fire in 
cold water. When they are whitened, or firm to the touch, 
or parboiled, remove and immerse again in cold water 
to blanch them. Remove all the pipes, fibers and fatty

Household Hints 



GREASE ON SILK 

Alix equal parts powdered French chalk and fuller's 
earth to a paste with turpentine or water and apply to 
spots, allowing it to stay on a few days before brushing 
off. 

FRUIT STAINS AND MILDEW 

If on white fabric soak first in water, then in J^ pint 
of water containing 1 teaspoon oxalic acid. 

GOLD BRAID 

Brush free dust with fine brush and rub it in powdered 
rock alum, which will remove the tarnish. 

TO TAKE RUST SPOTS OUT OF WHITE GOODS 

Hold the stain over the nose of a boiling teakettle and 
drop on lemon juice. The spot will immediately disap- 
pear. If it is a bad stain repeat the operation. 

Equal parts of ammonia and turpentine will remove 
paint of long standing from clothing. 

Turpentine will often remove ink from white goods. 
Soak the stain in the turpentine. 

Mustard plasters made with white of an egg vill not 
blister, while the result is just as good. 

The white of a raw egg turned over a bum or scald 
is soothing and cooling. If applied quickly it will prevent 
inflamation. 

As soon as a cold sore appears, wet the spot with 
camphor and cover with powdered subnitrate of bismuth.

HOUSEHOLD HINTS 19L 

It is said, if a piece of camphor be placed in a silver 
chest, the Silver will not become discolored. 

To cut hard boiled eggs in smooth slices, dip knife in 
water. 

Open canned fruit 1 or 2 hours before using — it is 
far richer when the oxygen is restored to it. 

A curry comb makes an excellent fish scraper. 

Fold the whipped white of eggs into any mixture, 
rather than stir them in, as the latter method breaks the 
air cells.

operation and detail. 

Economy is manifested in the oven construction of 
the '*New Process'* Range as it is not necessary to 

heat the oven before bak- 
ing—put the baking in 
the oven, then light the 
fire and the baking itartt 
at once. 

Instead of a broad, flat 
fire underneath the cook- 
ing top, the "New Pro- 
cess" Rangei are equip- 
ped with burners which 
concentrate the heat on 
^ the center of the cooking 
vessel, spreading the fire 
across the bottom and 
, preventing any waste 
around the side— a fur- 
ther economy in Gas. 

Do not overlook the tani- 
tary features in your selection. 
"New Process^* Ranges are 
equipped with removable 
burners and linings, no tools 
necessary, dirt trasrs, broiler 
pan and door panels white 
enamel, finish perfectly plain 
and smooth, no dirt catcher of 
any Idnd- 

The " VisHU*' oven burner 

is an ezdusiTe ** Ntw Pro- 

ctss*' feature. It makes the 

operation of the range absolutely safe as the door must be opened to light the 

burner, also the fire can be regulated without opening the door. That means no 

unnecessary iarring of the oven, no waste of heat or variation of temperature. 

The No. 18-83 New Process'* Range shown in the cut is provided with 
large and small oven, six cooking burners. Broiling and Boiling compartment 
and hood. Our experience in the stove business is of long standing and before 
requesting and obtaining the exclusive sale of "New Process'* in Evanston all 
other lines were given careful consideration and our experience with this line 
has proven our judgment faultless. 

We cheerfully solicit a call from you for further particulars and prices.

COCIALLY speaking, good breed- 

^ intf and good salads are almost synonymous 

terms. One of the 
brightest club-women in 
America happily ex- 
pressed this idea when 
she wittily said: "In 
good society a woman 
is known, not by the 
company she keeps, 
but by the salads she 
serves/ ' Instinctively, 

the accomplighed hosteM 
puts forth her best effort in 
the preparation of a salad. 
She realizes that it is the true 
test of culinary competency. 
The dividing-line between a 
salad that is just ordinarily 
good, and one that has pre- 
cisely the proper tang, flavor, 
freshness and delicacy, is 
narrow and slender. 

It is conceded that nothing 
but the freshest and choicest 
ingredients should enter into 
a salad, but the very impor- 
tant fact that the success or 
failure, of any salad, lies in 
the dressing is often over- 
looked. 

In ** Yacht Club" you have 
the "perfect dressing." A 
combination of the finest in- 
gredients scientifically blend- 
ed. A uniformity of flavor 
and consistency obtainable in 
no other.
