"\\ e have here a siring of culinary ]>carls gathered 
from homes of personal friends and only the thread 

which binds them is our own." 

Rev. Baker P. Lee 



The aim of this work is to present to the public 
the best recipes of famous cooks, and to offer, in a 
condensed form, some timely suggestions in regard 
to the essentials which should be considered in pre- 
paring and serving a formal dinner or luncheon for 
a limited number of guests. 

The compilers of this little book sincerely hope 
that the recipes and other items of information con- 
tained therein may prove particularly helpful to the 
young housekeeper who. as the hostess of tomor- 
row, may wish to entertain her friends in a gracious, 
hospitable and up-to-date manner. 

To the many friends who have kindly contribu- 
ted to this work our thanks are due. We are also 
indebted to the following well-known authorities on 
the subject: "The Boston Cooking School Cook 
Hook." by Fannie Merritt Farmer; ''The Hostess of 
To-Day," by Linda Hall Lamed, and "Social Cus- 
toms," by Florence Howe Hall (1 ( )11). 



Serving Dinner 



"There is an emanation from the heart in gen- 
uine hospitality which cannot be described, but is 
immediately felt and puts the stranger at once at 
his ease." Washington Irving. 

Artistic table appointments are now within the 
reach of all, and our young hostess, after giving 
strict attention to a few very important details in 
the preparation of her table, may add, according to 
her taste and ingenuity, many of the pretty trifles 
for special events which will delight the eye of 
her guests, and give the required touch of senti- 
ment to the occasion. 

The Table 

On a table of any desired shape place either an 
asbestos pad, now in use for- this purpose, or an 
under cloth of white heavy Canton flannel. On 
this lay with great care a spotless, unwrinkled 
cover of linen or satin damask, of sufficient size 
to allow for a fall of at least eighteen inches from 
the sides of the table. 

The Centerpiece 

As artistic simplicity is the fashion of the 
moment, the centerpiece should not be too elab- 
orate. One of fine, washable material, daintily em- 
broidered or trimmed with lace, is most in favor at 
the present time. When a low broad floral design is 
used, the centerpiece is generally omitted, as a 
more tasteful effect is produced when the flower ar- 
rangement conies in direct contact with the sur- 
face of the smooth damask tablecloth. 



6 TRIED AND TRUE 

Decorations 

The floral decoration is a matter of individual 
taste. The hostess must remember, however, that 
all flower pieces should be kept either above or 
below the eye line, so as not to interfere with the 
view of her guests. Smaller bouquets harmoniz- 
ing with the central design are often used on the 
sides or corners of the table with pretty effect, and 
a pleasing act of courtesy is to place a single flower 
at the plate of each guest. "In the decoration of 
the table avoid ostentation and beware of furbe- 
lows." writes Linda Hall Lamed in "The Hostess 
of To-day." "A bowl of glass or silver and vases 
rilled with an artistic arrangement of flowers and 
vines are a sufficient embellishment for the most 
elaborate feast." 

Lighting the Table 

As the shadows thrown from ceiling lights 
would be trying to the eyes and unbecoming to 
the faces of many guests, the thoughtful hostess 
will illumine her table with white wax candles, or 
small lamps with prettily tinted shades. Many 
beautiful and artistic effects are now produced by 
the use of tiny electric bulbs, partly concealed in 
beds of flowers or in the green of the ivy, the 
smilax, or the asparagus fern. If it is necessary 
to supplement the illumination of the table, it is 
done by the use of side lights arranged on the walls 
of the dining room. 

The Covers 

The places or "covers" laid for guests should 
be twenty inches or more apart, and a large plate, 
called the "service" plate, put in the center of 
each cover. 

I* or a dinner served in courses the knives, forks. 
and spoons which will be needed before dessert 



TRIED AND TRUE 7 

should be placed on the table in the following or- 
der: Beginning at the extreme right of the ser- 
vice plate lay the oyster fork or the small fork for 
the canape ; then the spoon for soup, with the in- 
side of the bowl turned up; and next to that, if 
needed, a knife for fish ; and then a larger one for 
the roast. If the silver for dessert is put on the 
table from the beginning, the dessert knife should 
be next the plate; if otherwise, the meat knife is 
the last in order, all having their sharp edges turned 
towards the plate. The forks are also placed in 
the order in which they will be needed before the 
dessert comes. The fish fork is put at the extreme 
left of the service plate, then the entree fork, then 
the large fork for roast, and next to the plate (un- 
less one for dessert is on the table) the one for the 
game or salad, all with their tines turned upward. 
It is now thought in better form to have the silver 
for the dessert, and any extra course, brought from 
the sideboard and quietly laid at each plate. 

Dinner napkins should be large, folded simply, 
square or otherwise, and placed on the service plate, 
unless the first course, a cold one. has been put on 
the table before announcing dinner. In that event 
the napkin is laid at the left of the forks. 

It has long been the custom at dinners to slip a 
roll, breadstick. or small piece of bread in the fold of 
the napkin. At formal affairs the bread is mm 
passed from the sideboard, or serving table; but this 
is an unimportant detail which the hostess may 
decide for herself. 

Olives, celery and other relishes in their artistic 
dishes of decorative china are now placed on the 
serving table, and even the pretty fashion of hav- 
ing the bon bons and sweetmeats on the table 
at formal dinner parties is on the wane and these 



8 TRIED AND TRUE 

delicacies in their receptacles of glass and silver 
are now generally passed from the sideboard. 

The goblet for water should be at the right and 
quite near the center of the plate. If wine is to be 
served the glasses are put on the table in the order 
required by the courses, the last one reaching nearly 
to the space occupied by the goblet. 

Oil, vinegar and mustard are never put on the 
table at formal dinners, but quaint little silver salt 
and pepper holders may find a place on the sides 
and at the corners of the table. Individual salt 
cellars with tiny spoons to use with them are much 
in favor at the present time. 

Butter plates are no longer used at company din- 
ners. If a certain course calls for the use of butter 
it is served on small plates and removed with that 
particular course. 

Serving the Dinner 

Snow-white linen, glittering glass, shining silver, 
softly shaded lights and artistically arranged flowers 
are necessary to the success of a company dinner, 
and these essentials will not be overlooked by the 
careful hostess. 

The preparation of the food and the process of 
serving the same in the easiest and quietest manner 
are matters which must be entrusted largely to other 
hands. But the hostess has the privilege of decid- 
ing which of certain methods, equally good and up- 
to-date, will best suit her own convenience and 
accord with the resources at her command. 

If she decides on the formal plan of serving 
from the pantry, the butler or waitress will be in- 
structed to that effect. The courses, in their order, 
will be carefully arranged on individual plates, then 
placed on a tray and served to the guest at his right, 
with the right hand. There should always be a plate 



TRIED AND TRUE 9 

in front of the guest until the dessert. The service 
plate remains on the table until after the soup or 
bouillon is served when it is removed with that 
course and a plate containing the fish substituted. 
The entree follows the fish, the meat course comes 
next and lastly, the game or, if preferred, the salad 
course. 

Whatever accompanies these courses, wine ex- 
ceptecl. should be placed on a tray and passed at 
the left of the guest. This follows the simple rule 
that whatever the waitress puts upon the table with 
her own hand is placed at the right. Whenever 
the guest is to help himself the tray is passed at 
his left. 

The waitress removes the plates from the right 
with the left hand. If there are two waitresses, or 
two men, the guests should be served in rotation, 
beginning alternately at the right and left of the 
host and hostess ; if otherwise, the lady at the right 
of the host and the guest of honor should be the one 
first served ; then the other ladies in the order in 
which they sit. 

The gentlemen are then helped, the host always 
receiving his plate last. The table, when cleared 
for dessert, should be softly smoothed with a folded 
napkin, using a silver tray or a plate to receive 
the crumbs. The finger bowls, partly filled with 
water may have a daintily scented flower floating 
upon the surface. After the dessert courses which 
include puddings, ice cream, toasted crackers, 
cheese and fruit, the hostess will serve either at 
the table or in the drawing-room, strong black coffee 
and, if desired, a cordial. The coffee is handed 
around in dainty cups on a salver, with cream and 
sugar for those who wish for these accompaniments. 
The cordial, in tiny glasses, is also passed around on 
a silver salver. 



10 TRIED AND TRUE 

Second Method 

"When a somewhat less formal method is pre- 
ferred, the meat is cut in the pantry or kitchen, 
neatly arranged on a large platter which is then 
placed on a folded napkin laid on the flat of the 
hand, taken to the diningroom and passed to the 
guest at his left. With the large knife, fork and 
spoon resting on the platter he helps himself to a 
portion. The meat and every other course should 
be immediately followed by the accompaniments. 
The vegetable is placed on the plate with the meat, 
separate dishes not being considered in good form 
at present. The plate removed with the course 
is taken from the right with the left hand and an 
empty plate substituted with the right hand. A 
salad may be served with the game course, or the 
game omitted and the salad used as a course by 
itself. 

When ice cream is the chosen dainty for des- 
sert, several slices should be cut from the large 
mold and the platter containing them passed to the 
guest (at his left) who. removing the doily and the 
napkin from the dessert plate, places his portion 
thereon. 

Fruit, coffee and cordials are served in the same 
manner as in the formal dinner. 

\\ hen a party is given for more than six or 
eight people and either one of these two methods 
is adopted for serving, an assistant waitress is a 
necessity in order to avoid delay and confusion, and 
to enable the hostess to maintain the peace of mind 
which will insure to her guests the social enjoy- 
ment they have reason to expect. 

Third Method 

A less elaborate but equally hospitable and up- 
to-date dinner may be given" by omitting a few 



TRIED AND TRUE 11 

of the more unimportant courses and placing the 
large course of meat or fowl in front of the host, 
who does the carving. 

The dessert course and often the coifee are 
prepared for serving by the hosress at "the table. 
One competent waitress is all that is necessary, the 
same rule of "right and left" and substitution being 
followed as in the more formal affairs. 

The number of guests should not be too largo. 
( Mrs. Florence Howe Hall, in "Social Customs. " 
quotes from lirillat-Savarin, to the effect that the 
number of people should not be less than the Graces 
nor more than the Muses. 

On entering the dining room the host takes in 
the lady in whose honor the dinner is given the 
others following in the order previously arranged 
for by the hostess, who with the gentleman of honor 
is the last to enter. All stand until the hostess is 
seated. 

Place Cards 

The place card should be in the present fashion 
unless the affair is in honor of an anniversary or a 
special event when other cards are in perfectly good 
taste. Place a card on each napkin. Menu cards 
are never used at private dinners or luncheons. 

Wines 

"Sherry is the proper wine to accompany soup. 
Chables, hock or sauterne goes with the fish course. 
claret and champagne with the roast. If Madeira 
and port are used they should come after the game. 
Sherry and claret or Burgundy are again offered 
with the dessert. For a small dinner it is nuite suf- 
ficient to have two or three wines; in this case, 
sherry with the soup, and claret or champagne with 
the roast, would be the best selection."

the size of a dollar and replace with prepared timbale 
of foie gras in aspic. 

Decorate plate with fine chopped lettuce and

Cream of Tomato 

" Cut some carrots, onions and celery and braize 
with ham bones in butter: add about a dozen to- 
matoes. Cook thoroughly, pass through a fine sieve, 
and add some cream. Season with salt and pepper 
and thicken with arrow root suiting taste. 

It would be well to serve soup in cups for dinner 
of this sort, with a little whipped cream on top. 

Crab Legs Papillote, Alexandria 
Take a large piece of brown wrapping paper, cut 
same size of plate and fold once. Grease thoroughly 
with Maitre d Hotel butter, and place a slice of 
cooked ham on one side. Add butter, lemon juice. 
paprika, salt, pepper and chives. Then lay the crab 
legs on top. Fold paper making same air tight, put 
in roasting pan and let cook about twelve or fifteen 
minutes until paper gets brown and bag expands. 

Crab legs must be served right away with a little 
drawn butter. 

Sand dabs may be served in a like manner if pre- 
ferred. 

Sweetbread, Alexandria 
Take nice young calf's sweetbreads, cooked, cut

in large pieces ; fry a little in butter and do the same 
with fresh mushrooms. Season same well with pap- 
rika, salt and pepper. Mix sweetbreads and mush- 
rooms together and add a little cream sauce, also 
add a little more butter and plain or whipping cream. 
Cook about fifteen minutes. 

These may be served in ramikins. 

Sorbet 

Is proper to serve between entree and roast, as it 
freshens the palate and removes the flavor of prev- 
ious course. 

Breast of Chicken, Alexandria 

Bone a small uncooked chicken weighing about 
one and one quarter Ibs. Remove the meat of the 
legs, grind same fine, season with salt and pepper, 
add a little cream and sherry wine, mix thoroughly 
and stuff the breast with same. Place a slice of salt 
pork over this and roast in hot oven for about fifteen 
minutes. 

Serve in potato nest with a little jelly. 

Salad Alexandria 

Select two nice, tender, fresh celery sticks, one 
good sized, juicy table apple, and a fresh Hawaiian 
pineapple, cut all Julienne. Take equal parts of 
each and put in ice water, cooling well. 

Take teacup of whipping cream, add one dessert 
spoon of powdered sugar, three English walnuts, 
chopped very fine, one cordial glass of Kirchwasser, 
and mix well. Strain water off sliced fruit so that it 
is perfectly dry. Take prepared whipping cream as 
a dressing and mix thoroughly and carefully to avoid 
crushing the fruit.

Shelley. 

A party luncheon is less ceremonious than a din- 
ner, therefore quite as enjoyable. It may be a very 
simple "informal" or an extremely elaborate affair. 
l>ut whether few or many, the courses for luncheon 
are always more delicate and fanciful in character 
than are those provided for a substantial dinner. 
In general, however, a formal luncheon party differs 
little from a dinner. The dishes are brought from 
the serving-table and handed around by the servants. 
The silver, glass and china are as bright, dainty 
and beautiful and with few exceptions used for the 
same purpose and in the same way as at a dinner. 
In arranging the "courses" for luncheon the spoons 
are sometimes put in front of the plate. Soup or 
bouillon is usually served in two-handled cups with 
saucers. 

The table, when a suitable one, is left bare and 
handsome doilies with centerpiece to match are 
placed on the surface. The tablecloth, when pre- 
ferred, may be of fine white damask or of exquisite 
drawn work and heavy lace. The napkins, whether 
plain or decorated, should not be too large. 

The flower decorations, while profuse, should be 
simply but artistically arranged. The lights are 
usually omitted at a luncheon. 



18 TRIED AND TRUE 

The lighter wines are often served but many hos- 
tesses now prefer the fruit, wine and tea punches 
which are poured from handsome glass pitchers dur- 
ing the courses. 

In this country finger bowls are used at luncheon 
as they are at dinner. 

If the occasion is a formal one. the coffee and 
cordial are handed around in the drawing-room. 

Upon small cards, either plain or with simple 
decorations, write the names of the guests, and place 
a card on each napkin. At small luncheons these 
cards are not needed. 

The hostess leads the way into the dining-room 
and the guests go in separately, the ladies first and 
the gentlemen following.

whip for five minutes. Remove it from the fire and 
immediately put the basin into a vessel .containing 
ice water and stir continually for two minutes more. 
Add a pint and a half of whipped cream, with vanilla 
flavor, and mix well with the rest for three minutes. 
Then cover the basin with a napkin and let repose for 
ten minutes. Have twelve paper cases two inches 
long, two inches wide and one and a half inch high, 
and fill equally with the above preparation. Have 
ready a square biscuit glace box ten inches high by 
six inches square, and having inside loose two tier 
frame; place this box in an ice-cream tub. filling it 
with broken ice mixed with rock salt. 

Wipe the cover neatly and after lifting it up re- 
move the frame and place three biscuits on each 
tier ; return the frame to the box, put the cover on 
and let freeze for one and a half hours. Have a 
cold dessert dish covered with folded napkin; remove 
the box, lift up the frame and dress the biscuit 
nicely on the dish, sending them to the table at once.

should he cleaned and tied in a piece of cheesecloth 
to prevent scum being deposited on the fish. Time 
required for boiling depends on thickness of fish 
or pieces twenty minutes or longer.

Country Club Chicken Pie 

l)oil a large chicken until very tender, remove the 
large bones and pull into uniform pieces. Put into 
large baking pan (in which you can serve it), thick- 
en the liquor in the kettle (a half cup of flour with 
one cup of milk would be sufficient). If it is not 
rich add butter. Have plenty of gravy. Cut four 
hard-boiled eggs into eighths, and put over the 
chicken ; pour on the gravy. 

Mix two cups flour, salt, two teaspoons baking 
powder, one heaping tablespoon soft lard or butter; 
add one cup of milk, make into a soft batter. Have 
the pan of chicken boiling gently. Put the batter 
on top by small spoonfuls rather close together. 
P>ake in a hot oven twenty minutes, as you would

when the batter is put on top. 

This is an excellent way to utilize the remains

Virginia Ham 

Select a good ham (one that is country cured 
or a Smithfield preferred). Place in a weak solu- 
tion of salt water to soak overnight. In the morn- 
ing put it in enough fresh water to cover and sim- 
mer nine hours. The ham must never boil; that 
is the secret of the success of this recipe. When 
it is done remove vessel from the stove and leave 
ham to cool in the water in which it has cooked. 
The following morning skin it, pour over a little 
wine, sprinkle with fine bread crumbs and sugar 
and bake a delicate brown. This recipe has been

1 cup sugar powder 

1/-2 cups water Milk to mix 

Salt to taste 2 cups flour

half cooked. 

To cover: Add the baking powder and salt to 
the flour, and run the mixture through the sieve 
three times. Rub the butter into the flour as for 
biscuits. Add milk to make a stiff batter and lay it 
in kettle over the apples with a spoon. Cover the

the kettle where there will be no danger of burning 
the apples, and let steam twenty minutes without 
removing the lid. 

When serving: Take with a spoon a portion of

Directions for Making 

Prepare the day before all the fruit and almonds 
by cutting in small pieces. Place each separately on 
plates. Dredge well with flour so it will not stick 
together. In the morning early, cream sugar and 
butter thoroughly until very light. Then add yolks 
of eggs which have first been beaten light. Beat all 
together, then add flour which should have been 
sifted several times with the baking powder 
through it. After this has been thoroughly beaten 
begin by adding fruit, one kind at a time, first hav- 
ing shaken off loose flour from fruit in a colander. 
Whatever flour sticks to the fruit is needed. If one 
has a bread mixer it will make the mixing easier : 
otherwise it must be done with the hand. After add- 
ing all the fruit add brandy, then at the very last 
the whites of eggs beaten to a stiff froth. This is to 
be done very carefully. 

. Have pan lined with well buttered paper. Put

oven hot enough for baking bread with a good clear 
fire that will last till cake is done. If it should start 
to brown too soon, set a pan on top of cake pan half 
filled with water and do not disturb for fully four 
hours. Then watch baking for the next two hours, 
that it may not scorch or burn. It should not have 
much crust, and if properly done the fruit will not 
taste cooked. Can be kept indefinitely in pan in 
which baked if covered with other pan. This cake 
recipe can be divided. Makes very large cake.

relieves hoarseness. Take one teaspoonful every

Sandwiches 

"Bachelor's fare: bread and cheese and kisses." 

Swift. 

In preparing bread for sandwiches, cut slices as 
thin as possible and remove crusts. If butter is used, 
cream the butter and spread bread before cutting 
from loaf. Spread half the slices with mixture to be 
used for filling, cover with remaining pieces and cut 
in squares, oblongs or triangles. If sandwiches are 
shaped with round or fancy cutters, bread should be 
shaped before spreading, that there may be no waste 
of butter. Sandwiches which are prepared several 
hours before serving time may be kept fresh and 
moist by wrapping in a napkin wrung as dry as pos- 
sible out of hot water and keeping in a cool place. 
Paraffine paper is often used for the same purpose. 
Bread for sandwiches cuts better when a day old.

competitors from Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky. 
Mrs. Rebecca Thompson. 

Recipe for Fruit Jellies 

Pare and core fruit such as apple or quince cut 
into pieces, eights or whatever size desired ; place in 
your kettle, barely covering with water ; place the 
cover on the kettle and allow the fruit to boil until 
tender. Then turn into your jelly bag and suspend 
it so that it may drip all night if necessary, but do 
not press or squeeze the bag. Two and a half or 
three pints of juice at one time is the quantity most 
successful in making fine jellies. To that amount 
of juice add one pint of good clear water, and set the 
kettle to boil for twenty minutes. This boiling will 
clarify the juice, and the added water will be boiled 
away, leaving the original amount of juice much 
clarified, without having a strong taste or a darker 
color. Strain through a muslin cloth ; then measure 
the juice, and to each pint add a pint of sugar; stir 
until fairly well dissolved ; set over the fire and let 
boil for fifteen or twenty minutes trying it fre- 
quently by allowing it to drip from the end of the 
spoon. When it hangs in a long mass from the 
spoon, it is sufficiently boiled. To remove the scum, 



TRIED AND TRUE 145 

my most successful plan was to tie a muslin cloth 
over the top of a half gallon pitcher and pour the 
jelly through it, thus removing the scum, beside 
having the jelly in a convenient vessel from which 
to fill the glasses. 

All jellies are made under the same general di- 
rections. When the fruit is not so rich in jelly (as 
in grapes), use a little less sugar, and where it is 
very rich in jelly (as in cranberries) use a little 
more sugar to the pint of juice.

For Cleaning White or Light Wool Suits 

Take a pan with dry corn meal. Rub the meal 
into the goods as though washing. When well gone 
over in this manner, brush thoroughly. The ma- 
terial will then look quite fresh and clean. Should 
there be bad grease spots, leave the meal on the 
goods twenty-four hours, or dampen the cornmeal 
just a little and leave for a day. Then rub well and 
brush out the meal. You will be pleased to find the 
grease spots have disappeared leaving no circle as 
when fluids are used. I have known axle grease taken 
from a beautiful light cloth suit in this manner.

terest you. Our prices
