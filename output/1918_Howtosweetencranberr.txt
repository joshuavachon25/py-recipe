How to Sweeten Cranberries 

Cranberries are now in the markets. They find a ready place on 
the table. They always are associated with Thanksgiving and 
Christmas dinners. This year the scarcity of sugar may cause many 
to hesitate to use them. Cranberries may be served without empty- 
ing your sugar bowl. 

Because of the acid content of cranberries, sweeteners such as sor- 
ghum, cane or corn sirup may be used even more successfully than 
with other fruits. Cranberries may be combined with other fruits 
which are sweet, such as apples, figs, and raisins, either to extend or 
modify the cranberry flavor or to add sweetness to it. 

Cranberries are a valuable food because of the iron and acid they 
contain. Many like the acid flavor while others acquire a taste for it. 
The recipes suggested use sugar savers.
