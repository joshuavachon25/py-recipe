Shredded Wheat Dishes 

A dainty, wholesome, appetizing meal can be prepared with 
Shredded Wheat Biscuit "in a jiffy." It is ready-cooked and ready- 
to-serve. You can do things with it that are not possible with any 
other "breakfast food." It is the only cereal food made in Biscuit 
form. It is delicious when combined with berries, sliced bananas, 
baked apples, stewed prunes or other fresh or preserved fruits. 

For breakfast heat the Bis- 
cuit in the oven to restore 
crispness. Pour over it hot 
milk, adding a little cream and 
a dash of salt. Triscuit, the 
Shredded Wheat Wafer, is 
^i p> eaten as a toast for luncheon 

or any other meal with butter, 
cheese or marmalades. Our 
new book, "Shredded Wheat 
Dishes," is sent free for the 
asking.

PREFACE 

The Peoria Women's Cook Book has been compiled and published 
by the young women of this society in order to raise funds for our pledge 
to the new Church enterprise. 

An attempt has been made to secure recipes from as many as possible 
of Peoria's representative women. It is a matter of regret that many choice 
recipes have been unavoidably ommitted for lack of space and others on 
account of similarity to those already received. 

Among the recipes are a number of originals which have not hereto- 
fore been published. All have been tested and recommended by those 
whose names are signed. 

The compilers express their appreciation to those who have contributed 
material; to all others who have given of their time to help make the book 
possible. 

We recommend for patronage the professional men, manufacturers and 
business men whose advertisements appear and suggest that in dealing with 
them this book be mentioned.

SOUPS 

Muse, sing the man who did to Paris go, 

That he might taste their soups and mushrooms know. — W. King. 



SOUP STOCK. 

To each quart of cold water allow one pound of meat and bone 
in about equal proportions; one pint of cleaned vegetables, such as carrot, 
onion, celery, etc., cut in pieces; one bunch of soup herbs, being a sprig 
of parsley, two bay leaves, and any dry herbs of which the flavor is desired; 
seasoning of salt and pepper to taste, together with a little celery seed if 
fresh celery is not in season. 

Wipe the meat, and cut into small pieces, chop the bones, and add, 
together with the vegetables and soup herbs. Pour the water, which must 
be cold, over them, and bring very slowly to the boiling point ; skim if neces- 
sary, and cook slowly for six hours, keeping the stock-pot closely covered. 
Then strain the stock and leave uncovered in a cool place till cold. Then 
remove the fat. Do not allow it to stand in the stock-pot. 



CONSOMME. 
1 lb. knuckle of veal. 1 lb. knuckle of beef. 

5 or 6 cups water. 

Wash and wipe meat. Cut all meat into small dice, break the bones, 
add the water, and let stand 1 hour. Put on fire and let simmer 3 hours, 
or put in fireless cooker over night. Remove from fire, strain, let stand until 
fat hardens, remove fat, season, clear, reheat, and serve. Clear by allow- 
ing a white and shell of one egg to each quart of stock. Beat egg slightly, 
break shell in small pieces and add to stock. Place on fire and stir con- 
stantly until boiling. Boil 2 minutes. Set back where it can simmer 5 
minutes. Remove scum and strain thru two thickness of cheesecloth placed 
over a small strainer. — Mrs. Moorehead.

10 PEORIA WOMEN'S COOK BOOK 

POTATO SOUP. 
Three medium sized potatoes, washed, pared and cooked in salt water. 
Drain, rub through strainer. Make a thin white sauce in double boiler of 
one pint milk, 1 tablespoon flour, 2 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon minced 
onion, 1 teaspoon salt, few grains of pepper, cook 1 minutes, add one-half 
teaspoon celery salt. Mix this with strained potatoes. 

Mrs. E. F. Washburn. 



CREAM OF TOMATO SOUP FOR FOUR. 
Tomato Puree, 1 cup, 1 teaspoon butter, size of walnut. 

Milk, 3 cups, Salt and pepper to taste. 

Flour 

Cream the flour until smooth and stir into milk. Boil milk and tomato 
in separate pans and when both are boiling hot, pour the milk into the 
tomato. Add butter, salt and pepper. One or two cubes of Boullion 
improves the flavor of this soup. — Mrs. W. B. Short. 



CREAM CORN SOUP. 
1 can of corn, 1 very small onion, 

1 quart of milk, celery tops. 

Cook all together in a double boiler for Yl hour. Press through 
sieve to get all the pulp possible. 

Rub together 1 tablespoon butter and a tablespoon of flour. Add 
this to milk and reheat. When ready to serve add salt and white pepper to 
taste. Put one or two shredded blanched almonds in bottom of soup dish, 
and on top of soup some whipped cream. A small piece of pimento on 
top of the cream adds to the attractiveness of the dish. 

Mrs. Wilson Oakford. 



CREAM OF SALSIFY SOUR 
Cook two cups of cleaned diced salsify root, a medium sized onion 
sliced, a stalk of celery and a  sprig of parsley in a quart of water until 
tender. Drain and press through sieve. Prepare one pint of white sauce 
for every cup of the puree. Make the white sauce from two tablespoons 
each of butter and flour, half a teaspoon of salt and a salt spoon of pepper 
and one pint of milk; add the puree, one cup of milk and one cup of liquid 
drained from the salsify, and season to taste. This is a fine soup to serve 
with a turkey dinner. Its flavor is more delicate than that of the real 
oyster. — Mrs. M. L. Fuller. 



PEORIA WOMEN'S COOK BOOK 11 

CELERY SOUP. 

1 cup diced celery, 

2 cups water. 

Boil until tender. Make a white sauce of 1 cup milk, 1 tablespoon 
flour, I tablespoon butter. Add celery. Serve hot. — Mrs. Moorehead. 



CREAM OF PEA SOUP. 
I can of peas, 1 qt. of milk, 

1 pt. boiling water, 1 teaspoon of butter, 

2 heaping teaspoons of cornstarch, Ya teaspoon of beef extract. 

Salt, pepper, onion juice or a little grated onion. Mash half the peas, 
heat all with the liquor. Put other ingredients in double boiler, mix in corn- 
starch with a little cold milk. Cook a few minutes, then add peas. Serve 
at once. — Mrs. Ruth Beach Howes. 



CREAM OF ASPARAGUS SOUP. 
For making two quarts of soup, use two bundles of fresh asparagus 
cut the tops from one of the bunches and cook them twenty minutes in 
salted water, enough to cover them. Cook the remainder of the asparagus 
about twenty minutes in a quart of stock or water. Cut one onion into thin 
slices and fry in three tablespoons of butter ten minutes, being careful not 
to scorch it. Then add the asparagus that has been boiled in the stock, 
cook this five minutes, stirring constantly; then add one tablespoon of dis- 
solved flour and cook five minutes longer. Turn this mixture into the 
boiling stock and boil twenty minutes. Rub through a sieve, add the cream 
and milk and the asparagus heads. If water is used in place of stock, 
use all cream. — Mrs. I. J. Stanley. 



CREAM OF VEGETABLE SOUP. 
For our soup we have quite a few leftovers. A spoonful of potatoes, a 
half cup of the different soups, a little cabbage, some gravy, put them all 
into a small saucepan. Any little left over meat can be used. Add two 
cups of hot water, a little onion juice and heat through; rub one teaspoon 
of butter with one teaspoon of flour until smooth and add to the soup. You 
can strain and mash through strainer and serve in cups, or leave all the 
vegetables in and add one teaspoon of chopped parsley and serve in plates.

TO BAKE FISH. 
Have the fish well washed, and if it is haddock, small cod or any small

with a cloth or small brush dipped in salt. Dry and lay either flat or fasten- 
ed with thread or skewers in the form of the letter "S", in a well-greased 
taking pan, preferably one kept for the purpose; dredge with flour and put 
a little dripping or brown fat over the top. If the oven is very hot, cover 
the fish with a greased paper during the first part of the baking to prevent its 
becoming too brown. Baste frequently with the fat that is in the pan, 
adding more if needed. Unless the fish is well basted it is likely to be dry. 
Serve with a sauce or gravy. — Mrs. J. H. Stephenson, Danvers, III.

HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR CAKE 



IT IS INTERESTING- 
READ IT! 



The excellence of a cake depends upon its lightness, texture, color and 
taste. 

Cake is made light by the enlargement of the cells in the cake batter and 
this is accomplished in two ways. First, by the expansion of air when heated jj 
during baking. The cool air in the batter is enclosed by the beating of the 
batter, or the eggs. The expanding of the enclosed air bubbles puffs up and 
expands the batter: the heat also bakes the cake, making the walls of the 
cells rigid, so that they retain the structure of a sponge. 

The other method of enlarging the cells of the cake batter is by the evolution || 
of carbon dioxide, a harmless gas which fills the cells and expands when heated 
during the baking of the cake. Carbon dioxide is the gas in the bubbles given 
off by baking powder when it is wet and heated. The action of cream of tartar 
on soda also gives off carbon dioxide. 

This lightness of a cake is greatly affected by the kind of flour used. Flour 
not made expressly for use in cake baking is rich in gluten, an excellent quality 
for bread, but detrimental for cake baking. Gluten is a tough, rubbery substance 
that makes difficult the expansion of the cake batter, because the heated air, 
or evolved gas bubbles, are not active enough to overcome this strong rubbery 
gluten. This prevents the cake having a fine grained texture, that is fluffy and light. 

Flour with a yellowish or grayish color does not give that beautiful and 
creamy white color that goes far towards making a cake more palatable. Bread 
flours have this fault. 

The delicacy of taste and flavor is an extremely important factor, for the 
dainty quality of a cake must not be dominated by the use of a strong and 
coarse flour. 

Swans Down Cake Flour is a special preparation of those elements taken 
from selected wheat that go to make a flour which gives the best of results 
in cake and pastry baking. 

The proportion of gluten in Swans Down Cake Flour is small and it is of 
extremely fine and tender quality. The eggs and butter and sugar used in 
a cake more than make up for the low gluten content, so far as the nutriment 
value is concerned. 

It is best to have a special flour for cake baking. Swans Down Cake Flour 
is the best we can make and we have made the best of flour for over a half 
century.

Takes Only a Little, But— Oh Myt 

It don't take a lot, but It certainly does 
a lot. A little goes a Ions way, especially 
If spices are pure and come to you with 
all their original strength and flavor. 
Good cooks take supreme delight In 
putting In the spice— It's the one last

S. Good Tea and Coffee 

It isn't an easy matter to secure the 
right teas or coffees to make a good cup 
for the table. Therefore we employ a 
tea and coffee expert who does nothing 
but superintend the selecting, blending, 
roasting and tasting of these goods. 
That he knows his business thor- 
oughly is proven by the ever growing 
popularity of our different brands of 
teas and coffees. 




Sunset Brand Hour 

We sold three times as much flour during 
January and February of this year as we did 
during the whole year of 1914. Low price ( 
alone would not have caused such won- 
derful sales. You know that you wouldn't 
buy another sack of flour 
that didn't give good re- 
sults no matter now low 
the price. Nothing Is 
quite so satisfying as to 
turn out a batch of white, 
light bread. Sunset 
Brand flour will do it.

Whether In mid-season, whether early

mlRhty good thing to eat. Really_ fresh 
fruits are good and have a place in the 
diet, but dried fruits should be eaten 
freely, especially in the Spring of the

"There's gold, go forth and be a knight!"— Ben Johnson. 



CANNING. 

To can fruit, one-fourth to one-third is the most common quantity of 
sugar used. In jelly making three-fourths to equal parts may be required, 
according to the acidity of the fruit. 

To keep juice from spoiling, use new rubbers, sterilize all jars, covers, 
rubbers, spoons, etc., and cover all jars while contents are still boiling hot. 

Canned fruits are richer if cooked in a syrup instead of in water, 
to which sugar is added to form a syrup after the fruit is cooked.

Cook 6 pounds of fruit to this amount until fruit is tender. Can while hot.

and heat gradually. Boil 20 minutes, pack in jars and seal while hot. To

well again with water and boil 30 minutes. Drain and season to taste 
with butter and cream. — Mrs. A. E. Giles.

pound of sugar, strain the lemon juice and mash the raspberries through a 
coarse sieve, then the pineapple, and mix all together, adding three quarts 
of cold water. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, strain and serve with a 
little of the fruit in each glass. — Mrs. I. J. Stanley. 



THE PERFECTION OF LEMONADE. 
For a quart take the juice of 3 lemons and the rind of one. Peel 
the rind very thin, using only the yellow outside cut in small pieces and put 
with the juice and powdered sugar, of which use 2 oz. to the qt. in a jar 
with cover. When the water is at boiling point pour it over the lemon and 
sugar, cover and let get cold. — Misses S. and E. Benton.

To one cup of milk allow 1 teaspoon of cocoa, and three of sugar. 
Let the milk almost come to a boil, add the cocoa and sugar which has been 
melted into a cream by dipping in two or three teaspoons of hot milk. Let 
come to a boil. A small lump of butter and a little vanilla adds to the 
taste. A small piece of marshmallow is good served on the top of each 
cup of cocoa instead of whipped cream. — Mrs. M. J. Grieves.

tract the juice of 5 dozen lemons. Cut in small pieces 2 cans pineapple.

COFFEE FOR SIX PERSONS. 
Take 1 full cup ground coffee, 1 egg, a little cold water, stir together, 
add 1 pint boiling water, boil up; then add another pint boiling water, and 
set back to settle before serving. 



TEA. 
Use two teaspoons of tea to a pint of water. Have the water freshly 
boiling, scald the teapot, put in the tea, and pour on boiling water in the 
proportion given. Cover, and keep in a warm place, but where the tea will 
not boil, for three to five minutes to draw. If it cannot be used at once, pour 
off the tea and discard the leaves. An earthen teapot is preferable. 



ICED TEA. 

Iced tea is made the same as the hot beverage and may be prepared 
some hours before using, the infusion being poured off the leaves as soon 
as the strength is extracted, then cooled and placed near the ice until required 
for use; or the tea may be made at the time of serving and chilled by the 
plentiful addition of cracked ice. The former is the most economical method. 
Iced tea should be taken clear and weaker than when served hot, and slices 
of lemon should be passed with it. 



CHOCOLATE. 
2 squares chocolate, Whipped cream, 

2 teaspoons sugar, 4 tablespoons cold water, 

3 cups milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla if desired. 

Put chocolate into a sauce pan or the inner part of a double boiler 
with the water and sugar; cook over a gentle heat until the chocolate is 
melted, add the milk gradually and bring to the boiling point. Beat until 
foamy, flavor with vanilla if liked and serve with a spoonful of whipped 
cream on top of each cup. — Mrs. O. P. Westervelt. 



DELICIOUS FRUIT PUNCH. 
Sweeten juice of eight lemons and put in orange to taste. Just before 
serving, place a square of ice in a punch bowl and pour over it sweetened 
juice, then add two quarts Apollinaris water or White Rock and garnish 
with a bunch of grapes laid on the ice. A gill of raspberry or blackberry 
juice left over from canned fruit adds a beautiful color to the punch as 
well as a fine flavor. — Mrs. V. P. Westervelt. 



MISCELLANEOUS 

Cookery is become an art. A noble science. —Robert Burton. 



SHREDDED WHEAT BISCUIT FOR BREAKFAST. 
Warm the biscuit in the oven to restore crispness, don't burn, pour hot 
milk over it, dipping the milk over it until the shreds are swollen; then 
pour a little cream over the top of the biscuit. Or, serve with cold milk or 
cream, according to individual taste. 



ANIMAL CRACKERS STANDING. 
A favorite luncheon for small children is made from a box of animal 
crackers, one of saltines, and a cup of pure maple syrup. Boil the syrup 
until it forms a soft ball when dropped in ice water, put a little on each 
saltine, and press an animal into this in a standing posture. May be served 
with milk.— Mrs. W. B. Reed. 



DREAM SANDWICHES. 
Cut slices of brick cheese about j/^ in thick. Put slices of cheese 
between two slices of bread and season the cheese with salt and a little 
cayenne, then place sandwich in gas range and let remain there until bread

add mayonnaise. Chopped dates seasoned with grated lemon peel and 
cloves or cinnamon. Sardines made to a paste with lemon juice. Cottage 
cheese mixed with cut olives. — Mrs. H. L. Clark. 



SALAD SANDWICHES.

pickles and pimento, which have been minced fine. Mix with ham and 
enough salad dressing to make it spread easily. Place lettuce leaf just 
before placing the top piece of bread. — Mrs. M. J. Grieves.
