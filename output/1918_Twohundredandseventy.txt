FOREWORD 

The following chapters suggest substitutions and 
economies and it is their purpose to enable one to 
obtain results without the waste of materials in 
experimental attempts in the home kitchen. 

Most of the recipes have been given to audiences 
on the slips used at demonstration lectures, but are 
here assembled for every day use. 

The recipes are not all original but have all been 
tested and in many cases slightly changed to meet 
personal methods and tastes. 



MEASUREMENTS 

Accurate measurements are necessary to insure 
success. 

Level measurements are always to be used. 

The cup should have the half, third and quarter 
marked on it. 

One-half spoonful should be taken lengthwise and 
not crosswise of the spoon. 

White flour should be sifted before measured, 
c — cup 

tbsp — tablespoonful 
tsp — teaspoonful 

All bread recipes are in quantity for one loaf, all 
muffins for 9 to 12 muffins, and all other quantities 
the amount needed for the average family of four 
adults. 



NOTE 
In some recipes detailed instructions as to the combination of 
ingredients have been omitted, especially to avoid repetitions. 
Where directions are not given and any special order is necessary 
to insure success, combine in given order, reading across each line. 
Example : Cream Salad Dressing, page 47. Into oil, stir four, 
salt, mustard, pepper and sugar. Add milk, then beaten egg and 
lastly, vinegar.

OUR PROBLEM 

At this critical time our country is called upon to 
supply food for her men in service, including soldiers 
in camps, sailors in the navy and all men * 'over-seas" 
as well as the people at home. Joined in the world 
war, we also have a duty towards our allies and many 
labor and transportation problems add to the serious- 
ness of the situation. 

OUR SOLUTION 

"True economy does not consist in going without 
but in making the most of what one has." 

Only through the most careful conservation of all 
food materials can we solve this problem and meet 
this demand. 

Conservation does not mean going without the 
necessities but by avoiding all wastes, practicing true 
economy and using substitutions, study and plan 
so that neither children nor adults become examples 
of mal-nutrition. A person's best asset is a well 
nourished body and a nation's asset a healthy people. 

As a nation we are asked to save the 

WHEAT 

MEATS 

FATS 

SUGAR 

We must use the foodstuffs that cannot be satis- 
factorily transported and release those which our 
ships can best carry and which can be most easily 
prepared in quantities. 

We have not primarily a financial problem but it is 
our patriotic obligation and it is the housekeepers' 
part in the war to join a volunteer army and rneet 
these demands, at the same time help to avoid rations 
or restricted diets and stabilize prices.

RELEASE WHEAT FLOUR 



"Urge everyone to lessen wheat consumption by at least one- 
third, through substitutions." — Food Administration. 

[ Use corn, rice, oats, barley, buckwheat and mixed cereal grains. 
Graham and entire wheat do not lessen wheat consumption much. 

The following recipes release wheat flour at least thirty per 
cent. In many families a larger proportion of substitution will 
be accepted but some wheat with its gluten content is necessary 
for best results in yeast breads and is legitimate as a "binder". 

Barley flour may be used for part of the wheat flour measure- 
ment when a greater release of wheat is desired and thus a fifty 
per cent substitution gained and good results assured in these 
recipes following this principle. 

Rice flour and white corn flour are also on the market. 



YEAST BREADS 
STANDARD YEAST BREAD 

1 c. liquid (J-'o c. milk and }4 c. water or 1 c. water) 
1 tbsp. shortening 1 tsp. salt 

}4 Fleischmann yeast cake 2 tbsp. sugar or molasses 

3 c. flour 

Mix liquid, shortening, molasses and salt. When 
this mixture is lukewarm, add yeast, dissolved in 
3^ c. lukewarm water, and lastly, the flour. Let rise 
to double its bulk and knead well. Shape into pan 
and when again double its bulk, bake 50 to 60 minutes. 
VARIATIONS 

For a sweeter bread, add another tablespoonful 
molasses or sugar. 

7 



The quantity of flour will vary slightly with 
different kinds. 

Add enough for stiff dough so that little more is 
needed when bread is handled and shaped for the 
pans.

ways, all the other ingredients as in standard recipe.

HOW TO RENDER FATS 

The trimmings and fats purchased with meats should 
always be saved and used. The fats obtained in cook- 
ing meats, especially chops, sausage and all waste 
must be utilized. 
TO RENDER FAT:— 

To render or "try out" fats, cut in small pieces. 
Place in a heavy pan in a slow oven and cook several 
hours. The use of the double boiler on top of range is 
often recommended and avoids any danger of burning 
but takes a longer time. When fat is melted and tissues 
or cracklings are crisp, strain fat through cheese cloth. 

To lessen strong flavors fat is rendered with equal 
parts of water and thus the flavor is washed out. Cool, 
and allow the fat to harden on top. Remove and re- 
serve for use. 
TO CLARIFY:— 

Fresh fats will be clarified as rendered but when not 
fresh, or very strong, or mixed kinds are used, a few 
slices of raw potato may be added. The most satis- 
factory method is to use 1 c skimmed milk to 2 lbs fat 
in place of the water suggested above. 
BLENDED FATS:— 

Often home rendered fats are two hard to be of the 
best consistency for shortening. Then blending is 
recommended. 

1. Melt 1 c beef or mutton drippings with 3^ c lard 
or similar commercial fat. 

2. Melt 1 3^ c beef or mutton fat with 3^ cooking 
oil. In either method mix thoroughly and cool, stirring 
occasionally to avoid separation. 

TO EXTEND FAT FLAVORS:— 

When butter substitutes are used in soups, sauces, 
vegetables or other hot dishes, the characteristic flavor 
of butter may often be obtained if a small amount is 
added just before serving. 

63 



HOW TO MAKE SOAP 

5 lbs. lukewarm, clarified grease 1 lb can lye 
3 pts cold water }/i c ammonia 

yi c powdered borax 3^ c sal soda 

Fats unfit for food or frying purposes may be clarified 
and used for soap. Dissolve lye and sal soda in cold 
water over night. When cold, slowly add the melted 
fat, stirring constantly. Best results are obtained if 
fat is strained through cheesecloth. 

Dissolve borax in J c cold water and add with 
ammonia to first mixture. Stir until about as thick as 
molasses, which will be about 20 or 30 minutes. Pour 
into paste board boxes lined with heavy paper. Cut 
in pieces before it is two hard and store until well dried. 
This makes 8 lbs. of soap. 

NOTE : — The sal soda m.akes a more cleansing soap 
also softens the water and therefore yields more suds. 
The Ammonia and Borax may be increased to 3^ c 
each with good results. 

HOW TO PRESERVE EGGS 

During April and May, when eggs are reasonable in 
price, the thrifty housekeeper may preserve them to 
be used for cooking purposes during the winter months 
when eggs are double in price. 

9 qts. of boiled and cooled water. 

1 qt. of water glass. 

15 doz. absolutely fresh eggs. 

5 gal. jar or crock with tight fitting cover. 

Handle eggs carefully to avoid cracking. The 
liquids should be mixed in this proportion and the eggs 
may be added from time to time as they are obtained. 
Eggs may be removed for use at any time. 

Water glass or silicate of sodium may be purchased 
at many grocery stores, some drug stores, and chemical 
companies. 

64 



COLD PACK CANNING 



ADVANTAGES:— 

All vegetables, fruits and some meats may be canned 
by this method satisfactorily; texture, taste and color 
being preserved. If all materials are in proper con- 
dition one is assured that the products will keep. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

1. Use well selected products; not over ripe and 
just gathered if possible. 

2. To scald — to dip into boiling water: — using a 
wire basket or cheese cloth bag. 

3. To blanch — to boil for the time directions state. 

4. To cold dip — to plunge into cold water: — using 
wire basket or bag as when scalding. 

5. Always fill jars to overflowing with liquid. 

6. Boiling or sterilizing outfit must have false 
bottom to raise jars slightly and avoid breakage. 
When this is made of wood, never use soft pine. 

7. Use enough water in kettle, boiler or outfit to 
cover jars to the necks. 

8. Cover outfit tightly and bring water to the 
boiling point. 

9. Count all cooking times from this point. 

10. At the end of boiling periods, remove jars, 
tighten covers and invert, avoiding drafts till cool. 
This tests leakage possibilities in jars, rubbers or 
covers. 



65 



VEGETABLES 

METHOD:— 

1. Wash carefully. 

2. Scrape, cut or prepare as kind demands. 
Examples — Carrots, scraped. 

Asparagus or String Beans, cut. 
Peas, shelled. 

3. Blanch or scald according to tim.e table. 

4. Cold dip. 

5. Peel if kind demands. 
Examples — Tomatoes and beets. 

6. Pack in jars. 

7. Fill with cold water and use 1 tsp. salt to each 
quart. 

8. Adjust new rubbers, and tops to partially seal. 
(If spring tops are used place the first clamp in position 
and leave the second clamp up instead of in position 
to seal tightly. If screw tops, screw down using thumb 
and little finger only. If lacquered tops, — place in 
position with clamp provided. 

9. Cook in hot water outfit according to time table- 

FRUITS 
METHOD:— 

1 . Wash carefully.

SYRUPS FOR FRUITS 

General Rule: — 3 parts sugar to 2 parts water. 
Thin syrup. Heat the above to boiling point. 
Medium syrup. Boil the above 3 minutes. 
Thick syrup. Boil the above 6 minutes. 

EXAMPLES:— 

Thin syrup — peaches, pears, apples. 

Medium syrup — blackberries, raspberries, sweet - 
cherries. 

Thick syrup— gooseberries, currants, sour cherries. 

The density of the syrup to be used depends on the 
taste of the family. Many families prefer medium 
syrup for all fruits except currants and sour cherries 
which always require thick syrup. 

Some fruits may be canned without sugar using 
water in place of syrup, the sugar being added to 
taste v/hen fruit is opened. The flavor is not as 
good, however as when syrup is used. 



68 



SPECIALS 
CANNED CORN 

Cut com from cobs, scraping out all the milk from 
cobs. Add water to cover and boil 12 ms. Pack in 
jars with Y2 tsp. salt and sugar to each quart. Boil 
the cobs in water to partly cover and use this liquid 
to fill jars to overflowing. Partially seal jars and cook 
1 hour as all cold-pack vegetables. 



TOMATO MINCE MEAT 

8 qts green tomatoes 8 qts apples 

5 lbs sugar 2 lbs chopped raisins 

1 c suet or drippings 3 tbsp salt 

1 c vinegar 2 tbsp cinnamon 

2 tbsp clove 1 nutmeg 

Chop tomatoes, drain, scald for 10 ms. in water to 
partly cover and drain again. Add apples, dropped, 
not pared, and all ingredients. 

Cook till tomato is about the color of the raisins and 
the apple is very soft. Put into jars and seal while 
very hot. 



CRANBERRY SAUCE 

1 qt cranberries 2 c water 

1 c AirlinE honey 2 tbsp cornstarch 

yi tsp soda I 

Put berries, water and soda in saucepan. Bring to 
boiling point. Pour off this water and add Y^ c fresh 
boiling water. Cook 10 ms. Strain, reheat, add

Cook 15 ms. Remove from range and cool. 



69 



JELLIES AND JAMS

Cover with cold water. Soak over night. Then 
cook till very soft. Mash sHghtly, add sugar, slowly 
cook till dissolved and quite dry. 

CARROT MARMALADE 
2 cooked carrots 4 c sugar 2 lemons 

Wash and scrape the carrots and cook in boiling 
water until tender. Drain and put through the meat- 
chopper. Add the juice and grated rinds of the lemons, 
and the sugar. Cook slowly about half an hour or until 
the consistency of marmalade. This quantity will 
fill six jelly-glasses. It tastes like a fine orange marma- 
lade.

weights of fruit and strained honey. When honey is 
hot, add fruit; simmer four hours. Skim out the fruit 
and put in small tumblers and cook syrup until thick, 
then fill glasses. Cover when cold with white paper 
and wax. Fruit may be seeded but this is much work. 

70

proper consistency. Pack while hot into sterilized 
jars and cook by cold pack method in hot water outfit 
10 ms. This last cooking in hot water outfit may be 
omitted and jars sealed with paraffine, but if followed 
to assure the keeping and not molding of the butter, it 
is best.

1 pk apples 1 qt cranberries 

Cook separately till soft with small amount of water. 
Strain, combine juices and boil 20 ms add | as much 
more sugar as juice. Boil tell it jells. 



71 



DRYING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

As a feature of food conservation the drying of 
vegetables and fruits is now recommended "because 
large quantities may be stored in a small space and in 
inexpensive receptacles. Products otherwise wasted 
may be saved for winter use. This is most practical 
for the house where a root cellar and vegetable closets 
are not feasible in which to store fresh winter vegetables. 

THREE METHODS OF DRYING 

1. Sun drying. 

2. Drying by artificial heat. 

3. Drying by air and air-blast, (as an electric fan). 

All methods require time and the large water con- 
tent of the product must be thoroughly dried out, then 
before using, with a long soaking (12 to 24 hrs) this is 
replaced. 

Sun drying is many times unsatisfactory because of 
the uncertainty of weather conditions. 

Artificial heat drying is satisfactory in an oven in 
which heat, can be controlled (gas or electric) and the 
temperature should be 110 degrees F. when work is 
started, and increased to 140 degrees, never over 150. 

Product is placed on large baking sheets and time 
required will vary from 3 to 7 hrs. 

Homemade driers or racks with low-wooden sides 
and fine wire bottoms are often suspended above a 
wood or coal range and this temperature of 120-140 
degrees thus obtained. 

Commercial driers may be purchased and their di- 
rections followed. 

When the third method is employed products are 
put on trays or racks so placed as to allow good air 
circulation and with an electric fan the average time 
required, is about 24 hrs. 

72 



Often the methods are combined, and sun and air 
both used, or, again, partly dried with heat and 
finished with air method. In all cases complete dry- 
ing is necessary. To test, place the dried product in 
jar or box for storage and with it a crisp cracker. After 
12 hrs. remove cracker and if not still crisp the presence 
of moisture is shown and drying must be continued be- 
fore storing fruit or vegetables. 

Shell beans, com and peas are the vegetables and 
apples, peaches and berries the fruits most success- 
fully treated by drying methods and most practical in 
either country or city homes.

Mazola - the oil from 
Corn - showing house- 
wives new and better 
ways of preparing food 



The necessity for saving animal fats - butter 
lard, suet - and the scarcity of olive oil, have 
opened up an entirely new field for American 
cooking. 

Today thousands of housewives 
are using Mazola for frying, sauteing, 
shortening and salad dressings - not 
onlybecause it comes from an edible 
vegetable source (Indian Corn) and 
is so wonderfully economical - but 
because it is showing the way to more 
delicate, more wholesome food. 

Send for the Mazola book of proven recipes 
- free - upon request.

FOREWORD 

The following chapters suggest substitutions and 
economies and it is their purpose to enable one to 
obtain results without the waste of materials in 
experimental attempts in the home kitchen. 

Most of the recipes have been given to audiences 
on the slips used at demonstration lectures, but are 
here assembled for every day use. 

The recipes are not all original but have all been 
tested and in many cases slightly changed to meet 
personal methods and tastes. 

MEASUREMENTS 

Accurate measurements are necessary to insure 
success. 

Level measurements are always to be used. 

The cup should have the half, third and quarter 
marked on it. 

One-half spoonful should ,be taken lengthwise and 
not crosswise of the spoon. 

White flour should be sifted before measured, 
c — cup 

tbsp — tablespoonful 
tsp — teaspoonful 

All bread recipes are in quantity for one loaf, all 
muffins for 9 to 12 muffins, and all other quantities 
the amount needed for the average family of four 
adults. 



NOTE 

In some recipes detailed instructions as to the combination of 
ingredients have been omitted, especially to avoid repetitions. 
Where directions are not given and any special order is necessary 
to insure success, combine in given order, reading across each line. 
Example : Cream Salad Dressing, page 47. Into oil, stir flour, 
salt, mustard, pepper and sugar. Add milk, then beaten egg and 
lastly, vinegar.

OUR PROBLEM 

At this critical time our country is called upon to 
supply food for her men in service, including soldiers 
in camps, sailors in the navy and all men "over-seas" 
as well as the people at home. Joined in the world 
war, we also have a duty towards our allies and many 
labor and transportation problems add to the serious- 
ness of the situation. 

OUR SOLUTION 

'True economy does not consist in going without 
but in making the most of what one has.** 

Only through the most careful conservation of all 
food materials can we solve this problem and meet 
this demand. 

Conservation does not mean going without the 
necessities but by avoiding all wastes, practicing true 
economy and using substitutions, study and plan 
so that neither children nor adults become examples 
of mal-nutrition. A person's best asset is a well 
nourished body and a nation's asset a healthy people. 
As a nation we are asked to save the 

WHEAT 

MEATS 

FATS 

SUGAR 

We must use the foodstuffs that cannot be satis- 
factorily transported and release those which our 
ships can best carry and which can be most easily 
prepared in quantities. 

We have not primarily a financial problem but it is 
our patriotic obligation and it is the housekeepers* 
part in the war to join a volunteer army and meet 
these demands, at the same time help to avoid rations 
or restricted diets and stabilize prices. 



RELEASE WHEAT FLOUR 



"Urge everyone to lessen wheat consumption by at least one- 
third, through substitutions." — Food Administration. 

Use corn, rice, Oats, barley, buckwheat and mixed cereal grains. 
Graham and entire wheat do not lessen wheat consumption much. 

The following recipes release wheat flour at least thirty per 
cent. In many families a larger proportion of substitution will 
be accepted but some wheat with its gluten content is necessary 
for best results in yeast breads and is legitimate asti ''binder". 

Barley flour may be used for part of the wheat flour measure- 
ment when a greater release of wheat is desired and thus a fifty 
per cent substitution gained and good results assured in these 
recipes following this principle. 

Rice flour and white corn flour are also on the market. 



YEAST BREADS 

STANDARD YEAST BREAD 

1 c. liquid (J^ c. milk and Yi c. water or 1 c. water) 
1 tbsp. shortening 1 tsp. salt

Mix liquid, shortening, molasses and salt. When 
this mixture is lukewarm, add yeast, dissolved in 
)/i c. lukewarm water, and lastly, the flour. Let rise 
to double its bulk and knead well. Shape into pan 
and when again double its bulk, bake 50 to 60 minutes. 

VARIATIONS 

For a sweeter bread, add another tablespoonful 
molasses or sugar. 



The quantity of flour will vary slightly with 
different kinds. 

Add enough for stiff dough so that little more is 
needed when bread is handled and shaped for the 
pans.

HOW TO RENDER FATS 

The trimmings and fats purchased with meats should 
always be saved and used. The fats obtained in cook- 
ing meats, especially chops, sausage and all waste 
must be utilized. 
TO RENDER FAT:— 

To render or "try out" fats, cut in small pieces. 
Place in a heavy pan in a slow oven and cook several 
hotirs. The use of the double boiler on top of range is 
often recommended and avoids any danger of burning 
but takes a longer time. When fat is melted and tissues 
or cracklings are crisp, strain fat through cheese cloth. 

To lessen strong flavors fat is rendered with equal 
parts of water and thus the flavor is washed out. Cool, 
and allow the fat to harden on top. Remove and re- 
serve for use. 
TO CLARIFY:— 

Fresh fats will be clarified as rendered but when not 
fresh, or very strong, or mixed kinds are used, a few 
slices of raw potato may be added. The most satis- 
factory method is to use 1 c skimmed milk to 2 lbs fat 
in place of the water suggested above. 
BLENDED FATS:— 

Often home rendered fats are two hard to be of the 
best consistency for shortening. Then blending is 
recommended. 

1. Melt 1 c beef or mutton drippings with ]/2 c lard 
or similar commercial fat. 

2. Melt Ij^cbeef or mutton fat with J^ cooking 
oil. In either method mix thoroughly and cool, stirring 
occasionally to avoid separation. 

TO EXTEND FAT FLAVORS:— 

When butter substitutes are used in soups, sauces, 
vegetables or other hot dishes, the characteristic flavor 
of butter may often be obtained if a small amount is 
added just before serving. 

63 



HOW TO MAKE SOAP 

5 lbs. lukewarm, clarified grease 1 lb can lye 
3 pts cold water J^ c ammonia 

J4 c powdered borax H c sal soda 

Fats unfit for food or frying purposes may be clarified 
and used for soap. Dissolve lye and sal soda in cold 
water over night. When cold, slowly add the melted 
fat, stirring constantly. Best results are obtained if 
fat is strained through cheesecloth. 

Dissolve borax in J c cold water and add with 
ammonia to first mixture. Stir until about as thick as 
molasses, which will be about 20 or 30 minutes. Pour 
into paste board boxes lined with heavy paper. Cut 
in pieces before it is two hard and store imtil well dried. 
This makes 8 lbs. of soap. 

NOTE : — The sal soda makes a more cleansing soap 
also softens the water and therefore yields more suds. 
The Ammonia and Borax may be increased to J^ c 
each with good results. 

HOW TO PRESERVE EGGS 

During April and May, when eggs are reasonable in 
price, the thrifty housekeeper may preserve them to 
be used for cooking purposes during the winter months 
when eggs are double in price. 

9 qts. of boiled and cooled water. 

1 qt. of water glass. 

15 doz. absolutely fresh eggs. 

5 gal. jar or crock with tight fitting cover. 

Handle eggs carefully to avoid cracking. The 
liquids should be mixed in this proportion and the eggs 
may be added from time to time as they are obtained. 
Eggs may be removed for use at any time. 

Water glass or silicate of sodium may be purchased 
at many grocery stores, some drug stores, and chemical 
companies. 

64 



COLD PACK CANNING 



ADVANTAGES:— 

All vegetables, fruits and some meats may be canned 
by this method satisfactorily; texture, taste and color 
being preserved. If all materials are in proper con- 
dition one is assured that the products will keep. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

1. Use well selected products; not over ripe and 
just gathered if possible. 

2. To scald — ^to dip into boiling water: — ^using a 
wire basket or cheese cloth bag. 

3. To blanch — ^to boil for the time directions state. 

4. To cold dip — to plunge into cold water: — ^using 
wire basket or bag as when scalding. 

5. Always fill jars to overflowing with liquid. 

6. Boiling or sterilizing outfit must have false 
bottom to raise jars slightly and avoid breakage. 
When this is made of wood, never use soft pine. 

7. Use enough water in kettle, boiler or outfit to 
cover jars to the necks. 

8. Cover outfit tightly and bring water to the 
boiling point. 

9. Coimt all cooking times from this point. 

10. At the end of boiling periods, remove jars, 
tighten covers and invert, avoiding drafts till cool. 
This tests leakage possibilities in jars, rubbers or 
covers. 



65 



VEGETABLES 

METHOD:— 

1. Wash carefully. 

2. Scrape, cut or prepare as kind demands. 
Examples — Carrots, scraped. 

Asparagus or String Beans, cut. 
Peas, shelled. 

3. Blanch or scald according to time table. 

4. Cold dip. 

5. Peel if kind demands. 
Examples — Tomatoes and beets. 

6. Pack in jars. 

7. Fill with cold water and use 1 tsp. salt to each 
quart. 

8. Adjust new rubbers, and tops to partially seal. 
(If spring tops are used place the first clamp in position 
and leave the second clamp up instead of in position 
to seal tightly. If screw tops, screw down using thumb 
and little finger only. If lacquered tops, — ^place in 
position with clamp provided. 

9. Cook in hot water outfit according to time table.

Thick syrup — gooseberries, currants, sour cherries. 

The density of the syrup to be used depends on the 
taste of the family. Many families prefer medium 
syrup for all fruits except currants and sour cherries 
which always require thick syrup. 

Some fruits may be canned without sugar using 
water in place of syrup, the sugar being added to 
taste when fruit is opened. The flavor is not as 
good, however as when syrup is used.

DRYING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

As a feature of food conservation the drying of 
vegetables and fruits is now recommended because 
large quantities may be stored in a small space and in 
inexpensive receptacles. Products otherwise wasted 
may be saved for winter use. This is most practical 
for the house where a root cellar and vegetable closets 
are not feasible in which to store fresh winter vegetables. 

THREE METHODS OF DRYING 

1. Stm drjang. 

2. Drying by artificial heat. 

3. Drying by air and air-blast, (as an electric fan). 

All methods require time and the large water con- 
tent of the product must be thoroughly dried out, then 
before using, with a long soaking (12 to 24 hrs) this is 
replaced. 

Sun drjdng is many times tmsatisfactory because of 
the uncertainty of weather conditions. 

Artificial heat diying is satisfactory in an oven in 
which heat, can be controlled (gas or electric) and the 
temperature should be 110 degrees F. when work is 
started, and increased to 140 degrees, never over 150. 

Product is placed on large baldng sheets and time 
required will vary from 3 to 7 hrs. 

Homemade driers or racks with low-wooden sides 
and fine wire bottoms are often suspended above a 
wood or coal range and this temperature of 120-140 
degrees thus obtained. 

Commercial driers may be purchased and their di- 
rections followed . 

When the third method is employed products are 
put on trays or racks so placed as to allow good air 
circulation and with an electric fan the average time 
required, is about 24 hrs. 

72 



Often the methods are combined, and sun and air 
both used, or, again, partly dried with heat and 
finished with air method. In all cases complete dry- 
ing is necessary. To test, place the dried product in 
jar or box for storage and with it a crisp cracker. After 
12 hrs. remove cracker and if not still crisp the presence 
of moisture is shown and dr)ang must be continued be- 
fore storing fruit or vegetables. 

Shell beans, com and peas are the vegetables and 
apples, peaches and berries the fruits most success- 
fully treated by drying methods and most practical in 
either cotmtry or city homes.
