INTRODUCTION. 



Till book which meets the wants of the times deservM a plaot 
in ever j household, and the writer who, in these degenerate days, 
contributes to the pleasures, and at the same time advances th€ 
real welfare, of the race, deserves a place in the Calendar with all 
the benefactors of the age. " The Southern Practical Cook 
*ry and Receipt Book" comes up to the standard here laid 
down. 

In reading the advertisements in our daily papers, the eye fre- 
quently falls upon something like this: — " Wanted, A good Cook.* 
rhis is a universal want, and one that must, to some extent, be sup 
plied. We are an eating race, and people will eat ; they have been 
educated to eat. Indeed, hitherto we have lived by this process, and 
jven now there appears no sign among the improvements of the age, 
)f such a reformation as will dispense with " table comforts." 
f lappy is that family that has this want gratified. I do not mean 
hat we are an Epicurean race ; so far from it, indeed, that then 
ire no visible tendencies in that direction, and it is hoped none will 
wer appear. But man is an animal, and all animals must eat ; 
md although it is written of him, "Thou shalt not live by bread 
tlone, w yet, a bountiful Providence has decreed seed time and 
*ar\ est, bread earned by the sweat of his brow, and a table of 
olenty. 

The forest grows timber, but it must be cut and dressed be 
ore it is prepared for the temple ; the quarries furnish the stonea^

but the workman must hew and polish them before they are fit 
for the building; and so nature, cultiTated, furnishes the food 
but art must dress and prepare it before it is ready foi the palate 
and digestion. We are not just now in a condition to sacrifiot 
much to fancy or ornament ; we must address ourselves to the 
useful and substantial. Every mother, wife, and daughter must now 
become a practical operator in the domestic circle. Each should 
be emulous to excel in neatness, industry, usefulness and economy 
The days for romance have passed, if they ever existed ; the night 
for the dreamy visions of elegance and luxury in connection with 
a life of indolence has suddenly given place to the day of enter- 
prise and industry. A crisis is upon us which demands the de- 
velopment of the will and energy of Southern character. Its prea 
tige in the past gives earnest of a successful future. As woman 
has been queen in the parlor, so, if need be, she will be queen in 
the kitchen ; as she has performed so gracefully the duties of mis 
tress of the establishment in the past, so she will, with a lovelier 
grace, perform whatever labor duty demands. She has learned 
that the services of a good cook, that queen of the kitchen, are es- 
sential elements in the health, the good temper, the enjoyment 
and peace of every family ; that the art of Cooking is the parent 
of all other arts, and eating and drinking the highest of all animal 
enjoyments. The race of good cooks among us is almost extinct. 
What shall be done to bring back the good old times, when a 
knowledge of the good housewifery demanded for the health and 
comfort of ever)' family was not considered too low for the atten* 
r tion of any lady ? Labor should not be held in disrepute by any 
for it is written " hi the sweat of thy brow shalt thou earn bread ;* 
and again, "Not slothful in business ;" i.r.d still again, "But il 
tny man provides not for his owr, and especially for his '- w»

house (or kindred) he hath denied the faith and is worse th*»a an 
infidel.'' The v* :>rd " he " in the hist quotation is generic, and 
standi as the representative of both sexes. 

Will not the ladies, whose opinions and actions form public 
f ntiment, lead off in a culinary reform, which will correct th6 er 
ws of the past, and introduce a system of industry and eoouoinj 
to meet the present emergencies 1 Reverse the present order of 
things. Make idleness and indolence disreputable, and labor and 
usefulness honorable. Pluck from the hand of the destroyer ths 
premium awarded to idleness and give it to industry. Teach to 
all classes of our people, by your uniform example, that : — 

M Labor is rest from the sorrows that greet us, I 

Rest from all petty vexations that meet us, 
Rest from sin's promptings that ever entreat us, 
Rest from world's syrens that lure us to ill." 

Those now entering and soon to enter upon the duties of life, 
ihould not do so with mistaken views as to the responsibilities 
they will have to meet, and the manner of discharging the obli 
nations of the domestic sphere. They should not look forward 
is slaves to the task, or as idle pupils to the recitation. Labor 
aromotes hea.th, and health fosters contentment. So, to be both 
healthy and happy, we should be both usefully and profitably 
•mployed. 

1 am most happy to be able to Slate that the reform here reeom- 
ttiended has already begun, and is progressing most encouraging 
iy. Our women have the will and intelligence; the practical de- 
velopment of the resources at their command is all that is necea 
aary to insure success. The appearance of the "Southern Prac- 
tical Cookery and Receipt Book" at this crisis augurs a new 
and brighter era in the culinary art. It is a book admirably

adapted to the timc3 and the people — the production of a 
eminently practical mind, one whose long experience and ac- 
knowledged celebrity among ner friends as a cateress entitle! 
her opinions, as contained in the Showing pages, to be be! [ 
as oracular. The style of the boo*, is graceful and easy, ai 
U free from the monotony that usually characterizes the eluei 
dation of subjects so analogous to each other. 

Our authoress has proved herself to be mistress in literature, aa 
well as queen in the kitchen. Her versatility of talent qualifies 
her for the positioi which her sense of duty urged her, against 
her inclination, to assume ; namely, to assist all who may de- 
sire knowledge and improvement in the important art of cook- 
ing. 

The instructions here presented are the result of a life of ex- 
perience, observation, and reading. No untried theory is offered, 
nor have we here a system too luxurious for the poor, or too ecu 
nomical for the rich. The wants, tastes, and abilities of all are 
consulted, so that the poor may luxuriate on delicious soupt 
every day made from the savings which a wasteful housekeeper 
would consider utterly worthless. If our Southern women ar 
going to meet the present crisis as they have all the trials of the 
past (and none can doubt but the)' will), they will find this book 
a companion of invaluable service, and a constant adviser, whose 
opinions may be trusted as entirely reliable. Adopt the system 
here presented, and you will soon find your husband delighted 
with the improvement in your style of living, and it will not be 
long before he will compliment you on the economy of yo ar new 
regulations. If, then, the system improves the style of living, 
and at the same time curtails the expenses of the table, none wil" 
doubt the wisdom of the authoress, the adaptation of this improve

mont to the necessities of the times, and its re a. value to every 
household 

If Byron was not mistaken in the subjoined lines, the ladict 
will find that a feast to the palate is the most successful appeal 
hey can make to the hearts of the sterner sex. I do not endorse 
Ois views, but leave the reader to accept or reject, to prove or 
disprove by experience, as she may choose ; assuring her that no 
gentleman was ever offended by being invited to a good dinner, 
or thought less of his hostess for displaying good taste in the 
preparation and arrangement of the viands of which he was to 
partake. 

Of all appeals— although 
I grant the power of pathos and of gold, 
Of beauty, flattery, threats, a shilling — no 
Method's more sure at moments to take hold 
Of the best feelings of mankind, which grow 
More tender as we every day behold, 
Than that all-softening, overpowering knell, 
The tocsin of the soul — the dinner bell." 

But I must not close without a word to the sterner sex ; and 
fet, why say a word to men in introducing a cook-book? Who 
ever knew one to take such a work in his hands, much less to 
read a page of its contents? Well, if 1 can get the ear and 
interest of the women, I shall not fear that the " lords of crea- 
tion" will long remain in ignorance of the suggestions here 
offered. I therefore feel encouraged to say a word for their benefit 

I say for their benefit; for so it will prove if they will reduc 
nov suggestions to practice. Whei you come from your busi 
ness, weaiied and worn, you want a good, wholesome, healthy, 
And palatable meal. This is a reasonable want; it may and 
vught to be gratified ; and it can and will be, provided you wilJ

furnish the apparatus a::d facilities, You would not require t 
mechanic to Wld you a house without the necessary materials, 
nor should you exptc*. the mistress of your house to perform her 
duties well unless you furnish her with the requisite ccnveni» 
,mces. Our enterprising lady friends are deterred from entering 
ipon the work which now so urgently invokes their persona 
attention. The task is a Herculean one : double the labor neces- 
sary for the end desired is to be accomplished, on account of the 
almost total absence of convenient utensils and the other et cseteras 
which make up a complete and cosey establishment Nothing is 
inviting, everything is repulsive ; nothing to facilitate, everything 
to hinder. Look around your premises and see if a reformation 
is not greatly needed. You sought insurance from fire in the 
magnificent distance which exists between the houses which make 
up the family group. Your kitchen is set quite a distance in the 
rear of your dwelling ; the smoke-house off in another direction 
quite as far; while the well may be a remove so great that one 
would think that the only exercise to be enjoyed by the family 
was in going after water. And as for a storehouse, that is voted 
s superfluity. Now the consequence of this horrid and unsightly 
arrangement is, that the labor necessary to gather materials for a 
meal is more fatiguing than its pieparation. If you cannot do 
otherwise, burn that kitchen and smoke-house where they stand. 
Your dwelling will be in no danger from the conflagration 
Unite your kitchen with your dwelling, and furnish with a stove, etc. 
Inclose your pump under the same roof; have your pantry large 
enough tc hold ; our supply of provisions, and let all your arrange 
ments be labcr-saving. When thus arranged, take the mistress 
of your household into your kitchen, and let her examine its con 
tents closely, to see if all necessary articles aro furnished ; than,

If she is satisfied, jou Lave done your du';y, and are entitled to 
the thanks of a gratified and happy wife, who will greet you 
with her smiles and reward you with her economy. Are yoa 
alarmed at the trouble and expense necessary for the arrange 
uient of all these conveniences ? You should not be ; they will 
lontribute largely to the pleasure, ease, and health of your family. 
Try it, and see if I be a false prophet.

DEDICATION. 

\ 

To young and inexperienced SDuthern housekeepers desire tc 
dedicate this work. In its preparation I have been influenced 
mainly by the consideration that in this peculiar crisis of our do- 
mestic as well as national affairs, counsel is needed — wise and 
timely counsel, which not only gives warning of dangers ahead, 
but, in language clear and unmistakable, teaches how they may 
be avoided. Thousands of young women are taking nnnr them- 
selves the responsibilities of housekeepers, a position for which 
their inexperience and ignorance of household affairs renders them 
wholly unfitted. Formerly "mother" or "mother's cook," or 
one whom the considerate mother had trained to fill this impor- 
tant office in the daughter's menage, was, with many, the only au 
thority considered necessary in the conduct of culinary operations. 
Now, however, things are changed. " Mother," even if ^ ithin 
accessible distance, is too much occupied with the accumulated 
cares of her own establishment to be able to devote much time 
and attention to a separate one; while "mother's cook" and 
" trained servants" are remembered as among the good spirits 
that ministered to the luxury and ease of by -gone days. 

Youth and inexperience are lamentable drawbacks which can 
not be set aside by the brave hearts that would overcome thf ■ 
trials that assail them in the outset of their domestic career; ;ind 
they must content themselves to " begin at the beginning;" to 
learn the rudiments of the science first, and by the exercise of 
common sense and a laudable ambition they may hope to be- 
come (through experience) thorough good housekeepers, it if 
nith the earnest hope of benefiting this class that I have yielded 
A) the importunities of many friends and consented to place in 
wir hands the results of an experience of thirty years, trusting 



DEDICATION. t* 

that it may prove to many an unerring gu..1e through -he laby 
rinth of domestic duties. 

The rules that I give are collected from experience and othei 
•"reliable" sources, and if faithfully and attentively practised will 
Insure success. To experienced housekeepers, the directions 
may seem tediously minute. I have examined a great many 
Cookery books. In a majority of thern too mu%h is taken for 
granted, and much of the very information that a novice most 
need? is omitted, as facts with which every one is familiar. In 
preparing this Receipt Book, a vivid recollection of my own ut- 
ter ignorance of household affairs at the time that I assumed the 
duties of mistress of a family, suggested the idea of taking but 
one thing for granted, viz. : that the majority of those for whom 
this book is principally intended know as little as I did, and 
stand as greatly in need of the aid and instruction that I would 
gladly have received. That these will be found in the pages cl 
this book I sincerely believe, and although devoid of the vanity 
of supposing that my contemporaries in age can profit by the di- 
rections herein contained, I should confess to defeat and disap- 
pointment, should they fail to supply that absence of practical 
Knowledge which is the source of so many failures and disap 
pointments to those who are just taking the initiatory step* in 
housekeeping.

WENERAL REMARKS 



" Whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well.* 

Tlat the duties of the cnok may he properly performed, then 
kvwst bo suitable apparatus to work with. All other trades re- 
quire nice tools suited to the bupiness to be done, and why should 
not the claims of this important functionary be admitted % It 
n.any kitchens — perhaps the majority — an insufficient numbei 
of utensils is furnished, and those without any regard to adapta 
tion, with the unreasonable expectation that, whatever the variety 
to be served up, all shall be performed in a skillful manner. A 
liberal supply of cooking utensils is good economy ; it saves both 
time and labor. It is wise management to curtail expenses in fit 
ting up the parlor, in order to spend in fitting up the kitchen 
An old English writer upon the subject has humanely observed . 
11 There is real enjoyment in a well-cooked meal; and as thr 
practice of cooking is attended with so many discouraging uiffi 
culties, so many dugudting and disagreeable circumstances, w 
ought to have some regard for those who encounter them to pro 
cure us pleasure, aud 10 regard their sen ices by rendering their 
situation in every way as comfortable and agreeable as possible.*

Nourishment and Palatableness." 



To make the best soups, use lean, juicy, fresh-killed meat ; 
beef, veal, mutton, kid, lamb, or venison. Proportion the water 
to the meat in preparing the broth. To one pound of meat, add 
three pints of water, and reduce it by boiling to one quart. 
Place the soup-pot over a slow lire, which will make the watej 
hot without causing it to boil, for at least naif an hour. Gen 
tie stewing is best. If the meat used is a leg or shin of beef, 
crack the bone in several places. To this, any trimmings ot 
poultry may be added ; a few slices of lean ham, if a large 
quantity of soup is to be made. The vessel in which soup is 
made, should have a close, well-fitting cover, which should be 
carefully kept in its place during the whole process. Tikis 
will not only preserve much of the nutritive part of th« tuices 
of the meat, by preventing evaporation, but prevent smoke 
getting in, which would spoil the flavor of the broth. As the 
water begins to boil, a quantity of scum will rise to the top 
which must be frequently and carefully removed. When th 
water looks clear, the vegetables and sal* may be put in. Thia 
will cause more scum to rise, which must also be removed. After 
this is done, place the pot, carefully covered, where it will boil 
gentiy . It will require from three to four hours to prepare soup 
properly, unless' the broth has been made the previous day. 
When convenient, it is a good plan to boil the broth the day 



MRS. HILL V S NEW COOK BOOR. 

it is to be used ; when it cools, the fat can be more easily 
moved, and if a variety of dishes is to be prepared, this ar- 
rangement will lessen the labor of the cook. The broth w Jl keep 
{•erfectly well, but must not stand in a metallic vessel. Keep 
tome spare broth in case your soup boils too thick. If this ii 
fcot done, and more fluid is required, use boiling water. Cold 
water will injure the quality of the soup. When wii d is used, 
it should never be put in more than ten or fifteen minutes beft re 
sending to the table. Spices and pepper should be tied in a thiu 
muslin cloth, so as to be easily taken out. All bones, gristle, and 
pieces of fat should be carefully removed before serving. As 
much of the meat as is needed, should be cut in small pieces and 
put in the tureen before the soup is taken up. The broth being 
well prepared, the difference in soups depends mainly upon the 
seasoning. Says this old English writer, from whom I have al- 
ready quoted: "The art of composing a rich soup is, so to pro- 
portion the several ingredients one to another, that no particu- 
lar taste be stronger than the rest ; but to produce such a fine, 
harmonious relish, that the whole is delightful." 

The vegetables mostly used in soups are tomatoes, turnips, 
onions, carrots, celery, asparagus, peas, ochra, corn, butter-beans, 
cabbage and Irish potatoes. The two latter should always be 
parboiled before adding to the soup. The flavor of the former 
is too strong when put in raw, and the water in which the latter 
is boiled is thought injurious. The herbs used in soups for flavor 
ing, are principally thyme, parsley, summer and winter savory, 
sage and sweet basil. The spices are cloves, mace and allspice , 
black and cayenne pepper are also used. The articles used foi 
thickening are, flour, rice, arrow-root, bread crumbs, maccaroni, 
vermicelli and pearl barley. The water in which any kind of 
fresh meat or poultry is boiled, may be converted into soma 
kind of soup. 

The predominant meat or vegetable gives name to the soup 
and any attentive housekeeper can soon learn to make a j udicioui 
oombiuation of materials.

"To understand the economy of household affairs is not only 
essential to a woman's proper and pleasant performance of the 
duties of a wife and mother, but is indispensable to the comfort, 
res portability, and general welfare of all families, whatever b« 
heir circumstance**." 



1 Brown Soup. — A leg or shank >f beef is best for this ; 
othe.. meats may be used, however, if more convenient. Break 
the bone in several places; wash it carefully, put it in the soup- 
pot, and cover well with cold water. Set the vessel where ths 
water will heat, but not boil, for half an hour. As the scum 
rises to the top, it should be skimmed off carefully, until all of 
it is removed. Add to a gallon of broth, half a pint of turnips, 
peeled and sliced; the same of carrots and tomatoes. Before put- 
ting in the tomatoes, skin and cut them in slices, and stir to them 
an even teaspoonful of brown sugar; add a teacup of onions, the 
same of cabbage, shred fine and parboiled • Jso of Irish potatoes. 
Brown three tablespoonfuls of flour in a skillet, taking care to 
stir it well that it may not burn, as the least particle of scorched 
flour will injure the taste of the soup ; make a thin paste of this 
with water ; stir this paste into the soup half an hour before 
^ending it to the table. This thickening should be thoroughly in 
corporated with the soup ; salt and pepper to taste ; cut a portioi 
wf the meat from the bone in very small pieces, and add to the 
soup. Put the carrots to boil first, as they require longer time to 
30 jk than the ether vegetables, or else grate them. The latter is 
the best w r ay of using them. 

2. Mock Turtle Soup. — Take the head of a calf or kid, and Vwo 
feet of the calf that have been carefully cleaned. It is best to 
boil these the day before they are to be used. If this has not 
bfeu done, very early in the morning put them in the soup-po 
ind cover with cold water. (Before this is done, however, ths 
upper and lower jaws should be separated, and the brains re.

moved.) Let the water heat slowly, and skim carefully at 
directed ab«r\e. Should the water become too much reduced, 
add boiling water as may be needed. When the meat is done 
and no more, take it up, pick it from the bones, and chop iiiif 
Strain the liquet through a nne colander ; return the liquor ant 
i*itt of the meat to the pot. Tie in a thin muslin cloth a ft* 
grams of allspice, bruised slightly, and a dozen cloves ; drop this i; 
the soup-kettle, and add one nutmeg grated ; this is spice enougl 
foi half a gallon of soup ; then salt and pepper to taste. Stij 
frequently, to prevent the meat at the bottom of the pot froir 
burning. Fifteen minutes before sending it to the table, add a 
large wine-glass of Madeira wine to each quart of soup, and half ; 
gill of good catsup. To each gallon add two tablespoon mis of 
lemon juice, the peel of one pared thin and cut in small pif*»3s 
After simmering ten minutes in the soup, remove the lemon pt el 
This soup should be thickened with flour ; one tablespoon! ul of 
batter, made with water and browned flour, to each gallon of 
soup, added half an hour before the soup is done. A few sp iga 
of sweet basil is an improvement. The yolks of eight hard-bo* led 
eggs, sliced, should be put into the soup after it is poured into 
the tureen. Forced-meat balls may also be added. This soup 
is equally good, and with less trouble, made of a shank of vea 1 or 
oeef. Pig's head may also be used. A little butter, and cooked 
Irish potatoes added to the remaining meat, laid in good puv 
crust, makes good mock-turtle pie. 



3. Oyster Soup. — One quart of sweet milk; one quart ol 
oysters. Boil the juice of the oysters and the milk together 
This must only boil up twice ; very little cooking is necessary 
To this quantity add a tablespoonful of butter, or less, if pre 
"erred, salt and pepper to taste. About ten minutes before 
taking the soup up, stir ii. a half pint of crackers, or light bread, 
rolled fine ; then add the oysters. Much boiling hardens the 
oyeteis. Nothing improves the soup so much as celery a few 
heads cut up and boiled with the milk; or flavor with a few

bruised seed tied up in a muslin cloth, and beih i until the Ravoi 
is imparted, and then removed. When it is not convenient to 
use crackers or bread crumbs, stir two teaspoonfils of flour into 
the 1 utter before adding it; or use arrow-root instead of wheal 
lour. Add yolks of egg to oyster soup, four to a can of oyster^ 
t Mien i, pour on them one pint of milk. 

4. Gumbo. — Fry a young chicken ; after it gets old, take out 
the bones. In another vessel fry one pint of young, tender, < u 
up ochra and two onions. Pu f all in a well-cleaned soup-kettle ; 
an iron stew-pan lined with tin or porcelain is best. Add on© 
quart c c water; stew gently until done; and season with pepper 
and salt-. Another way of preparing Gumbo, is : Cut up a fowl 
as if to fry ; break the bones ; lay it in a pot with a little lard or 
fresh butter. Brown it a little. When browned, pour a gallon of 
water on it; add a slice of lean bacon, one onion cut in slices a 
pint of tomatoes skinned, two pints of young pods of ochra cut 
ti]), and a few sprigs of parsley. Cover closely, removing the 
cover to pkim off all impurities that may rise to the top. Set 
the sou i-kettle where the water will simmer gently at least four 
hours. Half an hour before the soup is put in the tureen, add a 
thickening, by mixing a heaping tablespo.mful of sassafras leaves, 
dried and pounded fine, with a little soup. Stir this well into 
the soup. Serve with a separate dish of rice. 

Gather the leaf-buds of the sassafras early in the spring; dry, 
pound, sift, and bottle them. Miss Leslie recommends stirring 
with a sassafras stick, when the powdered leaves "feela" cannot 
b-j pjocurcd. The sassafras taste is very disagreeable to some 
persons, therefore should be omitted when this is the case. 



5. Vegetable Soup — Maigre. — To a quarter of a pound of fresa 
butter, boiling hot, add two onions chopped fine; let them 
•tew. When they are soft, add two heads of celery, teacup 
each of corn, butter, beans, cabbage, tomatoes, and peas. Stii 
them well with the butter and onions. Have ready a kettle o^ 
boiling water; pour over the vegetables a pint at a time tu.ti

as mtiu as is needed is added. 15<>il until the vegetables art 
done. Salt and pepper to taste. Lay sliees of toast at the 
bottom of the. tureen, and pour on the soup. 



C. Asparagus Soup. — Boil the asparagus with any kind of 
htsh meat or fowl, or the broth in which they have been boik«4 
To a quart of this liquor add a heaping teaspoonful of flu* 
•tirred into a teacup of cream, added just before sei ving. A 
hundred points of asparagus will answer for three pints of brot h j 
cut them into pieces two inches long ; boil half an hour ; salt 
and pepper to taste. 



7. CV» Soup. — To a small hock bone of ham, or slice of good 
bam, add <^ne quart of water. As soon as it boils, skim it weH 
until the liquor is clear; add one large teacup and a half of 
grated corn, one quart of sweet milk, and a tablespoonful oi 
butter, into which has been rubbed a heaping teaspoonful of 
flour ; salt and pepper to taste. 



8. Green Pea Soup. — The pods of peas make an excellent 
soup after the peas are shelled out. Boil the hulls and peas in 
separate vessels. Strain the water in which the hulls were 
boiled through a colander. Return the liquor to the pot and 
make the soup by any of the foregoing receipts, and add the pe«s 
a quarter of an hour before serving ; add crackers in the bottom 
of the tureen. Instead of boiling the pea-hulls in water alone, 
add a little fresh meat or a slice of ham ; butter may be added 
with a small quantity of flour rubbed into it if liked. 



9. Potato Soup. — Take eight large, or a dozen small, mealr 
rish potatoes ; peel and cut them in slices, and boil in three 
pints of water until they can be mashed. Take them up; rub 
through a colander. Into a large tablespoonful of butter riT 
one tablespoonful of flour, and add to the soup; let this boil half 
an hour. More water may be added, if necessary. Just before 



SOUPS.

#erv4n£, add a tumbler of hot rich cream. The soup must no! 
boil after the cream is added. This may be made richer by 
adding any kind of fresn meat to the water; then, after boilmg 
itrain the broth from the meat. 



10. Ochra Soup. — Make a broth of fowls or fresh meat; Yea 
I best. To a gallon of this add three dozen young, tender pod* 
of ochra ; cut up thin ; boil gently and slowly three hours, stirring 
occasionally. Remove the meat, and season with salt and 
pepper. Rice and tomatoes may, if liked, be added in small 
quantities. This should make three quarts of soup. 



11. Tomato Soup. — To a gallon of broth made of any kind of 
fresh meat liked (veal is best) or poultry, add six dozen medium 
sized tomatoes, which have been cut up, but not skinned ; stir to 
he tomatoes a tablespoonful of good brown sugar, to soften their 
extreme acid taste. Put them to stew gently and steadily in a 
well-covered soup-kettle. Salt to taste. Boil two hours; ther> 
strain the soup through a colander; return it to the kettle. T« 
a large tablespoonful of nice, sweet butter, rub in a tablespoonfu 
of flour. Put this to the soup ; let it simmer ten or fifteen minutes 
When the flavor of onions is not disliked, one or two may b- 
used, shred fine, or a few heads of eschalots, and put to boil a 
the same time the tomatoes are. The flavor of the onions must 
be so delicate as to be scarcely recognized. Persons differ a> 
regards thickening. The cook must ascertain the taste of those 
to be served, and add or diminish as may be proper. 



12. Soup a la Julienne. — Cut up three carrots, two turnips, a 
^nartei of a head of cabbage or lettuce, one white onion, two 
Irish potatoes, six heads of celery ; boil a good shank bone of 
beef or veal ; to a half-gallon of this broth add the vegetal lea, 
and boil until they are done. Skim the soup well ; add salt. \\x\ 
not pepper ; this can be added extcnipore, and as suits indi 
viJual taste.

12|. Soup a la Jfisque. — One-fourth of a pound of rice, and 
twelve crabs (soft shell) ; boil in good broth, and when dont 
pound and rub through a sieve. Fill the heads of the crabs with 
fifth stuffing, and add a little butter. 



13. Curry Soup. — Cover four pounds of beef, veal, or mutton, 
frith one gallon of water. Boil gently until reduced to thre« 
tjuarts; skim carefully; add twelve corns of black pepper, 
one nutmeg, and half a teaspoonful of cinnamon. After boil- 
ing one hour and a half, strain it. While it is boiling, fry 
of a nice brown, in butter and lard mixed, or in good sweet lard 
alone, four thin slices of beef, veal, or mutton, and four onions. 
When they are done, pour the broth on them ; put it on the fire ; 
remove any scum that rises, and let it simmer half an hour. 
Mix two teaspoonfuls of curry powder, the same of flour, with a 
little cold water, and a teaspoonful of salt; add this to the soup, 
and let it simmer gently. Add boiling water if there is less than 
three quarts of soup when done. Serve the meat in a separate 
dish, with a rich tomato sauce. This soup may be made without 
the curry powder, seasoning high with pepper. 



14. Pigeon Soup. — Take six pigeons, partridges, or other 
birds ; clean nicely and cut up. Put the gizzards, necks, and 
livers, with the other parts of the birds, into half a gallon of cold 
water. Boil until done. Take up the pigeons ; pick all the meat 
from the bones ; strain the broth through a sieve ; return it to 
the pot, and thicken with half a pint of bread crumbs. Season 
with mace, allspice, and cloves ; put the last in whole ; salt and 
p< I per. Add the meat, which must be picked up very Ana

paisley, thyme, and sweet basil, six cloves, one dozen grains of 
whole allspice a few blades of mace, pepper and salt ; toast thin 
ilwvs of light bread and lay in the bottom of the tureen ; pour 
<>n the soup and serve hot, after first removing the meat from tho 
•oup. Squirrels are good used in the same way ; for the same 
quantity of water four squirrels will be necessary if they are 
young. 



1<>. — Chicken and Oyster Soup. — (A superior receipt.) Cut 

up a full-grown fowl as for frying. Clean the giblets nicely, and 
put all in the soup- kettle with just enough water to cover them ; 
Ect it simmer gently; remove all tne scum. When the chicken is 
tender, take it up, strain the liquor and return it to the kettle. 
Add a quart of sweet milk to a quart of broth ; if there should not 
be as much broth as is needed, pour in sufficient boiling water ; 
Add a quart of oysters with their juice, and two or three blades 
of mace. A tablespoonful of butter, one of arrow-root, wheat 
flour rubbed into the butter, and one gill of hot cream ; stew gent- 
fcy five minutes. Cream must always be boiled before being put 
into soup or gravy. Use the chicken for salad. 



17. Rick Chicken Soup. — Take four quarts of water, fo'ir

to t&3te ; pick the ch.ckcn from the bones, return it to the soup 
until hot, pour into the tureen and serve. 



18. Mr*. H. *s Receipt for making Turtle Soup. — Cut off tto 
& ad ; hang up the turtle; let it bleed freely ; cat off the fina, 
in id separate the upper and lower shells carefully ; keep th« 
knife close to the upper shell to avoid breaking the gall bladder. 
Cut up the turtle ; put shells and all into the stew-pan after the 
shells have been carefully cleaned. Let them boil five minutes, 
plunge the turtle in cold water and scald again five minutes ; 
again plunge it in cold water ; save all the green fat from the in 
testines and other parts ; cut as much off the turtle as is needed 
for soup, using the fins, entrails, heart, and liver ; put them to 
boil in a gallon of water, in a closely-covered soup-kettle ; when 
done, take off the meat and return the bones to the kettle ; simmer 
gently ; they will add something to the strength of the stock. In 
a quarter of an hour strain this broth from the bones, cut up the 
meat fine, put all in the kettle, seasoning with four tablepoonfula 
of green eschalot, two tablespoonfuls each of parsley, thyme, mar- 
joram and sweet basil, two lemons cut up, with the seeds removed, 
one dozen allspice, one dozen cloves, one nutmeg beaten fine, half a 
teaspoonful of curry powder; pepper and salt to taste; let this 
simmer gently one hour. Make a rich brown broth in another ves- 
sel, by boiling together two pounds of beef and one pound of ham 
in two quarts of water ; fry, until a light brown, four large onions 
cut up in three-quarters of a pound of butter ; add this (stirring in 
lowly) to the brown broth ; add the same quantity of spice used 
with the turtle. Make a paste of one large tablespoonful of ftoui 
and water sufficient to form the paste; add this quantity as thick- 
ening for each gallon of soup; ooil this one hour; strain this 
broth on to the turtle; stir all well and boil half an hour, stirring 
frequently, to prevent the meat from sticking to the bottom of 
the soup-kettle; shculd more seasoning be required, add it be 
lore boiling the list half hour. A quarter of an huur before th« 



80UP8. 2ft 

•3up is done, add the green fat, and a half pint of Madeira wint^ 
jo three quarts of soup, added hot. 
Prepare the stock for this soup the day before it is wanted. 

19. Another Turtle Soup, less complicated. — Boil the turtle 
ei y tender, remove all bones, cut the meat into small pieces j 
eason with a tablespoonful each of marjoram, sweet basil, thyme 
and parsley ; pepper and salt to taste ; one nutmeg beaten fine ; 
a dozen cloves; the same of allspice. Tie these in thin muslin, 
and remove it before sending the soup to the table ; stir a large 
tablespoonful of browned flour into a quarter of a pound of fresh 
butter ; add this to the soup ; pour over five quarts of boiling water ; 
reduce by boiling to three quarts ; boil gently. A quarter of an 
hour before it is done, add the green fat; and to three quarts o 
soup, half a pint of wine, a lemon sliced thin, the seeds removed 
add force-meat balls ; after simmering five minutes, take out 
the lemon peel. This is for a small turtle ; if not fat, a slice of 
good ham may be added, and removed before serving. 



20. Beef Soup. — Cover the bottom of the soup-kettle with a 
pound of lean ham ; three pounds of lean juicy beef sliced and 
laid over the ham; strew over this, half a pint of onions chopped 
fine ; cover with just water enough to extract the juices without 
burning. This should stew very gently for half an hour ; add 
three quarts of boiling water ; boil slowly ; remove the grease 
and scum ; when the broth looks clear, add any vegetables that 
may be liked. To each quart, add a tablespoonful of bread 
crumbs. When the vegetables are done, strain thern from the 
■oup ; return soup to the kettle, and add maccaroni ur vermi 
celli, two ounces to each quart ; break in small pieces and scald 
In hot water before putting it to the soup ; boil ten minutes ; use 
catsup and avoid over-seasoning. In making brown soups, always 
itew the meat in very little water, until of a brown coloi. -A 
lamb, kid, or pigs-head makes the soup well. 



28 MRS. U1LLS NfiW COOK BOOK. 

21. Dried Pea Soup. — Remove carefully all unsound peas 
wash and soak them an hour or two, as may be convenient. Tc 
one quart of dried peas put four quarts of water ; a small piec€ 
of lean ham ; cut up one large turnip, and one head of celery ; add 
to the peas; boil until the broth is reduced one half; mash all 
through a colander; return the soup to the kettle; add anothei 
bead of celery and an onion chopped fine ; season with cayenne 
pepper and salt t) taste; boil half an hour; toast slices of light 
bread, and lay in the botto n of the tureen ; pour the soup over 
it ; celery, vinegar, or the extract may be used if there is no 
fresh celery to be had. Brown peas are used foi giving a richer 
color* 



22. Ox Tail Soup. — This part of the beef is generally little 
esteemed, but few things make better soup, on account of the 
gelatinous matter contained in it. Break the bone in several 
places ; put it to boil, with one or two of the feet, well cleaned, 
or half of the cheek ; finish by the "beef soup" receipt, or any 
of the foregoing liked. 

23. Oyster Gumbo. — P« T <*ne large table-spoonful of lard in 
your soup-pot ; stir in it ow o large spoonfuls of flour ; stir until 
\his browns ; add to this a good slice of ham and one of lean 
oeef ; cover with cold water and stew ; skim off all dross care- 
fully ; add an onion cut up in small pieces ; season with salt and 
pepper. When the meats are of a rich brown ct^or, not dark, 
add thre* quarts of boiling water ; let this boil rapidly an hour ; 
ten minutes before seizing, add the oysters ; remove the vessel 
from the fire, and stir in a teaspoonful of powdered sassafras 
leaves, and buds called " feela." A dish of rice should accom- 
pany the gumbo ; put a spoonful into the soup-plate; then pout 
over the soup or gumbo.

a slice or two of loaf broad, toasted very ^rown ; eithei of these 
will arswer to give a brown color, stewed with the soup. White 
stock is made by the same rule, only the meat must not be 
browned. Vegetables should not be used which will affect the 
tolar of the stock. Veal and poultry are the best meats fcr Uiu 
Celery, turnips, corn, and white onions are the most suitablt 
vegetables, and mace the only spice ; black pepper should nol 
be used, the white or Jamaica is best; and the thickening for 
the soup should be wet up with milk. 



24. Fish Soup. — This soup can be made out of any kind of 
fresh tisli. Put the fish on to stew, and cover it with water ; a 
small piece of lean bacon may be added ; add an onion, celery, 
parsley, pepper and salt. When this is stewed until the meat 
will drop from the bones, strain the fish from the soup, and re- 
turn the soup to the kettle. Beat up the yolks of three or four 
eggs (depending upon the quantity of soup), stir to the soup ; 
add any kind of spices liked, and butter to make it rich enough. 
Just before serving add wine or catsup to taste. I prefer catsup. 
Clams can be made in the same way ; very good. This soup niaj 
be made of the heads of fish only. 



25. Calf's Head Soup. — Cover the head, after it is well 
cleaned and cut up, with a gallon and a half of water. Let it 
boil until the meat drops off ; chop this fine ; cut up and put in 
the soup-pot the brains ; an onion, parsley ; clove and Ulspice to 
taste, salt, pepper, sage, and thyme ; work in a piece of butter 
th 3 size of an egg an even table-spoonful of flour. Drop thif 
In the roup J ist before serving season with wine, if liked. 



26. To Clarify Soup.— Add to the broth, while cold, the 
whites of two eggs (for half a gallon) whipped to a froth. Stir 
h into the broth well; simmer gently, without stirring, until the 



30 lias, full's new cook book. 

liquid looks clear; then begin to skim until the impurities art 
removed. Soups are seldom clarified, except foi white soups. 
(Arrow-root is a nice, crticle for thickening white soups.) Alwayi 
wet the cloth through which the soup is to be straine-*" in cold 
water; this hardens the fat, and more entirely separates it from 
the liquor when it is desirable to remove the fat. 

In making brown soups, broil or fry the meat first in the bol 
torn of the soup-kettle ; then pour over it cold water. Made in 
this vay, the soup is richer and of a better color ; or stew it in 
very little water until brown ; then pour over it the water neces- 
sary to make the soup. A good proportion of wine is a tumblerful 
(or half a pint) to three quarts of soup ; use pood Madeira. Wine 
and catsup should no-i be added until a few minutes befora 
serving the soup. 



FISH 

15. To fry Fi»\. — Use for this purpose a frying-pan, spidei 
or iron ove: If the frying-pan is preferred, half fill tbi 
ressel with lard ; but if a larger and deeper vessel is used, 
have iard enough to cover the fish. The lard should be sweet 
■nd clean, and free from salt, as rancid lard imparts a disagree- 
able taste, and salt will prevent the article from browning. It is 
important to know when the lard is hot enough. If not hot 
enough, the fish will be pale and sodden. A good and easy way 
to ascertain this is to throw a small piece of bread into the 
vessel. If it fries crisp, the lard is ready ; if the bread burns, it 
is too hot. As soon as the fish is done, remove it to a soft cloth 
before the fire; turn once. This will absorb the grease; the 
grease otherwise would settle upon the lower pieces. Fish, to be 
in perfection, must be fresh. To ascertain this, examine the gills 
and eyes ; the former should be of a bright red, the latter bright 
and lively, and the flesh firm. The least taint about fish renders 
them worthless. Pond fish have an earthy, muddy taste. To 
extract this, soak them in salt and water. 

"Any person who has seen the process of evaporation going o* 
at the Salt Works, knows that the salt falls to the bottom. Just 
so it is in the pan where your mackerel lies soaking ; and as it 
lies with the skin side down, the salt will fall to the skin, au>> 
there remain ; when, if the flesh side were down, the salt falls tf 
the bottom of the pan, and the fish comes out fresh." — Southtrt 
Cultivator. 



26. To fry Shad. — Clean them thoroughly ; cut in slices of 
proper size to help at the table. Wipe each piece dry. Best

in bread crumbs. Shake off the loose crumbs, and fry in hot 
lard. Fry the thick parts a few minutes before putting ? .n the

mill the lard boils, or it will not be firm and crisp. II ihere an 
eggs or roe, fry them. Shad and other fish may be rolled ir 
corn meal, sifted fine, or in flour, before being fried. Either uaj 
is good. This receipt will answer for frying any kind of fish 
Very small fresh water fish may be cooked whole, and simply 
rolled in Indian meal, or fried plain. 

Trout black-fish, mullet, whiting, perch, sturgeon, and drum 
are all excellent cooked by either of the above receipts. Larg* 
fish should be cut into steaks or fillets. 



27. To fry Fillets of Fish. — Cut them in slices half an inch 
thick ; fry them plain, or in thin batter, or roll in Indian meal. 
Whole fish may be fried or boiled in plenty of boiling lard; when 
done, skin them, and serve immediately in a hot dish ; use piqu- 
ant sauce. 

28. To broil Fish. — If salt, take it from the brine ; wash it in 
two waters ; lay it in plenty of water (the inside down) to covet 
it well, to which add half a teacup of vinegar. If the fish is hard 
and dry, instead of the vinegar add a tablespoonful of soda ; 
change the water, if very salt. When sufficiently fresh to cook, 
remove it from the water. Wipe all fish, whether salt or fresh, 
rery dry before broiling. Have the gridiron prepared, by rubbing 
the bars bright; grease them with suet or lard, without the least 
smoke or blaze about it. When the gridiron is hot, place (he 
fish, skin side down, upon it, and turn it once. The dish 'o 
which the fish is to be served should be hot, and the moment tt 
is done send, without delay, to the table. A cold fish, served 
upon a cold dish, upon a cold day, is an unattractive dish, whrit 
with the proper attention a*id suitable accompaniments, it night

hand, for the benefit of those who prefer extempore seasoning (A 
that kind to the drawn butter. 



21). To Broil Salt Mackerel. — When it has soaked sufficiently, 
remove it from the water; always taste one of the tins to ascer- 
tain it fresh enough. Hang it to drain a short time; wipe the 
inside dry ; rub between the burs of the gridiron with beef suet, 
or a little nice lard. Be (wreful not to use much grease, or il 
will drip upon the coals and give a disagreeable taste to the fish 
Let the gridiron be hot, but not enough so to scorch. Lay the 
fish open, skin side down ; turn it once. When done, place ovei 
it a hot dish ; invert the gridiron; pour a small wineglass of 
boiling water over the fish. Let this remain fwe minutes; po\ii 
otT the water; butter it well; garnish with hard-boiled eggs, 
sliced, or use egg sauce, or season extempore with caviare, lem 
on juice, or any of the flavored vinegars preferred. Broil other 
salt fish in the same way.

It ng slit down the back bone on the inside, so that the fish vfill 
lie open without being split in two; dry it with a cloth; ?piin 
kle some salt over the fish, and let it lie until there is just t>im$ 
to cook it; for, to be eaten in perfection, it should go from the 
gridiron to the mouth. Have a clear brisk fire, without the 
least smoke. The gridiron being prepared as for the mack* rel,

kling a little flour on the inside, to prevent its sticking. "Whei 
done, place a hot dish over the fish, and invert the gridiron ; pour 
•vvei melted butter; garnish with parsley and lemon; scraped 
Horseradish is a good accompaniment. This receipt will an 
iwer for broiling any fresh fish. An excellent way for cooking 
fres'" fish, is b) semi-broiling. Place three or four muflin 
rings or a small trivet, in the bottom of a stove baking-pan ; 
pour iL a wineglass of water; butter the fish well; season with 
pepper aud salt ; place the pan in the oven of the stove ; baste 
the fish frequently, and turn once. The fish should be split open 
as in former receipts. If the fish is large, ci.t it in pieces; roll 
in meal or flour, and lay the slices in the pan with a little water; 
turn frequently, and baste often. The rings or skewers will not 
be needed when the fish is sliced. 



31. Another method of Broiling fresh Fish. — Take a fresh 
fish ; cut out the entrails, and without removing the scales, wash 
it clean ; dry it with a cloth ; put inside a seasoning of butter, 
pepper, and salt; wrap it in a wet sheet of foolscap paper, o T 
several if necessary ; cover it up in hot ashes. When the fish i 
done — strip the skin off and it is ready for the table. Sent, 
drawn butter to the table in a boat, to which add caviare, or any 
Rind of catsup preferred, or serve with lemon juice stirred into 
drawn butter. The dish upon which the fish is placed should be 
hot. 

Says Izak Walton: "Lyirg in water long, and washing the 
Mood out of the fish after the intestines are removed, abate* 
.nuch of their sweetness." 



92. Mrs. Hale's Receipt for Broiling Shad. — Empty and *ask 
the fish with care. Do not open it more than necessary to do 
Ihis ; fill it with f,rce-ment and its own roe. Oysters are good 
whor in season ; sew it up ; fasten with fine skewers securely ; 
wrap it in thickly buttered paper ; broil gently over solid coal* 
for one hour without the lua>*t smoke. 



FISH. 35 

33. Izalc Walton 1 s Receipt for Broiling Fresh Fun. — " \N hei 
you have scaled him, and cut off his tail and iins, and washed 
him very clean, then chine, or slit him thro' the middle as a salt 
fish is usually cut ; then give him three or four scotches acrosi 
the back with your knife ; broil him — no smoke must rise from 
the coals, all the time he is broiling; baste him with good sweet 
butter, and a little salt in the butter; add a little thyme 01 
parsley to the butter. Remember to wash the fish's throat 
clean ; do not wash him after he is opened. It is said that though 
some fish be light and easy of digestion, they are of all the ani- 
mal tribes, the most disposed to putrefaction. Acid sauces and 
piokles, by resisting putrefaction, are a proper addition to fish." 



34. To broil Smoked Fish — Wash it well in cold water ; wipe 
it dry ; broil on a hot gridiron, turning two or three times, when 
thoroughly hot', pour on it melted butter; pepper well ; garnish 
with parsley and lemon. A good breakfast dish. It is a good plan 
to let fresh fish lie several hours in the seasoning, before broiling ; 
each slice, if the fish is large, may be seasoned with butter, pepper 
salt, a little minced onion, or eschalot; wrap in buttered paper 
separately and broil ; turn out of the paper and serve with sauce. 



35. To Boil Fish. — Scale and clean the fish; cut open no 
more than is necessary to clean the inside well. Remove care 
full y all the black blood that attaches to the back bone ; lay the 
fish, if fresh, in salt and water twenty minutes, before cooking. 
This is a better plan than to add salt to the water in the kettle. A 
•mall piece of saltpetre (one-fourth of an ource to a gallon of 
**««r) put into the fish-kettle will make the fish firmer; use 
irater enough to cover the fish and no more ; cover with a close. 
nlting lia; simmer slowly ; skim as long as there is any diosi 
on the top. This is important, if you wish the fish to look white. 
To ascertain when the fish is done, try if the thickest part can be 
separated from the bone; in doing this be careful to disturb (he 
fwh as liUlftas possible. When done, remove from iho wtttei

in. mediately; every moment it remains will injure its condition. 
Should the fish be done before wanted, wrap around it a napkin 
wrung out in hot water. Suspend the strainer (if a fish-kettle ii 
used) over boiling water, placed across the kettle; the watet 
Tiust not touch it. Just before serving, immerse it for a moment 
r the boiling water over which it was suspended. When a fish 
kettle is not used, a piece of flat perforated tin, having a smal 
handle at each end, will answer in place of the strainer. Th€ 
fish should be boiled in a vessel just large enough to hold it with- 
out cramping, with a close, well-fitting cover. Serve with melted 
butter ; this is always made thicker than for meats, as it is dilut- 
ed with catsups or lemon juice. Whole fish are put to boil in 
warm water; fillets in hot water 

3$. A Greek cook says, " He cooked a pan fish so exquisitely 
that it turned him an admiring, grateful look from the frying- 
pan." This is the way he did it. The fish, after being nicely 
cleaned was rolled in bread-crumbs pounded fine (I prefer corn- 
meal.) Plenty of lard to cover the fish was brought to boiling- 
point. The fish was then plunged in, and turned frequently and 
carefully, watched tenderly, until a light brown color ; removed 
with a perforated flat clipper, and served upon a hot dish, with a 
napkin folded neatly in the bottom.

38. To Stew Fish. — Into one quart of hot water or broth out 
up a large onion, half a teaspoonful of black pepper beaten fin*. 
Boil these together until the onion is done. Lay the fish, proper 
ly cleaned and dusted with flour, in the fish-kettle or vessel in 
which it is to be cooked. Strain this broth to it ; season with 
salt ; simmer gently ; skim off any impurities that may rise. 
When the fish is done (one of moderate size will require twenty 
ninutes) pour off the gravy into a stew-pan ; rub into a table- 
spoonful of butter a dessert spoonful of flour ; add this to the 
gravy. Let this stew gently, stirring frequently, only five min. 
utes , take the fish up, place it in a hot dish and strain the gravy 
over it. Wine or catsup may be added to the gravy if liked. 



39, To Stew Catfish, Eels, Perch, etc. — After cleaning well, 
place the fish in the kettle ; strew over two large onions, cut up 
fine ; pepper and salt to taste ; cover with warm water ; set the 
kettle where it will simmer gently. Cut up very fine, four or five 
large sprigs of parsley ; add this to the fish. Pour into the stew- 
pan one pint of sweet cream or rich sweet milk ; add to this a 
teacup of butter into which has been rubbed a tablespoonful of 
flour ; place it on the fire for five minutes, shaking the pan fre 
quently. Take up the fish and pour the gravy over it. 



40. Mrs. R?s Receipt for Stewing Fish. — Scale and clean the 
Gsh well ; wipe dry and dredge with flour. Fry them in lard 
util half done and of a light brown color. Put them in a stew- 
par ; cover with boiling water. To half a pint of water add half 
* pint of wine or catsup ; a tablespoonful of lemon pickle cut up 
fine, cayenne pepper to taste; a large onion cut up, half a dozen 
cloves, a stick ol horseradish. Cover the pan close; simmer gen. 
tly until the fish is done. To ascertain this, draw a fin and 
taste it. T*ke the fish up in a hot dish ; thicken the gravy witfc 



38 MRS. hill's new cook bcok. 

flour rubbed into butter. Stew this a little and strain over th« 
fish ; send part of the gravy to the table in a tureen ; garniah 
with pickled mushrooms or scraped horseradish. 



11. Ti Bake Fish. — Clean nicely; keep on the head and fiiia; 
rj-jr inkle ligktly with salt; stuff with a rich force-meat and sew the 
tides together; wind tape around to prevent the parts from tear 
irg. Place on the bottom of the oven in which the fish is to );* 
baked, two or four skewers, crossed ; muffin-rings will answer, or 
a trivet. This will slightly elevate the fish and prevent its stick- 
ing or burning. Place the fish upon the skewers; pour into the 
oven a teacup of water. Bake in a moderate oven ; baste fre- 
quently, with lard at first, and then with its own drippings. Do 
not attempt to turn the fish ; an hour will bake a large fish if the 
fire is well managed ; bake slowly ; thicken the gravy with a lit- 
tle flour; if not rich enough, add butter and season with wine, 
caviare or any of the catsups or made sauces. A gill of 
wine will season a pint of gravy ; spices may be used if liked ; pep 
per and salt to taste. If the stove is used for baking, place the fish 
in a deep pan or brown stone dish ; first cover it all over with the 
yolk of an egg ; roll in fine bread crumbs, and put over this small 
pieces of butter ; pour into the stove-pan a little water, the quantity 
must depend upon the size of \he fish; bake slowly mid baste 
frequently ; caviare should be put upon the table to eat with the fish. 
A good stuffing for baked fish is, sliced light bread covered thick 
with butter, into which has been stirred well, pepper, one or two 
teaspoonfuls of French mustard ; saturate the bread with Sheny 
wine, trim otf the hard crust; cut the bread in proper slices for 
Is vini? inside of the fish. Omit the wine if not liked, and sub^iU 
tntc tomato or mushroom catsup. 



42. To Cook Salt Cod. — Soak the piece intended for ise \n 
plenty of tepid water, adding to each gallon of water a teacup of 
vinegar. If the fish Is very hard and dry, use a tables poonfu I of 
Baleratus or carbonate of soda to a gallon of water. Taste i u» 



ftsfi. 8* 

uf the flakes to ascertain when it is sufficiently fresh. Too n.uch 
making will render the fish insipid. To cook it, set it where it 
will heat gradually and simmer very gently. Boiling will mak* 
the fish hard and tough. Pick it, when done, in Hakes; lenove 
the skin, and poui over a rich egg and butter sauce. 



43. Codfish and Potatoes. — After the fish is done, pick it 'ion 
the bones as \\\\e as possible. Have ready as mueli cooked Irish 
potatoes as you have fish ; mash them fine with a little sweet 
cream, two or three hard-boHed eggs, chopped fine, and a little fine- 
ly minced onion, if the flavor is liked. To one pound of the mix 
ture add a wineglass of Madeira wine, and half a grated nutmeg; 
salt and pepper to taste; two tablespoonfuls of melted butter. 
Should the mixture be too stiff to form into cakes, moisten with 
a little more cream ; fry in lard. /ery little cooking is neces- 
sary. Or make this into a large oval cake ; put it in a baking- 
dish ; brush it over with melted butter ; strew over fine bread 
crumbs ; set it in the stove just long enough to brown. Send 
rich sauce in a boat to be eater, with this, when baked. If fried, 
no sauce is needed. 

Codfish is good baked after being boiled, and dressed with a 
rich sauce of cream, butter, and hard-boiled eggs ; rub a little 
flour into the butter. Parsley shred fine may be used, if 
liked. 



44. Cod Sounds and Tongues. — Cod sourds are the soft parti 
about the jowl of the fish, which are taken out, salted and bar- 
relled. If pickled, soak them all night in waim water; scrap* 
off the skin ; boil them in milk and water until tender; n\v.i 
done, drain them, and pour over hot egg and buttei sauce. 



45. Fish Cutlets. — Cut a large fish in slices a quarter of an 
inch thick; roll them in fine Indian meal, and fry in boiling lard; 
or dip them in beaten egg, and roll in line brca 1 crumbs; fry; 
garnish with parsley, and use any of the fisls sauces. Cutlet 



40 MRS hill's new cook book. 

may also be stewed and seasoned with parsley, thyme, oni«.a 
pepper, and salt. Very few minutes will be required to cook 
them. Serve with any good pickle. 



, 4G, Tc Souse Fish. — Boil the fish until done ; add a little saH 
lake equal quantities of the water it was boiled in and gooc nne 
jar. Season highly with pepper, cloves, allspice, and ruace; 
bcil the spices in the water until their strength is extracted. Cut 
off tne head and tail of the fish ; cut the rest in pieces ; pack close 
in a stone jar and pour over the vinegar. It must stand a day or 
two before using. Keep the jar, well covered, in a cool place. 
Should more vinegar be needed, add it cold. 



47. To Pot Shad and other Fish. — Wash the fish; lay it 
several hours in salt and water; cut it in slices to fit the jar in 
which it is to be potted. Prepare the spices by mixing three 
tablespoonfuls of salt, two of pepper, two of cinnamon, one of all- 
spice, one of cloves and mace. This will be sufficient to season 
five pounds of fish. Put in the jar a layer of fish, one of spicea } 
sprinkled over evenly ; sprinkle a little flour over ; strew over 
bits of butter; then another layer of fish and seasoning, and so 
on until the fish is all in ; pack down closely ; fill the jar with 
vinegar and water, half of each; cover the jar with a coarse crust 
made of flour and water, pressed close to the jar, that no steam 
may escape ; bake in a moderate oven six hours ; do not remove 
it from the jar until cold; slice cold for supper or luncheon; 
serve with lemon. 



48 Croquettes of Fish. — Mince cooked fish very fine ; removt 
il bones very carefully ; use three parts of bread crumbs ; season 
nighly with pepper salt and mace to taste ; add one egg, a little 
milk and flour ; work the mixture together ; form it into small 
cakes; roll them in beaten eggs, then in fine bread crumbs, ana 
6-v in hot lard. Make a gravy of the head, tail, and fins; boil 
and strain; rub a tablespoonful of butter into an even tables noon 



vsn. 41 

'ftil of flour; add this to the gravy. So id to the table in a gravy 
boat; garnish with sliced lemon, 

49, Salmon and Lobster Salad — If the salmon salad is madt 
if the fish preserved in cans, drain it from the oil ; mince ih# 
neat fine; cut up fine, without bruising, a third as much lettuct 
&t celery. For a box of salmon boil four eggs hard ; lay thorn 
in cold water a few minutes ; then shell them, and separate the 
whites from the yolks ; lay the whites aside ; mash the yolk* 
smooth with two tablespoonfuls of sweet olive oil or melted 
butter, or a teacup of sweet, rich cream ; the oil makes the 
smoothest and best paste. Strain this through a coarse sieve. 
Dissolve in a teacup of vinegar one teaspoonful of loaf sugar, one 
teaspoonful of salt, two of fine mustard ; pepper to taste ; mix this 
with the paste, and toss lightly over the meat with a silver fork. 
Ornament the dish in which *»t is served with the green leaves of 
the celery, or with curled parsley and the whites of the eggs cut 
into rings. Lobster salad is prepared in the same way. Take 
the nicest parts of the lobster. 



50. Fricassee Fish and Tomatoes. — If the fish is large, cut it in 
pieces; roll these in flour; season with salt and pepper; fry about 
half done, and of a light brown color; take the fish up and set it 
aside. Scald and skin six large tomatoes, more if they are small ; 
cut up a good-sized onion fine; mix with the tomatoes; fry thtso 
in butter, stirring them to prevent their scorching ; pour over tho 
tomatoes enough boiling water to make sauce for the fish ; add a 
wineglass of wine, if liked; put the fish in the stew par ; simmer 
In the gravy until done. Spices may be used, if liked. 



51 . To Hash Fish. — Take any kind of cooked fish (salt mackerel 
is very good prepared in this way) ; mince the meat fne and 
■eason with pepper; have a third as much Irish potatoes cooked 
and mashed, as there is fish; cut up fine three hard-boiled eggs • 
■tir this mixture together; into a stew-pan put a tumbler of boj 



42 mrs. hill's new cook book. 

mg water, a large tablespoonfjl of butter; stir the fish into the 
stew-pun, and allow it to simmer until thoroughly hot; serve in a 
hoi, covered dish. This is a nice breakfast dish, and should not 
be prepared until the last moment. Cold fish may also be iuad« 
it to a pillau ; remove all banes; cook the rice, and add the fisr 
railed into flakes, just long enough to become hot; season hig 
ffith cayenne pepper. Some persons like mace. This may In 
mad or not, as may be preferred. 



52. Chowder. — Cover the bottom of the pot in which the chow 
der is to be cooked with slices of pickled pork, or, if preferred, 
use a large tablespoonful of lard. Take any kind of firm fish 
(cod and bass are thought best) ; lay them over the pork or in 
the lard. If pork is used, first fry it slightly ; if lard, make it 
boiling hot. Strew over the fish a layer of chopped onions, one 
of split crackers, pepper and salt ; spices are used, if liked, but 
are not necessary ; another layer of fish, onions, crackers, and 
seasoning, until all the fish is in; dredge with flour; just cover 
the fish with water ; stew gently ; half an hour will cook one of 
moderate size. Take up the chowder ; thicken the gravy by adding 
* tablespoonful of flour to a teacup of butter; add this to the 
gravy ; stew two minutes ; add wine or catsup if liked. Oyste* 
or clam chowder may be made in the same way. 



53. Eels. — Dr. Kitchiner's Receipt for Stewing Eels. — Kill them 
by piercing the spinal marrow, close to the back part of the skull, 
witn a sharp-pointed skewer. If done in the right place, all 
motion will instantly cease. There is certainly less torture by 
this method than to cut and skin them alive. Rub them with 
lalt until the slime is cleansed from them ; wash them in several 
waters; divide their, in pieces about four inches long; lay thi 
pieces in a stew-pan. If a large eel, pour on it a quart of cold 
^ter, two onions, and let it stew twenty minutes ; strain thi 
gravy into a small stew-pan ; make it thick as cream with flour 
%dd a seasoning of pepper, salt, Port wine, and mushrocm catsup 



pour this over the eel ; stew two minutes, and send tc the tabU 
hot, 

54. Tc Fry Eels. — Skin them; wash well; season with peppei 
tnd salt; roll each piece in line Indian meal; fry in boiling lai j 
or egg them, and roll in bread crumbs, and t'vy. For sauce, u* 
melted butter, sharpened with lemon juice. 



55. To Broil Eels. — Skin and wash them ; dry them, after cut 
ting in pieces; sprinkle salt and pepper upon them. Pit them in 
an oven with a wineglass of water, a large spoonful of butter ; 
baste with this frequently. Just before serving, strew ove»* bread 
crumbs, a little chopped parsley, salt and pepper: put on the 
oven lid heated with coals, and brown a light color. 



56. To Dress Turtle Steaks. — The steaks are taken from the 
thick part of the turtle fins ; season them well with pepper, salt, 
and mace. Then flour them, and fry quickly in butter and lard 
mixed together. When fried, pour a little w r ater on them, and 
let them simmer for a quarter of an hour. Just before serving, 
squeeze a lemon over the steaks. 



57. Lobster. — Have ready a pot of boiling water; salt th* 
water, a tablespoonful to one gallon; tie the claws »>l" the lobster, 
and put him in the pot of boiling water head foremost. Sa\« 
Mrs. Hale: " Many people are shocked at the apparent cruelty 
of killing them in this way, but death takes place immediatt lv t 
and life cannot be taken away without pain." This is certaii:!* 
taking a very philosophic view of the subject, and if lobstcrt 
could reason, would no doubt be consolatory as they take th 
awful plunge. Boil briskly for half an hour; take them from the 
water and let them drain ; cut off the head and smal] claws the} 
are never used ; crack the shell slightly ; remove the meat care 
fully, and serve hot with drawn butter, lemon juice, or either o/ 
the flavored vinegars; they require & piquant sauce. 



44 

Lobste/s may be served in a variety of ways- -boiled, made hits 
salad, lobster pie, or lobster soup — and rray be prepared by any 
of the fish receipts. The male lobster I best for boiling, and is 
knovvr by the tail being narrower and 'he flesh firmer than the te 
en ale. The hen is preferred for salad and sauces, on account of 
the coral. It gives a beautiful red color to sauces. The lobster 
leems rather an extraordinary creature, having some decided 
peculiarities. It has the power of reproducing horns and claws 
" Its flesh is in its tail and feet, and its stomach is in its head." 
There is a vein running in the back of the head called " ladies' 
finger," which is said to be poisonous ; hence the importance of 
removing the head. The coral must not be boiled : this wouM 
spoil the beautiful red color which makes it valuable for orna 
menting sauces. Beat the coral with butter in a marble mortar; 
rub it through a sieve, and either stir it to the sauce or mix it with 
the lobster, merely putting it on the fire a few minutes to heat. 



58. Mrs. K?s Receipts for Cooking Shrimps, Crabs and Terra* 
pins. — Shrimp Patties. — Chop or grind one soup-plate of peeled 
shrimps; moisten with water one tumblerful of grated light 
bread, first removing the crust ; mix well with the shrimps until 
a smooth paste is formed ; add a heaped-up tablespoonful of 
butter, a teaspoonful of mixed mustard, salt, cayenne, and black 
pepper to taste, and half a grated nutmeg ; make into small cakes 
and fry in butter or lard, a light brown color. 



59. Shrimp Pie. — To two quarts of peeled shrimps add two 
lahlespoonfuls of butter, half a pint of tomato catsup, half a tum- 
bler of vinegar; season high' with black and cayennr pepper; 
ealt to taste; put into an earthen dish; strew grated biscuit, oi 
light bread crumbs very thickly over the top; bake slowly half 
in hour. This may be varied by using Irish potatoes boiled 
*nd mashed, in place of the bread crumbs ; or use a layer of 

/imps, then macaroni, previously soaked in hot sweet milk.

60 To Pickle Shrimp*. — Peel the fhrimps ; put them in an 
anglazed jar; first a layei of shrimps, then one of mixed spices, 
pepper and salt, until all the shrinks are in. Pour in a little

spice and nutmeg may be used if liked; stir the mixture well ; 
scrape and clean two of the backs ; line them with pufT-paste ; fill 
<v ith the mixture ; cover over with bread crumbs, and bake until a 
ilirht brown. 



63. Crabs in the Back. — Boil the crabs ; pick the meat from 
hi bones. To two dozen crabs, add four tablespoonfuls of fresh 
dive oil, one tablespoonful of mixed mustard ; season high 
tah black and red pepper; clean the backs well, and fill as 
aany a» may be needed with the mixture ; cover with bread 
crurubs and bits of butter, and bake. Crabs are boiled alive ap 
the lobster, and "the vein upon the back" must also be removed. 
They require more cooking than the lobster. Th°y may b* 
itewed. and are considered good cold, minced very fir.e and ' -°^

cate vinous taste to the whole ; stir frequently and thoroughly., 
and serve very hot. 

65. Clams — Are hard and soft-shelled. They may be cooked 
in a variety of ways, using the receipts for lobster, oyster and 
fish. They are used for pies, soup, fritters, salad, chowder, etc 

To stew them, wash the clams, wipe the shells, and put them it» 
a kettle, with the edges downwards ; cover with water; boil ovei 
a brisk fire half an hour; turn out of the shells ; put into a stew

gridiron upm a bed of solid coals and lay them upon this, or they 
may be placed immediately upon the coals. As soon as the shell* 
are hot and open slightly, take them up with oyster-tongs ; pro

tecl the hand wilh a thick napkin, and carofull^ open the shell so 
as ;o preserve the delicious juice; season with a little butter, 
pepper, salt, and vinegar if liked. Says Dr. Kitohiner: "The »e 
*U<» wish to enjoy this delicious bivalve in perfection, must eat it 
Ibe moment it is opened, with its own gravy in the under sht II • 
J not eaten absolutely alive its spirit and flavor are lost." Oyster 
Ji ngs for taking up the shells, oyster- knives for forcing them open, 
1> a kets to receive the empty shells, and thick napkins to protect 
the hands, are usually furnished with the oysters. 



67. To Stew Oysters. — Strain the liquor so as to remove every 
fragment of shell. Mix in equal proportions sweet mi'k and 
the oyster liquor. Add to a quart of the liquor a teacup of finely 
pulverized bread or cracker crumbs; season with salt and pee-

mace is the best spice for oysters. 



68. Oysters a-la-blaze. — Place a chafing-dish upon the table 
with the lamp burning; pour in the oyster liquor ; season with 
butter, salt, and pepper ; when hot add the oysters ; cover with 
the chafing-dish cover, and stew fifteen minutes ; beat two eggs

lard; when of e • light brwn color, they are done. Lay a soft 



48 MRS. HILL*8 NEW COOK BOOK. 

napkin in a flat dish and seive the oysters upon this; they will 
be too greasy if not served upon a napkin, particularly those that 
ue at the bottom oi the dish. 

A nother way to fry them is to dip them in the yolk :>f an egg 
in-i afterwards roll them in bread crumbs or corn meal and fry 
a hot lr,rd ; always wipe each oyster dry before dipping u va 
brtjad crumbs or egg. If gravy is liked, pour a little of the oys- 
ter liquor into the frying-pan ; let it boil up just a minute, and 
serre in a sauce-boat. Never pour gravy over anything fried in 
batter, it gives it a sodden appearance. The largest should be 
used for frying. 



70. To Broil Oysters. — Wipe them dry ; dip each one in the 
beaten yolk of an egg ; roll in very tine bread or cracker crumbs, 
first seasoning them with salt and pepper. Have ready pieces of 
trell-buttered foolscap papei cut large enough to roll each oyster 
in a separate piece ; twist the ends of the paper securely and lay 
them upon a gridiron, sufficiently elevated to secure them from 
scorching until hot. Have ready the dish upon which they are 
tc be served hot with a tablespoonful of butter ; turn upon it the 
oysters, roll them in the butter and serve immediately ; use an 
extempore seasoning of caviare, lemon-juice, or celery vinegar, as 
.jay be preferred. 



71. To Scallop Oysters. — Grease scallop shells or an eaithei 
baking-dish ; put in a layer of bread crumbs, pepper and salt an<j 
thin slices of butter; then a layer of oysters; repeat this unt' 
the oysw,rs are in, using a layer of bread crumbs last with bits of 
butter over; season with wine and spices, or celery vinegai 
Scallops are also good made with layers of Irish potatoes mashe* 
and highly seasoned, a layer of each, beginning and ending wiv* 
potatoes ; lay over a few bits of Gutter, add oyster liquor enou^ 
to moister. the mixture, and bake a few minutes. Toinatoe* an 
good us°.d in this way ; use very little liquor.

72 Oyster Patties.— Scald together a pint of oyster liquor 
ihreo blades of mace, six cloves, and the same of allspice ; put 
into a stew-pan a large tablespoonful of fresh butter. Season a 
pint of oysters with salt and pepper to taste ; add them to the 
butter, set the stew-pan on the stove; as the butter melts, stit 
hem carefully; when the butter is hot, but not boiling, pour tin 
oyster liquor in ; stir all together and let it stew fifteen minutes; 
set this aside in an earthen vessel. Have patty pans lined witfi 
puff paste : bake them a light brown color ; just before serving, 
fill these with the oysters. They should be eater immediately, 
as the gravy, by soaking in, will render the pastry heavy. 

73. Dressing for Cove Oysters. — Put one pint of milk on, 
lot it come almost to a boil, beat two eggs, stir into the milk; 
add mustard, salt, pepper, and vinegar to taste. 



73J. Oyster Sausages. — One pint of oysters, large slice of 
veal, grind them ; half as much bread-crumbs ; season, salt and 
pepper, make in cakes, dip in egg, roll in flour and fry. 



74. Ti Pickle Oysters. — For this purpose use large oysters ; 
pick out all pieces of shell ; put them in a clean pot, and to every 
half gallon of the liquor put a half teaspojnful of red pepper, one 
of black, and a grated nutmeg, two tablespoonfuls of salt ; add as 
much vinegar as liquor ; simmer them five minutes. Take them 
up upon large flat dishes with a perforated skimmer. Let the 
liqjor stew a few minutes longer. When the oysters are cold 
,)ut them into cans or unglazed jars and pour over the liquor 
To be eaten cold. Garnish the dish with celery, parsley, oi l«mona 
aa may be preferred.

75. To Feed Oysters. — Mix salt with clean water in the pto 
portion of a pint of salt to two gallons of water: change it in 
twsD*j-four hours. They are good as long as they keep firmly 
closed ; when they are lightly closed or at all gape, suspect their 
•edition, and have nothing to do with them. 



70 Tl Keep Fish Fresh. — After cleaning the fish, spread over 
t a mixture of one teaspoonful of finely pulverized black pepper, 
oue of fine salt, the same of brown sugar ; wipe the fish perfectly 
dry to prevent its moulding; spread this mixture over evenly, 
and set it in a cool place. This quantity will be sufficient for a 
large shad, and will preserve it two days, if put on immediately. 



77. To Cook Frogs. — Only the hind legs of the large green 
kind are used ; skin them ; season with salt and pepper, and broil 
r fry them ; the meat is beautifully white ; the taste delicate. 



78. Mock Oysters. — Take brains from the heads of hogs, as 
whole as possible; remove the skin and throw them into salt and 
water; let them remain in this two hours; then bo.l them, until 
done, in sweet milk; take them up in an earthen bowl or dish, 
and pour over weak vinegar to cover them ; prepare sufficient 
vinegar to cover them, by adding to it cloves, allspice, and cinna 
inori to taste; season well with pepper, using part red pepper \ 
scald this vinegar; pour off the weak vinegar; cover with tha 
jpiced vinegar. Eat cold, or stewed with crackers as ouster*.

■' There is death in the pot n 

"Cookery, pre per y considered," writes a distinguished pii/*i 
d«n, " is an art, and one of the highest and most useful of the arts, 
based on chemical science, and closely related to physiology and 
hygiene. It is not well understood among us, and, with the 
grea est abundance and variety of the raw material for good 
IrViig with which any nation was ever blessed, we continue to 
live worse than any civilized people on the face of the earth. If 
theie is 'death in 'the pot' (and who can doubt it who has an 
extrusive acquaintance with the cooking of the country?) it is» 
through our own mixing and marring that it has generated 
there. It has resulted from our unscientific manipulations. In 
the preparation of food three grand objects ought to be kept in 
view : first, to retain all its nutritive and other valuable dietetic

79. Boiling Meat. — Salt meat, meat for soup, and large fish, 
should be put to boil in cold water. Should poultry or fresh 
meat, not intended for soup, be put to boil in cold or boiling 
water? This is a "vexed question." Says Professor Liebig: 
" If a piece of fresh meat be put into cold water, and this heated 
to boiling, and boiled until 'done, 1 it will become harder, aid 
have less taste than if the same piece had been thrown into waU»f 
already boiling. In the tirst case, the matters grateful to the 
•mell and taste go into the extract, viz. : the soup; in the second, 
the albumen of the meat coagulates from the surface inward, and 
envelopes the interior with a layer, which is impermeable to 
#ater. In the latter case, the soup will be indifferent, the meal

delicious." Opposed to this is the authority of Dr. Kitchiner 
lie directs that fresh meat be put in cold water. " Let the watei 
heat gradually, according to the thickness of the article. For in 
stance, a leg of inulton of ten pounds weight, should he placed 
upor. a moderate fire, which will gradually make the water hot 
wr&oi- causing it to boil, for about forty minutes; if the watei 
bov.a much sooner, the mea'. will be hardened, and shrink up as 
if serened; by keeping the water a certain time heating without 
boiling, the fibres of the meat are dilated, and it yields a quantity 
of scum, which must be taken off as soon as it rises." 

I consider Dr. Kitchiner the wisest and most reliable writer 
upon the subject of cookery I have ever read. For over thirty 
years his " Cook's Oracle " has been my favorite text-book, and 1 
gratefully acknowledge my obligations to him. But, while I re- 
gard. it as a kind of heresy to differ from the Doctor in any of 
his opinions, and have seldom found it to my advantage to do so, 
yet 1 must, in the point at issue, assert, as the result of my expe- 
rience, that a middle course is best, securing sufficiently ail the 
advantages. The water should be hot but not boiling. To im- 
merse the meat at once in boiling water, contracts the outer skin 
so rapidly as to toughen the skin, and the meat parts with few of 
its impurities. When hot water is used, raise it slowly to the 
boiling point. Gentle stewing and boiling is always best. Cover 
the article to be boiled with water. A good proportion is a 
quart of water to a pound of meat. While it is necessary, the 
meat should be covered with water during the whole process ; it 
must not hav» more than is necessary. " The less water, pro 
vided the meat be covered with it, the more savoury will be the 
meat, and the better will be the broth." The ves« el in which the 
meat is placed should be well adapted to the size of the meat— 
•ot so large as to require too much water, nor so small as to 
iramp the article to be cooked. It should have a well-fitting 
cover, and be kept on during the process, removing it occasion* 
ally (always dust it first) to skim the liquor. 

•\ttci.d well to the skimming, and remove carefully all ink

purities as fast as they rise. It is important to have this well at 
tended to, or the meat will not make a good appearance. Should 
the water become two much reduced before the meat is done, 
replenish with boiling water ; always keep a kettle of hot water 
o meet this and other demands. When boiling fresh meat., it m 

good plan to place on the bottom of the pot, skewers crossed, 
mi if fin- rings, a trivet, or plate inverted (either of these will an- 
swer), so as to elevate it a few inches, and render the meat lesi 
liable to scorch. The pot should never boil over ; thereby excel 
lent broth is lost, which a frugal good cook will always convert 
into a savory soup. Says Dr. Kitchiner : " It is a waste of fuel 
to put it under a boiling pot. If a vessel containing water, bo 
placed over a steady fire, t»»e water will grow continually hotter, 
until it reaches the limit of boiling, after which the regular ac- 
cessions of heat are wholly spent in converting it into steam." 
Count Uumford, in one of his essays, says: "It is natural to 
suppose that many of the finer and more volatile parts of food, 
those which are best calculated to act on the organs of taste, 
must be carried off with the steam, when the boiling is violent." 
A perfect knowledge of the time required for cooking meat, as it 
depends upon so many circumstances, can only be acquired by 
practice and close observation. If proper attention is paid to 
the fire, and the pot really boils, twenty-five minutes to the pound 
will be sufficient, counting from the appearance of the first bub 
ble, for salt meat ; twenty minutes for fresh. Salt meat requires 
more time than fresh ; and more time is required in cold t*mn 
warm weather. 

Should meat freeze, thaw it before cooking, by immersin^ » 
in cold water, or it will be tough. 

Never let meat or poultry remain in the broth ater it is don» 
It should be served as soon as ready for the table, or it will d% 
come sodden. 



80. To Boil a Ham.~- Although then' are v?'y few Southern 
kitchens in which the pot is net made to boil every day, yet in 



54 MRS. hill's new cook BOOK. 

the fewest number is it well done. The process is simpl* 
enough, and tbn failures are the result of irregularity and inafr 




Carre— Cut in the line B, C. 

trntion The cook, as a general thing, places her pot o?er a 
fierce fire, which starts the water boiling with a gallop. The 
scum rises to the top, and is permitted to remain. Othei btisi 
ness engages her attention The pot for awhile is forgotten, and 
when at length it is remembered, and looked into, the liquor 
is found too much reduced. This is replenished with cold water, 
the fire is stirred, and the boiling goes on through the same process. 

With this kind of management, is it strange that even our fa- 
vorite every-day dish of boiled ham, is seldom put upon the 
table well cooked ? 

After washing and scraping the ham well, place it in a vessel 
that will hold it without cramping, and cover every part of it, 
and three inches over, with cold water ; boil slowly and steadily. 
A ham weighing ten pounds will require four hours. They 
are seldom boiled long enough. Be sure the pot boils ; skim 
frequently ; keep the pot well covered ; avoid piercing the meat ; 
thi? makes unsightly marks and lets out the juices. When d<>no 
l&) the ham, before skinning, in a stove-pan, and set it in iht 
dven ; half an hour's baking will improve it. After the ham a 
taken up, cabbage, greens, beans, etc., may be boiled in tti 
broth It is not proper to boil cabbage, or any kind of greens 
with the ham, as they impart a disagreeable taste to the meat. 
An old salt ham should be soaked several hours before boiling. 
After being skinned, hams may be ornamented in different waya. 



MEATS. 55 

Brush over the top with the beaten yolks of eggs ; sift over fine 
eracker or bread crumbs evenly ; bake half an hour in a inod< rate 
oven, or cover with a thin coat of Irish potatoes, rubbed through 
t colander. Set it for a few minutes in the oven. When to be 
axed for party occasions, and it is desired to make them parti** 
larlf, jiae, the skin may be permitted to remain; cut this t 
diain >i d shapes with a sharp knife, leaving the skin on alternate 
ly ; fill the skinned shapes with grated yolks of hard-boiled eggs, or 
grated carrots or beets; trim the dish with celery tops. Another 
w ay : Skin the ham ; lay it off in diamond shapes with cloves, 
sticking the stems into the meat; fill alternately with the grated 
yolks and whites of hard-boiled eggs; be careful not to mis 
them ; garnish the dish with green sprigs of parsley. They are 
very pretty ornamented with flowers cut from vegetables ; make 
red roses of beets; yellow of carrots; white with turnips; use 
curled parsley or mustard for leaves ; wrap the knuckle with 
fringed letter paper. 



81. Miss F.'s Receipt for Preparing Whole Hams for Parties. 
— Boil them very done, and skin them ; when cold, cut through the 
nam in slices to the bone ; but do not cut the slices from the bone. 
Between each slice, put thin slices of pickle, and detach the 
slices as needed. The ham dressed by either of these receipts 
will show to better advantage by being slightly elevated above 
the dish ; garnish with celery tops or something green. 

These last receipts are entirely for ornament. If " good wine 
needs no bush " a well-cured, well-boiled ham needs no ornament 
to secure general appreciation. White cabbage, beans, peas 
IiUh and sweet potatoes are good accompaniments. Save th 
essence or gravy of the ham for the soup kettle. 



82. To Know when Hams are Sound. — Stick a sharp knife to *Jmi 
boue in the thickest part of the ham, and also run it around the 
knuckle. If there is any taint, you can detect it by smelling and 
ex a i. lining the knife. 



56 MRS. HILL 8 NEW COOK HOOK. 

83. To laze a Ham. — Brush over the ham (using a feather oi 
brush) wi*Ji the yolk of an egg-, cover thickly with brea.1 
crumbs. Go over it with thick cream ; put it in the stove oi 
i.vcn to Drown; put the glaze on half an inch thick ; if necesaarj 
g ) over the second time. 



84. To Boil a Leg of Pork. — Pork requires longer tx ilii>$ 
than any other meat. If it has been salted six or eight days, 
soak it an hour before cooking; scrape and wash it carefully; 
singe off any hairs with a piece of burning paper or corn shuck. 
Avoid making incisions about the knuckle; this lets out the 
ju-ce. Put it to boil with the water warm only ; boil slowly and 
steadily, skimming carefully ; keep the cover on ; this will not 
only keep out the smoke, but retain much of the nutritive pro 
perties of the meat ; should the least dross remain upon the meat 
when done, scrape it again. It should go to the table white, 
clean, and thoroughly done, and yet not boiled until the meat 
drops from the bone. This is good cold, or slightly broiled and 
buttered. A peas pudding, from time immemorial, has been 
considered the proper accompaniment for this dish ; boiled tur- 
nips, dressed with butter and cream, are also excellent ; when 
cold, nothing can be better than chow or French mustard as an 
accompaniment. 



85. To Boil a Leg of Mutton. — The mutton should be fat ; 
unless it is, I would advise its being cr oked some other w ay ; 
very few things are more insipid than poor boiled mutton, if 
should be killed the evening before it is to be cooked. For ri>a*»w 
mg it may be kept longer; but for boiling, if kept, the meat viD 
be dark. To prevent it being discolored by the action of \he lii 
tie it in a bag, and suspend it until needed. Put it in a Iaig« 
stew-pan or boiler; cover with water merely warm ; boil stead 
ily; skim well, and keep it well covered. Some persons boil >c 
a well -floured cloth, tying it at the ends; this is superfluous \i 
the water is kept well .skimmed : put in salt when the meat is hull 



MEATS. 51 

ioae. A leg weighing toL pounds will require throe hours 1 
steady simmering; take it up as soon as done; ser\e with caper 
or egg sauce ; or make a rich gravy of some of the broth ; add 
SMisrry wine and tomato catsup to taste; butter, if needed. 



80. 7b Boil a Loin of Mutton. — Skin the loin; remove all 
i no ; crack the bones ; put them with the skin in a stew pan, and 
Dovei with cold water; cut up fine three sprigs of parsley, tho 
same of thyme, and one large onion; put them into the stew-pan 
with the bones; pepper and salt to taste; let this stew gently 
until all the gravy is extracted from the bones and skin. Put the 
mutton on in a vessel large enough to hold it, having a well-fitting 
cover; pour upon it a pint of warm water, half a pint of good to- 
mato catsup ; cover it, and let it boil gently three hours, turning it 
over frequently. Just before the mutton is done, strain over it the 
gravy from the bones; let all stew together five minutes. Some 
persons prefer wine to the catsup ; when used, take a tumblerful 
of good Madeira wine; scald two blades of mace, half a dozen 
cloves, a dozen grains of allspice in it, and add to the mutton half 
an hour before it is done, and use a tumblerful more of water when 
it is first put to boil. Lamb may be boiled by either of these 
receipts, but is not good boiled, unless very fat and well grown. 



87. To Boil a Loin of Veal. — Take ten pounds of the best part 
of the loin , bind the flap around with broad tape; place it in the 
kettle, and manage as directed for mutton; take it up as soon as 
Irne or the meat will lose its freshness and firmness. Being an 
n^ipid meat, a highly-seasoned gravy is necessary; oyster sauce 
nay be used, also onion or tomato sau~e. The loin is generally 
•steemed the best part of the calf. Veal should be kept sua 
ponded in a bag, and wiped very dry. It taints very easily. 
Though -ften boiled, it is better roasted or stewed. 



88. To Boil a Calf's Head. — After being well cleaned, it is tost 
fc» ke**p the skin on ; it will require an hour longer in caking whei

the skiii is retained. The head should be fat. Cut apfcrr n« hppei 
and lower jaws ; remove the eyes ; they are never used. Take ( ut 
the bone containing the teeth, also the nose and ears; cut out tne 
tongue; remove the brains; put the head and tongue to boil ir 
enough warm water to cover them; tie the brains in a cloth 
l>cil all until tender; vegetables may be boiled with the head 
jf liked — onions, carrots, parsley, and thyrre; serve the heaa 
upon one dish ; upon another place the tongue and brains, or make 
sauce of the brains ; take a pint of the broth, put it in a stew-pan ; 
add a tablespoonful of parsley chopped fine ; salt and cayenne 
pepper to taste ; let these stew a quarter of an hour ; add a large 
tablespoonful of butter, into which has been rubbed a dessert- 
spoonful of flour ; stew this five minutes, and serve with the 
head ; use the remainder of the broth for soup. It is the basis of 
mock turtle soup. Season the brains with sage, if the flavor is 
liked ; garnish with lemon. 

89. Beef Bouilli. — Take five or six pounds of good, tender 
Deef from the rump, brisket, or long ribs; the rump or round is 
best. Put a trivet or muffin-rings on the bottom of a deep stew 
pan or pot ; cover with warm water two inches deep ; boil rathei 
briskly until the water is clear ; skim closely ; then put in three 
or four large turnips sliced, two carrots grated, two onions cut 
up fine, a tablespoonful each of parsley and thyme, chopped fine 
Let the pot stand where the water will simmer gently and steadily 
until the meat is tender; take up the meat; put as much of tin 
broth into a stew-pan as is needed for gravy; rub to a large 
tablespoonful of butter a heaped teaspoonful of flour; put this 
into the stew-pan; stew five minutes; add to the gravy a good 
seasoning of tomato or mushroom catsup; lay the vegetables 
around the meat; use the broth for soup, after taking out enougk 
foi gravy; a dish of ti nips may be served with this. 

00. To Boil Corned Btcf. — Soak the beef over night in plenty 
•f water to cover it well. At nine o'clock next morning, wash ili«

piece lull, put it hi the pot and cover with cold watei ; b< il slow 
lv ; sk.ni frequently. If it is to be served cold, let it remain in 
the jx>t until it becomes sc. 

To prepare it for luncheon or as a supper dish, rem< ve all the 
boaes when thoroughly done, pick the meat as for salad and pack 
ji a deep dish, putting in alternately fat and lean. Skim th 
liquor, removing all fat ; boil this broth until reduced one half; pout 
Into the dish as much of it as may be needed to fill all the spaces 
left in packing the meat; lay over this a flat cover that will just 
fit it, place a heavy weight upon this. It is best to prepare this 
dish in cold weather, or put upon ice the dish it was prepared in. 
Serve it upon a plate or round dish, and garnish with green sprigs 
of parsley, or celery ; serve with it chow, picillilla or any good 
pickle. French mustard is excellent eaten with it. 



91. To Boil a Salt Tongue. — Soak it over night in plenty of 
water. Put it to boil in sufficient cold water to cover it; while 
Doiling, if it is too salt, change the water; it requires long boil- 
nig. Ascertain when it is done by running a small skewer .1. ; 
skin it carefully, remove the rough part of the root, and gai rush 
the dish with parsley. Slice round. This is eaten hot as a dinner 
dish, or cold for supper. Smoked tongue is prepared in the same 
way. Be sure they are boiled until tender ; a fresh tongue must 
be first boiled and then dipped in beaten egg, rolled in bread 
crumb * and baked in a pan. Pour in a tumbler of the broth it was 
boiled in; baste well with butter; half an hour will be sufficient 
lime for it to bake. Reason the gravy with any good catsup. 



92 To Boil Cow-heel. — After being well cleaned bcil them un 
til the bones can be removed easily ; skin them and serve with 
parsley and onion sauce.

it is g»d fried, after being boiled, or stewed tid dressed with 
cream and butter; cut it in pieces of convenient o»ze for serving 



93. To Boil Tripe. — As soon as possible aft<:r-the animal it 
kill e<f , have the stomach emptied and well washed in cold water; 
prinkle lime or ashes over the inside, fold it carefully and lay i\ 
m a jar or smaL ruo ; cover it with tepid water for six hours ; 
scrape off all the dark part. When all this is removed, wash ia 
several waters and again lay the tripe away for a daj and night 
in weak salt water (use another jar than the one n.-at used, or 
scald that well and sun it). Boil the tripe (putvng to it cold 
water) until a straw can be easily run through it and the edges look 
transparent; skim closely, and when the tripe is tender, take it 
up and cut it in uniform slices of convenient size for serving ; 
pour over milk, or milk and water, to cover it, and keep it closely 
covered ; should the milk turn a little sour it will not injure the 
tripe, as it is usual to add vinegar in cooking it. It should not be 
kept long ; either fry, stew, or make into a pillau or hash. When 
made into hash, use onion freely and cover over with pickle. 




94. To Boil a Turkey. — Truss ; t with the legs drawn in ; skewei 

the wings; remove the skewers 
before serving. For boiling, se- 
lect a fowl of fair skin; aftei 
cleaning it well, if young and 
the weather is cold, sprinkle a 
little salt on the inside, and either 
put it in a bag and suspend it or wrap it carefully in a clean 
Cloth and turn it over after it has lain four or five hours ; neither 
poultry nor fresh meat for boiling can be kept so long as lor 
roasting ; the meat wi'l not look white. 

When the hour for putting it in the pot arrives, stuff it with t 
rich stuffing previously prepared in the following manner: half & 
pound of bread crumbs, large heaped tablespoonful of butter, the 
soft part at" twenty or thirty oysters (according to the size of the 



MEATS. 61 

turkey), season with pepper find salt; mix these intimatrlj and 
carefully. For variety, I sometimes season with mace or nutmeg 
aiiJ a few cloves. After stuffing the fowl well, but not too full — a 
little room should be left for the force-meat to swell — cutoff the 
;te'.;>. o >ne ; put in a little stuffing, enough to give the craw a plump 
;n->k; draw over the skin tightly and tie securely; dredge thf 
t< > * ] v. ell with flour ; place a trivet or muffin-rings in the bottom j 
the vessel ; lay the turkey upon them and cover with warm water. 
Place the pot where it will boil gently and equally ; skim closely 
until the water is very clear. Replenish if necessary with boii 
ing water. A large turkey will require two hours and a half 
steady boiling; keep it well covered through the process. Serve 
with oyster sauce, or any kind of rich white sauce. 

Poultry for boiling should be very fat ; when the fowl is old, 
rub the inside with soda instead of salt as soon as it is killed ; 
wash it off before cooking. 



95. To Boil Ducks or Chickens. — Kill them over night ; wrap 
them closely with cloths. If a little old, rub the inside with soda ; 
early next morning lay the fowls in a deep pan and cover witb 
milk and water, or water only, if it is not convenient to use u. ilk 
Boil by the d ctions for boiling a turkey, and use stuffing or not 
as may be ) d. A good stuffing may be made of mashed 1 /ish 
potato, seaf v jd with a little onion, butter, salt and pepper, moist- 
ened with .. rtle sweet milk, or rilled with oysters, chopped. Boil 
until ten a . the time will depend upon the age of the fowl ; half 
an hour is generally sufficient; but never send them to tabh un- 
derdone. Serve with parsley and butWr sauce, egg or onion vine*, 
vomit.) or oyster sauce, as may be preferred. A druble kettle an 
**v,rs admirablv for boiling them; unless fowls are fat, n**ei 
boil them. 



00. A Delicate Way to Cook Fowls, Rabbit, Veal, or Lamb.— Keep 
the meat until tender. Cut it in pieces proper for serving, if 
meat, or \ njoint if a fowl. In '.he bottom of a double kettle oi

Slid tie over a oladder or very thiek piece of cloth fllded se\era, 
tircej so that the steam will not escape. (If the double kettle it 
usee the water and cloth are unnecessaiy.) Place the jar into 
pot of water that will come within five or six inches of the top, 
just as near the top as possible without the water getting ir.to 
the jar ; let the pot boil until the meat is done, but not overdone. 
Strain the gravy into a stew-pan ; thicken sufficiently with flour ; 
stew five minutes and pour over the meat. Wine and spices 
may be used for invalids, omitting the onion. 



97. To Blanquette Chicken. — Prepare the chicken (which 
should be young and fat) as for boiling; dredge it well with 
flour ; make a rich crust (potato is best) ; roll out a sheet largo 
enough to envelop the fowl ; it should be as thin as pie crust. 
Wrap this around the fowl, carefully closing it on the back; roll 
a thin napkin around this. Boil until tender ; three-quarters of an 
hour will be sufficient for a young pullet. Kill the fowl over 
night ; aerve with egg and butter sauce poured o' r ; rice must 
always accompany it.

100. Scrajle. — Boil a fresh-killed hog's head tender. This it 
made in the winter during what we at the Smith call "hog-kill- 
ing." Take it up and remove all the bones; chop the meat very 
fine and season it with salt, pepper, and sage, as sausage meat; 
•train the liquor; wipe out the pot nicely; return the broth to 
•he pot ; there should be about a quart of this. Put the meat back 
u.d stir into the broth fine corn meal until the mas3 is the consist- 
nice of soft mush ; let this simmer half an hour, stirring frequent

pack it in pans, and lay over each a clean cloth dipped in vinegar j 
dip the cloth in vinegar every day, and it may be kept for some 
time in that way, or it may be packed in jars and covered with 
flal f vinegar and water. 

The feet are excellent split in two, put in a jar, ard covered 
wi h half vinegar and half the broth they were boiled in, putting 
• .11 le salt in the broth. Never use salt about the souse, tic til it 
is done and removed fi )m the pot; the broth will make good 
jelly ; salt would spoil it for that purpose. The feet should be 
fried in boiling lard, first rolling them in fine corn-meal, bread cr 
cracker crumbs, or dip them in thin batter. They may be put 
in spiced vinegar and eaten cold. 



10*2. Hog's Head Cheese. — Split the head apart — the upper por- 
tion only is used ; scrape it well. The brains must first be re- 
moved ; cut off the nostrils and throw them away ; cut off the ears ; 
clean and scrape them well ; they are to be boiled with the head, 
the tongue and feet. When entirely done, take them from the 
broth ; remove all bones ; grind or chop the meat, tongue, and 
ears together. Pick the meat from the feet carefully ; season 
with salt, pepper, mace, allspice, and a few cloves to taste ; place 
a cloth in the bottom of a pan, large enough to cover the cheese ; 
pack the meat in ; cover it well with the cloth ; lay a tin plate 
on top, and a weight upon that. When cold, remove the cheese 
to a plate; garnish with lemon and green sprigs of parsley. 
Eat for supper or luncheon, with French mustard or pickles 
If this is to be kept long, put it in spiced vinegar. The vii egai 
thould not be strong, and should be changed occasionally. 



103 Calf's Head Cheese. — After cleaning the head well, 
take out the eyes; cut ofl the nose. Boil all that remains in 
plenty of water, until the bones will come out easily. Two 
heels boiled with it will be an improvement. Chop the meat 
fine; season highly with any kind of spices liked, red and black 
pepper; salt to taste. Put a cloth in the bottom of acoiander

104. Stewing Meat. — This process does not differ materia 1 !? 
from boiling. It L slow boiling, or simmering with very litllt 
Water. When the 'aeat is somewhat old or tough, a little vine 
gar may be used. " It acts by softening the fibres, and so ren 
ders the meat more tender and digestible." 

It is an economical way of cooking, since the liquor i& used 
with the meat, and nothing of consequence is lost. The same 
receipts which have been giving for boiling, will answer for stew- 
ing, usinjr much less water. It is important that every kitchen 
be furnisned with stew-pans of different sizes. They should be 
lined vvilh tl.i or porcelain, and have well-fitting covers. Always 
use a stew-pan adapted to the size of the artiele to be cooked. 
iefbre being placed upon the fire, put in enough water to pre- 
nt the tin from melting; carelessness upon this point 'vill 
...use the tin to melt; or, if the stew-pan is lined with porcelain, 
t will crack if put upon the fire without water. As soon as 
there is no further use for the stew-pans, the cook should .im- 
mediately wash them in hot soap-suds until clear of grease ; 
wipe them perfectly dry, and rub over the inside dry meal bran. 
Managed in this way, they will last a long time. 



105. J2run8V)ick Stew. — Three gallons of water, two grown 
thickens cut up, one pound of fat bacon cut up fine. Cook the 
chickens until the meat leaves the bones ; return the meat to I Uo 
|tot ; add one half-gallon of Irish potatoes boiled and mashed, 
three tumblers of green corn, cut off the cob, one pint of green 
butter beans, one quart of tomatoes skinned, a good sized loaf of 
bread ; Beason with pepper, salt, and butter. The bread must r.ot 
be pat in until the stew is nearly done. Stir until done, begin 
when nearly done. Squirrels may be used instead £ chickens. 



105£. Gipsy Stew. — Soak a tumblerful of *Mte 6>1J pcaa 
IB hour; cut fine half a head of cabbage, a carrot, turnip, tm© 
onions, parsley ; two cloves of garlic, if the flavor is liked ; tout 
italks of celery, if convenient ; spices, if liked ; pepper and salt 
Fry four ounces of salt pork ; add to it two pounds of fresh beef, 
inutton, veal, or venison, and birds, all cut up ; put all the meat 
in a pot or stew-pan, and just cover with water; let it stew half 
an hour ; skim well, and then add the vegetables, stirring gently 
until thoroughly done ; add boiling water to keep it covered, but 
no more. It will probably be rich enough without butter ; if 
not, a little may be added. 



106. To Stew a Shin of Beef .—Dr. Kitchiner's Way.— The Doc 
tor advises " the mistress of the house" to call this dish " ragout 
Deef;" this, says he, will insure its being eaten with " unanimous 
applause, when the homely appellation of 'shin of beef stewed/ 
would give your genteel eater the lockjaw." Whatever ob- 
jection may be urged against the name of this savoury dish, 
there can be none to the receipt. 

Saw the bone in one or two pieces ; put it in a stew-pan and 
just cover it with water. When it simmers, begin the skirn 
ming, and when the water looks clear, add a bundle of sweet 
herbs, viz., parsley, thyme and sweet marjoram ; a large onion 
cut up ; four heads of celery, or less if the flavor is not liked ; on« 
dozen berries of black pepper; the same of allspice. Stew veiy 
gently until the meat is tender. This will take about thro* 
tours, unless the meat is very young and tender. Take tin** 
urrots, peeled and sliced ; the same' of turnips; a dozen small 
ii'ver-»kinned onions' boil them until tender. The car/' ts 



MEATS. 67 

ihould be put to cook first, as thoy require twice as Kng to cook 
as tne other vegetables. As soon as they are done, take them 
up and drain them dry. Take up the beef when tender; put it 
upon the dish on which it is to be served. Thicken three 
tumblers of the broth with three even tablespoonfuls of flour 
(make it into a paste with a teacup of the broth), and stir int« 
Khe gravy ; stew this five minutes ; season with salt, pepper and 
catsup, or Port wine if preferred. Send the gravy to the tabl* 
in a sauce-boat. Lay the vegetables hot around the beef. A 
leg of mutton, or loin of veal, is good prepared in this way. 
After the vegetables are taken up, return them to the stew-pan 
until hot. They may be served upon a separate dish, if pre- 
ferred. 



107. Veal or Mutton Stew. — Cut young, tender meat in thin 
slices. Put into a stew-pan a layer of raw Irish potatoes, peeled 
and sliced, a little onion if liked, a layer of meat. Season 
highly with red and black pepper, salt to taste ; put ovfr this, 
slices of cold boiled ham ; over this, bits of butter, then another 
layer of meat, seasoning, etc., potatoes last; cover with water; 
stew gently until done. Thicken the gravy ; season with catsup. 



108. Veal with Curry Powder. — Stew two pounds of veal ; strew 
over it two medium-sized onions. Rub together a large table- 
spoonful of butter, a tablespoonful of curry powder, the same of 
flour. Add this to two tumblers of the broth. Put this in a small 
stew-pan ; stew five minutes, pour in a tumbler of hot cream 
When the meat has stewed slowly until tender take it up in the dish 
it i» to be served in ; send to the table hot ; serve the gravy in 
tauce-noat. Chicken and turtle are excellent cooked in this way 
Le%s curry powder may be used where high seasoning is not liked. 



100. Beef Steak Stewed, or Steamed. — Cut the steak in pieces of 
uniform size, that all may be equally done, and rather thicker than 
for frying. If the meat is not very young and tender, beat it slight 



08 MRS. hill's new cook book. 

\y. In the bottom of the stew-pan put a tablespoonful of lard 
when this is boiling hot, lay in the steak, and fry it a light biow s 
color. Cut up two onions, and fry at the same time with the 
meat. Season highly with red and black pepper, salt to taste , 
pour over boiling water to cover the meat, and stew gently until 
tender. An hour will probably be required, but this will depart} 
upon the age of the animal, the time it has been kept, and the 
weather. To make the gravy : Into a small stew-pan put a Urge 
tablespoonful of butter, into which has been rubbed a table 
spoonful of flour; as soon as this is hot, pour in gradually two 
tumblerfuls of the broth it was stewed in. Let this stew until 
the gravy is of the proper consistence ; season with mushroom or 
walnut catsup ; pour over the steak, and serve hot. This can be 
better prepared by stewing in a double kettle, putting the meat 
in the inner kettle. 



110. Delmonico Stew. — Cut cold cooked fresh meat of an) 
kind, into small thin slices; put them into a chafing dish or stew- 
pan, with a little hot water. Season with mace, pepper and salt 
to taste; use part Cayenne pepper. Should there be any cold 
gravy left, use this, and butter enough to make the stew ricn. 
Put all in the chafing dish, cover it and let the meat simmer 
ten or fifteen minutes. Cut up a lemon ; remove the seed ; add 
this to the stew. Grate the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs ; mix 
with it two teaspoonfuls of good English mustard ; this should 
be put in a small bowl. Pour the gravy to this slowly, makii't* it 
to a smooth paste. Put this over the meat ; remove it from the 
fire, and serve immediately. 

111. Camp Stew — Mr. B.'s Receipt. — Prepare one oi more 
Sickens, and twice as many squirrels, as for frying. Into the )»«<t 
torn of a pot, or deep stew-pan, lay slices of pickled pork ; r ba- 
con, cutting off the rind and rancid parts, if bacon is used. I tit 
a layer of chicken, one of Irish potatoes peoled and sliced, two 
large onions cut up fine, butter-beans, corn and tomatoes ; r*v 



MB ATS. C9 

and black pepper and salt to taste ; a layei !>f game, .hen of p>rk. 
Finish with a layer of vegetables ; cover with water, and, put 
ting on a well-fittir.g co"er, set the vessel where the mixture will 
wnimer gently and steadily four hours. 



1 1 2. Mutton Stew — Mrs. B.'s Receipt. — Use any scraps oi 
.it I hat are not suitable for making cutlets or chops. Ste\* 
. th a little onion and parsley ; season highly with red and black 
^pper. Boil two eggs hard ; mash the yolks fine, or grate 
them. Stir them to a small tablespoonful of butter, or enough 
to make the gravy rich ; add this to the gravy, and if thickening 
is needed, use brown flour. 



113. Hotch Potch. — This is made of any kind of fresh meat, 
or game. To two pounds, add a quart of green peas, a tumblerful 
each of green corn, asparagus, and young squashes cut fine, a 
tumblerful of grated carrot ; tie together four or five sprigs ol 
parsley, thyme, and sweet basil ; stew until the meat is tender. 
There should be very little gravy to this when done; should there 
be too much, leave the cover off until it is sufficiently reduced 
add butter enough to make the mass rich. Take the bunch of 
sweet herbs out before serving. This is sometimes used us a 
soup, adding more water. 

114. Olio. — Take two pounds of tender, juicy beef, one of 
veal or mutton, a whole duck, chicken or guinea fowl, a half 
pound of pickled pork ; let this soak an hour before using it. Put 

t in a small pot, and add a few sprigs of parsley, two or three 
juioLs sliced, Cayenne and black pepper, and salt to taste; cover 
with cold water ; stew gently, and skim as may be necessary, to 
remove all dross. After the meat has stewed two hours, or les9 
time if the meat is very tender, add three or four pleasant acid 
apples chopped fine ; a pint of skinned tomatoes cut up fine, and 
into which a dessert-spoonful of sugar has been stirred ; two 
medium-sized squashes cut up ; a pint of shelled Lima beans, tin 



70 

Bame of green corn grated, and Irish potatoes sliced and cut thin 
one or two heads of celery ; stew until the vegetables are tender ' 
stir in a large tablespoonful of fresh butter. When " iont" laj 
the meat and vegetables on a dish, the fowl upon that, and senrf 
Ot. Send the gravy in a sauce-boat. 

1 15 Pepper-pot. — Clean four calf's feet and two pounds of 
tripe; boil them tender; cut up the tripe in small pieces, pick 
the bones from the feet ; return the tripe and meat to the pot, 
pour over the broth after skimming off the fat ; add two white 
skinned onions sliced, half a dozen of Irish potatoes peeled and 
sliced, a teaspoonful each of parsley, thyme, and marjoram; ste*f 
until the vegetables are tender; season highly with black and 
Cayenne pepper, and salt to taste. Make a rich gravy of part of 
the broth, a spoonful of butter into which has been rubbed 
dessert-spoonful of flour, and a tumblerful of hot cream. Serve 
hot. 



110. To Dress Cold, Underdone Beef . — Cut it in slices an inch 
thick; season them well with pepper and salt; dredge with flour; 
fry in hot lard, a light brown ; take them out of the lard, and lay 
the pieces in a stew-pan; pour over half a tumblerful of hot 
water. Rub a teaspoonful of flour into a tablespoonful of butter* 
put this into the stew-pan. Stew, with the cover on, a quarter of 
an hour; season the gravy with any kind of catsup preferred; 
pour over the meat. Serve hot. 



117. Minced Veal, Beef , or Mutton. — Into a tablespoonful of 
butter (heaped) rub an even tablespoonful of flour ; put this into 
a stew-pan, place this upon the fire and stir constantly until the 
butter browns a light color ; should the butter burn, it will be un« 
fit hr use. Cut an onion into the butter, and poar in a teacup of 
boiling water. Cut tender beefsteak, veal cutlets, or mutton chops; 
■eason them with pepper and s$t, roll them in flour ; lay them 
in a stew-pan and stew gently until tender. A quaiier of an houf 



MEATS. 7) 

will be sufficient to ook a pound <>f young, tender meat, if it is 
kept steadily simmering, keeping the stew-jwin o( vered ; a few 
Bprigs of parsley cut up fme and ad'lcd with the onion is mj 
good. 

118. Ragout of a Breast of Veal. — Separate the joints !>f Um 
ftrisket ; unless this is done before being cooked, it is difficult to 
cane; saw through the large bone, but not through the meat; 
saw ofl the sharp ends of the ribs, trim the piece neatly ; bake it 
half done; take all the trimmings and a little of the suet; boil 
these, and while the meat is baking make a quart of rich gravy. 
Put the meat, with any gravy that may be in the pan, into a 
stew-pan that will hold it easily ; pour over the quart of gravy 
made of the trimmings. Season with a teaspoonful of curry pow- 
der stirred into an even tablespoonfuJ of flour; season with salt; 
8te»v until tender. If the stew is not rich enough, add butter, and 
*hould the gravy stew down too much, add sufficient boiling water 
jn make the gravy. 



119. Stewed Sweetbread ( Vea-). — ilemove the veins and skin, 
wash them well and lay in warm water. Half an hour before 
they are served, parboil them five or six minutes ; take them up 
and drop them in cold water, until you can pour into a fire-proof 
dish a tumblerful of the broth they were parboiled in. Roll the 
sweetbreads in flour ; season highly with red and black pepper, 
and salt to taste; put them in the fire-proof dish, lay over bits o( 
butter. Set the dish in the stove oven and stew a quarter of an 
hour. Oysters added to the sweetbreads is an improvement. 



120. T: Stew Calf's Head. — Manage as for boiling, using let* 
Water ; season highly with any good catsup. It may be : jrried 
by adding curry powder to the flour used in thickening the gravjr. 
Kid's head is excellent stewed.

pe/ part of the head from the jowl. Take out the brains ; cut 
on* the tars; clean all nicely and put to stew, seasoning wilt 1 
pepper, salt, a dozen sage leaves, and two onions cut up fine. 
Wh'.'i tender, serve the jowl in a dish; garnish with green pars- 
of, and have a rich butter and parsLy gravy to serve with it. 
lake the upper part of the head, remove all the bone3, and i ul 
,ta meat m small pieces; split the feet in half and take out the 
large bones ; cut the harslet in small pieces. Strain the broth, 
pour a pint into a stew-pan ; add a tabiespoonful of butter with a 
dessert- spoonful of flour rubbed into it ; set the stew-pan upon the 
stove ; mince a tabiespoonful of parsley fine and add with the 
butter. When the butter melts, return the meat to the stew-pan 
or pot and let it gently simmer a quarter of an hour. Wash the 
brains while the meat is simmering ; mash them with the baek oi 
a spoon and make to them, with two eggs, milk, and flour, salt to 
taste, a thin batter ; fry this as a pancake, cut in diamond shapes ; 
lay over the stew with sprigs of green parsley. 



122. To Stew Fresh Pork with Potatoes. — Cut the spare-rib 
into chops, or separate the chine bone ; put them into a small 
covered pot or deep stew-pan; just cover them with warm water; 
simmer gently ; season with pepper and salt, and sage if liked. 
When tender, add, for a large spare-rib, a tabiespoonful of butter 
with a dessert spoonful of flour for thickening. Slice sweet pota- 
toes and put to stew when the meat is not quite half done ; unless 
the meat is old, half an hour will cook the stew, twenty minutes 
the potatoes ; put a layer of pork, then one of potatoes. Pork is 
Tery good stewed with green peas. Stewed apples make a good 
lAuoe for this dish. 



123. To Make Hash. — Meats that nave been once done, only 
require to be warmed over. To cook them again renders them 
tough and insipid. Cut up the vegetables to be used for season- 
ing — onions, potatoes, tomatoes, etc., as may be preferred. Put 
the butter, flour, salt, pepper, and vegetables (or spices if prefer 



MEATfl. *?3 

red as seasoning) into the stew-pan with ail the cold gravy that 
may have been saved ; essence of ham answers a good purpose; 
• fe<v inches of portable soup is very good if thtre should not be 
sufficiency of gravy ; a teacup of boiling water for a pound of 
meat ; very little water should be used. Cover the stew-par. au<J 
let this stew gently a quarter of an hour, shaking the stew par 
&!N[uentJv. Have the meat minced fine, removing all bones and 
gristle, add to the gravy, stirring it in well. Let it remain un- 
til the meat is thoroughly hot, and serve. Use catsup upon the 
plate for extempore dressing. Very little cooking is necessary 
and very little gravy. When there is stuffing, a small quantity 
may be used. 



124. Irish Potato Hash. — This is excellent made of equal 
quantities of Irish potatoes peeled, sliced thin, and put to stew in 
very little water ; when they are half done, add as much cold 
pickled beef, minced very fine, or cold boiled salt mackerel (a 
little onion and parsley may be put in with the Irish potatoes if 
liked) ; a large tablespoonful of butter; pepper and salt to taste. 
Serve hot. This should be just moist. Mash the potatoes and 
mix them well with the meat. 



125. Mrs. H?s Receipt for Beef Hash. — Two tumblers of hot 
water, a large tablespoonful of butter, three tablespoonfuls of 
grated cheese, the same of fine bread crumbs; season highly with 
Cayenne pepper; add three tumblers of beef minced. Serve <»s 
aoon as hot. Stir all well together. 

A very accomplished housekeeper furnishes me with several re 
oeipts by which dishes, savoury and economical, may be pr» 
paied. 



126. Mrs. JSs Receipt for Scotch Hash. — Mince corned Deef 
as fine as possible, also a good portion of onion chopped fine 
aeason highly with Cayenne pepper ; add a tablespoonful of butter; 
add boiling water, not quite enough to cover the meat; let this be-

«tir the meat tc tne eggs and put it in the stove-oven untJ a ligkt 
brown crust is formed. A few minutes will form the crust, if the 
a ven is as hot as it should be. Serve immediately. A good 
ireakfast dish. 



1 27. Chicken Oyster. — Mrs. J. — Pull a cold fowl of any kind 
into small pieces. Mix equal portions of sweet milk and water; 
a Lablespoonful of butter with a teaspoonful heaped with flour 
stirred into it; any gravy that may remain, and a little stuffing; 
let this stew gently ten minutes. Add enough of vinegar to give 
a pleasant, acid taste, and two or three crackers or hard biscuit 
broken into small pieces. Put in the fowl, and as soon as this is 
hot, serve. Veal, lamb, or venison, are good prepared in this 
way. 

128. Krohile. — Mince cold meat of any kind, add cold gravy ; 
break in very small pieces, or grate as much cracker as meat ; 
three eggs beaten together, butter, pepper, and salt ; stir all wed 
to the meat ; pour over sufficient water to cover the mixture — 
add a little onion, if liked ; sprinkle over the top grated crack- 
er ; bake just long enough to brown — a few minutes will be suf- 
ficient. 

129. Poultry or Birds Stevjed with Onions. — Prepare the fowli 
as for boiling ; rub over well with flour, and shake off any th&l 
]qs n^t adhere. Put three tumblers of water into a stew-pan, let 
it warm ; lay in the poultry ; cover the vessel ; let it simmer 
gently. Skim off all impurities ; cut up two tumblerfuls of white 
onion in ccld water; let it soak a quarter of an hour, then add it 
to the stew, with salt and pepper to taste. Turn the fowls ovei 
occasionally ; avoid piercing them with a fork or sharp instru

m«nt; tnese holes let out the juices and look badly. "Wild fowl* 
require to be cooked less than domestic ; much cooking destroys 
the " game taste." Many persons prefer the flesh should be ooa- 
v ierablv underdone. 

130 Chicken and Oysters. — Truss a young fowl as for boiling; 
* lean the inside well, removing all clotted blood. Chop as many 
aysteis fine as will fill it; close the apron well with a few stitcbea. 
Stew in a double kettle, or put it in an unglazed jar ; cover it 
well, and, putting it in a kettle of boiling water, 
keep it boiling an hour and a half, or until ten- 
der. Serve with a sauce made of the gravy 
from the stew, a little of the oyster liquor, but 
ter and flour to make it rich enough and of 
proper consistence. 
The plate represents the fowl with the skew 
rrs still inserted ; remove them before sending to the table. 




131. Stewed Turkey — A French Receipt. — Keep a large fat tui 
key several days after being killed. When ripe for cooking, stuff 
it; upon the bottom of a large stew-pan that will hold the fowl 
without cramping it, put a trivet to elevate it a few inches. Rub 
over the turkey a coat of flour, shake off all that does not stick ; 
lay it upon the trivet; cover over the breast with slices of pickled 
pork or bacon. Cut up two or three calf's feet, lay these around 
ic. Season highly with pepper, chopped onions, mace or nutmeg, 
i few cloves, or a stick of cinnamon broKen up. Mix together & 
pint, of cold water, the same of Sherry wine ; pour to the tur- 
key ; cot er well with a well-fitting cover; keep a wet towel ox 
cloth over and around the edges of the cover ; wet it as often as if 
required tc keep it from becoming dry. Stew slowly five htxr» ; 
turn the turkey when half done. For sauce, strain thf gravy ; aend 
H to the table in a sauce-boat. 



132. To Fricassee Chicken* ( White) —Carve into ] tints as fit

fryii<g, and if the fowl is large, bone it. Kill the fowl serene 
hours before cooking ; and aftev cutting it up, wash : * well in te- 
pid water, and pour over it boiling swe^t milk, or milk and water 
mixed in equal proportions; let it soak in this until it is time u 
put it to stew. Half an hour before dinner, if the fowl is voting 
and tender, put it to stew in water enough to just cover it. Let 
It stew gently, keeping the pot covered ; skim off all scum as it 
rises; when half done, season with salt and white pepper. Add 
dumplings irade in tkis way : Mash a tumblerful of Irish pota 
toes (more if liked) ; moisten it with a tablespoonful of sweet milk 
or water ; rub it through a sieve or colander. It must be entire- 
ly free from lumps. Use neither lard nor water, but work in a 
tumbler even full of flour, or until a soft dough is formed ; a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Flour the board well and roll this half an inch 
thick ; cut in strips and stew with the chicken ten minutes ; at the 
same time add a large tablespoonful of butter with a teaspoonful 
of flour rubbed into it. Serve the stew in a covered dish, and 
stir to the gravy half a tumbler of hot cream ; send the gravy to 
the table in a sauce-boat. Rice, potatoes, and tomatoes are all 
good accompaniments. For variety, drop-dumplings may be 
used. Scald a pint of milk ; make a paste by stirring sufficient 
cold milk to a tumblerful of sifted flour. When the pint of milk 
boils, stir in the paste, stirring constantly until bubbles begin to 
form over the top ; pour it into a bowl and let it remain undis 
turbed until old. Beat two eggs well ; beat these to the batter and 
tell more flour until a stiff batter is made ; salt to taste ; drop, by 
lpoonfuls, into the stew ; eight or ten minutes will cook them sui 
ficiently. Mace is sometimes used for seasoning this dish. 



132J. To Make a French Pilau. — Boil a pair of fowls ; when 
done take them out, and put your rice in the same water, first 
taking out some of Jho water. When the rice is don< butter it 



MKAT8. 



n 



well, cover the bottom of your dish with half of it , then \ a* 
the fowls on it, and add the remainder Df th^ liquor ; cover the 
fowls with the other half of the rice, make it smooth, an J spread 
over it the yolks of two eggs well beaten. Bake in a modtraU 
ven. 



133. To Ragout Chicken. — Prepare the fowl as for brninng ; 
lay 'in a shallow oven, or stove-pan ; pour to it a teacup of warn 
water; cover with an oven lid or tin cover, closely. When 
thoroughly hot, begin to baste it with butter. Let it stew gently 
half an hour, basting frequently. Put a little fire upon the lid, 
and brown it a few minutes before serving. Toast enough light 
bread to cover the bottom of the dish ; dip each piece in hot 
milk, or water. Serve the chicken upon this; add a tablespoon- 
mi of butter, into which has been stirred a teaspoonful of flour 
to the gravy. Let this stew a few minutes; pour over the 
chicken. Serve immediately, or the toast will become sodden. 
Fowls are excellent cooked in this way with onions and tomatoes, 
or tomatoes alone, peeled and cut fine, omitting the toast. Sea 
son with salt and butter. 



134. Rice Pilau. — Carve the fowl into joints, as for frying, 
put it into a stew-pan, with a few slices of pickled pork, or fresh 
pig cut in thin slices. Season highly with red and black pepper; 
Bait to taste. Cover the fowl with water. Let it stew gently ; 
skim until the water looks clear. Have ready a pint of ric! 
washed and soaited. Stir this slowly to the stew. Fifteen in in 
ntes will complete the cooking after the rice is added. When 
the rice is nearly done, should there be too much gravy, leave efT 
the cover until it is sufficiently reduced. This dish should onl} 
!l»e moist No gravy is required; make it rich with buuer. 

The fowl, if a full-gr^wn one, is sometimes left whole. Die ric* 
IB first put into the dish, and the chicken laid upon tb» top

Tongues i, both beef and hog, are good used in this way be fore bein| 
amoked. Birds are as good in pillau a* chicken 



135. Tomato Pilau. — Cut up the fowl; fry it in a lar*e 
u.lesnoonful of lard; fry with it an onion. Peel a pint of to 
tai jes, cut them up fine, season with pepper and salt, and a tea 
poonfui of sugar. When the onion and chicken are of a light 
brown color, take them up and put them into a s a w-pan ; add the 
tomatoes, and pour over boiling water to cover the fowl. Have 
ready a pint of rice, well washed. Stir this to the chicken, mix- 
ing all thoroughly ; simmer gently until tender. Add a large 
tablespoonful of butter. This should not have gravy. Green 
corn may be grated and used. 



136. Sausage Pilau. — This is made as the rice pillau, using 
sausages that have been stuffed, but not smoked. The smoke 
taste is imparted to the rice. Parboil liver and kidneys, and use 
them for pillau. They, as also the sausages, should be cut in 
small pieces. 

137. To Stew Birds. — Take pigeons, partridges, or any large 
nirds ; truss them as for baking ; dredge them well with flour. 
Stuff with bread, cut an inch thick, and well buttered ; dip the 
bread in wine, and, breaking it in small pieces, put a little ui each 
bird, allowing room for it to swell. Lay them in a deep earthen 
dish, breast-side down; cover them with slices of cold ham, or ba- 
cor. cut very thin ; pour in water enough to cover them. Put the 
dish in an oven or stove, and stew gently, basting frequently 
I'se a lid or cover; when nearly done, remove the bacon , turn th 
birds , put a little fire upon the lid and let them brown slightly 
~.r, if in the stove, remove the cover. Serve upon dry toast. If 
they uie young, from twenty to twenty-five minutes will be tim 
enough to cook them. Use very little seasoning Nothing should 
be permitted to overcome^the fine" game- taste" so nr j *h admired 
by lovers of good eating.

up, and put the mushrooms in the stew-pan, and stew five or six 
minutes ; pour over the tongue. Serve hot.

141. Roasting Meat. — This style of dressing meat h less pr 04 
\ w *»— — — ■ tised in the common every -day booking than it 
( f should be. It is certainly of all others the mosl 

elegant. To even approximate perfection in the 
art, practice is absolutely necessary. Although 
there are a variety of contrivances for roasting, very 
many families are unprovided with any kind of ap- 
paratus for conducting the business. A very cheap 
and simple arrangement, and which will answer the 
purpose as well as more costly and complicated 
machinery, is to roast by the string. Procure a 
piece of iron or steel eighteen inches long, with a 
hinge in the middle, to fold it out of the way when 
not in use. It should be strong enough to meet r-ny 
demands made upon it ; at one end there should be 
a plate of iron three inches long and two wide, with 
screws inserted to fasten it to the mantel-piece. This 
should be done securely. At the other end a twirl- 
ing hook, or common ring and hook ; take a twine 
or twisted woollen string long enough to bring the 
articles to be cooked before the full influence of the fire. A hook 
should be securely fastened to each end of this string ; catch one 
hook to the twirling hook, the other insert in the meat. Run I 
skewer through the feet of poultry and catch one hook to tltt 
skewer. If the roast is a piece of beef, veal, etc., when it is nali 
done turn it. If it be necessary to expose one part to the fire inori 
than the rest, prop it with a paddle or board, resting one end )fthe 
paddle against; a smoothing iron (or a brick will answer) placed 
directly behind the roast, and at just sufficient distance to rest the 
broad pai t «jf the paddle against the roast. A sharp stick must no 




MKAT8. 8* 

be used, as the least puncture wU let out tl ^ juices. Tliis plan i« 
Cor a permanent arrangement. For temporary use, a vonjcn pog 
driven over the fire-place will answer. (I shall be gla.l to see the 
roaster substituted for that most popular of all kitchen u tonsils, ihc 
Vying-pan.) A tin screen will greatly increase the heat, and thus 
ave fuel. It should be so placed as to guard the roast from cur- 
ler.ts of air. The most convenient pattern I know is one made of 
lii three feet wide, one and a half feet deep, with a shelf in it. it 
may be put upon rollers. This will also answer for a plate- 
warrner. 

General Directions for Managing a Roast. — The meat after 
being killed should be kept until tender. It is the practice of 
many cooks to use meat and fowls immediately after being killed, 
and parboil the article to make it tender. This extracts the juices, 
makes the meat insipid, and altogether fails to accomplish the object 
intended. The fire must be proportioned to the size of the thing 
to be roasted. "The fire that will roast the noble sirloin, will 
parch up a lighter joint." It should extend several inches at each 
end longer than the roast, or the ends will not be done. The 
thickest end of the meat must be most exposed to the fire; when 
a reflector or tin roaster is used, slant it so as to throw the thick 
est part nearest the fire. The spit should be kept bright. Be 
careful, when using it, never to run it through the nicest parts of 
the joint; every hole made by the spit is "a tap to let the juices 
out." It must be well balanced, so as to hang evenly ; when as- 
sistance is needed to accomplish this, use leaden weights. This 
is important, for unless the mo ion is regular, the parts will not 
oe equally exposed. The roast must not be put at first too close 
jo the fire, never nearer than eighteen inuies; if a large joint, let 
it heat gradually. Birds or small roasts may be put nearer, from 
twelve to fifteen inches. Should the meat scorch when first ex- 
posed, the heat could not penetrate ; near the bone the meal 
would remain underdone, and, besides, would acquire a disagree- 
able taste, and lose the light, rich, brown cc lor which a roaat 
ihojld always have.

82 MRS. IIILL*S KEW COOK BOOK. 

Haste frequently, and begin as soon as the meat is warm ' 
use sweet lard for most articles. Dr. Kitchiner says, aotl* 
ing bastes roast pig so well, or makes it so crisp, as good 
fresh sweet oil. Good butter may be used, particularly for birds 
and game, and gives a more delicate flavor to pig than lard. 
Press the lard or butter into a silver or wooden spoon ; baste 
with this at first, and then with the drippings. Put a pan under 
ihe roast to cateh the gravy and pour into it a tumbler of hot 
water, slightly salted, for a large joint ; less water for a small one 
or for game. Take up the diippings occasionally, leaving only a 
litt'e in the pan ; managed in this way, it will not be so strong or 
oily as when left until the roast is done ; it is best to cover the 
fat with a well-greased sheet of foolscap paper or a thin sheet oi 
dough made of any kind of dark flour and water. The latter is 
only used in a roaster or refleetor, and may cover the whole joint. 
When roasting by the string, use the paper ; when the meat is fully 
half done, remove the paper or dough. Stir up the fire ; baste 
the meat ; dredge well with flour, and let it brown a rich color. 
All the sweeping necessary must be done before the roast is put 
lown. Slow roasting is all-important. When the smoke draws 
towards the fire, and the dripping of the clear gravy begins, it is 
a sure sign that the roast is nearly done. 

"A diligent attention to time ; the distance of the meat from, 
and the judicious management of, the fire, and frequent bastings, 
are the principal rules to be observed."

Ducks have frequently a fishy taste ; this may be corrected by 
putting in the dripping-pan, onion, salt, and half a tumbler of hot 
water ; baste with this ten minutes ; then remove this, and baste 
with butter. It is said putting a carrot inside of the fowl will re- 
move the fishy taste. I have not tested this ; it is worth a trial 
After cleaning wild fowls, hang them so that they will not touch 
Different kinds should never be packed away together; a good 
plan is to hang them in their feathers. They may be kept in ccld 
weather several days. 1 do not agrre, however, with the French 
writer who directs that the fowl be " suspended by one of its long 
tail feathers, and falling from it is the criterion of its ripeness and 
readiness for the spit." 

The wild flavor is injured by much cooking. 



*t MRS. HILL S NEW COOK BOOK. 

143. Roast Beef. — The sirloin, round, and ribs of the for* 
quarter, are best for roasting. Jjet the meat hang after it i» 
killed until tender. The length of time it will require for this, 
will depend upon the weather, age of the animal, etc. Mai. age 
tho piece to be cooked, by the rules given for roasting. Baste ai 
ioon as the meat is hot, with good sweet lard, then with its own 
irippbtgs. If the meat is not sufficiently fat, insert very narrow 
•trips of bacon, with an irstrument called a larding-needle, ab 
over it, and just under the surface. Half an hour before the 
meat is done, take off any covering (if any has been used) ; baste 
over the surface quickly with fresh butter; this, when used just 
before finishing the roast, raises a finer froth than lard. Dredge 
with flour as the gravy begins to drop. Let the roasting con 
tinue, until a rich brown color. The meat is not sufficiently done 
so long as the drippings look bloody. The juice of the meat 
is prepared for gravy. Strain the gravy. This is sometin cjs too 
rich ; remove part of it when this is the case, and reserve it for 
the soup-kettle, or to aid other gravies. Serve upon a hot dish. 
The roast will do the cook no credit if sent to the table upon a cold 
dish, and eaten upon a cold plate, which will convert the gravy 
into a kind of jellied tallow. Chou, mustard, pickles, and any 
acid jelly, are good accompaniments. Cranberries are also good. 



144 Roast Veal. — The shoulder, loin, and fillet are the best 
pieces for roasting. Keep it until tender. Veal does not keep 
so well as beef, and must be wiped dry every day, and hung up. 
Never lay it down upon wood ; this keeps it damp, and it w u) 
oon spoil. Veal is the best meat for soup. The loin is consid 
«8ied the choicest piece for roasting. Regulate the fire as for the 
oeef; rub over with soft butter just before putting it on the 
•pit. It is less juicy than beef, and requires more frequent Vast* 
ing. Always saw through the bone of the loin, but not the skin, 
for the convenience of carving. Protect the fat with well-greased 
paper; sprirJtli. over a little salt, and d'edge with flour. Jus* 
before it is done, remove the paper ; baste well with the dripping* 



MJSAT8. 81 

or with butter; dredge with flour, and let tne roast hang until of 
a good color, and the clear gravy begins to diip. Serve upon a 
hot dish. If the gravy is not sufficiently rich, add butter ; if too 
thin pour it into a stew-pan, rub a little flour to the butter, and let 
the grary stew three or four minutes. Serve in a sauce-boat. 



1 15. Roast Fillet of Veal. — Remove the leg bone with I 
■hai-p Knife; fill the space with a rich stuffing, seasoned highly 
with pepper, onion, and parsley ; salt to taste. Draw the sides 
together ; wrap the flap around ; skewer this firmly, and to pre- 
vent the skewers giving way, wrap the whole joint with tape, be- 
ginning at the hock, or small end. It requires great care, and 
some skill, to prepare this for the spit, so that when served it 
will present a good appearance. When first put down, baste as 
soon as the meat is hot, with salt and water, then with a table- 
spoonful of good sweet lard — rancid lard must not be used. 
Conduct the process as for roast loin of veal. A shoulder of 
veal may also be stuffed, and roasted in the same way. Fcr 
gravy, use the drippings prepared as for the fillet. 



140. Roast Leg of Mutton. — Keep it hung as long as it can 
be kept with' tainting. Skewer it, and put it on the spit, so 
that it will ) d. g evenly ; turn it often ; baste as soon as hot, and 
continue tb ■* very frequently. Protect the fat with paper. Put 
half a tun... '. r of hot water into the dripping-pan ; as the gravy 
drops into .is, after using lard or butter, baste with it. Heat 
gradually ; the drippings strained, and slightly thickened with 
brown flcur, will make the best gravy. Currant jelly, or sou.e 
kin 1 of acid jelly, should accompany this. Grated horseradish is 
a to very good served with it. Always keep crowned flour on 
hand, in a dredging-box. When browning it be careful to stir 
constantly. If it burns, it is unfit for use.

•eparating is a saddle, and is carved in this way : Cut ficu th«

tail to the end on each side of the back bone, from a to b t out* 
Muuilig downward to the edge c, ui til jt becomes too fat. Tbl 




slices should be thin, and if too long divide them. The fat will 
be found on the sides. The upper part is generally lean. 
Give a part of the fat to each person. 

It may be roasted by the directions given for roasting. Pro- 
tect the fat with greased paper. The strings it is tied on with 
should be greased; twisted woollen is best. The flaps should be 
cut off; leave very little of the tail and chump end. This piece 
requires close trimming, which if the butcher does not do, the 
cook must. Serve with the gravy which runs down. If you 
wish to thicken the gravy, set a stew-pan over a slow fire ; put 
two teaspoonfuls of fresh butter into it, and dredge in a teaspoon- 
ful of flour ; stir this well until it browns — but it must not scorch ; 
add the gravy very slowly, stirring it constantly ; if too rich, 
skim off the grease as it rises. Let it simmer a quarter of an 
hour, or until as thick as cream. Strain it into the sauce-b< at. 
fhe peel of a lemon boiled with the gravy, gives this a fine fla- 
vor, adding the juice after it is taken from the fire; or it may be 
flavored with wine, spices, currant jelly, or ary kind of good 
Catsup, using these in sufficient quantities to " delight the palate 
without disordering the stomach." Tomatoes and Irish potatoef 
caay be served with the roast.

side, then on each side of the ridge of the shoulder-blade, in the 
direction of the dotted lines, c d. The tenderest part lies un- 
drr the Made bone, and is called the oyster-cut. The underside 
has many choice slices. The best fat lies in the direction c. 
When carved on the outside, or skin-side, slice from the knuckle 
to the broad end, in the direction / g. Roast must always be 
served upon a hot dish. A good gravy may be made, by stirring 
half a teaspoonful of salt to half a tumbler of boiling water ; pour 
this gradually over every part of the meat, after it is put in the 
dish, mixing with the juice that flows. When cut, it gives mois- 
ture and a pleasant taste to the meat. A separate tureen of gravy- 
should also be served. 



149 Lamb. — The hind quarter is best roasted. When the 
amb is small, roast the fore and hind quarters together without 
dividing them. Lamb should never be sent to the table under, 
done; it requires less time in roasting than mutton, and freouent 
basting. Serve with mint sauce. The proper vegetables to ac- 
oompany it are, green peas, asparagus, and Irish potatoes. Serve 
th< gravy in a tureen ; if liked put in the bottom of the tureen • 
tablespoonful of acid jelly ; pour the gravy over hot, stirring 
briskly until the jelly is mixed with the gravy; or season thf 
gravy with Port or Madeira wine. 



8fl MRS. HILL'S NSW COOK BOOK. 

1 50. A Haunch of Venison. — This being a dry meat requii 




• great deal of basting. I have been informed by old huntors thai 
on this account it is best to roast it very soon after being killed. 
Piotect the fat with oiled paper, keep the string well greased to 
prevent its scorching ; a twisted woollen string is less liable to 
burn than a cotton one. Twelve pounds will require three hours 
before a solid, brisk fire. Currant jelly may be served in the 
gravy or sent to table as an accompaniment ; any acid jelly will 
answer ; crab apple or grape jelly is very good. Wine may be 
added to the gravy if liked. To carve this joint, the dish should 
be so placed upon the table that the knuckle will be farthest from 
the person carving. It looks well to wrap the knuckle with 
fringed paper as in the plate ; some of the best fat lies under, and 
if it should be necessary to use this, lift the joint by the part of the 
knuckle wrapped in paper. Cut a deep gash (but do not take 
out a slice) from a to b, slanting the knife a little, then take the 
slices from a to d ; cut them of moderate thickness and put upon 
each plate a slice of the fat. A haunch of mutton is carved in 
the same way. 

151. Leg of Pork. — This may be stuffed or not as preferred 

if stuffed, cut a slit near th* 
knuckle, run the knife between 
the meat and bone, loosening i! 
carefully. Make a rich stuffing, 
season it with pepper, salt, onion, 
and sage; insert as much of the stuffing as possiole, or the bon« 
may be entirely removed and the space rilled with stuffing. Tak# 
a few stii.ches to prevent the stuffing from falling out; wrap a 




MEATS 8£ 

tope around the joint to keep it in proper shape. Nothing baste* 
it so well as good olive cil; it must not be the least rancid. 
Sh mid there be a prejudice against this, use fresh butter ; this give* 
lLo meat a more delicate iavor than lard. Fresh pork require* 
Joi ger cooking than any other ftvsh meat, and is disgusting 
§n the eye and palate if not thoroughly done. A leg weighing 
lit pounds will require at least two hours before a brisk solid fire. 
For the convenience of carving, it is well to have the skin scored 
before roasting, in thin strips half an inch apart, by merely pasa- 
hig a sharp knife through the skin. Be careful and never put the 
roast too near the fire at first, or it will blister. Boiled Irish po- 
tatoes, peas, and boiled onions, are the vegetables usually served 
with this meat. Apple sauce is a good accompaniment, and when 
it is not stuffed, send to the table along with the roast a sauce-boat 
of onion and sage sauce. 



152. Sparerib. — The sparerib of a full-grown hog is better 
roasted than cooked in any other way. Baste it well. 



153. Kid. — This animal is in its greatest perfection at five 
mouths old. The meat is delicate and juicy, and deserves to be 
more popular. Roast as you would lamb ; serve with the same 
accompaniments and sauce. The head is excellent stewed or 
baked, and also makes fine soup. This meat is good eaten cold 
with French mustard.

they are never drawn into the body as in boiling. Remove th« 
skewers before sending the turkey to the table. A turkey for 
roasting or baking may be kept longer than for boiling. Atler 
cleaning it well, wipe it dry, and without any or very little salt, 
let it hang several days. When ready for the spit, fill it with a 
rich stuffing. The stuffing must never be crammed — allow some 
room for swelling ; cut off the neck bone ; stuif the craw and tie 
the skin securely. Close the slit in the abdomen with a few 
•titches to prevent the stuffing from falling out ; break the breas* 
Done without tearing the skin. Dredge it we'll with floui, and 
shake off any loose particles. Place it eighteen inches from the 
fire, which should be brisk and solid. Begin to baste as soon as 
the fowl is hot, first with good sweet lard, and then with its drip- 
pings ; baste frequently ; when nearly done, baste with a spoonful 
of fresh butter; dredge well and smoothly with flour; place th# 
roast nearer the fire until it is of a light brown color and the <de*/

gravy begins to drip. It should then be immediately sent fcc th« 
table upon a hot dish under a dish cover. For gra'y — boil trw 
liver and gizzard, cut them up fine; put the dripping-pau upot 
the stove, or upon a trivet over the fire, if a stove is not used 
Sprinkle in a little flour; stir it in smoothly ; add the gibleU 
tu" up, and three or four nard-boiled eggs cut in half; serve in J 
iureen. A dish of ri< e boiled dry must accompany the turkey; 
cranberry jam or any good acid jelly. Make the gravy just be- 
fore the roast is ready for the table. 

To carve : Take off the wings. Slip the knife between the leg 
and body and cut to the bone, then with the fork turn the leg 
back, the joint will give way. Cut slices on each side of the 
breast bone. The white meat lies there and is usually preferred. 
The legs, unless needed, are generally set aside to be "devilled." 
The side bones and bishop are favorites, and should be separated 
from the carcass ; this is done by cutting through the ribs on each 
side from one end to the other. The back is then laid upward 
and the knife passed firmly across it, near the middle, while the 
fork lifts up the other end. Then separate the side bone as 
in the plate; the joints run as indicated by the dotted lines. 
The thigh and drum-stick are separated at the joint. 



150. A Goose. — After keeping it several days until ripe for 
t»M> spit, wash it well, and wipe dry ; dredge it 
Wfll with flour; stuff it with a rich stufling, 
seasoned with onion and sage. In a separate 
chapter, I have given several excellent receipts 
for making stuffings. The plate represents a 
goose, or large fowl, ready to be roasted by the 
string, the lines indicating the manner in 
%hich the breast should be carved. Roast it 
as you would a turkey. Serve with apple 
Muce. 



157. A Green Goose. — A green goose is a

goose not over four months old. It is not usual to stuff* thr.ia 
and they require less time to roast than a grown fowl. Whei

is very little flesh upon the breast of these fowls, consequently 
they must not be allowed to remain upon the spit a moment 
after clear gravy appears, or they soon become dry and insipid. 
Some persons prefer them a little underdone. Always stew the 
giblets ; mince them when done, and add to the gravy. When a 
little thickening is needed to the gravy, set the dripping-pan upon 
the fire, and sprinkle with a little brown flour. Onion and 
apple sauce are served with goose, wild and domestic ducks. 

The carving knife for poultry must be smaller than for joints, 
and always kept sharp and bright. 



159. Wild Fowls — Are usually trussed with the head on, as 
in the plate, turned under the wing ; 
run a bird skewer through the thighs, 
and tie the legs. Pheasants, wood- 
cocks, or snipes, are all trussed, and 
served in the same way upon toast. 
Baste well with butter ; pour part of 

the gravy upon the toast ; send the remainder in a sauce-boat. 

Woodcocks and plovers are excellent picked and not drawn, 

wrapped in thick brown paper, and roastei on the hearth in Lot

I (>0. To Bake Meat. — M. Alexis Soyer, a talented Frenok 
the/ de cuisine prouour.ces this nude ?f cooking "a semi 
Barbarian method of spoiling meat." As it is usually done, I 



MEATS. 9% 

fully agree with hirr. in this opinion ; but, by care and attention, 
baking may be made to nearly approach, though it can nevei 
equal, the superior excellence of roasting. A deep iron oven an- 
iwers the purpose better thnn the stove. WheL an iron oven ia 
is**!, the meat should be elevated a fiw inches, to prevent itn 
sticking or scorching A small trivet should be kept fcr lai 
pLq»ose , skewers crossed will answer, or a few muffin-rings. 
fLe principal rules to be observed are, bake slowly and steadily \ 
taste frequently. 

It h a convenient, easy way of cooking, and as economical aa 
Any. A learned writer upon the subject gives this estimate of 
the Icjs of weight which takes place in cooking animal food, by 
the three ways of baking, boiling, and roasting: 

280 lbs. of* beef lost in boiling 73 lbs. 14 oz.; about 2(H in 
100 lbs. 

190 lbs. of beef lost in roasting, 61 lbs. 2 oz.; weight lost, 
32 per cent. 

90 lbs. of beef lost by baking 27 lbs.; weight lost, 30 per 
cent. So that, in point of economy, baking has somewhat the 
advantage. 

In turning, or taking up the meat, never pierce it with a point- 
ed instrument. Keep the juice within the meat, and do not have 
to look for it in the gravy, leaving the meat hard, dry, and in 
sipid. 



101. To Bake a Round of Beef. — Keep the meat until tender . 
to hang it is best. Never parboil to make it tender. I entei 
my protest against this stupid management. If not sufficiently 
fat, lard it well, by inserting very narrow strips of bacon just 
Wider the skin. A larding-needle is necessary to do this. Pour 
ft pint cf tepid water into the vessel in which the meat is to be 
taked. Have a steady, moderate fire. Slow baking is alUimpor 
iant Begin to baste as soon as the meat is warm, and continue 
at least every quarter of an hour. Use bird at first, then its own 
drippings To prevent a crust firin'.ug too soon, and to keep the 



£4 MR8. HILL'S NE»V COOK BOOK. 

ekin moist, lay over it thick slices of suet, pork, or cold ham 
Over this lay a thin dough, made of flour and water (This ?« 
recommended for thick joints, that require a long time in baking.) 
Remove this half an hour before the meat is done ; baste well ; 
*» i inkle over a little salt, if any is required ; pepper it well; 
dredge well with flour, and finish oflf by browning the meat a 
light color. 

For gravy : Sprinkle a little brown flour into the gravy ; sth 
it in until well mixed, and to a pint of gravy, pour half a tumblei 
of boiling water ; let this boil up once; strain it into a tureen, and 
Bend to the table unseasoned. The flavor of the meat is preferred 
for the gravy. Should there be too much grease, skim off as much 
as may be necessary, and save it for soup. 



162. TJie Round. — The round may also be stuffed. Remove 
the bone ; fill the cavity with a rich stuffing ; skewer it well 
bind it around with tape; bake by the above directions, if 
you wish meat juicy, baste frequently. Remove the tape and 
skewers before sending to the table. Pickles, horseradish 
sauce, acid jelly, Irish potatoes, celery, rice, are all good accom- 
paniments. 

To carve : Cut off the first slice evenly, around the 

a 




whole joint, from a to b. Do not serve this, unless an cuteide 
piece is preferred. The soft fat lies on the back, below the letter 
d. The solid fat should be cut in thin horizontal slices, at the 
point e. Each person should be asked the kind they prefer, and 



MEAT8. iMI 

be served with it. When the round is stuffed, it ma) :>e neeea 
aary to allow the skewer to remain. A silver one will, in this 
case, look more elegant.

£eep it lightly salted — a week if the weather will admit — le*. 
time if there is danger of its spoiling. When ready for oaKing 
wash and wipe it dry. Put it in a brown earthenware dish, large 
enough to hold it. Pour in a pint of cold water. Cover it with 
two or three thicknesses of greased foolscap paper. Never cover 
anything that is baked with brown paper; the pitch and tar 
that is in brown paper will give the meat a bad taste. Bastfi 
frequently over the paper. Bake slowly four or five hours, in a 
moderate oven. Grated horseradish is a good accompaniment. 



lf>4. Beef a-la-mode. — Remove the bone from a round weigh- 
ig ten or twelve pounds; keep it until tender. The day before 

is to be cooked, spread over it a mixture of two teaspoonrals 
of salt, two of fine black pepper, one of pulverized saltpetre. One 
teaspoonful o( cinnamon, the same of ginger, mace, allspice, cloves, 
and coriander seed, all beat together and sifted, then moistened 
with vinegar and spread over the meat. Ten o'clock next morning, 
fill the space from which the bone was taken with a rich stuti. ugj 
seasoned highly with thyme, parsley and onion. Roll the piece 
a good circular shape, and bind tightly with a broad tape ; lard 
it well with narrow strips of fat bacon. Put a small trivet in 
the bottom of a pot, or deep oven ; pour in a pint of warm water ; 
place che meat upon the trivet ; put it to baking, and as soon &* 
t warms, begin to baste with good sweet lard ; rancid, strong 
kid should never be used for basting, it spoils everything it 
touches. Continue the basting with the gravy. Half an hour 
before the meat is done, baste and dredge with flour; bake a 
light brown color. Thicken the gravy very little with brown 
flour; pour in half a teacup of boiling water; let it boil up once, 
and p >ur into the gravy-boat. If too greasy, remove the *vp*e

fluous grease. This is excellent cold, and will keep weli. 
will require at least four hours' baking 



165 A Brisket of Beef. — Joint the bone, by sawing throagh 
h v'Miout cutting the outside skin. This is done for the conveni 
Wire of carving. It may be stuffed with oysters, or any ricl 
stuffing, first removing the small bones, and supplying their places 
aith stuffing; manage by the foregoing directions for baking. 
The heart and liver are excellent stuffed and baked. Remove the 
ventricle from the heart ; clean well, and slightly parboil it, and 
also the liver ; then stuff them. To make a good stuffing, take 
equal quantities of the kidney, suet and feread crumbs. Chop 
the suet fine; season highly with parsley, pepper, red and black; 
salt to taste; ginger and lemon peel if liked; work it up with 
a raw egg. Send the gravy to the table just as it comes 
from the meat, unseasoned, in a hot tureen. 



166. Mock Goose. — Cut two large tender steaks from the 
round. Lay one In the bottom of a oaKing-pan. Cover it ove? 
with lard ; sprinkle over this bread crumbs, or dredge thick 
ly with flour. Season with salt, sage pulverized, and pepper. 
Lay on the other steak ; pin them together with bird skewers, or 
slip a broad tape around, to prevent displacement. Spread a 
thin coat of lard over this ; put on the bread crumbs, or flour 
as at first, without the seasoning. Pour a tumbler of water in 
the pan, and bake slowly. If baked in a stove, lay a tin plate 
»r cover over until it is nearl\ done. Baste occasionally. Veal 
eak is best. 



1 u7. A Sirloin of Beef. — Keep this a few days, until tender 
A hen ripe for baking, wash it and wipe dry. Put it to bake iB 
» deep iron oven, having a trivet upon the bottom to elevate it. 
Pour in a p ; nt of warm water; bake slowly, having most of the 
fire a*, the bottom of the oven. If baked in the stove, cover th« 
meat «Jl ovej the top with a crust of coarse flour, made up

with water. Baste frequently with sweet lard at first, then with 
the gravy ; allow twenty minutes to the pound fo.* baking, if the 
meat is thick. A.l<.ut a quarter of an hour before it »s done, 
baste well ; dredge it with flour, and bake a light brown color. 
If th<* .neat is very fat, and the gravy too rich, pour off* a part 
wf- .t for soup, or hash gravy. To make the gravy, dredge in * 
ablpspoonful of flour ; pour in half a tumbler of boiling water; 
**t this boil up once, then strain into a tureen. The dish and 
tureen should be hot. 




To carve : Cut long slices from a to b. There are nice tender 
slices indicated by the line running to c. Send a slice of the fat 
upon each plate. The inside of the sirloin makes tender steak. 



168. Ribs of Beef Boned and Stuped. — Take the first three 
long ribs ; keep them several days slightly salted ; remove the 
bones ; lay the meat out flat ; pepper it over well, and lay over 
a rich stuffing, made of a quarter of a pound of suet, or butter 
cut fine, the, same quantity of bread crumbs, a tablespoonful of 
parsley shred fine, the same of thyme and sweet basil, (if liked), a 
tablespoonful of onion minced; salt to taste; pour over half a 
tumbler of hot water. Let this set until the bread crumbs are 
M-iirated with the water; then beat in two eggs, and pour the 
mixture into a hot frying-pan, into which has been melted a tca- 
npoonful of lard. Stir the batter until it is of the consistency of 
mush. After spreading the stuffing over the meat, roll it a gooa 
shape; wrap it with tape ; insert a skewer, and bake it as the 
•irluin. IJeg'n to cai ve from the thinnest end. This is gt*>d

pressed a id eaten cold. When one part of the meat is thiftnef 
than the other, cover the thin part with greased paper, and baste 
over it frequently, or the thin part will be overdone when the 
thickest is only sufficiently so. Fifteen or twenty m'nutes to 
the pound (depend ing upon the size and weather) will be suffi 
§ient time to bake. 



169. Spiced Beef. — Make a brine with half a pound of salt, 
the same of sugar, half an ounce of saltpetre, a tablespoonful of 
allspice, whole grains; measure and bruise them ; half as many 
cloves; a tablespoonful of black pepper ground course; half a 
teaspoonful of red pepper pulverized. Boil these in three 
tumblers of water. Take a piece of the round weighing eight 
pounds; pour this spiced water over it; turn it once or twice 
a day for ten days. Then salt it sufficiently, and put it to bake 
in a deep earthen dish; pour the brine over it; cover with a 
dough made of course flour and water. Lay pieces of suet ovei 
the meat thick, before putting on the sheet of dough. Bake 
slowly, and let the meat become cold in the pan. To be eaten 
cold with pickle and French mustard. This keeps well. Fresh 
beef tongues are good prepared in the same way. 



170. Mrs. Randolph's Receipt for Hunter's Beef. — Sel ,ct a fat 
round weighing twenty-five pounds. Take three ounces of salt- 
petre, one ounce of cloves, half an ounce of allspice, one large nut- 
nitg, one quart of salt, a tumblerful of syrup. Beat the spices, suit, 
and saltpetre together; pour over the syrup; rub it well on botk 
sides with this mixture (first take out the bone) ; sprinkle some 
of it on the bottom of a tub that will just hold the beef. Lay it 
hi and strew the remainder over the top. Turn it, and rub the 
mixture on well, every day for two weeks, or as long as it can 
be kept without tainting. At the end of this time wash the 
meat ; fill the hole from which the bone was taken with suet ; roll 
it tight, and bind with tape to keep it round and compact. Lay 
the meat in a pan of convenient size ; cover tlie pan with a crust 



MEATS 94 

of coarse flour and watei, rolled thin. Five hours will be re 
quired to bake. 

171. Steak a-la-mode. — Cut the steak in thin slices; pound 
llightly. It should be kept until tender. Lay the slices in an 
•arthen dish, and between each layer put a seasoning of a mix 
ure of bread crumbs, half a teaspoonful each of mace, cloves, 
allspice, ginger, and red pepper ; salt to taste ; a tumbler of to- 
mato catsup ; a tablespoonful of butter. Bake half an hour in a 
moderate oven. Veal, pork, mutton, and venison are good 
prepared in this way. When spices are not relished with meat, 
always omit them and use any seasoning preferred. 



172. To Bake a Fillet of Veal. — Hang it until tender, wiping 
it, every day with a dry cloth. Meat should not be laid upon 
wood, as this keeps it damp. When ready for baking, 
separate the fillet or thigh from the loin and shank. Take out the 
bone with a sharp knife ; fill the space with a rich force-meat of 
bread crumbs, chopped onion, parsley, and a tablespoonful of but- 
ter ; salt and pepper to taste ; beat in two eggs and fry the mix- 
ture, stirring constantly, ten minutes. Wrap the flap around. 
After being stufTed and wrapped it should look as before the bone 
was removed. Wrap tape around and msert a skewer as in the 
plate ; put it in the oven with something under to elevate it an 
inch at least ; pour in a pint of warm water. Bake slowly audi 




baate frequently. If the gravy is not rich enough, rub an even 
tablespoonful of flour into a tablespoonful of butter and add to 
the g-avy. Tomato patsup with the gravy is an improvement; 



iOO mrs. htll's new cook book. 

to t tfo tumblers of gravy add half a tumbler of catsup, 01 stew • 
few tomatoes and a little spice with the gravy. 

To carve: A fillet resembles a round of beef and is carved in 
the same way. Cut off the top outside piece, then cut round, thin 
iliees. Send some of the stuffing upon each plate. Serve with 
sickle, catsup, or French musUird. 

173. Veal a- la mode. — Prepare this two days before cooking 
Cut half a pound of bacon in thin strips, removing the skin and 
any rancid parts. Let them be two inches long and a quarter of 
an inch thick ; with a sharp knife make deep incisions all over 
the meat very near each other. Prepare a seasoning of a quarter 
cf a pound of kidney suet, one tablespoonful each of thyme, pars- 
ley chopped fine, four tablespoonfuls of onion minced very fine, 
a quarter of an ounce each of mace, cloves, and allspice, and 
one nutmeg, beaten together and sifted ; mi < with the onion and 
parsley. Season high with red and black pepper mixed, a table- 
spoon even full of salt. Put a little of this seasoning into each in- 
cision, then roll each slice of bacon in it, and press them down in- 
into the slits or incisions ; also cover the top of the meat with the 
season ing. Lay it in a deep earthen pan large enough to hold 
It without cramping ; cover it close and keep it two days after it 
Is prepared in this way. When ready for baking, pour a tumbler 
of warm water in the dish, and bake four hours, if the piece 
weighs ten pounds ; baste well with good sweet lard. This is 
excellent cold ; should be prepared in cool weather. 



174. To Bake a Calf's Head. — After boiling ;i remove the 
bones (cut out the tongue and serve upon a separate dish) ; cut 
the pieces in slices of uniform size. Lay them in a fire-prool 
dish. Grate a tumblerful of bread crumbs, mix with them a 
tablespoonful of powdered sage, the same of parsley shred fine, 
And a quarter of a teaspoonful of Cayenne pepper. Beat up th« 
yolk of an egg, put this smoothly all over the meat; then sprinkle 
over thick the bread-crumb mixture; put it in the a^** and 



MEATS. 101 

when It begins to brow n, begin immediate", y to ")aste over it with 
melted buttei ; a very few minutes will be required to bake it. 
Serve with a piquant sauce, made by seasoning a pint of the broth 
the meat was boiled in with mace, pepper, wine, or catsup ; or 
Itew mushrooms in the gravy. The brains may be manned and add- 
ed to the gravy. Celery vinegar seasons the gravy well. The per 
ton who directs in such matters in each family should give especial 
Obstructions as to the sauce to be used with each dish, adding the 
ingredients to suit the taste of those who are to be served. In 
many families there is but one style of gravy or sauce, or at best 
two. and this never varies. Where a supply of flavored vinegars 
and catsups are kept on hand, nothing is easier than to 
give a pleasing variety. To have the same unvarying sauce, 
gravy, or stuffing, denotes, as Dr. Kitchiner expresses it, "poverty 
of invention." Lamb and kid's head are good prepared in this 
way ; also calf's feet and turtle fins: 



175. To Bake Sioeetbreads. — Lay them in water an hour be- 
fore using ; parboil them. Cut slits over them and lay in strips 
of pork or bacon. Put the sweetbreads in a shallow fire-proof 
dish ; pour in a tumbler of the water they were boiled in ; a 
tablespoonful of butter with an even tablespoonful of flour rubbed 
in. Salt and pepper to taste. Baste well, and serve as soon as 
done. A pint of oysters added to the gravy will improve it. 



176. To Bake a Fresh Beef Tongue. — Parboil it in very little 
water, just enough to cover it, two hours. Take it up, cover it 
over with the yolk of an egg ; then sift over a thick coat of fin* 
bre<ad crumbs ; lay it in a pan ; pour in a tumblerful of the broth 
t was boiled in ; bake, basting well with butter. 



177. Veal Cake. — Take any kind of veal free from bone of 
p-istle ; chop it fine. It may be cooked or uncooked, but it iff 
best uncooked. Season highly with pepper, salt, parsley, and 



1 02 MRS. hill's new cook book. 

onion; use part red pepper. Mix these well with the meat 
work in an even tablespoonfi 1 of b itter. Mince very line foul 
hard-boiled eggs and a teacup of bread crumbs; work all together 
binding the whole with three eggs, the whites and yolks beaten 
together a few minutes; shape this into a large ball or cake 
Grease a fire-proof dish well with butter; lay the cake in; sprm 
kle over the top very fine bread crumbs ; lay over bits of outtei 
and bake an hour and a half in a moderate oven if the meat ia 
raw, or less time if the meat is already done. 

For gravy : As soon as the meat is removed from the bones, 
put them (and break them if necessary), with any skin or scraps 
of meat that would not answer for the cake, into a stew-pan; pouT 
i>ver water to cover them well, and simmer steadily until the 
••-ake is nearly ready for the table ; strain the liquor ; return it to 
the stew-pan, and thicken with a tablespoonful of flour rubbed into 
h tablespoonful of butter, for a pint of gravy. Season with catsup. 
Send to table in a gravy-boat. 



178. To Bake Mutton. — Keep it as long as it can be done safe- 
ly. If not fat, lard it with strips of bacon. As with all other joints, 
bake slowly and baste well. Attention and good judgment are 
necessary to know when to take the meat up ; it will very soon 
become dry and hard if suffered to remain in a hot oven after it 
is done. Serve with a sauce made in this way : Strain the gravy 
into a stew-pan, stir it over the fire a few minutes ; add a glass of 
Madeira wine, and a large tablespoonful of acid jelly, currant or 
grape is best ; serve in a tureen. As the wine and jelly may not 
be liked by some persons, send a sauce-boat of gravy made with 
ml them, slightly thickened with browned flour. 



179. Mutton to Imitate Venison. — Take the breast, or best par* 
of a neck of mutton. Rub it over well with a mixture oi half 
an ounce of allspice and the same of black and red pepper mix»d. 
Rub *vith this and turn once a day for two days ; when icady to 
KaKe, wash off the spice , put it in a pan or oven, lay ovn it slice*

of cold nam taken from the fat part; oier Uis lay a *:hni sheet J 
dough m;ide of flour and water; pour in a tumbler of hot water. 
Bake with a brisk solid fire; baste with its own gravy. Wheft 
nearly done remove the crus*:; baste well ; dredge v\ith flour, 
brown a li*rht color. Eat hot or cold. This is excellent. 



180. Tc Bake Land or Aid. — Follow the directions given fbi 
baking mutton. It requires less time to bake lamb or kid than 
mutton. When half done, season well with salt and pepper; wait 
ten n».»iutes; baste well, and dredge with flour; bake a light 
color. If properly basted, the meat will be delightfully juicy. 
The fore quarter and loin are sometimes baked together when the 
animal is small. Joint the large bone to make the carving easy. 
This is also good barbecued. A hind quarter is excellent stuffed ; 
remove the bone and fill the cavity with a rich force-meat. Thicken 
the gravy slightly with a paste made of flour (browned flour is 
best) and water; stir this into the gravy, and stew a few minutes. 
Should there be unnecessary grease, take it off. With a proper 
fire, one hour will bake a joint weighing five pounds. Mint 
sauce must always be served as an accompaniment. Send the 
gravy in a tureen. Green peas, lettuce, potatoes, are suitable vege- 
tables to be served with lamb. 
To carve: Divide the shoulder 
from the breast and ribs, by pass- 
ing the knife under the knuckle, 
in the direction a b c. Lea,ve part 
of the meat on the ribs. Lay 
this upon a separate dish ; cut in the direction of c toe. The ribs 
are now separated from the gristly part, and may be divided a 
indicated by the dotted lines e e or iL 




181. To Bake a Fresh Venison Ham. — If not very fat, cut 
incisions lengthwise on the top ; into these insert narrow strips 
of pickled pork or fat bacon ; press them in below the suifaee; 
ran a sharp narrow-bladed knife between the shank bone and

meat, and ins* rt rich stuffing ; tie it around the shark to icci rt tht 
stuffing from falling out. Spread a coat of butter over the whol« 
surface of the meat; hy over it a thin crust of flour and water , 
put it to bake in a pan ; pcur in a tumbler of water. W hen 
hilf done, season wit-h salt and pepper; remove the crust; bast* 
well ; dredge well with flour, and let it bake until a light brown 
Carve it as in the directions given for roasting a haunch of venison 
and serve with the same accompaniments. 

182. Mock Venison.— Cut the meat from a good round of 
veal ; trim the skin off carefully ; grind the meat ; season with 
spices to taste ; pepper highly ; add a third bread crumbs ; two 
or three eggs to bind the whole together. Give the meat a good 
shape; wrap it well in the skin; bind it with broad tape; bake 
it ; serve hot with gravy, or press and eat cold ; will keep several 
days in cold weather j remove the tape. 

183. To Bake a Pig. — All meats are better for being kept 
several hours after being killed, except pig. Dr. Kitchiner says, 
" it loses part of its goodness every hour after being killed ; if 
not fresh, no art can make the crackling crisp." If intended to 
be baked whole, it should not exceed a montli old, and should be 
fat and plump. Kill it early in the morning, if for dinner. Im- 
merse it in hot water (but not boiling) a few minutes j the* 
scrape off the hair, repeating the process until every part is 
white and clean ; force off the horny part attached to the feet 
Cut off the feet at the first joint; do this carefully, with a eb&rp 
knife. They are often very carelessly chopped off, leaving tiw 
bone projecting beyond the meat. Mrs. Hale gives excellent di 
rections for thoroughly cleaning a pig : " Take the wax out of 
the ears ; the dirt from the nostrils by using a small skewer (oi 
piece of wire) covered with a bit of thin rag, which you must 
wipe often upon a coarse towel or dish-rag ; take out the eyes with 8 
■harp knife or fork ; clean the tongue, gums and lips, by wrap 
ing with a sharp knife; wipe them ; be careful not to cut them 



MEATh. 105 

run your hand up the throat ; take out all the clotted Hood and 
loose pieces found there, and lastly cleanse the other end of the pig, 
by putting a skewer covered with a eioth through from the inside; 
wipe <he inside clean with a damp cloth ; make a slit in the aula 
men, and take out the entrails; wash it in two or three waters; 
wipe it dry, and wrap it immediately in a cloth to protect it 
frcm the air. Prepare the stuffing of bread crumbs, moistened 
with water, seasoned with onion and sage; a tablespoonful oi 
butter ; pepper and salt to taste ; mash the bread smooth ; beat 
into it two eggs, and put the mixture to fry until as thick as 
mush ; then with a spoon, and while hot, put it inside the pig ; 
a few stitches will prevent the stuffing from falling out; the thread 
must be removed before sending it to the table. If to be baked 
in a brick oven or stove, lay it in a large pan that will hold it 
comfortably ; if in an iron oven, put a trivet upon the bottom ; 
pour in a pint of warm water, and brush it all over with sweet 
olive oil, or good fresh butter. Besides my own experience, 1 
have the very high authority of Dr. K for saying that noth- 
ing answers for basting pig so well as salad oil. Says he. 
" rub a little sweet oil on the skin with a brush or goose feather; 
this makes the crackling crisper and browner than basting it 
with its own drippings, and is the best wa\ to prevent its blistei 
ing." The crackling or skin must be nicely crisped and del? 
cately browned, without being either blistered or burned. Aftei 
oiling it, baste with salt and water twice ; then with salad oil oi 
fresh butter. Stew the harslet; chop fine and season with pepper 
and parsley; serve in a separate dish; thicken the gravy lightly 
with a paste made of flour and water. If too rich, pour off part 
of the grease. Send to the table in a tureen. Apple sauce is a 
gcod accompaniment ; also grated horseradish, or mustard pickle. 

When done, take cfi* the head; 
cut it in two; part the whoU 
body; put the brains in the gravy; 
lay the pig in the dish, back 
tu back. The ears should, wnile 




10(5 MR8 ITLL8 NEW COOK BC OK. 

baking, be covered with oiled paper, w they will become trx har« 
before the rest of the pig is done. Cut them from the head. 
and lay upon the dish as may be preferred. The head may also 
be placed as in the plate, or as o"- may fancy. Lay the stuffing 
around and under the pig, or upon a separate dish ; put some cf 
tiiis upon each plate. 



184. Baked Pork and Beans. — Wash a quart of good white 
beans early in the morning ; put them in a kettle with sufficient 
water to cover them; place the kettle upon the fire, and when 
the water beeomes boiling hot — but it should not boil — pour the 
rater and beans into a colander, until the water drains from 
t'lein. Put them again into the kettle, and cover with cold 
water, adding a piece of soda, or saleratus, as large as a bean. 
Scald and again drain the water from them, and put the beans in 
cold water. Soak a pound of pickled pork of the lean part of 
tne middling, in water enough to cover it, three hours. Put the 
pork and beans to stew in separate kettles. Half an hour before 
the beans are done, put them in a deep earthen pan, clear of the 
water they were boiled in. Take up the pork ; score it across in 
gashes or slits, a quarter of an inch apart. Season it highly with 
pepper, and put it down in the dish of beans, until only the rind 
is visible ; pour in a pint of warm water, and bake until the 
oeans are soft and the meat entirely done. The water in which 
they were boiled makes a wholesome soup. 



185. To Bake Turkey. — Prepare the fowl as for roasting. A 
¥ fry deep oven will be required for a large gobbler. If the fowl 
Is old, directly it is killed put it in a large jar or tub and cover it 
entirely with cold water; let it remain twelve hours completely 
Immersed. Then remove the feathers. I ne rer suffer a fowl to 
be beheaded and thrown upon the groun 1 to flatter until life is e* 
tinct, but before the head is taken off, have the feet tied firmly with 
a small cord, half a yard long ; then decapitate. Tie the other end cl 
the cord to a board, fastened at each end to a post, (a/owl gallows); 



VJtkT9. 100 

the fowl should swing until dead ; managed ir this way, the meat 
is whiter and there are no bruises; stuff with a rich force-meat. 1 
ometimes spice the force-meat; for variety, add sausage ir*»* **> 
the batter used in making the stuffing. When put to bake, ekvaie 
the turkey a little; it will be less liable to burn than if laid nj 01 
the bottom of the oven. Lay slices of pickled pork or fat bacon, 
taking off' the rind and any rancid part, over the breast th'uk and 
tuck a piece under each wing; pour in a pint of warm water. 
Cover the vessel with a well-fitting cover and bake slowly, putting 
most of the fire under the oven until ready to brown it. If baked 
in a stove, put over a cover of dough, made of Hour and water ; 
remove it when the turkey is nearly done. Baste very frequent- 
ly, with sweet lard at first, then with the gravy. In turning or 
taking it up, be careful not to puncture it with a fork or other 
sharp instrument ; this makes unsightly gashes and lets out the 
juice. Half an hour before the turkey is done, put the giblets to 
stew; boil four or five eggs hard ; cut up the giblets when done ; 
slice the eggs, and put them with the gravy into a tureen. Serve 
the turkey upon .» hot dish. Rice boiled dry should be sent to 
the table with it, and cranberries or stewed apples. 



180. Goose. — Rub the goose, the night before it is to be cooked, 
with a mixture of pulverized sage, salt and pepper — equal propor- 
tions of sage and pepper, and as mach again of salt. When ready 
for baking, wash it well and wipe dry ; stuff it with the following 
pre] »aration : one tea-cup of bread crumbs, one of well-mashrd 
Irish potatoes, two tablesponfuls of onion shred very fine, twe 
teaspoonfuls of sage, rubbed fine and sifted if dry, chopped fine if 
green ; salt and pepper to taste ; beat in two eggs ; add a tablespoon 
fill of butter, and fry a few minutes, stirring constantly ; put this 
hot ii to the goose. If the flavor of sage is not relished, u?e less 
or omit it altogether. Put it to bake in a pan or oven ; baste 
well. Stew the liver and gizzard in very little water ; slice them 
and add to the gravy, or keep them whole, and lay upon the 
dish. The liver is considered a great delicacy. Thicken th«

gravy slightly with flour. Curve as the roast gooss Ociot 
sauce or apple sauce are the proper sauces. 



187. Ducks. — Two are necessary if t'..~ f'ai;iily numbeis half I 
dozen. Clean them well the evening before 4 ,hey are wanted* 
Singe off any hairs that may remain after being picked ; season th* 
atuiiing highly with onions and sage. Rub the ducks over with 
butter. Put them to bake ; when warm begin to baste. If 
young and tender, an hour will be sufficient time to bake them. 
Mince the giblets and add to the gravy. Onions, stewed cran- 
berries, apple sauce, and rice — all, or either of them, should be sent 
to the table with the ducks. 

Wild ducks are seldom stuffed, and require less baking than 
the domestic. 



188. Partridge. — To carve: Divide in half lengthwise. Pigeoi 
the same way. 




189. Large Fowls, Chickens, Guinea Fowls, Capons — How to 
Fatten, and Bake. — Fowls should be cooped several days before 
being killed, and supplied regularly with fresh water and an 
abundance of nutritive food. Nothing is better for them than 
coin meal, made into dough with boiling water. To feed them 
once a day with rice, just scalded well until the grains begin U> 
well, fattens them rapidly and improves the quality of the meat. 
Never prepare more dough or rice than can be used ) efore it 
sours ; when it becomes so it is injurious, and fowls will not fatten 
wp:>n it. Their coops should be kept clean and dry ; a good plan 
is *,o build fattening-coops, by driv'ng four posts into the ground 



MEATS 109 

the size you wish the coop; fill up the space between with uar 
row strips of plank, far enough apart to allow the fowls to feed 
by thrusting their heads through the bars of their pri«on. Cover 
the roof with boards, making them project over the bodj of th? 
coop far enough to protect the troughs placed close to the ux>p 
The troughs should be shallow and narrow, kept clean, fr*. 
quently replenished with fresh water; there should also b« 
troughs for holding food. The advantages of this way of feeding 
ire so obvious they need not be pointed out. A handful of dry 
grains of corn and wheat may occasionally be thrown to them. 
All this should receive regular attention ; ample compensation 
will be found in the rich, delicate flavor of the flesh, so different 
from half-starved poultry suffered to run at large, and when 
needed, run down, caught, killed and put upon the table in a 
marvellously short time. One should have the stomach of an 
anaconda to digest such meat. I give no directions for cooking 
fowls managed in this way, since no skill or art of the cook can 
make them "salubrious or savory." 

A young pullet, capon, or guinea fowl just come to its growth, 
"fat, plump and rosy," is always acceptable to the majority >f 
palates. Kill them over night; swing the fowl immediately .if 
ter killing. Bake by the directions given for baking fowls. Ri e, 
pickles and Irish potatoes are good accompaniments.

It is usaal to truss wild fowls with their heads on, to distin- 
guish them from domestic; remove the intestines carefully, and

190. Pompeifs Head — Mrs. Bis Receipt. — Three pounds o* 
tender beef or mutton, a quarter of a pound of lard, and thres 
onions, minced fine. Season highly with red and black pepper 
and sage ; chop the meat fine ; mix the seasoning with it thorough 
ly ; form it into a large ball. Make a circular hole half through 
the centre of the ball ; dredge it well with flour ; put it in a pan 
to bake, baste it well with butter ; 

sprinkle again with flour; continue to baste until done. Serve 
upon a flat dish. 

l^T* m nearly all first-class cookery books it is usual to de 
vote a chapter to directions in the art aJid mystery of carving. 
Observation and conversation have taught me that very little at- 
tention is given to this chapter, ladies deeming it entirely a mas- 
culine accomplishment. This is an error; though they may sel- 
dom be called upon to handle the carver, yet an emergency may 
arise, and it is well to be prepared to act with grace and confidence; 
besiJes, a knowledge of this art will enable mothers to teach 
their sons, sisters their younger brothers. 1 have therefore pur- 
posely so connected these receipts for cooking meats, etc., with 
the rules for dissecting, that a knowledge of one could not oe ac- 
quired without at the same gaining some information as to tha 
Other. Practice and experience must perfect the work. 



"Cleanliness ehonid be the first lesson In the kitchen.'* 

i91 Tj Fry Meat. — The frying-pan is decidedly the most 
popular of the kitchen utensils. It is a cor. venient, expeditious 
way of cooking, requiring less fire than any other mode. Some 
persons condemn it as "a pernickus way of preparing meat;* 



MEATS. Ill 

giving as a reason that " the influence of heat ».n *att\ sub*ti ce» 
effects chemical changes whereby they are rendered more uiffi 
cult cf digestion ; hence those culinary operations in which »/il i* 
•ubjected to high temperatures are objectionable." 

Frying, however skillfully performed, can never be a delicat* 
way of cooking meat, or one suited to the stumachs of child ret 
or persons of weak digestive powers. Monsieur Soyer say a 
that " the usual complaint of food being too greasy prepared by 
frying, is totally remedied by frying the meat in a small quai tity 
of lard, Ml, or butter, which has attained & proper degree of heni^ 
and, he adds, the objection to this mode of cooking lies in the 
manner it is performed, the usual practice of cooks being," to lay 
the article in cold fat, and letting it soak while melting." Dr. 
Kitchiner defines good frying to be " boiling in fat." Some tilings 
•re best cooked in this way, others in very little fat — a process 
Between frying and broiling, which M. Soyer calls semi-frying or 
sauteeing. This is particularly suitable for cooking meats partly 
dry or underdone. It is important to know the precise time for 
putting the meat in the fat; throw in a piece of bread just as the 
lard ceases hissing ; if it browns a light color, the fat is just 
right ; if the bread burns, the fat is too hot. For frying a large 
quantity of steaks or cutlets, a shallow oven or spider will 
answer bettei than the frying-pan. Watch the vessel carefully 
while the frying is going on ; turn the meat frequently ; be care- 
ful not to pierce it and let out the juice. Meat-tongs are best 
for turning, but where it is not convenient to use these, stick the 
fork in the fat, or slip a broad-bladed knife under, and turn in 
tnat way. Take up the meat the .noment it is doiie, before * 
hard crust forms ; cover it |i a hot dish. Nothing is so gcx>d tci 
fry kg as nice lard. Butter scorches too easily.

192. M. Soger's Receipt for Semi-frying Round Beef Steak.— 
Cut the steak three-quarters of an inch thick; saw thr >ugh tht 
bone, if it is taken from the rump. It should weigh a pojnd,

and be fat and tender ; roll the steak in flour or meal ; shake off 
any particles that will not adhe re. Put a frying-pan upon the fir« 
oi stove, with a tablespoonful of lard in it (the spoon should not be 
helped); when sufficiently hot, lay in the steak; in two minutes, 
turn it. Repeat this until it is done, never leaving the steak 
ifter it begins to fry, until it has been in the pan twelve minutes. 
Should the fat become too hot, lessen the fire ; remove the pan until 
it cools sufficiently; the gravy must not be allowed to scorch 
When the steak is half done, season with a teaspoonful of salt, 
half a teaspoonful of pepper, putting half on one side ; then 
turn it, after frying two minutes, and season the other side. Feel 
with the finger, and when the meat is firm under the pressure, it 
is done. Lay it immediately upon a hot dish, and pour over 
melted butter, or gravy may be made in the pan by pouring in a 
small teacup of boiling water when the steak is nearly done, aftei 
seasoning it. Persons who like onion or eschalot with steak, can 
fry the onion cut up fine in the frying-pan, allowing a quarter of a 
pound of onion to a pound of steak. The seasoning may also 
be varied by rubbing mustard, a little of any flavored vinegar 
preferred, or curry powder, into the butter before melting. 



103. Beef Steak. — The tenderest are to be found on the sir 
loin. The tenderloin is delicious, but good steaks may be 
taken from the round. Some prefer the seventh and eighth rib 1 *, 
because the fat and lean are better mixed. If the weather is 
cold enough to admit its being kept several days, it will be bet- 
ter than to seek to make the meat tender as soon as killed, by 
beating or pounding. As soon as possible, put the steak in a 
clean bag ; tie it tight, and if in fly season, roll the bag in a paste 
)f lime and water, to stop all the interstices through which the 
green fly could deposit its eggs. Some persons carele? sly leave 
the steak exposed for hours, giving the fly time to scatter egg« 
over it, and in this condition it is bagged or set away for use. 
The sequel may be guessed. Hang the bag in a cool riace; us* 
no aalt about the meat as long as it can be kept withoui

tainting. Cut the pieces when about to rook trcm, of uiform 
size. Should one part be thicker than the rest, equalize the siz* 
by beati v ig the thickest part. Snould there be too much fat 
trim it down. Roll each piece in flour or me^L shake slightly 
and lay in a pan of boiling lard. There should be fat enough ta 
cover the steak. When brown on one side, turn it, and as soon 
as the Mhole is a light brown, take it up on a hot dish. Into the 
lard necessary to fry a p^und of steak, dredge or sprinkle a small 
tablespoonful of flour; stir this in smoothly, pressing out all 
lumps ; pour in half a tumbler of boiling water; let this boil up 
once ; pour it over the steak. Onions may be fried in the gravy, 
after the steak is taken up; the white silver skin are the mos* 
delicate. Fried apples are a good accompaniment ; also horse 
radish sauce. 



194. Mrs. F. J s Daubed Beef. — Have a round of beef, weighing 
ten pounds, prepared as for roasting. Cut a dozen long thin 
slices of fat bacon ; remove the skin, and should there be any ran 
cid part, remove that. Lay them in a seasoning of salt, pepper 
and vinegar. Spread the meat out after cutting out the bone. 
Make deep incisions in the flesh, but do not cut through to the skin. 
Press the slices of bacon into the incisions; roll the meat com 
pactly ; wrap it well with broad tape, and insert two skewers. 
Cover the top and bottom with sliced onion, and set the round 
away until next morning. Remove the onions, but reserve them, 
and also any vinegar seasoning that may be left. Put into an 
oven that will just hold the meat, a pound of good sweet lard. 
When hot. lay the beef in and fry it slowly, turning it twice. 
Be careful and do not puncture it with a fork. When it is a light 
brown color, take it up ; put it into a deep stew-pan, or pot that 
will hold it without cramping. Put skewers, muflin-rings, or 
an inverted plate under the meat, to prevent its resting upon thfl 
bottom of the vessel ; flour the meat well ; put it in the pot, 
and pour over boiling water enough to cover it. The vessel 
must be well covered with a c C6e-fitting cover; s mmer gentlj

one hour; turn : t; pcur in the vinegar seasoning in which thl 
bacon lay over night; put the onions in with three sliced car 
rots, ft bun:;h of parsley, thyme, and sweet basil; a dozea 
dtavss; the same of allspice; three large pieces of mace; a table 
ipooufil rf butter. Cover the oven, and simmer gently anothei 
feoui. Take the meat up on a hot dish. Make of the broth a 
m ach gravy as is needed ; the remainder may be converted int# 
good soup, by adding a little thickening, catsup and wine. 



195. Beef Liver. — Wash it well; remove the veins ; parboil 
it an hour before it is to be cooked. Pour the liver and water 
into a vessel, let it set until nearly cold ; slice it in pieces an inch 
thick ; season them with salt and pepper. Cut half a dozen slices 
of fat bacon ; remove the skin ; put them with a tablespoonful of 
lard into the frying-pan ; when the lard is hot, roll the slices of liver 
in flour, shake them slightly and put them to fry; turn frequently. 
Take the bacon up when crisp ; they will be ready to take up be- 
fore the liver. Take the liver up when done ; dredge a little flour 
into the pan; pour in a small teacup of boiling water ; let. atl boil 
up until the gravy thickens sufficiently, and pour into a sauce-boat. 
It should not be poured over the liver. Serve the liver and bacon 
together upon the same dish. Calf and hog's liver are better than 
beef, and may be prepared in f he same way. Butter may be 
used for making gravy, if preferred to the lard. 



196. Beef Kidney — Should be parboiled; cut in small pieces, 
•easoned highly with pepper and salt, and frie 1 as the liver. Serve 
with tomato sauce. 



H7. Sweetbreads. — Parboil them five minutes ; take them uf 
tud drop them in cold water. When ready to fry, remove all 
ikin. roll them in flour; season with pepper and salt, and fry 
light orown. They should be taken up immediately, or they wiL 
be loo rich. Strain the gravy ; sprinkle a little flour in the pan 
■tir it well ; pour in a wineglass of boiling water ; just as this boiU

198 Tripe Fried. — Cut it in slices, after being boiled d jne* f 
dip each piece in thin batter and fry in hot lard; take them up 
Mear of grease. Very few minutes will be required to cock it suf 
ficiently, and if suffered to remain too long the tripe will be hard 
and tough. It may be fried without the batter ; put a table- 
wpoonful of lard into a frying-pan ; shred an onion fine, and as soon 
us the lard is hot, put the onion and tripe in ; fry until a light 
brown. Serve without gravy ; make a sauce and send in a 
tureen ; for the sauce, use a tumblerful of melted butter, a table- 
spoonful of chopped pickle (onion is best), the same of lemon 
juice, or strong vinegar. Let this simmer five minutes ; send to 
the table hot. In frying, lay the rough side down first. 



199. Cow-heel. — After being well cleaned, boil them until the 
bones can be removed easily. Cut eaeh heel in four parts; dip 
them first in beaten egg, then roll in bread crumbs or corn meal, 
Hid fry in hot lard until a golden color ; very little cooking is 
accessary ; or fry them plain until slightly brown. French mus- 
tard is good eaten with them, or any of the store sauces. Season 
extempore. 

200. Veal Cutlets. — Cut them half an inch thick from the fillet 
or thick part of the thigh ; if not quite tender, beat slightly with 
a wooden meat-mallet, not enough to cut through the meat; (lour 
them ; shake off any flour that does not adhere, and fry in hot lard, 
turning frequently, or they may be dipped in egg, then rolled in 
fine bread crumbs, and fried. For gravy: Pour off the fat (use 
it for greasing the griddle) ; put a tablesr x>nful of butter in the 
pan ; stir in a heaped tablespoonful of flour until it browns ; pour in 
half a tumbler of boUing water. Season with catsup of any kiLd 
liked, and pour over the cutlets. Serve upon a hot dish. 



116 MRS. HILLS NEW COOK BOOK. 

201. Veal Cutlets with Oysters. — Empty into a bowl a pint 
of oysters with their liquor grate a tumbler not quite full of 
bread or cracker crumbs ; add that to the oysters. Season with 
pepper and salt; let this stand until you can prepare half a dozen 
thin tender cutlets. Put a pint of lard into the frying-pan ; whci 
toiling hot, roll the cutlets in flour and drop them into the boilii § 
laid. Watch them carefully, turning often; they must not be 
permitted to scorch ; when half done, pour off half of the lard and 
add the oysters. Take them up when the oysters begin to shrink. 
Serve in a hot covered dish. Send the gravy in a tureen ; a little 
flour may be added to the gravy if it is not thick enough. 



202. Veal Cutlets with Tomatoes. — S^ald and skin half a dozer 
large tomatoes ; more if they are small. Cut up fine and add tn 
the tomatoes a medium-sized white onion, a dessert-spoonful o' 
brown sugar ; salt and pepper to taste ; stir them to the toma- 
toes. Put into a stew-pan a tumbler of hot water, the tomatoes, 
two tables poonfuls of line bread or cracker crumbs, and a table- 
spoonful of butter. Let these simmer gently, covered while the 
cutlets are being fried. As soon as the cutlets are done, put them in 
a hot covered dish ; pour over them the tomatoes from the stew-pan. 



203. Veal Cutlets Curried. — Cut a pound of veal into slices 
two inches square. It should be kept until tender. Beat up two 
eggs ; have a plate of fine bread crumbs ; dip each cutlet first \\ 
the egg, then roll in the bread crumbs, pressing the bread on with the 
back of a spoon. If they are not well covered, dip again in the 
eggs and bread crumbs. Have a frying-pan ready with half a 
pound of boiling lard ; fry a light brown color. Before putting 
the cutlets to fry, put into a s' aw-pan an onion and tart apple 
cut up, one tablespoonful of tatter. Let these stew, stirring con- 
stantly until of a golden color. Now put the cutlets to fry ; turn 
(h' m. Mix upon a plate two teaspooi fuls of flour, the same of

in 



rith the butter. Be careful that the butter cbes net bum; pom 
Ti the milk as soon us the cnion is of the right color. When '.t be* 
gins to boil, stir in the paste of flour and curry powder. Take up 
the cutlets, as soon as done, on a hot dish ; pour ever the gravy* 
K dish of boiled rice should -.ccompany this. 



201. Another Way to Use the Curry Powder. — Omit the egg 
and bread crumbs ; rub the curry powder upon the cutlets, and 
fry ; leave the powder out in making the sauce, as that rubbed 
upon the cutlets will be suflicient. Mutton cutlets are good pro- 
pared in the same way. 

205. Mutton Chops. — After the chine is split open and the 
muttoi. quartered, cut the chops from the best end of the neck 
and loin which attaches to the fore quarter — the scraggy part that 
'oins the head is fit only for soup or stews. Cut them of the same 
size, about two inches long. It is usual to leave one bone to a 
chop. Beat the thick part of the bone until it is all thick alike; 
with a sharp knife scrape the meat from the end of the bone half 
an inch ; round the bone. Great care should be taken to give 
each chop a good shape. If they are too fat, remove part of it. 
Roll in flour and fry in hot lard. When half done, season the 
upper side with salt and pepper ; turn them frequently, and as 
»oon as done serve immediately. " From the frying-pan to the 
tiouth" is the proper way. Let the dish be hot upon which they 
are served. From ten to fifteen minutes will be required to cook 
them, depending upon the size of the chops and age of the animal, 
u:d the time the meat has been kept. For gravy : Pour off the 
fat '.hey were fried in, and for a pound of chops put in the pan a 
large tablespoonful of butter; set this on the fire, and stir in an 
aven tablespoonful of flour until it has a rich brown color; pour 
in a tumbler of boiling water; stew until the -ance is as thick aa 
rich eream. Season with any kind of catsup 1 Ked, and pour over 
the chop3 ; «»r it is good without the cats jp. 



J 18 MRS. niLL's NEW COOK BOOR. 

20<>. Mutton Chops — Another Way. — Cut and prepare them ai 
directed in the foregoing receipt ; fry them half done ; make a 
thin hatter of flour, eggs, sweet milk, pepper and salt; dip thf 
chops in, and fry a light brown color. Serve with horseradish <*» 
tomato sauce. Meats fried in batter should never have the grai i 
|oured upon it. 

207. Mutton Collops — Are cut from the best end of the necu 
Let there be a bone to each collop three inches long ; flatten tin 
large part of the bone (the chine end), so that they will be oJ 
uniform size ; fry them a light brown color. Into a stew-pan thai 
will hold the collops (a pound at least) pour a quart of boiling 
water, one tumblerful of onion shred fine, pepper and salt to taste 
let them simmer ten minutes ; add the meat. Put on the cover, 
and stew gently until the meat is tender; remove any scum that 
may collect upon the top. Into the gravy-kettle or a small stew 
pan, put a large tablespoonful of butter; set this upon the fire 
When the butter begins to melt, stir in a dessert-spoonful o» 
flour ; pour the gravy from the collops into the butter slowly 
stirring constantly until it boils and begins to thicken. Lay the 
meat in a hot dish and pour over the gravy. Lamb, beef, veal, 
kid and venison are all good prepared in this way. Season upon 
the plate with catsup. This is an excellent way of cooking when 
the meat is a little tough. 



208. A Receipt for Keeping Collops. — Chop raw, tender meat, 
into small pieces; season well with salt and pepper; pack in 
small jars, and pour over clarified butter. Tie an oilcloth ovei 
the jar to exclude the air, or use an earthen self-sealing can. To 
oook : Fry slightly, and then stew until tender, seasoning with 
onion or anything liked. The difference between a chop and col 
lop is, that collops are partly fried and then stewed. 



209. Lamb Steaks or Cutlets. — These are cut from the hind 
quarter, without bone, and may be cooked as mutton steiks, by

frying them plain or dipping them in egg, then rolling in bread 
crumbs or corn meal. They require less cool ng than mutton 
itcak. 



210 Lamb's Fry and Pluck. — The small bowels, sweetbreadi 
At d kernels compose the fry; the lights, liver and heart makf 
thr pluck. Clean and soak them well, cutting open the intestines 
wi h sharp scissors. When clean, cut them into small pieces, roll 
in flour, and fry a golden color. Put all into a stew-pan, cover 
them with boiling water, and stew until tender. Season with red 
and black popper, salt to taste, onions and tomatoes. 

21 1. Venison Steaks. — Cut the steaks from the haunch or sad- 
dle, half an inch thick; fry in half lard and butter. Never leave 
them a moment after putting them in the pan, but turn constantly 
Season with salt and pepper when half done; a very few minutes 
will be required to cook them, but they should be thoroughly 
done. Take up the steak into a hot covered dish ; dredge a littU 
flour into the gravy, stir fc in smoothly ; pour in half a tumbler of 
.boiling water; let it boil up once, then immediately pour in a wine 
glass of good Madeira wine ; pour over the steak. If preferred, 
mushroom or tomato catsup may be used in place of the wine. 
Serve with cranberry jam or any pleasant acid jelly. 



212. Pork Chops. — Quarter the animal, remove the chine 
b«>ne, cut the blade bone from the ribs (chops are taken from the 
fore quarter) ; cut the ribs into pieces two or three inches long, 
oi e l>one to a chop ; if very fat, remove a part of it. Sprinkle a 
t IrUie finely pulverized sage over each piece; fry a light brown; 
i€i ve without gravy. Fried apples, tomato sauce, or dried apple

pouring in a small quantity of boiling water ; let it boil up ono* 
and pour over the steak. Serve with them tomato or onion 
sauce. Steaks may be cut from the hind quarter or chine. 



214. Hog's or Pig's Feet. — Clean them nicely ; let them soak a 
&») and night, changing the water once; scrape them well, and 
boil until the bones can be easily removed. Take out the laigost 
bone when the feet are large; split them in half lengthwise. 
Make a thin batter of sweet milk, eggs, flour, salt and pepper, and 
for two eggs a teaspoonful of yeast powder. Dip the feet in thw, 
and fry in boiling lard a light brown color. The feet being al- 
ready done, the batter requires very little cooking. Take each 
piece up with a perforated skimmer. Lay a clean napkin upon a 
flat dish, and put the feet upon the napkin ; it will absorb the sur 
plus grease. Serve without gravy; season upon the plate with 
French mustard, vinegar, or pickles. They are excellent rolled 
in corn meal and fried. To keep hog's feet in winter, after they are 
boiled pack them in jars and pour over half the broth they were 
boiled in, skimming off all grease, and half good apple vinegar; 
scald the vinegar every three or four days, and, if liked, spice it 
with mace, ginger, cloves, and allspice. 

The feet are good picked up while hot, carefully removing all 
bones. Season highly with pepper; add vinegar and salt to taste. 
Put the meat in pans; press it down; when cold, slice, dip in 
egg, roll in corn meal and fry only until the meal browns slightly , 
or it may be fried plain in very little lard ; the meat will fall to 
pieces, but tastes well. Garnish the dish in which it is served 
with parsley. 

215. Sausages. — If in skins, first scald them in boil'ng water , 
Iftt them remain in the water jive minutes. Put a tables ponnful 
of lard into a frying pan and when it is hot (but not boiling), 
prick the sausages and fry slowly, turning them frequently ; keep 
the pan covered with a tin plate. The manner in whick sajjr<age* 



MKtTS. VX 

•re usually fried renders them hard and indigestible, tiioy will not 
be, if these simple directions are followed. 

When sausage meat is fried in cakes, form the meat into round 
Ihin cakes; roll them in flour; put them to fry in warm lard, 
lien irh to half cover them. Put a cover on the vessel they are 
ti?d in ; cook slowly, turning twice. They are generally cooked 
Sty rapidly — the outside only becomes done, the inner part i* raw. 
Whf.ii the sausage meat is very rich, less iard may be used, some 
is necessary to prevent a hard crust from forming. 



210. To Prepare Sausage Meat. — Grind, very fine, lean and fat 
pork in the proportion of two of lean to one of fat. Never use 
leaf fat; if more fat is needed than is afforded by the trimmings 
nf the chines and joints, cut it from the thick part of the middiii g. 
lake out all the skins and stringy pieces of meat. Season it well, 
by adding to every eight pounds of meat three tablespoonfnls of 
olack pepper finely pulverized, five tablespoonfuls of salt, six of 
3age, dried, beaten fine and sifted (measure it after being sifted), 
two of Cayenne pepper ; make a very strong tea of this, using only 
half a tumbler of boiling water ; strain this. Mix the seasoning 
intimately and thoroughly with the meat. The taste of persons 
differs so much in all matters pertaining to the kind and quantity 
of seasoning, that much must be left to the discretion of the house- 
wife, or the person best acquainted with the different tastes of the 
family. While some ignore pepper and the different spices as 
highly injurious to the tender coats of the stomach, others re- 
quire such a tremendous quantity of Cayenne, spice, brandy, the 
combustibles generally, that, as has been well observed, " only a 
fire-proof palate lined with asbestos can endure." 

Stuff the meat in well-prepared skins ; hang them, spreading 
them considerably. Never link them, they are apt to mold and 
sour where the links are formed. In damp weather wipe them 
and smoke slightly ; turn occasionally. They may be kept thrc ugh 
the spring by packing in jars, and pouring over sufficient thick 
re-boiled molasses, or melted lard, to exclude the air (the lard is 
6 



122 m 

best). The jars should be kept well covered, and not set i.pon i 
ground floor ; there wouli be danger of their acquiring ar earthy 
taste. The meat may be kept without being stuffed, by packing 
it in small jars ; strain over the top melted lard an inch thick. 
It is best to use the contents of the jar as soon as may be aitet i 
is opened. 



217. To Clean the Skins. — Empty he small intestines; turn 
and wash them well, first in tepid, then cold water. Put them 
to soak at least twelve hours, changing the water. Lay them on 
a smooth board or table and scrape off the inner skin. Be careful 
and tear them as little as possible. As they are being scraped blo\? 
them up by inserting a reed in one end ; when an air hole is dis- 
covered, cut the intestines. Casings for sausages may be made by 
scraping the fat very clean from the thin membrane that lines the 
leaf fat. Sew them into bags and stuff them. Smoke slightly. 
They keep well. When fresh they are usually cut in slices and 
fried or broiled. When they become hard, boil them and dress witb 
butter and hard-boiled eggs sliced. Garnish the dish with green 
sprigs of parsley. They are good boiled and sliced cold for lunch 
eon ; served with pickle. When sausage meat is stuffed in large 
casings they rejoice in the euphonious appellation of "Tom Thumb." 



218. Chitterlings. — Take the intestines and maws selected for 
chitterlings (and take those only which are in good condition) ; cut 
them open with a sharp knife. Hog chitterlings are best— -indeed 
the only kind in general use. Turn and wash them in several 
waters ; scrape them ; lay them to soak in m eak salt and wa*,er two 
days, changing the water and washing them well ; w hen chained, ifi 
fresh cold water. Boil them until tender ; pack them in a jar. 
Pour over weak vinegar to cover them ; renew *he vin«*uar a* 
may bo necessary. Cut them in pieces if large ; roll in corn meai 
or bread crumbs, and fry antil hot in boiling lard, or dip them in 
thin batter and fry until the batter is a golden color ; very 'title 
0O>king is required. This is a populai dish, very rich ; but should 



MEATS. 123 

be attended to by a very ntat, careful person, and not suffered to lie 
a moment that can be avoided after being taken from the animal 
until they are cleaned and in soak. The water should be changed 
often and the vessel ir; which they are put to soak washed clean 
iach time of changing. Seasoned like oysters, they make a good 
jDock oyster. 

210. Liver Pudding. — This is best made of calf's or hog's liver ; 
other kinds are used, however. Boil together a pound of hog's 
liver, half a pound of the thin part of the middling or breast of 
pork. When tender, mince them together fine, or it will be easier 
to pass the meat through a sausage grinder; remove all skins and 
stringy parts ; season highly with onions shred fine, red and black 
pepper ; salt to taste. They may be stuffed or fried in cakes; roll 
the cakes in flour and fry as sausages. They may be kept some 
time in cold weather by first frying the cakes and then packing in 
small stone jars, with melted lard poured over to cover them. 
When used, set the jar in hot water to soften the mass. I\>ui wfl 
the surplus fat and take out the cakes ; re-fry them slightly. 



220. Brains. — Pour boiling water over the brains and let it 
remain for a short time ; remove them from the water, and skin 
them. Beat in two or three eggs, according to the quantity oJ 
brains ; season with salt and pepper ; have a tablespoonful of hird 
in the frying-pan ; when hot pour in the brains, stirring fre- 
quently until done. 



221. Hock.— One pound rump steaK ; the same of pork steak; 
i half loaf of baker's bre id— trim off the crust ; chop Jl to- 
getlier like sausage-meat; season with salt, pepper, and sage; 
/brm into a loaf, and bake like bread. When it begins t* baka, 
rub a teaspoonf ll of lard all over it.

utes before serving ; when it warms, barte well and frequently. 
This is better than frying or broiling. 

222. Soger's Meat Fritter Receipt Modified. — Put a pound of 
rUle bread to soak in just enough sweet milk or water to moisten 
it ; the same quantity of cold boiled or roasted meat ; if baked 
or roasted meat is used, pare off any hard skin ; use sufficient fat 
from the meat ; chop in small dice rather fine ; press the watoi 
out of the bread. Put in a clean frying-pan two ounces of buttei 
or lard, two teaspoonfuls of chopped onion, and fry two 
minutes ; add the bread, stir with a wooden spoon until the bread 
is somewhat dry, then add the meat. Season the mass with a 
teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, and half a grated 
nutmeg. Stir all together thoroughly, and break in two eggs 
Deaten together a few minutes; mix this rapidly with the bread, 
and pour out into a dish immediately to cool. Roll it into egg- 
like shapes; dip m raw egg, flour them, and fry a light brown 
color. Serve upon a napkin. Send to table with it a tureen of 
tomato sauce. This makes a good stuffing before made into 
bdlK 



223. • To Prepare Chickens for Frying. — After they are cleaned 
cut off the feet, then the limbs. Cut a slit at the bottom of the 
breast bone; take out the intestines, being careful not to break 
U13 gall-bag; divide the breast; cut the back in two pieces; 
separate the neck from the merry-thought. Take the giblets, viz., 
v iie heart, liver and gizzard ; cut the gizzard opea, empty it, and 
remove the sand ; w ash all well, and, strewing over a little salt, 
let it remain, if for breakfast, over night. Chickens are not good 
croked immediately after being killed. When circumstancet 
compel the cooking dhectly they are killed, either fry them be

fore the animal heat has escaped, or as soon as killed thicw their 
into a tub of cold water before picking them ; keep them in this 
condition until needed, then pick and elean them. 



224. To Fry. — Roll each piece in flour or corn meal ; ft > it. 
plenty of boiling lard. Should the lard become bet enough U 
aooieh the outside, lessen the fire; turn frequently; cover th* 
par. with a tin plate ; fry slowly. " To boil in lard" is the proper 
way to "fry" chicken. To make the gravy: Pour oif the lard, 
strain it, and keep it for other purposes. Put a large tablespoon- 
ful heaped of butter into the pan ; rub into it a dessert-spoonful 
of flour; set this upon the fire; stir it while melting, and unti 1 
the butter has a rich golden color. Season with pepper and rait 
Pour in half a tumbler of boiling water; as soon as it boils up 
once, pour it over the chicken. Send a dish of rice, homing, or 
hominy cakes to table as an accompaniment 



225. To Fry Chicken in Batter. — Half fry the chicken 1 y the 
foregoing receipt; then dip it in a thin fritter batter and finish 
the frying. The gravy may be made as for the fried chicken, or 
in either case the lard used in frying will answer; add a littla 
flour, stirring it in smoothly, and pour in half a tumblei of boil- 
ing water. Never pour gravy over meats fried in balcer, but 
send it to the table in a sauce-boat. 



220. To Brown Fricassee Chicken. — Cut up the fowl as for fiy 
ing; roll the pieces in flour. Put a large tablespoonful of lard 
into a spider or shallow oven, and when boiling hot lay th# 
cMeken in ; let it fry slowly until a good brown color upon both 
tides. If the taste of onion is liked, cut up one fine of the silver 
skin variety. Draw the chicken one side and fry this a light 
brown, stirring it frequently. Stir it v\ ith the chicken; dredg-a 
in a dessert-spoonful of flour smooth!)-, and pour in a pint cf boil 
ing water; cover with the oven lid, and stew gently a quarter o/ 
an hour. The onions may be omitted if not agreeable, and a tea 



12(5 

spoonful of i<arsley used for seasoning and added with the Wiling 
water. A tablespoonful of curry powder mixed with the flour 
used for thickening the gravy will convert this into a dish cf cur- 
tied fowl. 



227. To Fricassee Old Chickens. — First stew them until terv 
ier. With a sharp knife remove the largest bones ; floui ihs 
pi3CC3 and fry them a light brown color, and pour into the frying 
pan a tumblerful of the broth they w r ere stewed in. Dredge in 
an even tablespoonful of flour, cover the pan with a lid, and stew 
lie til the gravy is thick enough. Pour this over the fowl, and 
serve hot. Onion shred fine may be used if the flavor. is relished, 
or parsley chopped fine. 



228. Turkey Cutlets. — Kill a large gobbler ; hang him up 
*' veral days before using; then, with a sharp knife, take as many 
cutlets from the thighs and breast as may be needed, and fry or 
fricassee them. Continue to cut them until all that will answer 
the purpose is used, then put the carcass, dissected, into the soup- 
icettle, with a slice or two of ham or fresh meat; it will aid in 
making good soup. Serve without gravy, and pour over melted 
butter. Season upon the plate with French mustard or any kind 
>of catsup preferred. Should the common gravy be preferred, 
make it as for brown fricassee. 



220. Croquets of Poultry. — Take any kind of cold fowl ; re- 
move the skin and sinews; chop the meat very fine; pound it in 
a i uiible mortar, or grind it; soak an equal quantity of stale 
brctd ir. just sweet milk enough to moisten it (this should be 
making while the meat is being prepared). Press the milk out 
x f the bread, adding nearly an equal quantity of butter; work 
tflto the mixture the yolks of three eggs boiled hard and grated 
teason with nutmeg, salt and pepper. Beat the whites of twe 
eggs to a froth ; stir them into the mixture; mold in a \vinet'la?s, 
or make in cakes or balls and fry in hot lard. H the mixture if 
too btiilj moisten wrth a little cream, lake thein up clear of 



MEATS. \T* 

grease — a perforated skimmer will do this better than a spoon; 
lay a napkin upon a flat dish, and lay the croquets upon that. 
Garnish with lemon cut in rings, parsley or celery ; serve pickl« 
with it in a separate dish. A handsome way of serving croquet* 
or meat salads, is to form upon a flat dish, the shape of the dh,l\ 
• wall two inches high with rice boiled soft, or Irish potake* 
boiled mashed and rubbed through a colander ; add a little milk 
to make them soft enough to be rubbed through. Boil three or 
four eggs hard ; take the yolks out carefully and grate them fine ; 
cut the whites in rings of uniform size ; put the yolk evenly upon 
the outside of the wall. Put the dish a few minutes in the stove, 
merely to harden not brown the wall. Place the rings tastily 
around the wall upon the outside, sticking a row of cloves upon 
the edge to keep them in place. The space inside may be filled 
ivith croquets-salad, force-meat balls or small birds, making a 
beautiful supper dish. 



231. Bice Croquets. — Wash and pick well a teacup of rice; 
boil it in three tumblerfuls of sweet milk ; season with salt, pepper, 
and nutmeg if liked. Stir the rice frequently when it is nearly 
done, to prevent its scorching. When thick and dry, spread it 
upon a dish to cool. Chop fine, and pound in a marble mortar, 
oysters, and any kind of cold fowl, fresh meat, liver, kidney or 
fisn, equal quantities; a teaspoonful of butter heaped. Make the 
rice into balls; hollow each one, and in the centre put a su/Kcient 
quantity of the meat mixture to nearly fill the opening; close the 
hole securely, roll the bails in the beaten yolk of egg, then in 
bread crumbs, and fry in boiling lard. These may be varied by 
seasoning the rice with lemon, vanilla, or with cheese, andataifiiig 
the balls with any kind of jelly, jam, or dried fruit. These mak« 
ft nice dessert, with arrowroot or cream sauce. 



231. Brain Croquets. — Let the brains — calf or heg — soak an 
hour, to remove all coagulated blood ; parboil them five or sii 
minutes; take them up and season highly with pepper; »alt W 



128 MRS. HILL 8 NEW COOK JOOK. 

taste ; just sage enough to be recognized ; a third as nvjch bread 
or cracker crumbs as brains. Work all together with two table* 
apoonfuls of sweet, rich cream, and the white of an egg whipped 
to a strong froth. If too moist, add a little more bread irumbs 
make into balls, roll them in raw yolk of an egg and bieai 
Truinbs, or sifted corn meal, and fry. 



232. Force-meat Balls. — Take half a pound of veal or very ten 
der beef, half a pound of bacon or nice kidney suet if preferred ; 
beat them fine together in a marble mortar, or grind them in a 
sausage grinder ; add a small teacup of bread crumbs moistened 
with cream. Season with half a nutmeg, half a teaspoonful of mace, 
an even tablespoonful of chopped parsley ; pepper and salt to 
taste. Work all together with a well-beaten egg. If the paste i» 
too stiff add another egg or only the yolk, or a little more cream. 
If not stiff enough they will fall to pieces. Fry in hot lard 
They should be the size of a nutmeg, if for soup ; larger, if to be 
served with roast. 



233. To Fry Ham. — Cut the ham in thin slices ; pare off the 
skin. If the ham is old or very salt, lay the meat in tepid water 
an hour before frying. Put in the spider or frying-pan, a tea- 
spoonful of lard. When it is moderately hot put in the ham ; 
turn frequently. Ham requires but little lard, but it is always 
best to have some. Always warm the pan before putting in the 
ham. To make the gravy : Dredge in flour enough to slightly 
thicken it — a teaspoonful of flour will be sufficient for half a dozen 
feliees ; pour in a wineglass of hot water, let it boil up, and tliei 
p *ur it over the ham, which has been taken out before making tru 
gnvy thick. 

234. Ham Fried in Bailer. — Tnke slices of boiled ham —the/ 
should not be cut large ; season them with pepper ; salt will pro- 
bably not be needed. Make a thin fritter batter, dip the ham in 
*nd [r^ as directed in the receipt for frying 4iam. Take each

lun laid in a shallow dish; or roll the ham first in egg, then in 
bread crumbs ; press the crumbs on with the back of a spoon • il 
necessary, dip them twice. Only two or three minutes Are 
enquired U cork them. 



235 Broiling. — Broiling is an expeditious way of cooking 
meats, but is only suitable when the article cooked is to be 
eaten immediately. The apparatus necessary to conduct the pro- 
cess is extremely simple, being only a gridiron. The best kind 
have small concave bars, with a trough attached for catching the 
gravy, and should slant a little ; that is, should be a little higher 
before The legs should be of sufficient length to elevate the meat 
from six to eight inches above the fine. Always keep the gridiron 
bright and clean ; the cook should never put it away after using 
it, without first thoroughly cleaning it. The fire must be well 
attended to ; if the fire is poor and cannot be made better, abandon 
the idea of broiling upon a gridiron ; the cooking can be more 
satisfactorily performed in an oven or frying-pan, by what M. 
Soyer calls " semi-frying or sauteeing." Good solid coals are abso« 
lutely necessary to success in broiling. Place the gridiron upon 
them after rubbing the bars with a little suet or lard, not enough 
to drip. The bars should be moderately hot before placing th* 
meat upon them. If they are cold the meat will broil unequally, 
as the bars keep away as much heat as their breadth covers. Tun 
\ht article which is being cooked frequently. Some cooks say 
' ioey should not have a moment's rest." This is, I suppoit, 
a exaggerated expression, simply meaning that rapid and frequer' 
nnung is best. The cook should so arrange her ousiness as not 
o leave the gridiron a moment from the time the thing to be cooked 
ta laid upen it until it is sent to the table upon a hot dish under a 
well-fitting cover ; and it is due to the cook that the mistress of th« 
house should not permit the dish to chill upon the table through 
the inattention or carelessness of servants or any useless ceremo 
nies of thi \ab] z. " Depend upon it there is a great deal i* dome» 



ISO 

tic happiness n a well-dressed mutton eh* p, on i *.:dy nreakfael 
table. Men grow sated of music, are often too wearied for eoiv 
tersation, however intellectual ; but they can always appreciate 
* well-swept hearth and smiling comfort. A woman tray love 
her husband, may sacrifice fortune, friends, family and country for 
him ; she may have the genius of Sappho, the enchanting beaut iet 
of Armida; but a melancholy fate awaits her if she fail to make 
his home comfortable, and his heart will inevitably forsake her. 
Better submit to household duties, even should there be no pre- 
dilection for them, than doom herself to a loveless home. Women 
of a higher order of mind will not run this risk ; they know that 
their feminine, their domestic duties, are their first duties." 



236. Old FgWs Steak. — Cut the steak in pieces as large at 
the hand, pass each piece through a sausage-grinder, which will 
merely break the fibres. Have a griddle almost red-hot — a bat- 
ter-cake griddle is best. Turn the pieces constantly and rapidly 
Until brown, and only half done. Have ready in a stew-pan a 
tablespoonful of butter heaped, with a teaspoonful of flour 
rubbed into it. Let this be hot, stir it well, and drop the steak 
in, stirring it well in the butter ; add half a tea-cup of boiling 
water, cover closely, and stew, shaking the pan frequently. When 
doae, Thich will require very few minutes, serve immediately in 
a fe(: t covered dish. Add salt and pepper after dishing the steak. 



237. To Bioil Bt$f Steak, No. 2.— The meat should be hung 
msral day? before using, if the weather is cool. Having hung 
long erough, cut the sterJks half an inch thick, three inches wide 
aid five inches long. Thus divided, it is a good size for manag 
mj5 or. the gridiron, and as much as a person wou!d care to have 
on their plate at onje. Should one part be thicker than the rest, 
toll it with a rolling-pin, or very gently beat it out to the same 
thickness. The practice of beating steal. «s very injudicious, "it 
Vreaks the cells which contain the juices ;" this escaping, the meat 
kcomes dry aud tasteless; bitter always give the meat time to

become tender and ripe foi the gridiron. Swecr the hearth clean* 
give the dust a few minutes to settle; prepare a bed of brisk 
solid coals; have the gridiron looking as bright as a mirror ; rub 
the bars well with brown paper, or grease them slightly with 
suet or lard, not enough to drip, for this falling on the coals would 
produce smoke. Place the gridiron on the coals, and as soon as 
hot (not hot enough to scorch) lay on the steak, and turn fre- 
quently with meat-tongs or a knife. A fork, if -nserted in the 
Rteak, will injure its condition by making " taps to let out the 
juice." I am conscious of repeating this caution often ; I have 
done so because of the great carelessness of cooks in this matter 
To have the most palpable duties performed satisfactorily re- 
quires " line upon line and precept upon precept." The dish upon 
which the steak is to be placed must be hot ; put in the dish a 
large slice of good, sweet butter, and add two tablespoonfuls of 
tomato or mushroom catsup ; stir these together as the butter 
warms ; lay in the slices, and turn each slice over, so that all may 
be covered alike with the gravy. This should be done very 
hastily, and the steak sent immediately to the table; small space 
should be allowed between the broiling and the eating, to have it 
In perfection. With a well prepared sauce and proper accom 
paniments there is not a more elegant breakfast dish, and when 
the meat is juicy and tender, and the broiling performed with 
skill and dispatch, there is not a more delicate way of preparing 
this deservedly popular dish. The steak is underdone if, upon 
cutting, red gravy flows ; a few more moments should be allowed 
for dressing, as the rare appearance of meat of any kind is dis 
g isting to persons of good taste. 



238. To Broil Steak Another Way.— This can be done very 
conveniently upon the stove by using the batter-cake griddle. 
Heat it very hot; while the griddle is being heated, place in an 
earthen dish a large tablespoo.nful of butter into which a dessert- 
spoonful if flour has been stirred, a tcaspor nful of salt, half a 
teaspoonful of peeper, two tablespoonfuls of mushroom, tomato 



132 MRft. hill's new cook book. 

or walnut catsup ; place this dish on the coolest part of the *cotb 
The griddle being ready, lay <*n the steak, and turn the pieces 
constantly with tongs or a knife ; when it feels firm when pressed 
it is done ; then lay the pieces in the dish, putting some of the 
gravy on each steak ; serve upon a hot dish. This is a sirpf.it 
out excellent way of cooking steak. For steak to be delightful 
\nd delicate, the meat should be juicy, kept until ripe ; the giiJcIli 
hot ; the meat turned constantly ; the seasoning of the right kind 
and quantity ; the dish upon which it is to be served, not; nursed 
with care from beginning to end; and lastly, eaten as soon as 
cooked. The advantage of placing the meat upon a very hot 
griddle, is, that the fibres on the surface contract, and this almost 
entirely prevents the natural juices from escaping, and in propor 
tion to the loss of the juice the meat becomes dry and tasteless. 



239. Another Way. — Cut the steaks an inch thick; make a 
few incisions in each piece of meat; this must be done after the 
meat has hung as long as is prudent. Prepare a marinade, by 
mixing in a deep dish two tablespoonfuls of salt, one of pepper, 
two of vinegar, four of mushroom catsup; turn the pieces in the 
mixture; let it lie all night; dust each piece lightly with flour, 
and broil over a quick fire ; serve on a hot dish and butter well. 
This is a good breakfast dish, and is best cut from the ribs of the 
sirloin. 



240. To Broil Round Steak. — Cut a pound and a half of steak 
from the round; saw neatly through the bone; let it be from 
ihree-quarters to an inch thick, cut of the same size. Who n the 
teak is large and thick, the process of broiling iauot be slowet 
than for thinner pieces, and the turning less frequent. If there is 
diversity of tastes in the family, one end, by placing it nearest 
the fire, can be cooked as much more than the other as is desir *d. 
The cook must acquaint herself with the tastes of those for wlu.in 
sue works, and spare no pains to please ; have the dish upon 
which it is to be served warm, and when the steak is moved, 



MEATS. 



133 



■houM there be any gravy alout it, liokl the pie.e*. between tho 
steak tongs over the warm dish , and let it drip. It requires 
practice and close attention to decide upon the exact roo nenk 
when the steak is done, neither over nor underdone. When it 
is just ready to be dished, season with salt and pepper, and laj 
butter on and over the steak. Onions, curry powder and musb- 
ro< ms are used for seasoning ; but as tastes differ as much as faces, 
it is a good arrangement to serve with sauces separately, Among 
the receipts for sauces will be found several good ones for steaks, 
chops, etc. The housewife should select different ones for different 
times, and thus give a pleasing variety to the same dish. 



241. Another Way of Cooking a Pound or More of Steak. — 
After hanging until tender, season with onions, pepper, salt, etc.; 
lay I on a well-covered stew-pan; set it on the fire, without 
water; it must have a strong heat, but not burn; turn frequently 
until dune, and serve with its own gravy. 



242. To. Cure Beef for Broiling. — After the steak has hung as 
long as it can, without spoiling, cut it in pound pieces, and tc 
every piece rub on a teaspoonful of salt, one of black pepper, and 
as much saltpetre pulverized as can be held between the finger 
and thumb; rub this on well. Lay them upon a dish, and 
cover with a thin muslin cloth, that will protect it from the flies, 
without excluding the air. Set the dish in a cool place. Let it 
lemain two days (unless it will taint, then less time), turning 
them over every day. The second night hang the pieces in a 
£ark, cool place. Next morning broil as much as may be 
needed. 



243. Another Way. — When kept until there is danger of taint- 
ing, bake half done and broil ; pour over melted butter. Spiced 
underdone beef is excellent broiled and buttered, or broiled 
until brown upon both sides. Put in a stew-pan with a little 
water or cold gravy, butter and pepper, and stew ten minute*. 



134 mrs. hill's new cook book. 

241. To Broil Dried or Jerked Beef. — Cut the slices thin; lay 
them an hour in tepid water ; then broil them until thoroughly 
hot; turn the pieces once. Put them upon a hot dish; buttei 
well, and serve. 



2 15. Veal Cutlets. — Cut the steaks from the fillet (upper part 
of the leg); divide the meat into three parts. There is a natural 
indication of where the division should be. The flat squara 
piece is best for cutlets. Cut them half an inch thick. Mix to- 
gether in a deep earthen pan a teaspoonful of salt, half a tea. 
spoonful of pepper, a tablespoon ful of butter into which has been 
rubbed a dessert-spoonful of flour ; catsup, if liked. Heat the 
gridiron warm ; lay the cutlets upon the bars ; turn once ; then 
fay them in the gravy ; put them again on the gridiron ; turn 
once. Continue this until the cutlets are done. Lay them on a 
hot dish ; pour the gravy over, and serve. This quantity cf sea- 
soning will answer for a pound of cutlets. Veal should be hung, 
and wiped dry every day it is kept. Never lay it v^GL wood; 
&m keeps it moist. 

S40. Broiling VutHs, — M. Soyer gives a very delicate, way 
^C broiling ciiie&. Any kind of fresh meat will answer :— 

WV-sn the meat has been kept long enough to be tender, cut 
and broil them slightly. Lay then r\ a seasoning of bread 
crumbs, an egg beaten, salt and pepper (a little nutmeg, if 
liked), a tablespoonfiil of baiter, a few mushrooms chopped, or 
onions, if preferred. Let them stand until cold ; place a small 
quantity of the seasoning, wei. mixed, upon each cutlet, And roll 
Isg them secirely, wrap in well buttered foolscap papc r, by lay 
tog the mpfl* on one end of the r»aper, bringing the other end 
over, and folding the edges so tnat n0 ne of the gravy can escape*^ 
Place them upon a gridiron at i east e j g ht inches above the fire, 
and broil slowly half an ho an £j e careful that the fire does not 
blaz.i. -% llemove the pap erSj im( \ ser ve upon a hot dish. A this 
aiicu of pork or bacon, vVf app fc d with the cutlets, is an improvement *

247. Veal Steak (Excellent). — Take a handful of any scrapj 
or stringy parts of veal, tvvc or three slices of poik, l.hret table 
spoonfuls of chopped onions, r*H and pepper; put them in a 
stew-pan with two tumblerfuls of hot water. Cover the stew pan 
End let it simmer until the juice is all extracted from the meat 
Strain the brotli ; wipe out the stew-pan; return the broth *o it, 
8tir into the stew-pan a tablespxmful of butter, into which Lu 
been worked a teaspoonful of flour, two teaspoonfuls of French 
mustard. Let this simmer slowly. 

Have the cutlets cut ready ; heat the gridiron while the broth 
is simmering ; broil them upon both sides a light brown color. 
Drop them into the gravy after it is strained, and stew ten 
minutes. Instead of broiling, the cutlets may be first fried. 



248. Steak " Devilled" — Cut a round steak weighing a pound ; 
saw through the bone. Broil slowly, basting frequently with a 
sauce made by mixing thoroughly a large table-spoonful of butter. 
a tablespoonful of good English mustard, a wineglass of good 
strong cider vinegar, half a teaspoonful of Cayenne pepper, the 
same of black, or, instead of the pepper, use an even tablespoon- 
ful of curry powder, and a slight flavoring of tomato catsup. This 
style of cooking steak is called " devilling" The seasoning 
should be highly pungent, so as to leave no doubt of its paternity. 
Underdone meat may be warmed with this style of seasoning, 
uj>on the table, in a chaffing-dish, a-la-blase. A very good pro- 
portion for a dish containing half a dozen slices, is one table 
spoonful of butter, three of vinegar, one teaspoonful of loaf 
sugar powdered, and stirred into the vinegar, one tal lespoonful 
of French mustard, or less of the English; season highly will 
black and Cayenne pepper. Put this m xture in the chafllng-dish. 
When it melts stir it well, and lay in thin slices of cold ham, 
veal, venison, etc.; co'd turkey legs, liver, kidneys, are all good 
prepared with this seasoning. When kidneys are broiled, a verj 
■mall wire should be run through them to prevent their curling.

mallet. Trim the sharp end of the bone round and scrape it 
l( there is too much fat, trim off some; broil plain, tinning fr©» 
(pently. Have the gridiron prepared according to the direction* 
givei. *br broiling. If the meat has not been kept until tender, 
beat the meat slightly; but it is best to keep the meat hanging 
several days before it is used. In dishing, turn the sharp endi 
cf the bone in; use a hot dish; pour over melted butter; season 
upon the plate with any kind of catsup, or made sauce preferred. 
They are excellent laid in melted butter, rolled in fine bread 
crumbs or corn meal ; the first is best ; turn frequently, and be 
sure the bread does not scorch. They may, if the trouble is not 
objected to, after being laid in butter, be seasoned with curry 
powder, or simply pepper and salt ; lay in buttered paper ; pin 
the paper securely ; twist the ends ; broil upon the gridiron care* 
fully ; turn frequently. The paper must not burn, it would injure 
the taste of the meat. Serve, when sufficiently done, without the 
paper, upon a hot dish. Make a broth by boiling in a stew-pan 
any scraps of the meat useless for any other purpose. Strain this 
when the juice of the meat is extracted. A pint of broth will be 
sufficient. Make it rich with butter. Season with wine or catsup 
Send to the table in a sauce-boat. Rice or hominy, and hot Irish 
potatoes, should accompany them. 



250. Mutton Steaks. — Cut them from the leg, half an inch 
thick ; pepper well ; broil quickly, turning frequently ; baste 
well with butter. Should the fire blaze up, remove the gridiron 
jntil it is put out. Strew over the coals a little ashes. The 
taste of those for whom they are prepared should be consulted ai 
to how much the steak should be cooked. When sufficiently 
done, place in a hot covered dish, and pour over caper sauce, 01 
■erve with mushroom sauce. Turtle and rabbit steaks are axcel 
lent prepared in this way. 



MEATS. 13*) 

251. Mutton C/.fr.'tf.-— Out them from 'he rimnd or thick pari 
of the leg; roll them slightly with the rolling-pin; pepper, and 
dusl very lightly with Hour. Lay them upon a dish until you 
can put in a stew-pan or gravy-kettle a tablespoonful of onion 
ihrc-d fine (If the flavor of onion is liked), three tablespoonfuls cf 
finegar, three of tomato catsup, pepper and salt to taste, or« 
even tumbler of melted butter, six tablespoonfuls of warm water; 
btew together until the onion is tender, and the gravy thickens a 
little, stirring frequently. Broil the cutlets nicely. Take them 
up on a hot dish, and pour the gravy over them. Lamb and 
venison steak may be prepared in the same way. Send with 
them a dish of hot Irish potatoes. 



252. To Grill a Shoulder Blade of Lamb or Pork. — Separate 
the blade bone from the ribs. Stew it half done with very little 
water ; keep the stew-pan covered. When half done take it up 
gash it over; broil slowly, basting frequently with a sauce made 
as for the "Devilled Steak." Pour over, after it is dished, any 
sauce that remains. Serve hot. 



25f . Pork Steaks. — The tenderloin is best for these. Cut them 
thin ; pepper, and dust lightly with flour. They require longer 
broiliiig than any other fresh meat, and are not good unless well 
done. Sprinkle over a little salt just before they are done. 
Rub into a tablespoonful of butter a teaspoonful of powdered 
sage ; place this upon a hot dish ; lay the steak upon it; turn each 
piece once; cover the dish, and serve immediately. Fried apples 
or sweet potatoes are good eaten with port steak. The aa^« 
tnay be omitted if not relished. 



MA. Pork Sparerib — is excellent broiled. Baste constantly 
with butter. Very few persons baste it sufficiently, hence it if 
not ^infrequently brought to the table dry and tasteJ.ss. It re 
quire* neither gravy nor seasoning. 



L3S MRS. niLL8 NEW COOK BOOK. 

255. To Broil Ham.— Cut tfte slices thin and of x uniform 
aize. Should one fart be thicker ihan another, roll the thiei 
part with the roll ng-pin. If very salt, soak, an hour at least, in 
tepid water, Broil over a brisk fire, turning almost constantly 
VJttfD done, butter and pepper well. An omelet, or eggs cooke< 
n »ome wa] , should always &r~ompany broiled ham, unless whei 
ht *J8 served for supper. A nice breakfast dish. 



256. Broiled Sweetbreads. — As soon as taken from the tnima 1 , 
lay them in warm water; then wash them well; soak until th« 
blood is removed ; parboil them five or six minutes ; take them 
up, and drop them in cold water ; slice them ; remove all strings 
and gristle. Broil over good solid coals; turn frequently. 
Have a few slices of fresh butter upon a warm dish ; lay the 
sweetbreads upon it; turn once. Pepper them well, and serve 
immediately. Oyster sauce is an elegant accompaniment. 



257. To Broil Chickens. — The fowl must be fat and young ; no 
ether kind is fit for the gridiron. After it is picked, open it by 
3utting down the back; remove the intestines; wash it well; 
keep it at least twelve hours, if the weather will admit. Warm 
and grease the gridiron ; lay the fowl down with the inside next 
to the fire. Have a small oven lid, washed upon the inside per 
fectly clean, and wiped dry until it will not smut ; put this upon 
the chicken; weight this down with a flat-iron. Broil slowly. 
When done — and it is seldom well done — pour over the fowl 
melted butter. Stew the giblets half done ; then pepper them 
ifell, and finish upon the gridiror. 



268. To Smother Fowls. — This is an excellent way to cook 
young ducks, turkeys guinea fowls, etc. Clean the fowl as in the 
foregoing receipt. Dust it well with flour. Put it in a shallow 
oven or stove-pan ; four in a tumbler of warm water: cover with 
an oven lid, or a plate if cooked in the stove. As soon as tht 
fcwl-is'warin, begin to baste with fresh good butter ; continue tc 



MKAT8 138 

t>*0fo frequently until it is nearly done. Fomove the ccvei and 
brown the fowl. Dredge the fowl with flour, sprinkling very Uttl« 
into the gravy. Cook the giblets with tLe fowl ; mince them ; add 
to the gravy, and pour over the fowl. This mode of cooking ii 
between baking and broiling, and is a more satisfactory process thai 
plain broiling. Squirrels, and the hind legs and loins of rabbit* 
ire good cooked in this way. Serve with the game a piquant sauce. 



259. To Broil Sty*abs, Birds, etc. — Squabs, or young pigeons, 
Are sometimes objected to as having a soft, immature taste. 
The reason of this oojection is, they are cooked too young. 
Their finest growth is wnen they are just full-feathered. When 
they are in pin feather, they are flabby; when they are full- 
grown, and have flown some time, they are tough. It is a good 
plan to mark them before, chey can fly, by cutting off a toe. In 
that way their age can be kept. Pick them ; open them upon the 
back; clean and wash weH. Broil upon a clear fire, turning fre- 
quently, and each time bas*.i«g with butter. Lay toast upon the 
bottom of a hot covered di^n (a chafing-dish is best) ; melt to- 
gether a tablespoonful of butter, into which has been stirred half 
& teaspoonful of flour and a wineglass of sweet milk. When just 
ready to boil, place the squabs upon the toast, and pour over the 
sauce. Cover up the dish, and serve immediately. This receipt 
will answer for any kind of small, tender bird. Serve with 
tomato sauce or catsup. 



200. To Barbecue Any Kind of Fresh Meat. — Gash the meat 
Broil slowly over a solid fire. Baste constantly with a rmios 
composed of butter, mustard, red and black pepper, vu.egar 
Mix these in a pan, and set it where the sauce w?" keep warm, 
not hot. Have a swab made by tying a piece of clean, soft cloth 
upon a stick about a foot long ; dip this in the sauce and bast« 
with it. Where a large carcass is baibecued, it is usual to dig a 
pit in the ground outdoors, and lay narrow bars of wood acrtnM. 
Very early in the morning fill the pit with wood; set it burn ng 



I4C mrs. uill's new cook book. 

and in this way heat it very hot. When the wood has burned te 
coals, lay the meat over. Should the fire need replenishing, keep 
a fire outside burning, from which draw oals, and scatter evenly 
in the pit under the meat. Should there be any sauoe left pr.ui 
It over the meat. For barbecuing a joint, a large giidiic* 
ftiswers well ; it needs constant attention ; should be cooned 
•lowly and steadily. 



261. Meat Pies. — Considering the popularity of these dishes, 
few make their appearance upon the table unless illy prepared. 
In nine cases out often they are either tough and leathery, or so 
rich that it is beyond the capacity of a stomach of good powers 
to digest. The top crust (usually) is hastily baked, scorched 
and blistered ; the bottom crust not baked at all y or insufficiently, 
and thoroughly saturated with rich gravy. These are the 
extremes ; but how few avoid them ! Where the meat is cooked 
in the pastry, I think they cannot, under any kind of manage- 
ment, be heathful, particularly for children and dyspeptics; but 
with care and judgment they may be made savoury and relishing. 

A less objectionable way of preparing them is to bake them in 
a mould ; stew the flesh or fowl, add the seasoning, and pour 
it into the pastry after it is done. For instance : — 



2G2. An Oyster Pie. — Make a light pufT paste dough; cover it, 
and set it in a cold place an hour ; line a drum-shaped mould 
with the paste ; brush the edge next to the bottom, on the inside, 
with the white of an egg; lay upon the bottom a piece of the 
dough rolled round to fit, and let it turn up half an inch upon the 
inside ; press it against the sides upon which the white of the egg 
is, so as to cement them together. Lay across the top of the 
mould, crossed in different directions, large broom strawa, 
washed clean. This will support the lid, and prevent its falling 
j). While the pastry is baking get the oysters ready; put 
enough to fill the mould in a stew-pan; they must be well 
oovered with their own liquor. Grate in the yolks of two hard 



MEATS. Ml 

Doiled eggs; rub into a large tab'espoonful cf ?re«h I uttei 

a dessert-spoonful of Hour; put this to the oysters. Stew five 01 
six minutes, or until the o) sters begin to shrink , add a wine- 
glass of rich, sweet cream. A- soon as the mould is ready, tak< 
eff ike top crust; remove the t Astry from the mould, and put a 
Id a handsome circular, deep dish. Pour in the o)steis; rep'aue 
Che top crust, and serve hot. If left standing too long, th» 
bottom crust will imbibe so much of the gravy as to make 
It heavy and sodden. Some persons like; this pie seasoned with 
mace — use it if relished. Instead of the straws to support the 
lid of the mould, slices of light bread are sometimes used to O 
\K When the crust is done, remove the bread and pound it fL.e 
for soups, puddings, etc., etc. Send part of the gravy to table in 
* gravy-boat, using only enough in the pie to moisten the meaf 
well. 



203. Veal and Oyster Pie. — Cut thin slices of veal from the 
neck; stew them until tender; season highly with pepper; 
salt to taste. Put the oysters in a separate stew-pan; add a 
lump of butter rolled in Hour. Bake the crust in a mould as for 
the oyster pie. After the crust is baked remove it from the 
mould ; put it iu a deep dish to suit the shape of the mould ; put 
in a layer of veal and one of oysters, repeating until all are in ; 
the oysters must be on top. Stir into the gravy (mix the two 
gravies) the beaten yolks of two eggs; let it stew just lung 
enough to take off the raw taste of the egg; pour it into the pie ; 
replace the lid, and serve hot. Chicken and oysters, and fish and 
oysters, are used together for pies, and are much relished ; com- 
bine the ingredients and seasoning to suit the taste ; wine and 
»tsup may be used in the gravy if liked. The whole of the 
jravy should not be served in the pie ; send part in a gravy 
boat. Birds stewed and seasoned highly are good fci these pies 



204 Chicken Pie. — Cut up the chicken as for frying. Stew it 
gently with a seasoning of pepper and bait until the fowl * nearlj 



142 MR8. hill's new cook book. 

done. Boil two large Irish ptatoes until they can be marhed 
smooth (first remove the skin) ; work to the potato as much 
flour as will make a smooth dougii , lay this aside for th( dun p- 
lings. Make the crust with a quart of flour, t teaspoc nful o) 
•rxla, a small teacup of lard, a teaspoonful of salt, and butternut* 
enough to make a smooth dough. Roll out the dough for the 
bottom and sides a quarter of an inch thick ; line a deep caithen 
dish with it. Cut the pieces intended for the sides in long strips 
(it is best made without piecing) ; put them around carefully. 
Roll a circular piece; lay this on the bottom. Lay in the 
chicken carefully; sprinkle in a little flour. Cut the potato 
paste in strips three inches square ; put in a layer of these. 
Hard-boiled eggs sliced, or cold Irish potatoes sliced, may be 
laid over the dumplings ; then another layer of chicken, dump- 
ings, <kc When the dish is full, take some of the broth that 
the chicken was stewed in and melt in it a large tablespoonfal 
of butter ; pour over the chicken, and sprinkle over a little flour 
Roll out a piece of the dough (or if it is wanted extra nice, make 
the upper crust of puff paste) large enough to cover the top of 
the dish ; cut it round, to fit ; notch the edge in any tasteful 
way ; cut a slit in the centre, and bake, without blistering, to a 
light brown color. Shallow pies are very good made in soup 
plates or tin pie plates ; may be kept a day or two in cook 
weather, and warmed over. 



2G5. Veal or Mutton Steak Pie. — Cut the steak in small 
pieces; beat it gently, and stew until tender, with a seasoning of 
salt, pepper, and (if spice is liked) half a grated nutmeg. Make 
the crust as for chicken pie. Line the earthen dish with it ; lay 
in the steak ; sprinkle over with flour, and lay over bits of butter. 
Cut in hard-baled eggs and Irish potatoes. Pour the dish three 
parts fuL of the broth after all the meat is in; put on the upper 
crust; cut a slit in the centre that the steam may escape. aLd 
bake. 

Venison pie made in the same way is very good. Pies maj 



MEATS. 14) 

also be made of pork, seasoned with onions ; and of rabbiis 01 
squirrels. These should all be boiled until tender; put in&ide the 
crust and baked or stewed until the meat is ready to fall from 
the bone ; seasoned highly with onions, Irish potatoes, parsley 
marjoram, tomatoes with a little sugar stirred to thejL, a little 
mace or nutmeg, if liked, and catsup or wine. Serve in a " vol 
insert, 1 or large mould made of light puff paste, as for lh»> 
o\ster pie — the stew, just before serving, poured into it, using 
very 'ittle gravy in the pie, sending most of it in the gravy-boat. 



266. Rice Chicken Pie. — Cut up the chicken as for frying. 
Stew it with the giblets (and a little cold ham cut up fine) until 
the meat will leave the bones easily. Pick off the meat in largo 
strips, leaving only the meat on the small part of the pinions. 
Season the gravy with curry powder, or highly with pepper, » 
large tablespoonful of butter, an onion and a little parsley, if thej 
are liked. Boil a pint of rice with a little salt ; put a layer a 4 . 
this; then all of the chicken; pour in the gravy, and add a th : eli 
covering of the rice. (This may be too much rice, the quantity 
will depend upon the size of the fowl.) Bake half an hour, cr 
less time, in a moderate oven, or in a stove not too hot. For 
baking this, use a deep earthen dish, and send to the table in it. 



267. Pot Pies {"so-called") — Are best made in a deep oven, 
large or small, to suit the quantity made. Line the sides with 
the dough; lay the meat or poultry (or they may be used to- 
gether) on the bottom of the oven. Never put pastry at 
the bottom, and it is best to stew beforehand the meat or 
poultry to be used until half done, stewing the seasoning with 
them ; add butter, slice in raw Irish potatoes, an onion, potato 
dumplings by the receipt given for dumplings to chicken pie. A 
few mushrooms may be added, or oysters. The seasoning should 
be varied. The mistress of the house need be at no loss to give 
variety to these family dishes. A raised crust made with butter 
miik and soda makes 4 ,hc most healthful pastry, and, when inadi 



14*1 MRS. hill'p new cook book. 

with very little handling, is very good. Potato paste is alsa 
ver} suitable. When the meat, gravy, and dumplings are all in 
(the oven should be three parts full of broth), sprinkle in flo ir, 
aLd lay over an upper crust which lacks an inch, all arourd, M 
Uting. When the pie is done, take off the top crust in a eJeap 
plate. In the dish in which the pie is to be served, lay the meat j 
put the side crusts around, and lay the lid or upper crust over 
the whole. Send the gravy to the table in a sauce-boat or small 
tureen. Fish pies are good made in this way. Only large fish 
are used. 



208. Calipash. — The upper shell of the turtle is called the call 
l>ash — the under, the calipee. Scrape the meat from the calipash ; 
immerse the latter in tepid water ; rub and wash it until the shell 
is entirely clean ; wipe it dry ; cover the inside completely with 
« light pufif paste. Take enough of the nicest part of the turtle 
(using the coarser pieces for soup) to fill the shape; put this 
meat in a stew-pan, with a seasoning of salt, pepper, mace, or any 
sweet herb used in cooking which may be preferred. For 
pound of meat take a quarter of a pound of good fresh butter ; ruo 
into it a dessert-spoonful of flour ; drop this into the stew-pan ; 
cover with cold water. Put on the lid of the stew-pan, set it on 
the stove or on a trivet before the fire ; stew gently, skimming off all 
impurities until the meat is tender. Add a wineglass of mush- 
room catsup or any kind preferred, the same of Sherry wine. Stir 
all up and pour into the shell or calipash. Put on an upper ci ust, 
making it large enough to fit exactly ; notch it around tastily ; 
put a slit in the centre. Should there not be gravy enough, poui 
In sufficient boiling water to answer. Bake a light brown. Send 
lo the table on a square dish to fit, as nearly as can be, the shell. 
VS hen well arranged, this is a beautiful as well as savory lish. 



260. Irish Potato Pie. — Use any k nd of cooked meat ; if under 
done, all the better. Cut in slices, thin and of a uniform size; 
butter each piece well ; on one side pepper well. Have ready a 



MEATS. 

quart or more of Irish potatoes — the quantity must dt»j ?nd t») the 
size of the dish in which it is to be served, and this should bo an 
earthen one. Salt and stiain the potatoes through a colander 
Put a layer an inch thick on the bottom of the dish ; lay on tl '» 
the slices of meat, then small bits of butter; pour in a tumble] fill 
of hi Ah, made of gravy saved with the fresh cooked moa* of 
which the pie is male; or if no gravy has been saved, make of 
the trimmings of the meat as much as may be needed, and, if not 
rich enough, add a little butter ; or half broth and the rest hot 
cream. Put on a top crust of the strained potatoes. Place the 
dish in the stove or oven a quarter of an hour. Serve hot. 



270. Salmagundi. — Roil two calf's feet ; take the feet out when 
done ; reduce the broth to a quart. The feet may be fried and 
used, first removing the bone. Let the broth become cold in an 
earthen vessel ; scrape off all the grease ; wipe the top of the jelly 
with a coarse towel ; put the cake of jelly into a kettle lined with 
tin or porcelain ; season it with two lemons cut up (removing 
the seed), fine blades of mace, a stick of cinnamon, pepper (white 
pepper is best), and salt to taste. Beat to a froth the whites of six 
eggs ; stir these to the jelly just as it melts ; it must then be left 
to clarify and not stirred again. When it simmers long onough 
to look clear at the sides, strain it through a flannel bag before 
the fire; do not squeeze the bag. Suspend it by running a stick 
through a loop made by tying the bag ; rest each end of the stick 
upon a chair, and throw a table-cloth over all to keep out the 
dust. If the jelly does not run through clear the first time, pour 
it through the jelly-bag again. Set this aside. 

Prepare the meat and seasoning for the pie, Put into i stew 
pan slices of pickled pork, using a piece of pork tour inches 
iqunre ; if it is very salt, lay it an hour in tepid water. Cit up 
two young, tender chickens — a terrapin, if it is oonvenient — two 
or three young squirrels, half a dozen birds or squabs. Stew 
them gf nt!y, cutting up and adding a few sprigs of parsley. Roll 
into half a pound of butter two tablespoonfuis of Hour ; add thii

to the stew ; let t stew until the meat is nearly done. Line a fire- 
proof dish, or two fire-proof dishes (this quantity of stew wil fill 
two common-sized or quart dishes ;) with good pastry ; mix the 
different kinds of meats; put in Irish potato dumplings; sc.taon 
fcc taste ; poiu in the j*ravy and bake. When done, remove the 
upper crust when the pie is cold and pack in the jelly, heapiLg the 
jelly in the middle. Return the crust and serve cold or hot. 
The jelly will prevent them becoming too dry. They are good 
Christmas pies and will keep several days. Very little gravy 
should be used, and that rich. Should ihere be too much, leave the 
stew-pan open until reduced sufficiently. This kind of pie keeps 
well if made in deep plates, and by some is preferred to those baked 
in deep moulds. 



271. Meat Puffs. — Roll out a sheet of good paste; cut it into 
circular pieces by pressing upon the dough with a saucer; pass a 
sharp knife round the saucer. Lay upon the half of each circula: 
piece a spoonful of any kind of meat, poultry, fish, oysters, lob- 
sters, clams, etc., minced fine, and seasoned to taste. Wet with 
wine or catsup ; lay over the other half; crimp the edges, an<? 
bake or fry. Serve hot or cold. 



272. Meat Puddings. — These may be made of any kind of 
scraps of fresh meat — skin or gristle will not answer. A pound 
of meat will make a good-sized pudding. Chop the meat in very 
small pieces ; flour them well, and season with salt, pepper, a 
iitUe parsley and eschalot minced fine ; form it into a ball, using 
ft Title water to wet up the meat sufficiently to form the bull 
sprinkle a coat of flour over, and let it stand until the paste In 
made. Make this by Receipt No. 4 in the receipts for pastry. 
Roll out a circular piece of diugh sufficiently large to inclose the 
ball ; lay the meat in the centre of the dough, and carefully and 
securely close the edges, lapping them as little as possible 
Flour a pudding-cloth well ; inclose the lump of doug^i in it, 
allow iug a little room to swell; tie it carcful'y; boil briskly m 



MEATS. 14? 

plcrty of hot water to cover it. An hour of steady boiling will 
suffice for a pudding containing a po ind of meat and the season 
ing. Keep the vessel covered. When done, take the bag oat, 
dip it m cold water, and serve in a hot dnh exactly suited to it-i 
sizi, insist upon this, having seen tie pudding brought to 
table ir. a di a h so much too large as to make a very ridicu ] ouf 
figure. Ih's leceipt will answer for any kind of combinations of 
meat, head, i.ugue, oysters, poultry, liver, kidneys, ham, etc., audj 
instead of forming the meat into a ball, roll out the crust a quar- 
ter of an inch thick ; spread the meat and seasoning over ; rol) 
the pudding; tie it in a cloth, closing the ends well, and boil. 
Much of the palatableness of this dish depends upon the sauce. 
Let it be rich, and well seasoned. Directions are given in the 
sauce receipts. 



273. Another Style of Pudding. — Make it as a pie; tie a cloth 
over so as to prevent the water getting in, and boil ; or boil it in 
a mould ; line the sides and bottom of the mould ; add the meat, 
seasoning to taste; cover tight with a w r ell-fitting cover; boil and 
turn out. Serve with drawn butter. 



274. Virginia Chicken Pudding. — Stew two young chickens 
cut up as for frying ; season well with butter, pepper, salt, pars- 
ley, and onion shred fine. Make a batter of a quart of milk, six 
eggs beaten well ; stir to the eggs smoothly nine tablespoonfuls 
of flour; thin with the milk. Take the chicken from the stew-pan 
when tender, leaving out the necks ; place the pieces in an earthen 
dish; pour over the batter, and bake until the pudding is firnt, 
It should not be suffered to stand long before being eaten, or it 
^ill be tough. A tureen of rich sauce should accompany it* 
using as much of the broth in which the chicken was stewed as if 
needed for the foundation of the gravy ; add catsup of any kind. 
Instead of chicken, or combined with chicken, ousters, beefsteak, 
V«*l, ra --ill} kind of game, may bo js.;d.

275. Potato Pudding with Meat. — Boil half a dozen large Iris! 
potatoeB ; mash them through a colander add two beaten eggs 
butter, and milk to make a thick batter ; season highly with pcppci 
*nd salt Lay slices of underdone meat upon the bottom of ar 
farther dish ; pour over a layer of the batter, then meat, until the 
hsh is full, having the batter upon the top; bake a light brown 
/ery little cooking is necessary. 

276. Pease Pudding.— Soak nice white peas (of the kind caller' 
Cornfield) several hours in plenty of water ; tie them in a cloth 
allowing room to swell; boil; when tender, turn them out; masl 
them ; season with pepper and salt ; tie in a scalded cloth ; boil 
half an hour. From time immemorial this has been considered 
a proper accompaniment to boiled pork. 

277. Tomato Meat Pudding. — Cover the bottom of a puddh g- 
dish with bread crumbs; put on them a layer of underdone meal 
cut in thin slices, then a layer of tomatoes peeled and sliced ; tc 
a pint add an even tablespoonful of sugar ; then a few bits of 
butter, pepper and salt, a little onion if agreeable ; then bread 
crumbs, meat and tomatoes, repeating until the dish is full ; put

or for mince pies. To clean it, without removing the skin, put 
ft in enough iukcwarm water to entirely cover it; set the vessel 
where it will boil up once, just enough to scald the head. Take 
it up; scraps it well; when clean, wash and wipe dry ; split the 
lead and ]osr\ apart; take out the brains; cleanse the inside from 
11 coagulated blood; boil head and brains. Clean the feet in tht 
same way. 

Another way : Sprinkle powdered rosin over the whole kead ; 
scald in hot water; scrape clean; wash and soak well. 

The neck is stewed or used for soups. The ribs rray bo 
boiled, or boned, stuffed and baked, or roasted. Shin for soup. 
(Take out the marrow before cooking, and siew, strain, and flavor 
it for hair grease.) FL^k is good collared. The sirloin is to 
oe baked or roasted. The best steaks, called " Porter-house" 
steaks, are cut from the sirloin, using the ribs for soup. The 
tenderloin makes excellent steak. Rump may be used for 
steak, or be roasted, baked, daubed, made a-la-mode, or corned. 
Round is used in the same way. The heart is good stuffed and 
baked, or roasted, and boiled makes excellent mince-meat. The 
liver and sweetbreads may be baked, fried, stewed, and, with the 
addition of a few oysters, make good pies and puddings. All 
bones, gristle, and scraps maybe boiled, with a seasoning of herbs 
ind spices, to a jelly ; then cut into small pieces, dried, and used 
in making soup ; when prepared in this way it is called " Portable 
Soup." In the hands of an economical, good manager, almost 
e^ary part of the animal may be turned to good account. 

As soon as the animal is cleaned and the intestines removed 
(all the fat upon them should be saved), let the tripe receive imme- 
diate attention, and the head and feet be cleaned. As soon as the ani 
inal is quartered, cut out the kidneys ; hang the meat as leng as it 
will keep without salting; wipe it dry. When cut up, put iht 
steak in a bag; suspend it; salt the meat, and cover, to protrcl 
from flies; sprinkle over the top pieces black pepper beater h^a, 
*nd salt. Lay over branches of pine top ; a part may be je.fced, 
pickled or dried. TV best beef has a bright red color ; the fat w\ it*

the ^rain coarse, and yielding readily to the pressure of the fingei 
Reef is hi perfection when atmit four years old. The age of the 
animal may be ascertained by feeling the bone that runs through 
the ribs. If a four year old, the bone will be soft and tender ; it 
grows harder with age. Stall-fed beef is much esteemed ; allow 
the ox (generally an old one) to become poor, then fatten it well 
Says M. Soyer: "The best plan to judge of the flavor is to look 
at the tongue ; if it is plump, and has a clean, bright appearance, 
and the fat at the end is of a pinkish white, then the meat will 
turn out good ; but if the tongue should look dark, and the fat 
dead white, then the meat will eat hard and flavorless. Co"\ er 
the raw side of the hide with ashes, and send it to the tanner. 



279. To Corn Beef for Winter Use. — Prepare the brine the 
6rst of November. Get a thirty gallon cask ; let it be tight and 
3lean; put into it fifteen quarts of salt, fifteen gallons of cold 
water, one pound of pulverized saltpetre, and to every gallon of 
water an ounce of carbonate of soda; stir well and frequently 
antil the salt is dissolved ; remove all scum. Keep the vessel 
well covered with a coarse cloth, and in a cool place. This may 
be made a week or two before it is needed. The animal being 
well fattened, kill it upon a cold day. Hang it two days without 
salt ; on the third cut it up ; salt it, fleshy side down, in a tub that 
will let out the bloody brine. Let it remain (well covered) tea 
days. Unpack it upon a cold day ; wipe each piece, and add tt 
the brine. Put a weight upon the meat to keep it under the 
brine. In a wee* it will be ready for use. Skim the brine occa- 
sionally. If it becomes at all sour, pour it off and boil, adding a 
Sittle aalt and soda, skimming well. Keep the cask in a cool, dry 
place, well covered. Tongues and mutton hams may be put in 
this brine.

it two days; let the bloody brine run o(T; wipe each piece with a 
damp cloth; pack it i:* a cask ; put weights upon it; pour cvei 
the brine. In five or six weeks re-bon; skim well, and when col" 
pour over the meat. It should be entirely covered with brine 
ind -i cloth kept over it. If pork is intended for bacon, hang it to 
BiuoKc for three or tour weeks, the time depending upon the siz«* 

281. Spiced Beef. — Mske a brine with half a pound of salt, 
half an ounce of saltpetre, half a pound of sugar, a tablespoonful 
of cloves, the same of allspice and black pepper; crack the spice 
(do not beat it) ; boil five minutes in a pint of water ; when cold, rub 
it upon ten pounds of beef. Turn it every day for two weeks. 
When ready for use, bake it in a deep dish; pour in the brine; 
to which add two tumblers of water ; cover over the top with suet 
or slices of cold fat bacon. Let die meat become cold in the brine. 



282. To Dry Pickle Beef ur Pork. — Sixteen quarts of salt, 
three ounces of saltpetre, for every hundred pounds of meat. 
After the meat has hung and dripped until all the animal heat is 
gone, cut it into proper pieces; rub each piece well with salt; 
sprinkle salt on the bottom of a water-tight cask ; pack in a layer 
of meat edgewise; take a maul and beat it down well; sprinkle 
over evenly a little saltpetre; fill all the interstices with salt; 
continue this until all the meat is packed in very solidly ; cover 
two or three inches on the top with salt; put a weight on the top 
of the meat ; throw a cloth over, < r put on a good wooden top, 
And keep in a cool, dry place. Meat pickled in this way necdt 
fery little soaking before boiling, and, if the directions are fol 
lowed, will be found to keep well. 

283. To Cure Beef Hams for Winter Use. — After the beef 
has hung long enough for the meat to be tender, cut the hams from 
the hind quarter ; with a sharp knife cut out the bone. Mix on« 
quart of good salt, half a pound of brown sugar, one ounce of 



152 mrb. hill's new cook door. 

* jilt pet re; lay this thickly over the inside of the hams. Thej 
should then be rolled by a strong hand, and firmly wrapped with 
a strong twine string, beginning at the hock ; salt well upon the 
outside; put them upon a dish (they should not lie upon wood) j 
cover with a thin cloth ; turn every day for ten days ; then sua 
fend them in the smoke-house, and smoke slightly. 1< ->r cooking, 
cut the slices thin, and broil. They will be found excellent. If 
the last of the meat becomes dry, use it for chipping. 



284. To Terk Beef. — Slice pieces from the round, or fleshy part^ 
two inches thick. Make a scaffold in the open air, where the 
rays of the sun will tall directly upon the meat. The scaffold 
should not be covered with solid plank, but with narrow strips 
of wood. Dip the pieces of meat in salt and water ; lay them 
upon the scaffold, and smoke. Be careful the fire does not blaze. 
The flies must be brushed away constantly. Turn it frequently; 
or it may be jerked without smoking, merely exposing the meat 
to the sun when the weather is warm and dry. When the out- 
side of the meat hardens, string it, and hang in a cool, dry place. 
Always trim off the hard outside skin before cooking. Besides 
being broiled, it may be boiled or stewed. When hard, lay it in 
tepid water half an hour before broiling. It is not necessary to 
4o this when cooked in either of the other ways. 



285. To Clarify Suet. — Cut as much of the kidney suet as is 
wanted for culinary purposes ; remove all the thin membrane 
that covers it; wash it; put it in a gravy-kettle or well 
tinned stew-pan ; simmer slowly, stirring constantly to prevent 
its burning. When the suet is dissolved, and the cracklings 
float on the top, it is done; strain it into an earthen dish; when 
cool, pack away in jars ; cover from the air ; when used, shave 
rery thin with a sharp knife. Suet may also be kept a few 
weeks by rolling it in flour, and protecting it from dust and air, 
Tht tallow is made by the first receipt, using all the grease u»u* 
the intestines and every part of the animal

28C. To Clarify and Harden Taliotr. — Melt ten pounds of tat 
k ow and two of' beeswax together. Have ready two gallons of 
tx <dng aater ; as soon as the tallow melts pour over it the boi'd 
ing water; let tliis boil two hours; remove the pot from the fire 
In another pot put four pounds of alum ; pour upon it three gal 
tons of water. When the tallow becomes cold take it up ; sciap* 
i-tT 8\.j &e<liment upon the bottom of the cake, and put it in tba 
%\rn uater. Boil eight hours steadily; skim off all impurities; 
replenish, if necessary, with hot water. Let the tallow cool, and 
if not satisfactorily white, add more alum to the water — about 
two pounds — and re-boil it. I have seen candles made in this 
way — the tallow re-boiled twice — equal to the adamantine. 
Make the wicks of soft twisted thread; they burn brighter if 
dipped in turpentine, and dried well. 



287. Confederate Candles. — To two pounds of tallow add a 
teacup of strong lye (from hickory or ash ashes) ; simmer over a 
slow fire, when a greasy scum will float on top ; skim this off aa 
long as it rises ; this grease will make soap. Mould your can- 
dles as usual. 



288. To Make a Clieap Sick Room Taper. — Into a saucer half 
full of lard insert a piece of newspaper made of a sugar-loaf shape 
by cutting a small square and twisting it around the fing?r ; put 
the broad end ia the lard ; let the taper end be an inch above the 
lard. Another way : Put a sycamore ball in a saucer of melted 
lard ; when completely saturated, light it. Another: Tie a piece. 
of soft cloth over a large button, leaving an inch or two (. f the

289. Veal. — The loin is the best piece for roasting ; the fillet is 
stuffed and roasted ; steaks, cutlets, collaps, etc., are taken from 
the fillet or thigh ; chops from the neck, best end ; the shanks 
for soup ; the remaining pieces may be stewed or used for pies, 
ragouts and force-meat balls ; the head is good stewed, potted, 
Daked or boiled ; stuff and bake the heart, or boil and use for 
mince pies. The liver and sweetbreads of the calf are much more 
delicate than when the animal is older. Boil the feet; make jelly 
of the liquor ; fry, fricassee or stew the meat. Make tripe of the 
stomach; bake or stew the tongue. Veal of itself is an insipid 
meat, but, well seasoned, is not only very delicate and agreeable 
to the palate, but pleasant to the eye. The calf should be fat- 
tened upon the mother's milk, and killed when ten weeks or three 
months old, and when in perfect condition for the table, the grain 
will be close and firm, ths flesh a delicate red, and the tat white ; 
the kidneys should be covered with white, thick fat; the liver 
firm, and free from spots. Always hang the meat, and wipe it 
dry every day with a coarse cloth. It taints easily if permitted 
to rest upon wood and never turned or wiped. 



290. To Prepare Rennet. — A rennet is the Stomach of a calf, 
prepared in this way: Empty the stomach as soon as the animal 
is killed ; wipe it dry upon the inside; sprinkle salt over it; iel 
it lie five days; then shake off the salt; stretch it, and dry it 
A piece three inches square will turn a quart of sweet milk 



MEATS. 155 

Wash the rennet; soak in a teacup of tepid water an hour; pour 
the water to the milk; stir well; set in a warm place until the 
curds form. Make custards in this way : One quart of new milk. 
half a pint of cream ; prepare the rennet as directed ; a<Id to 
the milk and cream mixed, stirring well ; flavor with wii e* 
sweeten to taste; grate in a nutmeg. Pour in custard 3iipa ; stf 
tear the fire until the curd is firm ; then set on ice or m a ood 
place. t The rennet should be very slightly washed. 




1. Leg ; 2. Shoulder ; 3. Loin, best end ; 4. Chnmp end ; 5. Neck, beat end ; 4 
Breast ; 7. Scrag end. 

291. Mutton. — A saddle of mutton is two loins. The leg and 
loin are considered the best pieces. The leg may be boiled, 
baked or roasted ; the loin is usually baked or roasted. The 
shoulder may be baked or roasted, or separate the blade- bone 
from the ribs and grill, or broil the blade-bone; broil, fry or 
stew the ribs. The neck affords several savory dishes ; cut 
chops from the best end ; spice and bake as mock venison ; use for 
logouts, stews, etc. Use the shanks and scrags for soup. Mutton 
hams are fine pickled a few days, then slightly smoked and used 
for broiling. Mutton is in the greatest perfection at four years 
old. Ths grain should be firm, but tender to the touch, of a 
d irk, clear red, the fat firm and white. Mutton suet is useful for 
aiauy purposes. Save all the surplus fat ; stew it; strain fron. 
the cracklings ; pour it into bf.wls to cool, and pack it. away closely. 



292. Lamb. — A lamb is usually divided into four quarters, 
which may be boiled, baked or roasted. The fore-qua ter is 



150 MRS. HILL 8 NEW COOK BOOK. 

sometimes divided, using the ribs for chops, and grill the shoulder 
blade; the pluck consists of the heart, liver and lights; the lrj 
is composed of the bowels, sw^t.breads and kernels ; the head ii 
good stewed or boiled ; the broth of it makes good s<»up. Some 
\ery thrifty, economical housewives use the feet of the sheep, 
jailed "trotters" — the liquor in which they are boiled makes s 
beautiful amber-colored jelly. Lambs should be killed aheft 
four or five months old, and weigh from twenty » thirty pouaii 
Save the suet. 



293. Venison. — The shoulder should be roasted, or used for 
Btews, puddings and pies ; the neck for steak or stews ; the 
haunch roasted or baked ; the scrag and shins for soup. Buck 
venison is best. If young, the cleft in the hoof will be small and 
smooth; if old, large and rough. "The Hit should be white, the 
lean very ruddy." The hams are good dried and chipped. 




1. Ham; S. Side or Middling ; 3. Shoulder; 4. Chine or Backbone; 5. Head ani 
Jowl. 

204. Pork. — The hams and shoulders are salted and smoked ; 
the sides pickled or smoked. The chine is the part of the back- 
bone that lies next the head. It is usual to cut out the back- 
bone whole, and then separate them before cooking. The chint 
h baked, boiled or stewed ; the smaller bones stewed or boiled. 
It is best to take the ribs from the sides, and b^oil, bake, or roast 
them; the feet are good soused; the small intestines used foi 
chitterlings ; the liver fried or broiled ; the harslet stewed ; th« 
head and ears made into cheese or scrafrle; the jowl salted and 
tmokfd ; the ungues sa'ted and boiled, as beef tongues. Broii 



MEATS. 15"? 

01 fry the kidneys, first passing a wire through to prevent their 
curling; the brains ma) be fried with eggs, or pickled to imitate 
oysters. The fat must be taken from the intestines, and thai 
which is in a sound, healthy condition, must be put to soak to con 
Fertit into lard. The poorer part" w»e for soap, or stew and keep 
f;r greasing wagons and other plantation purposes. 



21*5. To Try the Fat. — The lard for cooking is made from the 
leaf fat, the fat from the chine, head and trimmings of the joints, 
etc.. Wash it well, and soak twelve hours ; if put to soak in the 
evening let it remain until next morning; wash it in tepid water, 
cnanging it twice; cut it in small pieces; pour a little water in 
the bottom of the kettle to prevent the fat from scorching (very 
little water is necessary) ; cut in small pieces; boil briskly until 
the oil from the meat is nearly extracted, and the process almost 
completed ; then reduce the fire; stir frequently, turning the meat 
up from the bottom ; when done, the cracklings will be a good 
brown, and float to the top and break crisp. Great care must be 
taken after the oil begins to look clear, to prevent its burning 
(the least taste of that kind will injure its quality) ; at the same 
time the cracklings must be thoroughly done, the water entirely 
evaporated, or the lard will turn sour. Strain first through a 
colander, pressing the oil out ; then place a muslin or other thin 
cloth over the mouth of the jar, and strain again. To prevent 
the jars breaking in very cold weather from the freezing of the 
lard, put a stick as large as a man's wrist through the centre of 
th* lard just as it begins to harden. When cold, withdraw the 
sticks; use seasoned wood — pine will not aLswer. Stoneware 
answers better on some accounts for keeping lard than tin. 
When jars are emptied, have them scalded and sunned imme- 
diately; repeat this just before using them again. A little lye 
will aid the cleansing. The lard from the intestines must be wv,lj 
soaked, washed and kept separate, and boiled by itself. By nice, 
caieful management It may be made to answer for frying meats.

158 MRS. IIILl/s NEW COOK BOOK. 

be made of the liquor the feet wvre boiled in, there must not c* 
any salt about them. The trimmings of the backbones, joints and 
tenderloins are used for sausages. There should be a pound of 
fat to two of lean. Never use leaf fat ; in sausages it runs to 
gra vy when cooked, leaving the m^at (*~:y and lean. 



296. To Cure Bacon. — The first requisite in making good 
bacon is, that the hogs be in good condition ; then, that they 
should be killed when the wind sets decidedly in the north; take 
advantage of the beginning of the cold weather; never kill upon 
the wane or decrease of the cold. After the animal is slaughtered, 
it should immediately be put in a vessel containing sufficient hot 
water to scald it well; turn once; scald the feet. It is possible 
to have the water too hot ; extremes must be avoided. A scaf- 
fold, or platform made of plank, poles or rails, should be in 
readiness to receive the animal as soon as it is withdrawn from 
the water; then the scraping must be begun, taking care not to 
ttit the skin ; pour over, from time to time, hot water ; a great 
ieal of scraping and washing is necessary to clean the skin as it 
should be. Always scrape and clean the feet, head and ears, at 
the same time the hog is cleaned. When in proper condition, 
hang it; remove the intestines; wash every part well, using 
several waters ; repeat this until the inside is entirely clean; wipe 
with coarse, clean cloths. Let the hogs hang in the open air until 
all are slaughtered and cleaned. The intestines should be re- 
ceived in tubs, put in charge of careful hands. The fat must be 
first saved, and put to soak ; the intestines intenied for sausage 
ca»es and chitterlings should be emptied and cleansed; the 
taxation emptied, washed, and stewed for soap-grease; the maws 
arc u%ed for chitterlings; spread a little lime upon the inside c* 
those intended for chitterlings ; after lying a few hours, scrape and 
«oak t!>3m. A little lime rubbed upon the inside of the articles 
us 3d for chitterlings and tripe cleanses them much sooner, ana 
gives a much better flavor than mere scraping and soaking. 



MEATS ] f)9 

297. To Cut vp the Hoc,. — 1 1, move the head; split the jowi 
and upper part asunder ; take out the brains and tongue ; cut out 
the backbone. Divide the remainder of the hog into six parts— 
the shoulders, middlings and hams. Round the hams; use tht 
frimmings of the joints and the tenderloins for sausages. Jn iie 
under side of the hams the bone slightly projects ; saw this even, 
with the meat; it is of no advantage to the ham, and a good 
hiding-place for skippers. Remove the spareribs from the 
middlings. Spread the meat until all animal heat ii» ott, first 
sprinkling it over with salt. 



298. To Salt Pork. — Have suitable tables or platforms rcady ; 
begin the salting by giving the shank end of each joint a smart rap 
upon the table, so as to loosen the joint ; work the hock back- 
wards and forwards to ascertain if this is done. The advantages 
>f th'S is, the salt penetrates sooner. Rub the salt in well; pack 
i boxes or pits dug in the dirt floor of the smoke-house five or 
x feet deep; line the pits with plank; the plank should be at 
least a foot above the surface of the ground; cover the bottom 
with salt; pack the joints as soon as they are properly prepared, 
skin side down. When saltpetre is used, apply it by taking a 
pinch between the finger and thumb, and sprinkling evenly over 
the joints after they are salted, and before packing. Between 
each row of meat pack in salt, and when the last is in, cover well 
with salt, and then with fresh pine tops. If hogsheads are used 
foi packing the meat, bury them in the ground to about a foot 
of .he top. In four weeks the meat will be ready for hanging 
It should be taken up on a cold, windy day. Shake off the salt | 
wash the hams as expeditiously as possible ; hang the meat, hock 
dewn; smoke several hours each day until cured. The best 
plan for smoking is to have a furnace upon the outside, and 
attached to the smoke-house, a flue conducting the e^oke inside. 
The smoking is an important matter; meat is often spoiled from 
being over-heated when the fire is made inside. When the fire is 
made inside, dig a pit two feet deep; make the fire In the befc 



4 60 MRS. HILL'S NEW COOK BOOK 

lorn ; clean it out each clay. Joints should never re hung imm^ 
diately over the pit, as the fire often blazes; and the smoke a 
warmer as it first rises from the pit. A little red pepper thrown 
upon the fire, or a few dry China berries, will drive off the flies. 
When sufficiently smoked, put the hams into bags made jf thick 
Dsnaburgs; tie them securely; whitewash the outside with a 
paste made of lime; hang immediately, hock side d:>wn. Tka 
remainder of the meat may be hung or packed away in ashes ; 
if permitted to hang, there is some loss from dripping. If there 
is reason to fear the joints are tainted, run a sharp knife into the 
meat at the hock-bone; if an unpleasant odor is perceived, the 
meat is not doing well. A friend who is remarkably successful 
in curing bacon, tender, juicy, and of fine flavor, furnishes me 
the following receipt for curing hams : " Cut and round the hams 
6moothly ; salt, and rub well ; pack down ; and the first favora- 
ble weather, after eight or ten days, take the joints up and re-salt 
them ; in three or four weeks hang them and smoke gently. To 
protect them from insects, as soon as they are sufficiently smoked, 
put them imo sacks, and lime the sacks." After the meat is 
taken up to smoke, it is a good plan to sprinkle the inside of 
each ham immediately after being washed with pulverized black 
pepper, to protect them from flies. The skipper-fly usually makes 
its appearance the last of February or early in March, according 
as the weather is more or less cold. It is very desirable to smoke 
and pack the meat away before that time. Sugar is sometime! 
used in curing meat — a pound to two pounds of salt, or a pint Ot 
•yrup to two pounds of salt. 



•J9i>. To Cure Hams. — Spread upon each ham the following 
in.xture, and let them remain until the next day : One small 
apoonful saltpetre, one large spoonful of sugar, one large spconful 
of molasses, a teaspoonful of red pepper, rubbed well together* 
then salt down and pack away as you do other meat. This is * 
good plan in localities where there is very little cold weather. 



MEATS. HU 

800. To Preserve Hathsby Packing in Ashe*.— Mike a scaffold 
around the inside of the smoke-house ; put as many tiers as may 
be needed, making them of very narrow strips of plank, so that 
when the hams are placed upon them, they will be support**) 
only at the ends and in the middle, with space between (w , '> »••■ 
/> allow a free circulation of air. Covor each ham well with dry 
leached ashes; place upon the thin strips of plank, skin-Bid* 
down. When hogs are killed late in the season, before the 
meat is sufficiently smoked, and the skipper-fly begins to make 
its appearance, take the joints down; ash them well ; hang again, 
and complete the smoking ; then lay away, well ashed, upon the 
tiers. There is no better plan for those who like meat preserved 
in ashes. 



301. To Pot Meat. — This is an economical way of using 
up scraps of cold meat, fowls, or fish. Cut up all the meat, 
separating it carefully from the bones ; scrape off any gravy or 
hard skin that may remain after being cut or picked up. Gravy 
or stuffing would make the meat sour if kept over two or three 
days. Different meats may be potted together. First grind the 
meat by running it through a sausage mill. Pick out all the 
gristle; then pound it in a marble or wooden mortar, moistening 
it from time to time with clarified butter, adding any spice or 
herbs required for seasoning. It should be well beaten. Dr. 
Kitchiner, who recommends meats prepared in this way for in- 
valids and persons of weak digestive powers, says: "There is no 
grease so good to use in the pounding as ' elbow grease.' " 
When reduced to a smooth paste, pack in small jars; cover an 
rich with clarified butter ; tie a bladder or oilcloth ov€t; kexp iu 
a dry, cool place. 

302. To Clarify Butter for Potting. — Simmer jhe butle? 
gently in an open vessel; when the water has evaporated (which 
may be krown by the bubbling ceasing) take it off the fire, and 
U?\ it remain undisturbed half an hour; the curj will settle af 



] 5*2 MR8. HILl S NEW COOK BOOK. 

the bottom. Bottle and ecrk tightly, and keep in a cool place 
Butter prepared in this way will keep well, and is valuable foi 
enriching stews, hashes, etc. Will make good cake ard pastry. 
Potted meats should always be put cold in the jars, and packed 
frmly. 

303. Tc Pot Calf s Head.— After the head is well cleared, 
UV tag off *,hc skin, nose, and ears ; put it to boil with two of the 
fen which have been well cleaned. Boil until tender; remove the 
pifces from the liquor; when cold, scrape off all grease that may 
rulhere; take out all bones; put the meat back into the pot with 
the herbs intended for seasoning, and enough of the liquor to 
cover the meat, after skimming off the grease that floats on the 
top; boil half an hour. Take up the meat in a clean colander; 
let the liquor drain until the meat is dry and culd. Run through 
the sausage mill ; then pound in a marble or wooden mortar, add 
iing the spices and a little clarified butter from time to time. 
When a smooth paste is formed, pack in a mould ; cover so as to 
exclude the air ; mix the spices ; half a teaspoonful of cloves, a 
whole teaspoonful of mace, cinnamon and allspice, one and a half 
of pepper to one pound of meat, salt to taste. Serve with 
pickle. If the meat does not turn out well, wrap a hot towel 
around the sides of the mould, or set a minute or two before the 
fire, turning it. Potted meats are excellent for sandwiches. 
Use the broth for soup. 

304. To Pot Ham and Tongue. — Beat together well a pound 
each of cold lean ham and tongue ; season with spices, if liked. 
When a smooth paste, pack in jars, by the foregoing receipts. 
Fowls, fish, with a little lean ham or tongue added, may all U 
potted. Suit the taste in making the combinations as well as it* 
leleoting the seasonings. Two ounces of clarified butter will be 
the proper quantity for one pound of meat, unless the meat is 
very rich ; then less butter should be used. It is convenient to 
iave these made dishes on hand, as, in case of having company

unexpectedly, additions may easily be made to lunch, dinner, or 
supper. 



305 Veal Salad. — Boil a. hock of veal for soup, when thoi* 
ouglilv done, take up the hock ; pick the meat from the bonea^ 
*nd season as for chicken salad. A nice supper dish. 

Oysters minced fine and dressed as a salad are good. 



305 J. Chuken Sandwich. — Boil done, and skin; pull off th* 
meat, keep white and dark separate. Chop and season. Put in 
a mould ; alternately white and daik meat. When cold, slice. 



300. To Collar Meat. — This is done by picking the meat into 
•mall strips; while hot, spread layers upon the bottom of a pan ; 
sprinkle over mixed spices; fill the vessel with alternate lay en 
of meat and spices ; put on weights sufficient to press the meat 
into a solid cake. When cold, to be eaten with pickle, lemon- 
ehow, etc. 



307. To Collar Flanks of Beef.SaU the two flanks ; sprinkle 
over a little saltpetre : turn them every day for eight or ten days 
(if the woather is cold enough). At the end of this time wash the 
meat well ; boil it until tender. Have ready half a teaspoonful 
of pounded and sifted cloves, the same of allspice, one teaspoon- 
ful each of cinnamon and mace. When the meat is tender, take 
it up and pick it to pieces as expeditiously as possible, removing 
the skin and gristle. Put a layer of the meat (mixing the fat and 
lean judiciously) on the bottom of a pan ; sprinkle over pepper 
and the mixed spices evenly. When the meat and seasoning la 
all in, put a sheet of tin or a piece of board that will not give it 
a disagreeable taste. Place weights upon the board, and let it 
remain until the meat is perfectly cold. Serve wilil pickle. 
Another way is to boil the flanks; spread them out; trim ofT the 
fat wheu there is too much; remove all skin and gristle ; spread

over the spices and pepper, and, beginning at one end, roll 
tightly ; wrap with tape; put under weights ; when cold trim the 
edges ; garnish with sliced lemon. 

308. To Collar a Leg of Pork. — Take out the^bone ; stuff with 
mixture composed of two teaspoonfuls of powdered sage, one 
teaspooniul of pounded mace, one nutmeg grated fine, a dozen 
cloves, the same of allspice, a teaspooniul of cinnamon, salt to 
taste, a tablespoonful of pepper, half a pound of butter, one tum- 
bler of fine bread crumbs ; mix well ; spread evenly on the inside 
of the pork. Wrap it to look as nearly as possible as it did 
before the bone was removed. Tie it tightly with tape; put it in 
ft pan with a little water, Bake two hours. Press it by placing 
weights upon it* To be aatei: cold. 



SAUCES, STUFFINGS, AND GRAVIES. 

14 Tmc most homely fare may be made relishing, and the mot 
#«cellcnt and independent improved by a well-made sauce." 

Upon many tables the only gravy which makes its appearance 
? ji the grease or drippings from the meat, thickened with a paste of 
water and flour, or the pure unadulterated grease minus the thick- 
ening. I earnestly advise all housewives to make themselves 
familiar with the art of preparing different kinds of sauces. 1 
have seei the character of poor steak, joints, and puddings in part 
redeemed by a well selected, well prepared sauce. 



309. White Sauces for Boiled Meats or Poultry — Egg Sauce. — 
Rub together smoothly a large tablespoonful heaped with good 
butter, two teaspoonfuls of flour. Pour into the stew-pan a turn 
bier of fresh sweet milk ; set this upon the stove or upon a trivet, 
rith a shovelful of fire under. Drop in the butter as soon aa 
4he milk boils up; shake the stew-pan. As soon as the butter 
jne.ts, pour in a tumbler of sweet cream ; only keep upon the 
fire long enough to scald the cream. Have ready the yolks of 
four or five hard-boiled eggs cut up ; the whites of two ; stir into 
the sauce just before pouring into the tureen ; salt if needed. 
This preparation may be poured over boiled meats or poultry, 
sending a part of it to the table in a boat or tureen. Double the 
receipt if necessary. 

310. Celery Sauce. — Boil the white parts of six stalks of celery 
(first cutting them in small pieces) in two tumblerfuls of the broth 
the meat was boiled in, or any pale broth (veal is best), or boil- 
ing water alone will answer. Add salt to taste; cover the stew- 
pan and let it sinmer gently until tender. Rub a heaped 
teaspoouful of flour into a piece of butter the size of a hen's egg ; 
itraiu the water from the celery upon this. Remove the celery 



166 

from the stew-pan, wipe it out, re! urn the broth, add a tumbler 
of sweet cream or rich fresh milk; let this simmer geitly five 
minutes, and serve. When fresh celery cannot be ol tainod, u*i 
the extract or the seeds bruised ; tie them in a thin muslin cloth 
that they may be easily removed. 



311. Lemon Sauce. — Make the sauce in the same wsy *s the 
selery, boiling the peel of the lemon until sufficient flavor is im- 
parted ; add enough of the juice to make a pleasant acid, just before 
serving. Cauliflower may be used instead of the lemon, for 
variety. 



312. Oyster Sauce. — A tumblerful of oysters j strain thn 
n^uor, pick out all the shells. Put the liquor in a stew-p^n with 
one yjr two blades of mace ; salt to taste. To a piece of bu f ter as 
larg* *ts a hen's egg, rub a teaspoonful of flour ; add this to the 
liquor with a tumblerful of sweet cream or milk. When this 1 is 
just re*vty to boil, put in the oysters, first mincing them. Sim- 
mer gem-.y until the oysters are well scalded, and pour into a 
gravy tureen. When made of canned oysters, stew entirely ir 
milk or a pa.e broth. 

313. Caper Sauce. — Melt a quarter of a pound of butter, into 
which two teast»oonfuls of flour has been rubbed ; add two turn 
blcrs of sweet mi\k, or half water (all milk is best). Add six or 
eight tablespooufuk of capers. 

Mock caper sauce is made by adding pickles cut up ; radish 
pods or nasturtions av« good as substitutesjbr capers. 



314 Caper Sauce, No 2. — Make two tumblerfuls of thin pap 
boil it until it looks transparent; add to this a tumblerful of but 
^er, six tablespoonfuls of capers strained from their lie lor. IV.ii 
part over the meat ; serve the remainder in a sauce tureen. 

Egg sauce is made in this way, adding them bo..ed hard and 
out up fine. 



BArCES, STUFFINGS, AND GRAVIES. 1(»J 

815. Onion Sauce. — Slice two medh m-sized white onions; lay 
them in water ten minutes. Boil them soft in clear water ; pour 
ofT this water, and add as much sweet milk as is needed for the 
tauce. Rub to a tablespoonful of butter a teaspoonful of Hour ; 
vlJ this to the < nion and milk. Shake the stew-pan well w hilt 
t is simmering, which should be from five to six minutes. Sa't 
-ii taste. Strain and serve hot in a gravy-boat or tureen. 



316. Mushroom Sauce. — W;ish and pick a pint of mushrooms; 
rub them with salt, and immediately throw into cold water. 
When all are cleansed, put them to boil in a covered stew-pan, 
with sweet milk or pale broth ; salt to taste. When the mush- 
rooms are tender, strain the liquor from them ; wipe out tho 
stew-pan and pour back the liquor. Add butter, with a little 
flour rubbed into the butter. Stew until thick enough. 



317. Parsley Sauce. — Boil three sprigs of parsley in a tum- 
blerful of water ten minutes. Pick off the leaves, chop them 
fine, and salt to taste. Wipe out the stew-pan, return the water 
and add to it an equal quantity of sweet milk. Make a paste of 
a teaspoonful of flour and a little cold sweet milk ; when the mill 
boils, stir in the paste. Add a tumblerful of good fresh buttei, 
then stir in gradually the minced parsley. 



318. Sauce for Fish. — Scrape fine the yolks of two hard* 
boiled eggs; pepper, salt, mustard, three tablespoonfuls of sali.d 
oil, three of vinegar, one of tomato catsup. 



SIP Wine Sauce for Venison or Game. — Put a tumbler of hoi 
fMtcr or pale broth into a stew-pan; stir to it two tablespoon full 
of fine bread crumbs, one teacup of butter, the grated rind of a 
lemon, and a blade of mace; let these simmer five or six minutes. 
Slir into a teacup of Por* wine a dessert-spoonful of loaf sugar; 
pc»or this into the stew-pan, shake it round, and as soon as the 



168 MRS. niLLS NEW COOK BOOK. 

wine is hot, pour it into a tureen. Serve hot. A litt.c acid jehj 
put in the bottom of the tureen before pouring in the s^uce, ntd 
thou stirred , ; ato it well, is an improvement. 



320. A hrench Fish Sauce. — Beat the yolks of two raw eggs; 
**son them with salt, pepper, and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar 
icald it ; stir well ; add the grated peel of a lemon. Add slowly 
two tablespoonfuls of fresh olive oil, stirring constantly until well 
mixed. Add the juice of the lemon, or vinegar, to make a 
piquant sauce. Color green with spinach juice. 



32 . Sauce for foiled Fowls. — Beat the yolk of an egg ; add 
to it a tumbler of melted butter, one wineglass of , sweet cream; 
stew five minutes. Season any way liked. This makes a nice 
sauce for pork chops, if seasoned with sage. 



322. Bread Sauce.- —A tumbler of bread crumbs; pour over 
them two tumblers of boiling milk or pale veal broth. Let this 
stand until the bread has absorbed the gravy ; stew five minutes. 
Make it sufficiently rich with butter; season in any way liked; 
salt to taste. 



323. Dr. Kitckiner's Receipt for White Sauce. — Cut in small 
pieces two pounds of lean veal and half a pound of ham. Melt 
two ounces of butter ; let all simmer until the meat almost sticks. 
(Great attention must be paid to prever ,t its sticking ; should it 
occur it will spoil the stock.) Make i paste, using three table 
spoonfuls of flour ani sufficient water; stir this into the stew-pan, 
and &dd three pints Df hot water or hot broth. Stir all well to- 
gether, and continue to stir frequently. Cover the stew-pan, and 
set it upon a corner of the stove where it will boil gently two 
hours. Season with an onion cut up fine, twelve grains of all- 
spice, the same of cloves, two blades of mace, bla jk pepper, a 
little red pepper, a few sprigs of parsley, and thyme When th«j 
or*»th is reduced to a quart, skim off the fat; strain the broth 



SAUCES, STUFFINGS, AM) GRAVIES. IdO 

•nd keep it in a cool place. When ready for use. add a pint of 
sweet cream, and simmer until thick enough. Pour part over 
the meat; send the remainder to table in a tureen. 



324. To Make Sauce to Pour over Boiled Fowls or Meat. — On* 
} tut of fresh sweet milk ; stir to it slowly a pint of boiling water; 
rub to two heaped teaspoonfuls of butter two even teaspoonfuli 
of flour; put this to the milk. Stew it until of the consistence 
of cream, shaking the stew-pan frequently. Season with salt and 
the juice of a lemon. If a whiter sauce is preferred, use more 
milk. If it is preferred to have it colored, beat up the yolks of 
two eggs ; pour the sauce to them slowly, beating and stirring 
rapidly. Put the stew-pan on the stove long enough to take ofF 
the raw taste of the egg ; one or two minutes will suffice. Pour 
a part of the sauce over the meat as a veil ; season the rest in 
any way liked, and send in a tureen. 



325. Brown Sauces — Tomato Sauce. — Skin a tumblerful of 
tomatoes ; chop them fine ; cut up a small silver-skinned onion ; 
season with salt, pepper, and a dessert-spoonful of sugar. Put 
»hese into a stew-pan with a tablespoonful of butter ; add two 
tablespoonfuls of grated bread crumbs, a wineglass of water ; stew 
gently an hour, keeping the stew-pan covered ; shake it frequently. 
Just before serving, stir in two eggs beaten several minutes. 



326. Lobster Sauce. — Boil the lobster very well done ; mines 
the meat; take out the coral and eggs, and pound them in & mor 
tar (the coral gives a fine red color to the sauce). Rub to the 
ocral a piece of butter the size of an egg. Put a pint of the broth 
in which the lobster was boiled in a stew-pan; thicken it with a 
paste made of water and a teaspoonful of flour. Let this simmer 
two or three minutes ; add as much meat of the lobster minced 
as is required ; let all heat well, and add the butter just before 
serving. The fine red coloi of the coral will be lost if it boils, 
Use hen lobsters for sauce.

I/O MR8. HILL'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

327. Sauce for Lobster. — Mash fine the yolks of two hard 
brnlod ejjgs, a tablespoon Ail of water and the coral of the lobster 
a teaspoonfui of made mustard, two tablespoonfuls of salad oil, 
atd five of vinegar. Pepper and salt to taste. 



328 Sauce of Ancl.ovies, Shrimps, or Clams. — Rub into a turn 
aler of butter a teaspoonful of flour ; pepper and salt to taste. 
Put a tumbler of water in the stew-pan ; add the butter and sea 
soiling; simmer five minutes. Add the meat of anchovies, 
shrimps, or clams. 



329. Mint Sauce. — Three tablespoonfuls of fresh mint chopped 
fine, five tablespoonfuls of vinegar, two teaspoonfuls of sugar dis- 
solved in the vinegar. Serve with roast lamb or chops. 



330. Apple Sauce. — Stew or bake acid apples; when done, 
mash and strain them. To a pint add a small piece of butter; 
sweeten to taste ; grate over it a little nutmeg ; serve with pig, 
goose, or ducks. Dried apples and peaches stewed, and sweet, 
ened and seasoned with lemon or orange peel, or nutmeg, makes 
a good accompaniment to fresh meats. Stewed cranberries make 
a superior sauce for meats or poultry. 



331. Horseradish Sauce. — One teacup of grated horseradish 
one wineglass of good cider vinegar, into whicn has been dissolved 
a dessert-spoonful of loaf sugar, the same of mustard, a teaspoon- 
fill of salt; stir this to the horseradish. Serve with hot or cold 
meats. 



332. Mustard Sauce. — Stir to a teacup of vinegar a teaspooa 
ful of mustard, one of salt, two of loaf sugar pulverized, one 
tablespoonful of butter; put all into a stew-pan, and let it simmer 
until boiling hot. Beat in a bowl the yolks of two eggs; stir the 
vinegar to them, stirring sbwiy and constantly. Return th* 
mixture tc the tire, and when boiling hot, pour into a tureen a 



SAUCES, SVUFFIVOS, AND GRAVIES. 171 

lene. This is a good sauce for broiled meats, hashes, rag-outs, 
or game. If fresh olive oil is bsed instead of butter, thi* make* 
%i excellent sauce for salad, or coia slaw. 



333. Pickle Sauce. — Into a t'imblcrful of melted butter stir • 
Urge tablespoonf'l of chopped mustard pickle, with a tablespocr 
fill of the vinegar; stir three miiutes, or until thoroughly hjt. 



334. Curry Sauce. — Add to a pint of broth or melted butter 
an even tablespoonful of curr^ powder; wet into a paste with 
cold water ; or boil in the broth an apple or an onion cut up ; 
when soft enough to mash fine, strain ; wipe out the stew-pan ; 
return to the stew-pan, and add the curry powder; simmer two 
minutes. Parboil the onion before adding it to the broth ; this 
is more delicate than to add it raw. 



335. Sauce for Barbecues. — Melt half a pound of butter; stir 
into it a large tablespoonful of mustard, half a teaspoonful of red 
pepper, one of black, salt to taste; add vinegar until the sauce 
has a strong acid taste. The quantity of vinegar will depend 
upon the stroigth of it. As soon as the meat becomes hot, begin 
to baste, and continue basting frequently until it is done; pour 
over the meat any sauce that remains. 



33G. Sauce for Steaks, Chop.*, and Fried Chicken. — After tin? 
Bteak is sufficiently fried, take it up on a hot dish; set it covered 
where it will keep warm ; strain the grease in which it was fried ; 
return only a tablespoonful to the pan; if liked, a little onion 
may be cut up, and added; fry a golden color, stirring frequently. 
For a pound of meat, use a large tal lespoonful of butter; put this 
Into the frying-pan ; sprinkle in a heaped teaspoonful of flour, stir- 
ring it to a smooth paste; pour in a tumblerful of hot <vaterj 
stir it well ; shake the pan and let it simmer until of the con- 
sistence of cream 



172 

337. Brown Sauce. — Cut up a tumblerful of led onions; fry 
it in a large tablespoonful of butter; sprinkle to the butter an 
even tablespoonful of flour (browned), making a smooth paste. 
Be careful the butter does not burn ; that would ruin the flavor 
of the sauce; pour in a pint of boiling water or broth. Let this 
timmor until it thickens slightly. When water is used, mor 
butter 13 required than for broth; season with salt and pepper 
Put in the tureen a large tablespoonful of French mustard ; no 
Other mustard will answer the purpose so w r ell ; pour upon thia 
the sauce, mixing well. Onions, when used in sauces or gravies, 
are more delicate to be parboiled one or two minutes; this is 
necessary when using the red onion. The white has a more deli 
f-ate flavor. 



338. Brown Onion Sauce — Fry the onion. Into another 
frying-pan put a few slices of ham or any kind of meat, adding to 
jt a teaspoonful of lard. Let it fry until brown, turning fre- 
quently to prevent its scorching ; when a dark color, pour over 
the meat a tumbler of hot water ; stir it until it is well mixed 
with the meat ; add this to the onion ; stew two or three minutes ; 
strain, and mix with it an even tablespoonful of French mustard, 
<&* a wineglass of catsup or Port wine. 

The trimmings of any kind of fresh meat, or any good bones 
cracked, may be boiled, and the broth used for gravy, sauces, or 
soup ; also essence of ham, the top of the pot skimmed and 
drained, and remains of gravy should be carefully saved in ov 
•»rsd earthen vessels, kept in a cool place, and used to aid gravies, 
or for the soup-kettle. " Wilful waste makes woeful want." 



339 Browning for Sauces. — The flour used for tniCKering 
»hov1d be spread upon the bottom of a tin pan, placed upon tho 
•tove ; stir constantly until of a good brown color. Keep ft in a 
tin dredging-box ready for, use. Sugar may also be used. Dr. 
K itchiness receipt for preparing this is : "Take half a pound of 
pulverized loaf sugar; add to it a wii eglass of cold water; put 



SAUCES, STUFFINGS, AND CRAVIA^. 173 

this into a staw-pan ; simmer slow Iy> stirring constantly with a 
vooden or silver spoon until o^a light brown color, and it begins 
to smoke, add to it an ounce of salt, and dilute it with wat<?r until 
it is of the consistence of cream. _et it boil ; take off the acurn^ 
id bottle it. To make a small quantity for immediate use, put 
teaspoonful of pulverized loaf sugar in a large iron spoon, with 
f.s i iuch water as will dissolve it; hold it over a hot fire until it 
is a dark brown color. Use for browning soups and sauces. Mil 
it well with a tumblerful of broth before adding to the soups or 
sauces. 



340. Plain Gravy for Boast Meat. — Take up a tumblerful of 
the gravy ; set it aside ; when cool, remove the cake of grease. 
Put the gravy in a stew-pan; set it on the fire; dissolve half a 
tablespoonful of browned sugar in half a tumbler of the gravy. 
It should be hot ; if there is not sufficient extra gravy for this, use 
hot water ; pour this to the gravy in the stew-pan ; let it simmer 
five minutes. If a richer gravy is preferred, add as much as is 
liked of the solid grease which was removed ; unless the plates 
are hot this will congeal, and look like tallow. The unseasoned 
taste of roast or baked meat gravies are generally preferred. 
Catsups or mustards may be added upon the plate. 



341. Gravy, No. 2. — Put into a stew-pan an even tablespoon 
fill of hard butter ; when it melts, stir to it slowly two teaspoon- 
fuls of flour; when well mixed, add a little of the gravy slowly, 
stirring well ; then more gravy, until a tumblerful is stirred in ; 
simmer five minutes ; skim off the fat as it rises. It will prob- 
ably be too rich. 

342. To Make Gravy for Ham. — When the ham is sufficiently 
cooked, remove it immediately from the frying-pan. To a tumbler 
of gravy sprinkle in slowly, mixing smoothly with the gravy, s 
teaspoonful of flour; pour in half a tumbler of boiling water; 
shake the pan well j let it simmer a minute ; pour in a gravj boat. 



1/4 MRS HILL6 NEW COOK BOOK. 

343 Beef Steak Qravy — Is made in the same way when \m 
Bleak is well rolled in flour ; less flour is required in making tin 
gravy. When onions are used, fust slice, and pour boiling water 
over i/liem ; let them stand five minutes; drain the water ft om 
them; fry a light brown color in the gravy, before adding the 
thickening; withdraw them before dredging in the flour. 

344. Qravy that will Keep Several Days. — Lay in a steM' pan 
or suitable vessel half a pound of lean, juicy, fresh meat of the 
poorest pieces or trimmings ; over this put half a pound of 
pickled pork, or a little less bacon of the side meat. Cut up two 
medium-size onions and a few sprigs of parsley. Pour into the 
vessel a tumblerful of boiling water (not more than this); cover 
the vessel, and let the meat stew, turning it once, until it is a 
rich brown color; then pour in boiling water enough to just 
cover it ; let it simmer an hour ; remove the meat ; thicken the 
gravy slightly with a paste made of brown flour and water; let 
this simmer half an hour; add any essence of ham or good gravy 
that may be saved for such purposes. Put in an earthen vessel 
well covered, and exclude from the air. Warm it before serving ; 
season with any catsup liked. For making all brown gra v ies, fry 
the meat first, and pour over hot b-*oth, gravy or water; use the 
browned sugar or flour for coloring and thickening. Kidney?, 
livers, necks of poultry, the scraggv parts of the necks of animals, 
may be used for making the stock for gravy. 



345. Gravy for Baked Fowls. — Put the neck ana giblets to 
■tew; add salt to taste. In half an hour take out the neck and 
gillets; thicken with a paste made of flour and water while the 
bi >th is boiling ; add a tumbler of the gravy to the same quantity 
of the broth; let it simmer until tLck as rich cream; cut up th 
giblets; add to the gravy. Should there be too much grease 
skim it off*. Gravies are often served with an amount of grease 
floating upon the top that renders taem repulsive rather than in 
viting. Seasoning of *ny kind of vegetable or catsup may 0*

Used — not, however, in sufficient quantities to overpower the natu 
ral flavor of the gravy. 



346 Gravy for Baked Pig. — Boil the harslet until tender 
mince the liver and heart very fine. Put a tumblerful of the 
broth they were boiled in into a stew-pan; thicken it with two 
fceaspc onfuls of flour; wet into a paste with a little of the broth; 
Btir to this an equal quantity of the pig gravy ; season with sage ; 
simmer two or three minutes ; salt and pepper to taste ; add the 
minced liver; serve in a tureen. The remainder of the harslet 
may be hashed ; add to it any gravy not required for the pig 
should any remain. Make the brains into a pancake ; fry, and gar- 
nish the dish with it, cutting it into small shapes; use alternately 
sprigs of parsley ; or, if the brains are not used in this way, ste\* 
them until done ; mash them, and add to the gravy. 



347. Gravy for Tripe, Cow Heel, or Calf's Read. — Roil and 
thicken two tumblers of beef or veal gravy ; add the grated rind 
of a lemon, a teaspoonful of curry powder; or season highly with 
red and black pepper if the curry is not liked ; simmer ten 
minutes ; add catsup to taste, and the juice of a lemon. If wine 
is preferred, add a wineglass of Madeira instead of the catsup. 



348. Stuffings — For a Boiled Fowl. — Moisten a pint of bread 
crumbs with hot milk; melt in the milk a tablespoonful of 
butter ; salt and pepper to taste ; mince fine as many oysters as 
bieal crumbs (or Irish potatoes boiled and mashed fine, as bread 
;ruml«, if it is not convenient to use o) 3ters) ; mix well, and 
*ttifl, allowing a little room foi the stuffing to swell ; close the 
iperture well so as to allow as little water as possible to get into 
the fowl. 



349. For Baked or Boast Fowls. — Moisten bread crumbs, 
hard biscuit or crackers, with boiling water; let it stand ui^il the 
bread can be mashed to a paste ; add a spoonful of butter before 



176 MRS. hill's new coor book. 

the boiling water is poured on ; season with salt and temper, an$ 
minced eschalot, onion, or parsley cut up fine. After mashing 
the bread, mix with it one or two eggs; put a teaspoonful of lard 
into the frying-pan; when hot, pour in the- batter, and fry until 
dry, stirring constantly ; use while hot. A richer stuffing is modi 
Dy using the yolks only of four or five eggs; milk and flour foi t 
Datter, the consistence of fritter batter ; sait and pepper to taste ; 
OLion if liked. Pour into a greased pan ; when browr. on one 
side, turn it; take it up when a good brown color; mash it up 
while hot with a tablespoonful of butter. The fowl should never 
be crammed tight with stuffing ; room should be left for it to 
swell. Put the stuffing in before putting the fowl to roast or 
bake ; it will be better if the fowl is stuffed an hour or more 
before it is cooked. I have known many cooks to half cook the 
fowl and then stuff. The longer the stuffing remains in the fowL 
so that it is not kept long enough to sour, the more completely 
the flavor of the seasoning is imparted to the meat. When the 
fowl is ready for the table, if the stuffing is performed skilfully, 
there will not be the least appearance of it visible upon the out- 
side. This stuffing, or any other, may be seasoned with mace, or 
nutmeg if liked, or with cauliflower chopped, mushrooms, almonds, 
potatoes, as persons may fancy. 



350. Stuffing for Pig. — Use equal quantities of cold hominy 
(or rice) and flour ; mince a few eschalots or an onion, a few sprigs 
of parsley, a little sage, salt and pepper ; make this into a dough , 
bake it a light brown ; while hot, mash it with sufficient butter to 
make it rich enough; stuff while hot; or use for the dough aalf 
flour and half corn meal. 



351. Potato Stuffing. — Bake or boil dry Irish potatoes; maah 
and strain them through a colander; mix with them an equal 
quantity of bread crumbs ; grate, and add three hard-boiled eggs ; 
mix with a large tablespoonful of butter. If not sufficiently 
moist add & little cream ; season to taste- -a delicate and delicioui

stuffing. "When batter-bread muffins, etc., are used, save some 
Tor stuffing ; corn meal batter-bread makes a fine pig stuffing. 
Meats are sometimes added to stuffing. Sausage-meat is consideied 
good to add to stuffing for baked turkey, also grated ham, 01 
tongue. All stuffings made of cold breads, and moistened with 
:ailk or water, are richer for being fried a few minutes after they 
are mixed and seasoned, stirring constantly. Stuffing should net 
as a general thing, be bound together with raw egg ; it is lightci 
without. 



352. Stuffing for Fish. — Butter slices of stale bread upon boti 
sides ; saturate them with wine, catsup, or cream, as preferred 
Cut again in smaller slices, and lay inside the fish; this also 
makes a good stuffing for game. 



353. M, Soger's Receipt for Stuffing for Goose. — For a mid- 
dling-sized fowl cut up a pound of onions; a teaspoonful of pul- 
verized sage if dry, two if green, and minced fine ; one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, one of brown sugar, one of pepper. Set this over a 
slow fire ; let it stew fifteen minutes ; then, with a spoon, stuiF the 
bird while the onion is hot. 



353$. Sauce Jelly for Fowls or Meat. — Yolks of two hard' 
boiled eggs rubbed to a paste ; two tablespoonfuls of butter, or 
gravy, one teaspoonfu' of jelly, a little vinegar, one of mixed 
mustard, ono tablespoonful minced pickle.

most other animals are confined to one. In man it is evident 
from his anatomical structure that he was intended to feed pro- 
miscuously on animal or vegetable food, as choice impelled. 

" No animal can live happily except in conformity to the laws 
of his constitution ; it follows, therefore, that man requires mixed 
food. A proper balance between the two kinds of food should 
be observed if we desire to live a natural and consequently 
healthy life. 

" A well arranged dietetic scheme ought to consist of such A 
combination of the albuminous, oleaginous and farinaceous con- 
stituents as is most appropriate to tne requirements of the system, 
and it is not only necessary fur the healthy support of the body 
that the food ingested should contain an adequate proportion of 
alimentary constituents, but that those should be in a wholesome 
or undecomposing state. 

"It Cannot be questioned that articles originally good and 
wholesome may derive a poisonous character from changes taking 
place in their own composition — a peculiar ferment is sometimes 
generated which the stomach is not able to bear." 



354 Vegetables. — Vegetables iniended for dinner should be 
gathered early in the morning. A few only can be kept twelve 
hours without detriment. " When fresh-gathered they are plump 
and firm, aid have a fragrant freshness no art can give them 
again when they have lost it by long keeping, though it will re- 
fresh them a little to put them into cold water before cccki.ig. n 
A little soda in the water they are cooked in will help to preserve 
the color of those that are green. They lose their good ippear

■nee and flavor if cooked too long, and are indigestible if nol 
cooked enough; close attention and good judgment are necessary 
to know the proper timo to take them up. Always drain the 
water from them well before sending to table ; have the dishes 
h »t upon which they are placed, and never send them to table 
until the meats are served ; when sent in too soon, and often un 
covered, they become chilled and unfit for use. Always put 
vegetables to boil in hot water. 



355. Asparagus. — When cut below the ground, skin the white 
part, or it will be tough ; cut as nearly as possible the same 
length; turn the points together, and tie in bunches. Have a 
stew-pan of boiling water salted; lay the asparagus in; boil 
briskly half an hour; toast slices of light bread; pour over a 
little of the asparagus water ; butter it well ; put the asparagus on 
the toast; serve hot. The toast may be omitted if not liked. 
Or, cut the stalks above the ground — this is more tender, but not 
so pretty ; cook in the same way ; and it is good cut in small 
pieces, stewed with pepper, salt, butter, and just water enough to 
cover them. Make a paste of a little of the water and a teaspoon ful 
of flour ; stir to the stew ; let it simmer five minutes. Take them 
op as soon as done ; too much cooking injures the color and flavor. 
Asparagus is good boiled tender, cut up and dressed as a salad, with 
hot vinegar, egg, butter, pepper and mustard. To be eaten hot. 



356. Burr Artichokes. — The burr or globe artichoke should be 
well washed ; put to boil in plenty of hot water, slightly salted ; boil 
until tender, which may be ascertained by drawing a leaf; trim 
the points; serve with melted butter, in a "ureen. A separate 
plate should be provided to serve them upon. 



357. Jerusalem Artichokes. — These may be sliced, and f>oiled 
like turnips, or cooked in any way Irish potatoes are. They 
require longer boiling. They are considered particularly good 
boiled and dressed as a salad. 



180 MRS. IIIIL's NEW COOK COOK. 

35S. Beets. — Dig them carefully, so that the fibres are as lilttt 
broken as possible ; if careless abo it this, red beets, when cot.kcd 
los? their fine color. Wash them well, and put them to boil in 
hot water from one to two hours, according to size. Presi 
them without piercing or breaking the skin, to ascertain »f they 
are done ; when they yield readily to the pressure, take then: \i\ 
a a pan of cold water ; rub off the skin, slice them, and dress mil 
butter, pepper, and salt when young and tender, or with salt, 
pepper, and vinegar if preferred. Old beets lose their sweetness 
and are best dressed with hot spiced vinegar, into which has beer, 
stirred a little sugar. They may be eaten cold when dressed 
with vinegar; they may be boiled, or baked and grated, and 
dressed as a salad. Beets have a finer flavor baked than boiled ; 
it requires longer time to cook them in this way. Be equally 
as careful not to break the skin or fibres. Beets may be pre. 
sei ved through the winter by hilling, as sweet potatoes are for 
winter. 



359. Beans. — String them carefully ; wash well, and boil thero 
briskly in an open vessel half an hour, or until tender; some 
varieties requires longer boiling than others. The water in which 
they are put to cook should be boiling and salted ; when tender, 
take them up in a colander ; drain the water carefully from them, 
and transfer them to a hot covered dish ; pour over melted 
butter. Some persons prefer their being boiled with a piece of 
bacon, the side meat is preferred ; either way is good. The meat 
Bhould boil half an hour before the beans are put in. Beans may 
be saved for winter by packing them in salt, a layer cf each ; th* 
beans should not be strung. Gather them at the age for boiling. 
When used, soak them until fresh enough. 



360. Lima, or Butter Beans. — When fully formed, and before 
the hull turns yellow, shell them ; wash well, and put them to 
boil in hot water, sufficiently salted to season then:. When 
tender, pour off nearly all the »»•*»»" make the remainder of th«

it/ioth rich with butter, and serve upon a hot dish. Never peppei 
thetn unless with white pepper; the small black particles of the 
common pepper upon so white a vegetable gives them an untidy 
look. 



361 Succotath — Boil butter-beans shelled (dried or green) 
half an hour ; salt the water; then add half as much green }. r\ 
cut from the cobs. Boil the cobs a few minutes when the beam 
are first put to boil. Take out the cobs ; add the corn ; to half a 
gallon of the succotash add a paste made of two tablespoonfuls of 
flour, and water sufficient to form the paste ; season with salt and 
butter enough to make it as rich as may be liked. This is also 
very good boiled in the broth in which poultry has been boiled, 
or cooked with a small piece of pork. Succotash may be madfc 
of dried beans, and corn dried for winter use; soak them an houi 
before using. Dried beans are excellent baked with pickled pork 

i 

302. Brocoli. — Gather hard heads; peel the stalks; boil in 
salted water briskly, leaving the vessel open twenty minutes, or 
•mtil tender ; take them up and pour over melted butter. Serve hot. 



363. Cabbage. — Take off the green leaves ; quarter the heads ; 
wash them well, examining between the leaves for insects ; let them 
lie in cold water until it is time to put them to boil ; cut off part 
of the thick stalk, or the leaves will be overdone before the stalk 
is tender. Put in boiling water, sufficiently salted ; it should be 
well covered with water ; if too little is used, the cabbage will be 
strong. Some kinds of cabbages require to be first parboiled, 
then put in another water ; always using boiling water. When 
tender, take them up in a colander; drain off all the water ; put 
them upon a not dish, and cover with slices of butter, putting 
iome between the loaves. It is also liked boiled in the liquor in 
* hich bacon has been boiled ; when cooked in this way, take up 
the meat, the flavor of the cabbage would injure the meat; skim 
off all impurities on the liquor, and put the catbage in; boU

brisklj ; and when done, they will sink to the bcttom ; take them 
up immediately into a colander, and drain well. Serve in a hot 
dish, and never in the same disli with the meat. 

The remains of cabbage used at dinner is sometimes chopped 
6) e and fried svith a little butter or lard, and served as a break 
r «U dish. 



364. To Stuff Cabbage. — Strip off the green leaves ; examine and 
wash well ; lay in cold water until ready for use. Cut out the heart, 
or centre, leaving two or three rows of leaves. Scald the cabbage 
well ; when the leaves wilt from the scalding, there will be less 
danger of their breaking. Chop the leaves fine; add to them 
any scraps of cold meat or poultry ; season high with pepper and 
salt ; and if the flavor is liked, an onion, shred fine ; bind the 
whole together with a raw egg, worked in; a few bread crumbs 
may be added. Make this into several balls, or one large ball, 
and put in the centre of the cabbage ; fold the leaves over care- 
fully ; wrap well with thread ; over this put a thin netting or 
muslin; tie it securely, and boil until the cabbage is tender. 
Drain it from the water ; serve upon a hot dish, with melted 
butter poured over. Remove the cloth and strings before pour 
ing over the butter. 



305. Hot Slaio. — Cut the cabbage in four quarters : after wash, 
ing it carefully, parboil ten minutes. Take it out of the water 
cut in thin slices ; put it in a stew-pan ; season with salt ; add a 
wineglass of hot water, an even tablespoonful of butter; cover 
the stew-pan, and let the cabbage stew until tender ; stir it fre- 
quently from the bottom. When tender, which will probably 
require an hour's steady stewing, add as much vinegar as will 
give the mass a pleasant acid taste. 



366. Cold Slaw. — Cut a head of hard white cabbage into very 
fine shavings. It is seldom shaved fine enough. For a quart of 
ihe cabbage take the yolks of three eggs, beat -them well ; stir into 



VEGETABLES. 183 

ft tumMer and a half of vinegar two teaspoonfuls of loaf sugar, 
a tablespoonful of olive oil, one of thick, swe^t cream, or a pieo« 
of butter as large as a walnut, a heaped teaspoonful of mustard 
•alt and pepper to taste; mix with the egg, and put this sauot 
into a stew-pan; when not add the cabbage; stew imli 
thoroughly hot, which will only require four or five minutes 
Toss it up from the bottom with a silver or wooden fork. 'lakt 
it up and set where it will become perfectly cold, on ice is best, 
The quantity of vinegar will depend upon its strength. 



3G7. Saucr Kraut. — Quarter a dozen hard heads of cabbage; 
cut olfthe stalks closely; sprinkle salt in the bottom of a cask; 
pack the cabbage down firmly; put over another layer of salt; 
when all are in, cover with a heavy weight. Keep the cask in a 
cool place. In four or five weeks the pieces will be ready for use. 

To cook sauer kraut : Soak in plenty of water until fresh 
enough. Boil until tender, with bacon, pickled pork, or in water 
salted ; and, when tender, add butter when boiled in water. After 
being boiled, it may be fried with a small piece of butter or lard, 



3G8. — Cauliflower. — Remove all green leaves. To look well 
this vegetable should be very white. Boil it in water salted, or 
half sweet milk ; when tender, put over it, while hot, slices cf 
butter, putting some on the inside. This vegetable is fine in 
soups, to season meat sauces, for salads and pickle. 



360. Carrots. — Carrots require longer cooking tLun anj 
othtr vegetable. When young, they only require to be washed 
before being cooked. Old carrots should be cut into slices, 
and stewed until tender; season with salt and butter. Carrots 
are good in soup, and are better grated ; they give a rich coloi 
io soups. 

370. Celery. — This is usually served without being ccoked, 
but may be stewed. Cut the root in small pieces ; add water to 



184 mrs. n ill's new cook book. 

cover it season with salt; simmer until nearly done; add hut 
tor, into which has been rubbed a little flour. When sufficiently 
cooked, just before taking it up, add a wineglass of sweet cream 



371. Cucumbers. — Gather them early in the morning; pu* 
hem in water. An hour before they are to be served, peel and 
out them in thin, round slices; cover with cold water until a few 
minutes before sending to the table. Pour off this water ; add a 
tnird as much white onion, cut in thin slices, as cucumber. Tha 
onion should be skinned and kept in cold water until used ; sea- 
son with salt, pepper and vinegar. Cucumbers may also to 
stewed as squashes, and seasoned with butter, or sliced length 
wise, rolled in corn meal, salted and fried. 



372. Corn. — Gather the ears when the grains are full of milk, 
but before they are hard ; remove the shuck and silk ; put the 
corn in boiling water, with a little salt iii it ; boil half an hour if 
the corn is young. Serve the ears hot as they are boiled, or cut 
them from the cobs with a sharp knife; put in a deep covered 
dish ; season with salt, pepper, and butter. Sugar corn is best 
for the table. 



373. Samp. — Take the corn when the grains are full, but 
milky ; with a sharp knife shave off the corn to the cob ; be 
careful not to cut the cob (that would injure the taste of the 
corn) ; "scrape out the milk. Put it all in a stew-pan ; pour over 
four times its bulk of boiling water ; add salt to taste. Let the 
mass boil four hours, covered ; boil slowly. Eat with butter ; or 
pour into pans ; cut in slices, when cold, and fry. Stir ire<j jently 
when the corn is nearly done. 



374. To Stew Ccrn. — Cut it from the cobs with a sharp knife; 
put it in a stew-pan with the milk which came from the corn, and 
to each quart of corn, half a tumbler of water; stew until done, 
which will require from a half to three quarters of an hour 



VEGETABLES. 183 

depending upon the age of the corn. When done, season with 
pepper, saH, and butter. Or, put the corn, after it U cut fiom 
tho cobs, into a frying-pan; add a tunMer of water to a quart- 
■tew half an hour, stirring frequently; season with peppur and 
■alt; add a piece of lard or butter as large as a walnut, and fry 
until a light brown color, or less if preferred. Corn may be 
rousted by wiping it on the gridiron, after removing the shuck ; 
tun; it often until the grains are all a light brown color ; eat 
w th salt. 



375. Green Corn Fritters. — Six cars of boiled corn grated, 
hree eggs; beat the yolks; mix with the corn; season with 
pepper and salt ; add two even tablespoonfuls of sifted (lour; 
beat the whites to a stiiF froth, and add last. Fry as fritters, in 
not lard. Serve upon a napkin laid upon a flat dish. Another 
vay : Grate four ears of corn; beat five eggs separately; stir 
the yolks with the corn; two teacups of flour, sour milk sufficient 
to make a batter thick as rice batter cakes, half a teaspooufui oi 
soda ; add the whites last, beaten to a stiff froth. Yry as fritters, 
or bake as griddle cakes. 



376. Green Com Pudding. — Two well beaten eggs, two tum- 
blers of grated corn, half a tumbler of milk, tablespoon a little 
heaped of butter, pepper and salt to taste. Bake. 



377. Green Corn Pudding, No. 2 — Mrs. C?s Receipt. — One 
pint of green corn grated, one large teacup of cream, one heaped 
tablespoonful of flour, one tablespoonful of good butter, four well 
beaten eggs, salt to taste ; bake half an hour without scorching. 
ITiis may be used as a dessert, with a good sauce. 



378. Green Corn. — Green corn may be kept krr winter use by 
parboiling it. Cut it from the cobs, and dry in the sun; keep in 
paper tags, in a dry place. Soak it and use with dry beans to make 
•uocotash. Another way : Remove all the green shuck but the 



186 MRS. HILL'S. NEW COOK BOOR. 

layer next the cob; tie the open end securely, wrapping th« 
siring around the whole ear; pack in salt. Sweet corn is b*st 
for preserving in this way. 



379. Eschalot. — A species of onion. They are good in tin 
f pring Strip off the outside skin ; cut off all the green part 
boil in salted water ; serve with melted butter ; or cut them fine, 
using a little of the green top joining the root; put them on the 
fire in cold water in a frying-pan ; when the water is nearlv 
ready to boil, pour it off; add a few slices of pork or bacon, and 
fry, turning them frequently. Some persons eat them raw. 
served with lettuce, radishes, and water-cresses. They may be 
used for seasoning in the place of onions. 



380. Endive. — This is only used for salad. In the fall and 
spring (have two plantings) tie up the heads, and bleach them • 
they become beautifully white and crisp. Serve it as a salad 
with the same sauce used with lettuce salad. 



381. Egg-Plant. — The purple is best. Peel and parboil them ; 
mash fine; season with salt, pepper, and a little onion, if the flavor 
is not disliked ; add butter to make it moderately rich. Put this 
mixture in a deep earthen dish ; grate over it bread crumbs, and 
bake a light brown color. 

382. Gasparcho. — Flour crickers (large square kind), put in 
ice-water enough to saturate them ; cut up one-half dozen green 
peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions. Chop peppers and onions j 
Cir cucumbers and tomatoes in thin slices, make a sauce of raus- 
iar 1, salt, vinegar, and olive-oil; mash the crackers; mix tho veg- 
etables, and pour over the sauce. 



383. Egg-Plant, No. 3. — Cut a round piece from one end of 
tha plant ; with the handle of a spoon sco >p out the inside. Pa?

Oo:J the shell in water, a little jailed, five minutes; take it out, 
phmge it in cold water. Stew the inside with a little onion, pep)»ei 
and *alt, until done. Beat cne or two eggs ; add to the stew with 
butte.* to season it properly — for the inside of one egg-plant • 
heap^a veaspoonful of butter will be sufficient, and one egg; n.jt 
well and stew until dry, adding half as much bread ciumbn au 
egg-plant ; stuff the shell with this ; a little minced veal, ham, 
tongue, or poultry may be added to the stuffing, and is an im- 
provement. Tie on the piece cut off. Put the egg-plants to 
bake in a (\ish, the bottom of which is covered with slices of 
bacon; bake m. hour; serve on a flat dish whole; remove the 
6tring and top piece. The egg-plant is sometimes cut in half, 
lengthwise, the «».itents removed, and stewed as above ; the half 
pieces parboiled ui.til tende* in water salted; then stuffed with a 
rich force-meat ; h coating of egg spread over the open side, 
bread crumbs sprinkled ovei ; put in a dish with slices of cold 
ham. and baked untii tender , either way is good. 



384. To Fry Plu>*. — Feel the egg-plant; cut it in thin 
slices; strew salt between the slices; let them remain an hour; 
parboil them five miliums; roll each slice in flour or corn meal ; 
fry a golden color in boiling lard ; turn the pieces once ; serve 
upon a napkin. 

385. Greens. — Kale, or cole, mustard, cabbage sprouts, turnip 
tops, to any of which may be added a few beet tops, the younjj 
shoots of the poke plant, all make good spring greena, Picl 
and wash them ; let them lie in cold water at least an houj 
before, they are used. Put them on in plenty of boiling water 
salted ; boil briskly twer ty minutes ; they will sink to the bottom 
when done. Take them up in a colander; press the water from 
them; put upon a hot dish; cut across the leaves in sevetal 
places with a sharp knife; p< ur over melted butter; dress with 
poached eggs, either placed upon the dish of greens or served in 
a separate dish. They are not go< d unless served hot. Scnu 



188 MR8. nil.L's NEW COOK BOOR. 

pers< ns prefer greens boiled with a piece cf bacon or hock boM 
of ham. No matter in what way they are cooked, poached eggs 
should accompany them. 

386. Leeks. — These are a species of onion, and mere delicsU 

han any of the tribe. They are ready for us* early in th» 

spring. Skin them ; lay in cold water an hour ; boil in salted 

water until they yield readily to pressure. Put them upon a hoi 

covered dish ; pour over melted butter. 



387. Lettuce. — This vegetable is usually served in a raw state, 
as a salad ; but is sometimes cooked, cut up, seasoned with salt 
and pepper, fried with pork until wilted, or stewed with aspara- 
gus, green peas, and slices of lamb or mutton. For salad : Make 
a sauce; put it upon the bottom of the salad bowl. Gather the 
lettuce early in the morning Wash them well, but very deli- 
cately, as they are easily bruised. Lay the heads in ice-cold 
water ; keep in a cold place, or they will not be crisp. If the 
heads are large, divide them, but use the knife carefully ; much 
pressure will destroy the crispness of the vegetable, without 
which a salad is valueless. Ten minutes before dinner is served, 
clip the lettuce with a sharp pair of scissors kept for this pur- 
pose ; they are best long and slender. The clipping should be 
done by " fairy" fingers. Put the lettuce (while clipping it) upon 
a clean towel ; then strew it lightly over the sauce, which has 
already been placed upon the bottom of the sauce-bowl. If con- 
venient, now set the bowl upon ice until needed. In serving, 
toss the lettuce with the sauce lightly, stirring from the bottom, 
using a wooden fork and spoon. Separate plates should be used 

or serving the salad. 

388. To Make the Sauce. — One teaspoonful of mustard, one of 
salt, two of loaf sugar pulverized, a tablespoonful of olive oil, a 
teacup of vinegar ; mix these together ; put in a stew-pan until 
■calding hot. Beat two eggs well ; pour to them the hot vinegar 



VEGETABLES. 189 

stirring constantly until the dunge» of the eggs curdling is over 
It must be entirely cold before being applied to the lettuce. 

Another Sauce : For a quart of lettuce boil three eggs until 
the yolks are hard ; separate them from the whites, mash them 
imootlily with the back of a wooden spoon; mash a small Irish 
f-otato with a large tablespoonful of thick sweet cream; strai 
Jse potato through a sieve ; mix with the egg ; add a teaspoonfu 
of mustard, one of loaf sugar heaped, a teaspoonful of salt, a wine- 
glass of good apple vinegar. Put this sauce on the bottom of 
the salad bowl. There is a prejudice with many against the use of 
olive oil ; this is needless if the oil is fresh ; no taste of it is dis- 
cernible. The clarified essence of ham may be used in its place. 
Butter does not answer well. When cold, the particles harden, 
and separate from the vinegar. The sauce, by some, is preferred 
ivithout oil or butter, using only salt, pepper, vinegar, and sugar. 
It is well to dress one salad bowl with the lettuce whole, mixing 
in radishes, celery, cresses, and young eschalots, leaving a few 
inches of the green tops ; season extempore upon the plate to 
taste, sugar, mustard, etc., being at hand. 



389. Winter Salads — May be made of beet roots boiled and 
grated, artichokes in the same way, endive cut up (after being 
bleached) as lettuce; with these mix the sauce thoroughly with 
the vegetables. Irish potatoes boiled and mashed, seasoned with 
salad sauce (butter may be used with them) is very good cold, 
but much better hot. A tier seasoning, return to the stew-pan 
until hot. Reserve in every case the whites for ornamenting 
Cut them in rings; lay over the salad with sprigs of parsley. 



$96 Mushrooms.- -Great care should be used in gathering 
them. There is a poisonous kind nearly resembling the edible 
kind, and fatal mistakes have occurred. The good are first very 
•mall, of a rouid form, with small stalk ; the upper part and stalk 
are white; the under, a salmon color, and, as they increase in size, 
Decomc brown. They grow rapidly, and are found in open 



191) MRS. hill's new cook book. 

fields or pastures; reject those found in shady places. The smell 
of the genuine mushroom ?t * pleasant. They are indigestible. 
They may be cooked in a variety of ways. To broil : Select 
large ones; lay the flaps on tne gridiron; broil until thoroughly 
fei,t. Serve with butter, pepper, and salt. 



S91. To Stew, — Take the large buttons; peel them ; cut i ft th« 
tftalks ; put them in a stew-pan with a tablespoonful of vh eg;ti 
butter, sa!t, and pepper, according to the quantity cooked. Coyci 
the stew-pan, and 1 it them cook until tender ; add another piece 
of butter, into which has been stirred a little flour; let this 
become hot. Lay a few slices of toast (which should be prepared 
while the mushrooms are being cooked) in the bottom of a hot, 
deep covered dish. Pour over the contents of the stew-pan, and 
serve immediately. 

392. To Bake Mushrooms. — Rub off the skins of the large flaps 
with salt and a piece of coarse clean cloth ; trim the fringe from 
the small ones ; cut off the stalks ; lay them upon their back in 
an earthen dish. For a pint, use a large tablespoonful of fresh 
butter, with an even tablespoonful of brown flour stirred to it; 
put some of this upon each mushroom; bake until tender, which 
will require from twenty to thirty minutes. Serve upon toast; 
first dip the toast in boiling water. 



393. Nasturtion. — The blooms are gay, and make a fine relish 
eaten with cold, light bread, buttered. They make a beautiful 
breakfast dish. This vegetable is seldom used, however, but foi 
p-bkling; for this, gather the pods when fully grown. They sent 
u a good substitute for capers in making sauce. 



39 1. Ochra. — Gather only the young pods. They should be 
vei) little washed, and not suffered to remain a minute in water, 
and never trim them until after they are washed, as they lost 
much of the fin© mucilage that makes the vegetable so valuable 



VEGETABLES. 101 

It may be used n soup, or to mane gumbo (which is a thick soup), 
and stewed, fried, etc , and may be dried and preserved as & 
wiuter vegetable. Receipts for soup and gumbo have already 
beeu given. 

395. To Slew Ochra. — Cut it in round slices ; put it in a stew 
t in; for a quart, add a wineglass of hct water, a tablespoonful 
of buiter, into which has been rubbed an even teaspoonful of 
flour; salt and pepper to taste. Cover the stew-pan, shake it 
occasionally, and stew until tender; serve in a hot covered d'sh. 
A few tomatoes and a little onion stewed with the ochra is an 
improvement. This is excellent used as a sauce for plain boiled 
rice. 



390. To Fry Ochra. — Boil a quart; strain it well from the 
wa*er; mash it smooth; season with salt and pepper. Beat in 
one or iwo eggs, and add flour (about half a tumbler of sifted 
flour) to make the batter stiff enough to fry as fritters. Serve 
on a flat dish upon a napkin. They should not be piled ; send in 
as fast as fried. 



397. To Dry for Winter Use. — Quarter thorn ; use only those 
that are tender ; string them ; hang them in an airy room until 
dry. To cook them, soak twelve hours. 



398. Onions. — For seasoning, the red onion will answer; but 
only use the white silver-skinned for boiling, stewing, etc. Take 
oflTthe outer skins until the white solid part is reached ; cut off s 
iliee, top and bottom. Put them to bcil in a covered vessel ; 
pour over hot water to cover them ; add a little salt to the water. 
When done, take them up with a perforated skimmer entirely 
clear of water ; dress with melted butter. 



899. Onion Custard. — Skin and slice ten medium-sized white, 
silver orions; fry them in fresh butter; as soon as of a golden

cg or, drain them from the buttei ; mince them very fine. Beat 
four eggs; stir to them slowly, stirring constantly, two tumblers 
of sweet milk ; stii all to the onions ; season with salt, pepper, 
and nutmeg. Pour in an earthen dish that will just hold it, and 
Wke f ileen minutes. Fried onions are relished by some persons 



400. Onion Stew. — Cut up six white onions, medium-size; 
*hce as much Irish potatoes after peeling. Put all in a stew-pan ; 
four over a pint of hot water ; season with salt and pepper ; cover 
dose; simmer gently; when nearly done, add a tablespoonful of 
t Hitter, with a heaped teaspoonful of flour rubbed into it, and 
l.alf a tumbler of sweet cream. Stir from the bottom to prevent 
ts scorching, and when just ready to boil, pour into a hot covered 
Aish ; serve immediately. This is a fine accompaniment to boiled 
poultry or mutton. 



401. Irish Potatoes. — To cook them when very young, wash 
tbem; scrape of the skin; put them in a stew-pan; cover with 
hot water ; boil gently until tender ; pour off the water ; aci* 4 to 
a quart oft potatoes a heaped tablespoonful of butter, with a tea 
spoonful of flour rubbed into it ; pour in a tumblerful of sweet 
cream or milk ; stew, uncovered, five minutes ; serve in a hot 
dish. 



40 1£ Irish Potato Puff. — Two cups of cold mashed potatoes; 
taro tablespoon fills of melted butter; beat together until smooth; 
add two well-beaten eggs and a cup of sweet milk ; pour into • 
b vking dish ; bake quick, and serve immediately. 



402. To Boil Potatoes Fully Grown. — First assort them, anl 
boil togetiier those of the same size. Common sense teaches 
that this ought to be done, since when large and small go to the 
Ktttlt together the small ones are spoiled before the larger ones 
ate sufficiently cooked. Wash them well in several waters. 
Put thjm to boil in hot water to cover them, slightly salted.

Hour, then leave it open until the potatoes are lone to tho centre; 
try one with a fork. Pour off every drop of the water that can 
he ; set the vessel on the coolest part of the stove ; leave it open 
ten minutes. Pour them into a colander; skin rapidly, putting 
them into a hot dish. Some cooks pour them from the boiling 
rater into cold water ; this is done to make the skinning easier 
After th : s, the next step should be to throw them to the pigs, as 
they ah* orb the water, and are rendered hard and sodden, and 
unfit for the table. Serve with melted butter. Potatoes should 
never be sent to the table until the plates are served with tho 
first course of meat, then they should make their appearance 
smoking hot. The practice in very many families is to put all 
the vegetables upon the table at once. This is wrong. Send 
them as they are needed, particularly in cold weather. When 
the ham is served, send the cabbage and beans ; serve those vege- 
tables generally relished with that particular kind of meat. 
With boiled pork, beef, mutton, etc., send turnips, potatoes, etc., 
and so with the variety of meats. 



403. To Steam Potatoes. — Put them in a steamer, and set it 
over a boiler ; when done, leave the steamer uncovered. The 
boiler should be partly filled with water, and kept boiling 
steadily until the potatoes are cooked. 



404. To Boil Old Potatoes. — Boil them by the foregoing receipt. 
Have a coarse clean towel in the hand, and as each potato is re- 
moved, wring it in a corner of the towel ; slip the skin ofT and 
they are delightfully mealy. Serve with melted butter, on a hot 
iish. When potatoes are old they are good baked and served in 
Ibeir jackets. Eat with cold butter. 



405. To Stew Potatoes. — Peel and slice them thin, put them in 
a stew-pan, cover with sweet milk, or half milk and water. But- 
ter to season them, with a little flour rubbed to the butter ; add 
this to the potatoes ; salt and pepper to taste ; stew until the pota-

toes are soft. They may be sliced and stewed in very little watel 
then dressed with butter and cream. 



406. To Scollop Potatoes. — Boil, and mash them ivith the end 
of' a rolling-pin until perfectly smooth; season highly w th sell, 
ptpper, butter, and two or three hard-boiled eggs chopped fin* 
(three eggs for a quart of mashed potatoes); fill an earthen Jish 
with it. Bake long enough to form a slight crust, and just before 
being sent to the table. 



407. Potato Salad. — Mash and strain the potatoes through a 
colander ; make them rich with butter ; season with a sauce made 
by mashing the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs for a quart; a 
teaspoonful of unmade English mustard, pepper and salt; a nvi 
cup of good apple vinegar; a teaspoonful of loaf sugar may be 
added to the vinegar; mix this thoroughly with the potato. 
Put it in a stew-pan and when hot serve; ornament the top with 
rings cut out of the white of the egg and sprigs of parsley. Somo 
persons prefer this cold ; it is good either way. 



408. To Fry Potatoes. — Boil and mash them ; season with aalt 
and pepper ; make into cakes as large as the top of a tumbler ; roll 
in flour and fry a light brown color. Very little frying is neces- 
sary. Serve upon a napkin placed upon the bottom of a flat dish. 
They should not be piled ; serve as fast as fried. Cold potatoes 
may be sliced and fried. 



409. To Bake Sweet Potatoes. — Take them of the name size ; 
wash them well; cut off the ends; put them in an oven or stotr*- 
pin. For a peck of potatoes, pour in the oven a tumbler of he* 
water ; turn them once when half done ; bake slowly. If an oven 
is used, put lire on the lid. When done they nay be served in 
their jackets, or peeled, and sl.ced ; put a layer on the bottom of a 
shallow earthen dish, then a few bits of butter, a little sugar, a 
slight seasoning of cinnamon or nutmeg ; another layer of potato

and seasoning until the dish is filled. Set it in the oven until hot 
and ser\e. 



401. To Roast Sweet Potatoes. — Sweep a hot hearth well ; lay 
©n the potatoes ; cover with ho', ashes; let them remain until ten 
er. liish potatoes may be cooked in the same way. 



411 To Fry Sweet Potatoes. — Take large potatoes, peel and 
slice tnem ; fry them in hot lard, turn often, salt each piece slignt- 
ly ; serve ou a nar kin. A good breakfast dish. 



412. To Stew Sweet Potatoes. — Slice them half an inch thick ; 
stew with pork chops, or pieces of the tenderloin. Take all up 
together when done. Season the gravy with cream, a little pars- 
ley minced fine, salt and pepper. 

Potatoes are liked peeled and roasted under meat. The large- 
sized ones should not be used for this style of cooking; the 
medium size is best. 



413. Green Peas. — Shell them ; wash them well; put them in 
a stew-pan ; cover with boiling water and stew covered until ten 
der ; add salt to the water. They should be boiled fast to retain 
their color; half an hour will generally be sufficient time, but try 
one or two. Drain off the water ; pour them into a hot covered 
dish and dress with fresh butter. When a little old, boil them 
with a very small piece of super-carb. soda ; a little sugar when 
they begin to lose their sweetness. A double kettle, putting 
peas inside without water, boils them well. Since the seasoi. 
green peas I have met with the following receipt ; it may or ma> 
tot be good. Try it. 

Cover the bottom of the stew-pan with lettuce leaves ; pour in 
the pea? ; add for each quart of peas a tablespoonful of butter ; salt 
U> taste; the butter being salted, very little will be required. Cover 
the 8te>v pan ; set it over a moderate fire ; shake it frequently, and 
once or twice stir from the bottom. Should there be too little

moisture after cooking a while, add more butter. Serve when te* 
der ; use a little sugar if liked. 

414. Hopping John. — Pick out all defective ones from a quart 
of dried peas ; soak them several hours in tepid watei ; boil them 
with a chicken or piece of pickled pork until the peas ari 
thoroughly done. In a separate stew-pan boil half as much rice 
dry ; take the peas from the meat, mix them with the rice, ivy a 
few minutes until dry. Season with pepper and salt. This may 
be made of green English peas. 



415. Dried Peas. — Soak several hours in water; pick out al! 
lefective ones ; put them in hot water ; boil until tender. Dress 
vith butter, or boil with a piece of pickled pork ; drain from the 
vater through a colander before adding the butter. Salt to taste. 



416. Pumpkin. — Cut the pumpkin open; take out the seed, 
out do not scrape the inside; peel the rind off; cut in small 
pieces. Put them to stew in a covered vessel, with very little 
water; stir often from the bottom, to prevent its scorching. 
When done it may be kept several days in a cool place ; use an 
earthen vessel. Dress with butter and a little sugar and ginger, 
as a stew, or fry with a little sweet lard, or use for making pud- 
dings and custards. 



417. Winter Squash and Cashaw — May be used in the same 
way. The cashaw is also good cut in half, the seed removed, 
baked with the rind on ; when done, scrape out the inside, and 
•eason to taste with bu.ter, pepper, and a little sugar. 



418. Parsnips. — Scrape them, and split them a few inches oMy 
when young ; when old, slice them. Stew them, covered with 
water, until tender — half an hour will be sufficient time for young 
roots; much longer for older oi.es. Dress with butter, salt, and 
pepper.

419. To Fry 7%em.--Boil whole ones until tender. When 
oold, slice a quarter of an inch thick; season with salt and pep* 
per, and fry in boiling lard Take the pieces up with a perforated 
skimmer. Serve hot. 



420. Parsnip Fritters. — Boil enough parsnips to mafce ^w* 
tumblerfuls, when mashed and rubbed through the colander j 
season with salt and pepper; add one well-beaten egg, and flour 
enough to hold it together (half a teacup full will be sufficient) ; 
fry in thick cakes. Serve as fast as they are fried. The sugar 
parsnip is best. 

421. To Fry Them in Batter.— Make a thin batter. Boil the 
parsnips in salted water; slice them; dip the pieces in batter* 
take up some of the batter with each slice. Fry in boiling laud 
a light brown color. 



422. Radishes — Are served in a raw state. Gather them early 
in the morning; break off part of the long tap-root, and cut off 
all the top except an inch or two ; wash them well, and keep in 
ice-cold water until it is time to serve them. Put them upon a 
salad bowl, with lettuce, cresses, etc., or in glass stands. The 
crimson ones are highly ornamental. Radishes are more digestible 
if grated and seasoned with salt and pepper ; used as a salad. 



423. Spinach. — Wash the leaves in several waters ; keep it 
in cold water until it is time to put it to boil. Put it in hot water, 
slightl) salted ; have just water enough to cover it. Cover the 
•tew-pan, and boil briskly until the leaves are tender ; they will 
•ink when done. Pour into a colander, and pi ess the water out, 
wipe out the stew-pan ; cut up the spinach fine ; put it in fche stew- 
pan; season with pepper and butter enough to make it rich. 
When thoroughly hot, stir the butter in well, and serve hot

ing each plate to an egg, which should be out up and well mi led 
with the spinach. Spinach may be boiled with bacon, but is not 
go delicate. The dish may be garnished with hard-boiled eggs 
iliced, instead of the poached, if preferred. When well aoiled 
Mid served, this is the most delicious of the spring greens. 



424. —Salsify. — Scrape the roots well ; cut off the tops close 
10 the root; slice them long, or circular. Stew until tender; 
*alt the water ; dram them from the water. Wipe out the stew- 
pan ; return the salsify to it, and add sweet milk enough to cover 
it. To three trroblerfuls of the salsify add a piece of butter as 
large as a large hen's egg ; rub into it a teaspoonful of flour ; 
season wich salt and pepper; let this stew five minutes, covered; 
shake the par. well twice ; remove it from the fire, and add vine- 
gar, to give a pleasant acid taste. Serve hot, in a covered dish. 
Chis is called " mock oyster." 



425. Salsify Fritters. — Scrape the roots ; stew them until they 
can be mashed well ; rub them through a sieve ; season with salt 
and pepper. To three tumblerfuls add a well-beaten egg, a tea- 
spoonful of butter, half a tumbler of flour; mix well, and fry in 
thick cakes, in boiling lard. The salsify may be grated without 
being cooked. Make a batter with one or two eggs, sour milk, 
a little soda, and to a tablespoonful of the batter add a teaspoon- 
fill of the grated salsify; fry in hot lard. Serve upon a napkin 
placed in the bottom of the dish. The grated root has more of 
the taste of the vegetable than that which has been cooked. 



420. Squash. — Gather them as long as the outside skin can Xm 
easily punctured ; after that they are too old. Peel and slice 
them ; keep them in water until time to cook them — from half on 
hour to three quarters is sufficient, depending upon the age and 
size. Salt the water they are boiled in. Put them to cook in 
hot water; keep the vessel covered. Wh^ tender, empty them 
u»t*> a colander, and press the water out; mas:** the:n; wipe out 



vkoetahi.es. 19C 

the stew-pan ; return the squash, and season with cream, butter 
salt, and pepper. Squashes are al»o very nice sliced, parboiled 
antil tender, pressed between two plates until dry, dipped in 
thin batter, and fried. Serve them as fast as fried; they should 
nut be piled. They may also be mashed, and made intc 
fritters, in the same way that the salsify fritters are. Winte 
jqtashe-3 require more cooking, and should have the seed re 
moved. 



427. Ghiinea Squash. — Boil the squashes until the skin can 
easily be taken off, cut in pieces the size of oysters. Put into a 
pan a layer of bread-crumbs, a little salt, pepper, and nutmeg, 
with a covering of butter. Then put on the squash, and repeat 
until the dish is full, having the crumbs on top. Add a little 
water, and brown nicely.

sized onion (or less if preferred), and if the flavor of onion is not 
Jikcd, omit it altogether; a tablespoonful of good brown sugar 
a teaspoonful of pepper, salt to taste, a teacup of bread crumbs, 
a large heaped tablespoonful of good butter. Put in a covered 
stew-pan, and cook an hour; shake the pan well and frequently. 
Beat up the yolks of two or three eggs, and, just before serving, 
stir them rapidly to the tomatoes; let them remain a minute, 
and serve in a small tureen, or covered dish. This is a fine 
accompaniment to all kinds of baked or roast meat. Tomatoes 
are best cooked a long while. 



429. To Bake Tomatoes. — Peel and mince enough U fill a 
quart dish; season them with sugar, mace, pepper, salt, and * 
little minced onion. Put a layer of bread crumbs upon the but 
torn cf the dish; then a layer of tomatoes, a little butter, another

and pepper; skin the tomatoes; slice the ochra; add a little 
onion ; add a little sugar to the tomatoes. Stew without water, 
three quarters of an hour ; add a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut to each quart of the mixture, when first put in the 
stew-pan. 

432. Tomato Salad. — Scald and peel thorn ; slice them thin ; 
season with salt, pepper, sugar, and a little onion ; add very little 
vinegar. 

Tomatoes are excellent seasoned and boiled in a double kettla 
a long time — for a quart, two hours. Their own juice will be 
sufficient fluid. 



433. Tomato Fritters. — Take equal quantities of tomatoes (skin 
and mince fine, and strain them from their liquor) and green corr 
very tender t scrape it from the cob with a sharp knife ; use the 
milk of this. Season with sugar, salt, and pepper. Add for a 
quart of the mixture two well-beaten eggs, one tumbler of sweet 
milk, and flour enough to hold the mass together. Fry in thick 
cakes in boiling lard. 

434. Tomato Leather. — Mash fine; strain through a sieve ; add 
ft little sugar; grease panes of glass; spread over the mixture. 
Hid dry. This can be used in soup or stews.

a glass jar and aoverw th weak vinegar; b ak before using. To 
Dittoes may be easily kept in self-sealing cans, and will well repay 
the trouble and expense. A good receipt for canning fruits and 
v< g( tables, and also f >r bottling them, may be found in this book. 
Tomatoes may be kept in salt. Gather them just be fere they 
tie fully ripe; keep on the stems; put a layer of salt, then on* 
of tomatoes. Keep well covered in a cool place. Soak befor* 
using. 

430. Tomato Paste. — Skin and cut up ripe tomatoes ; salt 
them to taste. Let them stand twelve hours ; strain them from 
their liquor ; use this for catsup. Put the pulp in a double ket- 
tle or ungiazed jar ; season with sugar, pepper, mace, or nutmeg ; 
to a quart of tomatoes add a tumbler of good apple vinegar. 
Stew, stirring frequently, until this thickens to a paste; it will 
require two or more hours, depending on the quantity made. 
Dry it upon dishes, then pack in wide-mouthed glass bottles ; 
cork well and keep in a dry place. A piece four inches square 
will season a gallon of soup. It will be found to be verj useful 
for winter soups and sauces. 



437. Turnips. — Peal and slice a quarter of an inch thick ; keep 
them in cold water until the hour for cooking. Put them in hot 
water to cover them, slightly salted ; stew until tender. If young 
it will require from twenty to thirty minutes ; longer time for 
older ones. When tender, lay the slices in a hot, deep disn ; 
pour over butter to make them rich ; serve hot. 

Another way : Slice them and boil with pork ; mash them, 
and rub through a colander. Put them in a stew-pan with a lit- 
tie of the skimmings of the pet; salt and pepper. When thor 
fcughly hot, aerve. Always serve on i separate dish; never un

tablespoonful of ground mustard (a little garlic is sometimes 
used). Put all these well mixed in a stew-pan ; simmer gently 
four hours. Stir frequently, to prevent its scorching. Strain; 
when cold, bottle ; use new corks. It is poor economy to use 
old corks.

three tablespoonfuls of ground black pepper, three of salt, three 
of English mustard, two of mixed spices, a teacup of onion, a 
teaspoonful of Cayenne ; boil slowly half the day ; stir often ;

then through a sieve. To two quarts of this pulp, add one quart 
of vinegar, two or three garlic buttons minced fine, a small onion 
cut up, one tablespoonful of salt, one of cloves, the same of all- 
spice. Boil one hour ; if too thick, add more vinegar. The red 
pods make a beautiful red catsup. 



443. Imitation Worcester Sauce. — One gallon of ripe toma- 
toes washed and cut up. Pour over three quarts of water ; let it 
boil down half. Stir occasionally to prevent the torm.toes from 
sticking. (A double vessel is valuable in preparing these sauces.)

them lie three hours. Pound them in a mortar; repeat this for 
two days, stirring them well. Pour them into an unglazed jar; 
to each quart add an ounce and a half of black pepper, and an 
ounce of red pepper. Cover the jar close; set it in an oven in 
water; make the water boil two hours steadily. Strain through 
a sieve, without squeezing. Put it in a stew-pan; boil gently 
half an hour; strain again. Put it in a jar to settle, adding a 
tablespoonful of brandy to each pint of catsup. Rinse half pint 
bottles with brandy before bottling. It is best to keep it in small 
quantities. It must be well cooked and sealed, and kept in a cool, 
dry place Examine it from time to time, by placing a strong 
light behind the neck of the bottle. Should any dross appear, 
boil again. A tablespoonful of this will impregnate a tumblerful 
of sauce. After the juice is strained, dry the mushrooms, and 
make powder. Just before the boiling is finished, great care is 
necessary to prevent the catsup from burning. A double kettle 
is a very suitable vessel in which to boil these catsups. 



446. Walnut Catsup. —Take the walnuts when a pin will pass 
through them; pound :hem slightly. Put in an unglazed jar a 
layer of walnuts, and a slight sprinkling of salt; repeat until th«

STORE BATJCEb 2flH 

pods of green or red pepper (make of both kirds %epar;itcly). 
Set the bottles in an oven in water ; make the water boil. Whei 
the peppers are thoroughly hot, pour in good vinegar to fill the 
bottle; cork tight. In the centre of the cork insert a goose quill 
or reed three inches long, open at both ends ; through this the 
r.iiegar may be poured when using it. Stop with a good oork 
*hon not in use. 



457. To Prepare Mustard for the Casters. — Make a smooth 
tu*te of one heaped tablespoonful of mustard flour, half a tea- 
•l^oonful of fine salt, the same of loaf sugar, three tablespoonfuls 
ol water or sweet cream. Only make sufficient to last two days. 
Aj other way is : Use vinegar in place of the cream. Celery or 
horseradish vinegar answers the purpose well. If the vinegar is 
too strong, dilute it. 

458. Mustard that will Keep Good a Month. — Dissolve three 
ounces of salt in a quart of hot vinegar; pour the vinegar hor. 
upon a teacup of horseradish. Cover it closely ; let it stand a day 
and night. Make a smooth paste of this vinegar, and good 
flour of mustard, beating it well; put it in a wide mouthed glass 
bottle ; cork tight. In addition to these catsup*: sauces, and 
vinegars, the store-room should be supplied with caviare for 
fish, which is made of the roe of sturgeon, Worcester sauce, 
Tarragon vinegar, French mustard, etc., etc. Having a good 
variety of these, it will always be easy to give a different flavcr 
ing tc soups and sauces. 



459. Brandy (Good French) aad Wine — Should be kept foi 
cukes, etc. Steep spices in it ten days; strain and bottle; use 
'-hrec ounces of any kind of spice to a quart of wine or brandy; 
slightly bruise the spice. Steep the different kinds of spices 
eeparately. At the end of ten days, strain and bottle; cork 
tight; label each bottle. This is a neat and convenient way of 
usin^, spices for seasoning. The tincture of lemon is made bj

putting the yellow part of the lemcn peel into brandy or wini 
until it is strongly impregnated with the lemon flavor. Grate 
off the outside of the lemon upon lumps of leaf sugar; pack in a 
glass jar, and use in cakes and desserts. 



460. To Keep Lemon Juice. — To every pint of juic*5 (sever 
lemons will generally make a pint — roll well before squeezing) 
put a pound of double-refined sugar ; stir until dissolved ; bottle 
it in small bottles ; pour over the top of the juice, after it is bot- 
tled, a teaspoonful of olive oil. When wanted for use, apply a 
f iece of cotton until it absorbs the oil. 



461. Chicken Salad. — For a pound of chicken, after it is 
minced, use six eggs ; boil them hard ; separate the yolks and 
whites ; mash the yolks to a smooth paste with the back of a 
wooden spoon ; add half a tumbler of good sweet olive oil (or 
rather more melted butter), half a tumbler of vinegar (celery 
vinegar is best), two even tablespoonfuls of dry mustard flour, a 
tablespoonful of loaf sugar (dissolved in the vinegar), a teaspoon- 
ful each of pepper and salt ; wet the mustard to a paste ; stir all 
these together. Mince a third as much white lettuce, cabbage, or 
celery as meat ; mix well with the meat, tossing them together 
with a wooden or silver fork ; add the sauce just before serving. 
Garnish with sprigs of green parsley and the whites of the eggs cu* 
into rings. Salad is very pretty served within potato or rioe 
\* alls ornamented tastily. 



462. Lobster Salad. — Boil a hen lobster. When done, remote 
Mie meat from the shell ; mince it ; rub the coral to a smooth 
paste with a tablespoonful of olive oil or melted butter ; add the 
grated yolks of three hard-boiled eggs, one teaspoonful of mus- 
tard, salt and pepper to taste, and a wineglass of go r »d cider vinegar. 
Mix the sauce well with the meat; add a thin? as much -white 
lettuce or celery, cut up fine just before serving. Salmon salad 
may bo made in iho same way. Garnish with lemon slicer' and 



STORE SAUCRS. 2W 

green parsley or celery. Make salmon salad with the *am« 
seasoning. 



463. Meat Jelly. — To make a quart of this jelly : Molt it, and 
leason with two lemons cut in slices, remove the seed ; a lea- 
ipoonful of black pepper, bruised slightly ; a blade of mace, stick 
if cinnamon, one onion, a sprig of parsley, thyme, sw<>et ba«il 
salt to taste, two tablespoonfuls of celery vinegar, the whites of 
five eggs beaten to a froth. Let it stew gently, without stirring 
until the jelly looks clear; strain once or twice through a jelly- 
bag. Set a turkey, birds, fish, etc., intended for a party-supper, 
under this -while being dripped. Let the jelly be thick enough 
upon the article to form a thin veil ; color with cochineal a flesh 
or pinkish color; sea green, for fish, may be colored with spinach 
juice, or juice from beet tops. This jelly is also excellent ii? 
Christmas meat pies, salmagundi, etc., intended to be kept 
several days; it not only seasons them finely, but keeps the 
meat moist. It is highly ornamental as a garnish for cold meats. 



464. To Bone a Turkey. — Clean the turkey ; remove the in 
testines ; cut off the first joints of the legs ; cut down the back- 
bone ; very carefully raise the meat from the backbone r on each 
side; unjoint the wings, leaving the small part of the wing bone; 
raise the meat carefully from the breast, using a sharp knife with 
a narrow blade. The meat being now detached from the bones, 
and those unjointed, draw out the frame; only the merrythought 
will remain, which can be easily cut out. Break up the bones ; 
put them in a stew-pan ; cover them with cold water, and stew 
while the turkey is being stufled with a rich fcrce-meat. First 
•tw up the slit and any' holes that may have been accidentally 
made, making the stitches on the inner side. The force-meat may 
be of well-seasoned sausage meat, or veal minced fine, and sea 
toned with spices to taste, or with mace only, or use sweet herbs. 
After it is stufTed, so as to Iook as before *he bones were re- 
moved, put it in a large stew-pan, that will just hold it without 



210 MRS. niLl's NEW COOK BOOK. 

cramping ; strain over the gravy from the bones. If this does not 
cover the fowl, add warm water; add any vegetable or sweet 
herbs liked, several slices of cold boiled bacon, and a few slices of 
veal. It will require from an hour and a half to two hours gentle 
•teeing. Let it cool in the liquor; take up the fowl; scrape ofl 
8m gravy ; melt and strain the gravy. Season it to taste, if no 
already sufficiently seasoned; boil it down to a jelly. Strain 
o* er the fowl, or serve around it, upon the dish. 



405. To Make Tough Meat Tender. — If an old fowl, as soon as 
it is killed immerse it with the feathers on in a jar of weak ley ; 
let it remain twelve hours. For steak and younger poultry, rub 
over the steak and the inside of the fowl, saleratus or soda. To 
stew immediately after killing, cook before the animal heat iff 
extinct. 



46(5. To Keep Eggs during the Winter. — Brush them over 
with oil ; pack them in boxes of dry charcoal ; turn the small end 
down. 

Another way : Oil them ; pack in boxes, and turn each egg 
twice a week. If the eggs are kept in one position, the yolk will 
in a short time settle upon the shell, and spoil. Hens understand 
this, and turn over the eggs upon which they set daily. 

Another way : Bore auger holes large enough to hold the eggs 
In poplar plack (pine will not answer, it gives a bad taste to the 
eggs), or any kind of seasoned plank that will not impart the 
peculiar taste of the plank ; make shelves of this plank in a d ry 
place; brush the eggs over with oil; set them with the small end 
down in these auger holes. In very cold weather, cover them 
with a double blanket. They may for some purposes be scalded 
in boiling water, and packed in salt, charcoal, or bran, and turned 
frequently — or keep them in strong brine. 

467. Rue Flour Cement. — Mix the flour (as much as is needed) 
with cold water; pour into boiling water; let it simmer until a 
transparent paste is formed. When cold use it. 



8T0RB SAUCES. 211 

4G8. Waterproof Cement. — To a tumbler of sweet milk, put 
»s much good vinegar; scald it until it curdles; strain the whey 
from the curds, and mix the whey with the whites of five eggs; 
beat them well together; add quicklime, sifted through a sieve, 
until the mixture is of the consistence of thick paste. With thii 
broken cracks in vessels of all kinds can be mended. It resist* 
the action of fire and water. 



4G9. To Render Water Soft for Washing.— Where there u 
lime in the water, this method of preparing water for washing 
will be found useful : Stir a pint of fresh slacked lime to a gallon 
of water; let it settle; pour it off from the sediment carefully, 
and immediately bottle, and cork it tight. Add a tumblerful ol 
this lime water to the hard water; stir it well together; let the 
sediments settle ; then pour off the water through a Canton flan- 
nel cloth. 



469£. To cure Cholera in Poultry. — Boil well a mush of 
wheat-flour ; add to one pint, when coc 1, a t ablespoonful of ker- 
osene ; shut the fowls up ard confine them to this food ex/ta- 
lively until relieved. 



YEAST AND BREAD. 

'■ Wr.Ekz s«nuld have the first place on our table, and in all dU 
fmsMons of dietetics and cookery. * It is the staff of life,' th« 
main reliance of the muscle and bone. * That person who habit 
uall y eats good bread,' says a distinguished physician, ' ough; 
never to complain much of indigestion, for poor bread is one of 
the principal causes of dyspepsia.' If it be true, and I presume 
no reflecting mind doubts it, that 'the highest success in life finds 
its only sure basis in physical vigor, and that this physical vigoi 
depends mainly upon the quality of food thrown daily into that 
great human laboratory, the stomach — is it not a matter of para 
mount importance that every article of food, especially bread, bo 
so prepared as that it may fulfil completely its functions in the sys 
tern V The author of Hints upon Cookery says truly " a culinary 
reform is demanded," and very gracefully concludes by invoking 
the aid of each mistress of a family to closely superintend, and, to 
some extent, even assist in the preparation of meals, at least until 
our cooks shall have become better instructed and more skilful than 
at present. What he says of his fair readers, may, I hope, with 
with equal propriety be said of mine, that " they are not among 
those who are ashamed to know how to make a loaf of bread or to 
stir a batch of biscuit with their own hands. Even the kilcher 
is a [dace of dignity and hor.or in their presence when love sano 
alios the baking aud boiling." Four things are requisite to hav« 
gortl bread, viz. good flour, good yeast, good baking, and thai 
the dough should be well kneaded. 



470. To Make Hop Yeast. — Put a handful of hops into a stew. 
pan; peel and slice two large Irish potatoes; add them to th« 
hops ; pour over them two quarts of water, and boil until th# 
potatoes are soil. Make in an earthen bowl a smooth paste of 



YEAST AND BREAD. 213 

% pint of fl( ur and cold water. Strain the ho} tea ipon the paste, 
S'.ir it well ; wash the stew-pan, and pour the Latter into it. 
Simmer ten minutes, and pour back into the bowl, and \n hen 
lukewarm, add a teacup of brown sugar or n: If as much syrup, 
% tumblerful of good yeast, and set it to rise where it will be 
* arm, and kept of a uniform temperature. When well risen 
ruake up part of it into leaven. This is done by sifting corn 
meal, and pouring in liquid yeast to make a rather stiff dough. 
Work it well; roll into a long piece as thick as a man's wrist, 
and cut with a knife into thin cakes. Sprinkle a large dish 
thickly with flour; lay the cakes on, meeting but not touching; 
6et them in a dry, warm place, where the wind will blow freely 
upon them. In winter they may be dried in the sun. Turn 
thorn several times each day, and when nearly dry, roll them to a 
powder with the rolling-pin. Expose them to the air till quite 
dry, and pack in a jar with a tightly-fitting cover. Two table 
spoonfuls will be sufficient for a quart of flour. Dissolve the 
leaven in a tumblerful of tepid water or milk (water is best in 
summer, milk in winter). Keep the leaven in a dry place, well 
protected from the air. It is well to have a good supply of this 
always on hand. For immediate use, put part of the yeast into 
a wide-mouthed glass bottle; stop loosely until fermentation 
ceases, then stop well, and in winter keep in a warm place. It is 
common error with cooks to overheat bread and yeast. A 
uniform blood heat is necessary to success in bread making. 
Change the vessel in which the yeast is kept ; wash it with hot 
water in which a teas|Oonful of soda to a quart has been dis- 
solved. Sun it half an hour. In this way the vessel may be 
ktpt sweet and clean. Peach leaves will answer for this yeast 
%& well as hops ; a handful of leaves to a quart of water. 



4*3 1. Irish Potato Yeast. — At twelve o'clock in the day, mash 
very smooth a boiled Irish potato ; mix with it a tablespoonful 
of liquid yeast or a teaspoonful of the powdered leaven ; if n«cc* 
wiry, use a little water. Mix this well with the potato in a soup 



214 mrs. hill's new cook book. 

plate; turn a plate over it; set in a warm place if the weather it 
cold. At night make up the breakfast bread with this piepara 
tion, leaving a tablespoonful to start the yeast again, [f for tea, 
make the yeast after breakfast. When the yeast is good it will 
increase somewhat in bulk and crack open over the top. This ii 
simple and excellent receipt. 



472. To Make Bread with Irish Potato Yeast. — Sift one quart 
of flour ; rub into the flour a piece of lard as large as a hen's egg ; 
add a teaspoonful of salt. Beat one egg in a bowl with two 
level tablespoon fuls of sugar ; then add two heaped tablespoon* 
fuls of potato yeast. Beat a little, and pour the mixture into the 
flour; add a tumbler of tepid water; knead the dough well. 
Grease a tin bucket ; put in the dough, greasing it slightly on the 
top. Cover, and set it to rise. When risen, make into rolls, 
placing them so as to touch in the pan they are to be baked in. 
Cover, and when risen near the top of the pan, bake quickly. If 
the weather is very warm, make up the bread between eleven 
and twelve o'clock. It will be ready to make into rolls between 
three and four o'clock. This makes delicious bread. 



473. Sweet Potato Yeast. — Bake or roast sweet potatoes 
(white Bermudas are best) enough to make a pint of potatoes 
after being rubbed through the colander. Pour over this a pint 
of boiling water, a pint of cold water, a teacup of good hop yeast, 
or half a cup of leaven ; mix well together. Pour it in a wide- 
mouthed jar; stop lightly till it rises. Keep in a moderately 
warm place in winter, and a cool place in surrmer. The bread 
may be made up entirely with this yeast, always reserving a cup* 
ful to start the yeast. Make it fresh every twe or three days. 
Irish potato yeast may be made in the same way. 



474. Milk Yeast. — Early in the morning put into a stew-cup, 
lined with porcelain or tin, two teacups of fresh milk ; let it boil up 
once, and then pour in a teacup of cold water; stir in the milk 



YKA8T AND BREAD. 21fk 

one teacup of corn meal, and flour enough to mane a smooth 
batter, about the consistence of fritter batter; add a tca«poonfuJ 
of salt. Set the mixture in the sun, if a bright summer day, or 
where it will keep of a regular tepid heat till risen. As soon ai 
t'je |east rises, make up the dough with it entirely. Put th« 
bread in the oven or pan in which it is to be baked ; keep it 
Eruderately warm; bake as soon as it rises sufficiently. Bread 
made of this yeast is very good, but does not keep well. A pint 
of yeast will wet two quarts of flour. A little warm watei 
loured in to rinse the vessel in which the yeast was, may be used 
if necessary in wetting up the bread. Use a piece of lard the 
•ize of a hen's egg to each quart of flour. When the bread is 
done, take it out of the pan and set it upon one end. After re- 
maining in this position a quarter of an hour, turn it, and nevei 
let it r»et flat on anything, until cold, as the under part will absorb 
the dampness or sweat, if there should be a hard crust in eon 
sequence of baking too fast on the top, upon removing the bread 
from the oven wrap it in a damp cloth, and set it up. 



475. A Good, Simple Yeast. — One tablespoonful of brown 
pugar, two of flour, three of water ; a tablespoonful of good hop 
yeast; beat them well together. Make at least twelve hours be- 
fore using it. A wine-glass of this will be sufficient for a quart 
of liour. It may be kept up by adding water, sugar, and flour ua 
fct firat. Occasionally change the vessel. 



476. Magic, or Cold Yeast. — This yeast is superior to any I 
have ever used, in warm or even moderately warm weather. 
Is more reliable, and less troublesome. I confidently recommend 
It after long experience in its use. Take one cup of fresh sweet 
milk, one of cold water, two tablespoonfuls of nice sugar, and a 
pint and a half of flour ; make it in a covered jar or mug, and 



216 MBS. HILLS NEW COOK ROOK. 

the (hird, add two more tab.espoonfuls (even full) )f sugar and 
ts\o ceaspoonfuls of salt ; set it away as at first until 11 o'clock. 
MaKe up rolls, or any kind of bread liked; bake when light; 
aaless tea is very early, the bread may be made still later, and 
Sist put down in a lump, and when this rises mould it, and bake 
it the second rising. To continue the yea^t from day to day, 
when the batch of dough is made at eleven, stir the yeast well 
before pouring it into the flour; reserve a teacup until next 
morning ; then add to it a teacup of water, a tablespoonful of 
Bugar, and flour enough for a batter of the consistence of that 
first made. It will be ready at the time it is needed. If 
more is required, use more water — the milk is only used in 
starting the yeast. Change the vessel every two days. If the 
yeast becomes a little sour, stir in half a teaspoonful of soda; 
should it look brisk and lively after the soda is stirred in, the 
yeast is good ; if not, discard it, and make fresh yeast. In very 
cold weather the yeast and dough must be put on the hearth, 
though not very near the fire. This yeast requires so little time 
to raise bread, that for breakfast I set a sponge at nine o'clock at 
night, and make the bread early in the morning. A sponge is 
?et in this way : Take a tumblerful of sweet milk or cold water 
oue of the magic yeast, pour them (well stirred) into a small jar 
beat in flour enough to make a smooth batter, not very thick ; 
remove the spoon, sprinkle flour over the top of the batter 
cover it well, and if the weather is warm, put it in a cool place. 
Early in the morning, taste the batter; if at all acid, stir in a 
little soda; make into dough, either for Sally Lunn, French rolls, 
or in any way preferred, adding a small piece of lard, or buttei, 
and an egg if liked ; mould the dough ; let it set until it rises ; 
bake in a rather quick oven. The dough must be well workea 
at first until it blisters, pulling it to pieces, and w rking in the 
flour slowly, and until the dough is a little stiff. 1 "ever add a 
particle of flour when working bread the second time (deem- 
ing it unwise to throw in fresh material after fermentation hat 
oomnifc,*ced), and only handle it enough to mould. 



TEA8T AND BREAD, 217 

477. To Set a Sponge for Light Rolls with Yeast that ltt~ 
quires to be Kept Warm. — Into a pint of tepid water, or fresh 
sweet milk, beat as much sifted flour as will make a stiff batter; 
•dd a tumblerful of lively, brisk yeast; stir all well ; sprinkle 
flc ur on the surface of the batter; cover well, and set it to rise. 
V\ hen the sponge rises so as to make cracks through the flour, 
•p .-inkle over it a teaspoonful of salt; beat into the sponge a' 
tumbler of tej id water ; in another vessel beat up two eggs well ; 
pour part of the sponge to the eggs until a smooth batter is 
formed (a tablespoonful of sugar may be used if liked) ; then stir 
the egg into the remainder of the sponge; beat all well together. 
Sift two quarts of flour; rub in well one tablespoonful of lard, 
the same of butter ; make a hole in the middle of the flour ; pour 
in the yeast; work the flour in gradually; knead the dough well, 
cew persons are aware how much the grain of the bread is im- 
proved by being well worked. Never wet up all the flour at 
once ; reserve a third to work in ; sprinkle the flour on the board ; 
work it in the dough well. Pull the dough to pieces ; turn it in- 
side out; work again; each time sprinkling the flour upon the 
board until it is all worked in, and the dough looks light and 
spongy. Grease a pan ; mould the dough either in long, round, 
or twisted rolls ; lay them in the pan, so that they will touch ; let 
them rise. If the sponge is good it will not require over half an 
hour to raise the dough after it is moulded. Bake iu rather a 
quick oven. Should the oven or stove be too hot, lay over the 
bread a sheet of paper; should a hard crust form, the bread will 
not be light. When a sponge is set, the dough should only rise 
wot ; when made without a sponge, it nrist rise first undivided, 
th:?n moulded, and set to rise the second time. Every kitchen 
ii >uld be supplied with a smooth popiar or marble board, upon 
*1 iuh the bread should be worked, first mixing in a tray until 
th > dough is cleared from the hands; then flour the board well, 
an 1 work as directed. It requires some experience to know when 
to uork the dough the second time, for if allowed to rise too long 
it will lose its sweetness, without always becoming sour. When, 



218 MR8. ITILI'S NEW OOOK DOOR. 

unfortunately, the dough is permitted to remain until sour, pull 
it open, dissolve half a teaspoonful of soda for a quart of flour, ir 
a wineglass not quite full of warm water* pour over, and work 
in well. 



478. To Know when the Oven or Stove is Hot Enough /» 
Baking. — Sprinkle in a little flour; A it turns slowly a good 
brown color, the oven is right; if it burns immediately, it is too 
hot. Leave the door of the stove open a few minutes to allow it; 
to cool. It will be right when you can hold your hand in to 
count twenty. But this is not a reliable rule, since somepersoni 
endure heat better than others. Baking may be done in the stove, 
in a brick or iron oven ; if a brick oven is used, kindle the fire 
when the dough is put to rise ; by the time the bread has risen, 
the oven will be ready; when the oven is hot enough, clean it out, 
and give the dust a few moments to settle before putting the 
bread in. When an iron oven is used, set the bottom side up 
before the fire until well warmed ; in putting coals under, mash 
the larger ones with the back of the shovel, that all may be of 
the same size ; where one or two larger coals than the rest are 
left under the oven, cake or bread is very apt to bake with large 
holes, or as cooks express it, " blow up " in holes. At first the; 
heat should be strongest at the bottom of the oven ; put the ovei 
lid on cold, or slightly warm ; cover it with hot embers ; heal 
gradually. Baking can only be learned by experience. It is a 
good plan to heat the flour very hot before making it up. After 
silling, I always place the flour well spread in the sun, or befort 
the fire, taking care it does not scorch. 



479. French Rolls. — One quart of flour, one or two eggs beateB 
Vith an even tablespoonful of sugar; dissolve a yeast cake, or. if 
Che leaven is pulverized, two tablespoon fills in a tumbler of tepid 
water; stir this well, and pour it to the eggs. Sift the flour into 
the tray ; reserve a thrrd of it to work into the dough after the 
flour is wet up. Into the remainder of the floui sprinkle a tea 



1CA8T AND BREAD. 2)9 

•poonful of salt, and rub in well a heaping tablcspoonful of buttei 
or lard; pour the yeast in, and stir the flour in gradually. 
When the dough can be rubbed from the hands, flour the board 
zr bottom of the tray, and begin to work the dough upon it ; 
sprinkle down more flour; pp.11 the dough to pieces; repeat thu 
intil all the reserved flour is in ; continue to work the dough 
mlil it feels light and spongy tc the touch. The dough foi light 
rolls should be softer than for loaf bread. Grease the pan ia 
which tfie bread will be put to rise ; lay the dough in ; press it 
down with the hand until it covers the bottom; lightly touch it 
over with lard, to prevent a crust from forming. Throw a clean 
towel over. Set it to rise where it will be kept moderately 
warm. When it has risen, immediately take it from the pan, and 
roll it in a round strip ; pull it into pieces of uniform size (and 
never very large) ; mould them into long or round shapes ; grease 
Jie pan slightly in which they are to be baked ; lay the rolls in, 
touching. Let them rise again, which should be in half an hour; 
bake in a quick oven, not hot enough, however, to blister or burn. 



480. Secession Biscuit. — These are made precisely the same aa 
light rolls, only moulded differently. After the second rising, 
grease the bottom of the oven or pan in which they are to be 
baked; work each piece of dough separately, and make them as 
common soda biscuit are shaped; lay them in the oven or pan; 
they should not touch. Let them rise fifteen or twenty minutes, 
bake in a quick oven. They are not so good when permitted to 
itaud any length of time. 



481 . Potato Bread. — Rub half a dozen Irish potatoes, peeled, 
.through a coarse sieve; mix them thoroughly with twice the 
quantity of flonr ; add me Qgg t a tablcspoonful of butter, a tcaspcou- 
ful of salt, a tumbler of tepid water or fresh sweet mi.lr. in which 
has been dissolved a tablcspoonful of 'eaven ; make a smooth dough ; 
irfter being well risen, mould iuto loa/es or lo*ig rolls; let ther ^n$ 
%jakr bake in a rather quick oven. This I read keeps woT

482. Sally Lunn, J\ r r I. — Into one quart of sifted flour rub t 
large heaped tablespoonful of butter, or half butter and laia, a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Into a pint bowl break two eggs ; beat them 
teveral minutes ; pour to them a teacup of good yeast. Make • 
bole in the middle of the flour (reserve a tumbler of the Aran 
before rubbing in the shortening) ; pour in the yeast and egg 
After stirring them together well, work the flour in unt'l a soft 
dough is formed ; sprinkle the board ; work the dough well until 
the reserved flour is all in, pulling the dough to pieces. 
When more wetting is needed in first making the dough, use 
tepid sweet milk in winter, water in summer. When the work- 
ing is finished, the dough should be rather soft. Let this rise in 
a lump. Divide the dough in four equal pieces ; roll the same 
*ize. Grease two shallow pans ; on the bottom of each lay a 
piece of the dough ; spread over the surface a thin coat of lard. 
Lay over the remaining pieces of exactly the same size and 
thickness. Care should be taken to make them fit well. Fold 
the dough as it is lifted from the board ; lay half on first, then 
.he other half; throw over a clean towel ; set the pans where the 
dough will keep at an even temperate warmth. When riseu, 
bake in a quick oven. Take them from the pans ; shake gently 
the pieces apart; butter the bottom piece well by laying over 
slices of fresh butter; replace the top pieces; cut in slices; serve 
warm. The slices should not be removed when put upon the 
vable. but cut for convenience of serving. 



488. Sally Lunn, No. 2. — Take a small tumbler of new milk 
trd boil it. When cool, add to it two eggs well beaten, a cake of 
leaven (dissolve this in the milk), and flour enough to make a 
«ti!f baiter. Make it up at nine o'clock at night; next morning 
ptir in a tablespoonful of meited butter; grease a mculd ; pour in

484. Sally Lvnn No. 3. — One qua- t of fining three °gg3, ore 
tablespoonful of butter ; add half a cup of good yeast. Mix a' 
ten o'clock a. m., for tea, as soft as you can w»th the hands. 



485. Receipt for Split Rolls. — One egg, one tablespoonful 
ugar well beaten together, and one yeast cake dissolved in t 
of warm milk; add flour to make a stiff batter. Set to rise a 
ten o'clock in winter and twelve in summer ; then work a hoapii ^ 
tablespoonful of butter in flour enough to make up the yeast ; roll 
out the dough an inch thick, and spread butter on it; fold it in 
half, and cut any shape you fancy. Let them rise in the pan in 
which they are to be baked. Bake quick. Take a piece of thi? 
dough, roll it thin, cut in any shape liked, fry, and serve imme- 
diately. (Excellent. ) 



486. Sally Latin without Yeast. — One quart of flour, one tea- 
cup of butter — lard will answer — salt to taste. Two eggn beateu 
separately, one pint of sweet milk. Melt the butter, stir well to 
the yolks, then the whites beaten, alternately flour and milk. 
Two heaped teaspoonfuls of yeast powder. Grease a pan, bake, 
and serve immediately. 



487. Bread without Yeast. — Take so much milk or warm 
water as will wet up the flour you wish to use. Salt rather more 
than is used for common bread. Stir in flour to make a past e 
about as thick as griddle-cake dough. Put this paste in a tin 
bucket, and set in a pot of warm water near the hearth or stow 
where the water will keep about milk warm. Thi3 will give the 
paste an even temperature. Ir. four or five hours this well rise, and 
foam like yeast. Pour it into your tray, and work in floai 
enough to make bread. Put in the pans they are to be baked in, 
»nd set them in a warm place. Cover with paper or cicth, and 
let them rise ; when risen, rake in a quick oven. 



4 47£. Yeast Powder. — Take one pound of cream y( tartar, 
half pound of soda, the same of crushed sugar, and half pound ol 
flour ; sifti inese we'J together ; put in an air-tight vessel. Use 
two teaspoonfuls to one quart of flour.

488. Polato Biscuit. — Boil tw,> good-sized Irish pctatoei , jiee 
and mash them fine; one tablespoonful of sugar, a UmLtsiful 
of boiling water. When wpid, add a teacup of good yeast ; let 
It rise until light, then add another tumblerful of warm water, 
with flour enough to make a soft dough ; work it well ana uiaks 
4nto biscuit ; put them in a pan not very deep, and do not press 
fcheni too close together ; spread over a towel, and when suffi- 
ciently light, bake tjuick and serve immediately. 



489. Light Bread. — To three pints of sifted flour, pour one 
pint of tepid milk or water and a tumbler of good yeast. Beat 
well and set it to rise in a moderately warm place ; make this at 
light. In the morning, stir to the sponge a pint of warm water 
and two teaspoonfuls of salt; work in as much flour as will make 
a rather stiff dough. Work it well ; mould it into loaves ; let it 
rise ; bake in a moderately quick oven. Use, when cold, for 
dinner-bread. It makes good toast when stale. 



490. Crumpets. — One quart of sifted flour, one large tumbler of 
sweet milk (warm the milk); beat in a bowl two eggs; stir tc 
them one small-sized teacup of good yeast. Make a stiff* batter 
of the flour, eggs, and milk, beating all well together. Sprinkle 
jver the top a slight coat :>f flour; leave the vessel (covered) 
where the batter will rise. Grease and heat the batter-cake grid 
die; pour on a large tablespoonful; bake rather slowly; when 
I>>ne on one side, turn. Butter and send to the table hot. Very 
few cooks manage the buttering well. They either put on enough 
t*> render the cakes disgustingly rich, or butter unequally, or put 
the butter in a tin vessel, place it on the stove or fire until it turns 
tc oil, and then pour it profusely over the cakes. In but'ering, as 
the cakes are removed one by one, lay over each very tnin slices 
of cold butter. It should be done on the gridiron, piling them a 
*hey are buttered ; immediately transfer them tc a hot plate, and 
serve. The taste of oiled butter is very disagreeable, and should 
never be used for cakes or waffles. If it is preferred to have tht

milk, and flour enough to make a stiff batter; let it rise. 
Just as you are ready to fry them on the griddle, if at all sour, 
strew over the surface a teaspoonful of soda finely pulverized ; 
beat it in, and fry immediately. In all the receipts given for 
crumpets, flannel cakes, etc., the cold yeast may be used unless the 
the weather is very cold. Very excellent cakes may be made by 
taking a teacup of dough from the breakfast-bread. Rub the 
dough to a batter with milk ; beat up an egg ; melt and stir to the 
egg a teaspoonful of hard butter ; add flour to make a batter as 
stiff as for flannel cakes ; fry in the same way, or make it a 
little stiffer ; let it rise, and bake in a shallow pan in a quick oven. 
If at all sour, stir in half a teaspoonful of soda just as it is put to 
bake. This batter may be baked in muffin-rings. 



492. Raised Waffles, No. 1. — Make a batter rather stiff, with 
three tumblers of sweet milk, two well-beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of 
salt, as much melted lard as can be dipped up in a tablespoon, 
and a tumbler of good yeast. Beat the flour in gradually until a 
stiffish smooth batter is formed. Set it to rise ; when well risen, 
heat the irons ; grease them slighly ; pour in batter enough to fill 
them, but not to overflow ; put them on a bed of coals ; turn ia 
two or three minutes. Bake on the reverse side in the same way 
Slip the wafHe from the irons on to a warm plate and butter it. Have 
a stew-pan of hot water on the stove ; set the plate over the mouth of 
it until two or three are baked,which should be done as expeditiously 
as possible. Send to the table, and continue to send this number 
antil All the batter is used. This is a much better plan than to

made and eaten fresh, it will soon spoil by standing. 



493. Rice Waffles, No. 2. — Beat together two eggs; a tea 
ipoonful of salt. Into another pan mash smoothly a teacup of 
Warm, well-boiled rice. Stir to this until melted, a Ua«po<>nru1 
of lard ; add alternately a tumbler of sweet milk and flour, tc 
make a batter rather stiff; mix all together well. It requires an 
equal quantity of flour with the rice.

one pint of rice flour, one even teaspoonful of soda sifted in witt 
the flour, and sweet milk to make a thin batter ; salt to taste 
Just before baking, stir in two tcaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, 
previously dissolved in warm water. This is an excellent receipt 
for a batter-bread. Bake in a quick oven in a pan twp or three 
inches deep. Eat hot. 

496. Quick Waffles, No. 5. — One pint of buttermilk, one pint 
rt sifted flour, one egg, one tablespoonful of melted lara, a largt 
teaspoonful of soda. Send them to the table as fast as baked.

use this ; add the soda to the other pan, and fry from that urtil the 
batter is used. Send to the table hot ; they are not good if left 
to stand.

with a toasjuHAJul of salt; beat two eggs well; make a thil 
batter with rye flour, the eggs and milk well stirred together; 
idd a teaspoonfii Jvla. Fry in rather small cakes. Rye and 
oorn meal batten jukes should be made thin; flour cakei 
moderately still*. 



545. Corn Meal Batter Cakes. — One egg, one teaspoonful of 
(ard stirred into a tjfcblespoonful of hot mush, salt to taste, one 
pint of sweet milk, corn meal to make a thin batter, an even tea- 
spoonful of yeast powder (or the yeast powder may be omitted, 
asing another egg) ; beat them well. These batter cakes may be 
made of sour milk and soda, but are not generally considered so 
good. Rice or hominy may be used instead of mush. 



546. Rice Flour Batter Cakes. — Beat three eggs separately; 
make a batter rather stilT, by stirring to the yolks of the eggs 
alternately a large teacup of rice flour and milk. To a tumbler 
of hot rice, or small hominy well boiled, add a heaped dessert- 
spoonful of butter or lard ; stir in the whites of the eggs beater* 
to a stiff froth ; mix well with the yolks. Fry on the griddle. 



547. Rye Bread. — One pint of rye flour, one of good of.rn 
meal, salt to taste, a piece of lard or butter as large as a tfilnut^ 
a teacup of good yeast, milk or water to make a stiff dough 
*i>ik it well ; set it to rise; when well risen, form into loave* 
let it rise again. Bake in a moderately quick oven. 



548. Rye Drop Cakes. — Two eggs well beaten, a pint of rye flour, 
■alt to taste, a teaspoonful of sugar, sweet milk to make a rathe?

thin batter, a teaspoonful of yeast powder stirred in last. Bakt 
in smal. 1 shallow tin pans in a quick oven. Or mix one pint of 
rye flour, one of corn meal, one tablespoonful of syrup ; mix wi'Ji 
milk a teaspoonful of yeast powder; let it remain an houi Lofuit 
baking. 

543. Buttermilk Cakes. — One quart of flour and an evcL teA 
spoonful of soda sifted together, a heaped teaspoonful of salt; rub 
into the flour well a piece of lard or butter the size of a large 
hen's egg ; wet to a rather soft dough with buttermilk ; work 
until the dough is smooth ; roll out an inch thick ; cut, by press- 
ing a saucer on the dough ; cut around with a sharp knife. Who* 
all are cut, prick them with a fork, and bake in a quick oven. 



550. Short Hoe Cakes. — One quart of flour and one teaspoon- 
ful of salt dissolved in a wineglass of water; rub in the flour till 
thoroughly mixed; a large tablespoonful of butter or lard ; pour 
in the salt ; wet up with cold water ; only work the dough enough 
to be smooth ; roll an inch thick or less, and bake. 

Another way : To one pound of flour rub in well three-quar 
ters of a pound of butter and one teaspoonful of salt. Beat the 
yolks of two eggs well ; pour to the eggs half a tumbler of sweet 
milk ; stir them well together; wet up the flour with it to a rather 
soft dough ; use more milk, if necessary. Handle the dough 
lightly, and very little. Roll into round cakes; prick them with 
i fork ; bake in a moderately hot oven. 



551. Johnny Cake. — One pint of boiled rice or hominy, one 
egg, one tablespoonful of butter, salt to taste, flour enough t*j 
mal e a soft dough; roll half an inch thick; bake quick, without 
blistering ; serve hot. Tear the cakes open, and butter. Cut the 
cakes four inches long and three wide. 



552. Corn Meal Johnny Cakes. — Make three tumblers of sifted 
corn meal into a soft dough with one egg well beaten, and mixed 



YEAST AND BREAD. 231 

with a pint of sweet milk ; salt to taste. Spread the di lgb ovei 
a hot griddle. When one side is a light brown, turn it; servt 
hot, sending to the table only one at a time; let others succeed 
rapidly until all are served. 

553. Plain Corn Bread. — Plata corn bread should be mad* 
17th cold water ; the dough stiff, and weli worked with the hand ; 
made into pones ; baked in a hot oven, and not allowed to remain 
in the oven until the crust becomes too hard to be eaten. 



554. Victoria Wafers. — One pint of sweet milk, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, one teaspoonful of butter, flour enough to make a 
very thin batter. The wafer-irons should be very shallow. 

555. Corn Meal Wafers. — Three tablespoonfuls of sifted corn 
meal, one tablespoonful of flour, one of melted lard, salt to taste; 
sweet milk to make a thin batter. Fry a light brown color in 
shallow irons. These must be eaten as soon as fried ; they 
become tough very soon. The irons should always be hot and 
well greased before the batter is put in. 

556. Wafers. — To a quart of sifted flour, rub in three-quar- 
ters of a pound of fresh butter. Dissolve a large teaspoonful of 
salt in a tumbler of cold water ; wet the dough with this. Uso 
aiore water if necessary to make a moderately stiff dough; 
work it very little ; divide into pieces, which, when rolled very 
thin, will just cover the inside of the wafer-irons. Heat th<* irons 
and grease them; liy in the dough; close the irons tightly. 
Should the dough be too large for the irons, trim it ofl* after they 
are closed. Lay on hot embers; turn in two or three minutes 
They should be of a light brown. If properly made and cooked 
are very crisp and nice. 



556J. Souffle Wafers. — Rub into a quart of flour four ounce* 
of butter ; mix with sweet milk ; roll thin ; bake quick. Theae 
may be fried, and are then called pull?. 



238 mre. 

557. Milk Toa.it. — Cut four slices from a stale loaf; plac* 
them in a toaster, or prop them before the fire, turning c v*k 
piece until a light brown color. Have a pan ready with a turn 
blerful of hot sweet milk. Dip each si:**"* in quickly ; la} out 
upon the bottom of a hot dish ; lay over thin slices ( f fresk 
butter, then another piece of toast, until all are arrange! in this 
^ay. Send, under a cover, to table. Toast should be eaten w hen 
fresh made. 

Another way : Toast the slices ; dip them in hot water or milk, 
and pour over a small teacup of melted butter, for three long 
slices. The butter should only be set in boiling water, and re- 
main until melted. It should never be set immediately upon the 
fire. 

Another way: Cut from a round or square loaf of stale bread, 
four slices a quarter of an inch thick. Toast them (using toasting, 
forks) a yellowish brown color ; put them in a hot dish that will 
hold them without dividing. Put in a stew-pan a pint of rich, 
sweet milk, and a quarter of a pound of butter, a teaspoonful of 
salt, a tablespoonful of flour made into a paste, with a little cola 
milk added as the milk in the stew-pan boils up; simmer two 
or three minutes; pour over the toast, and serve immediately. 



558. Queen's Toast. — Toast the bread by the foregoing receipts 
Beat together two eggs; pour to them gradually, and mixing well 
a pint of milk. Have ready half a pound of sweet lard or butter 
boiling; soak the bread until it looks entirely moistened with the 
milk and egg, but not until it is so saturated as to fall to pieces. 
Drop the toast into the boiling lard ; turn the pieces ; very \ttlt 
frying is necessary; serve upon a soft napkin, with cieam ~auoa 
or good syrup. This may be made of very stale bread without 
toasting, merely frying it. 



559. Toast and Cheese. — Butter the bread ; grate chees*», and 
spread thickly upon it ; toast before the fire ; serve hot. 

Another way : Put two ounces of cheese (sliced thin, if soft 



YEAST «N1> CKEAD. 239 

gTated, ll hard), a piece of butter the si/e of a hen's ogg, into a 
#tew-pan or chafing-dish; whip together an egg and * win-glass 
of Madeira. When the cheese and butter melt, stii in the egg 
And wine gradually, mixing it well. Season with popper and 

utmeg, if liked. Spread immediately upon hot toast, and 

erve. 

Another way: Toast the bread on both sides, and butter it; 
toast a slice of cheese on one side; lay that next the bread ; toast 
Iho other side with a salamander or hot oven-lid ; spread over 
French mustard ; serve hot. These preparations must be oaten 
as soon as ready ; if kept, the toast becomes hard ; this may be 
remedied by pouring over a little hot cream and butter sauce. 
Dry toast should not be prepared until the moment it is wanted 



560. To make Stale Bread Taste as if Fresh. — Steam the bread 
not permitting the water to reach it. When thoroughly hot, wrap 
it in a thin cloth, and stand it on the end. A stale loaf tied in a 
cloth and boiled an hour, makes a nice pudding. Use a rich but 
ter sauce. 



561. Pearl Grits. — Oatmeal and cracked wheat should bo 
soaked some time before being cooked. To two tablespoonfuls, 
heaped, of grits a tumblerful of water, added after pouring oflf 
the water it was soaked in. This, when sufficiently boiled, will 
have doubled its bulk and be as much as a very hearty person 
could eat. Salt to taste. 



561 J. To Boil Rice. — Wash through several waters, to wash 
jut the glue, put the rice in boiling water. Boil a quarter of an 
Hour. Pour off in a cullender; pour over cold water, knock 
♦he cullender to .et this run out. Pour over hot water; press a 
/rain between the fingers to test its being done Set in a warm 
|Jace on the stove. Excellent. 

562. Hominy Cakes. — Mash a tumbler of cold hominy witli a 
Vofcapoonfc! of butter ; work in o it the yolk of one egg ; form the 
; roll them In fkrar; fry in plenty of hot laid. Salt U tasve, 



240 MRS. HILLS NEW TOOK BOOK. 

503. Ley Hominy. — To a gallon of shelled c<. rn, add a quar* 
of strong ley. Boil together until the husks begin to come off 
the corn; rub the grains of corn between the hanis, *.c entirely 
remove the huik ; wash it well, and boil in plenty of tfatcr ui "A 
the grains are soft. It requires long boiling. As water m&y :* 
r A>eded, replenish with hot water. Boil in it sufficient salt to 
season. When nearly done, stir it from the bottom to prevent 
its burning. Before using it, mash it slightly with a wooden mal- 
let, and fi y in a small quantity of lard or butter. 



56 3£. Cracked Wheat. — One tablespoonful is sufficient for 
one person ; use as much as may be needed. Soak it in water 
several hours. In cold weather it may be put to soak over night. 
Salt to taste. Boil until soft, stir to prevent burning. Eat 
with cream. 

Oatmeal mush is made in the same way ; the meal must be 
well soaked ; may be eaten with cream, or add butter and eggs. 
The wheat and oatmeal make fine butter cakes, simple, but very 
nutritious. 



563f . Oatmeal Pudding. — One pint of oatmeal, one quart of 
Doiling milk poured over it ; let it stand all night in cool weather. 
Add two well-beaten eggs, sugar to taste, a little salt. Butter a 
basin that will just hold it ; tie over a thick cloth and boil an 
hour and a half. Eat with hard sauce. What remains whon 
cold may be sliced, toasted, and eaten with butter or sauce 



564. Macaroni. — Wash half a pound of macaroni ; boil it -n 
plenty of water until tender ; lay in a shallow earthen dish a 
layer of the macaroni (the pieces should be broken the same 
iize), one of grated cheese, and salt to taste. Lay over slices 
of butter; cover with sweet milk or cream. Bake in a moderate 
oven, ten or fifteen minutes. Serve hot. Another way is, tc 
arrange alternate layers of boiled macaroni and grated chee*a 
Pour over a custard made of three well beaten eggs, two table 



YEAST AND BREAD 24 1 

•poonfuls of stale grated bread, one tablespocrful of bitter, and 
tialf a teacup of cream or sweet milk. Bake half an hour, or 
until the eustarc is set. If boiled too long, it will lose its shape; 
if bakevi too much, it will be dry and tough. It may be boiled 
'orutar put in a shallow dish with alternate layers of chocse 
jo /ere 1 with milk / bread crumbs over this, and over these thin 
dices of butter. Bake until the butter melts and the bread 
crumbs are slightly brown. 



505. Dr. Kitchiner*8 Macaroni Pudding. — Simmer half a 
pound of macaroni in plenty of water (salted to taste) until tendei, 
but not enough to lose its form or make it too soft ; strain the water 
from it ; beat up the yolks of five eggs, the whites of two. Take 
a half pint of good rich cream, a breast of cold fowl, three slices 
of cold ham; mince the meat *ine; grate three tablespoonfuls of 
Parmesan or Cheshire cheese ; season with pepper and salt. Mix 
these with the macaroni. Put all into a buttered pudding-mould , 
set this in a pan of boiling water, and let it steam an hour. A 
double kettle may be used. Serve hot with rich gravy. To 
make the gravy: Two yolks of eggs ; half teaspoonful of salt: 
one lemon cut up, seeds removed ; tablespoonful of butter. Sea- 
son with white pepper. Put it on the fire until the butter melts, 
stirring constantly, or the egg will curdle ; stir to this a tumbler 
of sweet cream, boiling hot. Serve immediately. If sweet milk 
is used instead of cream, melt a teaspoonful of butter in it. This 
makes a nice fish sauce when well seasoned. 



566. To Make Vermicelli. — Thicken three or four eggs with 
flour to a stiff dough; roll it in thin sheets, the thinner the better 
Spread them to dry, turning them. When dry, which may be 
done before the fire or in the sun (it will require at least an hour 
—it is important they should be very dry), roll each piece like a 
scroll, acd shave it in thin slices ; shake these apart. When the 
•©up is nearly done, boil them in it a quarter of an hour. What 



remains, if all is not needed, may be kept two or three days in a 
dry place. 

507. Cheese Stewed. — If the cheese is hard, grate it; if so A, out 
R in thin slices. To a quarter of a pound, add a tumbler of swe^l 
milk, half a teaspoonful of salt, and half a tumbler of fine br^ad 
crumbs. Rub a teaspoonful of mustard flour or French mustard 
into the butter, half a teaspoonful of pepper (white pepper is best) • 
put these ingredients into a stew-pan lined with porcelain or tip ; 
stew until the cheese melts. Beat an egg well, stirring it rapidh 
and thoroughly into the cheese. Let it remain on the fire one 
minute ; pour into a deep dish and serve immediately. Dry 
grated cheese is a pretty supper dish ; shape it in wineglasses • 
turn upon a flat dish. 



568. Welsh Rarebit (called Babbit) to be Prepared on the T<u 
ble. — Cut or grate a tumblerful of good cheese. Put it in a 
chafing-dish ; add a piece of butter the size of a large hen's egg • 
light the lamp to the chafing-dish ; put it in the proper place. 
Stir the cheese and butter together until they have melted ; season 
with salt and pepper. Now stir to the cheese a wineglass of good 
Madeira wine, and one well beaten egg ; mix these to a smooth 
paste. Remove the lamp, and serve. Thin dry toast should be 
served with the cheese. 



560. Eggs. — To boil, should be fresh. If put in tepid water, 
four minuten will set the whites, five minutes will set the yolk, 
tec minutes will boil them hard. When put in boiling water, 
the white hardens too fast for the yolk ; tepid or warm water ii 
Jbest. I have sometimes boiled them in this way : Place the <*gg§ 
in cold water; when the water first begins to bubble, the whites 
will be well set. Fresh-laid eggs require longer boiling thafi 
those ^ little old. Large eggs require more time than those o/ 
less size. 



YKAST AND B1BAD. 2l3 

570. To Scramble Eggs. — Put a teacup of sweet milk into a 
•tew-pan; rub a teaspoonful of flour into a piece of butter the 
size of an egg ; add this to the milk ; salt to taste. Beat 
half a dozen eggs light; stir to the milk. As soon as the 
whites are well set, pour over buttered toast. Serve hot. Th* 
fc«au may be omitted. This is a much more delicate way of cook 
fcg than to scramble them in lard or butter without the milk. 



571. To Poach Eg$s. — Have a pan or skillet half full of boil- 
ing water; break as many fresh eggs into it as will lie side by 
side, they should not touch ; let them remain undisturbed until 
the whites are set well. Take them up when done; trim the 
ragged parts, so as to make the eggs round. Pour ovei each egg 
a teaspoonful of melted butter. In taking them up, use a per- 
forated skimmer. 



572. To Fry Eggs. — Put a piece of lard or butter the size of a 
large walnut in a frying-pan ; put this on the fire. When the 
lard is hot, break the eggs one by one carefully into the lard ; 
sprinkle over salt and pepper. When the eggs are done, 
take them up immediately ; serve with fried ham. When the 
eggs are not perfectly fresh, break each one into a saucer before 
cooking; one bad egg will spoil all the rest. Do not turn them. 



573. To Fricassee Eggs. — Boil them ten minutes, or entirely 
hard. Take them up, and drop them into cold water until the} 
are cool enough to remove the shell. Beat up one raw egg , roll 
the hard boiled first in the raw egg, then in bread crumbs ; lei 
them dry, turning them. Fry in hot lard. Serve as an accom 
paniment to roast or baked meat, with rich gravy. They nay 
becutinhalf; remove the yolk, and fill each end with a ruth 
force-meat; join then >r not, as preferred; roil in raw beater 
then in bread crumbs, and fry. 



i>71 Baked Omelet. — Boil one pint of milk and drop into li 



2 14 M118. HILL'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

oue teaspoonful of butter ; mix to a paste with cold milk a ta 
blespoonful of flour and stir to the boiling milk. Beat eight 
eggs together and pour the milk to them, stirring briskly ; salt 
ard pepper to taste. Butter a fire-proof dish ; pour in the mix 
tare, and bake in a quick oven until a light-brown color ; waioh 
carefully — too much baking will spoil it. Excellent. 



574J. Baked Eggs. — Put a piece of butter in a soup-plate jr 
■hallow fire-proof dish — break in the eggs, season with salt and 
pepper, set in the stove or before a hot fire. As the eggs begin 
to grow hot, stir them. They are very delicate cooked in thia 
way. 



575. Pickled Eggs. — Have ready a quart of good apple vine- 
gar, by scalding in it one dozen cloves, half a nutmeg, a dozen 
grains of allspice, half a teaspoonful of pepper, two teaspoonfuls 
of flour of mustard. Boil a dozen eggs hard ; shell them, and lay 
in a glass jar ; pour over the hot vinegar ; turn them occasionally j 
keep the jar well covered. Serve with pressed or collared meat, 
head-cheese, Hunter's beef, etc. 



576. Omelette. — Break six eggs separately ; beat the whites to 
a stiff froth ; stir the yolks well ; season with one teaspoonful of 
salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, a tablespoonful of parsley 
minced fine. Put into a stew-pan one tumbler of sweek 
in ilk, reserving a wineglassful of the cold milk to wet into a 
paste a tablespoonful of flour. When the milk is boiling hot, 
stii in the paste; let it simmer two minutes; take it from 
the fire; add to it a tablespoonful of butter. When the 
butter dissolves, and the milk is blood warm, stir it to the yolks , 
half a tumbler of grated ham, cold beef tongue, dried giated beef 
or venison, or cheese may be added if liked ; very little minced 
onion may \e used, if the flavor is agreeable. The parsley, 
onion, grated ham, etc., may all be omitted if not liked. Add 
*.he weJl-beaten whites last. Have a small frying-pan ready. 1$ 



TOAST AND BREAD. 245 

thould be well washed, and rubbed very dry ; put in the pan a 
teaspoonful of fresh butter ; set it on a moderate fire ; while the 
butter is heating, beat tc tlie eggs half a teaspoonful of yeasi 
powders. Fry on one side ; hold over the upper side a hot oven 
id or a salamander ; roll the omelette. Serve upon a hot diih. 
They should not be piled. Send two or three to the table a- 
each time of sending. An omelette should be half an inch or 
more thick ; should not be greasy, burnt, or kept upon the fire 
until too hard ; a light brown is the proper color. When it in 
not convenient to use yeast powders, substitute soda and cream 
of tartar — an even teaspoonful of cream of tartar, and a quarter 
of a teaspoonful of soda. It requires two persons to fry the ome- 
lettes and manage the salamander; it should be done very 
expeditiously, as well as carefully. It is not necessary to roll 
them ; some persons prefer it should not be done. 

577. Rice Omelette— Mrs. B.'s Receipt.— One teacup of boiled 
rice, one teacup of sweet milk, three eggs well beaten, a level 
tablespoonrul of butter; season with grated ham, a little minced 
onion, pepper, and salt to taste. Bake a light brown ; much cook 
ing will spoil it. 

578. To Boil Rice. — Pick out all discolored grains ; wash it 
well in two waters; soak an hour before boiling. Twenty 
minutes before serving, stir it slowly into boiling water, pre- 
viously salted. One pint of rice will require four tumblers of 
water. When done, pour immediately into a clean colander, and 
get it upon the coolest part of the stove. Toss ;t up lightly wiih 
a silver or wooden fork. Every grain shemd stand distint*. 
Boil it in an open stew-pan, lined with tin or per "jelain. This it 
the way it should be cooked when eaten with meats. 



578 £. Cheesa Omelet. — Half pound of cheese grated, one cap 
of milk (coffee cup), four eggs beaten separately. Mix the in- 
gredients, and put in an earthen baking-dish ; bake as you would 



446 mrs. hill's new cook book. 

579 Sandwich. — Slice loaf bread or cold biscuit; cutter rri 
tide very thin ; lay upon this thin slices of lean ham, or any kirui of 
fresh meat or poultry ; roll the bread. Serve for tea or leach. 

Another way : Slice the bread very thin ; grate £ quarter of s 
pomb of dry cold ham; mix with a tablespconful of pick If 
raised very fine, a teaspoonful of mustard, half a teaspronfu-1 o! 
per^er, cream, a tablespoonful of butter slightly heaped; ad« 
tf it the ham and seasoning ; mix well, and put a layer betweei 
\ae slices of bread. Anchovies and sardines picked from th» 
bone&, prepared in the same way, are good ; also spiced oysters 
shrimps, eUj. ; they should be minced fine. Grated beef tongue 
makes excellent sandwich. Never use gristle or tough pieces of 
meat. The yolks o r hard-boiled eggs (one to each tablespoonful

PASTRY. 

" Whither rich or poor, young or old, married or singly' 
■ woman is always liable to be called to the performance of everj 
kind of domestic duty, as well as to be placed at the head of a 
family ; and nothing short of a practical knowledge of the details 
of housekeeping can ever make those duties easy, or render her 
competent to direct others in the performance of them. 

"J low indispensable a part of female education is Domestic 
Economy ! How absolutely such knowledge is needed in this 
land of freedom and independence, where riches cannot exempt the 
mistress <>f a family from the difficulty of procuring efficient aid, 
and where perpetual change of domestics renders perpetual in- 
struction and superintendence necessary." 



580. Puff Paste, No. 1. — Never attempt this in warm 
weather unless you are supplied with ice ; then keep the butter 
in ice-water until hard and firm. Mix it in a cool place, a^ far as 
possible from the fire, and use ice-water to wet the flour. Handle 
as little as possible, and, after the dough is formed, put it in a 
pan ; cover it with a towel, and set the pan upon ice. In wintei 
it is less difficult to make. Sift one pound and a quarter of 
flour; reserve the quarter of a pound. Work all the buttermilk 
out of a pound of butter, which divide into tour equal parts 
fiub one-fourth of it into the pound of flour until 't has a gram? 
la'ed look. Wet this into a smooth dough a little stiffish, w.ih 
tumblerful of cold water in which has been dissolved a teaspoon, 
ful of salt. Subdivide the remaining three-fourths of the butter 
*o :is to form six parts. Roll out the dough half an inch thick; 
ttp<»n which place one of the sheets of butter, rolled to just the 
size of the dough; sprinkle this with pait of the reserved flour;

fold twice, and turn so that the points will be to and from you 
.Flour the rolling-pin, and, pressing evenly upon it, roll from yoi 
unt il half an inch thick. Great care is necessa ry to prevent the but 
tcr from bursting through. Repeat this process as many times as 
there are divisions of butter ; and a.? ,he necessary handling wiT 
impart a little warmth to the dough, and as it is important thai 
it should be kept as cool as possible, after each rolling place it up >E 
a dish or pan, and set it upon ice or in a cool place for a quarter 
of an hour at least ; a longer time if the delay will not be incor re 
nient. In two hours use it, cutting off just enough for each ■ ie. 
A plainer crust is better for an under crust, using the puff pj. *te 
only for covering, or to make open tartlets or puffs. Handle as 
little as possible; use, in rolling, only flour enough to prev< nt 
surfaces of the dough from adhering to the pastry-board or r,U 
ing-pin. For a pastry-board, marble is decidedly best ; but v jll 
seasoned poplar will answer. Judgment must be used in wet \ng 
up the dough, as some flour requires more water, some less 



581 . A very Light, Crisp Paste, No. 2. — To a pound of sif ed 
flour allow three-quarters of a pound of butter; reserve a I cm 
blerful of flour to use in rolling. In wetting it up, use the vhite 
of one egg beaten to a stiff froth, and enough water to male it 
intc a stiffish dough. Then manage in all respects as directed in 
the foregoing receipt. Pastry should be made soon in the 
morning. Have everything in readiness before beginning, as the 
work cannot be done too expeditiously. 



582. A Good, Plain Crust, No. 3. — A quart f si fled flour, t 
quarter of a pound of lard, the same of butter, a teaspoonful Ct 
salt; reserve a little of the flour to use in rolling; work the b»itte? 
into the remainder. Dissolve a piece of sal-volatile tlw si?o r,\ % 
large nutmeg in half a tumbler of water; add this to the lour.

589. Risen Paste, No. 10. — Dough, made as for light rotta, 
m/ter it has «•♦*?*> well, makes a good crust for meat pies, and ft »r 
oooniou truit pies and dumplings. 



Pastry should be baked in a quick over ; not, however, hot 
enough to blister oj scorch. Should there be any appearance of 
that, protect it with a sheet of letter paper. 

Never use rancid butter or lard ! 

In summer it is extremely difficult to make good puff paste. 
Plaits, custards, and puddings, are much more easily prepared, 
and make more elegant desserts. 

In baking fruit pies be very careful not to let the juice spill in 
the oven. The burnt syrup imparts a disagreeable taste. It is 
well to elevate the plates a little above the bottom of the stov« 
or oven, tc prevent burning the under crust. 



589 J. Pastry Crust. — One quart of flour, a teaspoonful of salt ; 
with a knife chop into the flour a teacup of lard; wet up 
with very cold water, roll out the dough, handle as little as pos- 
sible. Divide a cup of hard butter into three pieces ; lay, in 
thin slices, a third of the butter over the dough, sift over it a 
•ittle flour ; roll out until all the better is used. Put the dough, 
with a towel over it, in a cool pla3e for half an hour. This i» 
?eipt b> rich enough for e very-day custards and pies. 



PIES. 

51H). Cranberry Pie. — Pick the unscund fruit out rsaitfully 
wash and stew until soft; sweeten to taste. Line pie-f.lates with 
9 good puff paste; fill three-fourths full with the fruit, al way t 
heaping it a little in the middle. Put in net quite a tumblerful of 
the juice ; put over an upper crust, pinching the edges well to- 
gether, and cutting a slit in the middle to allow the steam to 
escape. When done, sprinkle thickly with pulverized loaf sugar, 
and serve with cream sauce, flavored with nutmeg. 



591. Blackberry Pie. — Gather the berries carefully, without 
bruising, as they are better without being washed. Line a pie- 
plate with good crust. Put in a layer of the berries, then one of 
sugar, and dust over with a little flour. (Five tablespoonfuls of 
good brown sugar and an even tablespoonful of flour will bo sufli 
cient for a large pie.) In this way fill the plate nearly full, heap- 
ing the fruit a little in the middle ; add half a tumbler of water, and 
put on the upper crust, pinching the edges together, and cutting a 
»lit in the centre ; serve with cream sauce. This sauce is a good 
accompaniment to all fruit pies. 

Any kind of fruit pies, such as cherries, raspberries, plums, 
etc., are made by the foregoing. A coat of grated or pulverized 
sugar gives a nice finish to the pie. 

5?)2. Apple Pie, No. 1. — Line a deep plate with good crust, 
first greasing the plate slightly. Cut in thin slices ripe, juicy 
apples ; fill the plate, putting in alternately apples, sugar, and 
•pice (a tumbler of brown sugar will season a quart of applet 
of pleasant taste) ; grate over half a nutmeg, the same of cinna- 
mon, the same of coriander seed (if they are liked), half a tumble* 
of water; put Over the upper crust. Bake three quarters of &fi 
Hour, 



252 mrs. ijtll's new COOK book. 

593. Apple Pie, No. 2. — Fill a soup-plate wifn tart applet 
sliced thin; pile the apples up in the middle; put over them a 
crust of good pastry, greasing the edge of the plate sightly to 
prevent the crust sticking; trim the dough off evenly allowing 
size sufficient to cover the apples well. Let it bake until :ht 
crust is a light brown color and the fruit tender. Remove the 
crust carefully, first passing a knife between the plate and crust. 
Invert the crust; season the fruit to taste, and spread it upon the 
crust ; grate nutmeg over. Eat with rich cream or mock-cream 
sauce. 



594. Mock-Apple Pie. — One large grated lemon, three large 
goda crackers, two even tablespoonfuls of butter, two teacups of 
sugar, one egg, a wineglass of water poured over the crackers. 
These will make two pies, baked with two crusts. 



595. Peach Pie. — These may be made like apple pie. There 
is a very popular pie for common, every-day use, called " Cut and 
Come Again." To make it : Line the inside of an oven with 
risen dough or paste made by Receipt No. 4. Fill the oven 
with good, ripe, juicy peaches, sliced thin ; put in a little water; 
cover with a crust, and bake in a moderate oven until the crvist 
is done ; remove the upper crust ; sweeten and spice the fruit ; 
spread it upon the upper crust, and lay the side crust around. 
This is best cold, and may be kept in a cool place for several 
jays. Eat with cream sauce. 



59G. Rhubarb Pie. — Take the tender stalks of the rhubarb j* i e 
cove the skin ; cut the pieces an inch long. Line the pie-plate 
\\ ith paste ; put a layer of rhubarb and a layer of sugar, spric 
kled over thick; continue this until the paste is nearly filled, 
Sprinkle grated lemon peel and p llverized coriander seed between 
each layer for flavoring; a heaped teaspoonful of flour to each 
pie spriL kled between the layers; add half a teacup ol water; 
put on an upper crust, pinch the edges down oarefu. y, and 



pies. * 255 

cut a slit in the centre. Bake slowly an hovr. In all pics where 
there is not sufficient fruit to prevent the crust fron. falling in, 
before placing on the upper crust, cross three stout straws ou tht 
top of the pie-p^te to support the crust. When the pie is done, 
the crust may be loosened with a pen-knife or other small instru 
meat sufficiently to enable you to remove the straws. Tin plates 
ire better than earthen for baking pies. 



597. Sliced Potato Pie. — For baking this, a plate deeper than 
J»e common pie-plate is necessary. Bake medium-sized sweet 
potatoes not quite done ; yams are best. Line the plate witt 
food paste ; slice the potatoes ; place a layer upon the bottom of 
toe plate; over this sprinkle thickly a layer of good browr 
sogar; over this place thin slices of butter, and sprinkle with 
flour, seasoning with spices to the taste. A heaped tablespoonfu. 
of butter and a heaped teaspoonful of flour will be sufficient foi 
one pie. Put on another of potatoes, piled a little in the middle. 
M;X together equal quantities of wine and water, lemon juice and 
wuter, or vinegar and water, and pour in enough to half fill the 
pie; sprinkle over the potato a little flour, and place on the upper 
crust, pinching the edges carefully together. Cut a slit in the 
centre, and bake slowly for one hour. 



fc98. Imitation of Mince Pie. — An excellent imitation of mince 
pie may be made by placing between the layers of potatoes a 
layr of raisins, currants, and chopped apples, seasoning precisely 
ss for a mince pie. 



579. Pie- Melon Pie. — Peel the fruit and cut out all the seed 

\ urt ; cut in slices about a quarter of an inch thick ; scald them. 
I'ut them in a stew-pan, ar.d cover with cc Id water, in which has 
beei. dissolved enough of tartaric acid to make it pleasantly acid, 
Whrn the fruit \» tender, sweeter: it to taste, and bake be* w era 
iwo ^rusU?. A l'ttle grated lenicn peel may ;e added, if liked. 



254 MRS. HILLS NEW COOK BOOK 

600. Mince-Meat Pies. — To prepare the meat : Chop fine tw<! 
pounds of lean, tender beef, cold, boiled, or baked ; remove at 
skin and gristle. (The tongue and heart >f a very young beef 
boiled tender, makes tue lest mince-meat.) Mince fine half a 
pound of suet, one pound of raisins, seeded ; one pound of 
dried currants, washed and picked; half a pound of citron, sliced 
thin , the same of candied orange or lemon peel ; one pound of 
clean, moist brown sugar; the juice of six lemons, the rinds 
grated (throw away the pulp); t.vo nutmegs beaten; one ounce 
of salt, one of ground ginger, the same of coriander seed, pounded 
and sifted ; half an ounce of allspice and cloves each. Mix the 
meat, fruits, and spices well. Pour upon the sugar a pint of 
wine and half a pint of brandy ; add the fruits to the meat ; pour 
over the wine and brandy. When it is well mixed, pack it in 
small jars, and pour over the top of the meat the best syrup an 
inch thick; cover ciosely, and keep the jars in a cool place. 
When ready to make the pies, line pie-plates with a good crust ; 
add to i pint of the mixture a pint of tart apples chopped, a wine- 
glass cf rose-water. Fill the crust half full ; lay over bits of 
butter; put in more meat to nearly fill the plate; cover with 
puff paste ; cut a slit in the middle, and bake. They keep well. 
Warm them before using. I have eaten very good mir.ce piei 
made of the flesh of rabbits. Cold fowls are sometimes used to 
make pies for immediate use. An excellent way to keep the meat 
a few weeks is to spice the meat, pack it away, covering closely 
with syrup, aal add the fruits, wine, and brandy when the pies arc 
made. 

Mince pies without meat may be made of apples, using the 
nnrce meat seasoning. Sweet potatoes, sliced cr grated (half 
done), are good used in the same way. 

Never attempt to keep the meat more than a month or si* 
weeks in this climate. 



G01. Strawberry Short- Cake. — Make a dough by rubbing into 
a quart of sifted flour a tablespoonful of laid, one of butter, a 



pie& 25 B 

teospoojiful of salt. Wet this i.p with butter-milk sweetened 
with soda (this will be about twenty tablespoonfuls of thick but 
termilk, or a little less than a pint), a level teaspoonful of soda 
• — the soda will depend somewhat upon the acidity of the milk. 
Handle the dough very little ; I use a knife almost entirely — 
first to chop in the lard, and then to stir together the flour and 
milk. Have tho board and rolling-pin well floured ; divide the 
dough in half, and rollout the size of a breakfast-plate, half at, 
inch thick, lay one cake in the stove-pan ; put melted butter all 
ovei the top ; lay over the other cake. Bake and then shake 
them apart ; put between them fresh strawberries, slightly stewed 
with sugar, or use the canned fruit. Some like it still richer, and 
butter the bottom cake after it is baked, before using the straw- 
berries. Eat with cream sauce. 



602. Icing or Meringue for Tarts. — A meringue spread upon 
the top of these open pies gives them a very elegant finish. 
Make the meringue in this way : Whip the whites of eggs to a 
stirF froth. To this add, for each egg t a tablespoonful of pulver- 
ized loaf sugar. Whip this in, and flavor with lemon, vanilla, or 
rose-water, or any flavoring preferred. Spread this, with a knife, 
carefully upon the fruit; return the tart to the oven, and let it 
remain until the meringue becomes of a very pale brown coh r. 
The effect is very fine when the meringue and the crust are of the 
game shade. (Should the cook, however, inadvertently allow the 
crust to burn, she need not consider herself obligated oo blacker 
the meringue.) The whites of twe large eggs madf into a mm 
ringue will cover two large tart*. 



PUDDINGS. 

** Method le cftsential to the diepatch of all business ; foi what Lb well arrangod pro 
/•eds with ease and regularity. " 

I have ofte been asked, " What is the difference beU een pud- 
dings and custards, as, in the receipts usually given in Cookery 
Hooks, there seems but little distinction made?" 

My classification is simply this : Puddings are baked without 
crusts and usually in deeper vessels ; are generally served hot 
and eaten with sauces. Custards, on the contrary, are, as a gen- 
eral thing, baked in rich paste, and usually served cold. 

Boiled puddings and custards require no classification. 

All puddings made with soda and sour milk should be bak«d 
in a quick oven. The eggs should be beaten separately ; the flour 
and whites added alternately, putting in at least a third of the floitr 
last, or the whites will float upon the top, and as soon as the pud- 
ding is exposed to the air, will fall. Beat the yolks well ; add a 
little flour and a little salt ; then pour in a small^quantity of milk, 
if it is used ; pour very little milk at once or the batter will be 
lumpy. When half of the flour is used with the milk, stir in the 
whites, beaten to a stiff froth ; then the remainder of the flour, 
and, should any milk remain, stir it in last. Just before baking 
if soda is used, sprinkle it over the top and beat it in quicklv, or 
dissolve it in the last milk added. Batter for puddings should 
always be strained through a hair sieve. No matter how cartful 
iy it is prepared, there will be lumps which can be removed only 
by straining, and w T hich, if allowed to remain, would render thu 
pudding more or less heavy. When fruit is used, it should be 
pn pared the day before it is wanted. Seed the raisins ; wash 
and pick the currants and dry them, so that 'here will be no hin- 
djftnee when the hour for making the pudding arrives. Fruit 



PUDDINGS. 257 

should be floured, or it will sink to the b< ttom. The oven must 
not be quite so hot for a fruit pudding as for one without. Should 
the puddiug brown too fast after it has risen and a crust begin to 
form, lay over it a sheet of letter paper. If the paper is put on 
too soon, the batter will adhere to it, and, in raising the pap( r, tht 
mist will be broken. 

For boiled puddings, follow the directions for mixing baked 
puddings. For a bag, use a square of coarse, thick linen. It 
should be boiled, rinsed well, dried, ironed and put away careful- 
ly as soon as used. Strong tape should be kept for tying. Be- 
fore pouring the batter in, scald the cloth, lay it in a bowl, flour 
it well and evenly ; pour the batter in, gather up the ends carefully, 
allowing room for it to swell (some kinds of batter require more 
room tiian others, corn meal more than wheat flour). Tie secure- 
ly. Put a small piece of dough (made by stirring a little, flour 
and water together) directly over the place where the cloth is tied, 
and tie above the dough with a piece of broad tape, so as to make 
a long loop. Run a flat stick through this loop, strong enough 
to support the weight of the pudding, and long enough to reach 
across the top of the vessel in which it is boiled. Suspend the 
bag in a pot of boiling water so that it will not touch the bottom. 
It must be completely immersed in water and kept so during the 
process. Should the water become too much reduced, replenish 
with boiling water, a kettle of which should be kept for this 
purpose. When the pudding is taken out of the pot, lay it for a 
few minutes in cold water, to disengage it from the cloth. All 
tb.», pans, rolling-pin, board, and strainer, in short, everything to 
be used must be perfectly clean and ready for use, so that no tiina 
k lDst in " running round " looking up things. All material! 
*b >uld be fresh and good. In summer lay the eggs in cold water. 
Always sifl and sun the flour, or heat it before the fire. 



603. Plain Baked Pudding. — One pint of sifted flour, a quart 
of sour milk, and seven eggs. Beat the eggs separately, then stir 
them together; add the flour, and a iittle salt (a quarter of a tea-

flour, the same of sweet milk, five eggs, beaten separately. Mix 
the eggs ; add the flour ; then the milk ; strain it. Butter a deep 
earthen dish; stir rapidly into the batter a teaspoonful of yeast 
powder, and pour into the dish. Bake in a quick oven. Eat 
with a liquid sauce. These puddings should be put to bake when 
the rest of the dinner is ready to be taken up. If long exposed 
to the air, they fall. 



606. Bread Pudding. — Pour over twelve tablespoonfuls of 
fine light bread or cracker crumbs, three tumblerfuls of boiling 
sweet milk. Let it stand covered until half an hour before dinner 
Then mix with six eggs well beaten, nine tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, a small grated lemon, three tablespoonfuls of butter, not 
heaped. Bake in a moderate oven. To ascertain whether a pud- 
ding is done, pierce it near the centre with a large straw or knife* 
blade ; if no batter adheres to it, the pudding is done. 



<M>7. The Queen of Puddings — Mrs. C.'s Receipt. — One pin 
of bread crumbs; pour over them a quart of hot sweet nJlk; 
beat a tumbler of sugar to the yolks of four eggs ; add to the 
milk, while warm, a piece of butter the size of a large hen's egg, 
and the grated rind of a lemon. Mash the bread smoothly,

layer of buttered bread. Make a custard by beating six or eight 
eggs, with a quarter of a pound of nice sugar and a quart of milk. 
Pour half this custard on the bread in the pudding-dish, and let 
it stand half an hour. Pour over the remainder of the custard, 
and bake in a moderate oven. Large crackers may be split and 
buttered, and used in the same way. Serve with mock cream or 
arrowroot sauce. 



610. Poor Man's Pudding. — Pour one quart of hot sweet milk

a tablespoonful of ginger, one tumblerful of sour milk, and a tea- 
spoonful of soda ; mix all together, with flour enough to make a 
batter the consistence of pound-cake batter. Bake for an hour, 
in a deep, buttered pan. Turn it out ; grate sugar over it, arul 
eat with a rich sauce. 



614. Quick Pudding. — Soften as much sponge-cake as you 
wish to use with hot, rich sweet milk — let it soak. Just before 
dinner make a boiled custard of the yolks of the eggs, and pour 
it hot over L he cake ; beat it well ; season to taste ; bake until 
fiim. Put a meringue over the custard. Make the meringue 
by whipping the whites to a stiff froth; add a tablespoonful of 
yilverized sugar for each egg ; flavor. Better eaten with sauce.

lastly, the whites beaten to a stiff froth; stir them in lightly. 
All the beating to the pudding must be done before the whites 
are added. Bake, and turn out. Sift over it fine loaf sugar. 
Eat with sauce. 



617. Corn Meal Pudding, No. 1. — One pint of sifted meal, one 
tumbler of good molasses, one pint of sweet milk, a quarter of a 
pound of butter, grated lemon peel or powdered mace to flavor it.

of v/iue, a heaped tablespoonful of crushed sugar, £ snail stick of 
cinnamon, a blade of mace, a little lemon peel. Put the cover 
on the stew-pan, and stew slowly, until the apples are tender. 
Take them up, and let them get cold. Fill the bottom of an 
e&ithen dish with the apples, and pour ov r er them a rich custard 
made by beating together the yolks of eight eggs, and the whites 
ci four. Scald a quart of milk; sweeten to taste, and stir to the 
eggs slowly, stirring constantly. Bake in a moderate oven. An 
oven too hot will make the custard watery. Serve with solid 
sauce, if the pudding is eaten hot; liquid sauce, if cold. 

A similar pudding may be made by pouring over the apples a 
thin batter, instead of a custard. The proportions for this are 
one tumblerful of sifted flour, three tumblerfuls of milk, four 
eggs, beaten together. Make a smooth batter, and pour over the 
apples when they are cold. 



620. Snow Pudding. — One ounce of gelatine dissolved in one 
pint of water ; then add one pint of boiling water, one pound of 
sugar, whites of six eggs, juice of four lemons; flavor; beat ail 
together until it thickens. Pour into a bowl, eat with sweetened 
cream. 



621 . Tapioca Pudding, No. 1 . — Pour a quart of milk over a 
tumbler of tapioca. The milk should be boiling hot, and sweet- 
ened to the taste. Beat six eggs well, and when the milk is 
nearly cold, pour it slowly upon the eggs, stirring rapidly ; season 
with nutmeg and cinnamon. Bako a quarter of an hour, and 
serve with rich sauce, 



C22. Tapioca Pudding, No. 2. — Soak a tumblerful of tapioca 
for one hour in two tumblerfuls of milk. Put in a stew-pan half a 
dozen medium-sized tart apples, peeled and cored ; the cavities 
filled with sugar and a little powdered cinnamon. Pour to them 
a tumblerful of water ; cover the stew-pan, and stew uutil th« 



PUDDINOS. 263 

•pples are tender. Take th mi up ; put them in a fire-proof dish ; 
pour over them any syrup that may remain in the stew-pan ; add 
to the tapioca another tumblerful of rich, sweet milk ; pour over 
the apples, and bake. Eat with rich, solid, butter sauce. 

623. /Sago Pudding. — Wash a quarter of a pound of sago in 
X>ld water; pour this otF, and cover with boiling watov ; bt Lhu 
•tand until the water that covers the sago is lukewarm ; s-tir veil. 
Peel and core enough tart apples to cover the bottom of a bak- 
ing-dish ; fill the holes with sugar, and sprinkle some over the 
apples ; strew over a seasoning of lemon-juice, grated peel, and a 
nutmeg ; stir the sago well, and pour it over the apples. A little 
more water may be necessary. Let this stand after baking until 
cool. Eat with cream sauce. 



624. Grated Potato Pudding. — One pint of sugar, half a pint 
of molasses, one large spoonful of butter, and a pint of sweet 
potatoes, grated. Mix well, and add sweet milk enough to make 
quite thin; season with orange peel, beaten fine, and ginger. 
After it is mixed, add to it three well-beaten eggs. Bake in a 
very slow oven to allow it to candy over the top. 

625. Sweet Potato Pudding. — Take half a pound of sweet 
potatoes; wash them, and put them into a pot with a very little 
water — barely enough to prevent their burning. Let them sim- 
mer slowly for about half an hour; they must be only parboiled, 
otherwise they will be soft, and make the pudding heavy. When 
they are half done, take them out ; peel them, and, when cold, 
grate them. Stir together to a cream half a pound of butter and 
six ounces of powdered sugar; add a grated nutmeg, a large tea- 
spoonful of beaten mace, the juice and grated peel o**< ne lemon, • 
wineglass of rose-water, a glass of wine, and a glass of brandy. 
Btir these ingredients together. Beat eight eggs very light, and 
Stir them into the mixture alternately with the potato, a little of 
each at a time. Having stirred the whole very hard at the last, 
pour iDto a buttered disJi auJ bike three-quarters of an hour 
To be eaten cold.

028. A Superior Bread Pudding. — Three pints of milk 
scalded, a teaspoonful of salt, elven ounces of grated bread. 
Pour the hot milk over the bread at least an hour before the 
pudding is made. A good plan is to put the bread to soak 
before you rise from the breakfast-table. To make the pudding, 
add half a pound of sugar, a quarter of a pound of butter, five eggs, 
well beaten. Flavor with mace, and bake three-quarters of an 
hour. Eat with rich sauce. 



620. Bice Pudding. — A quarter of a pound of rice, boiled

631. A Custard Pudding. — One quart of milk, eij ht egg*, 
eight tablespoonfuls of flour: wot up the flour with suffk ent milk 
to make it into a paste ; put the remainder of the milk o l to boil. 
As it boils, stir in the paste ; let it boil five Minutes ; the a pour it 
off. When cool, add the eggs, previously well beaten; flavor to 
taste. Butter earthen cups ; pour the custard into th«9 eups, and 
grate a little nutmeg over it. Fill a stove baking-pan to the 
depth of an inch with boiling water; set the cups in it, and bake 
until the custard is firm enough to turn out. Serve with trana 
parent sauce.

the flour and the milk until all are mixed. Have ready a hut* 
tered dish, and bake immediately in a quick oven. Eat with a 
sauce 



635. Boiled Puddings. — I omitted to mention in the proper 
place that a mould is sometimes used for boiling puddings. I 
gie&tly prefer a bag. When the mould is used it should have 
a well-fitting cover, or be carefully tied over with a strong 
liner cloth, as the smallest quantity of water getting in would 
spoil the pudding. 

636. Currant Pudding. — One pint of bread crumbs, six eggs, 
two tablespoonfuls of flour, one of sugar, a dessert-spoonful of 
butter, half a pound of currants. Cover the bread crumbs with 
a quart of boiling milk ; add the butter ; beat the eggs and sugar 
together ; add the flour. When the milk is nearly cold, pour it 
slowly to the eggs, stirring constantly, to make a smooth batter ; 
strain through thin muslin. Flour the currants well ; add lastly. 
Scald the bag ; flour it well on the inside ; pour in the batter, and 
boil two hours. Serve with a rich sauce.

Gtu th«. pudding well; scald your pudding-bag; lay it in a bow« 
fl^ur it thickly; pour in the batter; tie well, and folic w the 
directions for boiling. Serve with a rich sauce, for which a 
variety of excellent receipts are given in this book. 

This pudding will require six hours constant boiling. Lay it in 
a pot of boiling water, and turn several times before suspending 
it. Some persons boil without suspending, turning the pudding 
frequently, and putting a plate at the bottom of the pot to preven 
the bag from scorching. Always lay the pudding in a pan of 
cold water a few minutes before turning it out of the bag. Butter 
is sometimes used instead of suet, using rather less butter. If 
any of the pudding is left, tie in a cloth and re-boil an hour. 



640. Dr. Kitchiner's Plum Pudding. — Suet chopped fine, six 
ounces; raisins, seeded and cut, six ounces; the same of currants, 
washed and dried; bread crumbs, three ounces; the same o! 
flour, three eggs, half a nutmeg, a teaspoonful of mace and cinna- 
mon mixed, half a teaspoonful of salt, a tumbler of milk, four 
ounces of sugar, a little citron and orange peel. Beat the eggs 
well; add the spice; mix the milk in by degrees; then the rest 
of the ingredients. Boil in a cloth, as already directed, in plenty 
(»f water. It must boil steadily, or the pudding will be heavy. 
IScil six hours. Prepare everything the day before it is wanted.

DUMPLINGS, ETC. 

646. BuiUd Apple Dumplings. — After making the pas*«, divid« 
nto as many pieces as there are apples. Pare and core medium 
■ized apples that are easy to e<>ok ; sweetenings will not answer. 
Fill the cavities with marmalade or jelly. Iloll the pieces of past* 
to about the size of a small saucer; put the fruit in the middle; 
draw the paste around, enclosing the fruit well. The edges of 
the dough should nearly meet, not lap. Tie iu thin muslin, 
separately ; drop into a pot of boiling water. Thiee quarters of 
an hour will be required to boil them. They are pretty boiled 
in coarse knit or crocheted cloths. Serve with hard butter sauce. 



647. Apple Dumplings {Stewed). — Pare and core the apples, 
put them in a stew-pan, and parboil them a little. Fill the 
cavities with any kind of sweetmeats. Roll out pieces of potato 
paste to the size of a common saucer; place an apple upon each 
piece (some persons stew the truit first, and place about a heap- 
ing tablespoonful upon each piece of paste) ; close the edges of 
the paste around the fruit. Put the dumplings in a large fire- 
proof dish without piling. Make a sauce of enough water 
to cover the dumplings; sweeten to taste; add for a dozen 
dumplings half a pound of butter; flavor with a tablespoonful of 
powdered cinnamon. Pour this over the dumplings. Set the 
pan or dish in the stove or oven; stew three quarters of an hour 
Turn them once, when half done. Serve the liquor in the dish for 
aauce. Should the water become too in jch reduced, add a tit Ut 
water, just enough to make the sauce.

rately in the paste; put them in a tin pan, and bake them. Servt 
not, with rich, solid butter sauce. 



6-19 Snow Balls. — W**sh and pick half a pound of rice ; boil 
\. cotered with water, ten minutes; drain though a sieve, and 
(•read on a dish to dry. Peel and core six apples, medium 
i:-ced. Divide the rice into six parts ; envelop each apple in a 
portion of the rice (the cavities in the apples first filled with 
powdered sugar and cinnamon). Tie separately in cloths, loosely, 
Boil one hour. Eat with a rich sauce. 



650. Fritters. — Three eggs, three tumblerfuls of sifted flour, 
two tumblerfuls of milk (sour milk or buttermilk) ; beat the 
aggs separately, adding to the yolks, alternately, the flour and 
milk. Stir in an even teaspoonful of soda. Whisk the whites 
to a stiff froth, and stir lightly into the batter last. Have ready 
a pan of boiling lard, and drop the batter in by spoonfuls; color 
a light brown on both sides. 



650|-. Orange Dumpling. — Light paste, roll out and lay on 
oranges cut thin, sprinkle over with sugar, and a little grated 
peel, fold the ends securely. Boil in a cloth one hour and a half. 
Lemon sauce ; six eggs, leave out two whites, one-half pound of 
butter, one pound of sugar ; grate two lemons, add all ; put in a 
pm over a slow fire, stir until thick as honey. 



051. Bell Fritters. — Put into a stew-pan a piece of butter the 
*ize of a large hen's egg ; pour over it a pint of boiling water 
and set it upon the stove until it is ready to boil. Stir in a pin 
*f flour, making a smooth paste. Let this remain on the fire 
few minutes, stirring all the time to prevent its sticking to the 
vessel ; when thick «s mush, remove it from the fire. When 
milk-warm, beat in one egg at a .ime until five are added; put 
lc a teaspoonful of salt. Put a pint of lard in a small, deep 
vessel. Make the fritters in small balls, about the size of a 



DUMPLIN08, ITC. 27 \

brown, and serve upon a dish the bottom (f which has been 
covered with a napkin. Eat with cream and sugar sauce. 

652, Bread Fritters. — Cut stale light rolls or rusks into sHcet 
kalf an inch thick. Beat two eggs, and add to them a tumblerfu 
of rica milk, sweetened to taste and flavored with cinnamon 01 
mace. Pour this mixture over the bread; turn the slices once, 
and when saturated (but not soft enough to break) drop into boil- 
ing lard. Fry to a delicate brown on both sides, and eat with 
wine sauce, or molasses sauce. 



553. Pancakes. — This is a good proportion for pancakes; A 
quart of sifted flour; enough milk to make the batter the con- 
sistence of thick cream (pancake. batter should always be thinner 
than that for fritters) ; salt to taste; three eggs beaten separately. 
Put a piece of lard the size of a nutmeg into a frying-pan, and, 
when hot, pour in about two tablespoon fu Is of the batter — the 
batter spread over the bottom of the frying-pan; the quantity 
will depend upon the size of the pan. When brown on one side, 
turn it; and when both sides are a delicate brown, fold twice and 
place in a covered dish. Send them to the table as soon as three 
or four are prepared ; follow these with others as expeditiously 
as possible. Do not commence baking until the last meat course 
is nearly through, as they are not good unless eaten hot. Use 
the same sauce as for fritters. 

Pancakes are sometimes served without being folded, and a 
little powdered sugar flavored with cinnamon or nutmeg sifted 
Otct each pancake. They are then called a " quire of paper pan 
cakis." 



654. Puffs, No. 1. — These are made of pastry rolled to the size 
of a saucer. Spread, to within a quarter of an inch of the edge, 
on one-half the paste, any kind of stewed or preserved fruit; turn 
over the fruit the other half of the paste. Either bake or fry

the eggs with the cream and wine ; add the grated potato gradu- 
ally ; beat all together five minutes ; no flour. Fry in lard ; 
take up with a perforated dipper ; serve as fast as fried ; begin 
to fry while they are eating the first course. They are delicioui 
with golden honey, but any good syrup or sauce will answer. 



655}. Friars. — One pint of flour and one pint of milk mixed 
together ; two tablespoonfuls of hominy, and three eggs, a tea- 
npoonful of salt. The whole n ust be well mixed ; dropped with 
a large spoon into bciling larl, aid fried brcwn. Each spoonful 
iu*kes a fritter. 



CTJSTARD2> 

All cuatards made of milk and eggs should be baked ^n i 
moderate oven. If baked too rapidly they are almost sure to t* 
tough and watury. Custards are best baked without a bottom 
crust, lining only the sides and edges of the plate with the puff 
paste. Several layers of the paste (rolled very thin) placed 
•round the edge and extending far enough to allow the custard 
to conceal where they terminate, give an elegant finish. Some 
persons are in the habit of notching and otherwise ornamenting 
ihe edges of the paste. This is highly improper ; the puff paste 
should be handled as little as possible, so as to preserve the 
flaky texture of the cnurt. Custards are best eaten cold, but 
should not be kept tor long. If served warm they will require 
an under crust. 



656. Lemon Custard, No. 1. — Three lemons, six eggs, two 
cups of nice sugar, and >wo cups of cold water. Koll the lemons

ter and sugar togetli3r. Mix the cocoanut and eggs, and stir to 
the butter with a wineglass of rose or orange water. Lastly, stir 
in lightly a tumblerful of rich cream. Bake half an hour in puff 
paste. 

6G2. Almond Custard. — Blanch a quarter of a pound of sweet 
almonds ; the same of bitter almonds or peach kernels ; a quarter 
of a pound of powdered white sugar, and two ounces of batter. 
Beat the almonds to a paste, adding rose or orange watei to pre- 
rrnt their oiling. Cream the butter and sugar together; stir in 
the almond paste by degrees until worked in smoothly; add tim 
whites of six eggs, beaten to a froth ; beat in very lightly four even 
tablespoonfuls of sifted flour, dipped up lightly. Bake half ad 
boor in puff paste. Sift loaf sugar over when cold.

▼or to taste ; bake in a rich crust. Take the remainder of J ha 
whites, beat with three tablespoonfuls of sugar, spread ovei the 
custards, and return to the oven until a light brown. This juan- 
tit? makes two custards. 



664. Transparent Custard. — Beat weJl with half a pound of 
tsrushed sugar the yolks of eight eggs ; set upon the fire the pan 
containing them, and add, in small pieces, half a pound of butter ;

sore them ; cook *,hem in a little water until soft. Mash them 
irery smoothly ; sw r eeten and spice to taste ; beat ir five or sU 
eggs. Bake in puff paste. One gill of cream improves this. In 
using cream for custards or puddings, add it last, as cucn stir« 
ring converts it into butter.

oonstantly. Then stir in a wineglass of rose-water, a teaspoon 
ful of powdered cinnamon, and a grated lutmeg. Lay a [ aste in 
a buttered dish, and bake three-quarters of an hour. 



674. Bice Custard, — Pick and wash well one tumblerful of rice j 
ooil it dry in a pint of milk or water. Take it up; mash well, 
and strain through a colander; add a pint of sweet milk and half 
a tumblerful of melted butter. Beat three eggs well; add to the 
rice when it is cool; sweeten and flavor to taste. Bake in puff 
paste. 

This may be baked without a paste, and raisins or currants 
added, if liked. If used, stir them in when the custard is at least 
half done; if added earlier, they will settle at the bottom. 
Should be eaten with cream sauce. Meringue this. 

G7f>. Cheese- Cake Custard. — Yolks of ten eggs, whites of two, 
one half pound of butter, one-half pound of sugar, beat together; 
then beat in the eggs ; flavor with nutmeg. Bake in crust ; when 
done, spread over an acid jelly ; then meringue it. 



676. Bartow Custard. — One quart of sweet milk, three tabi*. 
spoonfuls of rice flour, half a pound of sugar, quarter of a poind

milk, and stir the paste to the boiling milk. Let it remain or 
the flour two or three minutes ; then remove it, and stir in the 
butter. Beat the eggs separately, the sugar with the yolks; 
then stir the yolks and whites together, and pour the milk t<r 
them when it is nearly cold. Strain the mixture ; use any flavor 
ing liked. Line pie-plates with pufF paste ; pour in the custaid, 
and grate nutmeg over the top, and bake until the custard is set. 

It is not absolutely necessary that the eggs should be beaten 
separately ; but it is necessary that they should be thoroughly 
beaten. 

This custard is delicious poured in a buttered dish and baked

hot with a rich, solid butter sauce. 



678. A Simple Egg Custard. — Four eggs, four tablespoonfuls 
of crushed sugar, an even tablespoonful of butter, one of flour,

SAUCES. 

'A jre* deal of the elegtoce of cookery depends upon the MCcmpanliMtU ft 
t*th dlsn lelug appropriate &u,i well adapted to It." 

All buttei sauces should be made of good, fresh butter 
Nothing good can be made of rancid butter; the taste cannot be 
disguised. To melt or draw it well, constant attention during the 
process is necessary. Should it oil, add to it immediately a 
tablesponful of cold water, and pour it into an earthen bowl, stir- 
ring well. For the taste of burnt butter there is no remedy ; it 
is unfit for use; therefore be particular in placing it upon the fire 
never to set it upon a blaze or very hot coals. It is a good and 
safe plan to put the vessel in which the butter is to be melted into 
another containing boiling water. A double kettle or a hot water 
bath answers this purpose well. A stew-pan lined with porcelain 
is also a suitable utensil for the boiling of sauces, and one should 
be kept for this purpose alone. In many kitchens there is not a 
single vessel suitable for preparing these delicate, and, as they 
shoidd be considered, indispensable accompaniments to meats, 
puddings, etc. 

To melt butter properly : Put into a stew-pan two ounces of 
butter, a large tablespoonful of fiVur or corn starch, arrowroot, or 
potato starch, two tablespoonfuls of milk. When the butter 
begins to melt, stir all well together ; add six tablespoonfuls of 
lfc>t water; cover the stew-pan, and stir all well together; let it 
bcil up, When of the consistence of creai.i, pour it out, and 
flavor cr season in any way desired. Butter mixes better with 
milk tnan with water; but ir transparent sauces water alone 
must be used, as milk will rendei it cloudy. 



682. Transparent Sauce. — A piece of butter the size of a larg« 



280 MRS 

egg, a common-sized saucer of sugar, a tumbler nearly full of 
wa;er. Put them all in a stew-pan together, and stir well. Sim 
mer gently five or six minutes. Beat the yolk of an egg in t 
bowl; pour the sauce very slowly upon it, stirring hard. When 
ill is in, return the mixture to the stew-pan; stir constantly until 
t is thoroughly hot; pour it into the tureen. Flavor with 
lemon, orange, or vanilla, and grate nutmeg over. 



(583. Sponge Cake Pudding Sauce. — Two cups of butter 
creamed with a cup of sugar; beat together, in a deep bowl or 
dish, the yolks of two eggs. Put the butter in a well-lined stew- 
pan ; set this in boiling water. Stir the butter constantly until 
it has melted ; pour it slowly to the eggs, stirring hard. Return 
it to the stew-pan ; pour in a teacup of boiling water. Let it 
simmer three or four minutes, shaking the pan or stirring it fre- 
quently. Flavor with any of the extracts, and grate over 
nutmeg. 

684. Mrs. BSs Sponge Cake Sauce Receipt. — Two tablespoon 
fuls of powdered loaf sugar, six of cold water. Boil a few minutes , 
stir in two heaped teaspoonfuls of butter. As soon as the butter 
melts, stir well, and season with wine and nutmeg. 



685. Sauce for Boiled Pudding. — Cream together a tumbler 
of good fresh butter, the same of powdered sugar; stir to them 
half a tumblerful of hot water; mix well. Place the stew-pan 
containing this mixture upon the stove just long enough to heat 
horoughly, adding the grated rind of a lemon or orange, or flavor 
with extract of lemon Pdt upon the bottom of the sauce tuieen 
a tablespoonful of currant or apple jelly ; pour the sauce over it, 
stirring and mixing well — or the jelly may be omitted and wini 
used instead. 



B86. Arrowroot Sauce. — Wet up half a teacup of arrow rod 



siuces. 851 

with a t«*cup of cream, milk, or water as irefened, t*u larg« 
Ublespooifuls of sugar, and nutmeg to taste. Boil fcur or fi\« 
minutes; serve hot. Should it become toe thick, thin with 
fiream. Flavor with rose or orange water, :>r wine, if preferred, 
a^ing pal ^ Sherry ; more sugar if liked. 



G87. Sour Cream Sauce. — One cup of sugar, one and a hall 
cups of sour cream. Beat well together, and grate over nutmeg 
Nico for fritters or pancakes. 



688. A Good Sauce. — One tumbler of wine and one of sugar; 
stir together, and heat to the boiling point ; stir slowly to the 
well-beaten yolks of four eggs. Put on the fire long enough to 
take off the raw taste of the egg. Grate in lemon; add a table- 
spoonful <>f the juice, or orange peel or nutmeg. Serve hot, in a 
covered tureen. 



689. Cream Sauce. — Stir together a tumblerful of rich, thick 
cream and a tumbler lightly full of fine white sugar ; grate over 
t nutmeg. Serve cold, with fruit tarts. 



690. Mock Cream Sauce. — To two tumblers of sweet milk, stir 
Li loaf sugar enough to sweeten it well ; put it on the fire. Beat 
together the whites of two eggs, and the yolk of one. When the 
milk becomes hot, pour it slowly to the eggs, stirring constantly. 
Beturn it to the stew-pan; scald it, shaking the stew-pan fre. 
queutly. Serve in a sauce-boat. Flavor in any way liked. 

(he egg will be sufficient if you use a la^ge tablespoonful of 
potato or corn starch, arrowroot, or flour. Wet this up with • 
little of the milk, cold, and pour into the sauce when it boilf ujpy 
wiping w*ll.

691. Syllabub Sauce. — Cream seasoned as for syllabub makes 
fine sauce for delicate custards, fritters, and pancakes. 



692. Sauce of any kind of Jam. — Put into a small stew-pan 
half a tumbler of Sherry wine, in which has been dissolved at 
even teaspoonful of powdered sugar. Mix in well two table 
spoonfuls of jam. Warm gently ; use with delicate custards o? 
puddings. 



Butter Sauce. — Half a tumbler of butter, a tumbler of 
sugar ; mix well, and stir to the yolks of two eggs ; pour over a 
tumbler of boiling wine ; boil one minute, stirring well. Serve 
with plain boiled pudding. 



694. Hard Sauce. — Cream, until white and spongy, one tea- 
cup of butter, two of loaf sugar, pulverized. This sauce requires 
to be creamed well. Stir in as much wine as it will take, or season 
with any of the extracts. Place it, lightly heaped, on a glass :>r 
silver plate. It makes an elegant sauce for bread puddings, or 
for any kind of boiled pudding. This sauce may be varied by 
stirring to it a large tablespoonful of very stiff apple or quince 
jelly, or the grated rind and juice of an orange or lemon. 



695. Egg Drawn Butter. — Beat one egg light; add to it a 

tumbler of cold water. Set it on the stove in a stew-pan ; bcil 

slowly until it thickens ; stir in a dessert-spoonful of butter. Ta 
this may be added wine and sugar. Serve with puddings. 



696. Sauce for Tarts. — Make a thick boiled custard ; f >r a pint, 
use the yolks of four eggs, a tablespocnful of corn starch ; wet with 
cold milk, and add to the boiling pint of milk. Pour into an 
open stand when cool. Sweeten and flavor to taste. Make aL 
icing of two of the whites beaten stiff spread over the custard 
and scorch with a hot salamander or shovel. 



CAKES. 

Tut process of the compounding and oaking of cakes be.rg i 
UHicate operation, it should not be left to careless h&iids, lut 
•hould be carried on under the close supervision of the house- 
wife. Says Mrs. Hannah More: "Those women who are so 
puffed up with conceit of talents or position as to neglect the 
plain duties of life, will not often be found women of the best 
abilities. It is best to begin cake-making as early after break- 
fast as is convenient. Have everything in readiness. When 
there is fruit to be used, prepare it the previous day. By all 
means be supplied with well-balanced scales, as in cake-making 
nothing should be done by guess-work, and measuring is much 
less exact than weighing. Be sure that all your materials are 
good. Never use rancid butter. Sift and sun the flour well. Jn 
summer, place the eggs in cold water a little while before using — 
the whites froth better. When soda and cream of tartar are used 
in batters, the soda should be carefully sifted with the flour, as 
the smallest lump will make a yellow place in the cake. Dis- 
solve the cream of tartar in a little water. Sal volatile is often 
used in the place of soda. A bit the size of a nutmeg will be 
surhYient for a pound of cake. Yeast powders are also very good 
For beating the whites of the eggs an egg-beater of wire is best. 
When one cannot be procured, a large silver fork is very good. 
A good substitute for an egg-beater is a bun:h of white oak split* 
tied near one end. The whites should be whipped to a verj 
solid froth. When they will adhere to the dish or a knife-blade, 
inverted, they are well beaten. Never commence beating them 
until the yolks and sugar are finished beating, as, if beaten too 
soon, they will fall. Always use a wooden paddle for beating 
cake; the warmth of the hand renders the batt ir oily. Was* 
the butter in cold water, cr*?*in it, pouring off ever/ parliele of 



284 

water. In cold weather, wash in tepid water, or place near th« 
fire, where it will soften enough to cream. For mixing th# 
batter, an earthen bowl is best. 

To mix cake: After creaming the butter, add the flour by 
degrees, creaming together until half the flour is used. Beat tb 
yolks and sugar, adding the sugar gradually until the mixtur- U 
white and spongy. The principal beating of the cake shouM m 
put upon the yolks and sugar. After they are beaten sufficiently 
add them to the butter alternately with the remainder of the 
flour. In all cakes where butter is used, the whites must be added 
last; as soon as they are well incorporated with the batter, put 
the cake to bake. In sponge cake, at least a third of the flour 
must be added after the whites, or the cake will fall. Fruit 
should be well floured before adding to the batter. Butter the 
pans after covering the bottom with foolscap paper, rubbing the 
butter on with a cloth, that there may be no lumps. The excel- 
lence of cake depends quite as much upon the baking as upon the 
proper mixing of the ingredients. Good judgment and close 
attention are absolutely essential, but experience alone can render 
one an expert cake baker. If an oven is used, let the bottom be 
warm before placing the cake in it. Put the lid on cold, and 
cover evenly with hot embers. Keep the oven at a moderate 
heat until the cake is well risen ; then increase the heat, and bake 
as quickly as possible without burning. If baked too slowly, the 
butter becomes oily, and settles in streaks through the cake. 
Never attempt baking cake in a stove while the cooking of 
meal is in progress, as, under those circumstances, it is impossibU 
to regulate the heat properly. To prevent burning, it h well to 
elevate the cake a little from the bottom of a stove or Wick oven 
ly placing ihe pan upon muffin-rings, or a trivet; or, in an *t«>fc 
oven, throw a little ashes or sawdist into the bottom befort 
putting in the pan. 

To ascei tain the degree of heat of a stove or brick oven, put 
iii a small bit of dough ; if it gradually assumes a light brown 
oolor it indicates a condition proper for the reception of th*> 



OARti. 282 

sake. Never suffer the he»t to diminish while the take is baking, 
m it will cause it to fall. It is, of course, sometimes necessary 
to raise the oven-lid or open the stove to look at the cake ; but 
uever suffer it to remain open longer than is absolutely neces- 
lary, as contact with the air will cause it to fall. When the cake 
if d^ne, it will shrink from the sides of the pan. To ascertain th 
/act more satisfactorily, pierce with a straw near the centre ; if 
no batter adheres to the straw, the cake is done. Always turn 
cakes upon a soft tablecloth to cool, turning them twice or three 
times, or oftener, that they may not become heavy from the 
absorption of the steam which they emit. Fruit cake must re- 
main in the pan to cool, as in removing it, it would be almost 
certain to break from its own weight. 

To prepare »'ake for icing: Trim off carefully all the burnt or 
uneven places; brush off the crumbs, and dust evenly with flour. 

Sponge cake requires a quicker oven than any other. Tea 
cakes require quick baking. Pound cake, a more moderate heat. 
Fruit cake, more moderate still. Molasses cake is more easily 
scorched than any other. In baking large cakes, a pan with 
straight sides is best — a tube in the centre.

into a saucer of molasses ; stir this into the cake. Stir in th« 
fruit (previously well floured) quickly, and set to baking as soon 
as possible ; bake slowly. If the fruit is burned at the bottom,

the cake in four pieces, but without injuring the shape, or bake 
the cake in plates, like jelly cake, put the frosting between, pile 
one over the other. Make the frosting by any good receipt ; re- 
serve part of the icing for the outside, and in the remainder stir 
grated cocoanut to make it as thick and rich as desired. The 
Cocoanut may be scalded in milk, whi«h should be drained 
from it before being stirred to the icing ; this is put between the 
■lices of cake. A rough icing may be made by adding grated 
cocoanut to all the icing and using it for the outside \& well M 
between the slices.

ICING 

A 8T*w pan lined with porcelain or tin is the best rcssel Aj at 
fai boiling icing. 



762. N» apareil Icing. — One poimJ <>f the best loaf sugar ; pou» 
over it half a tum'olerftil of water; let it boil until it will fall in 
short drops from the spoon; pour it immediately into an earthen 
bowl, and when it is milk-warm, break into it the whites of three 
large, fresh hen's ^ggs; beat until stiff and white, adding half the 
juice of a lemon, or half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Flavor 
with extract of lemon, vanilla, or any flavoring preferred. It can 
be colored a delicate pink, if liked, with cochineal, straw berrf 
juice or extract, or with the juice of a beet. 



703. Beautiful Icing. — The whites of ftur eggs well beaten 
with one pound of loaf sugar pulverized and silted, a teaspoonful 
of arrowroot, and one of pulverized and sifted white gum Arabic, 
and the juice < f one lemon. Flavor with rose-water, or any- 
thing liked 

764. Almond Icing. — This can be made by either of the above 
receipts, by using to a pound of sugar, half a pound of almonds, 
■weet and bitter mixed, blanched and beaten to a paste, with a 
little rose-w r ater. It is by far the best for icing fruit cakes, as it does 
not become discolored so easily as the plain. 



In using icing, after the cake is floured, pour (if for a large 
cake) two or three tablespoonfuls on the top, and spread over 
evenly with a large-bladed knife, keeping a give of wa*er con 
Vunient, into whieh dip the knife for smoothing over any little 
inoqualities that may appear. It is best dried in the sun if th« 



200 una. hill's new cook book. 

weather will permit. If dried by the Are, care must he tanec to 
prevent scorching. Should any of the icing remain, make ci it 
macaroons, kisses, and meringues. In using almonds, alwa\ s inir 
a few bitter ones., or peach kernels, with the sweet. 



705. Almond Macaroons.— One pound of blanched almonds 
jeat to a paste, with rose-water, one pound and a haif of loaf 
•ugar pulverized, ana the whites of seven eggs; mix well. Roll 
in flour a teaspoonful to each ball, and bake upon paper buttered. 
Bake in a quick oven. Coooanut grated, arid parched ground 
peas, are all good. 

766. Icing made with Gelatine. — Two tablespoozifule of 
gelatine, one tiurMer of boiling water; boil mtil dissolved* 
•train Make a stiff f ante with sugar ; season 



FANCY DISIIES. 

767 Charhtte Polonaise. — Bake a sponge cake, dritra shape— 
!* straight tin bucket will answer. Cut out the inside, leaving 
bottom and sides two inches thick. Make Irish moss, or gela- 
tine blanc-mange, divide it into four parts, and season each one 
differently — vanilla, lemon, peach, and chocolate. Moisten th<J 
bottom of the cake with a little water, flavored with wine, 
orange-flower water, lemon, or vanilla. When the blanc-mange 
is cool, not cold, put a layer over the bottom of the cake, sprin- 
kle over a layer of grated cocoanut, then blanc-mange and cocoa- 
nut until the cake mould is nearly full. Set this on ice, or a cold 
place. Ice the sides, and cover the top with syllabub ; ornament 
with macaroons. This may be made by slicing the whole cake 
and putting the different kinds of blanc-mange between, as in 
jelly cake, or bake the cakes thin in pie plates like jelly cake. 

768. Lemon Souffle. — The yolks of three eggs, three ounces of 
sugar, and the grated rind of halt* a lemon. Beat these together 
well ; add to them the whites of the eggs, beaten to a solid froth, 
and the juice of half a lemon. Put all immediately into a deep 
pudding-dish, and bake for ten or fifteen minutes. Serve with a 
sauoe made of two well-beaten eggs, the juice ar \ grated peel of 
half a lemon. Stir it over the fire till it begins to rise. Care 
inujit be taken not to let the souffle get too brown. The safest 
way to cook souffles is to sot the dish over boiling water, and 
h ;ld over a red hot salamander or large shovel until the egg is of 
i golder color. 

769. Trifle. — Beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth 
whip a pint of rich cream until very solid ; then mix the two in 
a bowl, adding alternately cream and egg, a spoonful at a time ; 
flavor to taste. .Serve in a gl;u:s stand, putting in a Jayer of 



SOS Mita. iiill's hew cook boo* 

cream, then one of almond macaroons or met indues. Prepail 

this just before serving. 



770. Syllabub, No. 1. — One pint of thick cream (if it should 
oe a little acid, stir in enough soda to sweeten it). Mix with the 
•ream one quarter of a pound of white sifted sugar ; let it stand 
half an hour ; then add three wineglasses of Sherry or Madeira 
wine. Whip to a stiff froth, and fill the glasses. Either churn 
the cream, using a small tin sylkbub churn (which can be pro- 
cured at any tin-shop), or pour the cream upon a flat dish and 
whip with a silver fork or egg-beatep. 



^Tl. Chocolate Cream. — Scrape into a quart of fresh sweat 
milk or cnntn one ounce of best French chocolate ; sweeten to 
taste ; boil, stir it well. Beat the whites of six eggs to a stifl 
froth, put them in a bowl, pour the chocolate to it, stir all to- 
gether well, and rapidly, strain through a sieve. Serve in cua- 
tard cups, rold. 



772. Boiled Custard. — Twelve common-sized teacups of 
sweet milk, twelve eggs, all broken together and well beaten ; 
thirteen tablespoonfuls of sifted loaf sugar, beaten into the eggs. 
Put .he milk on to simmer with a few sticks of cinnamon. After 
the eggs are well beaten, pour them into the milk, stirring the 
milk constantly until it begins to thicken. Pour it off, and set 
where it will become perfectly cold. Take of whipped syllabub 
enough to cover the tops of the glasses which you fill with the 
cu*tards; place it on the bottom of a clean sifter inverted over a 
plate, and let it remain long enough to drip out any cream that 
the froth may contain. When well dripprd, heap roughly upon 
the top of the custard in the glasses. 'Die custard may be served 
in a large glass bowl. 



773. Plain Boiled Custard. — Put to boil a quart cf fresh milk. 



FANCY DISHES. 803 

Take two tablespoonfuls >f corn or potato star .h. farina, or arrow 
root, or of wheat flour, and mix to a smooth paste with a little 
oold milk. When the quart of milk boils up, pour the paste tc 
it, and let it boil five minutes. In a large bowl stir to the yolka 
of eight eggs eight heaped tablespoonfuls of pulverized sugar until 
ihey are mixed. (The yolks of the eggs should be beaten as 
little a* will answer, as custards are mueh richer to retain as 
much as possible of the natural color of the egg.) When the 
milk is tepid, pour it to the eggs, and return to the kettle ; throw 
in a stick or two of cinnamon, and boil according to the directions 
following this receipt. When the custard is done, pour it into an 
earthen bowl ; stir steadily for a few minutes ; then set it where 
i% will become icy cold. Flavor with any extract liked. 

The whites should not be beaten until just before the custard 
is to be served ; then whip them to a &c!id froth, and flavor with 
the same flavoring used for the custard. They may be delicately 
colored with a teaspoonful of molasses, or with any of the color- 
ing extracts, or with cochineal. Lay this upon the custard. 
Serve the custard in a large glass bowl or in custard cups. This 
custard is excellent poured into cups, the cups set in an oven or 
pan half filled with boiling water, and baked. 

Directions for boiling custards : For this a double kettle i§ 
best ; where this cannot be procured, boil in a tin bucket ; set in 
an oven of water kept constantly boiling. Stir the custard well 
from the bottom, and when it begins to form like beads on the 
bottom of the spoon, lose no time in pouring it out. An earthen 
%e*sel is best for pouring it into, as it does not retain heat so long 
as tin. After pouring it out, stir steadily for five or six minutt-s 
M§ it sometimes curdles after it is taken up. For making cus 
laids, perfectly fresh milk should be used. Should it be neces 
«aiy to -jse that which has been standing, first add co t a little 
»oda to prevent its turning. 

774. White Custard. — The whites of eight eggs, one-quarter o/ 
a pound of sjgar; whip as you would for icing. Boil a quart oi

MR8. HILLS NEW COOK BOOK. 



milk ; add to it a tablespoon ful of arrowroot; wet up with cold 
milk, and boil for tive minutes. Pour off the milk, and when 
tepid, add it tc the eggs, stirring well. Return it to the kettle* 
and boil ten minutes, stirring constantly. Pour <<i out, and whel 
x>ol, flavor with vanilla or any thing preferred. 

It is well to make this to serve with those baked custards il 
rhich only the yolk of the egg is used. 



775. Tapioca Boiled Custard. — Put to soak in one pint of m'dk 
a tumblerful of tapioca. Let it soak at least an hour; then pou* 
to it a quart of milk mixed with the yolks of six eggs. Put on 
to boil with a stick of cinnamon or a few fresh peach leaves, to 
flavor it. When the tapioca is soft, aud the custard begins to thicken, 
take it up. Serve in custard-cups, grating a little nutmeg over. 



776. Floating Island. — Place slices of sponge or Naples biscuh 
at the bottom of a large glass stand. Pour the dish half full of 
good boiled custard. Beat to the whites of the eggs six tabU 
spoonfuls of hog's foot or calf's foot jelly to a stiff froth. Pla« 
this irregularly on the top of the custard. 

If it is not convenient to use either of the jellies mentioned, 
anv kind of fruit jelly will answer, using four tablespoonfuls. 



777 Tipsy Squire. — Saturate with Sherry wine a thin sponge- 
cake. Ornament the top with blanched almonds, sticking them 
in with the points upwards, and tastily arranged. Half fill a 
large glass bowl with good boiled custard, and carefully place the 
cake on the top of the custard, taking care that the bowl used is 
•f a circumference somewhat larger than that of the cake. 



T78. Muffled Cake. — Place a thin sponge-cake m the bottom 
of a glass bowl. Nearly fill the bowl with rich boiled custaid. 
Heap thick and high over this, syllabub from which :he cream 
nas been dripped throug'i a sieve. Ornament this with smaH 
thin bits of solid fruit jelly.

dissolved in a teacup of white wine, warm; strain it; mix with 
one piut of cream and the juice of one lemon. Sweeten to y;ui 
iaste, and when all is mixed together, pour into moulds. 



78C Swiss Cream. — One pint jf sweet cream, half a pound of 
oaf sugar, the yolks of eight eggs. Beat together, and simmer 
for a few minutes. Put one ounce of gelatine in a quart of watez, 
and boil down to a pint. Pour the two mixtures together. Let 
it come to a boil ; set it aside. When cool, flavor with lemon 
01 vanilla. Put upon it syllabub from which the cream has beeu 
dripped through a sieve. 

781. Isabella Cream. — One ounce of isinglass dissolved in half 
a pint of boiling water. After straining it, add one quart of 
cream, and stir till it boils. One teacup of crushed sugar is now 
put in, and the mixture a little cooled ; then the beaten yolks of 
six eggs are gradually added, together with one glass of wine. 
The whole should be strained and stirred until almost cool, when 
it may be turned into a mould. This is a handsome dish, as tiie 
yolks of the eggs give it a fine, rich color. 



782. Bohemian Cream. — Take any kind of fruit 

which has been stewed soft with sugar; pass this through a 
sieve ; add to half a pint of the fruit an ounce and a half of 
melted isinglass ; mix it well ; whip up a pint of cream, and add 
to it gradually the fruit and isinglass. Put it into a mould ; sot 
on ice or in any cool place, and wheQ ready, dip the mould into 
Warm water and turn out. 

Grated pineapple will make the above cream most elegant. 
it is very nice made with apples or any good fruit, and almond 
aream, very nice, may be made by substituting for the fnut 
almonds blanched and pounded with rose-water.

into a 6tove or oven of a very moderate heat, and let it remain 
until heated through, and a very light crust is formed over it 
To be eaten immediately. 

This is a very nice little dessert ; serves well as an accompani 
nuent to cake. Should not be made until after dinner has been 
sent in, as very few minutes are required for making it, and 
should be very closely watched while baking, as too great heat 
will quickly spoil it. 

785. Apple Float. — One pint of dried apples, stewed, mashed, 
and strained ; sweeten and flavor with nutmeg to taste. Beat to 
a stiff froth the whites of six eggs ; add lightly to the fruit. Eat 
in saucers or strawberry plates, with rich cream sauce 



786. Apple Snow — Is made by the same receipt, using green 
apples instead of dried.

flavored with a few drops of extract of lemon ; sweeten a pint of 
rioh cream ; pour it over the eggs ; add six teaspoonfuls of currant

Whip to a strong froth two pints of cream ; lay this on the bot 
torn cf a sifter, inverted, to drip ; then stir it into the custard, 
and set it away to congeal. (Flavor the cream with wine.) Put 
it into a mould to give it a pretty shape before it cools; 
or, if you prefer, make a mould of sponge-cake, by cutting oul 
the centre, leaving the walls an inch or two thick. Or, make a 
mould of lady's fingers, by placing them upright inside, of any 
kind of a shape, cementing the edges with the white of an egg 
After they are placed, set the mould on ice, and pour in the 
Charlotte russe just as it begins to congeal. Keep it on ice until 
just before serving. This may be iced.

792. Directions for Freezing Ice Creams and Custards. — foe- 
creams, custards and water are so delightful and refreshing foi 
lummei desserts and tea, it is to me a matter of astonishment 
,hat every family is not supplied with a patent icecream freezer ^ 
of which there are many in the market. By the use of one of 
these, the process of freezing is rendered so much more expedi- 
tious and satisfactory as to more than compensate for the trilling 
expense involved in its purchase. If not provided with this con- 
venience, a small quantity of ice-cream can be frozen in a tin 
bucket, taking care that there are no holes in it to let in the 
water, and spoil the cream. Set this bucket in a wooden tub or 
bucket several inches larger. On the bottom of this place a layer 
of pounded ice and salt ; set in the bucket containing the cream, 
or custard, and pack closely around its sides a mixture of 
pounded ice and salt (mixed in the proportion of six pounds of 
ice to one of salt), extending to within two inches of the top of 
the freezer. Cover the freezer, and keep it in constant motion, 
removing the cover frequently to scrape the congealed cream 
from the sides with a silver spoon or wooden paddle, taking care 
to keep the sides clear, and stirring it well to the bottom. Keep 
the tub well filled \* ith salt and ice outside the freezer, and take 
great care that none of the salt water gets in to spoil the cream. 
The outside tub or bucket should have a hole in or near the bot- 
tom, from which the bung can be removed to allow the water to 
pass out as the ice melts. After the cream is well frozen, it may 
be packed in moulds, and set in salt and pounded ice. When 
you wish to serve it, wrap the mould witk a hot cloth, turn out 
the cream and serve immediately. 

For making ice-cream, genuine cream is, of course, preferable. 
But in the absence of this, equal parts of milk and cream maybe 
used ; or, the miik may be heated, and, while hot, perfectly fresh 
rweet butter added to it ii sufficient quantity to give it the rich- 



FANCY DISIIE8. 30* 

of cream. Bjiled milk or custards must be allowed w 
become perfectly cold before putting them in the fieezer. Sour 
cream or buttermilk may be used by stirring into them enough 
toda to correct their acid before sweetening and flavoring. 
Custards and creams for freezing should be sweetened and 
flavored more highly than when not frozen. A half pound oi 
powdered loaf sugar and four eggs will be sufficient for a quart 
cf custard; stir the eggs and sugar together. Scald fresh sweet 
milk ; pour boiling hot upon the eggs, stirring constantly. Fla- 
vor to taste, and when cold, pour into the freezer. Finish by the 
directions already given. 

When flavored with fruit (if raspberries or strawberries), 
stem the fruit ; mash it ; add to each pint four tablespocnfuls of 
powdered loaf sugar; stir this into the fruit. Add a grated 
lemon to each quart. This is not absolutely necessary, but is an 
Improvement ; the custard is rather insipid without it. Let this 
let at least two hours before using. Strain the fruit, pressing it 
through a sieve. Use a pint of juice to a pint of custard. The 
color may be heightened by adding to the juice a little prepared 
cochineal ; add more sugar if not sufficiently sweet. For pine- 
apple custard, grate the fruit after peeling; it is better if one 
grated lemon is used to each pineapple. Soft peaches may be 
used, mashing and rubbing 1hem through a sieve ; mix wiih the 
cream or custard, and freeze. Apricots, apples, etc., 01 any fruit 
liked, may be grated or cooked, and then mashed, sweetened, and 
stirred to the cream or custard ; let it remain until the flavor is 
sufficiently imparted, then strain, and put to freeze. The extracts 
fcrd syrups of these fruits afford a good substitute when the fresh 
fruit cannot be procured. If a richer custard is preferred, use 
either of the three gn en in the receipts for bo led custards. The 
white custard is particularly fine when frozen. Flavor to taste, 
the flavoring giving the name to the custard. 



793. Milk Sherbet. — Sweeten, and flavor the milk to taste;

three lemons (first roll the lemons before squcezirg) to eaci 
gallon of milk; add a little of the extract of lemon. Stir at 
together well; flavor the milk by boiling the peel in it; then 
when cold, freeze. 



794. Lemon- Water Ice. — Rub lumps of sugar upon the rind. 

f four lemons until a pound of loaf sugar is used ; pour over it & 
quart of water ; squeeze in the juice. Freeze, or make a lemon 
ode, sweeter than when not intended to freeze, and more highly 
flavored. Freeze, and serve in glasses. 



795. Orange-Water Ice — Is made in the same way as the 
lemon-water ice, using less sugar, and if the oranges are very 
sweet, use one lemon to four large oranges. After these prepara- 
tions are nearly frozen stiff, stir into a quart the whites of two 
eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Mix thoroughly. Serve in glasses 
Any kind of fruit ices may be prepared by adding to the watei 
any syrup or jam of the fruit desired. Grate apples, sweeten, 
and freeze them ; mash soft peaches, freeze them, and any kind 
of fruit liked. 



796. Sherbet. — To six lemons and eight sweet oranges, sliced 
and the seed removed, put one gallon of water, and sweeten to 
taste. Freeze, or use ice. 



797. Wine Ices — Are made by taking as much lei&onade as is 
required for freezing, making it not quite so highly flavored as 
for lemon ice — omitting one lemon, and adding cUret or Sherry 
to taste. Add Jamaica rum to the lemonade and you h&Tt 
Boman punch. Freeze, or use ice. 



797J. Pine-Apple Ice. — Peel and grate om /arge pineHtppla 
•^d enough water to make, including tl e fruit, tw > quarts, sweeten- 
well and freeze stiff. Wrap a hot napkin around the mnrjidjuat

renders them mure pleasing. Thus God resembles a tender 
father, who provides not only for the support, but also for the 
pleasures of his children. 



798. To Prepare the Pineapple for the Table. — An old writer 
(Sturm) says of this fruit: "That pride of vegetable life, and 
compendium of all the blandishments of taste — the pineapple." 
Peel them ; slice thin ; pile in layers, sprinkling between each 
layer powdered loaf sugar. A pound of sugar to a pound of 
fruit. Let this stand, an hour or two before using. Some per- 
sons add wine. I protest against the adding of a single thing. 
" Loveliness needs not the foreign aid of ornament." Pineapples 
are best sliced lengthwise, so as to avoid the centre, which is 
hard and tasteless. 



790. Ambrosia — Is made by placing upon a glass stand; n 
other deep vessel, alternate layers of grated cocoanut, orange? 
peeled and sliced round, and a pineapple sliced thin. Begin with 
the oianges, and use cocoanut last, spreading between each layei 
■uW loaf sugar. Sweeten the cocoanut milk, and pour over. 



800. Snow. — Cocoanut grated; ornament with box- vine, oi 
•nah bits of deep red jelly. 



801. Oranges. — A pretty style of preparing oranges for thi 
tabic is to cut the rind through with a sharp penknife into quar- 
ters taavuw the pulp whole. Peel off the rind, leaving it at 'ached

as to form a cup-like receptacle for the fruits. Heap this Id 
stutids, and ornament with orange l«j»ves, or some other bright, 
flossy leaves : 

802 Bananas. — Strip them ; serve upon a flat dish, donoo* 
iiaes used with cream. 



803, Peaches and Cream. — Peel soft juicy peaches, quarter 
them, put a layer of peaches, one of sugar, sprinkling it on very 
thick until the desired quantity is prepared. Spread thickly over 
the last layer of peaches powdered loaf sugar. Set the dish upon 
ice or in a very cool place an hour before using ; do not bruise 
them. Some persons like them best mashed fine, sweetened, and 
a little grated nutmeg added ; in either way serve in small deep 
plates; eat with rich cream. 



804. Raspberries and Strawberries — Are also delicious. Cap 
them, wash very little ; they must not be allowed to remain in 
the water a moment longer than necessary. Put layers of ths 
feuit and powdered loaf sugar in glass stands. The fruit will will 
after the sugar is put upon them ; this is particularly the case with 
strawberries. If they are to be kept several hours, it is best not 
to cap them (always wash them before capping) until an hour 
before they are to be served. 

805. A Pretty Dish. — Pare and core, without splitting, some 
amall-sized tart apples; boil them gently with one lemon for 
every six apples until a straw will pass through them. Make a 
yyrup of half a pound of loaf sugar for each pound of appl?s; 
put the apples in unbroken, and the lemons sliced, and boil 
gectly until the apples look clear. Take them up care.fi lly, so as 
not to break them; add an ounce or more of clarified isinglass 
to the syrup, and let it boil up. Put the apples in a glass stand 
with a slice of lemon over each, and when the syiup is nearlj 
cold, strain it over them. Eat with thick cream.

ritermelon makes a very showy appearance if cut through the 
mddle, crosswise, in points. Cut a piece off each end so as to 
jive both halves a level base to stand upon. 



807. Breakfast Fruits. — Grapes, figs, and cantelopes are nice 
oreaKlast fruits, and may be served in this way : Remove the first 
nourse, and the white cloth; if the table is not a handsome one, it 
should be covered with a wine cloth, under the white tablecloth ; 
always send colored doylies with fruit. Grapes may be tastily 
arranged witli their leaves. Finger-bowls should be placed before 
each person, to be used after the fruit course is finished. 



SOS Lemon Cream. — The yolks ul seven eggs beat very light. 
Seven tablespoonfuls of sugar, one wine-glass of wine, the juice 
of a lemon, the grated rind of two. Put on the tire. It is 
safest to put the bucket in which custards ar j boiled in a pan of 
boiling water, keep the water which surrounds the custard boil- 
ing ; there is less danger of its curdling or burning when boiled 
in this way ; stir until the thickness of rich cream. Beat the 
Tfhites to a stiff froth, stir the custard through it. Serve in cus- 
tard glasses, or line a glass dish with stale 01 stou^e cake tatui

808J. Courtship and Matrimony. — Make ice-cream^ and 
trith it fresh soft, or canned peaches ; freeze all together. 



809. Gelatine Jelly — Mrs. W.'s Receipt. — One box of Cox 5 t 
gelatine, two quarts of water, one pint of wine, two lemons, cue 
cj'iart of sugar, one and a half sticks of cinnamon, one and a half 
jozen cloves, two blades of mace, the beaten whites and shells of 
six eggs ; stir till it boils. Let it boil thirty minutes, and straia 
through a Canton flannel bag. 

Cox's sparkling gelatine is a superior article, and the direc- 
tions, which are very good, always accompany the packages. 



810. Lemon Jelly. — One ounce of the best isinglass, one and • 
half pounds of loaf sugar, three lemons (pulp, skin, and juice), re- 
moving the seed. Pour on the isinglass a quart of boiling -vater ; 
stir into this the lemon ; add a glass of the best Sherry or Madi ira 
wwie. Strain into moulds. If the lemons are not fresh, add a 
little tartaric acid. If this does not congeal, dissolve, and add 
more isinglass. 

Orange jelly is made in the same way, using oranges instead 
of lemons. 



811. Wine Jelly. — One ounce of Cox's Sparkling gelatine, ont 
pound of loaf sugar. Dissolve the gelatine in a pint of boiling 
wat»r; add the sugar and a quart of white wino. Stir the mix 
ture very hard, and pour it into a mould. When it has con- 
gealed, wrap the mould in a cloth dipped in warm water ; tin u 
out the jelly, and eat with cream. 



812. Mane-Mange. — Take a pint of jelly after it Is prepared ; 
melt it, and mix with the yolks of six eggs well beaten, with two 
tablespoonfuls of sifted loaf sugar; put it into the kettle ag^in,

and let it jiut come, to a boil. Tour it into a monl I, and set in 
a cool place, and stir for some time to prevent its curdling. JW 
with cream or custard, flavored with lemons. First make a pint. 
of jelly, then add the eggs. 



813. Blanc-3fange, No. 2. — One measure of jelly after it if 
prepared, and one of cream. After they are melted together, 
flavor with sugar and wine to taste. Let it boil up once, and 
poui into moulds. Wet the moulds with cold water before using. 



814. Carrageen or Irish Moss Blanc-Mange. — Pick and wash 
thoroughly one cup of Irish moss; pour to it one quart of milk. 
Sweeten to taste. Let it boil until it thickens ; strain through a 
thin cloth, and pour into a mould. Very little boiling is nece* 
»ary. Eat with sweetened cream or with custard. 



815. Corn Starch Blanc-Mange. — Four or five tablespoonfuls of 
starch to one quart of milk; beat the starch thoroughly with two 
eggs, and add it to the milk, when near boiling, with a little salt; 
boil a few minutes, stirring it briskly. Flavor with rose, lemon, 
or vanilla, and cool in small cups or wineglasses. When cold 
and stiff, turn into a glass stand. Sweeten it while cooking, oj 
use a sauce of sugar and cream. 

Farina blano-mange is made in the same way. Set on ice if 
convenient. 



816. Arrowroot Blanc- Mange. — A teacupful of arrowroot wet 
up to a paste with a little cold water. Boil a quart of mil J. and 
pour to the arrowroot, stirring it well. Boil again until it 
thickens, and pour into cups or moulds. Flavor and sweeten tc 
taste before boiling the second time. By the addition of a few 
eggs, and a little butter, this makes a very nice custaii, baked in 
• rich paste. 

Potato starch may be used in the same way. 



816 MRS. HILL'S NEW COOK l.^CK. 

817. Isinglass Blanc-Mange An ounce of ishiglaas (in warn 

woather an ounce and a quarter) ; dissolve in a pint :>f boiling 
water. Let it stand until cold ; add a quart of milk and a stick 
of cinnamon. Boil until the isinglass is dissolved; sweeten and 
flavor to taste, and turn into ?«^ulds. Wet the moulds with cold 
water before pouring in the blanc-mange ; it will turn out better. 



818. Ice Pudding (A Delicious Dessert). — Make a rich boiled 
custard of a pint of milk, pint of cream, yolks of eight eggs ; 
sweeten to taste. Beat smooth, adding rose-water, a quarter of 
a pound of sweet and bitter almonds ; mix a quarter of a pound 
of raisins seeded, the same of currants, half as much citron and 
preserved orange peel ; flour these well. Pour the custard hot 
over the fruit ; mix well. When cool, add a pint of whipped and 
drained syllabub. Put it into any kind of mould of pretty shape, 
and freeze it. Serve with custard or syllabub sauce ; flavor and 
nweeten to taste. 



819. Fruit Jellies — Should be made with the best loaf sugar. 
The pulverized sugar is more or less adulterated. The fruit 
should be of good quality, and free from defects. Jellies should 
be made in a brass kettle, or in iron lined with porcelain. When 
brass is used, great pains should be taken to keep the kettle per 
i\ elly bright and clean. Jellies are best kept in tumblers, cups, ot 
sinali moulds. The vessels should not be quite filled. Letter 
paper or tissue paper, cut to fit the top, should be wet in a little 
brandy, and laid on the jelly in the mould. Thicker paper should 
be cut of a little larger size, and pasted with the white of an egg 
over the tops of the moulds. Put up in this way, the jelly will 
koep for years. It should be set in a dry, cool place. 

Tc know when jelly is done, diop a teaspoonful in cold water. 
If it drops clear frc m the spoon, and becomes of a proper consist- 
ency, take it off imirediately. Should it unfortunately become 
ropy from boiling too long, it can be used to a very good purpos* 
<br preparing summer drinks, nectars, water ices, etc.

820. Apple Jelly. — Use apples of a pleasant acid. Pee and 
core them, and, as you cut them, throw the pieces immediately 
into cold water, to prevent their being discolored by the action of 
the air. When you h^ve prepared as many as you wish to use, 
put them into the preserving-kettle, and pour over them just 
enough water to cover them. Cover closely with a plate, and let 
fciera boil without interruption until the apples are soft; then 
strain through a thin linen bag into some vessel that can be kept 
oorered. The proportion for making the jelly : To two tumbler? 
of the juice use one tumbler and a half of loaf sugar, pulverized. 
Measure the juice and the sugar in this proportion, and put into 
the kettle. Let this syrup boil for a few minutes; then strain 
through a jellybag. Return to the kettle two tumblerfuls of th* 
syrup; this, boiled to the proper consistency, will form one turn 
blerful of jelly. After preparing the juice, and measuring the 
proportions, it is safe to make the jelly thus in small quantities. 

Quince jelly is made in the same way. Never use the cores 
and seeds, as the effect of these is to cause the jelly to rope. 

Strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and grapes, all make 
very pleasant jellies. After washing the fruit, put it on to boil 
without any water, and when the juice is all extracted, strain and 
proceed as in apple jelly. 

821. Crab Apple Jelly. — Wash the fruit and remove the stems 
and all defective parts. Cover them with boiling water, and let 
them stand until the watei is cold. Put them in the Kettle 
cover with water, and turn a plate closely over them ; proceeding 
in all respects as in the apple jelly, excepting that, being a very 
acid fruit, they require equal proportions of the juice and sugar 
This jelly is nice to serve with bake 3 or roast meats, is also is a 
jelly made from the wild plum. In straining the juice, never 
squeeze the bag ; only take that which runs clear for rte first 
quality of jelly. 



822. Orange Jelly.-— 'Use large oranges. From the stem end 



318 Mrs. hill's NEW COOK COOK. 

cut a piece of rind about as large as a ten -cent piece; insert the 
handle of a spoon, and with this remove all the pulp. Throw the 
rinds into saltwater — they make an elegant preserve. From f he 
pulp remove carefully all the seed, and then strain cut the ju ce. 
To every quart of juice add an ounce of Cox's sparkling gehtine 
iissolved in a little boiling water. For the sweet orange?, use 
iugai in the same proportion as in making apple jelly ; for boui 
oranges, use a pound of sugar to a pint of the juice. 



PRESERVES, ETC. 

Foe n a king preserves, a good quality of fruit should ... .*ay 
t<6 used, and good sugar. If loaf sugar is used, it will not require 
clarifying. For many of the small, dark -colored fruits, good 
brown sugar answers very well, and may be clarified for use in 
this way : To two pounds of sugar add a pint of water and the 
white of one egg. Stir all well together when first put into the 
kettle; after that it must not be stirred. Let it boil until the 
syrup looks clear, carefully skimming off the dross. Strain 
through a thin muslin cloth. In preparing the fruit, it should be 
thrown into water as fast as peeled, to prevent its being dis- 
colored by contact with the air. The usual proportion in making 
preserves, is a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. There are a 
few fruits which require more sugar. In making the syrup, use 
a tumblerful of water to a pound of fruit. The syrup should 
always be boiled and strained before putting the fruit in it. 



823. Oranges Preserved Whole. — After removing the pulp and 
juice, as in the directions for making orange jelly, throw the 
rinds in weak salt and water for twelve hours. Then take them 
out and boil them in clear water until tender, taking great cai>» 
not to break them. (The more full) to prevent this, but tew 
should be boiled at a time during the whole process.) Tor 
making your syrup, use the best loaf ^u^ar, in the proportion of 
a pound and a half to a pound of the fruit. Put the sugar in :h« 
Kettle, and cover with cold water. When it has boiled sufficients 
fc> form a thin syrup, pour it, boiling hot, ever the fruit, ana sol 
it away to stand twelve hours. Boil again, this time boiling th^ 
fruit for about half an hour. Pour the syrup over again, and let 
rt remain twelve hours. Then return all to the kettle until »he 
fruit is fully penetrated with the syrup and looks clear. Pat up 



820 MR8. dill's new cook book. 

in glass jars, and should the syrup appear thin after standing 
several weeks, boil again. 

Lemons can be preserved in the same way. 



824. Citron Preserves. — Take the citron melon ; if not verj 
large, cut through the melon crosswise in slices about a quart*.) 
t f an inch thick ; remove the outer rind and the seed, and noti i 
the edge tastily. If the melon is too large for this, cut the siica 
of a convenient size. After preparing the slices, soak them for 
twelve hours in lime water (made by dissolving two hmdfuls of 
lime in three gallons of water), changing the pieces twice from 
top to bottom. Then soak in clear water, changing the water 
twice; then scald in alum water. Now place in the bottom of 
the preserving-kettle a layer of grape leaves, upon this a layer of 
citron, then a layer of the leaves, and so on until you have put in 
all your citron, with a layer of leaves on top. Pour in enough 
water to cover them, and boil for half an hour; then take out the 
citron, and plunge into cold water. Boil again with the lay era 
of grape leaves, and plunge again into the cold water. Repeat 
this several times ; then boil, for half an hour, in a moderately 
strong ginger tea. 

To make the syrup: Use a pound and a half of loaf sugar to a 
pound of citron. After boiling, strain it boiling hot upon the 
fruit, and let it stand. The next morning boil until the citron is 
clear and tender. Citron should never be eaten until it is at least 
a mon'h old. Watermelon rind, peeled and cut into fanciful 
thapes, may be preserved in the same way. Musk melons, fulli 
rij e, are sometimes used. They should be cooked without soak 
big removing the inside soft part and the outside rind. 



825. Glass Melon. -Gather the melons when fully grown, bul 
Dtfore they tirn yellow; scrape off the green part of the rind, 
and cut a small piece from the stem end of the melon. With 
the handle of a small teaspoon remove the contents : scald there

PRESERVES, ETC. 321 

eold. Scald them again in fresh water, boiling a few miiiUtes; 
pJunge again in cold water ; repeat this four times. Make a th'm 
syrup, allowing one pound and a half of loaf sugar to a pound of 
the melon. Scald the fruit in this; pour all into a tureen of 
deep covered dish; let it remain one night; next mornitg retuixs 
*n the kettle. Slice one lemon to two poui ds of citron; iemovt 
he seed, and boil with the melons until they are tender. 



826. Pineapple Preserves. — Wash the fruit and boil, without 
paring, until they are tender. Take them out, pare them, and 
slice lengthwise, so as to remove the hard centre. Make a s\rup, 
using a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit; pour it, when boiling 
hot, over the fruit, and let it stand until the next morning. Then 
pour off the syrup from the fruit, and boil it until nearly thick 
enough, when the fruit must be put in and boiled in the syrup 
for fifteen or twenty minutes. 



827. To Preserve Strawberries. — Take the weight of the straw 
berries in double-refined sugar. To each pound add a quarter of 
a pint of water ; boil to a thick syrup. When it cools, pour it 
over the berries, and let them stand all night. Next morning 
boil the syrup and fruit ten minutes. Repeat this process for 
three days in succession. As the syrup becomes thinned by the 
acid juice which exudes from the strawberries, there would be 
danger of fermentation unless re-boiled as directed. 

As this fruit is difficult to preserve from fermentation, it should 
be put up in air-tight cans or in small jars, «md very carefully tied 
or sealed up. Keep them in \ cool place. 



828. To Preserve Raspberries and Blackberries. — J* or these 
ft-uits use an equal proportion of sugar. To each pound of the 
tugar add about a wineglass of water, and boil to a thick syrup* 
Put the fruit in, and let it boil for fifteen minutes ; take it out 
*ith a perforated skimmer ; spread on dishes, and let them stand 
la the sun. When the syrup has boiled to a proper cousistenoj, 
14* 



£22 MR8. HILLS NEW COOK BOCK. 

put tfie fruit in small jars, wic pour the syrup over. Seal tightly 
Small delicate fruits such as raspberries, black berrie * 5 etc., •'equir* 
very little cooking. Long boiling impairs their flavor, and ren 
ders them hard. 



629. To Preserve Cherries. — With a goose-quill, sharpened U 
t pcint as for a pen, remove the stones from a part of the fruit 
that you wish to use. Prepare a syrup in the same proportioni 
as directed in the foregoing receipts, and when nearly thick 
enough, add the fruit, and allow it to boil briskly for thirty 
minutes ; then remove with a perforated skimmer, and let the 
syrup continue to boil until of a proper consistency. Then pour 
over the fruit, and put up as directed in preceding receipts. 

The reason for stoning part of the cherries, is that the seed 
contain so much Prussic acid that to allow them all to remain 
would impart too strong a flavor to the preserves. 



830. To Preserve Grapes. — Grapes are preserved in the same 
way, without seeding them. Select, for preserving, fruit that is 
not entirely ripe, carefully removing all that are defective. The 
Scuppernongs are very nice. 



831, To Preserve Plums. — For large, fine plums, that you 
wish to make particularly nice, remove the skins by scalding 
them. Make a syrup in the proportion of a pound of sugar to 
one of fruit, and when thick, pour it boiling hot over the fruit, 
and let it stand until the succeeding day. Repeat this for thiee 
successi ve days. On the third day put in the fruit and boil unti 
tfiey are done. This mode of preserving is preferred on account 
of the fruit breaking to pieces if preserved immediately. The 
ooiling syrup poured upon them hardens the fruit. 

Plums and damsons may be preserved in the same way witfc 
the skins on, and are very suitable for tarts and tartlets. 



R32. To Preserve Muscadines. — Wash the fruit carefully, 



PRESERVES, ETC. 323 

pulp them. They are prettier with the seeds removed, but the 
process is a tedious one. Collect the j iice carefully with the 
pulps, and reserve the hulls for making vinegar, or for preserving 
%ith brown sugar for winter pie?. 

Make a syrup in the usual proportion — pound for pound 
Put in the fruit, and boil until it looks clear. 



833. Crab Apple Preserve. — Boil for a «hort time in clear 
water. Be careful not to boil too long, as the fruit mashes very 
easily. Just as soon as they are soft enough to admit of remov- 
ing the cores with a goose-quill, push them out. Soak, for one 
night, in weak alum water; from this, soak in clear water for two 
hours. Make a syrup in the proportion of one and a half pound 
of sugar to one of fruit ; put the fruit in, and let it boil until it 
looks clear. Take them out, and if the syrup is not thick enough, 
continue boiling until it is of proper consistency. 



834. To Preserve Figs. — Take the fruit when not quite ripe 
Soak for ten or fifteen minutes in weak, warm soda water to re- 
move the skin ; or peel thinly with a sharp penknife. To one 
pound of figs use three-quarters of a pound of sugar. When the 
syrup is made, put in the fruit, and let it boil until half done ; 
take them up, and spread on a dish, and put in the sun. Let the 
syrup simmer slowly, always carefully removing any impurities 
that may rise to the surface. When clear, put in the figs ; let 
them cook until transparent, taking them out separately when 
done. Set in the sun again; if the syrup is not clear, &'rim again; 
do not let it boil away too much. Put the figs in jars, and when 
the syrup is cold, pour it over them.

halves, throwing immediately into cold water to prevent theii 
turning dark. Weigh the sugar in the pr< portion of pourd foi 
pound, and put down in alternate layers to remain a11 night. (It 
is best to prepare them late in the evening, and preserve earl) 
next morning.) In the morning, pour off the syrup, and clarify 
Lj using the white of an egg to a quirt of juice. Skim while 
boiling, and strain through a thin cloth. Put in the fruit. 
Have ready a few peach kernels blanched, and put in with the 
fruit. Cover lightly witfe an earthen plate, and let them simmer 
gently until the peaches are clear, removing the plate occasion- 
ally to turn the fruit from the bottom. When done, take the 
peaches up, and spread on dishes, and set in the sun half an hour, 
letting the syrup continue to boil until thick enough. The peach 
mentioned in the beginning of this receipt is the variety that I 
prefer for preserving. The white English and the yellow cling- 
stone are also very fine for this purpose. In cutting the fruit, 
take care to have the slices of a uniform thickness, or the thin 
ner slices will boil to pieces before the thicker ones are done. 



83€> To Preserve Quinces. — Wash the fruit; peel it, and as 
you peel, throw in cold water. Cut in slices of uniform thick- 
ness ; put them in a kettle, and cover with water ; turn a plate 
over them, and let them stew until tender. Take them out, and 
into the water (allowing a tumbler of the water to a pound of 
sugar) in which they were stewed put the sugar in the proportion 
of pound for pound. Unless loaf sugar is used the syrup will 
need clarifying. Skim off the impurities, and when the syrup is 
clear put in the fruit; cover again with the plate and simmer 
gently until done. Take up with a perforated skimmer and 
spread on dishes to cool. Quinces will be very hard unless 
tewed before the sugai is added. 



837. Pear Preserver. — Throw the pears into water as you peel 
them. Remove the cores or rot as may be preferred. Preserve 
axActly as you would quinces. 



MARMALADES, JAMS, ETC. 

It pu* up in small quantities, and for immediate use, three 
quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit is sufficient; but 
if it is desirable to keep them longer, a pound of sugar is a better 
proportion. As in preserves, the best sugar should be used. 



838. Orange Marmalade. — For this, use the pulp that has been 
removed previous to preserving the rinds ; carefully pick out all 
the seeds. If the oranges are sweet, three quarters of a pound 
of sugar is sufficient to a pound of fruit — for the sour orange 
equal proportions will be required. Mix the fruit and sugai 
well ; add half a tumblerful of water to a pound of sugar, and 
boil for half an hour, stirring a great deal to prevent their burn- 
ing. A little of the peel, boiled in clear water, and shredded very 
fine before adding to the mass, gives an improved flavor to this 
marmalade. 



839. Apple Marmalade. — Peel and slice the apples ; weigh and 
put them into a kettle, and stew until tender. Mash them fine ; 
add the sugar in the proportion of pound to pound. Let thera 
cook slowly, stirring very frequently. By no means allow it to 
scorch, and when the mass has a jellied appearance, it is done. 
About half an hour will generally be found sufficient for making 
the marmalade, after adding the sugar. 



840. Quince and Peach Marmalade — Are made in the same 
way. They should be put up in tumblers, or very small jars. 
They are very good for tarts and tartlets. 



841. Strawberries. Raspberries, Blackberries and Grape*— AW 
make nice marmalade or jam. 



326 Mrs. kill's new jock book, 

842 Compote of Apples. — To one pound of fn.it> peeled and 
eliced, add one pound of sugar. Boil until the apples can be 
pierced with a straw. Take the fruit out, and place in a glasi 
or other deep dish. Add to the sv rup half an ounce of gelatine 
to 3 pound of the fruit, and boil for ten or fifteen minutes. Pour 
•t e. the fruit when cool enough. The gelatine is not absolutely 
lecessary, but it is a great improvement. Oranges may be dv*n 
.a the same way. Compotes may be made of small fruits, such 
as plums, apricots, damsons, etc., without peeling. They an 
delicious, and may be used as desserts, served with cream o* 
mock-cream sauce. 



843. Frosted Fruit. — Select perfect fruit of any small variety, 
such as cherries, plums, grapes, or small pears, leaving the stems 
on. Dip them, one by one, in the beaten white of an egg, or is 
a solution of gum Arabic, and from that into a cup of very finely 
pulverized sugar. Cover the bottom of a pan with a sheet of 
fine white paper ; place the fruit in it, and set in a stove oi 
oven that is cooling. When the frosting on the fruit becomes 
firm, heap them on a dish, and set in a cool place. 



844. Apple or Gooseberry Fool. — Put the fruit in a stone jar, 
with a good quality of brown sugar in the proportion of half a 
pound to a pound of the fruit. Set the pan on the stove, or in 
an oven of hot water. Put a large spoonful of water in the bot* 
torn of the jar to prevent burning. When they are soft, pass 
them through a sieve. Have ready one teacup of new milk, the 
same of cream, boiled together, and left to cool. Sweeten the- 
mustard, and by degrees add the fruit. Nice dish for tea. 



845. To Bake Apples or Quinces. — Core them, and fill the 
cavities with nice sugar. Sprinkle the outsides with sugar, and 
to a large dish containing a dozen, add a tumblerful of "water. 
Bet them to bake slowly. They may be served with meats, ot 
as a dessert, with cream sauce. Use them cold. 



MARMALADkrS, JAMS, ETC. 321 

Pears are very niee baked in the same way; but, being a 
rather insipid fruit, it is best to squeeze over them the juice of • 
lemon, throwing the peel into the water that is added to them. 



846. Stewed Peaches. — Peaches also make a nice de sert, bu 
a/e better stewed, peeling them, and removing the stones or rot* 
as is preferred. These methods of preparing fruit are also niea 
for tea. Serve with them cream or mock-cream sauce. 



847. Candied Orange and Lemon Peel. — Remove the pulp and 
inside skin ; cut the peel in strips lengthwise ; boil in clear water 
until tender. Make a syrup in the proportion of half a pound of 
sugar to a pound of the peel, adding to the sugar as much water 
as will melt it. Put in the peel, and boil over a slow fire until 
the syrup candies; then take them out; strew powdered sugar 
over them, and set in the sun to dry ; or, if the weather will not 
admit of this, dry them in a warm oven or stove. These will be 
found very useful in making fruit cakes and puddings. 



848. Peach Chips. — Peel good peaches, not too ripe, as in that 
case the chips will be very dark when dried. Slice the peachet 
very thin ; have ready prepared a syrup made in the proportion 
of half a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit, and water enough to 
melt the sugar ; the syrup must be very thick. Put in the chips, 
and scald them well. Remove them with a perfc rated skimmer, 
and dry in the sun. After they are dry, pack closely in jari, 
sprinkling finely powdered sugar between the layers. This pre- 
paration well supplies the place of raisins in making fruit pud 
dings, and plain family fruit cakes. 



849. Peach Leather. — Peel very ripe, soft peaches ; rnash them 
fine, and strain through a colander. If the peaches aie not very 
•weet, add a little sugar. Butter well panes of glass, and spread 
the paste smoothly upon them. Put in the sun to dry ; when 
dry on one side., turn it, and when perfectly dry, roll and keep in 



82& iir8. hill'b new cook book. 

boxes. When not convenient to use the glass, batter strips o* 
cloth, and spread upon well-seasoned boards. 



850 To Dry Figs. — Take ripe figs ; dip them in moderately 
strong soda-water, and wipe them. Have ready a syrup made 
>f half a pound of sugar to a pound of the fruit. When it b 
thick, drop the figs in, and let them scald well. Take them up 
snd place then, in a dish with the stems up. With the bottom 
of another dish or plate press them gradually to a flat shape 
sprinkle them with fine sugar, and set in the hot sun. Turn them 
with a knife, and sprinkle again with sugar. When dry, pack in 
boxes or jars, with sugar between the layers of figs. M the 
weather is damp, dry in a warm oven or stove. 



851. Tomato Figs. — Use thoroughly ripe tomatoes ; pour boil 
ing water over them to remove the skin; weigh them; place 
them in a stone jar, with an equal quantity of good sugar. I*et 
them stand two days; then pour off the syrup; boil and skim it 
until no scum rises. Pour it over the tomatoes ; let it stand *.m o 
days ; boil, and skim again. After repeating this process for the 
third time, they are fit to dry, if the weather suits ; if not, keep 
them in the syrup. They will dry in a week. Pack in boxes 
lined with white paper, putting powdered sugar between the 
layers of fruit. Should any syrup remain, it may be used for 
making common marmalade, or for sweetening pies. 



852. To Dry Citron or Watermelon Rind. — After preserving 
oiace in the sun, and dry. They answer well in puddings and 
takes as a substitute for the imported citron. 

853. To Dry Cherries. — Stone the fruit, and scald in a thick 
•?rup. Dry, ar d pack them away. Grapes may be done in the 
tame way, without seeding. These are very ni:e to store • aray 
for winter use, and the housekeeper who is well supplied with 
■uch articles need never be at a loss for a dessert. 



HARMALADEfi, JAMB, ETC. 82* 

854. To Slnr Dried Peaches and Apples. — Exai line the fruit 
mA\ ; wash well, rubbing it through the harois. I [>ur boiling 
water over it, and let it stand until the water cools. Put to stew 
with a little water in a preserving kettle, or a stew-pan lined with 
tin or porcelaiii ; the latter is best. Put on the cover, or turn a 
|late lightly over it, and let it stew until soft. Then mash 
through a colander; sweeten to- taste, and spice with tny thing 
preferred. Be certain never to stew fruit in an iron vessel, nor 
•et it to cool in tin. 



855. TV Save Fruit without Sugar. — Put in wide-mouthed ., 
bottles ; fill up with cold spring water. Put them in a vessel of ■ 
water up to the neck; boil half an hour; tie bladders or oil-skiD 
over tight, or cork and seal while hot. Let them set until cold. 
Keep in a cool place. Use as soon as opened. Pack hay around < 
while boiling, to steady them. 



85&£ Golden Honey. — Put five pounds- of sugar and two pints 
of water in a kettle ; bring it to a boil, and remove from the 
■tove, stir in well, two pounds of honey ;, strain the whole, bottle, 
and it will keep for years. Good. for fritters, and buckwheat. 



855f. Quaker Dish. — StDne one quart of ripe cherries; put 
a heaped teaspoonful of butter in a clean skillet. Fry when hot, 
and until the syrup is thick > adi sugar to taste, fry a ft w van 
ate* longer. 



FOR MAKING CANDIES. 

866. Sugar Candy. — To three tumblers of good br rwn eng&r, 
•dd one tumbler and a half of cold water, one tablesp^ *r.iul of good 
vinegar, and a small teaspoonful of butter. Boil without stirriug 
until it begins to rope. To pull it, begin as soon as it can be 
handled, and take hold of the mass only with the tips of the 
fingers; pull rapidly. Use no grease about the hands, or 
▼ery little. 

857, To Make Ground Pea Candy. — Parch, shell, and beat the 
peas. Take up the candy before it has boiled as much as in the 
first receipt, and use more butter ; stir while boiling. When 
poured out, mix in the peas. Almonds and grated cocoanut may 
be used. 



858. Cocoanut Candy. — Use equal quantities of loaf sugar and 
grated cocoanut ; add enough milk of the cocoanut to moisten the 
sugar. Put it to boil, and stir almost constantly. When the candy 
begins to turn to sugar, stir in the cocoanut as quickly as possi- 
ble. Pour it into buttered dishes. Cut while warm with a but 
tered knife. Parched ground peas (beat) may also be used. 



859. Molasses Candy. — Half a gallon of West India molasses 
one pound of sugar, a teaspoonful of essence of lemon, the juice 
of two large lemons (but this must not be added bo tore the 
candy is nearly done) ; add the rind of one when the molasses is firs 
put to boil ; stir occasionally. Boil steadily three hours, oi 
until upon cooling some on a plate it will be found stiff enougk. 
Pour it off; pull as the sugar candy. Flavor with ginger, if A it 
preferred to lemon 



FOR MAKING CANDIES. 33 J 

860. Toffie. — One pound of loaf sugar, three ounces S butter, 
Mid ihe grated rind of one lemon. Boil a quarter of an hour; 
pour into dishes slightly buttered. Cut in strips with a buttered 
knife, but do not attempt to raise them until cold. 

A pound of thin shelled almonds will yield half a pound 
*hen shelled; if very thick shelled, it will require mc:e. 



861. To Make Almond Macaroons. — Half a pound of shelled 
almonds, a quarter of a pound of butter, the whites of three eggs ; 
twenty-fbur large teaspoonfuls of powdered loaf sugar, a wine- 
glass of rose-water, a large teaspoonful of mixed mace and cinna- 
mon. Blanch and beat the almonds the day before they are 
needed. Beat and sift the spice. Beat the eggs stiff; add to 
them gradually a teaspoonful at a time until all is in ; beat 
hard; add the spice, dissolved in the rose-water; then the 
almonds. It should now look like a soft dough ; if too soft, add 
a few more almonds. When mixed, take a little flour in the 
palm of the hand ; take up a small lump with a knife ; roll it on 
the flour in your hand into a ball; flatten it slightly. Have 
ready a long shallow tin pan buttered ; lay the macaroons on it 
as they are formed ; place them about two inches apart. Bake 
in a moderate oven eight or ten minutes, or until a pale brown 
color. The top of the oven should be hotter than the bottom. 
If baked too much they become very hard, and lose their flavor 
if too little, they will be heavy. They should rise, and 
crack open somewhat. Grated cocoanut iray be substituted foi 
almonds. 



861 J. Candy. — One quart of molasses, one pint of sugar, one 
good tablespoonful of butter; boil half an hour over a slow lure; 
one quart of ground peas, parched and shelled. Boil quarter of 
an hour ; pour into shallow dishes. 

861 f. Taffy. — Fill a quart boiler with sugar, leaving room for 
It to boil ; moisten the sugar with molasses, a heaped teaspoon- 
ful of butter; the juice of a lemon. Flavor with tuo jied, or 



TV, CAN FRUIT AND VEGETABLES. 

"The chief ager* in the work of preservation is heat, li aftst 
(he application of heat for a certain time (by which process l\n 
•ir is expelled) the article be sealed up hermetically, it will re 
main unchanged for an indefinite period." 

" The fruit and vegetables should be canned as early as possible 
after being gathered. 

'■ How to know that the can is hermetically sealed and that the 
contents will keep : The contents, as soon as they cool, wiV 
slightly shrink, leaving a vacuum, and the top and bottom of th« 
cart will become concave from the pressure of the external air. 
This shows that the sealing is complete. Set the can in a warm 
place, and if, after four or five days, the concave condition of the 
top and bottom remain, all is right." 

Peaches should be peeled ; if they are clear-stone, halve them ; 
if cling-stone, cut in slices of uniform size. As you cut tnem 
throw them into water; first, however, weighing them. With 
sugar in the proportion of half a pound to a pound of the fruit, 
put them in a vessel, the fruit and sugar in alternate lay ere 
(seme persons prefer less sugar; enough, however, must be used 
to make them palatable). Let them stand until all the sugar ia 
dissolved. Then put all into a preserving-kettle, and let them 
remain until the fruit is thoroughly penetrated with heat; sav,for 
half an hour. While the fruit is boiling hot, fill the cans, and 
eeal immediately. 

To can quinces it is necessary that the fruit, after being 
pared and cut into pieces of uuiform size, should be bo^ed in 
clear wate* until slightly tender. In the water in which they 
were boiled (allowing half a tumbler to a pound of sugar) 
dissolve sugar in the pi >portion of half a pound to a pound 
of the fruit. As soon as the sugar is dissolved, and the syrup

Degins to boil, return the quinces to the kettle, and boil for 
fifteen minutes. Can them while boiling hjt, sealing imrwodi 
ately. Pears may be done in the same way. 

Smaller fruits — raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, cur 
rants, etc., are done as follows: Pick and wash the fn.it, care 
faUy. and weigh, allowing to a pound of fruit half a pound <A 
iilgar or Jess. Put the fruit and sugar in alternate layers in a 
▼easel, and allow them to stand for one hour. Then put tliem 
In the preserving-kettle, and boil for ten minutes. While boil- 
ing hot, can and seal immediately. Use no water; they yield 
•ufficient juice. 

Corn, peas, and ochra should be boiled for half an hour in just 
•ufficient water to cover them. Can and seal while boiling hot. 

Of course the corn is cut ofT the cob before boiling. Aapar 
agus will require boiling but fifteen minutes. Tomatoes should 
be scalded just enough to allow of removing the skins ; cher 
ooiled for half an hour in their own juice, and canned boiling hot 
[n no case should salt be added. 



8G2. To Brandy Peaches. — Use ripe fruit — not sufficiently so, 
however, to be soft. White English or yellow peaches are the 
best varieties for this purpose. Make a strong soda water, using 
two large tablespoonfuls of soda to a gallon of water. Put this 
into the preserving-kettle, and let it boil. While it is boiling, 
put in the peaches (previously weighing them), only three or four 
at a time, turning them. Let them remain long enough for th» 
akin to be easily wiped off with a coarse towel. Rub off the 
akin, and throw them into cold water. If the soda water becomes 
too weak, add a .itUe more soda. Make a syrup, using a pound 
af sugar to a pound cf fruit ; put the peaches in, and let them 
icald well ; remove them, and ouiitinue to boil the syrup until it 
tt quite thick. When the peaches are cold, put them in jars, and 
oover with peach brandy, and let them remain until the next day. 
Pour off the syrup when it becomes sufliciei tly thick. Alter the 
peaches have stood for one night, pour off the bran ly ; add the

Byrup to it ; stir well together, and return it to the r caches. Tht 
juice from the peaches will weaken the brandy, and it may I* 
necessary to add more in the course of about two weeks. 

No spices should be used in putting up the fruit ; but after the 
peaches are eaten, the liquor may be spixd, and will mak6 eicel 
Jtnt cordial.

WINES, CORDIALS, ETC. 

MS. Grape Wine. — The grapes should be gathered on a dry 
alaar day, after the morning dew has disappeared. Pick them 
carefully from the stems, selecting only ripe and perfect fruit. 
Mash them thoroughly, taking care not to bruise the seeds, as 
that would impart a bitter taste. After bruising, let the mass 
remain twenty-four hours. Strain through a colander or sieve 
taking care that there is no grease about it. Sweeten the juiofl 
(for this the crushed sugar is best) until it will float an egg so as 
to show about the size of a twenty-cent piece. Put into jugs, 
filling them, and leaving the mouths unstopped, reserving a bottle 
of the juice to replace that which escapes from the jugs by fer- 
mentation. When fermentation ceases, pour the wine olF into a 
large bowl, and clarify in the following manner : Wash sand 
(half a pint will be sufficient for five gallons of wine) until th*» 
water will run clear from it. Beat to this the whites of four eggs, 
and stir into the wine. When it has settled, and the wine looks 
perfectly clear, pour off carefully into clean jugs, putting a piece 
of muslin inside of the funnel. Cork the jugs tightly, and set in 
a cool place where they will not be disturbed until the last of 
October or first of November. 

A few days before bottling, have the bottles that you wish to 
use well-washed, dried, and sunned. Provide new corks. Have 
everything in readiness before the bottling begins, including 
xjment for sealing. Strain the ^ine again into large pitchers, 
.a king particular care not to turn the jug back after beginning to 
->i«ui from it, as it stirs up the *«diment which is at the bottom 
of ihe jug. Cover inside of <«? funnel with a piece of muslin 
before placing it in t\*e njouto . X the bottle; fill the bottle, and

light hammer. (Never use old corks.) Cover the neck of the 
bottle with cem int. Keep in a 300I, dry place. 



804. Muscadine Wine. — Gather the fruit ripe ; bruise them with 
Nit breaking the seed. (The Scuppernong grape makes wine ■ >f * 
*ea itiful Champagne color, as will also the pulp and juice cf the 
muscadines if the hulls be rejected.) Put the mass in an open 
reasel, and cover with a cloth. Stir three times during the first 
twenty-four hours. Let it stand two or three days. Draw off 
the liquor clear ; if in a wooden vessel, bore a hole near the bot 
torn, and draw off carefully, passing it through a flannel cloth ot 
bag. A dd sugar until it will float an egg to the surface. Pour 
into a vo-ssel prepared thus : Melt brimstone in an iron ladle, and 
saturate a cotton cloth with it. Set one end of the cloth on fire, 
and put it into the cask ; put in the bung lightly until the rag 
is nearly consumed ; then drive it in tightly. After the cask has 
remained thus for two or three hours, pour in the juice ; leave out 
the bung, covering the hole to keep out dust and insects. The 
cask should be entirely filled with the juice, and added to, a little 
every day, from a bottleful kept for the purpose. Do this until 
It ceases to ferment. Then drive in the bung; have a gimlet- 
hole near the bung, and stop lightly with a peg to allow the gas 
to escape. In three weeks drive in the peg. Examine in Decem- 
ber; pour into another cask similarly prepared. Repeat thin 
eome cold, clear day in March. Bottle when clear. When a 
small quantity is to be made, use jugs as in the receipt for grape 
wine. 



865. Blackberry Wine. — Use ripe berries. To every gallop 
©f the fruit pour a quart of boiling water. Let them stand 
twenty four hours. After that time, pour off the juice (pressing 
the berries) through a colander into another open vessel. Strain 
again through a flannel or Canton flannel bag, and to every gallon 
of iuioe add two and a half pounds of good, clean sugar. Stir i* 



WINE8, CORDIALS, ETC. 33*7 

up well, and put into jugs, filling them entirely. Add a Httl* 
more juice every day, from a bottleful reserved for the purpose, 
until fermentation ceases; then proceed precisely according to 
directions for making grape wine. 



806. Cider Wine, — Fifteen gallons of cider, fresh from thi 
|>ress ; to each gallon, add two pounds of good brown sugar. 
When the sugar has dissDlved. strain the mixture into a clean 
cask. Let the cask want two gallons of being full ; leave out the 
bung for forty-eight hours. Put in the bung, leaving a little vent 
until fermentation ceases ; then bung up tightly. In a year it is 
fit for use. It needs no straining ; the longer it stands upon the 
lees, the better. 



867. Tomato Wine. — Let the tomatoes be fully ripe. After 
mashing well, let them stand twenty-four hours. Then strain, 
and to every quart of the juice add one pound of good sugar. 
Let it ferment again, skimming frequently ; when clear, bottle. 
To use this, sweeten a glass of water to the taste, and add the 
tomato wine until sufficiently acid. 



868. Strawberry Cordial. — To each quart of the juice allow a 
pint of white brandy, and half a pound of loaf sugar. Let it 
•tand two weeks. Pin a piece of musl»u in the bottom of a 
■ieve ; strain, and bottle. 



869. Blackberry Cordial. — Pvl very ripe berries in a jar, 
•over th^m with good peaob t-jan 3y. Cover well with oil-cloth ; 
let it stand a week. Strain the brandy from the fruit. Sweetea 
to taste. Add spices — one teaspoon of allspice, one of cinna- 
mon, aiid the same of cloves ; do not beat the spices. Pour on 
the sugar as much of the liquor as will dissolve it ; as soon as it 
t*>ils up, pour to the rest of the liquor ; mix well, and bottle.

peaches and scald them when the sugar and spices are scalded. 
Any cordial may be made in this way. 



870. Agraz. — This is the most delicious and refreshing drir.k 
ever devised by thirsty mortal. It is made of unripe grapef 
|ounded, loaf-sugar, and water ; strained, and frozen. 



871. Muscadine Cordial. — Pulp the muscadines. A few of 
the hulls left will give the liquor a beautiful color. Let it stand 
twenty-four hours. Strain it, and to every three quarts add a 
quart of good brandy. Sweeten to taste with loaf sugar. Bot- 
tle, cork well, and keep in a cool place. 



872. Cherry Bounce. — Stone half the cherries ; fill the 
half full of the fruit, putting down a layer of fruit and a layer of 
good brown sugar in the proportion of a quarter of a pound of 
sugar to a quart of fruit. Fill the vessel with good apple oi 
French brandy ; tie it up securely. Let it remain until the 
cherries look a pale red ; then strain, and bottle. Use it by add 
ing water to taste, and more sugar if liked. This may be made 
in a jug; should be covered or stopped well, or the brandy v^ ill 
lose its strength. 

873. Crab Apple Beer. — Boil the fruit until the water is a 
pleasant acid ; strain it. To a gallon, put a piece of yeast cake 
an inch square. Sweeten to taste. Use the second day. 



874. To Keep Cider. — In the manufacture of pure cider, clean- 
liness is absolutely necessary in every step of the process. Lei 
the fruit be washed clean ; pick out all unsound ones. I*et the 
pi ess and casks be clean. Make that which is to be kept in cooJ 



WINES, CORDIALS, ETC 839 

weather. Place he casks in a cool apartment. Wlile foe fer 
mentation progresses, the casks should be full, that all impurities 
owning to the top may flow over through the bung-hole. After 
active fermentation has ceased, the cider should be drawn off 
from the settlings into other clean casks, when fermentation will 
again be active for a few days. When fermentation beg : .ns to 
cease, slarify. Stir to each barrel two ounces of isinglass, or the 
whites of four eggs. After the clearing process, which will be 
eilected in a few days, take of the sulphite (not sulphate) of lime 
a quarter of ar ounce to the gallon, which dissolve in a little of 
the cider, and thoroughly mix with the contents of the cask. 
When filled, so as to exclude all air, drive in the bung. 



875. Cherry Nectar. — To four pounds of the fruit washed and 
picked (stone half the fruit) put three tumberfuls of white wine 
or good apple vinegar. Let it stand four days. Strain through 
a Hoth, and to a pint of juice add a pound of loaf sugar. Boil in 
' porcelain kettle a quarter of an hour. When cold, bottle and 
cork it; keep in a dry, cool place. To use, pour a tumbler half 
full of the nectar ; add a few pieces of ice ; fill with very cold 
water. A refreshing summer drink. 



87b\ Raspberry Nectar. — Pour over two quarts of ripe rasp 
berries a quart of good apple vinegar. Let it stand until the 
fruit ferments; then strain, and to every pint of juice add three 
quarters o a pound of loaf sugar. Simmer twenty minutes. 

Strawberry, blackberry, etc., may be made in the same way. 
Use by half filling a tumbler, and adding ice-water. 

These nectars may be made effervescing drinks by adding to 
tne water sufficient soda. Put the \inegar in the tumbler; ponr 
in the soda-water. When the ^aste of the fruit is not distinat, 
pour off the vinogar and pour it over fresh fruit. Let it set a 
day. and strain.

layer of sugar (use two tumblers of crushed sugar) and a layei 
of thi sliced lemons; press the mass slightly; let them remain 
a q muter of an hour. Pour upon the lemons a gallon of cola 
v&ter. Stir them from the bottom ; add more sugar if not swee 
enough. Put in the glasses (if convenient) small bits of ice, am 1

Orangeade may be made in the same way of sour oranges, or if 
sweet, add two lemons to six oranges. Pomegranates al»f 
make a pleasant aoid drink, prepared from the seed, sweetening 
to taste. 



878. Sherry Cobbler. — Dash lemonade with Sherry wine; 
add ice. 



879. Lemonade an Lait. — One tumbler of lemon juice, the 
same of Sherry wine, three quarters of a pound of loaf sugar, a 
quart of boiling water ; mix, and when cold, add two tumbles 
of boiling sweet milk. Strain after it has stood twelve hours. 
Seven lemons will make a tumbler of juice. Preserve the peel, 
and dry, or infuse them in strong fourth-proof brandy, and k^ep 
it for flavoring cakes, puddings, and sauces. 

880. Cream Beer. — Take six pounds of double-refined sugar, 
four ounces of tartaric acid, and two quarts of water ; put thia 
on the fire, and when just warm, add the whites of two eggs 
beaten to a froth. It must not come to a boil. Pour it off 
through a thin cloth, without squeezing. Flavor with lemon 
Fettle, and keep in a coo", place. 

To use this: Pour mto a tumbler tw:> tablespoonfuls of thi 
■yrup; fill two-thirds full with water. Just as it is drurA, sti- 
ll) half a teaspoonful of soda. 



881. Ginger Beer (superior). — To six quarts of water add ono 
ounce of cream of tartar, and two ounces of white Jamaica ginger, 
boil it ten minutes. Strain it ; aild to the liquor a pound of loaf

•ugar. Put it on the fire ; let it simmer ur til the s Jgar is dis- 
solved. Pour into an earthen vessel, into which has been put 
two ounces of tartaric acid and the rind of one lemon. When 
lukewarm, add half a tumbler of strong hop yeast. Stir all wcl. 
together, and bottle; tie down the corks tightly. Vso in P 
few days. 



882. Ginger Beer, No. 2. — One ounce of ginger bruised and 
boiled in a gallon of water, with the peel of two lemons ; boil 
quarter of an hour. Pour out in an earthen vessel ; when cool, 
add the juice, with an ounce of cream of tartar, and one pound 
and a half of good sugar. Add another gallon of cold water, the 
whites of two eggs beaten to a froth, and stirred in when the 
water is lukewarm, and half a tumbler of good lively yeast. Let 
it ferment three hours ; then bottle, and tie the corks down. 



883. Imperial Pop. — Three ounces of cream of tartar, an ounce 
of bruised ginger, a pound and a half of loaf sugar, half a tumbler 
of lemon juice, a gallon and a half of water, a wineglass of yeast. 
Shake well together ; bottle, and cork well. 



884. Spruce Beer. — Three gallons of boiling water poured 
upon one quart of West India molasses ; mix we^. When tepid, 
add one ounce of essence of spruce, one of essence of winter 
green, and a pint of yeast. Let it stand twelve hours; bottle, 
and cork. In half a day it will be fit for use. 



885. Ginger Beer. — Boil together four galkns of water, one 
I int of hops, twenty races of ginger, beaten. Boil briskly naif an 
hour; keep the vessel covered; strain; sweeten with good mo 
lasses. When tepid, add a pint of brisk yeast. Cover it closely 
with a thick cloth until morning; then bottle, and cork tight, 
Scald the corks, and drive them in, and tie down with twine 
Keep in a cool place. It will be ready fo/ use the third day 
Less yeast may u.3cd if tne t«ste is not Uked.

88G, Cheap Beer.— -Two tablespoonfuls of fulvt:ized ginget 
one pint of hop yeast, one pint of molasses, six quarts of cold 
water; mix well, and bottle immediately ; in twenty four hours it 
may be used. 



887. Corn Beer, — Boil a quart of corn until the grains era k 
Put the grains into a jug, and pour in two gallons of boil nig 
water; do not use the water it was boiled in; add a quart of 
molasses, a handful of dried apples, and a laige tablespoonful of 
ginger. It will be ready for use in two or three days. Jf th<» 
weather is cold, set it by the fire. It may be kept up several 
weeks with the same corn, sweetening the water before pouring 
in the jug. 

888. Persimmon Beer. — One bushel of sweet, ripe persimmons, 
mashed ; half a bushel of wheat bran. Mix well, and bake in 
loaves oC good size. Break the bread in a clean barrel ; add 
twelve gallons of water ; sweeten with molasses. As soon as the 
fermentation ceases it may be bottled. Make in a warm room. 

Another way : Use the fresh fruit, putting on the bottom of a 
cask a layer of straw, then persimmons, dried apples, the honey 
locust broken up ; a little wheat bran will assist fermentation ; re- 
peat this ; fill the cask with warm water. Keep it in a warm room ; 
when it ferments it is fit for use ; draw from the cask. If the 
weather is very cold, fermentation may be hastened by putting 
hot rocks in the cask. 



889. Orange Syru}->. — Select sweet, thin-skinned oranges ; 
squeeze the juice; add sugar enough to make a thick syrup. 
Boil and skim until clear. Pour off when clear, and when cool, 
bottle. A tablespoonful in a glass of water is delicious. Flavor 
with a little of the grated rind ; put in before boiling ; a little iq 
puddirg-sauce is good. Lemons may be prepared in th«* same 
way. Flavor the sugar by rubbing lumps upon the ouis de of 
the fruit, and thcr add it to the juice, this is better than adding 
the peel. 



WINES, CORDIALS, ETC. 3431 

890. Lemon Sponge. — Dissolve one box of Cox's gelatine in 
enough boiling water to cover it; add the juice of three lcinom 
when the water is nearly cold ; rub lumps of sugar upon the out. 
§ide of the lemons until they absorb the oil from the lemon peel \ 
*dd this tc the gelatine; stir well, and sweeten to taste. Stir it 
the whites of two eggs beaten to a froth. When it looks lik 
•poiige-cake batter, put in moulds. Eat with cream. 



891. To Make Vinegar. — For a thirty-two gallon cask jse two 
gallons of molasses, one quart of yeast, one quart of *' old mother? 
three ounces of tartaric acid ; fill the barrel with rain water. In 
§ert a glass bottle in the bung-hole. Set in the sun. 



892. Another Way to Make Vinegar. — One quart of molasses, 
three gallons of rain water, one pint of yeast. Let it ferment and 
stand four weeks. When grape or muscadine wine is made, 
pour water over the hulls ; let it stand to ferment; strain it ; add 
a tumbler of molasses to each gallon of liquor; put it in jugs, and 
after setting two weeks, drain the vinegar; wash the jugs, and re- 
turn it. Dip coarse white paper in molasses ; cut it in strips, 
and put a handful in the jug, unless a little of the " mother" can 
be obtained. 



893. Apple Vinegar — Is made by adding a tumbler of molasse* 
to two gallons of hard cider. Draw it once or twice. Good 
/inegar may be made by pouring water over honey-comb after 
the honey has been squeezed out, taking care not to make the 
water too sweet. Let it set several days ; then strain it u to 
jugs, and set in the sun. Never put it upon the ground ; alway 
elevate the jugs & little. Add paper if the " mother" cannot U 
obtained. 



893$. Mead. — Boil on© pound of honey, and one gill of water, 
ftkim it well. Stew two tablespoonfuls of ginger, one of all- 
spice in a little water, and udJ Lo it. When milk-warm add a 
wineglass of good ye»«U 



PICKLES. 

8M. Hi j ion. — Take equal quantities of cabbage, green torn* 
toes, and white onions, and half the quantity of green pepper 
chop them fine, without bruising. Put them in an earthen ves 
eel — a layer of the vegetables, a layer of salt. Let them remain 
half a day ; squeeze them out, and pour over the mass weak 
vinegar. Let this remain twenty-four hours. Put into enough 
vinegar to cover them well, a seasoning of mustard seed washed 
and soaked half an hour ; half a box of ground mustard to a gal- 
lon of vinegar. Tie in a thin muslin bag mixed spices to season 
high, and black pepper. Take the vegetables from the weak 
vinegar ; put it in the jar in which it is to be kept; pour over the 
spices and vinegar ; tie the jar ; put it in a pot of water, and make 
the water around it boil an hour. 



895. Sweet Pickle. — To three pounds of brown sugar put one 
gallon of vinegar ; spice to your taste ; boil all together a short 
time, and set off to cool. Fill a jar with the vegetables or fruits 
to be pickled ; pour the vinegar over them when cool, if you 
discover a white scum on the surface, pour the vinegar from the 
pickle and boil again, adding a little more sugar. When cool, 
return to the jar. Peaches stuffed, after neatly removing the 
seed, are nice made in this way. Figs ripe, but not soft, aie 
good ; so are cherries. 



Another Sioeet Pickle. — To eight pounds of fruit put fiv« 
of sugar, three pints of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of allspice, 
two of cloves, and one of mace. Make the syrup ; pour it ovei 
the fruit, boiling hot, three mornings in succession. The fouiti 
morning put them on, and simmer them a little. 



PICKLES. 349 

807. Tomato Pickle. — Take tomatoes two- thirds ripe ; prick 
them with a fork ; put them in a strong brine, and let them re- 
main eight days. Then put them in weak vinegar for twenty -fom 
bom s ; remove them to a stone jar. To one gallon of the tomatoes, 
add half a pint of mustard seed, one bottle of mustard, on 
Oil nee of cloves, one ounce of black pepper ground, one doze.i 
onions, peeled and cut into slices. Place them in layers; cove. 
the wnole with strong vinegar. 



898. PickUd Onions. — Peel; boil in milk and water ten 
minutes ; drain oft* the milk and water ; pour over cold spiced 
vinegar. 



890. To Pickle Peppers. — Take green peppers ; remove the seed 
carefully, so as not to mangle the pepper. Soak twenty -four 
tours in salt and water. Stuff with Higdon, or chopped cabbage, 
highly seasoned. Put them in an unglazed jar ; pour over weak 
vinegar boiling hot ; pour it off, re-boiling three days in succes- 
sion, and pouring hot over the peppers at the end of that time 
Pour over cold vinegar to cover the pepper. Tie over oil-cloth 
or a bladder. 



900. To Pickle Cucumbers. — K ep them in salt and water 
three days ; then wipe them dry ; jut into a jar ; put in spices, 
and a small lump of alum ; pour over scalding vinegar. If a 
*hite scum rises, pour off the vinegar; scald, and pour over 
again. Always have plenty of vinegar to cover them well. 
Cucumbers can be kept in brine for a year; lay grape-leaves on 
top, and a weight to keep them ur der the brine. 



( .K)1 Mangoes. — Young musk melons, peaches, peppers, large 
cucumbers, are all nice mangoei. Cut a slit; carefully remove 
the insides, or stones, if peaches. Lay in salt and water three or 
four days. Then stuff with Higdon ; put the edges together; ti* 
rfith a spring, or sew up separately in cloths. Lay in a btomj jar.

the cut side up. Boil sharp vinegar with a tabkspoonful of aldiM 
to three gallons of vinegar ; pour hot over the mangoes. Th« 
aluni makes them firmer. 



002. Cabbage Pickle. — Quarter the heads, and sprinkle pretty 
Ihickly with salt; let them remain about twelve hours. Take 
tLem from the salt ; rinse in cold water, and wipe dry. If pre- 
ferred, cut them fine. Put them in a jar, and pour over them 
cold spiced vinegar. 

903. Mustard Pickles. — Four ounces of turmeric, one of mace, 
one of allspice, one of cloves, two bottles of English mustard 
(large size), two gallons of vinegar, one pint of mustard seed. 
Let all together just come to a boil. When cold, put into a jar, 
and keep them stirred. The older they are the better. To pre* 
pare cabbage for pickling : Put the cabbage in very strong salt 
and water for three days ; take them out, and sun them for three 
days, turning them frequently. Then pour boiling water over 
them, and wring them out in a clean towel. They are then 
ready to be dropped in the atove pickle. Spices should b« 
pounded and put into a muslin bag. 



904. Green Tomato Pickle. — One peck of green tomatoes 
sliced; one dozen onions sliced; sprinkle with salt, and let them 
stand until the next day ; then drain them. Use the following as 
spices : one box of mustard, half an ounce of black pepper, one 
ounce of whole cloves, and one ounce of white mustard seed 
Alternate layers of tomatoes, onions, and spices. C* ver with 
vinegar. Wet the mustard before putting it in. Boil the whole 
twenty minutes. 



905. Mixed Pivkle — To each gallon of the strongest vinegai 
ftdd four ounces of flour of mustard, three ounces bruised ginger, 
two of turmeric, half a pound of peeled eschalots slightly baked it 
an oven, two ounces of garlic prepared in the same manner, • 



P1CHLE8. 341 

quarter of a pound of salt, and two drachms of Cayenne pepper 
Put these ingredients into a stone jar; crowd very closely ; place 
near the fire for three days, shaking up occasionally. It will thee 
be ready for the vegetables. Before putting the vegetables into 
the vinegar they must be kept in brine three days, and then driod 
fn the sun — small cucumbers, button onions, cauliflower, beans 
peppet etc. 

906. Walnut Pickle. — Take one hundred nuts when just soft 
enough to be pricked through the kernel with a needle, one ounce 
of cloves, one of allspice, one of nutmeg, one of black pepper 
(whole), one of ginger, the same of horseradish cut up fine, half 
a pint of mustard seed, and four heads of garlic tied in a bag 
Wipe the nuts ; prick them with a fork or coarse needle ; pack 
them in a jar, sprinkling the spices between the layers. Add two 
tablespoonfuls of salt to vinegar enough to cover the walnuts. 
Boil it and pour hot over the nuts in the jar, and cover with an 
oil-cloth or something that will preserve the strength of the vine- 
gar. Keep a year before using. The vinegar from it makes ex 
cellent catsup. 

907. Chow. — Horseradish grated fine, two cups ; \ teaspoon 
ful of turmeric, two tablespoonfuls of celery seeds, four tablespoon- 
fuls of sugar, and two tablespoonfuls of white mustard seed; 
vinegar to cover it. Some persons use the horseradish without 
the addition of anything except loaf sugar and vinegar enough to 
acidulate it pleasantly. Packed in very small, wide-mouthed 
bottles and well corked, it keeps well. November is the proper 
incLth to make it. Then new beds may be set from the small 
r>ots that will not answer, for grating. The tops cut closely 
having a few eyes, will also answer for planting. 



908. Cabbage. — Shred the cabbage, sprinkle with salt, and let 
It lie two or three hours; shake off all loose salt; put a layer of 
cabbage, one of grated horseradish, celery seed, a little green pjp 



M8 MRS. hill's new cook book. 

per, allspice, and, if liked, a little turmeric to give the pickle • 
yellow tinge. Add another layer of cabbage until all is disposed 
of. Cover with cold vinegar. Scald this if disposed to mould. 



909. Artichokes. — Scrape well ; soak a few hours in cold watPi 
{suited). Spice vinegar, adding coriander seed, mace, mustard 
eced, black pepper, allspice, and a few cloves. Pour this over the 
artichokes boiling hot. Cover well. 



910. Green Tomato Sauce. — One quart of green tomatoes cut 
up fine, a small onion shred fine, a tumbler of good brown sugar- 
one of vinegar, pepper, salt, allspice, and cloves to taste. Boil 
to a jam, stirring frequently. It must not scorch. An excellent 
gauce for fresh meats. Keep in small jars. 



910£. Imitation Horse- Radish Pickle. — Wash and peel a large 
gweet potato, grate it and season with mustard, one teaspoonful 
of salt, same of black, a little pinch of red pepper, one tea- 
Bpoonful of mustard, half a teacup of vinegar; rub these well 
together and pour over the potato.

COFFEE, TEA, ETC. 

To have this popular beverage in perfection; several points r% 
t^ire attejA.cn. First, the coffee must be of good quality, un 
ftdulterated. Nothing is better than old U. S. Java. Micha ii 
» superior coffee — dearer than any other. When a good arti/ie 
is found, it is best to buy by the quantity ; age improve it if 
carefully kept. A box of seasoned wood answers the purpose. 
It should be elevated a few iivi.es, that ur^ier it may be kept 
clean as well as around it. Coffee, before and after toasting, 
readily absorbs any disagreeable taste or odor with which ft 
comes in contact. It is a good plan to wash, pick out all 
foreign substances, and dry well, several pounds at once. K^ep 
in a well-covered jar. But in toasting it is different. Use a 
small quantity. It is best to toast only what is needed for the 
occasion. Very few persons like the trouble of doing this, but it 
certainly compensates. The grains must be of a uniform dark 
brown color from the surface to the centre. A roaster, such as 
is in very general use, answers the purpose much better than an 
open vessel. The grains should be constantly agitated to be of a 
uniform color. When the toasting is half accomplished, fui a 
pound Jrop in an even teaspoonful of butter. When roasted 
iufficicntiy, glaze it; shut it up in a close, well-covered vessel (glasa 
Ii best) ; keep it in a clean, cool place ; grind as needed, neither too 
fine ner coarse. CofTee should not set after the boiling Is com* 
pleted. It loses every moment some of its deligntful aroma. 
The coffee-boiler should always be kept clean, well-scalded, and 
sunned after each boiling. It is the practice of slovenly, carclbJi 
cooks, to leave the grounds from time to time in the boiler, and 
whtn the vessel is needed, empty, and hastily rinse it, leaving 
much of the former contents adhering to the sides.. The result 
of *ach management is, that the coffee, ii stead of being the deli- 



360 MRS. hill's new cook book. 

cio'isly exhilarating drin* it may be, is flat, insipid, muddy, and 
absolutely pernicious. Even when the boiler is in perfect ordei 
for receiving the cofo* it should be well-scalded. To make th* 
coffee : Pour in boiling water, exactly the quantity needed allow- 
rag a pint for every two heaped tablespoonfuls of fresh-ground 
*>tfe<i; add a teaspoonful jf the white of an egg to this quantity 
[t< o much egg injures the coffee) ; use enough cold water to make 
thi> coffee into a paste ; stir this into the boiling water. Never 
fill the boiler so full of water as to allow no room for the coffee 
to swell. As it swells it will be very apt to boil over unles9 
watched; remove the boiler a moment from the fire; scrape 
down on the inside. Boil very briskly a quarter of an hour. 
Take the boiler from the fire ; pour in half a teacup of cold 
water ; let the coffee settle five minutes. When the boiler is first 
put on the fire, fill the coffee-pot or urn in which it is to be 
served, with boiling water. When the coffee has settled, and is 
ready for the table, pour out the boiling water carefully, and im- 
mediately pour in the coffee on the grounds, being particular not 
to disturb them. Serve without delay, using good, rich cream, 
and good sugar. (Stir these together; pour in the coffee.) 
Where sweet cream cannot be procured, a slight acidity may be 
corrected by using a little soda ; it should be used very cautiously i 
or the quality of the beverage will be affected. The next best to 
sweet rich cream is to boil fresh sweet milk, using it very hot. 

A very good drink for children may be made by re-boiling the 
grounds with sufficient sweet milk. 



Oil. To Make Coffee by Filtering. — Procure a percolator; 
jike out all the inside machinery ; scald it; allow four ounces of 
ground coffee to a quart of water; put this in the bottom of th6 
vessel ; add a small piece of isinglass or skin of cod fish (these 
answer for clarifying when eggs are scarce), half an inch square 
is pufficient for a quart of water ; replace the strainers ; pour it 
boiling water ; set the percolator where it will keep hot with 
out boiling until the water drips through ; pour a little into a dp,

912. Or ten £lc*. — There is no better way of extractirg tho 
* spiritual part" of the essence of the leaves than this : Scald the 
pot in which the tea is to be drawn. Pour in as much boiling 
water as will be required ; use for one teacup and a half of water 
a heaped teaspoonfid of tea, this is a good proportion if the tea is 
strong and good. Sprinkle the dry tea leaves over the surface :>f 
the water; set it where it will keep hot; when the leaves fall to 
the bottom it is ready for the table. Use loaf sugar, and when 
cream is used, add it last. If to be served in a different pot, 
scald it well. It should be hot when the infusion is poured in. 
To replenish, keep a covered mug with one or two teaspoonfuls • 
of tea, half filled with bo'ling water. When the first supply ,,f " 
exhausted, pour the tea from the mug into the tea-pot ; add at 
much boiling water as is needed. 

Another way : Scald the tea-pot ; put in the tea ; add a turn 
blerful of boiling water ; set it where it will keep hot ; after ten 
minutes, add as much water as will be required ; this, of course, 
will depend upon the number of the tea-drinkers. Draw some 
to the covered mug as a reserve. 



913. Black Tea — Is best boiled five or six minutes. Use a 
little larger quantity of leaves, as they are lighter than the green. 
Bcme persons prefer the two kinds mixed ; it makes a pleasant 
beverage. Use only the best teas. Souchong is considered the 
best black ; the Hysons are the best green teas ; Pearl and Impe- 
rial Gunpowder are very fine. Good tea has an agreeable odor. 
Keep it well protected from the air. 



914. Chocolate. — Grate it fine. Allow two heaped tablespoon* 
fals to a pint of fluid ; this should be half milk, hilf water, but 
not mixed. W«Jt the grated chocolate to a smooth paste; boil fl

milk use two heaped tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate. Mil tc 
a smooth paste with a little cold water. Boil the milk. Just a* 
it comes to the boiling point, add the chocolate paste, stirring it 
well with a wooden or silver spoon. Let this boil five minutes 
Pour it off when it cools until only hot (not boiling) ; pour it 
gradually to two well-beaten eggs, stirring constantly. Returi 
it to the fire until hot, and serve immediately. A stick of cinna 
mon may be boiled in the milk. Season to taste. 



916. To Mill Chocolate. — A chocolate-mill somewhat resem 
.es an ice-water pitcher. The handle of a round stick is passed 
up through the lid of the mill, fitting loosely. The bottom of the 
stick is wheel-shaped. Take the top of the stick, which should lie 
several inches above the lid, between the hands, and turn it back 
and forth rapidly until thero is a rich froth upon the chocolat* , 
Serve hot.

THE DAIRY. 

017. To Milk. — No animal better repays *ind and jenerott 
tieatrnent than the cow. In winter she should be well housed, 
Mid a sufficient quantity of dry straw provided for a litter, and 
this changed occasionally. Regular and proper feeding. She 
■hould be curried and rubbed with the same care bestowed upoc 
the horse. How rarely anything of the kind is done! The mis- 
erable, half frozen condition of this valuable animal during the 
cold weather, without shelter of any kind, turned loose to pick 
up a precarious and scanty living, or only supplied with a few 
dry shucks thrown upon the ground, perchance a little dirt- 
slop water, is a reproach to the master. The quality and qu 
tity of milk and butter which would be yielded when well treated 
is of itself (it would seem) an irresistible argument in favor ot 
providing liberally for her comfort, to say nothing of her mute 
appeals to man's humanity. 

918. To Feed in Winter. — There should be a boiler (the size 
depending upon the number of cows kept) fixed upon a furnace ; 
a shelter over the furnace. Arrange the location so as to have 
it as near as may be to water, and the place where the animal is> 
fed. It is better on account of convenience to put the furnace 
where a trough can be attached ; the food, when cooked, put into 
the trough, and when cool it may be covered until the i egulai 
not r for feeding, and then drive the animal to the trough. Peas, 
pumpkins, corn meal, potatoes, beets, carrots, turnips, are all 
good articles of food for cows ; add shucks stripped in smaM pieces 
(they are better for being soaked), a little salt. Boil in clear 
water. Any fragments of vegetables from the kitchen may be 
added clean. Turnips should be used sparingly; 'hey impart a 
disagreeable taste f> the milk. Given barley /atr in the spring,

shou.d be provided. Rye gives a rich color to the milk and 
butter, but injures the taste of be th. This may in part be cor 
rected by salting the corn well. A patch of wheat should ba 
ready tc succeed the barley. By the time these are exhausted, 
the natjral grasses appear, affording pasturage, Boiled koi 
ihould not be discontinued, but may be given in reduced quant: 
ties. When cows are driven to and from their pastures, it should 
be done by a steady, careful person ; racing them at the top of 
their speed, as is usually the case, injures the milk. They should 
be milked under shelter in bad weather. The milker should treat 
her charge kindly, gently, and soothingly, and perform the work 
as quickly as possible to do it thoroughly. Strip the teats closoly , 
there lies the cream. Leave one or more teats for the calf, do- 
pending upon its age. When large enough, let it feed with its 
f her. Great care should be used to keep the milk clean. The 
.ker should provide herself with plenty of water to wash the 
dder well, and then wipe clean and dry with a clean, coarse 
towel, kept for this purpose. Tie a thin cloth over the bucket 
into which the milk is poured as soon as it is milked. Use a 
smaller vessel for receiving the milk as it is drawn from the cow. 
When the milking is completed, take it to the dairy. Drive the 
cow and calf to their food. Have plenty of boiling water ; scald 
the pans (which should be broad and shallow). When hot, pour 
out the water, and immediately strain the milk into them. Re- 
serve in a small vessel sufficient to afford cream for coffee and 
tea. Into another vessel pour what is intended for the table. 
Stir it until all the animal heat is exhausted. In separate vest-eu 
pat what is intended for the churn. The cream h tended for the 
chum should never be touched until removed for that purpose. 



919. For Churning, — In winter, the cream nay stand tw; 
days. In summer, it should be churned eveiy morning, as early 
as rcssible. In winter it is a good plan to reserve a part of the 
outtcrmilk from time to time, and add it to the iVesh cream U 
turn it. The churn should be placed where it will have a aum

mer temperature, or fifty-five degrees (Fahrenheit's thermometer). 
Greater heat than this gives the butter a white spongy look , 
Scald the churn well in every case before putting in the cream, 
When the churn is prepared at night, add a portion of thtf night's 
milking to the cream; shake them well together. The buuoi 
milk is better than when only cream is used. The cream, when 
taken from the pans, may be put in a covered jar, and sligh; y 
salted, where the buttermilk is not used as a drink. The sream 
will keep better, but the salt would injure the buttermilk. The 
churning should be done with a steady, regular motion. In very cold 
weather set the churn in a tub of warm water, which will keep the 
milk at the proper temperature; add more hot water if needed 
In very warm weather set the churn in a vessel of cold water. 
The milk should be kept at an equable temperature. For a 
small churning a stone- ware jar is best, with a wooden cover, and 
a dasher — the handle running through the hole in the lid or 
It should be unglazed. The stone- ware is much more e 
cleansed than the wooden. 

When the process of churning is complete, pour in a tumblei 
ful of cold water ; this hardens the butter, and makes it easier to 
collect. Have a pan or bowl of cold water ready ; put the but- 
ter into it as it is taken from the churn. Work the buttermilk 
out; cover it again with cold water. Examine carefully for 
motes, and remove them. Work out all milk and water with a 
wooden paddle. Never use the hand. Add salt in the propor- 
tion of half a tablespoonful to a pound of butter. Make it into 
shapes. Keep in a cool, clean place. Nothing more need be 
J«>ne with butter intended for immediate use. 



920. For Packing Butter. — Let it set in a cool place two ot 
ihree days; work it well, and pour off the water; use more sail 
than for immediate use. Scald small unglazed jars with salt and 
water ; when cool, pack the butter down very close ; pour off the 
least water that rises ; fill to within two inches of the top ; then 
melt butter enough -to fill the jar nearly full. Lay ovt: u"il% 



356 mrs. hill's &aw cook book. 

when cool, a quarter of ai inch thick, this preparation: Three 
pans ground alum or solar salt (never use Liverpool salt), one of 
pulverized loaf sugar, one of saltpetre; cover with a tight fitting 
cover; the air must be entirely excluded Remove the top but- 
ter when used. 

Another way : Pack the butter, free from milk, in jara scalded 
in salt and water. Pour over brine, and cover close. 

Another way : Beat and sift four tablespoonfuls of alum or sola* 
salt, two of loaf sugar, and one of saltpetre ; add this quantity to 
every pound of butter ; pack closely. Reserve a portion of the 
salt mixture ; put it between a fold of muslin, and lay upon the 
top. Cover closely. Keep in a dry, cold place. 



921 . To Freshen Salt Butter. — Dissolve it in hot water. Let 
'tool; skim it off the water, and churn it in sweet milk. A 
j of milk is enough for a pound of butter. Only have the 
u er hot enough to melt the butter. 



922. Patent Butter. — A patent has been secured by a Mr. 
Clai k, of London, for the following method of preserving but> 
ter : " Wash the butter, and press out the milk in the usual 
manner ; then place it between two linen cloths, and submit it to 
severe pressure to remove the whey. Coat clean white paper on 
both sid(*> with the whites of eggs, mixing fifteen grains of salt 
to each white; dry the paper. And just before wrapping it 
around the butter, iron it with a hot iron ; use it heated. Keep 
in a cool, dry place." 



923. A Simple Plan to Keep Butter Cold in Summer. — Pro 
cure a large new flower-pot to cover the plate of butter; a large 
saucer to hold the flower-pot when turned upside down. Put. ft 
small trivet cr three muffin-rings on the bottom of the saucer. 
Set the plate of butter upon it ; fill the saucer with water ; turn 
the flower-pot o^er the butter so that the edge of the pot will bo 
below the w ater. Put a cork in the hole in the bottom of the 



THE DIARY. < 357 

flower- pot — the butter is now in an airtight chamber. Ocea 
eionally drench the outside of the flower-pot with cold water. 

924. To Recover Rancid Butter or Lard. — Use Darby's Pro 
phytanic Fluid by the directions which accompany the bottles $ 
at earn it in thoroughly ; then put the butter in a clean vessel. 

The vessels used in the dairy should be kept scrupulously 
clean. First wash them, then scald well, and sun frequently. 
Keep white, well-washed sand for scouring the wooden vessels. 

Cream, after it is skimmed from the milk, may be kept a day 
and night, by scalding it, and then slightly sweetening with loaf 
Bugar. A thin cream may be raised from fresh milk by setting 
the vessel which contains it upon the fire ; skim as the cream 
rises ; repeat the skimming as long as there is any appearance of 
cream. 



925. To Preserve Milk for a Journey. — Put the fresh sweet 
milk into bottles ; put them into an oven of cold water ; gradually 
raise it to the boiling point ; take them out, and cork imme 
diately ; return the bottles to the water ; raise it once more to 
the boiling point ; let the bottles remain a minute. Take the 
oven from tae fire, and let the bottles cool in it. 



926. Cheese. — The articles used in making cheese are, a tub to 
hold the milk, a boiler to scald it, strainers of coarse linen, a 
cheese-basket for dripping, a cheese-press and hooks, cheese-board, 
and hoops. Strain fresh unskimmed milk into the boiler ; warm 
it just blood-hot, and no more; pour it into the tub, and while 
warm, add rennet enough to turn it. About half a tumbler of 
itrong rennet water to six quarts of milk will probably be sufli 
sient, but it will very much depend upon the strength of the 
rennet water. Keep the tub covered with a blanket where the 
milk will be only blood-hot, and if in an hour the curd has not 
framed, add more rennet ; use no more than is absolutely neces- 
sary, or the cheese will have a strong taste. As soon as the curd 
b funned, cut it gently into cakes, without moving them ; thii 



358 MR8. HlLi/fl NSW COOK BOOK. 

will cause the whey to rise. Cut it across slow.y and gently | 
pass the knife gently around between the tub and curd. Cut it 
again in checks an inch apart. Remove the whey as it rises, but 
do not disturb the curds. Cover the tub a quarter of an hour. 
The curds and whey must be separated very gently and slowly, 
Or the milk will run off with the whey, and leave the cheese very 
poor. When the whey looks white, this is the case ; when the 
whey looks green, the process is proceeding satisfactorily. After 
the tub has remained covered fifteen minutes, set the basket 
partly over the tub ; spread the cloth (or strainer) over it, and 
dip the curds into it ; shake the cloth to hasten the dripping. 
Gather the ends of the cloth up securely, and put a weight upon 
the curds for a quarter of an hour. Break up the curds again 
with the hand, and press again. Now salt it, using half a table- 
spoonful of salt to a pound of curd. Spread a thin cloth in and 
over the press ; lay in the curds, a little heaped in the centre , 
pack it down tightly. The cloth should be large enough to allow 
the corners to cover the top of the cheese well ; lay upon it a 
heavy weight. Let it remain two hours ; cut up the curds ; lay 
in the press a dry thin or gauzy cloth ; put the curds again in 
press. Repeat this, without again breaking the curds, three or 
four times a day until the last cloth looks dry ; then use a fine 
linen cloth wrung out of hot water ; wrap this around and over 
the cheese, and let it remain a day. If firm enough (if not, let it 
remain another day), sprinkle the outside with flour; sew a cloth 
around it ; put in a hoop. Keep it in a hoop until hard enough 
to handle; then put it on the cheese-board or shelf, and rul> it 
with butter every day for a week. For six months grease it 01 ca 
iionally. For very rich cheese add to the morning's milk the 
>ream of the over night's skimming. These rich cheeses do not 
need coloring, but for poorer ones use annotta, and a little Wy 
added to the milk, along with the rennet ; allow three drachms 
of annotta to ten pounds of curds ; for green cheese use the juic* 
of sage or spinach. To protect fresh cheese from flies, mix rad 
pepper with the butter with which it is greased.

OT7. Cream Cheese. — One quart of cream ; st.<- to it one tea* 
spoonful of salt; let it stand covered two days. Lay in a sieve a 
cloth folded six times ; sprinkle it with salt (the cloth should be 
much larger than the sieve, and hang considerably over the side 

if the sieve) ; pour in the cream ; sprinkle a little salt on it. 

Change the cloth as soon as it gets moist. Repeat this ; as the 
cheese dries, press it. This makes a good custard, washed 
before dry, and made into a batter, with eggs, milk, sugar u.j • 
lit Je butter. Season with lemon. Bake in a crust.

t>28. Lemon Punch. — Roll two large lemons under the hand 
t^il ; cut them into thin slices; take out all the pulp, and throw 
•tfay the seed. Put the pulp and yellow rind, and half a tea- 
spoonful of good green tea, half a pound of loaf sugar, in a clean 
8tew-pan lined with porcelain ; pour over a tumbler of boiling 
water. Stir well, and add a pint of Champagne wine, or any pre- 
ferred. Set it upon the fire until hot, ana unnk immediately. 
Excellent to promote perspiratioD in bad fr.lrls. THe rtatmf!i 
snould drink it in bed. Half this receipt will be sufficient ftt 
one person. 



929. Mulled Wine. — Boil together one tumbler of water, half 
A nutmeg, a small stick of cinnamon, a dozen cloves slightly 
bruised, the same of allspice ; reduce it by boiling half; strain 
the spiced water into a pint of good Sherry or Madeira wine 
Set it on the fire, and when it begins to bubble, take it off the 
fire ; sweeten with loaf sugar, and serve. Cider may be mulled 
in the same way. 

930. Wine Whey. — One pint of b( iling milk, a tumblerful of 
good Madeira wine ; boil until the curds form. Pour off the 
whey into a pitcher ; sweeten, and serve. Cider may be used 
instead of wine. 



9S1. Drink for a Consumptive. — Put into a tumbler a table- 
*px>nful of strained honey, a wineglass of good brandy or 
whiskey ; add milk just from the cow to fill the glass. Stir, and 
&iuk warm, before breakfast.

932. Tamarind Whey.-~ -Boil one ounce of tamarinds in a pint 
ef sweet milk; stiain, and sweeten to taste. 



933. Apple- Water. — Take dried apples; pour boiling water 
,-vver them ; let them set until cold. Or, oake green apples, and 
oour boiling water over. A pleasant drink in fevers. Sweeten 
if liked. 



934 Crat.herry Tea. — Mash ripe fruit; pour over boiling 
water. Strain, and sweeten to taste. Tamarinds may be used 
In this way, but without mashing the fruit. 



935. Corn Meal Gruel. — Sift the finer part of the corn meal 
from the bran ; boil the bran at least two hours in plenty of 
water. Keep the vessel covered, to prevent its being smoked. 
Be careful it does not scorch. Should the water boil down too 
much, replenish with boiling water. Strain the bran from the 
water. Season the water or gruel with sweet milk, a little fresh 
butter, and salt. Omit the butter if it would make the gruel too 
rich for the patient. 



936. Flour Gruel. — Put a pint of fresh sweet milk to boil; 
mix to a paste an even tablespoonful of wheat flour, corn starch, 
or potato starch. Just as the milk boils, stir in the paste 
smoothly. Let it boil until the gruel is sufficiently thick. Sea- 
son with loaf sugar and nutmeg; wine may be used if liked. 



937. Potato Starch Custard. — Two heaped tablespoon fills of 
potato starch, two eggs well beaten, with two tablespoon fuls ci 
pulverized loaf sugar (more sugar may be used if liked) ; sensor 
to taste, with lemon, vanilla, or rose-water, and one pint of fresh 
meet milk. Boil the milk; add the starch, wet up with cold 
milk; just as the milk begir.s to boil, stir constantly until a9 
thick as very rich cream. Pour it out. When warm only, stir 
It to the eggs, mixing well. Return to the stew-pan, and boil

Kith a stick of cinnamon. Wet up two tab_espoonfuh (S dr. 
farina with cold milk; stir it to *jhe boiling milk; let it boil ,Vt 
minutes, stirring constantly. Remove it from the fire; beat thfc 
jrolks of two eggs. Stir the farina to them when just warm; 
sweeten and season to taste. Pour into earthen cups ; set the cups in 
a pan of hot water ; put the pan in a moderate oven, and bake 
slowly until the custard is firm. Try one, by probing with the 
handle of a silver teaspoon. If baked in an oven too hot, the 
custards will be watery ; if properly baked, they will cut firm, 
and have a beautiful solid look. These may be made of arrow- 
root, corn starch, or flour, and nothing of the kind can be more 
agreeable to an invalid. It is a nice dessert, baked in an earthen 
dish, the sugar in the custard omitted, and eaten with rich wine 
sauce. Grate nutmeg over the top. 



939. Corn Starch Custard. — Beat the yolks of three eggs; 
boil a pint of fresh sweet milk ; wet up a heaped teaspoonful of 
corn starch with cold milk ; add it to the boiling milk ; boil five 
or six minutes, stirring constantly. Set it aside to cool ; then 
stir well into the milk. Return all to the boiler; stir well 
until as thick as liked. Pour into an earthen bowl ; stir a few 
minutes, and when cool, season to taste with lemon, orange, 
rose, or vanilla. Whip the whites of two eggs to a strong 
froth ; add a few drops of the same flavoring used in the custard, 
and a tablespoonful of pulverized loaf sugar ; pile this over the 
custard, and serve. These custards should be prepared in • 
double kettle, or in a tin bucket, set in an oven of boiling water

SMI. Rice Gruel. — Two tablespoonfuls of rice flour; wet it up 
with X)ld water. Boil twenty minutes in a pint of boiling vater; 
then add one tumblerful of fresh sweet milk. Season to taste. 
Caudle is made by adding to this gruel, wine, and a little grated 
cracker. 



942. Corn Meal Pudding. — One quart of sweet milk ; add to 
this while boiling hot, sufficient fine corn meal to make a stiff 
mush. Let this get cold. Add four eggs, beaten separately ; 
one tablespoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of yeast powders ; 
add the whites, beaten very solidly, last. Bake quick. Eat with 
or without sauce. Tapioca boiled or baked is much relished by 
invalids. Receipts are already given for preparing these custards. 



943. Sago. — Soak half a tumblerful an hour in cold water. 
Boil in a pint of hot water until soft. Stir it from the bottom , 
add a pint of sweet milk. Season to taste with wine, sugar, and 
nutmeg. Eggs may be added, and baked as a pudding. 



944. Panada. — Mix three parts water, one of good Madeira 
wine. Put it into a stew-pan ; add a large square cracker, grated, 
to a pint of the fluid. Let it become boiling hot; pour ofl' into 
a bowl ; season with sugar and lemon, or r ltmeg. The water 
may be poured upon a well-beaten egg f if liked; 3tu brisklj

ing water; dip the crackers in ; put a layer upon the bottom of i 
hot coveied dish. Just as the mil/; boils up, pour part of it over 
the crackers; put down another layer of cracKeia °o divide the 
same that some may be poured over each layer of crackers. 
Cover when the last is in, and serve immediately ; if allowed to 
wait before being eaten, they become watery and sodden. With 
i soft boiled egg, a little grated ham or tongue, a good cup of 
tea, coffee, or chocolate, an invalid need not desire a better break- 
fast or lunch. Light bread or hard biscuit may be toasted and 
dressed in the same way. 

946. Toast and Water. — Slice stale light oread, or toast the 
outside crust of corn bread. Immerse it while hot in a tumbler 
or pitcher of cold water; cover it for half an hour before drink- 
ing. Make it fresh once a day. The vessel may be refilled as 
the water is used. 



947. Rice Pudding. — One small teacup of boiled rice, three 
well-beaten eggs, a pint of sweet milk, nutmeg and sugar to taste. 
Bake in a moderate oven until the custard sets. Boiled rice, sea- 
soned with orange peel, milk and sugar, is a good dish for inva- 
lids. Use a little butter, if permitted ; a little wine is also 
relished. 



948. Gelatine Blanc-Mange. — Boil an ounce of gelatine in a 
pint of water until dissolved. Mix with a pint of sweet milk 
half a pound of loaf sugar; flavor with lemon or vanilla. Put 
upon a flat dish a quart of rich crean ; beat to a stiiF froth. 
3tir the milk and gelatine together; add the whipped cream; stir 
until it congeals. 



949. Beef Broth. — Put half a pound bi lean beef in a stew-pan, 
pour over it three tumblers of cold water. Set it over a slow fire 
where it will heat gradually. Remove the scum as it rises, 
After simmering half an h< ur, strain it through a thin c!otk

050. Egg Nogg. — To the yolk of each egg add a tablespoonful 
of loaf sugar ; beat well together ; add two tablespoonfuls of go* 4 
urandy or three of Madeira wine. Beat the whites to a solid 
froth ; put them to the yolks, and to every three eggs add a 
wineglass of thick rich cream. Stir lightly into the yolks. The 
cream may be omitted, if not liked. It injures the egg-nogg if 
not very thick and rich. This is excellent for persons suffering 
from bad colds and coughs. 

951. Drink for an Invalid. — A new-laid egg f well-beaten, a 
iup of hot coffee, tea, or chocolate poured to it, stirring well, is a 
good drink for an invalid. 

952. Boullie. — Boiled flour for persons suffering with weak 
bowels, and for infants teething. Boil half a pound of flour, tied 
loosely in a cloth, four hours. When cold, peel off the outer 
rind. To a pint of boiling sweet milk, add a tablespoonful of this 
boiled flour grated and wet into a paste with cold water; boii 
gently ten minutes. Season with salt and a little loaf sugar. 



953. Broiled Tomatoes. — Slice large tomatoes, without skin 
ning; put them upon a warm gridiron until thoroughly hot, tun. 
ing them once. Season with butter, salt, and pepper. The»« 
are excellent for invalids suffering from constipation. 



954. Tomato Toast. — Stew to a paste, after skinnir.g hem. 
Beason to taste, and spread upon slices of toasted bread. 



955. Herb Teas. — Make these by infusion, using greon ot 
dried leaves. Balm, catnip, pennyroyal, sage, are good drinks in

nausea; use, if possible, the green leaves. Mullen and sassafm 
will purify the blood. Flaxseed and slippery elm are good for 
cold3, influenza, etc. Tea of the uva ursi, with a piece of aalt 
petre as large as a pea to a tumblerful, is good for strangury. 

Herbs, intended for drying, should be gathered, just before they 
bloom, in dry weather, and dried in the shade. Put up in papei 
bags. 

956. Mutton Broth. — Take half a pound from the scraggy 
neck part; cut off the skin and fat; put it in a stew-pan, and 
cover with cold water ; a pint to half a pound will be a good 
proportion. Let it simmer gently (removing the scum as it 
rises) an hour, then strain it. Season to taste. 



957. Chicken Panada. — Use the head, wings, neck, and gib 
lets ; cover them with cold water ; stew until tender. Take out 
the chicken ; add a little sweet milk and bread crumbs ; salt to 
taste ; stew five minutes ; serve hot. Use the giblets with the 
rest of the chicken. Chicken tea is made by stewing the chicken 
as in the panada, using the same pieces; skim off all grease; 
season with salt to taste. 



958. Birds for Convalescents. — Lay them upon the gridiron 
broil until a light brown color; then put them in a stew-pan 
pour over hot water enough to cover them. Le<; them stew 
until tender. Season with a little fresh butter, pepper, and salt. 
Chicken, birds, and squirrels, stewed in a double kettle, are vcr) 
delicate for invalids. If permitted, stuff the fowls and birds with 
minced oysters. 

959 Oyster Soup. — Pour off the liquor from the oysters. Pu 
the oysters and a piece of butter (enough to make them suffi 
eiently rich) into the stew-pan. Let the oysters stew until they 
lose their slimy appearance. To a quart of oysters, add a quart 
of their liquor, the same quantity of sweet milk, a teacup of 



OOOKIRT FOR INVALIDS. 861 

bread or cracker crumbs. Be.it the yolks of two eggs, and add 
them just as the liquor boils up. Serve hut. This is a line soup 
for a consumptive, or for one in a feeble state, where a generous 
diet is required. 

900. Mush.—-' Wet up three tablespoonfuls of fine corn mea 
with cold water; stir it to three tumblerfuls of boiling water. 
Add salt to taste; stir frequently until the meal is thoroughly 
cooked, and the mush sufficiently thick. Eat cold or warm with 
sweet milk or syrup. Cut cold mush in slices, and fry. 



961. hasty Pudding. — Add to this quantity of mush two well*

902. For a Burn. — Make half a tumbler of strong lime water 
let it set a tew minutes ; then strain the water through a thin 
muslin to the same quantity of linseed or sweet oil (neat's or 
hog's foot will answer); mix it well, and spread over the burn; 
wrap over linen cloths. Do not remove the cloth for several 
days ; saturate it frequently with the lime and oil until the in- 
flammation is subdued. Should the odor become offensive, apply 
cold poultices of the flour of slippery elm ; spread over wit! 
pulverized charcoal. A plaster of lard and soot is also good foi 
a burn. Ileal with any simple salve — a very good ore is madf 
by stewing together heart leaves, white lily root, agrhnony, t 
few leaves of the Jamestown weed, and sweet gum. When the 
strength of the herbs is extracted, strain the water ; throw jway 
leaves, etc. ; add fresh unsalted butter, and simmer gentiy una] 
the water has evaporated. Keep this on hand for common sores, 
in a close-covered box.

The premonitory symptoms of croup are a shrill, •onorcut 
«c ugh, cold hands, and flushed face. The patient is not alway I 
sick, and is often gayer than usual. Use without delay a plaster 
of mustard upon the throat, or apply to the throat a strip of flan-

a half tumbler of this to the same quantity of sweet milk. Give 
every two minutes. Treat as for corrosive sublimate cr any 
mercurial poison. 

When copper vessels are used in the kitchen they should be 
laid aside and forbidden to be used when the inside tinning begin* 
to wear off*. The action of grease upon the copper produces e 
metallic poison, which will inevitably cause death unless very 
promptly relieved. 

For belladonna or veratrum, etc. : Give an active emetic ; then 
strong vinegar or lemon juice ; then strong coffee. 

Oxalic acid is sometimes mistaken for epsom salts. Give soap

trals, until the disease abates. 

A very good and simple remedy, if used when the first symp- 
toms appear, is : Give an adult five drops of spirits of turpentine 
in a tea^oonful of sweet milk. Repeat, if necessary. Give a 
child according to age. 

Another remedy : A teacup half full of apple vinegar. Dis 
solve as much salt in it as it will hold, leaving a little at the bot- 
tom. Pour boiling water upon the solution until the cup is 
three-fourths full. Scald it, and remove the scum. Take a 
tablespoonful three times a day. 



982. Remedy for Diarrhea. — Take a peck of the bark of green 
hickory. Clean an oven-lid ; put the bark upon, and burn to 
ashes. Empty them carefully into an earthen bowl, and cover 
them well with warm water; stir well. Let them settle

into a jug, straining it by putting a piece of muslin cloth in the 
bottom of the funnel. The jug should be three parts full. Strip 
in very small pieces a handful of the inside bark of pine, for a 
gallon of the ley ; put the pine bark in the jug; fill it with good 
whiskey or gin. A wineglassful is a dose for an adult. This is 
rt valuable preparation for children teething. It will be a good 
plan to make a gallon the beginning of summer. Keep it in a 
oooi, dry place. 

Blackberry root is a fin 3 astringent. A strong tea made of 
this and sweet gum bark with a stick of cinnamon boiled 's'\\h 
the root, is very good; a Lttle r/ar3goric may be ad fed.

other two. Abstain from liquids. Apply mustard io the ex 
tremities and stomach. Apply flannel wrung out of hot whiskey.

will sometimes prevent an attack. Another way : Blue pill at 
night. Six or eight grains of quinine given in pills of two grains 
each ; begin three hours before the chill comes on. This will some- 
times prevent their return. Discontinue giving quinine before the 
fever comes on. Another : Pills of red pepper, pulverized ; as much 
salt, four grains of quinine ; divide in two pills ; give one two hours 
oefore the chill is expected ; repeat in an hour. Nothing is so relia. 
3le as quinine given in doses of six, eight, or even ten grains, but if 
used too long, may affect the hearing ; hence, it is a good plan to 
discontinue it, and use boneset or one of the other remedies men-

ginger ; drink hot as the chill is coming on. Half a wineglass of 
green sage juice is also good.

1027. Potato Poultice. — iJoil and mash the potatoes smooth, 
using warm water or sweet milk to give it the proper consist 
erce. This is a soothing poultice, but may be made stimulating 
dy \ising strong pepper tea instead of water. For foul ulcer* 
use red oak bark tea, and sprinkle over it powdered charcoal. 

In preparing poultices always make enough for two. Have 
t*o bags made of thin soft cloth; as one cools have the other 
feadj to apply immediately, so that the heat and moisture may 
&U kept up without interruption as long as necessary. When the 
U»t poultice is withdrawn, lay over the place a dry flannel or 
cloth of some kvnd. The poultice should be large enough to 
cover the place well, made smooth, and not too stiff. A hard, 
lumpy, h<avy poultice should not be used. Never make them 
uure Uau half an inch thick. Always lay a dry cioth over tht

>eultice to prevent the person's clothing from becoming damp. 
v\ hen wo.ll prepared and managed they are very useful, but im- 
properly made and carelessly used, they do more harm than 
good. 

1028. Charcoal Poultice. — To a pint of potato, light brer.1 o 
ion meal poultice, add a large tablespoonful of fresh burned 
pulverized charcoal. Good for foul ulcers. 



1029. Hop Poultice. — Boil hops to a strong tea; thicken 
amoothly with potato, flour, or corn meal. Use when there is 
much pain and inflammation. Hop fomentation is excellent for 
•welled glands in scarlet fever, quinsy, etc. Rub the leaves 
between the hands; quilt them between a fold of muslin cloth; 
scald in strong vinegar. Apply as hot as can be borne. Make 
two bags, and have one cool ; apply the other; use over it a dry 
cloth, and apply warm flannel when the last is removed. Peach 
leaves, mint, mullen, horehound, and tansy answer a good pur- 
pose, and are very good in all painful affections of the stomack 
and bowels. 



1030. Light Bread Poultice. — Saturate the bread with sweet 
milk ; put it on the fire until hot ; grease over the top with * 
Httle sweet, linseed, or neat's oil. A very soothing poultice foi 
simple sores. Never let a poultice remain long enough to be- 
come sour. 



1031. Slippery Elm Poultice — Is best made of the ground elm 
Druggists usually keep it in small packages. Take as much cf 
the powdered elm as may be needed ; stir cold water to it unti 
it forms a jelly. Apply this, spread upon a soft cloth, imme 
diately to the diseased part. This is excellent for sores from 
fire, or any inflamed sore. If there is any disagreeable odor, 
i^rinkle charcoal over it. Change frequently.

J 032 Pepper Poultice. — Make strong tea yf rvd pepper; 
thicken with wheat bran or corn meal. 



1033. Flaxseed Poultice. — Grind or bruise the seed ; boil il 
*weet milk or water until of the right consister.ee. Applj wilk 
©ut putting a cloth between the flaxseed and the sore. 



1034. Cancer Poultice. — Take equal parts of red oak bark; 
poplar root, dogwood root, and black sumac root ; boil down in 
water to a strong tea; strain out the barks, and boil the tea io 
the consistence of syrup. Make a plaster of this; sprinkle ovei 
it pulverized bluestone. Apply the plaster to the cancer night 
and morning until the cancer is eaten out ; then continue the 
plaster without the bluestone until the fever or inflammation is 
relieved ; then use a healing salve. 



1035. Liniment for White Swelling and Palsy. — Use the root 
and flower of the bear foot (any quantity) ; boil to a strong tea; 
strain it, and stew with hog's lard until the water has evaporated. 
Rub the part affected well, and wrap in flannel. 

Another way of making this liniment is : A handful of the 
flowers of the bear's-foot, and one of the root ; dry in the shade, 
and beat to a powder ; mix with half a pound of fresh butter. 
Put it in a jar, and expose to the sun two days. Rub the part 
affected. This is also excellent for hard breasts, when there m 
danger of their rising. 



1036. A Good Healing Salve. — A gill of soft turpentine fro» 
the pine tree, mutton suet the size of a hep's egg, three taU* 
spoonfuls of linseed oil, the same of beef-fot t oil, and three of 
wax; melt these together; mix well, and when just warm, work 
In a teaspoonful of laudanum, one of opedeldcc, *rd one of spirit* 
of camphor. 

1037. To Dress a Blister. — When the blister nae drawn mfli 



MEDICAL RECEIPTS. 387 

ciently, preparo for dressing it by trimming all the hard veini 
and stems from cabbage leaves ; lay them in a deep vessel, and 
pour over boiling water; let them remain until ready to use. 
Remove tha blister gently with a sharp-pointed pair of scissors; 
©r clip them; hold a cloth doubled under to receive the 
water as it trickles from the blister. Apply the cabbage eavci 
putting them on three or four deep. Bind .nesc on carefully 
with a cloth. Dress in this way for several days, three times a 
day. and once or twice during the night if painful ; then use a 
wax cloth, made by melting together one part wax, and three 
parts tallow ; spread upon a cloth. 



1038. A Good Styptic. — Rub a little dry chloride of lime upon 
the wound. 



1039. Mustard Plaster. — When required to act promptly, use 
only mustard mixed with water or vinegar ; spread upon cloth, 
and apply immediately to the part; but if wished less stimulating, 
add a little meal or flour, and put a thin muslin over the plaster. 



1040. Mustard or Pepper Bath for the Feet. — Have as much 
hot water as may be needed in a small tub ; stir in mustard to 
make it sufficiently stimulating, or if pepper, boil a pod or two 
of pepper with the water. Put the patient's feet in the tub of 
water, and throw over the whole a blanket. Keep the water to 
the same temperature by adding a little warm water from time 
to time as may be needed. Rub dry with a coarse towel, and 
immediatel) cover up in bed. 



1041 . Pepper Plaster. — Beat the white of an egg with a table 
ipoonful of pulverized red pepper — a tablespoonful of spirits of 
turpentine is sometimes added. Spread upon cloth. Excellent 
for pains in the breast and sides, in severe cold, and influenzas. 



10i2. Plaster for Boils. — White of an egg, honey and flour. 



188 MRS. hill's new coo* book. 

For a breast threatened to rise : Dip a cloth, cnt to fit, in 
mixture of equal parts of beeswax and tallow. 

1043. Rheumatic Liniment. — Equal parts of sweet oil, spirits of 
?amphor, hartshorn, and laudanum ; or rub with No. 6, or Pert? 
Davi.V Pain-killer. For pains in the back, use the arnica plaster 

1044. Piles. — Castor oil on cotton is good. Also a salve 
made of Jamestown weed leaves, or the seed. Never allow the 
bowels to become constipated. 



1045. Fainting. — Lay the person in a horizontal position ; 
give plenty of fresh air. It is improper and thoughtless to crowd 
around a person in this condition. Bathe the face with cold 
water. Apply hartshorn or some stimulating smell to the nose. 
Loosen the clothing. If necessary, put mustard plasters upon the 
extremities. 



1046 ^br Nausea. — Peppermint diluted is very good. A 
mint julip is also good. Make it in this way : Put a few sprigs 
of fresh mint in the bottom of a tumbler ; if convenient, add a 
tcaspoonful of ice broken into small pieces. In another tumbler 
dissolve a tablespoonful of loaf sugar in enough water to fill the 
tumbler half full ; add a wineglass of good brandy ; stir well, 
and pour it upon the mint. Give this in small quantitias. Put 
a mustard plaster over the stomach. 

1047. To Extinguish Fire on a Person. — When the clothea 
catch on fire, extinguish by smothering; wrap up in woolen if 
possible — a carpet, hearth rug, or anything within reach. I 
incw a case where a lady alone in her room, just in the act of 
retiring to bed, discovered her night clothes in a blaze; vith 
admirable presence of mind, she leaped into bed, smothered the 
flame, and saved her life. Never rush into the air. 

If the chimney catches, so as to endanger the house, throw sail 
upon the fire ; spread a wet blanket before the fire-^ace. 



MEDICAL RECEIPTS. 38ft 

1048 Whert a Person is Insensible from a Fall or Jttoit 
vpon the Head. — Put a mustard plaster on the back cf the 
neck and extremities ; rub briskly ; then bathe the part with hot 
vinegar. 



i049. To Recover a Person Apparently Drowned. — Strip th* 
iwvfy ; rub it dry; wrap it in warm blankets; use every means 
V heat the body by hot applications and friction. Wipe the 
mouth on the inside, should it be necessary ; turn the head on 
the side, slightly elevated, to allow the water to run out of the 
mouth. Inflate the lungs, by introducing into one of the nostrils 
the pipe of a hand bellows; close the mouth and the othei 
nostril ; blow the bellows until the chest rises ; then unstop the 
the mouth and nostril ; press lightly on the chest to eject ihe air. 
Repeat this process. Never cease using remedies for at least six 
hours. When the patient is able to swallow, give small quanti- 
ties of warm wine, or brandy and water. 



1050. From Freezing. — Put the body in a cold bath for a 
quarter of an hour ; rub briskly until warmth is restored ; avoid 
the fire. Give, if the patient can swallow, a few drops of cam- 
phor ; or if it cannot be swallowed, use camphor and water as an 
injection. As soon as possible give a cup of strong coffee. 



1051. Struck by Lightning. — When a person is struck by 
lightning, dash cold water over the neck, face, and breast. Aa 
they recover, they should be kept quiet. If the feet are cold 
apply hot jugs of water. 

1052. From Hanging, Suffocation, etc, — Rub with warm jiotha 
Apply hot bottles of water to the feet. 



1053. Apparent Death from Charcoal or other Noxiout Vapor*. 
—Give the person plenty of fresh air. Dash over the face and 
neck ocld water. 'When relieved, cover comfortably in bed' 



S90 MRS. HILLS NEW COOK BOOK. 

keep quiet, and take some nourishing broth or a cup of strcng Wot 
ooffee. 



1054. Whin Affected by Foul Air in Descending Wells- 
throw down unslacked lime, then several pails of water before 
featuring to go down. 



1055. Tie Severing of an Artery. — When a person is in dan- 
ger of bleeding to death from the severing of an artery, compress 
with the Angers the ends of the artery, as near as possible to the 
wound, or apply a piece of lint dipped in a tincture of arnica 
-water ; on this put a bit of sponge, and press this so as to stop the 
blood. Send for a surgeon without delay. 



105G. To Dress Wounds. — Dress wounds loosely, so as to allow 
the secreted matter to escape easily in the lint; spread over the 
wound to exclude the air. Every day a suppurating wound 
should be cleansed, and bathed freely in lukewarm water. If a 
wound inflames, becomes hot, and swollen, put a warm bread and 
milk poultice over it. 



1057. For Bleeding at the Lungs — Take strong salt and water; 
a teaspoonfu) every five minutes. 



1058. Worms — For A scar ides or Fin Worms. — Give an injec- 
tion ever}* wgai until relieved, of a tablespoonful of sweet oil in 
kalfapint of warm water. Use the homeopathic specifics for 
worms. 

For other varieties of worms : Give a child a drop of turpen- 
tine upon sugar for each year old. For instance, if two years dd, 
give two drops of turpentine before eating, and for nine successive 
mornings ; then a dc se of castor oil. When from the knetting 
of the worms violent pain is caused, rub with turpentine, using a 
little on with i'. to prevent blistering. This treatment has beea 



MEDICAL RECEIPTS. 391 

known to remove tape-worm. Tea of Jerusalem oak is eflicacioui 
in expelling worms. 

1059. Deafness. — Fill a phial with house-leek leaves ; «top \\ 
well; envelope it in corn meal dough, and bake slowly. Dny 
khe juice in the ear three or four times a day. Wear a piece oi 
wool in the ear. 

Another remedy said to be good : Divide an onion, and from 
the centre take out a piece the size of a walnut ; fill this cavity 
with a fresh quid of tobacco, and bind the onion in its usual 
»hape. Wrap it in wet paper, and roast it. Trim it down to 
the part discolored by the tobacco ; put it in a phial. Put three 
irops of this juice at one time in the ear. It may give some 
pain upon the first application. 



1060. Catarrh in the Head. — Make a snufT of equal portion! 
of bloodroot, gum Arabic, and gum myrrh. Use it as needed. 



10G1. A Simple Febrifuge. — One teaspoonful of saltpetre and 
6ve grains of ipecac. Mix well ; divide into ten equal parts. 
Give one every hour in flaxseed tea, sage, balm, or catnip. If 
there is nausea, lengthen the time between the doses. 



1062. In Small-Pox to Prevent Pits. — Saturate a cloth with 
sweet oil ; cover the face with it, cutting holes for the eyes, noso, 
and mouth. 



1003. Measles. — Very little medicine is necessary. Nearly 
everything depends upon good nursing. If there is much fever 
give Dover's powders in a little ginger tea. If nausea, give • 
little soda er peppermint water. If the eruptior suddenly dis- 
appears, give a sweat. Should there be great debility, use a 
little wine diluted. The patient should be kept within doors in a 
room comfortably warm. If in bed, the covering should not be 
oppressive. Diet light. The greatest danger from measles if 



802 MRS. 

the liability to relapse. Avoid taking cold. The patieirt must 
not leave the sick-room too soon. If the eyes are weak, darken 
the room. 



1064 Chronic Rheumatism. — A good handful of the hark 01 
*hite ush (the blooms are still better), it may be fresh or dry) 
Steep in a quart of gin. Dose : a tablespoonful three times a day 
If it proves too active a cathartic, lessen the dose. 



1065. Acute Rheumatism. — Take a tablespoonful of No. 6 
three times a day before each meal, rubbing the part affected 
with the same. 



1006. Homeopathic Specifics. — For rheumatisms, neuralgia, 
diseases of the nerves, particularly headache, pain in the eyes, 
restlessness, and inability to sleep, dyspepsia, etc., I have tried 
nothing equal to the homeopathic specifics. 



1067. To Cure Pimples on the Skin. — Drink mullen tea, and 
anoint the skin (rubbing it in well) with milk mixed with as much 
sulphur as the milk will dissolve. Let it set an hour or two, and 
then rub it on. Make only a wineglassful at once. Use before 
washing. 

1068. Disinfectants. — For a room where the disease has 
created a very unpleasant odor, nothing is so good as to burn 
green coffee. Have a small oven or pan half filled with good 
solid coals ; throw upon them a handful of coffee ; pass the vessel 
under the bed and around the room. Darby's Prophylactic 
poured in saucers, and set around the room, is good ; so also iff 
chloride of lime dissolved in water. 



1069. For Spinal Disease. — Bathe spine in salt and water, Of 
rub with tartar-emetic ointment until a good crop of pustules ii 
produced. When these dry, repeat if not relieved. 



MEDICAL RECKIPT8. 393 

107G. For Excoriations upon the Flesh of Infants. — Wash in 
tepid water. Dip a cloth in sweet oil and slightly grease the 
part. Sore navel of an infant : Grate over it very fine nutmeg, 
first cleansing with a suds of Castile soap. 



1071. Cholera Infantum. — Pulverized rhubarb a teaspoonful 
two-thirds full of saleratus or soda, a teacupful of peppermint 
leaves ; pour over a tumbler of boiling water ; sweeten with loaf 
sugar; from a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful for an infant every 
quarter or half hour, as the case requires. Should the stomach 
reject it, persevere and lessen the dose. An adult may take a 
wineglassful. 

1072. Remarks upon Medical Receipts. — Emergencies occu? 
in every family when the services of a physician cannot be pro- 
cured promptly, and something should be done while " waiting 
for the doctor." Many of these "Medical Receipts" will, I hope, 
answer the valuable purpose of relieving suffering humanity. 
Many cases of sickness may be relieved by simple remedies, if 
used in time, without calling in a physician. Some useful direc- 
tions will be found in these receipts. Judgment and discretion 
must be used in giving even " simple remedies." 



1073. Care of a Sick-Room. — Avoid loud talking or whis 
pering ; either extreme is painful to a sick person. Make up the 
pillows, and turn them occasionally ; arrange the bed-clothes 
quietly ; assist the patients to change flieir position ; anticipate 
their wants in giving drink, nourishment, etc., but avoid being 
" fussy." A nervous person would prefer neglect to being per- 
secuted by unnecessary attentions and needless questions. Nevei 
take your seat upon a sick person's bed unless requested to do 
so. Avoid shaking the bed. Darken the room to a mellow, 
twilight light, and so ventilate the room that a draught of air will 
not blow directly upon the patient. If the patient is nervou?, or 
laboring under great excitement, or wishes to sleep, exclude ah 
17*

visitors. Sensible, considerate people will never take offence at 
this course. Wear slippers or cloth shoes ; tread lightly. Lei 
every thing about the room be scrupulously neat. Bathe the face 
and hands of the patient upon awaking in the morning, and 
5 vflener if necessary. Change Jothes and bed-clothing frequently 
:,'A be sure that they are perfectly dry. Follow the direction! 
ii« giving medicine faithfully. Make the medicine, when prepar- 
ing it to be taken, as palatable as possible. Give castor oil in 
hot coffee or toddy ; hold a little vinegar in the mouth before 
taking the oil. Give salts in a little weak pepper tea, or add to 
it a few drops of extract of ginger, or No. 6. Use as little water 
as can be to dissolve the salts. Cover powders with roasted 
apples ; this is better than syrup ; though children may prefer the 
latter. Take pepper tea mixed with sweet milk, and, if liked, 
sweeten it. If taken too strong, the tender coats of the stomach 
will suffer. When food is offered to a sick person, cover the 
waiter with a clean, white napkin, with another napkin laid upon 
the waiter. The china, glass, knife, fork, every thing used, must 
be bright and clean, and a small quantity of food served and 
cooked, so as to be appetizing. Vary the dishes. The same 
things should not be offered every day. Never keep the patient 
waiting any length of time for nourishment ; as far as possible 
anticipate their wants. When broth, soup, or meat is permitted, 
it is well to keep a tender chicken, steak, or birds killed, and in 
readiness. Use only part of the fowl at one time. Never serve 
brv>th or soup smoked or greasy. Black tea is best for invalids. 
Giuels should be boiled a long time, and be thoroughly done. 
Never tempt the appetite of sick persons by offering them unsuit- 
able food. If milk is used, keep it in a cool place; the least 
acidity will injure the patient, unless in cases where buttermilk 
is prescribed. In making toast water, prepare it some time 
before it will be called for; toast the rread without burning. 
If siting up at night is necessary, only permit such persons tc 
assist who will have self-denial and benevolei.ee enough tc refraia 
fiom lead talking, and ltughin^, and reading newspapers; the rat 



MEDICAL RECEIPTS. 805 

tling of the paper in turn.ng sometimes gives exquisite torture. 
The rocking of chairs and other discordant noises must all be 
avoided. " Trifles," it has been said, " make up the sum of 
numan happiness or misery." This is certainly true of a sick 
room. Persons sitting up at night should be invited in ancther 
room if refreshments are furnished, one person remaining * ith 
the patient. A great deal of pain and suffering is inflicted upon 
the sick by a want of consideratiyn, and not the wish or intention 
to be unkind. Never carry a sad, lugubrious face into a sick- 
room. 



1074. Hints to Housekeepers. — Rise early in the morning, o? 
you will not get a fair start with your business. Rise earlier on 
Sunday morning than any other day, that the children may be 
at Sunday-school in time ; and domestics have time to so arrange 
their necessary business as to be able to attend Divine service. 
Do all the cooking for Sunday on Saturday, or, if it is absolutely 
necessary that some cooking be done, have it all completed at 
breakfast, and the fires extinguished for the day. Have the 
house cleaned and every thing put in order on Saturday. On 
Sunday only make the beds, and do such things as are absolutely 
necessary. On Monday it will be necessary to spend more than 
the usual time in cleaning and setting things to rights. On Mon- 
day evening look over the soiled clothes. Mend, and put on 
outtons and strings. Select out the white articles, and put them 
to soak. Have a separate basket or bag for keeping towels, nap- 
itins, and table-cloths. Put them to soak in a vessel to tnem 
selves. The soaking will soften the grease, and make .t easier to 
^ash out. Have the water drawn in barrels, if possible. Expo- 
sure to the air will soften the water, and will give time for the 
■ediments to settle at the bottom. This will be found an excel- 
lent plan, particularly where there is limestone in the water. 
Have the wood cut and every thing in readiness, so that on Tue» 
day the washing may be carried through without interruption. 
Wash colored clothes first, and take them it as soon as they <\tj 



806 mrs. rill's new cook bcok. 

The practice of some washerwomen is to wet colored clothes tot 
late to dry ±«*n, and then pack them away damp until morning. 
Thij is a severe j»nd unnecessary trial to colors. Some colon 
fade from being long exposed to the sun. The ironing of course 
follows the washing, and should be done with as little delay as 
possible, and the cloths assorted and put away. Stockings and 
•ocks should be darned when brought in from the wash. System 
and order must be strictly observed in all household arrangements. 



"A place for everything, and everything in its place." A 
time for certain duties, and the housekeeper must see that there 
is no infringement of the laws that are laid down. Children can- 
aot too soon be taught the importance of order, neatness, and 
economy. A habit of system may be early formed, and prove a 
blessing through life. An ill-governed household, where there is 
neither system, order, neatness, nor frugality, is a bad school for 
children. 

" Never leave things laying about — a shawl here, a pair of 
slippers there, a bonnet somewhere else, trusting to a servant tc 
put them in place. No matter how many servants you have, it is 
a miserable habit. If you set an example of carelessness, do not 
blame your servants for following it. Children should be taught 
to put things back in their places as soon as they are old enough 
to use them, and if each member of a family were to observe tm 
limple rule, the house would never got much out of jrder." 



MISCELLANEOUS 3ECEI1TS. 

1075. Sot p. — The ashes should be strong (hickory i* best^ 
•ui kept dry. When put in the hopper, mix a bushel of un- 
locked lime with ten bushels of ashes ; put in a layer of ashee ; 
then one slight sprinkling of lime; wet each layer with w*»*er (rain 
water is best). A layer of straw should be put upor the bottom 
of the hopper before the ashes are put in. An opening in the 
•ide or bottom for the ley to drip through, and a trough 01 vessel 
Under to receive the ley. When the ley is strong enough to 
bear up an egg y so as to show the size of a dime above the 
surface, it is ready for making soap; until it is, pour it back into 
the hopper, and let it drip through again. Add water to the 
ashes in such quantities as may be needed. Have the vessel 
very clean in which the soap is to be made. Rud th^ pot over 
with corn meal after washing it, and if it is at all discolored, rub 
it over with more until the vessel is perfectly clean. Melt three 
pounds of clean grease ; add to it a gallon of weak ley, a piece 
of alum the size of a walnut. Let this stew until well mixed. 
If strong ley is put to the grease, at first it will not mix well with 
the grease. In an hour add three gallons of strong hot ley ; 
boil briskly, and stir frequently; stir one way. After it haa 
boiled several hours, cool a spoonful upon a plate ; if it does not 
jelly, add a little water ; if this causes it to jelly, then add water 
to the kettle. Stir quickly while the water is poured in until it 
ropes on the stick. As to the quantity of water required to 
make it jelly, judgment must be used ; the quantity will depead 
upon circumstances. It will be well to take some in a bowl, and 
notice what proportion of water is used to produce this effect. 

To harden it : Add a quart of salt to this quantity of soap ; let 
it boil quick tec minutes; let it cool. Next day cut it out. Thia 
i» now ready for washing purposes. 



398 MRS. IIILI/8 NEW COOK TIOOK. 

1076. To Remove Stains and Restore Colors Destroy*! 5$ 
Acids. — Apply ammonia to neutralize the acid ; after which aj> 
ply chloroform. This will rcmov6 paints from garments wbea 
tanzinc has failed. 



1076 J. — Japanned tea-trays should not be washed .n hot water 
If greasy, a little flour rubbed on with a bit of soft linen wi*. 
give them a new look; if there are scratches, rub over a little 
olive oil. 



1077. Potash Soap. — Six pounds of potash, five pounds of 
grease, and a quarter of a pound of powdered rosin ; mix all well 
in a pot, and, when warm, pour on ten gallons of boiling water. 
Boil until thick enough. 

1078. A Superior Receipt. — To make a barrel of potash soap 
(or thirty-two gallons), twenty-five pounds of grease, two pounds 
of rosin pulverized, ten pounds of potash dissolved in twenty- 
eight gallons of hot water. Put the grease and rosin in a pot ; 
add a gallon of hot water to it as the grease becomes hot ; stir it 
well just as it begins to boil ; add the hot potash water slowly, a 
few gallons at once, until all is in. Boil until thick enough. 
Thw receipt is reliable. I have used it over twenty year*. 



1079. Brown Bar Soap. — Take thirty gallons of soft «oap 
eight quarts of salt, and four pounds of rosin pulverized* mi*, 
laid boil half an hour. Tarn it in tubs to oocl. 



MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 309 

Another way : Put grease in a barrel ; add strong ley to cove? 
it ; stir *\ in well. During the year, as the grease increases, 
■dd more iey, an J stir it up frequently ; keep a stick in it fof 
th.s purpose. This will become soap by the time the barrel i* 
full. To harden it : Add a quart of salt to three gallons Df soft 
*oap ; boil half an hour. Turn it out to cocl. Boiling longer 
will harder the soap, without the use of salt. The ley ihat 
remains in the bottom of the tubs after the soap becomes hard 
should be taken care of, and used for scouring. 



1080. To Make Starch. — To make starch from wheat, aend it 
to the mill and have it ground, but not bolted ; put it to soak in 
plenty of water until it ferments. Squeeze all the milky fluid 
from the bran by pressing it between the hands, or by putting it 
in a thin bag ; lay in tubs of cold water, and press as long as any 
white liquid runs. The bran may then soak a few hours, and be 
pressed again. Strain the water through a blanket. Let the 
starch settle to the bottom; pour off the water carefully; add 
fresh water every day ; stir up the starch; let it settle again. 
Repeat the process until the starch is white ; cut it in cakes, and 
dry upon dishes. It is best to have a platform made out-doors ; 
upon this place the tubs. 



1081 Potato Starch. — Grate the potatoes after peeling them, 
rub them through the hands until all the milky fluid has been 
pressed ma. Strain out the hard part of the potato. Let the 
water se» without being disturbed ; the starch will settle a* the 
bottom ; pour off the water ; add fresh water every day. Stir ur 
th« starch : let it settle again. Repeat as in the wheat itaivh 
until the starch is satisfactorily white; then dry. Ke*p in a dry 
place. Frozen potatoes yield more starch than those which hav« 
D& been frozen, but uus\ be used immediately. 

1082. To Prepare Starch for Use. — Wet two tablespconfiili 
of starch tj a smooth paste with cold water; pour to it a pint of 



400 Mrs. hill's new cook book. 

boiling water; put it on the fire; let it boil, stirring frequently 
until it looks transparent; this will probably require half ai 
hour. A id a piece of spermaceti as large as half a nutmeg, 01 
as much salt, or loaf sugar — this will prevent the starch froni 
ticking to the iron. 

1083. To Give a Gloss to Shirt Bosoms. — Half an o-moe 
of white wax, the same quantity each of gum Arabic and isin- 
glass, and ten drops of alcohol ; add half a tumbler of boiling 
water ; mix well, and bottle it. To a quart of starch put a tea- 
spoonful of this preparation. Starch while the article is wet , if 
dry, dip it in hot water, and wring dry ; then starch. Rub the 
starch in well; then press in a towel to remove all on the out- 
side. Spread it out ; wipe over with a clean, dry cloth ; then 
roll snugly ; let it lie an hour or two, and iron. 

Use for ironing shirts a bosom-board, made of seasoned wood 
a foot wide, one and a half long, and an inch thick ; cover it well 
by tacking over very tight two or three folds of flannel, accord 
ing to the thickness of the flannel. Cover it lastly with Canton 
flannel ; this must be drawn over very tight, and tacked well to 
prevent folds when in use. Make slips of fine white cottou 
cloth ; put a clean one on every week. A skirt-board must b* 
made in the same way for ironing dresses ; five feet long, tapei 
ing from two feet at one end to a foot and a half at the other, 
the large end should be round. A clean slip should be upon it 
whenever used. A similar but smaller board should be kept foi 
ironing gentlemen's summer pants. Keep fluting and crimping 
irons, a small iron for ruffles, and a polishing-iron. 



1084. To Starch Muslins, etc. — Add to the starch f'.r fine 
muslins a little white gum Arabic. Keep a bottle of it read} fo» 
Ui>e. Dissolve two ounces in a pint of hot water; bottle it; use 
as may be required, adding it to the starch. Muslins, cali< o«»s, 
etc., should never be stifFer than when new. Rice-'v«^*»r and 
Uinglass stiffen very thin muslins better than starch. 

Old zephyrs can bo made to look new by steaming

For black calicoes: Boil a strong tea of fig-leaves; mix tht 
March for stiffening with this. After washing the article through 
three warm waters, rinse it in the fig-leaf Ua ; when nearly r]r y 
fold; let it rema'a half an hour, and iron immediately. If 
starched articles are not soon ironed they become sour, and 
if q dire a disagreeable smell. This is also the case if the starch 
It suffered to stand too long after being made. Cover starch 
after it is made to prevent its forming a useless skin. Sperma- 
ceti, salt, or loaf sugar will prevent its sticking to the irons. 



1085. To Remove Grease Spots from Calicoes, Muslins, etc. — 
Cover the spots with the yolk of an egg ; then wash off the egg 
after it has remained half an hour ; use no soap on the spot, but 
wash in suds. 



10HG. Where the Colors are Doubtful. — Have two tubs of 
4oap suds ; throw a handful of salt into each. Prepare three 
rinsing waters ; in the last, put to each gallon forty drops of 
elixir vitriol and a teaspoonful of the dissolved gum Arabic. 
Wash through the suds; then rinse; wring well, and dry in the 
shade, where the wind will dry it rapidly. All colored .articles 
should be passed rapidly through the wash, dried, and ironed as 
expeditiously as possible. If colored goods fade, wash each 
article to itself, or the colors will mingle. 

Ox-gall sets dark colors well ; use a tablespoonful to a gallon 
of water. The smell is not pleasant, but exposure to the air will 
«oon destroy it. 

Iron muslins, needle-work, and fine embroidered handkerchiefs 
to the wrong side. 

In washing delicate fabrics, do not rub them; gently squeeze 
and shake them out; pin them to the line, or to some large 
article, and take them in as soon as dry. 

Bran- water is excellent to uie in washing colored cottons of 
delaines, when the colors are not fast. Boil a peck of wheat 
bran and a pint of *alt in five gallons of water, an hour ; let it 



402 

settle; strain the water; wash the ai ticles through it, and rinse 
with water into which forty drops of elixir vitriol to the gallon 
is mixed. Wash all such articles on a clear, windy day, so that the 
%ir will dry them rapidly ; take them in immediately. 



10S7. To Wash Flannel. — Never rub soap upon it; make 
luds by dissolving the soap in warm water ; rinse in warm water. 
Very cold or hot water will shrink flannel. Shake them out 
several minutes before hanging to dry. Blankets are washed in the 
same way. 

1088. To Wash Bombazine. — Make a good soap suds; add 
>x-gall, a tablespoonful to a gallon of water. Press the cloth 
"hrough the hands without rubbing. Rinse in tepid water, into 
which put a little dissolved gum Arabic. Shake the article, 
but do not wring it ; press it carefully with a warm iron on the 
wrong side. 

1089. To Wash Ribbons. — If there are grease spots, rub the 
yolk of an egg upon them, or French chalk on the wrong side; 
let it dry. Lay it upon a clean cloth, and wash upon each side 
with a sponge; press on the wrong side. If very much soiled, 
wash in bran-water ; add to the water in which it is rinsed a little 
muriate of tin to set red, oil of vitriol for green, blue, maroon, 
end bright yellow. 



1090. To Bleach Clothes. — Dissolve a handful of refined 
borax in ten gallons of water ; boil the clothes in it. 

Another way : One ounce of oxalic acid to a pint of water ; a 
tumbler of this to three gallons o^ water. Put in the clothes 
itir well; then rinse twice. To whiten brown cloth, boil il 
weak ley, and expose day and night to the sun and night air 
keep the clothes well sprinkled. 



1091. Washing Mixture. — A gal on of water, one pound of

Save all old cotton and linen rags in bags for sickness. 



1092. To Remove Spermaceti. — Scrape it off; put brown pap u 
on the spot ; upon that, a hot iron. 



1093. To Remove Grease from Silk or Worsted. — RubFrerch 
chalk on the wrong side. Let it remain a day. Split a visiting 
card ; lay the rough side upon the spot, and pass a warm iron 
over. 



1094. Grease Balls. — Mix two ounces of fuller's-earth, a tea 
spoonful of pearl ash or saleratus, and strong vinegar to make 
a stiff paste; make it into balls; dry them. Use it by wetting 
the grease spot ; scrape some of the ball on the place ; dry it, and 
then wash in tepid water. 



1095. Stair j from Acids — Can be removed by spirits of harts- 
norn diluted. Repeat if necessary. 



109G. Tar and Pitch — Can be removed by greasing the place 
w ; th lard or sweet oil. Let it remain a day and night ; then wash 
in suds. Ii silk or worsted, rub the stain with alcohol. 



1097. To Remove Oil from Carpets or Floors. — Keep fuller'* 
eanh upon it wet, renewing until the oil is removed. Add ox 
gall to it to prevent the colors from fadiLg. 



1098. For Rutt and Ink Stains. — Oxalic acid will remove 
iron rust and ink stains. Make a pint bottle full by mixing with 
thit quantity of water half an ounce of the acid. Label it 



404 MRS. HIJ.L'8 NEAV COOK BOOK.

hot water, and apply the acid as often as necessary. Wash very 
soon, in half an hour at least, or the cloth will be injured by tb# 
acid. 



1 09i>. To Remove Mildew. — When the Jothes are washed ai 
ready to boil, pin Jamestown ireed leaves upon the place. Pu 
a handful of the leaves on the bottom of the kettle; lay th« 
stained part next to them. Green tomatoes and salt, aour but 
term ilk, lemon juice, soap and chalk, are all good ; expose to th 
sun. 

Another way : Two ounces of chloride of lime ; pour on it * 
quart of boiling water ; add three quarts of cold water. Steer 
the cloth in it twelve hours. 



1100. To Take Ink Out of Linen. — Scald in hot tallow. Le* 
it cool ; then wash in warm suds. Sometimes these stains can be 
removed by wetting the place in very sour buttermilk or lemon 
juice ; rub salt over, and bleach in the sun. 



1101. For Fruit Stains on napkins, table-cloths , etc. — Poui 
hot water on the spots ; wet with hartshorn or oxalic acid — a tea 
ipoonful to a teacup of water. 



1102. Stains from Scorched Goods. — Boil scorched articles m 
milk and turpentine, half a pound of soap, half a gallon of milk. 
Lay in the sun.

.»g. Rub dry with a soft cotton cloth, and polish with a silk cloth 1 
Furniture is improved by washing it occasionally with soapsuds. 
Wipe dry, and rub over with very little linseed oil upon a clean 
*p »nge or flannel. Wipe polished furniture with silk. Separate 
dusting-cloths and brushes should be kept for highly polished fur- 
niture. When sweeping carpets and dusting walls always cover 
the furniture until the particles of dust floating in the air settle , 
then remove the covers, and wipe with a silk or soft cotton cloth, 



1106. Remarks upon House- Cleaning. — There should be a gen. 
eial house-cleaning every year — in the spring and fall. Always 
begin up-stairs ; clean and put everything to rights, and then de- 
«c^nd. Whitewash once a year ; it freshens and purifies. 



1 1 07. Receipts for Whitewash. — One pound of pulverized alum, 
une pound of rice. Boil these in four gallons of water. Bury a 
barrel three parts in the ground ; pack the dirt around it to pre- 
vent the escape of the steam ; put into it half a bushel of un- 
slacked rock lime. Pour over it the boiling rice water. Stir 
well, and cover for an hour ; then add six gallons of cold witer ; 
stir well, and add a quart of alcohol ; thin it if necessary. 

Ar >ther Put half a bushel of unslacked lime in a barrel ; 
co*er it with hot water; stir occa nonally, and keep the vessoj 
well covered. When s.acked, strain into another barrel through 
a sieve. Put a pound of glue in a glue-pot; melt it over a slow 
tiro until dissolved. Soak the glue in cold water before putting 
the pot over the fire. Dissolve -i peck of salt in coiling water. 
Make a thin paste of three p.unds of ground rice boiled half au 
hour. Stir to thi^half a pound of Spanish whiting. Nr k u\*

the lice paste to the lime; stir it in well; then the glue; mil 
we J; cover the barrel, and let it stand twei ty-four hours, 
Wnen ready to use, it should be put on hot. It mattfls a durable 
wash for outside wails, planks, etc., and may be colored. Spar. if b 
bn wn will make it red or pink, according to the quantity used 
A delicate tinge of this is very pretty for inside walls. Lamp 
black in small quantities will make slate color. Finely puh er 
ized clay mixed irith Spanish brown, makes lilac. Yellow 
chrome or yellow ochre makes yellow. Green must not he 
used ; lime destroys the color, and makes the whitewash peel. 



1108. A Good Whitewash. — Dissolve two pounds of potash in 
five gallons of water; add two pounds of alum. When that dis- 
solves, make a paste by stirring into this a little flour at a time 
until ten pounds of flour is added. Slack a bushel of lime. 
When cold, incorporate it with the first preparation. 



1109. A Cheap Paint — Two quarts of skimmed milk, tw«, 
ounces of fresh lime, five pounds of whiting. Pour the milk 
upon the lime, stirring well ; it will make a mixture resembling 
cream. Sprinkle the whiting over the top ; mix well ; apply with 
a paint brush. This may be colored. 



1110. A Cheap Passage or Kitchen Carpet. — Whip together 
the edges of coarse, strong homespun ; press the seam until it liea 
flat and smooth. Stretch it well, and keep it tacked ; paste some 
Dretty pattern of wall paper upon it as if papering a wall. 
Whet perfectly dry, varnish with two coats of varnish. 



1111. To Clean Carpets. — Shake it well; tack it down, and 
wash it upon the floor ; the floor should be very clean ; use cold 
soap suds; to three gallons add half a tumbler of beef gall ; this 
will prevent the colors from fading. Should there be grease 
spots, apply a mixture of beef-gall, tuller's-earth, and water enough 
to form a paste; put this on before Lucking the carpet down 



MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 407 

Us* tack* inserted in small leather caj6. In & wiping carpet* 
use a soft brush. When it can be done, use straw matting (not 
straw) under the carpets ; they last much better. Cover bricks 
with carpeting; put behind doors to prevent the knobs of lock* 
tj iking against walls. 



1112. To Wash Matting. — Use salt in the water, and wij* 
diy. 



1113. To Wash Oil Cloth. —Take equal parts of skimmed

1115. To Clean Brass. — If stained, rub over with oxalic acid 
or strong vinegar; polish with rotten-stone pulverized and 
whiskey or sweet oil, or turpentine ; then rub with soft leather 01

■oda water. Use the super-carbonate of soda. Soap gives a yel 
Ion tinge, and should not be used. 



408 

1118. To Wash Windows. — Wash well with soap sv.ds ; ring* 
with warm water; rub dry with linen, and finish by polishing with 
•oft dry paper. A fine polish is given to window-glass by brushing 
it over with a paste of whiting. Let it dry ; rub off with paper 
01 sloth, and with a clean, dry brush remove every particle of 
»hf whiting from the corners. Once a year will be altogethei 
riflicient for this.

1120. To Clean Silver. — Wash in hot soap suds (use the sil 
ver soap if convenient) ; then clean with a paste of whiting and 
water, or whiting and whiskey. Polish with buckskin, or clean

1123. Metal Dish Covers. — Wash well everv time they are 
used in hot soap-suds; wipe dry; occasionally rub them over 
with a paste of whiting or with pulverized rotten- stone and sweet 
Oil. The oil should not be rubbed on the inside. 



11?4. To Clean Knives. — Cover a small heavy table o\ 
block by tacking over it very tight soft leather or buckskin ; 
pour over half the leather melted suet. Spread over this very 
6ne pulverized bath brick or Tripoli ; rub the knives (making

or ten feet square, and as deep. Lay a double wall with brick ; 
fill between with pulverized charcoal ; cover the bottom also 
double \* ; th the same or tan-bark. If the pit is filled with ice, or 
nearly so, cover six inches with tan-bark ; but if only a small 
quantity is in it, wrap well in a blanket, and over the opening in 
the pit lay a double bag of charcoal. Whitewash cellars often. 



1130. To Destroy Rats. — Set traps and put a few drops of 
ihodium inside; they are fond of it. Cats are, however, the 
Must reliable rat-traps. There is no difficulty in poisoning rats; 
but they often die in the walls, and create a dreadful effluvium, hard 
to get rid of. When poisoning is attempted, remove o/ cover all 
water vosscls, even the well or < *sti"Ti.

Excess of ceremony shows want of good breeding. That

When invited to partake of another's hospitality, and the invi

anforeseen circumstances prevent the engagement being kept, 
immediately notify the person by sending an explanatory note. 

"There is no social duty which the Supreme Lawgiver mor#

1158. Concluding Remarks. — Before bringing this book to a 
close, I have one request to make of those who will honor my 
receipts by using them, viz., that they be faithfully followed. 
Few persons are aware how much mischief is done by evt,n 
slight deviations. To illustrate: A friend weighed a cake in my 
presence ; a small quantity of flour was left. She deliberated a mo- 
ment, then tossed the flour into the cake, saying : w It is so much 
trouble to go back to the pantry with this, and just that little 
can do no harm." She destroyed the proportions by adding 
more than the specified quantity of flour, and spoiled her cake. 

Receipts are often found fault with, and thrown aside as value- 
less, when the blame lies in the unexact manner in which they are 
t.< ied. 

h has been said that " an author has a right to demand that 
his bock be read in the right place and at the right time." A 
tuonger claim has the author of a book like this to " demand'

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS. 

u Mrs. Holmes' stories are universally read. Her admirers are number- 
less. She is in many respects without a rival in the world of net ion. Her 
characters are always life-like, and she makes then: oalk and act like human 
beluga, subject to tlie same emotions, swayed by tee same passions, and 
actuated by ttie same motives which are common ainoug men and women 
of evcry-day existence. Mrs. Holmes is very happy in portraying domestic 
life. Old and young peruse her stories with great delight, for she writes in 
a style that all cau comprehend."— A" ew York Weekly. 

THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW, vol. 81, page 557, says of Mrs 
Mary .1. Holmes' novel " English Orphaus ":— " \\i';li this novel of Mrs 
Holmes' we have been charmed, aud so have a pretty numerous circle of 
discriminating readers to whom we have lent it. The characterization is 
exquisite, especially so far as concerns rural and -village life, of which 
th re are some pictures that deserve to be hung up in perpetual memory of 
types of humanity fast becoming extinc* The dialogues are generally 
brief, pointed, and appropriate. The plot seems simple, so easily and nat- 
urally is it developed aud consummated. Moreover, the story thus grace- 
f illv constructed and writteu, inculcates without obtruding, not only puio 
Christian morality in general, but, with especial point and power, the 
dependence of true success on character, and of true respectability on 
merit." 

" Mrs. Holmes' stories are all of a domestic character, and their interest, 
therefore, is not so intense as if they were more highly seasoned with sen- 
sationalism, but it is of a healthy and abiding character. The interest in 
her tales begins at once, and is maintaiued to the close. Her sentiments 
are so sound, her sympathies so warm and ready, and her knowledge of 
manners, character, and (he varied incidents of ordiuary life is so thorough, 
that she would find it difficult to write any other than an excellent tale if 
she were to try it."— Boston Banner.

A Prominent Critic says of these Novels : 

u The author's style is beautiful, chaste, and elegant. 
Her ideals are clothed in the most fascinating imagery, and 
her power of delineating character is truly remarkable. One 
of the marked and striking characteristics of each and all 
her works is the purity of sentiment which pervades every 
line, every page, and every chapter."
