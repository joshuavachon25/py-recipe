PREFACE. 



The advanced state of the art of Cookery having rendered 
Mrs. Bundell's book insufficient for the guidance of the modem 
cook, it has been found necessary to remodel her work, and to 
replace those receipts which have become obsolete by others 
founded upon the newer methods adopted by the best cooks 
of the present day. 

The present enlarged collection of original receipts will be 
found to possess strong claims to attention, having been care^Uy 
selected from family MSS., tried and vouched for by the parties 
from whom they have been obtained. In the choice of them 
great attention has been given to the subject of economy^ and 
the arrangement of the whole work, previously enriched with 
the valuable contributions of the late Miss Emma Roberts," 
has been placed under the careftil inspection of a Lady well 
versed in the art of which it treats. The book has had the 
further advantage of being thoroughly revised by a profes- 
sional gentleman of great repute in London, who has also sup- 
plied several valuable receipts. Without wisliing to disparage 
any of the numerous modem productions which have been 
given to the public, it may be affirmed that, although the 
treatises of professional cuisiniers on the subject are valuable 
to those who are competent to carry out their receipts, yet, 
generally speaking, they are too scientific for the comprehension 

• The receipts marked E, B. were contributed by Miss Roberts.

of common cooks, as well as too expensive for the greater 
number of private families. 

It has, therefore, been thought advisable to confine this 
work to a collection of plain and useful receipts, the result 
of experience and practice, adapted for those families of 
moderate fortune in which a certain degree of elegance is 
combined with attention to domestic economy. The number 
of editions * which Mrs. Rundell's celebrated work has passed 
through is the best test of its utility ; and it is confidently 
expected that the number and value of the additional receipts 
and precepts which are contained in this will place it stiH 
higher in public estimation. 

Among the novel features in this volume as now offered to 
the public may be mentioned — 1. the great increase in the 
number and variety of receipts, set forth in a clearer type than 
before ; 2. a greater simplification of language in order to 
render the receipts more easy of comprehension ; 3. the illus- 
trative woodcuts which adorn the present volume ; 4. the new 
system of numbering every separate receipt to facilitate 
reference ; 5. the mode of printing in figures all numbers 
and quantities for the sake of clearness; and 6. the Tables 
for computing household accounts. All these improvements 
will, it is hoped, contribute much to the utility of the work 
and to facilitate the use of it. 

a Upwards of 200,000 copies have been sold.

An inch is the smallest lineal measure to which a name is given, bat 
subdivisions are used for many purposes. Among mechanics, me inch is 
commonly divided into eighths. By the officers of the revenue and by 
scientific persons it is divided into tenths^ hundredths, &c Formerly it 
was made to consist of 12 parts, called lines.

The four last denominations are used for dry goods only. For liquids 
several denominations have been heretofore adopted, viz. : — For Beer, the 
Firkin of 9 Gallons, the Kilderkin of 18, the Barrel of 36, the Hogshead 
of 54, and the Butt of 108 Galls. These will probably continue to be 
used in practice. For Wine and Spirits, there are the Anker, Kunlet, 
Tierce, Hogshead, Puncheon, Pipe, Butt, and Tun ; but these may be 
considered rather as the names of the casks in which such commodities 
are imported, than as expressing any definite number of gallons. It is 
the practice to gauge all such vessels, and to charge them according to 
their actual content. 

Flour is sold nominally by measure, but actually by weight, reckoned 
at 7 lb. Avoirdupois to a Gallon.

If our ancestors made domestic occupations too exclusively 
the aim of female education, it may be truly said that the 
present generation has fallen as imwisely into the contrary 
extreme. Young ladies of our time pride themselves upon 
knowing nothing whatever concerning those duties which most 
assuredly ought to be deemed essential in the mistress of a 
fitmily, and taught as a branch of education. Generally 
speaking, there is a distaste amongst the educated classes of 
the female community of England to the details of house- 
keeping, and particularly to those connected with the kitchen, 
the consequence of which is, that dinners are seldom well 
arranged, or the most made of the materials provided. It is 
indeed a very common, but a very erroneous supposition, that 
attention to culinary affairs is unladylike, and beneath the 
dignity of a gentlewoman ; yet there can be no question that ele- 
gance, comfort, social enjoyment, and, it may be added, health, 
materially depend upon attention to the table ; and the prudent 
management of her family ought to be considered an important 
object amongst the duties of every lady when she marries. 
There are comparatively few persons among the middle

classes of society who can afford to keep professed cooks, their 
wages being too high, and their methods too extravagant. In 
such cases a plain cook is alone attainable, who knows little 
beyond the commonest operations of the kitchen. The mistress 
ought therefore to make herself so far acquainted with cookery 
as to be competent to give proper directions for dressing a 
dinner, and having it properly served up. 

Perhaps there are few occasions on which the respectability 
of a man is more immediately felt, than the style of dinner to 
which he may accidentally bring home a visitor. Every one 
ought to live according to his circumstances, and the meal of 
the tradesman ought not to emulate the entertainments of the 
higher classes; but if merely two or three dishes be well 
served, with the proper accompaniments, the table-linen clean, 
the small sideboard neatly laid, and all that is necessary be at 
hand, the expectation of both the husband and friend will be 
gratified, because no interruption of the domestic arrangements 
will disturb their social intercourse. 

Hence the direction of a talkie is no inconsiderable branch 
of a lady's concern, as it involves judgment in expenditure, 
respectability of appearance, and the comfort of her husband 
as well as of those who partake of their hospitality. Inatten- 
tion to it is always inexcusable, and should be avoided for the 
lady's own sake, as it occasions a disagreeable degree of bustle 
and evident annoyance to herself, which is never observable in 
a well*regulated establishment. In doing the honours of her 
table, the mode of carving is also of importance, and will be 
treated of in a future chapter. 

The mode of covering the table differs in taste. It is not 
the multiplicity of things, but the choice, the dressing, and 
the neat pleasing look of the whole, which give respectability 
to her who presides. The table should be furnished with more 
than the necessary quantity of plate, or plated ware, and glass, 
to afford a certain appearance of elegance ; and if accompanied 
by a clean cloth and a neatly-dressed attendant, it will show 
that the habits of the family are those of gentility. For a 
small party, or a tete-a-tete, a dumb waiter is a convenient 



Chap. I.] DIRECTION OP A TABLE. 



coDtrivance, as it partly saves the attendance of servants. The 
cruets should be looked to and filled every day an hour before 
dinner ; and much trouble and irregularity are saved when 
there is company, if servants are accustomed to prepare the 
table and sideboard in similar order daily. Too many or too 
few dishes are extremes not uncommon : the former encum- 
bering the dinner with a superfluity which partakes of vul- 
. garity, whilst the latter has the appearance of poverty or 
penuriousness. 

In all situations of life the entertainment should be no less 
suited to the station than to the fortime of the entertainer^ and 
to the number and rank of those invited. Without any of 
those attempts, so constantly witnessed, to imitate, with limited 
means, the costly and magnificent banquets of the great, still, 
if the arrangements of the table be properly studied, a d^ree 
of el^ance is attainable under all circmnstances, however eco- 
nomical ; and the plainest ^ire, if dressed with care, may be made 
to furnish dishes which everybody will eat with relish. 

Should there be only a joint and a pudding, they should 
always be served up separately ; and the dishes, however small 
the party, should always form two courses. Thus, in the old- 
feshioned style of " fish, soup, and a roast," the soup and fish 
are placed at the top and bottom of the table, removed by the 
joint with vegetables and pastry ; or, should the company con- 
sist of eight or ten, a couple or more of side dishes in the first 
course, with game and a pudding in the second, accompanied 
by confectionary, is quite sufficient. 

In most of the books which treat of cookery, various bills 
of fare are given, which are never exactly followed. The 
mistress should give a moderate number of those dishes which 
are most in season. The cuts which are inserted in some of 
those lists put the soup in the middle of the table, where it 
should never be placed. For a small party a single lamp in 
the centre is sufficient; but for a larger number the room 
should be lighted with lamps hung over the table, and the 
centre occupied by a plateau of glass or plate, ornamented 
with flowers or figures.

4 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. I. 

The mistress of a &mily should never forget that the welfere 
and good management of the house depend on the eye of the 
superior ; and, consequently, that nothing is too trifling for her 
notice, whereby waste may be avoided or order maintained. If 
she has never been accustomed, while single, to think of 
&mily management, let her not upon that account fear that 
she cannot attain it : she may consult others who are more 
experienced, and acquaint herself with the necessary quanti- 
ties, quality, and prices of the several articles of fitmily ex- 
penditure, in proportion to the number it consists of. The chief 
duties of life are within the reach of humble abilities, and she 
whose aim is to fulfil them will rarely ever fail to acquit her- 
self well. United with, and perhaps crowning all, the virtues 
of the female character, is that well-directed ductility of mind 
which occasionally bends its attention to the smaller objects of 
life, knowing them to be often scarcely less essential than the 
greater. 

A minute account of the annual income and the times of 
payment should be taken in writing ; likewise an estimate of 
the supposed amount of each article of expense ; and those 
who are early accustomed to calculations on domestic articles 
will acquire so accurate a knowledge of what their establish- 
ment requires, as will enable them to keep the happy medium 
between prodigality and parsimony. 

In apportioning the items of expenditure of a &mily, some- 
thing should always be assigned for the use of the poor, which 
enables any pressing case of distress to be at once attended to, 
without a question " whether it can be spared." Much might 
be done for the poor if care were taken to keep a pan into 
which every bone and morsel of spare meat, vegetables, &c., 
were put : these might be stewed, the bones taken out, and a 
few peas added, making a meal, two or three times a-week, for 
any poor deserving fiunily, without increasing the family ex- 
penditure beyond a few pence. 

Perhaps few branches of female education are more useful 
than great readiness in figures. Accounts should be regularly 
kept, and not the smallest article omitted to be entered. If 



Chap. I.] ACCOUNTS — PRICES OP PROVISIONS. 5 

balanced every week or month, the income and outgoings will 
be ascertained with £icility, and their proportions to each other 
be duly observed. Some people fix on stated sums to be ap- 
propriated to each different article, as house, clothes, pocket, 
education of children, &c. Whatever may be the amount of 
household expenditure, a certain mode should be adopted, and 
strictly adhered to. Besides the regular account-book, in which 
the receipt of money and every pa3rment should be r^ularly 
entered, a commonplace-book should be always at hand for the 
entry of observations regarding agreements with servants, 
tradesmen, and various other subjects, so as to enable the lady 
at once to ascertain the exact state of the affairs under her 
immediate management. 

Want of arrangement leads to loss of time, and time, if lost, 
can never be r^ained. Early hours, order, punctuality, and 
method, are its great economists, and caimot be too rigidly 
enforced. If orders be given soon in the morning, there will 
be more time to execute them ; and servants, by doing their 
work without hurry and bustle, wiU be more likely to do it 
well, and fewer might be necessary. To give unvarying rules 
cannot be attempted, as people ought to act differently under 
different circumstances: the minutiae of management must 
therefore be regulated by every one's fortune and rank, but 
there are many general rules which will be found equally ad- 
vantageous to all. 

It is very necessary for the mistress of a family to be in- 
formed of the prices and goodness of all articles in common 
use, and of the best times, as well as places, for purchasing 
them. She should also be acquainted with the comparative 
prices of provisions, in order that she may be able to sub- 
stitute those that are most reasonable, when they will answer 
as well, for others of the same kind, but which are more costly. 
On this, however, it has been properly remarked, in that very 
useful publication ' The Magazine of Domestic Economy,' 
that " small families should never encumber themselves with 
huge and perhaps awkward pieces of even excellent meat, 
under the idea that it ib cheap, because offered below tYi© 



6 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. I. 

market-price : nominally it may be so, but in the end it will 
be found exceedingly dear. A large portion of bone will 
necessarily exist ; and if soups be not wanted, the bones will 
be made no use of, although they not only weigh heavy, but 
are paid for at the same price as the prime parts of the meat." 

Those who cannot afford to give the high prices demanded 
for the best joints are recommended to purchase what are 
termed " the inferior joints," provided they be of the best qua- 
lity : thus, a shoulder of good mutton or veal is far preferable 
to the leg or fillet of an ill-conditioned sheep or calf. Inferior 
meat will never do credit to the cook, but infenoT joints may 
be improved by cookery, and rendered equal to the best. It 
is the same with fish : a good fresh brill being infinitely pre- 
ferable to stale turbot ; while one fresh egg will go as fiur as 
three which have lost their richness by long keeping. In short, 
be assured that the purchase of "cheap things" will generally 
be found false economy. 

Though it is very disagreeable to suspect any one's honesty, 
it is yet prudent to weigh meat, sugar, &c., when brought in, 
and to compare the weight with the charge. It would be as 
well if brewers and bakers were to have tallies with the cook, 
on which every barrel of beer or loaf of bread may be marked, 
as they will serve to prevent overcharges. The butcher should 
be ordered to send a ticket with the meat ; and the cook, after 
weighing the meat, should file these checks, to be examined 
when the weekly bill shall be delivered. Scales should be 
placed in the kitchen, near the door used by the tradespeople. 
The knowledge of such things as weights and scales being in 
use, will operate as a check to any petty fraud which might 
otherwise be contemplated. 

Respecting servants, there are a few things which cannot be 
too strongly urged : one is, never to retain a cook who is not 
fond of her occupation ; for unless she take pleasure in her 
art, she cannot be depended upon ibr accuracy in the prepa- 
ration of dishes with which she is well acquainted, and will 
not easily be induced to acquire anything new. She also 
must possess a natural regard for cleanliness^ or all the pains 



Chap. I.] SEKVANTS. 



in the world will never render her cleanly: where dirty 
habits are manifested, dismissal should follow, for in almost 
every instance they will be found incurable. Another point 
of main importance is her temper; for if that be not good, 
she will be disinclined to receive instructions, and, if found 
&u]t with, may, out of pique, spoil a dinner ; whereas a good- 
humoured, intelligent servant, when made acquainted with 
the habits of the house, and equal to her common duties, will 
hardly fe.il of success when called upon by her mistress to try 
any of those receipts which she has not already used. 

It behoves every person to be extremely careftd whom they 
take into their service ; to be very minute in investigating the 
character they receive, and equally cautious and scrupulously 
just in giving one to others. Were this more generally at- 
tended to, many evils would be avoided which now result from 
worthless servants being put in places of trust. It may be 
fairly asserted that the unfaithfulness of a servant, which is 
but a milder epithet for robbery or waste, will be laid to the 
charge of that master or mistress who, knowing or having 
well-founded suspicions of such faults in a servant, is prevailed 
upon, by false pity or entreaty, to slide her into another 
place ; but, on the other hand, it would be unpardonably unjust 
to refuse to give a fair and candid representation of merits and 
demerits, on any plea whatever. 

As to wages^ it is better to err on the liberal than on the 
niggardly side ; for the trifling difference in wages between 
a good and a bad cook will soon be made up by the former, 
not only in the comfort but the economy of the table. Ser- 
vants' wages should be paid regularly. Perquisites of all kinds 
should be strictly forbidden, as not unfrequently leading to 
pilfering and the corruption of common honesty. Do not allow 
servants to pay your tradesmen's bills, but let the tradesmen 
call for them. Nor should small temptations be laid in the 
way of young servants, particularly females who have the 
care of ladies' dresses and jewellery, as many an honest girl 
has been led to become a thief through the incaution of her 
mistress. 



8 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. I. 

In the hiring of servants it is an excellent plan to agree to 
increase their wages annually to a fixed sum, where it should 
stop, and to recommend that a portion of it should be r^ularly 
placed in a savings-bank. An incentive will thus be offered 
to good conduct ; and when the hoard saved up amounts to 
any considerable sum, the possessor will generally feel more 
inclined to enlarge than to expend it. 

A kindly feeling of indulgence on the part of the mistress 
towards her servants in the matter of petty faults, coupled with 
good-natured attention to their daily comforts, and occasional 
permission to visit and receive a few of their near friends, 
would go far to create a cordial degree of attachment, which 
must be ever desirable to a respectable family, and cheaply 
purchased by such consideration. Mildness of language will 
generally be met by respectful language on the part of a 
servant, and of itself will produce a saving of temper at least 
to the master or mistress. Due praise will mostly be found a 
powerful stimulus to good, and in some measure a preventive 
to bad conduct, on the part of a servant. 

To yoimg beginners in housekeeping, the following brief 
hints on domestic economy, in the management of a moderate 
income, may perhaps not prove unacceptable. 

A bill of parcels and receipt should be required, even if the 
money be paid at the time of purchase ; and, to avoid mis- 
takes, let the goods be compared with these when brought 
home ; or if paid for at :^ture periods, a bill should be sent 
with the article, and regularly filed on separate files for each 
tradesman. 

An inventory of furniture, linen, and china should be kept, 
and the things examined by it twice a-year, or oftener if there 
be a change of servants ; the articles used by servants should 
be intrusted to their care, with a list, as is done with plate. In 
articles not in common use, such as spare bedding, tickets of 
parchment, numbered and specifying to what they belong, 
should be sewed on each ; and minor articles in daily use, such as 
household cloths and kitchen requisites, should be occasionally 
looked to. The best means to preserve blankets from moths 



Chap. I.] HINTS ON DOMESTIC ECONOMY. 



is to fold and lay them under the feather-beds that are in use, 
and shake them occasionally ; when soiled, they should be 
washed, not scoured. 

The most durable sort of linen for sheeting is the Kussia, 
Grerman, or Irish febrics, a good stock of which, as well as of 
table-linen, should be laid in to avoid the necessity of frequent 
or irregular washing. 

A proper quantity of household articles should always be 
allowed for daily use. Each should also be kept in its proper 
place, and applied to its proper use. Let all repairs be done as 
soon as wanted, remembering the old adage of " a stitch in time ;" 
and never, if possible, defer any necessary household concern 
a moment beyond the time when it ought to be attended to. 

In the purchase of glass and crockery- ware, either the most 
customary patterns should be chosen, in order to secure their 
being easily matched when broken ; or, if a scarce design be 
adopted, an extra quantity should be bought, to guard against 
the annoyance of the set being spoiled by breakage, which in 
the course of time must be expected to happen. There should 
likewise be plenty of common dishes, that the table-set may not 
be used for putting away cold meat, &c. 

The cook should be encouraged to be careful of coals and 
cinders : for the latter there is a new contrivance for sifting, 
without dispersing the dust, by means of a covered tin bucket. 

Small coal wetted makes the strongest fire for the back of 
the grate, but must remain untouched till it cakes. Cinders 
lightly wetted give a great degree of heat, and are better than 
coal for furnaces, ironing-stoves, and ovens. 

A Store-room is essential for the custody of articles in con- 
stant use, as well as for others which are only occasionally 
called for. These should be at hand when wanted, each in 
separate drawers, or on shelves and pegs, all under the lock 
and key of the mistress, and never given out to the servants 
but under her inspection. 

Pickles and preserves, prepared and purchased sauces, and 
all sorts of groceries, should be there stored ; the spices pounded 
and corked up in small bottles, sugar broken, and everytlam^ 



10 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. I. 

in readiness for use. Lemon-peel, thyme, parsley, and all sorts 
of sweet herbs, should be dried and grated for use in seasons of 
plenty ; the tops of tongues saved, and dried for grating into 
omelettes, &c. ; and care taken that nothing be wasted that 
can be turned to good account. 

Bread is so heavy an article of expense, that all waste should 
be guarded against, and having it cut in the room will tend 
much to prevent it ; but, for company, small rolls, placed in or 
on the napkin of each guest, are the most convenient, as well 
as the most elegant. Bread should be kept in earthen pans 
with covers. 

Sugar being also an article of considerable expense in 
all ^unilies, the purchase demands particular attention. The 
cheapest does not go so far as that more refined, and there is a 
difference even in the degree of sweetness. The close, heavy, 
and shining white, or loaf-sugar, should be chosen. The best 
sort of brown has a bright, crystalline appearance, as if mixed 
with salt, and, if feeling coarse when rubbed between the fingers, 
is better than when more powdery. East India sugars are finer 
for the price, but not so strong, consequently unfit for wines 
and sweetmeats, but do well for common purposes. To pound 
white sugar, rolling it with a bottle, and sifting, wastes it less 
than a mortar. 

Both soap and tallow candles are improved by keeping, 
and are best when made in cool weather ; at which time it will 
be prudent to lay in a stock of both. They are, indeed, better 
for being kept eight or ten months, nor will they injure for 
two years if kept in a cool place ; and there are few articles 
that better deserve care in buying, and allowing a regulated 
quantity of, according to the size of the family. As to the 
sort of moulds, " short sixes " are the best for common domes- 
tic purposes, as, after dinner, workers or readers are better 
accommodated with light from candles of that size and height 
than from those called " long sixes,*' which look poor and thin ; 
but "fours" are preferable to either. Of kitchen candles, 
those of ten to the pound will be found more serviceable than 
either eight or twelve.

Soap should be cut in pieces that will make a long square, 
when iirst brought in, and kept out of the air two or three 
weeks ; for, if it dries quickly, it will crack, and, when wet, 
break. Put it on a shelf, leaving a space between each piece, 
and let it grow bard gradually : thus it will save a full third 
in the consumption ; but, for coarse washing, snft toap will go 
fbrther than the hard. 
I Soda, by softening the water, saves a great deal of soap. 
It Ehould be melted in a large jug of water, Bome of which 
pour into the tubs and boiler ; and when the latter becomes 
weak add more. The new improvement in soft soap is, if pro- 
perly used, a saving of nearly half in quantity, and, though 
Bxnewhat dearer than the hard, reduces the price of washing 
connderably. 

Many g;ood laundresses advise soaping linen in warm water 
the night previous to washing, as &cilitating the operation 
with less fiiction. 

The price of starch depends upon that of flour ; the best 
will keep good in a. dry warm room for some years. 

Everything should be kept in the place best suited to it, as 
niuch waste may thereby be avoided. 

Great care should be taken of jelly-bags, tapes for collared 
things, &c., which, if not perfectly scalded and kept dry, give 
an unpleasant flavour when next used.

salt ; candlesy cold, but not damp ; dried meats, hams, bacon, 
and tongues, the same. All sorts of seed for puddings, such 
as rice, &c., should be close covered, to preserve them from 
insects : but if kept long that will not be sufficient, unless they 
be occasionally sifted. Apples and pears should be laid upon 
very clean and dry straw, to prevent a musty taste ; nor should 
they be exposed to either light or air, and the floor of a dark 
garret is a good place in which to deposit them ; or, what is 
still better, shelves made by strips of wood, of about 2 inches 
wide, placed an inch and a half apart, and the apples laid be- 
tween them. They should be ranged singly in rows, without 
touching each other, and should be often inspected, both to 
wipe them, if damp, and to reject those which may appear to 
be getting rotten; but the larger sort of pears should be 
tied up by the stalk. Apples may also be preserved in excel- 
lent condition for a long period by being packed in large bar- 
rels with dry sand, but require to be used immediately they 
are taken out. 

Coarse nets suspended in the store-room are very useful in 
preserving the finer kinds of fruit, lemons, &c., which are 
spoiled if allowed to touch. When lemons and oranges are 
cheap, a proper quantity should be bought and prepared, both 
for preserving the juice, and keeping the peel for sweetmeats 
and grating, especially by those who live in the country, where 
they cannot always be had ; and they are perpetually wanted 
in cookery. 

The best way of scalding fiiiits, or boiling vinegar, is in a 
stone jar, on a hot iron hearth, or by putting the vessel into 
a saucepan of boiling water, called a water-bath, after its 
having been closely corked, but not quite filled, as the heat 
may occasion the fruits to swell ; but if they diminish after this 
is done, the vessel must then be filled. 

Onions^ shallots, and garlic should be himg up, for winter 
use, in ropes from the ceiling ; as should dried parsley, basil, 
savory, and knotted-marjoram, or London-thyme, and tarra^ 
gon, to be used when herbs are ordered, but with discretion, 
as they are very pungent.

When whites of eggs are used for jelly, or other purposes, 
contrive to have pudding, custard, &c., to employ the yolks 
also ; and when only the yolks are wanted, the whites can be 
made with milk into blancmange. Should you not want them 
for several hours, beat them up with a little water, and put 
them in a cool place, or they will be hardened and useless. It 
was a mistake of old to think that the whites made cakes and 
puddings heavy ; on the contrary, if beaten long and sepa- 
rately, they contribute greatly to give lightness, and are idso 
an advantage to paste.

Although carving with ease and elegance is a very neces- 
sary accomplishment, yet most people are lamentably deficient 
not only in the art of dissecting winged game and poultiy, 
but also in the important point of knowing the parts most 
generally esteemed. Practice only can make good carvers ; 
but the directions here given, with accompanying plates, will 
enable any one to disjoint a fowl and avoid the awkwanlness 
of disfiguring a joint. 

In the first place, whatever is to be carved should be set in 
a dish sufficiently large for turning it if necessary ; but the 
dish itself should not be moved from its position, which should 
be so close before the carver as only to leave room for the 
plates. The carving-knife should be light, sharp, well- 
tempered, and of a size proportioned to the joint, strength 
being less required than address in the manner of using it. 
Large solid joints, such as ham, fillet of veal, and salt beef, 
cannot be cut too thin ; but mutton, roast pork, and the other 
joints of veal, should never be served in very slender slices. 
A Sound (buttock) or Aitch-bone of Seef.—PatG off from 
the upper part, of either, a 
slice from the whole sur- 
face, of about ^ an inch 
thick, and put it aside;

tion from a to b. The 
soft fat, which resembles 
manow, lies at the back

Ribs of Be^. — Cut along the whole length of the bone, 
from end to end, a to b, either commencing in the centre or 
at one side, having the thin end towards you ; but if eut from 
the bone and formed into a round, with the fat end doubled 
into the centre, it must then 
be cut in the same manner 
n the round of beef. 

Sirlma of Beef.— Cut in

ribs, commencing either at 
the centre or the side, g 
from a to b. The under ^ 
put aliould be cut across 
the bone, aa at c for the Sirloin of B«f. 

lean, and d for the rich fat'; many persons prefer the under 
to the upper part, the meat being more tender. 

Fillet of Veal.— Carve 
it in the same manner as 
the round of beef; but 
the upper slice should be 
cut somewhat thinner as 
most persons like a little 
of the brown, and a por 
tion of it should be served 
along with each slice to 
gether with a slice of the

manner as sirloin of beef, but should be turned up and the 
whole of the kidney and iat cut out ; the fat being usually 
put upoa a dty toast and served as marrow. The loin is then 
returned to its former position, and the meat should be cut 
across the ribe as in the neck, serving it with a slice of kidnqr. 
Breast of Veal, being very gristly, is not easily divided 
into pieces. In order, therefore, to avoid this difficulty, put 
your knife at a, about 4 inches from the edge of the thickest 
part (which is 
called " the bris- 
ket "), and cut 
through it tod, to 
separate it from 
: the hmg ribs; cut 
the short bones 
acro83,as at d,d,d, 
and the long caics 
as at c, c, c ; ask 
which is chosen, and help accordingly. The remaining scrag 
part is seldom served at table, but forms an excellent stew 
when dressed in the French mode. 

Shoulder of Veal. — Cut in the same manner as a shoulder 
of mutton, beginning on the under side. 

Calfi Head. — Cut slices from a to fi in the figure, which 
describes only half the head, letting the knife go close to the 
bone. Many like

cut out with the

knife, and divide 
in two, along 
with some of the 
glutinous bits 
which surround it. If the jaw-bone be taken off, there will 
be found some fine lean, and under the head is the palate, 
which is reckoned a delicacy. 

The tongue and brains are dished separately, but served in 
small portions along with the head.

Should it be intended to reserve a portion of the joint to be 
eaten cold, all this undermost part should be first cut away and 
served separately, both as it eats better hot than cold, and as 
the upper remaining part will appear more sightly on the table. 

Loin of Mutton. — Cut the joints into chops and serve them 
separately ; or cut slices the whole length of the loin ; or run 
the knife along the chine-bone, and then slice it, the £it and 
lean together, as shown in the cut of the saddle, below. 

Neck of Mviton, — It should be prepared for table as 
follows : — Cut off the scrag ; have the chine-bone carefully 
sawn off, and also the top of the long bones (about li inch), 
and the thin part turned under ; carve in the direction of the 
bones. 

The scrag of mutton^ when roasted, is very frequently sepa- 
rated from the ribs of the neck, and in that case the meat and 
bones may be helped together. 

Saddle of Mutton. — Cut in long and rather thin slices j&om 
the tail to the end, beginning at each side close to the back- 
bone, from a to 6, 
with slices of fiit 
from c to d; or 
along the bone which

it the whole of the

both fat and lean. The tail end is usually divided and partly 
turned up. Some butchers also skewer the kidneys across 
the incision, but it is not usual at genteel tables, and the inci- 
sion Ls better omitted. 

Haunch of Mutton. — A haimch is the leg and part of the 
loin, and is cut in the same manner as a haunch of venison. 

Fore- Quarter of Lamb, — Pass the knife under the shoulder 
in the direction of a, c, b, d, so as to separate it from the ribs 
without cutting the meat too much off the bones. A Seville 
orange or lemon should then be divided, the halves sprinkled 
with salt and pepper, and the juice squeezed over the under part.

Haunch of Venison, — Have the joint lengthwise before 
you, the knuckle being the furthest point. Cut from a to h 
but be careful 
not to let out 
the gravy ; then 
cut along the 
whole length 
fixnn a down to 
d. The knife 
should slope in 
making the first 
cut, and then the whole of the gravy will be received in the 
weU. The greater part of the fat, which is the favourite 
portion, will be found at the left side, and care must be taken 
to serve some with each slice. 

Neck of Venison. — Cut across the ribs diagonally ; or it 
may be cut in slices the whole length of the neck. The first 
method is equally good, and much more economical. 

Roebuck, — A species of venison but little known in this 
country, but which will in all probability be shortly brought 
by the steamers from the north of Europe. The animal is 
small, but the flesh, although, like hare, without fat. is very 
much esteemed as a delicacy. The common mode of serving 
it is to cut off the limbs, which are used in soups or stews, 
and to bring only the chine to table, cutting it in long slices 
from head to tail, and generally sufficient for a dozen people. 
The fatan, both of the roebuck and fallow-deer, is usually 
carv«d in the same manner.

old, and are then roasted whole. 

Pork. — In helping the roast loin and leg;, your knife muat 
follow the direction of Uie scores cut by the cook upon tlie 
skin which forms the crackling, as it is too crisp for being 
omveniently divided, and cannot therefore be cut across the 
btxtes of the ribs, as in loin of mutton. The scores upon the 
roasted leg are, however, always marked too broadly for single 
cuts ; the crackling must therefore be lifted up fixnn the back 
to allow of thin slices being cut from the meat : the seaaoaing 
is under the skin at the larger end. 

Ham. — Serve it with the back upwards, sometimes orna- 
mented, and g^erally having, as in France, the ahank-btme 
covered with cut paper. Be-

it is then carved lengthwise from e ta d. 

Boiled Tongue should always be cut crosswise, not going

is sait to table— as thus — and garnishes the dish wiUi the jaws

pieces may be cut irom them. The ribs are reckoned the 
finest part ; but some people prefer the neck end, between the 
shoulders. 

Hare. — Put the point of the knife under the shoulder at 6, 
aad so cut all the way down to the rump, along the sides of 
the backbone, in the line 6, a, cutting it in moderately thick 
slices ; or, after removing the shoulders and legs, cut the back 
crosswise in 4 or 5 pieces ; but this can only be done when the 
hare is very young or when it is boned. To separate the legs 
and shoulders, put the 
knife between the leg 
and back, and give it 
a little turn inwards at 
the joint, which you 
most endeavour to hit, 
and not to break by 
fiMTce. The shoulders 
may be removed by a circular cut around them ; but, although 
called the " sportsman's portion," are generally thought in- 
ferior, and are seldom served until the other parts have dis- 
appeared. The back is the most delicate part, and next to 
that the thighs. A portion of the stuffing should be served 
with each slice. The brains and ears of sucking-pig, hare, 
and rabbit, are also considered epicurean tit-bits, which must 
not be neglected ; wherefore, when every one is helped, cut 
off the h^, put your knife between the upper and lower 
jaw and divide them, which will enable you to lay the upper 
flat on your plate ; then put the point of the knife into the 
centre, and cut the head into two. 

Roast Mabbits, — Proceed as for hare. 

Boiled Rabbits, — ^The legs and shoulders should be first 
taken off, and then 
the back cut across 
into 2 parts, which 
is easily done by a 
bend of the knife in 
the joint underneath, 
about the middle of 
the back. The back, as in the hare, is the best, and some oi 
the liver should always accompany it.

The carving of both winged game and poitltrt requires 
more delicacy of hand and nicetj in hitting the joints than the 
catting of large pieces of meat, and, to be neatly done, requires 
considerable practice. 

Ito(ut Turkey. — Cut long slices firom each side of the breast-, 
down to the ribs, beginning at a 6 from the wing to the breast- 
bone. If the party 
be so large as to ren- 
der it necessary, the 
legs may then be re- 
moved, and the thighs 
divided from the 
drum-sticks, which 
are only served in 
cases of necessity, as 
being rather toUgh ; but the pinions of the wing are very 
savoury, and the white part of the wing is preferred by many to 
the flesh of the breast. The joint of the pmicm may be found 
a little below 5, and the wing may then be easily removed 
without touching the leg:. The carcase is very seldom dis- 
sected, but the body is firequ^itly filled with either truffles, 
mushrooms, or other matter, in which case an op^iing must be 
made into it by cutting a circular incision through ^e s^ron, 
at c. 

Boiled Turkey is carved 
in the same way as the roast, 
t]ie only difference being in 
the trussing : the legs in the 
boiled being, as here shown, 
drawn into the body, and in 
the roast skewered. 

Boiled Turkey. Turkey Poults are carved 

and helped in the same way 
as pheasants ; the stuffing of the grown birds being usually 
omitted. 

Roast Fowl, — Slip the knife between the leg and body, 
and cut to the bone ; then with the fork turn the 1^ back, 
and the joint will give way if the bird is not old. Take the, 
wing ofT in the direction of a to i, only dividing the joint with 
jour knife. When the four quarters are thus removed, take.

by putting in the knife at c

break off fix)m the part that

next thing is to divide the 

breast from the carcase, by 

cutting through the tender 

ribs close to the breast, 

quite down to the tail. Then lay the back upwards, put your 

knife into the bone half way from the neck to the rump, and

on raising the lower end it will separate readily. Turn the 
rump from you, take off the two sidesmen, and the whole will 
be done. To separate the thigh from the drumstick of the leg 
insert the knife into the joint as above. It requires practice to 
hit the joint at the first trial. The breast and wings are con- 
sidered the best parts. 

K the bird be a capon, or large, and roasted, the breast may 
be cut into slices in the same way as a pheasant.

served along with some of the other parts.

partridge, except that the trail, or entrails, of the two latter is 
served up on toast. As regards these different sorts of game, 
the thigh of the pheasant and the woodcock is the best, and 
the breast and wing of the partridge and grouse; but the 
most epicurean morsel of all is the trail of the woodcock 
served upon toast. Land-rail, wheat-ear, larks, and all the 
smaller birds, should always be helped as they are roasted, 
whole.

The commonly received idea, that what goes under the daio- 
mination of " good plain living" — that is, joints of meat, roast 
or boiled — is best suited to &Q constitutions, has been proved 
to be a Mhcj, Many persons can bear testimony to the 
truth of Dr. Etchener*s remark, that elaborate culinary pro- 
cesses are frequently necessary in order to prepare food for the 
digestive organs, which are but too frequently taxed beyond 
their power. Indeed, it may be truly said that many persons 
actually lose their lives by over indulgence in food rendered 
indigestible by being badly cooked. 

Until a comparatively late period the art of cookery was 
almost in a state of infancy, for our ancestors were, with few 
exceptions, content with the most simple, or rather, imperfect, 
preparation of their food, and " made dishes" were very little 
known. Of late years, however, it has gradually risen to a 
branch of science, founded on practical experience, combined 
with a knowledge of chemistry; and the numerous works 
published on its improvement, both in this coimtry and on the 
Continent, have brought it to a degree of perfection which its 
early professors never expected to attain. This remark applies, 
however, rather more to the cookery of animal than of vege- 
table food, for, in England, vegetables are chiefly used as an 
accompaniment to meat, while — ^as will be hereafter shown — 
many delicacies of the kitchen-garden may, if properly dressed, 
be rendered very palatable dishes to be eaten alone. 

It is our intention to endeavour to correct the prejudice in 
favour of a family joint — by showing, that it is not only very 
often improperly cooked, but that the same quantity of meat, 



,'hap. m.] FOOD AND COOKERY. 29 

if dressed in different ways, still retaining a certain degree of 
simplicity, will be more pleasant to the palate, more healthful, 
and quite as economical, if brought to the table as two or three 
dishes instead of one. 

In French cookery, those substances which are not intended 
to be broiled or roasted, are usually stewed for several hours 
at a temperature below the boiling-point ; by which means the 
most refractory articles, whether of animal or vegetable origin, 
aie more or less reduced to a state of pulp, and admirably 
adapted for the further action of the stomach. In the 
common cookery of this country, on the contrary, articles are 
usually put at once into a large quantity of water, and sub- 
mitted, without care or attention, to the boiling temperature : 
the consequence of which is, that most animal substances, 
when taken out, are harder and more indigestible than in the 
natural state. 

DIET AND DIGESTION. 

From Dr. Beaumont's Tables it appears that the following 
articles are converted into chyle, t. e. digested, in the times 
indicated : — 



Rice, boiled soft .... 1 

Apples, sweet and ripe . . 1 80 

Sago, boiled 1 45 

Tapioca, Barley, stale Bread, 
Cabbage with Vinegar, raw,

Bread Com, baked, and Car- 
rots, boiled 3 15 

Potatoes and Turnips, boiled ; 
Batter and Cheese . • . 3 30 

When the powers of the stomach are weak, a hard and crude 
English diet is sure to produce discomfort by promoting acidity .- 
while the very same articles when divided, and weU cooke( 
upon French principles, or rather the principles of commoi 
sense, can be taken with impunity, and easily digested. 

There are only a few persons — with the exception perhaj 
of those who take violent exercise, or work hard in the op< 
air — who can dine heartily upon solid food without auffetV

from its effects. When people sit down to table with a good 
appetite, it is difficult to persuade them to eat only half the 
quantity for which they feel disposed ; but it is very certain 
that, in order to escape the horrors of indigestion, plain roast 
or boiled meat should be very sparingly consumed. Partly 
upon the erroneous supposition that it is the most wholesome 
species of food, and partly to avoid the trouble of providing 
anything else, a whole family, however various their consti- 
tutions may be, are seated at table before a single joint, to 
take their chance of suffering from the repletion which even 
a small portion may occasion to a delicate person, who could 
have partaken of three or four judiciously-dressed dishes with- 
out sustaining the slightest inconvenience. The stomach, in 
fact, never performs its duties so effectually as when it acts 
upon food composed of much variety. Indeed the united 
testimony of high medical authority proves that a variety 
of well-dressed food is more easy of digestion, and conse- 
quently more salutary, than when the meal is confined to one 
sort of solid meat. 

Foreigners are so well aware of this, that they never dine 
on a single dish. They always commence the meal with soup, 
or rather weak potage, followed by some small dishes of meat 
and vegetables, thoroughly done and eaten separately ; and 
although they usually eat full as much as the English, yet 
their dinner sits light upon the stomach, without any com- 
plaint of that drowsy sense of indigestion of which we hear so 
much in England, that our newspapers are filled with adver- 
tisements for its cure. 

In England, cookery in small respectable families, where 
it is necessary to study economy, has also to contend with a 
prejudice concerning the vulgarity of certain viands ; many 
portions of an animal, which in France are in great esteem, 
being rejected in this country upon very insufficient grounds. 
The very coarsest joints may be so refined in the culinary 
process as to retain nothing offensive either to the eye or the 
palate, while the vulgarity must consist in the manner in which 
the viands are served, and not in the viands themselves. It is 
the province of the cook to render unsightly objects pleasing ; 
and thus many things may be brought to table in disguise, 
which would not be admissible in their original forms. A good 
housekeeper will never offer the first essay of her cook to her 
company: the dish should be tried by the family party, and 



Chap. HI.] FOOD AND COOKERY. 31 

not placed before guests until practice has rendered it perfect. 
By this means the chances of failure are in a great measure 
avoided ; and, by not undertaking more than can be accom- 
plished, success may be contemplated with some degree of 
confidence. Indeed, if any of the present receipts are put into 
the hands of an intelligent woman, she will find no difficulty 
in carrying them completely into effect. 

The foundation of all good cookery consists in preparing 
the meat so as to render it tender in substance, without ex- 
tracting from it those juices which constitute its true flavour, 
in doing which, the main point in the art of making those 
soups, sauces, and made dishes of every sort, which now form 
80 large a portion of every well-ordered dinner, as well, also, 
as in cooking many of the plain family joints — is boiling, o» 
rather stewing, which ought always to be performed over a 
slow fire. There is, in fact, no error so common among all 
English cooks as that of boiling meat over a strong fire, which 
renders large joints hard and partly tasteless ; while, if sim- 
mered during nearly double the time, with less than half the 
quantity of fuel and water, and never allowed to " boil up," 
the meat, without being too much done, will be found both 
pliant to the tooth and savoury to the palate. 

For instance. The most common and almost universal dish 
throughout France, is a large piece of plainly-boiled fresh 
beef, from which the soup — or ^' potage" as it is there called — 
has been partly made, and which is separately served up as 
" bouilli,'* accompanied by strong gravy, and minced vege- 
tables, or stewed cabbage. Now this, as constantly dressed 
in the French mode, is ever delicate both in fibre and flavour ; 
while, in the English manner of boiling it, it is almost always 
hard and insipid. The reason of which, as explained by that 
celebrated cook, Careme, who superintended the kitchen of 
His Majesty George IV., is this : — " The meat, instead of 
being put down to boil, as in our method, is there put in the 
pot with the usual quantity of cold water, and placed at the 
corner of the fireplace, where, slowly becoming hot, the heat 
gradually swells the muscular fibres of the beef, dissolving 
the gelatinous substances therein contained, and disengaging 
that portion which chemists term ' osmazome,' and which 
imparts savour to the flesh — thus both rendering the meat 
tender and palatable, and the broth relishing and nutiilive •, 
whilst, on the contrary, if the pot be inconsiderately put \i^u

too quick a fire, the boiling is precipitated, the fibre coagu- 
lates and hardens, the osmazome is hindered from disengaging 
itself, and thus nothing is obtained but a piece of tough meat, 
and a broth without taste or succulence." 

To stew, — This wholesome and economical mode of cookery 
is not so well understood nor profited by in England as on the 
Continent. So very small a quantity of fuel is wanted to sus- 
tain the gentle heat which it requires, that this alone should 
recommend it to the careful housekeeper ; but if properly at- 
tended to, meat stewed gently in close-shutting or luted vessels 
is in every respect equal, if not superior, to that which is roasted, 
but it must be simmered only, and in the gentlest manner. 

On the subject of stewing meat the following hint may be 
advantageously adopted : — " Take a piece of boiling-beef, with 
some &t to it and a little seasoning, but without water, gravy, 
or liquid of any sort. Put it in an earthen jug closely covered, 
and place that within a large iron or tin pot filled with cold 
water, and lay it so near the fire as to keep a gentle simmer, 
without letting it boil. It will require several hours, accord- 
ing to the weight of the meat, which should be stewed until 
quite tender. It loses nothing, and will yield a large quantity 
of the richest gravy, as retaining the whole of its juice, and is 
decidedly the best mode of dressing that universal French dish, 
bceuf-bouiUi/* * 

To roast in perfection is not only a most difficult but a 
most essential branch of cookery, and can only be acquired 
by practice, though it consists in simply dressing the joint 
thoroughly, without drying up any portion of its juices. If 
this, however, be not strictly attended to, the meat will be 
spoiled, and the error cannot be rectified. 

A brisk, but not too strong, fire, should be made up in good 
time, and care taken that it is sufficiently wide to take in the 
joint, leaving two or three inches to spare at each end, and of 
equal strength throughout. The fat should be protected by 
covering it with oiled paper, tied on with twine. The meat 
should not be put very near the fire at first, or the outside 
will become scorched, dry, and hard, while thie inside will be 
underdone ; but it should be put gradually nearer to the fire 
when about warmed through, or it will become soddened, and 
the screen should be placed before it from the commencement. 

* Transactions of the Royal Society of Agriculture, vol. iii. p. 88. 



Chap. IH.] FOOD AND COOKERY. 33 

The more the meat is basted the better it will be when dressed, 
and the cook should not be sparing of her trouble in this re- 
spect. She should remove the paper a short time before sending 
the joint to table, sprinkling it with salt, and dredging it 
lightly with flour, in order to give it a savoury brown appear- 
ance ; but do not put salt to it before it is nearly dressed, as 
it would tend to draw out the gravy. 

Meat which has been fresh killed will take a longer time 
to roast than that which has been kept any time ; and in 
warm weather twenty minutes less time should be allowed for 
the roasting of a good-sized joint than when the weather is 
cold. Time, distance, basting often, and a clear fire of a 
proper size for what is required, are the first points of a good 
cook's attention in roasting. 

In preparing meat for roasting by smoke-jack, the cook must 
be careful that the spit be wiped before it is used, and also 
when withdrawn from the meat, or its mark will appear in a 
black stain. She must avoid running the spit through the 
prime parts.*^ In some joints, as necks, it may enter two 
bones from the end, run up the back until it comes to nearly 
the other end, and the prime of the meat will not be pierced. 
Leaden skewers of diiferent weights should be in readiness, for 
want of which unskilful servants are often at a loss at the time 
of spitting. Cradle-spits answer best ; they may be bought of 
different sizes. The joints of all necks and loins should be 
nicked before they are dressed. 

After the cook has taken up the roast meat, she should pour 
the fet from the dripping-pan into a basin previously wetted 
with cold water. The next day, when cold, she should scrape 
off the fine meat-jelly which will be found adhering to the 
under part, and put it in a suitable vessel for present use, as 
an assistant to gravies. The dripping then should be melted 
and strained. If required to be kept long, it should be 
strained into cold water, and taken off when cold in cakes, and 
these cakes laid between sheets of writing-paper in a dry place. 
So much depends upon the taste of parties in the mode of 
over or under dressing, that it is difficult to say how long a 
joint of meat of a certain size should be roasted ; but, pre- 
suming that a good fire is kept up, and that the meat is 
intended to be well done, a piece of beef — say of 12 to 15 lbs. 

■ These rules are equally applicable to the hook used in the bottVe-^acV.

weight — shoakL in winter, be puifi c ilf lauted in finom 3 to 
Si boors. The oommoD rule is. i of an boor to each lb. ; 
but a thick joint — such. §6t instanoe. as a arloin of beef or 
leg of mutton — will require imther more time than the ribs or 
sbooMer : and meat that has been hong for some days requires 
less roasting than that which has been newhr killed ; mnttoD, 
somewhat less than beef: but real. pork, and all sorts of 
white meat, shoold be so thmooghlr roasted as not to show 
any appearance of red grsTy. 

Some cooks recommend a method of roastii^ joints of meat 
in a slow manner^ before a large fire, and placing them at a 
much greater distance finom the fire than in the common way ; 
on the principle, as they say, ^' that it renders the meat more 
tender, and better retains the g ia %\ .^ This, however, we 
deny ; for it does not retain more of the srraTT, and it makes 
the flesh soft and insipid or flabby, instead of imparting to it 
that degree of cri^ness which is caused by the ordinary mode. 
It also has the further disadvantage of occasioning double the 
expenditure of coals, and requiring twice the usual time. But 
we admit, that, if the joint be very large, this method should 
be adopted when it is first put to the fire, putting it nearer by 



To boil, — ^All meat for boiling should be entirely covered 
with cold water, and placed on a moderate fire, the scum 
bdng carefully taken off as it rises, which will be in general a 
few minutes before it boils. This should be done with g^reat 
care, as, if neglected, the scum will sink and adhere to the 
joint, giving it a very disagreeable appearance. The ketUe 
should be kept covered. It cannot be too strongly urged upon 
a cook, the great advantage of gentle simmering over the usual 
fast boiling of meat, by which the outside is hardened and 
deprived of its juices before the inside is half done. 

Pickled or salted meat requires longer boiling than that 
which is fresh. A fish-plate, or some wooden skewers, should 
be put under a large joint to prevent its stacking to the bottom 
of the boiler. 

To broil, — A cinder-fire, or one partly made of coke and 
charcoal, clear of all appearance of smoke, is indispensable ; 
and chops, steaks, or cutlets of all kinds — if intended to be 
eaten in their plain state — should be dressed after every other 
dish is ready, and sent up to table kut, so as to secure their 



Chap. IH.] POOD AND COOKERY. 35 

being hot : thus it may be observed that in ^' steak-dinners '* 
the second course is always the best — as being dressed while 
the first is being eaten. The gridiron should be kept so clean 
as to be nearly polished, and should be always warmed before 
the meat is put upon it, as well as greased to prevent the steak 
from being burned. A fork should never be used in turning 
them, but a pair of steak-tongs. 

To fry. — The principle of this art is " to scorch something 
solid in oil or fiit." To do this it is necessary that the fat be 
in such condition as to scorch whatever is put into it ; for if 
the substance fried does not bum, it must soak and become 
greasy. After the substance is immersed in the fat the pan 
may be removed a little off the fire, as otherwise the outside 
will become black before the inside is done. 

When you wish fried things to look as well as possible, do 
them ttaice over with egg and crumbs. Bread that is not 
stale enough to grate quite fine will not look well. The fat you 
fry in must always be boiling-hot the moment the meat is put 
in, and kept so till finished ; a small quantity never fries well. 

Suet — When sirloins . of beef, or loins of veal or mutton, 
are brought in, part of the suet may be cut off for puddings, 
or to clarify. Chopped fine and mixed with flour, if tied down 
in a jar, it wUl keep 10 days or a fortnight. If there be more 
suet than will be used while fresh, throw it into pickle, made 
in the proportion of i lb. of salt to a quart of cold water, and 
it will be as good afterwards for any use, when soaked a little. 

If the weather permit, meat eats much better for hanging a 
day before it is salted. 

Boiling in a well-floured cloth will make meat white. 
Cloths for this purpose should be carefully washed, and boiled 
in clean water between each using, and not suffered to hang in 
a damp place, which would give a bad flavour to the meat. 
The same applies to tapes and pudding-cloths. All kitchen 
utensils should be kept in the nicest order, and in a conspi- 
cuous part of the ofi&ces. 

The more soups or broth are skimmed, the better and clearer 
they will be. In these, as well as in boiling meat, particular 
care must be taken that this is done the moment before it boils, 
otherwise the foulness will be dispersed over the meat. 

Vegetables should never be dressed with meat, except cat- 
rots or parsnips with boiled heef, 

d2 



36 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. HI. 

Old meats do not require so much dressing as young ; not 
that they are sooner done, but they can be eaten with the 
g^avy more in. 

Hashes and Minces should never boil, as their doing so 
makes the meat hard. The gravy should be thoroughly made 
before the meat is put in. 

Dripping y or clarijied suet, will baste everything as well as 
butter, except fowls and game ; and for kitchen pies nothing 
else should be used. 

Mutton-dripping cannot, however, be used in cookery, as 
it communicates to everything a taste of tallow. 

A piece of writing-paper should be twisted round the bone 
at the knuckle of a leg or shoulder of lamb, mutton, or veni- 
son, when roasted, before it is served. 

Seasoning. — The art of seasoning properly is a difficult aie, 
which can only be acquired by experience. The cook tastes 
her preparations inst^ of employing the scales ; and, where 
the quantities are indefinite, it is impossible to adjust the exact 
proportions of spice or other condiments which it will be neces- 
sary to add in order to give the proper flavour : the great art 
being so to blend the ingredients that one shall not predominate 
over the other. 

In the following, and indeed all other receipts, though the 
quantities of each ingredient may be as accurately directed as 
possible, yet much must be left to the discreti<Mi of the person 
who uses them. The different tastes of people require more 
or less of the flavour of spices, salt, garlic, butter, &c., which 
can never be ordered by general rules. A servant anxious to 
please will take all possible pains to ascertain the tastes of 
those she serves, and will be guided by that in the preparation 
of her dishes, though it may be opposed to her previous prac- 
tice. The proper articles should be at hand, and she must 
proportion them until the true zest be obtained, and a variety 
of flavour be giv^i to the different dishes. A very general 
error among English cooks is the too profuse use of salt and 
pepper, by which ragouts and soups are very frequently 
spoiled ; for although some portion of both must be put in at 
first, to counteract the rawness which would otherwise prevail, 
as most spices require to be submitted to the action of fire in 
order to bring out their true flavour, yet either can be easily 
added by those partakers of the dish who prefer more of one 



Chap, m.] FOOD AND COOKERY. 37 



or the other ; and perhaps the only dishes that should be highly 
seasoned are meat-pies and curries. As a general rule, it may 
be said that no mixture should be made without a small por- 
tion of salt ; thus, in the flour for pastry, a certain quantity, 
not exceeding a saltspoonful, will be necessary, and all sweet 
things require a little ; but the cook must be careful not to 
exceed the just limit. If sprinkled upon meat which is to be 
fried or broiled, it renders it hard. 

Cayenne is in general so unsparingly thrown into soups of 
almost every description, that persons of a delicate appetite 
can seldom eat them. Chili vinegar imparts both the heat of 
cayenne and the flavour of acid, and, if used with moderation, 
fornis a good condiment ; but no species of sauce, or artificial 
zest, should supers^e that of the meat. Nor should they, if 
liquid, be used until after the meat has been stewed : even 
wine, if put into soup, should not be added until nearly the 
last thing, when a wineglassful will go as £&t in flavouring as 
a pint if put in at the commencement : if the cook has not a 
nice palate, a cupful of the soup should be presented to her 
mistress to decide upon the necessary additional ingredients. 
But all condiments of a solid nature — such as whole peppers, 
ginger, mace, and cinnamon, or savoury herbs, truffles, and 
mushrooms — require the action of fire to draw out their 
flavour : the cook, therefore, should know from experience the 
quantity of each which may be necessary. She should never 
forget that the zest imparted to both soups and sauces mainly 
arises from a judicious mixture of the articles with which they 
are seasoned : a well-regulated palate in their choice, and a 
delicate hand in their distribution, are therefore essential in a 
good cook. 
The following maxims for cooks may be found useful : — 

1. Look clean ; be careful and nice in work, so that those 
who have to eat might look on. 

2. Never forget, while preparing a dish, that what you pro- 
duce has presently to be eaten, relished, or condemned, to your 
honour or to your discredit. 

3. Whatever can be tasted during the process of preparation 
must be flavoured by the judgment of the palate. Whatever 
may not be tasted before serving must be done strictly and 
invariably by rule. 

4. Though a rule has been long established, there is i\o 



38 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. HI. 

reason why improvement or advantageous change should not 
be made. The combinations and changes in cookery by 
means of the same materials are endless, therefore always think. 

5. Cooks must please the palate ; but it is necessary they 
should likewise suit the stomach ; want of skill ultimately 
brings upon them reproach instead of praise. 

6. A judicious use of salt will do wonders for the credit of 
a cook. The flavours which result from it cannot be traced to 
a cause ; the cook has therefore the whole of the credit — ^the 
condiment none. The same applies to the use of condiments and 
flavours in general ; whenever a particular taste predominates, 
the merit is attributed to the ingredient, and not to the cook. 

7. The cook who attends to the niceties of the art is a 
superior servant ; but if ignorant or neglectful, is worthless. 

There are three arts very essential in good cooking ; these 
are boning, larding, and braising. They are not difficult to 
acquire, so that there is little or no excuse for their neglect in 
the kitchens of private families ; but we may truly assert that 
not one cook in a himdred knows anything of boning, and very 
few of even the simple operation of larding ; if, therefore, the 
fiimily resides in town, the better way is always to have these 
matters performed by the poulterer ; for if a joint of meat — 
as, for instance, a shoulder of mutton — is to be boned, the 
butcher cannot do it so well. 

Boning, besides its other advantages, is particularly recom- 
mended, on account of its economy : the bones of turkeys, 
fowls, hares, &c., assisting to make gravy, while they are 
nearly useless when left in the bodies of the animals : a boned 
fowl also, rendered solid by stuffing, will go much further 
than when dressed in the common way. Hares should always 
be boned, for the sake of the improvement in their appearance, 
and being so much more easily carved. In the hiring of a 
cook by persons resident in the country, it is therefore essential 
to ascertain whether she is mistress of that art; for as to 
teaching her by printed directions, it would be time thrown 
away, and she can only acquire it by practice ; but it may be 
learned by a few lessons from the poulterer. 

Larding should be neatly done to be ornamental ; but the 
same effect, with respect to flavour, may be produced by 
raising the skin and laying a slice of fat bacon beneath it ; and

indeed, although it does not improve the appearance, yet if the 
flesh be dry — as that of a hare — it has a better effect upon the 
meat Laurding is not only commonly employed on poultry 
and game, but so frequently on many other dishes also that 
every cook ought to be acquainted with the mode of performing 
it It is done by cutting the firmest part of the bacon-fat into 
small strips, proportioned in length and thickness to the size of 
the article to be larded ; and these " lardoons," as they are 
called, are inserted, in rows, into punctures made in the 
sur&ce of the flesh, by a larding-pin, in one end of which the 
bacon is held. It is, in fact, very simple, requiring only prac- 
tice and perseverance to become an adept. 

To lard Meat, Fowls, Sweetbreads, Sfc. — Have ready lard-

according to the article to 
be done ; cut slices of bacon

with which pierce the skin and a very little of the meat, 
leaving the bacon in, and the two ends of equal length out- 
wards. Lard in rows the size you think fit. 

To braise, — Put the meat you would braise into a stewpan, 
and cover it with thick slices of fat bacon ; then lay round it 
six or eight onions, a faggot of sweet herbs, some celery, and, 
if to be brown, some thick slices of carrots, and trimmings of 
any fresh meat-bones you have, with a pint and a half of 
water, or the same quantity of stock 
(which you will find directed under the 
head of Soups and Gravies), according 
to what the meat is, and add seasoning. 
Cover the pan close, and set it over a 
slow stove ; it will require two or three 
hours, as its size and quality may direct. 
Then strain the gravy ; keep the meat 
quite hot ; take the fat off by plunging 
die basin into cold water, which will 
cause the fat to coagulate ; and boil it 
as quickly as you can till it thickens.

with a brush kept for the purpose 
^ do over the meat, and, if that 
has been larded, put it into the 
oven for a few minutes. This 
is called '^ glazing," and is much 
in use for made-dishes. The 
glaze should be a clear yellow 
brown. 



Many persons have been deterred from attempting this 
excellent method of cooking numerous articles on account of 
the expensive way usually prescribed. Should there be 
nothing else at hand, the meat or fowl to be braised may be 
put into a stewpan, with about an ounce of fresh butter, or 
a larger quantity according to the size, and a teacupful of 
water. Stir these together for a short time, and shake the 
pan occasionally imtil the juices of the meat or poultry afford 
sufRcient gravy ; put in an onion and a bunch of sweet herbs, 
with a little pepper or other seasoning, and a small quantity 
of salt. The meat must be turned several times during the 
period of braising the veal, as the English apparatus does not 
often admit of fire being placed on the top of the stewpan. 
When about to be brought to table, the gravy of braised meat 
should be cooled by placing the vessel containing it in cold 
water ; the fat removed ; the gravy then strained, thickened, 
heated, and sent up with forcemeat-balls, egg-balls, fried paste, 
or all three ; and mushrooms, or any other vegetables, cut into 
ornamental shapes : or the gravy may be boiled down to a glaze, 
and poured over the meat : send to table on a puree of vegetables. 

To glaze, withotU braising, — Fowls or meat may be dressed 

in any way chosen, without bacon, and 
a. gravy, boiled to a glaze, brushed 
over, as above. When several dishes 
are to be glazed, a sufficient quantity 
should be prepared, and the glazing- 
pot kept hot by putting it into hot 
water. Hams, tongues, and stewed 
beef, to eat cold, are thus done. 

To force Fowls, Sfc, is to stuff 
them with forcemeat, either between 
the skin and the flesh ; or, the breast-

up; or, the breast-bone being taken out, the body is filled.

Tongues, palates, &c., are said to be blanched, when, after 
long boiling, the skin can be peeled off; and the latter will 
become thicker by being put into cold water afterwards. 

To keep meat hot, it is best to take it up when done, though 
the company may not be come ; set the dish over a pan of 
boiling water, or in the bain-marie, as described in Chapter lY., 
on Culinary UtensOs ; else, put a deep tin cover over it so as 
not to touch the meat, and then throw a cloth over that. This 
way dries the gravy less than hot hearths of iron; but in 
whatever way 9ie heat be preserved, it is a very essential 
article in serving a dinner, and every requisite should be 
allowed for the purpose. The most effectual way is in a warm 
ckmi, which is now made so as to be heated by the steam 
from the boiler attached to most kitchen ranges.

acting springs, has been brought forward as an improvement, 
as it can act on two spits at the same time ; but they both 
have this objection — that confining the air has partly the effect

of baking the meat while it is roasting ; and thus, to the palate 
of a connoisseur, destroys much of that savoury flavour which 
the meat acquires when roasted in the common way ; but this 
remark applies only to beef and mutton, as it does not thus 
affect either white meat or poultry. The jack costs from 12j. 
to 15*., and the screens from 15*. to 25*. eath. 

Digesters. — Various afeam -kettles, known to cooks as " con- 
jurers," ought to be kept in every kitchen, and used at intervals 
when the fire is not otherwise engaged. Into one of these a 
digester is put, with a quantity of water just sufficient to cover 
the ingredients to be acted upon ; and into it are also to be put 
all the scraps of meat which are usually thrown away, together 
with the bones of all the meat daily dressed and consumed 
during the week — from the bones of a 1^ of mutton to that of 
a mutton-chop, and those of fowls, whether left upon a dish or 
a plate. 

Fastidious ladies will probably be shocked at the idea of 
again bringing such matters to table, but they should recollect 
that the bones are only scraped with a knife.

&rthiiig^ per pound ; but if they are cleaned, and trimmed, 
and steamed in the digester, the marrow and sinews of the 
bones produce in a few days a strong and wholesome soup.

families to whom expense b an object will do well to make

the flavour will be preserved, and the viands may be wanned 
up more than once without injury. The steam-apparatus now 
employed in most Idtehens is admirably adapted to tiiis purpose, 
smce the heat can be r^ulated to the required temperature. 




Steam Fireplace. 



A spacious moveable screen, large enough to completely 
cover the fire, lined throughout with tin, and having shelves 
for the warming of plates and dishes, should also be an ap- 
pendage ; and there should be an abundance of kitchen utensils 
of the best kind, kept in their proper places and strictly clean. 
Cleanliness is, indeed, of the flrst importance, and no kitchen- 
maid should ever put away a metal saucepan which has been 
used for any other purpose than merely boiling pure water, 
without scalding it thoroughly and then drying it. 

On the Continent many of the most useful kitchen utensils 
are made of glazed croekery-ware— such as pipkins for melting 
butter, boiling milk, and makii^ sauces ; as well as deep belly- 
formed Jars and pans of different sizes for the stewing of meat 
and making of soups, as being more easily kept sweet than those 
of tin or copper ; and, if the same system were more followed in 
this coimtry, it would secure the delicacy of many dishes 
which are spoiled by being cooked in vessels which have im- 
bibed a sour or musty flavour.' However, if copper utensils

be used in the kitchen, the cook should be charged to be very 
careful not to let the tin be rubbed off, and to have them fresh 
tinned when the least defect appears,* as well as never to put 
by any soup, gravy, or sauce in them, or any metal utensil ; 
stone and earthen vessels should be provided for those purposes. 
Independently of these articles, every kitchen should be 
providcKl with a clock to keep the cook to her time ; also with 
a large and a small marble mortar for the pounding of meat, 
with chopper, meat-saw, various-sized scoops for vegetables, 
when required for haricos, &c., paste-cutters, steak-tongs, 
&c., and those insignificant, though useful little articles, minute- 
glasses, to r^ulate the boiling of an egg ; nor should a spice- 
box, containing whole pepper, mace, nutmegs, and cinnamon, 
be forgotten ; together with various dried sweet herbs. As 
accuracy in apportioning the ingredients to be used is indis- 
le to the success of

cookery, scales, with weights 
from ^oz. to 2 lbs., should 
be placed on the dresser, 
and the weights carefully 
kept in regular order. A 
set of tin measures with small 
spouts or lips, and with the 
contents distinctly marked 
upon them, from a gallon 
down to half a gill, will also 

be found very convenient. It is likewise well to have a set 
of wooden measures, from a bushel to a quarter of a peck. 
Let it be remembered, that, of liquid measure —

Two pints are one quart. 
Four quarts are one gallon.

Four tablespaonfiils, or half a gill, will fill a common wine-glass. 

Four wine-glasses will fill a half-pint or common tumbler, or a laige 

coffee-cup. 
A quart black bottle holds in reality about a pint and a half. 
Of flour, butter, sugar, and most articles used in cakes and pastry, a 

quart is generally about equal in quantity to a pound avoirdupois 

(sixteen ounces). Avoirdupois is the weight designated throughout 

this book. 
Ten eggs generally weigh one pound before they are broken. 
A tablespoonful of salt or brown sugar is generally about one ounce. 

Sieves, of various descriptions, are very essential. Every 
utensil for cookery should be of various sizes, so as to suit the 
quantity of which the dishes may be composed; and each 
should be kept in a fixed place, as well as washed and dried 
immediately after usii^. The cook should also be charged to 
take care of jelly-bags, tapes for the collared things, &c., 
which, if not perfectly scalded and kept dry, give an un- 
pleasant flavour when next used.

CHAPTER V. 

FOREIGN TERMS USED IN COOKING. 

Feench cookery is of so diverse a nature that many volumes 
have already been written upon the subject ; and new modes of 
dressing the same things are so constantly being invented, that 
we must content ourselves with merely giving a few explana- 
tioDs of the terms adopted by most of our professed cooks. 

Bain-Marie. — ^A vessel with a loose bottom to contain hot 
water, in which sauces may be kept hot to nearly the boiling- 
point without their burning or being reduced. 

Bard, — A slice of thin bacon fat, used for covering the 
breasts of birds, the back of a hare, or any substance that re- 
quires the assistance of fat where larding is not preferred. 

Beignet, or Fritter, — Anything that is enveloped in a 
casing of batter or e^^, and fried. Thus we have fritters of 
fruit, vegetables, cream, &c. 

Blanc, — A white broth used to improve the colour of 
chickens, lamb, &c. 

Blanch, — To set anything on the fire in cold water, and 
when it boils strain it off and plunge it into cold water. 

Blanquettes, — A kind of fricassee, made of slices of white 
meat cut thin, and warmed in white sauce thickened with the 
yolk of eggs. 

Bouilli, — ^Beef very much boiled and served with sauce. 

Bouillon, — The common soup of France. 

Braise, — A mode of stewing veal, &c,, in a closely-covered 
stewpan, so as to prevent evaporation, whilst the meat retains 
not only its own juices but those of other articles which may 
be put with it, such as bacon, herbs, roots, and spice. 

Callipash. — The glutinous meat of the upper shell of a turtle. 

Callipee. — The glutinous meat of the imder shell of a turtle. 

Caramel. — Sugar hoUed down until the water is evaporated) 



50 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. V. 

and then formed in ornamental devices for decorating g&teaux- 
baskets, &c. It is also used for colouring gravies when re- 
duced almost to the burning-point, and then dissolved in water. 
Its use is not much to the credit of the cook. 

Casserole. — A rice-crust moulded in the form of a pie ; when 
baked, filled with a mince or puree of game, or with a hkaur 
gtiette of white meat. Also a stewpan. 

Compote, — Stewed fruits served with syrup. There are 
also compotes of pigeons and other small birds. 

Consomme is a strong clear gravy, drawn from the long 
stewing of any kind of meat, to be either used as broth, or made 
into soups and sauces. 

Coulisy or culHs, is a rich brown gravy commonly used for 
the purpose of colouring as well as thickening and flavouring 
many sorts of soups and sauces. It is made in various ways, 
chiefly upon a foundation of ham and veal, slices of which are 
put into a closely covered stewpan, with only a small quantity 
of water, and boiled over a brisk fire until the whole becomes 
brown and thick. See Sauces. 

Croquettes. — A mince of either fish, meat, or poultry, made 
very savoury, with a small quantity of sauce, formed into shapes 
of any kind, rolled in egg and bread-crumbs, and fried crisp. 

Croustades, or Dresden patties, made of paste in small 
moulds, and filled with mince of any kind. 

Crouton. — ^A sippet of bread fried and used for garnish. 

" JSn papilloteJ^ — To oil or butter a piece of paper, which 
is fastened round the cutlet, &c., by twisting it along the edge. 

Entree. — ^A comer dish for the first course. In large din- 
ners the side dishes are called^a;^?*. 

Entremet. — A side or comer dish for the second course. 

Farce. — ^Forcemeat. 

Faggot. — A small bunch of parsley and thyme and a bay- 
leaf tied up. 

Fricandeaux may be made of any boned piece of veal, in 
pieces of not more than 2 or 3 lbs. weight, chiefly cut from that- 
portion of the fillet which we have described as the thick part. 
It is a frequent dish as an entree at good tables, and requires 
great (^re to serve in perfection. 



Chap. V.] FOREIGN TERMS USED IN COOKING. 



51 



GcUeau, — ^A cake or pudding. 

GUice or Glctze. — Stock boiled down to a consistency, and 
used to improve the appearance of all braised dishes ; it should

Lardoon. — ^The piece of bacon used in larding. 

Liaison. — ^A mixture of cream and egg to thicken white 
soaps, &c. 

Maigre. — ^Made without meat. 

Marinade, — A liquor prepared for boiling or stewing fish or 
meat in : it is sometimes used cold. 

Meringue. — ^A very light preparation of pastry, made of 
sugar and whites of eggs beaten to snow. 

Matelote. — ^A rich stew of fish with wine. 

Miroton consists of small slices of meat cut thin, and not 
larger than a crown-piece, and made into various sorts of 
ragouts ; and dished up in a circular form. 

PoeUe is employed in fine French codtery to boil fowls in, 
or other delicate preparations. 

The Pot-aU'feu is truly the foundation of all good cookery, 
and of that we shall treat rather largely in our chapters on 
soups and sauces, which contain several foreign receipts ; while 
in what we have said on cookery there may be found a brief 
notice on braising, larding, and boning, together with nume- 
rous practical hints throughout the work, to render any intelli- 
gent woman a perfect cook and housekeeper. 

Puree. — A culinary operation which should be carefully

attended to, and which, although known in this e oun lry for 
preparing potted meats and fish, is seklom employed by com- 
mon English cooks in anything but pea-sonp. It consists in 
either pounding the meat or &h in a mortar until it becomes 
a paste, or in stewing roots or pulse in boiling water until 
they are softened into a thick pulp, when they are passed, 
first through a colander, or through a puree presser, and 
afterwards through a wire or hair sieve, or " tammy,** and, 
being thinned widi broth, may be formed into soups of various 
sorts. 

Quenelles and Godiveaux are different sorts of forcemeat, 
composed of meat or fish, with bread and yolk of e^y and &t 
of some kind ; seasoned in various ways, and either spread 
upon rolled meat, or formed into balls and firied as garnish 
to entries, or ser\'ed separately as entrees. 

To form Quenelles. — ^When the forcemeat is made, take 2 
tablespoons, fill 1 with the meat, dip a knife in hot water, with 
which smooth it over ; then dip the other spoon into boiling 
water, and with it remove the meat firom the first spoon, and slip 
it into a buttered stewpan ; so on until you have the number 
you want ; then cover them with stock, and boO them about 
10 minutes, or until firm, and they are fit for use. For small 
quenelles use teaspoons. 

Rissole. — A mince of meat or fish, enclosed in paste, 
or made up into shapes or balls in the manner of minced 
collops, and used either as side-dishes, or as a garnish for 
stews or hashes, now more el^antly termed fricassees and 
Tag&(Us, 

JRoux, — A thickening for white soups or gravy, made of 
flour and butter. 

Salmis, — A hash made of game, which is cut up when 
only half roasted; whereas a hash is made from dressed 
game. 

Sauti. — ^Fried, and in some instances used di&fryingpan. 

TamiSy or " tammy," a strainer of thin woollen canvas, used 
for straining soups and sauces, sold at all the Italian ware- 
houses. 

Tourte, — ^A kind of tart baked in a shallow tin.

cold fowl, and a little spice, have formed the chief part, with- 
out the more expensive articles. 

Vol-au'ventisyerj light puff paste, cut either oval or round, 
and the interior cleared out, enclosing any delicate mince of 
sweetbread, game, or poultry ; it is frequently served at good 
tables.

It may be more matter of curiosity than of practical utility to 
cookery to show the modes of cutting up the joints of butcher's- 
meat, as that is always done at the shambles or in the buteher^s 
shop ; but the appearance of the animal, as marked with the 
corresponding figures, will explain where each joint is to be 
found. There is, besides, a different method of cutting fol- 
lowed in Scotland and in England, which occasions the number, 
size, and name of the several joints to vary in the carcase.

Pork, although from its common use among the lower 
classes of society regarded as a homely viand, is yet held in 
%h estimation by many families of great respectability, who, 
living in the country, rear pigs for their own consumption ; 
and we know that " home-fed pork," bred on Prince Albert's 
hrm at Windsor, frequently forms a dish, in the winter season, 
at the royal table. 

The usual mode of cutting up the pig is thus :

MARKETING. 

Although respectable butchers may, in most cases, be relied 
upon for the goodness of the meat which they sell to regular 
customers, yet many persons (both ladies and gentlemen) go 
to market and choose for themselves, when, if not competent 
judges, the inferior sorts generally fall to their lot. In country 
towns, also, there are frequently but one or two market-days in 
the week ; and the meat being brought from a distance, it is an 
essential point of good housekeeping to be so well acquainted 
with the quality as not to be easily imposed upon. 

Formerly both sheep and oxen were reared to a mature age ; 
hut grazieTs have since learned to bring them so early to 



Chap. VI.] MARKETING. 59 

market, by means of artificial fatting, instead of the more 
natural mode of grass-feeding, that they are now killed at such 
early periods as to deprive the meat of much of its flavour. 
This is more especially the case with regard to mutton, which, 
when in perfection, ought not to be seen at table until the 
sheep are from 3 to 5 years old, whereas now they are gene- 
rally killed at less than half that age ; and not unfrequently 
at 20 months old ! — ^the consequence of which is, that they are 
neither lamb nor mutton. 

There is also great difference in the quality of the flesh of 
large and small animals of both kinds, of which the smaller 
will generally be found to be the best, as being reared upon 
short mountain pasture ; while the Leicesters and other large 
breeds, which are fed upon rich land, become at an early age 
covered with fat. The beef of a small Highland ox, also, always 
fetches the highest price in Smithfield. 

Ox-beef should have a fine smooth open grain, be of a good 
red, and feel tender. The fat should look white rather than 
yellow, for, when that is of a deep colour, the meat is seldom 
good : beef fed on oil-cake is generally so, and the flesh is 
flabby. The best is that which is rather more than moderately 
fet, as being a proof that the animal was well fed ; but never 
buy lean beef, as it will always prove tough, and so inferior as 
to be dear at any price. The grain of cow-beef is closer, and 
the fkt whiter, than that of ox-beef ;' but the lean is not of so 
bright a red. The grain of bull-beef is coarser and closer still, 
the fat hard and skinny, the lean of a deep red, and it has a 
stronger scent. Ox-beef is the richest and largest ; but in small 
families, and to some tastes, heifer-beef is preferred, if finely 
fed. In old meat, a streak of horn runs between the fat and 
lean of the sirloin and ribs ; the harder this is, the older, and 
the flesh is not finely flavoured ; that is to say, the horn has 
become so firm as to appear like bone : but oxen are always 
the better if kept until 5 or 6 years old. 

Ox-tortgue» — To choose a neat's tongue, it should be of a 
moderate size, plump, firm, and smooth to the touch ; for if 
the skin appears rough and shrivelled, it will be found hard 
and flavourless. 

Veal, — A great point to be observed in choosing veal is the 
size of the catf and the colour of the meat. It should be small, 
white, and the kidney well covered with fat. The ftesYi oi a 



60 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VI. 

bull-calf is firmest and most juicy, but not so white. The fillet 
of the cow-calf is generally preferred for the udder. If the 
bloody vein in the shoulder looks blue, or of a bright red, it is 
newly killed ; but any other colour shows it to be stale. The 
other parts should be dry and white ; if clammy or spotted, 
the meat is stale and bad. The kidney turns first, and the suet 
will not then be firm. K allowed to live longer than eight or 
ten weeks old, the flesh becomes coarse. You will of course 
get it somewhat cheaper, and it may, to some palates, be found 
equally good in flavour, but not so delicate in either the colour 
or the texture of the flesh. 

Mutton, — ^Wether mutton is the only sort for a connoisseur^s 
table, and may be known by a knob of fat on the upper part 
of the leg, where, in ewe mutton, is the udder. The meat 
should be of a dark colour, and well covered with fat ; and in 
the loin the lean should appear mottled. The flesh of the ewe 
is paler, and the texture finer, but neither the meat nor gravy 
so well flavoured as that of the wether, though a ^^ maiden 
ewe,*' when it can be got, is considered particularly fine. If 
you wish to have a good haunch, choose one of smsdl size and 
moderately fat, looking at the same time to the closeness of 
the grain and the whiteness of the fat ; but more particularly 
see that the flesh is dark-coloured, that being a proof of age, 
and the older the better. In boiled mutton this is not of so 
much importance as in roasted. 

Lamb. — There are two sorts : " house-lamb," which is reared 
under cover upon ewe's milk, and comes into season, as a great 
delicacy, at Christmas ; and " grass-lamb " at Easter, conti- 
nuing in season during the whole of the summer, but losing 
much of its nicety of flavour after it reaches 4 months old. It 
ought therefore to be small and white in appearance, and well 
covered with fat: the younger the more delicate. In the 
Peninsula it is frequently killed at 6 weeks old, then roasted 
whole, and is extremely delicate. 

P&rk, — ^The rind should be thin, the fat very firm, and the 
lean white : the principal point to be observed is the firmness of 
the fat. If the rind is tough, thick, and cannot easily be im- 
pressed by the finger, it is old. Pigs that are short in the • 
legs and bodies, and have thick necks, and not long heads and 
earS) are always to be preferred. When fresh, the flesh will 
be smooth and dry ; if clammy, it is tainted. What is called 



Chap. YI.] MARKETING. 61 

" measly pork " is very unwholesome, and may be known by 
the £it being full of kernels. Pork fed at still-houses does not 
answer for curing in any way, the fat being spongy. Dairy- 
pork is the best. 

Porkers from 3 to 4 months old are the most delicate, and 
6 months is the latest age at which they should be killed as 



Bacon, — If the rind be thin, the fat firm and of a reddish 
tinge, the lean tender, of a good colour, and adhering to the 
bone, you may conclude it is good and not old. If there are 
yellow streaks in it, it is rusty. 

For hams, stick a sharp knife imder the bone, and also up 
to the knuckle. If it comes out with a pleasant smeU, the 
ham is good ; but do not buy it if the knife has a bad scent. 
Hams short in the hock are best ; nor should long-legged pigs 
be chosen for any purpose. 

Brawn. — The homy part of the young brawn will feel 
moderately tender, and the flavour will be better than the old, 
the rind of which will be hard. 

Venison. — The &t should be clear, bright, and thick ; and if 
the cleft of the haunch be smooth and close, it is young ; but if 
the cleft is close and tough, it is old. To judge of its sweetness, 
nm a very sharp narrow knife into the shoulder or haunch, and 
you will know by the scent. Few people like it when it has 
much of the haut-gout ; but it bears keeping better than any sort 
of meat, and if eaten fresh killed it is not so good as mutton. 
Observe the neck of a fore-quarter : if the vein be bluish, it is 
fresh ; if it have a green or yellow cast, it is stale. In the 
hind-quarter, if there is a faint smell under the kidney, and 
the knuckle is limp, the meat is stale. If the eyes be sunk, 
the head is not fresh. When you can learn where it has been 
reared, choose forest-venison, as that is the best ; for some of 
the dealers stall-feed the deer, and fatten them with oil-cake. 
It should be full 5 years old. The btick comes into season in 
May, and the meat continues in prime order until September, 
when doe-venison is brought into use, and continues to Christ- 
mas. 

In every sort of provisions the best of the kind goes furthest, 
cuts up to greatest advantage, and affords most nourishment. 
Bound of beef, fiUet of veal, and leg of mutton, are joints 
that bear a higher price ; but as thej have more solid meat.

— 'll ■ III I I ■■■■!■ I 

they deserve the preference. It is worth notice, however, that 
those joints which are inferior may be dressed as palatably, 
and, being cheaper, they ought to be bought in turn. 

In loins of meat, the long pipe that runs by the bone should 
be taken out, as it is apt to taint ; as also the kernels of beef. 
Bumps and aitchbones of beef are often bruised by the blows 
the drovers give the beasts, and the part that has been struck 
always taints : therefore do not purchase these joints if bruised. 

All meat should be carefully examined, and wiped with a 
dry cloth as soon as it comes in ; and if flies have blown upon 
it, the part must be cut off. This should be daily observed 
until it is dressed, as it not only tends to preserve the meat 
long in perfection, but prevents that musty flavour too often 
perceived in the outer slice when brought to table. 

In the country, where meat is often carried a great distance, 
it should be well covered up with a cloth, over which fresh 
cabbage-leaves would keep it cool. These cautions are more 
needful, as in some families great loss is sustained by the 
spoiling of meat. The fly may in some measure be prevented 
by dusting, upon the parts most likely to be attack^, pepper 
and ginger mixed, after wiping, which should never be 
omitted; but a more easy and effectual mode is to exclude 
the fly by using a wire meat-safe, or to cover the joints with 
a long loose gauze or thin cloth, and hang them up from the 
ceiling of an airy chamber. 

In summer meat should be wiped every day, or sprinkled with 
pepper to keep off* the flies ; and should it wear any appear- 
ance of becoming tainted, it should be brushed over with 
pyroligneous acid ; or even if already slightly infected, either 
the acid or roughly-pounded charcoal, if well rubbed -into 
the meat, will restore it. The meat should also be brought 
in early in the morning, as, if much exposed to the sun, the 
heat will render it flabby. In frosty weather, meat is some- 
times in a congealed state, and should be thawed by soaking 
it in cold water before putting it to the fire. 

Meats become more tender, and consequently more digest- 
ible, as well as better flavoured, by hanging ; but veal and 
lamb will not bear it so long as the flesh of older animals^ 
In summer, 2 days is enough for lamb and veal, and from 3 to 
4 for beef and mutton ; in cold weather, these latter may be 
kept for more than double that time without risk of being 
.tainted. 



Chap. VI.] MARKETING. 63 

To know if a hare be young, see if the nut of the first joint 
of the fore-paw is tender; or turn the claws sideways, and if 
they crack the hare is young. If the ears are tender and 
pliable, and if the claws are smooth and sharp, the same con- 
dttsion may be drawn. 

In every sort of fish, stifihess, redness of the gills, and 
brightness of the eyes, are invariable signs of freshness : thick- 
ness of the flesh generally marks the good condition of all fish, 
and its fimyiess is an essential requisite. Fish, when quite 
fresh, curl round, but are particularly elastic, rising immedi- 
ately upon the pressure of the fingers ; and their staleness or 
freshness may be measured by the possibility of making an im- 
pression. ^^ If stale, the impression will remain ; but, if fresh, 
it will rise again on removal of the pressure." 

Generally speaking, the largest are not always the best, but 
neither should the smaller sorts be chosen, particularly in cod 
and haddock, which, when overlarge, are frequently woolly, 
while small salmon, or salmon peel, are always wanting in 
richness ; but a moderately-sized turbot, if it be firm, often 
tastes better than some of the very largest. 

Turbot should be thick, and the belly of a yellowish white : 
if of a bluish cast, or thin, they are bad ; the best proof of con- 
dition being in the fimmess as well as thickness of the fish, and 
a light cream-colour on the pale side. The best fish average 
from 12 to 20 lbs., though those of less than half that weight 
have a very fine flavour. A fish one day old will dress much 
better than a live one. Brill very much resembles turbot, but 
is narrower and thinner : it requires scaling on both sides, and 
is without those thorny spines which are found on the dark 
side of the turbot. It should be dressed as soon as possible 
after it is caught. 

Soles would appear to be in season all the year round, as 

they are always in the market in greater plenty than any of 

our flat-fish, but are in the highest perfection about midsummer. 

If good, they should be thick, firm to the touch, and the belly 

of a cream-colour ; but if this be of a bluish cast, and the body 

flabby, or the eyes sunken, they are not fresh ; and when 

brought to table, if the spinal bone be in the least degree 

tinged with red, it is a sure sign that the fish is stale. They 

are of all sizes, from a few ounces to a couple of pounds 

weight; but if much larger, they will be coarse, while tbfe 

very small kinds are all skin and bone. 



64 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VI, 

To choose a Codfish. — Select a short fish. The gills should 
be very red, and the eyes full and glossy ; for if dull and pale, 
it is a sure sign of the fish being stale. It should be round 
and thick at the neck, from which the body swells and carries 
its fulness nearly down to the tail. It should be perfectly stiff, 
and elastic to the touch ; for if, when pressed by the finger, the 
mark of the indentation remains, it will eat less firm and fiaky, 
and should therefore be rejected. The colour of the liver 
should be of an opaque white cast, and the whiter the liver the 
better the fish : when out of season, the liver becomes red. It 
is improved by being crimped, as this increases its firmness, 
and then it requires keeping one day before using. 

' Mackerel, — The eye should be full, and the stripes on the 
back distinctly black : those on the male are straight, those on 
the female are wavy. The male fish is the best. The body 
should be full from the shoulders. 

Salmon, — If fresh and in season, the flesh is of a fine red, 
the scales silvery, very firm in the belly, and the whole fisb 
stiff.

CHAPTER VII. 



SOUPS. 



GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 

In England many families deprive themselves of the use of 
soup, arising from fear of its expense. Many of the following 
receipts will, however, be found very economical ; and all of 
them an elegant and healthful appendage to a good dinner. 
Soups, indeed, add greatly to the comfort of a family, and it 
would be well if every housewife who studies economy would 
pay attention to those simple modes of preparing them which 
may be foimd in the present chapter. 

Roman Catholic families^ who, on fast-days, require maigre 
soups and dishes, will find abundance of receipts in this little 
work ; but where they are not strictly so, by suet or bacon 
being directed to be used in stuffings, the cook must use butter 
instead ; and where meat gravies (or stock, as they are called) 
are ordered, those made of fish must be adopted, though butter, 
arrow-root, or flour mixed up with a finely minced or pounded 
anchovy and made into a paste, will make an excellent sub- 
stitute. 

Although the English taste is in favour of strong, rich, and 
highly-flavoured soups, yet those may be varied by others of 
a plainer description — broths, rather than soups, containing 
only the pure juices of the meat, seasoned with vegetables ; 
and, thickened with bread, rice, or vermicelli, will be found 
both palatable and wholesome. Housekeepers will do well to 
attend very closely to this branch of the culinary art, as the 
stock, or broth, may frequently be produced without the pur- 
chase of meat to be employed solely for the purpose. Thus 
the water in which a neck or a leg of mutton has been boiled, 
or the liquor from a calf s head, will, with the addition of a 
little seasoning, form a good stock for a vegetable or thick 
soup; particularly if the bones be added when the meat \s 
brought from tahle^ they will produce a stiff jelly, and make 

If 



66 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VIL 

quite sufficient soup for a small family ; or, if not rich enough, 
it can be easily thickened. 

Arrow-root, or the mere farina or flour of the potato, is fer 
better for the thickening of soups than wheaten flour. 

The trimmings of large joints of butcher's meat, the shanks 
of legs and shoulders of mutton, the remains of all sorts of 
poultry and game, the bones of roast meat, or, if boiled, then 
broken and broiled, should all be stewed down to a jelly — 
nor should the bones and remains of fish, for the same purpose, 
be neglected — and when strained and well seasoned, kept as 
stock for the foundation of soups, which may thus be prepared 
on sudden occasions in a much shorter time than if made from 
raw meat. 

In Scotland, sheep's heads and trotters are much used in 
soup ; and English private families would do well to make 
more use of them, as they afford very strong jelly, and the 
proper flavour may be given by the judicious addition of beef, 
game, ham, and anchovy. A clear jelly of cowheels is like- 
wise very useful to keep in the house, being a great improve- 
ment to soups and gravies, as well as particularly nourishing 
for weakly persons. 

Soft water should always be used for making soup, unless 
it be of green peas, in which case hard water better preserves 
its colour ; and it is a good general rule to apportion a quart 
of water to a pound of meat, that is to ssLy, jftesk without bone ; 
but rich soups may have a smaller quantity of water. 

Meat for soup should never be drowned at first in water, 
but put into the kettle with a very small quantity and a piece 
of butter, merely to keep the meat from burning imtil the 
juices are extracted ; by which means of stewing the gravy 
will be drawn from it before the remainder of the water is 
added. A single pound will thus afford better and richer soup 
than treble the quantity saturated with cold water ; but it wiU 
take 6 or 8 hours to extract the essence from a few pounds of 
raw beef. Bouilli beef is rendered very rich and palatable, 
though a considerable quantity of soup may be made from it, 
by being stewed at first in a little butter and some of its own 
gravy. 

Soup, if meant to be good, should be made of meat that has 
not been previously cooked ; for although family soup of fair 
quality may be made in the manner above stated, yet, if cold 
jmeat be used, it will ever be found to have a vapid taste which 



Chap. VH.] SOUPS— GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 67 

seasoning cannot disguise, nor impose upon the palate of any 
person who is accustomed to broths made from raw meat : but 
we admit, that if only partially employed, the remains of roast 
beef, or the bones broiled, and a shank of ham, will commonly 
improve the flavour of soups made in the usual manner. The 
se&nents of gravies that have stood to be cold should likewise 
be avoided, as they occasion the soup to become cloudy. Raw 
vegetables, with the exception of onions, should not be put 
down to stew at the same time as the meat, as their flavour 
will be exhausted by too long boiling, and the different sorts 
should be put dowfi at different times. Onions, either whole 
or sliced and fried, at once ; pot-herbs, carrots, and celery 3 
hours afterwards ; and turnips, vegetable marrow, asparagus- 
tops, and those of any delicate kind, only shortly before the 
80up is ready. 

A common camp-kettle will be found an excellent utensil 
for making soup, as the lid is heavy 
and will keep in the steam. An earthen 
pipkin or jar of this form, if of a long 
and narrow make, widening a little in 
the centre, is perhaps one of the best 
vessels for soups, and universally used 
by foreign cooks, who insist " that it 
renders the gravy more clear and 
limpid, and extracts more savour from 
the meat, than when made in tin or 
copper." 

It is generally thought desirable to prepare soup the day 
before it is wanted, as the fat can be more easily taken off^ 
when cold than hot, and every particle of it should be skimmed 
from the surface, or it will render the broth unpalatable- 
When put away to cool it should be poured into a freshly 
scalded, and thoroughly dried, earthen pan — which is prefer- 
able to any metal — ^and, when to be kept for some days, occa- 
sionally simmered for a few minutes over the fire, to prevent 
its becoming " mothery," or mouldy. 

A common mistake in the making of soup is that of allowing 
it to boil too fast, and for too short a time ; for long and slow 
boiling is necessary to extract the strength from the meat, 
which, if boiled fast over a large fire, becomes hard, and will 
not give out its juices. 

If colouririp he wanted, a few slices of meat laid at \kei

bottom of a stewpan with 2 or 3 oz. of butter, and left on 
the stove until the gravy is entirely drawn out, and nearly 
dried up again, will have the eflPect of browning ; or even 
a piece of bread toasted as brown as possible — but not 
blackened — ^and put into the soup to simmer for a short time 
before its going to be served, will generally be found suffi- 
cient : if not, an ounce or two of moist sugar — ^the coarser the 
better — put into a small saucepan, with a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut, melt them together ; add a glass of ketchup, 
and stir it well. A very small quantity may be made in an 
iron spoon. Burnt onions wiU materially assist in giving a 
fine brown colour to soup, and also improve the flavour with- 
out either butter or ketchup ;■ or, if meant to be kept for 
future use — 

Put 4 oz. of lump sugar, a gill of water, and i oz. of the 
finest butter, into a small tosser, and set it over a gentle fire. 
Stir it with a wooden spoon, till of a bright brown. Then add 
i pint of water ; boil, skim, and when cold bottle and cork it 
close. Add to soup or gravy as much of this as will give a 
proper colour. 

The colour of white soups may likewise be improved by 
the use of white roux, which, in France, is universally added 
to white soups and sauces, as it is more delicate than butter 
and flour mixed in the common way. 

To Clarify Soup. — Put the whites of 1 or 2 eggs into it 
while being warmed up, and as it begins to melt : then boil 
the whole gently together, and nm the liquor through a jelly- 
bag. Or break the white of an q^^ into a basin along with 
the broken shell, carefully avoiding the smallest particle of 
the yolk ; beat the white to a stiff froth, and mix it gradually 
but thoroughly with the soup, which should be set over the fire 
and stirred till it boils up : then take it off, cover it close, and 
let it stand for J of an hour, then strain it through a napkin. 
The process of clarifying destroys somewhat of the savour of 
the soup, which ought, therefore, to be more highly seasoned. 

It is also very usual to put force-meat balls, of various 
sorts, into many different soups, for the purpose of improving 
their flavour and appearance. Some of these are called ^^ Pass- 
over balls j^ as being much in use among the Jews, who are 

» Thef are prepared in France, and are to be purchased at all the Italian 
ifarelioases in London, 



Chap. VH.] SOUPS—GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 69 

known to be excellent cooks, and they are equally applicable 
to any kind of soups — ^whether meat, fish, or vegetable— -and 
excellent in quality. See Force-meat. 

Ketchups and sauces^ such as soy, anchovy, &c., should 
dther only be put into weak soups which require to have some 
flavour imparted to them, or used with great delicacy. There 
is, however, an agreeable acidity as well as a delicacy of 
savour in Harvey's, the Brighton, Reading, Lopresti's, and 
other lately invented sauces, and more particularly that just 
brought forward as Wardpoy's, which has a singular, delicate, 
though very pungent, flavour. Soups also — ^like that made 
from calTs-head, cow-heel, and ox-tail — ^which are rich, but 
flavourless, will bear the addition of sauces when other relish- 
ing articles are not at hand ; but, generally speaking, common 
English cooks are too much addicted to the indiscriminate use 
of ketchups and pickles. 

A hunch of Herhs^ when spoken of for soups, gravies, 
&c., consists of parsley, thyme, and green onions ; when 
called Seasoning, it is these with about 3 bay-leaves, 6 cloves, 
a blade or two of mace, common pepper, and salt. 

There is sometimes a great prejudice against the use of par- 
ticular sorts of seasoning and spices. Garlic is amongst 
these ; and many a dish is deprived of its finest flavour for 
want of a moderate use of it. The pungency might easily be 
reduced by boiling it repeatedly in diflferent waters. 

The use of tomatas, which are only rarely employed in 
England, would also be found a great improvement in many 
kinds of soup ; and the seeds of celery may be used to give 
)ur when the root is out of season. 



SUMMARY OP THE FOREGOING DIRECTIONS RESPECTING 

SOUPS AND GRAVIES. 

Freshly killed meat is the best for soup ; and the leaner the 
better. 

When there is any fear of gravy-meat being spoiled before 
it is wanted, season well, and fry it lightly, which will preserve 
it 2 days longer ; but the gravy is best when the juices are fresh. 

When soups or gravies are to be kept, they must be boiled 
up and put into fresh-scalded dry pans. Do not use the sedi- 
ments of gravies that have stood to be cold, nor any drippings 
but those of beef. Whatever has veg-etables boiled in it is apt 
to turn sour sooner timn the juices of meat. 



70 



MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VH. 



If soups or gravies are too weak, do not cover them in boil- 
ing, that the watery particles may evaporate ; but if strong, 
cover the stewpan close. If they want flavour, the gravy 
from spiced and hunter's beef, or most of the prepared sauces, 
will give it to meat-soups ; and herring-brine, or anchovy, 
with walnut ketchup and soy, will add to those of fish ; but 
must be used cautiously. 

When fat remains on any soup, a teacupfiil of flour and 
water mixed quite smooth, and boiled in it, will make it rise 
as scum, when it may be taken ofl*. 

If richness or greater consistency be wanted, a good lump 
of butter mixed with flour, and boiled in the soup, will give 
either of these qualities. 

Long boiling is necessary to give the full flavour of the 
ingredients, therefore time should be allowed for soups and 
gravies. Skim frequently and simmer slowly ; but do not let 
the broth cool until it is completely made. 

Be sparing in the use of pepper, salt, and spices. 

If onions are too strong, boil a turnip with them, and it will 
render them mild. 

Do not keep either soups or gravies in any vessel of tin or 
copper; and in stirring soup, do it always with a wooden 
spoon. 



MEAT-SOUPS. 

The basis of all well-made soups is composed of what our 

English cooks call " Stock,^* 
or broth, made from all sorts 
of meat, bones, and the re- 
mains of poultry or game ; all 
of which may be put together 
and stewed down in the 
" Stock-pot ;" the contents of 
which are, by the French, 
termed Consomme. 

This is chiefly used for the 
preparation of brown or gravy 
soups : that intended for white 
soups being rather differently 
compounded, though made in 
nearly the same manner. 




A Stock-pot.

CHAP.Vn.] MEAT-SOUPS. 71 

The following are the most usual modes of making it ; the 
more succulent the meat, the better being the stock. Boiling 
water should be used when the meat is fried, but otherwise 
cold water is best. 

Brown Stock, — Put 10 lbs. of shin of beef, 6 lbs. of 
knuckle of veal, and some sheep's-trotters or a cow-heel, in a 
closely covered stewpan, to draw out the gravy very gently, 
and allow it nearly to dry in imtil it becomes brown. Then 
pour in sufficient boiling water to entirely cover the meat, and 
let it boil up, skimming it frequently ; seasoning it with whole 
peppers and salt, roots, herbs, and vegetables of any kind. 
That being done, let it boil gently 5 or 6 hours, pour the 
broth from off the meat, and let it stand during the night to 
cool. The following morning take off the scum and fat, and 
put it away in a stone jar for fiirther use. 

Or : — Put into a stewpan a piece of beef, a piece of veal, an 
old fowl, some slices of ham or bacon, and all the trimmings of 
meat that can be obtained ; add to these materials, where such 
thmgs are abundant, partridge, grouse, or other game, which 
may not be sufficiently young and tender for the spit. Put a 
little water to it, just enough to cover half the meat, and stew 
very gently over a slow fire or steam apparatus. When the 
top piece is done through, cover the meat with boiling water 
or broth ; season with spices and vegetables ; stew all together 
for 8 or 10 hours in an uncovered stewpan ; skim off the 
fat, and strain the liquor through a fine sie\ e, or woollen 
tamis, known by cooks as a " tammy." 

Brown stock may be made from an ox-cheek, ox-tail, brisket, 
flank, or shin of beef; which will, either together or sepa- 
rately, make a strong jelly if stewed down with a piece of ham 
or lean bacon, in the proportion of ^ lb. to every 7 lbs. of 

meat ; but the shin of beef alone will afford a stronger and 

better flavour. 
This stock may also be reduced to a glaze by boiling the 

skimmed liquor as fast as possible in a newly -tinned stewpan, 

until it becomes of the desired consistence and of a good brown 

colour ; taking care at the same time to prevent it from 

burning.* 
JFor a cheap and good Brown Gravy, — Slice and fry 3 

onions in butter a nice brown ; toast a large slice of bread a 

* Glaze may be had at most of the oil-shops in London. 



72 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. 

considerable time, till quite hard and very brown, but not 
burnt. Set these, and any bit of meat, or bone of a leg of 
mutton, &c., and some herbs, on the fire, with water in pro- 
portion, and stew till the gravy is thick and rich : add salt and 
pepper, strain off, and keep cool. 

BR O WN OR A VY SO UP, 

1. — The meat used for making this soup should be quite 
fresh, and of the common gravy beef; if the shin be usedj 
break the bones, as the marrow will add to its richness. 

Take 7 to 8 lbs. of the meat, cut a small portion of it into 
thick pieces and put it with 3 or 4 large sliced onions into a 
close stewpan, with a little butter, until fried to a fine brown. 
That done, add a shank of ham, just cover the meat with cold 
water — say a couple of quarts--and let it simmer by the fire 
for at least 3 hours; during which time it should not be 
allowed to boil, but, when coming to that point, check it with 
cold water, and skim it. As the pores of the meat will then 
be opened, and the gravy drawn, throw in 3 quarts of warm 
water, along with a handful or J oz. each of black pepper, 
allspice, and salt, as well as a bundle of sweet herbs, a few 
cloves, a couple of shalots, 2 or 3 middling-sized carrots and 
turnips (the latter an hour afterwards), together with a couple 
of heads of celery, and allow the whole to boil slowly until 
the meat is done to rags, and the vegetables become tender. 
Then strain it off, and let it stand during the night. Remove 
the fat on the following day, set any portion of it on the 
fire an hour before dinner, and, when thoroughly heated, 
season it with mushroom or walnut ketchup, and send it up 
with a plate of toasted bread, cut into small square pieces, 
without crust. 

You will thus form a gallon to 5 or 6 quarts of strong soup, 
according to the quality of the meat ; but as it is a winter 
soup, it will bear keeping, and, if served at more than one 
time, the flavour may be varied by the addition of different 
sorts of ingredients, as for instance — 1st, plain gravy ; 2ndly, 
gravy and vegetables ; and 3rdly, vermicelK : or if only 
one-half or a third part of the quantity be wanted, it may 
be prepared in the same manner by proportionally re- 
ducing the materials. It may be also flavoured with red 
wine. 



IP. TIL] MEAT-SOUPS. 73 

CLEAR GRAVY SOUP 

8. — 1b made from solid lean beef in the pn^xirtion of 1 pint 

water to 1 lb. of meat and 2 oz. of ham, according to the 

fltmctiaiis above given ; strain it through a napkin, to free it 

.tm the dbreds of meat and vegetables. Boil the vegetables 

eparately a &w hours before dimier, in a portion of the broth, 

inl add them to the soap. We cannot too often repeat, that 

rhen soup is suffidoitly boOed on the first day, all that it 

requires on the second is to make it thoroughly hot. Many 

penons prefer boiling all the vegetables in the soup on the 

flnt day, thinking that they improve its flavour. This may 

be done in common soup tiiat is not to be strained, but should 

never be dcme if you wish it to be very bright and clear. 

It may be seasoned as above, and should be of a clear amber 
eoioiir, without any artificial browning; but if wanted of a 
deep eoIoiir, a burnt onion will suffice. 

This soup is, in fiu^t, the fisundation of all those made frmn 
beef: the great secret of making it being, << not to spare the 
meat,'' and to boil it slowly. 

MACARONI SOUPS. 

8. — ^Take a quart of gravy soup ; break 2 oz. of Naples 
macaroni into pieces of little more than an inch long, putting 
them, by degrees, into a small portion of the boiling soup, to 
prevent them from sticking together, and let them boil until 
quite tender, but not soft or pulpy — from 15 to 20 minutes if 
quite fresh, but nearly ^ an hour if at all stale. Vermicelli 
is used in the same manner. They will improve the consistence 
of the soup if the quantity above stated be added ; but it is 
useless and does not look well to see, as at some tables, only a 
few strings of it floating in the tureen. The flavour will also 
be much improved if a small quantity of Parmesan cheese be 
either melted in it, or grated and served up separately. 

SAGO SOUP. 

4. — Take gravy soup, quite clear and brown ; add to it a 
sufficient quantity of sago to thicken it to the consistence o^ 
pea-soup, and season it with soy and ketchup ; to which may b 
added a small glass of red wine. It may also be made, as 
white soupj of beef, by leaving out the soy and ketchup, ar 
usii^ white wine, adding a little cream and mace. 



74 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VH. 



OX-TAIL SOUP. 

6. — Two ox-tails, if properly stewed, with a couple of pounds 
of gravy beef and a bone of ham, will make an excellent soup. 
Cut the tails into joints, and boil very gently for several hours 
in a sufficient quantity of water, with the beef and ham, carrots, 
turnips, and celery, 2 or 3 onions, a piece of crust of bread, a 
bunch of sweet herbs, a clove or two, and some peppercorns. 
Take out the tails when tender, and let the beef, &c., boil 4 
hours longer, then strain the liquor and remove the fat in the 
same manner as for clear gravy soup. If made without ham- 
bones, or other flavouring ingredients, it will require the addi- 
tion of a little ketchup, or some of the prepared sauces, and a 
glass of wine, with a moderate quantity of cayenne. Add the 
tails and some pieces of carrot and turnip cut into fancy 
shapes. 

When thickened ox-tail soup is preferred, proceed in the 
same manner as above, and thicken the broth with brown 

lt)UX. 

Another, — Cut up 2 ox-tails, separating them at the joints, 
fry them with a little butter, a carrot, turnip, 3 onions, a leek, 
a head of celery, and a bunch of sweet herbs, adding a bay- 
leaf. Add a pint of water and a teaspoonful of peppercorns ; 
set it over the fire, stirring it frequently imtil the pan is covered 
with a glaze ; stir in J lb. of flour and a tablespoonful of salt. 
Fill up the stewpan with 3 quarts of water, stirring it occa- 
sionally. When it boils, set it on the stove, and let it simmer 
until the tails are quite tender, when put them into the tureen 
and strain the soup over them, blanch and slice a head of 
celery, add it and serve. 

OX-CHEEK SOUP, 

6. — Clean and soak well half an ox-head, which should be 
broken up by the butcher ; take the meat from the bones, and 
put it into an earthen pan with 3 onions sliced, and fried 
brown in butter and flour, without becoming burnt ; a bunch 
of sweet herbs ; allspice, pepper, and salt, a large spoonful 
of each. Lay the bones close on the meat, and pour on 3 or 
4 quarts of water, or a quart of water to every pound of the 
cut meat. Cover the pan with a coarse brown paper; tie 
c^o&^jf and let it stand in the oven 3 or 4 hours ; or put it by

i side of the flre^ in a covered pot^ until the meat is tender ; 

len done, take out the bones, and pour the soup and meat 

to a pan. When to be used, take off the &,t, and, having 

armed the soup, cut the meat into pieces not larger than a 

Mmthful ; make the brains into forcemeat baUs ; and as the 

aup^ thov^ excellent in its kind, is not of a very delicate 

jitare, it diould be highly seasoned with walnut-ketchup, and 

et jenne, or chili vinegar, coupled with a clove of garlic, and a 

good sized glass of madeira or port wine, or a large table* 

ipooiifbl of brandy. A little celery, carrot, and turnip, if 

minced small and boiled in a basin of it a short time, will 

improve the flavour. Either ox-cheek, ox-tail, or shin of beef 

wiU severally make strong jelly, if stewed down until reduced 

to a pulp, and the bones broken up ; a process which will be

full 8 hours before you dine. When it has come to a hard 
boil, and the scum has risen (which it will do as soon as it has 
boiled), skim it well ; then set it on hot coals in the comer, 
and keep it simmering steadily, so as to continue a regular 
heat. 

About 3 hours afterwards, put in a couple of heads of 
celery, 4 carrots cut small, and as many onions sliced and 
fried, with either a very small head of cabbage cut into little 
pieces, or a large one whole, if to be eaten with the meat, or, 
if you have any objection to cabbage, substitute a larger pro- 
portion of the other vegetables, or else tomatas instead. Put 
also in a bunch of herbs, tied up in a thin muslin rag to pre- 
vent its floating on the surface. It will require at least 8 
hours' cooking ; remembering to put in the vegetables 3 hours 
afler the meat, and the turnips only i an hour before it is 
done. If you wish to send any portion of the meat to table, 
take the b^ part of it out of the soup about 2 hours before 
dinner; let the remainder be left in the pot till you send 
up the Bwxp, as by that time it will be boiled to ragS) and

have transferred all its flavour to the liquid, and must be 
strained. 

Next day, take what is left of the soup ; put it into a pot, 
and simmer it over hot coals for i an hour : a longer time 
will weaken the taste. If it has been well made, and kept in 
a cool place, it will be found better the second day than the 
first. 

If your family is very small, and the leg of beef large, it 
may furnish soup for several successive days. Half the leg 
may therefore be sufficient, previously breaking to pieces aU 
the bones with a mallet or kitchen cleaver, which by causing 
them to give out their marrow will greatly enrich the soup. 

Or : — ^When a large quantity of any butcher's meat is 
brought in for the use of the family, the joints will require 
trimming : take all the parings, adding a slice or two of bsucon, 
beef or mutton bones, with an old fowl, or a rabbit, if you 
have one, turnips, and all sorts of vegetables, onions, herl^, a 
few slices of carrot, ketchup, pepper, salt, &c. ; put a piece of 
butter at the bottom of the pan, cover it closely, and put it 
over a slow fire for a few minutes, shaking the saucepan occa* 
sionally. Then pour in boiling water, and let it stew until it 
is rich ; apportioning the water to the quantity of meat. If 
there be any solid portion of beef, of which the soup is made, 
let it be taken out previous to the meat being " done to rags," 
and sent up along with the roots in some of the liquor, thick- 
ened and flavoured with any piquant sauce : it will form an 
excellent stew. 

These receipts constitute the standing household dish so well 
known in France as the pot aufeu. 

Cheap and wholesome pottages, in common use among the 
middling classes in various parts of Europe, are also made in 
different modes, a few of which are these : — 

COTTAGE SOUPS. 

7. — ^Take 2 lbs. of lean beef, cut into small pieces, with 
J lb. of bacon, 2 lbs. of mealy potatoes, 3 oz. of rice, car- 
rots, turnips, and onions sliced, or leeks and cabbage. Fry 
the meat, cabbage, and onions in butter or dripping, the latter 
being the most savoury ; and put them into a gallon of water, 
to stew gently over a slow fire for 3 hours, putting in the 
carrots at the same time, but the turnips and rice only time 
enough to allow of their being well done ; and mashing the pota-

( win make 5 pmts of ezcdlent soup at the cost of about

Ors — To any quantity or kind of broth, add whaterer vege- 
afalfli may be in season, and stew them gently till quite tender. 
IWb strain the soap; thicken it with floor and water, to be 
■ixed gndoBUy while snnmering; and, when that is done, 
md leaaoiied to yoor taste, retam the yegetables to the soap, 
md let it boil well for ^ an hoar. 

8COT8 KAIL 

a^ — Is dnefly made of mutton, either fresh or salted; beef is 
<iily used when mutton cannot conveniently be had. 3 or 4 
lbs. of meat diould be put to a gallon of cold water, along with 
a modemte quantity of pearl-barley, with le^ or <Huons, and 
allowed to atew until tender ; if salted, put the meat into water 
over ni^;lit, chai^pi^ it once before boiling. Then have ready 
die hearts of 2 cabbages cut small, or greens, if cabbages 
are not in season ; put them into the broth, which must be 
allowed to boU up uncovered until reduced to 2 quarts. It 
should only be seasoned with pepper and salt; but will be 
much improved by the addition of a couple of onions fried 
ID batter; indeed, both carrots and turnips are also some- 
times used, but their addition deprives the soup of the title of 
"Kail." which is derived from the greens which are usually 
employed. 

The meat is ser\'ed with the soup, and, in like manner as 
the olla of the Spaniards, or the pot au feu of the French, is 
the standing household dish among the middle classes of Scot- 
land. 

COCK-A-LEEKIE— 

9. — Or as in Scotland called " cocky-leeky " — is there also 
a very ancient dish, and is recorded to have been a special 
&vourite of James I. It is made thus : — 

Stew a large fowl, a marrow-bone, and 2 or 3 lbs. of beef, 
with 2 or 3 Scotch pints (4 to 6 quarts) of water, and the 
white ends of 2 or 3 dozen of leeks, cut in pieces. Just before 
serving, add ^ lb. of prunes, which dish with the soup and the 
fowl ; but not the meat or marrow-bone, which, when put to 
boil, most be Prided, and left uncovered. 



78 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. Vnj 

Or : — ^Put 7 lbs. of the upper end of a leg of beef, and an 
old fowl, in a pot, with water enough to cover it, the white 
parts of 2 or 3 dozen of leeks half-boiled and sliced, and 1 lb. 
of prunes. Stew till the meat be tender, skimming it well, 
and, if you choose, the fowl may be disjointed and sent up 
in the soup. The leeks should be blanched, and as many 
used as to thicken the soup ; but no other seasoning is usually 
employed than salt and allspice, with a small quantity o£ 
mace. 

MUTTON-BR TH, 

10. — ^The best part of the mutton from which to make good 
broth is the chump end of the loin, but it may be excellently 
made from the scrag end of the neck only, which should be 
stewed gently for a long time — full 3 hours, or longer if it 
be large — until it becomes tender ; but not boiled to rags, as 
it usually is. A few grains of whole pepper, with a couple 
of fried onions and some turnips, should be put along with 
the meat an hour or two before sending up the broth, which 
should be strained from the vegetables, and chopped parsley 
and thyme be mixed in it. The turnips should be mashed, and 
served in a separate dish, to be eaten with the mutton, with 
parsley and butter, or caper-sauce. 

If meant for persons in health, it ought to be strong, or it 
will be insipid. The cooks usually skim it frequently ; but if 
given as a remedy for a severe cold, it is much better not to 
remove the fat, as it is very healing to the chest. 

Another way^ f(yr an Invalid, — Boil 3 lbs. of the scrag end 
of a neck of mutton, cut into pieces, in 3 quarts of water, with 
2 turnips and a table-spoonful of pearl barley or rice. Let it 
boil gently for 3 hours, keeping it cleanly skimmed. Serve 
with bits of toasted bread. 

SHEEP'S-HEAD SOUP. 

11. — Have the head carefully cleaned, put it into a stewpan 
with a little water, and when it is heated through fill up the 
pot. When it is sufficiently tender, take it up, remove the 
meat from the bones, and return the bones into the broth, 
adding onion, sweet-herbs, &c., as before directed. The head 
and trotters may also be put with some vegetables into an 
earthen jug, containing ^ gallon of water; cover it close up. 



CaiP. TIL] MEAT-SOUPS. 7* * 

and bake it ; either cut tlip meat from the bones, when suSi- 
ciently teniier, and put it iu sniull pieces into tlie soup, or serve 
Dp the head and trotters separately, either whole or with tlie 
meat cut off and made into a stew. 

In Scotland, the head is uiiually singed with a red-hot iron 
to remove the wool, but witiiout burning' or otherwise injuring 
the skin. The head is t)ien soaked during the night, washed, 
scraped, and split ; the brains taken out, and either fried o^ 
made into forcemeat balls, and the head slewed in the btotli.' 
till tender. 

BARLEY BROTH. , 

12. — Take a breakfast-cupful of pearl-barley, boil it in e. 
gallon of water gently for h an hour, then lake 3 lbs. of meat — '• 
lamb or mutton chops, with the fat cut oif, or lean beef — putt 
tbem into a separate stewpan, dress them with a small quantiM' 
of water, add to them any kind of vegetables — carrots ana 
turnips, with small ouions, celery, and green peas if in season 
— salt, pepper, and, with the water and the barley, let the 
whole boil gently for 2 hours or longer, and serve it up all to- 
getlier. 

Or: — Tabe 3 quarts of good broth, cut info a stewpan 2 
carrots, 3 or 4 turnips, 2 heads of celery, a lettuce, a little 
parsley, and some small onions, and a little butter and gravy. 
Stew until the vegetables become quite tender ; add to this a 
few spoonfuls of rice, boiled separately ; put the whole to- 
gether, and boil for ^ of an hour. 

SCOTCH BROTH. 

13, — Set on the fire 4 ounces of pearl-barley, with 3 Scotch 
pints (or 6 quarts) of salt water : when it boils, skim it, and 
add what quantity of salt beef or fresh brisket you choose, and 
a marrow-bone or a fowl, with a couple of pounds of either lean 
beef or mutton, and a good quantity of leeks, cabbagea, or 
pavoTS ; or you may use turnips, onions, and grated carrots. 
Keep it boiling for at least 4 or 5 hours ; but if a fowl be used, 
let it not be put in till just time enough to bring it to table 
when well done, for it must be served up separately. 

Or: — Take the cliops from a neck of mutton ; cut the re- 
mainder up in small pieces, and let it stew the whole day. 
Take also a breakfast-cup of Scotch barley, and boil it in water 
till it gets dry ; then chop Sne 2 large onions and tuEio^^

80 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. YH. 

which put with the barley and chops into a close stewpan, 
strain the stock into it, let it boil 1^ hour, and skim it well, 
seasoning it only with salt and black pepper. This wiU make 
a large tureen of broth, besides preserving the chops for table* 

HOTCff'POTCff. 

14. — Take any quantity of lamb-chops, pare off the skin and 
greater part of the fat, trim the bones, cut the smaller end of 
the chops into pieces, and lay them along with the chops put 
in whole in a stewpan in this manner : — A layer of chops at 
the bottom, covered with every kind of vegetable cut in small 
pieces, onions, celery, lettuce, carrots, turnips, and green peas ; 
then put on a layer of chops, and so on with the vegetables 
until the whole are added ; cover the ingredients with water, 
and let it stew several hours. very gently, until both the meat 
and vegetables become tender, and the soup thick. 

Scotch Hotch-potch is made in the same manner, only that 
both beef and mutton are indiscriminately used, and minced 
instead of being left in chops. 

PEPPER-POT HOTCH POTCH. 

15. — To 3 quarts of water put vegetables according to the 
season. In summer, peas, French beans, cauliflowers, lettuce, 
and spinach ; in winter, beet-root and endive,* carrots, turnips, 
celery, and onions in both, all cut small ; and stew with 2 lbs. 
of neck of mutton, or a fowl and 1 lb. of pickled pork, in 3 
quarts of water, till quite tender. 

On first boiling, skim. Half an hour before serving, add a 
lobster or crab, cleared from the bones. Season with salt and 
cayenne. A small quantity of rice should be put in with the 
meat. Some people choose very small suet dumplings boiled 
with it. Should any fat rise, skim nicely, and put i a cup of 
water with a little flour. 

It may be made of various things, using a due proportion of 
fish, flesh, fowl, vegetables, and pulse. In the West Indies it 
is the universal dish of the coloured people ; but seasoned so 
highly with green capsicums and peppers, that it is there called 
" pepper-pot." 

* If endive be used, it should, however, be boiled in two or three waters to 
take off its bitterness.

and a few blades of mace ; let it boil Sot 5 hours, and it is th«i

18. — Veal ffrapy.— When all the meat has been takenfknn 
a knuckle of veal, divide the bones, and lay them in a stewpot, 
with a pound of the scrag of a neck, an ounce of lean bacon, 
a bunch of parsley, a litue thyme, a bit of lemon-peel, and a 
dessert-spoonful of pepper : add as much water as will cover 
them. Boil and skim it ; stop the pot down close, and let it 
simmer as slowly as possible 3 hours. Strain off, and let it 
stand till cold ; then skim it, and take the jelly from the sedi- 
ment. Pound some mace fine, and boil it with 2 spoonfuls of 
water, and add to the gravy. If cream Is to be put to it, do 
not add the salt until the gravy comes off the fire. 

WHITE SOUPS. 

19. — Take a large scrag or a knuckle of veal, and ^ lb. of 

Vfii ham ; some blades of mace and a piece of migrated nut- 



82 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VH, 

meg, sliced onions, and heads of celery, with a little salt and 
an equal quantity of loaf-sugar. Break the bones, and stew 
all gently with 1 gallon to 6 quarts of water — ^according to 
the weight of the meat — until it is done to rags and the soup 
becomes sufficiently strong : skim it, and strain it through a 
hair sieve ; or, if allowed to stand during the night, pour it 
into an earthen vessel, and next morning take off the £tt. 
When preparing it for table, add to the liquor from i to J- 
lb. of sweet almonds, blanched and finely pounded ; boil a 
short time and strain again ; then put in i pint to a pint of 
good thidk cream, and the yolk of an egg ; but when the 
cream and egg are put in, be careful not to let the soup boil, 
or it will curdle. The safest way to avoid this is to mix the 
cream and egg in the tureen and pour the soup upon it. This 
in French cookery is called " Liaison," 

Or : — Thicken it as follows : — 

Blanch i lb. of sweet almonds, and beat them to a paste 
in a marble mortar, with a little water to prevent their 
oiling ; mince a large slice of dressed veal or chicken, and 
beat it with a piece of stale white bread : add all this to a pint 
of thick cream, a bit of fresh lemon-peel, and a blade of mace, 
in the finest powder. Boil it a few minutes ; add to it a pint 
of soup, and strain and pulp it through a coarse sieve : this 
thickening is then fit for putting to the rest, which should boil 
for J an hour afterwards. 

If cream cannot be had, use new milk with the yolks of J a 
dozen hard-boiled eggs grated and mixed with the almonds as 
a thickening, or beaten up with 2 spoonfuls of ground rice, 
arrowroot, or common flour, until it becomes quite smooth 
and of the thickness of cream ; and a scrag of veal will answer 
all the purpose of the knuckle. 

An excellent white Soup may be made of the knuckle of 
veal, after cutting off as much meat as will make collops ; or 
of any kind of white poultry and rabbits ; adding 2 or 3 shank- 
bones of mutton nicely cleaned, and J lb. of very fine un- 
dressed lean gammon of bacon, with a bunch of sweet herbs, 
a piece of fresh lemon-peel, 2 or 3 onions, 3 blades of mace, 
and a dessert-spoonful of white pepper : boil all in 3 quarts of 
water, till the meat falls quite to pieces. 

White Soup may also be varied with rice : wash 2 or 3 oz. 
of the best kind, blanch it in boiling water, and drain it, add 



Chap. VH.] SOUPS OF VEAL, POULTRY, AND GAME. 83 

the rice to the soup, and let it stew until it swells ; or thicken 
it with ground rice, bruised sago, tapioca, and arrowroot. If 
macaroni is used, it should be added soon enough to get per- 
fectly tender, after soaking in cold water. Vermicelli may 
be added aft;er the thickening, as it requires less time to do. 
K the stock has been made with fowl, take out the white por- 
tion when well stewed, pound the meat in a mortar, and add 
it to the soup ; which is a great improvement. It is the 
&shion now to send up grated Parmesan cheese with white 
soup ; but not unless made with vermicelli or some sorts of 
gravy soup, as it partly destroys that delicacy which ought to 
be the distinctive property of all white soups. 

Two or three pints of a plainer white Soup may likewise 
be made of a small knuckle of veal, with seasoning, as directed 
in the last article ; and both served together, with the addition 
of J pint of good milk. Two spoonfuls of cream and a little 
gromid rice will give it a proper thickness. 

Another white Soup, — Take 2 quarts of the stock, and boil 
the crumb of a roll in a gill of milk ; beat the yolks of 6 hard- 
boiled eggs with 3 oz. of sweet almonds very well in a mortar, 
with a little cayenne pepper, and add the whole to the soup : 
it may be poured over slices of French roll sent up in the 
tureen. 

White Potato- Soup, — Take large mealy potatoes peeled 
raw and sliced with half the number of onions, seasoned with 
white pepper, mace, and salt, and stewed with 2 lbs. of the 
scrag of mutton or veal in 3 quarts of water during 4 hours ; 
then skinuned and strained. Then add 3 pints of new milk 
and i oz. of bitter almonds pounded. liub the potatoes 
through a tanmiy. Let it boil before being served up, but 
keep stirring it to prevent the almonds from oiling, 

ALMOND SOUP, 

20. — Make your stock of veal, or an old fowl ; then put into 
a mortar 1 lb. of sweet almonds, with a few of the bitter sort, 
the yolks of 6 hard-boiled eggs, and a little white pepper : 
pound this very fine, put it into the stock, and let it simmer 
gently, putting in a little cold broth as it boils away. Strain 
it off; thicken it with butter kneaded in flour ; and, just befoie 
serving, add a teacupfu] of good cream, 

G 2 



84 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VH. 



RICE SOUP. 

21. — ^Take white stock, season it, and either whole rice 
boiled till very tender, or the flour of rice may be used ; ^ lb. 
will be sufficient for 2 quarts of broth. 

VEAL POTTAGE, 

22. — Take off a knuckle of veal all the meat that can be 
made into cutlets, &c., and set the remainder on to stew, with 
an onion, a bunch of herbs, a blade of mace, some whole pep- 
per, and 5 pints of water : cover it close ; and let it do on a slow 
fire, 4 or. 5 hours at least. Strain it, and set it by till next 
day ; then take the fat and sediment from the jelly, and sim- 
mer it with either turnips, celery, sea-kale, and Jerusalem 
artichokes, or some of each, cut into small dice, till tender, 
seasoning it with salt and peppef. Before serving, rub 
down half a spoonful of flour with half a pint of good cream 
and butter the size of a walnut, and boil a few minutes. 
Let a small roll simmer in the soup, and serve this with 
it It should be as thick as middling cream, and, if thus made 
of the vegetables above mentioned, will make a very delicate 
white pottage. The pottage may also be thickened with rice 
and pearl-barley ; or the veal may be minced, and served up 
in the tuteen. 

VEAL SROTir.—E. R, 

23.— -Stew a knuckle of veal of 4 or 5 lbs. in 3 quarts of 
water, with 2 blades of mace, an onion, a head of celery, and 
a little parsley, pepper, and salt ; let the whole simmer very 
gently until the liquor is reduced to 2 quarts ; then take out 
the meat, when the mucilaginous parts are done, and serve it 
up with parsley and butter. Add to the broth either 2 oz. of 
rice separately boiled, or of vermicelli, put in only long 
enough to be stewed tender. Dish the knuckle separately, 
and serve it with parsley and butter. 

FRIARS CHICKEN, 

24. — ^Take 3 quarts of water, and put into it 3 or 4 lbs. of 
knuckle of veal : stew gently till all the goodness is out of the 
meat ; skim the fat off, and strain the broth through a sieve. 
Then take a chicken, or a full-grown young fowl, dissect it 



Ceap.VU,] SOTJPS of veal, poultry, and game. 85 

into pieces, and put it into the broth, which should be made 
hot, and seasoned only with salt and parsley. Let it simmer 
for nearly uiother hour ; beat the whites and yolks of 3 or 4 
eg^ thoroughly, and mix them effectually with the soup, just 
before serving; taking care to stir them all one way. Rab- 
bits may be substituted for fowls. 

POTAGE A LA REINE 

25, — Is 80 called from its having been said to be a iavourite 
soup at the table of her Majesty, 

Stew 2 or 3 young fowls for about an hour in good fresh- 
made veal broth : then take them out, skin them, and pound 
the breast, or only the white meat, in a mortar until it becomes 
quite smooth. That done, mash the yoIE^s of 3 or 4 hard- 
DoUed egga with the crumb of a French-roll soaked either in 
the broth or in milk, and mix this with the pounded meat to 
form a paste, which must be afterwards passed through a sieve. 
During this operation the bones and fikin have been left stew- 
iDg in the broth, wtiich must then be strained, and the paste 
put gradually into it : then, let it boil briskly for a short time, 
Btirring it all the while to ensure its thorough mixture. 
When that is done take it from the tire ; warm a pint or more 
of cream, and pour it gently into the soup. 

This beii^ a delicate white soup, the broth should only be 
aeaaoned with salt and mace, nor ^ould there be any other 
v^etable used than celery ; but the cream may be flavoured 
wiSi almonds. 

GIBLET SOVF.—E. R. 

26.— Scald and clean a set, or more, of giblets i stew them 
by tbonselves in a little gravy, with 2 onions, a bunch of 
Bwe^ herbs, 2 glasses of white wine, pepper, and salt. Stew 
mitil the gizzards are quit« tender ; then take out the gibl^A 
and strain the broth. Make a stock with 2 lbs. of gravy-bee^ 
3 onions, and 5 pints of water. Skin some onions, slice them 
thin, and fry them in butter, with a small quantity of basil, 
maijoram, and parsley; add flour sufficient to thicken ths 
■Oop, and let it be slightly browned. Then stir in the boiling 
dodc ; let it boil ^ an hour, pass it through a tammy, put it 
again on the Are, and skim it carefully ; add the giblets, 2 
^■MB of aherry or Madeira wine, and a little lemwiuioQ* 



86 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VH. 

Season it highly. The gizzards should be cut into quarters, 
or they will not become so tender as the other parts ; divide 
the liver, feet, neck, and pinions in moderate-sized pieces; 
take off the bill and cut the head in two. 

In some marshy situations, where geese are reared more 
for the profit derived from their feathers than their flesh, and 
thus not properly fattened, the whole bird is sometimes made 
into soup, ready trussed for the table, the giblets being dressed 
as above, along with the carcase, which is served up separately, 
smothered in onions. It must be stewed very slowly, and wOl 
take from 3 to 4 hours, according to its size, before it 
can be brought to table; but the soup will be of first-rate 
quality. 

Dtick Giblets make a very good soup, but, being much 
smaller than those of a goose, a larger quantity will be neces- 
sary ; and those of other fowls, turkeys, and game, may also 
be used with nearly the same effect. 

HUNTERS SOUP, AND GAME STOCK, 

27. — When sportsmen bivouac upon the moors, the produce 
of the game-bag must be put into the soup-kettle with any 
odds and ends of other meat, and a bottle or two of any wine 
or beer that can be spared ; then — filling it with water — com- 
mence the brew, which may be intrusted to any servant ; he 
being only required to begin early in the morning, and let 
the game stew long enough to extract from it the entire of its 
juices. 

When the party returns in the evenii^ from shooting, they 
will thus find the essential requisite of a good soup ; and 
gentlemen who have preserves, or any superabundance of 
game for present use, or from its being too old, should order 
their cook to stew it down to a strong consomnU; which, when 
well seasoned, will form excellent stock. 

GAME SOUP 

28.-^May be made of any sort of feathered game — ^whether 
partridge, grouse, or pheasant, and whether raw and whole, 
or only tiie remains of the carcase after being roasted ; the 
latter is, however, the most usual mode ; for uiless the birds 
are very old, few persons have so many as to spare them.

ealire for the sfock-pol, and the unconsunied parts are most 
commonly stewed down along; with gmvj-beef. The better 
mode is, however, to take the breasts, or any portion of the white 
meat which hag been left, and pound it iii a mortar ; pulling 
the backs and legs in a, stewpan with a quart of veal gravy 
and a slice of lean ham, 2 or 3 green onions, and a little pep- 
per and gait, and letting' them stew till the gixxiness is com- 
pletely extracted ; then take out the backs and legs, and put 
in a pint of strong gravy ; take the yolks of 2 hard-bo&ed 
c^s and pound them with the meat that is in the mortar; rub 
it through the famis ; add it to the liquor in which the legs 
were stewed : this must be done last, as, if it stands long, it 
vill spoil. Mix all together, and heat and stir it over the fire 
until it be of the desired consdsteney. If too thick, add some 
pnre veal gravy ; but season it very moderately, as it ought 
possess sufficient of the high game flavour. 



PARTRIDGE AND PHEASAXT SOUP. 



1 



Sd. — Skin a leash of old birds, and cut them into pieces, 
irith 3 or 4 slices of ham, 3 lbs. of gravy beef, a stick of 
celery, and 3 large onions cut into slices. IVy them all in 
butter till brown, but lake care not to hum thcni. Tlien put 
them into a stewpan, with 5 pints of boiling water, a few pep- 
percorns, and a little salt. Stew it gently 2 hours ; then 
Btrain it through a sieve, and put it again into a stewpan, with 
HHue stewed celery and fried bread ; when it is near boiling, 
ikim it, pour it into a tureen, and serve it up hot. 

CLEAR HARE SOUP.^E. B. 
90. — Cut a lai^ hare into pieces, and put it, together with 
& Mfsg or knuckle of veal, and a cow-heel, into a kettle, with 
5 or 6 quarts of water, herbs, onion, &x., and a Uttle mace ; 
stew it over a slow fire for 2 hours, or natil the gravy is good; 
thai t^e out the back and legs, cut the meat off, retumii^ 
the bones, and stewing the whole until the meat ia nearly di»* 
■idved. Then strain off the gravy, put a glass of wine to 
«Teiy quart of the soup, and send it to table with the meat 
cut into small pieces, and warmed with the wine, which will 
tak* aboat 10 minutes or } of an hour. Soup may be made 
in tnueli the game way of either leveret or fawn, only not 
tt/Bmag them eo long.

THICK HARE SOUP. 

31. — Cut the hare into pieces, and lay them at the bottom 
of a large jar, with a slice or two of lean ham, an onion, a 
stick of celery^ and a bundle of sweet herbs, with about 3 
quarts of boiling water. Put the jar into an oven, and let it 
remain until the hare is stewed to rags ; it will take 3 hours 
baking, and the same time simmering by the fire. Strain off 
the liquor, take the meat from the bones and pound it in a 
mortar^ mixing it with the soup until it is quite thick. Ijet it 
boil up once, with a spoonful of Harvey^s sauce, a glass of 
port wine, and a little cayenne pepper. Send it to table with 
forcemeat balls in the tureen, made with the chopped liver, 
and fried. The better way, however, is to make the force- 
meat balls with the brains, and to grate or pound the liver, 
when thoroughly boiled, for the purpose of thickening the 
soup, which should always be made of a good consistence. 

A more frugal Hare Soup may, however, be made if there 
be only 3 or 4 in family. It is a very excellent and economical 
plan to cut off the head and shoulders of the hare, and roast 
only the hind quarters. Then, on the following day, stew 
down the bones, along with the head and shoulders, and make 
the whole into soup ; using the brains and liver as above, and 
seasoning it to your palate. A pound or two of shin of beef 
will increase the quantity ; and a few minced roots with a mu&h** 
room, or a little of the powder, will improve the flavour. 

ARTIFICIAL HARE SOUP. 

32.-^Frocure a bullock's heart as soon as possible after the 
animal is killed, cut away from it the &t, pipes, and outer 
skin, split and clean it from the bloody then slice it into an 
earthen jar, with a cover that fits close ; add 2 or 3 good-si^ed 
onions, one of them to be stuck with cloves, a blade of mace, 
pepper, and salt, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a good slice of 
bread ; also a piece of butter rubbed in flour ; put all down 
into a pot with water suflicient to cover the ingredients, pat 
the cover on, and a coarse paste over it, that the steam may 
not escape. Place it in a pan of boiling water, letting the 
water come nearly to the top of the jar, stewing it for several 
hours, and keep filling up the pan with boilmg water as it 
wastes away. When the meat is tender enough, pound it in 
S marble mortar with the bread till quite fine; and while

bonesf and 1 Uhofhaminsinallslices. Add an onion minced, 
and blade pepper to your taste. Put only as much water aa 
win oo¥er it, and stew it gently for an hour, keeping the pot 
dosdy covered. Then dkun it well, and pour in a quart of 
baiiDg water. Add a head of celery cut into small pieces, 
and 3 blades of mace. Boil it g^tly 2h hours; thm put in 
j^ lb. of butter, divided into small pieces, and rolled in flour, 
and add i pint of port or Madeira wine. Let it boil i of an 
hour hmger, and send it to table with the meat in it. 

Orz — Take a breast of veniscm, cut it in small pieces, and 
dewit gently in brown gravy soup. Serve it with roots cutin 
dice and French beans in diamonds, adding 2 glasses of port 
wine when first put on. 

The head of the deer chopped in pieces, and the flesh stewed 
to a jelly, is also an excellent addition to the soup. 

TURTLE SOUP,^ 

84. — Hang up the turtle by the hind fins, cut off the head, 
and allow it to drain. 

Cut off the fore fins ; separate the callipash (upper shell) from 
the callipee {under shell), beginning at the hind fins. Cut off 
the fiit which will be found adhering to the callipash and to 
the lean meat of the callipee. Then cut off the hind fins. 
Take off the lean meat from the callipee and from the fins, 
and cut it into pieces 2 inches square and put into a stewpan. 
Hie callipash, callipee, and fins, must be held in scalding (not 
boiling) water for a few minutes, which will cause the shell to 
quit easily. 

* Tills xecdpt is a most excellent one, and is in constant use by the party 
who fiKToared us with it ; and we may add, that some thousands of pounds 
pi|^ ti tutte pass through Jbis hands every year. 



90 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VH. 

Cut the callipash and callipee into pieces about 6 inches 
square, which put into a stock-pot with some light veal stock. 
Let it boil until the meat is tender, and then take it out into 
cold water ; free the meat from the bones, and cut it into 
pieces an inch square. Return the bones into the stock and let 
it boil gently for 2 hours, strain it off, and it is then fit for use. 

Cut the fins across into pieces about an inch wide, boil than 
in stock with an onion, 2 or 3 cloves, a faggot of parsley' and 
thyme, a sprig of sweet basil and marjoram. When tender 
take them out and add this stock to the other. 

Take the lean meat, put into a stewpan with a pint of 
Madeira, 4 tablespoonfuls of chopped green shalot, 2 lemons 
sliced, a bunch of thyme, marjoram, and savory (about 2 
tablespoonfuls each when chopped), H tablespoonfuls of sweet 
basil (chopped), and 4 tablespoonfuls of parsley. Pound 
together a nutmeg, 1 dozen allspice, 1 blade of mace, 5 or 6 
cloves, 1 tablespoonful of pepper and of salt. Mix the whole 
together with as much curry-powder as will lie on a shilling. 
Put about two-thirds of this to the lean meat, with i lb. of 
fresh butter and 1 quart stock. Let the whole be gently 
sweated until the meat is done. 

Take a large knuckle of ham, cut it into very small dice, 
put into a stewpan with 4 large onions sliced, 6 bay-leaves, 
3 blades of mace, 1 dozen allspice, | lb. of butter ; let it 
sweat until the onions are melted. Shred a small bunch of 
basil, a larger one of thyme, savory, and marjoram; throw 
these into the onions, and keep them as green as possible : 
when sweated sufficiently, add flour according to your judg- 
ment sufficient to thicken the soup. Add by degrees the 
stock in which the callipash and callipee were boiled, and the 
seasoning stock from the lean meat. Boil for an hour ; rub 
through a tammy, and add salt, cayenne, and lemon-juice to 
palate. Then put in the meat ; let it all boil gently about i an 
hour ; and if more wine be required, it must be boiled before 
being added to the soup. This is for a turtle of from 40 to 50 
lbs. It should, however, be recollected that the animal is of 
various weight — ^from a chicken-turtle of 40 lbs. to some cwts. 
— and the condiments must be apportioned accordingly. It 
should invariably be made the day before it is wanted,

HimD, to provide soup enough for a moderate party, as it will 
fill a tureen of 2 quarts ; but it must be fresh and unstripped 
of the skin, which is the most gelatinous part. 

Take out the brains ; clean the head carefully in Iwt water, 
by squeezing it with the hand to press out the blood, and leave 
it afterwards for an hour in co!d water. Then put it into 5 
or 6 quarts of warm water along' with 2 lbs. of veal, 2 lbs. of 
delicate pickled pork, chiefly fat, a roasted onion or two stuck 
fill! of cloves, aud the tliinly pared rind of a lemon, tog^ether 
with a large bundle of savoury pot-herbs, 2 sliced carrots, and 
a head of celery. Let this boil for 2 hours : then take up the 
head and the pork. The head must be stripped of its skin, 
and the brain, tongue, and eye taken out ; let the bones of 
the head be broken and returned to the soup, and boU 2 hours 
longer- — the brains being' made into forcemeat balls, the 
tongue skiiine<i and sliced ; the black part of the eye should 
abo be taken out, and tlie remainder minced ; the skiu b^g 
cut into pieces of little more than an inch square. While the 
slock is boiling, put into a saucepan a email quantity of fresh 
butter, with some onions sliced thin, a little basQ, marjoram, 
and parsley, a very small quantity of thyme, 3 bay-leaves, 
2 blades of mace, a few allspice : f:wi'al all these well over tiie 
fire ; when done, add sufficient flour to thicken the soup. Stir in 
the boiling stock by degrees to avoid its being lumpy ; let it 
bofl gently for an hour, then rab it through a tammy, set it 
<ffer the fire ; when it boils add the meat. About 10 minutes 
before you serve, season the soup to your taste with salt, a. 
naaD quantity of cayenne pepper, a couple of spoonfuls of soy, 
a good squeeze of lemon-juice, together with nearly a pint of 
cnlier Madeira or sherry. Serve with 2 lemons upon a plate, 
cot in half, as some people like the soup to be somewhat add. 
HnshnXHUe ore sometimes added. 

The soup will take at least 7 or 8 hours in preparatlcat. A 
calTs head requires half its own wei^t of meat to make the- 
tvoth of proper quality.

or 2 calTs feot, 2 onions, a few cloves, peppers, berries of all'

a thick papOT over the pan, and set it in an oven for 3 hours.

into bits H inch square ; remove the bones and coarse parts ; 
and then put the rest on to wann, with a large spoonful of 
walnut and one of mushroom ketchup, half a pint of sherry or 
Madeira wine, a little mushroom-powder, and the jelly of the 
meat. When hot, if it wants any more seasoning, add some ; 
and serve with hard eggs, forcemeat balls, a squeeze of lemon, 
and a spoonful of soy. 
This is a very easy way, and the dish is excellent. 

NEAT 8 FEET SOUP, 

37. — ^Take 2 neat's feet, cut them as you do a calf s head : 
take 5 pints of any sort of broth, the juice and rind of 1 lemon, 
some parsley and herbs chopped fine ; send these to the oven ; 
when it comes from the oven, put in a pint of strong gravy 
and a cup of white wine, some hard eggs and forcemeat balls ; 
season with cayenne pepper and salt. 

To these an excellent addition will be found in 1 lb. of the 
belly part of very delicate pickled pork ; for it will improve 
the flavour of the soup, and, if cut neatly into bits, will taste 
nearly as rich, and quite as savoury, as the fat of the head, or 
the gelatinous parts of the feet. 

Any of these receipts for mock-turtle may be also made 
from pig's face and pettitoes ; and in most country-houses, as 
well as at sea — ^where pigs are generally kept for fresh meat 
— ^the head is commonly made into soup in imitation of turtle. 

It has become unfashionable among first-rate cooks to put 
those egg-halls^ formerly so common, into mock-turtle ; but as 
they are still used by those of the old school, we here add their 
mode of preparation : — 

Take out the yolks of some hard-boiled eggs, and beat them 
in a mortar with a very Uttle salt and dyeAne, and make 
them into a paste with the white of a raw egg. Roll the paste 
into balls not larger than marbles, put them into the soup, and 
boil for 10 minutes. 

MULL A GA TA WNEE, 

38. — Slice some onions and a few shalots, put them in a

dessert-spoonfrils of curry-powder, a little cayenne pepper and 
salt; cut up some India pickle, which pound well with the 
other ingredients, add flour suflicient to thicken the soup, and 
a little cold stock to work the whole into a stiff paste. When

Or: — BcSlf m a gallon of water, 4 lbs. of the shank-end 
of a kmidde of Teal, along with the bones of a fowl, the flesh 
of wliidi has been stripped off and skinned. When half or 
nearly dcme, cat off as much of the meat as may be wanted for 
makii^ tiie broth, putting aside the glutinous parts of the shank, 
and letting the remainder stew untu the whole of its gravy has 
been extracted. When tiiat is done, skim and strain it ; firy, 
in butter, 4 onicms sliced and floured ; mince the flesh of the 
fowl and knuckle — not too small ; add 2 dessert-spoonfuls of 
euny-powder, with salt and a little cayenne; let the whole 
snmner together for another hour, and when ready for table 
season die soap with lanon-juice or a wine-glass cdT Madeira, 
and serve it wHh boiled rice. 

MUTTON MULL A GA TA WNEE, 

99- — Take 4 lbs. of the scrag end of a nedc of mutton; cut 
off the lean meat in small pieces, boil the remainder and the 
bones well in 3 quarts of water, with a bunch of sweet herbs, 
parsley, mace, and 2 onions ; strain it and carefully take off the 
&t ; put the pieces of lean mutton into a stewpan with 2 table- 
qpoooiuls of curry-powder, pepper, salt, and a little butter ; 
let it simmer gendy till the gravy is drawn, then add to it the 
soap from the bones ; boil them together till the meat is ten-* 
der, thicken the soup with a little ground rice till a little 
thicker than cream ; if not seasoned enough add a little more 
curry-powder to the thickening ; boil it ^ an hour more, and 
it is i^uiy to serve. Send with it a dish of boiled rice. 

The rice is sometimes pulped through a sieve to thicken it, 
but is- most usually sent up separately, and in its whole state, 
for each person to use it or not, as they think proper. Green 
peas are also occasionally used for the same purpose, as a 
substitute for the dhaly with wiiich, in India, this soup is fre- 
quently thickened. 

Throughout Germany, soups made of wine and beer are 
very common, as they can be made at a moment in the follow- 
ing manner: — 



W MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VH. 

40. — Take a pint of white wine, and H pint of water, 
sweeten it to the taste with white sugar, fry one large table- 
spoonful of flour with a piece of butter until it is very brown, 
then pour the wine and water upon it, and boil it a few minutes 
with lemon-peel and cinnamon. Then take the yolks of 6 
eggs, beat them well and add the boiling soup very slowly, 
stirring it well all the time that it may not curdle ; put a litde 
toasted bread, cut very fine, into the soup, and serve it up hot. 



VEGETABLE SOUPS. 

Although many of the following soups are made purely of 
vegetables, yet some — and those generally the best — are inade 
on a foundation of some sort of meat-broth in which the roots 
are stewed. The broth is therefore the real stock on which 
these soups are made, though each bears the name of the 
vegetable which gives it flavour ; but when made solely from 
herbs, roots, and vegetables, and used as a basis for the forma- 
tion of soupes-maigres, the stock is then composed of every 
sort in season which can, by long stewing, be reduced to a 
pulp, in which every species of savoury herb — such as chervil, 
tarragon, and marjoram — are mixed, together with a few chilis, 
shalots, and a head of garlic, seasoned with mace, whole pep- 
pers, salt, and mushroom ketchup ; to which may be added a 
little curry-powder. The pulp is then strained; and, being 
thus rather highly seasoned, may be kept for a few days, and 
used in aid of any other soup. It must be left to simmer during 
several hours ; and should it need browning, some sliced onions, 
fried in butter, will be all that is necessary. 

It should be observed that all soups, whether of fish or v^e- 
tables, which are made without any intermixture of meat-broth; 
are strictly maigre, and will be treated of under that head. 

FRIED OR SPLIT-PEA 80UP.—E.R. 

41. — The liquor in which a leg of mutton or 4^ a calf's 
head has been boiled will make an excellent stock for this 
soup ; but if that of pork be used, and it be much salted, part 
of the liquor should be thrown away and the remainder mixed 
with fresh water. Put on the stock to boil, slice into it a head 
of celery, a carrot and turnip, with 2 onions ; boil a sufficient 
quantity of peas in fresh water, putting them in dry and 
when the water boils quickly ; when they will mash throw

Or : — Make a puree of peas boiled in a little broth, adding 
K lar^ onion ; pass it through a sieve ; reduce it to a propei' 
Hiickness with cold milk, add a deBsertspoonful of moist sugar, 
vitb pepper and salt to taste. It should be passed through the 
seve 2 or 3 times to make it quite smooth. On shipboard, and 
ia many country-houses, it is not unusual to cut some of the 
boiled pork into very small bits, and serve them up either 
separately or mixed in the soup. Fried onions will add mucK; 
to its flavour if added to the broth of which the soup is made. 

OBEEN-PEA SOVP^E. B, -^ 

4SL — ^Boil in salt mter, over & slow fire, a quart of freshly 
gathered large g^«en peas, witb a handfiil of parsley, sorrelK 
and ■ few duves, until they become thoroughly stewed ; draio, 
and poood them in the mortar until made into a pur^, which

coif wi& poppa and salt ; but if of veal, with maoe aad a 
i«ij little icnned sngar. Have ready wcane leeka and lettuce. 
tiiat have been boilea, but not to a pulp, and fry them in but- 
ter along with some nicely-fried slices of bread cut into dice, 
putting them into the soup just before sending it up, and adding 
a few beads of boiled aspara^^us when in season ; or if not, hop- 
topa are a tolerable substitute. Chopped mint is also served 
alon^ with pea-soup. 

1^ sorrel will give a very delicate flavour of acidity to the 
soup ; but care should be taken never to acquire this flavour by 
adding vin^;ar to any kind of pea, lentO, or farinaceous pulse 
soup, as it will occasion it to curdle. 

Or: — Take 3 cabbage lettuces, 3 ouiona, a pint of young 
peas, ^ lb. of butter, a uggot of mint, pepper and salt to taste ; 
cut these into small pieces, and stew tiiem till tender. Take 
3 pints of old peas to 5 pints of water, boil them till quite soil ; 
nib them through a sieve ; add this to the above ingredients ; 
let it boil up, and then serve. 

Or:- — Take a peck of green peas, and, in shelling them, 
separate the old from the young ; boil the former portion until 
they are quite tender, and, if not sufficiently sweet, addasmall

neve, return them to the stocdc, and let them stew gently toge-

ther. The great object in making these soups is to t&adfsr 
them perfectly smooUi ; for should the least grittiness appear, 
it will entirely destroy their goodness. Put in the young peds 
just time enough before the soup is served to allow them to be 
properly cooked; artichoke bottoms or cucumbers may be 
added with advantage : pare a couple of cucumbers, cut than 
in pieces, take Out the seeds, dry them in a cloth, flour, and 
fiy them of a light brown, and serve them up with the soup as 
it goes to table. The soup may be made of any sort of broth. 
A small quantity of carbonate of soda, or a little spinach boiled 
soft and pulped with the peas, will keep the soup green ; but 
the soda should be sparingly used. 

It is customary to serve up with all kinds of pea-soup, and 
frequently with those purees made of vegetables, some slices of 
bread cut into very small square bits, and not merely toasted, 
hnt fried in butter imtil browned, but served separately, and 
seldom put into the soup. 

LE^TXL-SOUF. 

43. — ^The lentils are made into 2i,puriey and seasoned in the 
same manner as in white or dried pea-soup, but should always 
be made of veal-broth, and the pulse boiled long enough to ex- 
tract the scarlet colour, which gives it a good appearance j for 
its flavour is much the same as that of soup made of peas. 

80UFJE A LA JULIENNE, 

44. — Cut various kinds of vegetables in pieces, either sliced 
or of the size of dice, 1 head of celery, carrots, turnips, leeks, 
and the hearts of lettuce, 2 each, with a dozen of small button 
onions pared very carefully to preserve their shape; then, 
having put 2 oz. of butter in the bottom of a stewpan, put 
the vegetables on the top of the butter, together with any 
others that may be in season ; more particularly heads of aspa- 
ragus, and likewise a little sorrel to impart a slight flavour of 
acidity, together with a lump of sugar to prevent any bitter- 
ness of taste. Stew or fry them over a slow fire, keeping than 
stirred, and adding a little gravy occasionally; soak small 
pieces of crust of bread about the size of shillings in the remain- 
der of the broth or stock, and, when the vegetables are nearly 
stewed, add them, and warm the whole up together in the ne- 
cessary quantity of beef or veal broth ; beef being the most 
savoury, but veal being, in sunmier, thought l£e lightest

Althoogh this may. be made at any time of the year, yet, 
being chiSy oom.po6ed of vegetables, it is more distinctively 
a spring soup ; but if made in winter, the v^^tables should 
be only stewed ; for> if fried, the flavour of the soup would be 
unpleasantly strong. ' It is a universal Parisian dish, and has 
lately oome into very general use, as a species of saupe sanU^ 
at fitthionahle Engliiah tables. 

SOUPE A LA FLAMANDE. 

46. — ^Take of carrots, turnips, and onions of a large size, 
2 of eodi ; a small quantity of lettuce, leeks, chervil, and en- 
dive. Slued than in pieces, and put them in a stewpan with 
a small piece of butter and a teacupful of gravy ; set them over 
a slow fbre, and let them be frequently shaken in the pan while 
stewing, until they become tender ; then add a quart (^any sort 
of broth, and let it all stew gently for an hour, seasoning it with 
ash, a small quantity of mace, a little sugar, and only a pinch 
of cayenne. Mix thoroughly the yolks of 3 eggs with 4- pint 
of cream, and add them to the soup the last thing before you 
serve it up. Keep stirring it after the eggs are in, until it 
almost boils, htU not quite. 

Or: — Wash, peel, and slice 12 potatoes and 6 onions, cut 
6 or 8 heads of celery into small pieces ; put these into a stew- 
pan with i lb. of butter and about a pint of water ; let them 
simmer 1 hour ; fill up the pan with a good stock ; let it boil 
till the potatoes are dissolved ; rub it through a sieve ; add a 
pint of cream.

stick of celery, and a root of parsley, with a blade of mace, a few 
aUspice, and a few sprigs of parsley and thyme ; put them all 
into a stewpan, with a piece of butter. Let it simmer for \ an 
hour, stirring occasionally ; then fill it up with stock, allowing 
it to boil gently 2 hours ; then put in the crumbs of 2 French 
rolls ; when well soaked, rub the whole through a tamis. Let 
it boil up ; skim it well ; add salt if required, and a small lump 
of sugar. Have a little rice ready boiled, and serve it up in 
the tureen.

CABBOT SOUP. 

47. — Take 6 or 8 full-grown carrots, of the red sort, scrape 
them clean, and rasp only the otUer rind^ or soft red part, and 
if you have a single ripe tomata, add it, sliced, to the raspings, 
but use no other vegetable except onions. While this is doing, 
the broth of any kind of fresh meat which has been got ready 
should be heated and seasoned with a couple of onions fried in 
butter, but without pepper, or any other kind of seasoning, ex- 
cept a small quantity of mace and a little salt. When IJI is 
ready, put the raspings into 2 quarts of the skinmied broth, 
cover the stewpan close, and let it simmer by the side of the 
fire for 2 or 3 hours, by which time the raspings will have 
become soft enough to be pulped through a fine sieve : after 
which the soup should be boiled imtil it is as smooth as jelly, 
for any curdly appearance will spoil it. 

Thus all the roots and most of such vegetables as can be 
easily made into purees^ and combined with any sort of broth, 
will, in this manner, make excellent soup of different denomi- 
nations, though all founded upon the same meat-stock. The 
gravy of beef is always preferred for savoury soups, and that 
of veal or fowls for the more delicate white soups : to which 
from \ a pint to a pint of cream, or, if that cannot be had, the 
same quantity of milk and the yolks of a couple of raw eggs, 
should be added for every 2 quarts of soup ; remembering, 
however, that the latter will not impart the richness of cream« 

Parsnip Soup is made in the same way as that of car- 
rots ; only that the whole of the root is used, and it requires 
either another tomato or a spoonful of chili vinegar to check 
its rather mawkish sweetness. 

Vegetable Marrow, — Sometimes thickened with arrowroot 
and cream, flavoured with almond-powder ; and occasionally 
coloured with a small quantity of saffron, which, to some 
palates, adds an agreeable flavour. The soup must not be 
allowed to boil after the cream is put into it, or it would be 
likely to make it curdle. 

PALESTINE SOUP. 

48. — 'Take 2 or 3 dozen of Jerusalem artichokes according 
to their size, pare and slice them into a pan of water ; then 
»drain, and put them into a 3-quart stewpan with a little butter, 
a good piece of ham, a blade of mace, 3 onions sliced thin, and

Ihe white part of 2 heads of celery. Let them 3tew for an 
hour ; f heo fill up the sten'iian with white veal broth, aud add 
the cnirab of 2 French rolls. Let it slew till soft enough to 
be passed througli the taiuis. Return it into the atewpan, boil 
it up, akim well, add suit and sugar to palate, and put ^ pint 
of hot cream in the tureen when aeiit to table: add CTOutons 
of fried bread. 

Turnip A'o«p.^Proceed as for Palestine soup ; either veal 
or mutton broth may be employed. 

LEEK OR OXION SOUP. 

49. — ^Theliquor in which a leg^ of mutton has been boiled will 
do very well for this broth. Mix a spoonful or two of oatmeal, 
according io the quantity of broth, in cold water, very smooth, 
tiie same as if for gruel, add a little of the broth, by degrees, 
nntil the whole is incorporated ; then boil the liquor with any 
quantity of leeks or ouions — both or either — until it becomes 
of the consistence of cream. Or, omit the oatmeal, and sub- 
Btitute flour, stirrii^ the soup very hard for S minutes ; and 
wiien you are about takiiig it Irani the tire, stir in the yolks of 
2 raw e^^ beat up with a little more broth, aud serve it 
immediately. 

Onions, peeled, pared, and cut into pieces, then shred into 
a pan and fried in either oil or butter, without any broth, but 
limply having boiling water poured over them, and some 
Unsted bread, seasoned merely with pepper and salt, are con- 
tndered very refreshing when thus made into a soup, and much 
tued by ladies throughout the Continent afW the fatigues of a 
bolL 

TOUATA SOUP. 

60. — Cut up 2 onions and fry them in butter ; when the 
oiwnu are brown, add to them a dozen tomatas, from which 
you have squeezed the water, and then proceed as for Cicci 
soup. A moderate quantity of tomata pulped or shredded, 
mixed up with any of the v^etable soups, will be generally 
found an improvement, as it imparls a delicacy of colour aim 
a pleasing addity of flavour. 

CELEBYSOUP. 
61. — Blanch the heads in warm water, and put them into a 
stewpan with veal bi<oth and a lump of sugai -, boQ. t^iem Ssa.

an hour or two until soft enough to be either pulped through a 
sieve and thickened with cream, or eaten in the manner of a 
Stew. A little cayenne may be added, but without any addi- 
tion of either potherbs or pungent sauces. 

ARTICHOKE SOUP. 

62. — Clean the bottoms from the leaves and chokes, and 
put them to soak for \ an hour in a small quantity of milk ; then 
stew them gently with a piece of butter kneaded in flour. When 
sufficiently tender, take them out and mash them ; rub them 
through a hair sieve, and let them afterwards simmer over a 
gentle fire ; add a bunch of young onions, some thyme, and a 
little parsley. When nearly done, pound in a mortar 2 oz. of 
blanched sweet almonds, the yolks of 4 eggs, and a spoonful 
of white sugar ; put them to a couple of quarts of veal broth, 
and season it to your taste with salt and cayenne peppar : set 
it on the fire for a few minutes before serving. Or, into a rich 
stock, made of knuckle of veal, beef-bones, &c., with a little 
carrot and celery, pepper or chilis, cut several artichokes, and 
put them in a saucepan with a little of the stock ; letting them 
boil very gwitly until quite tender. Then put them through 
a sieve, mix them by degrees in as much cream as will thicken 
the soup, add the stock, and warm all together without 
boiling it. 

ASPARAGUS SOUP. 

63. — ^Take 2 quarts of good beef or veal broth : put to it 
4 onions, 2 or 3 turnips, and some sweet herbs, with the white 
parts of a hundred of young asparagus ; but, if old, or very 
large in the stem, half that quantity will do, and let them all 
simmer till sufficiently tender to be rubbed through a tamis, 
which is not an easy matter if they be not very young. Then 
strain and season it ; have ready the boiled tops which have 
been cut from the stems, and add them to the soup. 

Or : — Poach half a dozen eggs rather hard, have ready a 
hundred of asparagus heads boiled tender ; boil 3 quarts of 
clear gravy soup ; put into it for a minute or two a fowl 
just roasted ; then add a few tarragon leaves ; season with a 
little salt ; put the eggs and asparagus heads quite hot into 
the tureen, and pour the soup over them without breaking 
them. The fowl will be just as good as before for made 
dishes. 



VEGETABLE SOUPS. 



SPRING SOUPS. 



54, — Take any or all sorts of green vegetables, sea-kale, 
asparagus tops, green peas, spinach, lettuce, and sorrel, with 
mustard and cress, chives, and yooDg onions, to which gher- 
kins, cucumbers, and green capsicums may be added a^ the 
season advances. Stew them in any kind of good broth, either 
until they can be Riade into apur^e, which is by far the mtwt 
approved mode for company ; or for family fare they may be 
chopped small, and left in the soup, but not boiled quite so 
much as when meant to be pulped. 

THICK SPfl/,VC SOUP. 

55. — Have ready washed and picked a bmich of spring 
onions, some carrots, lettuces, chervil, spinach, parsley, thyme, 
sorrel, mint, and asparagus ; put them in a stewpan, with a 
slice of butter ; let it sweat for j- an hour on a brisk fire, stir- 
ling it occasicmally ; have ready some French rolls that have 
been previously soaked in water and squeezed dry, sufficient 
to thicken the soup ; throw in also a few mushroom trimmings, 
fill it up with good broth made of any kind of meat; bring it 
up to the boil, skim, and pass it througJi a tammy : season with 
D little salt and sugar ; garnish with asparagus points or crou- 
tons : it should be very green. Or, if it be a jour maiffre, the 
hjfAh must be omitted, and butter, with flour and curry-powder, 
be added. 

VEGETABLE SOUP. 

96. — ^Take 2 cucumbers, 12 or 14 onions, 3 potatoes, 1 let- 
tuce, 1 head of white cabbage ; fiy these together in butter, 
stew tfaem 3 or 4 hours in 3 pints of stock ; add a little green 
nunt, parsley, and a pint of green peas ; let it stew for 2 hours 
more ; press it through a sieve, and thicken it with flour and 

WINTEB VEGETABLE SOUPS. 

57. — Take carrots, tumipe, and the heart of a head of 
celery, cut into dice, with a dozen button onions ; half boil 
them in salt and water, with a little si^or in it; then throw 
them into the broth ; and, when tender, serve up the soup: or 
use rice, dried peas and lentils, and pulp them into the soup to 
thicken it. 

With many of these soups, small suet dumplings, verj

lightly made, and not larger than an egg, are boiled either in 
broth or water, and put into the tureen just before serving, and 
are by most persons thought an improvement, but are more 
usually put into plain gravy-soup thieui any other, and should 
be made light enough t6 swim in it. 

Such are the chief soups made of v^etables on a foundation 
of meat ; both those made solely of vegetables, without any 
intermixture of meat broth, may be made into very palatable 
soups by using the vegetable stock, as already stated. 

Soupe a la Julienne^ and all those French soups of which 
we have given receipts, may also be made maigre by substi- 
tuting vegetable stock for meat broth ; or even making them 
of merely boiling water, but thickening them with butter, flour, 
and milk, or the yolks of eggs, and seasoning them rather 
highly, as they require more excitement on the palate than 
when made with meat ; as well as those which we have named 

as purees,

FISH SOUPS. 

Notwithstanding the quantity of excellent fish suited to 
the purpose with which English markets are supplied, this 
nutritious, elegant, and economical viand is not often intro- 
duced at table in the form of soup. Nothing could be more 
easy than to multiply receipts for an almost endless variety : 
those that follow will, however, show how much may be done 
with many kinds of fish which are not in very high esti- 
mation. 

When not wanted as soupe-maigre, the foundation, or stock, 
though called " fish-soup," is always better if made of meat, 
and veal is generally preferred. We, therefore, here add a 
receipt for its composition, as it may be applied to any kind of 
fish ; though, in those which we shall hereafter specify, it is 
not mentioned, as they are all intended to be maigre, 

STOCK FOB FISH SOUP. 

68. — Take a dozen of flounders, or any small flat fish, and 
the same number of perch ; gut and clean them carefully ; put 
them into a stewpan with 2 quarts of strong veal-broth ; add a 
few slices of lean ham, 2 or 3 carrots, celery, and onions cut 
in slices, some sweet herbs and salt, with a little cayenne ; 
stew till the fish will pass through a coarse sieve ; then return 



Cbap. Vn.] FISH SOUPS. ' 103 

it into the stewpan, with a good lump of butter and some flour 
to thicken it ; add a oouple of large glasses of white wine, and 
a large spoonfid of garlic vinegar. The gravy from potted 
herrings, anofaovieBy or a little Oude sauce, will also improve 
the flavour. 

This stock, if once rdl)oiled, will, in cold weather, keep well 
far a month ; or, if served as soup, the quantity may of course 
be reduced according to the nuinber of the party intended to 
partake of it, and it will be found excellent. Indeed, any 
species of fish may be made into soup in the same manner. 
If meant to be Irownedy the onions should be fried, and a 
good spoonful of mushroom ketchup or India soy be added ; 
and red wine will be better than either sherry or Madeira. 
But if left whUe^ cream should be substituted for ketchup and 
soy; a glassful of ginger-wine will answer the purpose of red 
wine. 

Stock JbrFUh Sm^'Maigre, — ^Take 1 lb. of skate, 4 or 5 
flounders, and 2 lbs. of eels. Clean them well, and cut them 
into pieces ; cover them with water, and season them with 
mace, p^per, salt, an onion stuck with cloves, a head of 
celery, 2 parsley-roots sliced, and a bunch of sweet herbs. 
Simmer H hour, closely covered, and then strain it off for 
use. If for brown soup, first fry the fish brown in butter, and 
then do as above. It will not keep more than 2 or 3 days. 

In making this stock it should also be observed, that the 
bones of the fish are what constitute its best part ; for if stewed 
down in a digester, they will become a jelly of a very rich 
nature, which may be applied to many sorts of soups and 
sauces. The bones of large fish — salmon, cod, soles, and 
turbot — are never taken from the dish on which they are 
served ; and therefore should always be returned to the stock- 
pot ; or any remains and trimmings of the fish may be used. 
Add to this a carrot and an onion or two, and let the whole 
stew until dissolved. 

To thicken or enrich white or fish soups, it is a good way to 
pour them, boiling hot, on the beaten yolks of 2 or 3 fresh 

FISH SOUPE'MAIGBE. 

59. — ^For a party of a dozen, clean and nicely wash 1 lb. 
each of dace, roach, or any common fish ; stew them with as 
many large carrots, half the number of lettuces, a handful of 
leeks, 4 onions, and a handful of sorrel, in as much water as 



104 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VH. 

will cover them, untO the whole are done to a mash ; strain it 
through a coarse cloth, and boil the liquor, closely covered, 1 
hour. £[ave ready some of the above-mentioned vegetables, 
cut small ; flour, and boil them in butter, and simmer them in 
the soup i an hour with pepper, salt, and a few cloves. 
Soften a rasped French roll in good broth, and, having mixed 
the yolks of 6 fresh eggs with a few crumbs, stir them into the 
soup, and pour the whole over the roll. 

Or : — ^Have ready the pulp of old or fresh peas ; and add 
them, and as much of the water that boiled them, with 4 oz. of 
butter, pepper, and salt, as will make the soup of a proper 
consistence. Stir often, and boil till ready to serve. 

RA Y OR SKA TE 80 UP. 

60. — This fish contains a number of small bones, surround- 
ing the pectoral fins, which are so delicate as to be easily con- 
verted into a jelly, and therefore well adapted for the making 
of soup. 

Make it of the stock directed for fish soup, with 1 oz. of 
vermicelli boiled in it a little before it is served. Then add 
i pint of cream, beaten with the yolks of 2 eggs. Stir it 
near, but not on, the fire. Serve it with a small French roll 
made hot in a Dutch oven, and then soaked in the soup an 
hour. 

Soup may, in like manner, be made of Thames flounders, 
plaice, or any of the flat fish. 

CODLING AND HADDOCK SOUP. 

61. — Take the meat from a codling, pound it in a mortar 
with i pint of shrimps shelled; shred some parsley, and 
pound the whole with the crumb of a roll previously soaked in 
milk ; make the mixture up into balls with an e^ ; season with 
mace and pepper ; and stew down 2 or 3 codlings or haddocks 
into good broth ; strain it, take out the meat, pulp it through 
a sieve, boil it with parsley-roots, thicken the soup, and send 
it up with the forcemeat-balls. 

A Cocts'head also forms an admirable soup ; but in London 
and other great towns they are too expensive to be thus used. 
Halibut is, however, cheap, and good soup may be made from 
it ; as also from hake and ling^ which both bear an inferior 
price in our markets. 



FISH sonps- 



LOBSTER SOUP.~E. R. 



62. — If prepared fish-stock be not used, the stock of tiLs 
soup may be made of small codlings, eel», ptuice, fluimders, or 
any fish not of sufiicient consequence to be dressed in any 
other way. Clean and cut them in pieces, take the meat out 
of I or 2 lobsters, cut it into small but handsome pieces, and 
lay it aside ; break the shell and add it to the fish for the stock, 
which should be boiled gently for several hours; take the 
coral of the lobster, pound it in a mortar, with a small piece 
of the stock, portly pounded, and make it up into forcemeat- 
balls, with a little chopped parsley, bread-cnimba, and an e^. 
Wlien tbe stock is sufficiently done, strain it, thicken it with 
butter and flour, or cream ; warm the lobster in it, and send it 
up, cut small, with the forcemeat-balls. Season it also deli~ 
cately, but yet sufficiently to give it flavour, which can be 
impacted by any of the compound sauces so commonly adver- 
tised. If made of large lobsters, and sufficient for a party, it 
is, however, rather expensive, and can be made of the following, 
which ia equally good for the purpaae, and much cheaper, as 
being without the large claws of the lobster. 

CRAYFISH SOUP. 

63. — Take 50 crayfish ; pull out the gut which is attached 
to the centre fin of the tail, as it g^ves great bitterness to the 
soup ; boil them in salt and water until they are red ; pick the 
meat fiom the tails ; pound the bodies with i lb. of butter ; 
put this into a stewpan with 2 French rolls and some fish or 
meat stock ; boil for 1 hour ; rub through a tammy ; do not 
let it boil ; add the tails, and then serve. 

This fish, it should be observed, is the small Jresh-waler 
eraiffiih , but good soup can be made of large or small crabs, 
prawnt, and skrimpt ; the latter of which have much the best 
filaTour. They may, all or either, be made into soup alone ; 
or if mixed whole, or pounded into the puree of any other fish- 
soup, they will prove an excellent addition. Their shells and 
small claws may, indeed, be made into a paste by pounding 
them in a mortar with a lump of fresh butter, and putting the 
paste to stew mitil quite hot, when it must be strained and put 
into cold water, after which it may be potted and used fbr 
Tuious purposes. 



106 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VH. 

OYSTER SOUP, 

64. — Take 50 oysters, blanch them, but do not let them 
boil ; strain them through a sieve, and save the liquor. Put 
\ lb. of butter into a stewpan ; when it is melted, add 6 oz. of 
flour ; stir it over the fire for a few minutes ; add the liquor 
from the oysters, 2 quarts of veal stock, 1 quart of new milk ; 
season with salt, peppercorns, a little cayenne pepper, a blade 
of mace, Harvey sauce and essence of anchovies, a tablespoonful 
each ; strain it through a tammy ; let it boil 10 minutes ; put 
the oysters into the tureen with a gill of cream, and pour the 
boiling soup upon them. 

Or : — Take 2 quarts of fish-stock. Have ready a quart of 
oysters ; remove die beards and tough parts of the centre, and 
stew them in the stock ; beat the oysters in a mortar with the 
yolks of 6 hard-boiled eggs ; put this into the liquor taken 
from the stewed beards, let it sinuner for an hour, adding a 
large spoonful of essence of anchovy ; a little before serving 
put in i pint of cream ; after which the soup must not be 
suffered to boil. 

A more common plan is to take 2 large onions, and stick 
them with cloves, a very small bunch of sweet herbs, some 
whole black pepper, a blade of mace, and a hard crust of bread 
toasted a pale brown. Put all these into 3 quarts of water, 
and let it boil until reduced to 2 ; then strain it off". When 
tender, put all into your soup with 2 or 3 anchovies. Then 
take a couple of score of large oysters, or a half-hundred of 
Miltons, bearded, and let them be fried a pale brown ; put 
them and their liquor into the soup, and let them all boil 
together ;J of an hour. It will keep some days, and is better 
the second day than the first. 

Good soupe-maigre may also be made from clams, whilks, 
cockles, and even from that contemptible little shell-fish the 
periwinkle ; but if muscles be used, care should be taken to 
beard them, and take out the small crabs of which they form 
part, as they are thought to be poisonous. 

EEL SOUP. 

65. — Take 3 lbs. of small eels, and skin them ; bone 1 or 
2 ; cut them in very small pieces ; fry them very lightly in a 
stewpan with a bit of butter and a sprig of parsley. Put to 
the remainder 3 quarts of water, a crust of bread, 3 blades of 



Chap. VH.] FISH SOUPS. 107 

mace, some whole pepper, an onion, and a bunch of sweet 
herbs ; cover them close, and tttew till the fish breaks from 
the bones; then straiu it off; poimd it to a paate, and pass it 
tbrougli a sieve. Toast some bread, cut it into dice, and pour 
the soup on it boiling. Add the scollops of eel, and serve. 
The soup will be as rich as if made of nieat. i pint of 
cream, or milk, with a teaspoonful of flour rubb«d smooth in it, 
is a great improvement. 

To every pound of eels add a quart of water, and let the 
whole boil tUl one-half of the liquor is wasteil. The soup of 
cuDger eels is also said to be good, but the fish has not the 
riclmei9s of the fresh-water eel, and can only be recommended 
by its cbeapnesa. 

LAKE AND FOSD FISS SOUP. 

66.— For every person take a pound each of pike, perch, 
roach, dace, gudgeon, carp and tench, eels, or any fresh-water 
fish that can be obtained ; wash them in salt and water, and 
stew them with a tomata, carrots, leeks, fried onions, and sweet 
herbs, in as much water as will cover them ; and let them stew 
until tl:e whole is reduced to a pulp ; then strain the liquor, 
aod boil it for another hour until it becomes quite smooth. 
Then have ready some roots of any sort that may be in season, 
iriiich have been chopped small, and boiled cither in milk or 
"water: add them to the soup, and let it simmer for } of an 
hour i season it, if milk has been used, with mace and celery, 
with a little cayenne ; but if made solely with water, then use 
chili vinf^iar, soy, mushroom ketchup, or any of the savoury 
sauces. 

FISH SOUP AND STEW.-E. R. 

67. — Make the stock of any sort of fish, then take cutlets 
of sole, briU, gurnet, or any other fish, and stew them in the 
following manner : — Chop all kinds of sweet herbs, a small bit 
of garlic, or rub the board on which the herbs are chopped with 
garlic ; an onion or two, 3 carrots, and 2 or 3 turnips ; stew 
these for a few minutes in butt«r, then add one part wine to 
two of water, according to the quantity of fish, and the juice of 
■^ a lemcHi. Stew the marinade together for ^ of an hour, 
strain it, and, when cold, put in the flsh cutlets, and simmer 
them very gently until the liquor is reduced ; then add it to 
die first stock, thicken the soup with \ pint of cream, and 



108 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VE. 

send up the cutlets in a separate dish, covered either with a bat- 
ter made of flour, eggs, and milk ; or with a sauce made with 
a few spoonfuls of flour, with a little salt, olive-oil, and wine 
of any sort, heated in a pan, and seasoned. This will answer 
in a lall party for both^ and soup. 

TUR TLE 80 UP MAIGRE. 

68. — ^Having thus enumerated most of the cheap fish which 
may be made into soup, with the addition of v^etable and fish 
stock, we here add the present receipt, as being likely to form 
a superior kind of soupe-maigre ; for although always looked 
upon as a meat-soup, in consequence of its being made upon a 
foundation of veal-broth (which must be admitted to be in all 
cases the best stock as a basis for fish-soup), yet the turtle, 
though amphibious, and laying its numerous ^gs upon the land, 
where they are buried in the sand, and engendered by the heat 
of the sun, has ever been ranked among the race offish, as living 
chiefly in the sea ; and as arrangements have, it seems, been 
made for killing the animals in ^e West Indies, and bringing 
over, in jars, the flesh, which comes here in a state of jelly, this 
only needs to be stew^ up in a broth of vegetable or fish stock, 
instead of meat, and in such quantity as to make the jelly sufi&- 
ciently limpid for soup : seasoning it in the same manner as 
the other receipt; but adding a rather larger proportion of 
curry-powder and a few truflfles to correct the vapidity of the 
fish and vegetable broth; but the process of preparing the 
turtle must be altered, as it is at present prepared with an acid 
which no boiling will remove. 



SOUPES MAIGRE. 

69. — Pare and slice 5 or 6 cucumbers ; and add to these 
the inside of as many cos-lettuces, a sprig or two of mint, 2 or 
3 onions, some pepper and salt, a pint and a half of young peas, 
and a little parsley. Put these, with -J- lb. of fresh butter, into 
a saucepan, to stew in their own liquor, near a gentle fire, -J- an 
hour ; then pour 2 quarts of boiling water to the vegetables, 
and stew them 2 hours ; rub down a little flour into a teacupful 
of water, boil it with the rest 15 or 20 minutes, and serve it. 

Or : — Peel and slice 6 large onions, 6 potatoes, 6 carrots, 
and 4 turnips ; fry them in ^ lb. of butter, and pour on them 



Chap. TIL] SOUPES MAIGRE. 109 

4 qnartB of boiling water. Toast a crust of bread as brown 
and hard as "pomblej but do not bum it ; put it with some celery, 
sweet hBrbBy lAdie pepper, and salt to Ihe above; stew it all 
gentlj 4 hcHUB, thai strain it through a coarse cloth: have 
ready sliced carrot, celery, and a little turnip, and stew them 
tender in the soup. K approved, add an anchovy and a spoon- 
ful of ketchup, with toasted bread, or the crumb of a French 
ndl, eat in slices, at the bottom of the tureen. 

Or : — One gaUon of water, a very large soup-plate of car- 
rots, turnips, and onions, with celery cut small, and all £ried 
in either butter or dripping (though, if not a fast day, dripping 
is best), sufficient to brown it, but doing it slowly, and stirring 
it £pequently to prevent its burning. Add 1 tablespoonful of 
floor to thidLcn it, and another of ketchup to flavour it ; and if 
joo can get a tomata and a green capsicum, put them in also, 
with pqpper and salt to season it. Let it stew for full 8 hours, 
or untfl ibe quantity has been reduced to one half, when it will 
be quite sufficient for 6 or 8 people, at the cost cf little more, 
if iomiidb, as Is* 

PEASE-PORRIDGE,— E, R. 

70. — ^Fry a couple of onions and a stick of celery, and put 
them, with a bundle of sweet herbs, a couple of anchovies, or 
\ a red herring, into 3 quarts of water, with a crust of bread, 
floured, pepper and salt ; boil all together very gently until the 
flavour is extracted from the herbs; then skim the liquor, 
and strain it. Add a pound of raw potatoes grated, and a pint 
of split peas ; when the peas are soft, beat them through a sieve 
with the soup, and if the porridge should not be thick enough, 
add a little flour and butter. Cut half a dozen leeks into pieces, 
and, after the peas have been beaten, boil them in the soup, 
and send them to table. 

SPLIT PEA-SO UP MAIGRE.— E. R. 

71. — To a quart of whole or split peas put 3 quarts of 
water ; boil gently until the peas are dissolved, then pulp them 
through a sieve, and add 3 anchovies or a red herring, carrots, 
turnips, leeks, thyme, and sweet marjoram, and stew them 
togetiier. Before serving, add some ketchup and salt, thicken 
the soup with butter, and send it up with fried bread. Frying 
the br^ui will make the soup richer. The addition of mush- 
room-ketchup will partly give it the flavour of meat. 



110 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. Vll. 

GREEN PEA-SOUF MAIGRE.—E. R. 

72. — ^Take 5 or 6 cucumbers, pared and sliced, the white 
part of as many cos-lettuces, a sprig or two of mint, 2 or 3 
onions, some pepper and salt, a full pint of young peas, a little 
parsley, and -J- lb. of butter. Put them all together in a sauce- 
pan to stew in their own liquor for an hour and a half, or until 
they are quite tender ; then boil as many old peas, pulp them 
through a colander, and mix in a quart of the liquor or more, 
according to the thickness which may be desirable : when the 
herbs are stewed put them in, and serve up. This soup will 
be found excellent. 

Or : — As used in Italy, — ^Boil a quart of full-grown peas 
in \ gallon of water until tender enough to pulp through a 
coarse sieve ; then put the pulp, a cos-lettuce, 2 good-^zed 
cucumbers sliced, and a pint of young peas, into the liquor. 
Stew gently, until the vegetables become extremely tender ; 
then add pepper and salt to your taste, chopped mint, and 2 oz. 
of butter rubbed in a spoonful of flour, and boil 10 minutes. 

A more elaborate method, — Slice a French roll, and boil it 
in 6 quarts of water until it is perfectly dissolved ; take all the 
old peas found in a peck and a half, keeping the young ones 
separate ; boil the old peas with the bread and water, and when 
tender strain them; reserve the water, and pulp the peas 
through a sieve, putting them by for the present; boil the 
young peas, with a sprig of mmt, a little mace and pepper, in 
the strained soup, and while they are simmering put -J- lb. of 
butter into a frying-pan, and when it boils cut in 2 lettuces, 2 
handfuls of young spinach, a little parsley chopped, a dozen of 
small silver onions, and 2 cucumbers cut in slices. After stew- 
ing for some time, add a large tablespoonful of flour, the pulped 
peas, and then that which has the young peas in it, simmering 
the whole together for 10 minutes. 

POTATO SOUP MAIGRE. 

73. — Take some large mealy potatoes ; peel and cut them 
into small slices, with an onion ; boil them in 3 pints of water 
till tender, and then pulp them through a colander; add a 
small piece of butter, a Uttle cayenne pepper and salt, and, 
just before the soup is served, 2 spoonfuls of good cream. The 
soup must not be allowed to boil aft;er the cream has been put 
into it.

of lemon may be added.

BEEF. 



Beef is dressed in various ways all the year round ; but, for 
roasting, the best season is from November to the end of March. 
For joints, the only really good roasting pieces are the sir- 
loin and the long ribs ; the short ribs, which are cut near the 
neck, never roast well, and should not be used for this pur- 
pose ; the middle ribs are the best. The under part, or fillet^ 
of the sirloin, if cut out, may be made into a delicious stew ; 
or, if cut crosswise into steaks, they will be found more tender 
than those of the rump. 

Some persons divide the round, and roast the half called the 
upper side, which in young beef is tender and full of gravy. 
The silver side should be salted, bemg one of the best boiling 
pieces in the ox. The aitch-bone, although almost invariably 
salted and boiled, yet, if roasted when fresh, makes perhaps the 
richest gravy of any part of the ox ; but, when cold, is not so 
good as if salted. 

Beef requires to be hung a long time, in ordef to ensure its 
being tender. When, however, the weather is not favourable 
for keeping, it will be much improved by being laid for a few 
hours previous to roasting in a marinade of this kind — ^three 
parts water to one of vinegar, some salt, with a few pepper- 
corns. Each joint must be carefully examined before it is 
spitted, and any portions that may have been injured cut away. 

In Scotland, meat of every sort is preserved by covering it 
completely with oatmeal, taking it out every day, wiping it, 
and then replacing it in the meal ; and should it appear at all 
tainted, it is soaked for some hours in oatmeal and water before 
being dressed: or strewing over it some coarsely-powdered 
charcoal will materially assist in its preservation.

and !il=o the strong sineiF or leather; &±teD the " bark," at 
out'iide f&t, with a faw skewers ; spit it through the thick part 
and the point of the ribs. Wheo one or two rile are purchased 
b; a small family, it is a, g-ood plan to liave tlie bones taken 
out, and the meat roiled round in the shape of a fillet ; a con- 
siderable saving is effeeted by this pian, ^'i, when not «o pre- 
pared, the thio put at tlie aitwaatj at the bone ■ fKipeaOj

TO COLLAR BIBS OP BBEF. 
.17. — Taitd 2 er 3 ribs of beef; cnt it from the bones ; nb 
It well with salt, brown sngar, mad nl^i^re ; let it ronain a 
firlnj^it, taming it every daj ; tlien season it with pqifwr,

eo««r it well with paidey, thyi»e,.aBd sweet in a quraa ; nfl 
it op very tigfat, and bind it round with tape; pot it into a 
pot with some water, cover it close up, and send it to the oven 
to be baked very slowly 3 or 4 hours ; then take it out, and 
press it between 2 bouds with wei^ts. This b an excellent 
dish for luncheon or breakiast. 

A Marinade to baite Roatt MeaU. — Chop up «ome bt 
bacon with a clove of garlic and a sprig of parsley ; add salt, 
pepper, a spoonful of vinegar, and 4 spoonfuls of oil ; beat it 
np well, and baste the meat with it 

SIRLOIN OF BEEF BOASTED. 

78. — Break the upper part of the chine-bones, cut them 
ont, and cut through the strong gristle on the top about an 
inch apart, and skewer it in its place, which will (irevent its 
drawing up or looking uns^htly. Run the spit just an<ler the 
hailt at the th'" end, and bring it out between the joints. By 
g[ntting it thus you avoid showing where the spit has gone 
thioi^h. Cover the &t with a sheet of buttered paper, and 
mast gently for 3 or 4 faouis, according to the size of the 
jcrint. The under part is sometimes stuffed with forcemeat, 
in tbe fi^owir^ manner : — 



a sharp knife; take out all the n 




MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VHI. 

Carefully liit up the fat from the inside of the sirloin with 
close to the bone, and 
mince it small ; take 
i lb. of Buet, and 
chop it fine ; mix 
with it some grated 
bread - crumbs, a 
little lemon - peel, 
thyme, and eschalot 
minced very fine ; 
mix aJl tt^ther 
with a glass of port 
wine; put it back 
a^;ain into the same 
place, and cover it 
with the skin and 
fat ; skewer it down neatly with small wooden skewers, and 
cover it with paper. The meat should be spitted before you 
take out the inside ; and when done do not take off the paper 
until the joint b put into the dish : then serve it up ganged 
with scraped horseradish. 

The method of taking the meat from the bone, and rolling 
it so as to have the forcemeat in the middle, b easier, but adds 
its flavour to the whole joint ; wliile tliis way keeps the upper 
and the under part separate. 

To dress the inside of a Sirloin, cut it out in one piece, if 
not used at table ; stew it with good broth or gravy, a little 
spice, and a tablespoonful of walnut-ketchup. Serve with 
chopped pickles. 

To dress the inside of a cold Sirloin, cut out all the meat, 
and B. little fat into pieces as thick as your finger, and 4 inches 
long; dredge them with flour, and fry in butter of a nice 
brown : drain the butter from the meat, and toss it up in a 
rich gravy, seasoned with pepper, salt, anchovy, and shalot. 
I>o not let it boil on any account. Before you serve, add 2 
spoonfuls of vinegar and a glass of port wine. Garnish with 
crimped parsley. 

Or:-— Cut die meat in slices about 4 inches long, and i an

a L'ttle mmhroom fcelchu]}, and a lablespoonful of eschalot 
vinegar, with a wine-glass of port, and Just before serving put 
in a small piece of butter rolled in flour. Serve hot in a 
covered dish. This part ^'called the "Fillet," and, when 
raw, may be either stewed whole or in the above manner. 

FILLET OF BEEF. 

79. — 7b dress the inside of a Sirloin of Beef to taste likt 
Hare. — Take the inside of a large sirloin that has hung until 
tender ; soak it 24 hours in a few glasses of port wine and 
vinegar. Have ready a good stuffing as for hare ; do not 
spread, but put it into tlte middle uf the beef, and roll it up 
tight. Roast it on a lianging spit, and baste it with a glass (^ 
the wine and vinegar, mised with a teaspoonful of Jamaica 
pepper, and a clove or two, in the finest powder, until it is all 
dri^ up ; then baste with butter. Serve with a rich gravy in 
the dish, and currant-jelly sauce iu a tureen. 

RUMP OF BEEF. 

60.— 'If of a well-fed ox, and hung till tender, this is one of 
the most juicy and best flavoured of all the joints of beef, hut 
b more frequently stewed than roasted. It is generally sold 
in the country undivided from the aitch-bone ; or cut across, 
and not lengthwise, as in London, which makes it too large for 
one dressing, and neither fit for boiling nor roasting. 

At &niUy dinners, a Yorkshire pudding is a usual accompa- 
niment, but sow seldom served at genteel tables. 

TO STEW BEEF. 

81. — It should be put down in a pot with just sufficient cold 
water to cover the meat, and closely covered. After boiling 
3 or 4 hours, according to the size of the piece, cut in small 
pieces, not larger than dice, 2 or 3 carrots and heads of celery, 
with a little sweet herbs, and put them into the pot along with 
peppercorns, mace, and a couple of large onions stuck full of 
cloves, and let it then simmer by the ^e of the fire for 2 to 
3 hours, taking care to skim off any grease that may appear 
on the top. 

By this time the meat will probably be tender enot^ ; 

when take out the whole onions, mince them, and liy them in 

butler, to be mixed in the gravy made by the meat, which

1 16 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VHT. 

some mushroom or walnut ketchup. Thicken the gravy with 
a little flour, and brown it, if necessary, with a spoonful of 
sugar burnt sofl ; 
which, besides im- 
parting its colour, 
adds an agreeable 
, flavour. Such is the 
' most simple mode ; 
but the sauce may 
be much improved 
by a glass or two of 
■'" - port wine and a 

spoonful of curry powder : if the odour of garlic be not ob- 
jected to, a clove boiled in the stew will be found to give it a 
fine flavour. Garnish with vegetables. 

A small piece of beef — say of 4 lbs. — will take the time 
mentioned ; but the large joints will require full double that 
time ; and should l>e put to stew overnight, adding the vege~ 
tables in the morning. 

Rump of Beef Slew.^Haif-ioast it ; then put it into a pot 
with 3 pints of water, a pound of sliced bacon, a tniach of 
sweet herl)s, 2 wine-glasses of vinegar, and a bottle of cider or 
sniall wine ; stick cloves into a couple of lai^e onions, add a 
few sage-leaves, and cover the beef clceely, adding more water 
should there not be sufficient gravy from the meat. Let it 
Nmmer for 3 hours; then str^n the gravy. Boil or l>ake 
some button onions, and lay Ihem round the beef; cover it 
also with forcemeat tialls, fried ornaments of paste, and mush- 
rooms, if in season ; add to the gravy a glass of port wine, a 
spoonful of soy and Oude sauce ; l)oil down a part to a glaze, 
and put it on the beef: thicken the remainder if necessary, 
and pour it round, garnishing the dish with pickles. 

Or : — Season it high with cayenne, salt, aUspice, cloves, and 
a blade of mace, all in fine powder. Bind it up tight, and lay 
it into a pot that will just hold it ; resting it on 2 or 3 twigs, 
to prevent the meat from sticking. Fry 3 lar^e onions sliced, 
and put them to it, with carrots, turnips, a shalot, a blade of 
mace, and some celery. Cover the meat with good beef-broth, 
and simmer it as gently as possible for several hours until 
quite tender. Clear ofi the fat ; and add to the gravy ^ pint 
of port wine, a small glass of cliili vinegar, and a lai^ spoon- 
j!t/ of ketcbap; simmer ^ an hour, and serve in a deep dish. 



The herbs to be used slioulil be bumet, tarnigna, parslejra 
thyme, basil, niarjorajn, and all or any of the aiust savoiUTi ' 

Or : — Prepare the beef as directed in the for^^iug- receipts, 
and glaze it twice ; stew some white haricot beaus io goud 
brown gravy, with an onion sliced, a carrot, some parsley, and 
a buDch of sweet herbri, a clove of garlic, a bay-leaf, and a 
slice of lean bam ; let all simmer gently tc^ether till tlie beiuis 
are sulficiently tender ; then separate them from the other 
v^petables, and put them in a sieve to drain ; pa;is the eauce 
and v^etablea through a. tammy, add a tablespoonful of 
viii^ar, and, if uot thick enough, a bit of butter rolled ia 
flour ; put ill the haricot beans, make all boiling hot, and pour 
the sauce into the dish round the beef. 

Brisket of Beef Slewed. — Stew it in sufficient water to 
cover the meat ; when quite tender, take out the bones, and 
»kim off tlie fat ; add to the gravy, when strained, a glass of 
wine and a little spice tied up in a muslin bag- Have ready 
either mushrooms, truffles, or vegetables boiled, and cut into 
shapes. Lay them on and romid the beef; reduce part of the 
(rravv to a g:laze, lay it on the top. and pour the reuiainder 
into ihe dish. 

It is a good piece to be stewed, as it may be cut from the 
biMie, and of any size. 

Leg of Beef Stewed.— S^t 6 lbs. of the half-leg, or stiff 
marrow-bone of beef, for 3 or 4 days. Make holes in it about 
\\ inch deep, and pre^ in, very hard, forcemeat made in the 
fcjlowing manner : H lb. of suet sliced very fine, pepper, salt, 
and a few cloves, some winter savory, and sweet maijoram, 
mixed well ti^^her. The beef must be baked in a deep pan, 
witb water reaching about three^uart«r3 of the way up, and 
forcaneat spread over the top, which, when the meat 'is baked, 
is taken off, cut into shapes, and laid round the dish. 

BOUILLOlf 

82. — Is the common soup of France, and is in use in almost 
every French family. Put into an earthen stock-pot in the 
jKoportion of 1 lb. of beef to 1 quart of cold water. Place it 
en the side of the fire, and let it become slowly hot. By so 
(feiiig the fibre of the meat is enlarged, the gelatine b dis- 



118 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VXH. 

solved, and the savorous parts of the meat are diffused through 
the broth. When the object is simply to make a good, pure- 
flavoured beef broth, part of the shin or leg will answer the 
purpose, adding some vegetables, and letting it stew 4 or 5 
hours ; but if the meat is to be eaten, the rump or leg-of- 
mutton piece should be used. 

BOUILLL 

83. — The rump of beef is best for this purpose, as the 
meat is to be served up in a separate dish, and will make a 
finely-flavoured sort of soup. Take as much of it as may be 
thought necessary ; but for a small party, say from 4 to 6 lbs., 
along with 2 or 3 large roasted onions, in one of which some 
cloves may be stuck, and a moderate quantity of whole pepper, 
with a bunch of sweet herbs ; to which an anchovy may be 
added : put it in a stewpan, covered with rather more than a . 
pint of cold water to every pound of meat ; and let it simmer 
by the side of the fire for 4 or 5 hours, or until it has become 
quite tender; then take out the herbs and onions, and add 
carrots, turnips, and celery, either cut into small squares or 
sliced, and let the whole boil until sufficiently stewed, and 
ready for the table. 

The soup should then be strained off, and served separately, 
leaving only so much as may be necessary for making sauce 
for the vegetables. The sauce should be a little thickened, 
and seasoned to the palate ; if a clove of garlic, or a tea- 
spoonful of garlic and chili vinegar, be added, it will improve 
the flavour. In Ireland it is not uncommon to send up the 
bouilli smothered in onion-sauce, the other vegetables being 
either not used, or brought up in the soup ; in France it is very 
usual to dress cabbage and sausages as an accompaniment to 
the bouilli ; but, in England, it is more customary to serve it 
up with the vegetable-sauce as above stated. Cucumbers cut 
into dice and stewed, with a spoonful of chili vinegar added, are 
served at most of the German hotels. The meat, if gently 
stewed until quite tender, without being boiled to rags, will be 
found excellent, and the whole an admirable dish. 

Take a handsome piece of brisket of 10 lbs. weight ; put it 
over the fire with a small quantity of water until the gravy is 
out ; add a very large bunch of parsley, pepper, salt, and an 
onion. When the gravy is drawn, add 2 gallons of boiling 
water, and let it stew until perfectly tender ; chop the parsley, 



sa<i lay it oa the top of the meat, Uuckeu the gravy with 
v^etables, and serve it up. 

Or.— Take aboat 9 lbs. of the beef, tie it' tightly with a 
I^>e. and put it into a slewpan with just suflieieni water to , 
cover it : add onions, celery, a little parsley, and spiee ; allow 
it to boil gently, and, when about half done, add a large an- 
choi^. Cut a small quantity oi carrots, greens, and capers 
Tery fine, mix them with a part of the soup ; let them stew till 
lender, and then serve them with the beef, laying part on the 
top and the rest rouud ; or, served up separately, and smo- 

Tfae tope! of the long ribs make good bouilti. sinunered in a 
small quantity of water, and seried on a bed of red cabbage, 
stewed sepaistely, and flavoured with a gla.>is of vinegar. It 
also eats excellently, if, when simply boUed, it is served up 
smothered with ouiou sauce. 

Eibs (^ Jefl/", though rarely dressed en bouil/i, are yet most 
«sceilent when so prepared. Take the middle of the flat ribs 
of beef, stew it until the meat is tender and the bones will 
' eome out, employing as small a quantity of water as will cover 
tiie meal, and a brmdie of sweet herbs. Let it stand until it is 
cold, remove the &t, add to the gravy, carrots, turnips, and 
celery, cut in dice, and a dozen or two of small silver onions ; 
warm up the beef in it, and send it to table. 

StEUF TREMBLANT.—E. R. 

84. — Cut a handsome piece of beef from the rump, either a 
fillet or square ; hang it up for 4 days, then put it ^ uight to 
soak in a pickle of salt and vinegar ; put it into a stewpan, 
aad let it be covered with water ; add a seasoning of whole 
p^iper and salt, a bundle of sweet herbs, and an onion. Let 
it simmer very slowly as loi^ as it will hai^ together, takii^ 
care to skim it well. Stnun the gravy, and add to it carrots 
previously boiled, and cut into pieces an inch long ; add also 
a few capeiB and a mushroom, with a glass of wine and the 
juice of a lemcui. When the beef has been sufiiciently stewed 
take it up, and set it for a short time in a Dutch oven, and 
glaze it, or brown it with a salamander. 

A small rump of beef may be dressed in the same manner. 

In France, besides the pot-au-feu already described, it b 
Tfflj usual to stew about 3 lbs. of beef with a small piece gf 



120 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VIH. 

liver and a veal bone, or the remains of a fowl, with its head 
and claws, in 2 quarts of water put into an earthen vessel and 
placed beside a wood-fire early in the morning, so as to be 
ready by dinner-time. 

When the meat has boiled once, it is skimmed, and salted ; 
carrots, turnips, with a fried onion and any vegetables in 
season, are minced and allowed to simmer gently in it until 
the whole contents are stewed tender ; but the meat is served 
separately, and thin slices of bread are put into the broth to 
thicken it, unless rice or vermicelli be employed for that pur- 
pose. It makes an ample meal for 8 to 10 hearty persons, as 
soup is not, in that country, usually made very strong of the 
meat. 

In Germany nearly the same practice is followed throughout 
the greater part of the country ; only that small sausages and 
chopped cabbage are more used than either rice or vermicelli, 
and that sour cream is substituted for paste as thickening. 
The quantity of meat is also smaller, and the vegetables, which 
form the chief part of the stew, are all fried in dripping ; the 
whole mess is also brought to table. Cold meat is seldom 
brought to table, being generally pounded and made up into 
moulds, covered with bread-crumbs and browned ; but in no 
instance is cayenne or any sort of pepper largely used, and 
often entirely omitted. 

A FAMILY STEW OF BEEF—E. R. 

85. — Take any piece of beef good for stewing, cut it into 
small pieces, slice 2 or 3 large onions, and put them into the 
stewpan with 2 ounces of butter or good beef-dripping. When 
melted, dredge in some flour, add the meat also dredged with 
flour, and enough water to keep it from burning. When the 
gravy has drawn, fill up with boiling water, let it come to a 
boil gently, skim the pot well, then add a spoonful of mixed 
spices, and a bay-leaf or two ; set the pan by the side of the 
fire to stew slowly for a couple of hours. 1 1 lbs. of meat will 
take 4 hours. This dish may be thickened like Irish stew, 
with potatoes, or it may be served with the addition of chopped 
vegetables of all kinds, previously fried. 

STEWED BEEF-STEAKS.— E. R. 

86. — Put the steak into a stewpan with a lump of butter 
over a slow fire, and turn it until the butter has become a fine 



Ch*p. Vni.] BEEF. 121 

white gravy, then pour it intu ti basin, and put more butter to 
the steak. When the steak is nicely done, take it out, return 
bU the gravy into the stewpaii, and fry the ateak ; then add it 
to the gravy in the stewpan, with a tablespoonful of wine, and 

I k ehalot fioely sliced ; slew it for 10 minutes, aud serve it up. 

I'.Or, fry the steak merely at first, then put it into 4 pint of 
irater, an onion sliced, a spouiiful of walnut ketchup, pepper 
and salt, cover it close, thicken it with flour aud butter, and 
serve it up very hot. 

With Vegetables. — Cut the steak about 2J inches thick ; 
dredge it with flour, and fry it in butter, of a fine brown. Lay 
it in a stewpan, and pour water into the frying-pan ; let it boil, 
and add it to the strait, which is rendered richer by this prty 
cess ; slice in turnips, carrots, celery, and onions, adding 
pepper, salt, and a little mace. It should be highly seasoned, 
and sent to table with the surface ornamented with forcemeat 
balls, carrots and turnips cut into shapes, and sometimes with 
ooion fritters, the v^etables to be put round it. 

P lFit^ Oytlers. — Cut the steak rather thick ; brown it in a 
fiying-pan with butter. Add i pint of water, an onion sliced, 
pepper and salt, cover the pan close, and let it atew very 
slowly fiir 1 hour ; then add a glass of port wine, a little flour, 
and a dozen or two of oysters, their liquor havii^ been previ- 
ously strained and put into the stewpan. 

With Cutmmbert, it may be dressed the same way, only 
nmng white wine instead of port ; the cucumbers to be stewed 
separately in a little gravy or broth, and added to the beef 5 
minutes before serving ; fry the cucumbers, and stew them in 
die -water poured into the pan after the fat is poured off; if 
stewed mth the steak they will make it hard. 

A distinction should be always made between Eump-steak 
and Beef-»teak, as the latter is very inferior ; but a slice cut 
from the sirloin is most excellent. See Section II. 

BROILED RUMP-STEAK,— E. R. 
87. — Cut the steaks about J inch thick, from a rump of beef 
that has hm:^ until quite tender ; let the gridiron be hot, well 
rubbed with beef suet, and tlie fire clear. Lay on the steaks, 
one by one, turning them frequently with steak-tongt — a fork 
should never be used ; when brown on both sides, lay them aa 



122 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VHI. 

a hot dish, and send them instantly to table, for, if not eaten 
hot, the steak will become soddened. Should it not have hung 
long enough to be tender, beat it with a rolling-pin ; put no 
salt on, or it will harden the steak. The grand secret is a quick 
clear fire, frequent turning, and quick cooking ; for if the meat 
be long upon the fire it will be hard. 

B>espectmg frequent or only once turning, that must depend 
on whether the steak is to be done in the usual way, — ^that the 
gravy may not be drawn out on either side ; or whether it is 
to be done " rare" — that is to say, very much underdone. If 
in the former case, the steak should be cut only i inch — ^but, if 
rare, f inch — thick, turning it only once, and the fire should 
be more brisk than in the former case ; by which means the 
meat will be sufficiently scorched on both sides, without being 
burned. It is not in perfection if served with anything else ; 
if approved, a little minced shalot and a tablespoonful of 
ketchup may be put into the dish, and it may be garnished 
with horseradish : to pepper it is to spoil it. 

Such is the mode of dressing it at Bellamy's of the House of 
Clommons, at the Blue Posts in Cork Street, and at all the 
chop-houses around the Royal Exchange. The steak, if large 
enough, should be cut in two ; one part being sent up first, 
and the remainder afterwards, this second course being always 
the best. 

Ten minutes will be sufficient to cook a large steak if it be 
rare ; but if well done, from that to i hour. 

Respecting the dressing of steaks, we have heard it asserted 
that not one cook in ten knows how to prepare a beefsteak ; 
they neglect the grand rule, which is to separate the fat from 
the lean ; to put it on the gridiron first, and take it off" last, so 
as to broil it half as long again as the lean. That makes it 
pulpy, like marrow. 

FOR BOILING BEEF. 

88. — To boil a Hound of Seef — Supposing it to be from 
20 to 30 lbs. weight, and very salt,* soak it in 2 waters ; wash 
it well, and take out the bone ; the cavity made by its removal 
may be plugged up with fat ; then skewer the meat up with 
the flap round it, and bind it firmly with several folds of strong 

* 1 oz. of saltpetre, 1 lb. of common salt, and 2 oz. of brown sugar, will be 
sufficient for 16 lbs. of beef. 



Chap. VIIL] BEEF. 123 

tape ; put it into a large pot, well covered with cold water, 
and hoDg it over a moderate fire, to let it boil slowly, that it 
may heat giadnalLy all through ; take off the semn as it rises, 
and, when no more appears, keep the pot closely covered. 
Tun the meat twice while it is boiling ; and, about 2 hours 
before it is done, put in some carrots, cut into large pieces ; if 
yon have parsnips, let them be mashed ; but if you use gre^is 
or cabbage, boil them separately ; and, with boiled saU beef, 
never use tomips. 

A round of this size will take full 6 hours to boil it pro- 
perly ; that is to say, neither too much over nor under done ; 
and, if only of 12 to 15 lbs., will require nearly 4 to 5 hours. 

7b boil a JRump of Beef ^ mix some common salt, a little 
saltpetre, some parsl^, thyme, marjoram, green onions, 
pepper, and salt, and rub all wdl into your meat, and let it 
lie 3 or 4 days ; then put it into a pot, and fill it with water; 
add some celery, with 2 or 3 sliced carrots, and small whole 
onions ; let it do gently fi>r 3 or 4 hours, according to the size, 
and serve with the v^etables neatly placed in the dis^ 

The other joints that are usually salted and boiled are the 
aitchbone and the brisket. 

BUBBLE-AND-SQUEAK.— E. JR. 

89. — Cut slices from a cold boiled round or rump of beef; 
let them be fried quickly until brown, and put them into a 
dish to be kept hot. Clean the pan from the fat ; put into it 
greens and carrots previously boiled and chopped small, or, in- 
stead of these, large onions sliced thin and fned, though both 
the latter are sometimes omitted. Add a little butter, pepper, 
and salt ; make them very hot, and put them round the beef 
with a little gravy. 

Cold pork boiled is thought by some to be a better material 
for bubble-and-squeak than beef, which is sometimes hard. In 
either case the slices should be very thin, and lightly fried. 

BAKED BEEF, 

90. — A Rump of 20 to 25 lbs. weight. — Take 2 ounces 
each of pepper and allspice, 1 ounce of pounded cloves, and 
the same quantity of mace ; rub this all over the joint, which 
should be hung up for a fortnight or three weeks, according to 
the weather — taking care to keep it dry, and to occasionally 



124 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VIII. 

renew the seasoning. When ready for bakmg, wash off the 
spice with port wine, and lard the rump throughout — ^not in 
the common mode used by poulterers, but by inserting large 
lardoons in different parts of the meat. Then put a large 
quantity of suet, shred fine, both under and over it, and cover 
it with coarse flour and water paste, between which and the 
suet you may put a few bay-leaves or some sweet-herbs. If 
eaten hot, the dough, bay-leaves, and suet must all be taken 
off; the joint basted, sprinkled with a little salt and flour, 
over which a salamander should be passed ; and served up 
with strong gravy or brown sauce. If cold, leave on the 
dough till wanted. 

It should be baked in a moderately-heated oven, and will 
take, according to the size, from 6 to 8 hours' baking. 

A Round of Beef ma,j be dressed in the same manner; but 
the bone should in that case be taken out, and the hole flUed 
up with forcemeat. The flap should be filled in like manner, 
skewered, and tightly bound round with linen or strong tape, 
in which case the dough and the larding may be omitted, 
though the latter will be found an improvement. It should 
be always left until cold. 

Brisket, — Take all the bones out of 8 lbs. of brisket of 
beef; make holes in it about an inch asunder, and fill one with 
fat bacon, a second with parsley, a third with oysters, and so 
on, each being chopped and seasoned with pepper, salt, nut- 
meg, and cloves. When completely stuffed, lay it in a pan, 
dredge it well with flour, pour upon it ^ pint of port, and the 
same of broth. Bake it 3 hours, and then skim off the fat ; 
put the meat into a dish, strain the gravy over, and garnish 
with pickles. 

Any piece of fresh beef, even of the coarsest pieces, may be 
dressed in this manner, or baked before the fire in a Dutch 
oven with button onions, the meat being previously rubbed 
over with oil. It is a common mode in Portugal and Spain. 
There, however, the forcemeat and spice are omitted; but 
the beef is always larded with pledgets of bacon of the size 
of a woman's little finger, inserted into several punctures 
throughout the inside of the meat, to which are added some 
cloves of garlic, and the piece covered with thick brown sauce 
when brought to table. 

Scarlet Beef, — Take 3 lbs. of tender lean beef from the 



Chap. Vm.] BEEP. 125 

round, and rub it well with the following' ingredients :— Mix 
eqnal proportions of mace, allspice, black pepper, salt, sugar, 
snd siltpetre. Rub this well into tout meat ; let it lie S or 
6 days, tunitng it daily, and repeatedly nibbing- in the mix- 
ture ; then roll it and tie it flnnly round with wide tape ; put 
it into ajar which will just hold it, with the spice, and a little 
beef-suet over and under it ; tie it down close, and bake it 
g^entlj until tender. It is eaten cold, and should be cut in 
thin slices and garnished with parsley. 

Another way to dreis Scarlet Beef. — Take a brisket or thin 
Sank of beef, and rub it well all over with equal quantities of 
common and bay salt, and an ounce of saltpetre ; let it remain 
£ir 4 or 5 days in an earthen pan, when it will become red; 
it should be turned once every day. Boil it gently for 4 
hours, and serve it hut, with savoys or any kind of greens ; or 
leave it to get cold, and press it with a heavy weight. 

If served up liot, add a wineglaw^ful of port wine, a table- 
spoonful of muiihroom catsup, a teaspoouful of shalut- vinegar, 
uid some butter rolled in flour. Place the meat neatly in the 
di^, and pour the sauce over it. 

TO BASH BEEF. 

SI. — y rair, hang the beef till it is quite tender; then cut 
tome thin slices, and put them in a stewpan with just water 
enough to cover them, a bunch of sweet-herbs, an onion, and 
a. little pepper and salt ; cover the stewpan close, and let them 
stew till tender ; then put in a glass of port wine, and a table- 
spoonful of eschalot-vinegar. When it is warm, pour the sauce 
through a hair sieve to clear it from the herbs and vegetables ; 
then put it back into the saucepan with the hash, and thicken 
it with butter kneaded in flour, with a little brown sugar. 
This is an excellent dish, and may be made &om the trimmings 
of large joints of meat. 

If cold, mince a shalot and an onion ; fry in a little butter ; 
then add a spoonful of flour, a little gravy, and a spoonful of 
walDut-liquor or ketchup. When it boils, put in the slices of 
beef cut thin ; let them get hot through, but not boiled. Sliced 
potatoes and onions may be added if approved. 

Observe that it is owing to boiling hashes or minces that 
tfaey get hard. All sorts of stews, or meat dressed a second 
tiine, should be only ummered. 



126 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. Vm. 

BEEF HEAR T. 

92. — If the ox be not young, the heart will be strong in 
flavour, and should be soaked the night before in vinegar and 
water. Though looked upon as a coarse and rather vulgar 
dish, it is yet very economical for a large family, and may be 
dressed in various ways, so as to render it very palatable. 

To roast. — Soak it overnight, and then wash and clean it 
very well ; take out all the white thick skin, and fill it with 
stuffing of a savoury description, having a larger proportion of 
marjoram than usual ; make a strong gravy, and serve it up 
with currant-jelly sauce. It should not be spitted, but hung 
from an upright jack ; but the better way is to hake it for 4 or 
5 hours in a slow oven, and either lard it profusely or baste it 
frequently with butter. 

It is a good plan to dress beef-heart in this way a day before 
roasting or baking a hare, as, when cold and both hashed to- 
gether, they can scarcely be distinguished from each other. 
When there is no hare, hash the heart the same way by cutting 
it in slices, warming it in gravy with a glass of port wine and 
melted currant-jelly. Its appearance and flavour may be much 
improved by dividing it in half, covering it with slices of fat 
bacon, laying the forcemeat over it, rolling it round, and 
dressing it in either way as above. The other half will make 
excellent beef a-la-mode. 

To stew, — Either take one-half or the whole of the heart, 
stuffed as above, and put it into the stewpan, not more than 
covered with beef-gravy and a pint of red wine, with spice and 
sugar; or put only beer, spiced and sugared in the same 
manner, keeping the pan all the time closely covered. 

OX' CHEEK. 

93. — Soak half a head for 3 hours if it be young and 
tender ; or, if not, soak it the day before it is to be eaten ; wash 
it very thoroughly ; then put it into a stewpan, or into an 
earthen pan to bake, with 2 quarts of water, and let it simmer 
for 8 hours, with an onion stuck with cloves, a head of celery, 
a bundle of sweet-herbs, and some whole pepper ; and to this 
you may, in 2 hours, add plenty of carrots, leeks, and, lastly, 
two or three turnips. When ready, take out the head, remove 
the meat from the bones, and cut it neatly ; strain the gravy, 
remove all the fat, make some nice forcemeat-balls, and warm 



Cbap. vm.] BEEP. 127 

them with the meat and a part of tbe gravy, to which a glass 
uf wine must be added. 

To ttew Ox-cheek. — Clean the head nicely, then soak il for 
some hours in cold water; put it into a stewpan, and let it 
simmer gently till it is quite tender ; then lake out the bones, 
and tie the meat up in a doth ; put a weight upon it, and let 
it stand till the next day ; make a forcemeat of any white meat, 
and boil six egg^ hard ; eut tbe cheek in slices ; put Home at 
the bottom of a dish, then a layer of forcemeat, theu one <rf' 
the sliced eggs, another of meat, and so on till the dish is fiill ; 
season with pepper and salt, and pour in as much of the ^.ivy 
as the dish will hold : either stew it in the usual way, or cover 
it with a coarse paste and send it to the oven to be baked 
slowly. The paste to be removed before brought to table. 

BEEF TONGUE. 

94. — If it has been dried and tmoked, before it is dressed ^14 
should be soaked overnight ; 
but if only pickled, a few 
hoojs will be sufficient. Pat 
itintoapotofcold water, and 
set it over a slow fire lor an 
hour or two before it c 
to a boil ; then put it aside, 
and keep it simmering for I 
3i to 4 hours, according H 
its ?iz<; : you (^ri ascertain

it with a skewer. Feel it, 

trim the root, glaze it, and before serving surround the root 
with a paper frill, and stick a flower or two on the top. 

Its appearance, and its flavour also, may be improved by 
rubbing it over, when skinned, with yolk of eg^, on which 
crumbs of bread and finely-minced sweet-herbs may be strewed; 
then slightly basting it with butter, and browning it with a 
salamander. 

To slew Tongue. — Salt a tongue with saltpetre and common 
nit for a week, turning it every day ; boil it tender enough 
to ped ; when done, stew it with a moderately strong gravy ; 
■eaaon with soy, mushroom-ketchup, cayenne pepper, pounded 
doveh and salt if necessary. Serve with truffles, morals, and 
red in gravy. 




128 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VHT. 

An excellent way of preparing Tongues to eat cold. — Season 
with common salt and saltpetre, brown sugar, a little bay- 
salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and allspice, in fine powder, for a 
fortnight ; then take away the pickle, put the tongue into a 
small pan, and lay some butter on it ; cover it with brown 
crust, and bake it slowly till so tender that a straw will go 
through it ; put it into a tin mould, and press it weU, laying 
in as much fat as possible. 

The thin part of tongues, if hung up to dry, grates like 
hung beef, and also makes a fine addition to die flavour of 
omelets. 

To roast a Beef Tongue. — Take a fine large fresh tongue^ 
scald it, and take off the skin ; cut it off at the root and trim 
it neatly ; stick a few cloves here and there in it, and put it 
in a cradle-spit ; sprinkle it with salt, and baste it well with 
butter. Serve it with a good sauce in a sauceboat, made as 
follows : — Put into a stewpan J pint of port wine, with about 
half the quantity of well-seasoned gravy ; reduce it to one- 
half; then stir in a good piece of butter and a tablespoonful 
of flour ; add a squeeze of lemon ; when the butter is melted 
and the sauce done, place the tongue in a dish, and serve hot 
with the sauce poured round. In Spain, the sauce is strongly 
impregnated with saflron. 

FRESH BEEF TONGUE.— E. R. 

95. — Take a green tongue, stick it with cloves, and boil it 
gently for 3 hours ; then brush it over with the yolk of an 
egg, dredge it well with bread-crumbs, and roast it, basting it 
well with butter. When dished, serve it with a little brown 
gravy flavoured with a glass of wine, and lay slices of currant- 
jelly round it. A pickled tongue, well washed, may be dressed 
in the same way, and beef-udders also. 

Afresh neat^s tongue and udder may be roasted together in 
the manner thus described ; but when ready to be dished, 
instead of currant-jelly, put 4 pint of gravy into a saucepan, 
with the juice of a Seville orange, two lumps of sugar, a glass 
of claret, and a piece of butter : toss the whole over the fire, 
and serve it up with the tongue and udder, garnishing the dish 
with slices of lemon. The udder should be stuck wiSi cloves, 
and both should be continually basted. 

A la Parisienne, — Put it into a large stewpan with the 



Chap. VUL] BEEP. 129 



claws, heads, or trimmiiigB of fowl, an onion stuck with cloves, 
a bundle of sweet-herba, some pepper and salt, at first a small 
quantity of water, and then as much aa will be required to form 
slock for a whole dinner. It must be cookai the day before it 
is wanted, and will be foond aji elegant and economical dish, 
as it will fumi'ih the basL« necessary for all the sauces at a 
dinner-party. Any parings of meat or poultry, ham or bacon 
bones, may be put with it. Reduce some of the aauee to a 
glaze; put the tongue into the oven to make it hot, glaze it, 
put it on a dish, and place a wreath of flowers cut in turnips 
and carrots at each end. 

lytngue de Sauf ptqu^.-^Having removed the root and 
gullet of a small neat's tongue, rub it well with salt ; nest day 
hang it to drain, and wipe it. Let it lie in salt 1 day, boil it 
i an hour, blanch and remove the skin ; then, having rolled 
some fresh-cured fkt bacon in a seasoning of pepper, salt, 
cloves, mace, cumamon, and nutmeg, with parsley, knotted 
maijoram, ciiives or chibots, and a little morsel of garlic minced 
small, lard the tongue all over, except a little space up the 
middle, where it is to be divided from the root to tlie tip; , 
braize and glaze as usual, having, afler it is dressed, cut it in 
two, except at the two extremities, and thus lay it on the dish 
in d>e form of a heart. 

Larded h la Pruste. — Boil the toi^e gently for 3 hours, 
then peel and lard it with bacon ; take some of the liquor it 
was boiled in ; fry a doz«n or two of silver onions ; add a glass 
of wine, a little fiour, a lump of sugar, and the juice of half a 
lenMMi ; stew the whole together for another hour. 

OX-TJJLS. 
96. — Cut the tails in pieces ; lay them in a stewpan, with 
butter and a lat^ onion ; set them over a smart fire to make 
them brown ; peel and boil a couple of dozen of button onions 
in aboat 3 pints of water, for 15 or 20 minutes ; set them by, 
and poor the liquor they were boiled in upon the tails, adding 
nfficient boiling water to cover them ; put in 6 ounces of 
aiTota, and 8 of turnips, cut into slices, or balls the size of 
mttmegs ; put in the carrots 20 minutes before the turnips. 
Be (arefiil that they are not stewed too fest or too mudi. 
Whm they are tender, pass the gravy throi^ a sieve ; skim 
off the &t, and pay great attention in doing so, as the &.t rises 



130 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. Vm. 

while the tails are stewing. Keep the meat and v^etables hot. 
Thicken the gravy by putting an ounce of butter into a stew- 
pan ; when melted, stir in as much flour as will stiffen it. Pour 
the gravy in by degrees, stirring it till it boils; strain it 
through a sieve into a stewpan, and let it simmer gently till 
the meat and vegetables are dished. Lay the tails round the 
dish, and the vegetables in the middle ; pour the gravy over ; 
minced gherkins or capers may be added. Pour boiling water 
over the onions to warm them, and put them round die dish 
the last thing. 

Or : — Divide them at the joints, blanch, and parboil them ; 
put them into a stewpan with just water, or weak broth, 
enough to cover them ; let them sinuner over a gentle fire, and 
remove the scum carefully as it rises ; then put in an onion, a 
blade of mace, and a little pepper and salt ; put them on 
again to simmer, and when sufficiently done add a spoonful of 
essence of anchovy and some flour rolled in butter. This is 
an excellent and nourishing dish. 

TRIPE, 

97. — Tripe may be dressed in several ways, but, whatever 
mode may be employed, it will always be found an improve- 
ment to soak it for a whole night in milk. Indeed, if left in 
the milk until that gets sour, the acidity thus imparted to it 
will render it still better. 

To boil Tripe. — Put it into hot milk and water, an equal 
quantity of each ; milk may be entirely omitted, or that used 
in which it may have been soaked; let it boil until quite 
tender. Boil several large onions in 2 waters, so as to dimi- 
nish their flavour ; or if Spanish onions can be got, they should 
be preferred. When quite tender, slice the onions into small 
flakes, but leave them in that state, and do not mash them 
into smooth sauce ; put the onions into a casserole with milk 
and butter, so as to make a delicate white sauce, and season it 
only with a little salt, or a slight grating of nutmeg ; then put 
the tripe, hot from the pot, into a deep dish, and smother it 
entirely with the sauce. It is usually eaten with pepper and 
mustard, at the discretion of the guests. Oyster-sauce is some- 
times used, and much approved. 

To roast Tripe, — Cut the tripe in square pieces ; make a 
rich forcemeat, spread it over the pieces of tripe, and roll 



them up tightly ; fasten them upon a, spit, flour and baate 
Ihem well, and serve tliem up with melted butter and slices of 
Seville orange or leiuon. 

To fry. — Dip it into batter of flour aud eggs, and fty it of 
a good brown. Serve with onions fried. 

To sfero.— Simmer it in beef or vea! gravy ; thicken it with 
butter rolled in a very little flour, and add a. spoonful of 
mushroom-ketchup. Or boil it tender in milk, and serve with 
whit« sauce. 

Tripe and Tomata-Sauce.^Select some double tripe ; boil 
it imtil tender ; let it cool ; cut in small pieces ; dip them in 
^g and bread-crumbs ; &y them a Ught brown ; gerve with 

CO W-HEEL3. 

9a. — Ox-feet, or Cow-lieels, are not highly esteemed, but 
they contain much nutriment, aud may be dressed in the 
various ways abeady stated for tripe, with which they are com- 
m<Hily boiled. They are frequently eaten cold, with mustard 
aud vinegar. 

Si3ak Ihera well ; boil, and serve in a napkin, witli Illicit 
melted butter, a large spoonful of vinegar, and a little mustard 
and salt. Or boil, and then stew them in a. brown gravy. Or 
cot the heel in four parts, dip each in c^, flour, and fiy them 
in butter. Or fry, and serve with onions fned and put round 
tbem : sauce as above. 

Tbe water in which they are boiled will make equally good 
jdlies, either relishing or sweet, with that of calves' feet, if 
duly prepared ; and at a far less expense. This jelly gives 
great additional richness likewise to soups and gravies. 

To fry Oxfeet, or Cow-heel. — After preparing them as 
above, cut them into small pieces ; have ready some bread 
finely crumbled, dip the pieces into the yolk of an egg beaten 
vf, and roll them in the bread-crumte mised with chopped 
parsley, pepper, and salt ; fry th^n tn butter or fresh lard, of 
a fine brown colour. 

To pot Ox-feet, or Cow-heel. — Boil them in fi«sh water till 

the bones can be easily removed ; cut them into small pieces, 

add a little of the liquor, just enough to moisten it, and mix 

with it a spoonful of vinegar, some pepper and Bait, and a little 

K, 2 



132 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. Vin. 

pounded mace ; put it into a mould and turn it out when cold. 
It is eaten with vinegar and mustard. 

MARRO W'BONES. 

99. — If too long to serve undivided, saw them in two; 
cover the open end with a lump of paste and a cloth floured 
and tied close; the paste must be removed before sent to 
table. Boil 1^ or 2 hours according to the size ; put a ruffle 
of paper round each, and serve in a napkin, with very hot toast. 
The marrow is spread upon the toast, and seasoned with pepper 
and salt. 

B(EUF A'LA'MODE.-E, R. 

100.— The name of this dish is rather against it, suggesting 
ideas connected with London eating-houses ; but it would be 
very erroneous to suppose that the old family receipts now 
given bear any resemblance to the degenerate successors of those 
cooks who formerly established a reputation for this savoury 
compound. Cut out the bone from the beef; then stufi* the 
orifice with rich force-meat, made with veal and oysters, and 
the crumb of a roll steeped in milk. Half roast it, and before 
it is put into the stewpan insert in the top dried and pickled 
muslu*ooms, adding mushroom-powder in die orifices ; then put 
in 2 quarts of gravy made from the bones and trimmings, a 
large onion stuck with cloves, and 2 carrots cut in slices. 
When the beef has stewed till it is quite tender, strain and 
thicken the sauce ; add to it a glass of wine, mushrooms and 
oysters, and sippets of fried paste ; either the mushrooms or 
oysters may be omitted, if the pure flavour should be more de- 
sirable : warm a few pickles with the garnish and send it up 
very hot. 

Another. — ^Take a part of the rump of beef, or 2 of the ribs, 
boned and rolled, stick it with some whole allspice, whole pep- 
per and cloves, and cover it well with vinegar. Let it remain 
in pickle for 10 days, and then put the whole into a stewpan 
with 2 or 3 bay-leaves ; stew the beef for several hours until 
it is tender ; then strain the gravy, and add that of 2 calves*- 
feet or ox-tail boiled down to a jelly, and nicely seasoned. 
This receipt will only suit persons who are fond of acid 
flavour : it is best eaten cold. 

2%e JBath Receipt, — ^Take 3 lbs. of the rump, or any part 



Chap. Vm.] BEEF. 133 

of the beef which will stew well ; trim it nicely, and cut off all 
the fiit. Chop all sorts of sweet herbs together very finely, with 
a little shalot and a great deal of spice, and put them into a 
saucer that has been rubbed with garlic, and cover them with 
vinegar. Cut &t bacon into long slips, dip it into the herbs 
and vin^ar, and let the herbs be very thick upon the bacon ; 
lard the beef regularly on both sides, if necessary, in order that 
it should be thoroughly flavoured. Rub the bec^ over with the 
ranainder of the herbs and spice. Flour the meat, add a piece 
of butter, the size of a walnut, rolled in flour, and a pint of 
water. Bake the beef in an oven, strain the gravy, which will 
scarcely require either thickening or browning, and serve it up 
with pickles on the top. It is most excellent when cold, but 
should be served up hot at first. The gravy may be boiled 
to a glaze if necessary. It will require a good deal of spice, a 
teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, one of white pepper, a salt- 
spoonful of allspice, half the quantity of pounded cloves, and 
a blade of mace pounded. 

FILLETS OF BEEF, 

101. — Cut the inside of a sirloin or rump in slices \ an inch 
thick ; trim them neatly ; melt a little butter in a saute or 
fiying-pan ; season the fillets ; fry them lightly ; serve with 
tomata-sauce, sorrel, anchovy butter, or gherkin-sauce. 

FILLET OF BEEF BRAISED. 

102. — Take the inside of a sirloin of beef, stufied or plain, 
but rolled together so as to bring the fat into the centre. Then 
strew the bottom of the stewpan with a few slices of ham, in 
which a small quantity of gravy has been put, just to prevent 
the bottom of the pan from burning ; and on this place the 
meat, covering it with chopped carrots, celery, button onions, 
and a pickled chili, together with a sliced gherkin, sweet herbs, 
salt, mace, and a little allspice, and simmer until tender, then 
brown it before the fire or with a salamander, skim and sea- 
son the sauce, and send the meat, sauce, and vegetables up in 
the same dish. 

BEEFSTEAK A LA FRANC AISE 

103. — Must be cut either from the sirloin or some other 
prime part of the beef, as rump steaks are not known in France. 



134 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. Vin. 

Four over it 2 large spoonfuls of the best Lucca oil, and let it 
remain all night ; then put it and the oil into a frying-pan, 
with some finely-chopped parsley, pepper, and salt ; fry it until 
the gravy dries up and it becomes rather brown. Pour the 
contents of the pan over the steak as sauce. The steaks are 
usually garnished with slices of fried potatoes. As butter is 
not known in the southern states of Europe, oil is there con- 
stantly used in lieu of it, and this Parisian practice is borrowed 
from those countries. 

BEEF IN A MARINADE, 

104. — Cut the inside of a sirloin in slices, put them into a 
marinade made as follows : — Take equal quantities of vin^ar 
and water, slice some carrots and onions, add some salt and a 
few pepper-corns with a clove of garlic. Let all stew together 
till the goodness be extracted from the vegetables, then strain 
it, and let it stand till cold. Let the meat lie in this pickle for 
24 hours before it is dressed ; then let it stew gently in a little 
good gravy till quite tender. Add a wineglassful of port wine, 
d^ tablespoonful of mushroom-catsup, a teaspoonful of shalot- 
vinegar, and some butter rolled in flour ; place the meat neatly 
in the dish, and pour the sauce over it. 

BEEF A LA POLONAISE, 

106. — Take a few lbs. of the best beef, without bones, and, 
after having beaten it for some time with a rolling-pin, make 
in it deep incisions, but without cutting the meat asunder. 
Mince some onions, mix them with bread-crumbs, butter, pep- 
per, and salt ; fill the incisions with this forcemeat, and skewer 
up the meat. Put it with some butter into a stewpan, and stew 
it upon a moderate fire. It should be served with brown sauce 
made from the gravy which is drawn from the meat. 

A la Houssard, — Take any piece of fresh beef, prepared as 
near as possible in the same manner ; but instead of forcemeat, 
fill the incisions with pledgets of fat ham or bacon : season with 
pepper, salt, and onion ; lay it in an iron stewpan that has a 
cover to fit quite close, and set it by the side of the fire with- 
out water. Take care it does not burn, but it must have a 
strong heat ; in 2 or 3 hours it will be quite tender, and then 
s&rye with its own gravy. 



BEEF OLn'ES.—E. R. 

106. — Cut some handsome Bteaka, flatten them well with a 
roller, dredge them well with a small quantity of white pepper 
and salt, have some forcemeat made nith the fat and lean of 
veal mixed tc^ether, a small bit of lean ham or bacon, parsley, 
and sweet herbs, with a few bread-crumbs, all beaten in a 
mortar, and mixed with an egg ; lay a little over each steak, 
and roll them up tiglitly, fastening with a skewer ; dip them 
in the yolk of au e^, then in crumbs of bread, and fry them 
of a pale brown ; rolling up each separate steak, and binding 
il together with thread ; dish them with brown sauce, in which 
put a glass of white wine, with some strong gravy, seasoned 
with cayenne. 

A FRICANDEAU OF BEEF. 
107. — Takea nice pieceof lean beef ; lard it with bacon very 
closely ; put it into a stewpan with a pint of broth, a glass of 
white wine, a bmidle of paisley, all sorts of sweet herbs, a clove 
of garlic, a ahalot or two, 4 doves, pepper and salt. When 
the meat is become tender, cover it dose ; skim the sauce well, 
and strain it; set it on the fire, and let it btiil till it is reduced 
to a glaze. Glaze the larded side with this, aad serve the 
meet on sorrel-sauce. 

BEEF RAGOUT.-E. R. 

108, — Fry 2 lbs. of the leg-of-mutton piece until quite brown. 
Pat it into a stewpan with 6 lai^ onions, and pepper it well 
fexn a spicebox of mixed spice : boil water in a frying-pan, 
add it to Uie meat, and let it stew for 4 hours : ^rve it up with 
jnckled walnuts, gherkins, aiid capers, just warmed in the gravy, 

FRICASSEE OF COLD ROAST BEEF. 

109. — Cut very thin slices of underdone beef; chop a hand- 
iul of parsl^ very small, put it with an onion into a stewpan, 
with a piece of butter and a spoonful of flour ; let it fiy ; thea 
add some strong broth ; season with salt and pepper, and sim- 
mo- very gently i of an hour ; then mix into it the yolk of 
2 ^gB, a glass of port wine, and a spoonful of vin^ar ; stir it 
quiddy over the fire a minute or two ; put in the beef; rub the 
diah with shalot, and turn the fiicassee into it. 



136 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. Vm. 

BEEF A LA VINAIGRETTE. 

110. — Cut a slice of underdone beef three inches thiehy and 
a little fat ; stew it in ^ pint of water, a glass of white (not 
sweet) wine, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, and a bay-1^; 
season it with 3 doves pounded and a little pepper ; let it stew 
till the liquor is nearly wasted away, turning it once. When 
cold, serve it. Strain off the gravy, and mix it with a little 
yin^ar for sauce. 

TO MINCE BEEF. 

111. — Shred the underdone part fine, with some of the fiit; 
put into a small stewpan some onion or shalot (a very little 
will do), a little water, pepper, and salt ; boil it till the onion 
is quite soft ; then put some of the gravy of the meat to it, and 
the mince. A few minutes will dress it, but do not let it boil. 
Have a small hot dish with sippets of bread ready, and pour 
the mince into it, but first mix a large spoonful of vinegar with 
it. K shalot-vinegar is used, there will be no need of the onion 
nor the raw shalot. 

" Sanders,^* — Mince beef or mutton small, with onion, pep- 
per, and salt ; add a little gravy, put it into scallop-shells or 
saucers, making them three parts full, and fill them up with 
potatoes mashed with a little cream ; put a bit of butter on the 
top, and brown them in an oven, or before the fire, or with a 
salamander. 

" Cecils. ^^ — Mince any kind of meat, crumbs of bread, a 
good deal of onion, some anchovies, lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg, 
chopped parsley, pepper, and a bit of butter warm, and mix them 
over a fire for a few minutes ; when cool enough, make them up 
into balls of the size and shape of a turkey's e^ ; dip them in 
e^^ and sprinkle with fine crumbs, then fry tiiem of a yellow 
brown ; and serve with gravy as before directed for Beef Olives. 

Minced Beef with Cucumbers. — Take a fine rump-steak 
undressed, and with a sharp knife shred it very fine. Put it 
into a stewpan with a little clarified butter and some salt ; stir 
it over a quick fire for a few minutes, then add i pint of 
good beef gravy ; let it boil gently till it becomes of a proper 
thickness. Cut 2 fine cuciunbers in slices the thickness of a 
crown-piece, and put them with an onion sliced in a stewpan 
with some clarified butter, a little vinegar, a lump of sugar, and 
fry them of a fine brown colour ; put them into a stewpan with 



' €bap. Vni.] BEEF. 137 

some plain sauce ; let it simmer gently till sufficiently done ; 
then lay the mince in thedisii, and pour tlie cueumbers over it ; 
thicken the sauce with a little flour and butter : add the squeeze 
of a lemon just before serving. 

SEEF COLLOFS.—E. B. 

112. — Gut the inside of a sirloin, or any other convenient 
piece, into circular shapes, the size and thickness of a. half- 
crown, flour and fry them ; Bprinkle with pepper, salt, chopped 
parsley, and shalot ; make a little gravy in the pan : send to 
table with gherkin or tomata sauce. 

Or : — Cut tliin slices of beef from the rump, or any other 
tender part, and divide them into pieces 3 inches long; lieat 
them with the blade of a knife, and flour them. Fry the col- 
lops quick in butter 2 minutes ; then lay them into a small stew- 
paa, and cover them with a pint of gravy ; add a bit of butter 
rubbed in flour. 

Or .-—Take 1 lb. of juicy beef, i lb. of suet, and an onion ; 
remove every bit of skin or gristle from the meat, and mince 
it with the onion very finely ; add a little pepper and salt, flour 
the collops, melt a piece of butter in a stewpan, stir in the col- 
lops, adding a little gravy and a spoonful of ketcimp or oyster- 
mace : 10 minutes will be sufficient to dress a pound. 

Or : — Take some lean beef, mince it very small, season it 
with pepper and salt, adding a very small quantity of vinegar; 
press it down in an earthen vessel ; it will keep some i^ys. 
When wanted, take out the necessary quantity, put it into « 
stewpan, with a chopped onion, a spoonful of any sauce, some 
beef gravy, and a piece of butter rolled in flour. Keep stir- 
ring it round until quite hot ; make an edge of chopped vege- 
tables or mashed pobitoes, and put the t>eef in the middle, and 
then send it to table. This is the Scotch mode. 

BEEF PALA TES. 

113. — Simmer them in water several hours, till they will peel ; 
then cut the palates into sUces, or leave them whole, as you 
choose, and stew them in a rich gravy till quite tender. Before 
yon serve, season them with cayenne, salt, and ketchup. If the 
gravy was drawn clear, give it a boil with some butter and flour. 

If to be served wiiite, boil them in milk, and stew them in 
fricaaeee-eauce ; adding cream, butter, flour, and mushroom- 
powder, and a little pounded mace. 



138 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VHI. 

To broil Palates, — ^Peel them and soak them for some time 
m sauce made thus : put a piece of butter rolled in flour into a 
stewpan, with salt, pepper, 2 shalots, a clove, parsley, thyme, 
and a fennel-leaf, with as much milk as will be necessary to 
simmer the palates until tender ; take them out, dip them in 
yolk of Q^^ and bread-crumbs, and broil them slowly. Serve 
them with acid sauce. But if served up with any white sauce, 
they will be found very delicate when merely seasoned with a 
little mace and grating of nutmeg. The best way is to boil 
them in veal-brotii. 

HoUed Palates, — ^Boil 6 palates very gently until they will 
peel, then trim them ; cut the trimmings into small shreds, and 
put them, with a little of the water in which they were boiled, 
a piece of butter rolled in flour, a good seasoning, and a glass 
of white wine, into a small stewpan, and let them stew gently 
till the sauce is very good. Brush the outside of the palates 
with yolk of egg, lay a forcemeat well seasoned over, roll up the 
palates very tightly, and tie them with a string ; put them into 
a stewpan with a piece of butter and a cup of nailk or cream, 
and let them braise gently for 2 hours. When ready, lay the 
ragoiit of trinm[iings upon a dish, squeeze lemon-juice over it, 
lay the rolled palates on the top, and garnish with pickles, and 
egg, and forcemeat-balls. 

To fry Palates, — Parboil them, split them in two, spread 
upon them some good forcemeat made of pounded meat, and 
roll them up like an olive ; then dip them in batter made of the 
yolks of eggs, flour, a spoonful of oil, and a glass of white wine, 
which must be added a very little at a time : the batter should 
be a little thicker than very thick cream : fry them of a good 
colour. Or, cut the palates the size of a crown-piece ; after 
they have been dressed soak them for an hour in lemon-juice or 
vinegar pickle ; dip them in the batter, and fry them. 

Another, and a very good way, is to skewer them at a little 
distance from each otiier after having dipped them in yolk of 
egg and bread-crumbs, and fry them before the fire in the small 
toasting machine for grillades. 

Palais de Poeuf, en Sauce hlanche, — Clean and stew the 
palates till they can be skinned ; then, while hot, throw them 
into cold water for an hour ; having prepared the following 
sauce, simmer them very slowly in it till perfectly tender. 
Put into a stewpan 4 oz. of lean veal, the same of lean bacon. 



Chap. Till.] BEEF. 139 

the outrides being removed, 2 oz. of fiit bacon, the same of 
butter, the thin riud of half a lemon, and, the white pee) being 
removed, the remainder sliced, a tey-leaf or two, 1 clove, 1 
union, and a carrot sliced thin, with as much water as will just 
cover them ; keep the pan closely stopped, and simmer till the 
gravy be much reduced, stirring it often ; add some good 
broth, salt, and 'white pepper ; skua it, and dress the palates 
therein. 

Just before serving mii in the yolk of a new-laid e^ over 
the fire, but the sauce must not boil. 

A la Mariette. — Boil 3 palates in water for an hour, peel 
them and cut them in two, lengthways ; put a slice of pickled 
pork between eacli, tie them ti^cthcr, put them into a stewpan 
with broth or mUk and water, and a piece of butler rolled in 
flour, salt, whole pepper, a fag^t of sweet herbs, and a clove [ 
stew them for some time, then skim and strain the sauce, 
thickeo it, and serve it up very white. 

BEEF KIDJfEY—E. R. 

114. — ^ After taking off the skin and fat, cut the kidney mlo 
slices, season and brown it in the frying-pan ; then put it into 
water boiled in the pan, whicli must be floured, and let it stew 
gently for some time. It wiU be very rich and tender, but 
cannot be considered a delicacy, and should be well peppered, 
as well as eaten wiUi mustard and garlic, or shalot vinegar. 

To mince a rate Berf Kidney. — Chop some parsley and a 
little shalot, mix it with the meat, seasoning it with pepper 
and salt, dredge a little flour over it, and put it into a stewpan 
with some butter ; let it stew until tender, then add a tea- 
cupful of rich gravy and a glass of wine. Or, o/Jer it has been 
drtMied, with a anall quantity of bacon or other fat, chop a 
little thyme with a bunch of parsley, pepper, and salt ; mix 
it all tc^^ether, with a little thin melted butter ; lay it upon 
toeat, stew bread-crumbs over the top, and brown them in a 
DDtch oven. 

To make Rissoles of Kidney. — Cut the cold kidney into 
small dice, with a third part of bacon, and 1 or 2 hard-boiled 
eg^ according to the quantity, also cut into dice ; season it 
well, bind it ti^jether with yolk of eg^ beaten up in a little 
melted butter, dip them in butter, or roll them in bread-crumbs, 
and frj them.

CHAPTER IX. 



MUTTON. 

The most approved joints of mutton are the haunch and saddle. 
The saddle is generally looked upon as preferable, though the 
haunch is the most sul^tantial. 

HAUNCH OF MUTTON ROASTED. 

116. — It will require to be kept for some time, and must 
therefore be well washed with vinegar, wiped every day, and, 
if necessary, rubbed with pounded pepper and ginger. Stick 
some cloves in the knuckle, and, 24 hours before it is put upon 
the spit, having thoroughly dried and wiped it clean, lay it in 
a pan, and pour as much port wine over it as will serve to 
soak it, turning it frequently, so that every part shall equally 
imbibe the wine. 

Cut off the knuckle rather close to the joint of the leg ; nick 
the cramp-bone, and that will allow the cushion or thick part 
of the leg to draw up and be more plump ; trim off the iMck 
skin at the flank, and round off the comer of the fat, so as to 
make the joint appear neat. Cover the fat with oiled paper, 
which should be taken off i hour before you think it will be 
done ; then dredge the meat very lightly with flour, and sprinkle 
it freely with salt ; serve it up with currant jelly, and a sauce 
of port wine, spice, and gravy ; a piece of fringed paper being 
tied neatly around the shank-bone. To roast a haunch of 14 
or 16 lbs. will take from 3 to 3J^ hours ; or even a little more 
if the weather be very cold, or if required to be " very well 
done." 

To make it taste like Venison. — Let the haunch hang nearly 
the usual time; then take the skin carefully off, and rub the 
meat with olive-oil, then put it into a pan with a quantity of 
whole pepper, 4 cloves of garlic, a bundle of sweet herbs, 
consisting of parsley, thyme, sweet marjoram, and 2 bay- 



UP, IX.] MUTTON. 141 

ATQB. Pour upon the meat a pint of good vin^ar and 8 or 
tebleBpoonfbb of olive-oil. Cover the upper sur&ce of the 
aeat with sliceB of raw onion, and turn the mutton every day, 
Jways taking care to put the slices of onion on the top sur&ce. 
At the expiration of 4 days, take the meat out, wipe it with a 
napkin, and hang it up in a oool place till the next day, when 
it 18 fit fi)r roasting. 

A more simple method is to rub it every day, and let it hang 
untQ it IS tender. A dove or two of garlic in the knuckle 
win, however, give it a much higher flavour, if put into the 
knnekle when me haunch is hung up. 

SADDLE OF MUTTON— E. B. 

116. — Is fi>nned of the 2 loins, and is also called " the chine." 
This jmnt should be well hung and well roasted ; but requires 
xalfaer less time hanging than the haunch. Bub the part dose 
found the tail with stdt, after first cutting out ihe kemeL 
Wipe it, as well as all other meats, daily, but do not take them 
into a waim kitchen to do it. Take out the fiit horn the 
inside, and also the kidneys : some cooks split the tail, and 
skewer the pieces back in a ring on either side ; but it is an 
unnecessary and rather vulgar practice. Sprinkle the mutton 
with salt, dredge it with flour, and send it up finely frothed. 
Stewed lentils or haricot beans are frequently served round 
this joint. 

If the joint be firequently sponged, or well wetted a few times 
with port wine, and then hung up in the air to dry, it will be 
found an admirable improvement, as well as to the haunch ; 
both should, however, be kept until quite tender. 

The saddle should be well basted while roasting; it will 
take 2 or 2i hours, according to the size. 

SADDLE OF MUTTON A LA PORTUOAI8E. 

117. — ^An excellent way to use up port-wine bottoms is the 
following : — ^Take 2 quarts of port-wine bottoms or lees, a pint 
of vinegar, and a pint of stock ; shred 6 or 8 shalots, 3 onions, 
2 carrots, and 6 turnips, a spoonful of allspice, a dozen cloves, 
and as many bay-leaves. Make this boiling hot, and pour it 
over a saddle of mutton, having first cut ofi* the tail dose, 
trinmied off the superfluous fiit from the top, and also the flaps. 
Turn it every morning and evening for 4 or 5 days. Spit if 
and cover it with a buttered paper, and roast for 2 or 3 hours 



142 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IX. 

according to its size. It will require longer than usual to 
roast, and will be quite black, but the flavour will be delicious. 
When nearly done, remove the paper. Strain a little of the 
liquor for sauce, adding some gravy and currant jelly to it. 

8H0 ULDER OF MUTTON— E, R. 

118. — ^May be dressed in various ways, but the most usual is 
to roast it nicely, and send it up with onion sauce. 

It is an unsightly joint, and therefore rarely brought to 
genteel tables ; but the appearance may be improved by cutting 
off the knuckle, when it may be called a shield ; and, as to 
flavour, it has more difierent sorts of meat in the various cuts 
than the leg. 

The bone may also be taken out, and the mutton stufled ; 
but in that case the grill of the blade-bone will be sacrificed, 
which, when broiled, is an admirable adjunct to the breakfast- 
table. A small shoulder cut into a good shape, boned and 
stufled, is very good baked. It is frequently served up(m a 
Yorkshire pudding. 

Salted and boiled, — ^Bone it ; if large take 4 oz. of common 
salt, the same quantity of coarse sugar, mixed with a dessert- 
spoonful of pounded cloves, half that quantity of pepper, a 
little pounded mace and ginger; rub them well into the 
mutton, turning it every day for a week ; then roll it up tight, 
and boil it gently for 3 or 4 hours in a quart of water, wiSi a 
carrot, turnip, onion, and a bunch of sweet herbs. Serve it 
with some of its own gravy, thickened and highly flavoured, or 
with any piquant sauce ; or served up smothered with onions. 
This is very convenient to families who kill their own mutton. 
Members of the Yacht Club, or captains of ships are recom- 
mended, when they have fresh mutton, to tow it overboard fot 
some hours, and then lay it up in the shrouds. It will then be 
coated with briny particles, which will effectually keep in all 
the juicas. 

BREAST OF MUTTON. 

119. — The brisket changes first in the breast : and if it is to 
be kept, it is best to rub it with a little salt, should the weather 
be hot. 

Cut off* the superfluous fat, joint it well, and roast, and serve 
it with stewed cucumbers ; or to eat cold sprinkle it well with 
chopped parsley while roasting. 



CHiP. IX.J MUTTON. 143 

Or : — Soae it, take off a good deal of the iat, and cover it 
with bread, herbs, and seasoning ; then roll aud boil till tender : 
serve with toinata-sauce or sorrel. 

Or : — Stew it with all the usual kinds of v^etables and a 
little curry powder ; or boue tkud roll it. 

Or : — Cut olf the fat, aud half boil it ; tate out the bones, 
and beat the breast flat ; season it witii pepper and salt ; brush 
it over witli the yolk of an ^g, and strew over it minced 
pandey and green ouiong, mixed with crumbs of bread ; bafite 
it well with fi-eEh butter, and broil it in a Dutch oven. Serve 
with slewed cucumber or sauce Bobert. 

LEG OF MUTTON ROASTED.— E. R. 

120. — A leg of mutton intended for roasting should be kqjt 
longer than for boiliiig ; it should be carefullj attended to • 
during- the time it is hung up, coDstaiitlj- wiped to prevent any 
mustiness gathering on the top and below the flap, and in hot 
weather lightly dusted with flour or pepper to keep ofi' the flies. 
The kernel in the fat on the thick part of the leg should be 
taken out by the butcher, for it taints first there ; and the 
bloody part of the neck should also be cut off when first 
brought in. 

If the weather should be cold, hang the nuittnii for ?, weeks. 
9ionld the weather not admit of its hanging so long, put it 
into a pan, and cover it with coarse brown si^;ar, turning it 
every day ; and when to be roasted, remove the skin, and wrap 
it ap in oiled paper. This process will cause it to be very 
toider and juicy. Remove the thick skin very carefully ; trim 
off the jnece of flank that adheres to the &t, and flatten tiie &t 
with a cutlet-beater or chopper ; cut off the knuckle, and nick 
the cTiimp-bone, to allow it to become more plump, as in the 
haunch. Put a little salt and water into the drippii^pan to 
bute the meat at first ; but then use only its own gravy. 
Serve with jelly. 

A 1^ of mutton is usually roasted whole, but can be divided 
advantageously for a small &mily. Cut the knuckle into a 
good-sized joint, and boil it until tender ; but put a coarse 
paste over the lower part of the thick end to keep in the gravy, 
and roast it : or if the skin be raised gently from the out^de of 
tbe I^, to about 6 or 7 inches wide, 2 or 3 good slices may 
be cut off for steaks, and the skin then fiistened down with 
ikewos. 



144 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IX. 



LEO OF MUTTON BOILED. 

121. — ^Let the joint be kept until it is tender, but not so long 
as for roasting, as mutton for boiling will not look of a good 
colour if it has hung long. 

To prepare a leg of mutton for boiling, trim it as for 
roasting ; soak it for a couple of hours in cold water ; then put 
only water enough to cover it, and let it boil gently for 3 
hours if of the largest size, and, if smaller, according to its 
weight. Some cooks boil it in a cloth ; but if the water be 
afterwards wanted for soup, that should not be done, as it 
would be no longer fit for that purpose: some salt and an 
onion put into it is far better. When nearly ready, take it 
from the fire, and, keeping the pot well cover«i, let it remain 
in the steam for 10 or 15 minutes. 

The English taste being in favour of meat in which the 
gravy has been retained, this joint is esteemed to be in perfec- 
tion when a little underdone. It is sent to table with caper- 
sauce and mashed turnips. 

To stuff a Leg of Mutton, — ^Take a leg of mutton, cut off 
all the fat, take the bone carefully out and preserve the skin 
whole; take out the meat and mince it fine, and mix and 
mince with it about 1 lb. of fat bacon and some parsley ; season 
the whole well with pepper and salt, and a small quantity of 
eschalot or chives chopped fine ; then put the meat into the 
skin and sew it up neatly on the under side ; tie it up in a 
cloth and put it into a stewpan with 2 or 3 slices of veal, some 
sliced carrots and onions, a bunch of parsley, and a few slices 
of fiit bacon ; let it stew for 3 or 4 hours, and draiia the liquor 
through a fine sieve ; when reduced to a glaze, glaze the mutton 
with it and serve in stewed French beans. 

To dress a Leg of Mutton with Oysters, — ^Parboil some fine 
well-fed oysters, take off the beards and horny parts ; put to 
them some parsley, minced onion, and sweet herbs, boiled and 
chopped fine, and the yolks of 2 or 3 hard-boiled eggs. Mix 
all together, and cut 5 or 6 holes in the fleshy part of a leg of 
mutton, and put in the mixture ; and dress it in either of the 
following ways : — Tie it up in a cloth and let it boil gently 2^ 
or 3 hours, according to the size. 

Or : — Braise it, and serve with a pungent brown sauce. 



I^ECK OF MUTTON 

122. — ^Isparticularl}' useful, as nmny dishes may be made of il. 
The best end of ttie neck m^iy be bailed for 1 ^ hour, and served 
iritb turnips; or roasted; dressed iu steaks; iu pies; a-la- 
Turc ; or en haricot. 

The sm-ag may be stewed ijito broth ; or with a small quan- 
liQ' of water, some small onions, a few peppercorns, and a little 
rice, and served together. 

When a neck is to be boiled to look particularly nice, saw 
down the chine-bone, strip the ribs half-way down, chop 
off the ends of the bones about 4 inches, and turn the flap 
under. The skin should not be taken off till boiled, and then 
the &t will remain white. The neck is very commonly divided, 
the " scra^' being boiled for broth, and the remaining part 
either roasted or cut into chop.t ; but, if boiled together, the 
KTOg will require rather more stewing than the other part to 
make it tender. If only slightly salted, for 2 or 3 days, the 
fill will be BO much improved as to become Arm and appear 

[ darified ; and the mode which we recommend for dressing the 

kjrant ia thus : — 

' Boil the neck very gently nntil it is nearly done enough ; 
then, 4- an hour or 20 minutes before serving, cover it thickly 
with bread-crumbs and sweet herbs chopped, with a little 
drawn butter or the yolk of an e^, and put it into a Dutch 
lyiea before the fire. By this process the meat will taste much 
better than if merely roasted or boiled ; the dryness attendant 
upiHi roasting will be removed, and the disagreeable greasiness 
vliich boiled meat — mutton especially — «xhibits, will utterly 
dinppear. Too mudi cannot be said in favour of this method 
of draesing the neck and breast of mutton, for the liquor they 
have be^i boiled in, if stewed with peas, will make a very 
good Boup. 

LOIN OF MUTTON ROASTED. 

123. — Take off the skin and some of the fit ; joint it, and 
skewer it from the flap into the fillet ; then put the spit through 
the chump, and the skewer at the thin end will secure the joint 
in its place ; roast for \\ hour. 

For a small &mily the loin should be divided, and the 
dimnp eod, if boiled, will make fine broth ; and the ribs may 
be either plainly roasted, or dressed precisely as above. The 
fltwti is, however, richer than that of the neck, and many prefer 



146 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IX. 

the latter as being more delicate ; chops or Cotelets de Mouton 
are, in Paris, always taken from the neck. 

To stew a Loin of Mutton, — Bone a loin of well-hmig 
mutton ; take off the skin, and remove the &,t from the inside ; 
put it into a stewpan, with broth enough to cover it, and let it 
stew gently till it becomes of a good brown colour ; add a glass 
of port wine, a large spoonful of mushroom ketchup, and some 
vegetables cut in shapes, or stewed haricot beans. 

MUTTON-CHOPS 

124. — Should be taken from the loin, from ^ to f inch thick. 
They should not be put on the gridiron until everything else 
is ready to be served ; have a clear cinder fire to broil them ; 
if the fat falling from them should cause a blaze, remove the 
gridiron for a moment, and strew a handful of salt over the 
fire ; they should be kept continually turned ; the greater part 
of the chine-bones should be chopped off; cut off a good deal 
of the fat, but do not pepper or flour the chops ; and serve 
them immediately they are done, one at a time. 

HARICO T OF MUTTON.— E, R, 

125. — Cut a neck or loin of mutton into thin chops ; flour 
and fry them brown in a small quantity of butter ; drain them 
on a sieve, then put them into a stewpan, and cover them with 
gravy ; add a carrot, 2 leeks, a faggot of parsley and thyme, 2 
or 3 blades of mace, some allspice, a whole onion, and 2 tur- 
nips ; stew them until the meat is tender ; then take out the 
chops, strain the gravy, and skim off all the fat ; put a little 
butter mixed with flour into the stewpan ; stir it until melted 
and made quite smooth, adding the gravy by degrees, stirring 
all the time ; then put in the chops, with some carrots and 
turnips ready blanched and cut into pretty shapes, with a 
dozen silver onions whole, and also half boiled ; season slightly 
with pepper and salt, a very little soy, and a teaspoonful of 
Tarragon vinegar ; stew the whole gently for i of an hour, 
and serve them while quite hot. 

Another, — Cut from the neck 8 or 10 cutlets, leaving the 
bones short, and taking off some of the fat ; fry them in 2 
oz. of butter till of a light brown ; add a tablespoonful of 
flour, mix it well, and put in a quart of water ; cut 2 dozen 



tfcuj. IX.] MUTTON. 147 

EtUe balls of turnip with a. round scoop, and as many pieces 
of carrot and tlie same number of small onions, witli a. little 
farsley and a couple of bay-leaves. Put i oz. of pounded 
'jngar into a slewpan ; wiien melted, add 2 oz. of butter and 
ihe vegetables, which keep tossing over the fire till covered 
-«ith a kind of glaze ; put them into the stewpan with the cut- 
JbIb ; let them simmer till the vegetables are done, skim well, 
place the cutlets in a crown on the dish, put the vegetables in 
Qte centre, and pour the gravy over them. 

A scores BAGOIS.-E. R. 

136. — Take the stomach of a sheep ; wash it with cold water 
^UUi] perfectly clean ; then turn it inside out, scald it, scrape 
% irith a knife quickly, and then put it into cold salt and 
•wVber tiU wanted. Take the liver, lights, and heart, and pai^ 
boil them; grate the liver, and mince the other parts quite 
fine ; mince also i lb. of suet, 3 or 4 onions, toast i lb. of 
round oatmeal-cakes before the fire, and pound them into 
INTwder, which is to be thickly sprinkled over the mince; mix 
iHjUwell together; season with pepper and salt; then fill the 
Ing, and before sewing it up put in a large teacupful of any 
kind of strong brolli or eravy. Put the Img, neatly sewed up, 
in a pan with enough of boiling water to cover it, and a small 
plate under it ; prick over with a needle to prevent it bursting, 

' let it boil 4 or 5 hours, keeping the hag^^ constantly 
' with boiling water. 

The Englith mode is — To mince the heart, the tongue, the 
kidnqrs, and a part of the liver of the sheep, with a third of 
its we%ht in fat bacon, 2 anchovies chopped small, and the 
cnunb of a penny-roll grated, asaltspoonful of grated lemon- 
peel, pepper, salt, 2 <^;s beaten, and a glass of wine ; i"ix all 
wdl tog«ther ; butter a mould ; put in tiie mixture, and let it 
boil for 2 hours : or it may be boiled in a veal caul. 

TO STEW MUTTON. 
127. — Cut Bome slices rather thick out of any part of mut- 
ton ; put them into a stewpan with some pepper and salt, on 
onion or two, a sliced carrot, and a little eschalot ; cover the 
steaks with broth, and let them stew from 20 minutes to J an 
boor, but not longer, or they will become hard; cover the 
■tewpan close, and when the steaks are about half-done turn 
-Li 



148 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IX. 

them. Before serving, add a little butter rolled in flour, and 
a spoonful or two of mushroom-catsup. 

Or : — Cut some slices from an underdone leg of mutton, and 
put them into a saucepan to sinmier with i pint of good gravy, 
a teaspoonful of white sugar pounded, a small quantity of 
onion minced, a teacupful of port wine, some pepper and salt, 
and 2 or 3 cloves. This dish should not be allowed to simmer 
more than 5 or 6 minutes. 

AN IRISH STEW, 

128. — Cut rather thick chops from the loin; when the 
square ends of the bones are cut off, half a dozen will probably 
weigh a couple of pounds ; lay them in an iron pot, and put 
double the quantity of sliced potatoes, placed in layers, with 
the chops, and half a dozen small onions, with about a quart 
of water ; cover the pan closely, and let them stew on a mode- 
rate fire for 2 hours, or until the potatoes have become nearly 
a mash, and absorbed all the water and gravy of the meat ; 
the chops will then be found very tender, and the potatoes 
rich with the fat. The stew should be eaten hot, but without 
any kind of sauce. 

TO HASH MUTTON. 

129. — Cut very thin slices from any joint of mutton that 
has been roasted. Take some onions, slice them, and put them 
with a piece of butter into a stewpan ; fry them ; then add 2 
large spoonfuls of good gravy, and let them stew for about 10 
minutes ; then put the meat into the sauce, with a spoonful of 
walnut-ketchup, a little browning, and lemon-pickle. Let it 
boil for 3 or 4 nmiutes ; shake it over the fire, season it with 
salt and cayenne pepper, and serve it quite hot, without 
thickening the sauce. Garnish with red cabbage. 

If the meat has been boiled^ cut the slices rather thick, and 
use broth sufficient to make rather more sauce than for the 
roast ; take mushroom instead of walnut ketchup ; season with 
salt, white pepper, mace, and chopped parsley; add a few 
capers or a minced gherkin, and serve with sippets of bread 
fried in butter. 

A glass of wine may be employed, very cautiously, so as 
only to impart a slight flavour : port for the roast, and white 
wine for the boiled. 



130. — For the Loin. — Keep it till it is tender, bone it, and 
lay upon it a seasoning of peppe^, mace, and a clove pounded. 
Beat the meat, eover it wili a stuffing- an for hare, and tie it 
round with string. It will take 2J hours to roast, if it be 
lai^e. 3Ial(e gravy of the bones and a little ham or bacon, 
and dear it well from the fat ; add a little port wine, and 
serve up the mutton with currant-jelly. 

Or: — Skin, bone, and roll it; put to it a pint of water, a 
piece of butter, 3 tablespoonfiJs of vinegar, an onion, and a 
bunch of sweet-herbs ; let it stew gently for 3 houw, strain 
the gravy, and add to it a glass of port wine ; serve it up with 
venison -sauce. 

For Breast of Mutton. — Bone it ; take bread-crumba and 
parsley chopped fine, grated lemon-peel, ground mace, cloves, 
nutmeg, and salt ; mix them together, egg- the mutton, theu 
ahake the crumbs over it, and roll it up very tight and bind it 
ivith twine. Baste it witli butter until it is wasted, and put a 
rich brown sauce under it in the dish ; serve it with wine-sauce. 

Shoulder of Mutton may be rolled and treated in the same 
manner, taking care not to injure the skin. It may also be 
dther stewed, roaated, or baked. 

Ti) itew Shoulder of Mutton. —Cnt off the joint of the knuckle, 
take out the blade-bone, and trim the shoulder into a hand- 
some form ; break the bone, and stew it for some time in 
wster yrith the knuckle aiid trimmings; stuff the shoulder 
with good forcemeat, draw it into a round shape by severing 
the onder part, put a little butter into a stewpan, melt it, 
and brown the mutton by turning it in the frying butter ; 
then dre%e it with flour, put some of the broth made with 
the bones into the stewpan, with an onion, and let it stew 
until the meat is quite tender. Serve it up with pickles 
warmed in the sauce. 

Or with Oysters. — Hang it some days, then salt it well for 
2 days ; bone it, and sprinkle it with pepper and a bit of mace 
pounded ; lay some oysters over it, and roll the meat up tight 
and tie H ; stew it in a small quantity of water, with an onion 
and a few peppercorns, tUl quite tender. 

Bave ready a little good gravy, and some oysters stewed

in it ; thicken this with flour and butter, and pour over the 
mutton when the tape is taken off. The stewpan should be 
kept closely covered. 

LEG OF MUTTON BRAISED.— E. R. 

131. — Take a very small leg of mutton, cut off the knuckle, 
and trim it nicely ; half roast it ; then put it into a stewpan 
with the knuckle-bone broken, the trimmings, a few slices of 
fat bacon or 2 oz. of butter, an onion stuck with cloves, and a 
bimdle of sweet herbs. Shake the stewpan over the fire until 
there is gravy enough from the meat and the trinunings to 
stew the mutton, and take care to turn it in the braise. When 
very tender, take it up, remove the fat from the gravy, strain 
it, and boil it quickly until it is reduced to a glaze ; pour it 
over the mutton, and serve it up with a puree of vegetables 
beneath. 

MUTTON KESOSBED. 

132. — Take all the fat out of a loin of mutton, and that on 
the outside also if very fat, and remove the skin ; cut it into 
steaks ; mix a small nutmeg grated with a little salt and 
pepper, crumbs, and herbs ; dip the steaks into the yolks of 3 
eggs, and sprinkle the above mixture all over them; thai 
place the steaks together as they were before they were cut 
asunder, tie them, and fasten them on a small spit; roast 
them at a quick fire ; set a dish under, and baste them with a 
good piece of butter and the liquor that comes from the meat, 
but throw some more of the above seasoning over. When 
done enough, take it up, and lay it in a dish ; have i pint 
of good gravy ready besides that in the dish, and put into it 
2 spoonfuls of ketchup, and rub down a teaspoonful of flour 
with it ; give this a boil, and pour it over the mutton, but 
first skim off the fat. Mind to keep the meat hot, tiU the 
gravy is quite ready. 

En hochepoL — Cut a neck or loin of mutton into chops, and 
pare off the fat ; put them into a jar with a lettuce cut into 
quarters, 2 or 3 turnips and carrots, 2 cucumbers quartered, 
4 or 5 onions, and pepper and salt ; cover the jar closely, and 
plunge it into a kettle of boiling water ; allow it to boil 4 
hours, keeping the kettle well supplied, taking care that the 
vater does not come over the top of the jar ; take it out of the 



Chap. K.] MUTTON. 151 

jar, and aerve it very hot. Green peas or any other vegetables 
may be added. 

Au tCAlmoi/se ia Turkish. Take 1 lb. of the tender part 
of a loin of mutton, chop the lean and the fat together very 
small. Boil 2 oz. of rice very tender, mix it with the meat 
while warm, then season the whole with the juice of half an 
onion, a small quantity of pepper and salt, and the yolk and 
white of ail egg ; make the mixture into balls. Take sufficient 
quantity of viue-leavee, boil them till tliey are quite tender. 
Mid wrap lip the balls in them. Put the balls into a small 
quantity of mutton-broth, stew tliem 1^- hour over a slow fire, 
then take them out of the stewpaii, and thicken the gnivy with 
the yolk of au eg^ and a little cream j season with pepper 
and salt, squeeze the juice of a lemon over tlie balk, and 
serve ttiem up with the sauce over them, which will be 

For a Mutton Pilau. — Take i lb. of the neek of mutton; 
buil it weU ; boil also 2 cups of rice, the same as ibr curry. 
Cut the boiled mutton into small pieces, and &y it in butter; 
then add it and the rice with the butter, a few cloves, a little 
finnamon, anil pome cardamoms ; let the whole simmer for \ 
an liour. In dishing it, put a little rice at the bottom of the 
dish, the meat in the centre ; cover it over with the remainder 
of the rice, and scatter the spice on the top. 

A CAMP DISH. 
1S3. — Take any joint of mutton, put it into a pot with a 
good many onions cut small, and as many vegetables as can 
be obtained to add to it ; 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 5 of 
port wine ; season it with black and red pepper ; add a spoon- 
ful of flour, and, if at hand, 4 dessertspoonfuls of Harvey's 
■aoce and essence of anchovies. Cover the meat with water, 
and let it stew li hour ; it should be stirred frequently to pre- 
vent it &om burning, as there should be only water suffident 
to cook it. Should there be a steam-apparatus do not add the 
water. This is an excellent dish in camp, and it also suits a 
bmily where there are many persons to be fed from one joint. 
A fowl may be added to or substituted for the mutton.

leg, and some of the fat ; put 2 onions, a lettuce, a pint of 
green peas, a teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of pepper, 4 
spoonfuls of water, and 2 or 3 oz. of clarified butter, into a 
stewpan closely covered ; simmer 2 hours, and serve in the 
middle of a dish of boiled dry rice. If cayenne is approved, 
add a little. This cannot be done too slowly. 

MINCED MUTTON,— E. JB. 

136. — ^Mince dressed meat very finely, season it, make a 
very good gravy, warm the meat up in it, and serve with fried 
bread round the dish, or with poached eggs. 

Or : — Mince cold leg of mutton freed from the skin and fiit, 
warm it with stewed cucumbers, taking care that it does not 
bum after the meat is put in. 

Au Gratin, or as Scallops. — Mince dressed mutton with a 
very little fat, season lightly with pepper and salt, and put 
into scallop-shells about half full. Then put potatoes mashed 
with a little milk, and a very small bit of butter ; smooth with 
a spoon, and brown in a Dutch oven. 

As Rissoles, — Enclose the minced meat in a paste or brown- 
ing of eg^ and crumbs of bread, but season it as if for force- 
meat. 

MUTTON CUTLETS,— E. B. 

136. — Cut the best end of a neck of mutton into cutlets i an 
inch thick, and chop each bone short ; flatten and trim them, 
scraping the end of the bone quite clean ; brush them with 
egg, and cover them with crumbs, herbs, and seasoning ; and 
serve them either with sauce tomdte or any other piquant 
sauce. 

If in the Hindostanee fashion, cut the chops from the neck, 
pare away all the fat, and scrape the bone ; then have some 
very fine mashed potatoes ; wrap the cutlets in it ; brush them 
over with yolk of egg, and fry them. They may also be fried 
in the same manner, dipped in batter. 

With Potato Puree. — The cutlets should be dipped in cla- 
rified butter, then in crumbs, afterwards in yolk of egg, and 
again in crumbs ; flatten them with a knife, and fry in hot fat 
as you would fish. The potatoes are to be boiled, rubbed 
through a hair-sieve, and worked up fine and light with a little 
butter and boiling cream; season with pepper, salt,* and an 




atom of outm^; dish the cutlets round this pur^, which 
must be softer tfaaji mashed potatoes. An excellent dish for 
luncheoD. 

For CoUkttes de Mmtan en Ragout.— Take off all the &t 
from the cutlets, dredg-e the meat with flour, and put them into 
a stewpan with the fat melted, a bundle of sweet herbs, and 2 
dialots mineed ; let them brown, then strain the gravy, add 
a glass of wine, ajid I of Reading sauce ; thicken, if ne- 
cessary, with a little rous, and let the whole stew until very 
tender. 

To dress CStelettes de Moutmt a la Polonaise. — Remove all 
the &t, put the meat into a covered stewpan, with a carrot and 
a turnip sliced, 2 
onions, a bundle 
of sweet herbs, 
a little pepper 
and salt, and 
enough broth to 
moisten the 

whole ; let it 

n«w«err gently M.tu. Cuil.i.. 

until the meat is 

perfectly done, then take it out, strain the gravy, pot it over a 
brisk fire, and reduce it to a giaze ; then cover the cutlets 
with the glaze, and serve them up with tomata-sauce, or a 
vegetable puree of any kind. 

For Coteleiies a la Mamlenon. — Cut and trim cutlets from 
a neck or loin of mutton , chop very finely a quantity of 
parsley, a little thyme, and a shalot ; put them with butter 
into a stewpan, and fry the chops a little; then take out the 
chops ; allow them to cool ; add to the herbs some fresh 
parsley chopped and a few crumbs of bread, and seasoning ; 
spread this over the cutlets with a knife, wrap them in but- 
tered paper, and broil them over a slow tire. Serve a sauce 
piquant in a boat 

Or :^Cut them hand'-omely from the loin or back end of the 
neck ; half fry them, and then eover them with herbs, crumbs 
of bread, and seaaoning, lay this on very thickly and put 
them into a ■-tewpan with a little gravy; stew until tender, 
then wrap them in wntmg-paper, and finish them on the 
gridiron. 



154 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IX. 

Colelettes aux Haricots verts, — ^Having dressed French beans 
as usual, drain the water from them, and simmer them with 
pepper and salt in a good piece of butter. A few minutes 
before serving add the beaten yolk of an ^g, and shake the pan 
over the fire ; but they must not boil. la the mean time have 
ready 3 mutton-cutlets, neatly trimmed, seasoned with pepper, 
salt, and a few crumbs, and nicely fried ; and serve them on the 
French beans. 

Scrags of Mutton a la Sainte Men^hould, — Order the nar- 
row part of a neck of small mutton to be cut off before the 
sheep be divided ; which leaves the two scrags united. Soak in 
warm water, then hang it 2 days ; lay it in a stewpot, with 
slices of fat bacon over and under, 2 lbs. of scrag of veal, 3 
large carrots, 3 onions, a large bunch of sweet herbs, 2 bay- 
leaves, and a tablespoonful of whole white pepper ; cover the 
whole with beef-broth, and simmer 4 hours. Drain the gravy 
from the meat, which cover on all sides with crumbs of bread 
mixed with pepper and salt, and brown it with a salamander. 
In the mean time boil the gravy, uncovered, very quickly, 
having strained it first, and serve in the dish : add salt. Serve 
in the dish endive, tomata-sauce, or stewed spinach. 

MUTTON KIDNEYS.— E. R. 

137. — Split, pepper, and broil them, broiling the cut side 
first, which will make a cup for the gravy when the outer part 
is turned to the fire. Chop some parsley very fine, mix it well 
with a little fresh butter, the juice of a lemon, pepper and salt, 
and put a little on each. A sheep's heart may be split open, 
and broiled in the same way. 

With a very sharp knife cut mutton kidneys in the thinnest 
possible slices ; flour, and fiy quickly till they are quite crisp. 
While frying, add pepper and salt. Serve them in a good 
gravy, to which a bit of garlic has given a very slight 
flavour. 

RognonSy au Vin de Champagne, — Slice or mince them, 
and fry them with a little chopped parsley and eschalot until 
they become of a light brown, seasoning them with pepper and 
salt; then dust them with flour, moisten them with a little 
strong gravy and a glass of Champagne, and let them stew for 
a few moments. 



SHEBfS TAILS AND KIDNEYS.— E. R. 

\3S. — Cut the tails, boil them for 15 minutes, then put them 
into a stevrpau with ■{■ pint of gravy, an onion stuck with 
clovte, a little salt, and cayenne pepper. Stew till tender, 
strain the gravy, thicken it with flour and butt«r, and odd the 
juice of i a lemon. Boil until the whole ia very smooth, broil 
half a dozen kidney?, and place them in the middle of a dish 
with the tails and sauce round. 

These are the most tasty modes, but kidneys, when meant 
for breakfast, are usually broiled upou tlie gridiron, without 
parsley or lemou ; being only split open, well peppered, and a. 
bit of butter put upon them when broiled. They must not be 
much done, and may be brought to the table in less than 10 
minutes. If not quite hot, they are not worth eating. 

MUTTON RUMPS AND KIDNEYS. 

139.' — Sttw 6 rumps in some good mutton-gravy ^ an 
hour; then take them up, and let them stand to cool. Clear 
the gravy &om the iat ; and put into it 4 oz. of boiled rice, an 
onion stuck with cloves, and a blade of mace ; boil them till 
tlie rice is thick. Wash (lie rumps with yolks of eggs well 
beaten ; and strew over them crumbs of bread, a little pepper 
and salt, chopped parsley and thyme, and grated lemon-peeL 
Fry in butter of a fine brown, Wbile the rumpa are stewing 
laiti the kidneys, and put them to roast in a Dutch oven. 
When the rumps are fried, the grease must be drained before 
they are put on the dish, and, the pan being cleared likewise 
from the Iat, warm the rice in it. Lay the latter on the dish ; 
the rumps put round on the rice, the narrow ends towards the 
middle, and the kidneys between. Garnish with hard eggs cut 
in half, the white being left on ; or with different coloured 
inckles. 

SHEEP'S HEADS, HEARTS, TAILS, AND TONGUES.— E. R. 
]40. — A ffreat variety of excellent dishes may be made 
from a sheep s head, which in India, where veal is not so easily 
procurable, answers all the purposes for mock turtle, rolled 
head, rich hash, or ragoflt : the bones make excellent jelly, 
either savoury or sweet. Parboil the head ; cut the meat from 
the bone; stew the former in a little of the liquor until quite 
tender ; send it to table with a glass of wine in the sauce. 



156 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IX. 

forcemeat-baUs and brain-cakes for garnish ; or roll up the 
pieces seasoned in the inside with a thick covering of chopped 
herbs well seasoned ; brush the outside with yolk of egg ; 
dredge it with bread-crumbs ; fiy it ; and send to table with a 
rich gravy made of the bones and pickles warmed up in it. 

Take a sheep's heart and stuff it throughout, using a consi- 
derable quantity of chopped bacon in the stuffing ; half boil 
it, and when cooled a little rub it over with pepper and salt, 
and wrap it in paste in the shape of a cone. Kub the paste 
over with the yolk of an egg^ and strew vermicelli loosely over 
it. Set it with the broad end downwards and bake it in the 
oven. When baked, send it to table with gravy sauce. 

Sheep's Tails and Tongues, — ^Take 3 tails and 3 tongues, 
cut the tails in half and split the tongues. Stew them gently 
for 3 hours in as much water as will cover them, adding 3 
spoonfuls of vinegar, 3 onions, a teaspoonful of mixed spices, 
and 1 of salt : these ingredients to be put in after the pot has 
been skimmed. When the tails, &c., are very tender, take 
them out, score them, dip them in drawn butter, roll them in 
grated bread-crumbs, and let them lie for a few minutes, then 
put on more butter with a knife, and additional bread-crumbs, 
which latter should be slightly seasoned ; brown them before 
the fire. Strain the gravy, enrich it with butter, squeeze lemon- 
juice over the tongues and tails, and serve them in the gravy. 

SHEErS TROTTERS.— E. R, 

141. — Boil the trotters, or rather stew them gently, for several 
hours, until the bones will come out. The liquor they are 
boiled in will make excellent stock or jelly. Take out the 
bones without injury to the skin, stuff them with a fine force- 
meat ; stew them for \ an hour in some of the stock, which 
must be well flavoured with onion, seasoning, and a little sauce ; 
take out the trotters, strain the sauce, reduce it to a glaze, and 
brush it over the feet. Serve with any stewed vegetable. 

Or : — Prepare them in the same way, and dip them in a 
batter and fiy them. The paste, or batter, for frying, is best 
made thus : mix 4 spoonfuls of flour with 1 of olive-oil, and a 
sufficient quantity of beer to make it of the proper thickness ; 
then add the whites of 2 eggs well beaten and a little salt. 
Serve with tom^ta-sauce. 

Or: — Simply boil them, and eat them cold with oil and 
vinegar. 



Chap. X.] LAMB. 157 



CHAPTER X. 



LAMB. 

Lamb is of two qualities — ^^ house-lamb " and <^ grass-lamb *^ 
the fi>Tmer coming into season, as a great delicacy, just before 
Chiistmas, and the latter not until Easter. Both are, however, 
dressed in the same manner — chiefly plain, boiled and roasted, 
only that house-lamb, being the greater nicety, is more fre- 
quently boiled, more particularly the 1^, and accompanied 
widi white sauce. Though fat, yet, if well chosen, it will not 
weigfa more than about 3 or Si lbs. 

BOILED LEG OF LAMB 

142. — Should look as white as possible. Choose a ewe leg, 
as there is more fat on it ; saw off the knuckle, trim off the flap 
and the thick skin on the back of it, soak it in warm water for 
3 hours, then boil it gently (time according to size) ; pour a 
little white sauce over it. The loin may be fried in steaks and 
served round, garnished with dried or fried parsley : spinach or 
sea-kale to be eaten with it. Or it may be served with parsley 
and butter, or with oyster-sauce. It will not take more than 
about 1 hour, if the joint be taken from the house-lamb ; but 
grass-lamb will require i an hour longer. 

QUARTERS OF LAMB ROASTED, 

143. — Fore Qtuzrter, — Cut off the scrag 1 joint from the 
shoulder ; saw off the chine-bone, and also the bone of the 
breast, and joint it thoroughly ; crack the ribs in the middle ; 
cut off the thick skin which covers the lower part of the breast, 
and break the bone of the shoulder to allow of the knuckle 
twisting round, and secure it in its place with a skewer from 
boieath the breast right up the knuckle. Put 2 lai^e skewers 
at the thin end ; pass the spit between the skewers and the ribs, 
through the thick part at the shoulder; paper it, having a

double thickness over the thin end. When the quarter is 
roasted whole, the shoulder should be raised either at table or 
when dished ; a slice of fresh butter laid upon the meat, a little 
cayenne pepper, and the juice of a lemon. {See Carving,) 

The hind qtiarter is sometimes roasted, and served with 
mint-sauce. It may also be larded, covered with oiled paper, 
and when more than half done the paper to be withdrawn, the 
meat basted with oil or yolk of egg, and slightly covered with 
crumbs of bread ; then put closer to the fire to give it a fine 
brown ; when served, it is sprinkled with the juice of a lemon. 

If roasted whole, the quarter, of 8 to 10 lbs. weight, will 
take 2\ to 2^ hours in dressing, as it ought to be always well 
done. The fore quarter will require from f to 1 hour less. 

TO BONE A QUARTER OF LAMB, 

144. — Take the fore quarter, remove the shoulder and take out 
the bone ; stuff" it with fine forcemeat, and skewer it in a hand- 
some shape. Braise it with 2 oz. of butter, add a teacupful of 
water, stirring the braise until the gravy is drawn. Then cut 
the brisket into pieces, and stew them in white gravy ; thicken 
it with cream and eggs so that it shall be very white ; cut the 
long bones into chops and fry them ; thicken the gravy of the 
braise, add to it haricots, minced truffles, or anything else of 
vegetable in season. Place the shoulder in the centre of a 
dish with its own sauce, lay the brisket covered with white 
sauce round it, and place the fried chops at the edge. 

Lamb a V Espagnole. — An entire lamb is frequently roasted 
in the Peninsula, without any other preparation than merely 
skinning it, taking out the fry, and cutting off the feet. It 
is then, however, extremely young — not more than perhaps 6 
weeks or 2 months old ; the bones eat like gristle, and the meat 
is singularly delicate. It is sometimes, but only rarely, stuffed 
with bread and sweet herbs, and served with bread-sauce ; but 
more frequently eaten with lemon-juice. 

Au Pascal, — May be a little older, and is also roasted whole, 
but boned from, the neck up to the shoulders, and the legs fixed 
into the body, which is then covered with slices of bacon, kept 
on with small skewers, or tied with twine ; all, however, being 
removed when the meat is nearly done. Both should be placed 
in a cradle-spit, and will take about 2 hours in roasting.

TO STEW LAMB. 

145. — A Quarter of Lamb may be stewed a la PMgord, 
by putting it into a casserole with a little oil, parsley, chives, 
and miishrooms, or half a dozen black truffles, either whole or 
diced, together with some trenches of bacon. Let it stew 
gently in any kind of broth, and when thoroughly done take 
it out, strain the gravy, and serve tlie joint along with the 
truffles or mushrooms only. To be well done it will require 
4 hours in stewing. 

For a Breast of Lamb. ^Cut off the thin ends, half boil, 
then strew with crumbs of bread, pepper, and salt ; and serve 
in a di^h of stewed mu^iroonis. 

Cut a Loin of Lamb into steaks, pare off the skin and part 
of the fet, fry it in butter a pale brown , powr away the fat, and 
put in boiling water enough to cover the meat, a little pepper 
and salt, a little nutmeg, ^ pint of green peas, and a coss-let- 
tuce cut lengthways ; cover it down, and let it stew gently for 

Shoulder of Lamb. — Bone the shoulder, trim off some of the 
lean meat, which cho|) tiiiewitlian equal quuNtity of bacon fat, 
season with spice ; iill up the shoulder and roll it ; braise it 2 
hours over a slow stove ; take it up, glaze it. Serve with 
sorrel or tomata sauce. 

LAMBS HEAD.—E. R. 

146. — Parboil the head, rub it over with yolk of eggs, cover 
it thickly with chopped herbs, crumbs of bread, and clarified 
batt«r, and put it into a Dutch oven before the fire. Mince 
the h^rt and the liver very finely, and stew them in a little 
good gravy, adding a spoonful of lemon-pickle ; make some 
forcemeat-balls and brain-cakes, and fry them ; place the mince 
in the dish with the head upon it, and garnish with the balls, 
bnun-cakes, and lemon sliced, or pickles. 

Lamb's Head and Hinge. — This part is best from a house- 
lamb ; but any will be white if soaked in cold water and boiled 
in a napkin. Boil the head separately till very tender. Have 
ready the liver and lights three parts boiled, and cut small ; 
■tew them in a little of the water in which they were boiled, 
season and thicken with flour and butter, and serve the minoe 
round the head. 



160 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. X. 

Or : — Skin the head and split it ; then wash and clean tho- 
roughly both it and the entrails — ^which consist of the " hinge " 
and " fry," — ^and lay the whole in boiling water for \ an 
hour ; then take out the heart, liver, and lights ; mince th^n 
very small ; and toss them up with a quart of either veal or 
mutton broth, a little ketchup, and a spoonful of cream, sea- 
soned with pepper and salt. When the head is sufficiently 
boiled, rub it over with yolk of egg, and powder it with crumbs 
of bread ; baste it well with butter, and brown it before the 
fire. Keep the mince hot ; and when all is ready, dish the 
mince with the head over it, and the brains made into savoury 
balls as a garnish. 

A little minced bacon is not a bad addition, and parsley, 
thyme, and finely-chopped herbs may be used at pleasure : the 
head may have a squeeze of lemon, and the mince a grating of 
nutmeg. 

LAMB'S FRY. 

147. — Parboil it ; dip it in eggs, then in bread-crumbs, fiy 
it crisp, and serve it dry, with fried parsley, without any sauce. 

LAMBS SWEETBREADS, 

148. — Blanch them, and put them into cold water. Then 
put them into a stewpan, with a ladleful of broth, some pepper 
and salt, a small bunch of button onions, and a blade of mace : 
stir in a bit of butter and flour, and stew \ an hour. Have 
ready the yolks of 2 or 3 eggs well beaten in cream, with a 
little minced parsley and a few grates of nutmeg. Put in some 
boiled asparagus-tops to the other things. Do not let it boil 
after the cream is in ; but make it hot, and stir it well all the 
time. Take great care it does not curdle. French beans or 
peas may be added, but they should be very young. 

To fricassee Lamb-stones and Sweetbreads. — ^Have ready 
some lamb-stones blanched, parboiled, and sliced. Flour 2 or 
3 sweetbreads : if very thick, cut them in two. Fry all toge- 
ther, with a few large oysters, of a fine yellow brown. Pour 
the butter off, and add a pint of good gravy, some asparagus- 
tops about an inch long, a little nutmeg, pepper and salt, 2 
shalots or some chives shred fine, and a glass of white wine. 
Simmer 10 minutes ; then put a little of the gravy to the yolks 
of 3 eggs well beaten, and by degrees mix the whole. Turn 



Ceap. X] LAMB. 161 

the gravy back into the pan, and stir it till of a fine thicknew 
ititbout boiling. Gamuih with lenioti. 

To frieiusee Lamb-stmies ■without any addition.- — Skin, 
wasli, and parboil, and then cut them in half, dry and flour 
ttiem ; fry of a beautiful brown in h(^'s lard. Serve with the 
following sauce : thicken some veal gravy witli a bit of flour 
and butter, and then add to it a slice of lemon, a large spoon- 
ful of mushroom-ketchup, a teaspoooiul of lemon-pickle, a 
grate of nutmeg, and the yolk of an egg beaten well in 2]aige 
spoonfuls of tluck creani. Put this over the fire, and stir it 
well till it is hot and looks white : do not let it boil, or it will 
curdle. Then put in tlie fry, and shake it about for a minute 
or two. Serve in a very hot di^. 

LAMB-CBOPS.—E. B. 

149. — Take a loiu of lamb, cut chops from it i an inc^ 
thick, retaining tlie kidney in its place ; dip them into egg 
and hread-crumljs, fry and serve with fried parsley. 

When chops are made from a breast of lamb, the red bone 
at the edge of the breast should be cut off, and the breast par- 
boiled in water or broth, with a sliced carrot and 2 or 3 onions, 
before it is divided into cutlets, which ia done W cutting be- 
tween every second or third bone, and preparing them, in every 
reelect, as the last. 

K houie-lamb Heaia are to be done white — etew them in milk 
and water till very tender, with a bit of lemon-peel, a little salt, 
gome pepper and mace. Have ready some veal-gravy, and 
pot the steaks into it ; mix some mushroom-powder, a cup of 
cream, and the least bit of flour ; shake the st^s in this liquor, 
atir it, and let it get quite hot, but not boil. Just before you 
take it up, put in a few white mushrooms. 

If frroipj^— season them with pepper, salt, nutmeg, grated 
lenon-peel, and chopped parsley ; but dip them first into egg : 
fry them quickly. Thicken some gravy with a bit of flour and 
butter, and add to it a spoonful of port wine. 

BLASQUETTE D'AGNEAU. 
150. — White Fricatne of Lamb.— Cut the best part of the 
breastof small lamb into square pieces of 2incheseach: wash, 
dry, and flour them. Having boiled 4 oz. of butter, 1 of &t 
baoon, and some parsley, 10 minutes, put the meat to it: add 
the juice of i a lemon, an onion cut small, pepper and salt. 



162 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. X. 

Simmer the whole 2 hours ; then put in the yolks of 2 eggs, 
shake the pan over the fire 2 minutes, and serve. 

I:pa ule ita gnea u au na turel, 

151. — Bone a small fat shoulder of lamb, leaving only H 
inch of the knuckle. Mince a little of the meat firom the inside, 
with some bacon £it, white pepper, and salt, and lay it on the 
inner side. With a large needle and coarse thread gather 
together the circumference of the meat, press it flat, and &sten 
the little bone as a handle in its proper place. Then lay at 
the bottom of a stewpan a lai^e sliced onion, ^ a lemon 
without any of the peel, 3 small carrots cut lengthways, and 
1 clove ; on these lay the lamb ; and round it put strips of 
bacon about the size of your finger ; throw in a fittle parsley, 
and cover the meat with veal broth. Set the pan on a very 
slow fire, and place wood embers on the lid. Simmer 2 hours. 
Keep the meat hot while the gravy is strained, and add to it a 
little velouU; boil very quickly, and throw it over the lamb. 
Put a ruffle of paper on the knuckle. 

Or : — It may be served with cucumber sauce, tomata, sorrel, 
or any other piquant sauce, afler it is glazed. 

PIED8 ITAGNEAU. 

152. — ^Have 6 lambs' feet scalded, take out the shank-bone 
very carefully, so as not to cut or break the skin ; soak for. 
3 hours in cold water ; put them in a stewpan with cold water 
and the juice of 2 lemons ; let it boil for 10 minutes, take out 
the feet, throw them into cold water, cut off* the bones of the 
cleft part of the foot, and remove the curl of hair that lies in 
the cleft. Boil very gently for 3 or more hours in souiepoilee 
(which see) to keep them very white. Serve with asparagus, 
peas, and mushroom or white cucumber sauce. 



CHAPTER XI. 

VEAL. 

DiEECTiONs for choosing vea! have already been given. To 
ieep it, we have to observe — the first part that turns bad of a 
Ug of veaJ is where the udder is skewered back. The skewer 
ihould be taken out, and both that and the whole of the meat 
wiped every day ; by which means it will keep good 3 or 4 
lUys in hot weather, if the larder be a good one. Take care 
to cut out the pipe that runs along the chiue of a /oin, as you 
do of beef, to hinder it &om taintiog. The skirt of the breast 
is likewise to be taken off, and the inside wiped and scraped, 
md qninkled with a little salt. 

If veal is in danger of not keeping, wash it thoroughly, and 
bcnl the joint 10 minutea, putting it into the pot when the 
water is boiling hot ; then put it into a very cool larder, or 
plunge it into cold water till cool, and then wipe and put it by. 
If in the least tainted, it cannot be recovered, as brown meats 
are, t^ the use of diarcoal or pyrol%neous acid. 

FILLET OF VEAL BOASTED. 

IS3. — Take out the bone, fill the space with a fine stuffing, 
and let the &t be skewered quite round ; stuff it also well under 
the ikin — as much depends on the quantity and flavour of the 
stuffing — and send the lai^e side uppermost. Put a paper over 
the &t ; and take care to allow a sufficient time for roasting ; 
pat it a good distance from the fire, as the meat is very solid, 
and must be so thoroughly done as not to leave the least appear- 
ance of red gravy ; serve it with melted butter poured over, and 
navy round. Ham or bacon should be served with it, and 
fresh cucumbers if in season. 

Although considered very ind^estible, it is a &vourite joint 
in Eo^and, where it is generally roasted, although it tdb.'y Vk 
u2 



164 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. 

easily divided into 3 parts and each dressed separately ; that 
piece known in a " round of beef" as the " silver side being 
roasted, and the remaining two stewed in different wajrs. 

In Pans, a huge de veau is cut somewhat in the shape of 
a haunch of mutton, with the fillet and part of the loin joined 
together. 

FILLET OF VEAL BOILED. 

154. — Choose a small delicate fillet for this purpose; prepare 
as for roasting, or stufi* it with an oyster forcemeat ; bind it 
round with a tape ; after having washed it thoroughly, cover 
it with milk and water in equal quantities, and let it boil very 
gently d^ or 4 hours, keeping it carefully skimmed. S^id it 
to table with a rich white sauce, or, if stuffed with oystns, 
a tureen of oyster-sauce ; garnish with stewed celery and slices 
of bacon. A boiled tongue should be served with it. 

LOIN OF VEAL ROASTED. 

166. — Take a loin of veal ; run a larknspit along the chine- 
bones ; then tie the ends of the ladk-spit on the usual spit, 
drawing down the flap over the kidney. Cover it well with 
buttered paper, and tie it up carefully ; let it roast gently for 
3 hours. When about to serve, remove the paper, sprinkle 
well with salt, dredge it with flour, and finish basting with a 
small piece of firesh butter. 

This joint is frequently divided; the kidney end and the 
chump. The kidney end sent up with a toast imder the faX ; 
the chump end should be stuffed like the fillet, or sent up wilh 
balls of stuffing in the dish ; pour melted butter over the joint, 
and gravy round. It also forms an excellent stew if served up 
in winter with rice, and in summer with green peas. 

BREAST OF VEAL, 

166. — Cover it with the caul, and, if you retain the sweet- 
bread, skewer it to the back, but take off the caul when the 
meat is nearly done : it will take 2i to 3 hours roasting. 

Or: — Remove the tendons, and insert in their place a 
stuffing ; then roast as before. 

Or : — Raise the skin, and force in as much stuffing as pos- 
sible ; skewer it up ; this will give a very good flavour to the 
joint. 

Ta stew, — Cut a breast^ or a portion, in pieces ; fry them 



Chap. SI.] VEAL. 165 

with a little butter, an onion, and a cabbage-lettuce ahred small j ■ 
when browned, add a little flour, shake it well together ; thea i 
add a Biuall qnaatity of broth or water ; let it stew gently ; ' 
when nearly done, throw in green peas suffieieat for the dish ; 
ulien the peas are done, add a little pounded sugar, pepper, 
and salt. It may require a little more thickening, in which 
<ase knead a Httle flour and butter together. 

Or .-—If any be left, cut the pieces into handsome sizes, 
put them into a stewpan, and pour some broth or water over 
ifaem : add a bunch of herb^, a blade or two of mace, some 
pepper, an onion, and an anchovy ; stew till the meat is 
tender, thicken with butter and flour, and add a little ketchup. 
The whole breast may be stewed, after cutting off the twft 
ends, or dividing it into pieces, which should be ftrst slightly. 
browned. ' 

Serve the sweetbread whole upon it, which may ather bflfl 
stewed or parboiled, and then covered with crumbs, herba*, 
pepper, and salt, and browned in a Dutch oven ; or, if yott 
iiave a few mushrooms, truffles, and morels, st£w tliem with it, 
ind serve. 

Boiled brea«t of veal, smothered with onion sauce, is an es- 
ueileut disb, if not old nor too fat. 

BREAST OF VEAL STEWED.— E. R. 
157. — Cut a handsome piece, put itintoastewpanwithapiece 
of butter, a pint of water, an onion, a stick of celery, and scMue 
white pepper and salt ; let it draw gently for some time, then 
cover it with hot water, and allow it to atew until perfectly ten- 
der. Remove any skin that may be about it, and thicken a 
part of the stock with cream, flour, and butler ; cover it with the 
MDce, nod serve it up. Mushrooms pickled white may be added 
to the sauce, or stewed celery. 

Or .-—When the veal is three parts done, take a quart of 
peas, put them in water, and handle them with a little butter, 
80 that they adhere together ; take aw^ nearly all the gravy 
from the veal, and put in the peas. When both are done add 
pq)per, salt, and a little pounded sugar ; thicken the peas with 
floor and butter, dish up the veal, and pour the peas over. 
There should be very little sauce with the peas. 

Or: — Cut the veal into pieces, and half fry it with an onion 
sliced ; then put it into a stewpau, cover it with water, and add 
a bunch of sweet herbs. Stew until perfectly tender, strun 



166 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. 

the gravy, thicken it if necessary with brown roux, and serve 
it up with forcemeat-balls and slices of lemon. 

Or: — Cut the veal into handsome pieces, put them into a 
jar with 1 or 2 dozen oysters, and their liquor strained, and a 
piece of butter rolled in flour ; put the jar into a kettle of water, 
and let it stew until tender. If the veal has been cooked, 
merely warm it up with the oysters in white sauce. 

SHOULDER OF VEAL. 

158. — Cut off the knuckle for a stew or gravy.' Roast the 
other part with a stufling; you may lard it. Serve with 
melted butter. 

The blade-bone, with a good deal of meat left on, eats ex- 
tremely well, when grilled, with mushroom or oyster sauce, or 
mushroom ketchup in butter. 

Being a large joint of what is considered rather coarse meat, 
it is rarely served to any but plain family parties; but, if 
braised, it makes an excellent dish. 

NECK OF VEAL, 

159. — Take the best end of a neck of veal, cut off the ends 
of the bones, and turn the flap over : saw off the chine-bone, 
or joint it thoroughly ; paper it, and baste it well all the 
time it is roasting. Lardiing the fillet or thick part is a great 
improvement. Or, stew it with rice, small onions, and pepper- 
corns. 

Or : — Take the best end of a small neck ; cut the bones 
short, but leave it whole ; then put it into a stewpan just 
covered with brown gravy ; and when it is nearly done, have 
ready a pint of boiled peas, 3 or 4 cucumbers, and 2 cabbage- 
lettuces cut into quarters, all stewed in a little good broth ; 
put them to the veal, and let them simmer for 10 minutes. 
When the veal is in the dish, pour the sauce and vegetables 
over it, and lay the lettuce round it. This is an excellent 
summer stew. 

Neck of Veal a la Braise. — Cut off the ends of the long 
bones, and saw off the chine-bones ; raisfe the skin of the fillet ; 
lard it very close, and tie it up neatly. Put the scrag end, a 
little lean bacon or ham, an onion, 2 carrots, 2 heads of celery, 
and about a glass of Madeira wine into a stewpan. Lay on 
them the neck, add a little water, and stew it 2 hours, or till it 
is tender, but not . too much. Strain off the liquor ; mix a 



Chap. XI.] VEAL. 167 

little flour and butter in a stewpau till brown ; stir some of the 
liquor in, and boil it up ; skim it nicely, and squeeze orange or 
lemon juice into it, and serve with the meat. The bacon 
should be browned vrith a salamander and glazed. It may 
also be served with spinach or sorrel. 

KNUCKLE OF VEAL. 

160. — As few people like boiled Teal, it may be well to 
leave the knuckle small, by taking- off some cutlets, or collops, 
before it be dressed ; and as the knuckle will keep longer than 
the fillet, it is best not to cut off the slices till wanted. Soak 
it 2 hours in cold water, and boil it in a cloth. Serve with 
plain parsley and butter, or oyster sauce and stewed celery. 

Or : — Break the bones, to make it take less room ; w^ it 
well, and put it into a saucepan with 3 ouions, a blade or two 
of mace, anil a few peppercoma ; cover it with water, and 
simmer it till quite tender. In the mean time either some 
macaroni should be boiled with it, or rice, or a little rice-flour, 
to give the gravy a small degree of thickness, but do not put 
too much. Before it is served, add 4 pint of milk and cream. 
The meat may be served in the soup, or on a separate dish. 
If the latttT, it may be covered with onion sauce. Bacon 
and greens are usuaJly eaten with boiled veal. Put chopped 
puBley for garnish. 

Or : — -Fry the knuckle with sliced onions and butter to a 
good brown ; put to it ather gravy or water ; stew it till 
the meat is tender ; have ready peas, lettuce, onion, and a 
cucumber or two, stewed ; add these to the v^ ; simmer for 
1 of an hour. Season with pepper and salt, and serve all 



CALF'S BEAD. 

161. — Observe: the skin should always be left on calvea' 
heads, otherwise they are scarcely worth the pains bestowed 
in dresang them. 

Clean Uie head very nicely, and soak it in water, that it 
may look very white ; lake out the tongue to salt or stew, and 
tlw brsins to make a little separate dish. Boil the head ex- 
tronely lender ; then strew it over with crumbs and chopped 
panley, and brown it, leaving one half plmn. Bacon and 
9 are usually eaten with it Serve with paisley and 



greens i 



168 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. 

Or : — ^When thoroughly cleaned, the brains should be taken 
out, washed, soaked, and blanched, and boiled ; then mix well 
a little chopped sage, previously scalded and wanned in melted 
butter ; serve in a separate dish with the tongue, tiie brains 
being placed in the centre ; brush the head with yolk of egg, 
cover with bread-crumbs, and brown before the fire. In doing 
this, however, the better mode is, also to score the head at 
distances of ^ an inch, and to put into each incision some of 
the crumbs and chopp^ sweet herbs ; and serve with tomata 
or brown caper sauce. If any of the head is left, it may be 
hashed next day, and a few slices of bacon just warmed and put 
round. The remains of calf s head eat well' if grilled. 

Calfs'head hashed. — ^When half boiled, cut off the meat 
in slices i inch thick, and 2 or 3 inches long : brown some 
butter, flour, and sliced onion, and throw in the slices with 
some good gravy, and nK>rels or mushrooms; give it one 
boil and skim it well, and set it in a moderate heat to sim- 
mer till very tender. Season with pepper, salt, and cayenne 
at first ; and 10 minutes before serving throw in some shred 
parsley, with a very small bit of tarragon and knotted nuujoram 
cut as fine as possible : add the squeeze of a lemon and a glass 
of white wine. Garnish with forcemeat-balls and bits of bacon 
rolled round. 

To fricassee Calfs-head, — Clean and half boil a head ; cut 
the meat into small bits, and put it into a tosser, with a little 
gravy made of the bones, some of the water it was boiled in, a 
bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, and a blade of mace. If you 
have any young cockerels in the house, use the combs ; but 
first boil them tender and blanch them ; or a sweetbread will 
do as well, cut in pretty large dice. Season the gravy with a 
little pepper, nutmeg, and ssdt, rub down some flour and butter, 
and give all a boil together ; then take out the herbs and onion, 
and add a little cup of cream, but do not boil it. Serve with 
small bits of bacon rolled round, and balls. 

To bake Calfs-head, — Mix pepper, salt, bread-crumbs, and 
chopped sage together ; rub the head over with butter and put 
^he seasoning upon it; cut the brains in 4 pieces, and rub 
them also in the crumbs, and lay the head in a deep dish with 
the brains ; put a piece of butter into each eye, with plenty of 
the crumbs also, fill the dish nearly full of water, and let it 
imie 2 hours in a quick oven. 



CaAP. XI.] VEAL. 169 

Calf s-head Ragout. — Parboil the head, and cut off the meat 
ioto thin broad pieces, return the bones to the water in which 
it was boiled, witii a beef-bone or a piece of gravy beef, and 
hani or bacon boaes ; add herbs, and, making 2 quarts of good 
gravy, strain it, and put in the meat. When it has stewed { 
of an hour, add an anchovy, a little beaten mace, cayenne 
pepper, 2 spooniula of lemon -pickle, J oz. of truflBea and 
morels, a slice or two of lemon, and a glass of wine: thicken 
the gravy with butter and flour, adding forcemeat-balls fried, 
paste fried, and br^n-cakes as a garnish. 

Roiied Calf t-head.— Boil the head geutly until the bone 
will leave the meat easily ; take some fine forcemeat, made 
with ham, ^^-balls, and small pieces of very nice pickled pork 
[Obviously boiled ; lay them evenly over the inside of one half 
of the head, and roll it up ; tie it lightly in a cloth ; put it 
into a stewpan to braise: cut the other portion of the head 
into small pieces ; thicken and flavour the stock in which it 
was boiled, and warm it up in it, adding forcemeat and egg- 
balls, brain-cakes, and fried paste. Place the rolled head in 
f Hk centre of the dish, with the hash round, and the brain- 
cakes, fried paste, and slices of lemon, as garnish. Truffles 
may be added with advantage to any dish composed of calfs- 
bead. 

. 162. — Hathed Veal. — If to be hashed, from any joint not 
ov^mie cut thin slices, remove the akin and gristle, put 
some sliced onions and a shalot over the fire with a piece of 
butter and some flour ; fry and shake them. Put in some 
reel gravy and a bunch of sweet herbs ; simmer 10 minutes ; 
(tndu off the gravy, and put it to the veal, with some paisley 
chopped small, and a little grated lemon-peel and nutmeg ; 
1^ it simmer 1 minute. 

It to be tieured, then add the yolks of 2 eggs, beaten up with 
2 spoonfuls of cream and a very little pepper, and stir over 
the fire one way untU it becomes thick and smooth ; squeeze a 
little lemon-juice in, and serve. 

SCOTCH COLL0P8.—E. S. 

163. — Vbrown, cut the collops thin, beat them a little, fry 

them in butter for about 2 minutes, afler having seasoned them 

with a Uttle beaten mace ; place them in a deep dish as they 

are £ned, and cover them with gravy. Put some butter into 



170 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. 

the frying-pan, and allow it just to change colour. Then 
strain the collops through a colander firom Qie gravy, and firy 
them quickly ; pour the burnt butter firom the pan, and put in 
the gravy, adding a little lemon-juice. The gravy may be made 
of the trimmings of the veal : serve it up with forcemeat-balls. 
If white, cut the collops the size of a crown-piece, and not 
much thicker ; butter the bottom of the stewpan and lay the 
meat piece by piece upon it, having shaken a little flour upon 
the butter ; add 2 blades of mace and a little nutmeg. Set 
the stewpan on the fire, and toss it together until the meat is 
very white ; then add i pint of strong veal broth and i pint 
of cream; toss the whole, and, when simmered enough, let 
them just boil ; add a little lemon-juice, some forcemeat-balls, 
and either oysters or mushrooms, which must both be very 
white ; if necessary, thicken the sauce with the yolk of ^gs, 
but do not let it boil afterwards. 

To dress Collops quickly, — Cut them as thin as paper with 
a very sharp knife, and in small bits. Throw the skin, and 
any oidd bits of the veal, into a little water, with a dust of 
pepper and salt ; set them on the fire while you beat the 
collops ; and dip them into a seasoning of herbs, bread, pepper, 
salt, and a scrape of nutmeg, but first wet them in egg. Then 
put a bit of butter into a frying-pan, and give the collops a 
very quick fry ; for as they are so thin, 2 minutes will do them 
on both sides : put them into a hot dish before the fire ; then 
strain and thicken the gravy. 

Or : — Cut the collops thin ; flatten them with a beater ; 
have a large dish, dredge it with flour, and sprinkle a little 
black pepper over it : as the collops are flattened, lay them in 
the dish ; put a piece of butter in a frying-pan, and, when it is 
melted and hot, lay in the collops ; do them quickly ; when 
lightly browned, dish them up, and serve with a mushroom 
sauce. 

VEAL CUTLETS,— E. R. 

164. — Cutlets should be cut from the fillet, but chops are 
taken from the loin. Some persons have deprecated the prac- 
tice of beating meat, but it is essentially necessary in veal 
cutlets, which otherwise, especially if merely fiied, are very 
indigestible. They should be cut about i or, at the most, i 
an inch in thickness, and well beaten ; they will then, when 



Chap. 51.] TEAL. 171 

fried, taste like sweetbread, be quite as tender, and nearly as 
rich. Egg them over, dip in bread-crumbs and savoury herbs, 
fry, and serve with mushrocim sauce and fried bacon. 

Or : — -Prepare as above, and fry them ; lay them in a dish, 
and keep them hot ; dredge a little flour, and put a bit of 
butter into the pan ; brown it, then pour a little boiling water 
into it, and boil quickly ; season with pepper, salt, and ketchup, 
and pour it over them. 

Cutlets and iJice.— Boil a cupful of rice in milk until quite 
soft, then pound it iu a mortar with a little salt and some white 
pepper ; pound also sepai'ately equal parts of cold veal or 
chicken ; mix them together with yolk of egg, form them into 
cutlets, brush over wifli yolk of egg, and fry them : send them 
up with a very piquant sauce, made of good stock, thickened, 
and flavoured with lemon-juice, lemon-pickle, or Harvey's 
Bauce. The cutlets may be sent to table covered with the 
small pickled mushrooms. 

Cutlet* and Celery. — The cutlets may be cut from the beat 
port of the neck, taking care iu removing the meat from the 
bones to cut it in a good shape ; make gravy of the bones, 
stewing them with 3 or 4 heads of celery eut and scalded, a 
little salt, pepper, and stewed onion ; straiu the griivy, re- 
tuniiug the celery into it ; thicken il w itii bulttr a:id flour, 
and pour it boiling hot upon the cutlets. Stew them till they 
are quite tender, and garnish with lemon and small forcemeat- 
balls fried. 

A Vltalienne. — Chop a quantity of sweet herbs, parsley 
hwa^ the predominant ; melt a little butter on the fire and 
then warm the herbs in it ; cut the cutlets into handsome shapes, 
brush them with the yolk of an e^, then lay on the butter and 
heibs with a knife, and cover them well with bread-cnunbs ; 
this process should be repeated ; fry them of a fine brown : if 
glazed, they must be put between papers to press all the grease 
out, then brush them over with the glaze, and send them to 
table. Serve with Italian sauce. 

A la HoUandaise.- — Cut some large cutlets from a fillet of 
veal, beat them with a rolling-pin, then dip them into batter 
made very rich with egg. Make a fine forcemeat with pounded 
ham, chopped oysters, &c., lay it upon the cutlets, roll them 
up, dip them again in egg-batter, roll them in bread-crumbs, 
and tie them up ; roast them upon skewers or in a Dutch oven ; 



172 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. 

I I 

chop and pound the trimmings of the veal, add them to the 
oysters and ham forcemeat with 2 raw eggs, make it into balls 
and fry them; have some stock ready and stew it with an 
andiovy, a shalot, some white pepper and salt; strain, and 
thicken it with butter, add the juice of i^ a lemon and a glass 
of white wine ; give it one boil and pour it into the dish, with 
the rolled cutlets in the centre and the balls round them. 

A la Hollandaise^ with White Sauce. — Cut thin slices of 
undressed veal, hack them with the back of a knife each way, dip 
them in ^gs and bread-crumbs, with a little chopped parsley ; 
fry them in butter, lay them on a sieve as they are done, and 
serve them with white sauce as for fricassee. 

FARCIES OF VEAL. 

165. — Chop off the thick bone of a small neck of veal to 
the end of the fifth rib ; divide the cutlets, and with a broad 
knife beat the meat of each fiat, and cover it with forcemeat of 
lean veal, beef suet, parsley, a small bit of garlic, a little salt, 
mace, and pepper, llien roll the meat round the bone, the end of 
which leave out at one extremity, put over a thin slice of fat 
bacon, and, having stuffed in the remainder of the forcemeat at 
the ends of the roll, bind up with twine. At the bottom of a 
small stewpan lay slices of turnip, onion, 3 inches of celery, 
and 2 large carrots cut lengthways, and the steaks over ; add 
as much water, or beef broth, as shall half cover them ; set 
the pan on a moderate stove, and some wood embers on the lid ; 
simmer slowly 2 hours, then remove the twine, and placing the 
bones upwards, leaning on each other, strain the gravy over 
them. 

Or : — Take cutlets from the chump end of a loin of veal ; 
beat them well ; cover them with slices of bacon, then with a 
fine forcemeat; roll them round; tie them into shape; then 
dip them in the yolks of eggs and the raspings of bread ; roast 
them, basting well with butter; then put them into a sauce 
thickened with mushrooms; squeeze lemon-juice over them; 
let them stew till very tender, and serve them up. 

ROLLED VEAL,~-E.R. 

166. — ^The breast is the best for this purpose. Bone a piece 
of the breast, and lay a forcemeat over it of herbs, bread, an 
sDchovy, a spoonful or two of scraped ham, a very little mace, 



Chap. XI.] VEAL, 173 

white pepper, and chopped chives ; then roll, bind it up light, 
and stew it in water or weak broth with the bones, some carrots, 
onions, turnips, and a bay-leaf. Let the colour be preserved, 
and serve it in veal gravy, or fricassee sauce, with mushrooms 
and artichoke bottoms. 

Or : — Put the breast into a stewpan with just water enough 
to cover it, an onion, a stick of celery, and a bimdle of sweet 
herbs ; let it stew very gently, adding more water as it stews, 
until it is tender ; then take out the bones, and remove the 
skin ; return the bones into the liquor, which will be a fine jelly, 
and serve as the sauce for several dishes. Cover the veal with 
a fine forcemeat, season it well, add egg-balls, and roll it up, 
securing it with tape. Put it into a stewpan with the fiit pro- 
cured from pork chops, a slice or two of fet bacon or a lump 
of butter, and a teacupfdl of the liquor it was stewed in ; shake 
the stewpan about until the &t has melted, and turn the veal in 
it, that it may be all equally done, adding an onion and another 
bunch of herbs; let it braise 1^ or 2 hours, then strain the 
gravy, and thicken it ; garnish with forcemeat-balls, egg-balls, 
and fHed paste cut in shapes. Peeled mushrooms may be 
^ven by way of variety. When well done, this is an ex- 
cellent dish. 

TENDONS DE VEAU. 

167. — The tendons de veau are the gristle that is found in the 
breast of veal at the extremity of the bones ; it must be cut out 
from the meat before cooking. Lay the breast on the table 
with the bones upwards, and with a sharp knife cut the tendons 
off the ribs : the place where the tendons begin and the ribs 
end being shown by a line of white gristle. The breast can 
then be roasted or stewed, replacing the tendon by a good 
stuffing. 

Tendons aux Epinards, — Take the tendons out of the 
breast of veal, cut them in pieces 6 inches long, envelop them 
in a sheet of bacon fat, tie them up carefully, braise them with 
trinunings of veal, an onion, carrot, bay-leaf, 2 or 3 cloves, 
feggot of parsley, and thyme. Let them simmer gently, until 
so thoroughly done that a skewer passes through easily. Take 
them up, put them on a dish with a slight weight on them. 
When cold, cut them in slices i an inch thick, warm them in a 
little gravy, gleize them : serve on stewed spinach or sorrel, or 
with tomata-sauce. 



174 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. 

Tendons a la ViUeroy, — Cut the tendons in slices; lay 
them in a marinade of oil, vinegar, lemon, onions, i&c, for 3 
hours ; dry them, dip in batter, firy : serve with tomata-sauce. 

FRICANDEA U OF VEAL.—E. R, 

In France the fricandeau is not unj&equently larded in the 
interior as well as the outside, by having pieces of the size of a 
little finger cut off the meat with an instrument something like 
a cheese-taster, and then refilled with pledgets of bacon, or 
" lardons" The meat is also very generally served upon spi- 
nach, dressed with cream or sorrel. 

The meat, being cut into a handsome shape, should be 
larded, and put into a stewpan of small size, with just sufficient 
water, or v^ broth, to cover it, and there allowed to simmer 
gently over a slow fire for about 3 hours ; or until it has be- 
come so tender as to be cut with a fish-slice. The gravy is 
then seasoned at pleasure, but most generally made into white 
sauce. 

168. — Cut a handsome piece from the fillet, lard it all over as 
thickly as possible ; put it into a stewpan with a few slices of 
fait bacon, some trimmings of veal, a carrot, turnip, and a head 
of celery, a few allspice, 2 blades of mace, and 4 bay-leaves ; 
let it stew very gently until thoroughly done, boil the gravy 
down to a glaze, cover the veal with it, and serve it upon a 
pur^ of sorrel. Grenadines of veal are cooked in the same 
way, only made of smaller pieces, 4 for a dish. 

FRICANDEL8, 

169. — Take 3 lbs. of the best end of a loin of veal, chop the 
fat and lean together very fine ; then soak a French roll in 
some milk ; beat 3 eggs ; add pepper, salt, nutmeg, and mace. 
Make the mixture up about the size, and somewhat in the shape, 
of a chicken ; rub it over with egg and bread-crumbs, fry until 
it is brown, pour off the fat, boil water in the pan, and stew 
the firicandels in this gravy : two will make a handsome dish. 
Thicken the gravy before it is sent to table. 

MIROTON OF VEAL. 

170. — Chop very fine some cold dressed veal and ham or 

bacon ; mix it with a slice of crumb of bread soaked in milk, 

^ onions chopped and browned, a little salt, pepper, and a 



Chap. XI.] TEAL. I7S ' 

little cream. Put all these ingredients into a stewpan until 
they are hot, aud are well mixed together ; theo add 1 or 2 eggs 
according to the quantity, butter a mould, put in the whole, 
and bake it in an oven until it is brown ; turn out of the 
mould, and serve with fresh gravy. 

A GALANTINE— E. R. 
171- — Take out the long bones from a breast of veal, and 
beat the veal for 4 minutes with the flat part of a hand-chopper, 
in order that it may roll easily. Spread it on the table, and 
brush it over thickly with the yolk of an egg, and then sptinkla 
it with chopped herbs ; season with pepper, salt, and poundeel 
uiace : make 2 omelettes, one* of the yolk and one of the 
white of egg; cut them in strips; lay them upon the veal, 
vith layers of pounded ham or farce between ; cut some ' 
pickled cucumbers or mushrooms into small pieces, with soma > 
sweet herbs well seasoned ; strew them over the surface, then 
roll up the veal very tightly, tie it in a cloth, and let it stew 
gently for 6 hours ; then put a heavy weight upon it, and \et 
it stand 2 days before it is cut. Serve it in slices, with ■ 
savoury jelly : any kind of boned game or fowl may be added.- - 
It requires to be liighly seasoned. 

VEAL OLIVES. 

172, — Cut loi^ thin slices, beat them, lay them on thin 
slices of &t bacon, and over thesealayer of forcemeat, seasoned 
h^ with some shred shalot and cayenne. Boll them tight, 
about the size of 2 fitters, but not more than 2 or 3 inches 
loi^ ; &8ten them round with a small skewer, rub egg over 
them, and fry them of a light brown. Serve witii brown gravy, 
in which boil some mushrooms, pickled or fresh. Garnish with 
balls fried. 

HARICOT OF VEAL. 

173. — Take the best end of a small neck; cut the bones 
short, but leave it whole ; then put it into a stewpan just 
covered with brown gravy ; and when it is nearly done, have 
ready a pint of boUed peas, 4 cucumbers pared and sliced, 2 
cabbage-lettuces cut into quarters, and i- pint of carrots and 
toniips cut in shapes, all stewed in a little good broth ; put 
them to theveal, and let them simmer 10 minutes. When the 
veal is in the dish, pour the sauce and vegetaUes over it, aud 
lay the lettuce with foicemeat-balls round it. 



176 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. 



CALVES* FEET, E, R. 

174. — Stewed, — ^When properly cleaned, rub the feet over 
with pepper, a very little salt, a little ground g^ger, and 
mace ; cut the feet into moderately-sized pieces, and put them 
into a stewpan with a little shalot, and a beefsteak, also cut 
into pieces. Cover all with cold water, and let them simmer 
together for 3 hours. When quite tender, take them off the 
fire ; strain the gravy through a sieve. The next day, when 
cold, take off all the £it ; boil a small quantity of saffiron in 
cream, and a litde cayenne pepper ; mixlt with^he gravy, and 
warm the whole without boiling : 1 foot and 1 lb. of steak will 
make a dish. 

Fricasseed, — Boil the feet in water until the bones will 
come out, with an onion and a bunch of sweet herbs ; take the 
bones out, and wh^i the meat is cold stuff it nicely with a 
very ^ne farce, or forcemeat ; make the pieces up into hand- 
some shapes of an equal size ; then take some of the stock in 
which the feet were boiled, removing the &t, and straining it 
when melted ; make this into thick white sauce with cream 
and roux ; warm up the calves' feet in it, and send it to table 
either plain or with a quantity of asparagus tops, previously 
boiled, and cut into small pieces. 

Or : — Boil tender 2 feet in a shallow pan, observing not to 
break them ; throw them into cold water for an hour ; divide, 
and lay them in a little weak veal broth, and simmer them 
i an hour, with a blade of mace and a bit of lemon-peel, which 
take out when you add i a teacupful of cream, and a bit of 
flour and butter. 

Fried. — Take calves' feet which have been boiled until very 
tender, remove the bones, let them get cold, cut them into 
well-shaped pieces, season them with white pepper and salt, 
dip them into batter, fry them, and serve them up with a 
sharp sauce or garnish of pickles. 

Calves' feet may also be plainly boiled, and served with 
parsley and butter, or eaten cold with oil and vinegar. 

QUEUES DE VEAU 

176. — ^Having nicely cleaned and soaked 4 calves' tails, cut 

off the small ends, and blanch them ; dry, flour, and fry them 

a £ne brown in butter ; drain the fat from them, and having 



Chap. X!.] , VEAL. 177 

ready a pint of weak broth, with & bunch of aweet herbs, 
chib»Is, 2 bay-leaves, i pint of mushrooms, pepper and salt, 
boiled up and skimmed, wipe the sides of tlie casserole, put 
the tails in, and simmer very slowly until they are quite 
tender ; keep tliem hot while the gravy is strained, and boiled 
to a glaze, to cover them. If you have no musliroom^, mix 
a little of the powder into the gravy just before serving ; have 
reaiiy small onions, and peel to one size to send up in the 

CALVES- EARS STUFFED. 

176.- — -The hair being scalded off the ears, after they have, 
been cut quite close to the head, scald and clean them as well, 
38 posdble; boil them quite tender, and blanch them in cold 
water. Observe that the gristle next the head be cut so 
smooth as to allow the ears to stand upright; they may be 
boiled in white gravy instead of water, which will make ^eni 
richer. When become cold, fill up the cavity with a fins' 
stuffing- of calf B liver, fai. bacon, grated ham, bread soaked 
in creatn or gravy, herbs, an unbeaten egg, a little salt, ana 
a small piece of mace ; rub e^ over the ears and stuffing, 
dip in bread-crumbs, and fry of a beautiful light brown. Serve 
in brown or white g^rai y, or tomata-sauce. If the ear be large, 
one will be suflicient for a comer dish. 

Or : — When prepared as above, boil them quite tender in 
giavy, and serve them in chervil-sauce ; or else boil chervil 
to a mash, put to it melted butter, pass it through a sieve, 
and add to it white sauce, or use the latter solely, in which 
case put a little mushroom-powder into it; the same force- 
meat may be used, or the ears may be served without, 
Tliey likewise eat well, served in white or brown gravy, cut 
mto slices. In the latter case, fry them before stewed in 
giavy. 

CALVES BRAINS.— E. S. 

177. — ^Remove all the laige fibres and skin ; soak them in 
irann water for 4 hours ; blanch them for 10 minutes in boil- 
ing water, with a little salt and vinegar in it ; then soak them 
3 hours in lemon-juice in which a bit of chervil has been 
steeped ; dry them well, dip them in batter, and fiy them. 
Uake hot a ladleful of glaze, some extremely small onions 
browned in butter, artichoke bottoms divided in half, and some 



178 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. 

mushroom-buttons, and serve round the brains ; or, after pre- 
paring as above, serve in a rich white acidulated sauce, with 
lemon-juice or tomata-sauce. 

Or : — Blanch the brains, and beat them up with an egg, 
pepper, and salt, a small quantity of chopped parsley, and a 
piece of butter. Make them into small cakes, put them into 
a small frying-pan, and fry them. 

Or : — Prepare them as above ; wet with egg, and sprinkle 
crumbs, salt, pepper, and chopped parsley, and finish dressing 
in a Dutch oven. Serve with melted butter, with or without 
a little mushroom-ketchup. 

Croqtiettes of Brains. — Take calf's brains, blanch, and beat 
them up with 1 or 2 chopped sage-leaves, a little pepper and 
salt, a few bread-crumbs soaked in milk, and an egg beaten; 
roll them into balls, and fry them. 

Cervelles de Veau au Marinade. — Cut a carrot, a turnip, 
and an onion into pieces ; let them stew in a little butter ; 
then add a bundle of sweet herbs, and pour over them a pint 
of vinegar and water in equal parts ; then strain the liquor, 
and pour it over calves' brains cleaned and blanched; let 
them stew in it till they are firm, then fry them in butter, and 
serve up with crisped parsley. 

Cervelles de Veau Fricassees. — ^Having cleared and blanched 
the brains, render them white and firm by squeezing lemon- 
juice over them ; then put them into a stewpan with a piece 
of butter ; stew slowly, that they may not brown ; dredge in 
a small quantity of flour ; add a bimch of parsley, and 1 of 
chives ; moisten with clear veal broth ; let the brains stew until 
they are firm ; then send them up in the sauce, thickened with 
a little cream and flour and butter. 

FRIED LIVER AND BACON, ETC.—E. R, 

178. — Cut the liver rather thin, say about i inch thick, but first 
soak it in warm water about 1 hour ; chop a quantity of pars- 
ley, season it with pepper, and lay it thick upon the liver ; cut 
slices of bacon, and fiy both together, but put the bacon first 
into the pan ; add a little lemon-pickle to the gravy made by 
pouring the fat out of the pan, flouring, and adding boiling 
water. 

Or : — Cut the liver in handsome pieces, lard them very nicely, 
and chop some parsley and spread it over the sur£Eice with a 



little pepper and salt ; put a small piece of butler well niised 
with flour in the bottom of a stewpan, put in the liver, and alluw 
it to stew gently in its own juices until it is done enough. 

To dress Liver and Lights. — Half boil an equal quantity of 
each : then cut them into a middling-size minee; put to it a 
spoooful or two of the water they were boiled in, a bit of butter, 
floor, salt, and pepper ; simmer 1 minutes, and serve hot. 

To dress Calf's fleor/.— Stuff and roast the same as beef 
heart ; or, being sliced and seasoned, make it into a, pudding 
as directed for steak or kidney pudding. It may be either 
roasted or baked, but in either way should be well basted, stuffed 
with forcemeat as fur veal, but made rather more savoury, and 
served up in the same niauner as beef heart, 

When the kidnn/ is cut from the loin and dressed separately, 

chop the kidney, with some of the fet ; likewise a little leek 

or onion, pepper, and salt. Veal forcemeat may also be used, 

but it rather weakens the pungency of the seasoning, lioll it 

••iq) with an egg into balls, and fry them. 

W S WEE TBREA DS. 

179. — For every mode of dressing, sweetbreads should be 
prepared by blanching, or rather paiboiling them. 

They may be larded and braised ; and, being of themselves 
father insipid, they will be improved by a relishing sauce, and 
by a large quantity of herbs in the braise. Slices of lemon 
put upon the sweetbreads while braising will heighten the 
flaTour and keep them white, which is very desirable when sent 
to table with white sauce. StufiM with oysters, they make a 
very good vol au vent. 

Stpeelbreadt d la Daube. — Blanch 2 or 3 of the largest sweet- 
breads ; lard them ; put them into a stewpan, with some good 
veal gravy, a little browning, and the juice of 4' a lemon ; stew 
them till quite tender, and just before serving thicken with 
flour and butter; glaze them; serve with their gravy, with 
buochea of boiled celery round the dish. 

Sweetbrectds ttewed. — Afler blanching, stufi* than with a 
forcemeat of fowl, &X and lean bacon, an anchovy, nutm^, 
lemon-peel, parsley, and a very little cayenne and thyme; 
when veU mixed, add the yolka of 2 eggs, and fill the sweet- 
breads. Fasten them together with spUnter-ekewers, and Ikj 



180 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. 

them in a pan, with slices of veal over, and bacon under them ; 
season with pepper and salt, mace, cloves, herbs, and sliced 
onion ; cover close over the fire 10 minutes, then add a quart 
of broth, and stew gently 2 hours ; take out the sweetbreads, 
strain and skim the broth, and boil it to i pint ; warm the 
sweetbreads in it, and serve with lemon round. 

Fried, — Cut them in slices about f inch thick, dry and 
flour, e^^ them, and dip them in fine bread-crumbs ; fry 
them of a light brown ; serve on spinach, endive, or sorrel ; 
or cut some toasted bread, dish them on it, and serve them 
with a sauce piquante. 

For an invalid, boil them well, cover them with bread- 
crumbs, a little pepper and salt, with a small bit of butter ; 
brown them lightly with a salamander. 

Roasted, ^-Eiiasich., dry, eg^ and bread-crumb them ; pass 
a small skewer through each; tie on a spit; roast gently; 
baste with fresh butter ; serve nicely frothed, and a mushroom- 
sauce under them. 

Sweetbreads fricasseed white, — Blanch and slice them ; 
thicken some veal gravy with flour and butter mixed, a little 
cream, a little mushroom-powder, and add white pepper, nut- 
meg, and grated lemon-peel ; stew these ingredients together 
a little, then simmer the sweetbreads 20 minutes. When taken 
ofl* the fire, add a little salt and lemon-peel ; stir well, and 
serve. 

If fricasseed brown, cut them about the size of a walnut, 
flour, and fry them of a fine brown ; pour to them a good 
beef gravy, seasoned with salt, pepper, cayenne, and allspice ; 
simmer till tender; thicken with flour and butter. Morels, 
truffles, and mushrooms may be added, and mushroom- 
ketchup. 

Croquettes, — Take 2 sweetbreads or i lb. of roast veal, 
1 onion chopped fine, mixed with a small piece of butter, 1 egg, 
and a little cream ; season with white pepper, cayenne, and 
salt. This will make 8 or 9 croquettes. Roll them in egg and 
then in bread-crumbs ; fry them in lard a nice brown colour ; 
strew them in a circle round the dish, and serve fried parsley 
in the centre. 

Cold veal chopped, and stewed in a little gravy, and when 
cold made up as above, makes excellent rissoles. 



Chap. XI.] YEAL. 181 



RI8 DE VEA U EN CAISSES. 

180. — ^Blanch 3 sweetbreads, and simmer in a strong, well- 
flavoured gravy till quite done. Have ready 3 round pieces 
of white paper oiled, and lay them thereon ; having left them 
lightly wetted with gravy, sprinkle over them the finest crumbs 
or raspings of bread, pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg ; 
do them slowly on a gridiron, and serve in the cases. Any of 
the v^etable sauces may be served with them. 

GARNITURE EN RAGOUT. 

181. — ^Having prepared and blanched sweetbreads of veal or 
lamb (house-lamb is the best), liver of lamb and rabbits, truf- 
fles and mushrooms, simmer gently i an hour in rich veal 
broth ; then divide the several articles into fit bits for help- 
ing, and stew the whole till very tender. If, when finished, 
the gravy wants consistence, boil up in it a good piece of 
butter rolled in flour. Season it 15 minutes before serving, 
with white pepper, salt, and nutmeg only. Have ready and 
hot, forcemeat-balls, in which finely-scraped ham, beef-suet, 
the breast of a fowl, or cold veal, are the principal ingredients. 

It may be served in a tureen as soup, or in an ornamented 
crust previously baked. If to be white, beat as many yolks 
of e^s as the quantity may require, and simmer in the ra- 
gout 2 minutes : it must not boil. Sometimes 1 or 2 whole 
pigeons, nicely prepared, form a part of this much-admired 
dish, which in one way or other is rarely omitted on well- 
covered tables. 

VEAL CAKE.—E. R, 

182. — ^Bone a breast of veal, and cut it in slices ; cut also 
slices of ham or lean bacon, and boil 6 eggs hard ; butter a 
deep pan, and place the whole in layers one over the other, 
cutting the eggs in slices, and seasoning with chopped herbs 
and cayenne pepper, and wetting the herbs with anchovy or 
other highly-flavoured sauce. Cover up the whole, let it bake 
for 4 hours, and, when taken from the oven, lay a weight upon 
it to press it well together. When cold, turn it out. 

Another, — Boil 6 or 8 eggs hard ; cut the yolks in 2, and 
lay some of the pieces in the bottom of the pan ; shake in a 
lidle chopped parsley, some slices of veal and ham, and then 
eggs again, shaking in after each some chopped parsley, vflth. 



183 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI. 

pepper and salt, till the pan is full. Then put in water enough 
to cover it, and lay on it about an oimee of butter ; tie it down 
with a double paper, and bake it about an hour. Then press 
it close together with a spoon, and let it stand till cold. It 
may be put into a small mould, and then it will turn out 
beautifully for a supper or side dish. 

Another. — Chop very finely cold dressed veal and ham or 
bacon ; mix it with a slice of bread-crumb soaked in milk, 2 
onions chopped and browned, a little salt, pepper, and an e^ 
beaten. Put all these ingredients into a stewpan imtil they 
are hot and are well mixed ; then oil or butter a mould, put in 
the whole, and bake it in an oven until it is brown ; then take 
it out, and send it to table with fresh gravy. 

Veal rolls are cut from any cold joint, or prepared in the 
same manner from the raw meat. Cut thin slices, and spread 
on them a fine seasoning of a very few crumbs, a little chopped 
or scraped bacon, parsley and shalot, some fresh mushrooms 
stewed and minced, pepper, salt, and a small piece of pounded 
mace. This stuffing may either fill up the roll like a sausage, 
or be rolled with the meat. In either case, tie it up very tight, 
and stew very slowly in a gravy and a glass of sherry. Serve 
it when tender, after skimming it nicely. 

BLANQUETTES, 

183. — Melt a piece of butter the size of a walnut in a 
stewpan ; then put in a little thyme, parsley, or any herbs you 
like the flavour of, and a little onion, aU chopped fine, with a 
pinch of flour. Brown the herbs ; add pepper and salt, with a 
clove or two. Then put in cold or imdressed veal, cut in thin 
slices the size of half-a-crown ; add gravy or broth i pint, 
or according to the quantity of meat you want to dress. It 
should not be too large a dish. Let it stew very gently over a 
stove ; if of dressed meat, 1 hour will be sufficient : add 
^ a teacupful of cream, and stir it well together for a few 
minutes ; then take it up, and before you turn it out have 2 
yolks of eggs well beaten, and add to your dish. Give it a few 
shakes over the fire. It must not boil, or it will curdle. 

Or, Cut rabbits, fowl, veal, or lobster in pieces, steep them 

(except the veal and fish) in water for ^ an hour, changing 

the water. Put some butter in a stewpan to melt, but do not 

Jet it fry; put in the meat with a very little flour, and keep 



Chap. XI.] VEAL. 183 

shaking it well ; pour in by degrees some broth made of white 
meat, add a bundi of parsley, an onion, salt, mace, and white 
pepper. Stew it well i of an hour before it is dished ; take 
out the parsley and onion, and add some raw parsley chop- 
ped, aDd the yolk of an egg and cream beaten together. You 
must never cease shaking the pan until the blanquette is put 
over the dish. 

Veal a la Chartreuse, — Line a copper mould with fat bacon, 
lay sliced carrots and turnips round the edges, then cover 
with a forcemeat, and put in a fricassee of veal or fowl. 
Cover the top of the mould with a paste, steam it an hour, and 
serve it turned out upon a dish. 

To fnarble Veal. — Boil tender, skin, and cut a dried neat's 
tongue in thin slices, and beat it as fine as possible, with 
i lb. of butter and some mace poimded. Have ready some 
roasted fillet of veal, beaten with butter, and seasoned with 
white pepper and salt ; of this put a thick layer in a large 
potting-pot, then put in the tongue, in rough irr^ular lumps, 
not to touch each other ; fill up the pot with veal, and press 
it down quite dose. Pour clarified butter thick over ; keep in 
a dry cool place, and serve in thin slices, taking ofi* the butter. 
Garnish with parsley. 

SCALLOPS OF COLD VEAL, 

184. — Mince the meat extremely small, and set it over the 
fire, with a scrape of nutmeg, a little pepper and salt, and a 
little cream, for a few minutes ; then put it into the scallop- 
shells, and fill them with crumbs of bread, over which put some 
bits of butter, and brown them before the fire. 

Either veal or chicken looks and eats well prepared in this 
way, and lightly covered with crumbs of bread fried ; or these 
may be put on in little heaps. 

TO MINCE VEAL. 

185. — Cut cold veal as fine as possible, but do not chop it ; 
put to it a very little lemon-peel shred, 2 grates of nutmeg, 
some salt, and 4 or 5 spoonfuls of either broth, milk, or water ; 
simmer these gently with the meat, but take care not to let it 
boil, and add a bit of butter rubbed in flour. Put sippets of 
thin toasted bread, cut into a three-cornered shape, round the 
dish. Fried crumbs of bread lightly strewed over, or served 



184 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XI, 

in little heaps on the meat, are an improvement to the look 
and flavour. A little shred of shalot may occasionally be 
added. 

Or : — Stew a few small mushrooms in their own liquor and 
a bit of butter i of an hour ; mince than very small, and 
add them (with their liquor) to minced veal, with also a little 
pepper and salt, some cream, and a bit of butter rubbed in less 
than i a teaspoonful of flour. Simmer 3 or 4 minutes, and 
serve on thin sippets of bread. 

The Turkish mode. — Take equal quantities of cold dressed 
veal, minced very fine, fet, and crumbs of bread, and season it 
well ; add chopped onions, parsley, salt, and cayenne pepper ; 
wet it with one or two eggs, according to the quantity, adding, 
if necessary, a little cold melted butter ; make the mixture 
into balls or egg-shapes, and roll them in as much boiled rice 
as they will take round them. Stew them for li hour in good 
gravy, well seasoned, and serve them up in it. 

In all these modes, the addition may be made of sauce aux 
truffes^ or any of the approved sauces ; and a squeeze of lemon 
will in all cases be found to give a pleasing zest to their 
flavour, 

CURRY OF VEAL. 

186. — Cut part of a breast of veal in moderate-sized pieces ; 
put it in a stewpan with an onion and a shalot sliced fine, a 
slice of lemon, 1 oz. of butter, a little parsley and thyme, and 
a tablespoonful of curry-powder mixed with the same quantity 
of flour ; add sufficient broth or water for the sauce ; let it boil 
gently till the veal is done ; strain the sauce through a sieve, 
pour it over the veal quite hot, and serve with rice in a sepa-= 
rate dish.

nquirea to be very well roasted, is never boiled 
wtHttedf and in every form should be thoroughly cooked. 
It ii not the ftshion to stuff it, as heretofore, with sage and 
mmaoBf the meat frequently disi^reeing with delicate persons 
vldioat the addition of so strong an adjunct, but it foraa a 
wirj aafOQiy addition. A part of the objection may be re- 
moved by boiUng the sage and onions, and mixing th^n with 
tnftd-emmbs ami a chopped apple ; and if thus prepared, the 
•tuflbog will be found mild, and of excellent flavour. 

The griskin and the sparerib are certainly improved by 
being powdered with chopped sage, but this is all a matter of 
taste. The skin of the leg and loin must be scored previous to 
roasting ; but take care to preserve the skin, or crackling^ of 
a fine brown, as many persons look upon it to be the best part 
of the pork: it should therefore be well basted, and guarded 
fiom being burned by a sheet of oiled paper. Send both up 
with a glass of vinegar mixed with 2 teaspoonfuls of made 
mustard in the dish. Applensauce should always be served 
with roasted pork. 

If you kill a young pig of 4 or 5 months, take off the skin 
of the fore quarter, roast it, and serve with mint-sauce and 
salad. 

SUCKING-PIGS. 

187. — To scald a Sucking-pig, — The moment the pig is 
killed put it into cold water for a few minutes ; then rub it 
over with a little resin, beaten extremely small, and put it 
into a pail of scalding water ^ a minute ; take it out, lay it on 
a table, and pull off the hair as quickly as possible : if any 
part does not come off, put it in again. When quite clean, 
wash it well with warm water^ and then in 2 or 3 cold waters, 



186 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XII. 

that no flavour of the resin may remain. Take off the feet at 
the first joint ; make a slit down the belly and take out the 
entrails : put the liver, heart, and lights to the feet. Wash 
the pig well in cold water, dry it thoroughly, and fold it in a 
wet cloth to keep it from the air. ♦ 

To roust a Sucking-pig. — Put some sage, a large piece of 
white bread, salt, pepper, and an onion, into the belly ; then 
sew it up. Observe to skewer the legs back, or the under part 
will not crisp. Lay it to a brisk fire till thoroughly dry ; then 
have ready some butter in a dry cloth, and rub the pig with it 
in every part. Dredge as much flour over it as will possibly 
he, and do not touch it again till ready to serve ; then scrape 
off" the flour very carefully with a blunt knife or coarse towel, 
rub the pig well with a buttered cloth, and take off the head 
while at the fire ; take out the brains, and mix them with the 
gravy that comes from the pig, or make them up into balls 
with crumbs of bread and ^g. Then take it up, and, with- 
out withdrawing the spit, cut it down the back and belly, lay 
it into the dish, and throw out the onion : chop the sage and 
bread quickly as fine as you can, and mix them with a large 
quantity of fine melted butter with a very little flour. Take 
off the upper part of the head down to the snout. Put the 
sauce into the dish after the pig has been split down the back, 
and garnished with the ears and the 2 jaws. In Devonshire it 
is served whole, if very small ; the head only being cut off to 
garnish, as above. 

It will require from 1 hour to 1^ to roast, and an iron " pig- 
plate " should be hung on a bar of the grate to prevent the 
middle of the pig being done before the other parts are ready. 

Sucking-pig should never be more than about 3 weeks old ; 
but sometimes young porkers just weaned from the dam are 
roasted whole in the following manner : — 

TO ROAST A PORKER.- E. R, 

188. — When prepared for the spit, roll a small lump of 
butter in flour and chopped sage-leaves, and put it in the in- 
side ; but put enough, as the body of a young pig should be 
quite filled with stuffing. When warm at the fire, take the 
whites of 1 or 2 eggs, beat them well, and, with a small brush 
or a bunch of feathers, spread it all over the pig. When 
nearly roastedy catch the gravy that falls ; and, when taken 



Chap. XH.] PORK. 187 

from the spit, Temove the sage-leaves from the inside ; cut off 
the head, split it, and take out the brains, cut the pig down the 
lack and into quarters, cut off the ears, and lay them with the 
head Toond the dish. Mix with the gravy already caught the 
bnins and the sage-leaves, chopped small, together with a 
little cream or melted butter heated in a saucepan, and pour it 
ntothe dish. 

The pig may be sent up with various sauces, — viz. currant- 
■moey egg-sauoe, gravy, and plumped prunes or raisins. This 
k an old-&8hioned recipe for roasting-pig, but, as it obtained 
when the dish was a favourite, it has been inserted here. The 
common method now is, to bake a pig, and send it to the oven 
nibbed with butt^, basting it occasionally with butter while 
cooking, and having gravy, bread, egg, cranberries, or currant- 
jeDy as an accompaniment. It will take more than 2 hours in 
roasting ; or it may be equally well baked. 

2b roast a Porker's Head. — Choose a fine head, not too 
dose to the neck ; clean it well, remove the eyes and snout, 
and put bread and sage as for pig ; sew it up tight, and on a 
string, or hanging-jack, roast it as a pig, and serve with the 
same sauce. 

LEG OF PORK.—E. R. 

189. — To hake, — Rub it well over with salt and saltpetre 
mixed ; let it lie 5 or 6 days in the brine ; then hang it up to 
smoke for 5 or 6 days. Take off the skin, put it into an 
earthen dish, and pour a little red wine over it; stick a few 
cloves in it, or beat them to powder, and rub them over it. 
"VThen it has been in the oven a short time, take some hard 
biscuit, pounded with sugar, and spread it all over. Serve it 
up with gravy, and port-wine sauce. 

To roast, — Choose a small leg of fine young pork : cut a 
slit in the knuckle with a sharp knife ; and fill the space with 
sage and onion chopped, and a little pepper and salt. Score 
the skin in slices, but do not cut deeper than the outer rind. 
Put it at first a good distance from the fire, but baste it 
frequently to prevent its scorching : then, when about three 
parts done, rub the skin rather firmly with raw butter, after 
which flour it lightly and put close to the fire to crispen the 
crackling. Apple-sauce should be served ^dth it. 

To boil. — Salt it 8 or 10 days, turning it daily, but do not 



188 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. Xn. 

rub it after the first. When it is to be dressed weigh it : let it 
lie ^ an hour in cold water to make it white : allow ^ of an hour 
for every lb., and ^ an hour over, firom the time it boils up : 
skim it as soon as it boils, and frequently after, but do not 
boil it fast, or it will be hard. Allow water enough. Save 
some of the water to make pea-soup. Some boil it in a cloth, 
floured, which gives a very delicate look, but destroys the value 
of the liquor for making soup. 

PORK CUTLETS. 

190. — Perhaps few things of a simple nature, and served in 
a plain way, are better than a hot pork chop, cut about i an 
inch thick, trinuned neatly, and broiled upon the gridiron. 

Or : — Fry in salad-oil ; serve with sauce Robert or gherkin- 
sauce, the gherkins being shred fine into some good thick 
brown gravy. 

Or : — Marinade the cutlets for 4 hours in oil with an onion 
in slices, parsley, bay-leaf, pepper, and salt ; fry them in the 
marinade ; serve with tomata-sauce. 

Or : — Melt a small piece of butter in a fryingpan ; put in 
it 3 bay-leaves, 3 slices of lemon, a little parsley and thyme 
shred, 4 leaves of sage, a blade of mace, 8 allspice, and a glass 
of white wine ; lay in the cutlets, put a cover over them, let 
them be about two-thirds done, then take them out, dry them, 
dip them in egg, then in bread-crumbs, fry them quickly ; 
serve with the sauce that comes firom the cutlets, thickened 
with flour and butter, and a little mustard stirred in. 

FORK CURRY. 

191. — ^Take pork cutlets, cut rather fat, and proceed as for 
veal curry. 

SADDLE OF FORK. 

192. — ^Have a saddle of pork cut as a saddle of mutton ; roast 
it with the rind on. When sending it to table, remove the 
crackling, and serve with tomata-sauce. 

LOIN AND NECK OF FORK 

193. — May be roasted and served with the same accompani- 
ments as a porker. 

Or : — Simmer the best end of either of the joints till nearly 
if/ /or the table f strip oflP the skin, put it into a cradle-spit, wet 



Ohap. XIL] Tii^HK. 189 

ital) ovo- witliTolksofcggs. and cover it thickly nitJi crumbe 
of bread, swctt herbs and chives chupped fine for stuHrmg, and 
seasoned with pepper and salt. It tnll get s good brown in 
about i an boor. 

Either of them may also be rolled. — Bone it ; put a force- 
meat of chopped sage, a very few eruuihs of bread, ^tt. pep- 
per, and 2 or 3 berries of alhipice, over the invade ; iheu roll 
ihe meat oi' tight as you can, and magt it slowly, and al a 
good distauce at first friun the fire. 

To parboil it before tlie herbs are put on will be an inf 
pravemeat. 

tOf.V OF FOBK A LA PORTl'GAISE. 

194. — In FortugBl, where the pork is perhaps the linest in 
Europe, porkra^ are never killed, but the fat of bacon-hogs 
is cut off for curing ; and the loin, eaten fresh, is there pre- 
pared by being left for some days lo soak in red wine and 
garlic, it b^ng occasionally hung up lo dry, then returned to 
the wine, afterwards masted, and sened with tomata-sauce. 
It is a highly-flavoured delicacy, and we offer it as a hint 
which is worthy of atteutioii. 

A r Espaguole — is prepared ami ilressed in llie same manner; 
bnt wben ready for dressing, sprinkle the meat with sweet herbs 
chopped, wrap it in bay-leaves, add the juice of two Seville 
(aanges to the wine, which must be strained, and bake it 



PICS-FEET A LA ST. MESEHOULD.—E. R. 

195. — Clean the feet perfectly, cut them down in two, then 
bind them with a tape to prevent their shrinkii^ or opening, 
and boil them gently until they are rather soft, with carrots, 
ookws, parsley, thyme, allspice, and bay-leaf; let them cool in 
the liquor. When required for use, take off the tape, dip them 
in jolks of eggs and butter about three parts melted ; season 
tbem, then cover them with crumbs of bread and finely-minced 
paisley, with the smallest quantity of shalot. Broil them until 
highly browned, and serve dry, or with sauce Eobert. 

Petliloe*. — Boil them, with the liver and the heart, in a small 
quantity of water very gently ; then cut the meat fine, and 
simma it with a little of the water and the feet split, till the 
feet ue quite tender ; thicken with a bit of butter, a little 



190 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XH. 

flour, a spoonful of cream, and a little salt and pepper. Give 
it a boil up, pour it over a few sippets of bread, and put the 
feet on the mince. 

TO FORCE HOG'S EARS. 

196. — Parboil 2 pair of ears, or take some that have been 
soused ; make a forcemeat of an anchovy, a little finely-minced 
veal, some sage, parsley, i lb. of suet chopped, bread-crumbs, 
pepper, and only a little salt. Mix all these with the yolks of 
2 eggs, raise the skin of the upper side of the ears, and stuff 
them with the above. Fry the ears in fresh butter, of a fine 
colour ; then pour away the fat, and drain them ; make ready 
i pint of rich gravy, with a glass of fine sherry, 3 teaspoon- 
^s of made mustard, a little bit of flour and butter, a small 
onion whole, and a little pepper or cayenne. Put these, with 
the ears, into a stewpan, and cover it close ; stew it gently for 
i an hour, shaking the pan often. When done enough, take 
out the onion, place the ears carefully in a dish, and pour the 
sauce over them. If a larger dish be wanted, the meat from 
2 feet may be taken from the bones, and added to the above. 

FIGS' FEET AND EARS. 

197. — Sotised, — Clean carefully and soak them some hours, 
then boil them tender ; having prepared a pickle of some of the 
liquor that they were boiled in, and a quarter part of vinegar 
and salt, boiled, pour it over them cold. When they are to be 
dressed, dry them, cut the feet in two, slice the ears, and fry 
them. Serve with butter, mustard, and vinegar, in a boat. 
They may be dipped in batter, or only floured. 

Fricasseed. — Take feet and ears that have been boiled, but 
not kept in pickle wherein was vinegar; boil them tender 
in milk, cut the feet into neat bits, and the ears into strips 
of i inch wide : wipe them, and sinuner in veal broth, with a 
bit of onion, max^e, and lemon-peel. Before you serve, add a 
little cream, flour, and butter. 

Jelly of Pigs' Feet and Bars. — Clean and prepare, then 
boil them in a very small quantity of water till every bone can 
be taken out ; throw in half a handful of chopped sage, the 
same of parsley, and a seasoning of pepper, salt, and mace in 
fine powder ; simmer till the herbs are scalded, then pour the 
whole into a melon-form. Serve when cold. 



eORJi GSISKf.V 
198. — Is usually very harti : the best way to prevent this is 
to put it into as much cold water as will cover it, ajid let it 
boil up ; then instantly take it off, and put it into a Dutch 
oven ; a very few minutes will do it, Kemeniber to rub butter 
over it, and then flour it, before you put it to the fire. Lay 
it in a dish on melted butter and mustard. It should be sca- 
nned with pepper and salt before roasting. 

SFARERIB 

199. — Should be basted with a very little butter and a little 
flour, and then sprinkled witli dried sage crumbled. 

BELLY OF FORK. 

200. — Lovers of pork are very fond of having- the belly part 

of a porker, cither fresh or salted, strewed thickly over the in- 

aide with sf^e, sweet herbs, and minced eschalots ; then rolled, 

tied tightly together, and either baked or roasted. 

SHOULDERS AND BREASTS OF PORK. 

201 .—Put them into pickle, or salt the shoulder as a ham ; 
cut according-ly. When very nice, they njay be roasted. 

SPRING, OR FOREHAND OF PORK. 

202. — Cut out the bone ; sprinkle salt, pepper, and s^e 
dried, over the inside ; but first wanu a little butter to baste 
it, and then flour it ; roll the pork tight, and tie it ; then roast 
by a hanging Jack. About 2 hours will do it. 

CHINE OF PORK. 

203. — The chine is more usually salted, and served as an 
■ccompaniment to roast turkey. Salt the chine for 3 days, 
raaet it, and serve it up with sauce made thus ; — Fiy in oil or 
batter 2 or 3 sliced <Hiion3 until they take colour ; then pour 
off the tnl, and add some gravy-sauce, chopped mushrooms, 
and 2 t&blespooniiils of vinegar, with 1 teaspooniiil of made 
mustard. Give the whole a boil, and serve it up in the dish. 

BLADE-BONE OF FORK 

204, — Is taken from the bacon-bc^ : the less meat left on it, 

in moderation, the better. It is to be broiled ; and when just 



192 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XII. 



done, pepper and salt it. Put to it a piece of butter and a 
teaspoonful of mustard ; and serve it quickly. This is a 
Somersetshire dish. 

PIG'S HARSLET, 

205. — Wash and dry some liver, sweetbreads, and fat and 
lean bits of pork, beating the latter with a rolling-pin to make 
it tender ; season with pepper, salt, sage, and a little onion 
shred fine ; when mixed, put all into a caul, and fasten it up 
tight with a needle and thread. Roast it on a hanging-jack, 
or by a string. 

Or : — Serve in slices, with parsley for a fry ; with a sauce 
of port wine and water, and mustard, just boiled up, and put 
into the dish. 

HOG*S LARD 

206. — Should be carefully melted in a jar put into a kettle 
of water and boiled : run it into bladders that have been ex- 
tremely well cleaned. The smaller they are the better the 
lard keeps, as, after the air reaches it, it becomes rank. Put 
in a sprig of rosemary when melting. 

This being a most useful article for frying fish, it should be 
prepared with care. Mixed with butter, it makes fine crust 
for tarts. 

HAMS, 

207. — Skimmed milk, or milk and water, will be found pre- 
ferable to plain water for soaking hams ; and they may also 
be boiled in milk and water. 

Where vegetables are plentiful, it is desirable to boil ham 
with 3 heads of celery, a couple of turnips, half a dozen small 
onions, and a large bunch of sweet marjoram, thyme, &c., put 
in after the pot has been skimmed. '^ These will extract the 
salt and soften the meat. A piece of coarse fresh beef, or any 
kind of meat, in addition, will materially improve the ham, as, 
in this manner of boiling it, the juices of the meat and vege- 
tables insinuate themselves between the fibres of the ham, after 
having dislodged the salt, by which means the meat is en- 
riched and rendered tender. At first sight this will appear an 
extravagant way of boiling a ham, but it should be considered 
that the broth will serve the purposes of the family." * If the

Beat and vegetables are not approved, 2 lbs. of fresh Ueef- 
diipping will answer nearly as well. 

To boil. — If long hung, soak it for 24 hours in lukewarm 
water, changing it tirequeDtly. Wash and brush it well; 
trim off any rusty parts ; put it into a boiler of water, aiid 
let it sitftmer from 3i hours to 5 hours, according to its size. 
It is beat to allow time enough, as it is easy to take up the 
'bam wlien done, and keep it liot over boiling water, covered 
closely. Take off the sldn as whole sa you can, as it ket^ 
the cold hani moist when skewered on again after dinner. 

There can be no doubt that the foregoing is an excellent 
of boiling a ham, but many people prefer to have it 
3aked, in which case send it to the oven in a deep pan mth 
4 lb, of suet over it to baste it occasionally ; or skin it, 
itover it with a cnist of coarse paste, and, when taken from 
[tte baiLehouse, strip off the crust, nib it with yolk of egg, on 
Jvhich put finely powdered crumbs of bread strewed with a 
L^Kd^ng-box, in the same manner as when the ham is boiled. 

In Sittiin and Portugal, where the hams are generally tine, 
{be method of dressing them is to put the ham in cold water 
■with a large handfiil of brown sugar, to which some persons 
add a quantity of the common cniitilry wine, and U-t it simmer 
on the fire until parboiled, keeping the pot well skimmed ; 
when taken out, the skin is stripped off, and the ham covered 
with brown sugar to the tliickness of an inch, after which it 
ia sent to the oven and baked until thoroughly done. 

A ham of 15 lbs. should be allowed nearly 2 hours before 
the water begins to boil, and as much more for simmering 
until half done ; then from 3 to 4 hours' baking, accordii^ to 
the heat of the oven, which however should never be allowed 
to be too hot. 

When cold, twist some neatly fringed letter-paper round 
the shank-bone. 

To roast.— Take a very fine ham (a "Westphalia, if you 
can procure it), soak it in luke-warm water for a day or two, 
changing the water frequently. The day before you intend 
to cook it, take the ham out of the water, and, having re- 
moved the skin, trim it nicely, and pour over it a bottle of 
an inferior white wine ; let it steep till next morning, fre- 
quently during the day washing the wine over it ; put it in a 
aadle-«pit in time to allow at least 6 hours for slowly roasting

CHAPTER XIIL 
POULTRY AND GAME, 

POULTRY. 



A YSBTt quick and clear fire is necessary for roasting all 
poultry. A large fowl will take J of an houi', a middling one 
i an hour, and a small one 20 minutes. Care must be taken 
that they are well and thoroughly done. A small turkey will 
take li hour, turkey-poults only 1 hour, a goose 1 hour, 
larger turkeys and geese li hour : both should have the 
breasts papered. Chickens take i an hour ; pigeons 20 
minutes, and may lie dressed as soon as killed. Ducks and 
ducklings the same as fowls and chickens, but all must vary 
in proportion to their difference of size, the temperature of the 
air, and the state of the fire ; and the cook must acquire cor- 
rectness by esperience. 

The French adopt the following method to make old poultry 
eat tender : — Let the bird soak in cold water for 24 hours, 
vith a handful or two of wood-ashes ; pick off the feathers, 
and let it hang for another 24 hours ; truss it, and let it boil 
for i of an hour in a little veal-broth ; take it out, lard, and 
roast it ; when nearly done, baste it with very hot butter. By 
observing these directions,- you will impart to an old bird all 
the delicate flavour of a young chicken. 

In draining jHmltry the cook must be careful not to crack 
the gall-bladder, for then no washing will remove the bitter- 
neas. Ignorant cooks sometimes draw fowls 1^ cutting a hole 
in their side, but it should be done through the vent, and, that 
being cut off, a string should festen the rump close to the fixutt 
part 

TURKEY.~E. a. 

SOe. — There is a quant adage that says,— 



196 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XHT. 

" Turkey roast is turkey lost ; 
Turkey boiled is turkey spoiled ; 
But turkey braised is turkey praised." 

To roast, — Make a veal stuffing ; fill the breast where the 
crop is taken from to make the bird look handsome ; paper 
the breast, and roast at a distance from a quick fire. Where 
truffles are to be had, take about 2 lbs., peel them, select 
the small ones, and, after chopping, pound them in a mortar 
with an equal quantity of the fat of bacon rasped ; make the 
stuffing with this, mixed with some of the larger truffles 
whole, put them into the body of the turkey, and let it hang 
for several days ; then roast it with a piece of fat bacon laid 
over the breast and a paper over that. Truffles of a good 
quality are, however, so very expensive, that turkeys fattened 
in France and stuffed with them have been sold in London at 
Christmas for 5 guineas each ! Mushrooms are therefore more 
commonly used, and even chestnuts may be substituted for 
truffles, pounded and mixed with bacon in the same manner ; 
the chestnuts should be boiled to take off the husk, peeled 
nicely, and pounded. Chestnuts, put whole into the body of 
a turkey and hung for some days, improve the flavour ; but a 
turkey thus stuffed will require long and careful roasting, and 
must be put at first at a distance from the fire. A stuffing 
of sausage or other meat may be put into the crop besides. 
Fowls may be dressed in the same way. 

Turkey with Sausage-meat, — At the messes of European 
regiments in India, it is no uncommon thing to bone a turkey 
and a fowl, and put one inside the other, filling the interstices 
with sausage-meat, a small pig being killed for the purpose. 
A turkey thus prepared will take a long time roasting, and 
must be placed at a great distance from the fire at first. 
When carved the slices should be cut quite through ; and 
epicures aver that it is one of the finest dishes that come to 
table. 

Soiled Turkey. — Fill the body with oysters, and let it 
boil by steam without any water. When sufficiently done, take 
it up, strain the gravy that will be found in the pan, and which, 
when cold, will be a fine jelly ; thicken it with a little flour 
and butter, add the liquor of the oysters intended for sauce, 
also stewed, and warm the oysters up in it ; whiten it with a 
J/ttle boiled cream, and pour it over the turkey.

A la Sraise. — Take out the breastbone of tlie turkey ; fill 
It with sausage-meat j lard the breast, braise it, aud serve with 
celery, oyster, or chestout sauce. 

Obanne: — A amall hen-bird boils better &tii a cock, and the best 
mode is to roast t)je tock-turkey and boil the hen. 

Turkey pulled and grilled is a mode of preparing the remains 
of cohl turkey by minciiig the white meat and fricaaseeing it 
r with white sauce ; the legs being scored, peppered and salted, 
■jvoiled, and sent up over the mince. 

r devilled^ as thus ; — On tlie rump, gizzard, and a druin- 
B-liSck, put salt, pepper, and cayeune. Let them be broiled, 
1 brought It) table as hot as possible ; cut them in small 
Paieces, pour over them a ladle of mustard, ditto of melted 
■ nutter^ a spoonful of soy, ditto of lemon-juice, and some of the 
' out of the dish ; mix quickly and hand round. It 
1 admirable relish ; fowls may be treated in the same 

CAP Off, OS POULARDE, 
209- — Should be stuffed and roasted, or otherwise dressed, in 
f ^irecisely the same manner as turkey. They are the male and 
female of the common fowl, but, when caponeii, grow nearly 
to the size of turkej-s, and are very rarely, if ever, boiled, 

A la Provenfcde. — Half roast the fowl ; cut it in pieces; 
take a dozen onions, cut them in rings, add a little parsley 
chopped. Place them in a stewpan, laying a bed of onions 
and parsley, then fowl, till the whole are used : add a glass of 
ml or cream with 1 or 2 bay-leaves and salt ; let them simmer 
slowly ; dish the fowl, put the onions in the middle, add a little 
sauce, and send it to table. 

POELkE TO BOIL FOWLS IN. 
210. — Take 2 lbs. of veal and 2 lbs. of bacon ; cut both into 
lai^ dice ; cut also 2 \arge carrots and 2 onions into dice ; put 
tlum, with a pound of butter, into a stewpan, the juice of 4 
lemons, a little thyme or sweet fennel, and 2 laurel-leaves 
bruised ; season it with salt and pepper ; put them on a good 
fire ; add a spoonful of boiling broth, and boil it. 



198 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. 

FO WL8,—E. JR. 

21 1. — Fowls for boiling y when trussed and singed, should soak 
an hour or two in skimmed milk. Flour them well, tie them 
in a cloth ; put them in cold water, and set them over a slow 
fire ; cover the saucepan close, and let them simmer ; as soon 
as the scum rises remove it carefully, cover them close up 
again, and boil them gently 20 minutes ; take them off the 
fire, and the steam, if kept in, will sufficiently finish them. It 
will much improve the appearance of boiled fowls if they are 
dressed with a thin piece of puff-paste tied over the breast. 

Poularde a la jRoyale. — ^Bone the fowl, and stuff it with 
sweetbread, liver, and mushrooms well seasoned and made into 
a ragout. Sew up the fowl ; cover it with thin slices of lard 
or bacon, and either tie paper over it and roast it, or put it to 
braise : if roasted, take off the lard and paper before serving, 
to brown it. Send it up on a pur^ of chestnuts. A turkey- 
poult may be dressed the same way. 

Or : — Hang young fowls a night ; take the livers, hearts, 
and tenderest parts of the gizzards — the last being previously 
boiled — shred very small, with half a handM of young clary, an 
anchovy to each fowl, an onion, and the yolks of 4 eggs boiled 
hard, with pepper, salt, and mace to your taste. Stuff the 
fowls with this, and sew up the vents and necks quite close, 
that the water may not get in. Boil them in salt and water 
till almost done ; then drain them, and put them into a stew- 
pan with butter enough to brown them. Serve with a good 
deal of melted butter, with either soy or ketchup in it. 

To roast. — ^Having cleaned the fowl, put into the inside a 
piece of butter the size of a hazel-nut or walnut, according as 
the fowl is large or small ; make the butter black with pepper, 
and sprinkle a little salt upon it. This will greatly improve 
the taste of the fowl, rendering the whole more juicy, and 
particularly the back and side bones, which are so apt to be 

dry. 

Or : — When nicely clean, and free from every feather and 
plug, singe the fowl. Bone and draw inwards the leg and 
pinion of the wing. Stuff with sausage-meat, and tie the neck 
and vent. Boast, and serve with gravy in the dish, and 
bread-sauce in a tureen. 

A large barn-door fowl, well hung, should be stuffed in the 
crop witii ^usage-meat ; and served with gravy in the dish, 



Cbjip. Xin.] POULTET AND GAME. 199 

■imI with bread-sauce. The head should be turned utider the 
nig, as a turkey. 

Boiled with Oysters. — Take a young fowl, lill the inside 
with oysters, put it into a jar, and plunge the jar in a kettle 
w aaucepOiti of water. Boil it for li hour. There will be a 
quantity of gravy from the juices of the fowl and oysters in the 
fi; nmke it into a white sauce, wilh the addition of egg, 
Deam, or a little flour and butter ; add oysters to it, or serve 
it up plain with the fowl. The gravy that comes from a fowl 
dres^ in this ntajiner will be a stiff jelly the next day ; the 
•km\ will be very white and tender, and of an exceedingly fine 
&vour — advantages not attainable in ordinary boiling — while 
' Ae dish loses nothing of its delicacy and simplicity. 

To braisf.— Bone the breast, and fill it ivith forcemeat. 
Lay the bones, and any other poultry trimmings, into a stew- 
pan, and the fowl on them. Put to them a few onions, a faggot 
of herbs, 3 blades of mace, a pint of stock, and a glass or two 
rfBherry. Cover the fowl with slices of bacon, and then with 
white paper ; cover the whole close, and put it on a slow stove 
fcir 1 hour. Then take it up, strain the braise, and skim off 
lie fet carefully ; set it on to boil very quickly to a glaze, 
and put it over the fowl with a brusli. Serve with a. brown 
fiicassee of mushrooms. Before glazing, put the fowl into an 
uvea for a few minutes, to give a little colour. 

With Rice. — The fowl should be stewed very slowly in some 
dear veal or mutton broth, well skimmed, and seasoned with 
pepper, salt, mace, and an onion. About ^ an hour before it 
IB ready add J pint of rice, well washed and soaked ; sitniner 
until tender, then strain the rice from the broth and lay 
it on a »eve before the fire to swell ; then dish the fowl with 
die rice round it. 

White sauce is the moat fashionable accompaniment, the old 
Hiethod of dishing with parsley and butler being on thedecline: 
but as parsley still maintains its ground with many people, it 
IB advisable to boQ a sufficient quantity ; press and chop it, 
Kamishing the dish with small mounds thus prepared, which 
may be mixed at table with the white sauce by the guests who 
Uke the Savour of parsley. Liver-sauce is sometimes served 
with boiled fowls, but celery or oyster sauce, either made 
separate or ti^ether, is preferable. 

Fowl aux Onions. — Boil 12 small onions in several 



200 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. 

waters, until the strength is out and they are tender ; cut a 
piece of boiled pickled pork into dice ; take a tablespoonful 
of hot vinegar, some sweet herbs chopped, and the yolk of an 
egg beaten ; make this quite thick with herbs, mix it with the 
pork and onions, and then stuff the inside of the fowl with it ; 
braise the fowl in a little broth and butter, and serve with 
white sauce. 

Atex Poix. — Put some butter into a stewpan, add flour 
until it is rather stiff, then put in some small pieces of bacon ; 
let it brown a little, then cut up the fowl and put it in : 
moisten the gravy, mix it well, and season with parsley, sorrel, 
young onions, i a bay-leaf, and a clove, and let it boil. Put 
in the peas over a quick fire, skim, and when done enough pour 
the sauce over the fowl. 

Poulet Blanc, — Choose a good, tender, fat fowl ; melt 
J lb. butter in a stewpan, turn the fowl in for a minute 
or two, mix 2 tablespoonfuls of flour into the butter very 
smoothly, taking care it does not fry. Put in the fowl, and 
nearly cover it with a weak veal broth ; add small onions, a 
bunch of sweet herbs, and a few sprigs of parsley, with some 
fresh mushrooms and a teaspoonful of lemon-juice. Let it 
simmer 1^ hour, or, if the fowl is large, 2 hours. Before 
serving take out the fowl, and keep it hot whilst the gravy is 
prepared. Strain it, and mix with it the yolk of an egg well 
beaten, stirring it all the time till it thickens, but do not let 
it boil; pour it over the fowl, and garnish with slices of 
lemon. 

Fried. — Cut up a fowl, and put it into an earthen dish with 
slices of onions, parsley, sorrel, salt, and pepper, and the juice 
of 2 or 3 lemons ; leave it an hour or two to absorb the juice. 
Put in the legs first, then the breast, wings, &c. ; dip the 
joints in batter, fry them of a fine colour : serve them up with 
fried eggs, and a sauce piquante. The batter is to be made 
with eggs and a spoonful of oil. 

Or : — The remains of a cold fowl may be well employed for 
this purpose : it will of course not take so much time to dress. 
Place it round a dish, and fill up the centre with tomata, 
sorrel, or other sauce, made very hot and very acid. 

Or, en Cotelettes, — Cut up a fowl and bone it, make the 

J^s^ wings, breast, and merrythought into 6 fine cutlets by 

Mattening them and giving them a good shape ; then take the 



B'«aAP. Xm.] POULTRY AND GAME. 201 

F meat fmra the remainder of the fowl, pound it in a, mortar 
«ith pepper, salt, and ft spixiiiful of gravy, brush the cutlets 
with an egg', lay on the forcemeat, dredge fried enimbs on the 
tops, and fry them a liglit brown : serve them up with gravy 

I in the dish, or dry, with a lemon squeezed over them. 

TO BROIL A FO (Tl — E. R. 
212. — Split the fowl down the back ; season it very well with 
pepper, and put it on the gridiron with the inner part nest the 
fire, which must be very clear. Hold the gritiiron at a con- 
aderable distance from the fire, aDd allow the fowl to remain 
ontil it is nearly half done; then turn if , taking great care that 
it does not bum. Broil it of a fine brown, and sen'e it up with 
stewed mushrooms or a sauce witli pickled mutihrooms. A 
duck may be broiled in tlie same way. If the fowl is very 
large, half-roast it, then cut it into 4 quarters and finish it on 
the gridiron, 

^ FRICASSEE OF FOWL.—E. R. 

213. — Put the fowl into a jar, with sliced onioD, parsley, 
wit, and a piece of butter rolled in flour; let it remain in a 
kettle of water on the fire imtil three pans done, then skim 
and strain the liquor, and aAer draining wipe the fowl dry. 
Pat it into a stewpan with a piece of butter and a slice or two 
of faam, throw in a little flour, and shake it until it is of ft good 
colour. Moisten with the liquor taken out of the jar, adding 
parsley, young onions, a hay-leaf, a clove, sorrel, and mush- 
looms cut into pieces : skim it, and let it stew until done, then 
take out the herbs, and thicken the sauce with a little cream, 
but do not let it boil : finish with a little lemon-juice, and pour 
the sauce over all. 

Or: — Rather more than half-boil in a small quantity of 
water : let the fowl cool ; then cut up ; and put to simmer 
ID a little gravy made of the liquor it is boiled in, and a 
bit of veal or mutton, onion, mace, and lemon-peel, some white 
p^per, and a bunch of sweet herbs. When quite tender^ 
keep it hot while you thicken the sauce in the Ibllowii^ 
manner : strain it off, and put it back into the saucepan with 
a little salt, a scrape of nutmeg, and a bit of flour and butter ; 
give it one boil ; and when you are going to serve, beat up the 
yolk of an e^ and i pint of cream, and stir them over the 



202 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. 

fire, but do not let them boil. The sauce will be quite as 
good without the egg. 

Or : — ^Take off the skin, and pull the flesh off the bone of a 
cold fowl, in as large pieces as you can : dredge it with flour, 
and firy it of a nice brown in butter. Drain the butter firom 
it ; and then simmer the flesh in a good gravy, well-seasoned, 
and thickened with a little flour and butter. Add the juice of 
i a lemon. 

The gravy may be made (without any other meat) of the 
necks, feet, small wing-bones, gizzards, and livers ; which are 
called the trimmings of the fowls. 

RISSOLES, 

214. — Pick from the bones and skin any kind of cold poultry ; 
weigh it, and add one-third of grated bread-crumbs, a little 
cold melted butter, a small onion, previously boiled and finely 
minced, pepper, salt, and the yolks of 2 eggs to bind it toge- 
ther. Roll out, thin, some trimmings of puff-paste ; cut it in 
2-inch square pieces ; put in the middle of each a teaspoonful 
of the mince, fold the paste over it, and shape it with a cutter. 
Egg the shapes, dip tibem in bread-crumbs, and fry them in 
laxd : serve dry, garnish with fried parsley, and take care that 
the edges be perfectly closed. 

Or, Pound any kind of cold meat, thicken a little good gravy 
with cream or butter, season the meat, and mix it with the 
sauce, until it is well moistened ; then roll out some paste into 
oval pieces, lay a large tablespoonful of the meat on one end, 
double it over, press the edges together, and scallop them ; 
brush the paste over with yolk of egg, sprinkle vermicelli upon 
it, and fiy them. 

FURIeE DE VOLAILLE.—E. R. 

216. — Mince the white part of a cold fowl or turkey very 
finely, then pound it in a mortar ; put in 2 or 3 spoonfuls of 
white sauce, and pass it through a sieve, adding a little salt 
and white pepper, and warm the whole. It may be served up 
with the legs grilled. It should not be too thin, but can be 
made the proper consistence by a greater or smaller quantity 
of white sauce or cream. Garnish with fried bread, or paste 
cut in shapes. It may also be served up in a casserolle, or 
wa/2 of lice and mashed potatoes, or with poached eggs. 



CsAP. Xni.] POULTRY AND GAME. 203 

Sot^e de Puree de Volaille. — Make the pur^e as above 
directed, only much thicker, adding 2 (ft. of butter ; stir it 
ncll over the fire, and whea warm add the yolks aud the 
whites of 4 or 6 eggs, according to the quantity uf meat, well 
beaten, separately : mix the whole li^hlly together, then put it 
inio a dish, and let it remain in the oven until it is firm. If 
put warm into the oven it will be ready J hour eooner, 

The^e dbhes may be made of cold fillet of veal, 

CURRY OF CUICEEX. 
21fi. — Cut up a raw chicken ; put into a etewpan, with 2 oz, 
of butter, i a large onion sliced thin, a few sprigs of parsley 
and thyme, and 2 oz. of lean ham ; let the whole sweat 
over the fire for a few minutes ; add a heaped tablespoonfiil 
of curry-powder, and a small one of flour ; shake the whole 
logethra- for 5 minutea over the fire ; put to it a pint of either 
giavy or water; let the whole go gently until the chicken is 
doue ; take out the chicken, rub the sauce through a sieve, 
boil it up, skim, put in the chicken, season with salt and 
lemon-juice to palate. Plain boiled rice to be served in a 
separate dish. 

DUMPOKHT.''—E. R. 

217> — Clean and truas a fowl, or rabbit, as for roasting; 
theo stuff it with sultana raisins, pistachio-nuts, and boiled 
rice in equal parts. Rub fine I oz. of coriander-seed, fireed 
frcMD the husks, 4 onions, a dozen peppercorns, 6 cloves, and a 
teaspoonfiil of pounded ginger. Set 12 oz. of batter in a stew- 
pan over the fire, rub the pounded ingredients over the fowl 
or rabbit, and let it fry until perfectly well browned and 
tender. Have boiled in a quart of white broth 12 oz. of rice, 
2 oz. of sultana raisins, 2 oz. of pistachio nuts, and 2 of 
almonds, the two latter blanched, and cut into thin slices. 
When the rice is nearly tender, strain off the broth, and add 
the rice to the fried fowl ; stir the whole well, that the butter 
may completely saturate the rice, and keep it near the lire to 
swell till wanted. In serving surround the fowl with the rice. 

Observe that, in pounding the onions, the juice only is used 
with the spices, or they must be rubbed and pounded so finely 

■ The dish menttoaed in tbg Aiabiaa Kighta ss tti« kid atofied with 



204 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XHI. 

as not to be perceptible. Chestnuts may be substituted for 
pistachio-nuts. 

CHICKENS.— E, R, 
218. — To boil, chickens should be plump, and very nicely 
boiled ; if wanted to be particularly good, they must be boiled 
in a blanc. It is the &shion to send them up with tufts of 
cauliflower or white brocoli, divested of stem and leaves, and 
white sauce. Many people, however, prefer the stem to the 
flower, and have it sent up separately, sliced, and covered 
with white sauce. 

. A la Carmelite, — ^Put a piece of butter the size of a walnut 
into a stewpan; as it melts dredge in flour, and when the 
whole is well mixed add a teacupful of milk. Cut up the 
chickens and put them in, adding peppercorns, an onion, and 
a blade of mace. Stew them until tender, adding milk and 
water if too dry. Take out the chickens ; have some parsley 
ready boiled and chopped; mix it with lemon-juice and a 
little white pepper; lay it upon the chickens, strain and 
thicken the sauce, add a glass of white wine, and send it to 
table garnished with chopped parsley and lemon or pickles. 

To pull Chickens, — Cut ofl* the legs and the whole back of 
a dressed chicken ; if underdone the better. Pull all the white 
part into little flakes free from skin, toss it up with a little 
cream thickened with a piece of butter mixed with flour, i a 
blade of mace in powder, white pepper, salt, and a squeeze of 
lemon. Cut off* the neck end of the chicken, and broil the 
back and side bones in one piece, and the two legs seasoned. 
Put the hash in the middle, with the back on it, and the two 
1^ at the end. 

Another way. — ^Take off" the skin, and pull the flesh ofl* the 
bone of a cold fowl in as large pieces as you can ; dredge it 
with flour, and fry it to a nice brown in butter. Drain the 
butter from it, and then simmer the flesh in a good gravy, well 
seasoned, and thickened with a little flour and butter. Add 
the juice of half a lemon. 

To fricassee Chickens, — ^After the chickens or fowls have 
been well cleaned, cut them up very nicely, and put them into 
cold water. Then put the chickens into a stewpan with a 
piece of butter, the legs first, as they require more time than 
the other joints ; dredge them very lightly with flour as they 
steWf and moisten with a little broth ; add whole white pepper, 



WtiaAT. 



. Xni.] POULTRY AND GAME. 



a feggot of parsley and thyme, and an onion. Let them iitevt 
in this way for about i an hour ; take off the butt*r and at-um ( 
reduce the sauce made from the bones, and ttiicketi it with 
cream and the yolk of an egg, and send it to table ; a little 
lemoD-juice will be necessary, and a few mushrooms are a 
great improTement. Another side-dish may be made of the 
1^ boDed and filleted, and fried in batter. In filleting take 
out the bone, skin, sinews, &c. ; make a nice forcemeat ; stuff 
and roll the fillets round. The 4 \egB will thus make 8 pieces, 
which will be sufficient for a small dish, and these may he 
augmented by small pieces of fried paste cut into cnseents, 
cockscombs, or other shapes. They must be served rouud a 
pur^e of some kind in the centre. 

To gtew Chickens in A««(e,— Take fresh-killed chickens, 
clean, cut them in pieces, and scald them in hot nater, with* 
out giving' them time to cool : fry them in butter with sweet 
herbs chopped, white pepper, and salt, then add some boiling 
water and flour ; stew them until the sauce is reduced : strain, 
and add to the sauce a tablespoonful of cream, the yolk of an 
^Ig- beaten, squeeze a little lemon-Juice over the chickens, and 
serve them up. This dish wUl be usefiil when it ia requisite 
to add to the dinner at a short notice ; and if the chickens do 
not grow cool, they will be tender. 

BLANC TO BOIL CHICKENS IN. 

219. — Cut a lb. of veal and the same quantity of fat bacon 
into small pieces, and lay them in a etewpan with i lb. of 
batter; do not allow them to brown, but while the meat is 
white pour on boiling water, adding at the same time a 
clove, i a bay-leaf, a bundle of sweet herbs, and a little 
■halot. When sufficiently stewed strain it through a h^r-sieve 
over the fowl, which must simmer in it for j of an hour. The 
veal and bacon that have been employed in this iiianc may be put 
into a mortar and pounded together for some kind of stuffing. 
It is the fiishion to lard the breasts of boiled fowls with 
tongue. 

TOAD-I!f.A-HOLE 

220. — May he thought a very humble dish, but if well 
dressed is iar from bad. Make a common batter of eggs, 
flour, and milk, but rather thicker than usual, and put in the 
centre of it a fowl boned and stufled with forcemeat, and let it 



206 MODERN DOMESTIC CXX)KERY. [Chap. XIU. 



be entirely covered with the batter ; then bake it. 2 lbs. of 
beef, or any kind of meat, may be dressed in the same manner, 
and seasoned to the palate. 

GOOSE. 

221. — Scald 4 or 6 sage-leaves, according as they are fresh 
or dry, the fresh ones being the strongest ; chop them fine ; 
take 1 large or 2 small onions, chop them, and then pour 
boiling water over them to make them eat mild ; mix the sage 
and onion with rather more than an equal quantity of fine 
bread-crumbs ; season well with pepper and salt ; put this in- 
side the body of the goose ; roast before a quick fire an hour 
or more, according to the size of the bird ; serve with gravy 
in the dish, and apple-sauce in a boat. In Ireland geese are 
sometimes stuffed with potatoes, the whole body being filled 
with them either whole or mashed ; but it absorbs so much of 
the gravy as to injure the richness of the bird. Apple-sauce 
and gravy are sent up with geese in separate tureens. 

Green Geese are roasted without any stufiing, being merely 
peppered on the inside. A lemon squeezed over a duck or a 
goose is a great improvement. 

TO STEW GIBLETS, 

222. — Stew them until the gizzards are perfectly tender: 
season them with salt and pepper, a minced shalot, and a 
very small piece of mace. Before serving, give them one boil 
and a cup of cream, with a piece of butter rubbed in a tea- 
spoonful of flour. Each gizzard and liver divided into 4, the 
neck into 3, and the wings into 2. 

DUCKS. 
223. — Roast in the same manner as goose. 

Stewed with Green Peas. — ^Truss the duck as you would a 
fowl to boil, that is, with the l^s inwards. Melt a piece of 
butter in a stewpan ; cut up in dice i inch square about | lb. 
of streaked bacon ; put the duck and the bacon into the butter. 
When the duck is browned take it out, put in a tablespoonful 
of flour, add broth or water sufiicient to half cover the duck ; 
throw in 1^ pint of peas, with an onion, and a fiiggot of parsley, 
thyme, and a bay-leaf. When the duck is done, strain off some 
of the gravy f tbickea the peas with flour and butter, add a lump

of sugar, and pepper and salt if required. The peas should 
bang together and all tlie fiit be removed. 

Or : — Put a few sage-leaves and sonie pepper inside tho 
dock, half roast it, then dredge, and put it in a sttwpan, 
with a little piece of butler, aa much waf«r as will cover it, 
an onion, a bunch of parsley and mint, pepper, and salt. Let 
it stew till nearly done, then strain the sauce ; add a pint of 
ymuig shelled peaa, and stew all together, until the whole \b 
sufficiently cooked. 

With Turnips. — Cut i a dozen turnips, and scorch or fry 
&em -with a duck in butter in a Btewpan ; then take out the 
turnips, add a little stock, an onion, pepper and salt, a bay- 
Imf, a few sage-leavex, and a sprig of diyme, and allow the 
duclE to atew gently until quite tender: then strain and thicken 
flie gravy, add the turnips lo it, and serve it up. 

Stewed with Cabbage. — Boil a cabbage, and allow it to 
< drain ; half roast a duck, and put it with the cabbage sliced 
&in into gravy, seasoned with sweet marjoram, thyme, onions, 
pepper, and salt. Slew the duck until it is done enough, then 
absin and thicken the gravy ; put the cabbage in a cloth, and 
Wpieeze it quite dry ; dish the duck upon it, and pour the 
nace round. These dishes may be made with cold roast ducks 
tbat have appeared at table ; but in that case the gravy must 
be enriched. 

Stewed in Claret. — Make a gravy of the giblets ; rub the 
duck inside and outside with pepper and a little salt; peel 
■nd mince 3 or 3 onions, and, having half roasted the duck, 
pat it into a Btewpan with the gravy and onions. Let it stew 
very gently for f of an hour, Bidding towards the end a glass 
of claret j squeeze the juice of a lemon over the duck, and 
•erre it up with fried bread or paste. The duck may be 
stuffed with forcemeat, in which a little sage should be 

To hash. — Cut a cold duck into jtnnts ; and wann it, with- 
out boiling, in gravy, a glass of port-wine, a teaspooniiil of 
made mns^id, and a little butter and flour. 

lb boil. — Put the bird for a few minutes into warm water ; 
tlien take it oat, and lay it in an earthen pan, pour a pint of 
beting milk over it, and allow it to soak for 3 hours ; dredge

it well with flour, and put it into cold water ; let it boil for 
20 minutes, and then send it to table smothered with onion- 
sauce. 

Canard farcu — Have a duck boned ; make a farce of veal 
and bacon-fat in equal proportions, chopped only ; season it 
with seasoning spice (which see) ; fill the duck ; tie it up in 
a cloth ; stew it in good gravy very gently for an hour ; take 
it up, glaze it, and serve it either with stewed peas, turnips, 
or sauce piquante. 

Ducks devilled. — Split the duck, prick it all over with a 
fork, cover it either with mustard and cayenne pepper, diavoli 
paste, or Chetney, and broil it. Serve with a glass of lemon- 
pickle, 1 of wine, and 1 of ketchup, warmed with 3 table- 
spoonfuls of gravy. If Chetney be used the sauce will not 
require sugar, otherwise add a dessertspoonful of powdered 
white sugar. 

PIGEONS, 

224. — To roast Pigeons, — Scald some parsley, chop it with 
the livers, mix them with a piece of fresh butter, season with 
pepper and salt ; put a portion inside each pigeon ; cover the 
breast with a slice of bacon-fat ; roast them ; serve with parsley 
and butter in the dish. 

Or : — Stufi^ the whole of the body of the pigeon with veal 
stuffing : some persons merely chop a little parsley and put it 
inside ; but the other is the better way. A ^ne farce, made 
of pounded veal and bacon, and bread steeped in milk, is an 
excellent stuffing for pigeons. 

Another way, — Boil, pare, and pound chestnuts in a mortar, 
with equal parts of fat bacon finely rasped ; fill the pigeons 
with this stuffing, cover them with slices of fat bacon, and 
wrap them in young vine-leaves; roast the whole together, 
and send them up with bacon and vine-leaves, which impart a 
fine flavour to the pigeons. Partridges may be dressed the 
same way, and truffles substituted for chestnuts. 

To broil Pigeons. — Cut the pigeon down the back, flatten 
and truss it as a fowl for broiling. Egg it on both sides ; 
season with pepper and salt ; dip it in chopped sweet herbs 
and bread-crumbs ; warm a little butter, sprinkle it over, and 
then dip the pigeon again in the crumbs. Eroil it a light

wn, serve vriih sauce as follows : — chop fine a few shalots, 

1 them in a tablespoonful of vinegar, then add gravy, 

cken with flour and butter, scald the liver, mince it, throw 

into the sauce; add pepper, salt, and a little ketchup, and 

or 3 mashTOoms chopped. 

A la Frangaise, — ^When the pigeons are prepared for dress- 
Ag, lay them in a dish, and pour over them 2 or 3 glasses of 
pwt wine ; let them remain for some hours. Prepare a force- 
meat of chopped sage, a little bit of onion, some fat and lean 
bacony and pepper ; moisten it with e^ or rich gravy ; stuff 
the crops of the pigeons, and put them into the stew with the 
wine, 30 corns of pepper for 6 pigeons, a blade of mace, an 
onion, and a little broth. Stew them till tender, then take 
them out, beat up the yolk of an ^^^ with some oiled butter, 
brush the pigeons thickly, cover them well with bread-crumbs ; 
let them cool a little, then repeat the process. Put them into 
the oven just to brown, strain and thicken the gravy, and send 
them up. 

A Ragout of Pigeons. — Stew the gizzards in a little 
water, with the trimmings ; chop them very small, and chop 
the liver also ; make them into a forcemeat with grated ham, 
bread-crumbs, herbs, iScc, and fill the pigeons with this force- 
meat rolled round the yolk of a hard-boiled egg. Put the 
pigeons into a stewpan, with a little butter to brown them ; 
add the gra^y from the gizzards, a little flour, and an onion ; 
let them stew very gently, and then skim the gravy ; add to it 
a glass of wine or sauce, and, having boiled up the gravy and 
thickened it, serve it with the pigeons. 

To dress Pigeons with Peas, — Put the pigeons into a stew- 
pan, with a little butter just to stift'en them ; then take them 
out, put some small slices of bacon into the pan, give them a 
fine colour, then draw them, and add a spoonful of flour to 
the butter ; then put in the pigeons and bacon, turn them, 
moisten them by degrees with gravy, and bring it to the con- 
sistence of sauce ; boil it ; season with parsley, young onions, 
a bay-leaf, and let it sinnner. When half done, put in a quart 
of peas ; shake them often ; when sufficiently done, take out 
the bay-leaf, thicken the peas with flour and butter, and dish 
the pigeons. There should be no gravy left. 

A Pupton of PigeoJis may be much diversified in the ma-

terials, but is generally thought excellent. Lay a forcemeat, 
made very savoury, in a small dish, like a paste lining ; then 
put in layers very thin slices of fiit bacon, sqiuih pigeons, 
sliced sweetbreads blanched, asparagus-tops, mushrooms, 
cocks' combs, a palate or two boiled quite tender and cut in 
slices, and the yolks of 4 eggs boiled hard. Lay more force- 
meat over the dish as a pie-crust, bake it, and turn it out 
to serve, with rich gravy in the dish ; or make it into a 
vol cm vent. 

Pigeons in Jelly are a beautiful dish, as thus : — Save some 
of the liquor in which a knuckle of veal has been boiled, or 
boil a cafTs or a neat's foot ; put the broth into a pan with a 
blade of mace, a bunch of sweet herbs, some white pepper, 
lemon-peel, a slice of lean bacon, and the pigeons. The heads 
and feet must be left on, but the nails must be clipped close ; 
bake them, and let them stand to be cold ; season them as you 
like, before baking. When done, take them out of the liquor, 
cover them close to preserve the colour, and clear the jelly by 
boiling with the whites of 2 eggs ; then strain it through a 
thick cloth dipped in boiling water, and put into a sieve. The 
fkt must be perfectly removed before it be cleared. Put the 
jelly over and roimd them rough. They must be trussed, and 
the neck propped up with skewers, to appear in a natural state, 
before they are baked. 

Another way, — ^Pick 2 very nice pigeons^ and make them 
look as well as possible by singeing, washing, and cleaning 
the heads well ; leave the heads and the feet on, but the nails 
must be clipped close to the claws ; roast them of a very nice 
brown ; and when done, put a little sprig of myrtle into the 
bill of each. Have ready a savoury jelly, as before, and with 
it half fill a bowl of such a size as shall be proper to turn down 
on the dish you mean it to be served in. When the jelly is 
cool and the birds are cold, see that no gravy hangs to the 
birds, and then lay them upside down in the jelly. Before the 
rest of it begins to set, pour it over the birds so as to be 3 
inches above the feet. This should be done full 24 hours be- 
fore serving. 

This di^ has a very handsome appearance in the middle 
zange of a second course ; or, when served with the jelly 
Toughed large, it makes a side or comer dish, its size being 
then less. The head should be kept up as if alive, by tying

226. — ^May be dressed in the same manner aa larks; or, when 
trussed for roasting, brush each bird over with the yolk 
of an e^, or, what is better, dip them in batter ; roll them in 
fine bread-crumbs, and spit them on a wooden or silver skewer, 
a dozen upon each. When spitted, brush them again with the 
%^, and dredge them with the bread-crumba ; tie the skewers 
upon a spit, and roast them before a brisk fire, basting all the 
tiiue with fresh butter : they will take about 12 minutes ; but 
if not dressed the same day on which they are killed, they will 
not be good more than the day after. 



VENISON, 

If the venison be fi«sh, merely dry it with a cloth, and 
hang it in an airy place. Should it Ite necessary to keep it 
for any length of time, rub it all over with beaten ginger. 
If it liappen to be musty, wash it, first, with lukei^arm water, 
and, secondly, with milk and water, also lukewarm. Then 
dry it very well with clean cloths, and rub it over with 
powdered ginger. Observe the same method with hare. It 
must be looked at every day, and peppered if attacked by flies. 

Venison should be tat, and k^t until quite tender. A 
haunch of buck will take 4 or 5 hours roasting ; doe, only 2^ 
Jmuis. Venisonshould be rather under than over done. Gravy

Sit it sbould be put into a boat, and not into the dish. Use 
■ater-plates, or ttave ;our plates set over heaters. Currant 
)el)y should be brought up colli. 

227. — To roast a Haunch of Veniion. — Cut off the knuckle, 
triiD the flap and remove the thick akin on the flank ; nick the 
juiot at the cramp-bone, which will make the cushion fiiUer when 
wasted. Spit it, rub it over with butter, sprinkle well with 
1^1, cover it with a sheet of veiy thin paper, then with a paste 
rf flour and water, and again irith paper; tie it up well with 
Rout string laced across it ; btiste it all the time it is 
MMting, which will be from 4 to S hours, i' of an hour 
keSve sending it to table remove the paste, throw a good 
iandful of salt on it, dredge with flour, and baste with a little 
fresh butter. 

Venison Steaks. — Cut them from the neck ; season them 
with pepper and salt. When the gridiron has been well heated 
OT^ a. bed of bright coalfi, grease the bars, and lay the steaks 
upon it- Sroil them well, turning then once, and taking care 
lo gave as much of the gravy aa possible. Serve them up with 
r WHie currajit-jelly laid on each steak. 

To hash cold Venison. — CliI the meat in nice small slices, 
aod put the trimmings and bones into a saucepan, with barely 
vater enough to cover them. Let them stew for 2 hom« ; then 
(trun the liquid into a stewpan ; add to it some bits of butter 
mlled in flour, and whatever gravy was left of the venison. 
Stir in some currant-jelly, and boil it ^ an hour : then put in 
the meat, and keep it over the fire just long enough to warm it 
through, but do not allow it to boil. 



Ought not to be thrown away even when it has been kept 
a very long time ; for when it seems to be spoiled, it may often 
be made fit for eating by nicely cleaning it, and washing with 
Tjii^^r and water. If there is danger of birds not keeping, 
draw, crop, and pick them ; then wash in 2 or 3 waters, and 
rub them with salt. Have ready a large saucepan of boiling 
water, and plunge them into it one by one, drawing them up 
and down by the legs, that the water may pass throi^h them. 
J/et them stay 5 or 6 minutes in ; then hang them up in a cold 
place. When drained, pepper and salt the indde well. By

thiB method the most delicate birds may be preserved. Before ^ 
roasting, wash them well. But, as a rule, no game should be a 
washed, for one-half the game that is sent to table is spoiled hj 3 
being saturated in water. 

In dressing Game be careful to keep a clear fire. Let it be 
done of a bright brown, but not much roasted, or the fine ^ 
flavour will be destroyed. It requires to be continually 
basted, and to be sent up beautifully frothed. Wild-fowl take *' 
a much shorter time than domestic poultry. f 

The following will give, pretty nearly, the time required 
for roasting the several birds : — ^Wild-ducks ^ of an hour, 
widgeons the same, pheasants i an hour, grouse 1 of an hour, 
quaSs 10 minutes, woodcocks 20 minutes, partridges from 20 
to 25 minutes. A hare will take an hour ; the Mnd part re- 
quires most heat, and that should be attended to, as it com- 
monly happens that the thick part of the thigh is underdone, 
as well as the shoulders. The blood stagnated round the neck 
and shoulders is not easily removed : to do this, put those parts 
into a pan of lukewarm water, and prick them with a skewer ; 
before dressing, rub and squeeze it out. 

To take off the fishy taste which wild-fowl sometimes have, 
put an onion, salt, and hot water into the dripping-pan, and baste 
them for the first 10 minutes with this ; then take away the 
pan, and baste constantly with butter. 

PHEASANTS AND PARTRIDGES. 

228. — ^Boast them, and serve with a fine gravy and bread- 
sauce in separate tureens. The cock-pheasant keeps longer 
than the hen. When cold, they may be made into excellent 
patties, but their flavour should not be overpowered by any 
admixture. 

It is not usual to stuff pheasants ; though they are some- 
times larded; but the following forcemeat will be foimd a 
great improvement. Cut a piece of lean veal into small dice, 
with about a third of bacon also minced, season it with a 
little pepper, and put it into the body of the pheasant, which 
must be tied, to prevent the escape of the stuffing, or roasted 
with the head downwards. The gravy from the veal will dif- 
fuse itself through the pheasant, and render it more juicy and 
tender, while the bacon is always to be preferred when put in- 
side a bird, though the outer larding may be more ornamental. 
Beef 13 sometimes substituted for veal. 



Cbap. Xnr.] TOT7LTRT AND GAME. 215 

Partridges, beii^ less dry than phtiasants, do Dot require 
stuffing, althongh they are improved by it, made either of 
cbestDuts or truffles and bacon. They are sometimes roasted, 
wrapped in baton and vine-leaves : bread-crumbs are essential. 
In some parts of Kent partridges are seat up with forcemeat' 
halla in the dish. 

To i.lew Partridges. — Truss them with the wings over 
the back, and the legs drawn in ; cut a piece of pork or 
bacon in long strips, and put them into a sfewpan with a piece 
of butter the sae of a walnut. Fry the bacon brown, and 
when quite done put in the partridges, and keep tunjing them 
mm they are very brown, taking care that the bacon shall be 
~ 't much on the breast as possible ; then add about a teacupfiil 
f gravy and some trimmings of meat and vegetables. Have 
■'idy a large cabbage boiled ; when well drained, slice it with 
*ter, pepper, and salt, put it while warm with the gravy to the 
ridges, and let them stew gently for an hour, turning the 
s frequently. Serve up with the bacon underneath, and the 
l2>bage round them, squeezed dry, and the sauce weE skimmed. 
"V : — Take 4 young partridges nicely cleaned, and put 
\ into a deep cooking-pot, with a piece of butter and a 
Gttle water ; put them on a brisk fire ; keep the cover of the 
pot on, and move it about constantly, to prevent the birds 
btiming or browning on the bottom. The partridges are suffi- 
cioitly cooked the instant the red gravy is seen to drip &om 
Iba luTd, and mix with the melted butter. Serve them up hot, 
wUb a small quantity of cayenne pepper. 

Satnti of Partridge. — ^Half roast the partridges, cut them 
m neatly, take off die skin ; put the trimmings in a stewpan, 
wm a bit of butter and a tablespoonful of floui ; stir the whole 
over the fire ; then add a glass of white wine and a little gravy 
«r stock, some shalots, chopped parsley, thyme, bay-leaf, 
pqiper, salt ; let it boil &st for ^ an hour ; strain, skim, add 
tiMjnice of a lemon, and make the joints of the partridge hot 
fai ute sauce. 

Or : — Roast the partrid^, leaving th«n underdone. When 
cold, cut them into pieces, taking off the skin. Put 3 spoon- 
fblB of (»1 into a saucepan, a glass of claret, salt, pepper, a 
Aalot, and the juice of a lemon. Toss the partridges in this 
imee until they are sufficiently done to send to table.

of any roasted game you may have left ; cover it with another 
dish, or tin cover, and set it over a pan of boiling water to keep 
warm. Then pomid the small bones of the carcase, with the 
inside, in a mortar, and put them into a saucepan with a little 
gravy thickened with a little flour rolled in butter, a wine-glass 
of port wine, a spoonful of ketchup, a very small piece of shalot 
chopped fine, cayenne pepper, and salt. When it has been 
boiled for J of an hour, strain it through a sieve, to form 
it into a perfect purie^ and pour it over the game in your dish ; 
garnish with forcemeat-balls, and slices of lemon cut thin. 

Broiled Partridge. — Cut the bird down the back; break 
the merrythought, which will allow it to be made quite fat ; 
cut off the feet at the joint, and skewer it as a fowl to broil ; 
dry, flour, e^^^ and sprinkle it with chopped herbs and bread- 
crumbs, well seasoned ; broil and serve with a little good 
gravy, with a mushroom or two chopped up small. 

Or : — Omit the egg and crumbs, broil it quite plain, rub 
it over with butter, season with pepper and salt, and serve 
without gravy, squeezing half a lemon over it as it leaves the 
kitchen. 

Guinea and Peafowl taste much like pheasant if properly 
hung : dress and serve the same way. Their eggs are delicate, 
and must boil H minute. 

WOODCOCKS, SNIPES, AND QUAILS, 

229. — Keep good several days. Roast them without draw- 
ing, and serve on toast : the trail of the former is the most 
esteemed part of the bird ; but the thigh and back are the best 
parts. In helping, the carver must be careful to remove first 
& small bitter bag from the trail. Or, take out the trail, chop 
it well, spread it on a buttered toast, season with pepper and 
salt, sprinkle a few crumbs over, and brown it in front of the 
fire under the woodcocks. 

Quail. — Cut a thin piece of fat bacon the size of the breast ; 
lay a vine-leaf over the breast, and then the bacon ; fasten with 
string, and roast them. 

GROUSE AND MOORCOCK.— E. R. 

230. — ^Mix a small lump of butter with a few bread-crumbs, 
and put it in the inside of the birds — not in the crop — it keeps 
them moist. They require to be nicely roasted and well basted, 



PteAP. Xm.] KJULTRY AND GAME. 217 

otherwise they become lity. Serve with fried bread-crumbs 
and bread-aauce ; in trussing, the head should be twisted under 
tbe wiagf. 

OSTOLANS. 

231. — Pick and singe, but do not draw them: tie on a 

Inrd-spit and roast them. Some persons like bacon in slices 

tied between them, but the taste of it spoib the flavour of the 

I onolan. Cover them with crumbs of bread. Melted butter, 

F irith a little grated nutm^, for sauce. 

WILD DUCKS— E. B. 

^' 232, — Must be roasted at a very brisk fire ; they take from 

I^JB to 20 minutes, according to taste. Some people are of 

mion that they should only fly through the kitcien : by epi- 

fea they are considered to be in true perfection when they 

me up dry and brown, and, when cut, flood the dish witii 

pavy. The means of ensuring success consists in a very ardent 

' in, isptd motioii of the spit, and constant basting. The 

ovTcr ahonld score the breast of the duck, put a piece of butter 

on H, and cut a lemon in half, putting aa one half a qfMxinfiil 

rf salt, and on the other a cayenne-spoonfid of cayenne ; put 

the two t(^;ether, and squeeze vigorously over the duck ; but 

those who desire to taste duck par excellence should substitute 

jiteAaree-sauce for the lemon. 

To »Uw Wild Duck, — Shred thyme, winter savory, and 
sage, very small, and put them into some strong broth, with a 
little pepper, salt, and 2 spoonfuls of wine ; stew them tc^ether 
for t of an hour ; nearly roast the ducks, add the gravy that 
fitlls from them, but not the fat ; then place a deep dish under 
tiierai, and pour this sauce through and over them into it. 
Bemove the ducks, cut them up, and put them with the sauee 
into a stewpan over a stove, and let them stew till they are 
dcHie enoi^h. 

■ Wtld Bucks, Teal, Widgeom, and Dun-birds should be 
taken up with the gravy in. Baste them with butter, and 
sprinkle a little salt before th^y are taken up, put a good gravy 
upon them, and serve with shalot-sauce in a boat. 

Landrail, Rufft, arid Sees are skewered as quails ; put thin 
dices of bacon over them, and roast them about 10 minutes. 
Serve with a good gravy in the dish.

aWARTZAIN-'E. JB. 

233. — ^Is a Dutch dish made thus : — ^Take the blood of a 
fowl or duck, stir it with a little vinegar and salt until it is 
quite cold ; then cut up the duck, or small cutlets of tender 
mutton, season it well, and stew it in a small quantity of 
water. When partly stewed add the blood, mix it well toge- 
ther, and keep stirring while it stews. By those persons who 
do not object to the ingredients, this dish will be found 
excellent. 

PLOVERS, 

234. — Roast the golden plover in the same way as wood- 
cocks and quails, without drawing ; and serve on a toast. 

Grey Plovers, — ^Draw them : they may be either roasted or 
8tewed with gravy, herbs, and spice. 

Plover^ s Eggs, — ^Boil them 10 minutes, and serve either hot 
or cold ; the former on a napkin, the latter on moss. Send to 
table with the second course. 

HA.RESf 

If properly taken care of, wiU keep a considerable time, 
and even when the cook fencies them past eatins: may be 
in the highest perfection, which they canS^ be if e!ten 4hen 
fresh killed. As they are usually paunched in the field, the 
cook cannot prevent this ; but the hare keeps longer, and eats 
much better, if not opened for 4 or 6 days, or according to the 
weather. 

If paunched, as soon as a hare comes in, it should be wiped 
quite dry, the heart and liver taken out, and the liver scalded 
to keep for the stuffing. Repeat this wiping every day ; mix 
pepper and ginger, and rub on the inside ; and put a large 
piece of charcoal into it, to prevent the musty taste occasioned 
by damp. 

Hares should never be himg by the hind legs ; for, as the 
animal is commonly kept for a week or 10 days, if so hung, 
drops of moisture will in a couple of days be seen to issue firom 
the mouth, thus draining the carcase of its natural juice. It 
should, therefore, be always suspended by ih^frre legs. 

An old hare should be kept as long as possible, if to be 
roasted. It must also be well soaked ; and while roasting it 
must be constantly basted with butter, or the skin will become 
hardened and the flesh rendered sapless. 



Chap. XIIL] POULTRY AND GAME. 219 

Hare requireB to be kept at a distance firom the fire. Send 
it to table with eonant-jdly and gravy. It is now the fiishion 
to bone hareB, which greatly improves their appearance, lessens 
the difficdlty of carving, and assists in making the gravy. 
Break the bones, and stew them in water, and any small quan- 
tity of meat parings ; boil the liver, which is to be chopped 
and put into tiie sti^ffing, in this gravy, and add a little brown- 
ing to give it a colour. 

285. — 7b roatt Hare, — After it is skinned, let it be ex- 
tremely well wiped ; and, if old, lard it, which will make it 
tender, as will also letting it lie in vinegar. If, however, it is 
put into vinegar, it should be exceedingly well washed in water 
afterwards. Put a large well-seasoned stuffing into the belly, 
and then sew it up. ^^iste it well with milk tiU half done, and 
afterwards with butter. The hare should be kept at a distance 
ftom the fire at first. Serve with a fine firoth, rich gravy, and 
currant-jelly sauce ; little gravy in the dish. For stuffing use 
the liver pounded, an anchovy, some &t bacon, a little suet, 
herbs, pepper, salt, nutmeg, crumbs of bread, and an e^ to 
bind it all. The ears must be nicely cleaned, singed, and made 
crisp, being reckoned a dainty. 

With Cream-saiLce. — Boil the liver, and chop it very fine ; 
mix a small portion with the stuffing, and reserve the remain- 
der for the sauce. Put a bunch of sweet herbs into the drip- 
ping-pan, and pour a quart of good milk over it. Baste the 
hare continually with the milk, and when it is rather more than 
half roasted take the sauce out of the dripping-pan, and put 
another quart of new milk to the herbs. Take the hare, and 
slit the neck in order that the gravy may run from it into the 
milk that has been added ; then skewer the head down again ; 
baste continually as before, until within 20 minutes of its being 
served ; then remove the milk, and baste with butter, dredgiog 
it gently with flour twice during that time : add the two quan- 
tities of milk together, stir in a lump of butter and flour ; put in 
the chopped liver, warm it over the fire, stirring all the time, 
being careful not to let it boil, as that would curdle it. The 
hare must be well wiped with a dry cloth previous to spitting, 
but on no account be washed, as that would spoil it. 

To cock a Hare Derrynane fashion, — Take 3 or 4 eggs, a 
pint of new milk, a couple of handfuls of flour ; make them 
into a batter, and, when the hare is roasting, baste it well, 



220 MODERN DOMESITC COOKERY. [Chap. Xm. 

repeating the operation until the batter thickens and forms a 
coating all over the hare : this should be allowed to brown but 
not to bum. 

Old hares should be jugged. 

Leicestershire Jugged Hare.^Skia the hare, and cut it in 
pieces, but do not wash it ; strew it over with pepper and salt, 
fry it brown. Make a seasoning of 2 anchovies, a sprig of 
thyme, a little parsley, a nutmeg grated, a little mace, a few 
cloves pounded, and a teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel. Strew 
this over the hare, after having carefully taken it out of the 
pan clear of fat : slice i lb. of fat bacon very thin, put it into 
a jug or jar, a layer of hare and one of bacon upon it, until 
the whole is put in, then add rather less than ^ pint of ale ; 
cover the jug very closely, so as perfectly to keep in the steam ; 
put it into a kettle of cold water, lay a tile on the top of the 
jug, and let it boil 3 hours if the hare be young, or 4 or 5 if 
an old one. Take the jug out of the kettle, pick out all the 
bacon which has not melted, and shake the hare up in a stew- 
pan, with a little mushroom-ketchup, a glass of port wine, 
a little mushroom-powder if at hand, and a little butter and 
flour, well mixed together to thicken the gravy. A tea- 
spoonful of lemon-pickle, and 1 of browning, will heighten 
the flavour. 

LEVERET, OR RABBIT, WITH HERBS.-E. R, 

236. — Cut either of the two into pieces, put it into a stewpan 
with butter, salt, pepper, parsley, sorrel, and young onions 
chopped. When sufficiently done, add the juice of a lemon. 
The legs may be broiled and laid on the top. 

RASBITS.^E. R, 

237. — Rabbits, being rather dry meat, are much improved 
by larding. Should the process be deemed too troublesome 
upon common occasions, a good effect may be produced by 
lining the inside of the rabbit with slices of fat bacon pre- 
viously to putting in the stuffing. This is a very easy method 
of improvement, and ought never to be neglected. 

A boned rabbit, larded, stuffed, and braised, affords a cheap 
and elegant side-dish for a dinner party. 

Roasted. — Have the rabbit trussed like a hare. Fill it with 
veal stuffing made with rather a larger proportion of marjoram

wine 1 hour before serving, and, should there not be sufficient 
sauce, a little gravy from time to time put in hot. 

Stewed laith Onions. — Cut up the rabbits, reserving the 
livers. Put a piece of butter rolled in flour into a stewpan, 
add boiling water, stirring till well mixed, a little pepper and 
salt, and then the rabbits slightly dredged with flour. Let 
them stew till tender, boil a bunch of parsley, put the liver» 
into the stew, and when they are done enough chop them with 
the parsley, a little pepper and salt, and enough cream to 
make them into sauce ; warm it up in a small saucepan, and 
spread it equally over the rabbit ; have ready 6 large onions, 
boiled and pulp^ through a sieve, and mixed up with cream. 
Put the onions into the centre of a dish, the rabbits round, and 
the gravy the last. 

Stewed with Mushrooms. — ^Boil 2 anchovies or a table^ 
spoonful of the essence in milk and water, pepper and salt, and 
an onion. Cut up the rabbit, and stew it gently until done 
enough ; then strain the gravy, add a little butter rolled in 
flour, a glass of wine, and mushrooms. Toss the whole toge- 
ther, squeeze a little lemon-juice over the rabbit, or pour 
lemon-pickle upon it, and send it to table with the sauce, and 
the liver made into forcemeat-balls. 

Quenelles de Lapereau, — Scrape the meat from a rabbit, 
which pound perfectly. Boil a calfs udder, and when cold 
pound it as fine as butter. Make a panada thus: take a 
spoonful of chopped mushrooms, as much g^een lemon-peel as 
will lay on a shilling, a very little chopped shallot and thyme, 
and a good pinch of chopped parsley, pepper and salt, and a 
piece of butter; sweat the whole over the fire; take two 
French rolls, soak the crumb in milk, squeeze it dry, add it 
and a spoonful of white sauce to the herbs, dry it over the 
fire ; when quite stifl*, take it ofl* and add the yolk of an q^. 
Put it in a cool place ; when cold take equal quantities of 
meat, udder, and panada, pound for 20 minutes, add 1 whole 
e^j try it and see if it requires more seasoning ; rub it through 
a fine sieve. Make the quenelles in tablespoons, poach them 
in boiling water for about 10 minutes : serve with white sauce, 
or white mushroom sauce. 

The Kloes of Berlin are a sort of Quenelles made of flour, 

or the soft part of bread steeped in milk ; also of rice or semo-

Melt i lb. of butter, and break into it the yollis of 6 and 
tbe whites of 4 eggs, seasoned with a little salt, pepper, and 
wtmeg ; all wliipped ti^ether in 3 small cups of milk, and 
Hide into a. paste by the proper addition of flour. From this 
pute form balls of a moderate size— for they will swell in the 
boaittg water, in which they must be left for 8 to 10 miimtes. 
Dm take them out with a skimmer, and serve them either as 
igamish for ra^flts and dishes of vegetables ; or else piled

Pilau of Habbit.— Cut up a rabbit or fowl ; pound a couple 
of onions in a mortar; extract the juice, and mix it with a

Mce of a lemon : rub this into the meat ; cut up 2 onions

Have 1 lb- of rice half boiled in broth ; put the whole meat,

half a dozen cloves, and a little more salt. Secure the

in a toaster before the fire, and keep them frequently turned 
tUl they are quite crisp, which will be in about 6 or 8 
minutes. 

To fry Parsl^.—Whea the parsley has been washed and 

iharoughly dried, throw it into 

lard or butter which is on the i

FRIED BREAD FOR GARNISHING, 

239, — Take slices of stale bread about a third of an inch 
thick, cut them into shapes with a paste-cutter, fry them in 
fresh butter a light brown, lay them upon a cloth to dry, and 
place them round the dish. They may be made to adhere 
by brushing the imder part with a little flour mixed with white 
of egg. 

JBread'Crumbs, — All game and small birds are improved 
by the addition of bread-crumbs, either fried or toasted ; the 
latter is the more delicate preparation : grate the cnmibs, and 
put them into a tin shallow dish before the fire, shaking them 
occasionally until they are well browned : send them up in the 
dish ; with a tureen of good brown gravy made from the insides 
and trimmings of the birds, but without any kind of seasoning. 



SALT-WATER PISH. 



CHAPTER XTV. 
K SALT-WATER FISH. 

^DlK great excellence nf Ettglhh Jish, and the fresh state ia 
«liicli it is, in London, generally brought to table, combined 
with, the simplicity of our national tastes in cookery, render 
it annecessary to resort to mueh art in the preparation of the 
fino- kinds, which are uaually preferred simply boiled, broiied, 
or filed ; but this only holds good with the superior varieties, 
whereas skate, halibut, ling, plaice, flounders, mackerel, and 
many others, may be much improved by the method of dressing 

L^ There is perhaps no article of eatables in which imposition 
Vh more practised in London than in iish ; and if you are 
J not yourself a good judge, you will be almost sure to be de- 
craved unless you always deal with the same fishmonger, and 
he is of respectable character; for the lower class of petty 
dealers never have in their shops any of the finer sorts of 
good quality. Tou must therefore either pay a good price, 
or confine yourself to those ordinary species winch are in com- 
moa use and plentifid in the market. The following hints 
may, however, be useful in forming a judgment of the different 
aorte: — 

Preparatory to the dressing, the fish should be carefiJIy 

Etted by the fishmonger, and afterwards cleaned thoroi^hly 
the cook from all appearances of blood, particularly scraping 
i blood that lodges about the back-bone, and cutting the fish 
open for some distance below the vent. If, however, the fish- 
monger does not clean it, fish is seldom very nicely done, for 
eoaunon cooks are apt not to slit the fish low enough, by 
wfaich, and not thoroughly washing the blood, &c., from the 
bone, a very di^nsting mass is left within, and mistaken for 
liver ; but fishmongers generally wash it b^ond what is ne- 
cessary for cleanii^, and by perpetual watering diminish the 
flavour. It should, in fact, be handled as little as possible, 



226 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIY. 

and never left in the water a moment after it is washed. In 
washing it, the best way is to hold the fish finnly by the head 
with your left hand, and scrape off the scales or slime ; wash 
it once in clean cold water, and either dry it with a towel or 
hang it up and leave it to drain. 

Some kinds of fish will bear keeping better than others, but 
few are improved by it ; some kinds are said to lose much of 
their delicacy and peculiar flavour every hour after the tide in 
which they were caught is lost. Turbot is stated to improve 
by keeping for a day or two ; * but the acknowledged superiority 
of the Dublin Bay turbot is said to arise from its being dressed 
immediately upon being caught, ^^ as it then tastes as if it had 
been boiled in cream." Salmon, in losing a tide, loses a por- 
tion of the fine white curd which intervraies between each flake, 
and subsequently becomes more rich, but changes its character, 
the large flakes disappearing with the curd with which they 
are amalgamated. '' Much idso depends upon knowing in what 
way each particular fish may be cooked so as to make its 
appearance to the greatest advantage. Many there are that 
are unpalatable when dressed in one particular way, but very 
good if another mode of cooking be adq[)ted. A stewed carp 
aflbrds a really splendid dish, a boiled carp one of the worst 
that can be brought to table. The merits of a sur-mullet 
broiled, baked, or fried, enveloped in white paper, with its 
liver for sauce, are too well known to require any comment ; 
and yet, when simply boiled and gutted as you would a 
whiting, it is a sad woolly and insipid affair."^ The crimping 
of fish causes it to eat crisp, and so improves the firmness 
if it be woolly ; but it is imnecessary to perform the ; opera- 
tion while the«jiimal is alive, though it should be done soon 
afterwards. 

Fish that is to be boiled must be put on the fire in cold 
hard water ; when it boils, skim with the greatest care ; throw 
in a little cup of cold water to check the extreme of heat, 
then keep it simntering only, lest the outside break before the 
thick and inner part be done ; but " crimped fish" shoidd be 
put into boiling water, and simmered a few minutes. A large 
handful of coarse salt, with a small piece of saltpetre, and a 

» Ude — who ought to he a good judge — states, in his * Cookery/ from his 
many years* ohservation, " that a turbot kept two or three days is much 
better eating than a fresh one." — p. 238. 

* FJscator on Fish, p. 8. 



Cbap. XIV.] SALT-WATER FISH. 227 

fittle honeradidi, should be also put into the water in which 
fish IS boiled; aiid it is rendered firmer by the addition of 
2 or 3 spoonfiils of vinegar. In France they add to this a 
quntity of qpice, thyme, laurel-leaves, and garlic ; and, as 
wine is there cheap, they sometimes use vin ordinaire instead 
of water. This, however, is not thrown away, for it is equally 
good when reboiled. Cod, haddock, and whiting, eat firmer if 
a little salt be put into their gills, and they be hung up a few 
kmrs before dressing. 

Care must be taken to preser\'e the roe, milt, and liver 
wiiole ; to let them be sufficiently dressed ; and to place them 
eonqpicuouslj when served. The sound adhering to the bone 
■nut be left there, but very carefully cleaned. When the fish 
u dished up, it should be placed at once upon the table. To 
jn^ if a large fish be sufficiently boiled, draw up the fish- 
plate, and with a thin knife try if the fish easily divides from 
the bone in the thick parts, which it will when done enough. 
Keep it hot, not by letting it sodden in the water, but by laying 
the fish-plate crossways on the kettle, and covering with a thick 
doth wetted with hot water ; for if left in the water after it 
is ready, it loses its firmness, and becomes woolly. Always 
serve boiled fish on a double napkin, and put the white side of 
flat fish upwards. On this subject, although aware of the more 
&shioaable mode being to lay the fish on a silver drainer, we 
still hold to the antiquated folded napkin, the neat white- 
ness of which equals silver in appearance, while its texture 
better drains the moisture from the fish. The dish certainly 
looks more complete if fried fish be served round the boiled ; 
but this should be confined to the small fry of smelts or 
gudgeons, alternately placed with the roe or milt, merely as 
a g^amish. Great care is necessary to drain the water from 
the boiled fish, that their dryness and colour may not be 
lessened. 

In the frying offish^ one great point is to prepare it pro- 
perly. Take, for instance, a sole, lay it on a cloth, wipe it 
thoroughly dry on both sides, then dredge it with flour, beat 
up an e^%^ and lay it on with a brush, strewing on it finely- 
grated bread or biscuit crumbs ; have the fat so boiling hot 
that all the hissing and bubbling must have subsided before 
the fish is put in, and let the quantity not be stinted, or the 
fish, M'hen taken out, will be greasy. The fryingpan must be 
put upon a clear cinder fire, and not left for a moment imtil 

Q 2 



228 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIV. 

the fish is done at a moderate rate, neither too quick nor too 
slow ; and when done, lay it upon a cloth or writing-paper to 
drain off the &t. 

Hog's-lard and butter are the materials most generally used, 
as are also the drippings from roast meat ; for a great preju- 
dice exists in England against frying with oil, arising no doubt 
partly from expense as well as dislike, although it is more 
delicate than any fatty substance that can be employed for 
that purpose. Throughout the southern countries of Europe 
nothing else is ever us^ in the frying of either fish or meat of 
any kind, and dishes thus dressed ever appear superior on the 
foreign tables to those of our own. The oil, if skimmed when 
done with, may be employed again until entirely used ; and 
lard, if poured into cold water when melted, will harden on 
the surface. The largeness of quantity does not therefore 
occasion additional cost ; and even should meat be fried in it 
after fish, it will occasion no unpleasant flavour. 

In broiling Jishj care should be taken to make the gridiron 
very hot, and to rub the bars with butter previously to using. 
Fish prepared for broiling, after it is washed, should be rubbed 
well with vinegar, dried in a cloth, and floured — ^the vinegar 
preserving the skin entire, and the flour preventing it sticking 
to the bars. A cinder or a charcoal fire is the best, but a little 
salt thrown on a coal fire will check the smoke, and cause it 
to bum like embers. 

In the dressing of flat fish as cutlets, the fillets should be 
lifted from the bones, and the spine which runs through the 
centre of the round sorts should be extracted. 

The stewing of fish, and dressing it in fillets or cutlets, re- 
quires considerably more care in the cookery, as well as cost 
in the ingredients, than either of the previous modes; and 
as a preliminary to the operation, a gravy should be got ready, 
to be made in the following manner : — Take out all the bones, 
cut ofi* the heads and tails, and, if this should not be sufficient, 
add a flounder, an eel, or any small common fish ; stew them 
with an onion, pepper, salt, and sweet herbs ; strain it, and 
thicken it to the consistence of cream, flavouring with a slight 
addition of wine or any other sauce. The French employ the 
commonest sorts of their wine as a marinade, or sauce, both 
for the boiling and stewing of fish ; and that of English growth 
may be substituted in this country, if the cheaper kinds of 
jRfreign wine should be thought too expensive. Families who 



CttAP. XrV.] SALT-WATER FISH. 229 

bve no hamo-made wine of their own may use cider instead, 
but it will not affi>rd the flavour of wine of even an inferior 
deflcriptioD. Indeed, those who look closely to economy, and 
vfao are satisfied with a more homely style of cookery, fre- 
quently subfltitate a quart of ale inst^ of the wine or cider, 
tog;ether with a small quantity of chili vinegar, a glass of soy 
oressenoe of anchovy, to which fennel, chives, thyme, and 
biy-leaves may be added according to fancy ; and an excellent 
amoe may thus be prepared, if mixed with the judgment of a 
good palate. 

MARINADE 

240. — ^Is commonly used in France for the purpose of boiling 
iiih, which imbibes from it a more pleasant flavour than it 
utuxally possesses, and has been so generally adopted by 
English professed cooks that we here insert the receipt : — Cut 
up 2 carrots, 3 onions, half a dozen shalots, a single clove of 
garlic, and put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter, a 
bonch of parsley, and a bundle of sweet herbs ; fry the whole 
fiv a few minutes, then add, very gradually, 2 bottles of any 
light wine or of cider. Put in a handful of salt, two dozen of 
peppercorns, the same quantity of allspice, and a couple of 
cloves. Simmer the whole together for li hour, strain the 
liquor, and put it by for use. 

This marinade, if carefully strained afler the fish has been 
taken out, will serve several times for the same purpose, adding 
a little water each time. Fish dressed in it should simmer very 
gently, or rather stew than boil, as it aflbrds to mackerel, fresh 
herrings, perch, roach, and any of the small river fish, the ad- 
vantage of dissolving, or so thoroughly softening their bones 
as to render them more agreeable in eating. For large fish, 
they should be cut into steaks before being marinaded. Instead 
of the wine or cider, a quart of table-beer, a glass of soy, 1 of 
essence of anchovies, and 1 of ketchup, may be used ; or a 
pint of vinegar and these sauces, fennel, chives, thyme, and 
bay-leaves, may be added with the wine, cider, &c. Or, 
choose a kettle that vAW suit the size of the fish, into which 
put 2 parts water, 1 of light (not sweet) white wine, a good 
piece of butter, some stewed onions and carrots, pepper, salt, 
2 or 3 cloves, and a good bunch of sweet herbs ; simmer i of 
an hour, let it become cold, then boil the fish therein. Serve 
with anchovy-sauce and a squeeze of lemon. 



230 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XTY. 

TURBO T, 

241. — Boiled, — Let it be dried immediately after its being 
wsushed, for if left in the water it will become soft ; see that 
the kettle be large enough to contain the fish without injury 
to its fins ; rub the fish well with a lemon and a little sEiIt ; 
have ready hard water sufficient to thoroughly cover it ; throw 
in salt in the proportion of 1 lb. to 6 quarts of water, with a 
little horseradish. Before putting the turbot into the kettle, 
make a cut down to the bone through the middle of the dark 
side, in order to prevent the skin from cracking, and see that 
the fishmonger has tsdcen 2 joints out of the neck. 

Let it boil gently. If of a moderate size, about 8 lbs., it 
will take about 20 minutes. Slip the turbot, with the white 
side uppermost, upon a hot cloth doubled up on the centre of 
the dish, and serve it up with a garnish of scraped horseradish 
and parsley, with slices of lemon. 

The sauce should be made of lobster, with, if possible, the 
ccnral, or spawn. Shrimps are, however, sometimes substituted ; 
and, in France, caper-sauce is the most usual. 

Cold boiled Turbot, eaten with caX and vinegar, or with a 
well-dressed salad, is excellent ; and, in summer, the addition 
of a cucumber, whether the fish be hot or cold, is thought an 
improvement. 

Stewed, — Cut a small fish into square pieces, flour and fiy 
until it is brown ; after which drain it fh)m the fat upon a 
hair sieve, and proceed as for stewed eels. 

A la Creme, — The remains of a cold turbot may be warmed 
either in a white saiice maigre, a la Creme, or in Bechamel , 
or any of the rich meat sauces. The fish should be, in each 
of these modes, cut from the bones, stripped of the dark skin, 
but that of the silver side left on, and heated in either of these 
sauces, without being fried. 

JBahed, — Take a small fish, dry and flour it, make a little 
butter hot, which brush thickly over the white side of the fish ; 
sprinkle it well with pepper and salt ; butter a baking-dish, 
lay on the fish with the white side uppermost, bake for about 
i an hour. For sauce, a little melted butter and the gravy 
from the fish. 

BRILL 

242. — la a fi^h so much resembling turbot in appearance as 



Chap. XIVJ SALT-WATER FISH. 231 

to be not unfiequently passed off for it, and, if firm, it may 
deodve many who are not good judges ; but it is more fre- 
queutly of a woolly nature, and fiur inferior in value. It is 
Burower and thinner than turbot, seldom weigliing more than 
10 lbs. ; it requires sealing on both sides, and is witliout those 
thorny spines which are found on the dark side of the turbot. 
It is in season at the same time, and may be dressed in the 
■me manner ; it is sometimes ser\'ed without the accompani- 
nent of lobster-sauce ; sauce made of crabs is preferred by 
nany persons. 

JOHN DORY 

243. — ^Is in season from summer until the close of autumn, 
It which period it is in the greatest perfection ; it is a scarce 
fish, bearing as high a price in London as the turbot. The 
skin bears a slime which should be scraped off, or it will 
impart a disagreeable odour to the dory when brought to 
table. It is very firm, eating much like the claw of lobster, 
and is usually plain boiled, but may be dressed in either of 
the modes above described : if boiled, it should be served with 
Dutch sauce, though anchovy, shrimp, or caper sauce will be 
found very delicate. A dory of 5 to 6 lbs. will take about 20 
minutes from the time of putting into cold water until done. 

Baked. — Proceed as for turbot baked, sprinkling some 
chopped parsley over the fish, and serve with Dutch sauce 
round. 

JBroiled. — Dry, flour, butter, and season some small dories, 
cut some papers to fit them, screw up the edges tight, and 
broil ; serve with cold butter, or melted butter in a boat. 

PLAICE 

244. — Comes into season about May, and lasts throughout 
the remainder of the year ; it is the largest of the flounder 
tribes and grows to the size of 6 to 8 lbs., though half that 
weight is more common. If in good condition, the appear- 
ance of the pale side should have a slight reddish tinge, the 
body should be tolerably thick and firm, and the eyes bright. 
It is, however, in very little estimation, and of so watery a 
nature, that it is usual to cut them in two, and wrap them in a 
towel with a hea\'y weight upon it to extract the fluid ; the 
fish is then sprinkled with a little salt and hung up for some 
hours to dry, and never skinned. When plain boiled, it is 



232 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIY. 

served with either parsley and butter or anchovy-sauce, and 
will only take a very few minutes in boiling. 

It is frequently cut in pieces and fried in bread-crumbs, 
with plain melted butter for sauce. 

FLOUNDERS AND DABS 

246. — Are best in the latter part of autunm, and the good- 
ness of their condition may be known in the same, manner as 
plaice. They are both sea and river fish. The Thames pro- 
duces a superior kind, considered as a delicacy when either 
plainly fried or dressed in butter, for they are seldom stewed 
and never boiled. Sauce of any kind is seldom used, and they 
are best eaten with only a squeeze of lemon. 

SOLES. 

246. — Fried. — Take off the skin of the dark side, and allow 

that of the other side to remain. Fry them over a brisk fire ; 

and when one side is done, turn it by sticking a fork in the 

head and putting a fish-sHce under the tail. A sole of ^ lb. 

weight will take 5 or 6 

minutes for each side. 

Plain melted butter is 

the most usual sauce, as 

the guests may add what 

flavour they please from 

the fish-cruets. 

^ ^, , - ^ , Cutlets, — Cut the sole

in pieces crosswise, about

the black skin, leave on the other, and serve with the white

crumbs of bread or in batter.

is, after frying, to stew it in port-wine and beef gravy, or 
stroag veal broth and white wine.

-Jb Am Portmgjme way. — ^Take out the bone, and put the 
fljjk into a pan with a few spoonfuls of oil and some lemon- 
jiiioa ; .fty it a few minutes, then lay the fish on a dish, spread 
a^imcineat OTer each piece, and roll it round, &stening the 
inDa with a few small skewers, and either frying them in 
tatter, or with crumbs of bread in buttered papers. Lay the 
idDa in a small earthen pan, beat an e^ and wet them, then 
ibww cnmibB over, and put the remainder of the eg^^ with a 
Itde meat gravy, a spoonful of caper-liquor, an anchovy 
diopped fine, and some parsley chopped into the bottom of 
Ibe pan ; cover it close, and bake in a slow oven till the fish 
li done enough. Garnish with fried or dried parsley. 

To make meat stuffing for the above. — ^Pound cold beef, 
mutton, or veal, a little ; then add some fiit bacon that has 
been slightly fried, 2 small or button onions, a little garlic or 
shalot, parsley, anchovy, pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; pound all 
fine with a few crumbs, and bind it with 2 or 3 yolks of eggs. 

SKATE, THORNBACK, AND RAY, OR MAIDS, 

247. — Grow to a large size, and are in the highest perfection 
during the autunm and winter. 

They may be either broiled, or fried with ei^ and bread- 
crumbs ; or, if of a tolerable size, the parts usually eaten may 
be boiled, and the fins firied. The wings are previously 
skinned, cut into strips about 2 inches wide, and kept for 
2 or 3 days in salt and water ; as being the best mode of 
extracting a raw kind of rankness that is often found in them 
when dressed too fresh. If kept until cold and eaten with 
oil and vinegar, or dressed in a marinade and served with* 
crab-sauce, they have a good flavour. 

Crimped Skate, and Maids, should be hung 1 day at least 
before they are dressed ; and may be served either boiled, or 
fried in crumbs, being first dipped in e^. 



234 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIV. 

HALIBUT, OR HOLIBUT, 

248. — Partakes somewhat of the flavour of the turbot, and 
^rows to an enormous size, being sometimes caught weighing 
more than a cwL ; the best size is, however, from 20 to 40 lbs., 
as, if much larger, it is coarse. The most esteemed parts are the 
flakes over the fins, and the pickings about the head ; but on 
account of its great bulk it is commonly cut up and sold in 
coUops, or in pieces of a few lbs. weight, at very reasonable 
rates. A small one cut in thin slices and crimped is very 
good eating. 

To collop Halibut — Cut the fish into nice cutlets, of about 
an inch thick, and fry them ; then put them into a broth made 
of the bones, 4 onions, a stick of celery, and a bundle of sweet 
herbs, boiled together for i an hour. Strain this broth, thicken 
it, and stew, the fish for i an hour, adding salt, pepper, a 
grating of nutmeg, and pounded mace, a spoonfiil of soy or 
fish-sauce, and half that quantity of lemon-juice, with a Uttle 
shred lemon-peel. 

Or : — The collc^ may be fried in batter, or with beaten 
eggs and crumbs of bread ; or if made into cutlets, cut quite 
thm, and fried in sweet oil, without egg and bread-crumbs, 
are very good if eaten with sauce a la Tartare. 

To stew the Head of Halibut. — Put a pint of beer, or any 
kind of wine, a few anchovies, an onion stuck with cloves, a 
bunch of sweet herbs, and some pepper, into a stewpan ; fill 
it nearly with water, though ale, without water, is used by 
many good cooks, and stew it for an hour : then strain it, and 
put in the head of a halibut, stew it till tender ; when done 
enough, thicken the gravy with butter and flour, add a little 
fish-sauce, and serve it up with forcemeat-balls made of a part 
of the fish, pounded, and rolled up with crumbs of bread, thyme, 
marjoram, and nutmeg, bound together with the yolk of an egg. 
If the fish has been stewed in plain water, a glass of wine should 
then be added to the sauce. 

CODFISH, HAKE, AND LING, 

249. — There are various species of these fish caught upon our 

coasts, and salted, but the cod most commonly brought fresh 

to the London market is chiefly found on the Dogger-bank. 

Hake and ling, though both good fish, are seldom used by 



Chap. XTV.] SALT-WATER FISH. 235 

any but the lower orders. They are, however, all of the same 
^lecies, weig^, and time of coming into season. They may 
also be dressed in the same manner as halibut. 

Codfish reaches to a very large size — 30 lbs. being not an 
unusual weight, though 15 to 20 lbs. is a more general average, 
and the nearer the £h is to that weight, the better will it be 
fiiimd ; those much smaller being frequently of a flabby, watery 
nature, as '^ codlings," which are seldom worth eating. They 
are in season from the banning of October till the middle of 
March, but are in the highest perfection about Christmas, at 
which time the females are full of roe, which they spawn some 
time in February, soon afler which they begin to decline and 
become emaciated. 

Some people boil the whole fish at once ; but a large head 
and shoulders contain all the fish that is proper to be helped ; 
the thinner part being overdone and tasteless before the thick 
is ready. 

Cods Head and Shoulders, — ^The fish will eat much finer 
by having a little salt rubbed down the bone and along the 
thick part, even if it be eaten the same day. Tie it up with 
several folds of broad tape to bind the head and prevent the 
cheeks from breaking, then lay the fish on the fish-plate, put 
it on the fire in cold water to completely cover it : throw in 
a handful of salt with a glass of vinegar and some horse- 
radish. Let the water be kept only just on the boil till the 
fish is done, which, if of a good average size, will take about 
\ an hour, and may be known by lifting the fish-plate, and 
trying with a fish-slice whether the meat can be easily separated 
from the backbone. If the cod be crimped it will take less 
time than if dressed in its solid state, but it should then be 
put into hot water. The spawn and liver will take more 
time in boiling than the fish. When ready for the table, 
garnish with a large quantity of double parsley, lemon, horse- 
radish, and the milt, roe, and liver : if with smelts, be careful 
that no steam from the boiled fish hangs about the fibsh, or the 
beauty of the smelts will be taken off, as well as their flavour. 
Serve with plenty of oyster-sauce, or, if that be not attainable, 
muscle or cockle flavoured with a glass of wine ; or else 
anchovy. 

Cod^s Head roasted, — Boil the fish little more than half 
the time ; then carefully strip oft' the skin, dredge it well with 



236 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIV. 

flour and set it before a brisk fire, baste it all the time with 
butter until it froths ; then, when the froth begins to rise, throw 
over it some very fine white bread-crumbs ; and when of a fine 
brown, dish it up with a garnish of lemon cut in slices, scraped 
horseradish, and barberries, with the roe and liver cut in slices, 
and a few small fried fish or fried oysters laid round it. 

Stuffed, — Cut the head with a part of the shoulders, and 
take as much of the tail as will fill the head, then tie up both 
at the mouth and shoulders with packthread ; make a brown 
sauce with beef-soup and a little strong ale, season it with 
a spoonful of ketchup, some salt, and cayenne pepper ; then 
put in the head and stew it over a slow fire. When ready, add 
a glass of wine and a little lemon-juice. 

Tail of Codfish, — ^The lower parts near the tail are generally 
cut from the head and separately dressed, in which case the 
best mode is either to fry it of a fine brown, with sliced onions, 
and stew it with a good white gravy, a little curry-powder, a 
bit of butter and flour, and 3 or 4 spoonfuls of rich cream ; or 
cut it into cutlets and plainly broU them upon the gridiron, 
with oysters to surround them, and without any other sauce 
than melted butter ; they are still better when done as veal 
cutlets, either with or without oysters. 

To bake Codfish. — Butter a pan, lay the fish in it with a 
bundle of sweet herbs, an onion stuck with 6 cloves, a spoonful 
of black and white pepper, salt, and a quart of water : flour 
the fish, stick it over with pieces of butter, and add to it rasp- 
ings of bread. When sufficiently baked, take out the fish 
carefully, strain the gravy, thicken it, and add to it a pint of 
shrimps, i pint of oysters, a spoonful of essence of anchovies, 
and a glass of Harvey or Reading sauce ; warm all together, 
and pour it round the fish ; garnish with lemon, crisped 
parsley, and fried bread, or paste. 

Codlings are very good dressed in this manner. 

Codfish au gratin, — ^This is the best mode of using the 
remains of a dressed codfish. Put some cold oyster-sauce at 
the bottom of a pie-dish, then a layer of the codfish (seasoned 
with pepper, salt, and an atom of nutmeg), with any of the 
liver and sound that remains ; then repeat the layers of sauce 
and fish until the dish is full ; cover it with bread-crumbs, 
sprinkle a Jittle butter over, and bake for about i an hour. 



Chap. XIV.] SALT-WATER FISH. 237 

To siew Codfish, — Cut the cod into slices, season them 
with pepper anud salt, put them into a stewpan with i pint 
of water, some good gravy, i pint of wine, the juice of i a 
kanon, a dozen or two of oysters with their liquor, a piece of 
butter rolled in flour, and 2 or 3 blades of mace. When the 
flah is sufficiently stewed, which will be in i of an hour, 
serve it up with the sauce. Any kind of fish-sauce may be 
substituted for the wine, and a variety given by employing 
anchovies instead of oysters. 

A la Provengale. — ^Having soaked the fish until it is tender, 
mince it up with a small quantity of garlic, scraped horse- 
ladish, and parsley ; then put it into a stewpan, with white 
wine and oil of equal amount to cover it, put it over a mode- 
rate fire, and keep constantly shaking it until the ingredients 
are thoroughly mingled to the thickness of cream. 

In England, where garlic and oil are so generally disliked, 
the former may be omitted, and white sauce or cream may be 
substituted for oil ; but if wine be used, it must be carefully 
mixed to avoid the curdling of the cream. 

Cod Sounds may be dressed in various ways, and form a 
good maigre dish. Soak them in warm water a few hours, then 
scrape and clean ; boil them in milk and water till tender ; 
serve them in a napkin with egg-sauce. Dress cod-tongues in 
the same way. 

En ragout, — Prepare as above ; then stew them in white 
gravy seasoned ; cream, butter, and a small quantity of flour 
added before you serve, gently boiling it up. A bit of lemon- 
peel, nutmeg, and the least pounded mace, should give the 
flavour. 

Or: — Wash 3 large sounds nicely, and boil in milk and 
water, but not too tender : when cold, put a forcemeat of chop- 
ped oysters, crumbs of bread, a bit of butter, nutmeg, pepper, 
salt, and the yolks of 2 eggs ; spread it thin over the sounds, 
and roll up each, skewering it ; dust a little flour over, and 
roast them in a tin oven slowly. When done enough, pour 
over them a fine oyster-sauce. Serve for side or corner dish 
at the first course. 

SALT FISH, 

250. If very dry, should be soaked for several hours in 
soft water ; then soaked again, and afterwards brushed with 



238 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIV. 

a hard brush. Under this treatment the most stubborn fish 
will swell considerably if boiled gently : two separate soakings 
are better than one, however continuous, since the alternate 
expansion and contraction loosens the fibres of the fish, and 
occasions it to come off in finer flakes. 

Boiled, — Cut a nice square piece of codfish, after soaking 
put it on in soft water and boil it very gently ; lay a napkin 
over the dish, place the fish in the centre, garnish with 
parsnips cut in moderate pieces, eggs cut in quarters, and 
parsley ; fold the 4 comers of the napkin over the fish and 
send to table ; eggnsauce in a boat. A salted sound, soaked 
for 24 hours and boiled in milk and water, is an admirable 
addition. 

Or : — Lay the piece you mean to dress all night in water 
with a glass of vinegar ; boil it enough, then break it into 
flakes on the dish ; warm it up with cream and a large piece 
of butter rubbed with a bit of flour, and serve it as above with 
^g-sauce. 

Fricasseed, — Salt fish that has been boiled and left until 
cold is an excellent dish when warmed ; break it into flakes, 
and put it into a pan with sauce thus made: beat boiled 
parsnips in a mortar, then add to it a cup of cream, a good 
piece of butter rolled in flour, a little white pepper, and i a 
teaspoonful of mustard, all simmered together ; keep the fish 
no longer on the fire than to become hot, but not boil. 

Or : — Shred the fish into very small pieces, break up potatoes 
which have been already boiled, and put them along with the 
fish under the rolling-pin, so as to reduce the whole nearly to a 
paste. Then mix with it some hard-boiled eggs, minced fine ; 
put the whole into a stewpan to warm with a good piece of 
butter, and send it up with egg-sauce. Should you prefer not 
to mix them, build a wall of mashed potatoes, put the fish in 
the centre, and heat in a Dutch oven ; if you have a parsnip, 
mash it, and add it to the mass. 

In Spain, bcu^ccdito, or dried fi&h, is generally minced, and 
fried in oil with eggs, and although a homely, is an excellent 
dish. 

ffAWOCK, 

251. — They are in season from June till January, and their 

condition may be tested in the same manner as cod ; but they 

abould he immedisLtelj gutted, much below the vent, and care- 



CiiAP. XrV-l SALT-WATER FISH. 239 

fiillj cleaned, to prevent the rancidily which would otherwise 
be occasioned to their flavour by the oiliness of the liver, if it 
be allowed to remain in the body. The gilla and eyes shoitld 
iIm be taken out, and a very little wit put into the body, 
which should be hung up for a short time to dry. Their aver^ 
tee weight rarely esceeds 4 to 5 lbs., but the larger they are 
the belter they will generally be found, their flrmiiesii being 
the greatest merit in their quality, and depending much upon 
their size. The Sail is very delicate in favour, and is most 
asiiallT left unskinned : plainly boiled, very fast, for abowt 
1 of an hour, or 20 minutea if it be largu. It may be served 
with parsley and butler, or oysler-sauee. 

to fry. — If of a very small size, they may be turned round 
with their tails run through their Jaws ; but this catmot be 
done when they are large ; thty are in that case either cut in 
dices or filleted, and fried with crumbs of bread and egg. 

To broil. — The fish ia either scored or skinned, and split up, 
iHvehed over with a feather dipped in oil, peppered and salted, 
mid laid whole upon the gridiron, without either cruniha of 
bread or egg, and eaten, if it \ib fresh, with only a squeeze of 
lemon, or some anchovy-sauce; if dried and mlted, as the 
Findhom, or, as they are commonly called "Finnan had- 
dock," they are merely used as a breaktant relish, without any 
mice or condiment but a spoonful of mustard. 

To bake. — The scales should be scraped off, but the tail and 
head must not be removed, though the spinal bone should be 
taken out and the body stuffed with any approved forcemeat. 

The Scottish mode ofbahii^ is: — Take 2 good-sized had- 
docks, clean, and wipe them well in a cloth, but do not wash 
them ; keep the breasts as whole as possible. Strew salt over 
them, and lay them on a board for several hours ; then wipe 
the ^t from them, cut off the heads and fins, cut the skin 
through down the back, and take it off neatly, being careAil 
to keep the fish whole. Beat up the yolks of 3 eggs, dip each 
in the e^, have ready some bread-crumbs, mixed with pep- 
per, salt, and chopped parsley ; roll the fish in the crumbs, and 
stuff the heads and breasts with oysters chopped, but not too 
small, and bread-crumbs blended with an e^. Butter a dish, 
lay the fish upon it, stick pieces of butter upon each, and bake 
thiem. For tauce, fake a pint of veal gravy, the same quantity 
of cream, mix 2 table^KX>nfnls of flour in a little of the cream, 



240 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIV. 



cold, and boil all together until it is smooth ; serve with a 
blade of mace, a little nutmeg, salt, and a whole onion. When 
about to dish, take out the onion, and add a glass of wine, with 
the yolk of an egg well beaten : lay the heads of the fish at 
each end ; pour t£e sauce over, and garnish with lemon. 

To stew, on a maigre day. — ^Trim the haddock, by cutting 
off the head, tail, and fins, and taking out the bones. Put 
these trimmings in a quart of water, with a few peppercorns 
and an onion, and let them stew very slowly for i an hour. 
Then strain off the gravy, flour the fish weU and fry it ; after 
which, return it to the stock, adding cayenne pepper, some 
acid sauce, and ketchup, or essence of anchovy ; and serve it 
up in a deep dish. It is thus an economical dish ; and, if the 
gravy be made rich, it will be found very good. 

The Scotch dish called " Cropped Heads *^ — Parboil the 
roe ; mix it with double its quantity of pounded hard biscuit, 
salt, pepper, and a beaten egg ; stuff haddocks' heads with 
this mixture, and fry them in beef dripping. Prepare a sauce 
• of beef gravy, fried onions and flour, a teacupful of ketchup, 
the same of pickled muscles, and add it to the heads ; sinuner 
15 minutes. If a large dish be wanting, serve 2 boiled 
haddocks in the middle. 

WHITING. 

252. Their highest season is during the first 3 months of 
the year, when they spawn, but soon recover, and remain in 
good order throughout the remainder of the twelvemonth. 

To fry, — Clean, skin, and dry them in a cloth ; fasten their 
tails in their mouths ; brush them over with egg, and cover 
them with fine bread-crumbs mixed with a little flour ; fry 
them a light-brown, and serve them with good melted butter. 
For invalids they are sometimes plainly boiled with parsley 
and butter. 

Or : — Fillet 5 whitings, cut each fillet in half, flour them, 
egg and crumb them very carefully ; fry them with a little 
fresh butter, dish them up, and put a good oyster-sauce in the 
centre of them. This is a most artistic mode of serving 
whiting. 

GURNARDS, OR GURNETS, 

263. — Consist of 4 or 5 different kinds, of which the Piper 
IS timt distinguished by fishmongers as the best, though, to 



H^AT.

the {klHic, the whole species are known under the name uf 
- Giff""^^-" Their flesh is white, enteeding-ly firm, and shells 
ouf inta snowy Sakes of a remarkably agreeable flavour ; they 
]»iy also be kept, without sait, for seveml days in very hot 
leather : yet they are little known in the London market. 

From 3 to 4 lbs. is a good average weiglit, but the head 
is nearly as large aa the rest of the body, which tapera from 
the shoulder very slenderly to the tail. Their freshness may 
be tested in the same manner as cod. 

To boil. — Plain boil in salt and water over a gpntle fire i 
serve wit h plain butter or crab-sauce. 

To fry. — Skin the fish, cut off the head, tail, and fins, and 
fry the fillets in hot boiling oil or lard : drain upon a uolan- 
der, or a folded napkin. They may be eaten with plain butter, 
seasoned to the palate, but crab-sauce is considered the best. 

To bahe.- — Clean, scale, and take out their inaidea ; then cut 
off their heads ; rub a deep dish with butter, take some parsley, 
chives, and aweet herbs, mince them fine, season with pepper 
Sod salt ; put a layer of the mi.iture at the bottom of the dish, 
h then put in the fbh, and cover them with tlie same seasooing ; 
pnt some small pieces of butter on the fish, and let it melt be- 
fore the fire : lastly, cover them witli bread-crumbs grated 
verv fine, and put them in tlie oven. The .sauce to bo made 
IS follows : — Take mushrooms, truffles, chives, and parsley ; 
dired them fine, season with pepper and salt ; moisten it with 
iome fresh broth, and let it simmer over a gentle fire till the 
heHM are sufficiently done ; thicken it with a piece of butter 
kneaded in flour, and when the fish is baked of a fine brown 
pour the sauce into -h. dish and lay the giimet round it. 

MULLET. 
254. — There are 2 sorts of mullet, the red and thegrrej/; the 
former bred in the sea, and the latter in fresh water ; both of 
^mall size, and coming into season during the heat of summer. 
The red mullet is, however, preferred, both forthe delicacy of 
its flesh and the peculiar flavour of its liver, in consequence of 
which it is never gutted ; from which rimilarity in point of 
diesdng and estimation of the trail, it has got the name of 
f sea- woodcock." Being only found on our southern coasts, 
and in hot weather, as well as requiring to be eaten quite 
fresh, they are scarce and dear in the London market The 



242 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. K^hap. XIV. 

— 1—\ 1 - - 1 

Jersey mullet is the best, often growing to the wei^t of 2 
to 3 lbs. 

To broil. — ^The red mullet is never boiled, and, although some- 
times baked and fried, the best and most usual mode of dressii^ 
them is to broil them h la Maintenon ; take out the gills ana 
wipe them with a dry cloth from the head to the tail ; flour 
them ; take a half-sheet of letter-paper, butter it well, season 
it with pepper and salt, rub a little butter over the mullet and 
season it ; envelop it in the paper, fasten the ends securely ; 
broil for 20 minutes ; serve in the paper. They are served 
without any other sauce than plain melted butter, to preserve 
the haiU-gout of the liver, although that cannot be easily done 
without aJso retaining the other parts of the gut. 

To fry MuUeU-^An excellent plan is that of drawing the 
whole gut, and boiling the liver separately in such a small 
quantity of water as would be required for the making of the 
melted butter, '^ so that, should the livers boil to pieces in the 
ph)cess of dressing, you still retain all their valuable qualities." 
Mullets may in tins manner be dressed with sweet herbs, bread- 
crumbs, and egg, and fried. 

To hake, — Only cut out the gills, without meddling with 
the liver and trail ; bake them for about i an hour in a mode- 
rately heated oven ; season them well, and cover them with 
chopped mushrooms, shalots, chives, or truffles, together with 
parsley and sweet herbs of any sort ; put them into a dish of 
brown gravy, with a glass or two of either white or red wine, 
basting them frequently, and, when done, serving them with a 
squeeze of lemon. In this way they are peculiarly fine. 

To stew, — ^Put the mullet (say 3) into a shallow stewpan, 
with a large wineglass of sherry and as much broth, with an 
onion, carrot, and turnip sliced, 2 bay-leaves, a blade of mace, 
a little parsley and thyme, 2 slices of lemon, and a little sea- 
soning ; let them stew gently for 20 minutes ; dish them up ; 
strain the sauce; thicken it with flour and butter; pour it 
over the fish quite hot. 

SEA-BREAM 

266. — Are generally thought to be bred both in the sea and 
in fresh water, although they are of difierent species. The sea- 
bream, although somewhat larger than the red mullet, yet so 
much ii6»embles it in appearance that it may be dressed in the 



Chaf. XIV.] SALT-WATEB FISH. 243 



r, aad Is often passed otf as such by the fishmongeis. 
It is in tWMflMi at the same time as the muUec, and is plentiful 
ui the sKme eoasts, but is &r from being so good. 

CkadM are a smaller species of sea-bream, and may be dressed 
in precosdy the same way. 

MACKEREL 

256. — ^Aie soweU known, and in such general use as an es- 
teemed fishy that any description is unnecessary. Their season 
IS the months of May, June, and July, after which time they 
niawii and lose condition ; but some have an after season, about 
October, when they recover their flesh and flavour. They are 
so tender that they keep worse than any other kind of fish, for 
which reason they are allowed to be hawked on the Sunday ; 
finr if not dressed within 48 hours after being caught they be- 
come putrid. Their freshness may be ascertained not only by 
the fflgns common to all fish, of Adness in the eye and glossi- 
ness of the skin, but also by the appearance of the bars on the 
back, which slM>uld be distinctly marked black, those of the 
male being nearly straight, whilst those of the female are 
waving ; an observation worth attending to, as the flesh of the 
male is better than that of the female. Their condition should 
also be looked to, for, if the body be not full and deep from the 
shoulder downTi-ards, it is a proof that the fish has been dis^eased, 
or lost its roe as " shotten mackerel," which is always ill- 
tasted. They are delicate, though not rich in flavour. 

They may be dressed in >-arious ways, but plainly boiled is 
the most usual, and considered by many good judges as the 
best mode of preserving their flavour. 

To boil Mackerel, — They should be carefully cleaneii both 
inside and out ; then washed in >'inegar and water, and left to 
hang a little to dry before being put into the fish-kettle. A 
handful of salt should be put into the \i'ater, which sliould be 
at first cold, and only allowed to boil gently from 15 to 20 
minxit^, though some prefer having the water boiling hot. 
The fish should be watched about that time, as " when the eye 
starts and the tail splits they are done, and should be imme- 
diately taken up ; if left in the water they Tiill break." 

The most customary sauce is that of femiel, which has partly 
superseded the gooseberry, but parsley and butter is still in use. 

Or : — Mackerel may be boiled in a marinade made as 
follows : — Take, with some weak broth, 2 tablespoonfuls of 

a 2 



244 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XR^ 

vinegar, a bundle of sweet herbs, a few small onions, or a large 
one stuck with a clove, pepper, and salt ; boil it together for 
an hour ; then boil the fish in this gravy : take them out when 
ready, strain the liquor, and thicken it ; make it green with 
chopped parsley and fennel ; add a teaspoonful of any kind of 
fish-sauce, and send it to table. 

To sotise. — If kept until cold, to be eaten on the following 
day, they should be soused in equal proportions of vinegar and 
water sufficient to cover them, and containing some whole black 
pepper, mace, and a few bay-leaves. 

Or : — Clean, bone, and cut the fish into fillets, and season 
them well. To 6 large mackerel put an ounce of ground 
pepper in equal parts of white and red, 4 cloves, a saltspoonful 
of allspice, 3 or 4 blades of mace pounded, and a tablespoonful 
of salt. Rub the mixture well in, scoring the fish in order 
that it may be thoroughly spread. Fry them in oil till they 
are brown ; when cold, put them into a stone jar, and cover 
them with vinegar. 

To broil, — Split them down the back, rub the inside with a 
little vinegar sprinkled with pepper and salt, flour them, broil 
on a quick fire, and serve them up with melted butter, parsley, 
fennel, or lemon-sauce. Or, if intended for breakfast, send 
up the fish plainly broiled without condiments or sauce, and 
merely rubbed, when done, with a bit of butter. 

To fry, — They should be cut open, and prepared for dress- 
ing and serving up in the same manner as for broiling ; but it 
is as well to have the back-bone taken out, and the fish pow- 
dered with biscuit-dust and finely-minced herbs, as if intended 
for fillets ; then put into the frying-pan, with plenty of boiling 
oil, lard, or beef dripping. 

For baking, the spinal or back-bone may be taken out, and 
the fish stuff©! with forcemeat, or in the same manner as gur- 
net, but without taking off the head. Pepper the inside well, 
lay butter between, flour and butter the outside, roast \n a 
Dutch oven, and serve them up with lemon-juice squeezed over 
them, and a thick sauce of chopped fennel, parsley, and butter. 

To stew, — Split, bone, and cut the fish iu quarters, and broil 
them until they are nearly half done : then put them aside ; 
take a pint of good gravy, with a little chopped fennel, pars- 
ley, and shalot, a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, a glass of 
ketchup, and a piece of butter rolled in flour; stir this over

rtiw fire until it is of a pruper thickness ; season it with cayenne 
pepper and salt, then put in the fish ; stew all very gently 
until it is done, and add a tablespoonful of thickening and a 
g]ass of port wine the last thing. 
FitleU of Mackerel. — Bone one or more mackerel ; take the 
fiah off in fillets lengthwise, turning them round. Chop fennel 
and paisley, and put it in a stewpau trith well-reasoned veal 
gravy, or some fish-brotli if on maigre day ; lay in the fish, 
aod let it stew 10 minutes. Then take up the fillets, dish 
them, and thicken the sauce, adding- to it the juice of a lemon ; 

I TOUT it round the fish, and serve up with & garnish of pickles. 
Miaekerel a la maitre d'hoUl. — Split 3 mackerel, cut off the 
beacb and tails, and lake out the bone. Broil them nicely a 
fine brown. Boil a dozen small silver onions ; scald a young 
cucumber, a bunch of parsley, and a bunch of fennel ; chop 
ttie 2 latter, and cut tlie cucumber into dice. Season the 
whole, and put them into a small saucei>an with a piece of 
butter ; when the butter is melted, lay the vegetables on the 
fish, and squeeze the juice of 2 lemons over them. 
The soft roes are sometimes parboiled in a little vinegar and 
water and salt, being afterwards replaced in the boiled fish, as 
it requires less boiling (han the roe; but this is very seldom 
done, and then only for the purpose of frying them as a gar- 
lOBh for the boiled fish ; but they form a very nice dish, if 
there be a sufficient number, when dressed, cut into dice, 
thrown into a little white sauce, and patties filled with them. 

HERRINGS.— E. S. 

257. — This fish is in season from some time in May to the 
«id of October. If good, their gills are of a fine red, and 
the eyes bright, as b likewise the whole fish, which must be 
itiff and firm : their firmness, however, may be preserved, and 
the oiliness prevented, by sprinkling salt upon them, if required 
lo be kept more than a day. 

Fresh herrings are KSUally broiled over a good, but not a 
fierce cinder fire, and will be improved in delicacy if steeped 
in milk for a couple of hours before being dressed, they beii^ 
I«operly gutted, wiped dry, floured, and put upon a hot grid- 
iron ; they must, however, be narrowly watched by the cook ; 
they will be done enough in a few minutes. The beads and 
, tails are sometimes cut off as a point oS neatness, but imma- 



246 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIY. 

terial as regards the cookery; they should be served quite 
hot, with plain melted butter, and are usually eaten with 
mustard. 

'J^ofry. — Scale and prepare the herrings as above, but take 
out the soft roes and fry them separately, of a light brown, to 
form a garnish, and the whole well drained from the iaX in 
which £ey have been dressed. 

Notwithstanding the prejudice against the union of two 
such strongly flavoured viands, onions are frequently fried 
along with frosh herrings, the onions being shred finely and 
put under the fish, or, when peeled, the layers are separately 
unrolled, and placed over and around them. An excellent 
and very economical dish is also made by frying them with 
sliced, or baking them with whole-boiled potatoes. 

To bake. — ^Wash and drain without wiping them; season 
with allspice in fine powder, salt, and a few whole cloves ; lay 
them in a pan with plenty of black pepper, an onion, and a 
few bay-leaves. Add vinegar and small-beer in equal quan- 
tities, enough to cover them. Put paper over the pan, and 
bake for a couple of hours in a slow oven. If you like, throw 
saltpetre over them the night before, to make them look red. 
Gut, but do not op&i them. 

Herrings are very seldom boiled, but when that is done 
they should be served with sometldng more savoury than 
melted butter. In France, capers are commonly added, and 
tomata sauce is not unusual. 

To smoke. — Clean, and lay them in salt with a little salt- 
petre 1 night ; then hang them on sticks through the eyes, in 
a row. Have ready an old cask, in which put some sawdust, 
and in the midst of it a heater red-hot ; fix the sticks over the 
smoke, and let them remain 24 hours. Or, if you have a 
kitch^i in which wood is burnt, liang the herrings in strings 
across the chimney. 

To pot. — ^Take some of the above, or a dozen of recently 
cured bloaters ; soak them for a short time in scalding water, 
and strip off the skins ; cut off the heads and tails, take out 
the bones, cut the fish into pieces, and put them into a stewpan 
with a good lump of fresh butter, a little mace and either 
cayenne or white pepper. Set this on a slow fire to sim- 
mer until quite tender, or for some hours in a moderately 
heated oven ; then pound the Yrbole in a mortar, make it into

258. — Choose those that are large and moist ; cul them 
open and pour some boiling' ^mall'beer over them to n)ak -i an 
hour ; drain them dry, 'and make them just hot through before 
the fire ; then mb some cold butler over them, and wrve. 
Instead of butler, a little salad oil will add to the richness ; 
but it must be dropped on while before the fire, and in the 
smallest quantity. A very usual mode is, however, Io split 
them open without any soaking, and hang them separately oa 
tbe hooks of a cheese-toaster, by which means the soft roe wUl 
be browned. Some of them will have hard roes, in which 
case the belly should be carefully opened, and a little butter 
inserted between the lobes, but again close up the belly to 
more readily melt the butter. The " Yarmouth bloaters," 
whether arising from any improvement in their quality during 
their passage to London, or from the mode of curing them, are 
cimsidered the best. 

PILCHARDS, 

259. — Though more oily than herriugs, yet resemble them 
both in taste and appearance: they also come into season 
about the same time, and may be dressed, smoked, and potted 
in the same manner ; but, if not speedUy consumed, they 
become randd; and are, therefore, when fresh, seldom brought 
to London. They are caught on the coasts of Devon and 
Cornwall in large quantities, and, when salted, are chi^y ex- 
ported to the Mediterranean. 



248 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEBY. [Chap. XIY.

260. — ^May be smoked, dried^ and potted Kke herrings, but 
the most common mode of cooking is to fry, or rather to broil, 
them on a close-barred gridiron, as their oiliness, when fried, 
increases the rankness o?t*eir flavour. They ought not to be 
gutted with the knife, bvt, if the head be cut off, the gut may 
be drawn out at the satfie time. They come into the London 
market on Lord Maya's Day, and go out of season at the close 
of January. Most people eat them with salt alone, but a little 
lemon-juice, with a few grains of cayenne pepper, will be found 
an improvement. 

As they must be eaten quite hot, and are by many consi- 
dered very nic^, yet, as their odour in the parlour is disagree- 
able, it is not unusual among amateurs to have them at supper 
" as a sprat feast," at the kitchen fire. 



FRESH-WATEB FISH. 



CHArTEB XV. 



FEESH-WATKE FISH. 

261. — Fresh-water Fish are equally nutritious with those of 
the sea ; they are much lighter aa food, and therefore easier of 
digestion ; they are, however, more watery, and it is requisite 
to use salt, in order to extract the watery particles. Every 
!«rt of fresh-water fish ought, therefore, as soon as killed and 
cleaned, to have salt well rubbed inside and outside, and should 
be allowed so to remain for some time before it is cooked, 
when it should be wfll washed out with pure spring water, 
and wiped thoroughly dry with a clean cloth. 

If bred in ponds, it of^eu acquires a muddy smell and 
taste ; to take off wliich, soaking in strong salt and water, or, 
if of a size to bear it, scalding in the same, will liave the 
proper effect. 

SALMOlf 

262.^ — Has ever been looked upon as the moat pre-eminent of 
all fresh-water, and indeed, by some, of every species of fish ; 
but those who have lived in the neighbourhood of salmon 
fisheries can alone have tasted this monarch of the floods in 
jull perfection. It should be dressed before it has lost a tide. 
Families who purchase a whole salmon, and like it quite 
fresh, should parboil the portion not required for the day's 
consumption, and lay it aside in the liquor, boiling up the 
whole together when wanted ; by which means the curd will 
he set, and the fish be equally good on the following day. If 
new, and in season, the fiesh is of a fine red (the gills parti* 
cularly), the scales bright, and the whole fish stiff. When in 
greatest perfection, there is a whiteness between the flakes, 
^ich gives great firmness ; by keeping, this melts down, and 
the fish becomes more rich, but suffers somewhat in flavour. 
The Thames salmon bears the highest price, both in coase> 
quence of its generally acknowledged superiority, and its great 
scarcity ; we have known \2t. a pound paid for it when in th^ 



250 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XV. 

height of the season : that caught in the Severn is next in 
goodness, and is even preferred by some ; but the Christchurch 
salmon is by many thought to be the best. The chief supply 
to the London market is from Scotland. The Dutch salmon 
is the largest that comes to market, and in the early season 
fetches a great price on account of its size, some of the fish 
weighing 40 11^. each. It requires dressing the day it is re- 
ceived from Holland, as it otherwise becomes very oily and 
soft. Those with small heads and thick in the neck are best, 
and the larger the fish the richer they are. 

The season in which salmon is the finest and most plentiful 
is from the middle of May to the close of September ; but, 
even in the same waters, there is often several months' differ- 
ence in their relative conditions; depending chiefly on the 
time of their leaving the salt water, and how far they are ad- 
vanced towards their spawning-time : when the rudiments of 
the spawn first appear, the fish is in the best condition, and 
deteriorates considerably in goodness as it advances. When 
out of condition it loses its silvery cast on the sides, which then 
acquire a copper-coloured tinge, and the upper part a dirty 
grey ; whilst in the male, or " kipper," the cheeks become 
marked with orange-coloured stripes, and the lower jaw grows 
out to a considerable size, forming in part a groove to the 
upper. When thus thoroughly out of season, the fish is no 
longer in a fit state to be eaten. 

263. — To boil Salmon, — Salmon is dressed in various ways, 
but chiefly boiled in large pieces of a few pounds' weight. 
The middle piece is considered, if not the richest, yet the most 
sightly ; then that adjoining the jowl ; the tail part, though 
nearly as good, being usually kept for steaks. It requires great 
attention, and the boiling must be checked more than once : 
a piece of 4 to 5 lbs. will take nearly an hour, but if double 
that weight will not require more than 20 minutes beyond that 
time, and if crimped, still less will be suflftcient : let it, how- 
ever, boil slowly, in the hardest water, on a strainer placed in 
a large fish-kettle, and be thoroughly done, for nothing is 
more disgusting than fish that is under-cooked ; skim it well, 
or the colour will be bad ; the moment it is ready, lift up the 
strainer and rest it across the kettle, that the fish may drain ; 
cover it with a thick cloth. 
Sacb 18 the English mode of boiling salmon ; but in Scot^ 
Jand two other methods are adopted wloich. merit notice : — 



Chap. XV.] FRESH-WATER FISH. 251 

Iflt. I%e Berwick receipt — ^^ The tail of the salmon is cut 
off. below the last fin, the fish is then cut up the back, keeping 
the bone on one ride, and divided into pieces of i lb. each, 
the blood being well washed out in cold water, but the scales 
not to be removed. A pickle is then made of salt and water 
strong enough to bear an egg, and when boiling the fish to be 
put in and boiled very quickly for 15 minutes." 

2nd. I%e Aberdeen FishermaaiCs receipt. — <^ When the water 
18 hot put salt into it and stir it well ; taste it ; when strong 
enough to force you to cast it from your mouth, it will do ; 
when the water boils, put in the fish ; when it boils again, 
give 20 minutes for a salmon, and 16 for a grilse. When cut 
in slices an inch thick, let them boil 10 minutes. Serve in a 
tureen of the liquor the fish was boiled in." 

The salmon which is only left to boil 20 minutes can, how- 
ever, be only salmon-peel ; which is a small species that never 
reaches to more than a few pounds in weight. It is, there- 
fore, conmionly boiled whole, and dressed in the form of the 
letter S, which is done by passing a large needle through the 
eyes of the fish, and tying the string under the jaw, to bend 
back the jowl; then running the needle through die thick 
part of the body, and tying it tight to the end of the tail : the 
eyes being sometimes taken out, and the cavities filled up with 
black truffles. 

The usual sauce is that of lobster or shrimp; and when 
those cannot be had, anchovy. The custom of sending up 
rich sauces is unknown in salmon countries ; a little lemon- 
pickle or white-wine vinegar being thought quite sufficient, 
added to melted butter. When in season, thinly sliced cucum- 
bers, with oil and vinegar, are also a customary accompani- 
ment, as well as scraped horseradish and parsley; but they 
sliould be put on a separate plate, and not served, as conunon 
cooks constantly do, as a garnish round the dish : nor should 
any species of vegetable be ever served except with salt-fish. 

To preserve the remains of cold salmon, save a part of the 
water in which the salmon has been boiled, mix it with half 
the quantity of vinegar, boil it up with whole pepper, and 
when cold pour it over the fish ; but do not keep it longer than 
2 or 3 days. 

To broiL — Cut slices an inch thick ; put them into buttered 
paper and place them upon the gridiron ; or the paper may be

To bake, — Scale it, and take out the bone £nom the part to 
be dressed, but fill up the cavity with forcemeat, and bind the 
piece with tape. Then flour it, rub it with yolk of egg, and 
put it into a deep baking-dish, covering it very thickly with 
orumbs of bread, chopped parsley, and sweet herbs, together 
with shrimps, if they can be got, and put into the covering a 
few small bits of firesh butter ; place it in a Dutch oven, or, 
if already boiled and thus re-dressed, heat it only before the 
fire until browned. 

In the west of England salmon are often roasted whole in 
a cradle-spit, and thus dressed are very delicious. A Dutch 
oven is better adapted to a small bit. The piece roasted 
should be cut from the middle or tail, the jowl being, on 
account of the bones and mucilage, more fitted for boiling. 
Flour the fish well, and baste it with butter, serving it up with 
a p;amish of lemon« It is most excellent when cold, and eaten 
with pepper and vin^;ar, being much richer than when 
boiled. It may be skinned, rubbed over with yolk of egg 
and bread-crumbs ; and this is a good way of dressing small 
pieces.

remains of that which b cold, pound and season it in the same 
mamier as for an omelet, but leaxdng out the eggs« and making 
it into a paste with thick melted butter. 

K undressed, take a large piece, scale and wipe, but do not 
wash it ; salt very well ; let it lie till the salt is melted and 
drained from it, then season it with beaten mace, cloves, and 
whole pepper : lay in a few bay-leaves, put it close into a pan, 



254 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XV. 

cover it over with butter, and bake it in a slow oven for 2 or 
3 hours ; when well done, drain it from the gravy, and take 
out the peppercorns, put it into the pots pressed closely down 
to keep it from the air, and, when cold, cover it with clarified 
butter. In this manner any firm fish may be potted ; and if 
the coral of a lobster, with a little of the fish, or some bruised 
shrimps, be added, they will much improve its flavour and 
appearance. 

To collar Salmon. — Split such a part of the fish as may 
be sufficient to make a handsome roll, wash and wipe it, and 
having mixed salt, white pepper, pounded mace, cloves, and 
Jamaica pepper, in quantity to season it very high, rub it well 
both inside and out. Then roll it tight and bandage it ; put 
as much water and -i- vinegar as will cover it, and stew it with 
bay-leaves. Cover close and simmer till done enough ; take 
off the scum, and again boil the liquor, but keep it when cold, 
as the collar may be preserved in it, and wiped dry when wanted. 
As an occasional dish for a slice at breakfast or luncheon, when 
eaten with lemon-juice or any acid sauce, it is very good, but 
not in such request as collared eel. 

To pickle Salmon. — The Newcastle method is — Put any 
<Uitity of salmon into an earthen jar, cover it with equal parts 
01 g^>*><^egar and water, add cayenne pepper and salt in 
proportions^ the fish, and bak© it in a moderate oven. This 
pickle will keep^ long tin^, with the addition of a little fresh 
vinegar ; and if mace or cloves W. added, with a few bay-leaves 
laid in the mouth of the jar, it will be found an improve- 
ment. Trout may be preserved the sam© way. Fish thus 
pickled, must not be washed previously, but rubbed with a 
dry cloth. 

Though in London always eaten cold, yet in Newcastle it 
is not imfrequently warmed up in its pickle-liquor. 

TROUT 

264. — Are by many people thought to be a small kind of 
salmon, but, though much resembling it in outward appearance 
and delicacy of taste, they are of a distinct species, only inha- 
biting rivulets of running water, and never bred, as the salmon 
is, in the sea. They are very small, seldom exceeding 2 to 3 
lbs., and more frequently not reaching more than i lb. in weight.

To toie.— TVliene there is an oven it is decidedly the b^ 
mode of dreswug all the larger sop of fresh-water tish, and 
also the simplest. Dry the fish, lay Jiem in a bakint^-dish, 
season with pepper and salt, and put a ittle butter on than ■ 
bake them according to the size ; add iht. juice that comes 
ftom the fish to some rather thick melted butte. 

To boiL — They should be wiped dry with a cow^ towel, 
rubbed from heed to tail, and boiled whole, putting ttit.^ \^^ 
cold water mised witli a small quantity of vinegar, into wuvj^ 
should be also put «>nie scraped horseradish ; let them boil 
gradually for about 20 to 30 minutes, accordiiig to size, and 
take care not to break the skin ; serve with plain melted 
batter. 

In WiiU Saiice. — Boil the fish gently in aa much water and 
light white wine, in equal quantities, as will only cover them. 
When done, keep them hoi nliile }'ou boil the liquor with a 
bit of butter and a little tlour. Meautime have reaiiy beaten 
2 e^s, « ith a spoonful of coUl w ali;r. and jH>ur tlieni and tlio 
Moce to and fro at a little distance above the stove till of due 
thickness, and serve the fish in it, adding a little salt. 

7m Green Sauce. — Beat in a mortar i an anchovy, a table- 
gpoonfiil of capers, 1 each of chivea and parsley, previously 
minced, a good lump of butter, and a dessertspoonful of flour. 
When the trout is ready, keep it hot while this mixture is 
boiled with the liquor, in which serve it. 

7b fry IVoid.— Scale, gut, and clean them ; take out the 
gills ; e^ and crumb them ; then fry in lard or oil until of a 
U^t brown. S^rve with anchovy-sauce and sliced lemon. 

In the Foreign Mode.—Cover the bottom of a small oval 
paper form with a few very thin slices of fat bacon ; cut down 
the back some nicely-washed small trout, and, having removed 
the bones, lay the fish open, flat upon the bacon ; sprinkle 
with chopped parsley, pepper, salt, a little mace, and 2 clovee 
finely poimded. Bake i an hour in a quick oven, and etne 
in papa. 



S56 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XT. 

Or : — Take off the paper, leave out the bacon, and serve 
in a thick white fricassee-sauce, made of good veal broth and 
white wine, with capers. 

Trout is also good in salad-sauce, as thus : — ^Fry 2 or 3 
middling-sized trout, lay them in a paper to remove the fet, 
and, when cold, serve in salad-«auce, with miuoed chervil and 
chives. 

THE PARR, CFARR, AND OR A YLTNG. 

265. The Parr i^ Estill smaller species of trout, and yet 

more delicious in ^vour. It is in high season during the 
months of July «*^<^ August, and its freshness may be tested 
in the same n^^^^er as trout. They are very seldom boiled, 
but when --fried in the same method as trout, they form an ex- 
tremeV ^®® side-dish, which may be served witiiout any im- 
pjtTp^^ty ^ ^^ entremet in the second course. 

The Charr, though generally looked upon as a sort of trout, 
is yet of a distinct species ; and though known in other parts 
of Europe, is in this country confined to a few of our lakes 
in Cumberland and the neighbouring counties. It is muclz 
larger than the parr, being commonly from 9 to 12 inches in 
length, while the parr is of little more than half that size. N'ot- 
withstanding some peculiarity of taste, it is however equally 
delicate, and is now brought to London in a fresh state. The 
best way of dressing it is baking, but it is chiefly brought to 
table in a potted state, and is sold at a high price, the dealers 
imitating it with every kind of small trout. The best season 
for them is from July to October, but they continue in good 
order until their time of spawning, in the months of November 
and December. 

The Grayling, like charr, is only to be found in a few coun- 
ties, which is to be regretted, as, being a fine fish, it forms a 
good-sized dish for the head of the table, often arriving to the 
weight of 3 to 5 lbs., though 2 to 3 lbs. is more common. It 
has also this advantage for those who have an abundant supply 
of all these sorts of fish, that it comes into season when the 
trout is going out. 

All the above fish may be dressed in the same manner, and 

their freshness tested in the same way, as trout. Perhaps, when 

very small, as nice a way as any is to split them at the back, 

and oil them over without any further trouble than seasoning 

them with a Utile pepper and salt, and putting them a few

In Bus^, and some parts of GennasT. where sturgeon is 
common, the usual mode of dressii^ b to stew it in wine ; for 
it is a coarse »ort of fi^, eometrhat resembling dark-colDured 
veal, and requiring strong high-flavoured sauce. 

Sturgeon a la StuK. — IVhen the sturgeon is cleaned, 
lay it for several hours in salt and water ; take it out an hour 
before it is wanted, rub it well with vinegar, and poitr a little 
over il : then pul it into a fi.>^h-S;ett!e, cover it ivilh IxHling 
water, 1 oz. of bay-salt, 2 large onions, and a bunch of sweet 
herbs. Stew it in common wine, or strong ale, until the bones 
will eeparate ea-sily ; then take it up, remove the skin, flour 
it, and place it to brown before the fire, basting the fish well 
with butter. Serve up with a rich sauce made of beef-giavy 
and red wine, highly seasoned with spice, and a garnish of 
[riclcles. 

Id England they are usually cut into slices an inch thick, 
and fried ; then pour off the &t, flour the pan, and pour boil- 
tng water into it ; put the fish into a stewpan with this gravy, 
an onion and sweet herbs, pepper and salt ; let it stew until 
quite tender ; strain the sauce, squeeze the juice of a lemon 
into it, and serve it up. Sturgeon may be baked or boiled, but 
the alwve way of dressing is one of the beat ; and the collops 
are better than those of either ling or halibut. 

Caviar is the roe of (he sturgeon. When eaten fresh it much 
resembles tbe flavour of oysters ; and when accompanied with 
lemon-juice and pepper, without any kind of dressing, is usually 
BOTved as a whet to the appetite previous to the soup. What 



258 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XY. 

we get in this country is, however, always either dried into 
cakes or potted and salted. 

To stew Sturgeon, — Cut the fish in slices H inch thick, dip 
them in vinegar, dry them well, flour, and broil the slices ; 
then flour and lay them in a stewpan with some good broth, 
and let them stew gently until perfectly tender ; thicken the 
gravy with butter or cream, add a spoonful of Harvey's sauce, 
i a glass of wine, and serve it up with capers strewed over the 
top, and garnished with slices of lemon. 

To rodst. — Put a good-sized piece in a large cradle-spit 
(5 or 6 lbs. will make a handsome dish for the head of the 
table) ; stuff it with forcemeat ; keep it at the fire for 2 or 3 
hours, but remove the skin ; cover it with crumbs of bread, 
and brown it with the salamander ; baste it constantly with 
butter, and serve with a good brown g^vy, an anchovy, a 
squeeze of Seville orange or lemon, and a glass of sherry boiled 
up, and poured into the dish. 

Sturgeon Cutlets, — Cut in slices i inch thick ; dry, flour, 
and egg them; dip them in crumbs, seasoned with pepper, 
salt, parsley, and thyme; fry them, and serve with Indian 
pickle, tomata, or piquant sauce. 

CARP AND TENCH 

267. — ^Are rather pond than river fish ; and although ever 
accompanied and considered of the same species, are yet widely 
different in both size and flavour — the carp arriving, in a long 
course of years, to more than 50 lbs., while the tench seldom 
reaches so much as a tithe of that weight. The flavour of 
carp also depends wholly on the way it which it is dressed, 
while the tench possesses naturally a very delicious degree of 
richness. There is also this rather extraordinary difference, 
that, while carp are preyed upon by pike and perch, the tench 
is never attacked by either, owing, as it is supposed, to a slimy 
substance in the skin. Being of similar habits, they both 
spawn in June, soon after which they recover, and are again 
in good order in the month of August. They however bury 
themselves in the mud during the period of winter ; and from 
thus living in slime, the flesh often contracts a disagreeable 
muddy flavour, which cannot be removed until the fish is kept 
alive for some days in pure water ; and this can only be done 
b^ j>ersons who have ponds of their own in which to change 



Chap. XV.] FRESH-WATER FISH. 259 

theoi. The odour will not exist long after the breaking up of 
winter; but if then not quite free from it, the best way is to 
insert a large piece of bread into the bellj of the fish while 
being dressed, and removing it when quite done. 

The head of the fish is looked upon as the best part, and 
next to that is the back ; but the merits of the carp must ever 
depend more <m the goodness of the sauce than the richness of 
iti flesh. 

nke Crucian Carp is a diminutive species, which is some- 
times passed off as being of the genuine sort, though utterly 
worthleas. 

7b boil Carp or Tench. — Clean and scale your fish, and take 
out the gplls, as they are always muddy ; raise the back-bone, 
and rub in some salt ; then let it lie in some strong salted 
spring water for a couple of hours, after which wash it out in 
clear spring water, then put it into boiling water with a good 
handful of salt ; and, if it be of a moderate size, let it boil from 
15 to 20 minutes with the milt or roe. Gramish with paisley 
and slices of lemon, and serve up melted butter with fish- 
saoces for table. 

Carp boiled " au bleu" — Draw the carp and clean it well, 
but do not scale it. Split it in half; then cut it in pieces 
large enough for serving up ; lay them on a dish with the scales 
undermost, and the milt at top, and pour over each some 
scalding vin^ar ; add only water enough to just cover the fish, 
and put into it 2 or 3 onions with cloves, some scraped horse- 
radish, whole pepper, allspice, and a good handiiill of salt. 
When the water boils, lay the pieces in it, and let it boil for 
i an hour, taking care to skim it well whilst boiling. 

To stew Carp. — Clean the fish thoroughly, and dry it well 
on a cloth, dredge it with flour, and fry it of a light colour ; 
then put it into a stewpan, with equal parts of wine and water, 
a tablespoouful of lemon-pickle, the same of walnut-ketchup, a 
teaspoonful of mushroom-powder, and a little cayenne pepper ; 
add a large onion stuck with cloves, and a stick of horse 
radish. Cover the pan closely to keep in the steam, and let 
the contents stew over a stove very gently until the gravy is 
reduced to a quantity sufiicient only to cover the fish ; di«i 
take it up, strain the gra^y, thicken it, and add it to the fish. 

In cleansing your carp, wash out the blood with a little 
vinegar, which save ; then split and cut the fish into pieces, 

8 2 



260 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XV. 

which fry with the roe in the stewpan, until nicely brown ; 
then add the vinegar and blood, 2 or 3 large onions stuck with 
cloves, some whole pepper, cinnamon, allspice, salt, lemon- 
peel, and a slice or two of lemon ; close the lid, and let the con- 
tents stew gradually, taking care to skim it well. When done, 
take out some of the liquor, and season with eschalot and chili 
vinegar, soy, anchovies, and ketchup thickened with a little 
flour ; add i pint of port wine, and serve it up for table ; 
garnish with sippets. 

Or : — Cut off the head, tail, and fins ; season the carp with 
salt, pepper, and powdered mace, both inside and out ; rub 
the seasoning on very well, and let the pieces lie in it an hour ; 
then put them into a stewpan with a little parsley chopped fine, 
a whole onion, a little sweet marjoram, a teacupful of thick 
cream or very rich milk, and a lump of butter rolled in flour. 
Pour in sufiicient water to cover the carp, and let it stew i an 
hour. 

If to the above be added i pint of white wine in which 
the yolks of a couple of eggs have been beaten up with a lump 
of sugar of the size of about a walnut, and a grating of nut- 
m^, it will greatly improve the sauce. 

To stew Tench, — Scale and clean ; take care of the roe, &c. ; 
lay the fish in a stewpan with a rich beef-gravy, an onion stuck 
with cloves, some mace and allspice, with a dessertspoonful of 
Jamaica pepper ; simmer, closely covered ; when nearly done, 
add 2 anchovies chopped fine, a dessertspoonful of made mus- 
tard, some walnut-ketchup, and as much curry-powder as will 
add a high flavour to the fish ; thicken the sauce with flour, if 
that be not sufliciently done with the curry-powder, and reduce 
it with a couple of glasses of good port wine. Let the gravy 
boil a few minutes, then add a spoonful of soy. Serve with 
sippets of fried bread, the roe fried, and a good deal of horse- 
radish and lemon. 

To fry Carp and Tench, — You may safely employ precisely 
the same methods as those used for dressing trout; or cut 
fillets from them, which wrap in buttered paper with all sorts 
of pot-herbs, minced shalot, chives, and mushroom, and put 
these envelopes upon the gridiron. The papers may either 
be taken off, and the contents made into one, and served with 
caper-sauce, or left on ; and if made small enough for a single 
persoDy each may be helped separately, and the fillet eaten with

of lemon. The tench is better in this way than the

boiled in Tinegar; then cat into snail pieces, seasoned with 
spioOy and sade np into cakes with biead-cnnnbs and minced 
leaaoB-ped. Ther may be either pot into scallop-shdk and 
hentod befiiie the fire, or baked in a IXitch oven. 

A la Ckajmbard. — ^Let a whole carp be stewed in the usual 
waj along' with tiie roe of tiie carp: "when done, skin the 
Ml, and laid it with bits of bacon, patting the fish belbre the 
fire, or in the oven, to brown ; but take out die roe, and make 
it into balls, to be fried with fivrcemeat. Then make any 
sanee yon choose, other white or brown, and seasoned to your 
pleasore, and serve it under die carp. 

THE FRESH-WATER BREAM 

S68. — Is often firand in the same waters as die carp, and 
commonly attains die size of 2 to 3 lbs. weight. Their highest 
condition is from Midsummer to Michaefanas, and they may be 
dressed in the same manner as carp, but are not so good. 

PIKE, 

269. — Or Jack^ as country people call it, is a raTenous fish 
which preys upon the smaller species which inhabit our streams, 
and lives to a great age, acquiring so large a size as to be 
sometimes found of the weight of 40 to 50 lbs. They are, 
however, more esteemed when not more than about 8 or 10. 
They spawn in March or April, and are in the best condition 
frtMn I^Iichaelmas to February. 

Pike, although a dry fish, and therefore much indebted to 
stuffing and sauce, is yet better flavoured than carp, and is 
much improved by rubbing a little salt down the back-bone 
the day before using. In cleaning it, the roe should be care- 
fully extracted, as it is a strong purgative ; and the fish should 
be left for an hour or two in vinegar before being dressed. 

To boil Pike, — Scale it, and stuff it through the gills ; or 
open as near the throat as you can, and, after well cleaning, 
stuff it with the following : — Grated bread, herbs, anchovies, 
oysters, suet, salt, pepper, mace, i pint of cream, 4 yolks of 
eggs ; mix all over the fire till it thickens, then put it (as a 
pi^ding) into the fish, and sew it up. Boil it^ «xid ^*^<^ \3^^

fish \» ready take a large cup of rich broth, with a dessert- 
gpoonfbl of essence of anchovy, the same of soy, and a squeeze 
of lemon, some batter rolled in flour, and, boiling it up, pour 
it into the dish. 

Or : — Having salted it for a day or two, boil it for 25 or 
30 minutes, and serve it with a sauce made of good bouillon, 
fried onions, parsley and allspice, thickened with mustard, 
or with egg-sauce and parsnips. 

Jf stewed J the above matenals may be put into good gravy 
with a glass or two of wine. Small jack also eats well cut into 
fillets and fried, or cut in pieces and stewed as eels. 

To bake. — ^Take a large fish, stuff it with forcemeat, skewer 
it round, flour, and lay it on an earthen dish, with pieces of 
butter on the top, and a sprinkling of salt ; send it to the oven. 
A large pie will take an hour in baking. When removed 
from the oven, the dish will be found full of gravy. Put to a 
sufficient portion for the sauce 2 anchovies finely chopped, a 
little grated lemon-peel, a glass of wine. Beading sauce, or 
lemon-pickle, and make it as thick as cream with flour and 
butter, adding capers if desirable. 

A pike of 4 Ib^., cut in slices, and crimped like codfish, 
and then fried, is as good eating as any fr^h-water fish that 
comes to table. 

PERCH 

270. — Are in season fix)m the latter end of May till the be- 
ginning of February, during which time their condition may 
be ascertained not only by the rosy freshness of their gills, 
but also by the glowing appearance of the golden tinge upon 
their back and silvery white upon the belly. They are seldom 
found in our markets of more than 1 lb. in weight. They may 
be dressed in the various ways employed for trout, having first 
cut off the powerful spines with which the back is armed, and 
carefully scraping off the scales. The most usual, however, is 
the Dutch mode of stewing them, called — 

WATER ZOUTCHEE, 

271. — ^Which maybe made of carp, tench, perch, and floun- 
ders ; but the 2 latter are much the most usual. In Holland 
they are almost invariably boiled simply in a small quantity of 
water, along with a large handful of parsley, and served up in 
a tureen Blled with the water in wbicb. the fish has been boiled.

It is ah?ays eaten with bread and butter, the bread being made 
of rye, and not, as in London " brown bread," of wheaten bran. 

Water iSwcAe.-— Take a few parsley-roots, cut them in strips 
sa for soup Julienne, about an inch long and about a ststeenth 
square ; put these to boil in a little »alt and water ; wlien done 
throw in a handful of small sprigs of parsley ; wheu that boils 
put iu the fish ; whea done serve in a deep dish, putting sufii- 
cieot liquor, and the root^ and tlie parsley. 

The mode employed at the Cape of Good Hope is to make 
a fine onion-sauce ; add to it a bunch of parsley cut in pieces, 
and the same of sorrel, with pepper and salt ; put iu the 6sh, 
and boil the whole together. 

SHAD AND BAHBEL 
272. — Are both common to the Thames, but are so indif- 
ferent in quality that they seldom appear at any gooil table ; 
for although, if well stewed, they may be made good dishes, 
yet that can only be done by the excellence of the sauce, and 
the fish is not worth the expense of making it. The latter, 
indeed, though fishcil for by anglers for the sake of anmse- 
meat, is very generally thrown away when caught, and its roe 
is considered to be poisonous. The former may, however, be 
broiled, after being well basted in oil, peppered and salted, and 
eaten either with oil and vinegar or with so^^e]^5auce. 

EELS. 

273. — There is a greater difference in the goodness of eels 
than of any other fresh-water fish. The true silver eel is 
caught in the Thames ; and those caught in the Colne, the 
Wandle, or any of the Banning streams having a gravelly 
bottom, are always good. The Dutch eels sold at Billingsgate 
are very bad ; and those in ponds have usually a strong muddy 
flavour. 

They are in season the whole year round, excepting the 
months of April and May, and when in high condition have a 
br^ht, glossy appearaace on the back, and a brilliant white 
on the belly, from which they have acquired the name of "sil- 
ver eels ;" though another sort, called the " grig," is nearly as 
good. The silver eels grow to a large size, and the lai^er 
they are the better they are thought to be, but a fish of 2 to 
3 lbs. weight must be considered very fine. Unleaa fidl^ \ Hi. 



264 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEBY. [Chap. XV. 

in weight they are hardly worth purchasiiigy except for the 
purpose of enriching fish-stews or making anall eel-patties. 

Preparatory to most modes of dressing, they should be well 
cleaned, gntted, and skinned ; the heads and tails cat off, and 
the rest of the fish cat into short pieces of 3 to 4 inches in 
length, and left for an hoar or two in salt water.^ 

To bail Eeli. — ^They should be of a good size, prepared as 
above, dried, floured, and boiled in salt and water, with a 
good deal of paisley, for about i an hour, or until tender ; then 
served with parsley and butter, of which a portion may be 
thrown over them^ and they may be garnished with scraped 
horseradish. 

Or : — ^If, in lieu of parsley^ the rind of a lemon, pared very 
thin, be boiled with the eel, and this booed and left cold, then 
covered with transparent calf s-foot jelly, it will form an ele- 
gant little supper-dish. 

To fry, — Instead of being cut into pieces, they may be left 
whole, and trussed in a circular form, with their tail thrust 
through the jaws ; but great care should be taken in gutting 
them. They should be rolled in yolk of eggs and bread- 
crumbs, or a thick coating of sweet herbs, and fried a pale 
brown. They may be served with any savoury or acid sauce 
that may be preferred. 

To broil, — ^The same process may be adopted by merely 
changing the frying-pan for the gridiron, and wrapping the 
eels in buttered paper; but, if thought proper, the bread- 
crumbs and herbs may be omitted, as well as the envelope of 
paper, and the eel merely brushed over with the yolk of egg. 
Turn them frequently, and take them up when quite brown. 

Some persons, indeed, prefer the skins to be kept on, as it 
retains the oily richness of the fish, which, when stripped of its 
skin, is deprived of some portion of its mellowness. The skin 
is, of course, not eaten ; but the fish itself is certainly rendered 
more delicious, and if taken with acid sauce, or the mere

without severing it from the body, when the fish will die almost instanta- 
neously " (PiscatOTf p. 38). — " To skin eels in the most easy manner, first 
cut through the skin all round, just below the gills, with a sharp knife, then 
stick either an iron skewer or the prong of a stout fork through the head 
above, and so holding on by tiiat part with your right hand, take a coarse 
towel in jour left hand, and grasping the fish tightly below where you have

Or: — Cut theeeb in pieces, hj than a little until they are 
a fine tnown ; let than remain until cold ; take an onion, a 
litde parsley, a leaf of sage chopped very finely ; put than in 
some gravy, with a dove, a blade of maoe, pepper and salt, a 
glass of port wine, and a little lennm-juice ; stndn the sance 
and thicken it witii batter and flour, adding a little anchovy 
essence and ketchup ; stew the eeb until they are tender. 

Or: — ^Take a pint each of port wine and beef-gravy or 
gravy-soup, with a few fried onions sliced and i lb. of butter, 
and let the eels stew in it for i an hour, carefully stirring, and 
having previously seasoned it ^lith spice, soy, and ketchup. 

Sels stewed in the French way. — Skin the eels, and skewer 
them round ; put them into an earthen pan with all sorts of 
roots cut small, a few peppercorns, cloves, and a little salt, 
about a pint of vinegar and ketchup, with as much broth : bake 
them 1 hour in the oven uncovered with pie-crust, and in the 
mean while thicken the stock with some good cream flavoured 
with a grate of nutmeg. The other modes are more in the dif- 
ference of sauce than the methods of dressing, though put 
under various names. > 

Eels spitchcocked. — Split the eels down the back, but do 
not skin diem ; wash, dry, and flour them ; spread on the inside 
a little butter, then e^ them, and strew rather thickly parsley> 
thyme, marjoram, and lemon-peel, all finely chopped ; season 
with pepper, salt, a little cayenne, and a very little nutmeg ; 
dip them in bread-crumbs, cut them in pieces, and broil them 
of a light brown ; serve with melted butter. The proportions 
should be marjoram 1 part, lemon-peel 2, thyme 3, and parsley 
4 parts. 

To roast an Eel, — ^The mode directed by old Izaak Walton, 
as mentioned in his Life, is so quaint and characteristic, that we 



266 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XY. 

give it here : — " First wash him in water and salt ; then pull 
off his skin below his vent or navel ; having done that, take 
out his guts as clean as you can, but wash him not ; then give 
him 3 or 4 scotches with a knife, and then put into his belly, 
and into those scotches, sweet herbs, an anchovy, and a little 
nutmeg grated, or cut very small, and mixed with good butter 
and salt. Having done this, then pull his skin over him, all 
but his head, which you are to cut off, to the end you may tie 
his skin to the part where his head grew, and it must be so 
tied as to keep all his moisture within his skin ; and having 
done this, tie him with tape or packthread to a spit, and roast 
him leisurely, and baste him with salt and water till his skin 
breaks, and then with butter ; and having roasted him enough, 
let what was put into his belly and what he drips be his sauce.'^ 
To which we would add — 

Chop as small as possible 2 large spoonfuls of capers and 2 
unwashed anchovies : put them into a saucepan with i lb. of 
butter, 2 spoonfuls of water boiling hot, and 1 of caper-vine- 
gar : shake the pan over the fire until all be completely mixed, 
and serve it separately as sauce. 

LAMPREY, 

274. — Though but little known in London, are rather plenti- 
ful in the neighbourhood of Worcester, and thence frequently 
sent, as presents, to various parts of the kingdom. 

To stew Lamprey, — ^After cleaning the fish carefully, remove 
the cartik^e which runs down the back, and season with a 
small quantity of cloves, mace, nutmeg, pepper, and allspice ; 
put it into a small stewpot, with as much strong beef-gravy, 
and madeira or sherry, in equal quantities, as will cover it. 
Cover close : stew till tender, then take out the lamprey and 
keep it hot, while you boil up the liquor with 2 or 3 anchovies 
chopped, and some flour and butter ; strain the gravy through 
a sieve, and add lemon-juice and some made mustard. Serve 
with sippets of bread and horse-radish. When there is spawn 
it must be fried and put round. 

It will take twice as much stewing as an eel of the same 

size ; and if to be either fried or broiled, it ought to be first 

partially boiled. 

SMELTS, 

275, — Though not strictly ^^ fresh-water fish ^^ are caught in 
Ja,rge quantities in the estuaries and wero that discharge them-

selves ioto the Britkli Channel ; but tho^ found iu the Tliames 
and Medway are the best. They are in season from the 1st of 
November until the end nf May, after which time they are 
protected by law. They are a small fish ; if good, are of a 
fine silvery hue, are very firm, have a refreshing smell, like 
cucmubers newly cut, and are much used as a garnish to 
turbot and boiled cod ; but they are also excellent when eaten 
alone and simply fried in lanl or oil, without any other sauce 
than a squeeze of lemou, as any otlier addition destroys the 
delicacy of their flavour. They should be perfectly fresh, and 
this can be readily ascertained by the r»lness of their gills 
and the fulness of the eyes, which, if sunk, show that they 
are stale. 

They are always dressed whole ; and in gutting tliem tliey 
should be as litQe handled as possible, nor should they be 
washed, but merely wiped gently with a towel and dusted witli 
flour, then ^ged and crumbed. 

WHITE BAIT. 
276. — ^Have an iron frying-pan about 4 inches deep ; put into 
it lard sufRcient to cover it about 1^ inch. Lay a cloth on the 
dresser, spread over it a quart of flour ; ' take the white bait 
out of the water, and sprinkle it thiniy on the flour ; put the 
whole into a sieve, sift the flour from the white I>ait, whip them 
into the boiling lard ; when crisp take them out; sprinkle a 
little salt over them ; serve with brown bread and butter, 
cayenne, and lemon. 

ROACH, DACE, AND GUDGEON, 
277. — Are chosen by the same rules as other fish ; are taken 
in running streams ; come in about midsummer, and are to be 
had for 5 or 6 months. The roach is the lai^est, and is some- 
times I)aked for hours in a slow oven, with vinegar and water 
seasoned with mace and allspice, and covered with bay-leaves ; 
or stewed in layers with sliced onions, to improve its insipidity. 
Gudgeons, Uiough very small, are nicely flavoured, but are 
seldom used in any other manner than fried aa a garnish to 
boiled fish. All these small fry may be dressed in the same 
manner as smells.

SHELL-FISH. 

278. — Although crabs and lobsters may be seen at the 
fishmongers^ the whole year round, they are yet only in high 
season and plentiful from the month of April till the close 
of October. They should be always purchased alive, for 
many are found dead in the cobles in which they are brought 
from Norway, and are then boiled and sold under pretence of 
their having been just killed. 

If lobsters have not been long taken, the claws will have a 
strong motion when you put your finger on the eyes and press 
them. The heaviest, if of good size, are the best, but the 
largest are not the best. When you buy them ready boiled, 
try whether their tails are stiff, and pull up with a spring ; 
if otherwise, they are either watery or not fresh. The " cock- 
lobster ^^^ as the male is called, is known by the narrow back 
part of his tail, and the 2 uppermost fins within it are stiff and 
hard ; but those of the hen are soft, and the tail broader. 
The male, though generally smaller, has the highest flavour ; 
the flesh is firmer, and the colour, when boiled, is a deeper 
red ; but the female has that fine coral so highly prized by 
cooks for the improvement of their sauces, which appears with 
the rudiments of the spawn. 

To boil Lobsters. — Put them alive, with their claws tied 
together, into the water when boiling hot, and keep it so until 
the fish is done, which, if of a pound weight, will take about 
i of an hour, and if larger will require not quite the same pro- 
portion of time, for if boiled too long the meat will be stringy. 
Many people are shocked at the apparent cruelty of thus kill- 
ing them, but death takes place immediately, and life cannot 
be taken away without pain. 

When sent to table to be eaten cold, the tail and body should 
Jbe split from end to end, the claws ciacked, but not unshelled, 



Chap. XVI.] SHELL-FISH. 269 

ami the meat may be made into salad, or mixed in such manner 
as each person pleases, and many persons add a teaspoonful of 
white powdered sugar, thinking that it gives a mellowness to 
the whole. It is scarcely necessary to mention that the head 
of a lobster, and what are called the ^' lady-fingers," are not 
to be eaten. 

To stew Lobsters, — ^Take the meat out of the shells of 1 or 2 
boQed lobsters. Put the shells into a pint of water with some 
whole pepper, salt, and a little mace. Let it boil till all the 
goodness is extracted from the shells ; then strain it. Mix with 
a little cream, or thin melted butter, the rich portion of the 
lobster, and the coral : add a small quantity of lemon-juice and 
2 tablespoonfuls of wine, mix it with the gravy, and warm the 
lobster in it ; a few minutes will suffice. 

Or : — Cut the meat of a boiled lobster into pieces, and put 
them into a covered metal dish with a bit of butter, 2 l^^ge 
spoonfuls of any sort of gravy, 1 of soy or walnut-ketchup, a 
little salt and cayenne, with a glass of port wine, and warm it. 
If there be a lamp under the (&sh, you may do it at your own 
table within a few minutes. 

Another mode of stewing lobsters is : — Take the meat of 
2 lobsters, mince it small, and put it into a pint of beef-soup. 
Let it stew a little ; thicken it with a piece of butter rolled in 
flour ; add a glass of white wine, with a little pepper ; add salt 
and nutmeg, a spoonful of ketchup, 1 of anchovy, and 1 of 
lemon-juice. Let the whole stew together, and serve up, gar- 
nishing the dish with the small claws. 

To fricassee Lobster, — Parboil it, extract the meat from the 
shell, and cut it into small pieces ; season it with white pepper, 
salt, and nutmeg, and put it into the stewpan, with as much 
cream or richly-made white sauce as will cover it. Keep the 
lid close, set the pan on hot coals, and stew it slowly for about 
as long a time as it was previously boiled. 

Croquettes of Lobster, — Take the meat from the shell, 
chop it finely, mix it with a little salt, pepper, and pounded 
mace ; take i part of fine bread-crumbs, make it up into 
balls with melted butter, brush the balls with yolk of egg, 
and dredge them with bread-crumbs, and fry them, serving 
with or without gravy: if dry, they must be sent up with 
crisped parsley. 

Lobster Fritters, — Pick out the meat, chop it, and warm 



270 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XYI. 

it with some melted butter, adding shrimps or prawns if the 
quantity be small. Cut pieces of paste into pretty shapes, fiy 
them, and serve up the lobster heaped upon them, which is 
sometimes more convenient than making into patties. If, 
however, the pieces be put into the paste, which is then rolled 
around them, they make nice fritters. Or, if put into a shape 
and warmed before the fire, and browned with the salamander, 
they will make a very pretty side-dish. 

Miroton of Lobster, — Take the meat of a good-sized lobster, 
and put it into a mortar, with the crumb of a French roll 
soaked in cream; pound them well together; then add the 
yolks of 3 eggs, and some fat of ham also pounded ; season it 
with pepper, salt, and a little mace. Add the whole of an 
e^ beaten up to a strong froth, and take care that the spawn 
of the lobster should have been pounded with the rest. Line 
a mould with slices of fat bacon, put in the ingredients, and 
boil it for li hour. Serve up in a dish with lobster-sauce 
round it. 

Scolloped Lobster, — Take out the meat from 2 middling- 
sized lobsters, put it into a mortar, pound it with a little salt 
and some cayenne pepper, then mix it with fine white sauce ; 
have the shells ready, that is, the tails split, and the 2 bodies, 
making in all 6 pieces, which are enough for a dish. Put the 
lobster into the shells, and the shells either into an oven or 
upon a gridiron. Serve it very hot. 

Or : — Pound the fish in the above manner, adding only a 
very little salt with nutmeg instead of cayenne, and beat it up 
with thick cream ; it may then be either put into puff-paste for 
patties, or served up as a fricassee. 

These are all excellent dishes, and will form an elegant 
remove for a second course. 

PR A WNS AND SHRIMPS, 

279. — Which appear like diminutive species of lobster, are 
yet of separate tribes, the former being the larger of the two, 
though the shrimp is very generally thought to possess the 
highest flavour. They are in season at the same time as lob- 
sters, are boiled in the same manner, only for about half the 
time, and, when fresh, their colour is bright and the body 
firm. 

Both shrimps and prawns form a very common relish when 






■. XVI.] SHELL-FISH. 27l 

eaten cold at the breakfast-table, and when dressed hot the 
latter are celebrated for the fla4'our of their curry, as the former 
is in general use for the making of sauce. They also, as well 
as loiters, made excellent fritters and rissoles. 

To stmc. — Pick the meat out of the sbells, put it into a stew- 
pan with i- pint of good gravy and a glass of claret ; add an 
onion minced fine, some sweet herbs, and a little pepper and 
salt. Let them stew gently until quite tender; then add a 
large spoonful of mushroom ketchiip, 1 of essence of anchoiy, 
and ft piece of butter rolled iu flour. Serve up hot, and 
garnish with bread-sippets. 

If brought to table cold, as a supper dish, they will be found 
a very delicate and elegant entree, if served in a shape and 
covered with clear jeUy. 



280. — Though not so well known as the lobster, is looked 
upon by many as being a better-flavoured fish, and perhaps 
rather more digestible. The female is considered inferior to 
the male, and may be known by the claws being smaller, and 
the tail much wider. The heaviest are usually thought to be 
the best, but those of a middling size are the sweetest. If light, 
they are watery ; when in perfection, the joints of the legs are 
stiff; the shell, whether alive or dead, should be of a bright 
red ; and the body has a very agreeable smell. The eyes look 
dead and loose when stale, or when the fish have died a natural 
death. They are boiled in the same manner as lobster, but re- 
quire rather longer time, and are most usually eaten cold 
with oil and vinegar, as thus : — Pick out all the fish from the 
shell, divide it into small pieces, mixir^ the rich part well with 
the rest ; moisten it with salad dressing, and return it to the 
shell with an edge all round of sliced lemon. 

If hot, pick the fish out as above ; then put the meat, with a 
little nutmeg, salt, pepper, bits of butter, onunbs of bread, and 
3 spoonfuls of vinegar, into the shell again, and set it before 
the fire. You may brown it with a salmnauder, but it should 
be always served in the shell. Dry toast should be served 
to eat with it. Observe to remove " the lady," as it is 
called. 

To stew Crabs. — Pick the meat carefully out of a larg« 



272 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVI. 

crab and its claws ; cut into small pieces, mix it with about 
a fourth part of bread-crumbs, and a very small quantity of 
finely shred parsley. Season it well, and return it to the shell 
with some small bits of butter here and there, enough, when 
warmed, to keep it moist. Squeeze the juice of a lemon over 
it, or a spoonful of lemon-pickle or acid sauce. Put a thick 
layer of crumbs of bread upon the top with small bits of 
butter laid all over it, and bake it in the shell before the fire 
or in the oven. The shell of one crab will contain the meat 
of two. 

Or : — ^Boil them, take the meat out of the bodies and the 
large claws, put it into a stewpan with i pint of clar^, a 
spoonful of eschalot-vinegar, a fittle cayenne, some salt, and 
a piece of butter ; let them stew for an hour over a gentle 
fire, until they are almost dry. Then add a small quantity of 
fish-stock or gravy, a tablespoonful of essence of anchovy, and 
a small piece of butter rolled in flour. Serve with sippets of 
fried bread round the dish. 

Another way is to put the meat into a stewpan with ^ 
pint of white wine, a spoonful of eschalot or garlic vinegar, a 
little parsley and thyme minced fine, the yolks of 3 eggs 
boiled hard and minced small, and some salt and cayenne 
pepper. Let it stew gently till quite tender and almost dry ; 
then add a piece of butter, stir it about for a few minutes over 
the fire, wash the shells, butter them, put the stewed meat 
into them, and serve on a napkin. 

SMALL CRABS AND CRAYFISH 

281. — Are sometimes made into soup, but more commonly 
plain boiled for about i of an hour and eaten cold. In the 
lower parts of Germany they are, however, frequently eaten 
hot, with rye-bread and butter, and are there a favourite sup- 
per dish in the heat of summer. 

To stew Crayfish, — ^Boil them in salt and water, pick the 
meat out of the tails and claws, put them into a stewpan with 
a little butter, some mushrooms, and truflSes; moisten them 
with a little fish-stock, and simmer a short time over a gentle 
fire. When nearly done, beat the yolks of 2 or 3 eggs with 
a teaeupful of cream and a little chopped parsley ; let all 
stew together for a few minutes, stirring it all the time, and 
serve up in a deep dish. 



Chap. XVI.] SHELL-FISH. 273 

CTaafish Butter.— Take the shells of 24 crayfish, clean 
them well from skin and fibro, put them into an oven to dry, 
without burning or browning, until they can be beaten to a 
fine powder ; mis the powder very well with 3 ounces of fi-eah 
butter, then put it into a stewpan with a spoonful of hot 
water, miidng it weU Wither ; then squeeze the whole 
through a tamis over a litewpau of boiling water ; ekim the 
butter olf into a basin of cold water, that it may set ; when 
cold press it in a napkin. 

It forms a beauliful colouring addition to many kinds of 
dishes, fish especially, and, when mixed with the meat pounded 
after being- taken froui the sliells, makes fine sauce. 

OYSTERS 

282, — Depend very much for goodness upon the beds from 
which they have been taken. There are several kinds : the 
" Pyfleel, " Colchester," and " Milford," are excellent, and 
the " native Milton " are very fine, being white and fitt ; but 
others may he made to possess both tliese qualities in some 
degree by proper feeding. The rock oyster is lai^est, but 
usually iias a coarse flavour if eaten mw. 

They all come into season, according to law, on the 4th of 
August, and go out at the close of April ; or, according to 
an old saying, " so long as there is an R in the month." They 
are, however, not perfectly good until the beginning of Octo- 
ber, and should go out at the end of March. 

Althoi^h salt and water will alone preserve the flavour of 
the oysters in their greatest perfection if they be of good 
quality, yet, if thin, or appearing out of order, a sprinkling 
of oatmeal will, in the course of 2 days, tend to greatly im- 
prove and fatten them. When the fish is alive and strong, 
the shell closes on the knife. They should be eaten as opened, 
the flavour becoming poor if long exposed to the air. 

To scallop Oysters. — Take 12 of the smaller sort, beard 
them, cut out the hard part which adheres to their shdls, and 
leave them in their liquor ; have ready a quantity of crumbs 
of fresh bread, not too finely grated, and mizedwith a little 
pepper and salt ; then grease a scallop-shell, strew upon it 
Bome of the crumbs with bits of butter, and lay upon them a 
layer of the oysters ; then crumbs, bits of buttCT, and oysters, 
layer upon layer, until the shell is filled up ; cover it with a 



274 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVI. 

thick coating of the crumbs well buttered, and brown it in a 
Dutch oven. A dozen oysters, with a proper quantity of 
crumbs, will fill up the largest scallop-shell, and take an hour 
to be thoroughly done. 

Some cooks scald the oysters for 5 minutes in their own 
liquor, and mix with them minced shalot, or chives, and pot- 
herbs ; but these, although they may please an epicurean 
palate, will destroy the natural flavour of the oyster. 

Or : — ^Keep the oysters in their liquor, put a bit of butter 
in a stewpan, with minced parsley, shalot, and a little pepper ; 
brown them vnth a fried onion ; then add the oyster-liquor, 
strained, and a little good gravy, work them until they are of 
the consistence of sauce, but do not add flour to thicken it, 
as it spoils the taste of the oyster-liquor, and gives them a 
soddened appearance ; then toss and put in the oysters, add 
lemon-juice, and fill the scallop-shells, which may be put 
before the fire to be kept hot, but without bread-crumbs or 
artificial browning of any sort : they are an admirable addition 
to a rump-steak. 

To broil Oysters, — Take them from the shells, beard them, 
and put them with their liquor into tin shapes made to imitate 
scallops, 6 in a shell (not more), with a little pepper and 
butter. Put the shells upon a gridiron over a good fire, and 
serve them when plump and quite hot. They are delicious 
this way ; but to be eaten in perfection should be cooked in 
the room where they are eaten. Squeeze a little lemon-juice 
over them when they come from the fire. 

Or : — They may be put singly in their under shells along 
with their own liquor, a little minced parsley and spice, and 
a bit of butter, and thus put upon the gridiron, to be taken off" 
when thoroughly heated. 

With White Sauce, — ^Beard the oysters, wash them in their 
own liquor, then strain it, thicken it with melted butter, or 
white sauce made of cream, not milk and flour ; season it 
with a blade of mace and a few whole peppercorns tied in a 
muslin bag. Simmer the oysters very gently, and serve up 
with sippets of bread : they will require only a few minutes, 
and if allowed to boil will become hard. 

With Brown Sauce, — Wash the oysters in their liquor, and 

then strain it, add a glass of wine, 2 spoonfuls of beef-gravy, 

some whole pepper, a little salt, a piece of butter, and a 



Chap. XVI.] SHELL-FISH. 275 

H III 

' .spoonful of lemon-juice ; boil the whole, stirring it until it is 
smooth, then put in the oysters, and warm or plump them up 
without boiling. 

Oyster Rolls. — Take about a quart of the largest and finest 
oysters you can procure, stew them in their own liquor with 
some pepper, a very little mace, and some green onion 
chopped fine, thicken them with a little butter and a dust 
of flour when nearly done enough. Take 2 French rolls of 
' the square sort baked in tins, cut a piece ofi^ the top, and 
scoop out the greater part of the crumb, fill your roll with 
the oysters and the liquor, and set them near the fire on a 
chafing-dish filled with hot coals ; as the liquor soaks in, fill 
them with more, or if you have not any left, add a little good 
gravy boUing hot. 

Or ; — ^Let them first soak, then fasten in the top, cover the 
entire of the roll in batter, and bake it in the Dutch oven till 
well browned. 

Or : — Mince the oysters, season them only with mace and 
nutmeg, and fill the rolls up with cream or rich white sauce, 
and bake them as above : even one large roll will make a nice 
little dish, and is better than the smaller sort. 

Oyster Sausages may also be made of the larger kind, 
bearded and minced small, together with a moderate quantity 
of beef suet and bread-crumbs, to which should be added a 
forcemeat of pounded pork or veal, seasoned with spice and 
put into the usual skins. If well seasoned, they will keep 
good for a full week : 1 lb. of beef suet shred fine, and the 
same quantity of forcemeat, with bread-crumbs, should be put 
to each pint of oysters. 

Or : — Take i lb. of lean beef or mutton, i lb. of beef 
suet, 2 score of oysters bearded and scalded in their own 
liquor, then dried and all chopped together, adding bread- 
crumbs and yolks of eggs to bind the materials. Season well 
with salt, white pepper, mace, and a grate of nutmeg ; or if 
you wish to make it very savoury, leave out the mace and nut- 
meg, but add a little cayenne, with a minced shalot and a 
spoonful of garlic-vinegar. They may be either made as 
sausages, or fried into shapes in the usual way. 

MUSCLES— E. R. 

283. — Are more frequently eaten on the Continent than at 
English tables, but, though in little use, they are ver^ deli- 



276 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVI. 

clous in many sauces. They are also boiled or stewed in 
the following manner : open them, put them into a pan with 
their own liquor, to which add a large onion and some pars- 
ley, with 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar ; roll a piece of butter 
in flour, beat an egg, and add it to the gravy, warming the 
whole up very gradually. 

In France muscles are skewered upon a small skewer and 
roasted, or dipped into a thick batter and fried. 

In preparing muscles for table, care should be taken to 
destroy the beards, as well also as a small species of crab which 
is sometimes found in their shells. They are not in season 
during the summer. 

COCKLES AND PERIWINKLES, 

284. — Despicable as they may appear, make excellent sauces 
and even soups, the receipts for which may be foimd under 
their several heads in Chap. IV. 

To boil, — It is only necessary to put them in a stewpan 
with as much water as will prevent the bottom from burning, 
as the liquor oozing from them will be suflicient for the pur- 
pose : when the shells open wide enough to extract the fish, 
they will be sufficiently done. 

To stew. — Clean them and wash them from the sand in 3 
or 4 waters, boil them and pick them out of the shells. To a 
pint of the fish put i pint of fish-stock, 2 ounces of butter, 
and some pepper and salt ; add a spoonful of flour, stirred in 
gradually, and simmer over a slow fire, until it is of a proper 
thickness ; add a large spoonful of essence of ancho\y and one 
of mushroom ketchup. 

SCALLOPS, 

285. — To stew. — ^Boil them very well in salt and water, 
then take them out and stew them in a little of their liquor, 
a glass of white wine, and a little vinegar ; add some grated 
bread-crumbs, and the yolks of 2 or 3 hard eggs minced 
small. Stew all together till they are sufficiently done, then 
add a large spoonful of essence of anchovy and a good piece 
of butter rolled in flour: or stew very gradually in a rich 
white sauce, with thick cream, until quite hot, but without 
being allowed to boil, and serve with sippets. 

Crayfish, prawns, and shrimps may all be done in the same 
jmanner. 



Chap. XVI.] ' FISH. 277 



FILLETS OF FISH, 

286. — ^Take any white fish, bone, split, and cut them into 
handsome fillets, and squeeze the juice of a lemon over them, 
make a fine forcemeat with lobsters or shrimps, lay it thickly 
on the fillets, roll them up, and tie or skewer &em. Put 
them into a fish-gravy, and bake them in an oven : when done^ 
thicken the gravy and serve up the fish in it. 

TO SCOLLOP FISH 

287. — Is in some measure to make it into a pie, as the usual 
mode is to bake it in scollops or shapes resembling the shells ; 
as thus: — 

Flake the fish, and imbed it in bread-crumbs moistened with 
thin melted butter or cream, flavoured with any approved 
sauce ; cover the top thickly with bread-crumbs, lay bits of 
butter over, and bake it either before the fire or in a Dutch 
oven ; or lay the fish in the bottom of the dish, with a rich 
white sauce of cream, and cover the top only with bread- 
crumbs. 

UNE GRENADE, 

288. — Scrape gently the flesh of a large whiting from the 
skin and bones ; beat it in a mortar 15 minutes : having 
scraped 2 ounces of the finest fat bacon, beat them together 
another 15 minutes ; then add a tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley, 2 ounces of butter, a small bit of garlic chopped to a 
mash, a blade of mace in powder, and the beaten yolks of 2 
eggs, and pound a full i hour more : when to be used, mix 
well therein the fresh-beaten whites of 2 eggs, reserving a 
teaspoonful to be used as hereafter directed. Meanwhile take 
the bones and fins from 4 or 5 little red mullet, without in- 
juring the skin, and cut them lengthwise an inch wide ; do 
the same by a good-sized sole, having split but not removed 
any of the skin. Then stew a small veal sweetbread, a fresh 
artichoke-bottom, 8 oysters without the beard, and 2 trufifles 
cut in bits, for i of an hour in a little butter, and let it become 
cold. When all the above are in readiness, line a pan of 5 or 
6 inches in diameter with long slices of fat bacon, placed quite 
close, in the centre of which lay 4 bits of carrot, cut diamond 
shape, lengthwise ; cover the bacon with the strips of fish 
perfectly united, alternately putting the brown and white of 
the sole and the red of the mullet next to the bacon, and oa 



278 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVI. 

these i the forcemeat : then put in the sweetbread, &c., which 
cover with the remainder of the forcemeat, smoothing it over 
with the back of a spoon wetted with the white of the egg 
before directed to be preserved. Lay on it a buttered paper, 
put the cover of the pan on, and bake 20 minutes. 

When done, turn the grenade on the lid to drain, carefully 
remove the bacon without breaking the skin of the fish, and 
serve very hot, with rich veal gravy round, not over it. The 
entrails of the mullet will give additional flavour to the force- 
meat. Where they cannot be had, the red part of lobsters, 
used alternately with the brown and white of the sole or 
mackerel, will look beautiful. 

Grenade of Sole, — Split a fine sole downwards, take out 
the bone, and lard the inside with strips of gherkins and 
truffles, then cover one half of the sole with the following 
forcemeat, which will be again covered by the remaining half 
of the sole ; listen them together with 4 splinter skewers, and 
bake with 4 or 5 spoonfuls of weak meat or fish gravy. 

Make the forcemeat of any dressed fish, crumbs of bread, 
the hard yolk of an egg, half a spoonful of boiled celery-root, 
half an anchovy, a spoonful of parsley, and half as much 
chervil, both finely minced, a little fat bacon or butter, and a 
raw egg, pepper and salt. 

When dressed, keep the fish hot, while the gravy it was 
baked in is warmed with a spoonful of caper- vinegar, and the 
same of the gherkin-liquor, to serve round it, with a few sliced 
gherkins. 

CROQUETTES OF FISff.—E, R, 

289. — ^Take dressed fish of any kind, separate it from the 
bones, mince it with a little seasoning, an egg beaten with a 
teaspoonful of flour, and one of milk ; roll it into balls ; brush 
the outside with egg, and dredge it well with bread-crumbs, 
fry them of a nice colour : the bones, heads, tails, with an 
onion, an anchovy, and a pint of water, stewed together, will 
make the gravy. Lobsters make delicate croquettes ; in 
which case the shell should be broken, and boiled down for 
the gravy. 

RISSOLES OF FISH.—E. R. 

290. — Pick fipom the bones and skin any kind of cold fish, 
weigh it, and add one-third of grated br^ui-crumbs, a little 
cold melted butter^ a small onion, previously boiled and finely 



Chap. SVl.] FISH. 279 

minced, pepper, salt, and the yolks of 2 eggs to bind it 
together. Roll out thin some triimnings of puff-paste, cut it 
in 2-iiich square pieces, put in the middle of eacli a teaspooa- 
fiil of the mince ; wet, aud fold the paste over them, having 
cut them out with a. cutter. Eg^ ^em, and dip them in 
bread-cmmbB, fiy in lard, and serve dry, garnished with 
fried parsley. See that the edges of the paste be perfectly 
closed. 

CASSEROLE OF FIStT 

291. — 1» a title given, among others, by French cooks, to 
"poifson rechauffe," or fish which has been left after being 
dressed, and is meant to be re-heated. There are almost as 
many modes of doing this, as of originally dressing the various 
sorts ; but we here only retain a few of the most simple : — 

Take any kind of cold fish, and divide it into large flakes ; 
boil 2 or 3 eggs hard, and cut them into slices ; have also some 
mashed potatoes ; butter a mould, and put in the fish, eggs, 
and potatoes, with a little delicate seasoning of white pepper ; 
moisten the whole with cream, or thin melted butter, and a 
spoonful of essence of anchovies ; boil the mould and turn 
it out. 

Or : — Take some fish which has been dressed, and rub it 
through a sieve ; to i lb. of fish allow \ lb. of bread-crumbs, 
2 ^gs well beaten, 1 tableapoonful of essence of anchovies, 1 
of Harvey sauce, and a little salt and cayenne pepper ; mix all 
well together, and put it into a mould ; let it boil i an hour, 
and serve it with a good fish-sauce in the dish. 

Ot : — Take i pint of good gravy, with a couple of glasses 
of wine, 2 tablespoonfub of anchovy liquor, and 2 of vinegar, 
seasoned high with cayenne, mustard, salt, and shalot ; mince 
the fish, but do not put it in the mortar, and either warm it as 
a fiicassee, and bring it up in a dish with sippets ; or, put it 
into a form, piled up high in the centre, cover it with bread- 
crumbs and bits of butter, and brown it with a salamander. 

FISH TURTLE.— E.R. 
292. — For this imitation, sturgeon is the best material, but, 
if not in season, cut some ling into handsome pieces, and fry 
it ; then boil an equal quantity of skate, also cut in pieces ; 
and having cleaned and soaked 2 or 3 cod-sounds, stew them 
until green with a little spinach, and cut them into pieces ; 



280 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVI. 

then have a sufficient quantity of good gravy, into which the 
liquor of 2 or 3 dozen of oysters has been strained ; thicken it 
with cream or butter: put it into a stewpan with the fish 
already named, a lobster cut in pieces, a spoonful of essence of 
anchovies, and a glass of Madeira. Warm the whole together, 
and send it to table with a lemon garnish. The sauce to this 
dish must be very rich, and of a fine dark colour. 

FISH PATE. 

293. — This is a pretty mode of enclosing a fricassee of fish 
with a potato wall without a crust of pastry. Mash in a 
mortar as many potatoes as you may want, with a good piece 
of butter ; then, with the bowk of 2 silver spoons, raise a wall 
of it 2i inches high within the rim of the dish to be used^ 
Let the upper part be a little thinner than the lower ; smooth 
it ; and, after brushing it all over with egg, put it into the 
oven to become hot, and a little coloured. Before egging it, 
the outside may be ornamented with flowers, leaves, &c., by 
the small tin shapes used to cut paste. 

Beat the whole of a crab picked clean from the shell in a 
marble mortar, with white pepper and salt, nutmeg, and a very 
few crumbs of bread ; warm it with a little gravy thickened 
with cream or butter and a spoonful of wine, and, when 
thoroughly warmed, add a little lemon-juice. Pour it into 
potato walls previously baked, but not covered like a pie, 
and serve it up hot, either browning it with the salamander, or 
covering the top with fancifully arranged small claws. 

FISH CAKE, 

294. — Cut the meat from the bones, put them, the head and 
fins, over the fire to stew for gravy, with a pint of water, an 
onion, herbs, pepper, and salt. Mince the meat, put to it -J- 
part of crumbs of bread, a little minced onion, parsley, pepper, 
salt, and a very small bit of mace : mix well, and make it into 
a cake with white of egg and a little melted butter ; cover it 
with raspings, and fry it a pale brown, keeping a plate on the 
top while doing. Then lay it in a stewpan, with the fish 
gravy, and stew it gently i of an hour ; turn it twice, but with 
great care not to break it : cover it closely while stewing. 

Cake of dressed meat, done in the same way, is remarkably 
good. 



FISH-CUTLETS.--E. R. 

295.— Chop a considerable quantity of herbs with a small 
piece of shalot, seaaon it with pepper and salt, and put it into 
a stewpan with 2 oz. of butter ; as the butter is melting add a 
teaepoonful of essence of anchovies. Do not allow the butter 
to more than melt, and mix the whole well tt^ther ; then cut 
any kind of white iish, dresaed or raw, into tiaadsomo cutlets, 
and, when the herb seasoning is nearly cold, s|)read it on the 
fish thickly with a knife ; dredge the fish with bread-crumbs, 
and cook them on butter-pans in an oven, or before the fire. 
Stew a few silver button-onions, or a chopped onion, witJi any 
green vegetables in season, cut it into dice in a Uttle broth, 
add nasturtiums and a little of the pickle ; keep them in the 
middle of a dish, and lay the cutlets round. 

Or : — Take any fish previously dressed, pull it in pieces, 
and mix it with a little good stock, and any fish sauce which 
may have been left from table ; spread it on a flat dish, brush 
it with egg and sprinkle thick with bread-crumbs, cut it out 
in cutlets, and fry brown, 

KEDGEREE FOR BREAKFAST. 

296. — Boil 2 tablespoonfuls of rice, add any fish previoosly 

cooked (salmon or turbot is preferable), and nicely picked; 

beat up an egg well, and stir it in just before serving. The 

egg must not boil. 

FRICANDELLES OF FISH. 

297, — Take any quantity that may be convenient of either 
dressed or undressed fish of firm quality ; skin and bone it ; 
mince it of tlie size of dice, with a few anchovies, say 2 to 
each pound, seasoned with mace, cayenne, and a grating of 
nutmeg; soak the crumb of a French roll, 1 to each pound, in 
milk, and beat it up with the yolks of 2 eggs to each roll, bo 
as to make it into a pur^e, and put the fish into it ; warm the 
whole gently, and add to it a moderate quantity of cream. 

Put the fish thus prepared into a buttered mould, cover it 
thickly with bread-crumbs, and either bake it in a Dutch 
oven, or warm it before the fire, and brown it with the 
salamander. 

A few oysters are an excellent addition ; and if wine be 



282 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVI. 

employed instead of milk, the dish may be dressed in the same 
manner, but rather more highly seasoned. 

A MATELOTE OF FISH. 

298. — ^Take carp or tench, or both, together with an eel and 
any small fish ; cut them into pieces, and put them along with 
a quantity of button-onions into a stewpan containing just 
wine or gravy enough of any sort to cover them, and let them 
stew very gently until nearly done ; then have ready a couple 
of minced truffles and a good handful of siirimps to mix into 
the sauce, which may be made of either white or red wine : 
the red may be made the more savoury, but the white wine 
will be found the most delicate : it should be thickened with 
yolk of egg, and the dish garnished with sippets of fried bread. 

RAGOUT OF FISH, 

• 

299. — ^Take carp, tench, perch, pike, and eels ; clean and 
scale them well, and cut them into pieces for serving ; put in 
your stewpan a good-sized piece of butter, let it fry to a pale 
brown, fry some flour in it, and add a quart or two of good 
bouillon with a glass or two of red wine, and a few cloves and 
onions. When boiling, put your ragout into it, let it well 
boil, and add some lemon-juice before serving it up. 

A VOL-AU-VENT 

300. — Of fish, of any sort, is an elegant side-dish when pre- 
pared either with meat gravy or made up maigre. 
Muscles also make an excellent vol-au-vent, 

STEWED FISH, HEBREW FASHION.— E. R. 

301. — Take 3 or 4 parsley-roots, cut them into long thin 
slices, and 2 or 3 onions also sliced, boil them together in a 
quart of water imtil quite tender ; then flavour it with ground 
white pepper, nutmeg, mace, and a little saffron, the juice 
of 2 lemons, and a spoonful of vinegar. Put in the fish, and 
let it stew for 20 or 30 minutes; then take it out, strain 
the gravy, thicken it with a little flour and butter, have balls 
made of chopped fish, bread-crumbs, spices, and the yolk of 1 

. or 2 eggs mixed up together, and drop them into the liquor. 
Let them boil, then put in the fish, and serve it up with the 

dolls and parsley-roots. 



SISB CUSRY 

302. — Is prepared in the same way as chicken or rabbit, 
with this difference only, that the stock should be invariably 
composed offish broth. 

For potting, collaring, and pickling', as well as for fish- 
sauces, look to the several receipts under those heads. 

When flour is made use of in the preparation of flsh-st«wB 
or sauces, ■polato-JlouT is preferable to that made from wheat ; 
and in making them up, always use a wooden in preference to 
a *iheT gpoon. 

TO PRESERVE FISH FRESH. 

303. — Boil together 3 quarts of water and a pint of vinegar, 
in which, when quite boiling, put the fish, and just scald it, 
but not for more than 2 minutes. Then hang up the fish in a 
coot place, ajiii it will keep for 2 or 3 days, and dress as well 
aa if fresh caught. 

It will be seen that several of the fish receipts here given 
make excellent side-dishes. It was formerly the English 
custom only to admit fish in the first course, but this is no 
longer the case, since it now appears at many feshionable 
tables as a side-dish in all stipes of the dinner. 



284 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVH. 



CHAPTER XVII. 



6RAVT, SAUCES, AND GURRY. 

Thebe is nothing that requires more attention on the part of 
the cook than the sauces which are wanted to all made dishes ; 
and those who are clever and economical will always contrive 
to procure the basis of these sauces in the manner pointed out 
in various parts of this volume. Where a calf s head or a 
breast of veal is stewed, nothing more will be required, as both 
will yield an abundant supply, and it will only be necessary to 
give it the proper flavour with ham, or beef-bone, and ketchup. 

GRAVY 

May be made quite as good of the skirts of beef, kidney, 
or milt, or of the liver of a fat ox, as of any other kind of 
meat, if cut in pieces, fined with onions, and seasoned with, 
herbs and spices, as other gravies. A clever servant will 
contrive to supply, at a trifling expense, as much gravy as is 
wanted for the use of a smaU family by stewing down the 
trimmings of meat and bones. It may even be made of the 
shank-bones of legs and shoulders of mutton : they should be 
thrown into water, and, after a good soaking and brushing, be 
long boiled. The water in which they are done will add 
greatly to the richness of gravy, as does the jelly of cow-heels. 
The latter must lie all night in water, which causes the jelly 
to be of a good colour. When boiled 3 hours, and become 
cold, let the fat be carefully taken off*; and when apparently 
quite clear, lay some white paper upon it, rubbing it close 
with a spoon, which will remove every particle of grease, and 
it will be as pure as the jelly of a calf's foot. 

In preparing meat to stew for gravy, beat it with a mallet 

or rolling-pin, and score it across in various places, as this will 

make it give out its juices ; season it with pepper and salt, 

and put it into a stewpan with butter only, heating it gradu- 

alljr until it becomes brown, but shaking the pan frequently

285 



to see that it does not burn or stick to the bottom. It will 
generally be browned sufficiently in j- an hour. If kept in a 
very cool place and covered closely in a stone jar, it will keep 
good for 2 or 3 days in summer, and more than a week in 
winter, but should not be thickened until it is meant to be used. 

Tarragon and knotted marjoram, by some called '^ London 
thyme," are a great improvement to gravies, as also all those 
oondimenta enumerated in the chapter on soups, but should 
be added only a short lime before serving. 

Truffles and morels also thicken and improve the flavour of 
'gravies and soups : i oz. being carefully u'ashed of each, 
simmer them in a pint of water, and add the whole. 

In the preparation of large dinners for company, it is indis- 
pensable to procure strong gTa%-y to colour and impart flavour 
to sauces and ragouts, and this can be done by using coarse 
pieces of the lean of beef or veal, and the giblets or trimmings 
of poultry and game, with a small portion of a knuckle of 
ham ; but for this purpose it must be stewed for a long time, 
flkimued, strained, thickened, and afterwards flavoured with 
whatever condiments are most suited to the dish it is to 



STOCK FOB GRAVY. 

304. — A good mode of making stock for gravies is to cut lean 
beef thin, put it into a gravy 
pot without any butter or fat, 
and set it on a fire covered, but 
take care it does not burn ; let 
it slay till all the gravy that 
comes out of the meat is dried ^ 
up into it again, often stiaking 
it ; put as mueh water as will 
cover the meat, and let that stew 
away. Then put to the meat 
a small quantity of water, herbs, 
onions, spice, and a bit of lean 
ham ; simmer till it is rich, and 
keep it in a cool place. Do not 
take off the fat till going to be *^""^ ^''*- 

used. 

Or, an excellent itock may be made in this manner: — ^Put 
into a casserole 3 oz. of butter, 4 lat^ carrots, 6 middling 




286 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVII. 

onions, 3 roots of parsley sliced, a small sprig of thyme, 3 
cloves, 3 bay-leaves, 2 lbs. of roach, bream, or dace, cut 
small, with salt, pepper, and i a bottle of white (but not- 
sweet) wine, and nearly as much broth. Cover close, and 
simmer until the whole be mashed : strain it through a fine 
sieve. In another casserole stew a pint of mushrooms, a little 
parsley and chibols, in i pint of water, till the flavour of all 
be obtained : strain both liquors, and heat them together. 

A GRAVY WITHOUT MEAT. 

306. — Put a glass of small beer, a glass of water, some 
pepper, salt, lemon-peel grated, a bruised clove or two, and a 
tablespoonM of walnut-pickle, into a basin ; slice an onion, 
flour, and fry it in a piece of butter till it is brown ; turn all 
the above into a small tosser with the onion ; cover it, and 
let it sinmier 20 minutes ; strain it, and when cold take ofl* 
the fat. 

GRAVY FOR A HAUNCH OF VENISON. 

306.— Cut off" the fe.t from 2 or 3 lbs. of a loin of old 
mutton, and set it in steaks on a gridiron for a few minutes, 
just to brown one side ; put them into a saucepan with a quart 
of water, cover quite close for an hour, and simmer it gently ; 
then imcover it, and stew till the gravy is reduced to a pint ; 
season with salt only. 

GRAVY TO MAKE MUTTON EAT LIKE VENISON. 

307. — Pick a very stale woodcock or snipe, cut it in pieces 
(but first take out the bag from the entrails), and simmer with 
as much unseasoned meat-gravy as you will want. Strain it, 
and serve in the dish ; but if the mutton be not long kept, it 
will not acquire the venison flavour. 

VELOUTE. 

308.— Take 1 lb. of veal, with the remains of a fowl and a 
dozen of full-grown mushrooms, or a smaller number of green 
truffles; heat these in melted butter, or beef fat, without 
browning ; season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, or mixed spices, 
to which may be added a couple of carrots and onions, with a 
tablespoonful or two of flour. When boiled, skim off the fat, 
and let it simmer for li hour, after which strain it, and keep 
it closely stopped for further use. 

J^ssence of ffam, for improving the flavour of sauces, is 



Chap. XVII.] GRAVY, SAtJCES, AND CURRT. 287 

also made in nearly the same manner — the meat being stripped 
from the bone, and put into a saucepan with the bone broken 
in small pieces, then stewed in a small quantity of water for 
several hours until the liquor becomes thick ; after which it 
is strained, and again stewed with about the same quantity of 
very strong and well-spiced veal-gravy. If carefully bottled 
and corked it will remain good for a long time, and a spooniiil 
or two will be frequently found a useful addition. 

For White Meat. — Peel a lemon close to the juice, cut it 
into slices, and then into square bits; blanch the liver of a 
fowl, and chop it small ; mix the lemon and liver in a boat ; 
pour hot melted butter over the mixture, and stir it together, 
but do not let it boil, or it will become oily. 

Or : — ^Put the peel of a small lemon, cut very thin, info a 
pint of sweet rich cream, witli a sprig of lemon-thjme and 10 
white peppercorns ; simmer gently till it tastes well of the 
lemon, then strain it, and thicken it with i lb. of butter, and 
a dessertspoonful of flour rubbed in it ; boil it up, then pour 
the juice of the lemon strained into it, stirring it well. 

A RICH GRAVY. 

309. — Cut beef into thin slices, according to the quantity 
wanted ; slice onions thin, and flour both ; fry them of a light 
pale brown, but do not on any account suffer them to get black; 
put them into a stewpan, pour boiling water on the brownii^ 
in the frying-pan, boil it up, ajid pour on the meat. Put to 
it a bunch of parsley, thyme, and savory, a small bit of knotted 
marjoram, the same of tarragon, some mace, berries of all- 
spice, whole black peppers, a clove or two, and a bit of ham, 
or gammon of bacon. Simmer till you have extracted all the 
juices of the meat, and be sure to skim the moment it boils, 
and often after. If for a hare, or stewed fish, anchovy shoulq 
be added. 



SAUCES. 

MELTED BUTTER. 

310. — Although it may be presumed that every cook who 

understands her business knows how to melt butter, it is yet 

constantly brought to table either too thick or too thin, and 

not unfrequently filled with lumps of flour or in a state of ci\l. 



"288 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVII. 

aud requires more care in the management than is generally 
thought necessary. 

The excellence of melted butter greatly depends upon the 
pains taken to blend it with the flour before it is put upon 
the fire, the best plan of doing which is to rub them together 
with a knife on a wooden trencher. When well mixed, add 2 
tablespoonfuls of hot water, or the same quantity of milk ; 
put it into a small pipkin, shaking it one way until it boils, 
and not leaving it an instant ; it must boil a minute to take 
off the rawness, and if made of fresh butter add a little salt. 
Remember that if yoii set it on the hot coals, or over the fire, 
it will be oily ; if the butter and flour be not well mixed, it 
will be lumpy ; and if you put too much water, it will be thin 
and poor. By attending to these directions, and only using 
sufficient flour to prevent the butter from oiling, it will be 
rich and smooth. 

Or : — Mix together by degrees 2 spoonfuls of flour in cold 
water ; make it smooth and thin ; then put on a pint of water, 
let it boil, stir in the flour and water to make it the required 
thickness, cut i lb. of fresh butter in small pieces, put it into 
the flour and water, let it boil well ; it is then fit for use ; a 
pinch of salt may be required. 

When thin melted butter is required to pour over puddings, 
roast veal, &c., make it the same way, adding a larger pro- 
portion of water or milk, the latter rendering it rather whiter 
than the water ; and if meant to be more rich than common, 
use cream instead of milk. Indeed the French frequently en- 
rich melted butter by adding the yolk of a raw egg. 

Maitre (T Hotel Butter, — Put i lb. of fresh butter upon a 
plate, the juice of 2 lemons, and 2 large tablespoonfuls of 
chopped parsley, i a teaspoonful of salt, and i that quantity of 
white pepper ; mix all well together, and keep in a cool place 
for use. 

To brown Melted Butter, — Put a lump of butter into a 
fryingpan, and toss it round over the fire until it becomes 
brown ; then dredge some flour over it, which has been also 
browned by putting it either in the oven or before the fire, 
and stir it round with a spoon until the butter boils. 

By adding some of the flavoured vinegars and compound 
isaces to melted butter thus prepared, most of the fish-sauces 
can be made, and many of tiiose in conmion use are com- 
. petted in Una ample maimer. 



Chap. SVIL] GEAVY, SATJCES, AND CUERT. 289 

Parsley and BwHer.^Scald a large liaiidful of parsley in 
boiling water that has some salt in it ; when tender cliop it fine, 
and stir it into some rather thick melted butter. There should 
be sufRcient paraley to make the sauce green, and the parsley 
should not be put to the melted butter until about to be served, 
otherwise it will turn brown. 

Fennel Sauce. — Proceed as for parsley and butter. 

The first is used for the various purposes of fish, poultry, and 
fresh boiled meats ; fennel mostly for mackerel. 

Caper Sauce, ichite. — Put whole capers into melted butter, 
adding a little of the vinegar they are pickled in, a pint of 
salt, and sutficient cream to make it white. This is used 
principally for boiled mutton. 

Caper Sauee, brown. — Take some thick brown sauce, add- 
ing the vinegar the capers are pickled in ; season it highly 
with cayenne and salt. Put capers to the sauce jtist b^ore 
serving ; and they must be used liberally. 

Nasturtium buds or seeds are sometimes used as a substitute. 

EGG SAUCE. 

311.- — Boil the eggs hard, cut them in small dica, and put 
the pieces into melted butter. The yolk may however be 
crushed to a ponder, and used to thicken the butter. Or, if 
a more savoury sauce is required, boil 2 e^s hard, mince 
tliem very fine, add a third portion of grated ham or tongue, 
a very little white pepper, and the juice of a lemon ; warm it 
up in melted butter. It is chiefly used for roast fowl and salt 
codfish { and if the butter be sound, the salted will be found 
quite as good for all these purposes as the ircfih. 

OARLTC SAUCB.—B.B. 
312. — Peel the garlic, divide it into cloves, boil it for 5 
minutes in water, then pour it off; add boilii^ water, and bdl 
it 5 minutes longer; repeat the process a third and fourth 
time, then strain the garlic, and send it to table in white 
sauce. The strength of the flavour may be either increased 
or diminished according to the length of time in boilii^. 
In Languedoc, and many other parts of France, it is made hj 
pounding the cloves in a mortar, and adding sweet oil until it 
is thus made into a paste of the appearance of cream, and is 
eaten with all sorts of meat, both roast and boiled. If not 
used as sauce, the cloves will be found very delicate if served 
as a vegetaUe. If properly done, it will taste like almonds. 



290 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVII. 

ONION SAUCE. 

313. — While. — Peel the onions, and put them on the fire 
in cold water ; when it boils, pour t^e water ofi*, and fill up 
the saucepan from a kettle of boiling water to take out the 
strength of the onions. If this be done two or three times, 
they will become perfectly mild ; or if they be Spanish onions, 
boil them only once in milk ; then chop them, not too small, 
but so as to divide the pieces into flakes ; add to them butter 
that has been melted, rich, smooth, and thick. It is used to 
smother boiled rabbits, ducks, and tripe, or as sauce for a 
roast shoulder of mutton. Or beat the onions to a pulp, and 
pass them through a sieve to thicken the sauce^ and make it 
appear like cream ; although this would appear more delicate, 
yet many people prefer the former mode. 

Broum. — ^Peel and slice some large onions, and put them 
into a stewpan with a piece of butter. Stir them over the fire 
until they are of a fine light brown ; dust them with flour ; then 
put in a pint of good beef-gravy, with a little cayenne pepper 
and sauce ; when thus reduced by stewing to the proper thick- 
ness, rub them through the colander ; and just before serving 
up, squeeze in the juice of i a lemon, or serve without rubbing 
through the colander. 

This is preferable for roast meats. 

8HAL0T SAUCE, 
314. — Put a few chopped shalots into a little gravy, boiled 
clear, and nearly half as much vinegar ; season with pepper and 
salt ; boil ^ an hour. 

SAUCE FOR RUMP-STEAK. 
316. — Take equal parts of ale, red wine, and ketchup, a 
piece of butter, and a little pepper, with a teaspoonful of 
garlic-vinegar ; stir these over the fire in a small saucepan, 
and pour it very hot upon the steak. It will form a pleasant 
addition to the gravy of any roast meat, and can be made in a 

few minutes. 

SAUCE ROBERT. 

316. — Put a piece of butter, the size of an e^j into a sauce- 
pan; set it over the fire, and when browning throw in a 
handful of onions cut in small dice ; fry them brown, but 
do not let them bum ; add i a spoonful of flour, shake the 
onions in it, and give it another fry ; then put 4 spoonfuls of 
gravy, and some pepper and salt, and boil it gently 10 minutes ; 



Chap. XVH.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AITO CUBRY. 291 

skim it. When ready to serre, add a teaspoonful of made 
mustard, a spoonful of vinegar, and the juice of i a lemxmj 
and pour it round the steaks or chops. They should be of a 
fine yellow brown, and garnished with fried parsley and lemon. 
The sauce must not bou after the mustard is put in, otherwise 
it will curdle. 

SAUCES FOR ROAST BEEF OR MUTTON. 

317. — Grate horseradish on a bread-grater into a basin, then 
add 2 tablespoonfuls of cream with a little mustard and salt ; 
mix them well together ; then add 4 tablespoonfols of the beal 
vinegar, and mix the whole thoroughly. The vin^^ar and 
cream are both to be cold. This is a very fine sauce ; it may 
be served in a small tureen. 

Or : — Scrape the horseradish thin and chop it small, or 
grate it, which is better ; warm it in melted butter, addii^ a 
spoonful of mushroom ketchup, and one of walnut, or the 
vinegar from walnut pickle. 

Or ;— Scrape very fine or grate the horseradish ; add a little 
made mustard, and 2 spoonfuls of pounded white sugar to 4 of 
vinegar : mix the whole well together, and place it under the 
meat, when nearly done, to catch the gravy which drops &om 
it while roasting. This sauce should be very thick. 

Queen Mary's Sauce, — Take a shoulder of mutton that 
has hung till it is tender. When three parts roasted, put a 
soup-plate under it, with 3 spoonfuls of hot water, the same 
of port wine, a shalot, an anchovy chopped fine, and a little 
pepper ; baste the meat with this and the gravy that drops 
from it. When the mutton is taken up, turn the inside up- 
wards, score it various ways, pour the gravy over, and cover 
it with a quantity of fried crumbs of bread. 

Mandram is a sauce commonly used in the West Indies 
with roast beef and mutton. It is made with a sliced cucum- 
ber, a chopped shalot, and a minced green capsicum, mixed 
up in a couple of tablespoonfuls of Madeira wine and vinegar ; 
and as capsicums can be had green during great part of the 
autumn, it can be also made in England, but neither chilis 
nor capsicums, if dried, will impart the same flavour. 

MINT SAUCE, FOR ROAST LAMB, 

318. — Pick the leaves off the stalks; wash and dry them 
carefully ; chop them with a sharp knife very quickly, to pre- 



292 MODEBN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVn, 

serve their green colour ; put it into a boat ; add sufRcient 
vinegar to make it liquid, and powdered sugar to take off the 
acidity of the vinegar. 

MUSHROOM SA UCE. 

319.— White, — ^Put the mushrooms into a stewpan with 1 oz. 
of butter, some pepper and salt, and squeeze over diem the juice 
of i a lemon ; set them over the fire ; when they have given 
out their liquor, thicken it with flour and butter, and add suf- 
ficient cream to whiten the sauce. This is a very excellent 
sauce for fowls, rabbits, and all sorts of white j&icassees. 

Or : — Wash and pick a pint of young mushrooms, and rub 
them with salt, to take off the tender skin ; put them into a 
saucepan with a little salt, some nutmeg, a blade of mace, 
a pint of cream, and a good piece of butter rubbed in flour. 
Boil them up, and stir them till done ; then pour it round 
the chickens, &c. Garnish with lemon. If you cannot get 
fresh mushrooms, use pickled ones, done white, with a little 
mushroom-powder with the cream. 

Brown, — It may also be made brown by either putting the 
buttons into a pipkin, and frying them with a little butter until 
they become of a delicate brown, and then stewing them in strong 
gravy of either beef or veal ; or by making it of old mushrooms 
cheeped small, fried and stewed in the same manner, and then 
seasoned according to taste. It is much used for cutlets and 
many sorts of ragoiits. 

CELERY SAUCE. 

820. — Strip the outer parts of the stem, and, after carefully 
washing the remaining portion, cut it into small pieces ; put 
to it a blade of mace, without any other spice, and stew it in 
good veal broth until very tender ; it will take a good deal of 
time, more particularly the thick hard end of the root. After 
this thicken it with melted butter, and flavour 4t with a small 
quantity of white wine ; or it may be thickened with boiled 
cream without wine. It is usually served with boiled turkey, 
but is very delicate with any kind of white poultry or veal. 

Or: — Take the white part of 3 heads of celery, cut them 
in pieces 2 inches long ; boil them in a very little good white 
broth ; slice an onion thin ; put it in a stewpan with a little 
parsley and thyme, and a scrap of lean ham, or the ham may 
be omitted. Sweat the whole in a little butter until the onions 



Chap. XVH.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 293 

are done, then stir in sufficioit flour to thicken the sauce ; stir 
it over the fire well, then mix in gradually the liquor the 
celery was bofled in, and as much new milk boiling as may be 
required for the dish. Let it boil 20 minutes ; strain through 
a fine sieve ; put in the celery ; add salt and a little fine white 
sugar ; serve boiling hot, and rather thick. 

TR UFFLE 8 A UCE. 
321. — Take a pound of trufi9es ; brush and wash them care- 
fully ; put them in a stewpan with some good gravy, two wine* 
glasses of white wine, a small onion, a faggot, of parsley and 
tiiyme, and an ounce of bacon fiit. Let them stew gently 
until quite tender ; take them out, strain and skim the gravy, 
thicken it with roux or a lump of flour and butter ; peel the 
truffles, cut them in slices as thick as a penny-piece, warm 
them in the sauce, and serve. 

CHE8 TNUT 8A UCE. 

822. — Scald a score of chestnuts in hot water for 10 minutes ; 
skim them ; let them stew gently for about i an hour in some 
good gravy seasoned with a glass of white wine, a little white 
pepper, salt, and mace or nutmeg ; and when quite soft, serve 
them in the dish. 

Or : — Pulp them through a colander to thicken the gravy, 
making it either brown or white, by using in the former beef" 
gravy, and in the latter veal-broth, with pounded almonds, and 
without pepper. 

Either of these is equally fit for sauce to guinea-bird or 
turkey, as well as for stufling the body of the bird. 

SAUCES FOR WHITE POULTRY BOILED— E, R, 

323. — Liver-sattce. — Take the livers of as many fowls as 
may be required for the intended quantity of sauce, or, that of 
a rabbit being much larger, take 1 liver, boil it with some 
sprigs of thyme and parsley ; dissolve in the water, after taking 
it out, 2 anchovies boned ; boil 2 eggs hard, leave out 1 
white, and shred the rest with the liver, herbs, and anchovies ; 
pound them together in a mortar, adding a saltspoonful of 
g^ted lemon-peel and a little pepper and salt. Put it into 
the saucepan, squeeze upon it the juice of ^ a lemon, thicken 
the liquor with butter and a little flour, add to it the pounded 
ingredients, and stir it until finished. 

Or : — If gravy be used instead of water, and iutter Vsfe

omitted, the above may be properly employed as an excellent 
saoce for rocuted rabbit, or for fiill-grown poultry. 

While Sauce. — ^Boil a large blade of mace, a few cloves and 
peppercorns, in ^ a pint of soft water, until the flavour be ob- 
tamed ; strain it off, put it into a saucepan with 4 anchovies 
chopped fine, i lb. of butter rolled in flour, and i a pint of 
cream ; boil, and stir it well, 2 minutes. Put some in a tureen, 
and the renudnder in the dish. 

JFor Chickens. — ^Take the legs and necks, with a small bit 
of the scrag of veal or mutton ; put them into a saucepan with 
2 blades of mace, a few white peppercorns, an anchovy, a head 
of celery sliced, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a small bit of 
lemon-peel ; boil these in a quart of water to ^ a pint ; strain, 
and thicken it with i lb. of butter and some flour ; boil it 5 
minutes, then put in 2 spoonfuls of mushrooms, and, having 
beaten up the yolks of 2 eggs with a teacnpful of cream, put 
it into the sauce, and keep shaking it one way over the fire till 
it is nearly boiling ; then put it into a sauce-tureen. 

Vegetable Marrow Sauce, — Few sauces are more delicate 
as an accompaniment for young chickens, whether roast or 
boiled, than vegetable marrow when deprived of its seeds, if 
stewed to a pulp and passed through a fine sieve, so as to form 
it into a puree, which may be then thinned either with fowl- 
broth seasoned with mace, or with cream and nutmeg. 

SAUCES FOR ROAST FOWLS, 

324. — Stew any moderate quantity of ham, veal, and mush- 
rooms, with sweet herbs, a shalot, a little allspice, and a piece 
of butter, until all become brown ; then let the whole sinmier 
gently for a long time in either weak broth or water, until they 
form a strong gravy ; strain it, and season it with any addi- 
tional flavour that may be given by some of the made sauces. 
Serve hot in a sauce-tureen. 

Or : — Put into a small stewpan 2 slices of ham, a clove of 
garlic, a laurel-leaf, and sliced onions ; add a little good gravy, 
a sprig of knotted marjoram, and a spoonftil of tarragon vine- 
gar ; simmer slowly an hour, strain off, and put into the dish 
or a boat. 

Or : — Boil some veal-gravy, pepper, salt, the juice of a 
Seville orange and a lemon, and i as much of port wine as of 
gravy; and pour it into the dish or a boat.

Or : — If n'aiiled in a liurry, cut a few slices of culfs liver, 
or any kind of hrown meat ; fry tlmiii with a little lean liacon 
and an onion, and, wiieii browneil, pour upon them boiling 
wafer lo what strength you please, and sti'ain it. 

WHITE SA UCE. 

325.— It is seldom necessary to buy meat for this &vourite 
sauce, as the pruportiou of that flavour is but small. The 
water that has boiled fowls, veal, or rabbit, or a little broth 
that may be in the house, ut the feet and necks of chickens, 
or raw or dressed veal, will suffice. Stew any of these with 
a little wat«r, a bit of lemon-peel, some sliced onion, a few 
white peppercoruM, a little pounded mace or uutnieg, and a 
bunch of sweet herbs, until the flavour be good ; then stnun 
it, add a little good cream, a piece of butter, and a littU 
flour: salt to your taste. A squeeze of lemon may be added 
after the sauce is taken off the fire, shaking it well. Yolk of 
egg is often used in fricat«ee ; hut if you have any cream it is 
better, as the former is apt to curdle. 

Or .—Boil a stick of celery and a buuch of parsley in a pint 
of milk, adding white pepper and a little salt ; theu put 2 oi. 
of butter into a saucepan, let it melt, add to it an ouiun sliced 
tijin, dretlge in tlour uatil it is a paste, but do not allow it to 
become brown. Sti^n the milk, and add it by degrees to the 
butter and flour, stirring it very well ; then boil the whole 
together, stirring all the time, Euid boiling it until it is quite 
thick and smooth ; pass it through a fine sieve or tommy. If 
wilted to be very rich, let it cool a little, and then add an 
egg previously beaten, and mix very gradually j warm it 
over the fire, stirring it well, but do not let it boil, or it will 
curdle. 

Or : — Mix a teaspoonful of flour with i lb, of butter, a Uttle 
salt, and ground white pepper ; let them be well blended to- 
gether with a wooden spoon, then add a spoonful of vinegar, 
and 1 or 2 of water ; mix the whole bother, stirring it one 
way over the fire. 

CULLia. 

826. — Lay over the bottom of a stewpan as much lean 
veal as will cover it an inch thick : cover the veal with thin 
slices of undressed gammon, 2 or 3 onions, 2 or 3 bay-leaves, 
some sweet herbs, 2 blades of mace, and a few cloves. Cover 



296 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVH. 

the stewpan, and set it over a slow fire ; but when the juices 
come out, let the fire be a little quicker. When the meat is 
of a fine brown, fill the pan with good beef broth, boil and 
skim it, then simmer an hour ; add a little water, mixed with 
as much flour as will make it properly thick ; boil it ^ an 
hour, and strain it. This will keep a week. 

ROUX. 

« 

327. — White. — Put 2 oz. of butter into a stewpan over a 
slow fire, allow it to melt, then drain ofi* the buttermilk : 
make it into a paste by dredging flour over it, and keep it on 
the fire for i of an hour, taking care that it does not lose its 
colour. 

Brown is made in the same manner, only allowed to fry of 
a dark colour. French cooks use no other kind of browning, 

LIAISON. 

328. — To thicken or enrich White or Fish Soiqys^ use the 
following : — Pour the soup, boiling hot, on the beaten yolks of 
2 or 3 fresh eggs, from which the small tough substance found 
in it, and call^ '^ the tread," should be removed, nor should 
the soup be sufiered to boil after the eggs are added, as it is 
then apt to curdle. 

Or : — Break the yolk of an egg with 3 spoonfuls of cream, 
beat them up in the tureen and pour the boiling soup upon it. 
This may be made in the same proportion, and kept in a basin 
for other dishes. 

SAUCE FOR FRICANDEAU, OR ROAST VEAL. 

329. — Boil an unwashed anchovy cut small, with a cup of 

ravy, a glass of port wine, a shalot minced, and the juice of 
a small lemon ; strain, and mix in the dish with the gravy of 
the meat. Or use sorrel sauce (No. 428). 

SAUCE A LA MAtTRE IThStEL, 

330. — Put 8 tablespoonfuls of white sauce in a stewpan with 
4 of milk ; boil it 5 minutes, then stir in 3 oz. of maitre d'h6tel 
Iwtter (No. 310) ; stir it quickly over the fire till the butter 
is melted, but do not let it boil. This sauce should be made 
at the time of serving. 



Chap. XVII.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 297 

8 A UCES FOR GEESE. 

381. — For a Green Goose. — ^Take i pint of sorrel-juice, 2 
glasses of white wine, a nutm^ quartered, a cupful of fried 
crumbs, and 2 lumps of sugar ; let all boil together, then beat 
it smooth, adding a piece of fresh butter, and serve it very hot 
in a tureen, or in the dish with the goose. It should not be 
made too thick with the bread-crumbs; and if much acid 
should not be approved, the wine must be equal in quantity to 
the sorrel-juice. 

Gooseberry Sauce. — ^Wash some sorrel, put it into a cloth 
and press out the juice ; melt a piece of butter with flour, 
using this juice instead of water ; let it be very thick. jScald 
green gooseberries imtil very tender, and add them to the 
sauce. This is a fine acid sauce if not spoiled with sugar. If 
not sweetened, add a little cayenne pepper. 

For a Stubble Goose. — Mixa teaspoonful of made mustard, 
i a teaspoonful of salt, with a very litfile cayenne pepper, in 
a large wineglassftd of port wine, a tablespoonful of mush* 
room ketchup, i pint of gravy, 2 teaspoonfuls of lemon-juice, 
and a bit of butter rolled in flour ; stir and mix all thoroughly 
over the fire, and serve very hot in a sauceboat. 

Apple Sauce. — Pare, core, and slice some apples ; and put 
them in a stone jar, into a saucepan of water, or on a hot 
hearth. If on a hearth, let a spoonful or two of water be put 
m to hinder them from burning. When they are done, bruise 
them to a mash, and put to them a piece of butter the size of 
a nutmeg, and a little brown sugar if required ; but it destroys 
the slight acid flavour of the apples, and its corrective to goose 
and pork. 

Savoury Apple Sauce. — Pulp the apples, and, if wanted of 
a good colour, add to them a little juice of beet-root or cochi- 
neal : season with cayenne pepper, and a glass of vinegar or 
lemon-pickle, taking care not to make it too acid. This will 
prove a substitute for tomata or sorrel sauce, when neither 
can be obtained ; if for the latter, a little spinach-juice will 
give it a colour. 

SAUCE FOR DUCKLINGS. 

332. — ^Take young green onions or chives ; chop them very 
small, then put them into some thick melted butter, with 
pepper, salt, and a spoonful of lemon-pickle; stir it well 



298 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVII. 

together, and, when very hot, put it into the dish with the 
ducks upon it. Should the flavour of the onions be thought 
too strong, they may be scalded previously. 

Or : — jNIix i pint of sorrel-juice, a glass of white wine^ 
some scalded gooseberries, some white sugar, and a bit of 
butter. Boil ihem up and serve in a boat. 

SAUCE FOR SUCKING-FIG. 

333. — Take the inside of a French roll and boil it to a pulp, 
along with an onion and a little salt ; chop the brains and put 
them into a teacupful of the gravy that runs from the pig ; 
then take as much butter as will be sufficient for the sauce, 
and put into it a good squeeze of lemon, with i a glass of 
white wine. 

Some cooks make a stuffing for the pig in nearly the same 
manner, only making it with less butter and more bread, 
besides sometimes seasoning it with sage. 

Currant Sauce. — Clean an ounce of currants, and boil them 
in i pint of water for a few minutes, pour the whole over a 
teacupful of bread-crumbs ; let it soak, and then add a piece 
of butter rolled in flour, 4 or 6 cloves, and a glass of port 
wine ; beat it a little, and stir it over the fire until it is quite 
smooth. 

SA UCES FOR WILD'FO WL. 

334. — A teaspoonful of made mustard, the same of essence 
6f anchovies and red pepper ; a tablespoonful of ketchup, 
and a glass of claret. This receipt is from the Palace, and 
comes highly recommended. 

Or : — Simmer a teacupful of port wine, the same quantity 
of good meat gravy, a little shalot, a little pepper, salt, a 
grate of nutmeg, and a bit of mace, for 10 minutes : put in a 
bit of butter and flour, give it all one boil, and pour it through 
the birds. In general they are not stuffed, but may be done 
so if liked. 

Or : — Mince some shalots very fine, put them into a small 
saucepan with some peppercorns, 2 tablesjioonfuls of strong 
clear gravy, and the same quantity of vinegar ; when suf- 
ficiently boiled add a little salt, and strain it through a sieve. 
It may be served either hot or cold. 

Shikaree Sauce. — Mix together a dessertspoonful of pounded 
wAIte sugar, with the same quantity of cayenne pepper, or, if 



Chap. XVn.] filtAVY, SAUCES, AND CURHT. 299 

the parties be averse to so mucli pepper, a tea or salfcapoonfiil ; 
add to it a glass of claret or port wine, a glass of ketchup, or 
a desserlspoonfiil of essence of anchovies, and the juice of i a 
large lemon. Warm it over the fire, and either serve it up in 
a butter-boat, or, having scored the breast of the duck, and 
laid a slice of butter upon it, pour the sauce over. 

Col. ffawker'i Sauce. — Fort wine or claret 1 glaaa, sauce 
k la RuBse* 1 tablespooaful, ketchup 1 tablespoonful, lemon- 
juice 1 tablespoonful, lemon-peel 1 slice, ahalnf (large) 1 sliced, 
cayenne (the darkest) 4 grains, mace 1 or 2 blades : to be 
scalded, strained, and added to the gravy which comes fVoiii 
the fowl in roasting. The addition of a small spoonful of 
sugar would render this equal to shikaree, 

LIFER SAUCE FOR HARE OR ROAST RABBTT. 
335.— Stew the liver in some good gravy^-of beef for hare, 
and of veal for rabbit — -when quite tender chop it fine, with 
a clove of eschalot and some fine ]iotherbs, along with a 
teaspoonful of chili -vinegar, a wineglass of port wine, and i 
a teacupful of currant-jelly, if for hare, or white wine only for 

Or: — Pound the whole of the solid ing;redients, and mix 
them in the gmvy to thicken it, adding afterwards the vin«gar 
and wine. 

Or : — Take the crumb of a penny roll and rteep it in port 
wine, put it on the lire with a piece of butter ; beat it smooth, 
add pepper, salt, and jelly, with i a glass of vinegar ; let it 
boil, and serve it iq> very hot. 

S^ VCE FOR frufOED GAME. 
336. — Put a glass of white wine, i a lemon sliced, or a de§- 
aertspoonful of the juice, with a few strips of the peel of a 
Seville orange, and a apooniiil of sweet oil, to a teacupful of 
the gravy which runs from the birds, seasoned with a clove of 
garlic, salt, and a few peppercorns. Boil it for i of an hour, 
skim it, strain it through a sieve, and serve it. 

If for grouse or black-cock, port should be substituted for 
white wine. 

BREAD SAUCE. 
337. — Boil a lai;ge onion, cut into 4, with some whole black

300 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [CflUkP. XVIL 

pq^per, in milk, till the onion is quite a pap. Poor the milk 
rtnined on grated white stale bread, and ooTer it. In an 
boor pot it into a saoo^nn, with a good jneee of finesh butter ; 
boil the whole up together, and serve ; add a little salt. 

Or : — ^Take a large onion, slice it down Tery thin, pot it into 
some broth or water, 1^ it boil until tender ; add a sufficient 
quantity of bread-crumbs to thick^i it, 2 ounces of butter, 
pqiper, and salt, and a little good cream ; bcHl it until it is 
thick and Tery smooth, but do not allow it to be too thick to 
pour into the sauce-tureen. 

Or : — Grate a teaspoonful of fresh onion and put it to the 
bread-crumbs before the boiling milk is poured over it. 
Season it, and add a few grains of cayenne pepper. 

SAUCE FOR COLD FOWL OR PARTRIDGE. 

338. — Bub down in a mortar the yolks of 2 eggs boiled hard, 
an anchovy, 2 dessert^Kmnfuls of oil, 3 of vin^ar, a shalot, 
cayenne if approved, and a teaqpoonful of mustard. All 
should be pounded before the oil is added. Thea strain it. 
Shalot-vinegar, instead of shalot, eats well ; but then omit 
1 spoonful of the common vinegar. Salt to your taste. 

A most excellent accompaniment to cold roast fowls, or 
white game of any sort, is to bring it up covered with either 
common or clouted cream ; this is very customary throughout 
Devon and Cornwall. 

SAUCE A LA TART ARE, 

839. — Take the yolk of an ^g, and drop into it very slowly 
a tablespoonful of sweet oil, beating it up by degrees until 
perfectly mixed; add a tablespoonful of vinegar, a little 
chopped parsley, a tablespoonful of French mustard, pepper, 
and salt ; beat up the whole together : make and keep the 
sauce in a cold place ; put it into a dish, and lay the boiled 
fowl upon it. This sauce should be beaten till it resembles 
cream. 

POIVRADE SAUCE. 

340. — Chop 2 shalots, and bruise the yolk of a hard-boiled 
e^ with a little salt and cayenne pepper ; beat all up in a 
spoonful of mushroom or walnut ketchup, season with chili 
vinegar or the juice of lemon : to be made into proper con- 
mtence with melted butter if to be eaten hot, or with salad- 



Chap. XVH.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 801 

oil if cold. This is very relishing with either hot or cold 
game, and can be made in a few minutes. 

341. — ^ a large Spanish onion, 4 capsicoms, as much salt 
and lemon-juice as may be agreeable to tiie palate, all pounded 
together in a mortar. 

Fish Acha. — Boil a piece of salt fish, cut an onion and some 
capsicums in pieces, pound them wdl together, add a little 
vinegar, and make them into a puree. 

Indian-pickle Sauce. — ^Take some gravy, thicken with flour 
and butter ; cut in small dice some Indian pickle, add a little 
of the vinegar, let it boil up, throw in the dice, and serve hot. 
This is for salmon cutlets ; it is also good for broiled mackerel 
or for grilled chicken. 

SAUCES PiqUANTES-E. B. 

342. — Put into a stewpan the muscles of a knuckle of veal, 
some slices of ham or bacon, a cupful of graw, a spoonful or 
two of strong vinegar, a bayleaf, a clove of garlic, a little 
thyme, 1 clove, and a little salt ; skim it, and, when it has 
stewed i of an hour, pass it through a sieve : then add sorrel, 
parsley, and mushrooms, all chopped fine, and whole capers ; 
heat it again, and serve it in the dish. 

Or: — Put 1 or 2 oz. of butter, with 2 shred onions, a 
carrot, a parsnip, a little thyme, laurel, basil, 2 cloves, 2 
shalots, a clove of garlic, and some parsley, into a stewpan ; 
turn the whoM over the fire till it becomes brown, then shake 
in some flour, and moisten it with some broth and a spoonful 
of vinegar. Let it boil over a slow fire ; skim and strain it ; 
then add pepper and salt ; and serve with any dish of which you 
would wish to have the flavour heightened. 

A VEspagnole, — Besides a few slices of ham and veal, put 
into a stewpan any remains which you may have of poultry 
and game, and let them boil for 1 hour in water more than 
sufficient to cover them ; after which skim off" the fiit from the 
gravy, add fried onions, sweet herbs, a bay -leaf, spice, mace, 
and mushrooms, with minced carrots, celery, shalots, and a 
small clove of garlic, and leave the whole to stew until quite 
mashed : it will take full 2 hours. Then strain it, and if the 
gravy be not strong oiough add sufi&cient coulis or glaze to 



802 MODEBN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVH. 

make it so. If it wants flavour, add soy, and, if mushrooms 
had not been one of the ingredients, put in ketchup : if not thick 
enough, a little arrowroot, or conunon flour, with a piece of 
butter, will have the eflect ; but if the gravy be truly rich, it 
will not require the addition. 

Such is the foundation of the sauce; but in most cases 
white wine is added, for the purpose of stewing game : it is 
needless to say that Madeira and sherry are b^, but Cape or 
ganger wine will be found good substitutes. 

A la Provengale. — Put into a casserole 2 spoonfuls of 
sweet-oil, a shalot, a clove of garlic, and some mushrooms, all 
minced, and placed upon the fire in any sort of good strong 
broth, seasoned with pepper and salt, together with pot-herbs ; 
leave it there for i an hour ; then skim it so &r as to remove 
much of the appearance of the oil ; strain it, and add some 
white wine to suit the taste. 

Or^ as Sauce Maigre : — ^Pry a large quantity of onions and 
put them along with the above into the casserole, with white 
wine, until well browned ; then strain it ; add a tablespoonful 
of salad-oil with a little flour, and mix it gently, but continually, 
for a few minutes, until completely mingled. 

A VHollandaise — for meat, fowl, or fish. Put 6 spoonfuls 
of water and 2 of tarragon vinegar, with 1 oz. of butter, into 
a stewpan ; warm and thicken it with the yolks of 2 eggs. 
Make it quite hot, but do not boil it ; stir it all the time ; 
squeeze in the juice of i a lemon, and strain it through a sieve. 
Season with salt and cayenne. It should be quite thick. 

TOM A TA SA UCE. 

343. — Take i a dozen ripe tomatas; slice them; squeeze 
out the seeds and water, and put them, with salt, cayenne 
pepper, pounded mace, and allspice, into a stewpan, without 
any water, and let them simmer slowly in their own liquor till 
quite dissolved ; when completely done, pass them through a 
fine hair sieve, beat them up with a bit of butter, and serve 
them, if necessary, with lemon-juice. 

A Vltalienne. — Slice a couple of Spanish onions and i a 
dozen of tomatas into a stewpan, which, with a sprig of thyme, 
2 bay-leaves, 6 pods of pimento, 2 teaspoonfiils of curry- 
powder, salt, and a cup of rich gravy, simmer very gently until

the whaAe will pu^ Uuoagh a oolander; stir wdl, tint the 
araoe ma j not bom. 

A la FiroMfoise. — Take 6 or 8 tomatas, cot them in 2 and 
acroas ; aqoeeie out the Uqoor, and put them into a stewpan ; 
add a sficed onion, a Teiy small bit of garlic, a baj-kaf, a 
bunch of parsley, and a apoonfiil or two of Tinegar. Boil the 
whole together, rub through a tamis siere, thicken with flour 
and butter, and add a little g^aie. 

Or : — Squeeze out the water, nmmer the firuit with a little 
butter, salt, and ^egfety until it will pulp as above. If too 
dun, reduce it by btnling. A minute or two before serving, 
add a little vekmie and a bit of butter, and give it one boil ; 
or, even independently of the uefoade, it wiU make an agree- 
able sauce fior roast lamb. 

8A UCE A UX EPINARDS. 

344. — ^Pick off the stalks of the qnnach; wash and drain it ; 
then, without water, stew till it will beat to a mash. Put in a 
good piece of butter and some milk ; simmer, and stir over a 
slow fire till the sauce be of the consistence of thick mdted 
butter. Add a little pepper and salt while dressing. 

PUR^E DE COXCOMBRES, 

345. — Slice thin some middling-sized cucumbers, drain the 
liquor from them, and put them, with 4 onions, into a stewpan, 
with a piece of butter; when sufficiently stewed to pulp 
through a colander, add a large teacupful of cream, a Uttle 
flour and pepper. Boil 20 minutes, and, when going to serve, 
put in salt. 

SAUCE A LA STE, MENEHOULD,—E. R. 

346. — Put some butter into a stewpan, shake over it a little 
flour ; add a cupful of cream, parsley, young onions, ^ a bay- 
leaf, and a shidot. Put it on the fire, keeping it stirred. 
Then pass it through a sieve : put it on the fire again with 
some chopped parsley, a little pepper, and minced mushrooms. 
Serve it over boiled fowls. 

LA MAGNONNAISE. 

347. — Perhaps the most esteemed mode of making sauce for 
any sort of cold meats or fish is that known in France by this 
tide. 



304 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVn. 

Fat into a roand-bottomed baran the yolk of an egg and a 
pinch of salt; stir in very quickly, drop by drop, 2 table- 
spoonfuls of sweet chI, working the spoon Teiy rapidly round, 
to work in the oil ; when it is thick add a few drops of tar- 
ragon vinegar, then more chI, until there is sufficient sauce ; 
dun it with a little more vinegar. It should be quite thick, 
and rather acid. 

CARACHI.—E, R, 

348. — Take 1 head of garlic and cut each dove into 2 pieces, 
2 teaspoonfuls of cay^me pepper, 3 tablespocxifuls of soy, 3 
of mushroom ketchup, 3 of walnut pickle, 6 anchovies dis- 
solved, 2 or 3 spoonfuls of mangoe or Indian jnckle liquor, 
and a pint of the best vin^ar, with sufficient cochineal to 
colour. 

Both the above are thus sauces maigres, but when not in- 
tended for &st-days may be much improved by being made 
into B.purie with an admixture of melted calTs-foot jelly. 

8AUCE ROYALE 

349. — Is made by cutting a slice of white bread, and stewing 
it in white broth until it is quite thick ; then take it off the 
fire ; pound in a mortar the yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, and 
^ a dozen almonds reduced to paste, with the breast of a cold 
roast fowl ; mix this with the eggs and bread, and poimd them 
all together with a little pepper and salt; add a sufficient 
quantity of cream to make it of a proper consistence, and 
simmer the whole over the fire, stirring it all the time without 
letting it boil. 

Sauce a la JReine is nearly the same. — Bruise the breast 
of a chicken to a paste, and moisten it with a consomme 
of veal or fowl broth ; let it stew gently over a slow fire, and 
then pass it through the tamis and mix with it some bechamel 
sauce. Then have ready the yolks of 2 eggs beaten up with a 
large spoonful of thick cream, and stir the mixture into the 
sauce a minute or two before serving it up. 

Both the above are served at the most &shionable tables, 
and may be used with turkey-poults and guinea-birds.

odoiir, put in H dooBen of chilis diopped fine ; stir it mXL 
together far 4 nunutes, then pot in a small quantity of dried 
salt fish, not exceeding 2 square indies, chopped veiy fine ; 
keep stirring, and, as the butter dries, add a laige cupful of 
the pulp of fiesh tomatas, a teaqpoonful of salt, the juice of a 
kmon, and a little water ; mix the whole v erj well together, 
and let it be of the consistaice of a paste, though not too dij. 
It is eaten with cold meat, but wiU not keqi. 

CHETNEYAND QUIBI SAUCE. 

851. — ^Take 8 ox. of sharp apfte pared and cored, 8 oa. of 
tomatas, 8 ox. of salt, 8 ox. of brown sugar, 80s. dT raiiins, 
4 ox. of red chilis, 4 ox. of ginger powdered, 2 ox. of gaiHc, 
and 2 ox. of shalots. Pound all these ingredients separately 
in a mortar, using cayenne pef^per if chilis are not to be had. 
Mix the wWe together, and add 3 quarts of yin^^ and 1 
quart of lemon-juice. Place the jar containing this composition 
on a stove, or by the side of a fire in a heat not less than 130*' 
Fahrenheit, and stir it twice a-day far a month ; then strain, 
but do not squeexe it dry. Bottle the liquor, whidi is an 
excellent sauce for any kind of fish or meat, hot or cold. A 
teaspoonful will impart a fine flavour to any rago(it, or be 
sufficient for a pint of broth. The residue, which ii the chet- 
ney, should be put into pots or jars. It may also be used in 
sauces and g^vies, or eaten like mustard, with cold meat, or 
spread upon grills, being an excellent ingredient for devils, 
wet or dry. This admirable sauce is the invention of Colonel 
Tapp, and in India goes by his name. It may be made very 
good with \inegar only, omitting the lemon-juice. 

KHICHAREE SAUCE. 

352. — Boil a pint of rice in broth, and, having steeped a 
teacupful of dried peas in water, boil them till they are soft. 
Then slice 2 or 3 onions, and firy them in butter, with 
a dozen or two of cardamom-seeds, a little white pepper, 6 
doves, and salt ; take out the onions when browned, and the 
spice, and add a cup of curds or milk to the butter ; stew it a 
little ; distribute the onions, spice, and peas equally through 
the rice, and pour the butter, &c., over it. Or put the whole 
into an earthen jar ; secure the aperture with a paste, and put 
into an oven, or over a charcoal fire, for 25 minvtes, adding

sufRdent broth to moUten it, in which case the rice must onlj" 
be half boiled previously. 

CHRISTOPHER NORTH'S SAUCE. 
9.13. — To a glass of port wine add a tablespoonful of lemon- 
jiuce, 2 of Harvey's sauce, a dessertspoonful of mushroom 
ketchup, the same of pounded loaf sugar, a saltspoouful of 
cayenne pepper, and a Bmall quantity of salt. Mix these 
well tag;ether, and set it to heat in a, bain-marie, as it should 
not boil. It is excellent either with game or meat. 

PUDDING SAUCE. 
■ 364. — Sweeten i pint of melted butter, add a little grated 
lemon-peel or nutmeg, and a 
couple of glasses of white wine ; 
make it quite hot, but not to 
boil, and serve immediately. 

GERMAN PUDDING SAUCE. 
856. — Sweeten i pint of white 
wine, make it almost boil, and 
pour it hot to the yolks of 6 well- 
beaten eggs ; whisk it well, or 
mill it in a machine like a cho- 
colate-mill. This is a very deli- 
Pot fbr Milling Bauc ^^^^ ^^^ over a plum ^ any 

other boiled pudding ; if a plain batter pudding, a little lemon- 
juice is an improvement. 

SAUCES FOB FISH. 

366. — The stock for fish sauces should be made of the water 
in which fish has been boiled, adding the bones, fins, &c., all 
well stewed down ; wheo fish is filleted, the bones should 
always be employed in tliis way : stew them with an ouion 
and a little white pepper, strain the broth, which will be very 
rich, thicken it with cream, butter, and flour, or rous ; and 
add whatever the sauce b to be made of. The following may 
be generally used, according to fancy, for nearly every species 
offish. 

Borseraduh Sauce. — Stew an onion in a little fish-stock 
until it will pulp ; add a teaspoonfiil of grated horseradish, 
and 1 or 2 spoonfuls of essence of anchovies. Beat all together 




Chap. XVH.] GBAVT, SAT7CEH, AND CURRY. 307 

over 3 fire, thicken it with a little butter, and 6nish with a 
.spoonfiil of lenioii-))ickle or lemon-juice. Vinegar may be 
substituted, in which caae it must be mixed with the horee- 
ladigfa, and boiled with it ; while the lemon, or lemon -pickle, 
being; of a more delicate fiavour, should only be warmed. 

Or : — ^rape the horseiadish thin and chop it small, or 
grate it, which is better ; warm it in melted butter, adding a 
spoonful of mushroom ketchup, and one of walnut, or the 
vinegar from walnut -pickle. 

For freshtcater FUh.-^Toke 2 large anchovies, ^ an onion 
finely chopped, 1 spoonfiil of vinegar, anti 4 of sherry or 
ginger nine: boil it together, thicken it with flour, and add 
4 spooniiils of cream or melted butter, in which latter case 
the Hour may be omitled. 

For alt torts of Fish.- — Take a spoonful of vinegar, 1 of 
Indian soy, the same of mushroom ketchup and Harvey's sauce, 
with a little cayenne. Add 3 lai^e spoonfuls of melted 
butter ; stir all well, and heat it over the fire. 

Or : — Put equal quantities of water and vinegar into a 
sauc^ian, «nd tlucken it with the yolk of an egg to every 4 
spoonfuls of the water and vinegar. Make it quite hot, but 
do not boil it ; stir it or shake the pan all the time ; season it 
to your likuig, and add a spoonful of the liquid to e\ery 3 of 
melted butter. 

While Sauce. — i a pint of cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of mush- 
room ketchup, I of essence <^ anchovy, wtth a little cayenne 
p^per, and an ounce or two of butter rolled in flour ; boil all 
together for 5 minutes. 

Btowh Savce. — Fry an onion in butter and flour until it 
becomes brown ; then simmer it in a glass of port wine, with 
a tablespoonfiil of soy and walnut ketchup, seasoned with salt 
and cayenne ; strain it, and thicken it with the necessaiy 
quantity of melted butter. 

Fish Sauce without ^uM^.— Simmer very gently \ pint 
of vinegar and i pint of water (which must not be hard), 
with an onion, h a handful of scraped horseradish, and the 
following spices lightly bruised — 4 cloves, 2 blades of mace, 
and i a teaspoooful of black pepper. When the onion is 
quite tender, chop it small with 3 anchovies, and set the 
whole on the fire to boil for a few minutes, with a spoonful of 
ketchup. In the mean time have ready and well beaten the

308 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVU. 

yolks of 3 firesh eggs ; strain them, mix the liquor by degrees 
with them, and, when well mixed, set the saucepan over a 
gentle fire, keeping the basin in one hand, into which toss the 
sauce to and fit), and shake the saucepan over the fire, that 
the eggs may not curdle. Do not boil them, only let 
the sauce be hot enough to give it the thickness of melted 
butter. 

Dutch JFUh^sauce, — Put 2 blades of mace into 2 table- 
spoonfuls of vin^ar, boil it till reduced to 1 ; add the yolk 
of an egg, mix it well together. Put to it i lb. of butter 
kneaded with flour, stir it over the fire, but do not let it boil. 
If it should curdle a little cold water will smoothen it again. 

OYSTER SAUCE. 

357. — Scald the oysters in their own liquor, beard them, 
strain the liquor, let it settle ; melt a piece of fiesh butter, 
add flour sufficient to thicken the quantity of sauce, let it fry 
a little ; pour in the liquor of the oysters and sufficient cream 
to make it the required thickness ; suid salt, cayenne, and the 
oysters. 

Or : — ^This is almost universally served with boiled cod. 
Beard the oysters, and put the beards with the liquor to stew 
for about i of an hour, together with a blade of mace ; then 
strain the liquor, put the oysters into it, and let them just boil 
upj adding some butter which has been rubbed in flour and 
a little cream or milk ; but do not let them quite boil, or they 
will become hard. 

Or : — To every dozen of oysters put 1 ounce of butter melted 
very thick, and diluted with the oyster-liquor, i a glass of 
white wine, and veal broth, seasoned only with salt and a very 
little cayenne pepper. Should the oysters be of the large sort, 
they may be cut in half, which will aflbrd the opportunity of 
jremoving the hard part contained in the centre. 

Brown Oyster-sauce is frequently served up with rump-steaks. 
As the butter destroys the savouriness of the meat, the oysters, 
instead of being stewed in white sauce, should be dressed in 
strong beef-gravy, along with a good portion of ketchup, 
either stewed for a few minutes very gently, or put into an 
uncovered dish along with the gravy, and placed before the 
fire in a Dutch oven to brown. 2 dozen will fill a pint tureen ; 
this sauce will also be found excellent as an accompanim ent to 
wast turkey. 



Chap. XVH.] GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 309 

MUSCLE AND COCKLE SAUCES. 
858. — ^Proceed in the same manner aa either of the above 
receipts, taking care to deprive the muscle of a dark spot in 
the body, which some people consider poisonous, and to well 
wash the cockleB from sand. They may be equally used with 
codfish, codliDg, and haddock ; but the latter is most usually 
served with parsley and butter. 

LOBSTER SAUCE. 

359. — Pick the meat from a lobster and cut it into small 
pieces. Break the shell, and stew it with the legs, &c., in 
li pint of water, until reduced to the quantity required j then 
strain ; add flour and water to thicken it, found some of the 
live spawn from the tail, adding a little water to it ; when 
well pounded pour it by degrees into the sauce ; let it boil 
up ; add fresh butter to it in tlie proportion of i lb. of butter 
to a qtiart of sauce ; throw in the lobster : season with a little 
anchovy, cayenne, salt, and a small quantity of lemon-juice. 
It should be thick rather than thin. 

Or : — Take a cold boiled hen lobster ; split the tail, and 
pound the coral, which is found in the lail and in the body, in 
a mortar, adding a little sweet oil. Then chop the meat of 
the body into very small pieces, and rub it, along with the soft 
parts and coral, through a sieve. That done, cut up the flesh 
of the claws and tail into dice, and stir the entire mlsture 
gradually into the proper quantity of melted butter, without 
Bufiering it to boil ; as, if too much heated, the flavour and 
colour of the sauce will be injured. The seasoning should 
only be a moderate quantity of mace and cayenne, with i a 
glass of white wine, or a cup of cream, to a pint tureen of 

Crab Sauce is made in the same manner ; but crabs, bdng 
without coral, and the flesh less Arm than that of lobster, form 
a rather inferior sauce. 

SHRIMP SA UCE. 
360. — Pick the heads and skins irom some fresh shrimpB, 
and stew these o&ls for h an hour in a small quantity of 
boiling water to extract their flavour ; then strain the liquor 
and make use of it in melting the butter in which the sb^ed 
shrimps are to be dressed ; these are then to be put into the 



310 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVII. 

butter and liquor to simmer gently for about 20 minutes, in 
which time they will be sufficiently done, and their flavour is 
so delicate that neither anchory sauce, mace, cayenne pepper, 
nor any other condiment than siedt, should be put to them ; add 
a little cream. 

A pint of unshelled shrimps will make a tureen of sauce 
large enough for 4 or 5 persons. 

Fresh-water Crawfish Sauce is commonly made by either 
simply picking out the fish and mincing it in the same manner 
as lobster ; or, pounding the shells and legs in a mortar, and 
after stewing them down to something like a pulp, then passing 
it through a sieve, and mixing the whole together. 

SAUCE FOR STURGEON. 

861. — As this fish is generally stewed, the sauce is that in 
which it has been dressed ; or, if either broiled or fried in 
steaks, any of the piquant store sauces may be used along 
with wine and lemon-juice thickened with cream and melted 
butter. 

SA UCES FOR CARP, PIKE, AND TENCH. 

362. — Rub i lb. of butter with a teaspoonful of flour, put 
to it a little water, melt it, and add near i pint of thick 
cream, and i an anchovy chopped fine, not washed ; set it 
over the fire, and as it boils up add a large spoonful of real 
India soy. If that does not give it a fine colour, put a little 
more. Turn it into the sauce-tureen, and put some salt and 
i a lemon : stir it well, to prevent its curdling. 

Sauce for Fried or Broiled Carp, — ^A gill of white wine, 
a couple of anchovies boned and minced, with an onion or^two, 
and a little Seville orange or lemon peel, boiled in a teacupful 
of the gravy of either meat or fish, and then put into i lb. 
of butter, to which, when melted, the yolk of a raw eg^ may 
be added, and when it boils up squeeze into it the greater part 
of the lemon or orange juice. 

Or : — Anchovies, mushrooms, capers, and a shalot, all finely 
minced and stewed as above, with a little pepper and the juice 
of a lemon. 

Baked Pike and Tench may also be served with the sauces 
for broiled and fried carp ; or sometimes with only caper- 
jsauce. 



Cbap. XTU.] gravy, sauces, and curry. 311 

Smid/s, S/»^ls, Roack, Gudgeon, and Dace are always 
ntber fried or broiled ; and the best sauce for either, if not used 
merely aa a garnish, is the juice of a. lemon with a little cay- 
enne pepper, merely pulling off the heads of the smaller fish, 
and dipping the body in the juice. 

The juice of a lemon is also sufficient for whitebait ; but in 
all sour sauces the flavour of tbe Seville orange is preferable 
to the acidity of the lemon. 

SAUCE FOR EELS. 

363. — If the eels be spitchcocked in their skins, then some 
piquant sauce, as sauce a la tartare, is the best for correcting 
tiieir richness ; but if stripped of their skins and covered with 
bread-cnuubs, then plain melted butter, seasoned from the 
cruets, or any of the milder sauces in these receipts, are more 
appropriate. 

£oiUd eels are frequently served with capers and sometimes 
with sorrel sauce or parsley and butter ; and slewed eels have 
always the sauce in which they liave been dressed. 

JELLY TO COVER COLD FISIL 

364. — Clean a skate, and put it into 3 quarts of water, with' 
a cairs-foot or cow-heel, a stick of horseradish, an onion, 3 
blades of mace, some white pepper, a piece of lemon -peel, and 
a good slice of lean gammon. Stew until it will Jelly ; strain 
it off: when cold, remove every bit of fat ; take it up from the 
sediment, and boil it with a glass of sherry, the whites of 4 or. 
5 eggs, and a piece of lemon. Boil widiout stirring; and 
a^r a few minutes set it by to stand i an hour, and strain it 
through a bag or sieve, with a cloth in it. Cover the fish with 
it when cold, lightly roi^;hed. 



CURRIES. 
365. — Curry, which was formerly a dish almost exclusively 
for the table of those who had made a long residence in India, 
is now so completely naturalized, that few dinners are thought 
complete unless there is one on the table ; it therefore becomes 
necessary to give a few hints, which will be applicable to 
every variety. It is of the first importance to procure good 
" curry-powder ;" there are a great many receipts for nuUun^ 



312 MODEBN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVH. 

it, some of which we shall give, but the one most to be relied 
upon is prepared at Apothecaries' Hall, and called ^^ Colonel 
Lys's curry-powder." — The rice also forms a very important 
part of a curry, and great care is required in boiling it. The 
^^ Patna " is the best for this purpose. In India this dish is 
varied by the addition of greea fniits and vegetables, which 
give a delicious add and piquancy to it ; we are apt to rely 
too much upon turmeric and cayenne pepper for the flavour. 
The cocoa-nut is also a fiivourite ingredient in the Oriental 
curry. At those seasons when the cocoa-nut is fresh imported 
into England, a couple of ounces of a good sound nut, grated 
and stewed for an hour, would gpreatly improve a curry made 
of white meat. Cucumbers, vegetable marrow, spinach, to- 
mata, celery, acid apple, peas, and almost any kind of green 
vegetables or fruit, might be added with advantage to different 
kinds of curry. The receipts here given have been selected as 
best suited to the English taste. Several others will be found 
under the several heads of the meats or material which distin- 
guish them. 

To prepare a Curry. — ^The meat should be firesh and free 
from bone. Cut it into pieces which can be easily served. 
To each pound of meat aidd a tablespoonful of curry powder 
and about half the quantity of flour, and a little salt ; mix 
these together, and rub a portion of it upon the meat before it 
is fried, the remainder afterwards. Fry the meat in a little 
butter. Fry onions a light brown, with a clove of garlic if 
approved ; drain the fat from both the meat and onions ; put 
them into a stewpan, and cover with boiling water ; stew for 
20 minutes, then rub the remainder of the powder smooth 
with a little cold water, add it, and let it stew for an hour, or 
according to the time necessary for the meat to be well done. 
If no other acid is used, stir in a little lemon-juice just before 
serving : place it in the centre of the dish, and put carefully 
boiled rice round it. 

CURB Y FO WDER8. 

366. — 1 oz. of ginger, the same of coriander-seed, i oz. of 
cayenne pepper, and 2 oz. of fine pale turmeric ;* these ingre- 
dients to be pounded separately to a fine powder, and then 
warmed by the fire, and mixed together. Put the powder into

^KXmfiils of lemon-pickle and 4 of cream, adding this mixture 
to the fried onions and butter, &c. 

Or: — 14 oz.. of mustard-seed scorched and finely powdered,

together, and ke^ the powder in a dry place. 

MODES OF BOILIIfO BICE.—E.S. 
The great art in boiling rice is to keep every grain separate ; 
the pot should, therefore, be k^t on a strong Hre, so as to 
ke^ the water in a constant boil, as this motion will prevent 
the grains from sticking 'together. The pot should be left 
uncovered, and close attentLOn b necessary on the part of the 



314 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVIL 

cook to watch the rice ; take the pot off the fire the moment 
it is done, strain and dry it immediately. 

367. — Wash the rice well, and boil it in a large quantity of 
water : when a very little of the centre of the grain remains 
hard, take it off the fire, strain off i or more of the hot water, 
fill the saucepan with cold water, and shake the rice ; then 
strain all the water off, and the grain will separate ; place the 
pan of rice near the fire to swell, and the centre part of the 
grains will become tender.* 

Or: — Take 1 lb. of rice, soak it for 4 minutes, then put it 
into 4 times its weight of boiling water, and, when sufHciently 
done, drain off the water thoroughly, and replace the saucepan 
on the fire until the grains separate. 

Or : — Wash i lb. of rice in salt and water, then put it into 
2 quarts of boiling water, and let it boil briskly for about 20 
minutes ; but, though until the grains become tender j yet not 
long enough to let them become soft. Then strain it through 
a sieve, put the rice into a dish, and place it, uncover^^ 
for a short time before the fire to dry it ; when that is done, 
send it up quite hot, either in a separate dish, or around the 
curry. 

THE KING OF OUDITS CURRY, 

368. — Take i lb. of fresh butter, 2 large onions, a gill of 
good gravy (veal is the best), 1 large pressed tablespoonful 
of curry-powder ; add to these ingredients any kind of meat 
cut into pieces. Put the whole into a stewpan, cover it close, 
and gently simmer for 2 hours. When ready to serve up, 
squeeze as much lemon -juice as will give it an acid flavour. 

BENGAL CURRY. 

369. — ^Take a drachm of red pepper, 6 onions, and 1 oz. 
of coriander-seed free from the husks ; rub the seeds per- 
fectly smooth in a mortar; then add and pound the pepper 
and onions, mixing all well together. That done, set i lb. of 
butter in a stewpan on the fire, slice an onion into it, and, 
when the latter is brown, take it out, and put in 2 drachms of 
turmeric. Let it fry until the raw flavour goes off; then mix 
i pint of curds with the pounded ingredients, and put the 
whole into the pan with the meat cut in pieces, 2 oz. of grated

while the meat is getting brown, ppriukle water to prevent it 
irom burning. 

LORD CUVE'S CURRY.— B. H. 

370. — Slice 6 onions, 1 green apple, and a clove of garlic ; 
stew them in a little good stock until the; will pulp, then add 
1 tea-spoonful of curry-powder, a few tablespoon fnis of stock, 
a little salt and a little cayenne pepper, i a saltspoonful of 
■each ; stew in this graiy any kind of meat cut into small 
jneces, adding a piece of butter, llie size of a walnut, rolled in 
fiour. 

THE HASTIIVGS CURBY.—E. R. 

371. — Brown J- lb. of fresh butter, slice 2 large onions, and 
fry them. Cut fine the heart of a hard white cabliage, and a 
large sour apple ; put the whole into a stevpan, add a tea- 
spoonful of cayenne pepper, 1 of black pepper, 1 of tnmieric, 
the juice of ^ a lemon, and a gill of strong gravy. Cut up a 
fowl, flour it, add a little salt, put it with the rest of the in- 
gredients, cover it closely to keep in the steam, and let it stew 
for 3 hours. 

PRAWN CURRY. 

372. — Take a pint of prawns or shrimps, boiled and shelled, 
put 2 oz. of butter into a stewpan, with an onion finely 
ehred, and 2 spoonfula of curry-powder; stew them weU 
together, and then put in the fish. Have some spinach washed 
very clean, put it into a saucepan without any wat«r ; when 
enough, press the liquor from it, and add it to the butter, &z. ; 
stir it well together, taking care that it does not bum in the 
pan : if necessary, add a little water, for the ingredients must 
Btew for a few minutes over the fire to amalgamate properly. 

HARD EGG CURRY. 

378.^ — Slice 2 onions and fiy them in butter, add a table- 
spoonful of curry-powder ; let them stew in a pint of good 
broth till quite tender ; .mix a cup of cream, and thickea 
vith arrowroot or rice-flour. Simmer a few minutes, then 
add 6 or 8 hard-boiled eggs cut into slices ; heat them tho- 
roughly, but do not let tb^ boil-

HIND08TANEE KUWAB FOWL.S. U. 

975. — Rub smooth in a mortar i oz. of coriander-seed, 3 
omons, a drachm of red pepper, the same of pounded ginger, 
and 4 cloves. Put 4 oz. of salt butter on the fire in a stewpan. 
Bub a fowl inside and outside with the pounded ingredients ; 
truss it nicely ; put it into the butter, and fry it a &e brown, 
turning it continually. This is a sort of salamander very ac- 
ceptable to the lovers of fiery dishes : it should be eaten with 
lemon-juice squeezed over it. The butter may be converted 
into sauce ; but at many tables the fowl is served up dry in 
the dish. A small fowl is best for the purpose, it being more 
easily cooked. 

Or : — Skewer upon small silver skewers alternate slices of 
apple, slices of meat, cut into round pieces the same size, and 
halves of onions, so as to have 4 pieces of each, L e, 12 on 
each skewer. To 2 lbs. weight take a drachm of turmeric, 4

sprinkle over, and fry them with the kuwab in a stewpan with 
i lb. of butter. Send up boiled rice in a separate dish.

VEGETABLES. 

376. — The fresher all gnea ve^tablea are used after beings 
taken from the ground the better ; and therefore notJiing can l« 
comparable to cutting them fitini your own gariien ; but, when 
puTfJiased in the market, care should be taken that those of the 
cabbage tribe should appear cris-p and vividly green : not too 
email, nor yet ovei^^irn in size. 

"When about to be used, the outer leaves should be stripped, 
the stalks cut short, and the vegetuble immersed for an hour 
or two in cold water, into which should be put a haadfiil of 
Bait, for the purpose of thoroughly cleansing it from slugs, 
and those insects with which the leaves arecommonlyinfestad. 
All green v^etables should be put into boilii^ water. Kever 
boil any species of greens with meat. BoU tfaem in plenty of 
pure water, with salt, to which a little vinegar may be added 
with advantage ; do not cover the saucepan, but keep up 
a steady fire, so that they shall not be allowed to stop 
boiling until thoroughly done : drun them instantly, for if 
overlioiled they lose their flavour and become insipid ; they 
should be well done, for, if tliat be neglected for the pur- 
pose of preserving their crispness, they will be rendered 
indigestible. 

Hard water spoils the colour of such vegetables as should 
be green, but a very small bit of soda or carbonate of ammonia 
will soflen it, and even improve their brightness. The prac- 
tice of puttii^ pearlask in the pot, to improve their colour, 
should be strictly forbidden, as it imparts an unpleasant flavour ; 
as will also soda if not cautiously used.

POTATOES 

377. — Require no attention for the preservation of their 
colour J but their flavour will be spoiled if their dressing be 
not attended to, which, although of the most simple nature, is 
frequently i4 performed. The best mode of doing it is to sort 
the potatoes, and choose them of an equal size ; wash them 
with a scrubbing-brush, and put them into cold water sufficient 
to cover them, and no more. About 10 minutes after the 
water has come to a boil, take out the half of it, and replace 
with cold water, to check it ; the reason assigned for which is, 
^^ that the cold water sends the heat from the sur&ce to the 
heart, and makes the potatoes mealy." Then throw in a large 
handful of salt, leave the pot uncovered, and let it remain 
upon the fire to simmer until the potatoes are done ; this is the 
moment to be watched, for, if overboiled, they will become 
waxy. The cook should, therefore, occasionally try them, by 
piercing them to the heart with a fork, and, when they are tender, 
the pot should be instantly taken off the fire, and the potatoes 
passed through a colander to drain ; which being done, and 
the water thrown out, they should then be replaced upon a 
folded flannel, in the same pot, which should be left by the side 
of the fire to keep hot and to cause the evaporation of the 
steam. When served, they should be wrapped in a warmed 
cotton napkin. If of moderate size they will take about i an 
hour boiling, to which 15 minutes must be added for evapo- 
ration ere they can be sent to table. 

An iron pot is the best vessel for boiling potatoes in, since, 
after the water has been poured off, it retains sufficient heat to 
dry them thoroughly. 

We here present a new invention for boiling potatoes by 
steam, which appears to possess merit, but we have not tried 
it. The machine may be found at all tin-shops, and goes 
under the name of '^ Palmer's :" a shows the interior, and b the 
entire machine. The potatoes being placed over the boiler, 
the steam from the water passes rapidly through the upper ves- 
sel, and, as it condenses in the cone-shaped cover, passes off 
through an internal tube. 

By this ingenious and simple apparatus potatoes are cooked 
by steam only, thereby extracting and not adding (as is the 
case with all other steamers) to the main cause of the present

A good and economical mode of dressing potatoes, when 
soup, meat, or other eatables, a.n> to be boiled, is to have a. tia 
stminer fitted to the mouth of the saucepan, so as to allow the 
steam lo ascend &om the 
boiler. By which sim- 
ple contrivance a will 
boil the soup i h, when 
fixed in the pot, will 
steam the potatoes ; and 
e, being the lid, will 
cover the whole, having 
a couple of small holes 
left in it to allow the 
steam to escape, in order 
to prevent it from fell- 
ing down upon the pota- 

'**^; , ,„ , J, ., Iron Pot, with Potato Streinar. 

Notwithstanding the 
directions here given for cooking potatoes, there is yet another 
point to which we have not adverted, and on which there 
exists great difference of opinion, that is, respecting the 
peeling of the roots, whether before or afier their beii^ 

In Lancashire, where th^ are largely grown and admirably 
boiled, they are first peeled ; while in Ireland they aie inva* 




320 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVIK. 

riably brought to table ^^ with their jackets on." Count Bom- 
ford also recommends their being boiled in their skins ; the 
cuisinier Bourgeois likewise thinks that ^' lespommes de terre 
sont meilleures en robe de ehambre'* 

The principles on which such opposite opinions are supported 
are these : — The retention of the skin is upheld upon the sup- 
position that, if it be takoi off, the potato will imbibe the water 
and become waxy ; while, on the other hand, it is insisted that 
the potato, if peeled, not only does not imbibe the water in 
which it is boiled, but actually exudes the juice which it con* 
tains, and which is thought to be poisonous. 

On both these points we have made repeated experiments 
to discover any perceptible difference in the appearance of the 
root, which is always equally floury or waxy ; but we think that 
it retains a little more flavour when the skin is not taken off 
before boiling : that is, however, so trifling, that in our own 
practice we always peel them first, as being more cleanly, and 
avoiding the trouble of doing it when dinner is to be served, 
besides exposing the potatoes to become cold. 

TO KEEP POTATOES. 

378. — ^Buy them as dug from the ground, without taking off 

the earth which adheres to them, and never wash them until 

wanted to be dressed. Place them in a dry cellar, upon straw, 

and cover them in winter with straw or mats, to guard them 

from the frost. 

NEW POTATOES 

379. — Should be dressed as soon as possible after being 
taken from the ground, and are always best when grown 
in frames. When washed, they should be rubbed with a 
coarse cloth and a little salt, to take off the thin outer skin, 
but they should not be peeled. Put them into boiling water, 
they will require but a few minutes to do them ; send them 
to table in a hot napkin, unless covered with white sauce, 
which should be seasoned with a little salt and a slight 
grating of nutmeg. When quite young they should never be 
sliced nor fried. 

POTATO-FLOUR. 

380. — Easp the potatoes into a tub of cold water, and 
change it repeatedly until the raspings &I1 to the bottom 
like a paste ; then dry it in the air, pound it in a mortar, 



Chap. XVIH.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 821 

and pass it through a hair sieve. It is nearly as nutritiyOy 
and much lighter, than wiieaten flour ; it is, therefore, prefer- 
able for making puddings and pastry for in&nts and invalids ; 
a portion of it also improves the appearance of household 
bread, and dealers constantly pass it off as arrowroot. If 
kept dry, it will renain good for years. 

POTATO^ELLY 

381. — ^Is made from the flour, only boiling water must be 
poured upon it, but care must be taken that it be absolutdj 
boUing, or the complete change into jelly will not take place. 
It does not take many minutes to thus change a raw potato 
into this substance, which ia not only highly nutritive, but 
extremely agreeable to the palate when flavoured with a little 
sugar, nutm^, and white wine. 

POTATO- WALL, 

382. — Or edging, to serve round fricassees, forms also a 
pretty addition to a comer dish. — Mash in a mortar as many 
boiled potatoes as you may want, with a good piece of butter ; 
then, with the bowls of two silver spoons, raise a wall of it 2^ 
inches high within the rim of the dish to be used. Let the upper 
part be a little thinner than the lower ; smooth it ; and, after 
brushing it all over with egg, put it into the oven to become 
hot and a little coloured. Before egging it, the outside may 
be ornamented with bits of paste cut into shapes. 

TO MASH POTATOES. 

383. — ^Let them be thoroughly boiled, peel them, and take 
out all the specks and little hard lumps which are some- 
times found. Beat them till quite fine in a wooden bowl 
or mortar, or break them thoroughly with a 3-pronged 
fork ; sprinkle a little salt, and mix them up smoothly with 
butter or boiling milk. Take care that the potatoes shall 
not be too wet, or they will become heavy and watery; 
great smoothness, lightness, and a rich taste are required in 
mashed potatoes: if required to be very fine, rub them 
through a colander or sieve before adding the boiling milk 
and butter. 

Or : — As in India : Mash some potatoes, and, having boiled 
1 or 2 onions, chop them small, together with a few capsicuma. 
Mix the whole well together ; put it into a mould, or form it 



822 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVni. 

with a spoon into a handsome shape, and warm it in an oren 
or iqx>n a stove. 

OLD POTATOES TO LOOK LIKE YOUNG ONES. 

384. — ^Wash some large potatoes, and, with a small scoop 
made for the purpose, form as many diminutive ones as will 
fill a dish ; boil them in 2 or 3 waters about 3 minutes each 
time, the water being put to them cold ; then let them steam 
till tender ; pour a white sauce over them, and serve with the 
second course. Old potatoes prepared thus have been mis- 
taken for young ones at the best tables. 

POTATO-LOAVES 

885. — ^Are very nice when eaten with roast beef or mut- 
ton, and are made of any portion of the maahed roots, pre- 
pared without milk, by mixing with them a good quantity of 
very finely minced raw shalot, powdered with pepper and salt ; 
then beating up thiB whole with a little butter to bind it, and 
dividing it into small loaves of a conical form, and placing them 
under uie meat to brown, that is, when it is so nearly done as 
to impart some of the gravy along with the &t. 

TO BROWN POTATOES, 

386. — ^While the meat is roasting, and an hour before it is 
served, boil the potatoes and take off the skins ; flour them 
well, and put them under the meat, taking care to dry them 
from the dripping before they are sent to table. The kidney po- 
tatoes are best dressed in this way. The flouring is very essential. 

PotcUoesj when boiled, if either waxy, or to be eaten with 
Isold meat, should be peeled and put whole upon the gridiron 
until nicely browned. 

Pot€Uoes should always be boiled a little before being put 
into stews, &c., as the first water in which they are cooked 
is of a poisonous quality. 

FHed Potatoes should always be cut from raw potatoes, 
and pared round and round like an apple ; cut them in slices 
i inch thick ; fry quickly, in plenty of hot fat, and with as 
little colour as possible ; dry them well from the grease, and 
sprinkle with salt. When nicely done, and piled up properly, 
fried potatoes make a beautifril side dish, which is always eaten 
with great relish. 



Chap. XVIH.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 323 

Or : — Cut a potato in pieces lengthways the size and shsqpe 
of the divisioBs of an orange, trim them neatly and fiy them ; 
th^ are an excellent garnish for fried fillet of beefl 

Or: — Coid Potatoes may be cut in slices somewhat less 
than i inch thick, and fried in like manner. Some penmis 
also fiy them with onions, as an accompaniment to pork chops, 
sliced cod, red herring, or with a rasher of bacon. 

ROASTED POTATOES 

387. — May be either done in a Dutch oven or put into the 
ashes of a wood fire. They should not be peeled, and require 
a long time : if large, and the fire not very strong, a couple of 
hours will not be too much. They are usually eaten with cold 
butter at supper. 

PetcUo-baUs. — ^Bake the potatoes^ mash them very nicdj, 
make them into balls, rub them over with the yolk of an 
^g, and put them into the oven or before the fire to brown. 
These balls may be varied by the introduction of a third por- 
tion of gprated ham or tongue. 

GREEN PEAS.-^E. R. 

388. — Boil them very fast in plenty of water with the lid 
off the stewpan ; the water should be moderately salted. 
They are imfit for eating when they become hard and yel- 
lowish, but when growing rather old a very small quantity of 
carbonate of ammonia put into the water, with 2 or 3 lumps 
of loaf-sugar, will greatly improve them. The old English 
method of putting a sprig of mint, or a little parsley, is stiU a 
good practice, and ought to be continued unless specially for- 
bidden, or the mint may be chopped and put round the dish. 
A few bits of raw butter should also be put into the peas when 
boiled, and a dust of pepper and salt thrown over them if they 
be completely ripe ; but if quite young, neither butter, salt, nor 
pepper should be added to them, but a teaspoonful of pounded 
white sugar. When growing to maturity the pods are of dif- 
ferent ages, and young and old peas should not be boiled toge- 
ther ; sift them, therefore, from each other, and put the old 
ones into the water some minutes sooner than the young : they 
require from 15 to 20 minutes boiling. 

TO STEW GREEN PEAS. 

389. — Cut a cucumber in slices and brown it in fried butter 
with 2 onions cut very small, to which put 1 quart of v^s^t ^ 



324 MODEBN DOMESTIC COOKEBY. [Chap. XVm. 

little pepper and salt. Let all stew slowly for an hour or more 
wiUiout anj water, Uie stewpan beiiig mandy greased, or a bit 
of butter put in if tbe cacumber should not yield sufficient 
juice: when nearly done, add a teaspoonful of essence of 
ham : keep the pot closely covered while stewing. 

With Mini. — ^Take the hearts of 4 cabbage lettuces, cut 
them small, put them mto a stewpan with 3 pints of young 
green peas and a little gre&i mint chopped ; add pepper 
and salt ; then take a lump of butter the size of an egg, 
and mix it well with the vegetables, taking care not to bruise 
the peas ; then add 2 tablespoonfuls of piunp-water, a bit 
of ham, and a whole onion. Put them on the fire to stew 
until tender; 20 minutes will suffice, shaking the pan con- 
stantly to prevent its burning : when tender, take out the ham 
and onion, and add a piece more butter rolled in flour and i 
pint of cream ; boil all together for 5 minutes, and add a tea- 
spoonful of loaf-sugar pounded. 

TVhen old. — Steep them in water all night, if not fine boil- 
ers ; otherwise only i an hour : put them into water enough 
just to cover them, with a good bit of butter, or a piece 
of beef or pork. Stew them very gently till tbe peas are soft 
and the meat is tender: if it is not salt meat, add salt and a 
little pepper. Serve them round the meat. 

TO PRESERVE PEAS FOR WINTER USE* 

390. — Shell, scald, and dry them as above : put them on tins 
or earthen dishes, in a cool oven, once or twice, to harden. 
Keep them in paper bags hung up in the kitchen. When they 
are to be used, let them lie an hour in water ; then set them 
on with cold water and a bit of butter, and boil them till ready. 
Put a sprig of dried mint to boil with them. 

Mr. Apperfs method. — Have the peas gathered when ripe, 
for if too young they will be watery and not fit to keep. The 
peas, when shelled, should be put into strong jars or open- 
mouthed bottles, and shaken, so as to make them sit closely 
together. This done, the jars must be very tightly corked 
and tied down. The jars are then placed upright in a bain- 
marie, or any iron pot large enough to contain them, with hay 
placed between each, to prevent collision and breakage ; the 
pot is filled with cold water up to the neck of the jars, placed 

' Xg pxBctiMd in the kitchpo of the Emperor of Russia. 



Chap. XVUI.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 325 

upon the fire, and allowed to boil for H hour if in cool moist 
weather, but for 2 hours if it be hot and dry. The jars should 
not be taken out of the pot until the water becomes cold. 

French beans and asparagus may be preserved in the same 
manner ; they maintain their colour, but lose much of their 
flavour, and require a little sugar to improve it. 

BROAD OR WINDSOR BEANS. 

391. — To boil. — Shell them, boil them until tender, with a 
good handful of parsley, then strain them ; put a large piece 
of butter in the middle. Toss the beans by shaking the pan 
upwards, so as to mix the whole well together. Serve with 
parsley and butter in a boat. 

Broad beans may be dressed when young with their skina 
on ; but, if old, they should be blanched, which is done by the 
cook's removing the skin without breaking the beans, and then 
putting them, with a bit of butter, for a %w minutes into the 
stewpan to warm. 

To stew. — ^Take them when too old to dress any other way, 
boil them, and remove the tough outer skin by peeling it off 
after the beans are boiled ; thicken some white broth with a 
little cream or flour and butter, add the beans to it, and stew 
them all together over the fire for a few minutes. Add pep- 
per and salt to palate. 

SPLIT-PEAS PUDDING, 

392. — Take any quantity, say 1 pint, of yellow split peas ;• 
allow them to remain in water the whole night before you 
wish to use them ; after which take them out and put them into 
a cloth so loose as to allow the peas to swell ; boil them for 4 
hours, or until they are quite tender, then rub them through a 
colander, so as to render them perfectly smooth ; add to the 
pulp a lump of butter and some salt. After being well mixed 
put the peas again into a cloth, tie tightly, and boil for about 
i an hour. Pour over it melted butter. 

A richer pudding may be made if 2 well-beaten eggs are 
added along with the butter. It is served with boiled pork. 

CARROTS AND PARSNIPS, 
393. — ^When young, wipe off the skin after they are boiled 

* The meal made of peas and sold by all dealers saves much of the 
trouble of soaking and rendering the peas smooth. 



326 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEBT. [Chap. XVHL 

bj drawing them thnmgh a doth dipped in hot water ; when 
old, KTape them first, and boil them with the salt meat. Th^ 
require to be well done. 

They area ooostant accompaniment to corned beef, and are 
excellent when both are eaten together cold. They fireqnentfy 
also form part of stews and hashes, and make admirable scmb^ 
when boiled down to a puree, in making which it should be 
observed that only the outer or scarlet rind is to be used : the 
inner part should not, howerer, be lost, as it may be cot into 
■mall pieces and stewed. 

To stew Carrots. — ^Half boil, thai nicdy scrape, and slice 
diem into a stewpan. Put to diem i a teacupful of any 
weak broth, some pepper and salt, i a cupful of cream, and a 
saltspoonfnl of powdcnred sugar : simmer diem till they are veiy 
tender, but not broken. Before serving, rub a very litde 
flour with a bit of butter, and warm up widi diem. If 
approved, chopped parsley may be added 10 minutes before 
serving. 

Carrots a la mdUre d^hdteL — ^Boil die carrots tender. Put 
a lump of butter into die bottom of a stewpan with a litde 
flour ; when it is browned, add a little gravy : then put in the 
carrots, and let them stew gently till served. 

Carottes au Sucre may be also made as an entremet 
thus: — Slice them small, and put them into a stewpan, in 
only water enough to cover them, with the peel of a lemon 
and about half their own weight of sugar. Let this stew 
until the syrup is reduced to thickness ; then add the juice 
of the lemon, with a tablespoonful or two of white wine, and 
serve. 

To mash Parsnips, — ^Boil them tender ; scrape, then mash 
them into a stewpan with a little cream, a good piece of 
butter, pepper and salt. 

To fricassee Parsnips, — ^Boil in milk till they are soft ; then 
cut them lengthwise into bits 2 or 3 inches long, and simmer 
in a white sauce, made of 2 s|M)onful8 of broth, a bit of mace, 
i a cupftil of cream, a bit of butter, and some flour, pepper, 
and salt. 

TURNIPS 

394. — Should always be boiled whole, and put in much after 
either carrots or parsnips, as they require less boiling. When 



Ghaf. XVnL] VEGETABLES AJH) SALADS. 827 

used in stews, they are, however, afterwards cut into small 
pieces of the sue of dice, or made into shapes with a little in- 
strument to be found at all cutlery shops. 

They may be muuked in the same manner aa paisiupa; but 
some persoQsadd the yolk of a raw oggor two. Th^are abo 
frequently made into a pur^ to thicken mutton broth. 

When qmU young they should be served up whole, and 
most generally covered with white sauce ; but in France they 
are very commonly fried, and made an accompaniment to roast 
ducks, around which they are placed in the dish ; and, if not 
young, the old ones are cut Into that shape. 

TURNIF'TOPS, 

395. — ^When cut fresh, are frequently used as greeny, and 
preferred by many, as they contain a pleasant d^pree of bitt^. 
They should be nicely trimmed, carefully washed, and boiled 
in hot water, but not too much. 

BEET-ROOTH 

396. — Make a very pleasant addition to winter salad, of 
which they may agreeably form a frill half, instead of being 
only used to ornament it. They are indeed excellent when 
used quite alone, being left until cold, after having been 
boiled ; then slicing them, and eating them with oil and vine- 
gar, though if celery be added it will be found an improve- 
ment. Great care must be taken in boiling beet-root that no 
part of the skin is broken, as, if it is, the colour will all be 
extracted. A wineglassful of vinegar and a little salt should 
be added to the water. It takes about the same time to bolL 
as a carrot of the same size. 

Stewed, — ^Boil the beet slowly, with the skin on, until tender. 
They will take at least an hour's boiling, but must not be tried 
by the fork, as the juice should not be allowed to run out. Take 
the skin off, then cut in slices i inch thick, put them into a 
stewpan with a little broth and a spoonful of vinegar, and 
simmer till the gravy is tinged with the colour ; then put it 
into a small dish, and make a round of the button-onions, first 
boiled till tender. The flavour is richer and the colour finer 
when baked than when boiled. 

Or : — Bake it in an oven until it is quite tender, and, 
when cold, scrape off the outside coat, cut it in sliceSf and ^ 



328 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVIIL 

pour a little vinegar over it ; then put it into a stewpan, and 
cover it with gravy ; stew gently for i an hour, and before 
serving thicken the gravy with a little cream. The sauce 
should be of a fine red colour; and perhaps it would be 
advisable to pound one or two slices in a mortar, to extract the' 
juice. 

CABBAGES 

397. — ^Are of various sorts and differently dressed, but the 
most common mode is plainly boiled. If the cabbage be large 
and old, or strong-flavoured, it will take an hour to boil. It 
should be boiled in 2 waters, removing the first when the cab- 
bage is half done, and replacing it with an equal quantity 
boiling hot. The water should also be frequently skimmed. 
All green vegetables are best boiled uncovered. 

Sprotits^ or Greefis, will be done in 15 to 20 minutes, but 
do not require skimming. 

Brussels Sprouts are a small species of cabbage, not larger 
than a walnut, and growing upon a tall single stalk. They are 
boiled in a few minutes, and may be served up either plain or 
covered with white sauce. 

Buttered Cabbage, — Boil the cabbage with a quantity of 
onions, then chop them together, season with pepper and salt, 
and fry them in butter. It is a rather homely but savour}' dish, 
and frequently used either with fried sausages laid over it or 
as an accompaniment to roast beef, and forms part of bubble 
and squeak. For Bed Cahlxige^ see Pickles. 

To stew, — ^Boil a large cabbage, press it dry in a cloth, 
then cut it very finely, adding pepper and salt, and a few 
chives or green onions, also boiled separately and well chopped ; 
put a lump of butter into a stewpan, let it melt, add the cab- 
bage, and warm it together, stirring all the time; add a 
spoonful of gravy, and 1 of lemon-pickle, or the juice of i a 
lemon ; let it stew for a few minutes, and then serve it. 

OF LETTUCE 

398. — ^There are 2 sorts, the cabbage and the coss^ both used 
in salads. 

JFarcie a la Frangaise, — Having cleaned the lettuces, tie 
them separately with a string, and boil them. Leave them 
to drain and cool ; then open the leaves and lay in farce oi^ 



Chap. XVm.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 329 

forcemeat between each leaf; tie them up carefully, and stew 
them gently in a braise made of thin slices of bacon, a carrot, 
an onion, a small bunch of sweet herbs, and a little good gravy. 
Skim the gravy, strain it, add a glass of white wine, reduce it, 
and let it be served quite hot. 

Or: — Take lettuces prepared as above, drain them tho- 
roughly, dip tiiem in beaten e^ and bread-crumbs, or make a 
batter the same as for thick pancakes, adding a glass of brandy ; 
allow it to remain 4 hours before it is wanted, then dip in the 
lettuces and fry them in lard. 

ONIONS, 

399. — ^Though all of the same species, are yet widely different 
in flavour, the Spanish being very ndld and the English very 
pungent ; but their taste may be much diminished by boiling 
them in 2 or 3 separate waters. In buying the farmer, always 
choose the larger sort, as having been prdinbly grown in the 
south of Spain or Portugal, where the finest sort are produced. 

To stew. — Peel, flour, and fry them gently of a fine brown, 
but do not blacken them ; then put them into a small stew- 
pan, with a little gravy, pepper, and salt; cover and stew 
gently for 2 hours. 

Moast Onions should be done with all the skins on, and par- 
boiled before being put before the fire. They eat well alone, 
with only salt and cold butter, or with roast potatoes, and are 
better large than small. Though called ^' roast," the best way 
is to put them in a Dutch oven and turn them occasionally, so 
as to brown them equally. The half-grown, or smaller sort, 
are frequently dressed in this way, and served with roast mut- 
ton ; and in France they are very commonly put round a dish 
of roast fowl. 

Young Onions are generally eaten raw ; but chives, seal' 
lions, and shalot are mostly used for salads, or various modes 
of seasoning and pickles. 

Of all these condiments, garlic has the highest flavour, and 
if delicately used imparts a fine savour to various sorts of 
soups and sauces ; or if a clove of it be put into the shank of 
a leg or shoulder of mutton to be roasted, it will much im- 
prove its flavour. It is an excellent tonic, and is exten- 
sively used by the best cooks throughout the south of Euro] 
but in England a prejudice prevails against it, in conaeo^

either of the strength of its odour, or more probably of the 
coarseness with which our cooks employ it. 

LEEKS 

400. — Are generally looked upon as a species of onion, and, 
as such, commonly employed in the same manner, though 
rather milder in flavour. If boiled in separate waters, changing 
it 3 or 4 times, until stewed quite tender, then served in 
white sauce, or quartered and placed upon toast like aspara- 
gus, they will eat nearly, if not quite, as delicate. 

SFINACff, 

401. — Wash it well in diiferent waters, pick off the decayed 
leaves, and boil it quickly in a lai^ quantity of water and 
salt for 1 of an hour ; when done, squeeze it very dry, ch(^ 
it, put in the dish, and pour melted butter over it ; season it 
with pepper and salt 

Or : — Boil it in as small a quantity of water as will prevent 
its burning to the pan ; then strain and press it well ; put it 
into a saucepan with a tablespoonful of gravy, a little pepper 
and salt, and a few drops of chili vinegar; stew it for 5 
minutes, chopping it all the time. The spinach may be boiled 
the day before, and is better for being so. 

Stewed with Cream, — Boil the spinach as before directed, 
chop it very fine, and beat it well with a spoon, taking care 
to have picked out all the fibres ; put it into a stewpan with 
a piece of butter, some pepper and salt, a little nutmeg, and a 
very small quantity of pounded sugar ; stir it well as it stews, 
sulding by degrees as much cream as will make it the proper 
thickness. Garnish with fried paste. 

A la Fran^aise. — Wash the spinach, and pick it very care- 
fully, then put it into boiling water, and when sufficiently tender 
to bear squeezing strain it in a colander ; then throw it into cold 
water to preserve the colour. When it is quite cold, squeeze 
it in a towel, not in any large quantity at a time. Take out the 
stems, chop the spinach very fine, and then put it into a stew- 
pan with a piece of butter and some very rich gravy ; add 
pepper, salt, and a little mace or nutmeg, and boil it rather 
fast, stirring it all the time ; the thickness will depend upon the 
quantity of the sauce. It is also very generally dressed with 
cream and a little white sugar, as an entremet of g^eat 
delicacy. 



Chap. XVIH.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 881 

It may be thus used alone, or with sippets, frequently vith 
frioandeaux. A very pretty mode of serving it is to place it 
in the centre of a small dish, with fried lamb chops arwmd it, 
standing on end with the long bones meeting together. 

GOURDS AND POMP IONS. 

402. — The tops of all the edible species, boiled as greens or 
spinach, are a more delicate vegetable than the fruit. 

SEA-KALE 

403. — Is the earliest of our spring vegetables, coming into 
season a month or two befi>re asparagus. It is extremely 
delicate, either plainly boiled as an accompaniment to house- 
lamb and white poultry, or served alone with white sauce, 
though a frequent mode is to bring it to table on toast, in the 
same way as asparagus : it takes the same time to boil — about 
20 minutes. Trim the ends like celery, brush out the dust, 
tie up in bundles, boil for 2(d or 25 minutes, lay the tqps upon 
toast, and pour melted butter ov^ it. 

ASPARAGUS. 

404. — Scrape the buds, and cut the white stalk off about 6 
inches from the head ; throw them into cold water, and after 
soaking tie them in small bundles, and boil them rather quickly. 
If overdone, the heads will be broken. Toast a slice of bread 
very brown on both sides ; and when the asparagus is done, 
take it very carefully up, dip the toast quickly in the water, 
and lay the heads upon it, leaving the white ends outwards 
each way, and pour melted butter over the toast and green 
parts. 

To Fricdssee, — Scrape the asparagus clean, and, having 
steeped it in cold water, cut off the eatable portion. To 50 heads 
add 1 head of endive, a young lettuce, and a few chives, all 3 
chopped ; put them into a stewpan with 2 oz. of butter ; shake 
the pan while the butter is melting, and then dredge in a little 
flour, and season with pepper and salt ; continue to shake the 
pan, and pour in a cupful of gravy ; stew the whole until the 
sauce is very rich and thick, and then serve it up. 

Farcis, — Cut a piece out of the top of 3 French rolls, take 
out all the crumb, do not enlarge the opening, or the crust will 
not exactly fit again. Fry the rolls brown, in fresh butter \ 



332 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVIir. 

have ready a pint of cream, the yolks of 6 eggs well beaten, a 
little salt and nutmeg. Stir this mixture over a slow fire until 
it thickens. Boil a hundred of small asparagus ; save tops enough 
to stick the tops of the rolls with, cut the remainder of the green 
part of the grass small : put it into the cream, and fill the rolls 
with it hot. Before the rolls are fried, make a few holes in 
the pieces of crust cut off, and stick the tops in. 

This is for a side-dish in a second course. 

In France asparagus is often eaten cold, as salad, with oil 
and vinegar. 

In the hop districts of England, the buds, and so much of 
the stalk or bine of the plant as » will break off short, are 
boiled and served up precisely as asparagus. 

In buying asparagus, the length of the green heads should 
be more looked to than their thickness, 

ARTICHOKES. 

405. — Cut the stalk even, trim off a few of the outside leaves 
and the points of the others. If young, i an hour will boil 
them. Serve them with melted butter in as many small cups 
as there are artichokes, to help with each. 

Or : — Cut the artichokes in 4, remove the choke, trim the 
pieces neatly, boil them quickly in salt water, dish them, lay- 
ing the leaves outwards, and pour melted butter or white 
sauce over the bottoms. 

Stewed, — Strip off the leaves, remove the choke, and soak 
them in warm water for 2 or 3 hours, changing the water every 
hour ; then put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter 
rolled in cayenne pepper and flour; a teacupful of gravy, 
and a spoonful or two of ketchup or other sauce ; add a spoon- 
ful of vinegar, or one of lemon-juice, before serving ; let all 
stew till the artichokes are quite tender, and, if necessary, 
thicken the sauce with a little more butter. 

Artichoke bottoms, if dried, must be soaked, then stewed in 
weak gravy, or baked and served with or without forcemeat 
in each. Or they may be boiled in milk, and served with 
cream-sauce ; or added to ragoiits, French pies, &c. 

They may also be dipped in batter and fried, then served 
with a sauce made of fine herbs, a spoonful of oil, and the 
juice of lemon. 

A la Poivrade, — ^Take very small artichokes, cut them in 



Chap. XYm.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 333 

quarters from the bottom, and remoYe the chdke. Serve them 
in a little cold water, like radishes ; make a sauce vith oil, 
vinegar, pepper, and salt : they have the flavour of nuts. 

Artichauts farcis. — Parboil the artichokes, remove die 
middle leaves, pare the choke, and stufi^ the centre with force- 
meat; then put them into the oven until the meat is quite 
done. Serve up with melted butter. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES 

406. — Should be boiled, putting them at first into cold water, 
and must be taken up the moment they are done, or they will 
be too soft. 

They may be boiled plain, or served with white fricassee- 
sauce. When boiled, if rubbed through a sieve with a little 
fresh butter and cream, they form an excellent pur^e as a sauce 
for cutlets, or as a thickening for some sorts of white soup ; or 
they may be sliced and fried. 

CUCUMRERS. 

407. — Stewed. — Peel them, slice them thick, or halve and 
divide them into 2 lengths ; strew some salt and pepper, and 
sliced onions ; add a little broth, or a bit of butter ; simmer 
very slowly ; and before serving, if no butter was in before, put 
some, and a little flour ; or if there was butter in, only a little 
flour, unless it wants richness. 

Or : — Slice the onions and cut the cucumbers large ; flour 
them, and fry them in some butter ; then pour on some good 
broth or gravy, and stew them till done enough. 

Farcis. — Take full-grown cucumbers, peel them, divide 
them lengthwise, remove the seeds, and replace them with any 
sort of forcemeat, seasoned with a few drops of chili vinegar ; 
then tie them together with thread ; dip &em in batter, and 
fry them. 

In Russia, cucumbers are preserved throughout the winter 
by being merely salted ; and tliey are commonly eaten raw, as 
in England, but without vinegar, and unpeeled. 

VEGETABLE MARROW— E. R. 

408. — May be dressed in a variety of ways — plain-boiled, 
cut in slices, and served upon toast, with melted butter ; or 
stewed in a good gravy ; or boiled and mashed in the same 



334 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVni. 

manner as turnips ; and if made rattier thinner, with a little 
cream or fine white sauce, formed into a puree, to thicken soi:qp. 
These purees, it must be remari^ed, should not, when made of 
the marrow or any other vegetable, be served up alone, but 
put into the middle of a dish, with chops or fried poultry of some 
kind, as they properly come under the denomination of sauce. 

To boil. — The smallest are consida^ the best, but when 
they are about 6 or 6 inches long the fruit is more mature, 
better flavoured, and the flesh whiter. Put them into hot 
water with a little salt ; boil them gently till quite tender, 
and serve them, either whole or pared and halved, on a slice of 
bread toasted, with plain melted butter in a boat ; or when 
cold they may be pared and sliced, then dipped in a batter 
made with an egg, a teacupful of water or milk beaten together, 
a little salt, and about ^ lb. of flour, or sufficient to make the 
batter thick enough to adhere to the slices ; or they may be 
brushed over with egg, and covered with fine bread-crumbeiy 
and then fried. Arrange them neatly on a dish, and serve 
with melted butter. 

Stewed, — Pare ofl* the outer skin ; cut the gourd into slices 
and then into dice, taking out the seeds. Scrape a little fiit 
bacon, which put into a stewpan with a small onion or two, and 
a little parsley chopped fine. Cover the stewpan close, and 
fry gently from 5 to 10 minutes ; then thicken with a spoonful 
of flour, and add a little veal broth to make the sauce the 
consistence of rich cream. Season with pepper and salt, re- 
place the cover, and stew gently until quite tender. A mush- 
room chopped small may be added. « 

TO 8TEW CELERY. 

409. — ^Wash the heads, and strip off" their outer leaves ; either 
halve or leave them whole, according to their size, and cut 
them into lengths of 4 inches. Put them into a stewpan 
with a cup of broth or weak white gravy ; stew till tender ; 
then add 2 spoonfuls of cream, a little flour and butter, seasoned 
with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a little pounded white sugar ; 
and simmer all together. 

Or ; — Parboil it, cut it into quarters, fry it, and serve it 
on a napkin, or with beef gravy. 

Celery is a g^eat improvement to all soups and gravies, and 
much used as a white sauce, either alone or with oysters. 



Chap. XVm.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 38« 

TO BOIL CAULIFLOWERS. 

410. — Choose those that ai^ dose and white, out off the 
Ipreeti leaves, and look carefully that theire are no caterpillara 
about the stalk ; soak an hour in cold water, with a handful 
of salt in it ; then boil them in milk and water, and take cart 
to skim the saucepan, that not the least foulness may j&ll on 
the flower. It must be served very white, and rather crimp. 

In White Sauce. — ^Take off the whole of the leaves of a 
cauliflower, and half boil it ; then cut it into handsome pieces, 
and lay .them in a stewpan with a little broth, a bit of mace, a 
little salt, and a dust of white pepper ; simmer ^ an hour, but 
let the stalk be put down ^ of an hour before the flower ; then 
put a little cream, butter, and flour; shake, and simmer a 
few minutes, and serve. 

With Parmesan. — ^Boil a cauliflower ; drain it on a sieve, 
and cut it into convenient sized pieces ; arrange these pieces 
in a pudding basin so as to make them resemUe a cauliflower 
when turned on the dish : season it as you proceed ; turn it 
on the dish, then cover it with a sauce made of grated parme- 
san cheese, butter, and the yolks of a couple of eggs, seascmed 
with lemon-juice, pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; and put parmesan 
grated over it. Bake for 20 minutes and brown it. 

Or : — Boil sprigs of cauliflower in butter and water to make 
them white, until they are tender ; then grate i lb. of parmesan 
cheese ; put nearly i into a stewpan with i lb. of butter, a 
little white pepper, and 2 spoonfuls of milk ; toss it until the 
cheese is well mixed, then warm the cauliflower in it, and 
serve it up with the. remainder of the cheese strewed over the 
top. 

BROCOLI 

411. — Is dressed in nearly the same manner ; cut the heads 
with short stalks, and pare the tough skin ofl' them ; tie the 
small shoots into bunches, and boil them a shorter time than 
the heads. Some salt must be put into the water. Serve 
with or without toast. 

Poached eggs eat well with brocoli. 

BROCOLI AND BUTTERED EGGS, 

412. — ^Keep a handsome bunch for the middle, and have 8 
pieces to go round ; toast a piece of bread to fit the inner part 



336 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVm. 

of the dish or plate ; boil the brocoli. In the mean time have 
ready 6 (or more) eggs beaten ; put, for 6, i lb. of fine butter 
into a saucepan, with a little salt ; stir it over the fire, and, as 
it becomes warm, add the ^gs, and shake the saucepan till the 
mixture is thick enough. Pour it on the hot toast, and lay the 
brocoli in the dish. 

FRENCH BEANS, 

413. — Cut off the ends and stalks ; divide in half, or shred 
them, according to fancy ; lay them in salt and water, and, 
when the saucepan boils, put them in with some salt. As soon 
as they are done, serve them immediately, to preserve the 
green colour. 

Or : — When half done, drain the water off, put them into 
2 spoonfuls of broth strained, and add a little cream, butter, 
and flour, to finish doing them. 

Scarlet Runners, though less delicate, are by many pre- 
ferred to French beans. They are boiled in the same man- 
ner for i of an hour or 20 minutes ; and when tender, a good 
homely way of preparing them for the table is to place them 
for some short time in the dripping-pan under any meat that 
is roasting ; add pepper and salt ; or, when boiled, mince and 
stew them in beef gravy. 

To boil, or rather simmer, as gently as possible, the seed of 
the dwarf scarlet runner, — Boil in soft water, for, should the 
water be hard, they will take 4 hours ; and unless they are 
stewed gently, they will break and be spoiled. Put an onion 
shred fine into a stewpan, with a piece of butter rolled in 
flour ; let it stew until tender, then add the beans to it, with a 
little hot water ; stir it until it simmers together for a few 
minutes ; then add a little salt, a tea or dessert spoonful of 
vinegar, a few chives or a shalot minced fine, and a sufiicient 
quantity of parsley to give it a green colour. Serve up*the 
beans very hot, either in a covered dish or under roast mutton. 

MUSHROOMS, 

414. — Cooks should be perfectly acquainted with the dif- 
ferent sorts of things called by this name by ignorant people, 
as the death of many persons has been occasioned by care- 
lessly using the poisonous kinds. 

The eatable mushrooms at first appear very small and of a 
round form, on a little stalk. They grow very fast, and the 



Chap. XVm.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 387 

upper part and stalk are white. As the size increases, the 
under part gradually opens, and shows a fringed fur of a very 
fine sahnon colour, which continues more or less till the mush- 
room has gained some size, and then turns to a dark brown. 
These marks should be attended to, and likewise whether the 
skin can be easily parted from the edges and middle. Those 
that have a white or yellow fur should be carefully avoided, 
though many of them have the same smell, but not so strong, 
as the right sort. 

7b slew, — ^The large buttons are best for this purpose, and 
the small flaps while the fur is still red. Rub the buttons 
with salt and a bit of flannel; cut out the fur, and take 
off the skin from the others ; put them into a stewpan with a 
little lemon-juice, pepper, salt, and a small piece of fresh but- 
ter, and let the whole sinmier slowly till done ; then put a 
small bit of butter and flour, with 2 spoonfuls of cream ; giye 
them one boil, and serve with sippets of bread. 

Tojricassee. — ^Peel the mushrooms, which should be large, 
and broil them on a gridiron. When the outside is brown, put 
them into a stewpan with a little milk ; when they have stewed 
10 minutes, add a spoonful of white wine and the same of 
browning ; thicken it with butter and flour, and serve it up 
garnished with sippets. 

To broil. — The largest are the best. Have a clear cinder 
fire; make the gridiron hot, and rub the bars with suet to 
prevent the mushrooms from sticking ; place them also on the 
gridiron with their stalks upwards ; sprinkle them slightly with 
salt and a good shake of pepper, and serve them on a hot dish, 
with a little cold butter under and over them. When they 
begin to steam they are sufficiently done. 

To make a Pur^ of Mushrooms, — Cut off the stems, but 
retain the heads and cleanse them. Put a little water into 
a stewpan, and squeeze into it the juice of a lemon ; put in the 
heads and drain them ; mince them as fine as possible ; put a 
piece of butter into a stewpan ; squeeze the juice of a lemon, 
and add to it the minced mushrooms. Keep it on the fire 
until the butter is melted ; then add 6 spoonfuls of strong 
gravy, and the same of thick white sauce ; reduce it until the 
pur^ is sufficiently thick ; add a little pepper, and serve it 
up ; or keep it for flavouring sauces, which it will greatly 
improve. 



338 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVm. 

Having thus disposed of the hecuis^ then take the stenu for 
buttered mushrooms, or champignons au beurre. Rub them 
with a little salt to clean them, and rinse them in salt water ; 
after which, dry them with a cloth, and have ready about 
2 oz. of fresh butter to every pint of stems. Put the butter 
into a stewpan over a cinder fire, until it begins to brown ; 
then throw in the stems, and keep the pan on the fire for 
a few minutes until they become tender, continuing to shake 
them all the time, to prevent them from burning, and the 
butter from becoming oiled. Pile them in a small dish, 
and serve them in their own gravy, than which nothing can 
be finer. 

Some cooks flavour it with mace, and others, still more in- 
judiciously, with cayenne, either of which utterly spoils it. 

TRUFFLES, 

415. — Although enumerated among vegetables, are yet not 
known to be capable of cultivation, but are found under ground 
by pigs and dogs trained for the purpose. When sold in the 
shops they are of different qualities — ^the white^ the red, and 
the black — and are, therefore, generally thought to be of dif- 
ferent species ; but the difference arises from the period of their 
ripeness, as they are always dug up the moment they are found, 
and the black, being the most mature, always bear the highest 
price. Their chief use is, along with morels, to add a high 
flavour to sauces, &rces, and pies, as i oz. simmered in a pint 
of gravy will greatly improve them. They are also frequently 
employed to stuff* poultry. 

Stewed, — ^Wash and brush clean the truffles, put them in a 
stewpan with a little wine, a slice or two of fat bacon, and a 
little good broth; let them boil gently imtil quite tender; 
then serve them in a napkin dry, as you would roasted chest- 
nuts. 

FRIED HERBS (as m Stqfforcbhire), 

416. — Clean and dry a good quantity of spinach-leaves, 2 
.large handfuls of parsley, and a handful of green onions. Chop 

the parsley and onions, and sprinkle them among the spinach. 

Set them all on to stew, with some salt, and a bit of butter the 

size of a walnut : shake the pan when it begins to grow warm, 
. and let it be closely covered oyer a close stove till done enough. 
-It is served with slices of broiled calf's liver, small rashers of 

bacon, and eggs fried ; the latter on the herbs, the other in a 
^pamfp dish. 



Chap. XVm.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 339 

POTATOES A LA MAtTRE nHOTEL.—E, R, 

417. — Boil and peel the potatoes ; let them grow nearly 
cold ; then cut them into slices tolerably thick, and warm them 
up in white sauce, or melted butter, with parsley chopped ; 
put into it a little white pepper and salt, and the juice of i a 
lemon. 

Or : — Boil the potatoes, and let them become cold, then cut 
them into rather thick slices. Put a lump of fresh butter into 
a stewpan, add a little flour, about a teaspoonful for a mode- 
rate-sized dish ; when the flour has boiled a short time in th^ 
butter add a cupful of water and a little cream ; boil all toge- 
ther, then put in the potatoes covered with chopped parsley, 
pepper, and salt ; stew them for a few minutes, and then take 
them from the fire: add a little lemon-juice, and send to table. 

PUREE OF PO TA TOES, 

418. — Mash the potatoes, and mix them while quite hot with 
some fine white gravy drawn from veal, together with butter 
and cream. The piu*ee should be rather thin, and seasoned 
with salt, a very little pepper, and an atom of nutmeg. 

POTATO OMELETTE 

419. — May be made with a mashed potato or 2 oz, of potato- 
flour and 4 eggs, and seasoned with pepper, salt, and a little 
nutmeg. It should be made thick, and, being rather sub- 
stantial, a squeeze of lemon will improve it. Fry a light 
brown. 

POMMES BE TERRE FARCIES. 

420. — Bake the potatoes ; and, when nearly done, cut off* a 
circular piece from the upper part, and scoop out a portion of 
the pulp, leaving about an inch of thickness under the peel. 
Then have ready any well-minced fricassee or forcemeat you 
please, butter the inside of the potato, and till up the cavity 
with the mince heaped to a round, touch it over with raw yolk 
of eg^^ and put the potatoes again in the Dutch oven, or brown 
them with a salamander. The skins should be rubbed with 
butter to render them crisp, or they will probably have become 
too hard to be peeled without breaking the potatoeti, but if not, 
a portion of it should be cut ofi*.

340 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVm. 

HARICOTS BLANCS—E, R. 

421. — ^Are the seeds of the white French bean. Though 
but little known in England, they are a very common dish 
tliroughout France, where they are generally stewed and 
served with white sauce. They come to us in a dried state, 
and therefore are capable of keeping for 12 months, beyond 
which time it is not desirable to keep them, as they then re- 
quire so much soaking that the flavour is destroyed. Th^ 
always require a few hours' soaking before being dressed ; the 
usual mode in this country is to put them into cold water, boil 
them for an hour, and bring them up in plain white sauce, sea- 
soned with pepper and salt, or sometimes with chopped parsl^ 
and a few g^ns of sugar. 

A V Hollandaise, — Pick and well clean the haricots; put 
them into a pot with cold soft water and a bit of butter. 
While on the fire, add cold water to soflen and prevent their 
boiling. When well softened, drain them ; put them into a 
saucepan with a bit of butter and some boiled and strained 
onions cut in dice, a little highly-seasoned gravy-soup, salt, 
and coarse pepper. Shake them well, and finish with a little 
more butter. 

Spanish receipt for Haricots JBlancs, or Garbanzas, — 
Pour hot water on the beans, and soak them for 24 hours ; then 
boil them with some lettuce or parsley, and a little ham, till 
they are tender. Then fry some chopped onions and a little 
bit of garlic, and put them in a pot. A few minutes befo^ 
they are wanted pound some toasted bread with some of the 
beans ; then mix them with an egg^ add spice, and pour them 
into the pot ; warm and send them up to table. 

TO DRESS CHESTNUTS FOR DESSERT. 

422. — Let them be well roasted, and the husks taken off. 
Dissolve i lb. of sugar in a wineglassful of water, and the 
juice of a lemon. Put this and the chestnuts into a saucepan 
over a slow fire for 10 minutes ; add sufficient orange-flower 
water to flavour the syrup ; serve in a deep dish, and grate 
sugar over them. To be handed round whilst quite hot. 

TO DRESS CARDOONS, OR CHARDONS. 

423. — Cut them into pieces of 6 inches long, scrape them as 
asparagus, tie them in bundles, boil till tender, and have ready 



Chap. XVni.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 341 

a piece of butter in a pan ; flour, fry them brown, and serve 
in a rich brown sauce. 

Or : — Boil in salt and water, dry, then dip them into batter, 
and fry them. Serve with melted butter. 

Or : — Parboil, and then stew in brown or white gravy ; add 
cayenne, lemon-juice, and salt. ThickeA with a bit of butter 
and flour, have a marrow-bone boiled, cut the marrow in slices, 
and strew over the top of the chardons. 

8AL8IFIS, SKIJIRETS, AND SCORZANERA, 

424. — Are not much known in England, though all good, 
and deserving of more general cultivation. The salsifis are 
white, and not unlike small parsnips, and ripen the first year, 
whilst scorzanera is black, and requires 2 years in coming to 
perfection ; but it is preferable of the two. In flavour they 
somewhat resemble Jerusalem artichokes. They are much 
cultivated in France, and appear in the markets as a very late 
winter or early spring vegetable. 

Scrape them and throw them into water with a little 
lemon-juice squeezed into it to keep them white; boil in 
milk-and-water ; serve with melted butter or white sauce ; or 
stew them in rich brown gravy ; or, when boiled tender, dip in 
batter and fry quite crisp. 

TOM A TA, 

425. — Or " love-apple," is now coming very generally, and 
deservedly, into use, either pickled, made into ketchup, or 
served alone. 

There are two species of tomatas at present cultivated in 
this country, the red and the yellow. 

The time of their ripening is from the middle of August to 
October, or until the frost sets in, which mostly destroys them. 
The large red are much esteemed for stewing or eating, though 
for pickling and preserving the smaller varieties are by some 
considered preferable. 

They make an excellent puree, and may be either stewed, 
or roasted in a Dutch oven for i of an hour, and form a good 
accompaniment to any roast meat, as they contain a very deli- 
cate flavour of acidity. 

A few tomatas, when simply stewed in a little gravy, sea^ 
soned only with salt, or mixed with a little celery, form a very 
pleasant vegetable dish ; and if not very small, 3 or 4 will be 
suflficient for a moderate party.

bread, and form a finrcemeat baD, with beaten eggs ; fill up the 
centres of the tomatas, and let them stew gendj in any gravy ; 
before serving up, pass them over with a salamander or hot 
iron. 

A ^voorite mode of dressing them in Portugal, where they 
are largely grown, is, to stew them along with rice and oniims 
in strong brown gravy ; the rice forming the greater portion 
of the dish. There are also various other ways employed 
throughout the Continent, but garlic should never be ad(kd, 
aa it destroys the delicacy of the tomata. 

SAVER KRAUT, 

426. — Or Sour-crotU^ as it is called in this country, is a Ger- 
man preparation of cabbage, fermented in layers, between which 
salt is laid, and the whole pressed closely down with weights 
for a few days, at the end of which it becomes acid, and the 
greater part of the juice is drawn off.» , 

* In preparing it, the ontward leaves and the stalk are removed, the latter 
being sliced, and the whole cabbage cut into small pieces, which are pressed 
heavily down, and placed in barrels in a warm cellar mitil the fermentation 
if over : when that is complete, put the kraut into a cool place, and it will 
remain good for yean. Some people think it improved hj a mixture among 
the layers of carraway, whole pepper, and juniper-berries, or the barrels 
smoked iritb the latter. 



Chap. XVinj VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 343 

It IS extensively used throughout the northern parts of 
Europe, as a pleasant vegetable, particularly with salted meats 
and sausages ; and is considered so excellent an antiscorbutic 
that it is largely employed in our navy. It requires nothing 
but care in &e making ; and, when properly prepared, may 
be served at any gentleman's table. Boil it for 2 hours, and 
skim the water ; or change the water for gravy, and stew it. 

CHICOREE, OR ENDIVE, an Vehmte.—E. R. 

427. — Take off the exterior of the endive, leaving nothing 
but the white ; let it lie in water to soak ; have it thoroughly 
washed ; then throw a handful of salt into a kettle of boiling 
water, keeping the endive under the water to prevent its turn- 
ing black ; when it will mix with the water it is blanched ; try 
with the finger if it be tender, and, if so, drain it on a sieve, 
and put it in cold spring water ; when perfectly cold, strain it 
again, and squeeze it quite dry. Chop it, put a good piece of 
butter in a stewpan with the endive, a little salt and pepper ; 
put in scMne velouie, that is, rich white sauce, or veal stock that 
will jelly ; let it reduce till it becomes thick ; send it up with 
croutons, i.e, fried paste, round. 

SORREL 

428. — ^Forms an excellent accompaniment for young meat, 
or for anything the flavour of which is improved by its acidity, 
and is used very commonly in France, both as sauce and as a 
separate dish, prepared with cream in the same manner as 
spinach. 

Or : — ^Take any quantity of the leaves, washed clean, boil 
them tender in water, and pass them throu^ a tamis; put 
them into a stewpan with a slice of fresh butter and a few 
spoonfuls ofveloute; add salt and a little sugar. 

There are two sorts of the plant, the French and English ; 
the former bearing a small round leaf, and the latter much 
longer, as well as duller in colour : the French is much the 
best. 

VEGETABLE RAGO&T.—E. R, 

429. — Cut cold potatoes, carrots, turnips, cabbage, onions, 
and any other vegetables at hand into slices ; put them into a 
stewpan, with pepper and salt, a little broth, and a piece of 
butter, and stir them together with a spoon until they are quii 




344 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVm. 

hot. In India a portion of the vegetables is taken from each 
dish, chopped up while hot with pepper and salt, and put into 
a silver saucepan, with a piece of butter; and, when weU 
heated over a lamp, sent round the table. 

A VEGETABLE OLIO. 

430. — ^Boil 3 heads of small, close cabbage, carrots, turnips, 
potatoes, and small onions ; drain them from the water, and 
cut them in pieces. Mix all with 2 handfuls of spinach- 
leaves, 2 oz. of butter, 3 spoonfuls of cream, a little salt and 
pepper, and stew them as closely covered as possible 2 hours ; 
then stir in a bit of butter rolled in tiour, over a clear fire. 

In siunmer, peas, cucumbers, spinach, celery, lettuces, and 
young onions may be dressed the same way. 

BREDIC OF VEGETABLES (a Dutch duh),—E, R. 

431. — ^Brown 4 or 6 onions sliced and chopped in a little 
butter, then add different kinds of vegetables chopped, which 
have been previously boiled ; stew them all together, stirring 
the whole time. When half done, add a few tomatas sliced, 
with chilis also sliced, and salt to the taste ; moisten if neces- 
sary with gravy, and either add a glsussful of vinegar or a 
handful of sorrel. 

VEGETABLE CURRY,— E. R. 

432. — Put 2 oz. of butter into a stewpan, then roll celery, 
onions, and broccoli in curry-powder, and stew them until 
tender ; add a cupful of good gravy, a small quantity of mashed 
potatoes mixed up with curry-powder, and salt. Stew the 
whole together until sufficiently done. 

Or : — Take broccoli, cauliflower, or any other vegetable, 
and boil it in water until tender ; then throw out the water, 
cut them in rather large pieces, and add either shrimps, 
prawns, or any minced meat, if you think proper to make 
such an addition ; or if not, then put some fried onions with a 
bit of butter, a pint of water, and the usual quantity of rice 
and curry-powder ; stew all together and add lemon-juice to 
the taste. If the materials be well chosen, it will be found 
very delicate. 



Chap. XVIH.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 345 



SALADS. 

433. — In this country salads are almost always eaten as an 
accompaniment to meat, and, being composed of green vege- 
tables, are seldom brought to table in winter; but on the 
Continent other preparations are introduced under that deno- 
mination. 

Coss-lettuce and blanched endive make the best salad, the 
green leaves being stripped off, and leaving nothing but the 
close, white hearts, which, after being washed and placed for 
an hour or two in cold water, should be wiped quite dry. To 
this should be added a head or two of celery, a couple of an- 
chovies (which are far preferable to the essence), and several 
chives, or young onions, all cut small, while the lettuces should 
be divided lengthwise into quarters, and cut into rather large 
pieces. 

The mixture or dressing, — For 4 persons bruise only the 
yolk of 1 hard-boiled eg^ (leaving out altogether the white), 
with some salt, and make it into a paste with 2 large tea- 
spoonfuls of motUarde de maille ; or, if obliged to use common 
mustard, add to it a drop or two of asafcetida, which will im- 
part to it a slight flavour of garlic. Then add oil and vinegar 
in the following proportions, without using so much as to make 
the sauce thin, and taking care to have the finest Provence or 
Lucca oil, and the very strongest species of real French vine- 
gar : namely, to every one spoonful of vinegar add two of oil ; 
1 spoonful of the vinegar being impregnated with chilis, which 
will add warmth to the salad, much more agreeably than 
cayenne. A little of tarragon may be an improvement, and a 
spoonful of Quihi or walnut ketchup is not objectionable ; but 
mushroom ketchup will destroy the pungency of flavour, and 
both may be left out without inconvenience. 

When this is done, mix the sauce well, but lightly, with the 
salad, to which a few slices of boiled beet-root, and the white 
of the egg sliced, will be a pretty addition. 

Kitchener's Salad Mixture, which is sold in the oil-shops in 
bottles ready prepared for use, is also very good, though not 
equal to that freshly made as above. 

Some people, particularly the French, eat lettuces without 
any other sauce than oil and vinegar, and, when eaten in that 
simple way, a little sugar is certainly an improvem^wt* "SwN. 



346 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVIIL 

although these proportions of oil and vin^;ar are stated, as 
above, to suit the Ekiglish palate, it must yet be observed that 
in France the quantity of oil used in salads is invariably much 
more than double that of vin^;ar. 

The excellence of a salad consists in the vegetables being 
young and fresh, and they should be prepared only a short 
time before they are wanted ; the salad mixture being either 
poured into the bottom of the bowl or sent up in a sauce- 
tureen, and not stirred up with the vegetables until they are 
served. 

In summer salads the mixture must not be poured upon the 
lettuce or vegetables used in the salad, but be left at the 
bottom, to be stirred up when wanted, as thus preserving the 
crispness of the lettuce. 

In winter salads^ however, the reverse of this proceeding 
must be adopted, as thus : the salad of endive, cdery, beet, 
and other roots being cut ready for dressing, then pour the 
mixture upon the ingredients, and stir them well up, so that 
every portion may receive its benefit. 

In doing this, it should likewise be recollected that the 
spoon and fork should always be of wood, and of sufficient size 
to stir up the vegetables in large quantities.* 

CHICKEN SALAD, 

434. — Pull the meat off the bones, put it into a small pan 
with a shalot cut in thin slices, a few sprigs of parsley, and a 
tablespoonful each of oil and tarragon vinegar; season the 
chicken well with pepper and salt; let it soak for about 3 
hours. Boil 3 eggs hard, cut them in 4 pieces lengthways ; 
chop 2 anchovies, 6 olives, and a dessertspoonful of capers; 
take 3 lettuces, reserve the small hearts to garnish with, cutting 
them in 4, shred fine the other leaves that are white, and cut 
roughly some small salad ; put a layer of salad on the dish, 
then the chicken, sprinkle the chopped anchovy, &c., then 
more salad and chicken until you have used up the whole of 
your materials ; then mask it with a thick magnonnaise sauce : 
garnish it round the bottom with the lettuce-hearts and ^gs 
alternately. This salad is much improved if the dish can b6 
placed on pounded ice whilst it is being prepared. 

* As a substitute for egg in salad, rub down a dessertspoonfril of a 
mashed potato with mustard and salt, and some cream or thick melted butter, 
ivJu'ob aoBwen for oil when that is not at hand ; then add the vinegar. 



Chap. XVIIl.] VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 347 

The remaiiis oi veal and white poultry y when minced and 
left cold, instead of being fricasseed, will thus be found an 
excellent addition to the dinner of a summer's day, with added 
slices of cucumber. 

LOBSTER SALAD. 

435. — Take out the meat of the claws and body, cutting it 
into small pieces, and mixing it with the lettuce or endive ; 
but previously separate the soft part of the fish adhering to the 
shell, with the mi spawn of the hen-lobster, and blend them 
with the materials prepared for the dressing. It will perhaps 
require a little more pungency of flavour, which can be im- 
parted by a small additional quantity of chili or tarragon 
Vin^ar. 

Crab J or shrimps, may be used in the same manner ; and 
a great improvement in either will be found by throwing in a 
portion of savoury calf s-foot jelly, divided into pieces. 

Although sheU'fish are very decidedly the best mixture to 
be put into this salad, yet any sort of firm flat-fish, as turbot, 
brill, John-dory, or soles, which have been dressed, and partly 
left cold, may also be prepared in a similar way. 

French Salad, — Chop 3 anchovies, a shalot, and some 
parsley small, put them into a bowl with 2 tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar, 1 of oil, a little mustard, and salt. When well 
mixed, add by degrees some cold roast or boiled meat in very 
thin slices ; put in a few at a time, not exceeding 2 or 3 inches 
long. Shake them in the seasoning, and then put more ; cover 
the bowl close, and let the salad be prepared 3 hours before it 
is to be eaten. 

Italian Salad is made by picking the white portion of a 
cold fowl from the bones in small flakes, piling it in the 
centre of a dish, and pouring a salad mixture over, enriched 
with cream; make a wall around with salad of any kind, 
laying the whites of the eggs, cut into rings, on the top in a 
chain. 

Spanish Salad, — Take whatever salad can be got, wash it 
in many waters, rinse it in a small net, or in napkins, till 
nearly dry, chop up onions and tarragon, take a bowl, put in 
equal quantities of vinegar and water, a teaspoonful of pepper 
and salt, and 4 times as much oil as vinegar and water ; mix 
the same well together ; take care never to put the lettuce into 



348 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVni. 

the sauce till the moment the salad is wanted, or it loses all its 
crispness and becomes sodden. 

On which Mr. Ford quotes a Spanish proyerb wliich says, 
^^ To make a good salad four persons are wanted, — a sp^id- 
thrift for oil, a miser for vin^;ar, a counsellor for salt, and a 
madman to stir it all up." 

Vegetable Salads^ made of roots which have been boiled^ 
also make good winter salads, amongst which potato salad is 
perhaps the best. Cut the roots into thin slices, season than 
with pepper and salt, and pour over them the salad mixture, 
to which may be added, if the flavour be not disapproved, a 
few slices of raw onion. 

F'or Vinaigrette, — ^Take any kind of cold meat, chop it 
finely, and lay it in a dish ; chop the wliites of the eggs em- 
ployed for the salad very finely with small onions ; add any kind 
of herb, and pickled cucumbers, all chopped finely : make a 
garnish round the meat, serve it with salad mixture, but do 
not stir it together, as it would spoil the appearance of the 
dish, which looks very pretty with the eggs and herbs in a 
ring. 

Beet-root^ celery, Spanish onions, carrots, and broccoli may 
also in winter be cut small, and served with the same mixture 
as that employed for vegetables in their raw state. 

In summer, purslain, an herb formerly much cultivated in 
England, is an excellent ingredient among the many raw 
materials ; and tomatas boiled, left until cold, sliced, not very 
thin, and eaten either with or without onions and any other 
vegetable, also make a very nice salad, in either summer or 
winter, as they may be preserved nearly the whole year 
round. 

When very delicately made, cream is sometimes substituted 
for oil in salads, as it pleases some palates, and many persons 
object to oil as disagreeing with their stomachs ; but, in point 
of richness, its flavour is generally thought inferior. 



Chap. XIX.] SAUSAGES AND FORCEMEAT. 349 



CHAPTER XIX. 
SAUSAGES AND FORCEMEAT. 



SAUSAGES. 

436. — ^In making sausages there is so great a variety of both 
meat and condiments, that the cook need not be tied down to 
any rule of composition. The usual mode is to put the pre- 
paration into the cleaned skins of the entrail-puddings of the 
smaller animals ; in which the sausages, being always well 
seasoned, will keep sound for a few days, and are then brtnled 
ajB a garnish for ku*ge dishes, or fried for break&st. As thesd 
skins are, however, not always to be found, the sausage-meat 
may then be bound together with the yolk of egg and bread- 
crumbs, made into the form of sausages, or as croquettes of 
any small size ; then floured, nicely warmed, and browned in 
the frying-pan or Dutch oven until perfectly done. 

If more be made than is wanted for immediate use, it may 
be put away in a cool place, packed closely down in a stone 
jar, and securely covered for some other occasion. For the 
spicing of sausages no rule can be laid down, as tastes and 
custom are constantly varying. 

Common Sausage-meat — Take any quantity of lean beef 
or pork, with half the quantity of fat, and having freed the 
lean of every particle of skin, sinew, and gristle, then mince 
both it and the &t as fine as possible ; putting to each pound 
of meat a large teaspoonful of pepper and the same quantity 
of salt ; strew this on the meat, and mix the whole thoroughly 
together, as a stock for further seasoning. 

Take 6 lbs. of meat, fat and lean ; cut the &,t into small 
pieces, and pound the lean portion in a mortar, with 2 table- 
spoonfuls of salt, one of moist sugar, a teaspoonful of saltpetre, 
and 2 tablespoonfuls of mixed spices. To this may be added 
the grated peel of a lemon, and a small portion of sage and 
thyme, well chopped. 

Or: — ^To the meat of a leg of pork of about 4 lbs. weight 



350 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIX. 

add 2 lbs. of fat from the fore loin, chop both very fine ; 
then add 2 nutmegs grated, 20 cloves, a teaspoonful of 
pounded or grated lemon-peel, 2 or 3 blades of mace pounded, 

1 oz. of the best salt, and i oz. of black pepper; mix 
all together and stuff it into the skins, which should be 
well cleansed and salted the night before. This sausage- 
meat would be much improved for immediate use by pounding 
the meat and mixing it with a third portion of white bread 
soaked in milk and also pounded, blending the whole together 
with a beaten egg. 

BEEF SAUSAGES, 

437. — ^Though not nearly so g^ood as those of pork, yet, if 
made at home, may be found a pleasant and economical 
mode of using the scraps of raw meat. Proceed as for poik 
sausages. 

MUTTON SAUSAGES.— E. R. 

438. — Take a pound of undressed mutton, or that which 
has been underdone, chop it very small, and season it with 
pepper, salt, and beaten mace. Chop also i lb. of beef suet, 

2 anchovies, a pint of oysters, i lb. of grated bread, and a 
boiled onion ; mix the whole with the oyster liquor, and the 
whites and yolks of 2 eggs well beaten ; pound the whole in a 
mortar. Boll into lengths, corks, or balls, and fry them. 

THE CAMBRIDGE SAUSAGE. 

439. — Cut into small pieces 1 lb. of pork, the same quantity 
of beef suet, 1 lb. of beef and veal in equal parts, i lb. of 
bacon fat, and i lb. of the gammon. Chop very finely a 
handful of sage-leaves, and add to them a fourth part of sweet 
herbs. Season the whole with mixed spice, adding a spoonfiil 
of cayenne pepper, and a due quantity of salt. Let the skin 
be well cleaned; fill it, and tie it tightly. Put it into a 
saucepan of boiling water, pricking it first to prevent its burst- 
ing, and allow it to boil 1 hour. 

AN EXCELLENT SAUSAGE TO EAT COLD, 

440. — Season fat and lean pork with some salt, saltpetre, 
black pepper, and allspice, all in fine powder, and rub into 
the meat ; the sixth day cut it small, and mix with it some 
shred shalot or garlic, as fine as possible. Have ready an ox- 
gut that has been scoured, salted, and soaked well, and fill it 
with the above stuffing ; tie up the ends, and hang it to smoke 



Chap. XIX.] SAUSAGES AND FORCEMEAT. 861 

as you would hams, but first wnqp it in a fold or two of M 
muslin. It must be high-^iried. Some eat it without boiling, 
but others like it boiled first. The skin should be tied in du« 
ferent places, so as to make each link about 8 or 9 inches long. 

OXFORD SA USA GES.—E. E. 

441. — ^Take 2 lbs. of lean pork, the same quantity of lean 
yeal, 1 lb. of suet chopped very fine and beaten in a mortar, 
with a French roll just wetted through with milk, ^ oz. of 
pepper, a little salt ; mix all these ingredients well together, 
and pot it. When wanted beat up 4 eggs, mix the sausage- 
meat up in it, roll it into e^Hshapes, and fry in a dry hot 
pan over a very quick fire. The eg^ must only be added the 
day the sausage-meat is used. 

Another Oxford Receipt is to take 1 lb. of young pork, ikt 
and lean, without skin or gristle, 1 lb. of lean veal, and 1 lb. 
of beef suet. Chop all fine together ; add i lb. of grated 
bread, ^ the peel of a lemon shred fine, a small nutmeg 
grated, 6 sage-leaves washed and chopped very fine, a tea- 
spoonful of pepper and 2 of salt, savory, and marjoram shred 
&ie. 

O Ya TER SA USA GE8.—E. R. 

442. — ^Take 1 lb. of veal and a score of oysters bearded, 
then pound the veal very finely in a mortar with a little suet, 
season with a little pepper, soak a piece of bread in the oyster- 
liquor, pound, and add it with the oysters cut in pieces to the 
veal ; beat up an egg to bind them together, and roll them 
into little lengths, like sausages ; fry them in butter a delicate 
brown. 

Or ; — Take ^ lb. of lean mutton or beef, with i lb. of beef 
suet, and two score of oysters bearded. Mince the whole and 
add bread-crumbs, with 2 yolks of eggs to bind the materials 
together. Season with salt, white pepper, a little mace, and 
mushroom powder. 

Put it either in skins, or fry the sausage-meat of a light 
brown in small pieces. 

VEAL AND POULTRY SAUSAGES. 

443. — Sausages may also be made of the remains of veal^ 
turkey, or fotol, which have been dressed. Of either of these 
put equal quantities of meat and bread-crumbs, with half th^^ 
of ham, seasoned with parsley, lemon-thyme, and chiyes. 



352 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XEL 

Mix the materials with a little pepper, salt, and pounded 
mace, the yolk of an egg, and 4- a teaspoonful of flour ; make 
it up as sausages or small rolls to garnish fricassees or minoed 
meat, or as a nice supper dish, pUed round a sweetbread. 

Or : — Chop equal quantities of lean veal and fat bacon, a 
handful of sage, a little salt and pepper, and a few anchovies, 
beat all in a mortar ; and when used, roll and fry it, and serve 
it with fried sippets, or on stewed vegetables, or on white 
collops. 

FOWL OR RABBIT SAUSAGES.— E. R. 

444. — ^Take the remains of a fowl, rabbit, or hare ; when 
boUed or roasted, firee it from the bones, and cut it smalL 
Boil some onions in strong gravy ; when iJie onions are quite 
soft pound them, season with salt, pepper, parsley, 2 cloves, 
and a blade of mace ; pound the meat also, cut some bacon 
into small pieces, and add it. Mix up these ingredients with 
the yolk of an egg, add a little lemon-juice or lemon-pickle, or 
chop a little sorrel with the herbs, fill the skins, and broil 
them. 

Such are the sausages usually made in this country, and 
most commonly eaten fresh; but, on the Continent, many 
sorts are made of a rather large size, seasoned in different 
modes, and smoked, with the intention of keeping them good 
for a long time, as the Brunswick, Bayonne, and Bologna, 
which may always be found in the foreign oil -shops in Eng- 
land. There is, however, another kind, which we do not 
recollect to have ever seen in London, though constantly used 
throughout the Peninsula. 

SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE SAUSAGES 

445. — Are made from the fat and lean of the back and loins 
of a well-fed two-year-old hog, cut into small pieces of less 
than i inch square, and then either finely minced or pounded 
together, and strongly seasoned with cloves of garlic and 
green or red capsicums or chilis ; but as these cannot always 
be conveniently procured in this country, cayenne-pepper 
may be substituted. The whole should then be covered with 
any sort of strong, dry wine, until absorbed by the ingre- 
dients, which wUl occupy perhaps a few days, according to 
the quantity. 

ful the largest skins you can get with the meat, fat and 



Chap. XIX.] SAUSAGES AND FORCEMEAT, 863 

lean alternately, occasionally adding a/ome of the wine. Tie 
up in links, and hang them in a room where they will not 
get damp or become too dry, and they wiU keep 12 
months. 

They are sometimes fried, and eaten dther alone or as a 
relish with poultry, but more frequently put into stews ; and, 
in Spain, always boiled along wiUi the olla, under the name 
of " Chorisos:* 

BLACK PUDDINGS. 

446. — ^The blood must be stirred with salt till cold. Put a 
quart of it, or rather more, to a quart of whole grits, to soak 
one night ; and soak the crumb of a quartern loaf in rather 
more than 2 quarts of new milk made hot. In the mean time 
prepare the guts by washing, turning, and scraping, with salt 
and water, and changing the water several times. Chop fine 
a little winter-savory and thyme, a g^ood quantity of penny- 
royal, pepper, and salt, a few cloves, some allspice, ginger, 
and nutmeg ; mix these with 3 lbs. of beef-suet, and 6 eggs 
well-beaten and strained ; and then beat the bread, grits, £e,f 
all up with the seasoning : when well mixed, have r^y some 
hog*s fat cut into dice, and, as you fill the skins, put it in 
at proper distances. Tie in links only half filled, and boil in 
a large kettle, pricking them as they swell, or they will burst. 
When boiled, lay them between clean cloths, or upon straw, 
till cold, and hang them up in the kitchen. When to be used, 
scald them a few minutes in water, wipe, and put them into a 
Dutch oven. 

If there are not skins enough, put the stuffing into basins, 
and boil it covered with floured cloths ; and slice and fry it 
when used. 

Or : — Soak all night a quart of bruised grits in as much 
boiling hot milk as will swell them and leave i pint of 
liquid. Chop a good quantity of pennyroyal, some leaves of 
sage, savory, and th3rme, with salt, pepper, and allspice 
finely powdered. Mix the above with a quart of the 
blood, prepared as before directed ; then half fill the skins, 
after they have been cleaned thoroughly, and put as much 
of the flare (that is, the inward fat) of the pig as will 
make it pretty rich. Boil as before directed. A small 
quantity of leeks, finely shred and well mixed, is a gp*eat 
improvement. 



854 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIX. 

WHITE PUDDINGa,—E. R. 

447. — To two parts of beef-suet chopped add one part of 
oatmeal previously toasted before the fire ; boU an onion or 
two, and chop them with pepper and salt ; mix the whole well 
together, put the ingredients into skins, and boU them for an 
hour, pricking them as they boil to prevent their bursting. 
They will keep for some time in bran after they have been 
allowed to become cold. Parboil them when wanted, and 
then broU them on a gridiron. 

The quantity of suet may seem disproportioned to the oat- 
meal ; but unless there are two-thirds of the former to one of 
the latter, the [puddingy will be dry and bad. They require 
to be higlily seasoned with pepper and onions. 



^•« 



FORCEMEAT. 

French cooks pride themselves, and very justly, on the 
pains which they bestow on the elaboration of their force- 
meat, or farce. It is an art in which they have attained 
superior excellence, but in which there is no great difficulty. 

At many tables, where everything else is well done, it is 
common to find very bad stuffing, which, according to what it 
is wanted for, should be a selection from the following list, 
observing that of the most pungent articles least must be used. 
A general fault is, that the tastes of lemon-peel and thyme 
overcome all others, therefore they should only be used in 
small quantities ; and except in a few very savoury dishes, 
cayenne and pepper of all kinds should be sparingly used. 
No one flavour should predominate greatly ; yet if several 
dishes be served the same day, there should be a marked 
variety in the tastes of the forcemeats as well as of the gravies. 

The forcemeat should be consistent enough to be cut with a 
knife, but not dry and heavy. Herbs are a very essential in- 
gredient, and it is the copious but judicious use of them that 
chiefly gives the cookery of the French its superior flavour. 

Bacon or butter must always be substituted for suet when 
the forcemeat is to be eaten cold. 

The flavour given to the bread, or panada, is considered 
to be of great importance, and the highest point of perfection 
may be obtained by attending to the following directions : — 



Obap. XIX.] SAUSAGES AND FOBGEMEAT. 355 

PANADA. 

44^. — Pat into a tsmail stewpan 1 <n. of fresh batter, a table- 
qpomifiil of clK^ped moshrooms, a litde chopped thyme aikl 
parsley, i a blade of mace, pepper and salt; stew the whole 
oiner the fire for a few minutes, th«i add to it a spoon-' 
lial of white broth, the crumb of two fVoidi rolls previoud^ 
adafced in nulk and squeezed thoroughly dry ; stir over the- 
fire until it no longer adheres to the stewpan ; take it off, add 
the yolks of two ^[gs? turn it out and leave it to cool ; it is 
then ready fox use. 

UDDER. 

449. — Boil a calTs udder in broth or water ; when odd trim 
off the outude ; pound and rub through a sieve. 

QUENELLE. 

450. — This is one of the most delicate preparations of force- 
meat that we have, and requires practice, care, and attention 
to make it in perfection. It is odled according to the meat 
of which it is composed: quenelles of rabbit, chicken, fish, or 
game. 

Take the meat of two rabbits, pound it and rub it through 
a sieve ; take the same quantity of panada and also of udder or 
very sweet fresh butter, pound these ingredients for a quarter 
of an hour, add a tablespoonful of white sauce, two ^gs, and 
two yolks ; take a small piece, roll it in a baU, and throw it 
in boiling water ; when done it should cut firm and consistent, 
yet light and ddicate ; if more seasoning is required it should 
be added before it is taken out of the mortar. 

To mould them : have two tablespoons, fill one with the 
&rce, shape with a knife, dipping it in boiling water to make 
it perfectly smooth ; dip the other spoon in hot water, with 
which take out the quenelle and lay it in a buttered stewpan ; 
they should be e^Hshaped, and perfectly smooth, and boiled 
for i of an hour. 

Panada for Fish Quenelle^ or Forcemeat, — ^Put two-thirds 
of i pint of water into a stewpan holding a quart, with nearly 
1 oz. of butter ; when boiling, stir in i lb. of flour ; keep it 
moving over the fire until it forms a smooth and tough paste. 
Take it ofi the fire, add the yolks of 3 eggs. When cold, 
use it where directed.

FORCEMEAT, 

451. — Take equal quantities of cold chidceuy veal, and beef, 
shred very small, and mixed together ; season, at the same 
time, with a moderate quantity of pepper, salt, sweet herhs^; 
and grated nutmeg — that is to say, if intended for white meat, 
or for anything delicately flavoured ; but if meant for a savoury 
dish, add a little minced ham, and an atom of garlic or a shalot* 
Put the whole in a stone mortar, and pound it until quite fine, 
then make it into a paste with a raw e^^ some butter, marrow, 
or fat of some kind. When used, it may either be rolled into 
round balls and fried for any made dish, or put into any joint 
of meat or poultry as stuffing ; and if kept in a cool place, and 
well seasoned, it will keep good for several days. 

Indeed, by miocmg tvith any potted meat or game an equal 
proportion of panada, which will always be lighter than bread- 
crumbs, the cook will have at once a very fine species of fitrce, 
to be employed in stuffing olives, fillets of fowl, &c. 

The '^ ferce " is sometimes a delicious preparation of sau- 
sage-meat, and is served up alone ; but it enters into the com- 
position of numerous other dishes. 

Another Forcemeat, — Take 1 J lb. of lean veal, pound it, 
and pass it through a sieve ; 1 lb. of chopped beef suet, and 
6 oz. of panada, pounded well together ; add the veal, season 
with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg ; mix well ; then add 
the yolks of 6 eggs and the whites of 3 ; when these are 
thoroughly mixed, whisk the other 3 whites of eggs to a very 
stiff froth, and add it to the forcemeat ; when all is well mixed 
together, it is fit for use. 

FARCE CUITE,—E, R. 

462. — Cut in small pieces some undressed fowl ; put them 
into a stewpan with a piece of butter, a little salt, pepper, and 
a little nutmeg ; shake them over the fire for 10 minutes, drain, 
and let them cool. Put an equal portion of crumbs of bread 
in the same stewpan with some broth, and a little parsley 
chopped fine ; stir it with a wooden spoon till it becomes quite 
soft. Let it ^et cold, then pound the fowl until it will pass 
through a tamis ; pound the bread also, and put it through 
the sieve ; then put equal parts of the meat, butter, and br^id 
together, and pound them with yolks of eggs sufficient to make 
it into a proper consistence, and keep it in a jar for use. 



Chap. XIX.] SAUSAGES AND FORCEMEAT. 357 



FARCE OF HAM AND VEAL,~E. JR. 

453. — ^Minc6 equal quantities of ham and veal, a bunch of 
parsley, and some pepper; put it on the fire with a little 
broth ; let it stew very gently, then pound it in a mortar ; add 
to it an equal portion of bread soaked in milk and pounded ; 
pound the whole together with some butter, and mix it with 
the yolks of eggs. 

Bacon and veal which have been used in braising, or any* 
thing highly impregnated with the flavour of herbs and 
onions, and very rich, may be employed afterwards as a farce, 
pounded and mixed with panada.* 

STUFFING. 

454. — Take equal quantities of beef-suet and crumbs of 
bread ; chop the suet very finely ; chop together marjoram, 
thyme, and parsley, having as much parsley as there is thyme 
and maijoram together ; add to them a saltspoonful of grated 
l«non-peel, pepper, salt, and a little grated nutmeg ; add eggs 
sufficient to bind it together. 

Seasoning for Stuffing, — 1 lb. salt dried and sifted, J- oz. 
ground white pepper, 2 oz. dried thyme, 1 oz. dried marjoram, 
and 1 oz. nutmeg. When thb seasoning is used, parsley only 
is required to be chopped in sufficient quantity to make the 
stuffing green. The proportions are— J lb. bread-crumbs, 
3 eggs, \ lb. suet, i oz. seasoning, and peel of ^ a lemon 
grated. 

Or Forcemeat, — Shred a little ham or ganmion, some 
cold veal or fowl, some beef-suet, a small quantity of onion, 
some parsley, very little lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg or pounded 
mace, and either white pepper or cayenne, and bread- 
crumbs. Pound it in a mortar, and bind it with 1 or 2 ^gs, 
beaten or strained. For forcemeat patties, the mixture as 
above. 

For Hare, or anything in imitation of it, — ^The scalded 
liver, an anchovy, some fat bacon, a little suet, some parsley, 
thyme, knotted marjoram, a little shalot, and either onion or 
chives, all chopped fine ; crumbs of bread, pepper, and nut* 
meg, beat in a mortar with an e^, 

* Farce for pies. See No. 546. 



858 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. ZDL 

Fish Forcemeat. — Chop, and afterwards pound in a mortar^ 
any kind of fish, adding an anchovy or two, or a teaspooaful 
of the essence of anchovies, but do not allow the taste to pre- 
vail, and the yolk of a hard-boiled egg. If for nungre^ pMud 
butter with it ; but otherwise, the fat ci bacon pounded sefia* 
rately, and then mixed. Add a third p<»Tti(m of bread, pre- 
pared by soaking and pounding previously, and mix the whoie 
up with raw eggs. For mackerel, pike, haddock, and soles, 
Jake the veal forcemeat, add a little anchovy essence, and use 
rather less herbs. 

Oyster Forcemeat, — ^Take a dozen natives, strain them from 
the liquor, mince them, and add i lb. of finely-grated bread- 
crumbs, li^ oz. of butter broken very small, a dessertspoonful 
of parsley, the grated rind of i a lemon ; season with a little 
mace, cayenne, and salt ; mix well ; then bind together with 
the yolk of an e^ unbeaten, and a little of the oyster liquor. 
Care must be taken that the oyster flavour predominates. 

FORCEMEAT BALLS FOR SOUP MAIGRE. 

455. — Forcemeat balls for meagre soups of any description 
should be always used to compensate for the savour of which 
they are deprived by the want of meat-broth ; and may be 
made of fish and sweet herbs, or only of herbs and crumbs of 
bread, in the following manner : — 

Found in a mortar the soft parts of a crawfish, or a few 
shrimps, with an anchovy, and the yolk of a hard-boiled e^y 
beaten up with crumbs of stale bread, pounded mace, cayenne 
pepper, salt, and a very little finely minced garlic Then 
work it up into a paste with a raw ^g to bind it into dough ; 
roll it out, cut it into small balls of the size of marbles, and fry 
them of a fine brown. 

Or : — Leave out the fish, and make them entirely of bread 
and savoury chopped herbs— chervil, tarragon, marjoram, and 
thyme, with a little garlic and a shalot — and bind them up as 
above, with egg, butter, and crumbs of bread. 

Or : — Chop, and afterwards pound in a mortar, any kind 
of fish, adding an anchovy or two, or a teaspooniul of the essence 
of anchovies, but do not allow the taste to prevail, and the 
yolk of a hard-boiled egg : pound butter with it ; add a third 
portion of bread, prepared by soaking and pounding previously, 
and mix the whole up with raw; ^gs. 



CkAP. XrX.] SAUSAGES AND FORCEMEAT. S6d 



i**i 



, Or: — ^Beat the flesh and soft parts of a middling-sized lob- 
ster, half an anchovy, a large piece of boiled celery, the ydk 
of a hard egg, a little cayenne, mace, salt, and white p^petf 
with 2 tablespoonfuls of bread-crumbs, 1 ditto of oystep- 
liquor, 2 oz. of butter warmed, and 2 eggs long beaten : make 
into balls, and fry of a fine brown in butter. 

Or : — ^Take a few shrimps, stripped of their shells, an an- 
chovy, and the yolk of a luurd-boiled egg, with bread-crumbs 
and seasoning as above, but adding some finely-minced sweet 
hixhs, and omitting the oyster-liquor : make all this into k 
pbste with a little butter and a raw egg, made up in balls and • 
fried as befi>re. 

Or : — ^Instead of making the balls of fiish and fryibg them, 
it is a more simple way to make them merely of bread-crumbs, 
hard-boiled egg, and sweet he^bs seasoned with raw egg : di'op 
the balls^ one by one, into the boiling soup a few minutes 
before serving. 2 eggs and ^ lb. of biisad should make 12 ot 
15 balls. 

Or : — Pound in a mortar, into a smooth substance, an an- 
diovy, the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, a head of boiled celery, 
and some sweet herbs, with a couple of tablespoonfuls of bread- 
crumbs, seasoned wilJi mace, a grating of nutm^, cayenne, 
and Salt ; then add 2 oz. of butter melted, and work it into a 
paste with a little Hour and the yolk of a raw egg ; make it 
into balls the size of marbles, and fry them quite brown. 

FORCEMEA T FOR TUR TLE (as at the Bush, Bristol), 

466. — 1 lb. of fine fresh suet, 1 lb. of ready-dressed veal or 
chicken chopped fine, crumbs of bread, a little shalot or onion, 
salt, white pepper, nutmeg, mace, pennyroyal, parsley, and 
lemon-thyme finely shred ; beat as many fresh eggs, yolks and 
whites separately, as will make the above ingredients into a 
moist paste ; roll into small balls, and boil them in fresh lard, 
putting them in just as it boils up. When of a light brown, 
take them out, and drain them before the fire. If the suet be 
moist or stale, a great many more eggs will be necessary. 

JBalls made this way are remarkably light; but being 
greasy, some people prefer them with less suet and ^gs. 
They may therefore be made thus : — Chop up the materials 
with a little white pepper and salt, a sage-leaf or two scalded 
and finely chopped, and the yolk of an egg ; make them into 
small cakes or fritters, and fry them. 



360 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XEX. 

Eggs for Turtle, — Beat 3 hard yolks of eggs in a mortan 
and make into a paste with the yolk of a raw one ; roU it 
into small balls, and throw them into boiling water for 2 
minutes to harden. Though formerly much used, they have 
latterly gone out of fiishion. 

PA880VER BALLS FOR 80UP.—E.R. 

457. — Chop an onion and i lb. of suet very finely ; stew 
them together until the suet is melted, then pour it hot upcw 
8 spoonfuls of biscuit-flour ; mix it well togeUier ; add a little 
salt, a little grated nutmeg, lemon-peel, and ginger, and 6 
eggs. Put the balls into the soup when it boils, and boil them 
for i of an hour. The quantity of ^gs and flour may appear 
disproportioned, but the flour employed is of a peculiar land, 
used for the purpose in Jewish &milies. Nothing can exceed 
the excellence of the balls made after this receipt : .they are 
applicable to any kind of soups. 



Chap. XX.] CURING MEAT, 361 



CHAPTER XX. 



CUBING MEAT, POTTING, AND COLLABING. 



CURING. 

458. — In salting all meat, care should be taken to remove 
the kernels, otherwise it will soon become tainted. It should 
be sprinkled with a handful of common salt to fetch out the 
blood, the brine thrown away on the following day, and the 
meat wiped with a dry doth ; it is then ready to be cured In 
any of the undermentioned ways. Too much care cannot be 
taken in the first salting to rub between every muscle or 
under every flap of the meat, as for want of this care it may 
have an unpleasant taste, though sufiiciently salted. The 
brine wUl serve again, by being boiled and skimmed, which 
may be repeated as long as any scum will rise. Hams should 
be laid with the rind-side downwards ; and it is a good plan 
to heat i peck of conunon salt in a frying-pan and lay it at 
the bottom of the pan. A small quantity of saltpetre is 
necessary to produce the fine red colour either in ham or 
beef; but much will make the meat hard, and the proportions 
of sugar and salt should be varied according to the preference 
given to highly-salted provisions, or those which are cured 
milder. 

TO CORN BEEF, 

469. — A Hound of Beef ^ of IS or 20 lbs, weight. — Mix H 
oz. of sal-prunella, 3 oz. of brown sugar, i oz. of black pepper, 
6 oz. of bay-salt, J oz. of cloves pounded, the same of nut- 
meg, and i lb. of common salt : take out the bone, and rub 
the piece over with conunon salt ; let it remain for a day or 
two, and then rub into it the above ingredients finely pow- 
dered and thoroughly mixed ; let it lie a fortnight, and turn 
it daily. It should then be hung up in a dry place, and, if 
possible, smoked till wanted for use, when it should be either 



862 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XX. 

boiled gently, or baked in a deep dish covered with coarse 
paste. 

This, it may however be observed, is rather a superior mode ; 
as the common way is merely to use bay-salt, with occasicmally 
a little saltpetre to give a tinge of redness to the meat, 
which is seldom smoked except for very large joints. Many 
persons, indeed, think the meat best when stewed; in whidi 
case, put no more water in the pot than will barely cover the 
meat, and keep it gently simmering for 4, 5, or 6 hours, ac- 
cording to the size of the joint. 

To salt Beef red, — Choose a piece of beef with as little bone 
as you can (the flank is the best), sprinkle it, and let it drain 
a day ; then rub it with common salt, a small proportion of 
saltpetre, bay-salt, and a little coarse sugar ; you may add a 
few grains of cochineal, all in fine powder. Rub the pickle 
every day into the meat for a week, then only turn it. 

It will be excellent in 8 days. In 16, drain it finom the 
pickle ; and let it be smoked at the oven's mouth when heated 
with wood, or send it to the baker's. A few days will smoke 
it. It is extremely good eaten fresh from the pickle, boiled 
tender with greens or carrots. If to be grated, then cut a 
lean bit, boil it till extremely tender, and while hot put it 
under a press. When cold, fold it in a sheet of paper, and it 
will keep in a dry place 2 or 3 months, ready for serving on 
bread and butter. 

TSE DUTCH WAY TO SALT BEEF, 

460. — Take a lean piece of beef, rub it well with treacle or 
brown sugar, and turn it often. In 3 days wipe it, and salt it 
with common salt and saltpetre beaten fine ; rub these well in, 
and turn it every day for a fortnight. Roll it tight in a coarse 
cloth, and press it under a heavy weight ; hang to dry in wood- 
smoke, but turn it upside down every day. Boil it in pump- 
water, and press it : it will grate or cut into shivers, and makes 
a good breakfast dish. 

To 12 lbs. of beef the proportion of common salt is 1 lb. 

HAMBURG BEEF.^E. R. 

461. — ^Take a piece of ribs of beef of about 15 lbs. weight, 
and rub it well with common salt ; let it lie for a day or two. 
Take 2 oz. of sal-prunella, 4 oz. of bay-salt, 4 oz. of coarse 



Chaf. XX,] OUBINa MEAT. 868 

1»own sugar, i oz. of white pepper, and j; oz. of cloves and 
mace ; mix and pomid these all well together, and rub them 
well into the beef; let it lie for a fortnight, taking care to 
turn it daily. When taken out of the pickle it dbould be 
smoked, either by lighted oak sawdust or in the chiHmey of a 
kitchen where wood is burned. 

Or .'-—To 16 lbs. of beef put 1 lb. of common salt, 1 lb. of 
treacle, 2 oz. of bay-salt, and 1 oz. of saltpetre ; rub the salt 
thoroughly over the beef, and pour the treacle upon it. Let 
it be turned every day, and well rubbed in thepic^e. At the 
end of 3 weeks put it to dry in wood-smoke. The under bed 
is the best part for this purpose, but the ribs may also be used. 

SPICED BEEF.—E. R. 

462. — ^Make a brine with i lb. of salt, i oz. of saltpetre, 
i lb. of sugar, 30 cloves, as many allspice and black pepper* 
corns, 6 bay-leaves ; crack the spice, put it on to boil for a few 
minutes in a pint of water ; when cold, pour it over a piece 
of beef about 10 lbs. Turn it every day §x a fortnight. 

When required for use, put the beef into a deep pan with the 
brine, a little water, and about 1 lb. of suet. Bake it until 
tender ; let it get cold in the brine. 

Spiced Flank of Beef, — Take 8 or 10 lbs. of the thin flank, 
remove any skin, gristle, or bones ; rub it over with J- oz. of 
saltpetre and i oz. of bay-salt ; then rub it well in with a mix- 
vture of spices, the following proportions being used : — 1 oz. of 
black pepper, 1 oz. of allspice, i oz. of ground ginger, i oz. 
of cloves, and half the quantity of mace. Use only as much 
as will suffice to rub the beef all over ; then add 3 oz. of com- 
mon salt and i lb. of coarse sugar ; let the beef remain a fort- 
night in this pickle, turning it and rubbing it every day : then 
take it out, cover it with the spices and chopped sweet herbs, 
roll it very tight, tie it with tape, put it into a pan with i pint 
of water and i lb. of suet, and bake it or boil it gently for 4 
hours ; put a heavy weight upon it, and when cold take off the 
tape. There will be a fine jelly at the bottom of the pan, 
which should be cleared from fat, and mixed with an equal 
portion of jelly from an ox-foot, as it will be too salt to eat 
alone, or it may be used in soups. 

Leicestershire Spiced Beef — ^Take a round of beef, rub in 
i lb. of saltpetre finely pounded ; let it stand a day, then season 



364 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XX. 

it with i lb. of bay-salt, 1 oz. of black pepper, the same of all- 
spice, both pounded. Let it lie in the pidde a month, turmng 
it every day, and adding about three times a-week a small 
quantity of common salt. Then wash off the salt and spice ; cut 
some fat bacon into pieces about i inch square, and long enough 
to penetrate the beef; roll them in spices, it oz. of mace, 3 laige 
nutmegs, a teaspoonftil of cayenne, and the same of black pep- 
per, pounded ; lard the beef with the bacon, and a greea stuff- 
ing made of chopped herbs. Put the beef into a pan deep 
enough to hold it ; lay a great quantity of beef-suet at the 
bottom of the pan, and also on the top of the beef. Tie the 
beef round widi tape, to preserve its shape, before it is put into 
the pan ; cover the pan first with brown paper, then with paste 
made of barley-flour, and another paper on the top. Put it into 
a quick oven, and bsike it 7 or 8 hours. Pour off the fkt and 
gravy, and let it be cold before it is cut. 

WELSH BEEF,—E. R. 

463. — ^Rub 2 oz. of saltpetre into a round of beef^ let it re- 
main an hour, then season it with pepper, salt, and a fourth 
portion of allspice ; allow the beef to stand in the brine for 15 
days, turning it frequently. Work it well with pickle ; put it 
into an earthen vessel, with a quantity of beef-suet over and 
under it, cover it with a coarse paste and bake it, allowing it 
to remain in the oven for 6 or 8 hours. Pour off the gravy, 
and let the beef stand till cold. It will keep for 2 months in 
winter, and will be found useful amid the Christmas fare in 
the country. 

HUNTERS' BEEF.—E, R. 

464. — To a round of beef weighing 24 lbs. take 3 oz. of 
saltpetre, 3 oz. of the coarsest sugar, 1 oz. of cloves and nut- 
meg, i oz. of allspice, and 3 handfuls of common salt, all in 
the finest powder. Allow the beef to hang 2 or 3 days, 
remove the bones, then rub the spices well into it, continuing 
to do so every day for 2 or 3 weeks. When to be dressed, dip 
it in cold water to take off the loose spice. Bind it up tightly 
with tape, and put it into a pan with a teacupful of water 
at the bottom ; cover the top of the meat with shred suet ; 
cover the pan with a coarse crust, and brown paper over it. 
Let it bake 5 hours, and when cold take off the paste and the 
tape. 



Ghap. XX.] CURING MEAT. 365 



Some persons stuff the orifice from which the bone was taken 
with parsley finely chopped, putting sweet herbs also all round 
between the skin and the meat. 

HUNG BEEF (the Derrynane Receipt),— E. R. 

466. — Rub the beef well with salt and saltpetre, in the pro- 
portion of 2 oz. of saltpetre and 7 lbs. of salt to 50 lbs. of beef. 
Put the beef into a cask or tub, place a board over it, and 
weights upon that ; leave it so for about a fortnight, then take 
it out and hang it in the kitchen to dry, which will generally 
take about 3 weeks. Some persons leave it for a longer time 
in the tub, which they merely cover without the weight ; but 
the above is the better way. 

TO CUBE TONGUES. 

466. — Neats' tongues cured with the whole roof on look 
much larger, but have not any other advantage, being too 
bard to cut pleasantly when salted. If the root is to be re- 
moved, cut it off near the gullet, but without taking away the 
^t that is under the tongue. The root must be soaked in salt 
and water a night, and extremely well cleaned before it be 
dressed, when it is very good stewed with gravy ; or may be 
salted 2 days, and used for pea-soup. Having left the fat 
and a little of the kernel under the tongue, sprinkle it with 
salt and let it drain until next day. Then for each tongue 
mix a large spoonful of common salt, the same quantity of 
coarse sugar, half as much saltpetre, a teaspoonful of ground 
pepper, and 2 cloves of garlic or shalot chopped very fine ; 
rub it well in, and do so every day for a week; then add 
another large spoonful of salt. If rubbed daily, a tongue will 
be ready in 10 days ; but if only turned in the pickle, it will 
not be too salt in 4 or 5 weeks, but should not be kept longer. 
When to be dried, write the date of the day on parchment, 
and tie it on. Smoke 3 days, or hang them in a dry place 
without smoking. When to be dressed, boil the tongue ex- 
tremely tender ; allow 5 hours, and if done sooner it is easily 
kept hot. The longer it is kept after smoking, the higher 
will be the flavour ; but in the estimation of many persons, 
they are best dressed out of the pickle ; if hard, it may require 
soaking 4 or 5 hours. 

Or: — Put the tongue into an earthen pan, rub into it a 



366 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [CaAP. XX. 

tablespoonful of saltpetre, a good handful of salt, and the same 
quantity of coarse brown sugar ; allow the tong^ to remain 
in the pickle for 3 weeks, and rub it over every day. Then 
take it out and put it into the meat-screen before the fire for 2 
or 3 days, till tJie pickle has entirely drained finom it. Thai 
sprinkle it over with bran, and hang it up in any part of tiie 
Jdtchen with the root-end uppermost ; sew salt tongues up in 
coarse linen. 

To cure Sheep's Tongues. — ^Let the tongues be well washed 
and cleaned, and lay them in spring water for i an hour.^ 
Take 1 lb. of salt, i lb. of treacle, and i oz. of saltpetre ; rub 
the tongues well with it, and put them into the pickle : a week 
or 10 days will be sufficient to cure them. 

FOR CURING HAMS. 

Affl. — Choose the leg of a hog that is fiit and well fed| 
as well as of a certain age ; for, if poor, it is not worA 
curing, and if not 1 year old it will never acquire the fine 
flavour of a mellow ham. Sprinkle it with a little salt, and 
let it drain fior a day ; then put to it 1 lb. each of bay-salt 
and the coarsest sugar, with a large handful of conunon salt 
and 4 oz. of saltpetre ; rub it thoroughly with this ; lay the 
rind downwards, and cover the fleshy parts with the salt, with 
which baste it frequently, and turn it every second day. 
Keep it in this for 4 weeks, then drain it and throw bran over 
it ; hang it up in a cool place to dry, then sew it up in a coarse 
linen wrapper rubbed with lime, and do not dress it until full 
3 months old. 

The better way is, however, to smoke it, for which there are 
in London and most large towns regpilar smoke-houses. In 
country places this is not uncommonly done by hang^g it in 
a kitchen chimney where wood is burnt, or in any spare 
chimney where a smothering fire can be kept up, made of wet 
straw and horse-litter, with sawdust or shavings ; but be par- 
ticular to have them of oak, for, if of pine, it will give the 
ham a bad flavour. It will take 3 weeks' smoking. 

Or ; — Hang the ham, and sprinkle it with salt as above ; 
then rub it every day with the following, in fine powder : ilb. 
of common salt, the same quantity of bay-salt, 2 oz. of salt- 
petre, and 2 oz. of black pepper, mixed with li lb. of 
treacle.

468.-^Mix 1 oz. of saltpetre, 1 lb. of common salt, and 1 lb. 
of coarse brown sugar ail tcgether, and rub the ham welL 
Let it lie for a month in this pickle, turning and basting it 
eveiy day ; then hang it in wood-smoke in a dry place, where 
no heat can come to it, and, if to be kept long, hang it for a 
month or two in a damp place, and it wUl eat firm and short. 
Observe, hams thus made need not be soaked ; put them into 
eold water, and let them be 3 or 4 hours before they boil, 
skinuning the pot well and often until it boils. These hams 
have been made with a less quantity of salt and an additional 
quantity of saltpetre, and it has been found to answer well, the 
hams being in that case soaked before boiling. 

WESTPHALIA HAM8,—E. R. 

469.— ^Prepare the hams in the usual manner by rubbing 
them with common salt and draining them ; take 1 oz. of salt- 
petre, i lb. of coarse sugar, and the same quantity of salt ; 
rub it well into the ham, and in 3 days pour a pint of vinegar 
over it. A fine foreign flavour may also be given to hams by 
pouring old strong beer over them, and burning juniper-wood 
while they are diying : molasses, juniper-berries, and highly- 
flavoured herbs, such as basil, sage, bay-leaves, and thyme, 
mingled together, and the hams well rubbed with it, using

only a sufficient quantity of salt to assist in the cure, will 
affcmi an agreeable variety. 

MUTTON HAM.—E. B. 

470. — Cut a hind quarter of mutton in the shape of a ham, 
and allow it to hang for 2 or 3 days. Mix ^ lb. of baynndt, 
2 oz. of saltpetre, i lb. of common salt, and i lb. of coarse 
sugar, all well pounded together, and make them quite hot 
before the fire. Then rub it well into the meat, turning' it in 
the liquor every day ; after 4 days add 2 oz. more of common 
salt. Let it remain 12 days in the brine, then take it out, dry 
it, and hang it up in wood-smoke for a week. 

Another pickle for mutton-ham may be made with 1 oz. of 
saltpetre to 1 lb. of coarse sugar and 1 lb. of salt ; the ham 
to be kept in this pickle for a fortnight, then rolled in sawdust, 
and hung in wood-smoke for 14 days. 

GOOSE HAMS 

471. — Are made by splitting the goose down the back, 
rubbing it with ^ oz. of saltpetre, and then salting it well 
with common salt and coarse brown sugar ; let it lie in pickle 
for 10 days in summer and 14 in winter, rub and turn it every 
day, roll it in sawdust and smoke it. 

In Pomerania, on the shores of the Baltic, where vast 
numbers are cured, the breasts are prepared separately as 
hams; and being much dried in smoking, are always eaten 
without further dressing. In the fens of Lincolnshire the 
geese, when their feathers have been plucked, are also 
salted. 

BACON, 

472. — TTie method of curing Malines Sacon, so much 
admired for its fine flavour, — Cut off the hams and head of a 
pig, if a large one ; take out the chine and leave in the spare- 
rib, as they will keep in the gravy and prevent the bacon from 
rusting. Salt it first with common salt, and let it lie for a day 
on a table that the blood may run from it ; then make a brine 
with a pint of bay-salt, i peck of common salt, about i lb. of 
juniper-berries, and some bay-leaves, with as much water as 
will, when the brine is made, cover the bacon ; when the salt 
is dissolved, and when quite cold, if a new-laid e^^ will swim 
in it, the brine may be put on the bacon, which after a week 



Chap. XX.] CURING MEAT. 869 



must be rubbed with the following mixture : — )• lb. of saltpetre, 
2 oz. of sal-prunella, and 1 lb. of coarse sugar ; after remaining 
4 weeks it may be hung up in a chimney where wood is 
burned ; shaving^s, with sawdust and a small quantity of turf, 
may b e added to tiie fire at times. 

The Slack Pool receipt for curing Sacon,^—¥oT a mid- 
dling-sized hog take 12 lbs. of the best common salt, and 1 lb. 
of saltpetre pounded very finely ; rub it in well, and cover the 
meat about an inch thick, hams, chaps, and all, placii^ it 
with the rind downwards. Let it remain for a week ; then 
take off the salt, turn the whole with the rind upwards, then 
lay the salt on again for another week. Then remove the 
salt, and turn it a second time; lay on the salt and let it 
remain 4 days longer. It will then be properly salted. Wipe 
it clean, rub it aU over with dry salt, and hang it, where it 
will have a little air of the fire, until it is dry. Then sew it 
up in whity-brown paper, and hang it in a dry place where no 
heat can come to it ; and if these precautions are taken, it will 
not get rusty. 

The meat must be salted on a board that is well perforated 
with holes to let the brine run from it, and it must be covered 
up closely with a coarse cloth to keep out the air ; and while 
salting take care to lay the pieces as close as possible one upon 
the other. 

WILTSHIRE BACON. 

473. — Sprinkle each flitch with salt, and let the blood drain off 
for 24 hours. Then mix H lb. of coarse sugar, the same quan- 
tity of bay-salt, 6 oz. of saltpetre, and 4 lbs. of coarse salt ; rub 
this well on the bacon, turning and wetting it in every part, 
daily, for a month ; then hang it to dry, and afterwards smoke 
it 10 days. 

The above quantity of salt is sufficient for a whole hog of 
about 7 or 8 score. 

To cure JBaconfor larding and braising* — ^Take the fattest 
part of the pork, and to every 10 lbs. use 1 lb. of pounded 
salt ; rub it very well over, put the pieces one upon another 
upon boards, and lay boards with a heavy weight upon the 
top ; leave it in a dry cool place for about a month, then hang 
it up to dry without smoking. The hardest is the best for 
larding ; and bacon cured in this way is preferable for culinary

purposes, since the saltpetre usually employed will torn veal 
or poultry red, when braised with any portion of the lean. 

HOCrS CHEEKS, 

474. — Cut out the snout, remove the brains, and split the 
head, taking off the upper bone, to make the chowl a good 
shape ; rub it well with salt ; next day take away the htwe, 
and salt it again the following day with a quart of bay-ealt, 
2 quarts of conunon salt, and H lb. of brown sugar, put 
into H gallon of spring water ; stir it until the whole is dis- 
solved. This quantity will be sufficient for 3 pairs of chaps : 
be careful to turn them in the brine at least every other day, 
and to keep them well covered. Dry them in wood-ashes. 

BRA WN. 

475. — Split and nicely clean a hog's head, take out the 
brains, cut off the ears, and rub a good deal of salt into the 
head ; let it drain 24 hours ; then lay upon it 2 oz. of salt- 
petre, and the same of common salt, for 3 days ; lay the head 
and salt into a pan, with just water to cover it, for 2 days more. 

Wash it well, and boil until the bones will come out ; 're- 
move them, and chop the meat as quickly as possible in pieced 
of 1 inch long ; but first take the skin carefully off the head 
and the tongue, the latter also cut in bits. Seascm with pepper 
and salt. Put the skin of one side of the head into a sinall 
long pan, press the chopped head and tongue into it, and lay 
the skin of the other side of the head over, and press it down. 
When cold it will turn out* The head may probably be too 
fat, in which case prepare a few bits of lean pork with the 
head. Boil 2 oz. of salt, a pint of vinegar, and a quart of the 
liquor, and, when cold, pour it over the head. The ears are 
to be boiled longer than the head, cut in thin strijxs, and 
divided about it, the hair being nicely removed. Reboil the 
pickle often. 

Another mock Brawn, — ^Boil a pair of neat's feet very 
tender ; take the meat off, and have ready the belly-piece of 
pork, salted with common salt and saltpetre for a week. Boil 
this till nearly done ; take out the bones, and roll the feet and 
the pork together. Then roll it very tight with a strong 
cloth and coarse tape. Boil it till very tender, then hang it up 
in the cloth till cold ; after which keep it in a sousing liquor. 

To keep Brawny the Cambridge way. — To 2 gallons of 



Chap. XX.] CURING MEAT. 371 

water put 1 lb. of wheat-bran and 1 lb. of salt ; boil 1 hour ; 

when cold, strain it, and keep the brawn in it. In 10 or 12 

days fresh pickle will be required. If, by length of carriage 

or neglect, the brawn be kept too long out of pickle, make 

as above, and when rubbed well with salt, and washed with 

some of the pickle, it will be quite restored to its former 

gnoodness. 

TO FICKLE POBK.—E, R. 

476. — ^Take i bushel of common salt, 1 lb. of bay-salt, i lb. 
of saltpetre, and 6 lbs. of coarse brown sugar; make hams <^ 
the legs. Take the sides of the pork and rub them well with 
C(nnmon salt, lay a thin bed of sidt in the tray, and place one 
of the sides in it ; sprinkle with salt to cover it : lay the other 
side on the top, and sprinkle it also. Let them lie 2 or 8 
days, rubbing the salt well in ; then cover the whole with the 
other ingredients, and, as soon as the salt b^ins to give, rub 
them well in ; turn the sides frequently, and let them be 
covered with brine: it will be fit for use in 6 or 8 weeks. 
These quantities are for a pig of 15 or 16 score. 

A PICKLE 

477. — That will keep for years, for hams, tongtees, or beefy 
if boiled and skimmed between each parcel of them. — To 2 
gallons of spring water put 2 lbs. of coarse sugar, 2 lbs. of bay 
and 2\ lbs. of common salt, and h lb. of saltpetre, in a deep 
earthen glazed pan that will hold 4 gallons, and with a cover 
that will fit close. Keep the beef or hams as long as they 
will bear before you put them into the pickle ; and sprinkle 
them with coarse sugar in a pan, from which they must drain. 
Kub the hams, &c., well with the pickle, and pack them in 
close, putting as much as the pan will hold, so that the pickle 
may cover them. The pickle is not to be boiled at first. A 
small ham may lie 14 days, a large one 3 weeks ; a tongue 12 
days, and beef in proportion to its size. They will eat well 
out of the pickle without drying. When they are to be dried, 
let each piece be drained over the pan ; and when it will drop 
no longer, take a clean sponge and dry it thoroughly. 6 or 
8 hours will smoke them, and there should be only a little 
sawdust and wet straw burnt to do this ; but if put into a 
baker's chimney, sew them in a coarse cloth, and hang them a 
week. Add 2 lbs. of common salt and 2 pints of water every 
time you boil the liquor.

POTTING AND COLLARING. 

478. — ^To poi and collar are only different modes of pre- 
•erving fish and meat for a longer time than they coald be 
k^ fresh ; chiefly, in the instance of poUmg^ by poundhig 
the materials with seasoning, when dressed, and then potting 
smaD portions in closely covered jars or pots ; whfle coUarimg 
is dme by slicing portions of the meat or fish, and, when wdl 
seasoned, rolling it in round pieces, to be eat^i cold as savomy 
dishes at break&st and luncheon. 

In poUing, take care to wait until the meat is cold ; pms 
the meat firmly into the pots ; but, before patting it diero, 
drain the gravy thoroughly fitHU the meat, or the gravy will 
torn it sour ; then cover well with clarified butter, and tie 
over it cnl-skin, or ofled paper, to exclude the air. 

To clarify Butter. — Put your boat into a saucepan of ooM 

water, and set it over a slow fire until it melts ; then take it 

off the fire, take off the scum, and again warm it g^itly. After 

being used it will still serve for basting or for meat-pie paste, 

and is ako excellent for fish sauce. 

' In collaring^ be careful to roll the meat tightly and bind it 

firmly. Let it also be thoroughly done, left in a cool place, 

sometimes rubbed with pickle, but always wiped perfectly 

dry. 

TO POT LAMPREY. 

479. — Lamprey is a species of eel only found in a few 
parts of England ; and, being considered as a rarity, is 
almost invariably potted for the convenience of being for- 
warded to places at a distance. The mode adopted at 
Worcester, which is celebrated for its superior excellence, 
is as follows : — Leave the skin on, but remove the cartilage 
and a string on each side of it down the back. Wash 
and clean the fish very nicely in several waters, and wipe 
them. To a dozen of tolerable size use 2 oz. of white pepper, 
salt in proportion, 6 blades of mace, a dozen of cloves, all in 
fine powder, but do not season until the fish shall have drained 
all night. Lay them in a stone pot one by one, and curled 
round, the spices and salt being sprinkled in and about them. 
Clarify 2 lbs. of butter and ^ lb. of the finest beef-suet, pour 
it on the fish, and lay thick paper over to keep in the steam. 
Bake 3 hours in a moderate oven. Look often at them, and 



Chap. XX.] POTTING AND COLLARINa. 373 

as the oil works up take it clear off. They will thus, in the 
storepot, keep till the spring. Put into pots for serving as 
wanted ; observing to take off the old butter, and, having 
warmed the fish in the oven, cover with fresh butter only. 

TO POT SBELL-FISB. 

480. — Boil lobsters, crayfish, and shrimps in salt and water, 
pick the meat out of the tails and claws, put them into a stew- 
pan with a little butter, some chopped mushrooms or truffles, 
and simmer a short time over a gentle fire. When nearly 
done, beat the yolks of 2 or 3 eggs with a teacupful of cream 
and a little chopped parsley ; let all stew together for a few 
minutes, until rendered as consistent as paste, and set it as' 
above stated. 

Or: — When boiled, take them out of their shells, and 
season them with salt, white pepper, and a very little mace 
and nutmeg ; but use the spice very sparingly, only just suffi- 
cient to preserve the fish for a few days in a firesh state, bs 
they will not keep good much longer. Press them into a pot^ 
lay a little butter over them, and bake in a slow oven for 10 
minutes. When cold, cover with clarified butter. 

Shrimps may also be potted whole, by putting them for a 
few minutes in clarified butter, seasoned as above, and gently 
heated ; then put into pots, and cover with more butter, to 
totally prevent the admission of air. Cover the pots also with 
oil-skin. 

TO POT POULTRY AND GAME. 

481. — Chickens, — Take as much lean of boiled ham as you 
may think proper, and ^ the quantity of fat, each cut as 
thin as possible ; beat it very fine in a mortar with a little 
clarified butter, pounded mace, pepper, and salt — ^if the ham 
be not sufiiciently impregnated. To this add the white part 
of the fowl, also pounded, but without seasoning, as it is only 
intended to qualify the savouriness of the ham. Then either 
mix the whole together, or put a layer of ham and chicken 
alternately ; press it hard in the pots, bake in a cool oven for 
i an hour, pour over it clarified butter to the thickness of a 
crown-piece, and paste over it a piece of paper, which may be 
oiled when the paste is dry. 

Let them be quite fresh, clean them carefully, and season 
them with salt and pepper ; lay them close in a small deep 
pan; for, the smaller the surface, and the closet tK^^ ^x^ 



874 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XX.' 

packed, the less butter will be wanted. Cover them with 
butter, then with very thick paper, tie down and bake them. 
When cold, put them dry into pots that will hold 2 or 3 in 
each ; and pour butter over them, using that which was baked 
as part. Observe that the butter should be pretty thick over 
them if they are to be kept. If pigeons were boned and then 
put in an oval form into the pot, they would lie closer and 
require less butter. They may be stuffed with a fine force- 
meat made with veal, bacon, &c. If a high flavour is ap- 
proved of, add mace, allspice, and a little cayenne, before 
baking. 

Partridges and Pheasants. — Clean them nicely, and sea- 
son with mace, allspice, white pepper, and salt, in fine pow- 
der, or seasoning spice. Rub every part well ; then lay the 
breast downwards in a pan, and pack the birds as close as you 
possibly can. Put a good deal of butter on them ; then cover 
the pan with a coarse flour paste, and a paper over, tie it 
dose, and bake. When cold, put the birds into puts, and 
cover them with butter. 

Or : — When baked and grown cold, cut them into proper 
pieces for helping ; pack them close into a large potting-pan, 
and (if possible) leave no spaces to receive the butter. Cover 
,them with butter, and i part less will be wanted than when 
the birds are done whole. 

Hare, — Ilang up a hare 4 or 5 days with the skin on; 
then case it, and cut it up as for eating ; put it in a pot, and 
season it with mace, pepper, and salt ; put 1 lb. of butter 
upon it, tie it down, and bake it in a bread-oven till tender. 
When it comes out, pick it from the bones, and pound to a 
smooth consistence with the fat from the butter, and pot it in 
the usual way.' 

Mahbits. — Cut up 2 or 3 young but full-grown ones, 
.and take the leg-bones off at the thigh; pack them as 
elosely as possible in a small pan, after seasoning them with 
.pepper, mace, cayenne, salt, aUspice, all in very fine powder, 
3iake the top as smooth as you can. Keep out the liver and 
.the carcases, but take off the meat above the neck. Put a 
good deal of butter, and bake the whole gently. Keep it 2 
days in the pan ; then shift it into small pots, adding butter. 
. The livers sdso should be added, as they eat well.

- Ham tmd veal may be potted in the same mamier. 

Neafs Tongue, — Rub it with 1 oz. of saltpetre and 4 oz. of 
brown sii^r ; let it lie 2 days, then boil it mitil it is quite 
tender ; take off the skin and all the fibrous part of the root, 
Cut it in thin pieces, and pound it with 1 lb. of clarified butter, 
and seasoning to your taste.* 

TO POT BEEF. 

482. — ^Take 4 lbs. of the brisket, round, or rump of beef, 
firee from skin or sinews of any kind. Bub it over with rather 
more than ^ oz. of sugar, common salt, and saltpetre, and 
leave it in that state for a couple of days, turning it over 3 or 
4 times ; then put it into a stewpan placed in an oven, with a 
little chopped suet and about i pint of water. When sufiSi- 
ciently stewed, drain the fat and gravy from the meat, cut it 
up, and pound it in a mortar till it becomes perfectly smooth, 
adding to it some cayenne, white pepper, salt, and a little 
pounded mace, with about i lb. of clarified butter, to be gra- 
dually mixed with the meat while pounding. When reduced 
to this consistence, put it into pots, bake it, and cover it in the 
same manner as in other receipts. 

Or : — Put the same quantity of beef, prepared in like 
manner, into an earthen pot with a few blades of bruised 
mace, a marrow-bone, and a pint of water. Let the pot 
remain fot the space of 3^ hours in a hot oven, after which 
the beef and marrow should be pounded and reduced to a 
pulp, along with i lb. of anchovies which have been scaled 
and boned. 

Season as before, and pot in the same manner ; the marrow 
and anchovy not only adding to the flavour of the meat, but 
tending to keep it longer in a moist state.^ 

To pot See/ in imitation of Venison, — ^Put 8 or 10 lbs. of 
lean beef into a deep dish ; pour over it a pint of red wine, 
and let it lie in it for 2 days, seasoning it well with mace, 
pepper, salt, and a clove of garlic ; then put it into a closely 
covered pot along with the wine, and another glassful if it be 
not sufficient, and bake it for 3 hours in a quick oven ; when 
cold, pound it to a paste, and pot it as above.

376 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XX; 

Venison may itself be potted in the same mamier ; but if it 
be stale, rub it previously with pyroligneous acid. 

HAM CAKE.^E, R, 

483. — ^Take the remains of a ham that may be getting' dry, 
pound it in a mortar very finely, with all the hi ; season it with 
pepper and mixed spice ; add to it clarified butter sufficient to 
make it moist ; put it into a mould, and place it in an oven for 
about i an hour ; it should be prepared the day before it is 
wanted : put the mould for a few minutes in warm water in 
order that it may turn out properly. This may be made with 
equal quantities of cold beef pounded separately, and placed in 
layers in the mould, or put together in lumps to look like 
marble. Tongue may also be substituted for the ham, but it 
must be mixed with a larger quantity of butter in the pound- 
ing. If not wanted at the time, it may be potted with veal, 
and covered with clarified butter. It will keep well in winter 
if properly seasoned. 

TO POT MUSHROOMS, 

484. — Choose large buttons, or those in which the inside is 
not yet the least brown ; peel and wipe out the fur of the larger 
ones ; and to every 2 quarts put i dr. of pounded mace, 2 £s. 
of white pepper, and 6 or 8 cloves in powder : set them over 
the fire, shake, and let the liquor dry up into them. Then put 
to them 2 oz. of butter, and stew them in it till they are fit for 
eating ; pour the butter from them, and let them become cold. 
Pack them close into a pot, making the surface as even as pos- 
sible ; add some butter lukewarm, and then lay a bit of white 
paper over them, and pour clarified suet upon it to exclude 
the air. 

The collaring of Meat and Fish is an excellent method of 
preparing it to be eaten cold, having the advantage of keeping 
for a long time, and being at all times ready for breakfast or 
luncheon. 

COLLARED EEL.—E. R. 

485. — Cut off the head, then split and take out the bone, but 
do not skin the fish ; season them with mixed spices, some pars- 
ley and sweet marjoram shred very fine, and a few chopped 
sage-leaves; sprinkle a little dry isinglass over them; roll 
them tightly up in a cloth, bind it well with strong tape. 



I fe.. 



Chap. XX.] POTTING AND COLLARING 37 

Boil them in good gravy with a little vinegar, according to 
the quantity of eels collared, a few pepper-ooms, a sprig of 
sweet marjoram, 2 or 3 onions, 4 bay-leaves, a blade or two 
of mace, and a dozen allspice. Boil until tender ; take them 
up and retie them without taking out of the cloth, let them 
stand until cold, then glaze them. They may be sent whole to 
table, or cut in slices, and garnished with jelly and bar* 
berries. 

As a standing dish, and only eaten cold as a relish, it ought 
always to be highly seasoned. 

TO ^ CAVE ace:** FISff. 

486. — Bone the tail of a cod, and cut it into slices, season 
them with white pepper and salt, then fry them, and when cold 
put them into a pickle made of vinegar boiled with pepper- 
corns, a few cloves, mace, and bay-leaves ; add when cold 
a teacupful of sweet oil ; lay the fish in a jar with slices of 
onion between each, and cover the whole with vinegar. Sal- 
mon may be pickled in the same manner. When served up at 
table put a sufficient number of pieces in the centre of a dish, 
and raise round it a wall of salad. 

TO COLLAR BEEF. 

487. — ^Make a pickle with 6 oz. of brown sugar, 4 oz. of 
common salt, and 1 oz. of saltpetre. Then take a flank of beef, 
and leave it in the pickle for 10 days or a fortnight, turning it 
every day. When taken out, remove the bone and gristle, but 
leave on the outer skin ; lay it upon the table, with the skin 
downwards, and beat the inside well with a rolling-pin or 
wooden mallet until quite tender ; that done, score the flesh in 
rows, down and across, about the breadth of 2 fingers ; but in 
doing so take care not to cut the outside skin. Then fill the 
scores alternately with slices of the fat of bacon and corned pork, 
and sweet herbs of all sorts, chopped, and seasoned with spice, 
till you have filled them all ; after which, roll the flank up 
very tightly, and bind it round with coarse broad tape, wrap 
it in a cloth, and boil it gently, but steadily, for 4 or 5 hours, 
according to the size of the joint. When quite cold, take it 
out of the cloth, unbind the tape, and fasten the roll with small 
skewers. If you wish to improve its appearance, you may also 
either glaze it, or rub it with yolk of egg^ and brown it with a 
salamander. 



378 MODEBN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XX. 

Another mode is, to take either the flank or briekeij and 
prepare it, as above, for boiling ; but stew it with a very little 
water, and, when done, cover £he meat with a coating of chop- 
ped parsley, thyme, chives, or shalot, seasoned with a litUe 
cayenne ; then put it under a board, and lay weights upon it 
for an hour or two, to press it close together ; iNit before it 
becomes quite cold, remove the weights, and roll the piece up 
in the manner already directed. 

An economical way. — ^Take the best part of a ekin of beefy 
of which soup has been made (for it must be stewed until reiy 
tender), and an ox-tail^ ako well stewed ; cut them into small 
pieces, season them well, add a glass of wine and a glass of 
ketchup, and put it into a stewpan covered with a part of the 
liquor in which the ox-tail has been boiled ; stew it for about 
20 minutes, and then put it into a mould. It must be very 
cold before it is turned out. This is a good way of employing 
the beef and heel when soup or jelly is made ; a few chopped 
sweet herbs may be added, and hard eggs cut into slices, or 
pickles, such as sliced cucumbers, intermingled. The flavour 
may be varied in many ways. 

TO COLLAR CALF'S HEAD. 

488. — Scald the skin of a fine head, dean it nicely, and take 
out the brains. Boil it tender enough to remove the bones ; 
then have ready a good quantity of chopped parsley, mace, 
ground nutmeg, salt, and white pepper, mixed well : season it 
high with these ; lay the parsley in a thick layer, then a quan- 
tity of thick slices of fine ham, or a beautifully coloured tongue 
skinned, and then the yolks of 6 nice eggs stuck here and 
there al)out. Roll the head quite close, and tie it up as tight 
as you can. Boil it till the tape slackens, and then lay a weight 
upon it (without removing the bandage) till quite cold. Keep 
it in a pickle of the liquor, vinegar, and salt. 

A cloth must be put imder the tape, as for other collars. 

Ox-cheek may be collared in the same way. 

BREAST OF VEAL. 

489. — Bone it, take off the thick skin and gristle, and beat 
the meat with a rolling-pin. Season it with herbs chopped 
very fine, mixed with salt, pepper, and mace ; or, if you have 
it, seasoning made according to No. 544. Lay some thick slices 
of hue ham ; or roll into it 2 or 3 calves' tongpies of a fine red, 



Chap. XX.] POTTINa AND COLLARING. 879 

boiled first an hour or two, and skinned. Bind it up tight in a. 
cloth, and tape it. Set it over a slow fire to nnuner in a snuJI 
quantity of water, till it is quite tender : this wiH take some 
hours. Lay it on the dresser, with a board and weight cm it, 
till quite cold. 

IHgs'and calves' &et bdled, aud taken bom the bones, may 
be put in or ronnd it. The diflbrent colours laid in layers look 
well when cut ; an|i you may put in yolks of eggs btnled, beet- 
root, grated ham, and chopped paisley, in di^rcnt parts. 
: When it is cold, take offthe tape, and pour over it the liqucw, 
which must be boiled up twice a-week, or it will not keep. 

BREAST OF MUTTON, 
490, — Collared in this mode, will alsu be found very nice. 
jBone the meat, and rub it over with yolk of egg, over which 
grate some lemon-peel and nutmeg, with a little pepper and 
salt ; then mince a large spoonful of capers with a couple of 
anchovies, shred a handful of parsley and a few sweet herbs, 
mixed with cnimb of a French roll ; strew it over the mutton, 
and roll it up tight ; boil it gently for 2 hours, and, when taken 
up, jiut it in the same kind of pickle as that for calf's head. 

TO COLLAR A FIG.—E. S. 

491. — Take a line fat pig of a month or 5 weeks old, pre- 
pared for the table ; cut off the head and spUt the p^ down the 
back, aud bone it ; chop a handful of sag« very smaU, mix it 
with 2 nutmegs and 3 or 4 blades of mace beaten fine ; add to 
it a lai^e handful of salt, and season the pig all over ; roll it 
hard, tie it with tape, sew it in a clean linen cloth, and lx>il it 
in water with a little oatmeal and a good seasoning of salt ; 
boil till very tender, which will take several hours. Keep it 
in the cloth in which it was boiled until quite cold. Then take 
the cloth from the pig, aud let it lie for 8 days in a marinade. 
Eat it with mustard, sugar, and vinegar. 

To collar Pig's Head. — Scour the head and ears nicely ; 
take off the hair aud snout, and take out the eyes aud &e 
brains ; lay it in water 1 night : then drain, salt it extremely 
well witli common salt and saltpetre, aud let it lie 5 days. Boil 
it enough to take out the bones ; tlien lay it on a dresser, tum- 
ii^ the thick end of one side of the head towards the thin end 
of the other, to make the roll of equal size ; sprinkle it well 
with salt aud white pepper, and roU it with the- ears ; and, if 



380 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XX. 

you approve, put the pig's feet round the outside when IxHied, 
or the thin parts of 2 cow-heels. Put it into a doth, bind with 
a broad tape, and boil it till quite tender ; then put a good 
weight upon it, and do not take off the covering till cold* 

If you choose it to be more like brawn, salt it longer, let the 
proportion of saltpetre be greater, and put in also some pieces 
of lean pork ; and then cover it with cow-heel to look like the 
horn. 

This may be kept either in or out of pickle of salt and water 
boiled, with vinegar ; and is a very convenient thing to have 
in the house. 

If likely to spoil, slice and firy it either with or without butter. 

A MARINADE FOR COLLARED MEATS. 

492. — ^Make thin water-gruel of oatmeal ; season it well with 
salt ; add ^ pint of white wine and ^ spoonful of white pepper ; 
boil it all together for ^ an hour ; allow it to become cold 
before the collar is put into it.

PAMCAEES, AND FRITTERS. 



ITAmiH PASTES. 

493. — Macasoni is coming much more into use in this 
country than formerly, and large quantitiea of it are now made 
in London. The IlaJian is, however, of a superior quality, as 
the flour of which it is made comes from a peculiar species of 
wheat, only grown in some parts of Italy, and much harder than 
the grain raised in Eugland ; the consequence of which is, that 
the English macaroni when boiled acquires a floury taste, while 
the Italian, though quite as teiider, is more crisp and firm on 
the palate, as well as more transparent in appearance, and 
should be always preferred, not only from what we have 
already said, but from the better mode in which it is there 
manufactured. The Geonese and Neapolitan are thought tiie 
best, but there are different opinions on the subject of their 
value; the Neapolitan being only Is., while the Genoese is 
It. 4d. per lb. The Genoese, being closer made than that of 
Naples, and appearing to be more delicate, bears the higher 
price ; but the Neapolitan being more easily dressed, coi^ 
generally prefer it, though not so essentially good as the 

Besides macaroni, there are Vermicelli, semolina, a smaller 
sort called maearoncitti, and various other pastes of the same 
nature, all made in Italy from the same kind of grain ; nothing, 
therefore, can be more simply nutritive, nor, when well boiled, 
more easy of digestion. There are also two sorts of macaroni 
— the pipe and the tape — the one hollow, and the other flat, 
but both made of the same material ; the vermicelli being that 
most generally used in soup : each being severally used in 
various ways according to the followii^ receipts : — 



382 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. 



MACARONI, 

494. — Cooks are, in this country, very fond of boiling it in 
milk, and even of laying it in milk for an hour or two to swell 
and become tender, but boiling water is better, i lb. will 
be sufficient for half a dozen people, and will not require 
more than 20 to 25 minutes to become tender, if boiled in 
water, but a few minutes longer if boiled in broth. Half the 
quantity of Parmesan cheese should be finely grated and 
sprinkled over it in layers, to mix it thoroughly; a small 
plateful of grated macaroni is also put on the table for each 
person to add it at their pleasure. It should be served quite 
hot, as the least chill soddens it. In England it is usually 
eaten with mustard, and, if wished to be made very savoury, 
beef gravy may be used with a truffle stewed in it. 

As to using any other cheese with it than Parmesan, or 
perhaps Gruy^re, or both, it is decidedly objectionable ; we 
have tried it repeatedly with Cheshire and other English and 
Dutch sorts, but nothing but Parmesan will give it the true 
flavour. 

To hrotan Macaroni is the common practice of our English 
cooks ; though, in fact, the browning, while giving a pretty 
appearance to the macaroni, not only hardens the top of the 
cheese into a crust, but gives a taste of rancidity, and we 
strongly recommend the old way of merely stewing, and put- 
ting it on the table just as it comes from the stewpan. If, 
however, appearance be preferred to flavour, it can be done 
with crumbs of bread, thus : — 

Wash the macaroni, then simmer it in a little broth, with a 
little pounded mace and salt. When quite tender, take it out 
of the liquor, lay it in a dish, grate a good deal of cheese over, 
then cover that with bread grated fine. Warm some butter 
without oiling, and pour it from a boat through a little earthen 
colander all over the crumbs, then put the dish in a Dutch 
oven to brown the bread of a fine colour. 

NEAPOLITAN MACARONI. 

495. — ^Boil it quickly in water with some salt ; when tender 
strain it off", drain it thoroughly, and put it into a stewpan 
with a few bits of butter, and grated Parmesan cheese, pepper, 
and salt. Toss it imtil the cheese is well mixed, and then put 
it into a dish, with the remainder, the larger portion, of the 



Ohap. XXL] ITALIAN PASTES. SBS 

grated cheese on the top. It is not to be browned, and will 
be found delioibuB. 

Or : — When boiled put a layer at the bottom of the dish, 
seasoned with black pepper and salt, then a layer of Farmesau 
cheese. Make 2 or 3 layers, finish with the cheese on the lop, 
then pour round a rich brown gravy. 

Or: — Boil the macaroni in weak veal-broth until it is 
soft, adding salt for seasoning. When tender drain it, and put 
it on a dish, placing- small bits of butter and grated cheese upon 
every layer. Put a lai^er quantity of grated cheese and 
butter OD the top, and place the dish in a Dutch oven for \ 
bour, but do not allow tlie cheese to become hard, 

COLD MACARONI, 
496. — If atrtady dretaed, may be wanned in any fciitd of 
broth, letting it simmer gently upon a slow fire with the yolks 
of 2 e^gs to thicken ; after which it should be put into tite 
oven in a mould covered with crumbs of bread : w, (^wh 
dreated, it may be made by leaving it ovomig^t in broth, and 
then proceeding with it as above, 

MACARONI AU VIN. 
497. — Take a French roll hot out of the uven, rasp it, pour 
a pint of wine upon it, and cover it close up for 4 an hour, to 
let it imbibe the wine ; then have ready an ounceof macaroni, 
boiled until it is soft, and lay it upon a sieve to drain : after 
which put into it about the size of a walnut of butter, attd as 
much thick cream as it will take. That done, scrape in as 
much Parmesan tossed into a pan with the macaroni until it 
becomes like a fine custard, and pour it hot upon the loaf; 
brown it with the salamwider, and serve it up. 

MACAKONI A L'lTALIENNE. 
498.— Take i lb. ( 
thicken h pint of mUk 
2 tablespoonfiils of cream, i teaspoonfiil of mustait], a little 
white pepper, salt, and cayenne. Stir into this i lb. of giated 
cheese ; boil all together a few minutes ; add the macaroni ; 
make all quite hot, and serve. This ia the mode adopted at 
the best tables in Florence. 



384 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXI. 



TIME ALE DE MACARONI.— E, R, 

499. — Soften the macaroni by boiling it fast until it will 
cut easily without breaking, but do not let it be too soft ; 
then cut it into pieces i inch long, and with great exactness, 
that all should be of the same size ; butter a mould, stick tiie 
macaroni quite close together all over it, so as to look like a 
honeycomb ; then spread a thin layer of quenelle farce over 
the macaroni ; fill up the mould with a mince of stewed ox 
palates cut into small pieces, and small button mushrooms, 
either pickled or fresh, moistened well with white sauce: 
close the mould, and boil it for i of an hour ; turn it out 
very carefully, and serve it with thick white sauce and mush- 
rooms. 

Aux Truffes, — ^Have 6 small moulds the shape of coffee-cups, 
and not much larger ; butter them, place at the small end a 
truffle ; then encircle the truffle with macaroni, prepared and 
cut as in the foregoing receipt, sticking each piece regularly 
round till the whole of the mould is covered ; fill it up witili 
minced sweetbread and thick white sauce. These are very 
beautiful and excellent dishes, but require great care and 
attention : they are not, however, expensive ; and as any kind 
of fowl, game, or cold fricassee may be employed, cooks are 
recommended to practise the method of placing the macaroni 
round the interior of the mould, in order to obtain the neces- 
sary proficiency when the dish appears before company. It 
is equally good when not quite exact, but not so pleasing to 
the eye. 

A la Pontife. — ^Boil i lb. of the longest and straightest 
tape macaroni in boiling water, with a little salt and butter; 
when nearly done, strain and dry it ; then butter a mould, 
and lay the macaroni quite evenly over it ; if oval, the pieces 
at their full length ; if another shape, take care that the pieces 
shall meet and join ; cover the macaroni with fine farce, 
then fill up the interior with larks boned, fillets of game, 
fowl, and small pieces of fat bacon, cut round, the size of 
a sixpence, small eggs made of the yolk pounded as for 
mock-turtle, and mushrooms or truffles ; moisten it with a 
rich sauce, cover it, and let it simmer, without boiling, for 
an hour. 



Chap. XXI.] ITALIAN PASTES. 886 

pAt£ de macaaoni.—e. r, 

500. — Stew some macaroni in butter and water, or broth, 
strain it, cut it into pieces, and lay it at the bottom of the 
dish, adding ham baUs, made of ham pounded in a mortar, 
and blended with butter ; then have ready any kind of game, 
boned ^and filleted, cock's-combs or ox-palates, previously 
blanched and stewed, sweetbread cut into dice, and mush- 
rooms, all stewed in good rich sauce ; place a layer upon the 
macaroni, then another layer of meat, and, until the pie is 
filled, add to it equal quantities of cream and gravy, cover it 
with a paste, and bake it, or omit the paste, and stew it before 
the fire in a Dutch oven. The macaroni may be mixed with 
grated Parmesan cheese. 

Another mode. — Swell 4 oz. of pipe macaroni in milk, with 
a large onion. Put a layer at the bottom of a pie-dish, with 
some bits of butter and scraped Parmesan cheese sprinkled 
lightly over. Cover the whole with a well-seasoned beef- 
steak cut small and thin, then some more macaroni, and then 
another layer of bee&teak ; cover the whole with macaroni, 
pieces of butter, and grated cheese, instead of crust. Bake in 
a slow oven. 

VERMICELLI 

501. — Ts of the same substance as macaroni, but made much 
smaller, and frequently put into meat soups as giving them addi- 
tional richness ; but in English kitchens it is too sparingly 
used. To be well made the soup should be thickened wili 
it, and for that purpose it is preferable to macaroni. 

Sejnolina is of the same material, but made into small 
grains, which more easily thicken the soup into whidi it is 
mixed : it can also be made into an excellent pudding with 
eggs and milk, using it instead of flour, for which, and pud- 
dings of macaroni and vermicelli, see Chapter on Puddings, 

It should be observed, as a general rule, that in using any 
of the Italian pastes — ^unless they should be sweetened — Par- 
mesan cheese should always form part of the dish, in the pro- 
portion of one-half the quantity to that of the paste. 

POLENTA 

502. — Is, in Italy, made from the flour of Indian com, 
but in this country is generally made of semolina, thus : — 

2 c 



386 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chaf. XXI. 

Put a little salt and 4 oz. of semolina into a quart of 
milk when it is beginning to boil, and let it continue to flim- 
mer for about 10 minutes, stirring it occasionally to guard it 
from burning. When well thickened, pour it into a dish to 
cool, and when quite cold it will be very solid : then cut it 
into slices of less than an inch thick, upon which put a large 
grating of good Parmesan cheese, for no other kind w^ 
answer the purpose ; nor should any spices be used, except a 
little mace ; nor even that, unless it be made (as sometimes 
done) with veal broth. Clarify a few ounces of fresh butter — 
though in Italy oil is always used — put a layer of the paste, 
powdered with the Parmesan, mixed with a little of the butter ; 
bake it for i an hour in a moderately heated oven, and serve 
it up quite hot, with a separate plate of the grated cheese. 



RICE. 

603. — ^There are but two sorts of rice in common use through- 
out the north of Europe, the Carolina and the Patna ; the 
one imported from America, and the other from the East 
Indies. The former is the whitest, the largest in grain, and 
the highest in price ; but in point of nutriment little better 
than the Patna. For curry or soup the Patna rice is the best. 
The boiling of rice requires 2 quarts of boiling water for each 
\ lb. ; the rice should first be washed in salt and water, and must 
be allowed to simmer for 20 minutes, but not be touched with 
hand or spoon, though it may be occasionally stirred with a 
large wooden fork to keep every grain separate ; it should 
then be drained through a colander and spread thinly to dry 
upon a napkin before the fire ; or put on a dish and set in the 
oven for a few minutes. 

For savoury dishes rice should be stewed in good gravy, 
seasoned with mace, cayenne, and salt, with the addition of 
fried onions, shalot, garlic, and pot-herbs, strained and used at 
pleasure. 

For sweet dishes, — Boil it with lemon-peel, cinnamon, or 
bay-leaves, and, when done to a proper consistency, add 
powdered sugar and cold butter, stirring it all the time till 
melted ; then pour in a little cream, and use it either as a 
covering for stewed fruits, or, if made thick enough, it may 



Chap. XXI.] RICE. 887 

be placed round the sides of a dish, leaving the middle hoUow 
for the sweets. The same plan may be adopted for aU sorts 
of meat, poultry, fish, fruit, and sweetmeats. The sugar 
should not be added until the rice is done, as it has a tendency 
to harden the grains. 

jRice h la PortugaUe, — ^In Portugal a veiy common mode 
of dressing rice is to stew it either in fowl broth or beef 
gravy, and boil it with tomatas, which give it a very pleasant 
acid. If in broth, only tomatas are used ; but if in gravy, 
onions are added well seasoned with salt and pepper, some* 
times with a dove of garlic. 

RICE FRITTERS. 

504. — ^Pare very thin the rind of a lemon, and boil it in 
milk, with sugar enough to sweeten it, and a cup of rice. 
When the rice is quite soft, take out the lemon-peel ; beat up 
the rice with a glass of brandy, shape it into firitters, brush 
them with yolks of eggsj cover them with briead-crumbs, fry 
them in lard, dust &em with fine sugar, and glaze with a 
salamander. 

Or : — ^Let the rice cool ; spread it out ^ inch thick, cut 
it in rounds with a 1^-inch cutter, make an opening and 
insert a piece of red-currant jelly, apple jelly, or a fine jam 
of any kind ; then egg and crumb, carefully closing the aper- 
ture that admitted the jam; fry in hot lard and glaze with fine 
sugar. 

Pancake, — ^Boil i lb. of rice to a jelly, in a small quantity 
of water : when cold, mix it with a pint of cream, 8 eggs, a 
bit of salt, and nutmeg ; stir in 8 oz. of butter just warmed, 
and add as much fiour as will make the batter thick enough. 
Fry in as little lard or dripping as possible. 

Or : — Mix the yolks of 2 well-beaten eggs with a pint of 
cream, 2 oz. of sifted sugar, a little nutmeg, cinnamon, and 
mace, or a few drops of oil of almonds. Rub the pan with a 
bit of butter, and fry the pancakes thin. 

RICE BALLS, 

606. — Pour upon i lb. of rice 3 pints of boiling milk, and 
boil it with a little cinnamon and lemon-peel until it is quite 
tender, then sweeten it ; allow it to remain until it is cold, 

2 c2. 



388 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Our. XXL 

and make it into balls. Beat up 2 egga, roll the balb in it, 
and afterwards in grated bread-crumba ; fry them in lard, 
drain tbem on a piece of paper, and serve uiem up corered 
with rafted sugar. 

CROQUETTES DE SIZ.—E.R. 
606. — Clean and wash 6 oz. of rice, put it into a stewpan 
with cold water, and, after it has boiled for about a minute, 
strain it ; then add twice the quantity of broth, and let it atew 
gently until the rice will break easily with a spoon. Should 
the liquor dry too much before the rice is soft enough, add a 
little more broth. Then work it well with a spoonful <^ white 
sauce, 2 spoonfuls of grated Parmesan cheese, and a very little 
white pepper. When of a sufficient consistence, make the 
rice into shapes, which may be done by hollowing them in the 
band to the fonn of a cop ;

when done. 

CASSEROLE DE RIZ AUX (EUFS.—E. R. 
507. — Clean, wash, and stew the rice, as in the former 
receipt ; woric it well with stock and an egg beaten, as the 
rice should be firm and well blended ; then make it into a 
wall, lining the inside of a mould of the requisite height : 
bake the casserole. Take the white portion of cold fowl, 
cold veal, or sweetbreads ; mince them finely, add some thick 
white sauce and mushrooms, fill the casserole, and cover the 
top with poached eggs ; cover them with glaze, and serve it 
up very hot

Or : — Soak some Carolina rice in water an hour, strain it, 
and put 2 spoonfuls of the rice into li pint of milk ; simmer 
till it will pulp through a sieve, then put the pulp and milk

a spoonful of peach-water, or a bitter almond beaten ; boil it, 
bat take care it does not bum ; pour it into a shape or pint 
basin, taking out the spice. When cold, turn the flummery 
into a dish, and serve with cream, milk, or custard, round ; or 
put a teacupful of cream into i pint of new milk, a glass of 
white wine, i a lemon squeezed, and sugar, and pour over it. 

jRice Paste. — ^Take ground rice and butter, work it like 
short crust, adding a little sugar to make it eat crisply, only 
using wheaten flour to roll it out with on the board ; more or 
less butter must be added, according to the richness required. 

Or, if for relishing things : — Clean and put some rice, with 
an onion, and a little water and milk, or milk only, into a 
saucepan, and simmer till it swells. Put seasoned chops into 
a dish, and cover it with the rice ; by the addition of an e^ 
the rice will adhere better. 



EGGS. 

510. — Eggs are in such general use that the celebrated 
^Almanach des Gourmands^ enumerates no less than 300 
different modes of serving them in France; and although 
either our deficiency in culinary science, or our want of gas- 
tronomic taste, precludes the entire catalogue from being here 



390 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXL 

inserted, yet sufficient receipts will, we trust, be fiiaod to 
gratify the palate of most of our readers. 

There are of course several sorts of eggs, according' to the 
species of poultry which produce them. The turkey egg is tbe 
largest and the most delicate, after which, in point of flavour, 
is the guinea-hen's, and, in that of size, those of the goose and 
duck. Although all these are employed in cookery, yet the 
eggs of the common '^ barn-door fowl " are those most generally 
us^ when served up separately and boiled in the shell, in 
which case the main point is their entif e fireshness. This can 
partly be judged of by putting them between you and the 
light, and seeing that the white is clear and the yolk un- 
clouded ; for although nothing can be more delicately nutri- 
tive when newly laid, few things can be more nauseous when 
they are stale. 

TO KEEP EGGS FOR WINTER USE. 

611. — Pour a full gallon of boiling water on 2 quarts of 
quicklime and i lb. of salt ; when cold, mix into it an ounce 
of cream of tartar. The day following put in the eggs. After 
the lime has been stirred well into the boiling water, a large 
part of it will settle at the bottom of the vessel, on which the 
eggs will remain. Keep them covered with the liquor, and 
they will keep for two years. 

TO ROIL EGGS. 

612. — To effect the simple process of boiling demands con- 
stant attention, as ^ a minute more or less may spoil the egg 
for a fastidious palate. There are various modes employed by 
diiferent cooks ; some putting them into cold water, and, when 
it boils, allowing the eggs to remain in it for a minute longer ; 
others taking them out immediately ; while others, again, prefer 
putting them into boiling water, and there leaving them until 
done. That time is most commonly 3 minutes, and seldom 
less ; but many persons object to their being left so soft, and 
4 or 5 minutes are not unusual if the eggs are not " new- 
laid." Ten minutes are required for making the yolks hard 
enough for salad, after which the eggs should be put for some 
time into cold water to harden, or the yolks will not readily 
incorporate with the condiments. 

It should however be understood that, in whatever way the 



Chap. XXI.] EGGS. 391 

egg is to be boiled, it should be completely covered with water ; 
that if put into the water while boUing, the shell is subject to 
being cracked ; and if boiled too suddenly, the white becomes 
bard, while the yolk remains comparatively soft. The cook 
should therefore be provided with minute glasses of various 
sizes — ^from 1 minute to 5 — ^to mark the time ; for they are 
more accurate than the hand of a kitchen dock, and do not 
require so much watching. 

TO POACH EGGS 

513. — ^Is to boil them without their shells^ and requires 
still greater care. The water must be perfectly pure^ or 
it will stain the white of the egg^ and the yolk must be only 
just so much done as to fix itself firmly in the centre of the 
white ; the egg, though required to be quite firesh, yet should 
not be poached on the same day on which it has been laid^ 
as, when in that milky state, the white aod yolk will not com* 
bine with the necessary degree of firmness ; they should be 
a couple of days old. 

Put a moderate quantity of water into a broad flat stewpan. 
French cooks add to it, when boiling, a spoonful of vinegat 
and a little salt. Take the pan ofi* the fire whilst putting in 
the eggs ; break the egg into a teacup or small ladle, and 
turn it gently into the water, so as to prevent the yolk firom 
being mixed with the white; let them stand till beginning 
to set ; then let the eggs boil gently until you perceive that 
they are done, by the white being set, and ^e yolk appearing 
through it in a comparatively soft state ; then take each from 
the water with an egg-slice, and pare off any ragged edges 
which may appear around it, before sending to table. This 
latter operation, however, if not quickly done, cools the ^g, 
which ought to be served quite hot, to avoid which incon- 
venience, a little machine for poaching has been invented in 
France. A tin cup large enough to contain the egg when 
poached is perforated with several holes; and being placed 
in the boiling water, the egg is broken into it, but, when taken 
up, retains its roundness without cutting. It has, however^ 
the imperfection of not allowing the egg to slide from the cup 
to any substance on which it is to be placed. This, however, 
may be easily rectified by turning the egg over upon the toast, 
which, if carefully done, answers quite as well. The larger

It k fixed upon trivets, and not deeper than a drippiiig>-paB ; 
bat each small machine being famished with a iMfcT^^U, a

chooses. 

Poached eggs are commonly placed apon battered toMt, 
broiled ham, or boiled spinach ; but in France they are not 
anoommonly served in a consomm^ of beefl Indeed, we have 
there seen them brought up singly, in tablespoons filled with 
the gravy, and each swallowed up at a mouthful ! 

OMELETTE. 

514.— In France, and indeed throu^umt the Continent, this 
is the most usual mode of dressing eggs, after that of bculing 
them in the shell, as being in small fanulies a sure resource to 
fidl back upon in cases of emergency. It is, however, extrar 
ordinary that, in England, scarcely any of the conmion cooks 
succeed in bringing them to table nicely dressed, thoagh 
nothing can be more simple. In the ordinary way the eggs 
are made into a batter ; but if time be allowed, this should be 
done some hours before the omelet is wanted, and the batter 
again whisked up just before it is to be dressed. 

Four eggs will make a very pretty-sized omelet, but the 
number of eggs must of course depend on the size required. 
If sweet herfa^ be put in, a good deal of parsley should form 
part ; tarragon gives a high flavour, and chives or shalots are 
not unfrequently used, but care should be taken that the 
flavour should not supersede that of the other ingredients. 

Omelets are judiciously varied by mixing grated ham or 
tongue with minced anchovies, when served at supper or as a 
side-dish at dinner ; but when intended for the break&st-table, 
it is more delicate to make them of eggs alone. 

Although a common frying-pan may be used, yet one made 
on purpose, not larger than the size of a dessert-plate, should 
be employed, so as not to allow the omelet too much spread- 
ing, for it should always be kept of a certain de^ee of thick- 
ness to secure the softness of the inside. It is therefore only 
to be fried on one side, and when the under is browned and 
the upper brought to a moderate state of consistence, the fried 
side is to be folded over the other in three. 

Butter is better than either lard or dripping for the fiying 



Oeap. XXI.] EQOS. 898 

of an <mielet. Any sort of pot-herbs is admissible ; and many 
sorts of minced fowl and fish are prepared in Uiat manner 
throughoat the Continent. There are hundreds of receipts for 
omelets, but the principle is the same in all, the difference 
being only in the flavouring. 

OMELETTE AU NA TUREL. 

515. — ^Take 4 eggs, beat the yolks and whites together with 
a tablespoonful of milk, a little salt and peppeir ; put 2 oz. of 
butter into a frying-pan to boil, and let it remain until it 
b^ins to brown ; pour the batter into it, and let it remain 
quiet for a minute ; turn up the edges of the omelet g^itly 
from the bottom of the pan with a fork ; shake it, to keep it 
from burning at the bottom, and fry it till of a bright brown. 
It will not take more than 5 minutes frying. 

Aux fines Herbes. — ^Beat up 4 eggs with a little cream, salt, 
pepper, chives, and parsley, minced very small. Put a piece 
of butter half the size of an egg into the frying-pan ; let it 
b^in to brown; pour in the omelet, and allow it to set a 
litUe ; then raise it round the edge, to allow more of the 
mixture to become brown. When that is done, turn it over to 
double it ; but as in browning the lower side the upper wiU 
sometimes appear too soft, in that case make a slight use of 
the salamander, to give it firmness; put the di^ on the 
frying-pan, and turn it over. Xiet the fire be dear, but not 
too hot. 

Or : — Take 4 eggs and 4 tablespoonfuls of milk, well beaten 
together ; add one tablespoonful of parsley chopped very fine, 
a little lemon-thyme, marjoram, or tarragon, a teaspoonful of 
graJted onion, a Uttle essence of anchovies or Reading sauce, 
and a few grains of cayenne pepper ; fry quickly, and fold it 
in three; put a little clear gravy in Uie dish. This is an 
excellent receipt. 

Aux Confitures. — ^Beat up 8 eggs with a tablespoonful 
of powdered sugar, a little nutmeg, a pinch of salt, some 
finely-chopped lemon-peel, and a wineglass of cream, or about 
i oz. of butter. Make an omelet-pan hot, put in a small piece 
of butter, and, when the eggs are thoroughly mixed, pour 
them into the pan ; stir it about, and, when set, arrange the 
omelet neatly iQ the pan ; lay on 2 spoonfuls of jam, roll it 
up, and glaze it with sugar and the salamander. Any of 



894 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXL 

the presenred fruits, when prepared as jam, will answer the 
purpose. 

Une OmeUUe aux Amandes is also looked upon as a ddi- 
cacy, and made by substituting almond-flour, or pounded sweet 
almonds, for jam. 

Une Omelette (THidtres may be made with 4 raw egg^ a 
little cream, beaten up either with or without swe^ herbs and 
grated ham, but seasoned with a little salt, pepper, and nutmi^, 
together with a dozen of oysters bearded, dried, minced very 
small, and fried in butter. 

Omelette a la Tartare. — Steam 2 handfuls of sorrel, and, 
having picked and chopped it, stew it in gravy with a Htde 
butter and cayenne pepper ; put it into a plam omelet, and 
cover the whole with grated bread, grated Parmesan cheese, 
and a little melted butter ; make an edging all round with 
fried bread, and brown the top with a salamander. 

OMELETTE SOUFFLEE. 

516. — Take 6 eggs, separate the whites from the yolks, add 
to the yolks a tablespoonful of arrowroot or potato-flour, 6 ox. 
of pounded loaf-sugar, some grated lemon-peel, and a small 
quantity of lemon-zest, or dbopped peel, or orange-flower 
water. Beat the whole together for several minutes, until 
they are made into a batter, and then whip the whites until 
they become a froth ; stir in lightly the batter. BEave ready 
an omelet-pan of the proper size heated upon the stove ; put 
into it i lb. of butter, and when it begins to boil put the whole 
into the pan, and stir it with a spoon care&lly until it becomes 
partially Arm. That done, turn it out upon a small circular 
dish, of silver or metal, as the omelet ought to acquire ihe 
form of a dome, and the dish be placed in a very moderately 
heated oven for at least 10 minutes or i of an hour, according 
to the care and nicety with which it has been made ; after 
which it will have risen into a puif of considerable height, 
similar to the feshionable supper dish, '^ trifle." It should 
then be sprinkled with a little powdered sugar, the salamander 
held over it, and be served immediately, or it will soon be- 
come flat in flavour and appearance. 

Souffli JFrangaise,— 'Tut into a stewpan 1 oz. of butter ; 
when melted, add 2 tablespoonfuls of flour; stir them well 
over the fire, so that the flour be thoroughly cooked, but not 



Chap. XXL] EQOS. 895 

coloured ; add by d^rees a wineglass of boilii^ creamy and 
four times tbat quantity of boiling milk ; work it quite smooth, 
take it off the fire, add 4 yolks of eggs, sugar to palate, a 
grain of salt, and a tablespoonful of orange^ower water ; 
whip up strongly the whites of 8 eggs, mix them lightly in 
the batter, put the whole into a souffle^lish, and bake for an 
hour. 

The flavour of this souffle may be varied according to &ncy, 
omitting the orange-flower water, and substituting either va» 
nilla, cura^oa, noyeau, maraschino, chocolate, coffee, &c. 

(EUF8 BROUILLilS. 

517. — ^Break 4 or 6 eggs ; beat them and put them into a 
saucepan with a piece of butter, a little salt, and a spoonful 
of sauce or gravy, which makes the ^gs softer ; stir them 
over the fire until sufficiently thick ; serve on a plate garnished 
with toasted bread. To eggs dressed this way, truffles, ham, 
mushrooms, &c., minced, may be added. The difference be- 
tween this and an omelet is, that an omelet is compact and 
turns out smooth, whereas ceufs hrouilUs are less done, and are 
therefore broken. 

In Ireland, where it is in general use, it is usually served 
upon hot buttered toast, and is there called ^^ buttered eggs" 
It is also very common in France, where it is usually served 
for break&st. 

Or : — ^Butter a dish well, sprinkle it with salt, then break 
the eggs very carefully so as not to disturb the yolk ; add a 
little more salt and some white pepper ; mj^lt a small quantity 
of butter, pour it gently over, with 1 or 2 spoonfids of cream. 
Put the dish over a slow fire, and finish the ^gs by covering 
them with a red-hot shovel. 

A very pretty dish of Eggs is made thtis : — ^Break some eggs 
into a small tart-dish, without injuring the yolks, or laying 
one over the other. Drop on them some warm butter, and 
lightly strew crumbs of bread. Put it in the oven until the 
whites be set, and serve with a wreath of parsley round the 
edge. 

JEggs aux fines Herhes. — ^Poach 4 eggs carefolly, put them 
upon the dish, and pour over them the following sauce : — a 
glass of white wine, with some chopped parsley, chiv€», salt 
and pepper, and a piece of butter rolled in flour. Let 




396 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXI 

for 10 minutes ; pour it over the eggs ; cover the whole nitk 
bread-crumbsy dried and browned. 

Burnt buttered Eggs. — Bum the butter in a fiying-pan; 
break the eggs upon a dish, preserving them whole, as if 
intended to be poached ; season them with salt and a Iitde 
nutmeg ; pour a part of the burnt butter boiling hot over fltt 
eggs, and then slide them over the rest of the butter; pat 
them on a slow fire, and finish by browning them with a led- 
hot shovel or salamander. 

EGGS A LA DUCHESSE, 

518. — Boil 2 quarts of milk with 2 laurel or bay leaves, 
some cinnamon, and green lemon-peel ; when the milk is well- 
flavoured, strain into a shallow stewpan, and keep it boiling; 
whip up the whites of 3 eggs to a strong froth or snow, as it is 
technically called; take a tablespoonfril, and drop into the 
boiling milk ; when all the eggs are in, turn them, and they 
are done ; take them up, drain them, and put into a deep dish; 
thicken some of the milk with arrowroot, and pour over the 
eggs. 

WHITE FRICASSEE OF EGGS^—E, R. 

519. — Put 2 oz. of butter into a stewpan, and when melted 
add chopped parsley, a small piece of shalot chopped finely, 
and mushrooms also chopped, with pepper and salt. Stew 
till the seasoning is done, then add a cupful of cream; 
add sufficient flour to thicken the sauce, and boil it well. 
Boil 4 or 6 eggs ,hard, and cut them into slices — each ^g 
should make 5 or 6; lay the eggs in, give it a boil, and 
serve up. 

A brown fricassee is made the same way, with good rich 
brown gravy instead of cream. 

EGG ALB,—E. R. 

620. — ^Boil 6 eggs until very hard, remove the shells, and 
cut them across, preserving the whites in the form of cups ; 
mince the yolks in small cubes with cold ham, parsley, and 
salt ; mix the minced ingredients with cream until they form 
a thick paste, but do not break the little cubes ; then fill the 
cups formed of the whites with this compound, heaped up in 
the middle, cutting ofl* a piece from the round end to make 



Chap. XXI.] EGGS. 397 

them stand ; place them in a dish, and pour white sauce over 
them. 

Or : — Boil the ^gs hard, taking off the shells carefully ; 
then cut them in halves lengthwise ; take out the yolks ; soak 
some bread-crumbs in milk, press it rather dry, add salt, 
pepper, and nutmeg, a little chopped parsley, and the yolks of 
the ^gs rubbed into a lump of butter ; mix tiiese well together, 
and moisten with cream ; fill the whites to make up the shape 
of an egg J strew them with bread-crumbs, and £ry in butter to 
a light brown. Serve up quite hot. 

Or : — ^Boil eggs hard ; when cold cut the whites in halves, 
put the yolk entire into one half, cover it with forcemeat, 
lay the white upon its back and fry it ; or pound the yolk 
and forcemeat together until they form a paste, and fill up 
the cavity of the white; serve with either brown or white 
sauce. 

A la CarmilUe^ — ^Boil 6 eggs hard, cut them in halves the 
long way, take out the yolks and chop them very fine with 
parsley, sorrel, and boiled onions; season with pepper and 
salt; mix them up with a little melted butter, and fill the 
whites ; heat them until thoroughly hot in white sauce made 
thus : — Take i pint of cream, seasoned with a blade of mace ; 
melt in it 2 oz. of butter ; stir it very well, adding sufficient 
flour to keep the butter from oiling, and just before dishing 
squeeze in a little lemon-juice. 

A la Gruyere, — ^Put i lb. of Gruyere cheese into a stew- 
pan with a small piece of butter, some chives and parsley 
chopped fine, a very little grated nutm^, some salt, and i a 
teacupful of veal-stock ; set it over a gentle fire, and stir it 
till the cheese is melted. Beat up 4 ^gs, and set it over the 
fire again ; stir it till sufficiently done, then take it off, and 
garnish with sippets of toasted bread. 

(EUF8 FARCIS, 

521. — ^Boil 6 eggs hard, remove the shells, but leave the ^gs 
whole ; cover them with a rich forcemeat made with scraped 
ham, pounded anchovy, pounded veal, and bacon fat, well 
pounded together and highly seasoned ; brush them with the 
yolk of egg, and dredge them with bread-crumbs or vermicelli ; 
fry them a pale gold colour, or put them for i of an hour in 
an oven, and serve them up with gravy in the dish. 




898 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXL 

En Ptir^.— -Boil 6 eggs hard ; when cold take out te 
yolks and beat them in a mortar, with butter, salt, nutmeg, 
pepper, and minced parsley, adding 3 raw yolks ; chop t£e 
wMtes very small, and put them into a stewpan with some 
good gravy ; do not let them boil, but shake them until tiiqr 
have a consistence ; then place them round the dish thej are 
to be served in. Take the yolks out of the mortar, and patt 
them through a colander into the same dish; garnish widi 
bread dipped in yolks of eggs. Place the dish in an oven, and 
when Ughdy browned it wiU be done. 

CEufs 8ur le plat is a Grerman mode of £rying an egg hj 
means of a small cheese-plate, which, being thoroughly warmed, 
is greased in the indented part with a bit of butter or a veiy 
little sweet-oil, and into this part the egg is broken £rom the 
shell, thus retaining the exact rotundity of the plate, which is 
then placed upon Qie gridiron over a good fire. It may be 
slightly browned, if thought fit, with a salamander, but does 
not need it ; and though quite as delicate, yet renders the egg 
rather more savoury than by poaching. 

EGGS AND VEGETABLES. 

622. — JEggs and Spinach, — Poach half a dozen eggs, trim 
them nicely, and serve them upon stewed spinach. 

JBggs and Onions, or a la Tripe, — Skin 6 or 8 onions, 
mince them, put some butter into a stewpan and melt it, add 
about 2 spoonfuls of flour, mix both well together, then add 
the onions, and wet them with milk, cream, or water ; let them 
stew, taking care that the onions and butter do not become 
brown ; season with a little salt and white pepper ; cut some 
hard eggs into slices, and when the sauce is ready put them in ; 
make the whole very hot, and serve it up. 

Or : — Slice some onions very finely, pepper them well with 
cayenne pepper, and fry them in butter ; take them out of 
the pan, drain them before the fire from the fat, put them on 
a dish, and squeeze lemon-juice over them sufl[icient to satu- 
rate and render them very acid. Fry or poach 6 eggs, trim 
them nicely, lay them upon the onions, and serve them very 
hot. 

CEufs a la Frcmgaise, — A very common way of dressing 
eggs in France is to put a piece of butter in a stewpan wi<h 
some green onions chopped fine, and a little minced parsley ; 



Cbap. XXI.] CHEESE. 899 

shake a little flour over them, and add a teaeupful of good 
broth ; stir it over the fire till it becomes of a proper thickaess, 
and skim it well ; put in some eggs boiled hard and sliced, 
some salt, and a little cayenne ; b^t up the yolk of an egg 
with a small teaeupful of cream, add this to the other ingre- 
dients with the juice of ^ a lemon, let all boil together a few 
minutes, and serve hot with sippets of bread. 

Eggs and Asparagtu. — Cut some of the thin green aspa- 
ragus to the size of small peas, boil them quickly, and diain 
them. Beat up some eggs with a little pepper and salt, and 
put them into the stewpan with the asparagus ; add a good 
piece of fresh butter, and keep stirring it as long as it is on the 
fire to prevent it from burning ; when sufficiently thick take it 
ofl*, spread a piece of thick uSst in a dish, and pour over it the 
asparagus and eggs. 

JBggs and Artichokes are also very nice as an entr^ at 
dinner, or a comer dish at a supper-table. The bottomsj after 
being stripped of the leaves, to be boiled in hard water, and, 
when sufficiently done, place on each the half of a hard egg^ 
leaving the round end uppermost. They may be eaten either 
cold or hot ; if cold, covered with cream seasoned only with 
a little nutmeg ; or, if hoty either with melted butter or rich 
gravy. 



CHEESE. 

EGGS AND CHEESE 

623. — ^Are mixed together in various ways by French cooks 
under the names oifondus or fondeatix, ram^quins, and other 
titles, for the purposes of preparing entremets^ or side-dishes, 
for elegant tables. 

Gruyere and Parmesan are the most proper sorts to be thus 
used, but any dry cheese, of good flavour, may be employed. 

FOND E A U. 

624. — Slice a stale penny roll ; pour over it \ pint of boiling 
milk ; when soaked, beat it well, and mix with it \ lb. each ^ 
Cheshire and double Gloucester cheese finely grated, with the 
yolks of 4 eggs well whisked. All this maybe prepared when 

A 



400 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Cbap. XXL 

most convenient; immediately before it is wanted beat the 
whites of the 4 eggs into a solid froth and add them ; pour tiie 
whole into the paper forms, and bake them to your taste. 

A ritalienne. — Mix ^ pint of cream with a little flour and 
a little salt ; keep stirring it over the fire mitil it is as thick as 
melted butter ; then add about i lb. of Parmesan cheese findj 
grated. Mix it all well together until it is half cold ; then take 
4 eggs, separate the yolks from the whites, put the former to 
the cheese, and beat it well together. Then beat the whites to a 
solid froth, and add them to the rest ; pour the mixture into an 
ornamented mould or a deep dish lined with paper, cut in a 
fringe at the top, and only half filled, as it will rise very high. 
The oven must be very hot, in order to cause the rising, iumI 
the dish must be served immediately, or it will fall ; to prevent 
which, let the cover be of metal, strongly heated : 20 minutes 
ought to bake it. 

• JBn caisses, — Take i lb. of Swiss cheese, 2 oz. of Parme- 
san, and a piece of cream-cheese ; pound the whole in a mortar 
with a little pepper and salt, then mix in 4 or 5 eggs, one at a 
time ; fill 12 small paper cases, and put them for a ^ort time 
in the oven to give a fine colour. Ten minutes will bake them 
in a Dutch oven placed before a good fire. 

Fondeaux of a small size may be made in either of the above 
modes, and put into little paper moulds of any fancied form, 
but only half filled. 

RAME QUINS.— E. R. 

525. — Take 2 eggs, 2 spoonfuls of flour, 2 oz. of melted 
butter, and 2 of grated cheese ; mix all well together, and 
bake it in moulds or tart-pans for i of an hour. 

A la Parisienne. — Boil i pint of milk and half the quan- 
tity of cream ; melt 1 oz. of butter and a little salt ; mix in a 
spoonful of flour, and stir it over the fire for 5 minutes ; pour 
in the milk and cream by degrees, and work it smooth, taking 
care that it is thoroughly cooked. Then take it oflP, and add 
i lb. of grated cheese, some coarse ground pepper, and an atom 
of nutmeg, with a very little powdered sugar, the yolks of 8 
eggs, and the whites of 2, well beaten ; when perfectly mixed, 
add the whites of 6 eggs beaten to a froth. The batter 
should be as thick as cream. Make little paper trays, fill 



CHiLP. XXI.] CHEESE. 401 

them 3 parts full, and bake them in a very slow oven 18 
minutes. 

JFried Ramiquins. — Grate i lb. of cheese, and melt 2 oz, 
of butter ; when the latter is getting cool, mix it with the 
cheese and the whites of 3 ^gs well beaten. Lay buttered 
papers on a frying->pan, put slices of bread upon it, and lay 
the cheese on the top ; set it on the fire for about 5 minutes, 
then take it off, and brown it with a salamander. 

Dutch Ramiquin, — Scrape some old Cheshire cheese, pound 
it, with a lump of butter and the yolk of an ^g boiled hard, 
in a marble mortar. When very well mixed, and quite smooth, 
spread it on slices of toasted bread and butter ; hold a salaman- 
der over them, and serve them quite hot. 

With Wine or Ale, — Scrape i lb. of Cheshire and the same 
of Gloucester cheese ; melt, without oiling, i lb. of butter ; 
then beat all in a mortar with the yolks of 4 eggs, the inside 
of a French roll boiled in milk, and a wineglass of wine or ale. 
When thoroughly mixed, add the whites of the ^gs, previ- 
ously beaten to a froth. Put the composition into paper cases, 
rather long than square, and bake them in a Dutch oven. 

STEWED CHEESE.— E. R. 

626. — Grate 2 oz. of cheese ; put it into a basin ; mix with 
it a small teacupful of cream and an egg beaten and strained. 
Put into a small saucepan 1 oz. or ^ oz. of butter, according 
to the richness of the cheese ; let it melt, then stir in the other 
ingredients, and let it boil until well mixed. Serve it hot 
either browned or plain. The brown looks prettier, but the 
plain eats better. 

With Ale.— ^Cnt the cheese into slices, pare off the rind, 
and put it into a dish over a lamp ; then pour on as much ale 
as will cover it, and let it stew until the cheese is dissolved. 
This is a Welsh method, and a very good one. The cheese 
may be spread with mustard. 

A very delicious sort of paste may also be made of any of the 
rich cheeses, Neufchdtel, jfromage de Brie^ or Stilton, stewed 
with cream and yolk of egg, either seasoned savourily or sweet- 
ened ; and eaten hot or cold. 

WELSH RABBIT 

527. — Should be made of the most mellow Gloucester cheese. 

2 D 



402 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXI. 

Put it into a saucepan with about 1 oz. of butter and a very little 
ale ; stir it over the fire until the cheese is quite dissoWed ; 
then take it off, add an egg well beaten, dish it, and brown it 
before the fire. 

Rasp some toasting cheese with a bit of butter into a cheese- 
toaster, and, when the cheese dissolves before the fire, put it 
upon thin slices of buttered toast, of which the crust has beei 
cut off. Serve it very hot, or the cheese will become tough; 
and eat it with pepper, salt, and mustard. 

Toast and Cheese. — You may also take some old Cheshire, 
with a lump of butter and the yolk of a hard-boiled egg ; beat 
them into a paste, which spread upon slices of buttered toast, 
and hold a salamander over them until the paste is browned 
and melted. The paste may also be spread between thin slices 
of bread and butter, and eaten cold, as a sandwich. 

A Cheese Pudding. — Grate 3 oz. of cheese and 5 of bread ; 
and having warmed 1 oz. of butter in J pint of new milk, 
mix it with the above ; add 2 well-beaten eggs and a little 
salt. Bake it ^ an hour. 

This is a nice way of finishing up a cheese when little but 
the rind is left. 



— ♦■ 



PANCAKES AND FRITTERS. 

628. — Although egg forms the chief foundation of all pan- 
cakes, they are yet made in various ways accordmg to different 
tastes and countries. 

Take 1 lb. of flour ; mix it with 6 eggs, a tablespoonful of 
brandy, a good pinch of salt, 2 tablespoonfuls of orange-flower 
water, and the same quantity of milk and water, or as much 
as will give the batter a proper consistency ; melt a piece of 
butter or lard in a frying-pan, pour in as much batter as will 
cover the pan ; when brown on one side, with a knife loosen 
the edges of the pancake all round, and turn and brown it on 
the other side ; roll each pancake up, and send them to table 
very hot, powdered with sugar. 

Hand round sugar, either raw or pounded, together with 
lemon and Seville orange. 

Or, 1 lb. of flour, 1 quart of milk, 6 eggs, i oz. of salt, 
4 oz. of pounded sugar, and peel of 1 lemon grated, with 



Chap. XXL] PANCAKES AND FRITTEES. 408 

pounded sweet spice, or not, according to fancy ; fry ad usual, 
and serve each separately on a plate. 

The common sort are composed of a light batter^ made 
of eggs, flour, and milk, £ried in hot dripping or lard, only 
half the whites of the eggs being generally used ; but salt^ 
or nutmeg, and ginger, may be added, and sugar and lemon 
should be served to eat with them. Or, when eggs are scarce^ 
make the batter with flour and small beer, ginger, &c. ; or 
dean snow, with flour, and a very little milk, will serve as 
well as eggs. If the family be large, beat 8 yolks and 4 whites 
of eggs, strain them into a pint of cream, put a grated nutmeg, 
and sugar to your taste : set 8 oz. of fi*e»h butter on the fire^ 
stir it, and as it warms pour it to the cream, which should be 
warm when the eggs are put to it ; then mix smooth almogt 
i lb. of flour. Fry the pancakes very thin ; the first with a 
bit of butter, but not the others. Serve several on one another, 
but at two or three different times, " hot and hot/' 

A better sort may be made with 8 eggs to a pint of milk and 
3 oz. of butter melted, and poured in with either a large glass 
of wine or brandy ; garnish with lemons. 

A still ^ner kind are fried without butter or lard, as thus : — 
Beat 6 fresh eggs extremely well ; mix, when strained, with a 
pint of cream, ^4 oz. of sugar, a glass of good French brandy, 
^ nutmeg grated, the grated rind of a whole lemon, and as 
much flour as will make it almost as thick as ordinary pancake- 
batter, but not quite. Heat the frying-pan tolerably hot, wipe 
it with a clean cloth ; then pour in the batter to make thin 
pancakes. 

APPLE PANCAKES, 

629. — Mix 2 large spoonfuls of flour in a cup of milk or wine ; 
when smooth add 8 eggs, some pounded cinnamon, grated 
lemon-peel, a handful of currants, and 6 or 8 apples peeled 
and chopped : mix it all well together ; melt some butter in 
a frying-pan ; when hot pour the whole mass in, and fry it on 
both sides : serve it strewed with pounded cinnamon and sugar 
very hot. 

NEJF ENGLAND PANCAKES* 

630. — Mix a pint of cream, 5 spoonfuls of fine flour, 7 yolks 
and 4 whites of eggs, and a very little salt ; fry them very thin 
in fresh butter, and between each strew sugar and cinnamon. 
Send up 6 or 8 at once.

Dutch Pancakes. — Mix 1 lb. of flour with i lb. of sugar 
and a tablespoonful of cinnamon in powder ; make it into a 
paste with 10 eggs and 2 glasses of white wine, or 1 each of 
wine and brandy ; when well mixed, roll it out and firy like 
other pancakes. 

French Pancakes. — Three small spoonfuls of flour mixed 
with 4 pint of cream, the yolks of 6 eggs, and 1 oz. of butter 
broken into very small pieces ; the whites of the eggs to be 
whipped to a strong froth, well mixed with the other ingre- 
dients when ready to be fried. 

Very little butter is required to fry these pancakes ; nor are 
they to be fried like the other sorts ; but they must be turned 
one upon the other from the pan, sifting sugar over each as it 
is turned. They require but little time in doing, but must not 
be left for an instant till they are sent to table. 

A la Polonaise. — Mix up 8 eggs with H pint of cream or 
flour and milk, and 2 oz. of melted fresh butter, seasoned with 
grated nutmeg, raspings of lemon-peel, and sugar, a little salt, 
and 10 oz. of flour. Put into the frying-pan a little butter or 
hog's lard, as for the French pancakes ; and, when the batter 
is thrown in, sprinkle it with currants, and powder it with 
sugar when going to table; or you may spread them with 
jelly, marmalade, or sweetmeats, and serve tkem up in that 
fashion ; or rolled up, and put into the Dutch oven until nicely 
browned, in the manner of fritters.* 

TALIANI.—E. R. 

531. — Take 3 eggs, a little salt, and as much flour as will 
make a stiff* paste ; then break it into 2 pieces, and roll it out 
as thin as possible. Lay a clean cloth on the table, and with 
the hand spread out the paste as thin as a leaf. Let it remain 
on the cloth for 2 hours, then fold up the sheets and cut it into 
narrow strips. Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, put a 
little salt into it, then put in the taliani, and let it boil for 10 
minutes, stirring the water about as it boils with a fork. Strain 
the water through a colander, and when the taliani is drained 
dry, put it into a dish with a sauce made of a little brown 
gravy and a lump of butter.

FRITTEBSf 

532. — ^Although a species of pancakes, are yet not so wholly 
composed of egga, and may be made of almost any substanoe 
fried in butter. Make them of any of the batters directed for 
pancakes, by dropping a small quantity into the pan ; or beat 
6 eggs very lightly and quickly in a quart of milk, adding gra*' 
dually i lb. of potato^flour. Have ready a large quantity of 
lard, and when boiling hot put in the batter, allowing for each 
fritter i a large teacupful. They do not require turning, and 
wiU be done in a few minutes, but must be sent to table imme* 
diately, or they will become heavy : 1^ lb. of lard will be 
required for the above quantity of fritters ; they may be eaJtesa 
plunly powdered with loaf sugar or sugar and cinnamon, and 
should be served on a folded napkin in the dish. Any sort of 
sweetmeat or ripe fruit may be made into fritters. 

For plain Fritters, — Grate the crumb of a penny loaf, put 
it into a pint of milk over the fire, and beat it very smooth ; 
when cold, add the yolks of 5 eggs, 3 oz. of sifted sugar, and 
^ a nutmeg. Fry them in hog's lard, and serve puddii^Hsauce 
in a boat. 

Apple Fritters, — ^Take the yolks of 6 eggs, and the whites 
of 3 ; beat them well, and strain them ; &ien add a pint of 
milk, a little salt, i a nutmeg grated, and a glass of brandy. 
Make it into thick batter with fine flour ; slice the apples in' 
rounds, cut out the core, dust them with fine sugar, and let 
them so remain for 2 hours ; then dip each slice in batter, and 
fry them in plenty of boiling lard over a quick fire. They 
require lard sufficient to swim in. Glaze with sugar. 

Or : — Make a batter as thick as paste, of 1 tablespoonful 
of olive-oil, a little salt, the yolks of 4 eggs, a spoonful of 
orange-flower water, with as much flour as will thicken it ; 
beat the whites of 2 eggs to snow, and slice it lightly in. 
This batter ought to be made an hour or two before it is 
used, that it may become lighter by fermentation. Put the 
fruit, well covered with this batter, into hot lard or butter, and 
fry. If the fritters are required to be unusually good, let the 
fruit marinate in brandy and sugar some hours before frying* 
Take the fritters out when of a fine light yellow, let them drain 
on a coarse cloth, sprinkle them with sugar, and serve quite hot.

spoonfuls of arrowroot, and sugar to palate ; stir it well over 
the fire, and add the yolks of 4 eggs, 2 oz. of chopped almonds^ 
and a wineglass of cream. Cook the whole over the fiire iat 
about 4 minutes, stirring it all the time ; then pour it on a tin 
which has been well buttered, spread it about i inch thick, 
put it into the oven for 10 minutes, let it get thoroughly cool, 
cut out with a round cutter, dip into fine bread*crumbs, then 
into egg beat up very thin, and again into crumbs ; fry in hot 
lard ; dust over with sugar, and send to table. 

Spanish Fritters. — Cut the crumb of a French roll into 
lengths, as thick as your finger, in what shape you will. Soak 
in some cream, nutmeg, sugar, pounded cinnamon, and an egg. 
When well soaked, fry of a nice brown, and serve with butter, 
wine, and sugarnsauce. 

French Fritters, — Mix 2 eggs, well beaten and strained, 
with as much new milk and flour as shall make 1 thick pan- 
cake, which fry as pale as you can. Pound it in a mortar 
quite smooth, and add the yolks of 4 and whites of 2 eggs, 1 
large spoonful of orange-flower water or cinnamon-water, 1 osb. 
of blanched almonds beaten to a paste, 2 oz. of ^hite sugar, 
and ^ of a small nutmeg. Pound it all till it become smooth 
batter. Have ready a large stewpan half full of fine lard 
quite hot, and drop the batter into it, the size of large nuts, 
until the surface be filled : as they brown, turn them : they 
will be very large : when done, remove them on clean paper, 
in a dish before the fire, and do the remainder. Serve as 
quickly as possibly. They are excellent. 

Italian Fritters. — ^Throughout Italy fritters are almost daily 
served at all good tables, and made of livers of fowls, sweet- 
bread, brains, and various articles, there called '^frutti di 
mare," collected on the sea-shores from the tribes of small fish, 
muscles, crabs, and shell-fish, which there abound, and mixed 
together in different ways, fish, fowl, and fruit, all firied in oil 
or batter. 

Potato Fritters. — ^Boil 2 large potatoes, scrape them fine ; 
beat 4 yolks and 3 whites of eggs, and add 1 large spoonful of 
cream, another of sweet wine, a squeeze of lemon, and a little 
nutmeg. Beat thb batter i an hour at least. It will be ex- 
tremely light. Put a good quantity of fine lard in a stewpan, 
and drop a spoonful of the batter at a time into it. Fry them,

and serve, as a sauce, a glass of white wine, thejuiceofalemon, 

1 desertspoonful of peach*leaf or almond water, and some white 
sugar, warmed together. Not to be served in the dish. 

Or : — Slice potatoes thin, dip them in a fine batter, and fiy. 
Serve with white sugar sifted over them. Lemon-peel and a 
spoonful of orange*flower water should be added to the batter, 

Or : — ^Boil 1 lb. of floury potatoes, bruise them in a mortar, 
and add to them 2 oz. of butter, with the yolks of a couple of 
eggs seasoned with a little pepper and salt. Mix all well 
together ; roll it into balls tiie size of an egg^ and fry them 
brown. Some persons like the addition of a finely minced 
(shalot. 

Buckwheat Fritters^ or ^^ JBockings.*' — Mix 3 oz. of buck* 
wheat fiour with a teacupful of warm milk and a spoonful of 
yeast ; let it rise before the fire about an hour ; then mix 4 
eggs, well beaten, and as much milk as will make the batter 
the usual thickness for pancakes, and fry them in-ihe same way* 

Curd Fritters. — Bub down in a mortar a quart of dried 
curd, with the yolks of 8 and whites of 4 well-beaten eggs, 

2 oz. of sifted sugar, i a nutmeg, and i a spoonful of flour. 
Drop the batter into a frying-pan, with a little butter or fine 
lard. 

Orange and Sweetmeat Fritters, — ^Take off the rind of 2 
oranges, removing all the white skin ; then cut the oranges in 
slices across, and take out all the pips ; dip the slices of orange 
in batter, as for apple fritters, and fry them. Serve with pow- 
dered sugar upon each fritter. 

Coloured Fritters, — Boil a large beet-root until it is tender ; 
beat it fine in a marble mortar. Add the yolks of 4 eggs, 2 
spoonfuls of flour and 3 of cream, the juice and peel of i a 
lemon, ^ a nutmeg, and a glass of brandy. Mix all well 
together, and fry the fritters in butter. Garnish them with 
green sweetmeats, preserved apricots, or sprigs of myrtle.

parsley, and chives, shred fine, and chopped mushroom. To 
this batter add also some of the kidney with the fat of a loin 
of veal minced ; mix all thoroughly together ; rub the pan 
well with butter, and pour in the ingredients. Keep stirring

it while it 18 on the fire or stove, so as to keep it fiom spnmdaa^ 
out too thin. When sufficiently done, make it of a light iMrown 
by means of a salamander, or by holding it for a miniite or two 
before the fire. 

Oyster Frittert. — Beard the oysters, dip them into a tiiick 
batter, made rich with e^j or, what is better, into an omeletie, 
and then in crumbs of breeul ; £ry them : they are an exodlent 
garnish for fried fish. 

BEIGNET. 

534. — ^Mix and work well together ^ lb. of floor and 2 
oz. of butter, or 3 tablespoonfiils of sweet oil, and make it into 
a batter with some warm water ; then mix into the batter a 
couple of raw eggs, keeping the yolk of 1 for browning. The 
materials may thus be niade of any degree of consist^ice, so as 
to act as thick batter, or as thin paste by the additicm of a 
little flour ; imd being made into small balls, are spread wifli 
the remaining yolk of e^^ powdered usually with sugar, and 
fried in hot lard ; and, when ready to be served, put them fiir 
a moment on a hair sieve, to drain off the fiit. 

If made solely with paste, without mince of any kind, Uiey 
should have another e^^ and the batter be more continually 
beaten, so as to render the beignets light ; then, when prepared 
for dressing, take a spoonful of the batter formed into a ball, 
and drop it into the boiling lard. A large dishful will be fried 
in 6 or 7 minutes.

PASTE — MEAT PIES — FISH Pl£& 



VARIOUS SORTS OF PASTE. 

5d5. — ts making paste for pies great Care should be taken 
that the flour be well dried ; for the finer kinds of paste it ought 
also to be sifted. The very best salt butter is perhaps the best 
material for making p&ste. Some persons employ lard, or 
equal parts of lard and butter ; and Clarified dripping is an 
excellent substitute. 

An adept in pastry never leaves any part of it adhering to 
the board or dish used in making. The best thing to make it 
upon is a slab of marble or slate ; which substances cause less 
waste, being cold and smooth. The coolest part of the house, 
and of the day, should be chosen for the process ; the hands 
should be previously washed in very hot water, and the less 
they touch the paste the better and lighter it will prove ; nor 
should it be rolled much. 

In whatever way paste be made, wetting it much will render 
it tough. 

Salt butter of the best quality makes a fine flaky crust ; for 
sweet things, wash it. In making pie-crust lard is, however, 
better than butter ; and in making the pcute it is sometimes 
mixed with the flour in a dry state. 

Heating the oven properly is a very essential point in baking 
the various sorts of paste to be here enumerated. 

Raised pies must be put into a quick oven, or the crust will 
&U. The cook should accurately know the proper heat for 
each article, as opening the door to observe their progress lets 
in the air, and often spoils them. They require from ^ to a 
full hour more than when baked in a dish. 



410 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Cmf.XHL 

CRUST FOR RAISED PIES, 

536. — Boil water with a little fine lard, and an eqid 
quantity of fresh dripping, or of butter, but not much of cstko. 
Mliile hot, mix this with as much flour as you will want, nak- 
ing the paste as stiff as you can to be smooth, which yoa vil 
make it by good kneading and beating it with the voQhi^ 
pin. When quite smooth, put a lump into a doth, or under a 
pan, to soak till nearly cold. 

In raising paste it should be brought to a firm ocnsistaiee^ 
and of sufficient thickness to hold the meat together ; it dioiild 
therefore not be too rich, and it is easier to be worked if 
moderately warm than cold. The proper way to raise tke 
crust is by placing the left hand on the Imnp of paste, and 
with the right keep working it up the back of the hand, till 
all be of the proper shape and thickness. When worked into 
the desired form the meat is then put into the pie, and, when 
quite full, the lid is put on and fixed to the waQ or side ; fiie 
top being ornamented with some device, also made of parte. 
Before putting it in the oven glaze it all over with white of egg. 

Those who have not a good hand at raisin^r crust may 
roll the paste of a proper thickness, and cut out the top and 
bottom of the pie, then a long piece for the sides then 
cement the bottom to the sides with ei^, bringing the foroMr 
rather farther out, and pinching both together : put egg betwe^ 
the edges of the paste to make it adhere at the sides. Fill 
the pie, put on the cover, and pinch it and the side crust 
together. The same mode of uniting the paste is to be ob- 
served if the sides are pressed into a tin form, in which the 
paste must be baked, after it shall be filled and covered :■ the 
tin should be buttered, and carefully taken off when done 
enough ; and as the form usually makes the sides of a lighter 
colour than is proper, the pie should be put into the oven 
again for i of an hour. 

For Venison Pasty w Perigord Pie. — To i peck of 
fine flour use 2J lbs. of butter and 4 eggs : mix into paste 
with warm water, and work it smooth and to a good consist- 
ence. Put a paste round the inside, but not to the bottom of 

• In lining a tin form, put in the sides first, having cut the paste rather 
deeper than the tin, so as to allow for its lying a little on the bottom, and 
th^yi^oint may appear ; then cut a piece suMciently large to cover the 




Chap. XXH.] PASTE. 411 

the dkh ; and let the cover be pretty thicky to bear the long 
continuance in the oven* 

For rich Pie-crusL — ^Weigh an equal quantity of butter 
i^ith as much fine flour as you judge necessary : mix, with a 
silver spoon, a little of the former with the latter, and wet it 
with as little water as will make it into a stiff paste. Roll it 
out, and put all the butter over it in slices, turn in the ends, 
and roll it thin ; do this twice, and handle it as little as pos- 
sible. The butter may be added at twice ; and for those who 
are not accustomed to make paste it may be better to do so. 

It requires a quicker oven than for short crust. Lay a paper 
over to keep it from scorching. 

A less rich Paste,- — ^Weigh 1 lb. of flour and i lb. of 
butter, rub them together, and mix into a paste with a little 
water and an e^ well-beaten. Roll and fold it 3 or 4 times ; 
or, omit the e^, and put 6 oz. of butter and a spoonful of 
white sugar ; work up the whole into a stiff paste with as little 
Kot water as possible. 

PUFF PASTE, 

537. — ^To obtain this in perfection much will depend on the 
quality of the butter used, and on its being rolled out or turned 
a sufficient number of times, so that the butter may be mixed 
with the paste in minute layers. Salt butter will make as 
good, if not better paste than fresh. When salt butter is used, 
it should be broken into small pieces, and put into a pan or 
pail of clean cold water ; well work or squeeze it between the 
hands in the water, which will deprive it of the greatest portion 
of the salt it contains ; take it from the water and put it on a 
doth, and mould or work it well, in the same manner as you 
would a piece of paste ; when the water is all worked out, and 
the butter appears dry and firm, make it in a roll and put it 
in a cold place for use. Fresh butter should be moulded in 
the same manner as directed for salt, but it does not require 
being first put into water. In summer a few pieces of ice may 
be put into the water with the butter, in order to harden it. 
But in winter or severe frosty weather the butter should be 
well moulded, in order to make it mellow. 

Weigh 1 lb. of butter and 1 lb. of sifted flour. Take 2 oz. 
of the butter and rub in with the flour ; make a hole in the 
middle, in which put a teaspoonful of salt, and pour in, 
cient cold water to make it into a paste of nearly 1 




412 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Ghap.XXE 

consistence as the butter. This should be more particiilafij 
observed in summer, as the heat then causes the batter to 
become very soft during the rolling of the paste, and to break 
through the surface, unless the dou^ is made of oonsideraUj 
less consistence in the first place, in order to allow fi>r ttk 
To each pound allow 2 ^gs, well-beaten and mixed with tiie 
water. 

Mix the dough into a clear, smooth paste, without toug^ 
ness, by rubbing it well with the heel of the rigbt hand OQ 
the board until it has acquired a dear, smooth, whining ap- 
pearance ; mould it into a round lump, then press afi the 
moisture from the remainder of the butter, and form it into a 
ball, taking care not to soften it : put this upon the paste and 
press it down, then enclose it with the paste like an apple- 
dumpling ; flour the marble well and roll it out ; this is odled 
the ^^ first turn ;'* then fold it in three, and roll it out again, 
which will be a second turn ; now fold it again in the same 
manner, and put it in a cold place, if convenient on ice,* 
covered with a damp cloth, until it is required to be rolled out 
for use, when the number of turns required to be given to it 
more will depend on the thinness it has been rolled each time ; 
thus, if it is rolled out to the greatest extent it will reach, 4 
turns will be generally sufficient for it. If rolled out thicker 
than this, or about ^ inch or rather more in thickness, it 
will then require from 4^ to 6 turns, but not more than 6^ in 
any case. The half-turn is merely doubling the sheet or fold- 
ing it in two. Experience alone can determine when the paste 
has been sufficiently rolled. 

VERY LIGHT PASTE. 

538. — Mix the flour and water together, roll the paste out, 
and lay bits of butter upon it. Then beat up the white of an 
e^^, and brush it all over the paste before it is folded ; repeat 
t£us when rolling out, and adding the butter each time till the 
whole of the white of e^ is used. It will make the paste very 
flaky. 

For Tarts and Cheesecakes, — ^Beat the white of an egg to 
a strong froth ; then mix it with as much water as will make 

* If ice is not to be had, and the butter is soft, pat it into a basin, and set 
the basin in a pan of water mixed with plenty of salt and saltpetre, and let 
it remain in a cool place for an hour before it is used. 



CHAP.XXn.] PASTE. 413 

i lb. of fine floor into a very stiff paste : roll it very thin, 
then lay the third part of i^ lb. of butter upon it in little bits ; 
dredge it with some flour left out at first, and roll it up tight. 
Roll it out again, and put the same proportion of butter ; and 
so proceed till all be worked up. 

JFbr Orange Cheesecakes or Sweetmeats, — Dry 1 lb. of the 
finest flour, mix with it 3 oz. of refined sugar ; then work 
i lb. of butter with your hand till it comes to a &oth ; put 
the fiour into it by degrees, and work into it, well beaten 
and strained, the yolks of 3 and whites of 2 eggs. If too 
soft put some flour and sugar, to make it fit to roll. Line 
your pattypans, and fill. A little above 15 nunutes will bake 
them. Against they come out, have ready some refined sugar 
beaten up with the white of an egg as thick as you can ; ice 
them all over, set them in the oven to harden, and serve cold* 
Use fresh butter. 

TRANSPARENT CRUST FOR TARTS. 

639. — ^Beat an egg till it be quite thin ; have ready 12 oz, 
of the purest well-washed butter, without salt, melted without 
being oiled ; and when cool mix the e^ with it, and stir it 
into 1 lb. of fine flour well dried. Make the paste very thin ; 
line the pattypans as quickly as you can, and, when putting 
the tarts into the oven, brush them over with water, and sift 
sugar on them. If they are baked in a lightly heated oven, 
they will look beautiful. 

SHORT CRUST. 

640. — Mix 2 oz. of white powdered sugar with 1 lb. of flour, 
and rub into it 3 oz. of butter so completely as not to allow 
any separate bits to be seen ; beat the yolks of 2 eggs into 
some cream, and make the whole into a smooth paste ; roll 
it thin. 

Or: — Mix 2 oz, of powdered sugar with 1 lb. of flour; add 
i lb. of butter rubbed into it very fine ; make it into a paste 
with cold water ; roll it out and use it. 

Or : — Mix with 1 lb. of fine flour dried, 1 oz. of sugar 
pounded and sifted ; then rub 3 oz. of butter in it, till it 
looks all like flour, and, with a gill of boiling cream, work it 
up to a fine paste. 

Anotliery not sweet but rich. — Rub 6 oz. of butter in 8 o:^ 




414 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIL 

of fine flour ; mix it into a stiffish paste, with as little water as 
possible ; beat it well and roll it thin. Bake them ^ in a 
moderate oven. 

CROQUANT PASTE FOR COVERING PRESERVES. 

541. — Dissolve a drachm of sugar in as much cold w^ter as 
will make 4 oz. of flour into a paste : knead and beat it as 
smooth as possible. Roll it to the size of the croquant form, 
and about i inch thick. Rub the form with beef-suet, and 
lay it on the paste, and press it so closely as to cut the 
pattern completely through. Then lay it on a tin to bake. 
With a bunch of white feathers do over the paste with the 
white of an e^^ beaten, and sift fine sugar on it. Bake it in a 
slow oven, and gently remove the paste from the tin while yet 
warm, and lay it over the fruit it is to cover. The same oovef 
will serve many times if kept in a dry place. 

BRIOCHE PASTE.— E. R. 

542. — This paste is essential in many of the finer kinds ci 
cookery, and, though rather troublesome to make, will repay 
the pains bestowed, since, with a small addition of sauce, it 
will afford an excellent side-dish in itself, and it will enter into 
the composition of, and improve, all the more elaborate entnfes. 
Take 7 fresh eggs, 2 lbs. of flour dried and warmed at the 
fire, and 1 lb. of fresh butter. Take -J- lb. of this flour, and 
pour into the middle of it a dessertspoonful of yeast, which 
has been prepared by pouring water over it, stirring it, and 
allowing it to stand to settle, and then draining the water off. 
It is the sediment which must be employed. Pour a little 
warm water over the yeast, and mix the paste up with it, which 
forms the leaven ; flour the pan, lay the leaven in it before 
the fire to rise, and slit it on the top. As soon as the paste 
has risen proceed thus : — Make a hole in the middle of the 
remaining flour, put into it a little salt, about a saltspoonful, 
the same quantity of powdered sugar to take off any bitter 
taste in the yeast, and a little water to melt it ; the butter 
broken into small pieces, and the eggs: work it all well 
together, and knead it thoroughly, spreading it out and work- 
ing it well : then spread it out entirely, and lay the yeast or 
leavened paste all over it, taking the greatest care in kneading 
and shifting the paste about to mix both well together. It 
will take some time, and must be thoroughly accomplished. 



Chap. XXHJ MEAT PIES. 415 

I III I . ■ « 

When completed, €our a towel, wrap the paste up m it, and 
put it into a pan ; if in cold weather in a warm situation, and 
if in hot weather in a cold one. It is best made a day before 
it is wanted. Very minute pieces, shaped in any way, add 
greatly to the excellence of soup, to be boiled with it, or stewed 
in the gravy of a vol^au'venty and strewed over the top* It 
is cut into shapes also, and fried as the accompaniment of 
braised dishes of every kind. It is an exquisite case for lobster 
and other patties, or, brushed over with egg, may be firied in 
shapes for a side-dish : or it may be boiled in cups, 6 in a dish, 
and served up with asparagus cut small and heaped upon the 
top, and a white sauce round. In fact, a clever cook, by em- 
ploying different flavouring ingredients, either sweet or savoury, 
may make endless dishes of brioche. It should not, however, 
praiominate ; and, therefore, it is best to make only a small 
quantity at a time, where the consumption of the family is 
not great. It will not keep long. The proper length of time 
for baking can only be learned by practice and attention on the 
part of the cook ; much depending on the state of the oven, 
as well as the size of the article to be cooked : its appearance 
will, however, be generally found a pretty safe guide. 



MEAT PIES, PATTIES, &c. 

643. — There are few articles of cookery more generally liked 
than relishing pies, if properly made ; and they may be formed 
of a great variety of things. 

Raised Pies may be made of any kind of flesh, fish, jGruit, or 
poultry, if baked in a wall of paste instead of a baking-dish ; 
but they are generally eaten cold, and made so large and 
savoury as to remain a long time before being consumed, for 
which reason they also bear the name of " standing pies." In 
making them the cook should always take care to have a good 
stock that will jelly, made from the bones and trimmings, to 
fill up the pie when it comes from the oven, and also that when 
cold there may be enough jelly. For want of this precaution 
pies become dry before they can be eaten. The materials are 
of course frequently varied, but the mode of preparation is so 
nearly the same as not to require the recital of more than a 
few prominent receipts.

SEASONING FOR RAISED PIES. 

544. — 3 lbs. of salt dried and pounded, 3 oz. of whife pepper, 
i oz. of cayenne pepper, 2 oz. of cloves, 2 oz. of auspice, 1 ol 
of basil, 1 oz. of marjoram, 1 oz. of thyme, 1 oz. of bay-lei^ 
1 oz. of nutmeg, H oz. of mace. 

Pound the spices and herbs by themselves, and sift thjoogli 
a fine sieve ; then mix with the salt, and put away in a stop- 
pered bottle : } oz. is sufRcient for 1 lb. of &rce, and ^ oz. ftr 
1 lb. of boned game. 

JELLY FOR MEAT OR RAISED PIES. 

545. — Take a quart of veal gra>y, dissolve 2 oz. of iaSngliiigi 
in a little of it ; add the remainder with i pint of tamgon 
vinegar ; boil all together for i of an hour. Clarify it with 
the whites of 6 eggs, then pass it through a bag. 

PATE DE GIBIER AUX TRUFFES. 

546. — Make a &rce of 2 lbs. of lean meat, either rabtnt, 
veal, or pork ; 1 lb. of liver, either calf's or game ; i lb. of 
lean ham ; 3 lbs. of bacon fat; 4 oz. of seasoning spice. 

Cut up the above ingredients ; put them in a stewpan with 
a shalot and a tablespoonful of chopped parsley ; let it heat 
gently on the fire, stirring occasionally ; when the meat is 
tolerably done, turn the whole into a mortar, and pound it 
thoroughly ; take it out, and mix with it li lb. of truffles 
chopped. 

Bone a hare and 4 partridges ; season them in the propor- 
tion of i oz. of seasoning spice to each pound of meat ; put a 
little of the farce in the partridges, together with a large 
French truffle (French are preferred to tlie English on account 
of their colour and flavour — the English answer the purpose, 
and are not more than ^th the expense). 

Line a French pie-mould, as directed at " Pastry," being 
careful to make the join in the paste perfect ; put a layer of 
thin bacon fat at the bottom, then a layer of the farce, and on 
that one of the hare ; then the partridges, two breast upwards 
and the other two reversed ; fill up the pie with the remainder 
of the farce and hare ; shape the top nicely, put a slice of bacon 
fat over and two bay-leaves ; cover with paste, and bake for 4 
hours ; when nearly cold, fill in with the gravy drawn from 
the bones, and set with a little isinglass. 



Chap. XXH.] MEAT PIES. 417 

PARTRIDGE PIE 2 LA FRANC AISE, 

547. — ^^ Take 6 partridges, trussed as for boiled chickens, 
and season them well witii the above seasoning. Take also 
2 lbs, of veal and 1 lb. of fat bacon ; out these into small bits, 
and put them into a stewpan with i lb. of butter, together 
with some shalots, parsley, and thyme, stewing them until 
quite tender. Strain and pound the meat in a mortar till 
made perfectly smooth. 

^^ Tlie pie-crust being raised, put in the partridges with the 
above-mentioned forcemeat over them, and over that lay bome 
thin slices of bacon. Cover the pie with a thick lid, and be 
sure to close it well, to prevent any portion of the gravy from 
oozing out. 

" This sized pie will require 3 hours' baking, but care must 
be taken not to put it into the oven till the fierce heat be 
gone oflr."* 

For Partridge-pie in the ordinary way lay a veal outlet in 
the bottom of the dish ; line the inside of the birds with feA 
bacon, season them well and place ihem with the breast down- 
wards ; fill the dish with good gravy, and add forcemeat-balls, 
with a few button mushrooms freshly gathered. 

Pies of this sort may be made nearly in the same manner of 
every species of game ; but the mixture of the brown and 
white meats is not desirable, as the former have a peculiar 
flavour which ought to be maintained, and is weakened by the 
admixture of the latter : also hare and venison, though each 
forming admirable pasties separately, yet spoil each other when 
put together. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

648. — Cut up 2 young fowls, season with white pepper, salt, 
a little mace, and nutmeg, all in the finest powder. Put the 
chicken, thin slices of ham or fresh ganunon of bacon, force- 
meat, and hard eggs, by turns in layers. By the time it 
returns from the oven, have ready a gravy of knuckle of veal, 
or a bit of the scrag, with some shank-bones of mutton, or a 
calfs-foot, seasoned with herbs, onion, mace, and white pep- 
per ; and if it be made in a dish, put as much gravy as wUl 
fill it, but in a raised crust the gravy must be nicely strained, 
and then put in cold as jelly. To make the jelly dear, take 

* Dr. Hunter's ' Medical Commentary on Modem Cookery,' p. 160.

418 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [CaiF.XXn. 

off the fat, whip up 2 whites of eggs, give it a boil, and then 
run it through a fine lawn sieve. 

Or : — Lay a fowl, or a few bones of the scrag of ▼«■!, 
seasoned, into a dish ; scald a large handful of picked pardejf 
in milk, season it, and add it to die fowl or meat, wi^ a tear 
cupful of any sort of good broth or weak gravy. When it is 
baked, raise the crust and pour into the di^ i pint of cream 
scalded, with a piece of butter the size of a walnut, and a Ut 
of flour ; stirring it round to mix with the gravy already in. 
It is very excellent when made with alternate layers of salt 
pork, or slices of pig's-cheek. 

RABBIT PIE, 

549. — Rabbits, if young and in flesh, are quite as deli- 
cate as chickens: their legs should be cut short, and the 
ribs must not be put in, but will help to make the gravy. 

Cut 2 rabbits and 1 lb. of pickled pork into small bits ; lay 
them, when seasoned with pepper and salt, into a dish. Far- 
boil the livers, and beat them in a mortar, with their wei^t 
of &t bacon, some pepper, salt, mace, and sweet herbs, chopped 
fine. Make this into small balls, and distribute in the d^i. 
Grate i a small nutmeg over, and add a pint of grsLvj, Cover 
with a tolerably thick crust, and bake it an hour in a quick 
but not violently heated oven. 

All pies made of white meats or fowls are improved by a 
layer of fine sausage-meat, made of pork, flavoured according 
to taste and the savouriness of the pie. 

HARE PIE. 

550. — Season the hare after it is cut up, in the same manner 
as if to be jugged ; and bake it, with eggs, and forcemeat partly 
made of the liver, in a raised crust or dish. When it is to be 
served, raise the lid, and, if in a crust, cover it with jelly, but, 
if made in a dish, with warm gravy, mixed with a large glass- 
ful of port wine. 

TIPPERAR Y CURR Y (an excellent Picnic Dish), 

661. — ^Boil 4 chickens, and stuff 2 of them when cold with 
a forcemeat made of crumbs of bread, a few slices of ham or 
tongue, sweet herbs, and a shalot well pounded and mixed 
wi£ the yolk of an egg. Stuff the other 2 with boiled rice, 



Chap. XXH.] MEAT PIES. 419 

lay them in a mould or dish, with 8 hard-boiled ^gs cut in 
half, a few mushrooms, a little pickled lemon cut in thin rings. 
Pour over the chickens a gravy made as follows : — Fry an 
onion in a little butter, add a tablespoonfid of curry-powder, 
1 of vinegar, 1 of mushroom-ketchup, a little salt, and a little 
more than a pint of good veal br(^ ; if the broth does not 
jelly, isinglass must be put into it to inake it do so. When 
cold turn it out on a dish. It is a great im]m>vement to bone 
the chickens, the bones helping to make the gravy. 

FRENCH PIE.-'E. R. 

552. — ^Make a raised crust upon a buttered tin, and brush 
it with yolk of e^ ; cover the bottom with forcemeat, then 
fill up Uie pie witii sweetbread cut into small pieces, oysters, 
hard eggs, limbs of chicken, turkey, or rabbit, boned ; arti- 
choke-bottoms in small pieces, asparagus-tops, forcemeat-balli, 
and mushrooms, taking care to lay them regularly, and to 
season the whole lighuy and evenly : bake it in a moderate 
oven. When it is done pour in some strong gravy and cream 
thickened with flour and butter. 

Sausage-meat may be mixed with the forcemeat, and in 
winter truffles substituted for the vegetables; the seasoning 
should be of mace, cloves, and cayenne pepper. 

VEGETABLE PIE. 

653. — Scald and blanch some broad beans ; cut young car- 
rots, turnips, artichoke-bottoms, mushrooms, onions, lettuces, 
parsley, celery, and add peas ; or use any of them you may 
have. Make them into a nice stew, with a little good veal 
gravy ; season with pepper and salt ; bake a crust over a dish, 
vnth a little lining round the edge. When baked, pour the 
stew into the dish, and lay the crust over it. Winter v^e- 
tables may be used in the same way, and a cup of cream is a 
great improvement. 

COLD PIES. 

546. — ^When mecU pies are prepared to be eaten coldj suet 
should not be put into the forcemeat that is used with them. 
If the pie is made of meat that will take more dressing, to 
make it extremely tender, than the baking of the crust will 
allow, prepare it in the following way : — ^Take 3 lbs. of the 
veiny piece of beef that has fat and lean ; wajh it, and seoaon 

2 E 2 



420 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIL 

it with salt, pepper, mace, and allspice, in fine powder, rubbing 
them well in. Set it by the side of a slow fire, in a stewpot 
that will just hold it ; put to it a piece of batter of about the 
weight of 2 oz., and cover it quite close ; let it just simmer in 
its own steam till it begins to shrink. When it is cold, add 
more seasoning, forcemeat, and eggs : if it is made in a disii, 
put some g^vy to it before baking ; but if it is only in crust, 
do not put the gravy till after it is cold and in jelly. Foroe^ 
meat may be put both under and over the meat, if preferred 
to balls. 

VEAL PIES.—E. R. 

555. — The best part of veal for this purpose is the breast ; 
cut it into pieces and put it into a stewpan, with an onion, a 
head of celery, a bundle of sweet herbs, and a small quantity 
of water ; when warmed through add more water, and stew tt 
gently until it is done. By this means 2 lbs. of veal will 
yield a quart of fine white stock, which will jelly : let it 
remain until cold, and then take off all the fat ; take out the 
long bones, and all the skin, season it well, and pile it li^tiy 
in tiie piendish, having lined the sides with paste. Boil 4 or 
6 eggs hard, and put them in : pound some ham or ganunon 
of bacon in a mortar — bacon or ham in slices always being 
hard — make them up into small balls with a little butter, and 
add them ; add also some forcemeat balls ; fill up the pie 
with the stock, which should be flavoured with a small quantity 
of ketchup, Chetney, or other sauce. 

Reserve a portion of the stock thus prepared, and pour it 
hot into the pie, when it comes from the oven, to supply the 
waste. This will be most excellent cold, as it will be per- 
fectly free from all greasy particles, and the meat tender, 
which will not be the case unless previously stewed. 

For Cold Veal Pie, — Take some of the fleshy part of a 
knuckle of veal, with an equal quantity of minced ham ; , 
season it with salt, pepper, spices, and aromatic herbs chopped, 
and a small clove of garlic or shalot ; pound them in a mortar, 
adding eggs and an equal quantity of gravy. Cover the 
bottom of a pan with thin slices of bacon ; lay a little of this 
forcemeat upon it ; lay some cutlets of veal over the force- 
meat, seasoning them with pepper and minced mushrooms : in 
this manner fill to the top, covering the whole with forcemeat 

After baking for an hour, let it cool. Have paste prepared 



Chap. XXH.] MEAT PIES. 421 

about an inch in thickness; make it round upon buttered 
paper, sprinkling a little flour on the paste ; then take the 
meat from the pan, which should be plunged in hot water to 
detach it easily ; place it in the paste, covering it at the top 
with a crust i inch thick, and leaving a. hole in the middle. 
Glaze, and put it into a very hot oven ; let it bake 3 or 4 
hours ; when sufficiently done, a wooden skewer will enter 
easily. Put in some clear gravy ; hstem the hole at the topi 
and turn it upside down. 

This pie may be made of fowl^ rabbity or game, boned or 
put in whole, the birds being filled with forcemeat, mushrooms^ 
either j&esh or buttons pickled, or black truffles. 

VecU and Sweetbread Pie, — Cut the veal from the chump 
end of the loin ; season it well ; clean and blanch a sweet* 
bread, cut it into pieces^ and season it ; lay both in the dish 
with the yolks of 6 hard-boiled eg^ and a pint of oysters. 
Strain the oyster liquor, add to it a pint of good gravy ; line 
the sides of the dish with a puff paste i inch thick, and 
cover it with a lid of the same. Bake it in a quick oven for 
li hour ; and when it is sent to table cut the lid into 8 or 10 
pieces, and stick them round the sides, covering the meat with 
slices of lemon. 

Veal and Sausage Pie, — Cover a shallow dish with paste^ 
lay a well-beaten veal-cutlet at the bottom, slightly seasoned ; 
cover it with a Bologna sausage freed from the skin and cut 
into slices ; then add another cutlet and a layer of the Bo- 
logna sausage ; cover the whole with paste, and put no water to 
it : the veal will give out sufficient gravy, while it will be ren- 
dered very savoury by the sausage. It is excellent eaten cold. 

Veal and Oyster Pie, — Make a seasoning of pepper, salt, 
and a small quantity of grated lemon-peel. Cut some veal- 
cutlets, and beat them until they are tender: spread over 
them a layer of pounded ham, and roll them round ; then 
cover them with oysters, and put another layer of the veal 
fillets, and oysters on the top. Make a gravy of the bones 
and trimmings, or with a lump of butter, onion, a little flour 
and water ; stew the oyster liquor, and put to it, and fill up 
the dish, reserving a portion to put into the pie when it comes 
firom the oven. 

Veal and Pork Pie, — Take equal quantities of veal and 
pork, boil 1 or 2 onions, and scald some leaves of sage ; beat 






422 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XHL 

the meat well, and cover it with the sage and onions chopped 
tog^ether, with pepper and salt ; fill up the pie with a lUtle 
gravy, and bake it 

EXCELLENT PORK PIES TO EAT COLD. 

556. — Raise the crust according to the directions alretdy 
given, into either a round or oval form, as you choose ; have 
ready the trinunings and small bits of poriL cut off when a hog 
is killed ; and if these are not enough, take the meat off a 
blade-bone. Beat it well with a rolling-pin, cut it into diee, 
season with pepper and salt, and keep the fat and lean separate. 
Put it in layers, quite dose up to the top ; lay on the lid^ 
cut the edge smooth round, and pinch it; bake in a slow 
soaking oven, as the meat is very solid. The pork mny be put 
into a conmion dish, with a very plain crust, and be quite as 
good. Observe to put no bone or water into pork pie : ih» 
outside of the pieces will be hard, unless they are cut small 
and pressed close. 

Both these and veal and chicken pies are generally eaten 
cold, and, as they are always seasoned highly, will keep good 
for several days in the hottest weather. In the west of 
England it is not uncommon to take off the cover and fill the 
pie up, when cold, with clouted cream, which is a very deli* 
dous addition. 

CALrS'HEAD OR CALF* S-FOOT PIE,— E. R. 

567. — Either must be well stewed before being put into 
the pie. They must be cut into nice pieces, free from bone, 
and well seasoned, or otherwise they will be tasteless. If to 
be eaten hot, sausage-meat or fresh mushrooms or oysters will 
be an improvement, in addition to the ham, ^gs, and force- 
meat balls ; and if cold, the small pickled mushrooms should 
be added, or a little mushroom-powder in the gravy. The 
excellence of the pie will chiefly depend upon the seasoning 
and flavour, and the quantity of fine savoury jelly which it 
will contain ; and therefore the meat should not be closely 
packed, in order to leave room for the jelly. 

Calfs'fooi and Kidney Pie. — Take from a cold roasted 
loin of veal slices of the kidney fat, cover them with pounded 
ham, and put them into a dish with the kidney cut into pieces, 
and the meat from a calf's foot ; put in a few hard-boiled eggs 



Chap. XXU.] MEAT PIES. 423 

and foatoemeat balls, made very savoury with oysters, an 
anchovy, and the &t of bacon, as this pie should be eaten 
cold. Put the juice of i^ a lemon, or a spoonful of Harv^ 
sauce, into the gravy. Sweetbread may be employed instead 
of kidney. 

BEEF-8TEAK PIE, 

558. — ^Take rump-steaks that have been well hung: beat 
them gently with a rolling-pin : season with pepper, salt, and 
a little shalot minced very fine ; put the slices in layers with 
a good piece of fiit and a sliced mutton kidney ; fill the dish ; 
put some crust on the edge, and about an inch below it, and a 
cup of water or broth in the dish. Cover with rather a thick 
crurt, and set in a moderate oven. 

Beefsteak and Oyster Pie. — ^Prepare the steaks as above, 
and put layers of them and of oysters. Stew the liquor and 
beards of the latter with a bit of lemon-peel, mace, and a 
tablespoonfid of walnut ketchup. When the pie is baked, 
boil with the above 3 spoonfuls of cream and 1 oz. of butter 
rubbed in flour ; to which, however, many people object as 
injuring the savouriness of the pie ; in whidi case, should any 
addition be required, a few spoonAils of beef gravy and port 
wine will answer the purpose. Strain it, and pour it into the 
dish : for a small pie a dozen of Milton oysters will be suffi- 
cient, and the pie may be baked in a couple of hours. 

MUTTON PIE.—E, R. 

559. — Cut the mutton into small slices, without bone; 
season it very well, and stew it with the hi also cut in pieces, 
putting in no water. When tender allow it to remain until 
cold ; remove all the grease and fat very carefully ; have 
some g^vy made from the bones, add to it the strained gravy 
from the mutton, and a glass of port wine, but the wine may 
be omitted if the gravy be strong and highly seasoned. A 
minced shalot and button onions are good additions, and if 
the latter be pickled their acidity will be an improvement. 
Put it into a dish or into small pattypans, and bake it ; if in 
pattypans use puff paste. Mutton pies are better hot than cold. 

The underdone part of a leg of mutton may be thus dressed ; 
but the loin and kidneys are better suited for the purpose. 

Lamb Pie. — ^Make it of the loin, neck, or breast; the 



424 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Cbap. XXH. 

breast of house-lamh is one of the most delicate things tint 
can be eaten. It should be very lightly seasoned with pqiper 
and salty the bone taken out, but not the gpristles ; oover it 
with puff paste, and put in a small quantity of jelly gravy hot 

SQUAB PIE 

560. — Is a fiivourite dish throughout Devonshire and Com- 
wal), and is there generally made of mutton. It is made tfa»: 
Cut apples as for other pies, and lay them in rows with muttion 
chops and shred onion ; sprinkle with pepper and salt, and abo 
some sugar. Bake the pie in a deep dish, oover it with a thick 
crust, and eat it hot ; it must be well done, and will take 2 to 
3 hours baking. In the midland counties it is usually made 
of beef cut into dice, with some lean bacon seasoned and mixed 
with the apples. 

POTATO PIE. 

561. — Have a tin dish (as in the cut), take out the plate, 

lay pieces of meat at the bottom 
of the dish, seasoned with pqipcr 
and salt, and a little water. Be- 
place the plate, which is perfo- 
rated with holes, fill up the dish 
to the handles of the centre pillar 
with mashed potatoes; bake it; 
when put on table, lift up the 
plate of potatoes, which will have 
received all the flavour of the 
Potato-pie Dish. baked meat. 

VENISON PASTY, 

562. — The neck, breast, and shoulder are the only parts of 
the deer used in this coimtry for a pasty ; and even the neck 
is more generally roasted. 

A shoulder and breast, boned, make a good pasty ; but, the 
shoulder being sinewy, it will be of advantage to rub it well 
with sugar for 2 or 3 days; and when used wipe it per- 
fectly clean. A mistake used to prevail that venison could 
not be baked too much ; but 3 or 4 hours in a slow oven will be 
sufficient to make it tender, and the flavour will be preserved. 

Cut the venison in pieces; put it into a stewpan with a 
little port wine, 2 shalots, an onion, bay-leaf, £iggot of parsley 




Chap. XXH.] MEAT PIES. 425 

and thyme, pepper, salt, and a little gravy. Cover it dose 
and let it stew gently until tender ; take out the meat, an 
puU out the bones ; reduce the gravy, and when thoroughl 
cold remove the fat ; then proceed to make ihepcuty. 

Line the sides of the dish with crust, but not the bottom ; 
lay in the meat with &t between each piece, season with 
pepper and salt, put to it a pint of the gravy and a few bits of 
butter, cover with a good crust, and bake it thoroughly. 

Keep the remainder of the gravy till the pasty comes from 
the oven, put it by means of a funnel into the middle quite 
hot, and shake the dish to mix it well. The pasty must be 
well done, requiring generally 2 hours' baking. 

A want of faX may be supplied by the mt of a loin of 
mutton steeped for 24 hours in port wine and garlic vinegar. 

To make a Pasty of Beef or Mutton to eat like Venison, — 
Bone a small rump or piece of sirloin of beef, or a &t loin of 
mutton, after hanging several days. Beat it very well with 
a rolling-pin ; then rub 10 lbs. of meat with 4 oz. of sugar^ 
and pour over it a glass of port, and the same of vinegar. 
Let it lie 5 days and nights ; wash and wipe the meat very 
dry, and season it very high with pepper, Jamaica pepper, 
nutmeg, and salt. Lay it in the dish, and to 10 lbs. put 
f lb. of butter ; spread it over the meat. Put a crust round 
the edges and cover with a thick one, or it will be overdone 
before the meat be soaked : it must be done in a slow oven. 

Set the bones in a pan in the oven, with no more water 
than will cover them, and 1 glass of port, a little pepper and 
salt, that you may have a little rich gravy to add to the 

pasty when drawn.

YORKSHIRE GOOSE PIE.—E. R, 

563. — ^Bone a goose, a fowl, and a pigeon; season them 
well with pepper, taking care to cover the whole of the inte- 
rior, or otherwise it will turn sour before it can be eaten ; put 
the pigeon into the fowl, and the fowl inside the goose, filling 
the interstices with various kinds of force and sausage meat 
and hard-boiled eggs. The liver and gizzard of the fowl and 
pigeon will assist in the forcemeat, which must be very well 
compounded ; sew up the goose, and put it into a thick crust. 
It will take several hours to bake. Make savoury jelly, which 
must also be well seasoned, pour it into the pie when it comes 



426 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXH 

from the oven ; ornament the top, and let it be moveable, so 
that the pie may have a good appearance to the last, as tiie 
crust is not to be eaten. A calf' s-foot, boned and cut small, 
may be added, especially if used for the jelly. 

Green Goose Pie. — Bone 2 young green geese, of a good 
size ; but first take away every plug, and singe them niciely. 
Wash them clean ; and season them high with salt, pe]^, 
mace, and allspice. Put one inside the other, and press them 
as close as you can, drawing the legs inwards. Put a good 
deal of butter over them, and bake them either with or wi^oot 
crust ; if the latter, a cover to the dish must fit close to keep 
in the steam. It will keep long. Gravy-jelly may be added 
when the pie is to be served. 

GIB LET PIE, 

564. — After very nicely cleaning goose or duck giblets, 
stew them with a small quantity of water or well-seasoned 
gravy, onion, black pepper, and a bunch of sweet herbs, till 
nearly done. Let them grow cold ; and if not enough to M 
the dish, lay a steak of beef or veal, or 2 or 3 mutton steaks, 
at the bottom ; it requires 2 sets of giblets to make a mod^ 
rate sized pie. Add the gravy. 

A CHRISTMAS PIE. 

565. — ^Bone a large goose and a fowl. Parboil a smoked 
tongue ; peel it and cut off the root. Mix together a pow- 
dered nutmeg, i oz. of powdered mace, a teaspoonful of 
pepper, the same quantity of salt, and season the fowl and goose. 

Roll out the paste near an inch thick, and divide it into 3 
pieces ; cut out 2 of then) in an oval form for the top and 
bottom ; and the other into a long straight piece for the sides 
or walls of the pie. Brush the paste all over with beatai 
white of e^^ and set on the bottom the piece that is to form 
the wall, pinching the edges together, and cementing them 
with white of e^. The bottom piece must be large enough 
to turn up a little round the lower edge of the wall piece, to 
which it must be firmly joined all round. When you have 
the crust properly fixed, so as to be baked standing alone 
without a dish, put in first the goose, then the fowl, tiben the 
tongue. Fill up what space is left with pieces of the flesh of 
pigeons, or of partridges, quails, or any game that is conve- 
nient. There must be no bones in the pie. You may add 



Chap. XXH.] PATTIES. 427 

also some bits of ham, or some forcemeat balls. Cover the 
ingredieats with i lb. of butter, and put on the top crust, 
which, of course, must be also of an oval form to corre6p<»id 
with the bottom. The lid must be placed not quite on the top 
edge of the wall, but H inch below it ; close it very well, and 
ornament the sides and top with festoons and leaves cut out of 
paste ; notch the edges handsomely, and put a paste flower in 
the centre; glaze the whole with beaten yolk of eggj and 
bind the pie all round with a double fold of white paper ; 
bake it 4 hours. 

If the weather is cold, and the pie kept carefully covered 
up from the air, it will be good for 2 or 3 weeks, the standing 
crust assisting to preserve it. 

PIGEON PIE, 

566. — Have a nice rump-steak, cut it in thin slices, cover 
the bottom of the dish with it, then put a little seasonings 
paisley, and shalot over it ; boil 2 ^gs hard, chop the livers 
flne together with a little shalot and parsley ; add a few bread- 
crumbs, pepper, salt, and a small lump of butter ; woi^ all up 
together, and fill the pigeons with it ; put in the pigeons, then 
a Uttle more seasoning, fill up the dish with steak, seasoning 
it as before ; put in some water or gravy, cover with puff- 
paste, cut some leaves and lay over, e^ it, and bake it. 

PA TTIES, 

567. — ^Roll out puff paste i inch thick, and, with a 2-inch 
round cutter, cut as many pieces as are required for the dish. 
Take an inch cutter, dip it in hot water, and press it in the 
middle of the paste about half through. Brush the pieces 
over with yolk of ei^, bake in a quick oven, take out the 
piece marked with the inch cutter, remove the soft parts from 
the inside, fill them with a mince of any kind, dish them on a 
napkin, garnish with fried parsley. To make the tops, roll 
out the trimmings thin, cut some pieces with the inch cutter, 
eQg them over, and bake them. 

Of Beef, — Shred underdone dressed beef with a little fat, 
season with pepper, salt, and a little shalot or onion. Add 
gravy, i a glass of Madeira, and a few bread-crumbs. When 
hot, fill the patty-cases. 

Of Veal, — ^Mince some veal that is not quite done, put to it 
a little parsley, lemon-peel, nutmeg, and salt \ & lilU<^ ^ss^^ssk

and gravy just to moisten the meat ; if you have any ham, it 
will be an improvement. Do not warm it till the patties are 
baked. 

Of Turkey. — Mince some of the white part ; and with grated 
lemon, nutmeg, salt, a very little white pepper, cream, and a 
very little bit of butter warmed, fill the patties. 

A good Mince for Patties, — 2 oz. of ham, 4 of chickioi or 
veal, 1 e^^ boiled hard, 3 cloves, a blade of mace, pepper and 
salt, in fine powder. Just before you serve, warm the above 
with 4 spoonfuls of rich gravy, the same of cream, and 1 oz. 
of butter. Fill as usual. 

Of Oyster, — ^Take off the beards of the oysters, cut the 
other parts in small bits, put them in a small tosser with a 
grate of nutmeg, a little white pepper and salt, a morsel of 
lemon-peel cut very small, a little cream, and a small quantity 
of the oyster liquor. Simmer a few minutes before you fill. 

Or : — Beard and chop the oysters, boil a little cream, with 
an onion and a small quantity of mace ; chop fine the crust of 
a French roll, mix it with the oysters, add the cream ; 1^ it 
boil. Season with nutmeg, cayenne, and salt. 

Of Lobster. — Mince the fish in the same manner, mingling 
with it a little of the coral, and make with the same seasoning, 
a little cream, and the smallest bit of butter. 

Of Shrimps. — Pick a quart of shrimps ; if they are very 
salt, season them with only mace and a clove or two. Mince 
2 or 3 anchovies ; mix these with the spice, and then season 
the shrimps. Put a glass of sharp white wine. They do not 
take long baking. 

VOL- A U' VENT.—E, E. 

568. — Take puff paste, roll it about i inch thick, cut it round 
or oval according to the shape of the dish ; make the knife hot 
in water, so as not to drag the paste in cutting it ; mark the 
cover an inch from the edge, brush it over with yolk of egg ; 
bake it in a quick oven ; when done take off the top, clean (mt 
the soft paste, return it to the oven for a few minutes to dry ; 
dish it on a napkin. 

Care must be taken in taking out the soft part not to break 
the outside. 

It may be filled with ragoiit of sweetbread, fricassee of 
chicken, quenelles, lobster, or oysters, but is never made of a 
large size. 



Chap. XXH.] PISH PIES. 429 

Vol^aU'vent of Croquettes, — Make croquettes of the size of 
a pigeon's egg, of yesl and ham and of calves' brains, an 
equal quantity of each, fiy them of the palest gold colour, 
make a rich white-sauce, and put into it the very smallest 
mushrooms or minced truffles ; give it an acid flavour with 
lemon or lemon-pickle, and put it into the vol-au-vent when 
it is to be sent to table. 

Vol-<iU'Vent of Vecd. — Cut veal into thin pieces the size of 
half-a-crown, b^t them, and fey them a pale brown ; make 
some forcemeat and egg-balls, fry the former, put the whole 
into a rich brown gravy, fill the Vol-au-vent, and serve it up hot. 

Vol-<iU'vent of Pigeons and Sweetbreads. — Cut off the 
pinions, legs, and backs of 3 or 4 pigeons, and bone the breast, 
making it as large as possible : cut 3 or 4 pieces of blanched 
sweetbread the same size, put them together, securing them 
with tape, and put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter, 
the trimmings, an onion, a bunch of sweet herbs, a slice of 
fiit bacon, and a small teacupful of water. Let them stew till 
quite tender ; remove the tape, strain and thicken the gravyj 
and put them into the paste when it comes from the oven. 



FISH PIES. 

CODFISH PIE. 

569. — ^Take dressed codfish and cold oyster-sauce; put a 
little of the sauce at the bottom of a pie-dish, then a layer of 
flakes of codfish, with a little of the liver cut in small pieces, 
season with black pepper and salt, and a very little nutmeg ; 
repeat the layers until the dish is full, cover it with bread- 
crumbs and bits of fresh butter ; bake for \ of an hour, and 
let the top be quite brown. A couple of sounds well soaked, 
boiled tender, and cut in small pieces, are a great improvement. 

Or : — ^Take a piece of the middle of a small codfish, and 
salt it Well one night ; next day wash it, cut it in slices, season 
with pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg, mixed ; place it in 
a dish, and put some butter on it, with a little good broth of 
any kind. Cover it with a crust ; and when done, raise it, add 
a dozen of oysters, 1 pint of cream, a little flour and butter, a 
grate of lemon and nutmeg, and give it 1 boil. Bake it a fall 
hour. 



430 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEBY. [Ckaf. XXE 



AN INCOMPARABLE LINQ PIE, 

570. — Wash and soak the salt out of a piece of the tMn 
part ; boil it slowly ; remove the skin, and put layers of tbe 
fish and hard ^g sliced ; add chopped parsley, with 2 oc of 
butter in bits among it, till the dish is nearly fbU. Put in a 
seasoning made of a large teacupfU of g^vy, with pounded 
mace and white pepper. Lay over it a good puff-paste; 
and when that is sufficiently baked, put in a cup of liot 
cream. 

EEL PIE. 

571. — Cut the eels in lengths of 2 or 3 inches, after gH»«i*ng 
them ; season with pepper and salt, and place in the dish^wilb 
some bits of butter and a little water ; and cover it with paste. 
Middle-sized eels do best. They should be slightly seasoned, 
and the bottom of the pie-dish covered with a rump-steak, 
divided into small pieces, but not put in layers along with the 
fish, as many persons prefer eating the eels alone. The steak 
will produce abundance of gravy, to which only a little soy or 
ketchup should be added. 

A remarhahly fine Fish Pie, — Boil 2 lbs. of small eels ; 
having cut the fins quite close, pick the flesh ofi", and throw 
the bones into the liquor with a little mace, pepper, salt, and 
slice of onion ; boil till quite rich, and strain it. Make force- 
meat of the flesh, an anchovy, parsley, lemon-peel, salt, pepper, 
and crumbs, and 4 oz. of butter warmed, and lay it at the 
bottom of the dish. Take the flesh of soles, small cod, or 
dressed turbot, and lay them on the forcemeat, having rubbed 
it with salt and pepper ; pour the gravy over, and bake. 

SOLE PIE. 

572. — Split some soles from the bone, and cut the fins dose ; 
season with a mixture of salt, pepper, a little nutm^, and 
pounded mace, and put them in layers with oysters; they 
eat excellently. A pair of middling-sized ones will do, and 
2 to 3 dozen of oysters. Put in the dish the oyster-liquor, 
2 or 3 spoonfuls of broth, and some butter ; or, omit the broth, 
and make a strong fish gravy. When the pie comes home, 
pour in a cupful of thick cream, or milk boiled up with a tea- 
spoonful of flour ; if there be sauce enough in the pie, leave 
out the cream. 

Pike, perchj and carp may be each made into savoury piee. 



Chap. XXH.] FISH PIES. 431 

if cut into fillets, seasoned, and baked in puff-paste ; but will 
be much improved by the addition of an eel to increase the 
richness of the dish, and even by a few gudgeons, mingled 
with the fillets. Sauce may be made of the bones, if meat be 
not allowed ; but if veal broth be used, then cream should be 
added. 

PILCHARD AND LEEK PIE, 

573. — Clean and skin the white part of some large leeks ; 
scald in milk and water, and put them in layers into a dish, 
and between the layers 2 or 3 salted pilchards which have been 
soaked for some hours the day before ; cover the whole with a 
good plain crust. When the pie i& taken out of the oven, lift 
up the side-crust with a knife, and empty out all the liquor ; 
then pour in i pint of scalded cream.. 

This is a Devonshire dish ; and may be made, in the same 
way, of herrings, or any sort of fish, with or without cream. 

LOBSTER PIE. 

574. — ^Boil 2 lobsters, or 3 if small ; take out the tails, cut 
them in 2, take out the gut, cut each in 4 pieces, and lay in a 
small dish ; then put in the meat of the claws, and that you 
have picked out of the body ; pick out the furry parts from 
the latter, and take out the lady ; beat the spawn in a mortar, 
set the shells on to stew with some water, 2 or 3 spoonfuls of 
vinegar, pepper, salt, and some pounded mace ; a large piece 
of butter, rolled in flour, must be added, when the goodness of 
the shells is obtained ; give a boil or two, and pour into the 
dish strained ; strew some crumbs, and put a paste over all ; 
bake slowly, but only till the pctste be done. 

OYSTER PIE, 

675. — As you open the oysters separate them firom the liquor, 
which strain ; parboil them after taking off the beards. Par- 
boil sweetbreads, and, cutting them in slices, lay them and the 
oysters in layers ; season very lightly with salt, pepper, and 
mace ; then put i a teacupful of liquor, and the same of veal 
gravy. Bake in a slow oven ; and before you serve, put a tea- 
cupful of cream, a little more oyster-liquor, and a cup of white 
gravy, all warmed, but not boiled.

FBUrr FIES, PUFFS, PUDDINGS^ kc. 



576. — All pies made either with summer fruit or with winter 
preserves will be improved by a mixture of apples, pared and 
sliced. Apples will this way eke out the remains cdf a pot of 
jam with advanta^. They are especially good with fresk 
cherries, currants, &c., and will be found an agreeable adifi- 
tion to cranberries. Equal portions also of cranberries and 
any very sweet jam will improve both. When a;^les are 
mixed with jam, they should be sliced thin ; and if symp be 
wanted, a few slices boiled with a little of the jam in so^ 
and water. In making pies of green gooseberries, apples, or 
rhubarb, the sugar shoidd be clarified — that is, boUed in a 
little water, but no water poured into the pie, as it destroys 
the flavour of the fruit. For fresh fruits short crust is very 
suitable. 

Fresh Fruit Pies, of all descriptions, whether cherry, green 
gooseberry, damson, currant, or raspberry, may be all made in 
nearly the same manner, taking care that the fruit be fresh- 
gathered and cleanly picked ; also observing that, if the goose- 
berries be very sour, they should be put for i of an hour in 
boiling water, i lb. of sugar is usually allowed to every lb. of 
fruit. ' 

When pies have been kept until cold the crust becomes 

■In making pies of a very jtiicy fruit, it is a common practice to puts 
teacup into the dish to collect the liquor, and thus prevent it from over^ 
flowing the edges. This not only has a vulgar appearance, but is actuated 
by a false principle, as when the cup is first put into the dish it is f\ill of cold 
air, and when the pie is placed in the oven, the heat will cause the air to 
expand and fill the cup, and will drive out all the juice and a portion of the 
present air it contains, in which state it will remain till removed from the 
oven, when the air in the cup will condense and occupy a very small space, 
leaving the remainder to be filled with juice, but this does not take place till 
the danger of the juice boiling over is past. 



Chap. XXIH.] FRUIT PIES. 483 



heavy and indigestible; w(en next used they should there- 
fore be put before the fire to warm the crust luid lighten it. 

Strew pounded loaf-sugar over the crusty or ice it with the 
white of an egg whipped up to a froth and laid over it. 

APPLE PIE. 

577. — Pare, core, and quarter the apples^ boil the cores 
and parings in sugar and water ; strain off the liquor, adding 
more sugar ; grate the rind of a lemon over the apples, and 
squeeze the juice into the syrup ; mix half a dozen cloves with 
the fruit, put in a piece of butter the size of a* walnut, and add 
or omit a glass of wine ; cover with puff-paste. 

Codling Tart. — Scald the firuit ; when ready, take off the 
thin skin, and lay them whole in a dish ; put a little of the 
water that the apples were boiled in at bottom, strew th^oi 
over with powdered lump sugar ; when cold, put a paste round 
the edges and over. When the tart is baked, smear the crust 
with white of egg, and sift over it some powdered sugar. 
Serve with custard. 

Or: — ^Line the bottom of a shallow dish with paste; lay 
the apples in it, sweeten, and lay little twists of paste over in 
bars. 

Pippin Tarts. — Pare thin 2 Seville or China oranges, boil 
the peel tender, and shred it fine ; pare and core a dozen of 
good-sized apples, and put them in a stewpan, with as little 
water as possible ; when half done, add i lb. of sugar, the 
orange-peel, and juice ; boil till pretty thick. When cold, put 
it into a shallow dish, or pattypans lined with paste, to turn 
out, and be eaten cold. 

The mode of making the New-fashioned Apple-pie is to pare 
and quarter the apples, scald them, beat them with a spoon 
with some of the liquor, add grated lemon-peel, the juice of 
a lemon or Seville orange, or a part of a quince, when they 
are to be got, cloves, white sugar finely pounded, and a piece 
of butter ; put a paste round the dish, and cover it with bars 
or flowers of paste — the excellence of the pie consisting of the 
sort of apple and the goodness of the paste ; the fruit should 
be raised in the middle, as it shrinks in the baking. 

Stewed Apples. — Slice 2 or 3 good-sized peeled apples in 
thick slices, then put them into a small stewpan, with a few 
cloves and some parings of lemon or orange, and let it stew 

2 F 



484 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERF. [Chap. XIDI 

for about i of an hour in a couple of glasses of white wine. 
It may be done while the family are at dinner, and the apples 
eat better than in a pie. They should be thrown into cold 
water when sliced, to prevent their becoming dry and dis- 
coloured. The apples may be also mixed with pears or plums, 
and will be found excellent. 

RHUBARB PIE OR TART. 

578. — ^Take the stalks from the leaves, and peel <^ the thin 
skin ; cut them into pieces about an inch long, and as you do 
80 sprinkle a little fine sugar into the basin. For a quart 
basin, heaped, take 1 lb. of common lump-sugar ; boil it in 
nearly 4 pint of water to a thin syrup ; when skimmed, pot 
the rhubarb into it, and as it simmers shake the pan often over 
the fire. It will turn yellow at first, but keep it very geody 
doing until it greens, and then take it off. When cold lay it 
in the tart-dish, with only as much syrup as will make it veiy 
moist. Put a light crust over it, and when that is baked the 
tart will be done enough ; quarter the crust, and fill the dish 
with custard or cream. Many persons think the flavour of the 
rhubarb injured by taking off the peel. 

TARTLETS 

579. — Are always so called when made of a small size and 
uncovered with a crust ; nor should preserved fruit of any kind 
be put under crust. The paste is made stiff enough to support 
the contents, being cut thin, put into pattypans, and cri^^)ed 
at the edges. The fruit is then frequently ornamented with 
small strips of paste laid over it crossvidse, which are made 
thus : — ^Mix i lb. of flour, 1 oz. of fresh butter, and a little 
cold water ; rub it well between the board and your hand till 
it beg^s to string ; cut it into small pieces, roll it out, and 
draw it into fine strings ; then lay them in any way you please 
across your tartlets, aiid bake immediately. 

The jam of raspberries, currants, or any other fruits, as well 
as the marmalade of apricot, quince, and apple, may be made 
into tartlets ; and when baked in a quick oven may be filled 
up with raw custard or whipped cream. 

Orange Tartlets. — Squeeze, pulp, and boil tender 2 Seville 
oranges ; weigh twice their weight of sugar ; beat both together 
to a paste ; then add the juice and pulp of the fruit, and the 



ObAP. XXin.] TABTLETS. 436 

size of a walnut of fresh butter, and beat all tc^ether. Choose 
a very shallow dish or small pattypans, line it with a light 
puff crust, and lay the paste of orange in it. You may ice it. 

Lemon Tartlets, — ^Pare, rather thick, tbe rinds of 4 lemons, 
which boil tender in 2 waters, and beat fine ; sidd to it 4 oz. of 
blanched almonds cut thin, 4 oz. of lump^ugar, the juice of 
the lemons, and a little grated peel ; simmer to a syrup ; when 
cold, turn it into a shallow tin tart-dish lined with a rich thin 
puff-paste, and lay bars of paste over ; as soon as the paste is 
baked, take it out. 

Or : — ^Take the juice of 2 lemons and the rinds grated ; 
clean the grater with bread, only using sufficient crumbs to 
take off all the lemon-peel ; beat all together with 2 eggs, 
i lb. of loaf-sugar, and i lb. of butter. This is sufficient to 
make 12 tartlets, and will be found very excelloit. 

Green Apricot Tartlets, — ^When the waU-firtut trees are 
thinned, take the thinnings before the stone is formed ; stew 
them gently in sugar and water. When tender, reduce and 
thicken the syrup, and put it with the fruit into pattypcms ; 
or, if covered with a paste, it is then called a pie. This also 
applies to grapes. 

Prune Tart. — Give prunes a scald, take out the stones 
and break them ; put the kernels into a little cranberry-juice, 
with the prunes and sugar : simmer, and when cold make a 
tart of the sweetmeat. 

It must be almost needless to say that tartlets of damsons, 
plums, and most sorts of stone-fruit, may be made in the same 
manner. 

Tartlets a la Paganini. — Beat up the whites of 3 eggs to 
a froth, and then add 5 oz. of pounded sugar ; beat it well 
up, and have your pattypans ready covered with paste, upon 
which put any quantity you please of jam or marmalade; 
bake them for about i an hour, and when done fill them with 
the whip. This quantity will fill 16 pattypans of a small size. 

TO PREPARE CRANBERRIES FOR TARTS, 

680. — Simmer them in moist sugar, without breaking, 20 
minutes ; and let them become cold before being used. A pint 
will require nearly 3 oz. of sugar. 

The Russian and American sorts are larger and better 
flavoured than those of this country.

The juice, when expressed from the baked fruit, and sweet- 
ened, makes a fine drink in fevers. 

Stewed with sugar, they eat excellently with bread. 

The observation concerning '^ fever-drink" applies equally 
to the expressed juice of unripe grapes, from which, when 
used instead of lemons, is made the celebrated Gaspaehod 
the Spaniards, &r superior to lemonade. 

PUFFS, 

681. — Regent's Pastry, — Take i lb. of almonds g^und into 
flour, a little powdered sugar, and a few drops of some con- 
crete essence ; make it into a paste with the white of an egg ; 
then make another paste with sugar, flour, and butter, worked 
up with the whites of eggs ; roll it out ; then lay it upon the 
almond-paste, and cut both together into shapes, brush them 
over \i4th eggy then sprinkle chopped almonds over them, and 
bake upon buttered paper in a tart-pan ; ornament the pastiy 
with jam when it comes from the oven. 

Apple Puffs. — Pare and core the fixdt, and either stew 
them in a stone jar on a hot hearth, or bake them. When cold, 
mix the pulp of the apple with sugar and lemon-peel shred 
fine, taking as little of the apple-juice as you can. Bake them 
in thin paste, in a quick oven : i of an hour will do them if 
small. Orange or quince marmalade is a great improvement. 
Cinnamon pounded or orange-flower water as a variety. 

Lemon Puffs, — Pound and sifl i lb. of loaf-sugar, grate the 
rind of 1 large lemon or 2 small ones ; then whip up the white 
of an egg to a froth, and mix all together to the consistency of 
good paste ; cut it into shapes, and bake upon writing-paper, 
being careful not to handle the paste : the oven must be very 
slow for this purpose. 

Cheese Puffs, — Strain cheese-curd from the whey, and 
beat i pint of it fine in a mortar, with 1^ spoonful of flour, 
3 eggs, but only 1 white, a spoonful of orange-flower water, 
i of a nutmeg, and sugar to make it pretty sweet ; lay a little 
of this paste, in very small round cakes, on a tin plate. If the 
oven is hot, i of an hour will bake them. Serve with pudding- 
sauce. 

To those who make cheese, these puffs are not bad ; but they 
are hardly worth the trouble of preparing the curd. 

Parmesan Puffs, — Take i lb. of cheese, the same quantity 



Chap. XXHI.] PUFFS. 437 

of bread-crumbs, and 2 oz. of butter ; pound these well in a 
mortar, beat up an egg, and mix it up into the paste, making 
the whole up into baUs about the size of a golden pippin ; make 
a thin batter with flour, milk, and 1 egg ; dip the balls into 
this, and fry them a light brown. 

Excellent Light Puffs, — Mix 2 spoonfuls of flour, a little 
grated lemon-peel, some nutmeg, i spoonful of brandy, a little 
loaf-sugar, and 1 egg ; then fiy it enough, but not brown ; 
beat it in a mortar with 5 eggs, whites and yolks ; put a quan- 
tity of lard in a frying-pan, and when quite hot drop a dessert- 
spoonful of batter at a time ; turn as they brown. Serve them 
inmiediately with sweet sauce. 

Spanish Puffs, — Put 1 oz. of fresh butter into a quart stew- 
pan ; when hot, put in 4 spoonfuls of flour ; stir it over the 
fire for 5 minutes ; have ready boiling a gill of milk, which 
stir in by degrees so as to avoid making it lumpy ; when it is 
thoroughly boiled, take it ofi* the fire, stir in 6 eggs, a pinch 
of salt, a little nutmeg, chopped lemon-peel, and a handful of 
currants, with sugar to palate, and sufficient orange-flower 
water to flavour it ; let it ^et cold ; when wanted for use have 
some lard boiling, make the batter into balls the size of a small 
walnut, fry them imtil they burst ; drain ; dust them over with 
powdered sugar ; serve with wine-sauce. 

German Puffs, — Put i lb. of butter into a breakfast-cupful 
of milk, place the pan upon the fire, and when it boils add a 
cupfiil of flour ; beat all well together, and, when cold, mix in 
6 eggs, leaving out 2 of the whites ; beat up some sugar and 
grated lemon-peel with the eggs, and bake the pu£& in a 
moderately-heated oven. 

Austrian Puffs. — 2 oz. of pounded almonds, the same of 
clarified butter and sifled sugar, 2 spoonfuls of flour, the yolks 
of 2 eggs, i pint of cream, and- a little orange-flower water ; 
beat all together, butter the pans, fill them only half full, and 
bake for i an hour in a slow oven. 

French Puffs, — Take a pint of new milk, boil half, and mix 
the other half very smoothly with 4 heaped spoonfuls of fine 
flour ; then add it to the boiling milk, and boil it until it is a 
stiff paste. When cold, take the yolks of 5 eggs, the whites 
of 2, a tablespoonful of sifled sugar, and beat the whole into a 
light batter in a marble mortar ; then drop it from a spoon into 
boiling lard, fry of a light brown, and serve it up with sifted 



438 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXUL 

sugar over each. A small piece of any candied fruit maj be 
dropped into each spoonful of batter. 

Irish Puffs. — Pound i lb. of sweet and 1 oz. of bitter 
almonds, but not too finely ; take i lb. of loaf-sugar ponnkd 
and sifted, the whites of 2 eggs beaten to a thick fi«^ ; mix 
all together, and put the puf& into pattypans covered with 
paste ; then sift powdered sugar over them thickly, and faib 
them a light brown. The flavour may be improved by pound- 
ing the aimonds with orange-flower water or a little esseoee 
of lemon. 

Lady Abbesses Puffs, — Take 3 oz. of Jordan almoiHls and 
i oz. of butter, with 2 oz. of loaf-sugar ; pound them with a 
little rose-water till they become a thick paste ; spread the 
paste on buttered tins, and bake them in a dow oven. When 
cold, put a spoonful of jam in each, and cover it with whipped 
cream. 

GA UFFRE8, 

582. — ^Take 4 or 5 oz. of flour, 3 oz. of pounded sugar, \ 
pint of whipped cream, 4 or 5 eggs, a small stick of pounded 
vanilla, a grating of nutmeg, and a little salt, with a glass of 
cura9oa or ratafia. 

Place the flour, sugar, and salt in a basin, then add the ydk 
of eggs, the vanilla, and the spirit, mixing them well toge&er, 
and gradually adding the whipped cream. Just before using 
the batter, add the whites of eggs, whipped to a froth, and mix 
them in lightly, so as to thoroughly incorporate them with it 

Bake these gauflres in tongs made for the purpose, observing, 
however, that the iron be very carefully heated, and the super- 
fluous heat allowed to go off* previously to filling them with 
batter ; rub the tongs with fresh butter ; fill the bottom part 
with batter, and fasten on the top, then turn it, and, when a fine 
brown on both sides, shake some pounded spice and sugar over 
them, and send them to table. 

They may be spread with any kind of preserve or jelly. 

Gauffres a la Flaanande, — Take 6 eggs well beaten, mix 
into them \ lb. of flour to a smooth paste ; dissolve a piece of 
German yeast, about the size of a nutmeg, in a wineglassful 
of warm water, with a gill of warm milk, a little salt, 2 table- 
spoonfuls of orange-flower water, and 6 oz. of butter ; mix 
them with the flour till all is well worked, using a wooden 
spoon ; set it in a warm place for nearly 2 hours, when it will 



Chap. XXTTT,] GAUFFRES, &o. 489 



have risen 2 or 3 inches ; work it round a little to subdue the 
fermentation ; let it stand i an hour, and it will be fit for use. 
Put the gauffire-irons upon a slow fire, letting both sides be 
hot ; wipe them, and rub the inside slightly with a bit of &t 
bacon ; put in 2 spoonfuls of the paste, dose the irons, and 
bake them for a few minutes. The colour should be a light 
gold colour, and very crisp. The irons can be Aialf-openedto 
see if it is done. When c^ the proper colour, turn it out, and 
proceed with the remainder in the same way. Take 1 lb. of 
loaf-sugar, and i oz. of cinnamon, pounded and passed through 
a sieve ; dip the gaufires into it on both sides, and serve hot 
upon a napkin. Place them in the form of a pyramid. 

MINCJE-PIES, 

583. — In making these, the first thing to be done is to pre- 
pare the mince-meat. The following are selected from a 
variety of receipts, all excellent for the purpose : — 

Take 2 lbs. of raisins stoned, 2 lbs. of currants, 1 lb. of 
sultana raisins, 2 lbs. of apples, | lb. of sugar, 2 lbs. of suet, 
the juice of 2 lemons, and the rind of 1 chopped very fine ; 
i lb. of mixed spice,* 2 glasses of brandy, 2 oz. of citron, and 
2 of candied l^non-peel. 

Or : — 2 lbs. of the inside of a sirloin of beef, boiled, and 
picked from skin, and 44 lbs. of suet, all chopped very fine. 
Take 8 large apples chopped, 6 lbs. of currants clean washed 
and dried, a twopenny loaf grated, 1 oz. of nutmegs, i oz. of 
cloves, a little pepper and salt, H lb. of sugar ; grate the peel 
of an orange and a lemon, add the juice of 6 oranges and 2 
lemons : mix all these ingredients well together, pour over the 
whole a pint of port wine and one of brandy. Add sweetmeats 
in making the pies. 

Or : — Take i lb. of lean beef, boiled well and chopped fine, 
2 lbs. of suet also chopped fine, 1 lb. of moist sugar, 1 lb. of 
oarefrilly washed and picked currants, 1 lb. of raisins (when 
stoned, to be chopped), 9 good sound winter apples, peeled, 
cored, and chopped, and the grated rind of a lemon ; season 
with mixed spice and a teaspoonfrd of salt ; thoroughly mix 
the whole ; add a wineglassfrd of port wine and 2 of brandy ; 

* 2 oz. cinnamoi^ 2 oz. allspice, 2 oz. doves, ^ oz. nutmeg, } oz. ginger, 
2 oz. coriander, all finely powdered and mixed, make a yery good mvMd 
tpicCf and should be bottled and kept well corked. 



440 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIH. 

press it down into a stone jar, and keep it well covered ; irhm 
the pies are filled, lay sliced candied peel on the top of the 
meat. 

The following we particularly recommend for its being oont* 
municated by a celebrated tavern-keeper, from whom we have 
received much valuable information : — 1 lb. each of currantB, 
Yalentia raisins, Ripston pippins, calfs-foot, and pickled ox* 
tongue boiled and chopped ; i lb. of suet, i lb. of sugar, i Ox 
of candied peel, li pint of wine and brandy, the juice of 2 
lemons, with a small teaspoonful of mixed spice. 

Any of these receipts being now prepared, mix the ingre* 
dients well together with the hands, and put it into a jar or 
jars for use. The flavour of the mince-meat will be much 
improved by lying together a few days before it is used. It 
will keep good for many weeks, or even months. 

To make the pies, have some pans of any required size, or 
a small dish or plate. Cover them first with a sheet of short 
paste, made with i lb. of butter rubbed in with 1 lb. of floor, 
and made into rather a stiff paste with water ; then fill than, 
well with the mince-meat, making it high in the centre, leaving 
a little space from the edge ; sprinkle or moisten these edges 
with water, and put on a moderately thick covering of very 
light puff-paste ; trim the paste off to the edge of the pan, and 
bake in a moderately-heated oven. When the crust is done, 
so are the pies. 

LENT PIES. 

684. — ^Boil a dozen eggs quite hard, and chop the yolks very 
fine ; chop also a dozen of moderate-sized juicy apples, 
peeled and cored, together with 2 lbs. of stoned raisins ; add 
2 lbs. of currants, 1 lb. of sugar, and a tablespoonful each of 
powdered cinnamon, nutmeg, and beaten mace ; take also the 
juice and grated peel of 3 ripe lemons, with i lb. of citron cut 
into slips ; mix all these thoroughly, and moisten the whole 
with a pint each of white wine and brandy. If at hand, a 
little rose-water may be added, and ratafia may be used instead 
of brandy. 

SWEET PATTIES. 

586.— Chop the meat of a boiled calf s-foot, of which you 
use the liquor for jelly, with 2 apples, 1 oz. of orange and 
lemon peel candied, and some fresh peel and juice ; mix with 
them i a nutmeg grated, the yolk of an egg, a spoonful of 



Chap. XXHI.] CHEESECAKES. 441 

brandy, and 4 oz. of currants, washed and dried ; bake in small 
pattypans. 

Croustade or Dresden Paities. — Slice some stale bread 
about ^ inch thick ; cut from it, with a round paste-cutter, as 
many croustades as will be required : mark the centres witli a 
smaller cutter, scoop out the insides as in paste patties, then 
fry them a light brown, drain them well, and fill them with 
any hot compote of fruit or hot preserve. • The croustade may 
be filled witii any sort of minced meat or fowl, and served as 
an entree in the first course. They are very nice made with 
the rounds of a French roll ; it should be pared very thin, 
then cut in rounds of such thickness as to allow the centres to 
be taken out ; dip them in milk, and let them drain ; do not let 
them break ; brush them with e^y and sift the rasping of the 
roll over them; fry them a pale brown, and fill with oysters, 
stewed mushrooms, &c., or, as above, with fruit qr preserve. 

Patties resembling Mince Pies. — Chop the kidney and 
&,t of cold veal, apple, orange, and lemon-peel candied, fresh 
currants, a little wine, 2 or 3 cloves, a little brandy, and a bit 
of sugar. Bake as before. 

Patties with Curds, — Take some very rich milk, put into 
it some lemon-juice or vinegar, place it on the fire that it may 
curdle, drain off the whey through a sieve ; add to the curds 
the yolk of an e^ beaten up in 2 spoonfuls of milk, a few 
currants, and a little pounded cinnamon. Make the paste 
and prepare the patties in the same way as in the preceding 
receipt. 

CHEESECAKES, 

586. — Strain the whey from the curd of 2 quarts of mUk ; 
when rather dry crumble it through a coarse sieve, and mix 
with 6 oz. of fresh butter, 1 oz. of pounded blanched almonds, 
a little orange-flower water, i a glass of raisin wine, a grated 
biscuit, 4 oz. of currants, some nutmeg and cinnamon in fine 
powder, and beat all the above with 3 eggs and i pint of 
cream till quite light: then line the pattypans with a thin 
puff paste, and fill them three parts full. 

A plainer sort — Turn 3 quarts of milk to curd, break it, 
and drain the whey : when dry, break it in a pan, with 2 oz. 
of butter, till perfectly smooth ; put to it Hpint of thin cream 
or good milk, and add sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and 3 oz. of 
currants. 



442 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXHI. 

Another way. — Mix the curd of 3 quarts of milk, 1 lb. 
of currants, 12 oz. of Lisbon sugar, i oz. of cinnamon and 
nutmeg, the peel of 1 lemon beaten in a mortar, the yolks of 
8 and whites of 6 eggs, a pint of scalding cream, and a glass 
of brandy. Put a light thin pufT-paste in the pattypans, and 
three parts fill them. 

Mm BraJtJhfs Cheesecakes.^ — ^Tbe yolks of 8 eggs, 8 oz. of 
sugar finely-powdered and sifted, 8 oz. of sweet almonds 
powdered, beat all together till very white. Line the pans 
with a thin paste ; immediately before you put them into the 
oven, mix the size of a walnut of butter melted into them over 
a fire. \i the oven be too hot they will &11 when taken out. 

On — 10 eggs, leave out half the whites, 1 lb. of sugar 
finely powdered and sifted, \ lb. of flour, 3 oz. of butter, 3 os. 
of sweet almonds, with a glass of brandy put into them while 
thejr are pounding. Beat them all together, and butter the 
pans very will. 

Wiihoul J9iil^.r^Beat the yolks of 10 eggs and the 
whites of 5 separately, beat them extremely well, 1 lb. of 
sugar powdered and sifted, put to your eggs by spoonfuls ; 
beat both till very white ; add 14 oz. of flour, 2 or 3 spoonfuls 
of brandy, and some carraway seeds. 

Lemon Cheesecakes, — ^Mix 4 oz. of siftied lump sugar and 
4 oz. of butter, and gently melt it ; then add the yolks of 2 
and the white of 1 egg, the rind of 3 lemons shred fine, and 
the juice of H, 1 l^voy biscuit, some blanched almonds 
pounded, 3 spoonfuls of brandy. 

Or: — Boil 2 large lemons, or 3 small ones, and after 
squeezing pound them well together in a mortar, taking out 
the inner skin ; add 4 oz. of loaf sugar, the yolks of 6 ^gs, 
and 8 oz. of fresh butter. Fill the pattypans half full. 

Orange Cheesecakes, — ^When you have blanched ^ lb. of 
almonds, beat them very fine, with orange-flower water, ^ lb. 
of fine sugar beaten and sifted, and 1 lb. of butter that has 
been melted carefully without oiling, and which must be 
nearly cold before you use it ; th^i beat the yolks of 10 and 
whites of 4 ^gs ; pound 2 candied oranges, and a fresh one 
with the bitterness boiled out, till as t^ider as marmalade, 
without any lumps ; beat the whole together, and put into 
pattypans. 

Almond Cheesecakes. — ^Blanch and pound 4 oz. of almonds, 



Chap. XXIII.] CHEESECAKES. 448 

and a few bitter, with a spoonful of water ; then add 4 oz. of 
sugar pounded, a spoonful of cream, and the whites of 2 eggs 
well beaten ; mix all as quick as possible ; put into very 
small pattypans, and bake in a rather warm oven under 20 
minutes. 

Another. — Press the whey from as much curd as will fill 
2 dozen small pattypans ; then put it on the back of a sieve, 
and with i oz. of butter rub it through with the back of a 
spoon ; put to it 6 yolks and 3 whites of eggs, and a few 
almonds of both sorts pounded, with as much sugar as will 
make the curd properly sweet ; mix with these a win^lassful 
of sherry or Madeira, in which boil the rind of a Seville orange, 
if you can get one, or, if not, a large ripe one of the common 
kind, with ^1 its juice. Beat all gradually together, and when 
thoroughly blended fill the pattypans ; the baking will take 
from i of an hour to 20 minutes. 

Potato Cheesecake, — 4 oz. of butter, the same of pounded 
sugar, 6 oz. of potatoes boiled and floured through a sieve, 
the rind of 1 lemon, and half the juice, unless acid is desirable ; 
mix these ingredients well together, with 2 eggs, and fill the 
tart-pan and bake it. 

CHEESECAKE-STOCK, that will keep for aeveral years,— E, R. 

587. — To i lb. of butter put 1 lb. of loaf-sugar broken into 
small pieces, 6 eggs, leaving out 2 whites, the rind of 3 lemons 
grated, and the juice of 3 ; put them all into a pan, and let 
them simmer over the fire until the sugar is dissolved, and it 
begins to thicken like honey. When cold put it into sweet- 
meat-pots for use. When made into cheesecakes, add grated 
sweet biscuits. 

Line the small tartlet-pans used for these small cakes with 
good, but not too light, pufi'-paste : make them of a deep 
yellow colour, and put on each a strip of candied citron. 

ICING FOB FRUIT PIES AND TARTS. 

588. — The common mode is to take the white of an eggj 
whisked to a froth, mixed thickly with poimded sugar, and 
laid on with a quill feather. For larger tarts it should, how- 
ever, be laid on more thickly, and comfits or lemon-peel may 
be stuck into it. 




444 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Gha». TSSL 



PUDDINGS. 

589. — There are two different sorts of paste for paddoBfj^ 
one for meai and the other for fruit. 

For Meat Pudding.— To 1 lb. of floor add 8 en. of findj 
chopped beef-fmet cat from the kidner. Mix it with water, 
bat do not wet it too mach : after mixing it well togetber 
with a wooden ftpoon, roll out the paste and put in the moit; 
then close it ; boil it in a cloth which has been floiiredy tie it 
up, but leave sufficient room to permit the sweiliDg of the 
paste. 

Veal-suet may also be used, but that of beef is better ; or a 
mixture of both is not bad. If puddings be boiled in shapes, 
the crust is not near so light. 

For Fruit Puddings the paste should be made as for a pie 
— ^using butter instead of suet; but, unless for the sake of 
appearance, they should never be boiled in diapes. A very 
little salt added to all paste much improves it. 

Sweet Pudding. — ^Yery good puddings may be made without 

eggn ; but they should have very little liquid added to them, 
and mast boil longer than puddings with eggs. A spoonful of 
yeast will serve instead of 2 eggs, and a pinch of soda will make 
it still lighter. 2 large spoonfuls of snow will supply the place 
of 1 e^^ and make a pudding equally good. Tlus is a useful 
piece of information, as snow generally falls in the season 
when e^^ are dear. The sooner it is used after it £dls the 
better ; but it may be taken up from a clean spot, and kept in 
a cool place some hours, without losing its good qualities. 
Bottled malt-liquors are also a good substitute for ^gs ; the 
sooner used after the cork is drawn the better. Eggs should 
always be broken separately into a cup before they are thrown 
together, as a single bad one might occasion the loss of a great 
many without this precaution : the yolks and whites, beaten 
long and separately, make the article they are put into much 
lighter. They must always be strained after bating. 

To avoid repetition, let it be observed that, when pudding* 
sauce is ordered, wine, sugar, and very thick melted butter, 
boiled up together, is the sauce intended. 

If the pudding be partly of bread, the cloth should be tied 
so as to allow for swelling ; if of flour, rather more tight 



Chap. XXIH.] PUDDINGS. 445 

Basins or forms are much better in appearance than cloths for 
boiling puddings, but it makes them &r less light. 

The water should boil quickly when the pudding is put in, 
and care taken that it continues to do so, or the pudding will 
be heavy ; and it should be moved about for a minute or two, 
that the ingredients may not separate. 

All dishes in which puddings are baked should be lined 
with paste an inch or two below the edge, as well as on it ; 
the dish must be first rubbed with butter. If a pudding is 
to be turned out &om a mould, it must be entirely lined with 
paste. 

The ingredients of puddings should not be put into the basin 
or dish till the minute they go into the water or oven. 

SagOy and all sorts of seeds j should lie in water an hour 
before they are made into puddings, and be well washed ; the 
want of this caution causes an earthy taste. 
' If the butter be strong that is used in puddings, they will 
not taste well, whatever good things are added. 

A small pinch of salt improves the flavour of all mixtures, 
even when the other ingredients are sweet. 

Well-made raisin or Cape wine will serve, in most cases, 
when wine is ordered for puddings. 

As the goodness of boiled puddings greatly depends upon 
keeping the ingredients closely but not too compactly together, 
the cook should take care to have moulds and basins in readi- 
ness that will exactly hold the quantity directed. 

Puddings of bread or flour are much better if all the ingre- 
dients be mixed (except the eggs) 3 hours before boiling or 
baking ; and they should be well stirred just before they are 
put into the oven or saucepan. 

Plum-puddings are best boiled in a stout cloth well floured ; 
care should be taken that it does not burn to the bottom of 
the kettle ; to prevent this put a plate at the bottom. When 
the pudding is of a large size it is best to mix all but the 
liquid ingredients the day before it is boiled. 

When butter is ordered to be put warm into puddings, the 
addition of a little milk or wine will prevent its oiling. 

Custard Puddings to look well should simmer only, but 
without stopping. If boiled in a quick or careless manner the 
surface will not be smooth, but have little holes like honey- 
comb all over it. A sheet of writing-paper, thickly buttered, 
should be put on the top of the mould before the lid or cloth 



446 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXffl. 

is put on, and the pudding should stand in the mould 5 minutes 
after being lifted from the water. Many persons prefer their 
puddings steamed, but when this is not done they should be 
put into plenty of boiling water, and kept well covered. 

Half an hour should be allowed for boiling a bread-pudding 
in a half-pint basin, and so on in proportion ; but puddings 
made up with i lb. of suet, and any other ingredients, will 
require 2 hours. 

SUET PUDDINGS. 

590. — Finely chop 1 lb. of beef suet ; mix with it li lb. of 
flour, 2 eggs well beaten, a little salt, and as little milk as 
will mix it. Boil 4 hours. It eats well next day cut in slices 
and fried, and may be eaten either with salt or sugar. 

Or : — Take 8 oz. of grated bread, 3 oz. of finely chopped 
suet, and 4 oz. of pounded loaf-sugar, the juice and grated 
peel of 2 lemons, and 1 egg well beaten ; mix all together ; 
put it into a buttered basin and boil 1 hour ; or make it into 
dumplings, and boil 20 minutes. Serve with wine sauce. 

Of veal-stiet, cut the crumb of a threepenny loaf* into 
slices ; boil and sweeten 2 quarts of new milk, and pour over 
it. When soaked, pour out a little of the milk, and mix with 
6 eggs well beaten and half a nutmeg. Lay the slices of 
br^id into a dish, with layers of currants and finely chopped 
veal-suet, 1 lb. of each. Butter the dish well, and bake ; or 
you may boil it in a basin if you prefer it. 

Sails of suet pudding, not larger than the size of an egg, 
are put into gravy soup. They will take from 20 minutes to i 
an hour boiling ; in that time they will be done through, and 
so light as to swim to the top. They may be also served 
separately, and are an excellent accompaniment to corned 
beef. 

BEEF-STEAK PUDDING. 

591. — Of all savoury puddings perhaps those made with 
beef are the best. The following is the mode of making them 
in all the clubs : — 

Take from 1 lb. to Hlb. of the inside of a sirloin of beef, or 
the same quantity of rump-steak, cutting off part of the i^t : 
beat it until tender, cut it thin and divide into smaU slices 
along with 2 mutton kidneys or 1 veal kidney ; to these add 
a dozen of native oysters, bearded. The whole is then sea- 



Chap. XXIH.] MEAT PUDDINGS. 447 

soned with pepper and salt and a minced shalot. Boil it from 
2^ to 3 hours. When done have ready some strong beef- 
gravy, made savoury with a little mu8hn)om ketchup ; make 
a hole in the paste and pour it into the pudding. 

If for sl family pudding the oysters and the kidneys may be 
omitted : let the steak be prepared as above, adding, if you 
choose, some layers of sliced onions. 

MUTTON AND KIDNEY PUDDING. 

592. — Cut slices from an underdone leg of mutton, with 
kidneys, sufficient to form alternate layers, mixed with some 
minced onions. It may be made either in a shape or 
solely in paste, but in either case it should not be very highly 
seasoned : it should, however, have some good gravy, to be 
poured into it when boiled, for which walnut-ketchup will be 
found more appropriate than mushroom. 

RABBIT PUDDING. 

593. — Clean the rabbit well, take off the head, and cut the 
carcaSe into pieces, as for a fiicajssee, leaving out the rib- 
bones ; then parboil the liver, mince it and mix it with the 
brains : that done, season the fricassee with pepper and salt, a 
little mushroom powder, and a clove of powdered mace ; lay 
the fricassee either in a shape or in the paste, mingling with 
it the mince, and interlaying it with a few thin slices of 
pickled pork : it will take nearly 2 hours boiling. The gravy 
may be made of the head, lights, and bones, with a bit of 
ham or bacon. 

CHICKEN P UDDING. 

594. — Fricassee 2 young chickens, season them slightly with 
a little mushroom powder, mace, nutmeg, and salt, but no 
pepper. Previously take the giblets and stew them down with 
a bit of meat to make gravy ; put 2 tablespoonfuls into the 
paste, and keep the rest to fill up or put under the pudding. 
2 hours will boil it. 

GAME PUDDINGS. 

595. — Game of any description maybe made into puddings, 
and when partly boned, well spiced, with minced truffle or 
mushroom, mace, and a clove of garlic, and boiled within a 
light paste, they are very rich, and the paste particularly 



448 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [CHAP.XXffl. 

as it absorbs so much of the gravy ; but the boiling deprives 
the game of much of its high flavour, and a woodcock or a snipe 
should never be so dressed, as they lose all the savour of the trail. 

Or : — Make a batter with flour, milk, eggs, pepper, and 
salt ; pour a little into the bottom of a pudding-dish ; then 
put seasoned poultry or game of any kind into it, and a little 
shred onion ; pour the remainder of the batter over, and bake 
in a slow oven. 

A single chicken, partridge, or pigeon may be thus made 
into a dumpling : — Stuff* it with chopped oysters, lay it on its 
back in the paste, and put a bit of butter rolled in flour on the 
breast ; close the paste in the form of a dumpling, put into hot 
water, and let it boil for 2 hours. 

FISH PUDDINGS. 

596. — Take 2 haddocks raw ; bone them, beat them fine m 
a marble mortar, rub through a sieve ; then put the fish into 
the mortar with 2 eggs, 1 onion, a little parsley, pepper and 
salt, a slice of bread rubbed into crumbs, i lb. of veal suet 
chopped. Beat all together, put it into a shape, boil it an 
hour, turn it out and send it to table with a rich brown sauce* 
A little gravy-soup should be mixed with it whilst passing 
through the sieve. 

An excellent fish pudding may be made of eels, either 
alone or with kidney and oysters, as in eel-pie ; some very 
rich beef-sauce should be made and put under the pudding if 
boiled in paste, or in a sauce-boat if it be made in a shape* 

HERB PUDDINGS. 

697. — Pick 2 handfuls of parsley-leaves fMm the stems, 
half the quantity of spinach, 2 hearts of lettuces, a large hand- 
ful of mustard and cress, a few leaves of white beet, and a 
small handful of chives : wash, and boil all together 3 minutes ; 
drain the water from them, and mash very fine ; mix well, 
and add salt and pepper. Have ready a batter, made of 1 oz. 
of flour, a pint of thin cream, and 2 eggs ; stir it into the 
herbs, and cover the dish with a good crust. 

This pudding has much the flavour of omelet ; and in Lent, 
when the salads are all coming into season, it may be very 
aptly brought to table on fast-days. 

Tansy-pudding, — Pound a handful of green tansy in a 
moTta;^ ; add the juice to a pint of batter and bake it.

SWEET PUDDINGS. 

Under this head the plum-pudding stands foremost as a truly- 
national dish. The following receipt, communicated to a 
periodical publication by a man-cook of much experience, we 
can vouch for as an excellent way of making a 

RICH PLUM PUDDING, 

698. — Stone carefully 1 lb. of the best raisins, wash and pick 
1 lb. of currants,* chop very small 1 lb. of fresh beef suet, 
blanch and chop small or pound 2 oz. of sweet almonds and 
1 oz. of bitter ones; mix the whole well together, with 1 lb. 
of sifted flour, and the same weight of crumb of bread soaked 
in milk, then squeezed dry and stirred with a spoon until 
reduced to a mash, before it is mixed with the flour. Cut 
in small pieces 2 oz. each of preserved citron, orange, and 
lemon peel, and add i oz. of mixed spice : i lb. of moist 
sugar should be put into a basin, witiii 8 eggs, and well 
beaten together with a d-pronged fork; stir this with the 
pudding, and make it of a proper consistence with milk. Re- 
member that it must not be made too thin, or the fruit will 
sink to the bottom, but be made to the consistence of good 
thick batter. Two wineglassfuls of brandy should be poured 
over the fruit and spice, mixed together in a basin, and 
allowed to stand 3 or 4 hours before the pudding is made, 
stirring them occasionally. It must be tied in a cloth, and 
will take 5 hours of constant boiling. When done, turn it out 
on a dish, sift loaf-sugar over the top, and serve it with 
wine-sauce in a boat, and some poured round the pudding. 

The pudding will be of considerable size, but half the 
quantity of materials, used in the same proportion, will be 
equally good. 

In addition to the wine-sauce, have a metal sauce-boat flUed 
^ith brandy ; set it alight on the table, and pour a portion of 

* The best method of cleansing currants is to put them into a common co- 
lander, over a pan with suflficient water to cover ^em, rub them well between 
the hands in the water to separate the knobs, and stir them about. The 
small sand and gravel will then fall through the holes and sink to the bottom 
of the pan. After being washed clean, and the water drained from them, 
the large stones can then be easily picked out hj sorting them over on a large 
dish. — Family Herald,

it in a flame upon each slice of pudding. It will be found a 
great improvement. 

Shelford Pudding. — Mix i lb. of currants or raislDs, 1 lb. 
of suet, 1 lb. of flour, 6 eggs, a little good milk, some lonon- 
peel, a little salt. Boil it in a melon-shape 6 hours. 

Plum Puddings may also be made of different qualities, as 
follows : — 

The same proportions of flour and suet, and half the quantity 
of firuit, with spice, lemon, a glass of wine, or not, and 1 egg, 
and milk, will make an excellent pudding, if long boiled. 

A mealy potato, grated while hot, and beaten well with a 
spoonful of milk, will add greatly to the lightness of plom 
puddings, whether boiled or baked. 

Or : — A very light plum pudding may be made of grated 
bread, suet, and stoned raisins, 4 oz. each, mixed with 2 well- 
beaten eggs, 3 or 4 spoonfuls of milk, and a little salt. Boil 
4 hours. A spoonful of brandy, sugar, and nutmeg, in melted 
butter, may be served as sauce. 

Or : — The Frendi mode — Mix 6 oz. of suet, 7 oz. of grated 
bread, 2 oz. of sugar, i lb. of French plums, 3 well-beaten eggs, 
a small teacupful of milk, and a dessertspoonful of ratofla. 
Let it stand 2 hours, and boil it the same length of time. 
Observe to stir it well the last thing. 

These latter puddings may also be baked. 

HUNTEK8 PUDDING, 

599. — Mix 1 lb. each of suet, flour, currants, and raisins, 
the latter stoned and a little cut ; the rind of ^ a lemon shred 
as fine as possible, 6 Jamaica peppers in fine powder, 4 eggs, a 
glass of brandy, a little salt, and as little milk as will make it 
of a proper consistence ; boil it in a floured cloth or a melon- 
mould 8 or 9 hours. Serve with sweet-sauce. Add a spoon-* 
ful of peach-water for change of flavour. 

This pudding will keep, after it is boiled, 6 months, if kept 
tied up in the same cloth, and hung up, folded in a sheet of 
cap-paper to preserve it from dust, being first cold. When 
to be used, it must boil a full hour.

of milk ; add i lb. of raisins stoned, and a little sugar, and 
boil the whole 4 hours in a basin. 

BATTER PUDDING,— E. R, 

601. — To 6 oz. of flour add a little salt and a gill of milk ; 
mix them quite smooth, beat up 4 eggs and strain them, then 
add them to the batter, with more milk, until the mixture is 
as thick as good cream. Strain the batter, and put it into a 
basin rubbed with butter ; tie a clotli over it, and boil it 1 hour. 
The excellence of a batter pudding mainly depends upon its 
being strained twice, that is, the eggs first, and then the whole ; 
if tins point be observed, it will be as rich and as good as a 
custard pudding, without the danger of breaking. If it is 
wanted to be particularly fine, 1 or 2 eggs more may be added. 
Serve with melted butter, sugar, lemon-juice, and a glass of 
wine. 

Or : — Rub 3 spoonfuls of fine flour extremely smooth by 
d^rees into a pint of milk, with a saltspoonful of salt ; simmer 
till it thickens ; stir in 2 oz. of butter ; set it to cool ; then 
add the yolks of 3 eggs ; flour a cloth that has been wetted 
or butter a basin, and put the batter into it ; tie it tight, and, 
plunge it into boiling^water, the bottom upwards. Boil it li 
hour, and serve with plain butter. A little ginger, nutmeg, 
and lemon-peel may be added ; or currant jelly may be laid 
on the top. 

CUSTARD PUDDING. 

602. — Flavour a pint of milk with the peel of 1 lemon, an 
inch of cinnamon, and a bay-leaf ; when boiled sufliciently , 
strain it, and sweeten to palate : break 4 eggs, beat them up, 
pour the milk to them ; put it into a mould and boil for i an 
hour. Serve with wine-sauce. 

Or : — Mix 1 tablespoonful of flour into a pint of milk ; add 
4 eggs well beaten, a tablespoonful of pounded loaf-sugar^ 
and a little orange-flower water; put into a buttered basin, 
laying a paper over it before putting on the doth ; let it stand 
4 minutes before turning it out. It should boil i an hour. 

Baked, — A plain but good custard pudding may be made by 
boiling a quart of milk until it is reduced to a pint ; take from 
it a few spoonfuls, and let it cool, mixing with it very perfectly 
one spoonful of flour, which add to the boiling milk, and stir 
it until quite cool. Beat 4 yolks and 2 whites of ^gs, strain

them, and stir them into the milk with 2 oz. of moist sugar, 
2 or 3 spoonfuls of wine, and a little grated nutm^. Bake 
it ^ an hour, or until it is firm and brown. 

MARROW PUDDING.—E. R. 

603. — Four oz. of marrow, 4 oz. of biscuits, 3 oz. of jar rai- 
sins stoned, candied orange-peel, sugar, and nutmeg to the 
taste. Place these articles in layers in a dish surrounded by 
paste ; then beat up 4 eggs, leaving out the whites of 2, in ^ 
pint of cream or good milk, and pour it over the other ingre- 
dients ; it will take H hour to bake. 

Or : — Six oz. of marrow picked clean of fibre, and not too 
finely minced, to which add 4 oz. each of pounded macaroons 
and crumbs of bread, with 1 or 2 oz. of sweet-almond powder ; 
mix these together, seasoning them as above with candied 
citron, sugar, and nutmeg, but omitting the raisins. Then 
beat up the materials in a full pint of rich cream, and the yolks 
of 6 eggs, flavoured with a glass of ratafia. Bake it in a shape, 
but only until it is well browned. 

CURD PUDDING.— E. R. 

604. — Turn 2 quarts of milk, and drain off the curd. Beat 
it in a mortar with 2 oz. of butter, until the butter and curd 
are well united. Then beat the yolks of 6 eggs and the whites 
of 3 ; add them to the curd ; add a little grated bread or biscuit, 
a teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel, some nutmeg, and a few 
pounded peach kernels ; mix them well together ; butter a dish, 
and bake it with a crust round the edges. Currants may be 
added. 

1^01' boiled Curd Pudding, — Rub the curd of 2 quarts of 
milk well drained through a sieve. Mix it with 6 eggs, a little 
cream, 2 spoonfuls of orange-flower water, i a nutm^, flour 
and crumbs of bread each 3 spoonfuls, currants and raisins 
i lb, of each. Boil an hour in a thick well-floured cloth. 

A very delicate species of curd can be made by mixing a 
pint of very sour butter-milk with 2 quarts of new milk. In 
Ireland it is the constant mode of making " two-milk-whey. 

TRANSPARENT PUDDING. 

605. — ^Beat 8 eggs very well; put them into a stewpan, 
with i lb. of sugar pounded fine, the same quantity of butter, 



Chap. XXllI.] SWEET PUDDINGS. 463^ 

and some nutmeg grated. Set it on the fire, and keep stirring 
it till it thickens. Then set it in a basin to cool : put a rich 
puff-paste round the edge of the dish ; pour in the pudding, 
and bake it in a moderate oven. It will cut light and clear. 
You may add candied orange and citron, if you like. 

BREAD PUDDING,— E, R, 

606. — Take a pint of bread-crumbs and cover them with 
milk ; add some cinnamon, lemon-peel, and grated nutmeg ; 
put them on a gentle fire until the crumbs are well soaked. 
Take out the cinnamon and lemon-peel, beat the crumbs and 
milk well together, add 4 eggs well beaten, 1 oz. of butter, 
2 oz. of sugar, i lb. of currants, and boil it an hour. 

An excellent Bread Pudding. — Pour a pint of boiling milk 
over the crumb of 4 French rolls ; when nearly cold add 6 
eggs, i lb. of currants, and 1 oz. of candied citron cut into 
dice ; mix well together ; pour it into a plain round mould, 
round the edges of which place a band of buttered paper ; 
place it in a stewpan with about 2 inches of boiling water at 
the bottom ; cover a sheet of paper over the pudding, and let it 
sinuner gently over the fire, keeping the stewpan covered down 
close until the pudding becomes quite firm ; take off the paper, 
and turn it upon a dish ; pour over it the following sauce : — 
Put i a pint of melted butter into a stewpan ; stir into it the 
yolks of 2 eggs, a glass of brandy, the juice of a lemon with 
sugar sufficient to sweeten it ; stir it over the fire till it begins 
to thicken ; then strain it, and serve. 

Or : — Take either stale or fresh bread, of a light sort ; put 
it into a pan, boil the milk, and when it boils pour it over the 
bread; then allow it to cool, and in the mean time beat up 3 
or 4 eggs with a tablespoonful of fine wheaten flour ; beat the 
egg and flour into the bread and milk until the whole is as 
light as possible. See that the water boils when you put in the 
pudding, and keep it boiling for H hour. 

Baked Bread Pudding, — Prepare the milk and bread as 
before ; then stir in i lb. of butter and the same quantity of 
sugar, with a tablespoonful of cinnamon-powder and grated 
nutmeg ; stir the whole well together, and let it cool ; beat 6 
eggs and stir them gradually into the mixture after it is cold. 
Bake it in a deep dish for 1 hour. 

A little chopped marrow mingled with it will be found 2JK^ 
improvement. 



454 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap.XXDI. 

Brown Bread Pudding may be made with i lb. of stale 
brown bread coarsely grated, ^ lb. of Valencia raisins cot in 
halves, the same of chopped suet ; sugar and nutmeg. Mix 
with 4 eggs, 2 spoonAils of brandy, and 2 of cream ; boil it for 
3 or 4 hours in a cloth or basin that exactly holds it Serve 
with sweet-sauce. 

Prunes, or French plums, instead of raisins, make a fine 
puddingy either with suet or bread. 

BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING, 

607. — Make a custard of 1 e^ and i a pint of milk, by 
boilir^ the milk with a little lemon-peel and sugar, and beat- 
ing up the egg in it, putting it on the fire to thicken ; butter 
slices of bread or French roll, and soak them for an hour or 
two in this mixture ; then lay them in a dish, sprinkling cur- 
rants between each layer, with a little pounded sugar ; and, 
if meant to be very nice, put some sweetmeats on the tag ; 
but both the fruit and the sweetmeats may be omitted if thou^t 
proper. Pour over it another i pint of milk beaten up with 
2 eggs. 

BISCUIT PUDDING. 

608. — Slice 4 common biscuits thin, boil them in 3 gills of 
new milk, with a piece of lemon-peel chopped as fine as pos- 
sible. Break it to a mash ; to which put 3 oz. of warmed 
butter, 2 oz. of sugar, and 4 eggs well beaten ; add a large 
spoonful of brandy. Bake or boil. 

Another. — On 3 grated stale Naples biscuits pour a pint of 
boiling cream ; when cold, add a teaspoonful of cinnamon in 
finest powder, the yolks of 4 and whites of 2 eggs, a spoonful 
of orange-flower water or ratafia, 2 oz. of loaf-sugar, and i a 
spoonful of flour, or almond flour, rubbed smooth. 

PUDDINGS OF ITALIAN PASTE. 

609. — Baked Vermicelli. — Simmer 4 oz. of vermicelli in a 
pint of new milk 10 minutes ; then put to it i a pint of cream, 
a teaspoonful of pounded cinnamon, 4 oz. of butter warmed, 
the same of white sugar, and the yolks of 4 eggs, well beaten ; 
a little oil of almonds or a couple of spoonfuls of ratafia will 
much improve the flavour. Bake in a dish without a lining ; 
but observe that, oi the 2 sot\& oi Neraivi^^^xJBfcCac^noese will 
i>equire f and the KeaTpoVitasx ouVj \ ^xv W\a ^S^NssiKSB.^. 



Chap. XXIH.] SWEET PUDDINGS. 455 

Boiled Vermicelli, — Stir very gently 4 oz. of vermicelli into 
a pint of new milk over the stove, imtil it be scalding hot, but 
not more ; then pour it into a basin, and add to it while hot 
1 oz. of butter and 2 of sugar. When the above is nearly 
cold, mix in it, very gently, 2 well-beaten eggs, and imme- 
diately put it into a basin that will exactly hold it. Cover 
carefully with a floured cloth ; and turning the basin the nar- 
row end upwards, move it round for 10 minutes, and boil an 
hour. Serve with pudding-sauce. 

Macaroni, — Simmer 1 or 2 oz. of the pipe sort in a pint of 
milk, and a bit of lemon and cinnamon, till tender ; put it into 
a dish, with milk, 2 or 3 yolks of ^gs, but only 1 white, 
sugar, nutmeg, 1 spoonful of peach-water, and i a glass of 
raisin wine. Bake with a paste round the edges. 

A layer of orange marmalade or raspberry jam in a maca- 
roni pudding, for change, is a great improvement ; in which 
case omit the almond-water or ratafia, wMch you would other- 
wise flavour it with. 

Semolina is a similar paste to that of the two former ; but, 
being made of a smaller form, it mixes better into a pudding, 
and may be either baked or boiled. In case of not having 
either ratafia or almond at hand, a glass of French brandy should 
be added. 

ARROWROOT P UDDING. 

610. — Simmer a pint of milk with a few whole allspice, 
coriander-seed, and half a stick of cinnamon, for 10 or 15 
minutes ; then sweeten it with sugar, and strain it through 
a hair sieve into a basin to li oz. of arrowroot (about li table- 
spoonful), previously mixed with a little cold water, stirring 
it all the time. When cold, or as soon as the scalding heat is 
gone, add 3 large or 4 small eggs, well beaten, and stir until 
the whole is perfectly blended. It may then be boiled in a 
well-buttered mould or basin, or baked in a dish, with a puff- 
paste crust round the edge, and grated nutmeg on the top. 
From \ to f of an hour will be sufficient to boil or bake it. 
When boiled, serve it with wine-sauce. The flavour of the 
pudding may be occasionally varied, by using a few sweet 
and bitter almonds blanched and finely-pounded or chopped — 
about 1 oz. of sweet and i oz. of bitter — or with brandy o^ 
rum, orange-flower water or vanilla. 

Or :—Mix a dessertspoonful of the powdeT m 1 kH ^^\vs^s^\ 



456 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXm. 

pour upon it a pint of boiling milk, in which have been dis- 
golved 4 oz. of butter and 2 of sugar, stirring all the time. Add 
a little nutme}2^ and 5 eggs. Bake i an hour in a dish lined 
with paste. Turn it out.

If to look clear, substitute water for milk. 

Polenta Pudding. — Mix i lb. of polenta (or maize flour) 
with 1^ pint of milk ; let it boil till it thickens ; put into it 
1 oz. of butter, a little salt, and cayenne pepper ; bake it 
gently for H hour. Turn it out of the dish when served. This 
pudding is very good with meat. 

Sweet Polenta Pudding, — Mix the polenta as in the fore- 
going receipt : when it boils, add 1 oz. of butter, i lb. of 
moist sugar, the same of sultana raisins, the grated rind of a 
lemon, and 1 oz. of candied orange-peel sliced very finely; 
mix the whole well together, and bake it \i hour. The great 
recommendation of this pudding is the absence of eggs, which 
are not required with polenta. A cheap pudding may be made 
by adding 2 tablespoonfuls of treacle to the polenta instead of 
the raisins, sugar, and candied peel. 

Sa>go Pudding, — ^Boil \i pint of new milk, with 4 spoon- 
fuls of sago nicely washed and picked, to which add lemon- 
peel, cinnamon, and nutmeg ; sweeten to taste ; then mix 
4 eggs, put a paste round the dish, and bake slowly. 

Millet may be used in the same way. 

MUFFIN AND CRUMPET PUDDING, 

611. — A very delicate pudding may be made in a short time 
firom a couple of muffins and 3 crumpets, placed alternately in 
layers, and either boiled or baked in batter. If boiled, they 
should be placed in an earthen jar, buttered on the inside, filled 
with the batter, and covered on the top. The muffins should 
be split open, and currant-jelly, slices of apple, or any sort of 
firuit may be inserted. 

Or: — Half a dozen crumpets may be boiled without any 
firuit, afler being dipped and covered in batter ; seasoned only 
with sugar and a little nutmeg.

and the whites of 4 eggs well beaten ; strain and pour it 
into a plain mould buttered and papered ; steam it for ^ an . 
hour ; let it settle for 10 minutes, and serve with the fol-

it is reduced one half; strain it, sweeten with loaf-sugar, and. 
thicken with arrowroot.

boil it an hour. Turn out the pudding carefully, and pour 
some cold custard over it. 

Or : — ^Bake it ; and serve with wine-sauce instead of custard. 

COCOA-NUT PUDDING. 

614. — ^Break the shell of a middle-sized cocoa-nut so as to 
leave the nut as whole as you can ; grate it with a grater after 
having taken off the brown skin ; mix with it 3 oz. of white 
sugar powdered, and about i of the peel of a lemon ; mix well 
together with the milk, and put it into a tin lined with paste, 
and bake it not too brown.

616. — Baked Rice Pudding for a family, — Put into a very 
deep pan \ lb. of rice washed and picked, 2 oz. of butter, 4oz. 
of sugar, and 2 quarts of milk, with a little cinnamon powder. 
Eggs are not necessary, but a little veal suet or marrow, 
chopped, small, is a great improvement. Bake in a slow 
oven. 

A rich Rice Pudding, — Boil -J- lb. of rice in water with 
a little bit of salt, till quite tender ; drain it dry ; mix it 
with the yolks and whites of 4 ^gs, i pint of cream with 
2 oz. of fresh butter melted in it, 4 oz. of marrow, or veal 
kidney suet, finely chopped, lib. of currants, 2 spoonfuls 
of brandy or ratafia, nutmeg, and grated lemon-peel. When

ratafia, sugar, and some grated fresh lemon ; mix well, and 
bake in a mould 1-J- hour. Turn it on a hot dish, and stick it 
thick with almonds slit in 6. Serve with a rich custard round. 
It is equally good cold.

shelled bitter almonds or peach kernels ; sciald and peel them ; 
then pound them in a mortar to a fine smooth paste, free from 
the smallest lumps. It is best to prepare them the day before 
you make your pudding. Stir to a cream ^ lb. of fresh butter 
and i lb. of powdered white sugar ; and by degrees pour into 
it a glass each of mixed wine and brandy. Beat to a stiff 
froth the whites only of 12 eggs (you can preserve the yolks

619. — Take 6 fresh eggs ; let them be well beaten for 2 or 

3 minutes in a basin ; then add 2 tablespoonfuls of powdered 
sugar, a small pinch of salt, and 1 pint of milk. Flavour tfab 
mixture with 6 drops of essence of kernels ; butter a mould 
which will hold the pudding ; put it into a stewpan with water 
sufficient to come half way up the mould ; place it by the 
side of the fire for about i an hour. It must not boil^ but 
keep as near that heat as possible. As soon as the mixture 
has set, the pudding is done. When about to serve it, break 
2 fresh eggs into a stewpan that will hold a pint, 2 teaspoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar, 2 drops of the essence of kernels; 
place it over a very slow fire for J of a minute, merely to 
warm the stewpan. Whisk it with an iron whisk for 2 minutes, 
which will produce a very strong froth, and pour it over the 
pudding. 

Be very careful not to let the pudding boil, and not to 
make the eggs too warm before beating them for the sauce. 

Q (TAKING P UDDING. 

620. — Scald a quart of cream ; when almost cold put to it 

4 eggs well beaten, H spoonful of fiour, some nutm^ and 
sugar ; tie it close in a buttered cloth, boil it an hour, and 
turn it out with care, lest it should crack. Serve with wine 
sauce. 

BRAND Y P UDDING. 

621. — Line a mould with jar-raisins stoned, or dried cher- 
ries, then with thin slices of French roll, next to which put 
ratafias, or macaroons ; then again fruit, rolls, and cakes in 
succession until the mould be full, sprinkling in, at times, 2 
wineglasstiils of brandy. Beat up 4 eggs, yolks and whites ; 



Chap. XXIH.] SWEET PUDDINGS. 463 

put to a pint of milk or cream, lightly sweetened, i a nutmeg 
and the rind of i a lemon finely grated. Let the liquid sink 
into the solid part ; then flour a cloth, tie it tight over, and 
boil 1 hour. Keep the mould the right side up. Serve with 
pudding-sauce. 

THE BAKEWELf, PUDDING, 

622. — Beat the yolks of 4 eggs and the whites of 2 with i 
lb. of powdered loaf-sugar and i lb. of clarified butter ; when 
well mixed, place it over the fire, and keep it constantly stirred 
till it thickens. Line a dish with puff-paste, and put in a layer 
of candied peel about an inch thick ; then pour the mixture 
over it and bake it in a slow oven. 

On this, however, it has been remarked by an intelligent 
cook, that ^' it will be found too sweet for most palates. I 
have frequently had occasion to make this pudding for both 
large and small parties, and have found that the addition of 
i a pint of milk, or milk and cream, to the eggs and sugar, 
with a little ratafia, or noyeau and brandy, to flavour it, has 
been considered a great improvement. I add the milk to the 
eggs and sugar when it is near boiling, without placing the 
mixture on the fire at all. Instead of using all candied peel, 
I prefer adding a portion of preserved fruits, such as dried 
cherries, greengages, and melon or pine-apple cut small ; and, 
when baked, occasionally spread over the top or ornament 
it with some apricot or raspberry jam, or some of each, to vary 
the colour. When made in this way, it has been universally 
admired," 

A BLACK'CAP PUDDING,— E. R, 

623. — Rub 3 tablespoonfuls of flour, smooth, by degrees into 

a pint of milk, strain it, and simmer it over the fire imtil it 

thickens ; stir in 2 oz. of butter ; when cool add the yolks of 

4 eggs beaten and strained, and \ lb. of currants washed and 

picked, laid at the bottom of the basin or mould previously 

well buttered. Put the batter into the mould, cover it tight, 

and plunge it into boiling water ; the currants downwards, 

that they may stick to the bottom and thus form the black 

cap. 

A S WEE TMEA T P UDDING, 

624. —Cover a dish with thin puff-paste, and lay in it freshly 
candied orange, lemon, and citron, 1 oz. each, sliced thin. 



464 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEBY. [Chap. XXm 

Beat the yolks of 8 and the whites of 2 eggs, and mix wHk 8 
oz. of butter wanned, but not oiled, and 8 oz. of wldte sugar. 
Pour the mixture over the sweetmeats, and bake 1 hour in t 
moderate oven. 

BOLY-POLY PUDDING. 

• 625. — Make a rich pudding-paste with flour and batter, 
without suet, but as light as possible. Boll it oat thin, and 
cut it to the breadth of 8 or 10 inches, making it at the same 
time as long as you please ; but ^ lb. of flour and 5 oc of 
butter, wetted with water, will probably be sufficient when 
rolled out quite smooth ; then spread upon it a thick layer of 
raspberry, currant, or any other sort of jam, but leave about 
an inch of all the edges bare. That done, roll it round ; the 
roll of paste will secure the fruit, and the aods must be t^Hsted 
together for the same purpose. Wrap it in a nicely floured 
cloth, and boil it for 2 to 3 hours according to size. 

Take it up quite hot, and when served cut it crosswise. It 
may appear homely, but it is an excellent and mach-admired 
pudding. 

CABINET PUDDING.— E, R. 

626. — Take 10 penny sponge-cakes or biscuits, 6 oz. of dried 
cherries or sultana raisins, yolks of 6 eggs with the whites of 
4 ; beat up the eggs with a little nutmeg and sugar and a 
pint of milk ; butter the mould very completely, and lay the 
cherries or raisins in a pattern round the bottom and sides ; 
break each cake into 4 pieces, and lay them close to the fruit 
to keep it from ^ling ; then fill up the mould with the cus- 
tard. Lay a piece of paper over the top, put it into a stew- 
pan with 2 inches depth of boiling water, and be careful that 
the lid of the stewpan fits quite close to keep in the steam : 
1 of an hour will boil it. 

THE C0N8EBVATIVE PUDDING, 

627. — i lb. of ratafia and macaroon cakes mixed, 4 sponge 
biscuits, the yolks of 8 eggs, i pint of cream, and a glass of 
brandy, well beaten together, the cakes being soaked in the 
cream and brandy. Butter a quart mould, place dried cherries 
or stoned raisins in a pattern over it, pour in the mixture, and 
place the mould in a stewpan surrounded by water, and let it 
simmer H hour over charcoal.

THE REFORM PUDDING. 

628. — ^Take 3 egff^ weig^ them in the shdl ; take an equal 
weight of sugar and of batter, and \ of the weight of floor. 
Half melt the batter and beat it to a cream ; beat the ^^ 
also, and mix them with the butter and sugar, beating the 
whole to a firoth ; then add the flour, and the rind of a lemon 
grated ; beat all together, and pour it into a mould : an hour 
will boil it. This pudding may also be baked, substituting 
cream for the butter, which would render it more delicate 
than batter subjected to the dry heat of an oven. 

THE PROTECTIONIST PUDDING. 

629« — Break 7 eggs into a deep pan, leavii^ out 3 of the 
whites. Put 10 oz. of loaf-sugar in a jnnt of water ; set it 
over the Are until the scum rises ; pour it over the ^gs ; add 
a teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel and the juice of a lemmi. 
Whisk them for 20 minutes ; shake in i lb. of flour ; pour it 
into a tin, and put it into the oven immediately. 

WINDSOR PALACE PUDDINGS. 

630. — ^Boil 1 oz. of rice in milk until it will beat into a

^e rice, 1 oz. of finely -sifted sugar, a salt spoonful of grated 
lemon-peel, and a little lemon-juice, or a few drops of essence 
of lemon ; then beat the whites of 4 ^gs until they make a 
strong froth ; add the other ingredients, whisking them well 
tc^ther, so as to be very light. Dip a basin or mould into 
boiling water ; pour in this sou£9^ while the mould is quite 
hot, and put the mould into a pan of boiling water, boiling 
until the white of the eggs is set and firm. Have a custard 
made with the yolks of the eggs, and pour it round the pud- 
ding in a dbh. Snow-balls may be made the same way, with 
pounded almonds substituted for apples. The elegance and 
lightness of this pudding are great recommendations. 

Her Majesty* s Pudding. — Butter a mould, and cover it in 
a pattern with sweetmeats of various colours, and fruit ; cut 
3 sponge-cakes in slices, and soak them in white wine ; place 
them round the mould ; make a fine custard with 4 ^;gs, a 
pint of cream, and 2 oz. of pounded almonds ; pour it in, and 
boil it for an hour.

pressed through a colander ; melt in i pint of warm milk i lb. 
of butter and the same quantity of sugar, stirring them well 
together : 1 pint of rich cream will be better than milk and 
butter. Beat 8 eggs very light, and add them gradually to 
the other ingredients alternately with the pumpkin ; then stir 
in a wineglass of rose-water and 2 glasses of wine mixed to- 
gether, a large teaspoonful of powdered mace and cinnamon

of butter. Lme a dish with puff-paste, pour in the mixture, 
and bake lighdy. 

For sauce : — ^Melted butt^, sugar, a little levnon-juice, and 
1 sfKMHifiil of biandy. 

LEMON PUDDING, 

644. — ^Mdt 6 oz. of butter, and pour it over the same quan- 
tity of powdered loaf-sugar, stirring it wdl till cold. Then 
grate the rind of a large lemon, aj^l add it with 8 ^gs well 
beaten, and the juice of 2 lemons ; stir the whole till it is com- 
pletely mixed together, and bake the pudding with a paste 
round the dish.

AN APPLE CHARLO TTE.-^E. JR. 

645. — Pare and slice a quantity of apples ; cut off the crust 
of a loaf, and cut slices of bread and butter. Butter the inside 
of a pie-dish, and place bread and butter all round ; then put 
in a layer of apples sprinkled with lemon-peel chopped very 
fine, and a considerable quantity of good brown sugar. Then 
put on a layer of bread and butter, and another of apples, 
lemon-peel, and sugar, until the dish is full, squeezing over 
the juice of lemons, so that every part shall be equally 
flavoured. Cover up the dish with the crusts of the bread and 
the peels of the apples, to prevent it from browning or burn- 
ing: bake it li hour ; then take off the peels and the crust, 
and turn it out of the dish. 

The above is the most usual mode of making it, but the an- 
nexed receipt is an improvement, furnished by a cook of high 
reputation. 

Charlotte de Pommes, — Take i a quartern loaf, cut the 
crumb in slices i inch thick, cut out of it as many pieces with 
an inch-round cutter as are required. Oil some butter^ dii^ 



472 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXm. 

the round pieces of bread into it, and then place them in a 
plain mould in any way you please. Make a little cmst with 
a piece of butter the size of a walnut, worked up stiff with 
flour and water ; roll it out exceedingly thin, and then lay it 
inside the bread (this is merely to keep the apple fincmi Inust- 
ing the bread). Boil sufficient apples to fill the mould, with 
a bit of cinnamon and green lemon-peel, add sugar to taste, 
a little nutmeg, and a small piece of fresh butter ; when the 
apple is rather stiff fill the mould, cover with a piece of 
bread ; bake for 1 hour. 

If the bread is cut in long thin strips, and these made to lap 
one over the other, the lining of paste may be dispensed with. 

APPLES A LA CREMONE 

646. — Form also a beautiful dish. Choose such apples as 
will look clear when dressed ; pare and cut into pieces the 
form of a brick a sufficient quantity to weigh 1^ lb. ; strew 
over them 1^ lb. of good Lisbon sugar and several long strips 
of lemon-peel, and cover them close in a bowL Next day 
put the apples, piece by piece, into a small preserving-pan, 
with the sugar, &c., and 2 large spoonfuls of strong cider. 
Simmer gently ; and as the pieces of apple become clear, 
take them out. When cold, build a wall with them on a 
small oval dish, and place the lemon-peel on the top ; pour 
the syrup into the middle. Serve cream to eat with it. 

The peel of China orange, cut very thin, does as well as 
lemon ; but the rind of Seville orange always gives a higher 
flavour. 

Apples a la Suedoise, — Let the apples be pared and cored, 
but not cut apart, and simmer gently in a thin syrup of 
sugar and water till tender ; drain them, and fill the middles 
with any rich preserve : place them on a dish in layers raised 
the shape of a hedgc'-hog. Have ready a compote of apples 
made by boiling 3 or 4 lbs., as for marmalade, sweetened and 
flavoured with lemon, pour this over the apples so as to fill up 
the space between each ; and to cover them spread over an 
icing made by the whites of 3 eggs beaten to a froth, with 2 
large tablespoonfuls of pounded sugar ; make the surfiice quite 
even, then sift over it some fine sugar. Blanch and slice 
lengthwise sufficient almonds to thickly stick over the whole ; 
when done, put the dish into the oven, letting the apples be 
warmed through and the almond slightly browned. The num- 



Chap. XXlnj SWEET PUDDINGS. 473 

ber required must depend upon the size of the dish, but there 
should be sufficient to give the necessary shape. They may 
be stirred 2 or 3 sets in the same syrup, wMch should have 
1 lb. of sugar to 1 pint of water. 

Apples a la Dauphine likewise £»rm a very nice comer 
dish as thus : — Pare some of the large sort, make a hole at the 
end and scoop out the greater part of the pulp ; have a rich 
custard, with which fill up the hollow ; cover the apples with 
thin paste, ornamenting the tops with strips of it^ and bake 
than in pans. 

A CHARTREUSE OF APPLES AND RICE. 

647. — ^Boil 6 oz. of rice with a stick of cinnamon in milk 
until it is thick, stirring in a spoonful of rose-water or orange- 
flower water. Pare 10 or 12 apples — golden pppins are the 
best — scoop out the core, and fill up Qie orifice with rasp- 
berry-jam. Border a deep dish with paste ; put in the apples, 
leaving a space between, and fill it up with the rice. Brush 
the whole over with the yolk of an e^j and sift sugar thickly 
over it ; form a pattern on the top with sweetmeats, and bake 
it for 1 hour in a quick oven. 

MIROTON OF APPLES, 

648. — Scald the apples, reduce them to a pulp, and pile 
them high upon the dish in which they are to be served ; boil 
1 teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel and 6 or 8 lumps of sugar 
in a teacupful of water ; then add the yolks of 3 e^^ and 
the white of 1, ^ oz. of butter, 1 spoonful of flour, and 1 of 
brandy ; mix the whole together over the fire, and stir it quite 
smooth. Pour it upon the apples, then whisk the whites of 
the other 2 eggs to a froth ; put lliem over the miroton just 
as it is going into the oven, and sift some sugar over it. The 
oven must be slow : it will take 10 or 15 minutes to bake. 

P0MME8 AU REURRE, OR RUTTERED APPLES. 

649. — Peel the apples and remove the core without cutting 
them through, taking care not to break them. Cut slices di 
bread the circumference of the apples, butter a dish, put on 
the bread, and place an apple on each slice. Fill the hole 
made by the removal of the core with white sugar, place a 
piece of butter the size of a walnut on each hole ; put them 



474 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chaf. XXDI. 

into a gentle oven, and renew the sogar and batter aeveal 
times. They will take 20 or 30 minotes. Be very ctfefol 
not to let the bread bom, or the apples loee their abipe. 

GATEAU DE POMMES. 

650. — Boil sufficient apples (flayonred wifii dnnamoii, 
cloves, and green lemon-peel) to nearly fill a l^-pint podding- 
mould. Pass them through a sieve, add sugar to taste, and 
2 tablespoonfuls heaped of potato-flour ; stir it oyer tiie fiie, 
and, when rather stiff, add 5 or 6 eggs ; boil in a mould for 1 
hour. Serve with a cream-sauce thickened with potato-floor 
and flavoured with noyeau. 

POMME MANGE. 

651. — ^Feel and core 1 lb. of apples, and put them witb h lb. 
of sugar and i pint of water into a stewpan ; add the peel of 
a lemon. Allow it to boil until it becomes quite st^ and 
then put it into a mould. It will be found excellent 

FR UIT P UDDING^. 

662. — Cranberry Pudding. — Boil li pint of cranberries, 

cleared of the stalks, in 4 oz. of sugar and water, until they 
are broken and form a kind of jam. Make up a larg^ ball 
of it ; cover it well with rice washed clean and dry ; then 
round each fold a floured piece of cloth, which tie as for 
dumplings. Boil them 1 hour ; sift sugar over when served, 
and butter in a boat. 

Rhubarb Pttdding, — Cut small sufficient stalks of rhubarb to 
weigh about 1 lb. or li lb., which put into a clean saucepan with 
8 or 10 oz. of sugar, the rind of 1 lemon grated, the juice, and 
i a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon. Place the whole on the 
fire and stir it occasionally at first, but constantly at last, until 
reduced to a sort of marmalade ; take it from the fire, and, if 
appearance is to be regarded, pass it through a hair sieve into 
a basin ; mix vAXh it about an ounce or two of good sweet 
butter, or a little good cream. Line rather a flat dish with 
puff-paste, thin at the bottom but thick on the edge. When 
the preparation is cold fill the dish as &r as the edge, and bake 
it in a moderate ov^ until the paste is done. 

Quince Pudding. — Scald some quinces till they are very 
tender ; pare them, and scrape off all the pulp. Strew over 



Chap. XXHI.] FRUIT PUDDINGS. 475 

them ginger, cinnamon, and as much sugar as will make them 
very sweet. To 1 pint of cream put the yolks of 3 or 4 ^gs, 
and stir into as much of the pulp as will make it of a pro- 
per thickness. Line a dish, and bake. White pears, plums, 
apricots, or other fruit, may be done in the same way. 

An excellent Apricot Pudding, — ^Have 12 large apricotB, 
give them a scald till they are soft ; meantime pour on the 
gjaJbed crumbs of a penny loaf 1 pint of boiling cream ; when 
half cold, add 4 oz. of sugar, the yolks oi 4 beaten eggs, and 1 
g^ass of white wine. 3reak the apricc^stones, take s(»ne or 
all of the kernels, pound them in a mortar, and mix them with 
the fruit and other ingredients ; put a paste round a dish, and 
bake the pudding i an hour. 

Baked Apple Pudding, --^Veixe and quarter 4 large apples ; 
boH them trader with the rind of a lemon, in so little water 
that, when done, ncoie may remain ; beat them quite firm in a 
mortar; add the carumb of a small roll, 4 oz. of butter 
melted, the yolks of 6 and whites of 3 eggs, juice of ^ a lemoa, 
and sugar to taste ; beat all together, and lay it in a dish with 
paste to turn out. 

Or : — Put the pulp of the apples in the centre of a baking- 
dish, surround it with custard, and bake it until brown. 

Or: — Take -f lb. of the pulp of the sharpest apples you 
can get ; add 6 oz. of pounded loaf-sugar, the same of butter 
(melted), the grated rind of 1 lemon and the juice, a glass of 
white wine, a little nutmeg, the yolks of 8 eggs and the 
whites of 4, well beaten. Mix these well together, and bake 
in a dish lined with paste. 

Fruit sliced into Batter makes an excellent and economical 
pudding, and is considered much more digestible than when 
put into paste. A little of the batter should be put into the 
dish, and if apples are used they should be pared and carefully 
cored, then cut into slices, and a little sugar and grated lemon- 
peel strewed between them, the dish fiU^ three parts full with 
the remainder of the batter. 

To make Batter far Fruit Puddings, — ^Put i lb. of flour 
and a saltspoonful of salt into a pan, add very gently i pint of 
milk ; if mixed carelessly the flour will remain in lumps ; beat 
up the whites of 4 eggs, strain them to the batter, and beat it 
well with a wooden spoon. The whites should be beaten sepa- 
rately to a solid froth, and not added till just before the batter 



476 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXm. 

is used. For fruit the batter should be rather thicks than 
when plain, to prevent the fruit sinking to the bottom of the 
dish or basin, as it is equally good baked or boiled. It must 
be brought to a proper consistency by adding milk. 

Baked Gooseberry Pudding. — Stew gooseberries in a jar 
over a hot hearth, or in a saucepan of water, till they wiD pidp. 
Take a pint of the juice pressed through a coarse sieve, and 
beat it with 3 yolks and whites of eggs beaten and strained, 
with \\ oz. of butter ; sweeten it well, and put a crust roiuid 
the dish. A few crumbs of roll, or 4 oz. of Naples biscuit, 
should be mixed with the above to give a little consistence. 

Raspberries and currants may be used instead of goose- 
berries, and are equaUy good. 

Damsons, — Take a few spoonfuls from a quart of milk, and 
mix into it by degrees 4 spoonfuls of flour, 2 spoonfuls of sifted 
ginger, a little salt ; then add the remainder of the milk and 
1 lb. of damsons. Tie it up in a cloth, wetted and well floured, 
or put it in a basin that will exactly hold it« Boil it 1^ hour, 
and pour over it melted butter and sugar. 

TO PREPARE FRUIT FOR CHILDREN. 

653. — Afar more wholesome way than in Pies or Puddings 
— is to put apples sliced, or plums, currants, gooseberries, &c., 
into a stone jar ; and sprinkle among them as much Lisbon 
sugar as necessary. Set the jar in an oven or on a hearth, with 
a teacupful of water to prevent the fruit from burning ; or 
put the jar into a saucepan of water till its contents be per« 
fectly done. Slices of bread or some rice may be put into the 
jar, to eat with the fruit. 

CARROT PUDDING, 

654.— Boil a large carrot till tender, bruise and mix it 
with a spoonful of bread-crumbs, 4 yolks and 2 whites of 
eggs, a pint of cream, a ratafia, a large spoonful of orange- 
flower water, i a nutmeg, 2 oz. of loaf-sugar. Make in a shal- 
low dish lined with paste, and when it is turned out strew 
sugar over it. 

Or : — 4 oz. of bread-crumbs, 4 oz. of suet, 4 oz. of grated 
raw carrot, 1 tablespoonful of brandy, beaten up with an egg, 
and flavoured with cinnamon and nutmeg. Boil 3 hours. 

An excellent plain Potato Pudding, — Take 8 oz. of boiled 



Chap. XXIH.] PROVINCIAL PUDDINGS. 477 

potatoes, 2 oz. of butter, the yolks and whites of 2 eggs, i 
pint of cream, 1 spoonful of white wine, a morsel of salt, the 
juice and rind of a lemon ; beat all to froth ; sugar to taste. 
A crust or not, as you like. Bake it. If wanted richer y put 
3 oz. more butter, sweetmeats and almoods, and another egg ; 
or i£ plainer J omit the wipe. 

An economical Pudding may be made of *} lb. of flour, ^Ib. 
of currants, ^Ib. of suet well chopped, and 4 oz. of treacle, 
with milk sufficient to mix it well together into a stiff paste or 
batter, the stiffiiess of boiled rice. Butter a basin, and let it 
boil 5 hours. When cold it may be sliced and browned. 

SASTY PUDDING. 

655, — Boil I pint of milk, stir 2 oz. of flour in it till it be 
thick and stiff; put it into a basin and add i oz, of butter with 
a little nutmeg, and sugar enough to sweeten it. When cold 
mix in 3 well-beaten eggs ; line a dush with thin paste, and in 
the bottom of it put a layer of marmalade, or any other pre- 
serve, and bake the pudding in a moderate oven for i an 
hour. It is good without paste, and may be baked in a 
Dutch oven. 

Or : — ^Boil 1 pint of milk, stir into it as ipuch flour as will 
thicken it, letting it boil all the time ; pour it into plat^, and 
eat it hot, with cold butter and sugar, or, if butter is objected 
to, a little cold milk and a little nutmeg. 

PROVINCIAL PUDDINGS. 

666. — Wiltshire Pitdding. — Three well*beaten eggs, 1 pint 
of milk, sufficient flour to make a thick batter, a little salt ; 
beat it some minutes, stir in gently a large teacupful of picked 
currants and half that quantity of red raspberries ; boil in a 
cloth for 2 hours, turn it out on the dish, and cut in thin slices, 
but do not separate them ; put between each butter and brown 
sugar. 

Bath Pudding. — ^Half a pint of cream, i lb. of butter, 
boiled together, the crumbs of a twopenny loaf, lump sugar 
and brandy to your taste, 4 eggs. Bake them in small cups 
f of an hour. 

Chichester Pudding.-^To tJie grated crumbs of a French 
roll, mixed with the grated rind of i a lemon, add 4 oz. of 
sifted sugar, the same of butter, the juice of ^ a lemon^ the 



478 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXTH. 

yolks of 4 eggs, the whites of 2, both being pieyioiislj wdl 
beaten ; stir it over the fire till it is the thickness of cream ; 
then pour it into an open tart-paste and bake it in a modeiate 
oven. 

Yorkshire Pudding. — Put 1 pint of boiling noiilk to the 
crumb of a penny loaf, 4 eggs, a little salt and floor ; put it 
in a tin and bake it under roast beef or mutton. 

A Welsh Pudding. — Let i lb. of fine butter melt geiidy, 
beat with it the yolks of 8 and whites of 4 ^gs, mix in 6 ess. 
of loaf-sugar, and the rind of a lemon grated. Put a paste 
into a dish for turning out, and pour the above in, and nicely 
bake it. 

Gloucester Puddings, — ^Weigh 3 eggs in the shell ; take 
their weight in flour and butter; take 12 bitter alinonds 
and 6 oz. of poimded sugar ; beat all together for ^ an hour, 
and put the mixture in pudding-cups, filling the caps only half 
full. Bake them ^ an hour. 

DUMPLINOa. 

657. — Oxford Dumplings. — Of grated bread 2 oz., cur- 
rants and shred suet 4 oz. each, 2 large spoonfuls of flour, a 
great deal of grated lemon-peel, a bit of sugar, and a little 
pimento in fine powder. Mix with 2 eggs and a little milk 
into 5 dumplings, and fry of a fine yellow brown. Made 
with flour instead of bread, but half the quantity, they are 
excellent. Serve with sweet-sauce. 

Apple Dumplings should be made of 1 large apple quar- 
tered and cored, then put together, covered with a thin paste^ 
and boiled till the fruit shall be done enough. 

Or : — The apple is best not cut, but the core scooped out, 
and the centre filled up with a piece of butter and sugar, ac- 
cording to the tartness of the apple. The paste should not be 
rolled out, but a lump of the proper quantity taken, the apple 
placed upon it, and the paste carefully pressed round it: 
bringing it to a point which is easily closed, so as to keep in 
the juice and butter. They have a pretty efiect if boiled in 
nets instead of cloths. 

Yeast or Suffolk Dumplings. — Make a very light dough 
with yeast, as for bread, but with milk instead of water, and 
put salt. Let it rise an hour before the fire. 20 minutes be- 
fore you are to serve, bave leady a large stewpan of boiling 



Chap. XXm.] PROVINCIAL PUDDINGS. 479 

water; make the dough into balls the size of a middling 
apple, throw them in, and boil 20 minutes. If you doubt 
when done enough, stick a clean fork into one, and if it come 
out clear it is done. 

The way to eat them is, to tear them apart on the top with 
2 forks, for they become heavy by their own steam. Eat 
immediately with meat, or sugar and butter, or salt ; or with 
melted butter, sweetened, and add a tablespoonful of lemon- 
juice. 

Norfolk Dumplings, — With a pint of milk, two well-beaten 
^;gs, and a little salt, mix as much flour as will make a thick 
batter. Drop a spoonful at a time into a stewpan of boiling 
water ; a few minutes will do them. Take them up in a sieve 
to drain, and serve quickly with cold butter ; the water must 
not cease boiling while they are doing. 

Dumplings quickly made, — Beat 4 e^^ and strain them ; 
mix 4 oz. of flour very smoothly with a pint of milk ; add to 
it the eggs, strain it again, and flavour the batter with sugar 
and nutmeg ; butter some teacups, fill them three parts fdll, 
and put them into an oven : they will take i of an hour, and, 
if well mixed, will be equal to custard. 

Or : — If boiled for i an hour in a cloth, the ingredients will 
make an excellent batter pudding. 

Another mode, — Shred suet, and mix with grated bread, a 
few currants, the yolks of 4 eggs and the whites of 2, some 
grated lemon-peel and ginger: make this into little balls 
about the size and shape of an e^^^ with a little flour. Have 
ready a skillet of boiling water, and throw them in. 20 minutes 
will boil them; but they will rise to the top when done. 
Serve with pudding-sauce.' 

Currant Dumplings, — Take i lb. each of flour, bread- 
crumbs, suet (chopped fine), and currants : mix all together 
with a pinch of salt, a tablespoonful of moist sugar, a little 
grated lemon-peel and nutmeg, with 4 eggs, and suflicient 
milk to make it a tolerably stiff batter ; wet a cloth and tie 
the mixture in dumplings about the size of a teacup ; boil 
for an hour, and serve with melted butter sweetened with 
moist sugar. 

• If the corrants, lemon-peel, and ginger be omitted, the above is the 
mode of making suet dumplings to be put into soup.

CHAPTER XXIV. 



CUSTARDS, CREAMS, JELLIES, ftc. 



CUSTARDS. 

658.— Custard is always eaten cold, and either poured over 
fruit tarts, or served up separately in custard-cups, in each of 
which a macaroon steeped in wine, and laid at the bottom, 
will be found a good addition. 

The flavouring may likewise be altered, according to taste, 
by using a different kind of essence, the name of which it then 
acquires ; as of lemon, orange, maraschino, vanilla, &c. It 
is almost needless to say that cream or a portion *of it will 
make it richer than mere milk. 

It should be recollected that in custard, when made as 
cream, and eaten as usually called ^' raw," the whites of the 
eggs are never all used ; but they may be devoted to many 
other purposes. 

The French mode of making it is, to measure the number 
of cups which are to be filled, and use nearly that quantity of 
milk or cream, simmering it upon the fire until beginning to 
boil, then adding about i oz. of powdered sugar to each cup, 
with lemon-peel, bay-leaves, or almond-powder ; then take 
the yolk of an e^^ to each small cup, beat them up with the 
milk, fill the cups, place in a bain-marie or vase of boiling 
water until the custard become firm. 

Custard Cream : — Boil i pint of new milk with a piece of 
lemon-peel, 2 peach-leaves, a stick of cinnamon, and 8 lumps 
of white sugar. Should cream be employed instead of milk, 
there will be no occasion to strain it. Beat the yolks, say of 
4 eggs ; strain the milk through coarse muslin, or a hair 
sieve ; then mix the eggs and milk very gradually together^ 
and sinmier it gently on the fire, stirring it until it thickens. 



Chap. XXIV.] CUSTARDS. 481 

but removing it the moment it begins to boil, or it will 
curdle. The addition of a glass of brandy beaten up with it 
materially improves its flavour. 

Or : — Boil a quart of milk with 6 laurel-leaves and 2 oz. 
of loaf-sugar : have ready the yolks of 7 eggs and the whites 
of 3, well beaten ; pour them into a jug, and pour on them 
the boiling milk, having taken out the leaves ; put the jug 
into a pan of boiling water, and keep stirring till of sufficient 
thickness, which will be in a few minutes. 

A cheap and excellent sort is made by boiling 3 pints of 
new milk with a bit of lemon-peel, a bit of cinnamon, 2 or 3 
bay-leaves, and sweetening it. Meanwhile, rub down smooth 
a large spoonful of rice-flour into a cup of cold milk, and mix 
with it 4 yolks of eggs well beaten. Take a basin of the 
boiling milk, mix it with the cold, and pour that to the boil- 
ing, stirring it one way till it begins to thicken, and is just 
going to boil up ; then pour it into a pan, stir it some time, 
add a large spoonful of peach- water, 2 teaspoonfuls of brandy, 
or a little ratafia.* 

Custard Cream of Chocolate is made by grating any 
quantity of spiced chocolate, moistened by degrees with 
warm milk, and put into a stewpan, with yolks of eggs, to 
thicken. 

Or : — Scrape i lb. of the best chocolate ; pour on it a tea- 
cupful of boiling water, and let it stand by the fire till it has 
dissolved. Beat 8 eggs very light, omitting the whites of 2. 
Stir them by degrees into a quart of cream or rich milk, 
alternately with the melted chocolate and 3 tablespoonfuls of 
powdered white sugar. Put the mixture into cups and bake 
it 10 minutes. Send them to table cold, with whipped white 
of egg heaped on the top of each custard. 

Coffee Custard. — Boil a pint of milk, and when boiling 
pour it upon 2 tablespoonfuls of lohole coffee, that you have 
just warmed before the fire. Let it stand for an hour, then 
sweeten it, add 4 yolks of eggs, thicken over the fire, and 
when thick enough strain and fill the glasses. 

Almofid Custard, — Boil in a pint of milk, or cream, 2 or 
3 bitter almonds, a stick of cinnamon, and a piece of lemon- 
peel pared thin, with 8 or 10 lumps of sugar; let it simmer 

* Marbles, boiled in custard, or anything likely to barn, will, if shaken 
in the saucepan, prevent it from catching. 

1 \ 



482 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chaf. XXIV. 

to extract the flavour, then strain it and stir it till cold. Beat 
the yolks of 6 eggs, mix it with the milk, and stir the whole 
over a slow fire until of a proper thickness, adding 1 ok. of 
sweet almonds, beaten fine in rose-water. 

Or : — Blanch and beat 4 oz. of almonds with a spoonfal of 
water ; beat a pint of cream with 2 spoonfuls of roee-water, 
and put them to the yolks of 4 eggs, with as much sugar as 
will make it pretty sweet ; then add the almonds : stir it all 
over a slow fire till it is of a proper thickness, but do not 
boil. Pour it into cups or glasses. 

Or : — Blanch 2 oz. of sweet and 2 oz. of bitter almonds ; 
beat them very fine in a mortar, using 2 spoonfuls of orange- 
flower water or a little milk in the pounding, to prev^it their 
oiling. Whisk up 4 eggs well (8 or 10 yolks may be used 
inst^) with 6 or 8 oz. of powdered loaf-sugar, to which add 
a pint of milk, or part milk and cream, and the pounded 
almonds : put the whole into a saucepan on the fire, and stir 
it constantly from the bottom with a whisk until it bec(»nes 
thick ; but remember it must not boil, or it will curdle and 
be spoiled. Take it from the fire, keep stirring it for a few 
minutes, pour it into a basin, and stir it occasionally with a 
spoon to prevent a skin forming on the top ; then pour it into 
cup<!, and grate nutmeg over the tops. 

Far rich Custard, — Boil a pint of milk with lemon-peel 
and cinnamon ; mix a pint of cream and the yolks of 8 eggs 
well beaten ; when the milk tastes of the seasoning, strain it 
and sweeten it enough for the whole ; pour it into the cream, 
stirring it well ; then give the custard a simmer till of a 
proper thickness. Do not let it boil ; stir the whole time one 
way. 

Or : — ^Boil a pint of cream with some mace, cinnamon, and 
a little lemon-peel: strain it, and when cold add to it the 
yolks of 4 and whites of 2 eggs, a little orange-flower water, 
and sugar to your taste. A little nutmeg and 2 spoonfuls of 
sweet wine may be added, if approved. Mix well, and bake 
in cups. 

A still richer sort is made by using cream without any por- 
tion of milk, or other flavouring than a glass or two of any of 
the highly flavoured liqueurs — either curagao, noyeau, or 
maraschino, beaten up with the yolks only of strictly fresh 
eggs, from which tVie ^^ tieieyd" has been picked out. If the 



Chap. XXIV.] CUSTARDS. 483 



liqueurs cannot be got, then simmer lemon or Seville orange 
peel, cinnamon, with a little nutmeg, brandy, or ratafia, if it 
can be had. 

These custards are veiy delicious, but may be improved by 
the addition of a few drops of noyeau. 

Orange Custard. — Boil very tender the rind of i a Seville 
orange ; beat it in a mortar to a paste ; put to it a spoonful 
of the best brandy, the juice of a Seville orange, 4 oz. of lump- 
sugar, and the yolks of 4 eggs. Beat all together 10 minutes, 
and pour in by degrees a pint of boiling cream. Keep 
beating until the mixture is cold ; then put into custard- 
cups, and set them in a soup-dish of boiling water ; let then! 
stsmd until thick, then put preserved orange-peel, in slices^ 
upon the custard. Serve either hot or cold. 

Or: — Take the juice of 12 oranges, strain it and sweeten 
it well with pounded loaf-sugar, stir it over a slow fire till the 
sugar is dissolved, taking off the scum as it rises : when nearly 
cold add the yolks of 12 eggs well beaten, and a pint of 
cream ; stir it again over the fire till it thickens. Serve it in 
a glass dish or in custard-cups. 

Lemon Custard may be made in the same manner, or as 
follows : — Strain 3 wineglassfuls of lemon-juice through a 
sieve ; beat 9 eggs, yolks and whites, strain them also, and 
add them to the lemon-juice, with \ lb. of powdered loaf-sugar, 
a glass of white wine, and i a wineglass of water, with a little 
grated lemon-peel. Mix all together, and put the ingredients 
into a saucepan on the fire, stirring it until it becomes thick 
and of a proper consistence. 

Or : — Boil the rind of 2 lemons grated and the juice of 1 
in a pint of water ; add the yolks of 14 eggs beaten to a 
cream and sweetened ; stir it one way till it thickens. When 
taken off the fire add 2 spoonfuls of brandy. 



CREAMS. 

In the common acceptation of the word, cream only means 
the skimmings of raw milk, or, when wanned, is called 
" clouted ;" but the term is here applied to dishes in which 
cream is the chief ingredient, and which are usually called by 
the name of the flavouring materials. 



484 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIV. 

CHAMPA ONE CREAM 

659. — Is made by beating up the yolks of 6 eggs with as 
much powdered sugar as will make it quite stiff — so much so 
as nearly to make the spoon stand in it. Thea pour on it veiy 
gradually — stirring it all the time — a bottle of sparkling cham- 
pagne : grate on it a little nutmeg, and serve it to the ladies, 
who seldom refuse a second glass. 

A bottle of good qider or perry will be a tolerable substi- 
tute. 

Zjechi Crhna, — ^Beat up 3 eggs, leaving out 2 of the ^H^te^ 
and add to them gradually 1$ pint of milk; then mix very 
carefully 4 tablespoonfuls of fine wheat-flour and 2 oz. of finely 
powdered loaf-sugar, with grated lemon-peel to give a flavour. 
Boil these ingredients over a slow fire, stirring constantly to 
prevent burning, until the flour is quite dissolved. Prepare 
a shallow dish with some ratafia cakes at the bottom, and 
when the ^^or^ma" is sufficiently boiled, pour it through a 
sieve upon the cakes.* 

A VERY FINE ITALIAN CREAM. 

660. — Whip together for nearly an hour a quart of very 
thick scalded cream, a quart of raw cream, the grated rind of 
4 lemons and the strained juice, with 10 oz. of white powdered 
sugar ; then add i pint of sweet wine, and continue to wlusk 
it until it becomes quite solid. Lay a piece of muslin in a 
sieve, and lade the cream upon it with a spoon. In 20 hours 
turn it carefully out, but mind that it does not break. Garnish 
it with fruit-jelly or with flowers. 

Another, — Whip up i pint of very rich cream to a strong 
froth, with some finely scraped lemon-peel, a squeeze of the 
juice, i a glass of sweet wine, and sugar to make it pleasant, 
but not too sweet ; lay it on a sieve or in a form, and next 
day put it on a dish, and ornament it with very light pufl^-paste 
biscuits, made in tin shapes the length of a finger, and about 
2 thick, over which sugar may be strewed, or a little glazed 
with isinglass. Or you may use macaroons to line the edges 
of the dish. 

*■ Some finely powdered cinnamon should be dusted pretty thickly over it 
This delicious dish is always served up cold. The receipt was obtaioed 
from the nuns of SaUta Clara convent at Palmas, in the island of Grand 
Canary. 



Chap. XXIV.] CREAMS. 485 

CrSmjB a la VAUflLLt:, 

661. — Boil 1 oz. of isinglass in a pint of milk for 10 
minutes, taking care it does not stick to the bottom of the 
stewpan. Put into it ^ a stick of vanilla ; cover it down, 
and let it stand till nearly cold. Beat up the yolks of 5 
eggs, mix into them 6 oz. of pounded sugar, put these into 
a stewpan ; take the vanilla out of the milk, which add to the 
eggs, mix them well, and stir the custard over the fire till it 
tMckens, but do not let it boil. Strain it into a bowl ; when 
nearly cold add a glass of noyeau or maraschino ; keep stir- 
ring it, and when on the point of setting add i pint of cream 
well whipped ; mix it well, and pour it into a mould ; set it 
upon ice till wanted, when dip it for a moment into warm 
water, wipe it dry, and turn over upon a dish. 

This is a very fine cream for a Charlotte Busse ; but there 
shotdd be a little more isinglass added, and a glass of brandy 
instead of the noyeau. 

Or : — Boil i a stick of vanilla in i pint of new milk until it 
has a very high flavour ; have ready a jelly of 1 oz. of isinglass 
to i pint of water, which mix with the milk, and 1 J pint of 
fine cream; sweeten with fine sugar, and whip until quite 
thick ; then pour into the mould and set it in a cool place. 

Or : — Pound thoroughly with loaf-sugar i stick of vanilla, 
sift it, taking care that the vanilla is passed through the sieve : 
whip a pint of cream ; add the vanilla, sugar, and i oz. of 
dissolved isinglass ; pour into a mould. 

CHARL OTTE R US8E. 

662. — Line the bottom of a plain round mould with Savoy 
biscuits, placing them close together in a star or some device ; 
line the sides, placing the biscuits edgeways, to make them form 
a compact wall ; put the mould upon ice ; have ready a Crime 
au Marasquin^ adding a glass of brandy. Fill the mould as it

when the cream is thick, which it will be when the lemon-^ 
juice is added, pour in the isinglass, and immediately mould 
it. A smaller quantity of isinglass may suffice, but that de- 
pends on the thickness of the cream. 

Other flavours may be used, as orange^ almond, maraschino. 

Or : — Take a pint of thick cream, and put to it the yolks 
of 2 eggs well beaten, 4 oz. of fine sugar^ and the thin rind

cream and new milk mixed, for 15 minutes, or until the 
former be melted; strain it through a hair sieve into a 
basin ; when cool, put about i pint of raspberry-juice, or 
syrup, to the milk and cream ; stir it till well incorporated ; 
sweeten, and add a glass of brandy ; whisk it about till three 
parts cold ; then put it into a mould till quite cold. In sum- 
mer use the fresh juice. Mash the fruit gently, and let it

mixed pour in a quart of thin cream : set it over the fire, bat 
do not let it boil ; stir one way till it thickens, then pour it 
into cups or low glasses. 

When cold it will be ready. A ratafia drop may be put in 
each, if you choose it. If you wish it to keep, scald the 
cream previously. 

RATAFIA CREAM.

lander ; soak some Naples biscuit in white wine, and put the 
i^ry butter over them in heaps as high as it can be raised. 

Or : — To an iron hook in the wall fasten two corners of a 
napkin very firmly ; make a knot with the other two corners, 
60 that you may pass a stick through them. Put the butter 
into this napkin and twist it tightly ; put the dish under, into 
which the butter will fall in very fine threads. It makes a 
pretty side dish. 

APPLE OR GOOSEBERRY SOUFFLE 

674. — Scald and sweeten the fruit, beat it through a sieve, 
and put it into a tart-dish. When cold pour a rich custard 
over it, about 2 inches deep ; whip the whites of the eggs, of 
which the custard was made, to a snow, and lay it in small

pretty supper dish. 

CROQU ANTES OF ALMONDS. 

676. — Blanch, and dry at the mouth of a cool oven, 1 lb. of 
sweet almonds ; when cold, pound them in a mortar with 1 lb.

a stick of cinnamon, stir in sifted ground rice till quite 



492 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIV. 

thick. Take it off the fire ; add the whites of 3 eggs w^ 
beaten ; stir it again over the fire for 2 or 3 minutes, then 
put it into cups that have lain in cold water ; do not wipe 
them. When cold, turn them out, and put theai into the 
dish in which they are to be served; pour round them a 
custard made of the yolks of the eggs and little more than 
i pint of milk. Put on the top a little red currant jeUr or 
raspberry jam. A pretty supper dish. 

ICE CREAMS* 

^11, — To 1 lb< of preserved fruit of any kind add a quart of 
cream, the juice of 2 lemons to heighten Uie flavour, and sugar 
to your taste. Rub the whole through a fine hair sieve ; and 
te raspberry, or any other red fruit, add a little cochineal 
colouring, to g^ve a better tint. 

TO PREPARE ICE FOR ICING. 

678.— -Get a few pounds of ice ; a pailful is necessary to 
freeze a quart of cream ; break it almost to powder, throw 
3 or 4 large handfuls of rock-salt among it. You must pre- 
pare it in a part of the house where as little of the warm air 
comes as you can possibly contrive. The ice and salt being 
in a bucket, put your cream into an icepot, and cover it ; 
immerse it in the ice till quite cold, then twist the pot rapidly 
round. In a few minutes put a spoon in and stir it well, re- 
moving the parts that ice round the edges to the centre. If 
the ice cream or water be in a form, shut the bottom close, 
and move the whole in the ice, as you cannot use a spoon to 
that without danger of waste. There should be holes in the 
bucket, to let off the water as the ice thaws. 

Freezing powders for generating ice are now also much in 
use, and can be procured of tlie patentees, King and Keith, 
Princes-street, Leicester-square.' 

Ratafia Cream tee, — ^Blanch i oz. of bitter almonds, and 
beat them with a teaspoonful of water in a marble mortar ; 
then rub with the paste 2 oz. of lump-sugar, and sinmier 10 
minutes with a teacupful of cream, which add to a quart more 
of cream, and, having strained, ice it. 

■ When any fluid tends towards cold, moving it quickly accelerates the 
cold; and likewise, when any fluid is tendbg to heat, stirring it will 
facilitate its boiling. 



CJhap. XXrV.] CREAMS, &o. 493 

Brown Bread /c^.-^Grate as fine as possible stale brown 
bread, soak a small proportion in cream 2 or 3 hours, sweeten, 
and ioe it ; but keep stirring, that the bread may not sink. 

Vanilla Cream, if iced, is made with a deooction or essence 
of that spice mixed with the cream. * 

Iced Custard is also very good. 

Almond Cream Ice.-^Tsike 6 oz. of bitter almonds (sweet 
ones will not do), blanch them, and pound them in a mortar, 
adding by d^rees a little rose^-water. Boil them gently in 
a pint of cream till you find that it is highly flavoured with 
them. Then pour the cream into a bowl, stir in i lb. of pow- 
dered loaf-sugar, cover it, and set it away to cool gradually. 
When it is cold, strain it, and then stir it gradually and hard 
into 3 pints of cream. Put it into the freezer, and proceed 
as directed. Freeze it twice. It will be found very fine. 

Send round always with ice-cream sponge-cake : afterwards 
win? and cordials, or liqueurs, as they are now generally called. 

WATER ICE 8 

679. — Are made with the juice of lemon, currant, or rasp^ 
berry, or any other sort of fruit, being gained by squeezing, 
sweetened, and mixed with water. Rub some fine sugar on 
lemon or orange, to give the colour and flavour, then squeeze 
the juice of either on its respective peel ; add water and 
sugar to make a fine sherbet, and strain it before it be put 
into the icepot. If orange, the greater proportion should be 
of the China juice, and only a little of Seville, and a small bit 
of the peel grated by the sugar. 

To make Joe Punch, as used in Italy, — Mix a rich sherbet, 
and grate a piece of sugar on a lemon or citron for flavour ; 
then beat the whites of 5 or 6 eggs to a froth, and by degrees 
stir it into the sherbet : add rum, ice it, and serve in glasses. 

TRIFLE.— E. R, 

680. — Place at the bottom of the trifle-dish a layer of maca- 
roons and ratafia-cakes, and pour over them as much sweet 
wine or brandy as they will absorb. Squeeze the juice of a 
lemon, and add it to a quart of cream not too thick ; sweeten 
the cream with sugar rubbed upon the rind ; add a little 
brandy and the white of an e^^ beaten to a froth. Whisk 
the mixture, and as the froth rises lay it on a sieve to drain ; 



494 MODEBN DOMESTIC COOKERY. CG^iaf. XHV. 

when enough has been drained for the pmrposey make a cm- 
taid with the remaining cream and that which has Ai^«y*i 
fixMn the froth ; put it on a very slow fire with two laiml- 
leayes, and whai nearly boiling tike it off, and add the yolks 
of 4 eggs and the whites of 2 — the number Deoeasaiy &r a 
pint of costard. Put it again on the fire, stirring slowly one 
way till it thickens, but taking care not to allow it to come 
to a boil. Coyer the macaroons with raiq>berry or other jam, 
then pour on the custard ; and when the custard is quite cold 
put on the froth, sprinkling harlequin comfits on the top, 
and garnishing with difierent-coloured sweetmeats. 

In some of the good old-fiishioned receipts for trifle, a 
layer of calTs-foot jelly is added to the others. Modern 
trifles are often trifles indeed, merely consisting of a few cakes 
and a little froth. 

TIPSY CAKE. 

681. — ^Take a savoy cake ; stick almonds, cut in fillets, 
regularly in it ; pour equal quantities of wine and brandy

682. — Mix 3 half-pints of thin cream with i pint of raisin 
wine, a little lemon-juice, orange-flower water, and sugar; 
put into a dish for the middle of the table, and put on the 
cream a froth, which may be made of raspberry or currant 
jeUy. 

Another way, — Scald a codling before it be ripe, or any 
sharp apple ; pulp it through a sieve. Beat the whites of 2 
eggs with sugar and a spoonful of orange-flower water ; mix 
in by degrees the pulp, and beat together until you have a 
large quantity of froth ; serve it on raspberry cream or put 
it on a custard.

it up again, flavour it with a little orange-flower water, stir 
it until it is nearly cold, and then put it into the mould. 
Observe to wash the isinglass in cold water before it is put 
to the milk, and soak the moulds in cold water some hours 
before they are used.

and serve with sweetmeat oi - Ki m uld 

jelly round it. If put into a 
cylindrical mould, the centre should be filled with fruit or 
sweetmeat. 

aOOSEBERR Y-FOOL. 

685. — Put the fruit into a stone jar, with some good Lisbon 
sugar ; set the jar on a stove, or in a saucepan of water over 
the lire ; if the former, a large spoonjul of water should be 
added to the finiit. When it is done enough to pulp, press it 
through a colander ; have ready a teacupfiil of new milk and 
the same quantity of raw cream boiled together, and left to 
be cold ; then sweeten pretty well with fine Lisbon sugar, and

to the flavour. They are to be obtained at all the grocers', 
and should be soaked in cold water for about 12 hours. To 
every lb. of apples put a quart of water and i lb. of moist 
sugar, with about a dozen cloves ; let them simmer till quite 
tender ; when cold lay them in a dish, and lay thin strips of

glasses. 

London Syllabub. — Put H pint of port or white wine into 
a bowl, nutmeg grated, and a good deal of sugar, then pour 
into it near 2 quarts of hot milk, frothed up. If the wine be

Or : — Put some new milk into a china or other basin, or 
else warm some cold milk to the same heat as new, add to it 
a little calf's rennet, and, if approved, a little brandy or rum 
may also be added ; stir it with a spoon so as to mix the 
whole perfectly. Place it near the fire or on a warm stove or 
hearth until turned, but it must not be kept too hot, or it will 
not turn properly. When turned, put sugar, gprated nutmeg,

first strained, put to it 1 large spoonful of white ^iugar and 2 
of orange-flower water. Pour it into shallow dishes, and 
serve to eat with wine, cider, milk, or cream and sugar. It 
is very good.

it with loaf-sugar, not pounded, lest any dust should be in it; 
add a spoonful of rose-water and the same of orange-flower 
water. Strain it into a basin or form, and serve with baked 
pears round it. 

nice Flummery. — Boil with a pint of new milk a bit of 
lemon-peel and cinnamon ; mix with a little cold milk as 
much rice-flour as will make the whole of a good consistence; 
sweeten, and add a spoonful of peach-water or a bitter almond 
beaten ; boil it, taking care it does not bum ; pour it into a 
shape or pint basin, taking out the spice. When cold, turn 
the flummery into a dish, and serve with cream, milk, or 
custard, round. 

An excellent Flummery, — Take 1 pair of calf's feet, boil 
them in 3 quarts of water till reduced to 1 pint ; when cold 
take off the &t very carefully ; boil it with a laurel-leaf, add 
i pint of cream with a tablespoonful of orange-flower water. 
Beat it up till it is as thick as cream ; pour it into cups pre- 
viously laid in cold water, or into a mould. 

As to the chemical compounds so generally advertised for 
the making of jellies, custards, and blancmange, they are 
worthless in comparison with the animal substance of meat, 
eggs, and milk, of which such delicacies ought to be formed ; 
they are not cheaper nor so nutritive, neither do we know 
of what they are composed. 



JELLIES. 

691. — It is a complaint amongst even experienced house- 
keepers that they cannot feel a certainty of having jelly clear; 
but by strictly attending to the following method for making 
calf 's-foot jelly, they can scarcely fail to have it beautifully 
bright. 

Feet for all jellies are boiled so long by the people who 
sell them that they are less nutritious : they should be pro- 
cured from the butcher and only scalded to take off the hair. 
The liquor will require greater care in removing the fat; 
but the jelly will be far stronger. A little isinglass, i oz. 
to a quart of stock, may be used to secure the finnness, 
particularly in summer. In peeling lemons, care should he 
taken not to cut below the colour, as by so doing a great deal 



Chap. XXIV.] JELLIES. 499 

of the flavour of the essential oil is lost, and the white part 
gives a diss^eeable flavour. The stock should be measured 
when set to get cold, as the exact quantity cannot be measured 
when it is set. 

Jelly is equally good made of cow-heels nicely cleaned ; 
and they bear a less price than those of calves, and make a 
stronger jelly. 

CALFS-FOOT JELLY. 

^92. — ^Boil 2 feet in 2 quarts and a pint of water till the 
feet are broken and the water half wasted ; strain it, and the 
following day take off" the fkt, and remove the jelly from the 
sediment; then put it into a saucepan, witli a laurel-leaf, 
20 coriander-seeds, the peel of 2 lemons, sugar to palate, i 
pint of sherry, and a wineglass of brandy. When the flavour 
is rich, put to it the whites of 5 eggs well beaten, and their 
shells broken. The whole of the ingredients should be cold 
when mixed together, to ensure the jelly being clear. Set the 
saucepan on the fire, but do not stir the jelly after it gets hot. 
Let it boil 20 minutes after it rises to a head ; then pour it 
through a flannel jelly-bag, first dipping the bag in hot water 
to prevent waste, and squeezing it quite dry. Run the jelly 
through and through until clear ; then put it into glasses or 
moulds. After all the jelly has run through the bag, pour 
boiling water into the bag from 1 to 3 half-pints, according to 
the quantity of the jelly that has been made. This will make 
an exceedingly pleasant beverage, particularly in hot weather. 

The following mode will greatly facilitate the clearing of 
jelly : — When the mixture has boiled 20 minutes, throw in a 
teacupful of cold water ; let it boil 5 minutes longer ; then 
take the saucepan ofi" the fire, covered close, and let it stand i 
an hour ; after which it will be so clear as to need only once 
running through the bag, and much waste will be saved. 

Or : — Boil 4 quarts of water, with 3 calf 's-feet, or 2 cow- 
heels, that have been only scalded, tiU half wasted : take the 
jelly from the fat and sediment ; mix with it the juice of a 
Seville orange and 12 lemons, the peels of 3 ditto, the whites 
and shells of 12 eggs, white sugar to taste, a pint of wine, 
1 oz. of coriander-seeds, 2 bay-leaves, a bit of cinnamon, and 
6 cloves, all bruised, after having previously mixed them cold. 
The jelly should boil 15 minutes without stirring; then clear 
it through a flannel bag. While runninGr, take a little jelly, 



500 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIV. 

and mix with a teacupful of water in which a bit of beet-root 
has been boiled, and run it through the bag when all the rest 
is run out ; this is to garnish the other jelly, being cooled on a 
plate : but this is matter of choice. This jelly has a very fine 
high colour and flavour. 

Another, — Boil a cow-heel in 2 quarts of water for 7 or 8 
hours : take every particle of fat and sediment from the jelly ; 
when cold put to it a pint of raisin wine, the juice of 3 
lemons and the rind of 2 pared very thin, about 6 oz. of 
sugar, the whites and shells of 3 eggs well beaten, and i oz. 
of isinglass. Boil it 20 minutes, then add a teacupful of cold 
water ; let it boil 5 minutes longer, then cover it up close and 
let it stand off the fire i an hour ; pour it through a jelly-bag 
until clear, put it into a mould, and set it on ice. 

Orange Jelly, — To a pint of calf 's-foot stock put a pint of 
strained China orange-juice mixed with that of 1 or 2 lemons ; 
add 6 oz. of sugar, the rinds of 3 oranges and 1 lemon pared 
very thin, the whites and shells of 3 eggs ; mix these well 
together. When it boils, let it simmer i an hour ; take it off 
the fire, cover up close, and let it stand 20 minutes, then pour 
it through a bag till clear. In all jellies it is to be under- 
stood the process of clearing should be the same as for calf 's- 
foot, already given. 

Lemon Jelly, — Take a quart of calfs-foot stock, add 
i pint of lemon-juice, i lb. of loaf-sugar, the rind of 2 lemons 
pared very thin, the whites and shells of 6 eggs ; boil and 
clarify as already stated. The colour should be bright. For 
variety, any rich white liqueur might be added, taking away 
an equal quantity of lemon-juice. It should be borne in mind 
that lemon-peel cut thick does not impart nearly so much 
flavour as the same quantity cut very thin. 

Apple Jelly, — Pour a quart of prepared apple-juice on 
1 lb. of fresh apples pared and cored; simmer them until 
they are well broken ; strain the juice, and let it stand until 
cold. Put H pint into a stewpan with a quart of calPs-foot 
stock, 9 oz. of sugar broken small, the rind and juice of 2 
lemons, with the whites and sheUs of 8 eggs. Let it boil for 
about i of an hour ; strain it through a jelly-bag, and when 
<sool put it into moulds. Good baking apples should be used, 
and the quantity of the sugar must vary according to the tart- 
nesB of the fruit.

Fruil in Jelly. — Prepare a calf Vfoot jelly ; before putting 
it into the mould pick, wash, 
and drain on a cloth some fine 
pine strawberries, some lai^e 
white raspberries, and bunches 
of red and white currants. Lay 
&t the bottom of the mould a 
large bunch of white currants 
surrounded with pine strawber^ 
ries ; on these a layer of white 
raspberries and red currants. 
Cover them entirely with jelly ; 
when quite firm arrange another 
layer of fruit, and so on till the mould is filled. Just before 
wanted dip the mould into warm water for a moment, wipe it, 
and turn tiie jelly out. The fruits may be varied according to 
the season. Preserved fruits may be used, but the colour will 
not be BO fine as fresh fruit. 

TO CLABIFY ISINaZASS. 
693. — Take 2 oz. of isinglass, pour on it a pint of spring 
water which has been mixed with a teaspoonfiil of beaten 
white of egg anrt a tablespoonful of lemon-juice. Stir them 
thoroughly together, and let them heat slowly, taking care 
the isinglass does not stick tu tlie bottom of the pan ; simmer 
a few minutes, clear oif the scum till no more appears ; strain 
it through muslin, and set it by for use : it will be trans- 
parent, and may be wanned and mixed with the clear juice 
of any kind of fruit already sweetened, or with syrup in jellies 
flavoured with liqueur. As a portion of the isinglass is taken 
up by the white of e^, i to each oz. should be allowed for 
this. The finest sort of isinglaas, which should be white and 
without any smell, does not require to be clarified, excepting 
for clear jellies ; for all other purposes it is enuugh to dis- 
solve and skim it, and to pa^s it through a strainer. A great 
variety of excellent jellies may be made with clarified isinglass 
and the juice or syrup of almost any kind of fresh fruit, the 
colour of which is best preserved by mashing it lightly and 
strewing pounded sugar over it, letting it stand 3 or 4 hours 
for the juice to drain off; pour a little water over, and use the 
juice without boiling. This can only be done when fruit is 
plentiful, as it requires double the quantity. It is also a great 
improvement to these jellies to put the movA&a VaX» S(^% % <st ^ 



502 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXIV. 

hours before they are served. It will not be necessary to g^ve 
more than a few receipts, as the process is the same in all. 

ISINGLASS JELLIES, 

694. — Strawberry Jelly. — If the fruit is not very abundant, 
boil i lb. of loaf-sugar in a pint of water for 20 minutes ; pour 
this boiling hot over a quart of picked scarlet strawberries : let 
them stand all night. Clarify 2i oz. of isinglass in a pint of 
water ; drain the syrup from the strawberries, adding a tea- 
cupful of red-currant juice and the juice of a lemon. When 
the isinglass is nearly cold, mix all together ; add more sugar 
if wanted, then put it into moulds. The juice extracted from 
the fruit by laying sugar upon it gives the jelly a finer flavour 
than pouring boiling water upon it. Put the moulds into an 
earthen pan, and cover them with ice broken smalL 

Strawberry and raspberry jelly, when no currants are added,. 
should have the flavour heightened by a little lemon-juice. 

Orange Jelly, — ^Boil H oz. of isinglass in a pint of water 
with the peel of ^ a lemon ; squeeze the juice of 8 China and 
4 Seville oranges through a sieve ; add to it the isinglass 
strained, and 6 oz. of pounded sugar. Set it on the fire, stir it 
well till it almost boils ; when nearly cold, put it into earthen- 
ware moulds which have lain in cold water for 2 or 3 hours. 

Lemon Jelly, — Clarify H oz. of isinglass in a pint of water; 
add i lb. of loaf-sugar, and the rind of 2 lemons cut very thin. 
Squeeze the juice of 4 lemons ; strain it through blotting or 
filtering paper, then stir it into the cool sugar and isinglass : take 
out the peel, and pour it into cups or forms, and place them in ice. 

Currant and Raspberry Jelly, — Take 3 lbs. of ripe cur- 
rants, of which let one-third be white, and a few red raspberries 
to give it flavour ; break them with a silver fork ; put them 
into a jar, which put into a saucepan of boiling water, so as 
to draw the juice : boil 2 oz. of isinglass in i pint of water, to 
which add 1 lb. of loaf-sugar ; when cool, strain the fruit, and 
add an equal quantity of the juice ; mix well together, and 
put it into a mould, and place it in ice to freeze. 

Italian Jelly is made by half filling the mould, and, when 
the jelly is set, laying round upon it a wreath of stiffs blanc- 
mange, cut of equal size with a small round cutter : then fill 
up the mould with jelly nearly cold. 

Hartshorn Jelly, — Simmer 8 oz. of hartshorn shavings with 
2 quarts of water to 1 *, stwm. \\. ^jwi 'W^Sx.^?<\JdbL the rinds of

4 China oranges and 2 lemons pared thin; when cool add the 
juice of both, i lb. of si^ar, and the wliites of 6 eggs beaten 
to a froth ; let the jelly have 3 or 4 boils without stirring, and 
stnun it through a jelly-bag. 

Cranberry Jelly. — Make a very etrong; isinglaaa jelly. 
When cold, mix it with a double quantity of cranberry-juice. 
Sweeten and boil it up ; then strain it into a shape. 

The sugar must be good loaf, or the jelly will not be clear. 

Cranberry and JSice Jelly. — IJoil and press the fruit, strain 
the juice, and by degrees mix into it as much ground rice as 
will, when boiled, thicken to a jelly; boil it gently, stirrioK 
it, and sweeten it to your taste. Put it in a ba^ or form, and 
serve with cream. 

JELLY MOULDS. 

695. — The shape of the moulds used for jellies and creams 
is a matter of importance in the appearance of the entremets 
of a handsome dinner. They should be high and nearly of 
the same size. If jelly or cream sinks tlat on the dish, it has 
a poor and shabby appearance. The variety now to be got at 
all the large ironmongers' shops is very great, some of them 
very elegant. The cylindrical mould shows the transparency

of jelly beautifully, the centre being filled up with a light 
whipped cream after the jelly is dished, which not only sets 
off the jelly, but is very good eaten with it. Also one for 
jellies of mixed colours, which is very pretty. These are filled 
with the jelly, coloured, and each layer allowed to get cold 
before the next is added, A little cochineal or sliced beet- 
root, with a few drops of lemon-juice, makes a beautiful red ; 
spinach -juice, boiled witii a small quantity of water to take off 
the rawness, makes a dark green.

CONFECTIONABT. 



696. — Stove. — In storerooms, or where there is not a chap- 
coal stove for the purpose of preserving, the small portable 
French stove is found very convenient. A tin, with the 

sides a little turned up, 
should be placed under it ; 
and there should be a free 
ventilation of air, as the 
best fuel for it is charcoaL 
It is lighted in the same 
way as a charcoal stove, 
by putting upon the bars a 
piece of charcoal already 
ignited ; and may be put 
out by fixing the lid closely 
down. The French call it 
un Foumeau Eco7wm%que. 
The original price is only 

Stove for Preserving. a few shillings. 

TO CLARIFY AND BOIL SUGAR. 

697. — The boiling of sugar more or less constitutes the chief 
art of the confectioner. Those who are not practised in this 
knowledge, and only preserve, in a plain way, for family use, 
are not aware that in 2 or 3 minutes a syrup over the fire will 
pass from one gradation to another, called by the confectioners 
" degrees of boiling," of which there are 6, and those sub- 
divided. Such minutiae cannot, however, be attended to by pri- 
vate parties ; and the observation is only made to guard against 
both underboiling, which prevents preserves from keeping, and 
too quick and long boiling, which brings them to a candy. 

The finest sugar should be used in confectionary, as it 
requires less clarifying, and consequently less is wasted, as 
the coarser sorts lose mxieYi m VHcl^ y^^^^ss»« Break the sugar 




Chap. XXV.] 



CLARIFIED SUGAR.

into large lumps, and put it into a preserving-pan. If for 
syrup, aidd a pint of cold water to each pound ; if for candy- 
ing, a couple of wineglassfuls to the pound will be sufficient. 
B^t the whitef of an egg, add it to the water, mix it well, and 
pour it over the sugar ; 1 egg is enough for 12 lbs. of sugar 
if it is fine, or 2 if it is coarse. When the sugar is nearly 
melted, stir it well, and put it over a gentle fire; do not 
stir it after the scum begins to rise ; let it boil 5 minutes, 
then take it off the fire, let it stand a minute or two, then take 
the scum carefully off; put the pan again on the fire, and 
when the syrup begins to boil throw in a little cold water, 
which should be kept back for the purpose ; boil till the scum 
rises, draw it off the fire, and skim it as before ; repeat this 
till quite clear ; it is then fit for use. It is by long boiling 
that the different degrees are acquired which the confectioner 
requires. When it is fit for candying, it may be drawn out 
into threads by taking a little between the thumb and finger ; 
but for barley-sugar or caramel, the way to prove it is by 
dropping a little into cold water ; if it snap between the teeth 
without sticking to them, it should then be instantly taken off 
the fire. If for barley-sugar, a few drops of essence of lemon 
should be added, then pour it upon a broad dish, and when 
the edges begin to harden roll it up into sticks. If for caramel, 
or spun sugar, oil a mould and draw out the sugar in threads 
over it, let it cool, then place it over the fruit or tart it is in- 
tended to cover. The various degrees in sugar-boiling, if re- 
quired to a nicety, may best be ascertained by means of a very 
simple saccharometer, to be had at any instrument-maker's, 
consisting of a tin tube, into which, when nearly filled with 
the syrup, a small graduated rod, having a weight at the lower 
end to hold it in a perpendicular position, is inserted ; and 
according to the degree it marks on the surface of the syrup, 
the stage is denominated as in the following table : —

OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVING. 

698. — Attention, with practice, will enable a person to make 
any of the following sorts of preserves, &c., and they are as 
much as is wanted in a private fiunily. The higher articles of 
preserved fruits may be bought at less expense than they can 
be made. 

Preserves should be kept carefuUy from the air, and in a 
very dry place. Unless they have a very small prop(»tion of 
sugar, a warm one does not hurt; but when not prc^fierly 
boiled (that is, long enough, but not quickly), heat makes 
them ferment, and damp causes them to gpK)w mouldy. They 
should be looked at 2 or 3 times in the first 2 months, that 
they may be g^tly boiled again if not likely to keep. Paste 
the edge of the outer paper, as it keeps out the air better than 
a string ; put plain writing-paper over the fruit ; brandy will 
give them a tendency to ferment. 

Dried sweetmeats, cakes, &c., should be kept in tin boxes, 
between layers of white paper, in a very dry but not hot 
room. 

When any sweetmeats are directed to be dried in the son 
or in a stove, it will be best, in private &milies, where there 
is not a regular stove for the purpose, to put them in the sun 
on flag-stones, which reflect the heat, and place a garden 
glass over them to keep insects off; or if put into an oven, 
take care not to let it be too warm, and watch that they do 
properly and slowly. 

All fruits for preserving should be gathered in dry weather; 
but as this is not always practicable, much inconvenience 
may be obviated by boiling the fruit for jellies and jams long 
before the sugar is added. By so doing, the watery particles 
will evaporate, and the preserve will be better flavoured, by 
the sugar not being too long on the fire. 

The common sort oi preserves are cheaper, if not better, 
when made in the house than when purchased from the con- 
fectioner ; with this observation, that if there be children in 
the family, the plan will then probably be found anything 
but economical. 

Pans of copper or bell-metal are the proper utensils for pre- 
serving fruit : when used, they must be scoured bright with 
sand. Tinned pans turn and destroy the colour of the fruit 
that is put into them. There is now a new sort of stewpan to 



Chap. XXV.] CANDIED FRUITS. 507 

be got at most of the large ironmongers' : it is of iron, coated 
with earthenware. Omelette-pans should be of the same ma- 
terial. Sieves and horn spoons should be kept for sweet things 
only. 

TO CANDY.— E. R. 

699. — Almonds. — ^Blanch any quantity of almonds, then fry 
them in butter till they are of a light-brown colour ; wipe 
them nicely with a napkin, and put them into a pan. Make 
a syrup of white sugar, and boil it to a thread — ^that is, until 
on your taking a drop of the sugar between the finger and 
thumb it will produce a thread ; care must be taken to boil 
it to the exact candying-point ; pour it boiling hot upon the 
almonds, and stir them till they are quite cold. This is an 
excellent method of preparing almonds for dessert, and much 
approved of in London by the guests of his highness the 
Nawaub of Oude, from whose cook it has been obtained. 

Bon-bons. — Clear off the sugar from fresh candied citron or 
orange rind, cut it into squares 1 inch thick, stick them singly 
on a bit of thin wire, and dip them into liquid barley-sugar ; 
rub a dish with a few drops of pure salad oQ, and lay the fruit 
upon this to cool. They should be kept in tin canisters in a 
very dry place. 

Toffie. — Melt in a stewpan 3 oz. of fresh butter, add 1 lb. 
of good moist sugar, stir it well over a gentle fire, and let it 
boil about i of an hour, or till it cracks short between the 
teeth like barley-sugar; then pour it upon buttered dishes, 
and when nearly cold mark it across in squares that it may 
easily divide, or roll it into sticks. When half-boiled, the 
grated rind of a lemon or a teaspoonful of ground ginger may 
be added. A few sliced almonds may be added after it is 
poured upon the dishes. 

To candy any sort of Fruit. — When finished in the syrup, 
put a layer into a new sieve, and dip it suddenly into hot 
water, to take ofi* the syrup that hangs about it ; put it on a 
napkin before the fire to drain, and then do some more in 
the sieve. Have ready sifted double-refined sugar, which sift 
over the fruit on all sides till quite white ; set it on the shallow 
end of sieves in a lightly warm oven, and turn it 2 or 3 times. 
It must not be cold till dry. Watch it carefully, and it will 
be beautiftil. 



508 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXV. 



TO GREEN FRUITS FOR PRESERVING OR PICKLING. 

700. — Take pippins, apricots, pears, plums, peaches, while 
green, for the first, or radish-pods, French beans for the latter, 
and cucumbers for both processes, and put them, with vine- 
leaves under and over, into a preserving-pan with spring water 
to cover them, and close the pan to exclude all air. Set it on 
the side of a fire, and when they begin to simmer take than 
off ; take them out carefully with a slice ; the next day pat 
them again on the fire. They are to be peeled, and then done 
according to the receipts for the several modes. 

BOTTLED FRUIT— E. R. 

701 . — The best way of preserving all firuit for tarts is by 
bottling ; and if the following directions be exactly observed, 
it will be found to answer admirably : — Gather any kind of 
fruit on a dry day — currants, gooseberries, plums^ &c. ; put 
it into wide-mouthed bottles ; it should not be fully ripe. Mix 
currants and raspberries in the same bottle, and put 2 oz. of 
sugar into each ; then have bladders cut so large, that when 
they are tied over the bottles they will hang an inch all round 
below the string. Let the bladders be wet, and tied tightly ; 
then put the bottles up to their necks into a copper of cold 
water, with some straw between.* Light a fire under the 
copper, and, when the fruit has sunk into the juice, let the 
fire go out, and leave the bottles in the water until it is cold ; 
turn the bottles upside down, and keep them in a cool place. 
If they leak they must be used at once. Fruit thus preserved 
will keep for any number of years, retaining all its original 
fireshness. They will require more sugar when put into tarts 
or puddings. The contents of a bottle when opened must be 
used at once, for the air getting in will spoil them. 

Green Apricots for Tarts. — When the apricots are the size 
of a large hazel-nut, thin the trees, gather them on a dry day, 
wipe them clean, prick them, throw them into a weak syrup, 
boil them up, let them remain 24 hours, then boil them again ; 
they will now be quite green. When cold, put them into 

* On this, however, we may remark, that,, although bladders may answer 
the purpose, yet good corks are the only means by which any certainty can 
be obtained ; and for facilitating the sure corking, a small machine, made by 
Cooper, St. John-stveet, caxmot b« too highly recommended. 



Chap. XXV.] PRESERVED FRUITS. 509 

wide-mouthed bottles, and fill up the bottles with the syrup ; 
proceed as before stated ; boil for 20 minutes. 

Hipe Apricots. — Cut them in halves, pack them closely in 
bottles, which you can easily do with the assistance of 2 
skewers ; shake them down well ; crack the stones, peel the 
kernels, put a few into each bottle, fill the bottle with weak 
syrup, cork them well, tie tightly down, put on in cold water, 
and boil for 15 minutes. 

Green Gages, — ^Take them before they are thoroughly ripe, 
prick them all over, put in bottles, fill with syrup, cork and 
tie them down, put them into cold water, let them heat very 
gradually; when they are turned brown take them off the 
fire, and the next day let them boil for 10 minutes. 

Cherries. — Fill the bottles and shake them down close, put 
on the top 2 oz. of powdered lump-sugar, cork and tie them 
down, put them on to boil, and when the juice covers the fruit 
they are done. 

TO KEEP GRAPES (as in Switzerland). 

702. — ^Fasten packthread lines near the ceiling of a cool but 
not damp room. Pick the grapes before they are very ripe ; 
cut out every one that is decayed, but do not let their juice 
touch those that remain ; seal the extremity of the stsdk to 
keep it from drying, and hang the bunches on the pack- 
thread. 

Or in Brandy. — Take some close bunches, black or white, 
not over-ripe, and lay them in a jar. Put a good quantity of 
pounded white sugar-candy upon them, and fill up the jar with 
brandy ; tie them close down with a bladder, and keep in a 
dry place. Each grape should be pricked thrice. 

They make a beautiful middle dish in a winter dessert. 

TO PRESERVE FRUIT FOR TARTS. 

703. — Cherries, plums of all sorts, and American apples, 
gather when ripe, and lay them in small jars that will hold a 
pound ; strew over each jar 6 oz. of good loaf-sugar pounded ; 
cover with 2 bladders each, separately tied down ; then set 
the jars in a large stewpan of water up to the neck, and let it 
boil 3 hours gently. Keep these and all other sorts of fruit 
free from damp. 



610 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXY. 



TO PRESERVE APRICOTS, 

704. — Green Apricots. — Prick the apricots, cover the bot- 
tom of a preserving-pan with vine-leaves, fill the pan with 
apricots and cold spring water, laying more vine-leaves on the 
top. Put them over a slow fire until they turn yellow ; then 
take them off, and wipe them well with a flannel and a little 
salt, and put them over the fire in the same water to green 
them. Have ready a thin syrup ; boil the apricots up in it 
once, and repeat the process on the 2 following days. Drain 
them from the syrup, and, rendering it strong with sugar, 
boil them again in the thick syrup, and put them by for use. 
Peaches, nectarines, &c., may be preserved the same way. 

Ripe Apricots. — ^Having pared the apricots, thrust out the 
stones with a skewer, and take the same weight of loaf-sugar 
as of fruit ; strew a part of the sugar over the apricots, zxA 
let them stand till next day ; then boil them up gently 3 or 4 
different times, adding the kernels to the syrup. Let them 
cool between each boiling, then take them out of the syrup 
carefully one by one ; boil the syrup with all the sugar, skim 
it carefully, then pour it over the apricots, and tie them down 
close with a paper and bladder. 

A beautiful Preserve of Apricots. — When ripe, choose the 
finest apricots ; pare them as thin as possible, and weigh than ; 
lay them in halves on dishes, with the hollow part upwards ; 
have ready an equal weight of good loaf-sugar, finely pounded, 
and strew it over them ; in the mean time break the stones 
and blanch the kernels. When the fruit has lain 12 hours, 
put it, with the sugar and juice, and also the kernels, into U 
preserving-pan ; let it simmer very gently till clear, then 
take out the pieces of apricot singly, put them into small 
pots, and pour the syrup and kernels over them. The scum 
must be taken off as it rises. Cover with paper. 

Apricots in Jelly. — ^Pare the fruit very thin, and stone it; 
weigh an equal quantity of sugar in fine powder, and strew 
over it. Next day boil very gently till they are clear, move 
them into a bowl, and pour the liquor over. The following 
day pour the liquor to a quart of codling-liquor ; let it boil 
quickly till it will jelly ; put the fruit into it, and give 1 boil ; 
skim well, and put into small pots. 

To dry Aprxc(M whole or in halves, — Take them before 



Chap. XXV.] PRESERVED FRUITS. 511 

they are fully ripe, scald them m a jar plunged into boiling 
water, then pare them and take out the stones ; put them into 
a syrup of half their weight of sugar, in proportion of 1 pint of 
water to 4 lbs. of sugar ; let them scald awhile, and then boil 
until they are clear. Let them stand for 2 days in the syrup, 
and then put them into a thin candy, and scald, but not boil, 
them in it. Keep them 2 days longer in the candy, heating 
them each day, and then lay them on glasses to dry. 

APPLE-JUICE TO USE FOR JELLY. 

706. — Pour into a stewpan a quart of cold water ; throw into 
it, as quickly as they can be peeled, cored, and weighed, 4 lbs. 
of good boiling apples of fine flavour — codlings are the best ; 
stew them till the fruit is well broken ; strain through a jelly- 
bag ; to every quart of this juice allow H lb. of sugar. This 
makes a beautiful jelly to preserve other fruits in. 

TO PRESERVE RIPE PEACHES.— E. R. 

706. — October is the best month, as they are then harder 
and larger. Put them into a preserving-pan full of cold water, 
with a slice or two of lemon ; set them on a slow fire ; have 
ready a sieve and a napkin ; be careful not to do them too 
much : some will be ready sooner than others. When they 
begin to be soft they are done enough : drain them on the 
sieve, and let them stand until cold ; then put them into glasses : 
pound sugarcandy very fine in a mortar, dissolve it in brandy, 
and fill up the glasses with it. 

Or : — Wipe, weigh, and pick the fruit, and have ready a 
quarter of the weight of fine sugar in fine powder. Put the 
fruit into an icepot that shuts very close ; throw the sugar 
over it, and then cover the fruit with brandy. Between the 
top and cover of the pot put a piece of double cap-paper. 
Set the pot in a saucepan of water till the brandy be as hot 
as you can possibly bear to put your finger in, but it must not 
boil. Put the fruit into a jar, and pour the brandy on it. 
When cold put a bladder over it, and tie it down tight. 

TO PRESERVE NECTARINES— E. R. 

707. — Split the fruit, take out the stones, and put the nec- 
tarines into clarified sugar till they take it well. Skim the 
liquor, cover the nectarines with paper, and set them by 
until the next day. Add sugar to tiie syrup, boiling it until 



512 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chaf. XXV. 

it will flow; put in the nectarines, give them a good boil, 
skim, cover them, and lay them on a stove. The next daj 
take them out of the sugar, drain them, place them sefA- 
rately, dusting sugar over them ; the next day put them on the 
stove or into a cool oven to dry. 

TO PRESERVE A MELON,-- E. R, 

708. — Scrape off the thin outside skin, make a hole in the 
top, take out the seeds ; then throw the melon into water, and 
after it has remained 12 hours take it out and put it into 
a preserving-pan, with a large piece of loaf-sugar and as 
much water as will cover it ; then cover the pan closely, and 
let it remain for an hour on a very slow fii^ Repeat this 
process 3 times, on 3 successive days, taking care not to 
allow it to boil ; make a thin syrup, drain the melon carefully 
out of the liquor, and put it into the syrup, set it over a slow 
fire closely covered for \ an hour every day for 3 ensuing days, 
on the last day boiling the syrup untU it is very rich, with the 
rind of one, and the juice of 2 lemons To improve the flavour 
of a melon, take it when nearly ripe, cut out so much of the 
large end as to permit the scooping out of the seeds ; then fill 
up the hollow with water and sugar, or white wine ; close the 
top, put the melon in a net exposed to the sun for as many 
days as it remains good. A wcUer melon will thus acquire 
a fine flavour ; but a musk melon requires no improvement. 

Or : — Take a melon, cut it into pieces as for eating, trim off 
the outer rind, freely dust it over with fine sugar, and 12 hours 
after put it in a preserving-pan with sufficient syrup to cover 
it ; boil it gently until tender, repeat the boiling for 3 succes- 
sive days, when the syrup should be thick. 

TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES,— E. R, 

709. — Obtain the juice of currants by boiling them in a 
jar plunged in water ; to every pint of the currant-liquor add 
1 lb. of strawberries and the weight of both in sugar. Break 
the sugar in lumps, dip them in water to dissolve, then 
boil it with the currant-juice, skim it well, then put in the 
strawberries ; let them boil about i of an hour, and, while yet 
warm, put them with the syrup in pots. 

To preserve Strawberries whole. — To 1 lb. of picked fruit 
add f lb. of pounded lump-sugar. Lay part of it upon the 



Chap. XXV.] PRESERVED FRUITS. 513 

fruit, and let it remain until the next day ; then put the re- 
mainder of the sugar and a pint of currant-juice to every lb. 
of strawberries into a preserving-pan, and boil to a syrup ; 
then add the strawberries, and simmer very gently till the 
fruit is soft, being careful not to break it ; then take out the 
strawberries, and boil the syrup until it appears to be rich. 
Wait until it is cold, and then put it upon the fruit. 

A rich way of preserving Strawberries, — ^In picking the 
strawberries reserve the largest kinds ; then boil the smaller 
ones, allowing 1 lb. of fine sugar to 1 lb. of fruit ; stir it 
while boiling, and make it into jam. Make a fine syrup 
of sugar, and boil the larger strawberries in it, taking great 
care Uiat they be kept separate, and do not break. Take 
them out, and put them into small preserving-pots ; then boil 
the syrup and the jam together until it is very rich, or make 
it into a jelly by straining it, and pour it on the strawberries 
when nearly cold. Choose the largest scarlets, or others, 
when not dead ripe. In either of the above ways they eat 
well served in thin cream in glasses. 

To preserve Strawberries in Wine, — Put a quantity of the 
finest large strawberries into a gooseberry-bottle, and strew in 
it 3 large spoonfuls of fine sugar ; fill up with Madeira wine 
or fine sherry. 

TO PRESERVE ORANGES OR LEMONS IN JELLY. 

710. — Cut a hole at the stalk the size of a shilling, and 
with a small blunt knife scrape out the pulp quite clear, with- 
out cutting the rind, and lay them in spring water 2 days, 
changing it twice a-day ; in the last, boil them tender on a slow 
fire, keeping them covered to the last. To every lb. of fruit 
take 2 lbs. of double-refined sugar and 1 pint of water ; boil 
the two latter together with the juice of the orange to a syrup, 
and clarify it ; skim well, and let it stand to be cold ; then 
boil the fruit in the syrup ^ an hour ; if not clear, do this 
daily till they are done. 

TO KEEP ORANGES OR LEMONS FOR PASTRY. 

711.— When you have squeezed the juice, throw the peels 
into salt and water ; let them remain a fortnight ; clean out 
the pulp ; boil them till tender, strain them, and when they 
are tolerably dry throw them into any syrup you may have 

2 L 



514 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chaf. XX7. 

remaining from old sweetmeats ; or, if you have none, boil 
a small quantity of syrup of common loaf-sugar and water, 
and put over them ; in a week boil them gently in it till they 
look clear. 

TO PRESERVE WHOLE OR HALF QUINCES, 

712. — Into 2 quarts of boiling water put a quantity of the 
fairest golden pippins, in slices not very thin, and not pared, 
but wiped clean. Boil them very quickly, close covered, till 
the water becomes a thick jelly ; then scald the quinces. To 
every pint of pippin-jelly put 1 lb. of the finest sugar ; boil 
it, and skim it dear. Put those quinces that are to be done 
whole into the syrup at once, and let it boil very &st ; and 
those that are to be in halves by themselves ; skim it, and when 
the fruit is clear put some of the syrup into a glass to try whe- 
ther it jellies before taking off the fire. The quantity of quinces 
is to be 1 lb. to 1 lb. of sugar, and 1 lb. of jelly already boiled 
with the sugar. 

TO PRESERVE PEARS, 

713. — Pare them very thin, and simmer in a thin syrup ; let 
them lie a day or two. Make the syrup richer, and simmer 
again, and repeat this till they are clear ; then drain and dry 
them in the sun or a cool oven a very little time. They may 
be kept in syrup, and dried as wanted, which makes them more 
moist and rich. Jargonelles are the best for this purpose. 

To bake Pears,— These need not be of a fine sort ; but some 
taste better than others, and often those that are least fit to 
eat raw. Wipe, but do not pare, and lay them on tin plates, 
and bake them in a slow oven. When soft enough to bear it, 
fiatten them with a silver spoon. When done through, put 
them on a dish. They should be baked 3 or 4 times, and 
very gently. 

To stew Pears, — Pare and halve or quarter large pears, 
according to their size ; throw them into water, as the skin is 
taken off, before they are divided, to prevent their turning 
black. Pack them round a block-tin stewpan, and sprinkle as 
much sugar over as will make them pretty sweet, and add 
lemon-peel, a clove or two, and some allspice cracked ; just 
cover them with water, and add a little red wine. Cover them 
close and stew 3 or 4 hours ; when tender, take them out, and 
strain the liquor over them. 



Chap. XXV.] PRESERVED FRUITS. 515 



TO PRESERVE SIBERIAN CRASS.—E. R. 

714. — ^Rub the fruit with a dry flannel, taking care not to 
break the skin. Prick each with a needle all over to prevent 
its bursting. Boil 1 lb. of sugar in a pint of water, then 
put in the fruit and boil it until the skin begins to crack 
slightly ; then take up the crabs, drain them separately upon 
a dish ; boil the syrup again, and if not strong enough add 
more sugar ; when cold pour it over the fruit, which must 
be put into jars, tied down closely, and kept in a cool dry 
place. 

Another way, — ^Boil a pint of water and H lb. of refined 
sugar to a fine clear syrup ; skim it, and let it become cold. 
Pare the crabs ; and to this quantitjr of syrup put 1 lb. of 
fruit, and simmer slowly till tender. Carefully remove each 
apple separately, and pour the syrup over when a little cooled, 
and add orange and lemon peel boiled tender. 

BIFFINS, 

The Red Biffin^ or the Minshul Crab, are the best sorts 
for drying. 

715. — Take the Bed Biffin apple, and put them into a cool 
oven 6 or 7 times, flattening them gently by degrees, when 
they are soft enough to bear it. If the oven should be hot 
they will waste ; and they ought to be put at first into a very 
cool one. They are prepared in the same manner in France, 
and when stewed either in milk or wine are very good. 

TO PRESERVE MAGNUM BONUM PLUMS,— E, R. 

716. — Set them over a slow fire in spring water until they 
will peel, keeping them under the water ; peel and put them 
into a jar with a thin syrup, which must cover them, or other- 
wise they will be discoloured. The next day boil the syrup, 
then put in the plums, and give them a gentle boil. Let them 
stand until cold ; then repeat the process ; turn them in the 
syrup until nearly cold. Take out the plums, strain the sy- 
rup, add more sugar, and skim it well ; put in the plums, boil 
them till they are clear, then cover with paper. 

To Bry, — Take the weight of the plums in sugar, wrap 
each plum in a vine-leaf, put them into a stewpan covered 

2 L 2 



516 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXT, 

with water, and set them on a slow fire to scald. When suffi- 
ciently done take them out and laj them m a bowl or deep 
dish, pound the sugar, and put it on them ; the following day 
pour the syrup off, and boil it, and put it on the plums ; this 
do every day for 4 or 5 days ; then take the plums out of the 
syrup, sift sugar over them, lay them upon tins^ and dry them 
in a cool oven or before the fire. 

A common Preserve of Plums. — Put the plums into a jar 
large enough to hold 1 lb. of fruit, add 7 oz. of good minst 
sugar ; tie the jar over with 2 bladders tied separately ; place 
the jar in a kettle of cold water up to the bladders ; do not 
cover the kettle, and let them boil in the water for 3 hours. 

TO PRESERVE GREENGAGES.—E, S. 

717. — Pick and prick all the plums ; put them into a pre- 
serving-pan with cold water enough to cover them. Let thon 
remain on the fire until the water simmers well ; then take off, 
and allow them to stand until half cold, putting the plums to 
drain. To every lb. of plums allow 1 lb. of sugar, which must 
be boiled in the water from which the plums have been taken ; 
let it boil very fast until the syrup drops short from the 
spoon, skimming carefully all the time. When the sugar is 
sufiiciently boiled put in the plums, and allow them to boil 
until the sugar covers the pan with large bubbles. Then pour 
the whole into a pan, and let them remain until the following 
day. Drain the syrup from the plums as dry as possible, boil 
it up quickly, and pour it over the plums ; then set them by ; 
do this a third and a fourth time. On the fifth day, when the 
syrup is boiled, put the plums into it, and let them boil for a 
few minutes ; then put them into jars. Should the greengages 
be over ripe, it will be better to make jam of them, using Jib. 
of sugar to 1 lb. of fruit Warm the jars before putting 
the sweetmeats in, and be careful not to boil the sugar to a 
candy. 

TO PRESERVE GOOSEBERRIES, 

718. — Take the rough-skinned fruit when quite dry, with 
rather more than their weight of sugar pounded fiaie ; lay a 
layer of fruit and a layer of sugar till all are in the pan ; add 
a teacupful of water, and boil the fruit quickly till it is clear; 
take it out and put it into jars ; boil up the syrup till it is 



Chap. XXV.] PRESERVED FRUITS. 517 

thick, then pour it over the fruit. When cold cover close with 
pasted paper. 

MARMALADES, 

719. — Apricot, — Gather the fruit before it is too ripe, stone 
and blanch the kernels. To every lb. of fruit take i lb. of 
fine loaf-sugar ; break the sugar into lumps, dip the lumps in 
water, allow them to dissolve, put it over a clear fire, and let 
it boil to a candy ; then pound and sift it ; pare the fruit, cut 
it into thin slices, put them with the sugar over a slow fire, let 
it simmer till clear, but do not boil it ; add the kernels, and 
then put the marmalade into jars. 

Or : — ^Boil ripe apricots in syrup until they will mash ; beat 
them in a mortar ; take i their weight in loaf-sugar, and suffi- 
cient water to dissolve it ; boil all together, and skim until it is 
clear, and the syrup thick like fine jelly. 

Apple, — ^Pare and core some green pippins, and boil in 
water till quite soft ; break them gently with the back of a 
spoon ; strain the water through a jelly-bag till quite clear ; 
Uien to every pint put 1 lb. of double-refined sugar, the peel 
and juice of a lemon, and boil to a strong syrup. Drain off the 
syrup from the fruit, and pour the apple-jelly over it, and sim- 
mer the whole imtil it becomes thick. Cover with paper. 

Common moist sugar is sometimes employed for family 
use. 

Quince, — Pare and quarter the finiit, put it in layers in a 
stone jar with sugar sprinkled between each; add ateacupfulof 
water, and bake it in a cool oven. Have a quantity of sugar equal 
in weight to the fruit ; allow 1 quart of water to every 4 Ids. ; 
boil the sugar and water together, skimming it well. When 
the quinces are soft add them, with a quart of the juice which 
will be found in the jar : boil them in the syrup, beating it 
with a spoon until the marmalade is quite smooth. 

Another way, — Pare and quarter quinces, weigh an equal 
quantity of sugar ; to 4 lbs. of the latter put 1 quart of water, 
boil and skim, and have it ready whilst 4 lbs. of quinces are 
made tolerably tender by the following mode : — Lay them in 
a stone jar with a teacupful of water at the bottom, and pack 
them with a little sugar strewed between ; cover the jar close, 
and set it on a stove or cool oven, and let them soften till the 
colour become red ; then pour the fruit-syrup and 1 quart of 
quince-juice into a preserving-pan, and boU all together till the 



618 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXV. 

marmalade is completed, breaking the lumps of fruit witk the 
preserving-ladle. 

This fruit is so hard that if it be not done as above it requires 
a great deal of time. 

Stewing quinces in a jar, and then squeezing than through 
a cheese-cloth, is the best method of obtaining the juice to add 
as above : dip the cloth in boiling water first and wring it. 

A very fine Orange Marmalade, — ^Take 50 Seville oranges 
and 12 lemons ; have their weight in loaf-sugar ; grate &e 
oranges slightly all over to take away the bitterest part of the 
peel, cut the rind all round, and with a spoon separate it firom 
the fruit without breaking the edge ; boil the peel in 2 sepa- 
rate waters 20 minutes each time ; the first water should be cold, 
the second boiling. The peel should be shred in extremely 
thin slices ; separate the seeds and every bit of skin from the 
pulp ; then mash it in a marble mortar ; boil the sugar till it 
is a clear syrup ; having dipped the lumps into cold water, add 
the pulp and juice ; let it boil i of an hour ; then add the 
shr^ peel; let it boil till tender. The peel only of the 
lemons is used ; the lemons will do for lemon-pickle. 

Or : — Weigh the oranges ; to 6 lbs. of fruit allow 9 lbs. of 
raw or 6 lbs. of good refined sugar ; boil the oranges whole till 
you can pierce them with a straw. Then cut them in quar- 
ters, take the seeds out of the pulp, and scrape the white under 
skin from the peel. Slice or mince the oranges, put the 
sugar with a little water into a pan ; and when dissolved put 
the whole together, and let it boil on a slow fire until it becomes 
of a proper consistence. 

Orange Marmalade for Puddings. — Take 12 Seville 
oranges, boil them till quite tender, changing the water 2 or 
3 times, take out the seeds, pulp, and inner skin of the rind ; 
beat the outer rind in a marble mortar very fine ; add to it the 
pulp and juice ; to every lb. of this add 2 lbs. of fine moist 
sugar ; mix it all well together ; put it into a larger jar than 
will hold it, as it ferments a little at first. It will keep for 
years, and no boiling is necessary. If made for breakfast it 
looks prettier when made with loaf-sugar. 

Transparent, — Cut the palest Seville oranges in quarters ; 
take the pulp out and put it in a basin ; pick out the seeds and 
skins. Let the outsides soak in water with a little salt all night, 
then boil them \\\ a good c^viantity of spring water till tender ; 



Chap. XXV.] PRESERVED FRUITS. 519 

drain, and cut them in very thin slices, and put them to the pulp ; 
add to every lb. H lb. of double-refined sugar beaten fine ; 
boil them together 20 minutes, but be careful not to break the 
slices. If not quite clear, sinuner 5 or 6 minutes longer. It 
must be stirred all the time very gently. When cold, put it 
into glasses. 

Mixed, — Split and stone 4 dozen plums, blanch the kernels, 
and pound them in a mortar with a little rose-water ; pare 
and core 2 dozen pears and the same number of apples ; put 
them into a jar with a little sugar, but no water. Bake them 
in a cool oven. Beat them well in a preserving-pan, stir in 
3 lbs. of sugar, and boil them 1 hour ; put the marmalade into 
small deep dishes, and dry it gently in a cool oven. 

Scotch. — Take 6 or 8 lbs. of Seville oranges, pare off the 
skins thinly, so that there shall be as little as possible of the 
white portion ; cut the parings into strips or chips, and cut them 
across again into very small pieces. Put them into a pan with 
as much water as will cover them, boil them for 1 hour, then 
strain them through a sieve, and lay them aside. Next quar- 
ter the oranges, and scrape out the pulp and juice into a dish, 
throwing away the white skins, films, and seeds ; put the whole 
into a pan, together with 7 or 8 lbs. of sugar, according to the 
original weight of the oranges ; let the whole boil for i an 
hour ; skim it, and pour it into pans for use. 

It may be observed that, although this marmalade should 
be made entirely of Seville oranges, yet a few, if mixed with 
the common sorts, are sufficient to give the necessary flavour, 
and in that manner is made all thai is sold in the shops as 
" Scotch marmaladeJ' 

COMPOTES. 

720. — Orange. — Lay the oranges in water for 4 hours, then 
boil them till tender, cut them in halves, and take out all the 
insides ; to every lb. of peel well pounded add 1 lb. of sugar ; 
then take all the skins and seeds out of the pulp, add its weight 
of sugar, and beat it well ; then mix it with the peel, and beat 
it again in a mortar, and pot it for use. Two dozen sweet 
Lisbon oranges will make a large jar of paste : it will keep 
good for several years in pots covered with paper. 

Apple. — Take a dozen fine rennets, peel and core them, 
but do not divide them ; put them into a wide-necked jar, strew 



520 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXV. 

amongst them some thinly shred lemon-peel, and put 1 lb. of 
fine moist sugar upon them. When the apples are very ripe 
add a little lemon-juice ; put in i pint of water ; cover the jar 
close, and bake slowly. They may be served hot, with tiie 
juice poured over them ; or, when cold, for dessert, or for 
a comer dish, with a custard poured round them. 

Hed Currant. — Boil i lb. of sugar in i pint of water for 
15 minutes ; simmer a quart of picked currants in it for 10 
minutes. 

Raspberries, cherries, gooseberries, rhubarb, or almost any 
sort of fruit, may be prepared in the same proportions, only 
varying the quantity of sugar according to the acidity of the 
fruit. These compotes will be foimd excellent served with 
batter, bread, ground rice, or any other puddings, or with a 
little custard or cream. 

TO DRY CURRANTS FOR DESSERT.-^E, R, 

721. — Have a basin of water and dissolve in it a sufficient 
quantity of gum- Arabic to make it rather thick ; have also a 
plateful of the best loaf-sugar, pounded and sifted. Dip 
bunches of ripe red currants into the gum- Arabic solution, 
and then roll them well in the sugar : lay them separately on 
a dish to dry in the sun. They are very pretty for dessert, 
to be eaten immediately ; if kept, care must be taken that the 
bunches do not touch, and the process should be repeated by 
rolling tliem in sugar for several days successively. 

BARBERR Y CAKES.—E. R. 

722. — Pick the barberries and weigh them ; to every lb. of 
fruit add 1 lb. of sugar pounded and sifled. Bruise the bar- 
berries in a mortar, boil them gently till nearly all the juice 
is consumed, then take them off' the fire and stir in the sugar 
by degrees ; drop the fruit on earthen dishes to dry : it must 
not go over the fire after the sugar is put in, nor must there 
be any water used. Do not pound the barberries too small, 
as the cakes will not look so well. 

Currant cakes may be made in the same way. 

FRUIT WAFERS FOR DESSERT— E, R. 

723. — ^Take currants, cherries, apricots, or any other fruit ; 
put them into an earthen jar in a kettle of water, and when 
scalded strain them tbxou^Yi ^ d€v^« To every pint of juice 



Chap. XXV.] PRESERVED FRUITS. 521 

add the same weight of finely sifted sugar and the white of a 
small egg» Beat all together until it becomes quite thick, 
then put it upon buttered paper in a slow oven : let them 
remain until they will quit the paper, then turn them, and 
leave them in the oven until quite dry ; cut them into shapes 
and keep them near the fire in a box between paper. 

GOOSEBERRY CHEESE. 

724. — Gather the rough red gooseberries when quite ripe ; 
bake them imtil they are a perfect mash ; pass them through 
a hair sieve, then put them into a preserving-pan, and boil them 
gently. To every lb. of gooseberries put 3 oz. of sugar, which 
should be strewed in every now and then, a little at a time. 
It will take several hours to boil, in order to obtain the proper 
thickness. 

To dry Gooseberries. — Put 5 lbs. of gooseberries into a 

stewpan, and strew over them 1 lb. of sugar ; set them on a 

slow fire ; when the syrup begins to come out take them off; 

scald them in this way for 2 or 3 days, then take them out of 

the syrup, place them upon sieves, and put them before the 

fire or in the sun to dry. They may be dipped into powdered 

white sugar when taken out of the syrup, and thus candied. 

They should be laid between paper in tin boxes when put by 

for use. 

CHERRIES.— E. R. 

726. — To Dry. — Weigh the cherries before they are stoned, 
and allow to every lb. of fruit \ lb. of lump-sugar ; when they 
are stoned set them over a slow fire to heat, then take them out 
of the liquor and put the sugar to them, and let them stand till 
it is dissolved. Then set them over the fire and let them just 
boil. Allow them to stand until they are quite cold, or, if 
convenient, for 2 or 3 days, in the syrup ; afterwards strain 
them, and spread them on sieves to dry, either on a stove or in 
the sun, or in an oven after the bread is drawn. 

The same syrup will do again for more fruit. 

To Dry icithout Sugar. — Stone, and set them over the fire 
in the preserving-pan ; let them simmer in their own liquor, 
and shake them in the pan. Put them in china common dishes ; 
next day give them another scald, and put them when cold 
on sieves to dry in an oven of temperate heat. Twice heat- 
ing, an hour each time, will do them. 

Put them in a box^ with a paper between e!ax^\^^a:^^t« 



522 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXV. 

Preserved in Brandy. — ^Reserve a fourth portiim of the 
cherries, clip the stalks of the remainder ; lay them car^i^ 
in jars, and fill up the jars with brandy, putting no sugar, as 
that would wrinkle them. Then stone the remaining portion, 
boil them with double their weight of sugar, and put th^n 
aside. When the brandy-cherries are taken out for dessert, 
mix a portion of this preserve with the liquor, and they will 
taste very rich ; or the cherries may be strained and the liquor 
only used, in addition to the brandy from the other cherries. 

Another method. — Weigh the finest morellas, having cut 
off half the stalk ; prick them with a new needle, and drop 
them into a jar or wide-mouthed bottle. Found 1 the wdght 
of sugar or white candy ; strew over ; fill up with brandy, and 
tie a bladder over. 

Rolled Cherries^ which taste as if done in Brandy. — ^To 
every 3 lbs. of morella cherries put 1 lb. of double-refined 
sugar, sifted in layers, in a large stone jar or small keg. Stop 
it perfectly close, and roll the jar to and fro for a short time 
every day for 6 weeks. Keep them in a cool place. 

When intended for Tarts and Puddings. — Take 15 lbs. 
of Kentish cherries ; boil, and break them as they boil, and 
when the juice has all boiled away, and the bottom of the pan 
is visible, put in 3 lbs. of lump sugar finely powdered. Stir 
the cherries well, and let them have 2 or 3 boils ; then add a 
pint of currant-juice, skim the pot, and take out the stones, 
which will rise to the top. This jam will keep until late in 
the spring without the addition of any more sugar, and will 
make good tarts and puddings. 

ALMACK'S PRESERVE.— E. R. 

726. — Take different kinds of fruit, stone the plums and 
slice the apples and pears, put them in alternate layers in a 
jar ; set them in the oven until they are quite soft ; then pass 
the pulp through a coarse sieve, and to every lb. of fruit put 
a lb. of moist sugar, set it over a slow fire and stir it till very 
thick, then put it into a wide shallow pot and cut it in slices 
for use. Windfalls may be employed for this sort of sweet- 
meat. 

Another. — Put into a pan 4 dozen split plums, 2 dozen 

apples, and 2 dozen pears, pared thin and cored. Boil them 

iKithout water. When well blended together, and the stones 

taken out, stir m Z Iba* oi aw^ai, ^isA>QKyl\.\iftm an hour. Put 



Chap. XXV.] PRESERVED FRUITS. 523 

it into shallow pans or soup-plates, and dry in the sun or a 
cool oven. 

MAGNUM BONUM PLUMS. 

727. — Prick them with a needle to prevent bursting, simmer 
them very gently in thin syrup, put them in a china bowl, and 
when cold pour it over. Let them lie 3 days ; then make a 
syrup of 3 lbs. of sugar to 5 of fruit, with no more water than 
hangs to large lumps of the sugar dipped quickly and instantly 
brought out. Boil the plums in this fresh syrup after drain- 
ing the first from them. Do them very gently till they are 
clear and the syrup adheres to them. Put them one by one 
into small pots, and pour the liquor over. If any are to be 
dried, keep a little of the syrup in the pan, and boil it quickly : 
then give the fruit one warm more, drain, and put them to cGry 
on plates in a cool oven. These plums are apt to ferment if 
not boiled in two syrups ; the first syrup will sweeten pies, 
but will have too much acid to keep. You may reserve part 
of it, and add a little sugar, to do those that are to dry ; for 
they will not require to be so sweet as if kept wet. Do not 
break them. One parcel may be done after another, and save 



much sugar. 



DAMSON CHEESE.— E. R. 



728. — Stone the damsons, take out the kernels and blanch 
them ; put the whole into a stone jar and bake it. Pour off 
a part of the juice, put the fruit into a preserving-pan, boil it 
quickly until it looks rather dry. To every 2 lbs. of the 
original quantity of fruit take i lb. of loaf-sugar ; now stir 
the sugar well in, and let it simmer slowly for 2 hours. Then 
boil it again quickly until it begins to candy at the sides of 
the pan. Pour the jam into shallow pots not more than an 
inch deep ; cover with brandy-paper, and tie down close. 

Or : — Gather the damsons on a dry day ; bake or boil them 
till the pulp will pass through a coarse hair sieve, then add 
their weight of moist sugar ; boil it li hour, stirring it con- 
tinually to keep it from burning. 

AN EXCELLENT WAY OF DRESSING CHESTNUTS. 

729. — Let them be well roasted and the husks taken off: 
dissolve i lb. of loaf-sugar in a wineglassful of water and the 
juice of a lemon ; put this with the chestnuts in a saucepan ov^^ 



524 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXV. 

a slow fire for 10 minutes ; when cold add a tablespoonfol of 
orange-flower water ; serve in a deep dish, and grate sugar 
over the top. To be handed round at dessert. 

JAMS. 
730. — Raspberry. — Take equal weights of fruit and moist 
sugar ; put them on the fire together ; keep stirring and break- 
ing the fruit till the sugar melts, then boil till it will jelly on 
a plate. 

Though simple, this will be found a very good receipt 
Or : — Take equal weight of fruit and roughly-pounded loaf- 
sugar ; bruise the fruit with the back of a spoon, and boil 
them together for i an hour ; if a little more juice is wanted, 
add the juice of currants drawn as for jelly. 

Grape, — The grapes ought not to be very ripe. They 
should be carefully picked, and all that are at all injured 
should be rejected. To 1 lb. of grapes add i lb. of sugar; 
no water but what hangs about them after they have been 
washed. Put the grapes into a cooking-pan, then a layer of 
sugar, then a layer of grapes. Boil on a moderate fire, stu^ 
ring it all the time, to prevent its burning. 

Cherry. — Stone 4 lbs. of cherries, and put them in a pre- 
serving-pan with 2 lbs. of fine white sugar and a pint of 
red-currant juice. Boil the whole together rather fast, until 
it stiffens, and then put it into pots for use. 

Gooseberry. — Stalk and crop 6 lbs. of the small, red, rough 
gooseberry, put them into a preserving-pan, and, as they 
warm, stir and bruise them to bring out the juice. Liet them 
boil for 10 minutes, then add 4 lbs. of sugar, and place it on 
the fire again ; let it boil, and continue boiling for 2 hours 
longer, stirring it all the time to prevent its burning. When it 
thickens, and will jelly upon a plate, it is done enough. Put 
it into pots, and allow it to remain a day before it is covered. 

Slackberry. — In families where there are many children 
there is no preparation of fruit so wholasome, so cheap, and so 
much admired, as this homely conserve. The fruit should be 
clean picked in dry weather, and to every lb. of berries put i lb. 
of coarse brown sugar ; boil the whole together for f of an hour 
or 1 hour, stirring it well the whole time. Put it in pots like 
any other preserve, and it will be found most useful in families, 
as it may be given to children instead of medicine ; makes 



Chap. XXV.] PRESERVED FRUITS. 525 



excellent puddings; and even if the fruit be purchased in 
London, the cost will not exceed Sd, per lb. 

Barberry. — Take the barberries without stones, pick 
them from the stalks, take their weight in loaf-sugar, put 
them into a jar, and place it in a kettle of water until the 
sugar is dissolved and the barberries quite soft. The next 
day put them into a preserving-pan, and boil them for ^ of 
an hour. Put them into jars, and keep them in a dry place. 

TO PRESERVE BARBERRIES IN BUNCHES. 

731. — Take the stoneless barberries, reserve the largest 
bunches ; then pick the rest from the stalks, put them into 
as much water as will make a syrup for the bunches, boil them 
until quite soft ; then strain them through a sieve, and to every 
pint of juice put H lb. of loaf-sugar: boil and skim it well. 
To every pint of this syrup put i lb. of barberries in bunches, 
boil them until they look quite clear, and put them into pots 
or glasses. Tie brandy-paper over them. They are only used 
as a garnish for other sweet dishes. 

COMPOSITION SWEETMEAT.-^E. R. 

732. — Take 2 pottles of ripe red gooseberries, 2 of red 

raspberries, 2 of strawberries (the pines are best), and 3 pints 

of ripe red currants ; bruise and mix them together in a deep 

dish, and to every pint of the fruit put i lb. of sugar, pounded 

pretty fine ; then boil it for i an hour, stirring it all the time 

it is on the fire. Cherries may also be added, first taking out 

the stones ; measure them with the other fruit for the weight 

of sugar. 

CURRANT JELL Y. 

733. — Take of red and white currants equal quantities, 
tie them down close in a jar, put them into a kettle of water 
over a slow fire to boil for 2 hours ; strain the liquor through 
a fine sieve, but do not squeeze the currants hard ; then to 
every pint of juice put i lb. of loaf-sugar pounded ; set it 
over a very slow fire until the sugar is dissolved. Do not 
stir it until the scum rises thick enough to be taken off at 
once ; then let it boil up quickly for 20 minutes, or until it 
jellies. 

Currant Jelly without boiling. — Press the juice fipom the 
currants, and make it quite hot, but it must not be allowed to 
boil. To each pint of juice add a full lb. oi V^Xr^w^^sx .^ 



526 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXV. 

pounded very fine, and made quite hot 4n the ovenj and tben 
stirred gradually into the hot juice until it ia ineHed. 

APPLE JELLY. 

734. — Quarter a peck of codlings, put them into a |^ 
serving-pan with the peel of a lemon, a small piece of 
cinnamon, and 6 cloves ; add as much spring water as 
will just cover them. Boil the whole to a pulp, then nm 
them through a flannel bag, and to every pint of juice pat 
i lb. of good loaf-sugar ; boil it hat until it jellies ; then 
pour it into pots or moulds. Aug^ is the best time to make 
this jelly, when the codlings are full-grown, but not ripe. 
Crabs greatly improve thb jelly, and in their absence a little 
lemon-juice. 

Imitations of citron, ginger, and guava jelly, are sometimes 
made in this country, but are always inferior to the original, 
and yet cost quite as much as if purchased at the shops ; we 
therefore look upon such receipts as worthless. 

Jelly may be made of any kind of fruit by putting the 
fruit into a preserving-pan with its own weight of sugar, 
boiling and skimming it until it will jelly ; then poor the whole 
through a new sieve, but do not press it ; take what remains 
in the sieve, and boil it i of an hour for jam, and put the 
juice into another stewpan and boil the same time. This 
method saves the trouble of pressing, and prevents waste. 

ORANGE SYBUP,—E.R, 

735. — Take the largest, deepest coloured, and roughest 
oranges that can be obtained, grate off the rind very nicely, 
and throw the oranges into water : let them remain 12 hours, 
changing the water once during that time, to take out the bitter. 
This, however, although a common practice, is injudicious, 
as the " bitter " of the peel, particularly of SeviDe orange, 
adds the finest flavour to the syrup. Put them into a cloth, 
and boil them ; when tender cut them in quarters, and, after 
taking out the pulp, throw them into cold water ; make a thin 
syrup, clear them in it, after which enrich the syrup, adding 
the pulp ; make it very thick, and pour it over the oranges in 
jars. The white Wedgewood ware are much better thwi the 
common earthen jars. 

CANDIED ORANGE OR LEMON PEEL.—E. R. 

736. — Take the fruit, ewt \\.\<^^ik^S&<^^'c^\nove all the palp 



Chap. XXV.] PRESERVED FRUITS. 527 

and interior skin, then put the peel into strong salt and water 
for 6 days ; then boil them in spring water until they are soft, 
and place them in a sieve to drain ; make a thin syrup with a 
lb. of sugar-candy to a quart of water, boil them in it for i an 
hour, or till they look clear ; make a thick syrup with sugar 
and as much water as will melt it, put in the peel, and boil 
them over a slow fire until the syrup candies in the pan ; then 
take them out, powder pounded sugar over them, and dry them 
before the fire in a cool oven. 

GINGER SYRUP. 

737. — Take a lb. of the best white ginger, break it into 
small pieces, and let it boil in a good quantity of water until 
the water tastes very strongly of the ginger. Then boil any 
sort of solid fruit in the ginger and water until they are nearly 
as tender as would be required for the table ; take them up, 
and lay them in a jar with the ginger and water for 4 or 5 
days, stirring them constantly. Next make a syrup ; to every 
lb. of loaf-sugar put i pint of brandy, the peel of a lenion, 
and the juice of ^ a lemon, with a little of the gingered water. 
When the syrup has been well boiled and the scum removed, 
put the fruit into it, and let it boil for 10 minutes ; then take 
it off the fire, and allow it to remain for a week ; after which 
drain off the syrup, and boil it with additional sugar to make 
it sufficiently rich ; place the fruit in it, and boil 10 or 15 
minutes longer. 

Place them in pots covered with brandy-paper, and they 
will be fit for use in a month. 

COLO URING, to stain Jellies, Ices, ^c, 

738. — For a beautiful red, boil 15 grains of cochineal in 
the finest powder, with H dram of cream of tartar, in i pint 
of water, very slowly for i an hour. Add in boiling a bit of 
alum the size of a pea. Or use beet-root sliced, and some 
liquor poured over. 

For white, use almonds finely pounded, with a little drop 
of water ; or use cream. 

For yellow, yolks of eggs or a bit of safiron steeped in the 
liquor, and squeezed. Likewise the flower of the crocus, 
which has no taste. 

For green, pound spinach-leaves or beet-leaves, express the 
juice, and boil in a teacup in a saucepan of water to take off 
the rawness.

CHAPTER XXVI. 



HCKLES AND FAMILT SAnCE& 

739. — Although meat, when cured and dried, is called 
<< pickled," yet in that operation salt alone is employed as 
brine, while in the pickling of vegetables, of which we are 
about to treat, the means chiefly used is vin^ar. 

In the making of all sorts of pickles, salads, and sauces in 
which vinegar is employed, it is of much importance to have 
it of the strongest quality, as well as of the best flavour, 
of which that only which is made from white wine, and 
usually imported from France, can be called really good. 
Even when brought from thence, unless purchased jfrom a 
very respectable oilman, it will probably be adulterated : the 
fact is, that nothing but the commonest English vinegar, made 
from molasses and stale small beer, is ever to be found in 
the shops of the petty dealers. If, therefore, you like a weU- 
dressed salady never buy any other than real Provence or 
Italian oil, and the best Orleans vinegar. They are certainly 
dearest in price, but are much the best in quality. If the 
flavour of chilis, capsicums, tarragon, eschalots, garlic, or 
any root, is wished to be imparted to the vinegar, it is only 
necessary to put a portion of either (say 1 oz.) into a bottlefol 
of the liquid ; cork it closely, and in a very few weeks it will 
be found thoroughly impregnated with the peculiar taste ; then 
strain it off*, and fill the bottle up again, as it will answer for 
more than once. The flavour of any herb will also be com- 
municated by boiling it for a short time in the acid ; as well as 
a few fruits, the flavour of which is very delicious when im- 
parted to vinegar. 

Pickles should be made at home, as both cheaper and better 
than if bought at oil-shops, where they are invariably made up 
with pyroligneous acid — a species of vinegar which, though 
very strong, has a disagreeable flavour. The pickles should 
be kept either in bottles, or in stone or unglazed jars, as the 
vmegar, or even soured vegetables, will corrode the glazing 
of the jars, which, bemg tiv^^^ ^xqjccl lead^ is poisonous. 



Chap. XXVI.] PICKLES. 529 

Hules to be observed with Pickles, — Avoid as much as pos- 
sible the use of metal vessels in preparing them. Acids dis- 
solve the lead that is in the tinning of saucepans, and corrode 
copper and brass ; consequently, if kept in such for any length 
of time, they become highly poisonous. When it is necessary 
to boil vinegar, do it in a stone jar on a stove. 

Use also wooden spoons and forks. 

See that the pickles are always completely covered with 
vinegar; and if any symptoms appear of their becoming 
mouldy, boil the vinegar again, adding a little more spice. It 
is a good rule to have two-thirds of the jar filled with pickles 
and one-third with vinegar ; keep them also close stopped, as 
exposure to the air makes the pickle soft. 

In greening pickles, keep them closely covered, so that 
none of the steam of the vinegar in which they are boiled be 
allowed to evaporate ; and boil them only for a few minutes, 
or it will take away their strength. 

A very small quantity of alum will make them firm and 
crisp, but too mudi will spoil them. 

TO PICKLE ONIONS. 

740. — Silver Sort, — Choose small button onions, as near of 
a size as possible ; throw them into warm water, which will 
prevent their affecting the eyes so much while peeling them.* 
As they are peeled, throw them into a strong brine of salt 
and water, with a small bit of alum ; let them remain in this 
till the next day, then put them on the fire, and boil them in 
it for a minute. Or, as they are peeled, throw them into 
milk and water ; drain them from this when they are all done, 
put them into a jar, and pour the brine on them boiling hot ; 
cover them close, and set them aside till the next day ; drain, 
and dry them in a cloth ; put them into cold distilled vinegar, 
with a few blades of bruised ginger, some whole pepper, and, 
if approved, a little mace and sliced horseradish ; keep them 
always well covered mth vinegar ; cork the jar close, and put 
it in a cool dry place. 

Fidl-grown Sort, — Peel and slice large onions, and sprinkle 
them with salt. To every gallon take about a dozen cap- 
sicums, either dry or green, slicing only a part ; add a 

* A simple way to prevent this is by putting a crast of bread on the point 
of your knife and occasionally smelling at it. 

2 ^ 



630 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVT. 



few cloves, some pepper and allspice, all whole. Put the 
onions into jars, distribute the spices pretty equally among 
them, fill up the jars with vinegar, and set them in a pan of 
cold water over the fire, taking care that they axe closely tied 
down with a bladder : keep a wet cloth over them to prevent 
the bladder from bursting. In about H hour the onions will 
be soft enough. 

Onions cofid Cucumbers. — To every dozen of cucimibers 
put 3 large onions ; cut both in thick slices, and sprinkle salt 
over them. Next day drain them for 5 or 6 hours, then put 
them into a stone jar, pour boiling vin^ar over them, and 
keep them in a warm place. Repeat the boiling vin^ar, and 
stop them up again instantly, and so on till green ; the last 
time put pepper and ginger ; keep in stone jars. The vinegar 
is very good for winter salads. 

OARLIC PICKLE,— E, R. 

741. — Steep i lb. of ginger in strong salt and water for 5 
days, then cut it into slices and dry it in the sun ; put it into 
a large stone jar with a gallon of the best white-wine vinegar. 
Peel 1 lb. of garlic, salt it well, and let it stand in the salt 3 
days ; wipe it, and dry it in the sun, then put it into the 
pickle ; add also i lb. of long pepper steeped in salt and water 
and well dried, 1 lb. of mustard-seed bruised, and i lb. of tur- 
meric. Shake these ingredients well in the jar, and add any- 
thing that it is desirable to pickle as it comes into season, salt- 
ing and drying them previously in the sun. When completed, 
the pickle should be kept a year or two before it is used. 

Shalots may be pickled in the same way ; or if put, as we 
have already stated, in a bottle of cold vinegar, their flavour 
will be imparted to it in the course of a month. 

CUCUMBERS, 

742. — If fall-grown^ the small long sort are the best for pick- 
ling. Let them be fresh-gathered ; pull off the blossoms, but 
do not rub them ; pour over them a strong brine of salt and 
water boiling hot, cover them close, and let them stand all 
night. The next day stir them gently to take off the sand, drain 
them on a sieve, and dry them on a cloth ; make a pickle with 
the best white-wine vinegar, ginger, pepper (long and round), 
and a little garlic. Wh^u the pickle boils throw in the.cu- 



Ghap. XXVI.] PICKLES. 531 



cumbers, cover them, and make them boil as quickly as pos- 
sible for 3 or 4 minutes ; put them into a jar with the vinegar, 
and cover them closely ; when cold, put in a sprig of dill, the 
seed downward. They will be exceedingly crisp and green 
done in this manner ; but if they do not appear to be of a fine 
colour, boil up the pickle the next day, and pour it boiling on 
the cucumbers. 

To pickle Gherkins. — Choose nice young ones, spread them 
on dishes, salt them, and let them lie a week, with a small bit 
of alum ; then drain them, and, putting them in a jar, pour 
boiling vinegar over them. Set them near the fire, covered 
with plenty of vine-leaves ; if they do not become a tolerably 
good green, pour the vinegar into another jar, set it over the 
hot hearth, and when it becomes too hot to bear your hand, 
but still not to boil, pour it over them again, covering with 
fresh leaves ; and thus do till they are of as good a colour as 
you wish. As an additional reason for preparing them at 
home, it is indeed well known that the very fine green pickles 
are made so by the dealers using brass or bell-metal vessels, 
which, when vinegar is put into them, become highly poisonous. 

If spices be not mixed among the pickle, put into the kettle 
in a thin muslin bag allspice, mace, and mustard-seed, to every 
quart of vinegar in the proportion of rather less than i oz. 
each of the former to 1 oz. of the seed. 

MUSHROOMS.— E. R. 

743. — To pickle Mushrooms White, — Take the very small 
buttons, clean and rub them with a flannel, then put them into 
cold distilled vinegar, and allow it to come to a boil very 
slowly ; drain and lay them in a cloth till cold, and then put 
them into fresh distilled vinegar. If very small they should 
not be allowed to boil, as so strong a heat might destroy them. 
It will therefore be sufficient to warm them ; and when dried, 
they may be again put into the vinegar in which they had 
been originally placed, after it has been cooled. As to spice, 
a little mace will improve their flavour, but no hot pepper 
should be used. Those which are red underneath may also be 
used ; but those which are black are too old, and only fit for 
broiling or to make ketchup. 

To pickle Mushrooms Brown, — Choose them older, but see 
that they be fresh, and of a nearly pink colour underneatJkL\ 



5S2 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Gkap. XXVI. 

clean, and sprinkle them with salt, pat than in layers, and 
let them stand for a couple of days ; thai add some irbok 
pepper, cover them very close, and put than into an oven 
when bread is baking. That done, take than out, strain off 
the liquor, into which put cloves, maoe, and all^oe, and let 
the whole boil for a litde while. While that is doii^, pot the 
mushrooms into the stewpan for a short time, then take the 
whole off the fire, and when perfectly cold pot them, with the 
addition of a little vinegar. 

An excellent way to preserve the fiavour of fnuskroom 
when being pickled is to rub them with a bit of flannel and 
salt, and from the larger take out the red in^de : when they 
are black they will not do, being too old. Throw a little salt 
over, and put them into a stewpan with some mace ; as the 
liquor comes out, shake them well, and keep than over a 
g^tle fire till all of it be dried into them again ; then put as 
much vinegar into the pan as will cover diem, give it one 
warm, and turn all into a glass or stone jar. They will keep 
2 years, and are delicious. 

MUSHROOM POWDER. 

744. — Wash ^ peck of large mushrooms while quite firesh, 
and free them from dirt and grit with flannel ; scrape out the 
black pcirt clean, and do not use any that are wormeaten; 
put them into a stewpan over the fire without water, with 2 
large onions, some cloves, i oz. of mace, and 2 spoonfuls of 
white pepper, all in powder ; simmer and shake them till all 
the liquor be dried up, but be careful they do not burn. Lay 
them on tins or sieves, in a slow oven, till they are dry enough 
to beat to powder ; then put the powder in small bottles 
corked and tied closely, and keep in a dry place. 

A teaspoonful will give a very fine flavour to any soup or 
gravy, or any sauce. It is to be added just before serving, 
and 1 boil given to it afler it is put in. 

TO PICKLE WALNUTS. 

745. — Gather the walnuts about the middle of July, and 
put them in salt and water ; prick each with a needle seve- 
ral times; let them stand 2 or 3 days, changing the water 
every day. Make a brine of salt and water strong enough 
to bear an eg^-, it must be quite cold before being used, 
and be well gkimmed ^hile boiling. To every 100 walnuts 



Chap. XXVI.] PICKLES. 533 

allow 1 gallon of water. Let the walnuts soak 6 days, then 
change the brine, and let them stand 6 more; then drain 
them, and expose them to the sun that they may turn black ; 
pour over them, in a jar, a pickle of the best white-wine, 
vinegar, with a good quantity of pepper, pimento, ginger, 
mace, cloves, mustard-seed, and horseradish, all boiled to- 
gether, but cold. To every 100 walnuts allow 6 spoonfuls of 
mustard-seed, with 1 oz. of whole black pepper, and 2 or 3 
heads of garlic or shalot, but the latter is least strong ; let 
them be quite covered with vinegar. This done, they will be 
good for several years, if closely covered. The air will soften 
Qiem. They will not, however, be fit to eat under 6 months. 

TO PICKLE RADISH-PODS.— E. R. 

746. — Gather the radish-pods when they are quite young, 
and put them into salt and water all night ; then boil the salt 
and water, and pour it over the pods in jars, and cover them 
closely to keep in the steam. When the brine is cold boil it, 
and pour it hot upon the pods again, repeating the process 
until they are green ; then put them in a sieve to drain, and 
make a pickle for them of white-wine Vinegar, mace, ginger, 
long pepper, and horseradish ; pour it . boiling hot upon the 
pods, and when nearly cold boil it again, and pour it over 
them. When cold, tie down the jars. 

TO PICKLE FRENCH BEANS, 

747. — Gather them before they become stringy, and, with- 
out taking off the e^pds, put them into a very strong brine until 
they become yellow ; drain the liquor from them, and wipe 
them dry with a cloth. Put them into a stone jar by the fire, 
put in a little bit of alum, and pour boiling vinegar upon them 
every 24 hours, preventing the escape of the steam. In 4 or 
5 days they will become green. Boil a little mace, whole 
pepper, and ginger in the vinegar. 

Do samphire the same way. 

BARBERRIES, pickled in Brine.— E. R. 

748. — Gather the barberries before they are too ripe, pick 
out the leaves and dead stalks, put them into jars, with a 
large quantity of strong salt and water, and tie them down 
with bladders ; when any scum arises put the barberries in 



584 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVI. 

fresh salt and water ; they will not require vinegar, their own 
acid being sufficient. 

Or, if imported Jrom abroad, and consequently old, pick 
out all the loose barberries, and lay aside the bunches. Make 
a brine of salt and water strong enough to bear an egg. To 
2 quarts of brine put in 1 pint of white-wine vinegar and 
i lb. of brown sugar ; boil all together with the loose bar- 
berries, and let it stand till it is cold. They must not boil 
long. Strain this liquor, pour it upon the bunches of bar^ 
berries, and tie them up closely in the jars. 

I^ASTURTIUMS 

749. — So much resemble capers, both in flavour and the 
mode of pickling, as to be frequently used in the same man- 
ner ; the seeds should be allowed to get ripe after the buds 
and flowers have gone off. Gather them upon a dry day, 
and keep them for a few days after they have been gathered ; 
put them into a jar, and pour boiling vinegar well spiced upon 
them ; when cold, cover the jar. They will not be fit for use 
for some months, but will be finely flavoured after keeping, 
and are sometimes preferred to capers, for which they are an 
excellent substitute, l^ing useful also in serving up all dishes 
in which pickles are warmed with the gravy. Y"oung red 
capsicums and elder-flowers before they open may be done in 
the same way. 

TO FICKLE RED CABBA GE, 

760. — Take those of a deep red or pur{fle colour, strip off 
the outer leaves and cut out the stalk ; quarter the cabbage 
lengthwise and cut it crosswise, but not in very thin slices ; 
put it into a sieve and sprinkle it with salt and saltpetre ; let 
it drain for 24 hours, then squeeze it until it is very dry ; make 
a pickle with sufficient vinegar to cover the cabbages well, 
and made with equal quantities of cloves and allspice, with a 
little mace — to be put in whole, to which if a very small 
quantity of cochineal be added, it will greatly improve the 
colour ; boil the vinegar and spices together for full 5 minutes, 
and strain it ; then, having put the cabbage into a stone jar, 
pour the vinegar over it boiling hot. 

This is opposed to the practice of some persons, who object 
to boiling the vinegar, awdi ^^owt \\. ^old ui^on the cabbage. 



Chap. XXVI.] PICKLES. 535 



TO PICKLE CAULIFLOWERS. 

751. — Cut them before they are too much blown, and upon 
a dry day; strip off the leaves, and quarter the stalk; scald 
them in salt and water, but do not allow them to boil ; then 
lay them to cool, covering them that they may not lose their 
colour; sprinkle them with salt and water; put them on a 
colander for 24 hours to drain. When dry, cut out the thick 
stalk, or, if it be large, divide it, give it a boil, and split the 
flower into 8 or 10 pieces ; then put them carefully into jars, 
and cover them with cold vinegar which has been previously 
boiled with spices ; or the caidiflowers may have 1 boil in salt 
and vin^ar, and be taken out immediately, and put into cold 
vinegar previously boiled with spices — 2 oz. each of coriander- 
seed and turmeric, 1 oz. each of mustard-seed and ginger, with 
i oz. each of mace and nutmeg, or cinnamon, to every 3 quarts 
of vinegar ; the spices may, however, be varied. 

Brocoli and the tops of asparagus may be pickled in the same 
manner. 

TO PICKLE TOM A TAS. 

752. — For this purpose the small round ones are the best, 
and each should be pricked with a fork, to allow some pf 
the juice to exude, but keep it for the pickle. Put them into 
a deep earthen vessel, sprinkle salt between every layer, and 
leave them there for 3 days covered ; then wash off the salt, 
and cover them with a pickle of cold vinegar, to which add the 
juice, mixed with a large handfid of mustard-seed and 1 oz. 
each of cloves and white pepper, as being generally sufficient 
for 1 peck of fruit. It makes an excellent sauce for roast 
meat, and will be ready in about a fortnight. 

In America it is sometimes mixed up with layers of thinly- 
sliced onions ; and chopped celery is a good addition, either 
with or without onions. 

TO PICKLE LEMONS, 

753. — Take the finest with the thickest rind you can ^et, cut 
them deeply from end to end in more than one place, but not 
quite through, and fill the incisions with salt ; put each on 
end, and lay them in a dish near the fire, or in the sun if the 
weather be hot, to dissolve the salt, and repeat this during 
3 weeks ; then put them into a jar, with a handful of white 
mustard-seed if it be large, i to i lb. of \«^tta«i ^i5v%^^^ 



SS6 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Crap. XX?I. 

half that quantity of cloves and allspice, a few chilis, and 
a very little turmeric ; boil in vinegar, and pour it upaa tbe 
lemons when cold. It was originally prepaied by the cook of 
the first Earl of Orfbrd. 

Some people, however, add to it either shalot or garlic. It 
can hardly be ready in less than 6 months, but will keep ht 
many years. 

For limesy or very small lemons, the same method must be 
pursued, only they will not require above half the time. 

: LEMON FICKLE. 

754. — Peel 6 large lemons ; cut them in quarters, lay them 
on a dish, and strew over them i lb. of salty turning them 
every day for a week. Then put them into a stone jar; 
add 6 large cloves of garlic, 2 oz. of horseradish shred 
very thin ; of cloves, mace, nutmeg, and cayenne each i ok. ; 
2 oz. of mustard-seeds, bruised and tied up in a bit of thin 
muslin, and 2 quarts of the best vinegar. Cover the jar and 
set it in a pan of boiling water; let it boil 10 minutes, 
then set it in the oven, or anywhere that it may simmer gently, 
for 2 hours. Keep the jar closely covered, stirring it every 
day for 6 weeks, and when settled strain it and bottle for use. 
Another quart of vinegar may be added to the ingredients, 
and boiled up, which will make a very good pickle for conunon 
purposes, or the lemons may be added to any mixed pickles. 

MANGOES. 

765. — Although any melon may be used before it is quite ' 
ripe, yet there is a particular sort for this purpose, which the 
gardeners know, and should be mangoed soon after they are 
gathered. Cut a small piece out of one end, through that 
take out the seeds, and mix with them mustard-seed and shred 
garlic ; stuff the melon as full as the space will allow, and 
replace the cut piece. Bind it up with packthread. To allow 
for wasting, boil a good quantity of vinegar, with pepper, salt, 
ginger, and any of the sweet spices ; then pour it boiling-hot 
over the mangoes during 4 successive days ; and on the last, 
put flour of mustard and scraped horseradish into the vinegar, 
just as it boils up. Stop close. Observe that there be plenty 
of vinegar, as pickles are spoiled if not well covered. Large 
cucumbers, called "green turley," prepared in the same way, 
are excellent, and axe aoonet ^\. Xa'^ ^ax&w. 



Chap. XXVI.] PICKLES. 537 

The greater number of times boiliug vinegar is poured over 
either sort, the sooner it will be ready. 

MIXED PICKLE,— E, R, 

766. — ^To 1 gallon of vinegar put 4 oz. of ginger bruised, 

2 oz. of white pepper, 2 of allspice, 2 of chilis, 4 of 
turmeric, 1 lb. of mustard-seed, i lb. of shalots, 1 oz. of 
garlic, and i lb. of bay-salt. Boil all together except the 
mustard-seed, which must be added aflerwards. Then mix 
very smoothly i lb. of made mttstard with some of the 
vinegar, when cold, in a basin, and add it to the remainder 
with the seed. Take brocoli, radish-pods, French beans, or 
any other vegetables or small fruit ; blanch the vegetables, 
lay them on a sieve, and sprinkle a little salt over them to 
draw out the water. Let them stand in the sun till very dry, 
then pour the vinegar boiling over them, slicing in some 
horseradish if approved. 

Pickle of tlus kind can be rendered hot at pleasure, by 
additions of chilis, green and red capsicums — which, when 
gathered young, add exquisite flavour — and all sorts of foreign 
peppers. As the spring advances, a portion of every small 
root produced in a garden, if collected and thrown into cold 
vinegar, till it can be conveniently made into a regular pickle, 
will be found most excellent, at no greater expense than the 
cost of the spice and vinegar, and the trouble of mixing it. 

INDIA PICKLE— E, R, 

767. — Is made in nearly the same manner. Put 200 gherkins, 

3 pints of small onions, 1 quart of nasturtiums, 1 ditto of radish- 
pods, 1 quartern of French beans, 6 cauliflowers, and 2 hard 
white cabbages sliced, into a pan, and sprinkle them with salt, 
the onions having been previously peeled and laid in salt and 
water for a week to take off their strength. Then, after a 
day or two, take them out of the pan and dry them thoroughly 
in a warm place in the shade : they must be spread out sepa- 
rately. To 2 gallons of vinegar put li oz. of allspice, the 
same of long pepper and of white, and 2 of ginger, tied up in 
muslin bags. When cold, mix with the vinegar 1 J lb. of 
flour of mustard, and 2 tablespoonfuls of cayenne pepper. 
Boil it well together, and pour it on the pickle : the v^e- 
tables mentioned, not being all procurable at tibk!^ ^axa^ >ssfiL<&^ 



538 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVT. 

. • 

may be added separately, at different periods, but they must 
all undergo the salting and drying process. 

In choosing those vegetables some discrimination may also 
be used : when in season, few things add a higher flavour to 
the pickle than the buds and flowers of the elder. 

India Pickle may also be made thus : — Peel, slice, and salt 
1 lb. of garlic ; then put it during 3 days in the sun to dry. 
Salt and dry long pepper in the same way. Lay 1 lb. of 
white ginger in water 1 night ; then scrape, slice, and lay it 
in salt in a pan till the other ingredients shall be ready. 

Prepare various v^etables thus : — 

Quarter small white cabbages, salt 3 days, squeeze, and set 
them in the sun to dry. Cut cauliflowers in their branches ; 
take off the green from radishes ; cut celery in 3-inch lengths ; 
ditto young French beans whole, after being stringed ; like- 
wise shoots of elder, which look like bamboo. Apples and 
cucumbers, choose of the least seedy sort ; cut them in slices, 
or quarters if not too large. All must be salted, drained, and 
dried in the sun, except the latter, over whidi you must pour 
boiling vinegar, and in 12 hours drain them, but no salt must 
be used. 

Put the spice, garlic, i lb. of mustard-seed, and as much 
vin^ar as you think enough for the quantity you are to pickle, 
into a large stone jar, and 1 oz. of turmeric to be ready against 
the vegetables shall be dried. When they are r^idy, put 
some of them into a 2-quart stone jar, and pour over them 1 
quart of boiling vinegar. Next day take out those vegeta- 
bles ; and, when drained, put them into a large stock-jar, and, 
boiling the vinegar, pour it over some more of the vegetables : 
let them lie a night, and do as above. Thus proceed till you 
liave cleansed each set from the dust which must inevitably 
fall on them by being so long in doing ; then, to every gallon 
of vinegar put 2 oz. of flour of mustard, mixing, by degrees, 
with a little of it boiling-hot. The whole of the vinegar 
should have been previously scalded, but set to be cool before 
it was put to the spice. Stop the jar tight. 

This pickle will not be ready for a year ; but you may 
make a small jar to be ready in a fortnight, by giving the 
cauliflower one scald in water, after salting and drying as 
above, but without the preparative vinegar; then pour the 
vinegar, that has the spice and garlic, boiling-hot over. If at 
any time it be found that VSaa \e^'fc\2iX^'^>cffiN^\iQt swelled pro-. 



Chap. XXVI.] PICKLES. 639 

perly, boiling the pickle, and pouring it over them hot, will 
plump them. 

JRoots^ such as carrots^ salsifis, scorzofiera, and beetroot 
may be pickled by being sliced, or cut into small pieces, and 
slightly boiled in vinegar without destroying their crispness, 
and adding the common spices; with beetroot put button 
onions, or cut some Spanish onions in slices, lay them alter- 
nately in a jar ; boil 1 quart of vinegar with 1 oz. of mixed 
pepper, i oz. of ginger, and some salt, and pour it cold over 
the beetroot and onions. 

VINEGARS, 

766. — Vinegar for India Pickle, — Prepare a gallon of vine- 
gar, more or less, according to the quantity of pickles to be 
done, in the following manner : — Mix gradually i lb. of the best 
flour of mustard, and 2 oz. of powdered turmeric, with some 
of the cold vinegar at first, to ensure its being properly mixed ; 
then add the rest, with i lb. of white mustard-seed. Bruise 
i lb. of ginger, 2 oz. of white pepper, and I oz. of chilis, 
and tie them in a muslin bag. Boil the whole gently for 20 
minutes or i an hour, and pour it whilst boiling on the pickles, 
having previously drained off the vinegar they were first put 
in. In 10 or 12 days repeat the boiling, pour it over the 
pickles whilst boiling hot, and they will be r^uiy for use when 
cold. 

Walnut Vinegar. — ^Put green walnut-shells into a brine of 
salt and water strong enough to float an egg; let them lie 
covered in this 10 or 12 days ; take them out, and lay them 
in the sun for a week ; put them into a jar, and pour boiling 
vinegar on them ; in about a week or 10 days pour off the 
vinegar, make it boiling hot, and pour over them again. In 
a month it will be fit for use, and will be found excellent to 
eat with cold meat, and particularly useful in making sauces. 

Cucumber Vinegar, — Pare and slice 15 large cucumbers, 
and put them in a stone jar, with 3 pints of vinegar, 4 large 
onions sliced, 2 or 3 shalots, a little garlic, 2 large spoonfuls 
of salt, 3 teaspoonfuls of pepper, and i a teaspoonful of cay- 
enne. After standing 4 days, give the whole a boil : when 
cold, strain, and filter the liquor through paper. 

Camp Vinegar, — Slice a large head of garlic, and put it 
into a wide-mouthed bottle, with i oz. of cayenne, 2 tea.- 



540 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVI. 

spoonfuls of real soy, 2 of walnut-ketchup, 4 anchoyies 
chopped, 1 pint of vinegar, and enough cochineal to give it 
the colour of lavender-drops. Let it stand 6 weeks ; then 
strain off quite dear, and keep in small bottles sealed up. 

Another. — ^Infuse in a quart of the best white-wine vine- 
gar i pint of walnut-ketchup, the same quantity of mush- 
room-ketchup, and also the same quantity of soy, ^ oz. <^ 
cayenne, 4 heads of garlic, 10 shalots, 2 oz. of black and 
2 oz. of white pepper, the same quantity of pimento and 
g^ger, 1 oz. of nutmeg, 3 blades of mace, and 10 doves, 
in a wide-mouthed 2-quart bottle ; and cover very closely 
with cork, leather, and bladder. Let it remain near the fire 
a month, shaking it frequently. When any is taken out, pat 
in as much fresh vinegar. This is not oolj a very fine sauce, 
but a gpreat preservative against infectious diseases, if taken 
freely. 

Nasturtium Vinegar. — ^Pick full-blown nasturtium flowers; 
fill a wide-mouthed bottle with them ; add ^ a dove of garlic 
and a moderate-sized shalot chopped ; pour as much vin^ar as 
the bottle will take ; in 2 months' time rub the whole through 
a fine sieve ; add a little ciyenne pepper and salt. 

Tarragon and Elder-flower Vinegar, — Take either the 
young leaves of tarragon when the plant is goin^ into bloom, 
or the buds of elder-flowers, and to every i peck put 1 gallon 
of vinegar, leaving it for a fortnight in a jug to ferment 
Then drain it through a flannel bag, put into it a small bit 
of dissolved isinglass, and bottle it. 

The flavour of the herbs m;iy also be extracted by boiling 
the buds or leaves in vinegar, without fermentation : a mix- 
ture of both is very agreeable. 

Raspberry Vinegar. — To 1 quart of common vinegar put 
2 quarts of fresh raspberries, let them stand 24 hours ; then 
drain them off, but do not squeeze them. Put in 2 quarts 
more, let them stand as before, and this must be repeated a 
third time. After which, put the vinegar into a jar, measure 
it, and to every pint put 1 lb. of lump-sugar. Set the jar up 
to the neck in boiling water, and let the vinegar boil for 10 
minutes, stirring it frequently. There should on no account 
be fewer raspberries than the proportion mentioned, and the 
vinegar will not be fit for use until the following summer. 

Gooseberry Vinegar.— ^oW s^tov^ ^^\R3t% ajid when cold. 



Chap. XXVL] FAMILY SAUCES. 541 

put to every 3 quarts 1 quart of bruised gooseberries in a 
large tub. Let them remain 60 hours, stirring often ; then 
strain through a hair bag, and to each gedlon of liquor add 1 
lb. of the coarsest sugar. Put it into a barrel, and a toast and 
yeast ; cover the bung-hole with a bit of slate. Set the barrel 
in the sun, observing that the cask be well painted, and the 
iron hoops all firm. The greater the quantity of sugar and 
fruit the stronger the vinegar ; and as this is particularly use- 
ful for pickles, it might be well to make it of double the 
strength for that purpose. 

Chili Vinegar. — Fill a bottle with the chilis or capsi- 
cums — each of which will impart the proper warmth of 
flavour — and cover them with vinegar ; cork it up closely, let 
it stand for 3 weeks or a month, then pour off the vinegar, 
and fill up the bottle again : chilis are the most commonly 
used, but good capsicums will flavour several additions of 
vinegar. If capsicums are not procurable, put 1 oz. of cayenne 
pepper to a quart of vinegar, and let it stand some time, 
shaking it occasionally. Then strain it off, and fill the bottle 
up again. 

LEMO^ FLAVOURING FOR PUDDINGS. 

769. — Peel 6 lemons very .thin indeed ; put the peel into a 
glass bottle, and add a table^poonful of bitter almonds, 
blanched, or the same quantity of peach or apricot kernels. 
Cover the whole with brandy ; shake it frequently, and in 
a month strain it, and if kept closely corked it will keep for 
years. 

MUSHROOM KETCHUP.— E. R. 

760. — Take the full-grown flaps of fireshly-gathered mush- 
rooms, crush them with the hands, throw a handful of salt 
into every peck, and let them stand a night or two ; then put 
them into pans, and set them in a quick oven for 12 hours; 
strain them through a hair sieve, and press out all the juice. 
To every gallon of liquor put of cloves, Jamaica and black 
pepper, and ginger, 1 oz. each, and i lb. of common salt. Set 
it on a slow fire, and let it boil until half the liquor is wasted ; 
then put it into another vessel, and, when cold, strain and 
bottle it ; at the same time corking it up closely, and covering 
the cork with oiled paper. 

Or : — Take the largest broad mushrooia&, \K^ak ^«n\. Vsj^isi 



54d MODERN DOMESTIC GOOKEBY. [C^u^. Tm. 

an earthen pan, strew salt over, and stir them now and then 
for several days, till there is a thick scam over : strain, and 
boil the liquor with Jamaica and black pq^pers, mace, ginga>, 
a clove or two, and some mustard-seed. Oayemie pepper is too 
hot, but a very little chili vinegar is an improvonent. Whea 
cold, bottle it, and secure the coiics as above, leaving the spiee 
in* At the end of 3 months strain the liquor and boil with 
fresh spice, which put into the bottles ; and in a cool place it 
will keep 2 or 3 years. 

Or : — ^Take a stewpan full of the large flap mushrooms 
that are not wormeaten, and the skins and j&inge of those you 
have pickled : throw a handful of salt among than, and set 
them for a few days in a warm room, stirring them occaaon* 
ally. They will produce a great deal of liquor, to which you 
must put 4 oz. of shalots, 2 cloves of gariie, a good deal of 
pepper, ginger, mace, cloves, and a few bay-leaves, with a 
stick of horseradish ; boil slowly, and skim very welL Wh^ 
cold, put the whole in a cask without straining, but bung it 
close up. In 2 months boil it up again with a little fresh 
spice ; then strain it through a flannel bag, but boil what re* 
mains in it with a small quantity of strong beer ; when 
strained, either add this to the former, or bottle it separately. 
It should be kept for some months before being used, but re- 
mains good for a long time, which mushroom-ketchup rarely 
does, if not boiled a second time. 

To all these receipts we strongly recommend the addition of 
a moderate quantity of port wine — fix>m i pint to not quite a 
pint to every 4 quarts — both as greatly improving the flavour 
of the ketchup and ensuring its better preservation. 

With regsud to the spice^ care should be taken not to allow 
it to overpower the natural flavour of the v^etable. 

WALNUT KETCHUP.— JE, R. 

761. — ^Take 200 walnuts at the season for pickling, beat 
them very small on a marble mortar, add about 6 handfuls of 
salt ; put them into a clean earthen pan, and stir them 2 or 3 
times a day for 10 days or a fortnight. Then strain than 
through a cloth, pressing them very dry. Then boil up the 
liquor with mace, cloves, sliced nutm^, and whole pepper. 
When nearly done, add 6 cloves of shalot ; bottle and cork it 
cloady. The bottle sViovM b^ shaken when the ketchup is 
med. 



Chap. XXVI.] FAMILY SAUCES. 543 

Or : — Take the green shells of ripe walnuts ; to each peck add 
1 lb. of common or bay salt, pounded fine ; stir well together, 
and let them remain for 3 or 4 days, stirring them occasionally 
that the air may turn them black ; then boil a gallon of water 
with 1 lb. of bay salt, and pour over the shells boiling hot ; 
let them stand 8 or 10 days, and pour off the liquor. Boil 
well 1 hour, adding, towards the last, 2 oz. of long pepper, 
the same of black, 2 oz. of shalots cut small, 2 oz. of brown 
mustard-seed bruised, i oz. of mace and cloves, ^ pint of 
vinegar, and i lb. of good anchovies. Pour into a jar or cask, 
and in 2 or 3 months strain and bottle. 

Walnut- Ketchup 'of the finest quality, — Boil or . simmer a 
gallon of the expressed juice of walnuts when they are tender, 
and skim it well ; then put in 2 lbs. of anchovies, bones, 
and liquor, ditto of shalots, 1 oz. of cloves, ditto of mace, 
ditto of pepper, and 1 clove of garlic. Let all simmer till the 
shalots sink ; then put the liquor into a pan till cold ; bottle 
and divide the spice to each. Cork closely, tie the bladder 
over, and put it in small bottles. 

It will keep 20 years in the greatest perfection, but is not 
fit for use the first year. Be very careful to express the juice 
at home, for it is generally adulterated if bought. 

Irish mode: — Take a few hundred green walnuts, scoop 
out all the whites, beat them in a mortar, and strain the 
juice through a cloth ; let it stand a day and night, strain it, 
and pour it off clear. To 1 pint of this liquor put i pint of 
vinegar with i lb. of anchovies, and to each pint thus made 
a clove or two of garlic, 2 or 3 shalots, some horseradish, and 
1 onion cut in quarters ; boil it 2 hours, and then strain it off. 
When strained add to every pint of liquor half i oz. of 
mace, the same quantity of cloves, of nutmeg, and of whole 
black pepper, i pint of port wine, and 2 tablespoonfuls of 
soy. Boil them together for i an hour. Then pour it off 
into an earthen jar, and let it remain covered until it is cold ; 
bottle it off into clean dry bottles, distributing the spice equally 
in each ; cork it down closely ; take care in boiling to keep 
the saucepan covered. 

CUCUMBER KETCHUP— E. R. 

762. — Take an equal quantity of large cucumbers and large 
onions, pare and slice them ; throw over them a handful of 
salt, and let them stand all night in a sieve ^Aa^^^^ qn^t ^^^ssv. 



544 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXYL 

Take the liquor and boil it up, with i lb. of anchovies to every 
dozen of cucumbers, I pint of white wine, a nutnoieg, i oz. of 
mace, and 4 oz. of whole pepper ; strain it, and when cold 
bottle it ; tie it down with bladder. It will keep for 2 yean. 

The Suffolk Receipt, — ^Take a dozen well-grown cucum- 
bers and 4 large onions, slice them into an earthen pan with 
a good handful of salt ; let them stand till the liquor b^ins to 
run, break them into small pieces, and let the whole stand an- 
other day and night : then strain it off; to every quart put the 
same quantity of white, but not sweet wine, 4 lb. of andiovies, 
and a large stick of horseradish ; boil them together for i an 
hour, then strain it again, and to every quart put ^ oz. of white 
pepper, ^ the quantity of mace and nutmeg, all pounded, and 
boil it well again. When cold, bottle it with the spice, and put a 
piece of ginger into each bottle. A tablespoon^ in a sauce- 
boatful of cream or melted butter makes delicious white sauce 
for fowls or made dishes of veal. 

TOMATA KETCHUP,— E. R. 

763. — ^Take 2 dozen of ripe tomatas and a handful of salt ; 
slice the tomatas, and put a layer into a jar, sprinkle salt over 
it, then another layer of tomatas and salt, until the jar is full. 
Stir the contents now and then for 3 or 4 days, keeping the 
jar in a warm place by the fire ; at the expiration of which 
time press the juice from the tomatas by rubbing them with a 
wooden spoon through a sieve, and boil it with mace, pepper, 
allspice, ginger, and cloves, in the proportion of about 2 oz. in 
all to 1 quart of juice, a few blades of mace, 12 cloves, a 
spoonful of pounded ginger, and the remainder pepper and all- 
spice. In 3 months boil it again with fresh spice. 

Or : — Take 6 lbs. of tomatas, sprinkle them with salt ; let 
them remain for a day or two, then boil them until the skins 
will separate easily ; pour them into a colander, or coarse sieve, 
and press them through, leaving the skins behind ; put into the 
liquor 1 handful of shalots, 1 pint of chili vinegar, i pint 
of wine, pepper, cloves, ginger, and allspice ; boil them toge- 
ther until a third part has wasted ; then bottle it, closing the 
bottle very securely. It must be shaken before it is used.

I oz. of mace in powder. Slice them into a well-tinned sauce- 
pan, mixing the seasoning with them as they are cut up ; boil, 
keeping them well stirred; when thoroughly soft, drain off 
the water, and rub through a hair sieve. Boil it again until 
it is as thick as apple-sauce. Put it into bottles, and cork 
close. Put the bottles into a stewpan, fill it with cold water, 
let it boil for 20 minutes. Keep in a cool place. Examine 
the bottles occasionally, and if there is the least indication of 
a change turn it into the kettle again, boil, and scum it, keep- 
ing it well stirred from the bottom that it may not adhere,* 
and put it into the bottles again. When required for use, 
warm what is wanted with a little gravy. It is as nice as 
when firesh done, and will be found excellent with calf s head 
or brains, veal, beef, mutton, pork, or goose. An onion or a 
shalot, boiled in the gravy with which it is mixed, will be an 
improvement. 

CAMP KETCHUP. 

766. — Take 2 quarts of old strong beer and 1 of white wine, 
add i lb. of anchovies, 3 oz. of shalots peeled, i oz. of mace, 
the same of nutmeg, 3 large races of ginger cut in slices ; put 
all together over a moderate fire till one third is wasted. The' 
next day bottle it with the spice and the shalots. It will keep 
for many years. 

Or: — A pint of claret, the same quantity of ketchup, 4 oz. 
of anchovies, 1 oz. of fresh lemon-peel pared thin, 2 cloves of 
garlic minced fine, i oz. of allspice, the same of black and of 
red pepper, 1 drachm of celery-seed bruised, and i pint of 
pickle-liquor. Put these ingredients into a wide-mouthed 
bottle ; stop it close, shake it every day for a fortnight, and 
then strain it off. 

SEVEN-YEARS KETCHUP. 

766. — ^Take 2 quarts of the oldest strong beer, put to it 1 
quart of red wine, 1 lb. of anchovies, 3 oz. of shalots peeled, 
i oz. of mace, the same of nutmegs, ioz. of cloves, 3 large 
races of ginger cut in slices, and boil all together over a mo- 
derate fire till one-third is wasted. When quite cold put it 
into a large jar, covered up, and leave it there for a week or 
two until the sediment is wasted, and the clear liquor is per^ 
fectly transparent ; then strain it through a fine hair sieve, 
taste it, and add to it a little of any essence of spice, oil, or 
vinegar, which you think may improve it, and, if the l\g^<i\^

not lucidly clear, give it 1 smart boil : let it rest till oool, and 
bottle it in very small bottles to prevent its frequent exposure 
to the air. 

It will improve by age, and may be carried on a Toyage 
round the world. As may also 

Sauce a la Militaire, made thus : — Put into an earthen pot 6 
shalots sliced, a clove of garlic split, 2 laurel-leaves, a handful 
of thyme, basil, and tarragon-leaves, i oz. of mustard-seed 
bruised, 1 teaspoonful of grated Seville orange-peel, i oz. of 
cloves, the same quantity of mace, i oz. of long -pepper, 
2 oz. of salt, the juice of a lemon, 6 spoonfuls of the strongest 
vinegar, and i pint of white wine. Stop the pot very cloi^y, 
and put it into an oven, or upon hot ashes, for 24 hours, to allow 
the whole to infuse properly. Then allow it to settle, and strain 
it until it is quite clear : bottle it, and close the bottles tightly : 
a very small quantity will be sufficient, and it may. be used with 
all sorts of meat, game, or fish. 

ARTIFICIAL SAUCES FOR FISH. 

767. — Those most commonly used in England are soy and 
anchovy, merely mixed from the cruets into melted butter by 
each individual of the company ; the butter, when brought to 
table in a prepared state, should be made as follows : — 

F'or Anchovy Sauce, the foundation should be some of the 
fish stock or gravy which has been already made and kept in 
the house for future use. Take 2 or 3 anchovies, scrape, 
but do not wash them, and boil them along with a minced 
shalot in some of the gravy, until they are soft enough to 
be pounded to a paste. Then strain the gravy and thicken 
it with the body of the fish, after having removed the heads, 
tails, and bones. When that is done, put it, for about i of 
an hour, in the stewpan along with a glass of red wine, a 
squeeze of lemon, and the necessary quantity of butter. 

The common mode is, to chop 3 anchovies, melt i lb. of 
butter in a teacupful of the water in which the fish is boiled, 
add a spoonful of vin^ar, and a little flour. Stir it well over 
the fire until it is quite thick. 

Or : — Not unfirequently 2 or 3 spoonfuls of the prepared 
essence of anchovy are put into the melted butter, seasoned 
with a little cayenne pepper. 

The savoury store sauces for fish, as prepared and sold in 
the shops, are aH to a ceiV&m ^^^^^j^eeable to some palates. 



Chap. XXVI.] FAMILY SAUCES. 547 

but anchovy and soy seem the prevailing sort for fish. The 
former, if purchased from the msiker, cannot be counterfeited ; 
but soy is so often adulterated by the dealers, that the only 
sure way of getting it genuine is to procure it from the steward 
of some East India trader when she arrives in the docks. If 
well corked, it will keep good for years; and the older, 
perhaps, the better. 

There is certainly far less trouble, and probably more eco- 
nomy, in buying any of these sauces, than in making them at 
home ; but for those ladies who choose to amuse themselves by 
having such preparations made " under their own eye," we 
add a few receipts that may be found useful. 

STORE SAUCES. 

768. — 1. Take 2 wineglasses of port, 2 of walnut and 4 of 
mushroom ketchup, 4 anchovies pounded, with 2 shalots, a 
tablespoonful of soy, and a teaspoonful of cayenne pepper. 
Boil all well together; when cold, put it into bottles well 
corked ; it will keep good for more than a twelvemonth. 

2. Take i oz. of mace, 1 oz. each of cloves, ginger, and 
allspice, 1 lb. of anchovies, a bottle of either white or red 
wine, i pint of vinegar, a couple of shalots and a clove 
of garlic chopped, and a stick of scraped horseradish, together 
with a bundle of pot-herbs. Let all simmer over a slow fire 
till the anchovies are dissolved ; then strain the liquor, bottle 
it when cold, and when wanted for use add a tablespoonful of 
the sauce to i lb. of melted butter. 

3. Thicken i lb. of butter with flour, and brown it ; then 
put to it 1 lb. of the best anchovies cut small, 6 blades of 
pounded mace, 10 cloves, 40 berries of black pepper and 
allspice, a few small onions, a faggot of sweet herbs (namely, 
savory, thyme, basil, and knotted marjoram), and a little 
parsley and sliced horseradish ; on these pour i pint of the 
best sherry and H pint of strong gravy. Simmer all gently 
for 20 minutes ; then strain it through a sieve, and bottle it 
for use. The way of using it is, to boil some of it in the butter 
while melting. 

4. Put into a saucepan a pint of fine port wine, a gill of 
mountain, ^ pint of fine walnut ketchup, 12 anchovies and 
the liquor thiat belongs to them, a gill of walnut pickle, the 
rind and juice of a large lemon, 4 or 5 shalots, some ca^^ww^ 
to taste, 3 oz. of scraped horseradish, Z \>\aAe& o^ xDaa^^^^ ^sA 

^ ^ ^ 



648 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVI* 

2 teaspoonfuls of made mustard : boil it all genUy, till the 
rawness goes off; then put it into small bottles for use. CoriL 
them very dose, and seal the top. 

5. Chop 24 anchovies, not washed, and 10 shalotSi and 
scrape 3 spoonfuls of horseradish; which, with 10 blades 
of mace, 12 doves, 2 sliced lemons, i pint of anchovy 
liquor, a quart of hock or Rhenish wine, and a pint of water, 
boil to a quart ; then strain off; and when cold, add 3 large 
spoonfuls of walnut ketchup. 

All or any of these will be found excellent for fiunily use; 
as, when added to any common sauce for fish, or even to fdbun 
melted butter, a moderate quantity will impart to it a very fin^ 
flavour, and in many cases they may be used also for meat, if 
eaten cold. 

P<nUac Ketchup is for this purpose both very simple and 
very good. Put ripe elderberries, picked firom the stalk, into 
a stone jar, with as much strong vinegar as will cover them. 
Bake with the bread ; and, while hot, strain. Boil the liquor 
with a sufficient quantity of cloves, mace, peppercorns, and 
shalots, to give it a fine flavour. When that is obtained, put 
in i lb. of die finest anchovies to every quart of liquor ; stir, 
and boil only until dissolved. When cold, put it into pint 
bottles, and tie double bladders over each cork. The same 
method should be observed for preserving all ketchups. 

An excellent and not common Pickle^ called ^^ Salade^' 
may be made thus : — Fill a pint stone jar with equal quantities 
of onions, cucumbers, and sour apples, all cut into very thin 
slices, shaking in, as you go on, 1 teaspoonful of salt and three 
parts of a teaspoonful of cayenne. Pour in a wineglass of 
soy, the same of white wine, and fill up the jar with vinegar. 
It will be fit for use the same day. 

Qmn*s Sauce is also excellent, i pint of common mush- 
room-ketchup, i pint of walnut-liquor, 8 anchovies, 8 cloves of 
garlic, 4 bruised and 4 whole, 3 teaspoonfuls of cayenne pepper, 

3 of mushroom-powder, all boiled together for 5 minutes, and 
bottled when cold. 

UNIVERSAL SAUCES, 

769. — Anj of the following will be found good : — 1. i oz. 
each of black pepper and ^\mded allspice, 1 oz. of salt, ^ oz. 
of minced sbalot, li^t oim\]i^aQ«<Q\.<Ai.^\^>\^^?Lt^^ 



(JHAP. XXVI.] FAMILY SAUCES. ' 549 

of port wine, and a teaspoonful of chili vinegar. Set the bottle 
for 24 hours in a heat of about 90° of Fahrenheit ; let it stand 
for a week, then strain it offand bottle it. A spoonful mixed 
with gravy is excellent for cutlets. 

2. A wineglass each of mushroom and walnut ketchup, 
port wine, lemon-pickle, and chili vinegar, with i a glass of 
essence of anchovy. Put all together into a bottle, and shake it 
well ; it will be ready for immediate use, and greatly improve 
any sauce that needs pungency. 

3. Instead of anchovy, put the same quantity of soy, either 
with or without shalot or garlic vinegar in lieu of lemon- 
pickle. 

4. Mix 2 spoonfuls of Indian soy with i pint of vinegar, 
half i oz. of cayenne pepper, and a small quantity of garlic. 
Let the whole stand for some time in bottle. It will be found 
an excellent relish for fish or cold meat.

CHAPTER XXVn. 



CAKES, BUNS, AND GINGERBBEAD. 



CAKES. 

770.— Observations, — In making cakes it is indispensably ne- 
cessary that all the ingredients should be heated before th^ 
are mixed together ; for which purpose everything should be 
prepared for an hour or two previously to their being wanted, 
and placed near the fire or upon a stove — ^the flour thoroug^y 
dried and warmed; the currants, sugar, carraway-seed, and 
anything else required, heated in the same way ; butter and 
eggs should be beaten in basins fitted into kettles or pans of 
warm water, which will give them the requisite degree of 
temperature. Without these precautions, cakes will be heavy ; 
and the best materials, with the greatest pains, will fidl to 
produce the desired results. 

The following observations should also be strictly attended 
to:— 

Currants should be very nicely washed, dried in a cloth, and 
then set before the fire. If damp, they will make cakes or 
puddings heavy. Before they are to be used, a dust of dry flour 
should be thrown among them, and a shake given to them, 
which causes the cakes to be lighter. 

£ggs should be very long beaten, whites and yolks apart, 
and always strained. 

Sugar should be pounded in a mortar or rubbed to a powder 
on a clean board, and sifted through a very fine hair or lawn 
sieve. 

Lemon-peel should be pared very thin, and, with a little 
sugar, beaten in a marble mortar to a paste ; and then mixed 
with a little wine or cream, so as to divide easily among the 
other ingredients. The pans should be of earthenware ; nor 
should eggs or batter and sugar be beaten in tins, as the cold- 
ness of the metal wVl\ piev^nX. ^^TfiiitQYCL becoming light. 



Chap. XXVII.] 



CAKES. 



551 



Use no flour but the best sui)erfine ; for if the flour be of 
inferior quality the cakes will be heavy, ill-coloured, and unfit 
to eat ; but if a little potato-flour be added, it will improve 
their lightness. Cakes are frequently rendered hard, heavy^ 
and uneatable, by misplaced economy in eggs and butter, or 
for want of a due seasoning in spice and sugar. 

After all the articles are put into the pan, they should be 
thoroughly and long beaten, as the lightness of the cake de- 
pends much on their being well incorporated. 

Unless you are provided with proper utensils as well as 
materials, the difiiculty of making cakes will be so great as in 
most instances to be a fidlure. Accuracy in proportioning th^ 
ingredients is also indispensable ; and therefore scales, weights, 
and measures, down to the smallest quantity, are of the utmost 
importance. 

Iron ovens are desirable, as well for their economy of fuel 
as for the short time in which they can be heated, and on 
account of the celerity and convenience with which one person 
may prepare large quantities of small pastry, and bake it also* 

The most vigilant care and attention are necessary in order 
to secure success in the baking of delicate pastry or cakes ; for 
however well they may have 
been prepared, if not equally 
well baked, the result will 
be unsatisfactory ; we there- 
fore recommend a newly- 
invented moveable oven, 
made of iron, as represented 
in the cut ; it is manufac- 
tured in Paris, but will no 
doubt be soon copied in 
London. The hearth, at a, t ^ "J. 
is placed underneath ; and 
the smoke of a charcoal fire 
escapes through a flue at the back, after heating the oven, hi, 
by means of a flue passing round it. It also may be made to 
act as a stove for many other purposes.* 

The heat of the oven is of great importance, especially for 
large cakes. If not lighted long enough to have a body of 
heat, or if it is become slack, the cake will be heavy. If

not prattj quick, the batter wUl not rise. Shomld jon fiar 
itt catching by being too quick, put some paper over the cake 
to pierent its being burnt. To knov* when it is soaked, take 
a broad-bhtded knife that is very bright, and plunge it into the 
very centre ; draw it instantlv out, and if the least stiddnen 
adheres, put the cake inunecuatdy in again, and shot up the 
oven. 

If the heat should be sufficient to raise, but not to soak it, 
let fresh fuel be quickly put in, and the cakes k^ hot until 
the oven is fit to finish the soakinff ; but those liho are em- 
jdoyed ought to be particularly care^d that no mistake occutb 
from negtigence when laree cakes are to be baked. 

Bread ud cakes wetted with milk eat best when new, but 
become stale sooner than others. 

Cakes kept in drawers or wooden boxes have a disagreeable 
taste. Earthen pans and covers, or tin boxes, pr e s orve them 
best ; but in malung large cakes of any kind, which are to be 
baked in hoops, use thoM of wood. Cakes made with yeast 
should always be eaten fresh. 

FLUM'CAKES. 

771. — Mix thoroughly i peck of fine flour, weD dried, with 
1 lb. of dry and sifted loaf-sugar, 3 lbs. of currants washed 
and very dry, i lb. of raisins stoned and chopped, ^ os. each 
of mace, cloves, and cinnamon, a grated nutmeg, the peel of a 
lemon cut as fine as possible, and ^ lb. of almonds blanched 
and beaten with orange-flower water. Melt 2 lbs. of butter 
in 1 i pint of cream, but not hot ; put to it 1 pint of sweet wine, 
a glass of brandy, and another of rose-water, with the whites 
and yolks of 12 eggs beaten apart, and i pint of gpood yeast 
Strain this liquor by degrees into the dry ingredients, beating 
them together a full hour ; then butter the hoop or pan, ana 
bake it in a moderate oven for at least 4 hours. As you put 
in the batter, throw in plenty of citron, lemon, and orange 
candy. 

If you ice the cake, when it is nearly cold pour the iang 
over, and return it to the oven, where it should be left all 
night, or until it becomes cold ; but if the ovmi be wann, 
keep it near the mouth, and the door open, lest the colour be 
spoiled ; or the icing may be left until the next morning. 

Or: — ^Take 2 lbs. of dtved flour^ the same of currant^ lib.

together ; beat 10 eggs, yolks and whites separately ; then melt 
1^ lb. of butter and 1 pint of cream; when lukewarm, put to 
it i pint of ale-yeast, nearly i pint of sweet wine, and the eggs ; 
then strain the liquid to the dry ingredients, beat them well, 
and add of cloves, mace, cinnamon, and nutmeg, all together 
1 oz. ; butter the pan, and put it into a quick oven ; 3 hours 
will bake it, if the oven be of baker's heat, but it will be better 
if baked somewhat longer at a more moderate temperature. 

An excellent Plum-cake, — Beat 1 lb. of fresh butter with a 
strong wooden fork until it resembles cream ; add 1 lb. of 
sifted sugar, and mix them very completely ; have ready the 
whites of 10 eggs beaten, and pour them into the butter and 
sugar ; then add the yolks of 18 eggs, also well beaten, and 
beat them all up for 10 minutes. Take 1 lb. of flour, 2 oz. of 
pounded and sifted spices (viz. cloves, mace, cinnamon, nut- 
meg, and allspice), and mix them by degrees with the other 
ingredients ; then beat the whole 10 minutes longer, and when 
the oven is ready add 1 lb. of currants, 4 oz. of sliced almonds, 
i lb. of raisins stoned and chopped, and a large glass of brandy. 
Bake the cake in a hot oven. When sufficiently baked, let 
the oven cool, and afterwards put in the cake, and allow it to 
remain for several hours to dry. 

Very good common Plum-cakes, — ^Mix 5 oz. of butter in 3 
lbs. of dry flour and 5 oz. of fine Lisbon sugar ; add 6 oz. of 
currants washed and dried, and some pimento finely powdered. 
Put 3 spoonfuls of yeast into a pint of new milk warmed, and 
mix into a light dough with the above. Make it into 12 cakes, 
and bake on a floured tin i an hour. 

Plum-cakes require less butter and eggs for having yeast, 
and eat equally light and rich. K the leaven be only of flour, 
milk and water, and yeast, it becomes more tough, and is less 
easily divided, than if the butter be first put with those ingre- 
dients, and the dough afterwards set to rise by the fire. 

Little Plum-cakes to keep long, — Dry 1 lb. of flour, and mix 
with 6 oz. of finely-pounded sugar ; beat 6 oz. of butter io a 
cream, and add to 3 eggs, well beaten, i lb. of currants washed 
and nicely dried, and the flour and sugar ; beat all for some 
time, then dredge flour on tin plates, and drop the batter on 
them the size of a walnut. If properly mixed, it will be a stiff 
paste. Bake in a brisk oven. 



554 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Cbap. XXYH. 

BRIDE-CAKE. 

772. — Wash 2i lbs. of fresh butter in plain water first, and 
then in rose-water ; beat the butter to a cream ; beat 20 eggs, 
yolks and whites separately, i an hour each. Have rndy 
2i lbs. of the finest flour, well dried and kept hot, likewise 
li lb. of sugar pounded and sifted, 1 oz. of spice in fine 
powder, 3 lbs. of currants nicely cleaned and dry, i lb. of 
almonds blanched, and i lb. of sweetmeats cut, not too thin. 
Let all be kept by the fire, mix all the dry ingredioits, pour 
the eg^ strained to the butter, but beat the whites of the 
eg^ to a strong froth ; mix i pint of sweet wine with the 
same quantity of brandy, pour it to the butter and eggs, mix 
well, then have all the dry things put in by degrees ; beat 
them very thoroughly — you can hardly do it too much. 
Having i lb. of stoned jar-raisins chopped as fine as possible, 
mix them carefully, so that there should be no lump, and add 
a teacupful of orange-flower water ; beat the ingredients to- 
gether a full hour at least. Have a hoop well buttered ; take 
a white paper, doubled and buttered, and put in the pan round 
the edge ; do not fill it more than three parts with batter, as 
space should be allowed for rising. Bake in a quick oven. It 
will require full 3 hours. In making cakes of a larger size, 
put at the rate of 8 eggs to every pound of flour, and other in- 
gredients in the same proportion. 

The cake must be covered with an icing. 

QUEEN-CAKE. 

" 773. — Mix 1 lb. of dried flour, the same of sifted sugar and 
of washed currants. Wash 1 lb. of butter in rose-water, beat 
it well, then mix with it 8 eggs, yolks and whites beaten sepa- 
rately, and put in the dry ingredients by degrees ; beat the 
whole an hour ; butter little tins, teacups, or saucers, filling 
them only half full. Sift a little fine sugar over just as yo« 
put them into the oven. 

Or : — Beat 8 oz. of butter, and mix with 2 well-beaten eggs 
strained ; mix 8 oz. of dried flour, and the same of lump- 
sugar, and the grated rind of a lemon ; then add the whole 
together, and beat full i an hour with a silver spoon. Butter

loaf-sugar ; set the pan in warm water and whisk very briskly 
for i of an hour, or until the batter is quite thick and warm ; 
take it out of the water and whisk until cold; stir in as 
lightly as possible to thoroughly mix it, 1 lb. of flour ; flavour 
with essence of lemon, or the rind of a lemon rubbed on 
sugar ; pour into the mould and bake. 

Prepare the mould as follows : — Melt a little fresh butter, 
take off the scum, and pour it off the dregs ; let it cool, and 
with a brush (a painter's small brush is very good for the 
purpose) rub it well, so that it looks creamy, into all the points 
of the mould, and dust it with sugar and flour, mixed in 
equal quantities, suflicient to adhere to the batter. 

The same preparation is used for Sponge CaheSy baking 
them of course in proper moulds. 

Or : — ^Take 8 eggs, i the whites, i lb. of lump-sugar, i lb. of 
flour, i pint of water, the peel of a lemon ; mix as follows : — 
Over night pare a good-sized lemon thin, and put the peel 
into the water ; when about to make the cake, put the sugar 
into a saucepan, pour the water and lemon-peel to it, and let 
it stand by the fire to get hot. Break the ^;gs into a deep 
earthen vessel that has been made quite hot ; whisk the eggs 
for a few minutes with a whisk that has been well soaked in 
water ; make the sugar and water boil up, and pour it boiling 
hot over the eggs ; continue to whisk them briskly for about 
i of an hour, or till they become quite thick and white, which 
is a proof of their lightness. Have the flour well dried, and 
quite warm from the fire ; just stir it lightly in, put the cake 
into moulds, and bake them immediately in a moderately hot 
oven.

thick ; or the sponge-mtsing may be baked at once in a round 
shape, about 6 or 8 inches in diameter, and afterwards divided 
into slices. Fut between each layer of cake one of preserves, 
each of a different sort, with strawberries at the top ; and 
cover the whole cake, top and sides, with a thick icing of

oven, add the peel of a whole lemon grated, then put in i 
the juice, and send it to the oven ; 40 minutes will bake it. 

Or: — 1 lb. of ground rice, 1 lb. of lump-sugar sifted, 8 
eggs, yolks and whites, well beaten all together, the rind of a 
lemon grated, and the juice of one. When all the ingredients 
are mixed, beat them i an hour longer, then put it into a 
well-buttered tin ; H hour will bake it. 

Or : — Mix 10 oz. of ground rice, 3 oz. of flour, 8 oz. of 
pounded sugar ; then sift by degrees into 8 yolks and 6 whites 
of ^gs, and the peel of a lemon shred so fine that it is quite 
mashed ; mix the whole well in a tin stewpan over a very slow 
fire with a whisk, then put it immediately into the oven in the 
same, and bake 40 minutes. 

Or : — Take i lb. of clarified butter, 8 eggs well beaten, 
leaving out the whites of 2, i lb. of pounded sugar, and the 
grated peel of a lemon ; mix these well together ; then add 
ground rice and dried flour, i lb. of each ; currants and can- 
died peel may be added when approved. 

WAFERS,— E. R. 

780. — Take fine flour, dried and sifted, make it into a smooth 
thin batter with very good milk, or a little cream and water ; 
add about as much white wine as will make it thick enough 
for pancakes, sweeten it with a little loaf-sugar, and flavour 
with beaten cinnamon. When thus prepared, have the wafer- 
irons made ready by being heated over a charcoal fire ; rub 
the irons with a piece of linen cloth dipped in butter, then 
pour a spoonful of the batter upon them, and close them almost 
immediately ; turn them upon the fire, pare the edges with a 
knife, as some of the batter will ooze out. A short time will 
bake them when the irons are properly heated. The wafers 
must be curled round whilst warm. 

Sugar-wafers, which are much in use throughout France 
and Spain for eausticree, are made by whisking white sugar 
into a froth with the white of eggs and isinglass, and then 
baking it as above. 

PROVINCIAL CAKES. 

781. — Shrewsbury, — Sift 1 lb. of sugar, some pounded cin-

dried ; add 2 oz. of carraway-seeds, and bake in 80iq>-plateB or 
tin pans in a brisk oven. 

'Dmbridge, — Mix i lb. of flour with 2 oc of batter and i 
lb. of sugar, to which add 1 or 2 oz. of carraway-eeeds, and 
make it into a stiff paste with a little water ; cut it into round 
cakes, prick them with a fork, and bake them upcm floured tins. 

Banbury — Are made without seeds, and chiefly composed 
of mincemeat baked for about i an hour in a rich paste, then 
cut into square or oblong pieces, and generally eatoi cold. 

Yorkshire. — ^To 1 quart of lukewann milk add i pint of 
good ale yeast, and mix them well together with enough flour 
to make a thick batter ; let it stand in a warm place till it rises 
as high as it can ; then rub i lb. of butter into some flour, 
and mix with it 4 eggs ; beat all well together, add sufficient 
flour to make it into dough, and let it stand for ian hour; 
then work it lightly up and make into buns, put them on tins 
in a slow oven, cover them with a light cloth, and toast them 
with butter. 

BUTTER CAKES.— E.R. 

782. — To i lb. of butter add the same quantity of brown 
sugar, 3 eggs, the rind of 2 lemons, i oz. of pounded cinna- 
mon, and i the quantity of powdered ginger ; work into it as 
much flour as will make it a paste ; cut it into shapes or leave 
it whole, and strew over the top some pounded almonds and 
candied orange-peel. Bake in a slow oven. 

MACAROONS. 

783. — Blanch 4 oz. of almonds, and pound with 4 spoonfuls 
of orange-flower water ; whisk the whites of 4 ^gs to a froth, 
then mix it, and 1 lb. of sugar sifted, with the almonds to a 
paste ; and, laying a sheet of wafer-paper . on a tin, put it on 
in different little cakes, the shape of macaroons.

beaten, another i lb. of sugar, 1 lb. of almonds sliced, and i 
lb. of flour, which last must be just sprinkled over the other in- 
gredients after they have been well mixed together, which will 
take nearly an hour. Take up a sufficient quantity of the 
mixture in a spoon, drop it on paper sprinkled with flour, and 
bake on tins in a slow oven for 2 hours. 

Or : — To 1 lb. of blanched sweet almonds add 2 oz. of bitter 
almonds, with the juice of 1 lemon and a glass of ratafia. 

ALMOND-CAKES.— E, 22. 

784. — Beat 1 lb. of almonds very fine with rose-water, mix 
in i lb. of sifted sugar, make them into shapes, put them be- 
fore the fire to dry on one side, then turn them. When dry 
on both sides, take some sifted sugar and as much white of 
egg as will just wet it ; beat it with a spoon ; as it grows white 
put in a little more egg, till it is thin enough to ice the cakes ; 
then ice one side, dry it before the fire, and be sure it is 
quite dry before icing the other side. The flavour of the 
almond is often given to pastry by bay-leaves and the essence 
of fruit-kernels, but pounded bitter almonds are safer and better 
for the purpose. 

Ratafia Cakes are made in the same manner, but substitute 
ratafia-brandy for rose-water, and use i lb. of bitter instead 
of the same quantity of sweet almonds; make them rather 
smaller. 

JUMBLES, 

785. — To li lb. of butter, well creamed, put 1 lb. of sugar 
and 3 eggs beaten well together, H lb. of sifted flour, and 2 
spoonfuls of rose-water ; mix these well together, and with a 
fork drop them on a tin, and bake in a quick oven. 

Or : — Take i lb. of flour, the same weight of loaf-sugar 
grated, 2 oz. of butter rubbed into the flour, 1 egg, and a 
dessertspoonful of ratafia-brandy or orange-flower water; make 
it up into a paste ; if more moisture is required, add a spoon- 
ful of cream ; drop it on tins with a fork. 

Bout Drops. — Mix 2 lbs. of flour, 1 lb. of butter, 1 lb. of 
sugar, 1 lb. of currants clean and dry ; then wet into a stiff 
paste, with 2 eggs, a large spoonful of orange-flower water,

white sugar. Cut into pieces, mcmki with the oAnd, and bake 
in a brisk oven : they snonld not be too thin. 

WWunU Gutter.— Warm i pint of water, flavmned with 
a little salt; mix 4 beaten em with ilb. of H^rew or 
<< matso-floar,** and a couple of lumps of white sugar with a

SCOTCH RECEIPT FOR SHORT-BREAD.— E, JZ. 

787.— To 4 lbs. of flour take 2 of butter, quite fireah and 
without salt, 4 lb. of moist sugar, 1 lb. of citron, and the aame of 
almonds, the latter blanched, and all cut smalL Mix tlie sugar 
and fruit well with the flour, th«i work it up with the batter, 
oold, till it is smooth and compact, but it will take a longtime; 
divide into 4 or more pieces, and roll oat each piece into an 
oblong cake, having previously floured the table welL Prii& 
the top with a steel fork, strew some orange and citron cut thin, 
and some larg^ carrawav-comfits, press them in with the rdller, 
then pinch round the edges, put the cakes in floured tins ; bake 
for 20 minutes. If the cake rise after the pressing of the finger, 
it is sufliciently done. 

Or : — One lb. each of butter and sifted sugar, 2 lbs. of flour, 
8 oz. of sweet and 4 oz. of bitter almonds, a small piece of cin- 
namon, all pounded, and a glass of brandy. Soften the buttff 
l>efore the fire, then rub in the flour, and make it into a paste ; 
roll it out ^ inch thick, and bake it on a tin in a slow oveO) 
as it should l>e of a pale colour. 

A GOOD POUND-CAKE. 

788. — Beat 1 lb. of butter to a cream, and mix with it the 
whites and yolks of 8 eggs beaten apart. Have ready, warm 
by the fire, 1 lb. of flour, and the same of sifted sugar ; mix 
them and a few cloves, a little nutmeg and cinnamon, in fine 
powder together ; then by degrees work the dry ingredients 
into the butter and eugs. When well beaten, add a glass of 
wine and some carraways. It must l>e beaten a full hour. 
Butter a pan, and bake it an hour in a quick oven. 

The above pro^rtions, leaving out 4 oz. of the butter, and 
the same of sugar, Tnak«9i\i5»\\>aK5L<cM&^2»kj^ and to most tastes 
a more pleasant one. 



Chap. XX Vn.] CAKES. 563 



LEMON-CAKE. 

789. — ^Beat 6 eggs, the yolks and whites separately, till in a 
solid froth ; add to the yolks the grated rind of a fine lemon 
and 6 oz. of sugar dried and sifted ; beat this i of an hour ; 
shake in with the left hand 6 oz* of dried flour; then add the 
whites of the eg^ and the juice of the lemon ; when these are 
well beat^i in, put it immediately into tins, and bake it about 
an hour in a moderately hot oven. 

SODA-CAKE.— E, M, 

790. — 1 lb. of flour, 1 drachm of soda, i lb. of sugar, 
^ lb. of currants, and i lb. of butter. Mix the soda with the 
flour, then rub in the butter, after which add the sugar and the 
currants, and then a pint of milk. Put it into the oven imme- 
diately. 

A variety may be given l^ substituting i lb. of lemon, 
orange, and citron, candied, and 1 oz. of pounded sweet almonds, 
for the currants ; but in that case the cake will require rather 
m(H% soda. 

Or : — A good plain one can be made with 2 lbs. of flour, 8 
oz. of butter or dripping, 8 oz. of sugar, 1 pint of milk, with 
3 or 4 eggs, and a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda. Carbonate 
of soda should be very sparingly used in light cakes, and then 
it ought to be combined with a little sour milk, or acid, to 
produce carbonic gas, in order to make them porous. Mix the 
carbonate of soda intimately with the flour or sugar, then mix 
th^n with the other ingredients, and make the whole into a 
dough with the milk, or milk and eggs well beaten ; put it into 
a well-buttered tin or hoop, and bake it in a cool oven about 
3 hours. If currants are added, it will take fully that time. 
A good plan to ensure the sides and bottom from being burnt 
is to tie a piece of paper folded in 3 or 4 folds round the sides, 
and put the tin or hoop on a flat baking tin, with a little saw- 
dust or fine ashes between. 

FRENCH CAKES.

Ztes Brioches are, in France, mote used as a breakfiut- 
bread than as cakes, but in Elngland thej are only to be had, 
when ordered, in liie diops m some foreign pastry-oooks ; 
wkactk is to be regretted, as th^ are ooosidered a great ddi- 
caey when made in the form of twists or othor fimcy shapes, 
and eaten either hot or cold. 

Take any quantity of the brioche paste (as at No. 642) ; 
knead it over-nig^t, and cover it in a warm place, to allow it 
to rise ; then, at a convenient hour finr bieak&st, knead it 
again, and if not suffici^itly risen, add an egg and a little 
more yeast, make it into shapes, and bake them for -} to 1 
hour, according to thdr size. 

Frttngipane is a French paste, made with 2 or 3 ^gs put 
into a saucepan with 1 tablespoonful of flour, moistened with 
a little milk, and placed on the fire for about 10 minutes; 
taking care to stir the materials continually, to prevent them 
from sticking to the pan. The substance may either be used 
as a paste for tartlets, or eaten as cakes, if made with sugar 
and macaroons. 

Im Galette is in great &vour among the Parisians, who 
usually eat it with sweetmeats, but vary it in point of richness 
by the greater or less quantity of cream and butter employed 
in making it up. It is thus made : — 

Take 1 lb. each of butter and flour, a little salt, and 2 
eggs ; knead the whole together into a paste, roll it to not 
more than an inch in thickness, and make it the size of a dessert- 
plate. Then put it into the oven for i of an hour ; take it out ; 
beat up 2 eggs with a little cream and some salt, pour it over 
the cake, and return it to the oven to bake for another f of an 
hour; or, if you please, ornament the back with candied citron. 

SPANISH CAKES, 

792.— Put 12 eggs (cleared of the "trails") into a large 
chocolate-pot, and mill them to a froth. Mix by d^rees -fib.

ter has been worked with the hand to a cream, sift in the sugar, 
which should be quite hot ; when mixed pour in the yolks of 
eggs, then add the whites ; work it ^ an hour, then add the 
flour by degrees ; when thoroughly mixed, add a very small 
teacupfiil of brandy. The currants and almonds, with i lb. of 
lemon or citron peel, should be added just before the cakes are 
placed in the oven, which should be hot. The cake should be 
beaten an hour ; the hand should be kept moving the same 
way, and not taken out. 

ISLE OF WIGHT CRACKNELS, 

794. — Mix with a quart of flour i a nutm^ grated, the 
yolks of 4 eggs beaten, with 4 spoonfuls of rose-water, into a

2 oz. of ground ginger, and a grated nutm^; mix it up 
with as much flour as will make it into a stiff paste ; roll it out 
thin, and cut it into small cakes j bake in a quick oven. 

Tea BiseuiU are made with the finest flour, fresh butter sea- 
soned with a little salt, and melted in warm milk : for a mo* 
derate quantity, 1 lb. of flour, 2 oz. of butter, and 1 pint of 
milk will be sufficient. Make it into a stiff paste, adding to 
it a large tablespoonful of strong brewers' yeast, and leave it 
covered near the fire during time enough to make it rise. 
When quite light knead it well, roll it out an inch thick, and 
form it into round cakes of the size of a muffin. Bake them 
in buttered pans until they are of a light brown ; split and 
butter them and send them to table hot. 

If intended to be kept and eaten cold, the paste must be 
rolled out very thin, and cut of a smaller size. 

Swiss Biscuits. — Mix 4 oz. of fine flour, 2 oz. of sifted 
sugar, the grated peel of a lemon, and i lb. of butter, to a 
paste, ¥rith the white of an egg, and a sufficient quantity of

baking, boil 1 lb. of sugar, in a pint of water, to a thin S3rrup : 
while both are hot, dip each cake into it, and put them on tins 
into the oven to dry for a short time; when the oven is 
cooler still, return them there again, and let them stay 4 or 5 
hours. If kept dry they will be good for months. 

White Cakes. — Dry i lb. of flour, rub into it a very little

Cookies. — One lb. of butter, i lb. of sugar, 2 teaspoonfub 
(or 3 drachms) of saleratus, 3 lbs. of flour, and about a pint 
of buttermilk, or milk that is slightly sour may be used 
instead ; flavour the whole with ground coriander-seed ac- 
cording to taste. Cinnamon, ginger, or nutmeg, may be sub- 
stituted for the coriander if desired. Warm the buttermilk, 
and dissolve the saleratus in it by stirring. The sugar may be 
boiled in i pint of water, and allowed to cool before using, 
when less buttermilk must be used, and the butter must be 
rubbed small with the flour ; or beat the butter and sugar to- 
gether in a pan to a nice cream ; add the other ingredients, 
and make into a paste. Make into rolls i inch thick, and cut 
into what shape you please ; or roll out the paste to the same 
thickness, and cut it into any desired form. Bake from 20 
minutes to i an hour in a moderately cool oven. The same 
preparation, with only half the quantity of butter and sugar, 
and i pint more milk or water, makes a most excellent cake 
(superior to soda) for tea, or for children, to which carraway- 
seeds or currants may be added. 

Waffles are likewise in very general use among the Ame- 
ricans, and are made thus : — 

Put 2 pints of rich milk into separate pans ; cut up and melt 



Chap. XXVII.] BUNS. 569 

in one of them i lb. of butter, warming it slightly ; then, 
when it is melted, set it away to cool ; beat 8 eggs very light, 
and mix them gradually into the other pan of milk alternately 
with i lb. of flour ; then mix in by degrees the milk that has 
the butter in. Lastly, stir in a large tablespoonful of strong 
fresh yeast, cover the pan, and set it near the fire to rise. When 
the batter is quite light, heat your waffle-iron, by putting it 
among the coals of a clear bright fire ; grease the inside with 
butter tied in a rag, and then put in some batter. Shut the 
iron closely, and, when the waffle is done on one side, turn the 
iron on the other. Take the cake out by slipping a knife un- 
derneath, and then heat and grease the iron for another waffle. 
Send them to table quite hot, 4 or 6 on a plate, having but- 
tered them and strewed over each a mixture of powdered cin- 
namon and white sugar. Or you may send the sugar and cin- 
namon in a little glass bowl.» 

ICING FOR CAKES, 

800. — Beat the whites of 4 eggs to a solid froth, add gra- 
dually I lb. of refined sugar pounded and sifted ; mix in the 
juice of i a lemon ; beat it till very light and white. The 
cake should be cold. Place it before the fire, pour over it 
the icing, and smooth over the top and sides with a knife. It 
might be set to dry at the mouth of a cool oven. 



BUNS. 

801. — To make a good plain Bun. — Rub 4 oz. of butter 
into 2 lbs. of fiour, 4 oz. of sugar, a nutmeg, or not, as you 
like, a few Jamaica peppers, a dessertspoonful of carraways ; 
put a spoonful or two of cream into a cup of yeast, and as much 
good milk as will make the above into a light paste. Set it 
to rise by a fire till the oven be ready. They will quickly 
bake on tins. 

For richer Buns, — Mix li lb. of dried flour with i lb. of 
sugar, melt 1 lb. and 2 oz. of butter in a little warm water, 
add 6 spoon fills of rose-water, and knead the above into alight

Crou J9t0i#.— Take 4 lbs. of flour, rub io i lb. of butte, 
warm a quart of milk, and mix with ^ pfaiit of good Ii|^t 
yeast; pour this into the middle of the flour, and mix it into a 
thin batter ; oover it orer, and let it stand to rise ; theu- add 
10 OS. of moist sugar and a teaspooniul of groiind albpiot ;

over again with milk. 

Madeira ^«itf.— Beat 8 oz. of butter to a enam, to wUeh 
add 2 eggs long beaten. Have ready 14 os. of flour, 6 os. of 
lump-sugar sifted, h a nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful of sifted ginger, 
and a large spoonful of carraway-seeds, and, after mixing, 
work them well into the butter ; beat it i an hour ; then add 
a large wineglass of sherry. Bake in tin pattypans in a mo- 
derately quick oven. 

Spanish Buns. — ^Take 1 lb. of fine floor, rub into it i lb. 
of butter ; add ^ lb. of sugar, the same of currants, a little 
nutm(?g, mace, and cinnamon ; mix it with 5 eegs weU beaten ; 
make this up into small buns, and bake them on tins 20 
minutes ; when half done brush them over with a little hot milk. 

Bath *Buns, — The following is the original receipt : — 
To i lb. of fine flour put 4 yolks and 3 whites of eggs, with 
4 spoonfuls of solid yeast (care must be taken that it is not 
bitter). Beat it well in a bowl, and set it before the fire to 
rise. Then rub into 1 lb. of flour 10 oz. of good butter, 
put in ^ lb. of sugar, and carraway comfits ; when the eggs 
and yeast are pretty light, mix by degrees all well together, 
throw a cloth over it, and set it before the fire again to rise. 
Then make your buns, and when you have put them on the 
tins, brush them over with the yolk of eg^ and milk ; strew 
them with carraway-comfits, and bake them in a quick oven. 

A rich Scotch Bun. — 4 lbs. of flour (Judf a peck of Scotch)^ 
2 lbs. of raisins stoned and cut, and 2 lbs. of currants. Take 6 
oz. of orange-peel, the same of citron, and of almonds blanched 
and cut ; mix all these together. Take 1 drachm of doves, a 
large nutmeg, ^oz. of allspice, and the same of ginger ; pound 
them, strew the spice on the firuit, and mix them very weU* 



Chap. XXVn.] GINGERBREAD. 571 

Make a hole in the flour, break in nearly 1^ lb. of butter, pour 
warm water on the butter to soften it a little ; then work the 
flour and butter together, spread the paste, and poux in i pint 
of good yeast ; work it up very well until the paste is light and 
smooth. Cut off* about a third part of the paste for the sheets, 
spread out the rest of the paste on the table, put the fruit on it, 
poUr about a gill of yeast over the fruit and paste^ and work the 
fruit and paste very well together. Then nMike it up round ; 
roll out the sheet which was reserved in a circular form, lay 
the bun on the middle, and gather the sheet round it ; roll it 
out to the desired thickness, run a fork through in diflerent 
parts down to the bottom, and pinch it on the top. Flour 
double grey paper and put the bun upon it, give it a cut round 
ihe side, put a binder of double paper round it to keep it from 
running too thin in the oven. Bake in a moderate oven. 

Or : — For the plainer sort, to 2 lbs. of flour add 1 lb. of 
butter, melt the butter, and make the flour into dough with it 
and about a gill of good yeast. Make it into cakes i inch in 
thickness, adding lib. of lump-sugar beaten, and Hoz. ofcar- 
raway-seeds on the top. Let the doush lie on the table &fler it 
is cut out until it becomes stifle, which Will not take long, and 
then put it into the oven. 



GINGERBREAD. 

802. — This is amongst the most ancient species of cake known 
throughout England and the north of Europe. In this country 
it is rarely eaten, except by children, but in Holland it is the 
common accompaniment of the ^' schnaps ;" and in Ghent there 
are shops as famous for it as our ^^ Leman " for biscuits. 
The following are selected from amongst the numerous ways 
of making it : — 

Take 1 lb. of treacle, 1 lb. of butter, 2 lbs. of flour, 
1 02. of ground ginger, sliced candied orange, and a glass of 
brandy. If not intended to be rich, omit h the butter, the 
brandy, and lemon, and make it of rye flour, household flour, or 
oatmeal. At Leeds it is made with equal quantities of oatmeal 
and treacle, mixed with an eighth part of melted butter and 
brown sugar, and 1 oz. of powdered ganger, with ^ that quan- 
tity of other spice, to 4 lbs. of meal. This is called in that neigh-

bourhood ** Parkin/* and is made in almost every cottage on 
the 5th of November, and pieces sent aboat as presents. 

The traacle should be perfectly sweet, for, if in the least 
degree sour or too thick, the bread will be indifferent in flavour 
and appearance. Ginger, too, should be fresh ground, as it 
loses much of its strength by keeping. When baked, the tin 
must be well buttered to make the cake come out ; and when 
done, a fork, if thrust into it, will come out clean. 

Another sort. — To f lb. of treacle beat 1 egg strained ; mix 
4 oz. of brown sugar, ^ oz. of ganger sifted ; of cloves, mace, 
allspice, nutmeg, i oz. together, beaten as fine as possible ; 
coriander and carraway seeds, each i oz. ; melt 1 lb. of butter, 
and mix with the above ; and add as much flour as will knead 
into a pretty stiff paste ; then roll it out, and cut into cakes. 

Bake on tin plates in a quick oven. A little time will bake 
them. 

A good plain sort. — Mix 3 lbs. of flour with ^ lb. of butter,> 
4 oz. of brown sugar, i oz. of pounded giikger ; then make into 
a paste with li lb. of treacle warm. 

A good sorty without btUter. — Mix 2 lbs. of treacle; of 
orange, lemon, citron, and candied ginger, each 4 oz., all 
thinly sliced ; 1 oz. of coriander-seeds, 1 oz. of carraways, and 
1 oz. of beaten ginger, in as much flour as will make a soft 
paste ; hjff it in cakes on tin plates, and bake it in a quick oven. 
Keep it dry, and it will be good for some months. 

Imperial Gingerbread, — Rub 6 oz. of butter into i lb. of 
flour, then mix 6 oz. of treacle with a pint of cream careftdly, 
lest it should turn the cream ; mix in i lb. of double-refined 
sugar, i oz. of powdered ginger, and 1 oz. of carra way-seeds ; 
stir the whole well together into a paste, cut it into shapes, 
and stick cut candied orange or lemon peel on the top. 

Lemon Gingerbread. — Grate the rinds of 2 or 3 lemons, and 
add the juice to a glass of brandy : then mix the grated lemon 
in 1 lb. of flour, make a hole in the flour, pour in ^ lb. of 
treacle, i lb. of butter melted, the lemon-juice and brandy, 
and mix all up togethel* with i oz. of ground ginger and i oz.* 
of cayenne pepper. 

Sugar Gingerbread. — 1 lb. of sugar, 1 lb. of flour, and 
4 eggs ; beat the sugar and eggs till they are white, then add 
a little ginger and rose-water and the flour. 



Chap. XXVH.] GINGERBREAD. 573 

Thick Gingerbread, — The same ingredients are used as for 
the nuts, but the proportions are different. Use only sufficient 
treacle to knead the 2 lbs. of flour into a stiff dough : 2 oz. of 
butter and the same quantity of sugar are sufficient. The whole 
of the ammonia evaporates during the process of baking. 

Another, — Rub 4 lb. of butter into 2 lbs. of flour ; wid i lb. 
of brown sugar, 2 oz. of powdered ginger, i oz. of ground car- 
raway-seeds, and the same of carbonate of soda ; mix them 
well, then work them with 2 lbs. of treacle, and 3 eggs well 
beaten ; pour the mixture into shallow tins, filling them about 
half full. Bake 1^ hour in a moderate oven. 

GINGERBREAD'NUTS. 

803. — The Yorkshire JReceipt. — Mix i lb. of flour, the same 
quantity of butter and of brown sugar, with 3 oz. of ginger, a 
teaspoonful of carbonate of soda rubbed into the flour, with as 
much treacle as will make it into a paste. Boll it out thin, 
and bake it for about 20 minutes in a slow oven. 

The Suffolk Receipt. — Put 1 lb. of brown sugar and 1 lb. 
of honey, with i the rind of a lemon grated, into a saucepan, 
and simmer them well together ; then add 4 oz. of good fresh 
butter and 1 oz. of ginger ; mix the whole with 2 lbs. of flour. 

These two receipts have been strongly recommended. 

With Carraway Seeds. — Take Hlb. of fine flour well dried, 
add 1 oz. of pounded ginger, i oz. of carraway-seeds, lind i lb. 
of coarse sugar. Put i lb. of treacle and i lb. of fresh butter 
in a pan, and when it boils mix it with the other ingredients 
into a stiff paste, and set it before the fire to lighten ; &en bake 
in any form that may be desirable. 

Take 2 lbs. of flour, 2 lbs. of treacle, i lb. of butter, i lb. 
of sugar, ilb. of candied peel, 1 oz. of ground ginger, 1 oz. of 
coriander and 1 oz. of carraway seeds, finely pounded : mix 
all well together. Just before it is put into the oven (which 
must be a moderate one) stir in i oz. of carbonate of ammonia, 
finely powdered ; if required lighter, i oz. may be used. Some 
persons use 1 oz. of pearlashes instead of the ammonia, but the 
latter is preferred. 

Or : — i lb. of flour, i lb. of treacle, 1 teaspoonful of cay- 
enne pepper, 2 eggs, a little volatile salts, and 1 tablespoon- 
ful of coriander and carraway seeds. Make the treacle hot, 
and mix in the other ingredients ; then make them into nuts as 
above.

FLOUR. 

804. — With regard to that most eMential object, Ibegmakiif 
of ike fiouT^ we need hardly insist that it should not only 
be good but of the best corn, that being the best eoonomy, 
both in point of price, and the kind, as well as quantity, of 
the bread made from it. 

Cheap bread must ever be of indiffisrent quality. The 
flour of which it is made is always ground either from damaged 
wheat, or that of the most inferior kind, mixed by the miller 
with a little of the better sort, and made up by the bak^ with 
potato starch, alum, and soda, to render it apparently good. 

If you grow your own wheat, winnow it, screen it, scutch 
it, air it, and do not send it to the mill until 12 months old: 
even then, do not trust it to the miller, unless under your own 
eye or that of a confidential servant. 

The value of wheaten flour consists, besides its purity, in 
the quantity which it contains of that portion of the grain 
termed " gluten," of which there is more in that grown in the 
southern climates than in those of the north ; which may in 
some degree account for the superiority ascribed to the Ame- 
rican flowr imported into this country from Virginia.' The 
flour should never be made from corn that is not some months 
old, and should be kept in a dry part of the house for a few 
weeks before being baked. 

Household 3read of very wholesome quality may be made 
with coarser flour, or even by merely screening off the out- 

* The American flour imbibes more water than the English on making it 
into bread ; for it has been stated, in comfNuratiye experiments, that a stone 
of 14 lbs. weight of the American flour wUl make 21 lbs. of l>read, but the 
best sort of English flour only produces about 18} lbs. 



Chap. XXVIH.] BREAD. 575 

ward bran of the wheat, and making the whole into loaves, 
without sifting the flour into the different sorts of fineness. 
It is looked upon by medical men as a good vemedy for in- 
digestion ; and the different effects created by the constant use 
of white or brown bread have beai thus stated : — 

*' Mistaken notions respecting the qusdity of different sorts 
of bread have given rise to much waste. The general belief 
is, that the bread made of the finest flour is the best, and that 
whit^iess is the proof of its quality : but both these opinions 
are popular errors. The whiteness may be, and generally is, 
communicated by alum, to the injury of the consumer ; and 
it is wdl known by men of science that the bread of unrefined 
flour will sustain life, while that made with the refined will 
not. Keep a man on brown bread and water, and he will tive 
and enjoy good health; give him white bread and water 
only, and he will gradually sicken, and probably in a short 
time die."* 

Brown Bread, when divested of the coarser bran, not only 
merits this preference in point of digestion, but is even 
thought to nourish better, as proved by the experience of 
sailors on long voyages, who are always furnished with bis- 
cuits made from unrefined flour, and are both strong and 
healthy. It should be made of unbolted wheat-meal, into 3 
quarts of which should be put a gill each of yeast and mo- 
lasses, with a quart of lukewarm water, and a teaspoonful of 
pearlash. This quantity will make as much as 2 loaves, when 
made in the usual mode of household bread. 

Bran, indeed, contains few nutritious parts, but then it 
contaias the essential oil and the larger portion of the saline 
substances of the vegetable. The grain is furnished with two 
membranes or husks, the second or inner of which is the 
principal seat of the oil ; and it is this oil which imparts that 
agreeable smell to brown bread so superior to white. In 
grinding the grain, a large portion of the first skin is divided 
from the second, and mixes very intimately with the rest ; the 
first is an indigestible husk, a great part of which will be 
separated by rejecting a third part of the bran, or by scuffling 
it rapidly in a circular turning machine of wire, the motion of 
which throws off the outer husk ; the finer parts, being thus 
intermixed, greatly facilitate the digestion of the bread by 
dividing its more glutinous pulp.

YEAST, 

805. — As to Yeast or Yest^ or as some peof4e all it 
^ bann,'' there can be no doubt that the best is that taken 
firom good brewers' ale, which not only causes the doi^ to 
rise with more certainty than any other con^Nisition, but ako 
imparts to the bread a slight aromatic bitter of a very agree- 
able flavour. This, however, cannot always be got, and 
although yeast of a good quality may generally be Ibond at 
most country oil-shops, we here add a few receq>ts for those 
who prefer having it made at home : premising that, as these 
are not so strong as the brewers' yeast, a larger quantity must 
be used. 

To 4 oz. of malt and 2 oz. of hops put a quart of boiling 
water, and let it remain boiling for 20 minutes, then strain 
the liquor to 8 oz. of flour ; cover it until it ferments, and use 
it when it rises. 

Patent Yeast. — ^The following is copied firom the cniginal 
specification in the patent-office, firom which was introduced 
the system, still in use amongst bakers, of making a fenmeaX 
with potatoes for raising dough, instead of what was termed 
" quarter-sponges :** — 

^^ To make a yeast-gaUon of this composition, such yeast- 
gallon containing 8 beer-quarts, boil in common water 8 lbs. 
of potatoes, as for eating : bruise them perfectly smooth, and 
mix with them, while warm, 2 oz. of fine honey, and 1 beer- 
quart of common yeast. For making bread, mix 3 beer-pints 
of the above composition with a bushel of flour, using warm 
water in making the bread : the water to be warmer in winter 
than in summer, and the composition to be used in a few 
hours after it is made ; and so soon as the sponge, or 
the mixture of the composition with the flour, begins to 
fall the first time, the bread should be made and put into the 



oven." 



Persons who are in the habit of making their own bread 
can easily manu&cture their own yeast, by attending to the 
following directions : — 

Boil 1 lb. of good flour, i lb. of brown sugar, and ^ oz. of 
salt, in 2 gallons of water for an hour ; when nearly cold, 
bottle it, and cork it close, and it will be fit for use in 24 
hours. 1 pint will make 18 lbs. of bread. 



Chap. XXVIII.] YEAST AND OVEN. 577 



THE OVEN. 

806. — For the baking of bread there can be no doubt the 
fire-proof brick oven is the best. 

It should be round, not long ; the roof from 20 to 24 inches 
high, the mouth small, and the door of iron to shut close. 
This construction will save firing and time, and bake better 
than long and high-roofed ovens. 

Brick ovens are also the best for baking all kinds of large 
cakes and pies ; the reason of which is chiefly owing to their 
being generally capable of retaining the heat a much longer 
time than one built of iron ; unless, indeed, when the latter 
happens to be very substantially made of wrought iron. When 
this is the case, they serve all the purposes for a private 
family. We have had one in constant use for the last 30 years ; 
it is set separately from the kitchen fire, and occupies no more 
space than a small boiler would. Four tins, being made to fit 
in without touching the sides, will hold each a loaf of 4 lbs. 
A fire-proof tile should be placed under the tins to prevent 
the bread burning at the bottom, and, when half done, the 
loaves should be changed, the front ones to the back, as there 
will be the greatest heat : the fire is under the oven, and, 
after having been once lighted, should be supplied only by 
cinders, wetted, and a small quantity of small coal mixed with 
them. 

For the baking of pastry, light bread, rolls, and breakfast- 
cakes, the iron ovens fixed in the usual kitchen ranges have 
the advantage of requiring but little fire, and enabling the 
cook to regulate its temperature, so as to increase or diminish 
its power ; but a still better may be found in the French move- 
able oven, for which see No. 770. 

MAKING BREAD. 

807. — Put the necessary quantity of good flour — say ^ 
bushel — into a kneading-trough, or broad earthen pan, and 
make a large hole in the middle of the heap. Have ready a 
quart of warm water and stir it into a pint of brewers' yeast, 
or, if home-made, a larger quantity ; then pour it through 
a sieve into the hole, and, with a large wooden spoon, work 
it round so as to bring it to a batter of moderate toughness, 
and, when that is done, sprinkle over it a large handful of 
flour, so as to commence what is called '^ setting the sponge ;" 

1^ 



678 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVllL 

then cover it with a cloth or board, and leave it to rise in a 
warm place : the qiong^e will rise enough in the course of 2 
hours. When it has risen so high as to crack the flour on the 
top, put i lb. of salt into a quart of water a little warmer 
than new milk ; let the salt be thoroughly melted, or it is 
liable to settle in lumps, which would spoil the bread : pour 
this water into the batter, and mix it well before taking in 
any of the flour, as this ensures the bread being uniformly 
light ; then prepare another jug of water to use if wanted. 
That done, knead the dough well, turning it over, pressing it, 
folding it, and working it thoroughly with your clenched 
hands, for at least i an hour, or until it becomes light as 
well as stiff, and until all the flour is worked up. When done, 
the dough should be of such a consistency as not to stick to 
the hand. Remember that the goodness of the bread will 
greatly dq)end on the kneading, which requires both strength 
and practice. If baked in an iron oven, the dough should at 
once be rolled up and put into the tins, leaving it to rise in 
a warm place till nearly at the top of the tins, which should 
then at once be placed in the oven. A loaf of 4 lbs. will take 
about 2 hours to bake it If the oven is well set it will be 
sufliciently heated during the time the bread is being made : 
dredge a little flour in ; if it changes colour it is hot enough. 

The loaves may be made of any form and size you please : 
for a small family, the i quartern, or 2 lb. loaf, is the most 
convenient, but the full quartern is the most common, and, 
in large establishments, where household bread is used, peck 
loaves are not unusual. The bread, if unexposed to the air, 
and kept in earthen, closely-covered pans, in a cool spot, will 
remain sufliciently fresh for a week, and any appearance of 
staleness may be removed by slightly damping the outside of 
the loaf, and putting it for a short time into the oven. 

If the oven be of brick, it should be heated by faggots, and 
will be sufflciently hot in about 4 hours ; when the dough is 
ready, clear out the ashes, and sweep the floor clean for its 
reception. If necessary to lessen the heat, take an old broom, 
dip it in water, and hold it in the oven, twirling it round un- 
til it becomes dry. Try the heat of the bottom by throwing 
in some flour ; and if it scorches or turns black, do not ven- 
ture to put in the bread till the oven has had time to become 
cooler. 

When the loaves are put in the oven close up the door, 



Chap. XXVIII.] BREAD. 579 

and do not open it more than once or twice, for a moment, 
just to see how the process is going on. The loaves will take 
from 2i to 3 hours baking, or more if their size be large ; 
and, as a portion of the dough is frequently made up into 
rolls or twists, they must, of course, be removed earlier. 

Cottage-breadj if meant for the breakfest-table, is better 
baked in tins ; and if made with a portion of milk, will be 
more delicate ; but milk used in household-bread will be apt 
in a few days to turn it sour. 

In the making of either sort, if a tenth or a twelfth part of 
potato-flour be employed, it will improve their lightness and 
colour ; and if, in the mixing of the dough, bran be boiled in 
the water used in making it, it will be found to impart a fine 
flavour of com to the bread. Not only will this be the fact, 
but it has been calculated that if 5 lbs. of bran be boiled in 
water, then strained off, and the water used in kneading 56 
lbs. of flour with the usual quantity of salt and yeast, the 
dough will weigh about 94 lbs. 13 oz. ; or 8 lbs. 10 oz. more 
than if kneaded with pure water. 

Family Bread. — A sack of good flour weighing 280 lbs. 
ought to produce on an average rather more than 360 lbs. of 
excellent white bread, if well kneaded and properly baked, 
and that without any other addition ; though a little soda, or 
a very small quanti^ of magnesia, will assist in enabling the 
dough to rise, and thus increase the lightness of the bread ; 
but alum, though it improves the colour, will occasion it to 
dry up sooner ; bakers who make the best bread, indeed, rarely 
use it, and then only in case of some discoloration in the 
flour, which, if good and well dressed, produces bread suflfi- 
ciently white without any foreign admixture whatever. 

FERMENTED AND UNFERMENTED BREAD, 

808. — The attention of the public, and economists in par- 
ticular, has, within the last few years, been directed towards 
the method of making unfermented bread ; and its supposed 
superiority over fermented bread has been much extolled in a 
pamphlet lately published by " A Physician,"* who estimates 
the loss in weight by this decomposition to be, in the London 
bread, 13 per cent. ; and, according to M. Dumas, as quoted 

* See also a small pamphlet ' On the Philosophy of Bread-making/ pub-

In the Ber. Mr. Haggetfs Beomomdeai Bread, oofy ^ 
coaxae flake bran is to be removed firom the floor : of this bna 
take 5 lbs., and bofl it in rather more than 4 gallons of water, 
so that when perfectly smooth jou maj have 3 gaDons and 3 
quarts of bran-water clear. With this knead 56 lbs. of the 
floor, adding salt and yeast in the same way and jnoportioDS 
as for other bread. When ready to bake, divide it into loaves 
and bake them 2i hours. 

We do not, however, uphold this mode so much on the 
principle of economy, as on that of the quality of the bread 
made with water in which bran has been boiled, as we know 
from long experience that wheaten bread made in this manner 
always has a sweeter taste of com than when made from 
pure water. 

Maize JBread. — ^Take an equal quantity of the meal of 
maize and wheaten flour. Set a sponge first with three parts 
of the wheaten flour, the requisite quantity of yeast, wann 
water, and salt. Whilst this is rising, mix the maize-meal 
up with water, and boil it over the fire, keeping it well stirred 
till it comes to the consistence of paste, and let it cool. When 
the sponge has risen to its greatest height, and begins to drop 
or sink down again, then add the meal paste ; mix and knead 
them both well together, using the rest of the wheaten flour 
left from the sponge in the kneading with a suflicient quantity 
of water to make the whole of a proper consistence. Put the 
dough into a pan, cover it with a thick cloth or flannel, and 
Jet it remain in a warm place or before the fire to prove for

1^ or 2 hours, then divide it into loaves and bake. The 
maize, liaving no gluten in it, can only be rendered in any 
degree light by a large admixture of wheaten flour. 

Rye-bread may be made in the same manner as wheaten, 
and if both be mixed, as meslin, it has a very agreeable 
flavour, approaching to acidity. The grain, though dark- 
coloured, and the flour very brown, yet forms excellent bread 
at half the price of that made of wheat, and very far superior 
to that of maize. It is, indeed, the only bread consumed by 
the peasantry of Germany, who form as healthy a population 
as is found in any part of Europe.

ROLLS, BREAKFAST-CAKES, &c. 

ROLLS. 

809. — French Rolls are usually made by the bakers, but in 
country houses, where families bake their own bread, they 
may be done in either of the following ways : — 

Sift 1 lb. of flour, and rub into it 2 oz. of butter ; mix in 
the whites only of 3 eggs beaten to a froth, and a tablespoon- 
ful of strong yeast ; to which add enough of milk, with a little 
salt, to make a stifl* dough, and set it, covered, before the 
fire to rise — which will take about an hour ; and, if cut into 
small rolls, and put into a quick oven, will be done in little 
more than 10 minutes. 

Or : — Take i peck of the very finest flour, 1 oz. of butter 
melteii in milk and water : mix with it 2 or 3 spoonfuls of 
yeast, according to its strength, and strain it through a hair 
sieve ; whisk the white of an egg and work it into a light 
paste, add salt, and leave it all night. Then work it up well 
again, and make it into rolls. 

English Rolls. — Sift 1 lb. of flour into a pan, and mix 
with it a small teaspoonful of salt. Warm a gill of milk 
and water ; make a hole in the middle of the flour and put 
into it a gill of brewer's yeast, making it all into a thin 
batter, which must be stirred until quite free from lumps : 
then strew a handful of flour over it ; set it in a warm place, 
and leave it to rise, which will take 2 hours or more ; let it, 



582 MODERN DOMESTIC COOEERT. [Chap. XXVni. 

however, remain until it has cracked on the top, and then 
make it into a dough with more milk and water. Knead it 
well fi>r 10 minutes, cover it, and set it again to Tjse for 20 
minutes longer. Tlien form the dough into small rolls, bake 
them, and send them to table hot 

Or: — ^To 2 lbs. of flour well dried, and 1 pint of water 
milk-warm, put 3 spoonfuls of yeast: then knead in 2 oz. of 
fresh butter and a little salt, and wori^ all well together. The 
oven must be very quick, and i of an hour will bake them ; 
the doug^ should make 12 rolls. 

Or : — li lb. of flour, a pint of milk, 1 egg^ and 2 q>oonfuls 
of yeast, well mixed and set before the fire to rise, ^nU make 
still nicer rolls, and 20 minutes will bake than. They should 
be served hot, cut in 3, buttered, put together again, and 
covered when brought to table. 

BOCKS. 

810. — Take a loaf that is half-baked, pull it apart, and with 
2 forks tear the crumb into bits about the size of a walnut ; 
lay them on a tin and return them to the oven, and bake of a 
light brown. A loaf made for the purpose with milk and a 
little butter makes them nicer. A sweet cake pulled in this 
way is very good. 

BREAKFAST-CAKES. 

811. — Muffins. — Take 2 eggs, 2 spoonfuls of new yeast,, 
and a little salt. Mix a little warm new milk and water ioto 
a quart of flour. Beat all well together, and let it stand 
to rise. Bake them for about 20 minutes, imtil of a *light 
brown, either on a hot iron, or in shallow tin pans in a Dutch 
oven. When to be brought to table, toast them slightly <»i 
both sides, but not in the middle : then notch them round the 
centre, and pull them open with your fingers, without using 
a knife, and butter them. 

Crumpets. — ^Beat 2 eggs very well, put to them a quart of 
warm milk and water, and a large spoonful of yeast ; beat in 
as much fine flour as will make them rather thicker than a 
common batter pudding ; then make the stove hot, or the iron 
cover of a bain-marie very hot, and rub it with a little butter 
wrapped in a clean linen cloth ; pour a large spoonful of the 



Ohap. XX VIII.] BREAKFAST-CAKES. 583 

batter upon the iron, and let it run within a ring to the 
size of a teasaucer ; turn them with the elastic blade of an old 
table-knife ; and when you want to use them, toast them very 
quickly, but not too crisply, and butter them. 

A Sally-Lunn^ when eaten hot and well buttered, is a very 
favourite accompaniment of the break&st or tea table, and 
may be made in either of these ways : — 

Into 1 pint of flour rub a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut, a little salt, and a little yeast. Let it rise ^ an hour 
before the fire. Then mix it with 2 eggs, and if not enough 
add a little milk; knead the dough well, and let it stand 
some minutes before the fire ; after which, make this quan- 
tity into 5 cakes and have them slack-baked, as they must 
be well warmed in a Dutch oven before being toasted for 
table. 

Or : — Put 1 oz. of butter into almost a pint of new milk, 
and make it blood-warm. Beat up 3 eggs well, add to them 3 
spoonfuls of good barm, and put in a little salt. Have 3 lbs. 
of fine flour well dried, pour in the above ingredients, and beat 
it up to the consistency of French bread. Lay it to sponge 
for 2 hours. Then pour it into a cake-pan. An hour will 
bake it. 

A very good breakfast cake may also be made with i lb. of 
flour, 1 oz. of butter, and an eggy made into a paste with a 
spoonful of milk and a very little salt : let it rise before the 
fire, and bake it quickly. Cut it in half, while quite hot, and 
butter it. It is commonly called " Yorkshire cake," but 
whep strongly impregnated with saffiron, mixed with a small 
quantity of sugar, it is very commonly used in Bath and in 
Dublin as " Saffron cake." 

In America bucktoheat-cakes are in great vogue as a break- 
hst delicacy, and, according to Miss L^lie's receipt, are made 
thus: — 

^^ Take a quart of buckwheat meal, mix with it a teaspoonful 
of salt, and add — if you have it — a handful of Indian meal ; 
pour a large tablespoonful of the best brewers' yeast into the 
centre of the meal ; then mix it gradually with cold water till 
it becomes a batter. Cover it, put it in a warm place, and set 
it to rise : it will take about 3 hours. When it is quite light, 
and covered with bubbles, it is fit to bake. Put your griddle 



684 MODERN DOMESTIC GOOEERT. [Chap. XXVUi. 

over the fire and let it get quite hot before you begin. GrenBe 
it wdl with a piece of butter tied in a rag. Tl^ dip out a 
laige ladleful of the batter and bake it on the griddle, turning 
it with a broad wooden paddle. Let the cakes be of large 
gize, and even at the edges. Butter them as you take them 
off the griddle ; put several on a plate, and cut them across 
in 6 pieces. Grease the griddle anew between baking each 
cake. 

'^ If your batter has been mixed over night, and is found to 
be sour in the morning, melt in warm water a piece of pearl- 
ash the size of a gpmin of com, or a little larger ; stir it into 
the batter, let it set for ^ an hour, and then bake it. The 
pearlash will remove the sour taste, and increase the lightness 
of the cakes.^ 

In Shrewsbury they are made thus :— Take a quart or 3 
pints of lukewarm water ; put it into an earthen jar ; add a 
small portion of salt and a common teacupful of yeast. Then 
stir in the buckwheat flour until it becomes a thick batter, 
cover it, and set it to rise. When light, and in a state of 
fermentation, take a fiying-pan, the inside rubbed with butter 
or good lard; then place in the frying-pan 3 or 4 table- 
spoonfuls of the batter in each cake, until there are as many 
as the pan will contain. A few minutes over a quick fire will 
suffice to cook them in the same manner as the common pan- 
cake ; and when sufficiently cooked, butter them while quite 
hot, and serve them for breakfast. Buckwheat dressed in this 
manner will be foimd excellent and very wholesome, but it 
does not answer in any other way. The batter takes 3 or 4 
hours to rise. • 

Johnny Cahes, — Sift a quart of wheaten flour, or com meal, 
into a pan ; make a hole in the middle, and pour in a pint of 
warm water. Mix the meal and water gradually into a batter, 
adding a teaspoonful of salt ; beat it very quickly, and for a 
long time, till it becomes quite light ; then spread it thick and 
even on a stout piece of smooth board ; place it upright on the 
hearth before a clear fire, with something to support the board 
behind, and bake it well ; cut it into squares, and split and 
butter them hot. 

They may also be made with a quart of milk, 3 eggs, 1 
teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, and 1 teacupful of wheaten 
flour ; add Indian com meal sufficient to make a batter like 



Chap. XXVin.] BREAKFAST-CAKES. 585 

that of pancakes, and either bake it in buttered pans, or upon 
a griddle, and eat them with butter.^ 

Paste Cake, — In Ireland breakfast-cakes are baked on a 
griddle, or flat iron, placed on trivets over a cinder or turf 
fire, and the cake imder the above title is there composed 
of flour and butter, just in the same manner as for a pie-crust, 
and therefore made as rich or as plain as you like. The paste 
is made a full inch thick, usually to the circumference of a 
dinner-plate. It is then placed upon the griddle, twice turned 
until done, when it is served hot, then divided and buttered, 
as each person may please. It is a very delicious but indi- 
gestible appendage to break&st. 

Slim-^ake is made simply of flour and milk, without butter, 
and baked in the same manner as the above, but always eaten 
cold, with butter. 

TOAST AND BUTTER. 

In the making of dry and buttered toast there should be 
this difference : — Dry toast should be cut very thin, and held 
at a distance from the fire to render it crisp ; while buttered 
toast should not only be cut rather thick and placed near to 
the fire, to keep soft, but, for that purpose, held for a minute 
or two over a bowl of boiling water to imbibe the steam before 
being buttered. The toast should always be buttered on both 
sides, and the crusts cut off". Ji fresh butter be used, it must 
be accompanied with a muffineer, to salt it, but most people 
prefer the flavour of really good salt butter. 

812. — Take 2 lbs. of fine flour, after being gently warmed 
before the fire, and rub into it i pint of warm mealy potatoes. 
When well mixed, add a proper quantity of yeast and salt 
with warm milk and water suflficient to make into dough, 
which must be allowed 2^ hours to rise before being formed 
into a loaf: which put into a tin to preserve its shape, and 
when placed in the oven take care that it be not over- 
browned.^ 

On this. Dr. Hunter, from whom we copy the above, ob- 
serves, "that the lovers of toast and butter will be much

pleased with this kind of bread. The potato is not here 
added with a view to economy, but to increase the lightness of 
the breads in which state it will imbibe the butter with more 
freedom.^ 



SAVOURY DISHES FOR BREAKFAST. 

GRILLADES, 

813. — Perhaps there b no better grill for breakfiist than a 
cold blade-hone of muttony off which the greater part of the 
meat has been already cut. The remaining parts ^ould then 
be scored, and the gashes filled with a mixture of mustard, 
cayenne, common pepper, and salt, as for a devil: it should 
then be put upon the gridiron, and well browned, but not 
burnt. It may be sent to table dry, without any sauce, or 
served with g^vy mixed with capers. 

The bones of cold fowl of all kinds are also frequently 
brought thus to break&st. 

Broiled Chicken. — Get it undressed, split it open, pepper 
it only on the inside, put it on the gridiron over a moderate 
fire, and when perfectiy done on boSi sides serve it up quite 
hot, just touched over with a very little butter, and accom- 
panied with broiled mushrooms. 

Another broil, — Put thin slices of well-seasoned kidney and 
bacon, with beef or mutton also if you please, upon skewers. 
Have ready fine bread-crumbs, with a slight grating of lemon, 
brush them over with e^, and roll them in the crumbs. 
Hang up the skewers to roast in a toaster, and put a slice of 
toast under it to secure the gravy : when served, carefiilly 
remove the skewers, and place the '^ kabobs " on the toast ; 
but, if only a quantity sufficient to help one person be put 
on each skewer, then do not remove them. 

If, instead of meat, an oyster be put between each slice of 
bacon and kidney, it will be found very superior. 

As to bloaters a.nd ^nnan-haddock, they are too well known 
to need any description ; dried salmon is likewise a good 
relish ; nor is a fresh mackerel^ split open and broiled, to be 
despised. 

Steaks or a grill may be easily and quickly cooked by means

of a few sheets of waste paper only in the " conjurer." Take 
off the cover and place the meat with a small piece of butter 
under it. Insert the lighted paper 
in the opening at the bottom, and 
in 8 or 10 minutes a moderate sized 
steak will be done. This is a par- 
ticularly useful machine to young 
men whose hours are irregular, as 
there is a kettle fitted to the top 
by which a pint of water may be 
boiled by the same means in a few 
minutes. The machine costs only a 
few shillings. A Conjurer. 

TOASTS, 

814. — German Toast, — Take the remainder of any fricassee 
or ragoQt ; any quantity will do : chop it finely, add a little 
chopped parsley, and a little bit of shalot or chive : mix it 
up with 1 or 2 ^gs beaten, according to the quantity. Put 
the whole with its gravy into a stewpan, and let it reduce and 
thicken on the fire. Let it remain until it is cold, then cut 
pieces of bread, toast them : lay the mixture thickly upon 
them. Boil an egg hard, cut it into small pieces, and stick 
them on the top ; brush the whole with egg beaten up, sift 
bread-crumbs over, and bake them in the oven ; squeeze a 
little lemon-juice on the top. This makes also a good comer 
dish for dinner. 

Vegetable Toast. — Take any stewed vegetable, and make 
it into a puree. Add a little more seasoning, mix it up with 
the yolk of an egg, and, if too thin, reduce and thicken it 
over the fire, then spread it upon toast, brush it over with 
beaten egg, add bread-crumbs or vermicelli, and fry or bake 
them. 

Anchovy Toast. — Make a well-buttered toast of brown 
bread, if you can get it ; scale and bone a proper number of 
anchovies, with little or no washing; cut them into broad 
slices, and place them upon the toast, seasoning it with mustard, 
without pepper. 

Or : — ^Butter a round of toast, wash and bone 8 anchovies, 
chop them fine, add a bit of butter the size of a walnut, and a 
moderate quantity of cayenne ; work the whole into a paste, 



588 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXVIIL 

spread it over the toast, and hold it before the fire until it is 
warm through. 

Sausage Toast, — Make a toast, fiy 2 or 3 sausages ; when 
quite hot, strip off the skins and spread the meat upon the 
toast, which should not only be made, if possible, of brown 
bread, but also buttered with salt butter; season it with a 
little pepper and mustard. It will be improved hj a grating 
of Gruyere, Parmesan, or old Cheshire cheese. 

Kidney Toast. — ^Take a cold veal kidney, with a part of the 
fat, cut it into very small pieces ; pound the fiit in a mortar 
with a little salt, white pepper, and an onion previously boiled. 
Bind all together with Uie beaten whites of eg^. Heap it 
upon toast, cover the whole with the yolks beaten, dredge with 
bread-crumbs, and bake in the oven. 

Ham Toast* — Grate or pound the cold ham ; toast and butts' 
a slice of bread ; mix the ham with the yolk of an ^g and a 
little cream, until it is thick and rich ; warm it over the fire, 
and serve it very hot upon the toast. Tongue may be em- 
ployed in the same way. 

Scotch Woodcock, — ^Toast and butter 3 or 4 slices of bread 
on both sides ; take 9 or 10 anchovies, washed, scraped, and 
chopped fine, and put them between the slices of bread. Beat 
the yolks of 4 eggs in i pint of cream, and set it on the fire 
to thicken, but not to boil. Then pour it over the toast, and 
send it to table as hot as possible. This may, however, be 
diminished at pleasure ; as one slice of bread of a moderate 
sized loaf, 1 e^^, and 2 or 3 anchovies, may be sufi&cient. 

SHEEP'S RUMPS AND KIDNEYS, 

815. — Boil the rumps in gravy, and lard the kidneys with 
bacon ; set them, along with the rumps, before the fire in a 
small tin oven, rubbing them at the same time with yolk of 
e^ and a little cayenne and nutmeg. When of a light brown, 
dish them up, either dry or with any pungent sauce, and 
garnish them with green parsley. 

Or : — Stew them until tender, then put them for a few 
minutes into a pan with 2 or 3 oz. of boiled rice seasoned with 
ketchup or mushroom powder, and give a light boil, with 2 
large spoonfuls of good cream or milk thickened with fiour 
and butter. Lay the rumps in the centre of the rice, putting 



Chap. XXVIII.] SAVOURY DISHES FOR BREAKFAST. 589 

i a kidney between each rump. A pretty garnish is either red 
cabbage or barberries. 

DEVILS.— E. JR. 

816. — Of Biscuits, — Butter thin "captain's biscuits" on 
both sides, or oil them with a feather ; sprinkle cayenne pepper 
on the top, and send them to be grilled. This may be varied 
by the addition of chopped anchovies, or the essence, diavolo 
paste, or Chetney. 

Or : — Make a slice of cheese into a paste with made mus- 
tard, and lay it upon one side. « 

A dry Devil. — Take the liver, gizzard, drumstick, and side- 
bones of a fowl or turkey ; score them ; lay on made mustard 
very thickly, and add a quantity of cayenne pepper and salt, 
and broil them. 

A wet Devil, — Take any part of a turkey, goose, or fowl, 
cover it with mustard, Chetney, diavolo paste, or any other 
piquant condiment ; put a dessertspoonful of cayenne pepper, 
one of pounded white sugar, the juice of a lemon, a glass of 
wine, and a glass of ketchup, to a teacupful of gravy ; heat 
them together, pour over the devilled fowl, and send up very hot. 

A little cold fresh butter will cool the mouth, should the 
grill prove too powerful. 

DEVILLED GAME. 

817. — Split a woodcock, a snipe, a wild duck, or any other 
game that is underdone. To a teaspoonful of salt add a 
dessertspoonful of cayenne pepper with a tablespoonful of 
curry-powder, and wet the whole with French mustard. Cover 
the birds both inside and out with this mixture. Take out the 
brains when the head is split, and, if a woodcock, add the trail ; 
make them into a paste with the yolk of a ha^-boiled egg^ 
i a blade of pounded mace, a saltspoonful of grated lemon- 
peel, and season it with essence of anchovies, ketchup, or 
other sauce ; then add a glass of wine, a teaspoonful of cayenne 
pepper, a dessertspoonful of pounded white sugar, and the 
juice of a lemon or of a Seville orange. Roll a bit of butter, 
the size of a walnut, in flour ; put the birds and the sauce into 
a metal dish over a lamp, cover it close, shake it about occa- 
sionally, and when it has stewed until the greater part of the 
sauce has been imbibed, serve it round. The legs of fowls, 
geese, and turkeys, may be devilled the same way. 



590 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap, XXVHI. 

Or : — Mix equal parts of fine salt, cayenne pepper, and 
cuny-powder, with double the quantity of powder of truffles. 
Dissect a woodcock or any bird in season, rather under roasted, 
and powder the whole with the mixture ; crush the trail and 
brains along with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, the grated 
peel of a lemon, i a spoonful of Chetney sauce, and a little soy ; 
then add a tablespoonful of ketchup, a wineglass of Madeira, 
and the juice of i a Seville orange. Throw this sauce, along 
with the bird, into a silver stewdlsh, to be heated with spirits 
of wine ; cover close up, light the lamp, and keep gently sim- 
mering until the flesh is completely saturated ; then pour in a 
small quantity of salad-oil, and serve it round instantly, as it 
may be prepared at the table, and should be eaten hot.* 

MUSTARD, 

818. — No savoury things are ever brought to table without 
this indispensable accompaniment, the best of which — DurJuim 
— may be had in a pure state at Apothecaries* Hall. 

In making it, pure water is most generally used, with a 
pinch of salt and sugar, though both are frequently omitted ; 
but a much better mode for preserving it, as well as adding to 
it a good flavour, is to make it of water in which horseradish 
has been boiled. This costs no trouble ; for if the horseradish 
be scraped and put in a teacup with boiling water poured upon 
it and covered, the infusion will be strong enough in little 
more than i an hour. 

The Parisian mustard, known as moutarde de maille, is 
however much in vogue among gastronomists, as possessing a 
finer pungency of flavour, and may be imitated by mixing up 
the flour and a little fine salt with salad oil, so as to form a 
thick paste, then diluting it to a certain degree with equal 
quantities of the vinegars of horseradish, tarragon, chili, and 
garlic ; or sufficient of each to please the palate. Cayenne 
should never be used, and even chili vinegar but sparingly. 

SAND WICHES 

819. — Require more care than is usually bestowed on them, 
for this reason, that every one believes he can cut sandwiches. 
Where any quantity is required the bread should be made on 
purpose, and the baker should be desired to bake it in tins, 

* Es«ayft on Good Living. 



Chap. XXVIII.] SAVOUEY DISHES FOB BREAKFAST. 591 

and either add a little butter to it or prove it well before it is 
put into the tins, so that it should not be full of holes, as in 
that case too much butter is used, and the sandwich becomes 
disagreeable from being greasy. Cut the bread moderately 
thin, butter it very slightly indeed, lay the meat cut thin, 
season with salt, pepper, and mustard, ss may be required ; 
cover with a second slice of bread, trim the edges, put them 
one on the other, and cover with a damp cloth until wanted. 

Where tongue is used it should be boiled the day before, 
and, when thoroughly done, pressed in the mould in which the 
bread is to be baked. 

Chickens boned, and farced with a small quantity of farce 
of veal and ham, and treated in the same way, will make 
excellent sandwiches.

CHAPTER XXIX. 



COFFEE, TEA, AMD CHOCOLATE. 

820. — ^Either cofiee, tea, or chocolate, fiyrms the constant 
foundation of our Engli^ breakfast; and the two fiHrmer 
are also such a common evening refreshment that it would be 
unpardonable to pass them over without remark. 

Formerly coffee was hardly ever seen at the break&st-table 
in England, and was, indeed, only rarely brought forward 
in the evening, except for a party, and along with tea. It 
was also then made insufferably weak— consequently bad — 
and without any knowledge either of the proper mode of pre- 
paring it, or care for the original quality of the berry ; which 
ought to be rather pale in colour, sinall in size, and of a 
roundish form. 

Nothing can be more grateful to the stomach, or more 
favourable to digestion, than a cup of good strong coffee 
— or, as the French call it, cafi noir — soon after dinner ; and 
if it be followed by a small glass of liqueur, as chasse cafe, it 
will be found equally agreeable to the palate. Still, however, 
there is much to be learned respecting the best mode of pre- 
paring it ; and as this is more scientificiedly done in Paris than 
in London, we here offer a few directions on the subject. 

Independently of the mode of making, the coffee should 
be of good quality, or the flavour will suffer in proportion to 
its inferiority. The Mocha is the best, and the Java good ; 
but the sorts most commonly used in this country are the 
Jamaica and the Berbice, which are both excellent when well 
chosen and imdamaged. 

To this must be added the age to which it should be kept : 
for, if used soon after being gathered, it has an unpleasant 
coarseness of flavour. In those countries where it is grown 
it is seldom used until 3 years old ; and if older will be all 
the better. It should always be exposed to the air, and kept 
very dry. The best mode is, to buy it raw, and keep it for a 



Chap. XXIX.] COFFEE. 593 

long time — even years — ^without using it ; only roasting it at 
the time it is wanted ; and that operation should be performed 
by Orpwood^s roasting machine^ which is fixed on the bars of 
a grate, and roasts i lb. of coffee without trouble, and with 
great regularity, in less than ^ of an hour : it is far superior 
to the coffee-roaster which is heated by a lamp. 

The roasted berries should then be put into a bag of flannel 
to cool and prevent the escape of the aroma ; after which grind 
them. If not used soon after it is ground, the powder should 
be wrapped up and put before the fire or in the oven to get hot. 
When the berry has been roasted at the grocer's, it should be 
warmed before it is ground. 

The French mode of mahing. — As much of the powder 
should be used as one to every 3 cups of the liquid to be 
made, and placed in the upper part of the common French 
machine, called a grecqite, which may be got for a mere trifle 
at any of the tin-shops. It is merely a coffee-pot with an 
upper receptacle made to fit close into it, the bottom of which 
is perforated with holes, and containing in its interior 2 
moveable metal strainers, over the second of which the coffee 
is to be placed, and immediately under the third ; upon the 
upper strainer pour boiling water, until it bubbles up through 
the strainer; then shut the cover close down, place it near 
the fire, or upon the hob of a parlour-grate ; and so soon as 
the water is drained through the coffee, repeat the operation 
imtil the whole intended quantity is passed. The top of the 
machine may then be removed, and the coffee may be served 
in the pot in which it has been made, or in any other, only 
taking care that it shall first be warmed with hot water, and 
that the coffee itself be brought up strictly hot. 

This is the true Parisian method^ and it requires neither 
isinglass nor clearings of any description, as it will come to 
table quite transparent. 

A patent has, however, lately been taken out under the title 
of " Platow's Automaton Coffee Urn," which perfectly clarifies 
the coffee, and can be made an elegant appendage to the table 
(see cut No. 1). If the upper vessel is made of glass, it is then 
an interesting process to make the coffee in the drawing-room, 
instead of having it made in the kitchen, which, for some reason 
or other, very seldom sends out a good cup of coffee. It is 
heated by a spirit lamp. The coffee-pot shown in cut No. 2 is

One great art in making coffee is to use a sufficient quantity 
of the powder ; for, if not strong, the aroma of its flavour is 
lost, in proportion to its state of weakness. 

Foreigners seldom drink more than 1 small cup of coffee 
after dinner, and that always without either milk or cream ; 
but as most English people like a mixture of the latter, the 
milk — if cream cannot be had — should always be boiled and 
used hot, in a much larger quantity than cream ; but cream 
better preserves the flavour of the coffee. 



Chap. XXIX.] TEA. 595 

Milk Coffee is an excellent breakfast, and, as its name im- 
plies, is generally composed of \ milk and \ coffee : the coffee 
is msule in the same manner as for after dinner; the boiling 
milk may, however, be afterwards added according to fancy. 
If the yolk of a raw e^ be well mixed up with i a pint of 
the milk, it will materially add to the richness of the coffee ; 
but soft sugar should then be used ; whereas the best refined 
lump or powdered sugar-candy should be taken in that which 
is to be drunk pure. Even for milk-coffee, always make the 
coffee itself as strong as in the French mode ; and weaken it 
as you please with milk. Should the plan be adopted of each 
person mixing the milk and coffee according to their taste, an 
excellent utensil would be that of a small tea-urn, divided in 
the centre of its interior, to separate the liquids, but equally 
communicating the warmth of the heater : it must have the 
addition of a cock on each side. 

As to the liquid essence of coffee^ the best sort is not a bad 
substitute, in a hurry, for that made in a proper way ; but it is 
not nearly so good. 

Mocha coffee can only be found at the shops of g^rocers of 
eminence, though every petty dealer puts off what he calls 
'' Turkey coffee," as being the same. 

If you cannot roast the berries, at least grind them yourself, 
to prevent the imposition of a mixture. 

If induced by its cheapness to buy low-priced coffee, the 
coarseness of its flavour may be improved by the addition of a 
small quantity of chicory powder, at the rate of a couple of 
ounces to the pound. 



TEA. 

821. — Tastes differ regarding the flavour of various sorts of 
tea : some preferring all black ; others, all green ; and many, 
a mixture of both in different quantities ; though most persons 
— ^when not fearful of their nerves — agree that fine Hyson is 
the best. A good mixture, in point of flavour, we Imow to 
be — i black, 4 green, and -J gunpowder : all being, of course, 
of superior quality. 

Presuming all ladies to be intimately acquainted with the 
mode of making tea, yet, to some, a few hints on the subject 
may not perhaps be found objectionable.

and not allowed to stand upon it more than three or 4 minutes, 
when it should be poured into the other teapot, and served firom

that. If the party is large this process must be repeated. By 
this means all the tea will be of equal strength, and you get 
the fine aromatic flavour without the injurious matter. We 
have for some time made tea in this way, and very much 
approve it. It certainly approaches nearer to the method 
adopted amongst the Chinese, who have water poured upon 
the tea in the teacup^ and in some parts of India the tea is 
enclosed in a perforated silver e^^ which is put into the pot, 
and taken out when the infusion is sufficiently strong. 



CHOCOLATE, 

822. — If made thin, is not worth drinking ; and that which 
is now commonly sold by the grocers is a compound of flour, 
or some farinaceous substance, and coarse sugar or treacle, 
together with a very moderate quantity of real cocoa, and that 
of the most inferior quality, coloured with Venetian red and 
brown ochre. If you mean to have really good chocolate y you 
must, therefore, pay a far higher price than is paid for the 
trash to which we have alluded. That made in Florence has 
long been celebrated, and there has been for many years a 
large manufactory established near Paris by one Menier, 
which has a very high reputation there ; having tried it, we 
can also recommend it, and it can be had in London, either of 
Messrs. Dakin and Co., St. Paul's Churchyard ; or Hedges 
and Butler, 155, Regent Street. 

It forms the common break&st throughout Spain, and, when 
manufactured, is there made by merely chipping a portion of 
the cake into which it is formed from the cocoa, leaving the 
chips in water for a whole night to soften. It may then be 
slowly warmed, along with either water or milk, working it 
all the time with the mill, which is a small moveable pole 
passed through the lid of a chocolate-pot, and furnished with 
a headpiece in order to mix the chocolate equally by turning 
the mUl rapidly between the hands and without intermission, 
thus to prevent it from becoming clotty ; care, however, should 
be taken not to let it boil; for, in that case, the vegetable oil 
which is contained in the nut will be extracted from it and 
appear on the surface. The flavour is better retained by 
making it in water than milk. 



598 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXK. 

It is always made very thick, so tliat a small spoon will 
nearly stand upright in it, and nothing eaten with it but a rusk, 
or dry toast : after which there is usually taken a draught of 
cold spring water. 

The usual mode of making it is to boil a pint of water in 
the pot, put to it a cake of chocolate cut into very small slices, 
mill it off the fire till quite melted, then put it on a g-entle fire 
tOl it nearly boils, milling it all the time. Pour it into a basin, 
and it will keep in a cool place for several days. When used 
put a couple of tablespoonfiils of it into milk, warm it with 
sugar, and mill it well. 

COCOA. 

823. — An excellent breakfast beverage may be made by 
simply pounding the nut — which is the substance of choco- 
late — and boiling it in the same manner in either water or 
milk. The best quality is that of Caraccas, which is small, 
very dark-coloured, and appears as if partly mouldy or brdc^ ; 
whfle that usually to be found in the shops is plump and 
glossy, and the patent sort, or paste, still more inferior; it 
being always made firom the cheapest kind, and not unfre- 
quently from that which has been damaged. 

Cocoa Shells or Nibs, or, as they are more appropriately 
called in Ireland, " Miserable," are the thin coverings of the 
cocoa kernel, and can only be had at some chocolate manu- 
factory, where they can be bought at a very low price, and 
form a light food for an invalid, when taken warm. 

Soak tbem in water during the whole night, and then boil 
them in the same water until reduced to i the quantity : they 
should boil 2 hours, and should then be mixed up with milk.

CHAPTER XXX. 



ON ENGLISH WINES AND LIQUEURS. 



ENGLISH WINES. 

824. — English wines may be made very advantageously by 
£imilies who have gardens, as, from the reduced price of sugar, 
they cost but little comparatively with foreign wines, all of 
which pay heavy duties. They should, however, be thoroughly 
fermented, and be made of such strength as to keep sound for 3 
or 4 years, and never be drunk until they are more than a year 
old ; whereas those housewives who look too closely to economy 
weaken them so much with water ajs to cause them soon to 
turn sour. In the south of Europe the grape contains all the 
chemical properties which enable it to undergo complete fer* 
mentatiot), and from which perfect wine can be produced ; but 
the artificial composition of the fluids on which the maker of 
domestic wine in England has to operate makes it advisable 
that a few words should be said upon the subject. The sub- 
stances essential to vinous fermentation are sugar^ vegetable 
extract, the tartaric or malic acids j and water. None of these 
can be dispensed with, and it. is in the balancing of them 
that the art greatly consists. Sugar is the most essential of 
these, as it is &om its decomposition that alcohol is derived. 
The most saccharine juices therefore may be made to produce 
the strongest wine : hence the absolute necessity of adding 
sugar to all English fruit, in which the malic acid so largely 
predominates ; and it is from the judicious mixture of sugar and 
water with this acid that our best native wines are produced, 
as by this only will the process of fermentation be effectually 
carried on. Any one attempting to make wine from the juice 
of currants or gooseberries, or even ripe grapes, alone, would 
at once perceive this. The use of brandy is quite unnecessary 



eOO MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXX. 

if the wine is properly fermented, and it keeps sound much 
better without it. Yeast, also, should never be used in wine 
made of fresh fruit, as, if the proportions are properly ad- 
justed, the fluid will ferment of itsel£ The four following 
receipts we have used and approved for many years, the 
first of which may be taken as a g^de in almost all sorts of 
domestic wine made of fresh fruit — the quantities of course 
varying with the quality of the fruit. If due attention be 
paid, it may almost be said '^ never to fiiiL" The fermen- 
tation requires the greatest care, as on it so much depends. 
If checked too soon the wine is imperfect, and not so whole- 
some. If carried on too far, the acetous stsige commences. It 
is therefore necessary to watch it with g^reat attention. The 
process commences within 24 hours of the mixture being 
made, which is perceived by a slight hissing noise and little 
bubbles rising on the surface. This will increase when put 
into the cask, when it will be so loud that it may be heard at 
some distance, and will continue some weeks. Unless the 
wine is intended to be sweet, it should not be closed up till 
the hissing has very much subsided. If it is intended to be 
dry, and represent foreign wine, it should be drawn off into a 
barrel which has been sulphured. To have it sparkling, the 
scum which rises in fermenting should be allowed to sink in- 
stead of running out, and the barrel bunged up whilst the 
wine still retains a slight tendency to ferment. All wine is 
improved by being racked off, and a little isinglass added — '■ 
about i oz. to 10 gallons. This should be done 2 or 3 months 
before bottling, And not in very hot or very cold weather. 

WINS FROM UNRIPE GRAPES, 

825. — As the stems and husks of grapes give no bad flavour 
to the fruit, it may be used in any stage of ripening, or dif- 
ferent degrees may be mixed together. The fruit is in the 
best state when just beginning to ripen. For every gallon 
take 5 lbs. of fruit; have a tub which will hold 15 or 20 
gallons ; bruise the grapes into this so thoroughly that if pos- 
sible every berry shall be mashed ; when the whole are in, 
stalks and all, add 4 gallons of cold spring-water ; mix all 
well with the hand till the juice and pulp are separated from 
the more solid matter ; cover the tub, and let it stand 24 
hours ; strain it through a coarse bag, and squeeze the fruit 
quite dry ; pour a gallon of water over the solid mass, to get 



Chap. XXX.] ENGLISH WINES. 601 

any soluble matter which may remain. Put into a tub or 
cooler 30 lbs. of loaf-sugar ; pour the fluid upon it, first mea- 
suring it ; make up with water to the total bulk of 10^ gal-* 
Ions ; mix this until the sugar is dissolved. This is called the 
must, and is equivalent to the juice of the grape. Cover up 
the vessel with a board, over which throw a blanket, and let it 
stand in a moderate temperature for 24 hours or more, ac- 
cording as it may appear to begin to ferment. Put it into the 
cask, which should be kept full to the bung-hole, and a little 
inclined to one side to let the scum work off: you have i gal- 
lon oimust for this purpose. There should be a hole near the 
bung which should be stopped with a wooden peg, and when the 
bung is closed up the peg should in a day or two be loosened, 
that the fixed air may have vent : this should be repeated at 
intervals till the excessive expansion hajs ceased, when the peg 
may be driven tight. The best way to keep the bung air-tight 
is to paste a double piece of brown paper over it. Let the wine 
remain in a cool cellar till a clear warm day in January, then 
rack it off, and let it stand to the end of March before bottling. 
It will keep for many years. We have some in our cellar 
made 22 years ago, which is v^ry fine indeed, and perfectly 
sound. If it is a brisk or champagne wine, it will be very 
good the following summer. When racked and clarified, the 
isinglass should be dissolved in a little of the wine, and well 
mixed in the barrel. 

Green Gooseberry Wine may be made in exactly the same 
way. 

ORANGE WINE. 

826. — For 10 gallons take 100 Seville oranges ; peel them 
very thin ; press out the juice, and put it, with 30 lbs. of loaf- 
sugar, into a cask ; put the peel into a deep pan, large enough 
to allow a gallon of cold water to be poured over it ; let this 
stand till the next day, then pour the water over the sugar 
and juice already in the cask ; cover the peel again with water, 
adding it to the cask the next day, and continue to do so until 
the cask is full. Stir it well every day for 2 or 3 weeks, by 
which time it will be in full fermentation, which will continue 
for nearly a couple of months ; after which draw it off, and 
after taking out the lees, and cleaning out the cask with a dry 
cloth, dissolve ^ oz. of isinglass in a little of the wine, stir it 
well in, and bung it up close till the autumn, March being 



602 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEBY. [Chap. XXX. 

the proper moDth to make thu wine in. It will be found very 
convenient to have a second cask to rack wine into, which is 
at once put under the tap, and avoids all splashing flind waste. 
Where the custom is to use casks of the same size, one or two 
extra ones only are required. 

PARSNIP WINE. 

827. — To every g^on of water take d lbs. of fine clear 
parsnips and the same weight of loaf-sugar ; slice the parsnips 
into the water, and let them boil to a pulp; strain th^n 
through a hair sieve, return the liquor into the boiler, and add 
the sugar; let it boil ^ an hour; when tepid, lay a toast 
covered with yeast in it, and cover it, keeping the cooler in a 
warm place ; when it begins to ferment, put it into the cask, 
taking out the toast. It should not be rad^ed till the autumn, 
and not bottled in less than a year. Parsnips are best in the 
winter. All warm fluids to be fermented should be regulated 
by a thermometer. Tepid is from 85 to 95 d^rees. The cold 
of the weather should regelate the heat between this range. 

GINGER WINE, 

828. — To every gallon of water take 2 lbs. of loaf-sugar 
and 2 oz. of bnxised ginger ; boil them together for an hour ; 
put the liquor into a vessel to cool ; when tepid, add the juice 
and peel of 6 lemons, and a toast covered with yeast ; cover it 
over, and when it begins to ferment put it into the cask; 
let it ferment 2 or 3 weeks. Before putting in the bung, 
put to it i lb. of raisins to every gallon ; they need not be 
stoned, but are best just slit open. This wine may be racked 
in another month, and isinglass put to clarify it. Bottle it in 
3 or 4 weeks, and it is soon fit to drink, though, if properly 
fermejited, it will keep a year or two and improve. 

Amongst the following receipts are many which have long 
been family favourites ; but as they generally recommend 
the old-fashioned plan of adding spirits to the wine, in the 
place of trusting to the process of fermentation for its strength, 
we cannot ourselves quite approve them ; nevertheless there 
are some from which most excellent wine has been made. 

A RICH AND PLEASANT WINE. 
829. — Take new cider from the press, mix it with as much 



Chap. XXX.] ENGLISH WINES. 603 

honey ss will support an egg, boil gently 15 minutes, but not 
in an iron, brass, or copper pot ; skim it well ; when cool, let 
it be tunned, but do not quite fill the cask. In March follow- 
ing bottle it, and it will be fit to drink in 6 weeks, but will be 
less sweet if kept longer in the cask. You will have a rich 
and strong wine, and it keeps well. This will serve for any 
culinary purposes which sack or sweet wine is directed for. 

Honey is a fine ingredient to assist, and render palatable, 
new crabbed austere cider; but this should be made from 
apples that are perfectly sound and of good quality. 

ENGLISH MALMSEY OR MALT WINE.'-E. R. 

830. — Take 30 gallons of sweet-wort, and to every gallon 
put H lb. of lump-sugar ; boil the liquor for i an hour, and 
when still warm tun it into a barrel, putting 2 lbs. of Malaga 
raisins coarsely chopped, 2 oz. of dissolved isinglass, and 1 
spoonful of yeast to each gallon, adding also 3 oz. of hops for 
the 30 gallons ; stir the liquor with a wooden stafi* every day 
for a fortnight or longer ; keep the bung lightly in until the 
fermentation ceases, then add 2 gallons of brandy ; let the wine 
stand 12 months, when it may be racked ofi* and bottled. It 
will be the better for long keeping, and will answer well for 
all culinary purposes. 

Or : — Take Si gallons of new ale from the vat whilst fer- 
menting, 5i gallons of cold spring water ; to every gallon add 
3 lbs. of sugar ; mix all well together till the sugar is dis- 
solved ; put it at once into the cask, and set it in a warm place 
to ferment, which it ought to do for 6 or 7 weeks ; chop 2 lbs. 
of Malaga raisins and i lb. of bitter almonds together ; put 
them into a wide-mouthed bottle, and add a pint of brandy ; 
cork it up till the wine has done fermenting, then put it into 
the cask, and bung it down close ; let it stand 6 or 7 mpnths, 
clear it ofi* into another cask, adding i oz. of isinglass dis- 
solved in a little of the wine ; let it stand another month, then 
bottle it. This has been proved to be an excellent receipt. 

GRAPE WINE,—E. R, 

831. — ^Take 20 lbs. of grapes very ripe and picked clean, 
pour upon them 6 quarts of boiling water, cover them close, 
and before they are cold break the grapes with the hand ; let 
them stand 3 days, then strain them as dry as possible, and stir 
into the liquor 10 lbs. of sugar ; tun it the next day, and it 



604 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXX. 

will work itself pure ; lay the bung on it until it has dooe 
hissing. 

RAISIN WINE,—E. R. 

832. — ^To every 6 gallons of water put 2 oz. of hops and the 
largest stalks of the Malaga raisins, and boil it iR>r ^ of an 
hour ; strain it, and when nearly cold pour it on the fruit, 
allowing 64 lbs., of which one-finh should be Smyrna rainns, 
to every gallon of water ; let it stand for 6 weeks, stirring it 
every fkiy ; press the fruit, and then put the liquor into the 
cask ; rack it in 6 weeks, or as soon as it is fine, and to every 
6 gallons add a bottle of the best French brandy. 

Excellent Raiiin Wine. — ^To every gallon of spring water 
put 8 lbs. of fresh Smyrnas in a large tub ; stir it thorou^y 
every day for a month ; then press the raisins in a horse-hair 
bag as dry as possible ; put the liquor into a cask, and, when 
it has done hissing, pour in a bottle of the best brandy ; stop 
it close for 12 monthis ; then rack it off, but without thedr^; 
filter them through a bag of flannel of 3 or 4 folds ; add the 
clear to the quantity, and pour 1 or 2 quarts of brandy, 
according to the size of the vessel. Stop it up, and at the end 
of 3 years you may either bottle it or drink it from the cask. 

Raisin wine would be extremely good if made rich of the 
fruit, and kept long, which improves the flavour g^reatly. 

Raisin Wine with Cider, — Put 2 cwt. of Malaga raisins 
into a cask, and pour upon them a hogshead of good sound 
cider that i^not rough ; stir it well 2 or 3 days ; stop it, and 
let it stand 6 months ; then rack into a cask that it wiU fill, 
and put in a gallon of the best brandy. 

If raisin wine be much used, it would answer well to keep 
a cask always for it, and bottle off 1 year's wine just in time 
to make the rest, which, allowing the 6 months of infusion, 
would make the wine to be 18 months old. In cider counties 
this way is very economical ; and, even if not thought strong 
enough, the addition of another i cwt. of raisins would be suf- 
ficient, and the wine would still be very cheap. 

When the raisins are pressed through a horsehair bag, they 
will either produce a good spirit by distillation (for which 
purpose they must be very little pressed) ; or they will make 
-excellent vinegar. 

The stalks, being very acid, should be picked out, and may 
be thrown into any cask of vinegar that is being msuie. 



Chap. XXX.] ENGLISH WINES. 605 

CURRANT WINE-E, R. 

833. — ^To each gallon of juice put 2 of water and 3i lbs. of 
moist sugar. When it has been in the cask about a fortnight, 
put a bottle of brandy to every 4 gallons of wine, and, when 
it has quite done hissing, bung it down close. 

Or: — ^To every 3 pints of fruit, carefully cleared from 
any that is mouldy or bad, put 1 quart of water ; bruise the 
former. In 24 hours strain the liquor, and put to every quart 
1 lb. of sugar, of good middling quality of Lisbon. If for 
white currants use lump-sugar. It is best to put the fruit, &c., 
in a large pan ; and when in 3 or 4 days the scum rises, take 
that off before the liquor is put into the barrel. 

Those who make from their own gardens may not have 
sufficient to fill the barrel at once : the wine will not be hurt 
if made in the pan in the above proportions, and added as the 
fruit ripens, and can be gathered in dry weather. Keep an 
account of what is put in each time. 

Another way, — Put 5 quarts of currants and a pint of rasp- 
berries to every 2 gallons of water ; let them soak a night ; 
then squeeze and break them well. Next day rub them well 
on a fine wire sieve till all the juice is obtained, washing the 
skins again with some of the water ; then to every gallon put 
4 lbs. of very good Lisbon sugar, but not white, which is often 
adulterated ; tun it immediately, and lay the bung lightly on ; 
do not use anything to work it. In 2 or 3 days put a bottle 
of brandy to every 4 gallons ; bung it close, but leave the peg 
out at top a few days ; keep it 3 or 4 years, and it will be a 
very fine agreeable wine. 

BLACK CURRANT WINE {very fine), 

834. — To every 3 quarts of juice put the same of water un- 
boiled, and to every 3 quarts of the liquor add 3 lbs. of very 
pure moist sugar ; put it into a cask, reserving a little for 
filling up ; put the cask in a warm dry room, and the liquor 
will ferment of itself ; skim off the refuse when the fermenta- 
tion shall be over, and fill up with the reserved liquor ; when 
it has ceased working, pour 3 quarts of brandy to 40 quarts of 
wine ; bung it close for 9 months, then bottle it, and drain 
the thick part through a jelly-bag until it be clear, and bottle 
that ; keep it 10 or 12 months. This recipe is most excellent. 
The wine will keep for 6 years. 



606 MODERN DOMESTIC GOOKEBY. [Chap. XXX. 

Or : — Bruise 28 lbs. of corrants, and pour upon them 2 
g^loDS of water ; let them remain 24 hoim, then atzain off 
the liquor, adding 14 lbs. of pure moist or loaf sugar; put 
the whole into a clean cask. In the fi>IIowiiig> spring rack 
the liquor, and run the g^unds through a jellj-bag; then 
put it into a clean cask, and add a bottle of brandj. The 
above proportions will make 5 gallons of wine. 

G008EBERK1 WINE. 

835. — To every 3 lbs. of gooseberries put a pint of sprii^ 
water unboiled, having first bruised the fruit with the hands 
in a tub ; stir them very well ; let them stand a whole day, 
then strain them off, and to every 3 lbs. of goosdserries add a 
pint of water and 1 lb. of sugar dissolved ; let it stand 24 
hours longer, then skim the h^ clean off, and put the liquor 
into a vessel, and the scum into a flannel bag, adding the 
liquor that drains from it to that in the vessel ; let it work 2 
or 3 days before stopping it up close, and allow it to stand 4 
months before it is bottled. When it is drawn out of the cask 
it should not be tapped too low. 

Green Gooseberry Wine, — Take 32 quarts of unripe goose- 
berries of the green lund, bruise them well, add 32 quarts of cold 
water ; let them stand for 24 hours ; drain the gooseberries 
well from the liquor through a sieve ; put Zi lbs. of lump- 
sugar to every gallon of liquor ; put it into a cask with a botde 
of the best gin ; let it stand 6 months, and then bottle it. 

This is a receipt from a nobleman's butler, who used to 
boast that he never opened more than one bottle of Cham- 
pagne at his master's table at one dinner, all that followed 
being of his own manufacture. 

CHAMPA GNE.—E. R. 

836. — Bruise well the amber hairy Champagne gooseberries, 
when they are just turning, in an equal quantity of cold spring 
water. Let the mixture stand for 2 or 3 days to ferment, and 
stir it frequently with a wooden spoon, taking care to place 
the vessel in a warm situation. Then pass the liquor tlm>ugh 
a hair sieve, squeezing the pulp until it is quite dry. For 
every gallon of the liquor put Si lbs. of the coarsest East 
India sugar, which must be placed in another vessel, and the 
acid liquor poured upon it. Allow it to stand 2 or 3 days, in 



Chap. XXX.] ENGLISH WINES. 607 

order that the fermentation may be properly effected, stirring 
it very frequently : then pass it through a flannel bag into the 
cask, and to every 10 gallons of the liquor put 1 oz. of isin- 
glass, 1 bottle of Ms^deira wine, and 1 bottle of rum ; the 
2 latter added after the cask has remained open for a month. 
A cask which has held brandy is to be preferred. Put in 
the bung after the expiration of the month ; lay a piece of 
coarse cloth over it, and cover the whole with a thick coat of 
resin. Let it stand 12 months, and then bottle it.* 

Pink Champagne. — ^Boil 9 lbs. of lump-sugar in 3 gallons 
of water for i an hour, skim it well, and pour the liquor boil- 
ing hot over a gallon of red and white currants picked, but 
not bruised. When nearly cold, put in a small teacupful of 
yeast. Keep it working for 2 days, then strain it through a 
horse-hair sieve, put it into a small cask with i oz. of isinglass. 
Have rather more liquor than will fill the cask to fill it up as 
it works over. In about a fortnight bung it up. Let it stand 
till April ; put into each bottle a lump of double-refined 
sugar. Let the bottles remain 1 day uncorked. Cork and 
wire them. They must stand upright in the cellar; when 
wanted, put a few on their sides for about a week. 

Grape Champagne to eqtial foreign, — Gather the grapes 
when they are just turning, or about half ripe. Pound them 
in a tub, and to every quart of fruit put 2 quarts of water. 
Let it stand in a mash-tub for 14 days, then draw it off, and 
to every gallon of liquor add 3 lbs. of lump-sugar. When 
the sugar is dissolved, cask it, and, after it has done working, 
bung it down. In about 6 months it will be fit to drink, 
when it should be bottled, and the corks tied down, or wired 
if it is to be kept more than a year. 

LEMON WINE, 

837. — To every gallon of water take 3 lbs. of sugar ; boil 
it 4 an hour ; pour it on the peel of 4 lemons ; make the 
juice into a syrup by boiling it with i lb. of the sugar ; mix 
all well together ; when cool lay on it a toast covered with 

* A sample of this wine was sent to the Horticaltnral Society of Edin- 
burgh, and exhibited amongst 70 different sorts, and, beiog pronounced the 
best, tiie honour of the gold medal was awarded to it ; bnt on its being un- 
derstood that the fruit was of English growth, it was considered as a foreign 
wine, and therefore not entitled to the prize. Hononrable mention of it 
was, however, made in the Report of the Transactions of the Society. 



608 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXX. 

yeast ; let it stand 2 days, when the fermentation will have 
commenced ; put it into die barrel, keep it filled up to the 
top till the fermentation subsides; bung it down close and 
bottle it in 3 months. 

FRONTINIAC.^E, R. 

838. — Boil 18 lbs. of white sugar in 6 gallons of water with 
2 whites of eggs well beaten. Skim it and put in i peck of 
elder-flowers : do not keep them on the fire : when nearly 
cold, stir if, and add 6 spoonfuls of lemon-juice and 4 or 5 of 
yeast ; beat the whole well into the liquor. Stir it every day, 
put 6 lbs. of the best raisins, stoned, into the cask, and tun 
the wine. Stop it close, and bottle it at the end of 6 months. 
This wine requires keeping. 

ELDER WINE.—E.E. 

839. — Pour 4 quarts of water upon 8 quarts of berries, and 
let it stand a day or two ; then boil it for about an hour, strain 
it, and put 3 lbs. of moist sugar to every gallon of wine ; then 
add 1 oz. of cloves and cinnamon, with 2 oz. of ginger ; boil 
it again, and work it with a toast dipped in yeast. 

Elder-Jiower Wine, — Take 12 lbs. of loaf-sugar and 6 lbs. 
of the best raisins, cut small, and boil them in 6 gallons of 
water for 1 hour. Then take i a peck of elder-flowers, when 
ready to shake ; put them into the liquor when it is nearly 
cold, with 4 tablespoonfuls of fresh yeast and 6 of lemon- 
juice. Let it work 2 days in the tub, then strain it, put it 
into the barrel, bung it up closely for 2 months, and then 
bottle it. 

These are excellent domestic wines, generally taken mulled, 
with dry toast ; and the flavour will be improved if, while 
warming, a grating of nutmeg be added. 

BLACKBERRY WINE,—E. R, 

840. — Let the berries be gathered when fully ripe, and on 
a dry day. Put them into a tub or cask, with the head out, 
and with a tap fitted near the bottom ; pour on them as much 
boiling water as will cover them, or to 6 measures of black- 
berries 1 of water may be used. As soon as the heat will 
permit, mash the berries with your hands until they are well 
broken, and let them stand covered till the pulp rises to the 
top and forms a crust, which it will do in 3 or 4 days. Then 



Chap. XXX.] ENGLISH WINES. 609 

draw off the fluid into another vessel, and to every gallon add 
1 lb. of sugar, mix it well, and put it into a cask to work 
for a week or 10 days, and throw off any remaining lees, keep- 
ing the cask well filled, particularly at the commencement. 
When the working has ceased, bung it down, and after 6 or 
12 months it may be bottled. 

CLARY WINE. 

841. — Boil 15 gallons of water with 45 lbs. of sugar; skim 
it : when cool, put a little to i pint of yeast, and so by degrees 
add a little more. In an hour pour the small quantity to the 
large, pour the liquor on clary-flowers, picked in the dry : 
the quantity for the above Ls 12 quarts. Those who gather 
from their own garden may not have sufficient to put in at 
once, and may add as they can get them, keeping account of 
each quart. When it ceases to hiss, and the flowers are all in, 
stop it for 4 months. Rack it off, empty the barrel of the 
dregs, and, adding a gallon of the best brandy, stop it up, and 
let it stand 6 or 8 weeks, then bottle it. 

COWSLIP WINE. 

842. — To every gallon of water weigh 3 lbs. of lump-sugar, 
boil the quantity i an hour, taking off the scum as it rises. 
When cool enough, put to it a crust of toasted bread dipped 
in thick yeast, let the liquor ferment in a tub 36 hours ; then 
into the cask put for every gallon the peel of 2 and rind of 1 
lemon, and both of 1 Seville orange, and 1 gallon of cowslip- 
pips; then pour on them the liquor. It must be carefully 
stirred every day for a week ; then to every 5 gallons put in 
a bottle of brandy. Let the cask be close stopped, and stand 
only 6 weeks before you bottle it off. Use the best corks. 

GINGER WINE.—E.R. 

843. — Boil 9 quarts of water with 6 lbs. of lump-sugar, the 
rinds of 2 or 3 lemons very thinly pared, with 2 oz. of bruised 
white ginger, i an hour. Skim. Put i lb. of raisins into 
the cask : when the liquor is lukewarm, tun it with the jirice 
of 2 lemons strained, and H spoonful of yeast. Stir it daily, 
then put in i pint of brandy and i oz. of isinglass-shavings : 
stop it up, and bottle it in 6 or 7 weeks. Do not put the 
lemon-peel into the barrel.

■ 

Or : — ^Boil 24 oz. of ganger for an hour in sufficient water 
to cover it ; take 86 good lemons, pare them very thin, and 
pour the boiling g^ineer upon the peel. Let it stand a daj or 
two, then squeeze the lemons ; strain the juice, and put it 
into the cask, adding 40 lbs. of fine raw sugar and 14 lbs. of 
Malaga raisins chopped ; slice the g^inger and put it into the 
cask with the liquor it was boiled in. fill up the cask with 
cold spring water, stir it frequently, and in 1 UMHith put in 2 
bottles of brandy, and stop it down. These proporti<Mis are 
for 20 gallons of wine. 

GINGER BEER.^E. R. 

844. — Slice 4 lemons and crush 2 oz. of ginger, add to them 
1^ lb. of lump-sugar and 2 oz. of cream of tartar, or the same 
amount of lemon-juice. Pour on it 2 gallons of boUing water, 
and when nearly cold add a tablespoonful of barm. Bottle it 
the next morning, and tie down the coriu. It will be fit to 
drink in 2 days. 

Another. — Pour a gallon of boiling water upon 1 lb. of 
loaf-sugar, 1 oz. each of g^und ginger and cream of tartar, 
and the peel of 1 lemon ; when cool add the juice of the lemon 
and a tablespoonful of yeast ; cover it and let it stand till the 
next day ; strain it, taking care not to stir up the sediment ; 
bottle it in stone bottles, tie down the corks, and it will be fit 
to drink in 2 days. 

EGG WINE, 

845. — ^Beat an e^^ and mix with it a spoonful of cold 
water ; set on the fire a glass of white wine, ^ a glass of 
water, a little sugar, and nutmeg. When it boils, pour it to 
the e^ by degrees, stirring it well : then return the whole 
into the saucepan, put it on a gentle fire, stir it one way for 
not more than a minute ; for if it boil, or the ^g be stale, it 
will curdle. Serve with dry toast. 

E^ wine may be made as above, without wanning the 
egg^ and it is then lighter on the stomach, though not so 
pleasant to the taste. 

Or : — It may be done without any other preparation than 
merely breaking the yolk of a raw egg or two into a tumbler 
of hot negus or spirit and water, mixing it all the while : if 
the whites be added, they will occasion froth, but not improve 
the flavour. 



Chap. XXX.] ENGLISH WINES. 611 

• 

TO MULL WINE. 

846. — Boil some spice in a little water till the flavour is 
gained, then add an equal quantity of port, some sugar and 
nutm^ ; boil together, and serve with toast. 

Another way, — ^Boil a bit of cinnamon and some grated 
nutmeg a few minutes in a large teacupful of water : then put 
to it a pint of port wine, and add sugar to your taste ; beat it 
up, and it will be ready. 

It may also be made of good British or foreign red wine ; 
and is much used throughout the north of Germany under the 
name of " Bischopf." 

NEG US.-E. S. 

847. — 1 bottle of wine, i lb. of sugar, and a lemon sliced. • 
Four 3 pints of boiling water upon this mixture, and grate 
nutmeg to the taste. 

Such is the common mode of making n^us ; for making a 
single tumblerful, however, as many people prefer to do it in' 
their own way, perhaps a better plan is to use only half the 
quantity of water, poured boiling hot upon the wine already 
sweetened and flavoured with nutmeg ; but having in it also 
a large and very thin cut rind of Seville orange, which gives 
it a very superior flavour, without any portion of the acid. 

The negus may be made of either white or red wine ; and, 
if drunk cold, is called '^ sangaree." 

The following is a French receipt : — I lb. of cherries, 4 lbs. 
of currants, 2 lbs. of black cherries ; squeeze all together, 
then let it stand in a cool cellar for 3 days ; put the juice 
on the fire in a preserving-pan, and allow it to bubble ; add 
sugar as for raspberry vin^;ar, and bottle it. This makes a 
delicious summer beverage. 



LIQUEURS. 

AN EXCELLENT METHOD FOR MAKING PUNCH. 

848. — Take 2 large fresh lemons with rough skins quite 
ripe J and some large lumps of double-refined sugar. Bub the 
sugar over the lemons till it has absorbed all the yellow parts 
of the skins. Then put into the bowl ihea^ \\nii\fs vbiSl v

612 MODERN DOMESTIC COOEERT. [Chap. XXX. 

much more as the juice of the lemons may be supposed to 
require ; for no certain weight can be mentioned, as the aciditj 
of a lemon cannot be known till tried, and therefore this must 
be determined by the taste. Then squeeze the lemon-juice 
upon the sugar, and with a bruiser press the sugar and the 
jidoe particularly well together, for a great deal of the rich- 
ness and fine flavour of the punch depmids on tiiis rubbii^ 
and mixing process being thoroughly performed. Then mix 
this up very well with boiling water (soft water is best), till 
the whole is rather cool. When this mixture (which is 
called the sherbet) is to your taste, take brandy and rum in 
equal quantities, and put them to it, mixing the whole well 
together again. The quantity of liquor must be according to 
your taste : 2 good lemons are generally enough to make 4 
quarts of pundi, including a quart of liquor, with ^ lb. of 
sugar : but this depends much on taste and on the stroigth of 
the spirit. 

As the pulp is disagreeable to some persons, the sherbet may 
be strained before the spirit is put in. Some strain the lemon 
before they put it to the sugar, which is improper ; as when 
the pulp and sugar are well mixed together it adds much to 
the richness of the punch. 

When only rum is used, about ^ a pint of porter will soften 
the punch : and even when both rum and brandy are used, the 
porter gives a richness, and to some a very pleasant flavour. 

This receipt has never been in print before, but is greatly 
admired. It is impossible to take too much pains in all the 
processes of mixing^ and in minding to do them extremely 
well^ that all the different articles may be most thoroughly in- 
corporated together. 

Another i — Divide the intended quantity of liquid into 4 
portions ; 3 of water, and 1 of spirits. Take enough of syrup 
or pounded white sugar and lemon-juice, according to taste, 
jund add as much thinly-pared Seville orange-peel as will give 
it flavour. Mix them up with three parts of old Jamaica rum, 
and one of real French brandy : then boil the water with a 
small quantity of green tea, so as to make a weak infusion, 
and pour it boiling hot, through a muslin strainer, upon the 
mixture. Let it be made in a deep jug, with a cover to keep 
it hot, and if you have a little arrack it will make the punch 
better in flavour ; while a small quantity of confectioners'

George the FourtKs Punch, — 1 bottle of champagne ; 1 
pint of white brandy ; 2 tablespoonfuls of rum ; 2 ditto of 
arrack ; 1 large glass of maraschino ; \ pint of pine-apple 
syrup ; \ pint of clarified sugar ; 1 pint of green tea ; the 
peel of 2 Seville oranges and of 1 lemon : squeeze the juice, 
mix it with the other ingredients, and strain it through a 
lawn sieve. 

Tea Punchy a la Chevret, — i pint of rum, the same quan- 
tity of brandy, the juice of a lemon, and sugar at discretion, 
added to a quart of strong tea. Set fire to it, and when it 
has burned out drink it while quite hot. 

Colonel Hawker* s Cold Punch, — ^A wineglass nearly full 
of the best refined sugar pounded ; 12 ditto of cold spring 
water ; half a wineglassful of lemon-juice ; 2 wineglasses 
brimfull of old Jamaica rum. Let the sugar be well melted 
and the lemon-juice thoroughly amalgamated with it and the 
water before adding the rum. 

Verderj or Milk Punch, — Pare 6 oranges and 6 lemons 
as thin as you can, grate them with sugar to get the flavour. 
Steep the peels in a bottle of rum or brandy stopped close 
24 hours. Squeeze the fruit on 2 lbs. of sugar, sidd to it 4 
quarts of water, and 1 of new milk boiling-hot ; stir the rum 
into the above, and run it through a jelly-bag till perfectly 
clear. Bottle, and cork close immediately. 

Or : — Take the rinds of 30 lemons pared very thin, steep 
them for 3 days in 2 quarts of rum ; then pour them into a 
vessel, adding 3 quarts more of rum, 3 quarts of water, 1 of 
lemon-juice, 4 lbs. of loaf-sugar, and 2 nutmegs grated. Dis- 
solve the sugar in the water ; mix all together, and then pour 
upon the ingredients 2 quarts of milk boiling hot. Stir it 
well together, and let it stand 2 hours ; then strain it through 
a jelly-bag till perfectly clear, much depending upon clearing 
it well. 

Norfolk Punch, — In 20 quarts of French brandy put the 
peels of 30 lemons and 30 oranges, pared so thin that not the 
least of the white is left. Infuse 12 hours. Have ready 30 
quarts of cold water that has boiled ; put to it 15 lbs. of 
double-refined sugar; and, when well mixed, pour it upon 
the brandy and peels, adding the juice of the oranges and of 
24 lemons ; mix well ; then strain through a very fine hair 
sieve into a very clean barrel that has held spirits, and put

2 quarts of new milk. Stir, and then bong it close ; kt it 
ttaiid 6 weeks in a warm cellar : botUe the liquor far ue, 
observing great care that the bottles are perfeetly dean and 
dry, and the corks of the best quality and well pat in. This 
liquor will keep many years, and is improved by age. 

Or: — Pare 6 lemons aiui 8 Seville oranges very thin, 
squeeze the juice into a large jar, and put to it 2 quarts of 
brandy, 1 of white wine, 1 of milk, imd H lb. of sugar. 
Let it be mixed, and then covered far 24 hours : strain through 
a jelly-bag till clear, then bottle it. 

Orange Punch. — ^Dissolve nearly f lb. of sugar in a little 
water, add the Juice of 2 lemons, and pour 2 quarts of boiling 
water upon it n>r the sherbet ; then add a glass of calTs-feot 
jeUy. Mix together a bottle of brandy, a bottle of rum, and 
1 of oranffe-wine, add it to the sherbet, and drink it either 
hot or coM. If bottled, and placed in a cold cellar, it will 
keep for any time. The orange wine uoc^Nirts a very fine 
flavour, which may be heightened by the addition of a bottie 
of liqueur, curagoa, or maraschino. 

Regenfs Punch. — ^Make the sherbet with green tea, capil- 
laire, and lemon-juice ; to 5 pints of this nuxture add 1 pint 
of rum, l^ of brandy, 1 of arrack, and a bottle of cura^oa, 
together with a small jar or shape of Guava jelly. Pour in a 
bottle of champagne, and send up the punch in a bowl or jug, 
with a pine-apple sliced into it. 

An excellent liqueur, — Stick 6 cloves into a fine ripe China 
orange, put it into a glass jar, adding i lb. of the finest moist 
sugar. Pour over it a quart of good brandy, tie a bladder 
over the jar, and over that a pasted paper. Set it in the sun, 
or in a warm place, for 3 or 4 weeks, shaking it gently every 
day till the sugar is thoroughly dissolved ; strain it ofiP and 
bottie it. This is a very fine stomachic

the orange-seeds bruised, first removing the outer husk. No 
water must be added to these materials. 

0/ Brandy. — Put 2 quarts of brandy in a large bottle with

sugar, and i a nutmeg : strain it through a flannel bag, and it 
will be found excellent. 

Of White Currant — Strip the fruit, and prepare it in a jar 
as for jelly ; strain the juice, of which put 2 quarts to 1 gallon 
of rum, and 2 lbs. of lump-sugar ; strain through a jelly-bag. 

Or : — To a gallon of rum put 2 quarts of white currant- 
juice strained, and H lb. of lump-sugar ; stir them well toge- 
ther, and let them stand in a pan closely covered all night. 
Stir it well in the morning, strain it through a sieve of coarse 
cloth, and then through a jelly-bag. Should it not be clear, 
put it through the jelly- bag a second time, then bottle it for 
use. 

NOYEAU.—E,R. 

850. — ^The real liqueur under this name is made in the 
island of Martinique, upon a foundation of French brandy, 
with a species of berry grown in the island, and sweetened 
with syrup. It requires age to give it the flavour of the 
berry, and even in the West Indies is far from being cheap. 
The following receipts, however, are good imitations. 

Blanch 3 oz. of bitter and the same quantity of sweet 
almonds, and bruise them in a mortar ; add them, with the 
rind of 2 lemons, to 1 quart of English gin, which must be 
kept in a moderate heat for 3 days and nights. Shake the 
bottle 3 or 4 times a-day, then add 14 oz. of loaf-sugar dis- 
solved in it a pint of boiling water, and let it stand 1 day and 
night longer, shaking the bottle frequently; then strain it, 
and filter it afterwards in blotting-paper such as the chemists 
use : bottle it, and it will be fit to drink in 6 months, but will 
improve by keeping for a year. 

Or : — To 1 quart of English gin, or what is better of good 
French brandy ^ put 3 oz. of bitter almonds, blanched and cut 
into pieces, and the rind of 3 lemons. Let it stand 3 days 
before the fire, shaking the bottle 2 or 3 times a-day ; then 
add I lb. of good loaf-sugar, or ^ a pint of syrup ; let it dis* 
solve, shaking it frequently during the day or two which it 
will take ; then filter it through blotting-paper. 

CHERRY BRANDY,-E. R, 

861. — To every pound of cherries put i lb. of lump-sugar, 
i oz. of bitter almonds, and 4 peach-leaves ; pick the cherries 
from the stalks, and put them with the sugar, &c., in bottles, 



616 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXX. 



filling the bottles with brandy. Put bladder on them, and 
cover that with paper. When Morella cherries are used, after 
3 months the liquor may be poured off, and more brandy 
added* 

HATAFIA, 

852. — Blanch 2 oz. of peach and apricot kernels, bruise and 
put them into a bottle, and fill nearly up with brandy. Dis- 
solve i lb. of white sugar-candy in a cup of cold water, and 
add to the brandy after it has Ktood a month on the kernels, 
and they are strained off; then filter through paper, and bottle 
for use. The distilled leaves of peaches and nectarines, when 
the trees are cut in the spring, are an excellent substitute for 
ratafia in puddingy. 

Ratafie des Quaire Fruits. — Take SO lbs. of cherries, 15 
of gooseberries, 8 of raspberries, and 6 of black currants; 
stone the cherries, and press the juice out of all the fruit : 
to each pint of juice put 6 oz. of pounded sugar. When it 
has stood long enough to clear, bottle it off. 

BLACK CURRANT LIQUEUR. 

853. — Put black currants into a stone pan, with as much 
leaves as fruit ; cover them all over with spirits of wine for 6 
weeks, or longer if you please ; then squeeze the mass through 
linen ; clarify the juice, and add syrup made with lump-sugar 
and water, according to taste ; it must be thrown in very hot. 
This may be made with whatever spirit you like, providing it 
is ta&teless. 

CRiMES.—E. R, 

854. — De Portugal, — Take 8 good lemons, rough skinned, 
but without spots ; pare the rind very thinly, and cut it into 
small slips ; put it into a bottle with a pint of spirits of wine, 
and a dozen bitter almonds blanched and bruised. Let it 
stand 6 days ; make a syrup with a pound of treble-refined 
sugar ; add it when cool : shake the whole well together. Let 
it stand 6 days, and then filter it through blotting-paper. 
This liqueur should be kept 6 months. 

De Cacao. — Take 1 lb. of good Caraccas cocoa, roast it as 
jf to be used for chocolate, being careful to take out the bad 
grains, of which there are sometimes several, and they would 
spoil the liqueur : pound it well, and infuse it in 6 pints of 



Chap. XXX.] LIQUEURS. 617 

brandy ; add i 02. of cut vanilla : let it stand for 8 days, then 
strain it. Melt 3^ lbs. of sugar in 3 pints of water ; inix it 
well together, and filter it. 

CURACOA, 
t 

855. — Take 1 lb. of the dried peel of the Seville orange, 

wash it in several lukewarm waters, then drain it over a sieve ; 

put it into a jar with 8 pints of brandy and 2 of water ; let it 

stand for a fortnight, shaking it frequently ; strain it. Melt 

5 lbs. of sugar in 3 pints of water, mix it with the liquor and 

strain it. 

SYRUP FOR LIQUEURS.—E. R. 

856. — Put a quart of water into a saucepan, and let it boil ; 
then drop into it, lump by lump, 1 lb. of loaf-sugar. When 
all the sugar is dissolved, let it boil again and put it into a 
broad dish to cool ; when cool it is fit for use. 

NECTAR,— E. R, 

857. — Take 2 lbs. of raisins chopped, and 4 lbs. of loaf- 
sugar, and put them into a spigot-pot ; pour 2 gallons of boil- 
ing water upon them. The next day, when it is cold, slice 2 
lemons into it. Let it stand 5 days, stirring it twice a-day. 
Then let it stand 5 days more to clear ; bottle it, put it into a 
cold cellar for 10 days, and it will be fit to drink. 

MEAD.—E. R. 

868. — To each gallon of water put 4 lbs. of honey ; boil it 
1 hour ; when the scum has done rising pour the liquor into 
a tub, and when cool put a toast with yeast spread over it into 
the tub ; allow it to stand until the next day ; then pour it 
into the cask and put the bung lightly over it ; let it stand 1 
year in the barrel. 

Or : — To every gallon of water put 4 lbs. of honey, and 
boil it 4 of an hour, taking care to skim it. To every gallon 
add 1 oz. of hops ; then boil it i an hour, and let it stand till 
next day : put it into your cask, and to 13 gallons of the liquor 
add a quart of brandy. Let it be lightly stopped till the fer- 
mentation is over, and then stop it very close. If you make a 
large cask, keep it a year in cask.

GINGER CORDIAL. 

859. — ^Take H oz. of ground ginger, 2 lbs. of white cur- 
rant8 jncked and bruised, cover it close, and let it stand 24 
hours ; pour upon these 1 quart of pure whisky or brandy, 
strain it through a linen cloth, add 1 lb. of loaf-sugar, and 
bottle it. 

Essence of Ginger. — ^Take 8 os. of ground ginger, 2 oz. of 
lemon-peel cut very thin, put these into a quart of brandy ; 
let it stand a fortnight, shaking it once or twice erery day ; 
strain it through a linen cloth, and bottle it.

CHAPTER XXXI. 



G00EER7 FOR THE SICE. 



It may be necessary to premise that a choice should be 
made of those things most likely to agree with the patient, 
and, as invalids require variety to indulge their appetite, fre* 
quent changes should be provided, but great simplicity ob- 
served in the preparation. Perhaps jellies and meat broths, 
together with various kinds of farinaceous food, are the 
lightest on the stomach, as well as, generally speaking, the 
most nutritious. 

JELLIES, 

860. — A good Jelly, — Soak 12 shanks of mutton 4 hours, 
then brush and scour them very clean. Lay them in a saucepan 
with 3 blades of mace, an onion, 20 Jamaica and 30 or 40 
black peppers, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a crust of bread 
made very brown by toasting. Pour 3 quarts of water to 
them, and set them on a hot hearth close covered ; let them 
simmer as gently as possible for 5 hours, then strain it off, and 
put it in a cold place. 

This may have the addition of a pound of beef, if approved, 
for flavour. It is a remarkably good thing for people who are 
weak. 

Sheep's heads and trotters are also good restoratives; 
savoury jelly may also be made in the same manner, without 
lemon, wine, or sugar, but flavoured with ham and spice. 

Dr, Ratcliffe^s Pork Jelly, — Take a leg of well-fed pork, 
just as cut up ; beat it, and break the bone. Set it over a 

fentle fire with 3 gallons of water, and sinuner to 1. Let 
oz. of mace and the same of nutmegs stew in it. Strain 
through a fine sieve. When cold, take off the hi. Give a 
chocolatecupM the first and last thing, and at noon, putting 
salt to taste. 



620 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [C^af. XXXI. 

Ivory Jelly. — ^Put i lb. of ivory powder into 3 pints of cold 
water, let it simmer until reduced to H pint ; when cold take 
the jelly carefully from the sediment; add to it the juice of a 
lemon, ^ the peel, 2 or 3 cloves, and sugar to taste ; warm it 
till quite dissolved, then strain it. 

Calfs FeeU—l^Ve 2 calf's feet in 2 pints of water and the 
same quantity of new milk, in a jar, close covered, 3^ hours. 
When cold, remove the &t. 

Give a large teacupful the first and last thing. Whichever 
flavour is approved, give it by baking in it lemon-peel, cinna- 
mon, or mace. Add sugar afterwards. 

Sheep's Trotters. — Simmer 6 sheep's trotters, 2 blades of 
mace, a Uttle cinnamon, lemon-peel, a few hartshorn shavings, 
and a little isinglass, in 2 quarts of water, to 1 ; when cdkl, 
take off the fat, and give nearly i a pint twice a-day, wanning 
with it a little new milk. 

Isinglass. — ^Boil I oz. of isinglass shavings, 40 Jamaica 
peppers, and a bit of brown crust of bread, in a quart of 
water, to a pint, and strain it. 

This makes a pleasant jelly to keep in the house ; of which 
a large spoonful may be taken in wine and water, milk, tea, 
soup, or any way most agreeable. 

Arrowroot. — It is very necessary to be careful not to get 
the counterfeit sort ; if genuine, it is very nourishing, espe- 
cially for persons with weak bowels. Put into a saucepan i a 
pint of water, a glass of sherry or a spoonful of brandy, grated 
nutm^, and fine sugar ; boil up once, then mix it by degrees 
into a dessertspoonful of arrowroot, previously rubbed smooth 
with 2 spoonfuls of cold water. 

Or: — Mix a dessertspoonful of arrowroot with a little 
cold water, have ready boiling water in a kettle, pour it upon 
the arrowroot until it becomes quite clear, keeping it stirred 
all the time ; add a little sugar. Where milk may be taken, 
it is very delicious made in the same way with milk instead of 
water, a dessertspoonful of arrowroot, and i a pint of milk ; 
add a small bit of lemon-peel. 

Potato. — We learn from the ^ Grardener's Chronicle ' that 
potato-starch is sold at from 1^. to 3^. the lb., though it 
might be prepared at home with no other means than a little 
trouble, with a grater and a sieve. 

'' To obtain Potato Jel(\| \w i^erfection, let a potato be 



Chap. XXXI.] COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 621 

washed, peeled, and grated ; throw the pulp, thus procured, 
into a jug of water, and stir it well. Pass the mixture of pulp 
and water over a sieve, and collect the water which drains 
through into a basin. Let this stand for a few minutes, and a 
sufficient quantity of starch will have fallen for the purpose 
required. Pour off the water, and then keep stirring up the 
starch at the bottom of the basin, while boiling water is being 
poured upon it, and it will soon and suddenly pass to tiie state 
of a jelly. The only nicety required is to be careful that the^ 
water is absolutely boiling, otherwise the change will not take 
place. It does not require more than 8 minutes to change a 
raw potato into a basinful of most excellent jelly, which has 
only to be seasoned with a little sugar, nutmeg, and white wine,' 
to please the most fastidious taste." ^ 

Tapioca. — Choose the largest sort, pour cold water on 
to wash it 2 or 3 times ; then soak it in fresh water 5 or 6 
hours, and simmer it in the same until it becomes quite clear ; 
then put lemon-juice, wine, and sugar. The peel should have 
been boiled in it. It thickens very much. 

Bread. — Take a penny roll, pare off the crust, and cut 
the crumb into thin slices ; toast them on both sides of a light 
pale brown. Put them into a quart of spring water, let it 
simmer gently over the fire until the liquid becomes a jelly, 
strain it through a thin cloth, and flavour it with a little 
lemon-juice and sugar, added when hot. If wine be permit- 
ted, it is an improvement. This jelly is of so strengthening a 
nature, that 1 teaspoonful affords more nourishment than a 
teacupful of any other. It may be prepared without the lemon- 
juice and sugar, and a teaspoonfal put into every liquid the 
patient takes, such as tea, coffee, broth, or beef tea. 

Gloucester Jelly is made with rice, sago, pearl-barley, harts- 
horn-shavings, and eringo-root, each 1 oz. ; simmer with 3c 
pints of water to 1, and strain it. When cold it will be a 
jelly. It may be taken dissolved in wine, milk, or broth, as a 
variety, with other nourishment. 

BROTHS. 

861. — Of Beef Mutton^ and Veal. — Put 2 lbs. of lean 
beef, 1 lb. of scrag of veal, 1 lb. of scrag of mutton, sweet 
herbs, and 10 peppercorns, into a nice tin saucepan, with 5 

• G.R. * Family Herald.' 



622 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXL 

quarts of water; simmer to 3 quarts, and clear off ..the fiit 
when cold. Add 1 onion, if improved. 

Soup GT broth made of different meats is more supportii^, 
as well as better flavoured. 

To remove the &t, take it off when cold as clean as pes* 
sible ; and if there be still any ranaining, lay a bit of dean 
blotting-paper on the broth when in the bfudn, and it will take 
up every particle. Or, if the broth is wanted befi»re there is 
time to let it get cold, put a piece of cork up the narrow end 
of a funnel, pour the broth into it, let it stand lor a lew 
minutes, and the &t will rise to the top ; remove the cork, and 
draw off in a basin as much of the broth as is wanted, which 
will be perfectly free from &t. 

Calf^S'feet Broth.— Boil 2 feet in 8 quarts of water till 
reduced to i ; strain and set it by ; when to be used, take 
off the fitt, put a large teacupful of the jelly into a saucepan, 
with i a glass of sweet wine, a little sugar and nutmeg, and 
beat it up till it is quite hot ; then take a little of it and add 
by degrees to the yolk of an egg, well beaten with a bit of 
butter the size of a nutm^ ; stir it all together, but do not 
let it boil. Grate a piece of fresh lemon-peel into it. 

Or :— Boil 2 calfs-feet, 2 oz. of veal, and 2 of beef, the 
bottom of a penny loaf, 2 or 3 blades of mace, i a nutm^ 
sliced, and a little salt, in 3 quarts of water, to 3 pints ; strain, 
and take off the fat. 

Chicken Broth may be made of any young fowl which is 
afterwards to be brought to table ; but the best sort is to be 
procured from an old cock or hen, which is to be stewed down 
to rags, with a couple of onions, seasoned with salt and a little 
whole pepper ; skim and strain it. 

A weaker ^W.— After taking off the skin and rump, put 
the body and legs of a fowl, from the white meat of which 
chicken panada has been made, into the water it was boiled in, 
with 1 blade of mace, 1 slice of onion, and 10 white pepper- 
corns. Simmer till the broth be of a pleasant flavour. If 
not water enough, add a little. Beat ^ oz. of sweet almonds 
with a teaspoonful of water, boil it in the broth, strain, and 
when cold remove the £it. 

Eel Broth. — Clean ^ lb. of small eels, and set them on with 
3 pints of water, some parsley, 1 slice of onion, a few pejqper- 
coms \ let them «mm£c ^ ^<^ ^U «se broken, and the broth 



Chap. XXXI.] COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 623 

good, or reduced to li pint. Add salt, and strain it off. It 
is very nutritious. 

A clear Broth that will keep long, — Put the mouse-round 
of beef, a knuckle-bone of veaJ, and a few shanks of mutton, 
into a deep pan, and cover close with a dish or coarse crust ; 
bake till the beef is done enough for eating, with only as 
much water as will cover it. When the broth is cold, cover 
it close, and keep it in a cool place. When it is to be used, 
give what flavour may be best liked. 

JFhr a quick-made Broth. — Take a bone or two of a neck 
or loin of mutton, take off the fat and skin, set it on the fire in 
a small tin saucepan that has a cover, with i of a pint of 
water, the meat being first beaten and cut in thin bits ; put a 
bit of thyme and parsley, and, if approved, a slice of onion. 
Jjet it boil very quickly ; skim it ; take off the cover if likely 
to be too weak, else cover it. Half an hour is suflicient for 
the whole process. 

A broth very supporting against any kind of weakness 
may be made of 2 lbs. of loin of mutton, with a very large 
handful of chervil in 2 quarts of water. Take off part of the 
fat. Any other herbs or roots may be added. Give i a pint 

3 or 4 times a-day. 

Or : — Put the knuckle of a leg or shoulder of veal with 
very little meat to it, an old fowl, 4 shank-bones of mutton 
extremely well soaked and bruised, 3 blades of mace, 10 pep- 
percorns, an onion, a large bit of bread, and 3 quarts of water, 
into a stewpot that covers close ; sinmier in the slowest 
manner afler it has boiled up and been skimmed ; or bake it ; 
strain, and take off the &,t. Salt as wanted. It will require 

4 hours. 

On the subject of skimming off the fat which rises on the 
broth, an eminent physician has stated that, " in cases of coughs 
and colds which afiect the chest, the fat should not be re- 
moved: more particularly that of mutton broth, which is 
eminently useful in calming the irritation of the lungs." 

An excellent Soup for the weakly is made by putting 2 
cow-heels and a breast of mutton into a large pan with 4 oz. 
of rice, 1 onion, 20 Jamaica peppers and 20 black, a turnip, 
a carrot, and 4 gallons of water ; cover with brown paper, 
and bake 6 hours. 

Or : — Put a teacupful of sago into a quart of water, and a.

BEEF TEA.—E. R, 

862. — Cut 1 lb. of fleshy beef in thin slices ; simmer witki 
quart of water li hour after it has once boOed and been 
skimmed. Season, if approved ; but it wants gisneraUy only 
salt. 

To drink cold. — Take 1 lb. of lean beef, clear it from 
every particle of skin, fat, or sinew, rasp or divide it into very 
small pieces; then put it into a jar, and pour a quart of 
boiling water upon it ; plunge the jar into a kettle of boiling 
water, let it stand by the side of the fire, but not near enough 
to simmer, and allow it to grow cold. Then strain the beef- 
tea through a muslin sieve, and, if the patient be very delicate, 
filter it through blotting-paper. 

This tea is to be taken when cold, and will remain upon 

the stomach when other nourishment fails ; it may be given 

to in&nts. 

EGGS, 

863. — An eg^ broken into a cup of tea, or beaten and mixed 
with a basin of milk, makes a breakfast more supporting than 
tea alone. 






Chap. XXXI.] COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 625 

An egg divided, and the yolk and white beaten separately, 
with a little wine put to each, will afford 2 very wholesome 
draughts, and prove lighter than when taken together. 

Eggs very little boiled, or poached, taken in small quantity, 
convey much nourishment : the yolk only, when dressed, 
should be eaten by invalids. 

PANADA 

is merely a preparation of bread made up in various ways. 

864. — To make it in Jive minutes. — Set a little water on the 
fire with a glass of white wine, some sugar, and a scrape of nut- 
meg and lemon-peel : meanwhile grate some crumbs of bread. 
The moment the mixture boils np, keeping it still on the fire, 
put the crumbs in, and let it boil as fast as it can. When of 
a proper thickness just to drink, take it off. 

Another' way, — Make as above, but, instead of a glass of 
wine, put in a teaspoonful of rum and a bit of butter ; sugar 
as above. This is a most pleasant mess, but will most pro- 
bably be objected to by the physician. 

Or ; — Put to the water a bit of lemon-peel, mix the crumbs 
in, and, when nearly boiled enough, put some lemon or orange 
syrup. Observe to boil all the ingredients, for, if any be 
added after, the panada will break and not jelly. 

Chicken Panada. — Boil a chicken till about three parts 
ready in a quart of water ; take off the skin, cut the white 
meat off when cold, and put into a marble mortar : pound it 
to a paste with a little of the water it was boiled it, season 
with salt, a grate of nutmeg, and the least bit of lemon-peel. 
Boil gently for a few minutes to the consistency you like ; it 
should be such as you can drink, though tolerably thick. 

This conveys great nourishment in a small compass. 

SIPPETSy 

when the stomach will not receive meat, are very nutritious, 
and prepared in this simple manner : — 

865. — On an extremely hot plate put 2 or 3 sippets of bread, 
and pour over them some gravy from beef, mutton, or veal, 
with which no butter has been mixed. Sprinkle a little salt 
over. 

Or : — Take a French roll ; cut it crosswise in slices of about

i of an inch thidL, and soak them in boiled milk until they haye 
imbibed as much as they will take ; then drain tbem, cover 
them with a coating of egg-batter, and fry them in a cheei^ 
toaster. When served, powder them shnply with white saghr, 
with or without a slight gating of nutmeg. 

CAUDLE 

866. — ^Is made in various ways. Make a fine smooth gniel 
of half-grits; strain it when boiled well; stir it at dififeieot 
times till cold. When to be used, add sugar, wine, and lemon- 
peel, with nutmeg. Some like a spoonnil of bnmdj besidei 
the wine ; others like l^non-juice. 

Or : — Boil up i a pint of fine gruel, with a bit of butter the 
size of a large nutmeg, a large spoonful of brandy, the same 
of white wine, 1 of capiUaire, a bit of lemon-peel, and 
nutm^. 

Another, — ^Into a pint of fine gruel, not thick, put, while it 
is boiling-hot, the yolk of an egg beaten with sugar, and mixed 
with a larg^ spoonSful of cold water, a glass of wine, and nut- 
meg. Mix by degrees. It is very agreeable and nourishiii^. 
Some like gruel, with a glass of table-beer, sugar, d^c., with 
or without a teaspoonful of brandy. 

Posset. — Boil the grated crumb of a penny loaf in a pint of 
water, with the grated peel of a Seville orange, till the mix- 
ture be clear and thick : then add 3 oz. of sweet and 1 oz. of 
bitter almonds, i the juice of an orange or any other kind of 
fruit, 4 oz. of sugar, and 1 pint of mountain wine. 

Cold Caudle, — Boil a pint of spring- water ; when cold, add 
the yolk of an egg, the juice of a small lemon, 6 spoonfids of 
sweet wine, sugar to your taste, and syrup of lemon» 1 oz. 

Flour Caudle. — ^Into 5 large spoonfuls of water rub 
smooth 1 dessertspoonful of fine fiour. Set over the fire 5 spoon- 
fuls of new milk, and put 2 bits of sugar into it ; the moment 
it boils pour into it the fiour and water, and stir it over a slow 
fire 20 minutes. It is a nourishing and gently astring^t food. 
This is an excellent food for babies who have weak bowels. 

Hice Caudle. — When the water boils, pour^into it some 
gpround rice mixed with a little cold water ; when of a pn^per 
consistence, add sugar, lemon-peel, and cinnamon, and a glass 
of brandy to a quart. Boil all smooth. 



Chap. XXXI.] COOKERS' FOR THE SICK. 627 

Or : — Soak some Carolina rice in water an hour, strain it, 
and put 2 spoonfuls of the rice into H pint of milk; sinmier 
till it will pulp through a sieve ; then put the pulp and milk 
into the saucepan, with a bruised clove and a bit of white 
sugar. Simmer 10 minutes ; if too thick, add a spoonful or 
two of milk ; and serve with thin toast. 

VARIO US PREPARA TIONS, ' 

867. — Saloop, — Boil a little water, wine, lemon^peel, and 
sugar together ; then mix with a small quantity of the powder, 
previously rubbed smooth with a little cold water ; stir it all 
together, and boil it a few minutes. 

Milk Poiridge, — Make a fine gruel of half-grits, long 
boiled ; strain off; either add cold milk, or warm with milk, 
as may be approved. 

French Milk Porridge. — Stir some oatmeal and water toge- 
ther ; let it stand to be clear, and pour off the latter ; pour 
fresh water upon it, stir it well, let it stand till next day ; 
strain through a fine sieve, and boil the water, adding milk. 
The proportion of water must be small. 

Abroad this is much ordered, with toast, for the breakfast 
of weak persons. 

Sago, — To prevent the earthy taste soak it in cold water 1 
hour, pour that off, and wash it well ; then add more, and sim- 
mer gently till the seeds are clear, with lemon-peel and spice, 
if approved. Add wine and sugar, and boil all up together. 

Sago Milk, — Cleanse as above, and boil it slowly, and 
wholly with new milk. It swells so much, that a small quan- 
tity will be sufficient for a quart, and when done it will be 
diminished to about a pint. It requires no sugar or flavouring. 

Ground Rice Milk. — Boil 1 spoonful of ground rice, rubbed 
down smooth, with W pint of milk, a bit of cinnamon, lemon- 
peel, and nutmeg. Sweeten when nearly done. 

Water Gruel, — Put a large spooniul of oatmeal by degrees 
into a pint of water, and when smooth boil it. 

Or : — Rub smooth 1 large spoonful of oatmeal with 2 of 
water, and pour it into a pint of water boiling on the fire ; 
stir it well and boil it quickly, but take care it does not boil 
over. In i of an hour strain it off; when eaten add salt 
and a bit of butter. Stir until the butter be incorporated.

ASSE^ MILK 

869. — Far surpasses any imitation of it that can be matle. 
It should be milked into a glass that is kept warm by being 
in a basin of hot water. 

The fixed air that it contains gives some people a pain in 
the stomach. At first a teaspoonful of rum may be taken 
with it, but should only be put in tiie moment it is to be swal- 
lowed. The animal should always be milked at the door. 

Artijieial Asset' Milk. — Boil together 1 quart of water, 1 
quart of new milk, 1 oz. of white sugar-candy, i oz. of 
eringo-root, and i oz. of conserve of roses, till half be wasted. 

This is astringent, therefore proportion the doses to the 
effect, and the quantity lo what will be used while sweet. 

Or : — Mix 2 spoonfuls of boiling water, 2 of milk, and an 
(^ well beaten; sweeten with pounded white sugar-canify. 
This may be taken twice or thrice a day. 

Or .—Boil 2 oz. of hartshorn shavings, 2 oz. of pearl-barley, 
2 oz. of candied eringo-root, and 1 dozes of snails that have 
been bruised, in 2 quarts of water to 1. Mix with an equal 
quantity of new milk when taken twice a-day. 

It should, however, be observed, that, although these pre- 
puatioDS ate nil good \n a. i»x(Aia decree, and some perhaps 



Chap. XXXI.] COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 629 

better, in a medical point of view, yet they do not afford the 
nutriment obtained from the original milk, especially in con- 
sumptive complaints. 

DR, BOERHAAVIPS SWEET BUTTERMILK, 

870. — Take the milk from the cow into a small churn ; in 
about 10 minutes begin churning, and continue till the flakes 
of butter swim about pretty thick, and the milk is discharged 
of all the greasy particles, and appears thin and blue. Strain 
it through a sieve, and drink it frequently. 

It should form the whole of the patient's drink, and the 
food should be biscuits and rusks in every way and sort, ripe 
and dried fruits of various kinds, when a decline is appre- 
hended. 

Baked and dried fruits — raisins in particular — make excel- 
lent suppers for invalids, with biscuits or common cake. 

Buttermilk, although thus recommended and generally 
thought most agreeable when made from sweet cream, is, 
however, by some preferred when sour, and is considered as 
more wholesome when in that state, as being lighter on the 
stomach. 

WHEY,—E. R. 

871. — Put 1 pint of warm milk into a vessel before the fire, 
and add to it i a tablespoonful of rennet. When the curd 
forms, cut it into squares to allow the whey to escape. Then 
put it on a sieve, and drain it carefully. 

The milk may also be turned with lemon-juice ; and the curds 
may be eaten with sugar and nutmeg, but not by a sick person. 

In Ireland rennet is never used for this purpose ; the mode 
there being to turn the sweet milk with a mixture of sour but- 
termilk. It is then called " two-milk whey," and is far pre- 
ferable to the English plan, having a slight but most pleasant 
acidity, and a greenish hue of perfect transparency. 

White Wine Whey, — Put } pint of new milk on the fire ; 
the moment it boils up pour in as much sound raisin wine as 
will completely turn it, and make it look clear ; let it boil up, 
then set the saucepan aside till the curd subsides, and do not 
stir it. Pour the whey off, and add to it i pint of boiling 
water and a bit of white sugar. Thus you will have a whey 
perfectly cleared of milky particles, and as weak as you choose 
to make it. 



630 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXI. 

Vinegar and Lemon Whey. — Pour into bmlin^ milk as 
much vinegar or lemon-jaice as will make a small quaotity 
quite clear, dilute with hot water to an ag^reeable acid, add a 
bit or two of sugar. This is less heatings than if made of 
wine, and, if only to excite perspiration, answers as weQ. 

DBINKS. 

872. — A soft and fine draught for those who are weak and 
have a cough may be made thus : — Beat a firesh-laid egg, and 
mix it with i pint of new milk warmed, a large spoonful of 
capillaire, the same of rose-water, and a little nutmeg scraped. 
Do not warm it after the egg is put in. Take it the first and 
last thing. 

A very agreeable draught is made by putting into a tumbler 
of fresh cold water a tablespoonful of capillaire and the same 
of good vinegar. 

Tamarinds, currants, fresh or in jelly, or scalded currants (V 
cranberries, make excellent drinks, with a little sugar or not 
as may be agreeable. 

A refreshing Drink in a Fever, — Put a little tea-sage, 2 
sprigs of balm, and a little wood-sorrel, into a stcme jug, 
having first washed and dried them ; peel thin a small lemou, 
and clear from the white ; slice it, and put a bit of the peel 
in ; then pour in 3 pints of boiling water, sweeten and cover 
it close. 

Perhaps no drink, however, is more refreshing in such a 
case than weak green tea, into which lemon-juice is infused in- 
stead of milk. It may be drunk either cold or hot, but the 
latter is the best mode. 

Toast and Water, — Toast slowly a thin piece of bread till 
extremely brown and hard, but not the least black ; then 
plunge it into a jug of cold water, and cover it over an hour 
before used. This is of particular use in weak bowels. It 
should be of a fine brown colour. 

Barley- Water. — 1 oz. of pearl barley, i oz. of white sugar, 
and the rind of a lemon, put into a jug. Pour upon it 1 quart 
of boiling water, and let it stand for 8 or 10 hours ; then 
strain off the liquor, adding a slice of lemon, if desirable. 
This infusion makes a most delicious and nutritious beverage, 
and will be grateful to persons who cannot drink the horrid 
decoction usually given. It is an admirable basis for lemon-

ade, negus/ or weak punch, a glass of rum being the proportion 
for a quart. 

Barley Water with Honey, — ^Add the juice and rind of 1 
lemon to 1 tablespoonful of honey and 2 teacupfuls of barley ; 
put it into a jug, and pour a quart of boiling water upon it. 

Barley Water with Isinglass. — A tablespoonful of pearl- 
barley, 6 lumps of loaf sugar, i a lemon, and enough isinglass 
to clear it. Pour 2 quarts of boiling spring water on these 
ingredients, and let it stand until cold. 

Soda Water, — Dissolve 6 drachms of dried carbonate of 
soda in a quart bottle of water, and 4^ drachms of tartaric 
acid in another bottle of the same size ; pour out a wineglassful 
from each bottle, and throw them at the same time into a tumbler, 
when it will immediately effervesce ; it should be drunk in this 
state. This is a good soda water, and a dozen glasses thus pre- 
pared will not cost more than 1^. Zd, or \s, 6d, If 10 drops 
of the muriated tincture of iron be previously put into the tum- 
bler a most excellent and agreeable tonic mineral water is pro- 
duced, which strengthens the tone of the digestive organs in a 
very remarkable d^ree. 

Lemon Water is also a delightful drink. I'ut 2 slices of 
lemon thinly pared into a teapot, a little bit of the peel, and 
a large spoonful of capillaire ; pour in a pint of boiling water, 
and stop it close 2 hours. 

A refreshing Drink for the Sick. — Boil 2 oz. of hartshorn 
shavings in 1 quart of water ; when quite dissolved set it aside 
to settle, and before it is cold strain it through a tammy upon 
i a lemon sliced thin, with sugar to taste ; cover it, and let it 
remain till cold, mixing with it a glass of Moselle or French 
wine. 

Apple Water is very delicate. Cut 2 large apples in slices, 
and pour 1 quart of boiling water on them; or on roasted 
apples ; strain in 2 or 3 hoiurs, and sweeten lightly. 

Or : — Peel and quarter 4 large rennet apples, or any other 
firm acid apple. Put them into 1 quart of water with the peel 
of i a lemon and a handful of washed currants ; let all boil for 
1 hour, then strain it ; add sugar to taste. Let it stand till 
cold. A little wine may be added to it when about to be 
drunk. 

Orgeat. — Beat 2 oz. of almonds with a teaspoonful of orange- 



682 HODERN DOMESTIG OOOKEBT. [Chap. XXXI 



flower water and a bitter almond or two : then poor I quart 
of milk and water to the paste. Sweeten with sogar or capH' 
laire. This is a fine drink for those who have a tender chest ; 
in the gout it is highly nsefbly and with the addition of i os. 
of g^m arabic has been found to allay the painfulness of the 
attendant heat, i a glass of brandy may be added if thought 
too cooling in the latter complaints, and the glass of orgeat 
may be put into a basin of warm water. 

Orangeade J or Lemonade. — Squeeze the juice, pour boiling 
water on a little of the peel, and cover close. Boil water and 
sugar to a thin syrup, and skim it. When all are cold, mix 
the juice, the infusion, and the syrup, with as much more 
water as will make a rich sherbet ; strain throc^^ a jelly-bag. 

Or : — Squeeze the juice, and strain it, and add water and 
capillaire. It is, however, still better when made with the 
juice of unripe grapes. 

The usual mode, however, of making Lemonade is to pour 
1 quart of boiling water on the rinds of 6 lemons, and let it 
stand for 3 or 4 hours ; add the juice of the lemons with i lb. 
of sugar ; simmer it well and skim it ; then add another quart 
of boiling water. Either run it through a jelly-bag, or mix a 
glass of calf Vfoot jelly, which will make it rich. 

Tamarinds^ or Cranberry Juice^ with double the quantity 
of water, also form a pleasant drink for an invalid, when ap- 
proaching to convalescence.

VARIOUS RECEIPTS AND DIRECTIONS TO 

SERVANTS. 



*•*- 



VARIOUS RECEIPTS. 

873. — Indian Cure for Rheumatism. — Lemon-grass oil 
mixed with sweet oil, in the proportion of 1 spoonful of the 
former to 2 of the latter, and rubbed on the part affected. 

Hooping Cow^^.^-The following remedy has been the 
means of curing hundreds of persons, but it must be steadily 
applied, and if the disease is not of long standing a sensible 
amendment will be perceived in about a fortnight. A friend 
of above 50 years of age was cured by it after many other 
remedies had failed. 

Oil of amber (the foreign is the best) to be rubbed every 
night at bedtime on the palm of the hands, the soles of the 
feet, the small of the back, and the pit of the stomach. The 
oil, if good, is so essential that i a teaspoonful is enough for 
a child at one time of rubbing. 

Or : — A dozen cloves of garlic steeped in i pint of rum 
for 24 hours : rub a dessertspoonful over the pit of the stomach 
at bedtime. This has been found of great benefit. 

A Cure for Chilblains, — Take of ammoniac gum (the 
real drop) i oz. ; reduce it into a smooth pulp with as little 
water as possible ; then add ^ oz. of extract of hemlock, and 
3 drachms of the strongest mercurial ointment ; the whole to 
be well mixed together. When used it should be spread on 
soft leather and sewed on the feet, and need not be removed 
above once a week. For recent chilblains, and for their pre- 
vention, this plaister is infallible. The above quantity is 
sufficient for a family of 3 or 4 children for the winter if their 
feet are properly attended to. 

For a Cough, — Take of treacle and the best white wine 



684 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. TCTCTTH 

vinegar 6 tablespoonfuls each, add 40 drops of laudanum ; 
mix it well and put it into a bottle. A teaspoonful to be taken 
occasionally when the cough is troublesome. 

A Remedy for a Bum or Scald. — ^Apply immediately a 
thick covering of wool to the burnt part, and bind it on tight ; 
in the course of i an hour very little pain will be felt, and 
scarcely any blister will remain. As this remedy is so simple, 
no housekeeper should be without loose wool at hand in case 
of an accident. This remedy was discovered by the child of 
a woolcomber having been dreadfully scalded : its mother laid 
it in a basket of newly carded wool whilst she ran for a doctor ; 
when she returned she found the child &st asleep amongst the 
wool, and when it awoke the excessive pain had subsided. 
We have frequently tried it, and invariably with success. 

To destroy Warts. — Dissolve as much common washing 
soda as the water will take up ; wash the warts with this for 
a minute or two, and let them dry without wiping. Keep the 
water in a bottle and repeat the washing often, and it will take 
away the largest warts. 

Before applying a blister rub the part over with a few drops 
of olive-oil ; this will make the blister act quicker and with less 
irritation. 

FOR THE DRESSING-TABLE. 

874. — To make soft Pomatum. — ^Beat i lb. of unsalted fresh 
lard in common water ; then soak and beat it in 2 rose-waters, 
drain it, and beat it with 2 spoonfuls of brandy ; let it drain 
from this ; add to it some essence of lemon, and keep it in 
small pots. 

Or : — Soak i lb. of clear beef-marrow, and 1 lb. of un- 
salted fresh lard, in water, 2 or 3 days, changing and beating 
it every day. Put it into a sieve, and, when dry, into a jar, 
and the jar into a saucepan of water. When melted, pour it 
into a basin, and beat it with 2 spoonfuls of brandy ; drain off 
the brandy, and then add essence of lemon, bergamot, or any 
other scent that is liked. 

Hard Pomatum. — Prepare equal quantities of beef- 
marrow and mutton-suet as before, using the brandy to pre- 
serve it, and adding the scent ; then pour it into moulds, ot, 
if you have none, into phials of the size you choose the rolls 
to be. When cold, break the bottles, clear away the glass 
carefully, and put i^^t To\)LiANXi<& tq\^« 



Chap. XXXn.] VAKIOUS KECEIPTS. 635 

Or : — Take equal quantities of marrow, melted and strained, 
lard, and castor-oil ; warm all together ; add any scent you 
please ; stir until cold and put into pots. 

Pomade Divine. — Clear 1^- lb. of beef- marrow from the 
strings and bone, put it into an earthen pan or vessel of water 
fresh from the spring, and change the water night and morning 
for 10 days ; then steep it in rose-water 24 hours, and drain it 
in a cloth till quite dry. Take an oz. of each of the following 
articles, namely, storax, gum-benjamin, and odoriferous cypress 
powder, i oz. of cinnamon. 2 drachms of cloves, and 2 drachms 
of nutmeg, all finely powdered ; mix them with the marrow 
above prepared ; then put all the ingredients into a pewter 
pot that holds 3 pints ; make a paste of white of egg and flour, 
and lay it upon a piece of rag. Over that must be another 
piece of linen to cover the top of the pot very close, that none 
of the steam may evaporate. Put the pot into a large copper 
pot with water, observing to keep it steady, that it may not 
reach to the covering of the pot that holds the marrow. As 
the water shrinks, add more, boiling hot ; for it must boil 
4 hours without ceasing a moment. Strain the ointment 
through a linen cloth into small pots, and, when cold, cover 
them. Do not touch it with anything but silver. It will 
keep many years. 

A fine pomatum may be made by putting J lb. of fresh 
marrow, prepared as above, and 2 oz. of hog's lard, on the 
ingredients, and then observing the same process as before. 

Pot-pourri. — Put into a large china jar the following in- 
gredients in layers, with bay-salt strewed between the layers : — 

2 pecks of damask-roses, part in buds and part blown ; violets, 
orange-flowers, and jasmine, a handful of each ; orris-root sliced, 
benjamin, and storax, 2 oz. of each ; i oz. of musk ; i lb. of 
angelica-root sliced ; a quart of the red parts of clove-gilly- 
flowers ; 2 handfuls of lavender-flowers ; i a handful of rose- 
mary-flowers ; bay and laurel leaves, i a handful of each ; 

3 Seville oranges, stuck as full of cloves as possible, dried in 
a cool oven, and pounded ; i a handful of knotted marjoram ; 
and 2 handfuls of balm of Gilead dried. Cover all qidte 
close. When the pot is uncovered the perfume is very fine. 

A quicker sort of Sweet Pot-pourri, — Take 3 handfuls of 
orange-flowers, 3 of clove-gillyflowers, 3 of damask-roses, 1 of 
knotted marjoram, 1 of lemon-thyme, 6 bay-leaves, a handful 



686 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXDL 

of rosemary, 1 of myrtle, i of ndnt, 1 of lavender, the rind 
of a lemon, and i oz. of cloves. Chop all, and put them in 
layertt, with pounded bay-salt between, up to the top of 
thie jar. 

If all the ingredients cannot be got at once^ put them in as 
you get them ; always throwing in salt with every new article. 

To make Wash-balls, — Shave thin 2 lbs. of new white soap 
into about a teacupful of rose-water, then pour as much boiling 
water on as will soften it. Put into a brass pan a pint of sweet 
oil, 4 pennyworth of oil of almonds, 4 lb. of spermaceti, and 
set all over the fire till dissolved ; then add the soap and ^ oz. 
of camphor that has fir^t been reduced to powder by rubbing it 
in a mortar, with a few drops of spirits of wine, or lavende^ 
water, or any other scent. Boil 10 minutes, then pour it into 
a basin, and stir it till it is quite thick enough to roll up into 
hard balls, which must then be done as soon as possible. If 
essence is used, stir it in quicicly after it is taken off the fire, 
that the flavour may not fly off. 

Paste for Chapped Hands, — Mix i lb. of unsalted hog^s 
lard, which has been washed in soft water, and then rose-water, 
with the yolks of 2 new-laid eggs, and a larg^ spoonful of 
honey. Add as much fine oatmeal or almond-paste as will 
work into a paste. 

Or : — Blanch 1 lb. of bitter almonds, pound them smooth in 
a marble mortar; add i oz. of camphor, 1 oz. of honey, i lb. 
of spermaceti, all pounded, and mixed with the almonds, till it 
becomes a smooth paste. Put it into jars or china boxes, and 
tie it down till wanted. 

Fbr Chapped Lips, — Put i oz. of benjamin, storax, and 
spermaceti, two-pennyworth of alkanet-root, a large juicy apple 
chopped, a bunch of black grapes bruised, i lb. of unssdted 
butter, and 2 oz. of bees' wax, into a new tin saucepan. Sim- 
mer gently till the wax, &c., are dissolved, and then strain it 
through linen. When cold, melt it again, and pour it into 
small pots or boxes ; or, if to make cakes, use the bottoms of 
teacups. 

Or : — Put 4 oz. of olive-oil into a bottle with 1 oz. of alka- 
' net-root ; stop it up, and set it for some days in the sun, shak- 
ing it often until it becomes perfectly bright. Then strain the 
oil from the alkanet, put it into a pipkin, and add to it 1 oz. 
of white wax and \^ cvl. o^ ^^^3Kn&!^ \fix)NX»CL «M^t \ set the mix- 



Chap. XXXII.] VARIOUS RECEIPTS. 637 

ture on a very slow fire to simmer for a little while, after which 
take it off, and, when it begins to cool, mix with it a few drops 
of any perftimed essential oil. 

Cold Cream will have nearly the same effect. Take 2 oz. 
of oil of sweet almonds, 1 drachm each of white wax and sper- 
maceti, which scrape very fine, and put them with the oil into 
an earthen pipkin to melt slowly on the embers, and stir it till 
it becomes quite smooth ; after which, when becoming cold, 
add 1 oz. of rose-water, and put it into a gallipot closely 
covered ; it should be a very thick cream. 

Thieves^ Vinegar. — " Take a large handful of lavender- 
blossoms and the same quantity of sage, mint, rue, wormwood, 
and rosemary ; chop and mix them well together ; put them 
into a jar with i oz. of camphor that has been dissolved in 
alcohol, and pour in 3 quarts of strong vinegar ; keep the jar 
for 2 or 3 weeks in the sun, and plunge it every night in a bpx 
of hot sand ; afterwards strain and bottle the liquid, putting 
into each bottle a clove of garlic sliced. It should be kept 
very tightly corked, and is best made in June." * 

Hungary Water. — To 1 pint of highly-rectified spirits of 
wine put 1 oz. of oil of rosemary and 2 drachms of essence 
of ambergris ; shake the bottle well several times, then let the 
cork remain out 24 hours. After a month, during which time 
shake it daily, put the water into small bottles. 

Honey Water. — Take 1 pint of spirit as above, and 3 
drachms of essence of ambergris ; shake them well daily. 

Lavender Water. — Take 1 pint of spirit as above, essential 
oil of lavender 1 oz., essence of ambergris 2 drachms ; put all 
into a quart bottle, and shake it extremely well. 

A very fine Scent. — Take 6 drachms of oil of lavender, 3 
of the essence of bergamot, 60 drops of ambergris, and 2 grains 
of musk. Mix these into a pint of the best rectified spirits of 
wine. 

An excellent Water to prevent Hair from falling off, and 
to thicken it. — Put 4 lbs. of unadulterated honey into a still, 
with 12 handfuls of the tendrils of vines, and the same quan- 
tity of rosemary-tops. Distil as cool and as slowly as possible. 
The liquor may be allowed to drop till it begins to taste sour. 

Bandoline for the Hair. — Crush the pips of the ripe quince

between 2 pieces of paper ; then pat them into a tumbler of coM 
water to stand all night, when the water will have beeome 
glutinous and fit for use: drop into it a small quantity of qn- 
rits of wine, and a few drops of essence of rose, jasmine^ or 
any other perfume. « 

BLACK FAFEB FOB DBA WING FATTERNS. 

875. — Mix and smooth lamp-bladL and sweet oil ; with a bit 
of flannel cover a sheet or two of large writing-paper with this 

mixture ; then dab the paper dry with a bit of fine lin^i, and keep 
it by for using in the following manner : — Put the black side 
on another sheet of paper, and &st«i the comers tog^her witii 
small pins. Lay on the backofthe black paper the pattern to 
be drawn, and go over it with the point of a steel p^icil ; the 
black papor will then leave the impression of the pattern on the 
under sheet, on which you must draw it with ink. 

If you draw patterns on cloth or muslin, do it with a pen 
dipped in a bit of stone blue, a bit of sugar, and a little water, 
mixed smooth in a teacup, in which it ^nll be always ready for 
use, if fresh ; wet to a due consistence as wanted. 

BLACK INK 

876. — Take 1 gallon of rain or soft water, and i lb. of blue 
galls bruised ; infuse them 3 weeks, stirring daily. Then add 
4 oz. of green copperas, 4 oz. of logwood chips, 6 oz. of gum 
arabic, and a wineglassful of brandy. 

Walkden's ink-powder is one of the best preparations for 
this useful article. Directions are given with it how to mix 
it ; in addition to which 1 large cup of sweetwort to 2 papers 
of the powder gives it the brightness of the japan ink. If a 
packet of 6 papers is bought together, it costs only 1*. 6c/. 
and that quantity will last a long time. 

TO CEMENT BROKEN CHINA. 

877. — ^Beat lime into the most impalpable powder, sifi it 
through fine muslin ; then tie some into a thin muslin : put on 
the edges of the broken china some white of ^g, then dust 
some lime quickly on the same, and unite them exactly. 

Or : — ^Dissolve 1 oz. of isinglass in 2 win^lassfuls of spirits 
of wine. It will form a transparent glue, which will unite glass 
so that the fracture m\V\ift«^Q«X.\\ss^«i:«^^ The greatest

care must be taken that the spirits of wine shall not boil over 
into the fire. 

TO TAKE STAINS OUT OF LINEN, §-c. 

878. — Stains caused by Adds. — Wef the part, and lay on 
it some salt of wormwood ; then rub it, without diluting it with 
more water. 

Or : — Let the cloth imbibe a little water without dipping, 
and hold the part over a lighted match at a due distance. The 
spots will be removed by the sulphureous gas. 

Or : — Tie up in the stained part some pearlash ; then 
scrape some soap into cold soft water to make a lather, and 
boil the linen till the stain disappears. 

Stains of Wine, Fruity Sfc, after they have been long in the 
Linen, — ^Rub the part on each side with yellow soap ; then lay 
on a mixture of starch in cold water very thick ; rub it well in, 
and expose the linen to the sun and air till the stain comes out. 
If not removed in 3 or 4 days, rub that off and renew the pro- 
cess. When dry it may be sprinkled with a little water. 

Many other Stains may be taken out by dipping the linen 
in sour buttermilk, and drying it in a hot sun. Then wash it 
in cold water, and dry it, 2 or 3 times a-day. 

Ironmoulds should be wetted, then laid on a hot water- 
plate, and a little essential salt of lemons put on the part. If 
the linen becomes dry, wet it, and renew the process, observing 
that the plate is kept boiling hot. Much of the powder sold 
under the name of salt of lemons is a spurious preparation ; and 
therefore it is necessary to dip the linen in a good deal of water, 
and wash it as soon as the stain is removed, to prevent the part 
^m being worn into holes by the acid. 

To take otit Mildew. — Mix soft soap with starch powdered, 
half as much salt, and the juice of a lemon ; lay it cm the part 
on both sides with a painter's brush. Let it lie on the grass 
day and night till the stain comes out. 

To take Grease out of Silks or Stuffs. — Take a lump of 
magnesia, and rub it wet over the spot ; let it dry ; then brush 
the powder off, and the spot will disappear. 

Or : — Take a visiting or other card ; separate it, and rub 
the spot with the soft internal part, and it will disappear with- 
out taking the gloss off the silk. 



640 MODERN •domestic COOKERY. [Ohap. XXXH. 

To take the Stains out of Black Cloth. — ^Boil a large hand- 
ful of fig-leaves in 2 quarts of water until reduced to a pint ; 
squeeze the leaves quite dry, and put the liquor into a bottk 
m use. The artide should be rubbed with a sponge dipped 
in the liquor. The iford poison should be written on the 
bottle to prevent any accident. 

To make Flannels not shrink. — ^The first time of washing 
put them into a pail of boiling water, and let them lie till 
cold. 

To preserve Furs and Woollens from Hfoths, — ^Let the 
former be occasionally combed while in use, and the latter be 
brushed and shaken. When not wanted, dry them first, let 
them be cool, then mix among them bitter apples fiom the 
apothecary's in small muslin bags, sew the articles in several 
fblds of linen, carefuUy turned in at the edg^, and keep them 
£rom damp. 

Or : — Lay amongpst them the cuttings of Russia leather. 

TO DYE THE LININGS OF FURNITURE^ ETC, 

879. — J^'uff or Salmon Colour , according to the depth df 
the hue. — Rub down on a pewter plate 2 pennyworth of Spa- 
nish arnatto, and then boil it in a pail of water i of an hour. 
Put into it 2 oz. of potash, stir it round, and instantly put in 
the lining ; stir it about all the time it is boiling, which must 
be 5 or 6 minutes ; then put it into cold pump water, and hang 
the articles up singly without wringing. When almost dry, 
fold and mangle them. 

Pink. — The calico must be washed extremely clean and be 
dry. Then boil it in 2 gallons of soft water and 4 oz. of alum ; 
take it out, and dry in the air. In the mean time boil in the 
alum-water 2 handfuls of wheat-bran till quite slippery, and 
then strain it. Take 2 scruples of cochineal and 2 oz. of argall 
finely powdered and sifted ; mix with it the liquor by little at 
a time. Then put the calico into the liquor, and boil it till it 
is almost wasted, moving it about. Take out the calico, and 
wash it in chamber-ley first, and in cold water after ; then 
rinse it in water-starch strained, and dry it quickly without 
hanging it in folds. Mangle it very highly, unless you have 
it calendered, which is best. 

Blt^, — Let the calico be washed clean and dried ; then 
mix some of S^ll'a ^^^^ \A»& m «a much water as will be 






Chap. XXXH.] DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 641 

sufficient to cover the things to be dyed, and put some starch 
to it to give a slight stiflfness. Dry a bit, to see whether the 
colour is deep enough ; set the linen, &c., into it, and wash 
it : then dry the articles singly, and mangle or calender them. 
The dyer will, however, do it better, and perhaps cheaper. 

To make Old Silk look as well as New. — Unpick the dress, 
put it into a tub and cover it with cold water ; let it remain an 
hour ; dip it up and down, but do not wring it ; hang it up to 
drain. Iron it very damp, and it will look beautiful. 

Or : — Having unpicked the dress, grate 2 large potatoes into 
a quart of water ; let it stand to settle ; strain it without dis- 
turbing the sediment, and sponge the silk with it. Iron it on 
the wrong side. 

TO DYE GLOVES. 

880. To look like York- Tan. — Put some safiron into 1 pint 
of soft water boiling hot, and let it infuse all night; next 
morning wet the leather over with a brush. The tops should 
be sewn close to prevent the colour from getting in. 

To dye white Gloves a beautiful Purple, — ^Boil 4 oz. of log- 
wood and 2 oz. of roche-alum in 3 pints of soft water till half 
wasted. Let it stand to be cold after straining. Let the 
gloves be nicely mended ; then do them over with a brush, 
and when dry repeat it. Twice is sufficient, unless the colour 
is to be very dark. When dry, rub off the loose dye with a 
coarse cloth. Beat up the white of an e^, and with a sponge 
rub it over the leather. The dye will stain the hands, but 
wetting them with vinegar before they are washed will take 
it off. 



DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 

881. To clean Calico Furniture. — Shake off the loose dust, 
then lightly brush with a small long-haired furniture-brush ; 
after which wipe it closely with clean flannels, and rub it with 
dry bread. 

If properly done, the curtains will lode nearly as well as at 
first ; and, if the colour be not li^t, they will not require 
washing for years. 

Fold in large parcels, and put carefiiUy by. 



648 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [C«ap. XXXH. 



While the fundtiire lemains up, it shonld be preeerved ften 
the sun and air as much as poflnble, which injure deliealie 
eolonn ; and the dust may be blown off with bellows. 

By the above mode curtains may be kept clean, even to we 
with the linings newly dipped. 

7b clean Plate. — ^Boil an ounce of prepared hartshen- 
powder in a quart of water ; while on the fire, put into it ai 
much plate as the vessel will hold ; let it boil a little, then 
take it out, drain it over the saucepan, and dry it before tiie 
fire. Put in more, and serve the same, tiU you have done. 
Then put into the water some dean linen rags till aU he 
soaked up. When dry, they will serve to dean the plate, ani 
are the very best things to clean the brass locks and finger- 
plates of doors. When the plate is quite dry, it must be 
rubbed bright with leather. This is a very nice mode. 

In many plate-powden there is a mixture of quicksilver, 
which is very injurious ; but the common sort — ^whiting wetted 
with gin, or, if the plate be much stained, a little nitric add, 
and wiped dry with chamois-leather — ^will be nearly, if not 
quite, as efiectual. 

To clean Looking-glasses. — Remove the fly-stains and 
other soil with a damp rag ; then polish with woollen doth 
and powder-blue, taking care to handle them gently. 

To preserve Gilding and clean it. — It is not possible to 
prevent flies from staining the gilding without covering it ; 
before which blow ofl* the light dust, and pass a feather or 
clean brush over it, but never touch it with water ; then with 
strips of paper, or rather gauze, cover the frames of your 
glasses, and do not remove tUl the flies are gone. 

Linen takes ofl* the gilding, and deadens its brightness ; it 
should therefore never be used for wiping it. 

As means to destroy the fliesj which injure furniture of 
every kind : — 

Bottles hung about with sugar and vin^ar, or beer, will 
attract them ; or fly-water put into little shells placed about 
the room, but out of the reach of childr^. Or, what is mnch 
safer, is a paper now sold at the chemist's covered with an 
adhesive substance, which may be laid on the glass or near it. 
A good preventive is to hang gauze blinds before all open 
windows. 

Or : — ^BoW Z ot 4^ \«i^ m «w ^\siL ^ ^««^b»^ then with a

gilding-brush wash over your glasses and frames with the 
liquid, and the flies will not go near the articles so washed. 
This may be used without apprehension, as it will not do the 
least injury to the frames. 

To clean Paint. — ^Never use a cloth, but take off the dust 
with a little long-haired brush, after blowing off the loose 
parts with the bellows. With care, paint will look well for a 
length of time if guarded from the influence of the sun. 
When soiled, dip a sponge or a bit of flannel into soda and 
water, wash it off quickly, and dry immediately, or the 
strength of the soda will eat off the colour ; it is, therefore, 
generally better to use only strong soap and water. 

When wainscot requires scouring, it should be done from 
the top downwards, and the water be prevented from running 
on the unclean part as much as possible, or marks will be made 
which will appear after the whole is finished. One person 
should dry with old linen, as &ist as the other has scoured off 
the dirt and washed the soap off. 

To clean Paper-hangings, — First blow off the dust with 
the bellows. Divide a white loaf of 8 days old into S parts. 
Take the crust into your hand, and, beginning at the top of 
the paper, wipe it downwards in the lightest manner with the 
crumb. Do not cross, nor go upwards. The dirt of the 
paper and the crumbs will fall together. Observe, you must 
Hot wipe above ^ a yard at a stroke, and, after doing all the 
upper part, go round again, beginning a little above where 
you left off. If you do not do it extremely lightly, you will 
make the dirt adhere to the paper. It will look like new if 
properly done. 

To give a gloss to Oak-wainscot. — If greasy, it must be 
washed with warm beer ; then boil 2 quarts of strong beer, a 
bit of bees'-wax as large as a walnut, and a large spoonftil of 
sugar ; wet it all over with a large brush, and when chry rub 
it till bright 

To give a fine Colour to Mahogani^. — ^Let the tables be 
washed perfectly clean with vinegar, having first taken out 
any ink-stains there may be with spirit of salt ; but it must be 
used with the gpreatest care, and only touch the part afl^ted, 
and be instantly washed off. Use the followii^ liquid : — lato 
a pint of cold-drawn Knseed-oil put 4 pennyworth (^alkanet- 
root and 2 pamyworth of rose-pink in aa eftrthen veaa^\ Vlu. 



644 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. yYTTT. 

it remaiD all night ; then stirring well, rub some of it all orer 
the tables with a linen rag ; when it has lain some time, rub 
it bright with linen cloths ; nothing, however, will be fi>and 
equal to " elbow-grease." 

To take Ink out of Mahogany. — ^Dilute i a teaspoonful of 
oil of vitriol with a large spoonful of water, and touch the part 
with a feather ; watch it, for if it stays too long it will leave a 
white mark. It is therefore better to rub it quickly, and 
repeat if not quite removed. 

To give to Boards a heauHfid appearanee. — ^After washing 
them very nicely with soda and warm water and a brush, wash 
them with a very large sponge and clean water. Both times 
observe to leave no spot untouohed ; and clean straight up 
and down, not crossing from board to board ; then dry witii 
clean cloths, rubbed hard up and down in the same way. 

The floors should not be often wetted, but very thorou^ily 
when done ; and once a-week dry-rubbed with hot sand and a 
heavy brush the right way of the boards. 

The sides of stairs or passages on which are carpets or floor- 
cloth should be washed with sponge instead of linen or flannel, 
and the edges will not be soiled. Different sponges should be 
kept for the above two uses ; and those and the brushes should 
be well washed when done with, and kept in dry places. 

To extract Oil from Boards or Stone. — Make a strong ley 
of pearlashes and soft water, and add as much unslaked lime as 
it will take up ; stir it together, and then let it settle a few 
minutes ; bottle it, and stop close ; have ready some water to 
lower it as used, and scour the part with it. If the liquor 
should lie long on the boards, it will draw out the colour of 
them ; therefore do it with care and expedition. 

To clean stone Stairs and Halls. — Boil 1 lb. of pipe-clay 
with a quart of water, a quart of small-beer, and put in a bit 
of stone-blue. Wash with this mixture, and, when dry rub 
the stones with flannel and a brush. 

Floor-cloths should be chosen that are painted on a fine 
cloth, which is well covered with the colour, and the pat- 
terns on which do not rise much above the ground, as they 
wear out first. The durability of the cloth will depend much 
on these particulars, but more especially on the time it has 
been painted axid l\i<& ^Mduess of the colours. If they have 
.not been aUowedi from<^\sxi&. ^qsdl^ ^^ X^^Rna^Ds^ thoroughly 



Chap. XXXII.] DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 646 

hardened, a very little use will injure them ; and, as they are 
very expensive articles, care in preserving them is necessary. 
It answers to keep them some time before they are used, either 
hung up in a dry bam where they will have air, or laid down 
in a spare room. 

When taken up for the winter, they should be rolled round 
a carpet-roller, and observe not to crack the paint by turning 
the ^ges in too suddenly. 

Old carpets answer extremely well, painted and seasoned 
some months before laid down. If for passages, the width 
must be directed when they are sent to the manu&ctory, as 
they are cut before painting. 

7b clean Floor-cloths. — Sweep, then wipe them with a 
flannel ; and when all dust and spots are removed, rub with a 
waxed flannel, and then with a dry plain one ; but use little 
wax, and rub only enough with the latter to give a little 
smoothness, or it may endanger falling. 

Washing now and then with milk, after the above sweeping 
and dry-rubbing them, gives a^ beautiful a look, and they are 
less slippery. 

7b dust Carpets and Floors, — Sprinkle tea-leaves on them, 
then sweep carefully. 

The former should not be swept frequently with a whisk- 
brush, as it wears them fast ; only once a-week, and at other 
times with the leaves and a hair-brush. 

Fine carpets should be gently done with a hair hand-brush, 
such as is used for clothes, on the knees. 

To clean Carpets, — Take up the carpet, let it be well 
beaten, then laid down, and brush on both sides with a hand- 
brush ; turn it the right side upwards, and scour it with ox- 
gall and soap and water very clean, and dry it with linen cloths. 
Then lay it on grass, or hang it up to dry. 

7b blacken the fronts of stone Chimney-pieces, — Mix oil- 
vamish with lamp-black, and a little spirit of turpentine to 
thin it to the consistence of paint. Wash the stone with soap 
and water very clean ; then sponge it with clear water ; and 
when perfectly dry brush it over twice with this colour, letting 
it dry between the times. It looks extremely well. The 
lamp-black must be sifted first. 

To clean the back of the Grate^ the inner Hearth^ and the 
fronts of cast-iron Stoves, — Boil about i lb. of the best black 



646 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXIL 






lead with a pint of small-beer and a bit of soap the size of a 
walnut When that is melted, dip a painter's bruMh, and wet 
the g^te, having first brushed off all the soot and dust ; then 
take a hard brush and rub it till of a beautiful brightness. 

Another way to clean cast-iron and blcu:k HearUu. — Mix 
black lead and whites of eggs well beat^i together; dip a 
painter's brush, and wet all over ; then rub it bright with a 
hard brush. 

To preserve Irons from Rust, — Melt fresh muttonnsnet, 
•mear over the iron with it while hot ; then dust it well with 
unslaked lime pounded and tied up in a muslin. IrcHisso 
prepared will keep many months. Use no oil for them at any 
time, except salad-oil, there being water in all other. 

Fire-irons should be kept wrapped in baisse, in a dry place, 
when not used. 

Another way. — ^Beat into 3 lbs. of unsalted hogVlaid 2 
drachms of camphor, sliced thin, till it is dissolved ; then take 
as much black lead as will make it of the colour of broken 
steel. Dip a rag into it, and rub it thick on the stove, &C., 
and the steel will never rust, even if wet. When it is to be 
used, the gp*ease must be washed off with hot water, and the 
steel be dried before polishing. 

To take Rust out of Steel. — Cover the steel with sweet oil 
well rubbed on it, and in 48 hours use unslaked lime finely 
powdered, to rub until all the rust disappears. 

To take the black off the bright Bars of polished Stoves in 
a few minutes. — Rub them well with some of the following 
.mixture on a bit of broad-cloth : when the dirt is removed, 
wipe them clean, and polish with glass (not sand) paper. 

JFor Mixture,— Boil slowly 1 lb. of soft soap in 2 quarts of 
water to 1. Of this jelly take 3 or 4 spoonfuls, and mix to a 
consistence with emery. 

To clean Tin Covers. — Get the finest whiting, which is 
only sold in large cakes, the small being mixed with sand; 
mix a little of it powdered with the least drop of sweet oil, 
and rub well, and wipe clean ; then dust over them some dry 
whiting in a muslin bag, and rub bright with dry leather. 
The last is to prevent rust, which the cook must be careful to 
guard against by wiping them dry, and putting them by the 
fire when they come from the parlour ; for if but once himg 
up without, the steam will rust the inside. 



Chap. XXXn.] DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. ^47 

Or : — 2 oz. of soft soap and i lb. of rotten stone, beaten to 
a paste with boiling water. 

F'tne Blacking for Shoes. — Take 4 oz. of ivory-black, 3 oz. 
of the coarsest sugar, a tablespoonful of sweet oil, and a pint 
of small beer ; mix them gradually, cold. 

The best method of cleaning Knives, — ^Have the board 
properly prepared with leather, and clean the knives with 
equal quantities of rotten stone and iron filings. 

The machine for cleaning knives, invented by Kent, is one of 
the best household improvements that has been produced for a 
very long period. It appears rather expensive in the first 
instance, but the saving of time in cleaning the knives, the 
absence of dirt, and the certainty of always having a brilliant 
polished blade, are advantages that cannot pass unnoticed in 
any establishment. It is particularly adapted to large families. 

They are to be procured at most of the ironmongers', and at 
Kent's shop in the Strand. 

To take Stains out of Marble, — Mix unslaked lime in finest 
powder with the stronger soap-ley, pretty thick, and instantly 
with a painter's brush lay it on the whole of the marble. In 
2 months* time wash it off perfectly clean ; then have ready a 
fine thick lather of soft soap, boiled in soft water ; dip a brush 
in it, and scour the marble. This will, with very good rub- 
bing, give a beauti^ polish. 

To take Iron-stains out of Marble, — ^An equal quantity of 
fresh spirit of vitriol and lemon-juice being mixed in a bottle, 
shake it well ; wet the spots, and in a few minutes rub with 
soft linen till they disappear. 

To clean Marble, — Mix i lb. of soft soap with the same of 
pounded whiting, 1 oz. of soda, and a piece of stone-blue the 
size of a walnut ; boil these together for i of an hour ; whilst 
hot rub it over the marble with a piece of flannel, and leave it 
on for 24 hours ; then wash it off with clean water, and polish 
the marble with a piece of coarse flannel, or, what is better, a 
piece of an old hat. 

To expel Rats, — Catch one in a trap; muzzle it, with 
the assistance of a fellow-servant, and slightly singe some of 
the hair ; then smear the part with turpentine, and set the 
animal loose ; if again caught, leave it still at liberty, as the 
other rats will shun the place which it inhabits. It is said to 



MS MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. FChap. XXXIL 



be a ftct, that a toad placed in a house-oellar will have the 
effect of expelling rats. 

2b dutroy Bugs in a few hours, — ^Take i lb. of dl of 
turpentine, and with a brush rub the beds, walls, or any places 
infested with them ; if they are in great numbers, brush the 
places over several times, which mil not only destroy the 
bugs, but also their e^^A. Although the smell of turpentme 
b strong, yet it is not unhealthy, and goes offin a short time. 

To test Mushrooms, — ^Rub the upper skin with a gold ring 
or any piece of gold : the part rubbed will turn yellow if it is 
a poisonous fungus.

CHAPTER XXXIII. 



DINNER COURSES AND ARTICLES IN SEASON. 



DINNER COURSES. 

882. — First Course, — Various Soups . . Fish, dressed many 
ways . . Boiled Meats and stewed . . Tongue . . Ham . . Bacon 
. . Chawls of Bacon, Turkey and Fowls, chiefly boiled . . Rump, 
Sirloin, and Ribs of Beef stewed, or, if for large parties, 
roasted . . Leg, Saddle, and other roast Mutton . . Roast 
Fillet, Loin, Neck, Breast, and Shoulder of Veal — the latter, 
however, looked upon as a mere family dish ; Leg of Lamb . . 
Chine . . Lamb's Head and Mince . . Mutton, stuff^ and roasted 
. , Steaks, variously prepared . . Leg of Pork, Chine, Loin, 
Sparerib . . Ragouts and Fricassees . . Curry . . Meat Pies, raised 
and in Dishes . . Patties of Meat, Fish, and Fowl . . Stewed 
Pigeons . . Rabbits, boiled . . Vegetables, boiled and stewed . . 
Calfs Head different ways . . Pig's Feet and Ears different 
ways . . In large dinners, 2 Soups top and bottom and 2 dishes 
of Fish. 

The entrees, or comer dishes, for the first course, should be 
small, and those which can be dressed in a crown, like cote- 
lettes or fillets of various kinds, are preferable ; they should 
not require carving. For this reason, chickens, vol-au- vents, 
or such like, should be served for " flancs." When the dinner 
admits only of 4 entrees, 2 should be light and 2 solid ; the 
latter may be made to look light by being carried to a height 
corresponding to their breadth. 

Second Course, — Venison, Hare, Birds, and Game of all 
sorts . . Shell Fish, cold and potted . . Collared and potted 
Fish . . Potted Birds, and all sorts of side-dishes, as entre- 
mets . . Ribs and Fore-quarter of Lamb roasted . . Brawn . . 
Vegetables, stewed and in season . . French Beans . . Peas . . 
Asparagus . . Cauliflower . . Spinach, and Artichoke bottoms • • 



650 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XXXHL 

Stewed Celery . . Sea-E[ale . . Fruit Tarts and Preserves of 
vkrious sorts with the list of sweet dishes, of which abundance 
are given in the foregoing receipts ; such as Creams, Jellies, 
and all the finer sorts of Puddings, Mince Pies . . Macaroni, 
Omelette, &c. 



Any of the following things may be served as a rehsb, 
with the cheese, after dinner : — Baked or pickled Fish, done 
high . . Dutch pickled Herring . . Sardines, which eat like An- 
chovy, but are larger . . Anchovies . . Potted Char . . Potted 
Lampreys . . Potted Birds seasoned highly . . Caviare and Sip- 
pets of Toast . . Salad . . Radishes . . Cold Butter . . Potted 
Cheese . . Anchovy Toast, and Dutch Herring pickled ; hot 
these are not usual at elegant tables, though at friendly and 
family dinners some of them may be introduced. 

In some houses, if soup be served, it is customary, in small 
family parties, to send it up alone. In others, a course of 
Soups and Fish : then Meats and Boiled Fowls, Turkey, &c: 
Made Dishes and Game follow ; and lastly, Sweet Dishes : 
but these removes are only employed at large dinners. Vege- 
tables, if plainly dressed, are put on the side-table at large 
dinners, as likewise sauces, and servants bring them round ; 
but some inconveniences attend this plan, and, when there are 
not many to wait, delay is occasioned. If the table is of a 
due size, the articles alluded to will not fill it too much. 

It is worthy of observation here, that cooks do not always 
think of sending up such articles as are in the house unless 
ordered ; though by so doing, the addition of anything col- 
lared or pickled, some fritters, fried patties, or quickly-made 
dumplings, would be useful when there happen to be acci- 
dental visitors : and at all times it is right to better the ap- 
pearance of the table rather than let things spoil below, by 
which the expense of a family is more increased than can be 
easily imagined. 

Hot suppers are not much in use where people dine very late ; 
and when required, nothing boiled should ever be introduced. 
If fish be served, only the smaller sorts, fried, should be 
brought to table ; with the sole exception of shell-fish, which 
may be dressed hot in any way. When required, the top and 
bottom, or either, may be Game . . Fowls . . Rabbit . . Oysters 
stewed or scaWo^^ . . "l^xe^Oa-^^axfi* . « Q«jQJx€L<iwer, or Jeru-

salem Artichokes, in White Sauce . . Broccoli with Eggs • . 
Stewed Spinach and Eggs . . Sweetbreads . . Small Birds . . 
Mushrooms . . Potatoes in Shapes . . ScallopB, &c. . . Cutlets . . 
Boast Spanish Onions . . Salmagundi . . Buttered Eggs on 
Toast . . Omelettes aux fines herbes, ot a la Tartare . . Cold 
Neat's Tongue . . Ham . . Collared Meats . . Hunter's Beef sliced 
. . Kusks buttered, with Anchovies . . Grated Hung Beef with 
Butter, with or without Kusk, dressed in the middle of a 
plate, and surrounded with a garnish . . Castards in glasses . . 
Oysters cold or pickled . . Potted Meats . . Fish . . Birds . . &c. 
. . Grood Plain Cake sliced . . Pies of Birds or Fruit . . Crabs . . 
Lobsters . . Prawns . . Cray-fish, though usually brought to 
table cold, may yet be dressed hot, and, if well made up, are 
very good . . Any of the list of sweet things or fruits. A sand- 
wich tray with any of the above articles looks well, or placed 
at a little distance from each other on the table, without the 
tray, if preferred. 

The lighter the things, the better they appear, and glass in- 
termixed has the best effect. Jellies, different coloured things, 
and flowers, add to the beauty of the table. An elegant 
supper may be served at a small expense by those who know 
how to make trifles that are in the house form the greatest 
part of the meal.
