MY favorite recipe — a simple sentence, 
meaningless as Sanskrit perhaps to the 
average man, but oft times a veritable 
gold mine of culinary wealth to woman. My 
favorite recipe — my mother's favorite recipe and 
possibly her mother's favorite recipe ; guarded 
and cherished as a family heirloom . How often 
has it lent its helping hand in forming the piece 
de resistance of a charming repast on some special 
occasion where the hostess was a little more 
anxious than usual to please. Small wonder it is, 
therefore, that to housewives of today our favorite 
recipes are literally worth their weight in gold" 
and carefully indeed should we preserve them. 
In this little book you will find an ideal place to 
preserve the ones you value most and also some 
new recipes which I would ask you to try, and 
specially do I recommend those in which Armour's 
Extract of Beef appears, for I firmly believe one 
trial will convince you of its worth and demon- 
strate to you its value as an indispensable con- 
comitant in things culinary. Lowell says: Earth's 
noblest thing — a woman perfected" — Perhaps 
'my favorite recipe" will prove a stepping stone 
towards your perfection. If it does we shall feel 
well repaid for publishing the book.

Beneath the candle lights' soft glmv 
The silver shines on damask snow. 
Of joys to come the glasses tell. 
The steaming soup invokes a spell. 
My lady smiles, her guests are pleased. 
Their taste delighted — appetite appeased.

SOUP is like the sun — it must be looked forward to three hundred 
and sixty-five days in each year. It is one of the inevitable 
things of life. It cannot be evaded. 

The art of soup-making has ramifications which puzzle even a 
connoisseur. The cook-books contain a fearsome array of formulse, 
each more complicated than the last. The safest thing for the 
housewife to do is to provide herself with a supply of Armour's 
Extract of Beef and stick to that. With it as a foundation soup 
may be prepared in a remarkably short time compared with the 
old-time methods, and the expense will be far less than that which 
attended the antiquated, complex ways. 

A few general rules must be borne in mind in using Armour's 
Extract of Beef. The Golden Rule is : Never use too much of it. 
Armour's Extract of Beef is very highly concentrated. It is about 
four times as strong (hence four times as economical) as most of 
the other brands on the market. If too much is used, the result 
is likely to be a slightly burnt flavor which will not be desirable. 
A little of it is delicious. Too much spoils the broth, like too 
many cooks. 

For a clear soup, such as bouillon, rice or spaghetti, use one 
teaspoonful of Armour's Extract of Beef to every quart of water. 

For a puree, bisque, or a soup which has substance or body, use 
one-half teaspoonful of Armour's Extract of Beef to every quart of 
water. 

For soups which have a stock of their own, use one-fourth tea- 
spoon of Armour's Extract of Beef to every quart of water. 

A puree or cream soup must be bound together to keep it from 
separating. Melt butter and when it bubbles add an equal quantity 
of flour. When well mixed, add to the boiling soup. 

Allow all vegetable purees to boil up quickly for a few minutes 
after the puree and stock have been mixed. This will clarify them.

THERE is an intangible, fascinating something about European 
cooking that lures the fagged appetite into activity. Ameri- 
can cooks have sighed loud and long to learn the secret. 
The whole story can be told in four words — ARMOUR'S 
EXTRACT OF BEEF." 

European housewives are alive to the value of meat flavoring in 
the seasoning of food. They use it in vegetable dishes, eggs, 
entrees, in fact, in almost every department of cookery. In 
Germany a jar of extract of beef is kept on the dining table along 
with the salt and pepper and other condiments, and is added to 
the dishes to suit the taste. Italian and French cooks employ it to 
give the characteristic flavor which marks their dishes as triumphs 
of the art culinary. 

Armour's Extract of Beef may be used with satisfactory results 
in seasoning almost any vegetable dish. 

Food experts declare the cheaper cuts of beef really are the 
more nutritious. The trouble always has been that these cheap 
cuts lack the rich flavor of the prime parts. By using a small 
quantity of Armour's Extract of Beef, which is made from prime 
beef, to impart the flavor which is lacking, these inexpensive cuts 
of meat may be cooked so as to be alluringly palatable. 

As the basis of sauces and gravies. Armour's Extract of Beef 
will be found especially valuable. It gives flavor, color and zest. 

The delicious relish of meats, lost after they have been cooked 
and warmed over, may be restored by using Armour's Extract of 
Beef. In using warmed over meats, either in the form of stews, 
croquettes or salads, it will be found invaluable. It provides the 
smack which suggests more."

in long strips rather than broken 
into small pieces. To accotnplish 
this hold the quantity to be 
cooked in the hand and dip the 
ends into boiling salted water. 
As the spaghetti softens it will 
bend and may be coiled under 
the water. 

Cook spaghetti thirty minutes.

THE chafing dish was not invented for the sole purpose of 
concocting Welsh Rarebits. To be sure, chafing dish cookery 
is necessarily restricted to certain dishes and it cannot be 
used for all purposes; but it is possible to boil, broil, stew and fry 
provided the right kind of materials are used. 

It is impracticable to attempt to serve a large meal from the 
chafing dish. If anjthing elaborate is planned it will be necessary 
to have at least two or three chafing dishes, and even then the 
results will be disappointing. Unless the work is arranged in a 
systematic manner confusion will result. Have all the materials 
for preparing the meal on a small table near at hand. The sugar, 
salt, pepper, flour and other condiments should be accuratel.v 
measured, ready for use. Have the butter in small pats on a dish. 
If whipped cream is to be used prepare it in advance, place it in a 
deep bowl and keep it in a cool place until it is required for use. 
Have the meats seasoned and ready to form into whatever cooked 
dish is to be prepared. Grate the cheese and wipe the eggs 
clean. Wash the parslej' and cress. If toast is to be used, prepare 
it over the gas or coal fire, for toasting cannot be properly done in 
a chafing dish. By doing all this beforehand the work will be 
greatly lessened. 

Light ragouts, omelets and egg dishes, creamed dishes, light 
stews, fish savouries, curries, etc, , are the most suitable for the 
chafing dish. 

Where slow cooking is required for creams, rarebits and sauces 
the hot water pan must always be used. -For frying or broiling 
remove the hot water pan and place the pan near the flame. This 
is accomplished by setting the lamp on a standard supplied especi- 
ally for this purpose.

Soluble Beef being entirely free from alcohol, narcotic or pre- 
servative of any kind, may be taken freely and in copious draughts 
without the slightest injury to the mental or physical organism, 
and it imparts to the system the greatest amount of nutriment in a 
form best suited to the enfeebled powers of digestion. 

Soluble Beef is the ideal food, not only to restore the strength 
of the convalescent or invalid, but to be taken regularly as a bracer 
and tonic by those who are not and wish to keep from being ill. 

Armour's Soluble Beef is made from Beef every ounce of 
which has been inspected by United States Government In- 
spectors.

minced onion. 

Set the tomatoes in a baking 
dish, cover with buttered bread 
crumbs and bake untU chestnut 
brown in color. Just before 
sending to the table, squeeze over 
them the juice of one lemon. 



MEASURING HINTS 

A cupful of liquid means all the cup 

vpill hold 
A spoonful of liquid is all the spoon 

■will hold 
Salt, flour, seasonings, spices, butter 

and all solids are measured level 
To measure a level spoonful, dip the 

spoon into the dry material, taking 

up a heaping spoonful, then level it 

off even with the edge of the spoon 

with a knife 
To measure a part of a spoonful, cut 

lengthwise of the spoon for the half 

and crosswise for the quarter. 
A tablespoonful of butter melted 

should be measured before melting 
A tablespoonful of melted butter 

should be measured after being 

melted 
Measure a cupful of cream whipped 

before it is whipped 
Measure a cupful of whipped cream 

after it is whipped 
Always sift flour, salt, baking powder, 

spices, powdered sugar and soda 

before measuring. If measured in 

a. solid state before sifting much 

more than the quantity called for 

will be used

SCOUSE 

Peel and slice very thin several 
potatoes. Slice thin cold roast 
beef and Spanish or large dried 
onions. In the bottom of a 
large baking pan put first a layer 
of potatoes, then a layer of meat 
and then onions. Add plenty of 
salt and pepper between the 
layers. Again alternate layers 
of each until the pan is fuU. Fill 
the pan half fuU of water, adding 
any left-over gravy that may be 
at hand. Sprinkle flour over the 
top and bake until the potatoes 
are soft all the way through and 
brown on top. Eat while very 
hot. 

MIXING HINTS 

When the recipe says to " stir " a 
mixture it means to stir it round 
and round, blending the materials 
and gradually increasing the circle. 

" Beating " means to mix over and 
over. Always let the bowl of the 
spoon touch the bottom of the mix- 
ing bowl and carry the mixture 
across to the opposite side. Repeat 
this until all of the air-cells possible 
have been incorporated with the 
mass 

"Folding" or ''cutting" means to 
turn the mixture over, cut down 
and lift up, folding the mass so as 
just to blend the materials but not 
break the air-cells 



KOOKERY KINKS 

Rub the broiler lightly with a 
clove of garlic before putting in a 
steak to broil. Rub the pan in 
the same way if the steak is to 
be pan-broiled. 

Gravy from a roast of pork is 
creamy and not appetizing in 
appearance. Use a little of 
Armour's Extract of Beef and a 
rich brown color may be obtained.

Fish may be scaled more 
quickly if dipped in boiling water 
for a moment. 

When cookjng potatoes or 
vegetables of any kind, a granite 
pan containing canned vegetables 
or left-overs which merely need 
to be warmed, may be set over 
the top of the kettle. This means 
quite a saving of gas in the long 
run. 

A weU-beaten white of egg 
added to mashed potatoes, whip- 
ping the potato hard before serv- 
ing, will add to the looks and 
taste of the dish. 

AU soups are improved by 
adding Armour's Extract of Beef, 
even if you use your own stock. 

Do not wash meats in water — 
wipe them with a wet cloth. 

The whites of eggs will whip 
more readily if a pinch of salt is 
added to them. If the eggs are 
placed in cold water for a. time 
before being broken, they will 
whip easily. 

To prevent milk or cream from 
curdling when used in combina- 
tion with tomato, add a bit of 
bicarbonate of soda before they 
are mixed. 

A small quantity of bicarbonate 
of soda, stirred into mUk or 
cream, will keep it from souring 
in hot weather. 

When you are hungry and have 
no time to prepare a lunch, spread 
a, bit of Armour's Extract of 
Beef on a. cracker or piece of 
bread. It tastes good and sat- 
isfies. 

In mixing liquids with solids, 
add the liquid to the solid by de- 
grees. They will blend more 
readily.

To get the meats of pecan 
nuts whole, soak the pecans over 
night in water. Next morning 
crack them on the end. The 
meats will come out without 
breaking. 

Slices of lemon, skin and all, 
eaten with sugar or salt, will kill 
the odor of onions on the breath. 

If you have no ice, and wish 
custards, gelatines, etc., to "set" 
in a hurry, cover the mold with 
a dish and place it under the 
hydrant, allowing the cold water 
to run over it. 

If the cream seems too thin to 
whip, place the >.'ish containing 
it in another dish of cold water, 
leaving it there until it is well 
chilled. Then put it into a pan 
of hot water. It will whip with- 
out difficulty. 

An egg, well beaten, added to 
rhubarb pies, will thicken the 
rhubarb and improve the taste. 

If not convenient to make and 
serve soup as a first course, pre- 
pare bouillon made from Ar- 
mour's Tomato BouUlon. It is 
easy to make and it's delicious. 

To preserve the color of green 
vegetables, put them on to cook 
in boiling water with a pinch of 
soda ; or, keep the cover off the 
kettle while boiling them. 

If a vegetable or cereal burns, 
plunge the vessel containing the 
burned mass into cold water and 
allow it to remain for a few min- 
utes before pouring the contents 
into another pan. This will do 
away almost entirely with the 
burned taste which is so dis- 
agreeable. 

Try mixing ginger cookies with 
cold coffee instead of water.

If you use too much salt by 
mistake, add a trifle of sugar or 
of vinegar, according to the dish. 
This will counteract the salty 
taste. 

If potatoes are boiled in salted 
water for ten minutes, then put 
into the oven, they wiU bake 
more quickly. The boiUng water 
will heat them through more rap- 
idly than if they were placed cold 
in the oven. 

Don't worry about gravy. If 
none is at hand make some with 
Armour's Extract of Beef, water, 
butter and flour, seasoned with 
salt and pepper. 

Save the waste pieces, rind and 
core of pineapples. Add to them 
one cupful of sugar, two cupfuls 
of water and the rind of one- 
quarter of an orange. Boil until 
sirupy. Strain through a vege- 
table press. Use this sirup for 
flavoring, or pour it over fruit 
salad, or bananas and oranges 
cut up together. 

When ice is not to be had, half 
fill a large, flat-bottomed bowl of 
earthenware or graniteware with 
cold water. Set in this the 
vessels containing milk, butter, 
sauces, etc. Cover with napkins 
which dip down into the water, 
and set the whole thing in a 
draft. Evaporation will keep 
everything sweet and cool. 

Melons may be chilled in mid- 
summer by wrapping them about 
with a burlap sack, saturating 
this with water and KEEPING 
IT WELL SATURATED, and 
placing it in the direct rays of 
the sun for a time. Evaporation 
does the work.

The bread will be as light in the 
morning as in hot weather. 

Cream that is too thin to whip 
may be made to do so by adding 
the unbeaten white of an egg be- 
fore beginning to whip it. 

All glassware, lamp chimneys

Use a large sponge for general 
house cleaning instead of a cloth 
or brush. It gets a good grip on 
the dirt and is not so sloppy. 

If the white porcelain of the 
sink becomes stained, wet it and 
sprinkle chloride of lime into it. 
Let stand about half an hour and 
it win become white. 

Fruit cake recipes usually call 
for dried currants. These are 
hard and lack flavor. Try using 
an equal measure of chopped 
prunes. They hold moisture and 
impart a delicious flavor to the 
cake. 

White lead mends china. Keep 
a pot of it at hand, and as soon as 
a dish is broken daub the cracked 
pieces with the white lead, using 
a match to put it on. Press the 
edges firmly together and put 
away for two or three weeks to 
harden. After a. week remove 
the extra lead sticking to the 
outside, but do not use the dish 
until perfectly hardened. 

Before tacking down linoleum, 
let it lie in place and be walked 
on for a few days. This will 
make it lie perfectly smooth. 

If boiled eggs are to be sliced, 
put them over the fire in cold 
water and let them remain fif- 
teen minutes after the water 
begins to boil. Let them cool 
in the same water. If they are 
cooled by dropping them into 
cold water they will not slice 
smoothly. 

To prevent fruit pies from boil- 
ing over while baking, add a 
tablespoonful of cornstarch to the 
fruit. Sweeten the fruit to taste, 
add cornstarch and heat before 
adding the crust.
