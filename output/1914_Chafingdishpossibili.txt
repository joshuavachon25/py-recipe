THIS BOOK IS LOVINGLY DEDICATED 

BY THE AUTHOR 



Blest be the spot, where cheerful guests retire. 
To pause from toil, and trim their evening fires 
Blest that abode, where want and pain repair. 
And every stranger finds a ready chair; 
Blest be those feasts with simple plenty crown' d. 
Where all the ruddy family around 
Laugh at the jests of pranks that never fail, 
Or sigh with pity at some mournful tale. 
Or press the bashful stranger to his food. 
And learn the luxury of doing good I 



Goldsmith 



We may live without poetry, music, and art; 

We may live without conscience, and live without heart; 

We may live without friends, we may live without books; 

But civilized man cannot live without cooks. 

He may live without books, — what is knowledge but 

grieving ? 
He may live without hope, — what is hope but deceiving ? 
He may live without love, — what is passion but pining f 
But where is the man that can live without dining f

GLIMPSES OF CHAFING DISHES IN 
THE PAST 

There seems to exist in the minds of many 
the wholly to be contradicted notion that the 
chafing dish is a utensil of modern invention. 
Although its origin is enveloped in darkness, 
" looking backward o'er the ages " many allu- 
sions are made to its use. 

Imagine, if you can, the Israelites, those dwell- 
ers in tents, feasting upon the locusts of Egypt 
and Palestine cooked in a utensil corresponding 
in many particulars to the chafing dish of the 
present day. 

Among the ruins of Pompeii have been found 
bronze chafing dishes of unique designs and care- 
ful workmanship, which give undisputed proof 
of their use in this city, which contained the 
villas of many wealthy Romans. What a rich 
store of knowledge concerning Roman home 
life has been gained from these excavations 1 
«3 



Chafing Dish Possibilities 

Mommsen, in his "Romische Geschichte," 
refers to the lavish display at the tables of the 
Romans, and affirms that expense was never 
considered in their hospitality. In those days, 
he asserts, "A well-wrought bronze cooking 
machine came to cost more than an estate." 
What a trifling difference between these and 
our modern chafing dishes! 

The history of France, that land to which we 
ever look for gastronomic delights, furnishes 
many an illustration of the high esteem in 
which chafing dishes have been held by many 
of the mightiest of their land. 

Louis XV., according to Goncourt, took 
much delight in cooking, and often amused 
himself " by making quintessential stews in sil- 
ver pans." The palate of Louis XVI. was often 
tickled by " piping hot dishes, brought in on a 
chafing dish." 

Napoleon Bonaparte, when laying down the 
affairs of war and enjoying for a short period 
the joys of home life, has cooked, — as Baron 
Meneval writes, — in a silver chafing dish, an 
omelet for the enjoyment of the empress and 
himself. 

Madame R6camier, the beautiful and intel- 
lectual society leader, whose salon was always 
filled with a brilliant circle, entertained by the 
14 



Chafing Dishes in the Past 

use of a chafing dish ; and many an historic 
speech has been made during the preparation 
of some viand fit for the gods. 

Madame de Stael, " the greatest woman in 
hterary history," when exiled by Napoleon 
Bonaparte from her beloved France, took with 
her, among household treasures, the chafing 
dish which played a not unimportant part in 
her Paris entertainments. 

Glancing at the lives of some of England's 
greatest literary men, it is found that a faithful 
history of the London clubs to which they 
belonged, reveals the history of their manners 
and their ways. From the time that Sir Walter 
Raleigh founded the " Mermaid " to the days 
of the famous " Literary Club," chafing dishes 
have appeared more or less conspicuously on 
the tables of those giants of old, where — 

" Mingled with the friendly bowl, 
The feast of reason and the floftr of soul." 

" I regard the discovery of a new dish as a 
far more interesting event than the discovery 
of a star ; for we have always stars enough, but 
we can never have too many dishes." If there 
are still those of this same opinion, with a chaf- 
ing dish for a companion, cannot they work 
their way to fame ?

CHAFING DISH SUGGESTIONS 

The chafing dish of to-day has accomplished 
much as a civilizer, seeming to rekindle the 
flames of hospitality and to elevate the stand- 
ard of cookery. Who can doubt its permanent 
stay! 

The bachelor feels himself proud to be called 
the pioneer in the use of this utensil. All must 
agree that epicureanism belongs to the lords of 
creation, and many an one has made himself 
quite famous by compounding some dish for 
" those palates who must have inventions to 
delight the taste." 

The broader and more valuable use of the 
chafing dish has asserted itself, and now it is 
found in the well-conducted home, where its 
appearance at the breakfast table means the 
cooking of eggs to perfection; at the lunch 
table, the savory rechauffd. The chafing dish 
should not find a place on the table when a 
ceremonial dinner is served ; but in the house- 
hold where but one maid is kept, the Thursday 
night meal is often anticipated on account of 
19 



Chafing Dish Possibilities 

its use. When the eye of the convalescent 
brightens and his appetite is stimulated by a 
choice tidbit prepared on the chafing dish, then 
its value is most appreciated, and it is consid- 
ered among the indispensables. All in all, the 
chafing dish is most happily in evidence when 
congenial spirits meet to make glad after " the 
lamps are lit," and " small cheer and great wel- 
come make a merry feast" 

So many and varied are the styles of chafing 
dishes, one must be governed by his taste and 
the extent of his purse strings in making a 
selection. Comparatively few can enjoy the 
luxury of a silver or silver-plated dish, so the 
choice lies between agate ware, nickel-plated, 
copper, or brass ones. The last two kinds men- 
tioned are not recommended, as much time 
needs be expended to keep them brightly pol- 
ished. If a moderate-priced dish is desired, 
preference is shown for the nickel-plated. Nickel- 
plated dishes are very attractive and may be 
easily kept clean and bright by washing in hot, 
soapy water, wiping dry with a soft towel, and 
rubbing with a piece of chamois skin or cotton 
flannel. 

The lower pan of the late chafing dish (known 
as the hot-water pan or bath) is supplied with 
two handles, which prove of great advantage 
20 



Chafing Dish Suggestions 

in moving the pan when heated. An accident 
from burning, in the household of a manufac- 
turer, suggested this valuable addition of handles, 
and also the addition of a tray on which to 
place this pan. 

The upper pan, familiarly called the blazer, 
is furnished with a long wooden handle, and is 
more often used alone than with the hot-water 
pan. The hot-water pan, however, plays a ne- 
cessary part, when the dish to be prepared con- 
tains eggs, or eggs and milk in combination, 
which should always be cooked at a low tem- 
perature. It is also of use to keep the viand 
hot, without further cooking, that a second serve 
may be as satisfactory as the first. The flame of 
the lamp should always'be extinguished, as soon 
as the cooking is accomplished. 

A circular chafing dish is supplied with one 
lamp, the wick of which is asbestos, covered 
with a fine wire netting. The flame is regu- 
lated by metal slides, which are controlled by 
an adjustable screw. The average lamp holds 
about one gill of alcohol, and will burn about 
one and one-half hours. Oval chafing dishes, 
which are not commonly used, are supplied with 
two or three lamps, the wicks of which are cotton 
lamp-wicking. The flame is regulated by turning 
the wicks by means of an adjustable screw. 

31 



Chafing Dish Possibilities 

The best grade of alcohol, known as high 
proof spirits, is recommended for chafing dish 
use. It gives more heat, burns without an odor, 
and proves less expensive than an inferior qual- 
ity. It is taken for granted that alcohol is to 
furnish the fuel, for the days of live coals and 
oil have passed away, and the days of gas and 
electricity are not yet at hand for those of mod- 
erate means. 

With a chafing dish outfit, an ambition natu- 
rally arises to collect pretty bowls and odd 
pitchers of various sizes, dainty jars and covered 
dishes to hold seasonings and condiments, and 
other unique choice pieces of china that may 
prove useful. 

The glass or granite ware measuring cups, 
divided into thirds and quarters, are absolutely 
necessary, as are tea and table spoons for meas- 
uring. Let it be remembered that level meas- 
urements are called for in the recipes con- 
tained in the following chapters of this little 
book. It must never be forgotten that accurate 
measurements are essential for good results. 
"Trifles make perfection, but perfection is no 
Irifle." 

As chafing dish cookery should be done as 
noiselessly as possible, a long-handled wooden 
spoon proves a desirable utensil during the prep- 

22 



Chafing Dish Suggestions 

aration of the dish ; while the large spoon with 
ebony handle may be reserved for the serving. 

The chafing dish should be placed on a metal 
tray, previous to the filling of the lamp, thus 
avoiding all danger of accident after lighting, 
should a draft of air or the expansion of the 
heated fuel cause the flame to spread outward 
and downward. This tray also serves as a pro- 
tection for the table, and admits of an easy 
removal of the dish when desired. 

He who most carefully anticipates the pleas- 
ure of his family or guests has much pre- 
paratory work done. As far as possible the 
ingredients should be measured and mixed be- 
fore the assembly of the party, and it is well if 
they be placed on the table or tray by the 
hands of the one who is to do the cooking, that 
" he may laugh as the play goes on." 

Accept as a final suggestion the plan of meas- 
uring butter by tablespoons and making into 
balls by the use of butter hands. These balls 
will keep in good shape if allowed to remain 
in a cold place until needed.
