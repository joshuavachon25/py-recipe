PREFACE 



IN revising the text-book for elementary classes in House- 
hold Science changes have been made adapting the 
book to present conditions. Now that special provision has 
been made for the training of teachers of household science, 
those parts of the first edition which were intended chiefly 
for the teacher have been omitted, and the remainder revised 
in conformity with the course in household science prescribed 
by the Department of Education for the public schools of 
Ontario. 

This book is prepared for the pupils and not intended in 
any way to take the place of the teacher, but to furnish a 
book of reference, recipes, and formulas suitable for school 
or home work. The use of a printed recipe insures correct- 
ness of language and quantity of material, which is often 
confused in a hurried copying from the blackboard, or from 
dictation, and allows more time for practice work under the 
direction of the teacher. 

Most of the recipes are made out in quantities suitable for 
a family, but are easily divided for individual work in the 
schoolroom. The cookery is simple and suited to beginners, 
but when the pupils have mastered the " why and wherefore" 
of the different processes, they will have little difficulty in 
carrying out the more elaborate recipes of any cook-book.

IV PREFACE. 

Only elementary work is attempted in this book. To enter 
more fully into the chemistry of food, bacteriology, etc., 
would create confusion in the mind of the average school girl, 
and tend to cause dislike of the subject. 

This little book will have served its purpose if it helps to 
arouse an interest in the noble art of home-making among 
the young girls of our country, and to bring the home and 
school into closer touch through this practical branch of 
education.

INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER. 
The Home. 

A history of the Home from the time when caves, 
or any other protection afforded by nature, served 
as a shelter for the family, to the modern home with 
all its conveniences and luxuries, is beyond the scope 
of an elementary text-book. 

Through all the ages women have been the home- 
makers. While the men were employed in hunting, 
fighting, and, in the newer countries, clearing the land, 
the women were occupied in the preparation, spinning, 
weaving, and making of flax and wool into clothing for 
their families; making the butter, cheese, candles, etc., 
gathering and preserving fruits, herbs, and other pro- 
ducts of nature for family use. Factory-made garments, 
canned goods, gas, electricity, and the numerous modern 
conveniences were unknown. The home, with its various 
occupations, was the only system of education known to 
the majority of girls. Few girls were employed in other 
than the household industries. 

The removal of many home industries to the shop and 
factory, larger and more elaborately-furnished houses, 
increased facilities for education and travel, and many 
other influences have made the work of modern houses 
very different from that of earlier days. The two 
important industries, which affect the physical welfare 
of humanity to a large degree, viz., cleaning and the 
preparation of food, are left to the home, and the success 

1 



2 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

of the homemaker depends largely upon her control of 
these industries. 

Nearly every woman is called upon, at some time, to 
direct the affairs of a household. Therefore, a systematic 
study of household operations will enable girls to obtain 
knowledge which will greatly conduce to the physical, 
mental and moral well-being of a people. 

Note. — Tlie teacher should endeavor to interest the class in the 
study of the home as a social institution, and the importance of 
following sound principles therein. She should also have the pupils 
draw plans of a house, with the various rooms, explain the situation, 
etc., and discuss the furnishing and decoration of an inexpensive 
house, etc. 



CHAPTER I. 

Pood. 

The course of study in physiology prescribed for 
the public schools will have given the student some 
information about the structure of the body and a 
primary knowledge of the food -stuffs and their 
digestion. 

The living body may be roughly compared to a very 
delicate and complicated engine which, in order to be 
kept efficiently at work, must be constantly undergoing 
repair, and must be supplied continually with fuel of 
the right kind and in the right amount. Certain of 
our food-stufFs, such as fats, starches and sugars, serve 
mainly as fuel: that is to say, they are burned within 
the body, and so enable it to do work — to move itself 
from place to place, for example — and to keep warm. 
Other foods, of which lean meat is a good example, are 
largely made use of to effect repairs in the complicated 
machinery of our bodies ; though they too may be made 
use of as fuel. Our bodies are, in this respect, much 
more perfect than any engine, for they are able so to 
prepare, by the processes of digestion and absorption, 
such food as lean meat, that it may be built up into 
the tissues of the body and thus allow its growth or 
repair. Even the foods that are used principally as 
fuel must undergo changes in digestion before the body 
can absorb them and make use of them. 

3 



4 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

We may distinguish different constituents in our 
foods which may be classified as follows*: — 

I. NITROGENOUS COMPOUNDS. 

1. Proteids. 

(1) Higher Proteids — these are coagulated by heat. White 

of egg consists largely of proteids of this kind, and 
hence when boiled is set and firm. Lean meat, fisli 
and eggs contain considerable percentages of higher 
proteids and somewhat smaller amounts of them are 
found in milk, legumes and cereals. 

(2) Albuminoids. These yield gelatin on boiling, which 

dissolves in the water. Connective tissue, bones 
and cartilage contain them most abundantly. 

2. Non-Proteids. 

They may bo roughly termed extractives. They are 
soluble in water, and aid jn giving flavor to food- 
stuffs, especially meat. To them in a large measure 
is due the flavor of meat soups. 

II. CARBO-HYDRATES. 

(1) Starches are soluble only in hot water, and are contained 

in large amounts in potatoes, cereals, eto. 

(2) Sugars are readily soluble in cold water. Considerable 

amounts are found in sugar cane, maple sap, beets 
and some otlier vegetables, fruits and milk. 

(8) Gums and doxtrins are not so readil}' soluble in water as 
sugars. They occur in fruits and vegetables. 

(4) Cellulose is insoluble in even boiling water. It forms 
the framework of all plants.

ttw atravc, Mid " Oelatinoldi " In pluoo of what are here termed "Albuminoids." 



FOOD. 



III. FATS. 



Fat, as it occurs in our foods, in meat for example, is 
a mixture of two or three different fats ; of these 
one is a liquid at ordinary temperatures, and is the 
main constituent of olive oil. The other two are 
solid, but also differ from each other. The differ- 
ences in the fat of different animals depends on the 
varying mixtures of these fats. 

IV. MINERAL MATTER AND ACIDS. 

Mineral matter, that is, the salts of various chemical 
elements, is found in smaller or larger proportions 
in all foods. 

Organic acids occur in fruits and aid in giving them their 
characteristic flavors. 

V. WATER. 

Forms the largest constituent, by weight, of many of our 
foods — for example, fruit, vegetables and meat — and 
also a large proportion of all but such dried foods as 
peas, beans, rice, etc., in which only ten per cent, to 
fifteen per cent, is found. 

We have gradually found out that these various 
constituents of our food-stuffs are used in different 
ways by our bodies, and that, in order to live properly, 
most of these constituents must be eaten. The higher 
proteids are essential. No amount of the other foods 
will prevent the animal dying of starvation if' no 
higher proteids are eaten. After being digested, they 
are absorbed and built up into our tissues as needed 
for growth and repair of the body. They may be used 
as fuel, that is, as a source of energy in the form of 
heat or of motion. The albuminoids cannot replace the 
higher proteids and are probably used as a source of 



6 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

energy only. The carbo-hydrates are not of value in 
tissue -building or repair; but, when digested and 
absorbed, serve as a source of energy. ^ They may, to 
a certain extent, be stored up in the form of a carbo- 
hydrate, called glycogen, or they may be converted 
into fat, and stored away as such. Cellulose is almost 
indigestible and is hence absorbed in but minimal 
amounts. 

Fats, when digested and absorbed, form a most 
valuable source of energy, as when burned they yield 
about two and a quarter times the amount of energy 
yielded by an equal weight of carbo-hydrate or of 
proteid. Consequently, when our bodies have to pro- 
duce much heat, they can make use of more fat than 
usual. Fat is, therefore, a more important article of 
diet to those who live in cold climates — the Esquimaux, 
for example — than for those who live in the tropics. 
Even here fat is of more value as a food in the cold of 
winter than during the summer. Fat meat or things 
fried in fat are also somewhat slowly digested. The 
acrid substances contained in overheated fat irritate 
the mucous membranes and hence interfere with 
digestion. 

Many mineral matters are also absolutely essential 
for the growtli and repair of our tissues (iron is, for 
instance, quite indispensable). They are, however, con- 
tained in ample amounts in our food, when we live on 
a mixed diet of meat and vegetables. If we confined 
ourselves exclusively to a vegetable diet, common table 
salt would be necessary. This necessity of adding 
common salt to vegetables Ims so affected our appe- 
tites, that it haa become a recognized custom to add 



FOOD. 7 

salt when cooking our food, to give it what we term 
flavor. 

Two thirds of the weight of our body is due to the 
water which it contains. In the urine, tlie sweat and 
the breath, a healtliy man loses about four and a half 
pints of water every day. If the body is to remain 
healthy and to do the work that is demanded of it, 
this loss must be continually made good. This is 
done in part by our food, which also, as was pointed 
out above, consists to a very large extent of water. 
Somewhat more than half of the weight of our food 
is due to the water it contains. But this is not 
suflicient to replace the water lost, and hence the 
natural desire for beverages. To make good the loss, 
we should drink about two and a half pints, or five 
large tumblers full, of fluid each day. 



Fuel. 



CHAPTER 11. 
The Cooking of Pood. 



The first requisite for cooking purposes is heat ; this 
necessitates the use of fuel. The fuels chiefly used for 
household purposes are wood, coal, kerosene oil and gas. 
Soft woods, such as pine or birch, are best for kindling 
and for a quick fire. Hard woods, beech, maple, etc., 
burn more slowly, retain the heat longer, and are better 
adapted for cooking purposes. Coal (anthracite) is about 
ninety-five per cent, carbon. It kindles slowly, gives a 
steady heat, and burns for a longer time without atten- 
tion than wood. Oil is considered to be the cheapest 
fuel. Gas is a very satisfactory and convenient fuel 
for cooking purposes, but can only be used in certain 
localities. 

Coal and gas are the chief fuels used in this country. 
The stoves and ranges used for cooking purposes, in 
which coal and gas are burned, vary greatly, and it is 
necessary to study each by itself to obtain the best 
results with a minimum expenditure of fuel. 

A good coal stove or range should have : — 

1. A fire-box large enough to admit coal to at least 
the depth of seven inches. 

2. Orate, as a bottom to the fire-box (a duplex grate is 
the best). 

3. Checks and dampers so that the fire may be readily 
controlled. 



TO MAKE AND CARE FOR FIRK 9 

4 Drafts perfect. 

5. Large oven space for size of range. 

6. A hot- water back, or, where this is not possible, a 
box for water at the back of the stove. 

7. Ash-pan. 

8. Stove-pipe. 

An oven for warming dishes is a desirable addition to 
a range. 

The construction of the range must be studied in 
detail to understand the arrangement of dampers, places 
to be cleaned, etc. 

To Make and Care for Fire in a Coal Range. 

1. Close all but the damper which gives a direct draft 
to chimney. 

2. Brush the ashes from the top of the oven into the 
fire-box and put the lid on. 

3. Empty the grate into the ash-pan (save all unbumed 
coal and cinders). 

4 Lay the fire. 

(a) Put in shavings or crushed paper. 

(b) Then small pieces of kindling, laid crosswise 

so as to allow plenty of air space. 

(c) Add a little hardwood and a single layer of 

coal. 

(d) Put on the covers, see that the direct draft 

and oven damper are open. 

(e) Light the shavings or paper. 



10 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

When the wood is thorouglily kindled, and the first 
layer of coal heated, fill the fire-box with coal even with 
the top of the oven. When the blue flame disappears 
close the oven damper, and when the coal is burning 
freely close the direct draft. 

When coal becomes bright red all through it has lost 
most of its heat. A great deal of coal is wasted by filling 
the fire-box too full and leaving the drafts open till the 
coal is red. There should always be black coal on top. 

To keep a steady fire it is better to add a little coal at 
a time rather than to add a large quantity and to let it 
bum out. Never allow dust or cinders to accumulate 
around a range, inside or out. Learn to open and to 
shut the oven door gently and quickly. 

To heat the oven, open the lower front damper and 
keep all others closed. 

To check the fire, open the slide in the check damper 
in front ; if not sufficient open the check in the pipe. 

To Clean the Range. 

After the fire is laid, and before lighting, if at all 
greasy wash the top of the range with warm soap-suds, 
wipe dry and with a dauber apply the stove polish. 
Rub slightly, then light the fire, and, as the iron heats, 
polish with a brush or stove mitten. When necessary 
to rub off the stove during the day use soft paper. 

The Qas Ranqe. 

A gas range should have : — 

1. At least four top burners (six are better). 

2. One or two sets of oven burners, for heating tlie

3. A baking oven. 

4. A broiling oven. 

5. Gas-cocks, one to each top burner, two to the oven 
burner so as to regulate the supply of gas. 

6. An oven lighter, or pilot light, at the right-hand 
side of the oven for lighting the oven burners. 

7. A stove-pipe connected with the chimney so as to 
carry off gases and odors. 

Study the arrangement of each gas-cock, how to 
light, etc. 

When the burners are not in use see that all gas-cocks 
are closed. If the gas is turned off at the connecting 
pipe, and not at each gas-cock, when next turned on it 
will escape, and if allowed to escape into the oven a 
dangerous explosion is likely to occur when the oven 
burner is lighted. 

To light a gas range, or to light a top burner, open the 
cock in the connecting pipe, then the one in the pipe 
supplying the burner, and apply a lighted match. If a 
double burner the first one when lighted will light the 
other when the cock is turned. To light the oven, first 
see that all the stop-cocks which control the supply of 
gas to the oven burners are closed, and both oven doors 
open. Open the pilot-light cock and light from the 
outside through the hole made for the purpose. Then 
open first one oven cock, then the other; one set will 
light the other. 

If the gas burns with a roaring noise turn off at once 
and re-light. 



12 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

For baking, light the oven burners and close the door 
ten or fifteen minutes before using. For broiling or 
toasting, light oven burners at least five minutes before 
required. Place the rack and pan close under the 
burners. 

To save gas. As soon as the contents of a kettle 
or saucepan come to the boiling point, turn down the 
gas as a much smaller flame will keep the pot boiling. 

The Effect of Heat upon Food-Stuffs. . 

As our food-stuffs contain in almost all cases such 
considerable amounts of water, the heat to which they 
are exposed in cooking, is, in almost all cases, a moist 
heat. As was noted above the higher proteids are 
coagulated by boiling (212° F.), and many of them at 
lower temperatures, the chief proteid of beef at 133° F., 
for example. Proteids coagulated by heat are less easily 
digested than before being coagulated. The albuminoids 
on heating, and especially on boiling, yield gelatin, and 
this is readily soluble in hot water. Water containing 
much gelatin (5/^) sets to jelly when cooled. The 
connective tissue which contains much albuminoid 
serves to bind meat together. Owing to the change 
in the albuminoid in cooking, the meat is held less 
firmly together, is more easily broken up in the 
process of digestion, and the higher proteids more 
readily got at and digested. Cooking thus probably 
helps rather than hinders the digestion of meat, but 
not of eggs where there is little or no albuminoid. 

Starch is dissolved by boiling water, and in the pro- 
cess becomes changed so that it remains in solution 



THE EFFECT OF HEAT UPON FOOD-STUFFS. 13 

when cool. Some starches do not need the water 
to boil in order to be dissolved, a heat of 149-185° F. 
being sufficient. Long heating, when moist or boiling, 
will change a small per cent, of the starch present 
into dextrins or sugars. The cellulose framework of 
vegetables and fruit is softened and somewhat broken 
down by cooking, but still remains almost entirely- 
indigestible. 

The various methods of cooking food develops certain 
flavors which are agreeable to the palate, offer variety 
in taste, and destroy many germs contained in the food 
which might otherwise be very injurious. 



CHAPTER III. 

Methods of Cooking. 

Heat may be applied to food directly, through the 
medium of metal, or through the medium of fat. In 
these cases the cooking is said to be in dry heat. When 
heat is applied through the medium of water it is called 
cooking in moist heat. The following are the chief 
methods employed : — 



Dry Heat. 


Moist Heat. 


Broiling. 


Simmering. 


Pan-Broiling. 


Boiling. 


Roasting. 


Steaming. 


Baking. 


Steeping. 


Frying. 




Sauteing. 





Combination of Dry and Moist Heat. 

Braising. 
Fricasseeing. 

Broiling. 

Broiling is cooking directly over hot coals or gas. 
The cut surfaces are seared, preventing the escape of 
juices, and especially palatable flavors are developed in 
the browned surfaces. Fish and tender meat only are 
suitable for broiling, e.g., porter-house steak, sirloin 
steak, young chicken, bacon and ham. 

Directions for Broiling over Coals. 

Have a clear, hot-coal fire. Grease the wires of the 
broiler with a piece of fat, place in it the moat and hold 

U 



METHODS OF COOKING. 16 

close to the fire for ten seconds, or, while counting ten 
slowly, turn and hold the other side over the fire for the 
same length of time. Continue turning the meat every 
ten seconds until well seared, then hold it a little farther 
from the fire and turn less frequently, until the article is 
cooked. For meat one inch thick eight minutes should 
be long enough, and if one and one-half inches ten 
minutes. (Illustrated by recipe No. 38.) 

Pan-Broiling. 

Pan-broiling is cooking on a very hot frying-pan. 

Directions for Pan-broiling. 

nave the steak or chops neatly trimmed, place on the 
hot pan so that the whole surface of the meat touches 
the pan, turn immediately (with the fingers) the first two 
or three times, and turn every ten seconds until the meat 
is seared, then turn less frequently until done. It will 
take about two minutes longer than broiling over the 
coals. (Illustrated by recipe No. 47.) 

Roasting. 

Roasting, properly speaking, is cooking before a fire. 
A " Jack " is required which, being wound up, causes the 
joint to revolve slowly before a bright fire. It is the 
same in principle as broiling, but is used only for larger 
cuts of meat. 

Note. — When we speak of "roast beef," etc., in this country it 
usually means cooking in an oven, or baking. 

Baking. 

Baking is cooking in the dry heat of an oven, a method 
by which almost every kind of food may be cooked. 
(Illustrated by recipe Nos. 69 or 93.) 



16 domestic scienck 

Frying. 

Frjnng is cooking by immersing in hot fat at a tem- 
perature of 380° to 400° F. 

Directions for Frying. 

1. The best frying kettle is of iron or steel, and should 
be about six inches deep. 

2. Various fats are used, such as olive oil, cottolene, 
lard and dripping. A combination of beef, mutton and 
pork fat makes an excellent fat for frying. 

3. The kettle should not be more than half full of fat. 
An eight-inch kettle will require about three pounds of 
fat. 

4. The fat must be the right temperature. This will 
be shown by the bubbles disappearing (bubbles indicate 
water), the surface becoming still, and a very faint 
smoke rising. It may be tested by dropping in an inch 
cube of bread, from the crumb : if it turns golden brown 
in sixty seconds it is suitable for uncooked mixtures : if 
in forty seconds for cooked mixtures. 

5. The articles should be lowered gently into the hot 
fat, a few at a time. A wire spoon or basket is generally 
used to put in articles which will not float. 

NoTK.— Should a drop of water be allowed to fall into the hot fat an 
explosion may follow. 

6. When the frying is finished, the fat should be 
cooled a little, then strained through a fine sieve and set 
aside to cool. The same fat may bo unod over and over 
unless it is spoiled by burning. It should be clarified 
occattionully. (Illustrated by recipe Nos. 109 or 71.) 



methods of cooking. 17 

Sauteing. 

Sauteing is cooking on a metal pan greased suffi- 
ciently to prevent the article from sticking to it. 

Directions for Sauteing. 

1. Various fats may be used to grease the pan. A bit 
of bacon rind, meat fat, dripping or butter. 

2. The pan should be heated hot and greased 
thoroughly, but the fat should not burn. 

3. The food should be cooked on one side then turned 
over and browned on the other side. (Illustrated by 
recipe Nos. 65 or 23.) 

Simmering. 

Simmering is cooking in liquid at a temperature of 
180° F. to 196° F. This method is used to soften connec- 
tive tissues and cellulose; to extract mineral and other 
matter. (Illustrated by recipe No. 45.) 

Boiling. 

In this method the food is surrounded by boiling 
liquid, which is kept boiling until the article is cooked. 
(Illustrated by recipe No. 19.) Rapidly-boiling water 
is no hotter than water boiling gently, and only foods 
which must be kept in motion should boil rapidly, e.g., 
rice, macaroni. (Rapid boiling is illustrated by recipe 
No. 37, and gentle boiling by recipe Nos. 16 or 19.) 

Steaming. 

Steaming in the ordinary household is cooking in the 
steam from boiling water. 



18 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

Directions for Steaming. 

1. See that the steamer is provided with a close-fitting, 
pointed cover, and that it fits the kettle closely. 

2. Fill the kettle half full of boiling water and keep 
it boiling rapidly the whole time the article is being 
cooked. 

3. Keep a kettle of boiling water ready to replenish 
the steamer-kettle when necessary. 

4. Keep the steaming food or dish inside away from 
the sides of the steamer. 

Steeping. 

Steeping is a method of extracting the flavor from 
substances. (Illustrated by recipe No. 5.) 

Directions for Steeping. 

1. Place the substance in a pan, add the necessary 
quantity of boiling water and cover closely. 

2. Keep in a warm place until the solution is of th^ 
desired strength. 

Braisinq. 

Braising is a combination of baking and steaming. 

Directions for Braising. 

1. A closely-covered and deep pan is necessary. 

2. The meat is placed on a bed of vegetables such as 
turnips, carrots, onions, etc. Enough water is added to 
nearly cover the vegetables and the pan covered closely. 



TIME-TABLE FOR COOKING. 19 

3. The pan is placed in a moderate oven and the food 
allowed to bake three or four hours. 

4. This is an economical and palatable way of cooking 
tough cuts of meat. (Illustrated by recipe No. 44.) 

Fricasseeing. 

Fricasseeing is a method of cooking meat which com- 
bines sauteing and simmering. 

Directions for Fricasseeing. 

1. Cut the meat in suitable pieces and saute them. 

2. Remove the pieces to stew-pan, make a flour gravy 
in the saute-pan, add it to the meat and cover closely. 

3. Simmer, until the meat is tender (from two to four 
hours). 

4. This is an excellent and palatable method of 
cooking tough meat. (Illustrated by recipe No. 42.) 

Note. — While some of the recipes indicated may seem somewhat 
advanced for beginners it must be remembered that the interest of the 
pupil should be aroused at an early stage. And the recipes are chosen 
for the purpose of comparing the different ways of applying heat to 
food.

CHAPTER IV. 

The Cooking of the Common Pood Substances. 

WATER— BEVERAGES. 

Pure drinking water is that which does not contain 
disease germs or other injurious matter. The chief 
characteristic of water is its solvent power. Rain or 
soft water has greater solvent power than hard water. 
This fact must be remembered in the cooking of vege- 
tables and in the preparation of beverages. Great care 
should be taken to secure pure water for drinking and 
cooking purposes (especially the former). 

Should there be any doubt as to the purity of the 
water used for drinking purposes it should be boiled and 
kept closely covered to prevent impurities from the air 
getting into it. Boiled water tastes very flat, and in 
order to restore the flavor it should be poured back and 
forth several times from one pitcher to another, or 
shaken in a large bottle. 

Great care must be taken of the vessels in which 
water is kept, especially for drinking purposes, and 
when used from pipes it should be allowed to run for 
some time before using. 

A beverage is the term applied to any liquid used as a, 
drink, and to quench thirst. Water is the beverage 
provided by nature, and supplies the demand of the 
body perfectly if taken in sufficient quantity. Any 
other beverage satisfies thirst simply by means of the 
water it contains. Many are only palatably-flavored 

23 



24 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

water, while others are more or less nourishing or 
stimulating. 

They may be classified as : 

1. Refreshing, e.g., lemonade and other fruit drinks. 

2. Nourisliing, e.g., milk, cocoa, etc. 

3. Stimulating, e.g., wines, beef tea, coffee, tea. 

1.— LEMONADE. 

^ lemon. I 3 tsps. sugar. 

§ cup ice cold water. | 

Cut a thin slice off the lemon and squeeze the juice 
from the rest. Put the juice and sugar in a glass 
(removing all seeds), add the slice of lemon and the cold 
water. Stir well immediately before serving. 

Note. — Lemons are a desirable addition to the diet owing to the 
mineral matter and acids they contain. Lemonade taken in moder- 
ation and not too sweet is a cooling and refreshing drink, especially 
in cases of fever. Sometimes the addition of a little lemon juice to 
an article of food, such as vegetables, fish, etc., renders them more 
palatable. 

2.— COCOA. 



1 to 2 tsps. cocoa. 
^ cup water. 
Pinch of salt. 



1 tsp. sugar. 
^ cup milk. 



Mix the cocoa, sugar, salt and water in a saucepan or 
inside part of double boiler. Boil gently ten minutes, 
closely covered. Add the milk and bring to scalding 
point ; beat thoroughly with a Dover egg-beater ; re-heat 
and serve. 

Note.— This is much Improved if cooked two or three hours in a 
double boiler before the milk is added. 

The nutritive value of cocoa is little more tlian that 
of tea or coffee, but as it is K^hs utimulating may be 



WATER — BEVERAGES. 25 

taken by children and young people with les8 harm than 
either tea or coffee. The composition of cocoa and choco- 
late are similar, although chocolate contains a little more 
fat than cocoa, and is, therefore, a little more difficult to 
digest. The chief nutritive value is in the milk used in 
the preparation of cocoa or chocolate. 

3.— BOILED COFFEE. 



1^ tbsps. coffee. 

1 tsp. egg, white ; or 



2 tbsps. cold water. 
§ cup boiling water. 

Scald a granite or earthenware cofFee-pot, add the cold 
water and the crushed shell of the egg and mix with the 
coffee. Put the mixture into the cofFee-pot, pour on the 
boiling water and stir thoroughly. Boil three minutes, 
then move to the back of the stove. If not boiled the 
coffee will not be clear, and if boiled too long the tannic 
acid is extracted. Stir and pour some into a cup so as 
to clear the spout from grounds. Return to the coffee- 
pot and repeat. Then add a tablespoon of cold water 
which will help to clear. Cold water being heavier than 
hot water sinks to the bottom, and carries the grounds 
with it. Stand where it will keep hot, but not boil, for 
five minutes and serve at once. If it must be kept 
longer, strain into another hot pot. No coffee is good 
that is kept long after it is ready. 

4— FILTERED COFFEE. 

2 tsps. finely-ground coffee. | § cup boiling water, 

A French coffee-pot is the best for this method of 

preparing coffee. Put the coffee in a strainer (a piece 

of cheesecloth may be fastened inside a coffee-pot to 

serve as a strainer), place the strainer in coffee-pot, set 



26 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

on warm part of stove, add gradually boiling water and 
allow it to filter. After the water has all filtered through 
the strainer pour the liquid again over the coffee grounds 
and filter a second time. If desired very strong it may 
be filtered a third time. Serve very hot. Put sugar and 
cream in cup before the coffee. If cream is not available 
use hot milk instead. 

The stimulating property of coffee is due to the alkaloid 
cafteine. When drunk in moderate quantities it acts as a 
mild stimulant to the nervous system, and indirectly aids 
the digestion slightly. An excessive use of caffeine, like 
that of many other drugs, leads to a chronic poisoning, 
and to an unhealthy nervous state. A moderate use of 
coffee is perhaps of dietetic value to adults, but children 
should not get into the habit of drinking it. The flavor 
of coffee is largely due to an essential oil. 

5.— TEA. 

2 or 3 tsps. tea. i Or 1 tsp. for § cup 

2 cups boiling water. | boiling water. 

Scald an earthen or china teapot. Put in the tea and 
pour on boiling water, cover closely and steep four or 
five minutes in a warm place (the lid of the tea-kiittle 
may be lifted and tlie teapot set over the steam) and 
serve at once. If it cannot be used immediately pour it 
off the leaves into another hot teapot. 

Tea, like coffee, is a stimulant and not a nutrient. It 
contains an alkaloid theino, which is cliemically identical 
with caffeine from coffee, and wliich luis the same mildly 
stimulant properties. It contains further, a volatile oil, 
to which the flavor is due, and an astringent substance, 
tannin. This latter, is not as soluble as the other two iu 



WATER — BEVERAGES. 27 

water, but goes gradually into solution when the tea is 
allowed to infuse for some minutes, and causes the bitter 
unpleasant taste in tea wliich has stood upon the leaves. 
Green tea contains more than twice as much of the 
astringent tannin than black tea, and is generally con- 
sidered less wholesome than the latter. 

The character of the water is of great importance. It 
should be freshly boiled, as prolonged boiling makes the 
water flat and affects the flavor. If the water is very 
hard, a tiny pinch of soda may be added to the teapot. 

Water should always be poured on tea at the boiling 
point, as it is only at the boiling point that some of the 
constituents can be extracted to which the beverage 
owes its aroma. Allowing tea to steep longer than five 
minutes, or to boil, extracts the tannic acid and makes it 
very injurious. 

While of little or no nutritive value, tea is useful in 
other ways. When properly made it aids in the assimi- 
lation of food, is refreshing and relieves bodily fatigue, 
it introduces considerable hot water into the system, 
which is beneficial when taken at the proper time. Tea, 
if taken in excess, has the same consequences as excess of 
coflfee. Large quantities of tea, as of any fluid taken 
with the meals, retards the digestion. If tea is infused 
too long, it will contain much of the astringent tannin, 
and is undoubtedly injurious, as the tannin interferes 
with the digestion and tends to constipation. Cheap 
teas are more apt to produce injurious effects than the 
more expensive varieties. 

Children and young people sliould not drink tea, as 
like coffee, it is too stimulating for young nerves. 



CHAPTER V. 

The Cooking of Fruit— Vegetables— Breakfast Cereals. 

FRUIT. 

Fresh fruits consist chiefly of water, but they contain 
valuable mineral matter and acids. Some fruits contain 
a considerable amount of carbo-hydrates, principally 
sugar and gum, e.g., apples, grapes and bananas. 

Dried fruits contain a much larger percentage of 
sugar and less water. 

When perfectly ripe and sound fresh fruit is more 
wholesome than when cooked. 

GENERAL RULES FOR COOKING FRUIT. 

A- Fresh Fruit. 

1. Stewed. — Put the prepared fruit in a saucepan with 
enough water to keep it fi'ora burning. Cover 
closely and boil gently until tender, stirring 
often. Add the sugar and let it boil a minute 
more. 

^. Cooked in Syrwp. — Make syrup of one part sugar 
to two or tliree parts water. Put the prepared 
fruit in the hot syrup, cover closely and simmer 
until tender. 

B. Dried Fruit. 

Wash the fruit thorouglily. Cover witli cold water 
and Hoak twenty-four liours. Put on to cook in the 
same water in which it was soaked. Add Bpices if

desired. ' Cover closely and simmer until tender. Add 
the sugar and simmer ten minutes longer. Take out the 
fruit and if necessary boil down the syrup, then pour it 
over fruit. 

6.— STEWED PRUNES. 

8 prunes. I ^ in. stick cinnamon. 

1 whole clove. I ^ tbsp. sugar. 

Follow the rule for dried fruit given above. With so 

small a quantity it will be necessary to boil down the 

syrup. 

7.— BAKED APPLES (Plain). 

Choose firm, perfect apples. Wash and wipe them. 
Put them in a shallow baking pan, and bake in a 
moderately hot oven until tender to the centre. Remove 
carefully to the serving dish, and serve hot or cold. 

8.— BAKED APPLES (Sweetened). 

Pare and core, without breaking, tart apples. Put 
them into a shallow earthen dish, fill the cavities with 
sugar, add water to cover the bottom of the dish. Bake 
in a quick oven until soft, basting often with the syrup. 
(Quinces may be baked in the same way.) 

9.— CODDLED APPLES. 

1 apple. I i cup water. 

I cup sugar. | 

Wash, core and pare the apple, keeping the apple 
whole. Put the sugar and water in a saucepan and boil 
two minutes. Add the fruit, cover closely and simmer 
until tender, turning occasionally. Take out the fruit 
carefully, pour the syrup over, and serve hot or cold. 
Note. — One cup of sugar will do six or seven apples.

1 cup cranberries. I | cup boiling water. 

4 cup sugar. I 

Pick over the berries, removing any imperfect ones. 
Put them in a saucepan, cover with boiling water and 
let stand a moment, then drain away all this water. 
Then add the quarter cup of boiling water and cover 
closely. Boil until the berries burst well, stirring occa- 
sionally; add the sugar and boil three minutes. Turn 
into a mold and stand away to cool. 

11.— CRANBERRY MOLD. 

Pick over and wash four cups of cranberries. Put in 
a stew-pan with one cup of boiling water and boil twenty 
minutes. Rub through a sieve, then add two cups of 
sugar and cook slowly ten minutes. Turn into a mold 
or glasses. 

12.— FRUIT SALAD. 

Arrange alternate layers of shredded pineapple, sliced 
banana and sliced oranges, sprinkling each layer with 
powdered sugar. 

To Prepare Fruit for the Salad. 

1. Pineapple. — Pare and cut out the eyes and pick off 

in small pieces with a silver fork. 

2. Oranges. — Remove skin and white covering, slice 

lengthwise so that the tough centre may not be 
served. 

3. Orapes. — Cut in halves and remove seeds. Chill 

before serving. 

4. Strawberries, apples, or malaga grapes may bo used 

in fruit salad. 



VEGETABLES. 31 

VEGETABLES. 

Dry vegetables contain a large percentage of albu- 
minoids and starch. The root vegetables contain a 
considerable amount of carbo-hydrates in the form of 
starch, sugar and gum. Each has its special value. 
They may be classified as follows : — 

1. Fresh. 

(a) Starchy, e.g., potatoes and parsnips. 

(b) Non-starchy, e.g., turnips, carrots, cabbage, tomatoes, 

celery, lettuce. 

2. Dried, e.g., peas, beans and lentils. 

General Rules for Cooking Vegetables in Water, 

A. Preparation. 

1. Wash and pare, peel or scrape the vegetable 

and cut it into convenient pieces. 

2. Unless fresh vegetables are taken right from 

the garden they should soak in cold water 
fifteen minutes to one hour before cooking. 

3. Dried vegetables should soak in cold water at 

least twelve hours before cooking. 

B. Cooking. 

1. Put all fresh vegetables on to cook in boiling 

water. 

2. Put all dried vegetables on to cook in cold 

water. 

3. Strong smelling vegetables must cook at sim- 

mering point ; the others may boil gently. 



32 DOMESTIC SCIENCK 

4. Salt the water for vegetables that grow above 

ground, including onions — one teaspoonful to 
one pint. 

5. Do not salt the water for vegetables that grow 

underground. 

C. The vegetable water, excepting from potatoes and 
dried peas and beans, should be saved for 
soups and sauces, as it contains most of the 
valuable mineral matter of the vegetable. 

13.— STEWED TOMATOES. 

Wash, cover with boiling water and peel the tomatoes ; 
put them in a stew-pan (without water) and boil gently 
twenty minutes, stirring often to prevent burning. 
Season with butter, pepper and salt. Serve hot. 

14._0NI0NS. 

Peel under cold water. Put in a saucepan, measure 
and put in enough boiling water to cover. Add a tea- 
spoonful of salt to every pint of water and simmer until 
tender, from one to three hours, according to size. Drain 
off the water, put them in a hot vegetable dish, cover 
with cream sauce, or add butter, pepper and salt to taste. 

15— CABBAGE. 

Take off the outside leaves, cut in quarters and remove 
the core, leaving enough to hold the leaves together. 
Soak until crisp in cold water. Drain and place in a 
kettle, measure and put in enough water to cover. Add 
a teaspoonful of salt to every pint of water. Simmer 
tliirty to sixty minutes according to size. Drain audv

place carefully in a hot vegetable dish. Season with 
butter, pepper and salt. 

16.— CARROTS. 

Wash, scrape and cut the carrots into suitable pieces, 

place them in a pot and boil gently until tender. Drain 

and place in a hot dish ; season with butter, pepper and 

salt. 

17.— GREEN PEAS. 

Wash and shell the peas, rejecting all wormy ones. 
Cover with cold water and let stand fifteen minutes if at 
all wilted. Skim off those which rise to the top and 
drain the rest. Measure and put in enough boiling 
water to barely cover, add one teaspoonful of salt to 
each pint of water; boil gently until tender. Drain. 
Season with butter, pepper and salt and serve in a hot 
dish. 

18.— SPINACH. 

Pick over the leaves, rejecting all bad ones, drop into 
cold water, shake them out of the water by handfuls, 
and drop them into another pan of cold water; shake 
them out of this water and place in a kettle. Cover 
closely and cook in their own juice until tender (about 
twenty minutes). Stir occasionally to prevent burning. 
Drain thoroughly, add pepper, salt and butter and pack 
solidly into a hot vegetable dish. It may be garnished 
with slices of hard-boiled eggs. 

19.— BOILED POTATOES. 

Select potatoes of uniform size. Wash, pare and drop 
at once into cold water to prevent discoloring. (Towards 
spring potatoes will need to be soaked at least two 



84 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

hours.) Cover with boiling water and boil gently until 
they can be easily pierced with a knife point or fork. 
Drain, at once, dredge with salt, and shake over the fire 
for a moment to dry. Stand in a warm place, uncovered, 
for a minute or two. Serve in a hot vegetable dish 
covered with a napkin. 

20.— BAKED POTATOES. 

Select medium-sized potatoes, as uniform in size as 
possible. Wash and scrub with a vegetable brush. 
Place in a dripping pan, or on a rack, and bake in a hot 
oven for forty minutes, or until soft. When cooked 
break the skins so as to allow the steam to escape, else 
they will become soggy. This is the most digestible 
way of cooking potatoes. 

21.— MASHED POTATOES. 

Boil potatoes — without skins — and mash in the kettle 
in which they are boiled. When free from lumps add 
to each cup of mashed potato 

1 tap. butter. I J tap. salt. 

2 tbsps. hot milk. | A spk. white popper. 

Beat all together until light and creamy. Re-heat and 
pile lightly without smoothing in a hot dish. 

22.— POTATOES BAKED WITH MEAT. 

Pare and par-boil potjitoes ten minutes. Drain and 
place around the roast in the pan. Bake until tcmdcr, 
basting and turning occasionally. Ordinary potatoes 
require about forty minutes. 



VEGETABLES. 35 

23.— SAUTED POTATOES. 

Cut cold-boiled potatoes in one-fourth-inch slices, 
sprinkle with pepper and salt, put in a hot, well-greased 
frying-pan, brown on one side, turn and brown the 
other, and serve at once. 

24.— BOILED BEANS (White or Lima). 

1 cup beans. I 1 tbsp. butter. 

^ cup milk. I 1 tsp. salt. 

Pick over one cupful of beans, soak in a quart o*f cold 
water over night. Drain off the water, add one quart 
of cold water and quarter teaspoonful of baking soda. 
Bring to boiling and let simmer for two hours. Drain, 
add the butter, salt and milk and stand on the back of 
the stove ten minutes. 

25.— SUCCOTASH OF DRIED BEANS AND 
CANNED CORN.* 



1 cup dried beans. 
^ can corn. 
1 cup milk. 



1^ tsps. salt. 
2 tbsps. butter. 



Cook the beans as in above recipe, drain and add the 
seasoning, milk and corn. Cook for three minutes after 
they begin to boil. 

* This is better made with Lima beans. 



36 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

BREAKFAST CEREALS. 

Cereals take the first place among vegetable foods, 
owing to their cheapness and great nutritive value. 
They contain 65-70% starch, 10-12% water, 10-12% 
proteids, |-8% fat, and 2% mineral matter. The chief 
cereals are wheat, oats, barley, rice, corn and rye, and 
from them are produced the various flours, meals, break- 
fast cereals and patent breakfast foods. 

The nutritive value of breakfast cereals depends very 
much » upon the manner of cooking. 

General Rules for Cooking Breakfast Cereals. 

1. Cook in boiling salted water — one quarter teaspoon- 
ful to every cupful of water. 

2. Quantity of dry cereal to one cupful of water. 

(a) One quarter cup of oatmeal, rice, or cracked wheat. 

(6) One half cup of rolled oats, or any flaked cereal. 

(c) Three tablespoonfuls cornmeal, farina or any granular cereal. 

3. Methods of cooking breakfast cereals. 

(a) Whole or Cracked Grains. — Put the salt and 
water in the top part of a double-boiler. 
Place it directly over the fire. When it 
boils add the cereal and stir it frequently 
until it has boiled ten minutes. Cover 
closely and set the top in the lower part 
of the double-boiler. Cook from three to 
twelve hours. 
NoTB. — Rice will cook in throo-quartera of an hour. 



BREAKFAST CEREALS. * 37 

(6) Flaked Cereals. — Put the salt and water in a 
pot. When it boils add the cereal. Stir 
constantly until it thickens, then boil 
gently half an hour, stirring often to pre- 
vent burning. 

Note. — These are much nicer cooked like whole grains. 

(c) Granular Cereals. — Put the salt and water in 
the top part of a double-boiler, and place 
directly over the fire. When it boils hard, 
sprinkle in the cereal, stirring quickly all 
the time. Stir and boil until it thickens. 
Cover closely and sQt the top in the lower 
part of the double-boiler. Cook from one 
to four hours. 

4. Breakfast cereals may be cooked the day before 
they are to be used, but should be left in the pot and 
should not be stirred while re-heating. A tablespoonful 
or two of water poured over the top after it is cooked 
will prevent a skin forming over the top.

The Cooking of Eggs— Milk— Cheese. 
EGGS. 

Eggs are one of the most valuable tissue-building 
foods, and either raw or properly cooked are easily 
digested. 

26.— EGGS COOKED IN THE SHELL. 

Allow one cup of boiling water for each egg to be 
cooked, and one extra for the pot. Put the water in 
the pot and bring to boiling point. Put in the eggs, 
cover closely and stand on a part of the stove which 
may be touched by the hand. 

In 10 minutes the egg will be cooked soft.

27.— POACHED EGGS. 

Measure water into a frying-pan until it is one and 
one half inches deep. Add half a teaspoonful of salt for 
each cupful. Bring to simmering point. Break each 
egg carefully into a saucer and slip it gently into the 
water. When the white is set lift the egg on a cake- 
turner and slide it on a hot plate, or on a piece of 
buttered toast that has been dipped in hot water and 
kept warm while the egg was poaching.

^ tbsp. milk. 

J tsp. salt. 



A speck of peppor. 
1 tsp. butter. 



Beat the eggs enough to mix the yolks and whites 
well. Stir in the salt, pepper and milk. 

Put the butter in an omelet or frying-pan, let it 
spread over the bottom of the pan, then turn in the egg 
mixture. Cook until creamy, stirring and lifting from 
the bottom of the pan. Serve on toast or surrounded 
by crisp bacon. 

29.— FRENCH OMELET. 

1 egg. I I tsp. butter. 

1 tbsp. boiling water. | Salt and pepper. 

Scour out the frying-pan with a teaspoon of salt and 
a bit of paper. Put the serving dish to warm, and put 
a flat-bladed knife and salt and pepper shakers near the 
stove. Beat the egg in a bowl with a fork, just enough 
to mix the yolk and white. Stir in the hot water. 
Melt the butter in the frying-pan and let it spread over 
the bottom and sides. Pour in the egg and cook it over 
gentle heat; when it begins to set raise it around the 
edges with the knife and let the liquid part run under. 
When no more will run under dredge the top with salt 
and pepper, loosen from the pan, fold it and turn on to 
the serving dish. 

If cooked at the proper temperature this omelet will 
be of a jelly-like consistency. 



40 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

MILK. 

Milk is a food rather than a beverage. It contains all 
the food substances. But as such a large percentage of 
milk is water (87 to 88 per cent.) it would have to be 
taken in enormous quantities to supply the necessary 
nutrition for a healthy adult. Therefore, while a com- 
plete food for infants, it requires the assistance of other 
foods, especially of carbo-hydrates, in supplying sufficient 
nourishment for a healthy person. 

Skim milk is important as a cheap source of 
albuminoids. 

Cream is the top layer of milk which has stood for 
some time. It contains most of the fat of the milk. 
Cream is very easily digested and is useful where 
fat is especially required in the system. It must, 
however, be considered a luxury in the ordinary 
diet. 

Butter is made by churning cream until all the little 
fat globules have run together and separated from the 
milk. What is left is called buttermilk and contains 
most of the water, sugar, casein an^ mineral matter. 
Butter is an easily-digested fat and one of the most 
valuable foods. Cooked butter is less digestible; it 
burns more readily than other fats. 

If there is any doubt as to the purity of milk, or 
if it has been exposed in any place where it would be 
likely to become contaminated (milk absorbs odors and 
impurities very quickly) — and as milk is more liable 
than almost any other food to contain disease germs — 
it is always safe to sterilize it, that is, heat it to the 
boiling ix>int (212'F.). 



MILK. 41 

30.— STERILIZED MILK 

Fill small-necked bottles to within one and one half 
inches of the top with milk, and cork with absorbent 
cotton. Stand in a steamer of cold water, having water 
three fourths of the height of the bottle. Heat the 
water gradually until it reaches boiling point, then move 
back on the stove and let stand for ten minutes, just 
below boiling point. If the milk is to be preserved for 
some time it should be kept at boiling point from five to 
t6n minutes. Put in a cool place and keep tightly 
corked until used. 

31.— PASTEURIZED MILK. 

While sterilization is the most efficient way of dealing 
with milk germs, it has its drawbacks. It alters the 
taste of the milk and renders the casein less easy of 
digestion. Therefore pasteurization is often substituted 
in the treatment of milk. This consists in keeping the 
milk at a temperature of 158°F. for twenty minutes or 
half an hour. While this method may kill most of the 
germs usually found in milk it does not destroy the 
tubercle bacillus or some bacteria which will cause 
diarrhea. In pasteurizing milk use the same method as 
in sterilizing, only changing the temperature. 

32.— JUNKET. 

1 cup milk. I J junket tablet. 

1 tbsp. sugar. | 1 tap. cold water. 

A little flavoring. 

Put the tablet to soak in the cold water. Put the 
sugar and milk in a pan and stir over the fire until it 
reaches blood heat. Be careful that it gets no hotter, or 



42 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

it will not coaorulate. When it reaches blood heat, take 
off the fire at once, and add the flavoring. Crush and 
dissolve the tablet in the water, then stir it into the 
milk, and at once pour it into the serving dish. Let it 
stand in a warm room until it sets, then move it carefully 
to a cold place to chill before serving. If it is jarred 
while coagulating, or after, the curds and whey will 
separate. 

33.— CORN-STARCH MOLD. 

1 cup milk. I 2 tbsps. corn-starch. 

2 tbsps. sugar. | A pinch of salt. 

A little flavoring. 

Mix one tablespoonful of milk with the corn-starch 
while the rest of the milk is heating in the double-boiler. 
When the milk is hot stir in the corn-starch and stir 
until it thickens and cook a few minutes. Stir in the 
salt and sugar and turn it into a wet mold. Set away 
in a cold place. When cold turn it out and serve. 

34.— BAKED CUSTARD. 

1 egg. I I tbsp. sugar. 

§ cup milk. I Flavoring to taste. 

Beat the egg until well mixed. Add the other ingre- 
dients and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Turn the 
mixture into a pudding dish or custard cups. Stand 
the dish in a pan, pour boiling water around it and 
bake in a moderately hot oven until set in the centre. 

35.— CUSTARD SAUCE. 

1 egg. I 1 tbsp. sugar. 

jl cup milk. I Flavoring to taste. 

Put the milk to heat in a double-boiler. Beat the egg 

and sugar until well mixed. Stir the hot milk into the 



CHEESE. 43 

egg and sugar. Turn the mixture back into the double- 
boiler and stir constantly until it thickens and forms a 
coating on the spoon. Take off the fire immediately 
and at once turn the sauce into a cold bowl. Stir in the 
flavoring and set aside to cool. 



CHEESE. 

Cheese when made from whole milk consists chiefly 
of the casein and fat, and contains comparatively little 
water. It is exceedingly nutritious, and is one of 
the most valuable of foods. One pound of cheese is 
equal in proteid to two pounds of beef, and serves as an 
excellent substitute for those engaged in active labor. 
It is somewhat difficult of digestion, as the fat forms 
a coating for the proteids which makes it difficult 
for the digestive juices to penetrate. It should be 
well masticated before entering the stomach, and for this 
reason the more solid varieties of cheese are more apt to 
be pulverized in eating than the softer makes. The most 
wholesome form of serving cheese is in combination with 
other foods. By adding as much bicarbonate of potash 
as will lie on a ten-cent piece, to a quarter pound of 
grated cheese, and combining with milk and eggs, 
macaroni, etc., most nutritious and savory dishes may 
be prepared at a small cost. 

36.— CHEESE CRACKERS. 

1 cracker. I 1 tbsp. grated cheese. 

J tsp. butter. | ^ tsp. salt. 

A few grains cayenne pepper. 

Spread the butter on the cracker, mix the remaining 

ingredients in a small bowl and cover the cracker with 



44 DOMESTIC SCIENCK 

it. Place on a pan and heat in a hot oven until the cheese 
is melted. Serve hot or cold. 

Note. — The above cheese mixture may be used as a sandwich filling. 

37.— MACARONI AND CHEESE. 

I cup. macaroni. I J cup. dried bread crumbs. 

J cup. grated cheese. | ^ tsp. butter. 

1 cup cream sauce. (See page 94. ) 

Put three cupfuls of water and three-quarters of a 
teaspoonful of salt on to boil. Break the macaroni into 
inch pieces. When the water boils hard drop in the 
macaroni and keep it boiling hard until the macaroni 
is tender — about thirty or forty minutes. Put butter 
and crumbs into a saucepan and stir until the butter 
is mixed through. Grate the cheese. Make the white 
sauce. 

When the macaroni is tender drain in a colander, and 
rinse with cold water. Mix the cheese with the sauce, 
stir in the macaroni and pour it into a baking dish. 
Cover with the crumbs and bake fifteen or twenty 
minutes to brown the crumbs. 
Note. — This may be prepared some time before it is to be baked. 



CHAPTER VII. 

The Cooking of Meat— Poultry— Fish. 

MEAT. 

Meat is composed of the several nitrogenous com- 
pounds — more or less fat, water and mineral matter. 
It is one of the most important sources of higher 
proteid. Its substance, when changed to gelatin 
albuminoid has considerable nutritive value. The 
digestibility of meat depends upon the variety, the 
feeding and the age of the animal, and often upon 
the way in which it is cooked. 

Beef is the most largely consumed variety of meat 
and is probably the most nutritious. 

Tongue is a tender form of meat when properly 
cooked, but contains too much fat to agree well with 
people of delicate digestion. 

Veal, when obtained from animals killed too young, 
is apt to be tough, pale and indigestible, but good veal 
is considered fairly nutritious. It contains more gelatin 
than beef, and in broth is considered valuable especially 
for the sick. 

Mutton is considered to be more digestible than beef, 
that is, well-fed mutton, from sheep at least three years 
old, but, as it is more difficult to obtain tender mutton 
than beef, the latter is more generally preferred. Mut- 
ton broth is wholesome and valuable in sickness. 

45 



46 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

Lamb, when tender and of the right age, is quite as 
digestible as beef or mutton, but the flesh contains too 
large a proportion of fat. 

Venison is a tender meat with short fibres, which 
is very digestible when obtained from young deer. 
Its chemical composition is similar to lean beef. 

Pork is tender-fibred meat, but is very indigestible 
owing to the high percentage of fat, which is con- 
siderably more than the nitrogenous material it 
contains. Pork ribs may have as much as forty-two 
per cent, of fat. 

Ham is more digestible when well cooked and eaten 
cold. Bacon is more easily digested than either ham or 
pork; when cut thin and cooked quickly — until trans- 
parent and crisp — it can often be eaten by dyspeptics, 
and forms an excellent food for consumptives. 

Sweetbread, which is the thymus gland of the calf, 
is a delicate and agreeable article of diet, particularly for 
invalids. Tripe, heart, liver and kidneys are other forms 
of animal viscera used as food, valuable chiefly as afford- 
ing variety. 

GENERAL RULES FOR COOKING MEAT. 

1. Baking, 

Put the roast in a very hot oven with pieces of the fat 
or some good beef dripping in the roasting pan. Baste 
every ten minutes. Keep the oven very hot for a small 
roast. For a largo roast lower the heat after the first 
fift<;on miinitcH. Allow fifteen minutes for each pound 
of the roiiHt if it is thick and compact; long, narrow 
roasts will take a little less time. 



MEAT. 47 

2. Broiling. 

{a) Over the Coals. — Put the trimmed meat between 
the hot greased wires of a broiler. Place over 
a very hot, clear fire, holding close to the heat. 
Turn the broiler every ten seconds. Beef one 
inch thick cooks rare in eight minutes. 

(6) Pan-broiling. — Heat a frying-pan smoking hot. 
Lay the meat in flat and turn immediately. 
Keep turning every ten seconds, but take 
care not to stick the fork into the lean part. 
Beef one inch thick cooks rare in ten 
minutes. 

3. Boiling. 

Cover the meat with boiling water. Boil five minutes, 
then simmer until done. Tender meat takes twenty 
minutes to the pound ; tough meat takes from three to 
five hours, no matter what the size. 

4. Stewing. 

Cut the meat in suitable pieces. Cover with cold 
water. Bring slowly to simmering point, and simmer 
until tender, usually three or four hours. Keep the pot 
covered closely. 

5. Choice of Meat. 

{a) For baking and broiling use tender meat only. 

(b) For boiling use either tender or tough meat. 

(c) For stewing tough meat is most commonly 

chosen. 



48 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

38.— BROILED STEAK. 

Tender steak, cut one I Butter, 

inch thick. | Salt and pepper. 

Have a clear, glowing, hot fire. If necessary trim the 
steak and put it together as compactly as possible. Put 
the platter to warm, and place the butter, salt and pepper 
at hand. Grease the wires of the broiler with a bit of 
fat, and lay the meat between the wires. Hold one side 
near the coals and count ten slowly ; turn and count ten ; 
continue turning thus for one minute, then hold a little 
farther from the fire and turn less frequently until 
cooked. Just before taking from the fire dredge salt 
and pepper on both sides. Lift to the platter, spread on 
the butter and serve at once. The steak should cook 
rare in eight minutes, should look puffy and be red, but 
not purple inside. 

Note — The butter is not always used, but is a great improvement, as 
is also a garnish of parsley or watercress. 

39,— BEEF LOAF. 



1 lb, loan beef, chopped fine, 
1 tbsp. chopped parsley. 
1 ogg, yolk. 



1 tsp. salt, 

i tsp. pepper, 

2 tbsps. bacon dripping. 



Put everything but tlie egg and dripping in a bowl. 
Beat the egg enough to mix tlio yolk and white, pour it 
over the meat and mix the whole thoroughly. Wash 
the hands carefully, leave them wet, and form the meat 
into a compact roll about six inches long. 

Melt tlie dripping in a small baking pan, put in the 
meat roll and bake it in a hot oven thirty minutes. 
BaHte it every ten minutes. Take it up on a hot dish 
and keep it Iiot while making the gravy. 



MEAT. 49 

Add two tablespoons of flour to the fat in the pan and 
stir until smooth and frotliy. Add one cupful of warm 
water and stir over the fire until it thickens and boils. 
While stirring be careful to scrape up all the brown 
stuff, as it flavors the gravy. Season with a little pepper 
and more salt if necessary. Pour the gravy over the 
meat and serve hot. 

Note. — Strained tomatoes may be used instead of part of the water, 
and onion juice may replace the parsley. 

40.— HAMBURG STEAK. 

1 lb. of lean beef chopped fine. I J tsp. pepper. 

1 tsp. salt. I 1 tsp. onion juice. 

Mix all together in a bowl, wash the hands carefully, 
and shape the meat with wet hands into six flat round 
cakes three quarters of an inch thick. Care must be 
taken to have them as compact as possible. Saute about 
eight minutes, and remove to the hot serving dish. 

Make a gravy as for beef loaf. 

41.— ROAST BEEF.

42.— BROWN STEW. 



1 lb. beef. 

1 cup cold water. 

2 tbsps. flour. 
I tsp. salt. 



1 very small onion. 
J cup carrots (cubed). 
J cup turnips (cubed). 
4 tsp. pepper. 



Cut the fat off the meat and put it in a stew-pan to 

[fry out. Cut meat into pieces about two inches square 

and roll it in the flour. Put it in the hot fat and stir 

over the fire until nicely browned ; add the water, 

cover closely and simmer. Prepare the vegetables ; cube

carrots and turnips and cut the onion into thin slices. 
Add the vegetables, salt and pepper to the stew and 
simmer two and one half hours. 

Serve on a hot platter. 

43.— DUMPLINGS (for the Stew). 

1 cup flour. 2 tsp. baking-powder. 

J tsp. salt. J cup milk (about). 

Put all the dry ingredients into a sifter and sift into 

a bowl. When stew is cooked quickly stir the milk into 

the flour, using enough milk to make a very soft dough. 

Drop by spoonfuls into the hot stew, cover at once, and 

boil gently for fifteen minutes. 

Note. — The pot must not be uncovered while the dumplings are being 
cooked. 

44— BRAISED BEEF. 



3 lbs. lean beef. 

2 slices fat salt pork. 

i tsp. peppercorns. 



4 cup each, cut in dice, 
carrot, turnip, onion, 
celery. Pepper and salt. 



Try out the pork and remove scraps. Wipe the meat, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, dredge with flour and 
brown the entire surface in the hot pork fat. When 
turning the meat do not pierce witli a fork wliich will 
allow the juice to escape. Place on a rack and surround 
with the vegetables and three cups of boiling water. 
The meat may bo phiccd on a bed of vegetables if there 
is no rack. Cover closely and bako four hours in a 
moderate oven, basting every half liour. Turn the meat 
after two hours. This nu'thod of cooking moat is most 
desirable when the fire is not in use for other cooking, 
and when other household duties demand absence from 
the kitclien.

of it off. Cut it into pieces about three inches square, or 
into suitable-sized pieces for serving without cutting. 
Put them into a stew-pan with the water and the onion 
peeled and cut in slices. Simmer two and one half hours, 
then add the potatoes cut into inch cubes, then add salt 
and pepper. Simmer until the potatoes are cooked, 
about thirty minutes. Serve on a hot platter. 

Note. — Other vegetables may be used in place of the potatoes and 
onion, in which case the gravy must be thickened with flour. 



46.— JELLIED VEAL. 



1 knuckle veal. 

1 blade mace. 

12 whole cloves. 

J cup vinegar. 



1 onion. 

1 bay-leaf. 

6 peppercorns. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 



Wipe the knuckle and cut it into pieces. Put into 
a kettle with two quarts of cold water, bring slowly 
to simmering point, skim and simmer gently for two 
hours, then add the onion, mace, bay-leaf, cloves, pepper- 
corns, and simmer one hour longer. Take out the 
knuckle, carefully remove the bones and put the meat 
into a mold or square pan. Boil the liquor until 
reduced to one quart, add the vinegar, pepper and salt 
to taste, strain and pour over the meat. Stand away 
until cold, when it may be turned out and garnished 
with parsley and lemon.

47.— BACON. 

Cut bacon in thin slices and remove the rind. Pan- 
broil until the fat is clear (no longer). Put on a hot 
plate and serve at Once. 

A better way to cook bacon is to place thin slices of 
bacon (from which the rind has been removed) closely 
together in a fine wire broiler, place broiler over 
dripping pan and bake in a hot oven until crisp, turning 
once. Use the fat which has dripped into the pan for 
frying liver, potatoes, etc. 

48.— LIVER AND BACON. 

Prepare the bacon as directed above. Cut the liver 
into slices one half inch thick, cover with boiling water, 
and let stand for five minutes to draw out the blood. 
Drain, wipe, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dredge with 
flour and fry in the fat from the bacon. Care must 
be taken that the fat is not too hot. Serve with or 
without brown gravy. 

POULTRY. 

Chicken is one of the most digestible of meats, 
and is particularly valuable as fopd for invalids. 
Turkey is somewhat less digestible than chicken. 
Ducks and geese are difl^cult of digestion, unless quite 
young, on account of the fat they contain. 

The bt!st chickens have soft, yellow foot, short, thick 
legs, smooth, moist skin and phnnp breast; the cartilage 
on the end of the brejist Ix^ne is soft and pliable. Pin 
feathers always indicate a young bird and long luiirs an 



POULTRY. 63 

older one. All poultry should be dressed as soon as 
killed. Cut off the head, and if the fowl is to be roasted, 
slip the skin back from the neck and cut the neck oiF 
close to the body, leaving skin enough to fold over on the 
back. Remove the windpipe, pull the crop away from 
the skin on the neck and breast, and cut off close to the 
opening in the body. Cut through the skin about two 
inches below the leg joint, bend the leg at the cut by 
pressing it on the edge of the table and break off the 
bone. Then pull out the tendon. If care be taken to 
cut only through the skin, these cords may be pulled out 
easily, one at a time, with the fingers; or by putting 
the foot of the fowl against the casing of a door, then 
shut the door tightly and pull on the leg. The drum- 
stick of a roast chicken or turkey is greatly improved 
by removing the tendons. Cut out the oil bag in the 
tail, make an incision near the vent, insert two fingers, 
keeping the fingers up close to the breast-bone until you 
can reach in beyond the liver and heart, and loosen on 
eitlier side down toward the back. Draw everything 
out carefully. See that the kidneys and lungs are not 
left in, and be very careful not to break any of the 
intestines. When the fowl has been cleaned carefully it 
will not require much washing. Rinse out the inside 
quickly and wipe dry. In stuffing and trussing a fowl, 
place the fowl in a bowl and put the stuffing in at the 
neck, fill out the breast until plump. Then draw the 
neck skin together at the ends and sew it over on the 
back. Put the remainder of the stuffing into the body 
at the other opening and sew with coarse thread or fine 
twine. Draw the thighs up close to the body and tie 
the legs over the tail firmly with twine. Put a long 



54 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

skewer through the thigh into the body and out through 
the opposite thigh, turn the tips of the wings under the 
back of the fowl, put a long skewer through from one 
wing to the other. Wind a string from the tail to the 
skewer in the thigh, then up to the one in the wing 
across the back to the other wing, then down to the 
opposite side and tie firmly round the tail. If you have 
no skewers, the fowl may be kept in shape by tying 
carefully with twine. Clean all the giblets, cut away all 
that looks green near the gall bladder, open the gizzard 
and remove the inner lining without breaking. Put the 
gizzard, heart, liver, and the piece of neck which has 
been cut off, into cold water, wash carefully, put in a 
saucepan, cover with cold water, place on the back of 
the stove and simmer till tender. Use the liquid for 
making the gravy ; the meat may be chopped and used 
for giblet soup. 

49.— ROAST CHICKEN (or Turkey). 

Singe carefully, remove the pin feathers, draw as 
directed above. Wipe, stuff, sew and tie or skewer into 
shape, dredge with flour, cover with plenty of dripping; 
roast in a hot oven. When the flour is brown check the 
heat, baste frequently with the fat, and when nearly 
cooked dredge with pepper and salt knd again with flour. 
Bako a four-pound chicken one and one lialf hours, or 
until the joints separate easily. If browning too fast, 
cover with paper. (Roast chicken is considered to be 
more wholesome and to liavo a better flavor when cooked 
without stuffing.) 



FISH. 55 

50.— STEWED CHICKEN. 

The first attempt of an inexperienced cook in the 
preparation of a chicken should be a stew, as it will 
provide an opportunity for her to study the anatomy of 
a chicken while cutting it in pieces, and also show her 
the position of the intestines, so that when she attempts 
to draw a fowl she will know just where to place her 
hand so as to remove them without breaking. 

To prepare a chicken for a fricassee, clean and singe. 
Cut the chicken at the joints in pieces for serving. 
Place in a kettle, cover with boiling water, add two level 
teaspoons of salt, a speck of pepper (some like a small 
piece of salt pork). Simmer until tender, reducing the 
water to a pint or less, lift the chicken, melt one table- 
spoon of butter in a saucepan, add two tablespoons of 
flour, and when well mixed pour on slowly the chicken 
liquor. Add more salt if needed, pepper, one half tea- 
spoon of celery salt, one teaspoon of lemon juice (an egg 
may be vised by beating and pouring the sauce slowly on 
the egg, stirring well before adding it to the chicken). 
Pour this gravy over the chicken and serve ; dumplings 
may be added if desired, or it may be placed in a deep 
dish, covered with pastry and baked for chicken pie. 



FISH. 



Fish is an invaluable article of food. It provides 
variety in diet, and, while less stimulating than meat, is 
usually more easily digested. Fish should be perfectly 
fresh and thoroughly cooked. The most wholesome as 
well as the most palatable methods for cooking fish are 
broiling and baking. The flesh of fresh fish is firm and 



66 ~ DOMESTIC SCIENCK 

will not retain the impress of the finger if pressed into it. 
The eyes should be bright and glassy, the gills red and 
full of blood. Fish should be cleaned as soon as possible 
and thoroughly wiped with a cloth wet in salt water, and 
should be kept in a cool place. Do not put it near other 
food such as milk, butter, etc., as they will absorb the 
odor. 

Directions for Cleaning Fish. 

To scale Fish. — Lay fish on side, scrape with a sharp 
knife from tail towards head. Rinse the knife frequently 
in cold water to remove scales. 

To clean Fish. — Rest it on the back, make an incision 
from anus to a point between gills. This exposes the 
whole body cavity, containing the internal organs. 
Remove these, taking care not to break gall-sac. The 
kidneys must be scraped away, wash quickly, not 
allowing the fish to soak, wipe dry. 

61.— BROILED FISH. 

Rub a doable-broiler well with a piece of suet before 
putting in the fish. Lay the fish flat so that the flesh 
side will be exposed on one side of the broiler and the 
skin on the other. Broil carefully, as the skin side 
burns very quickly. A fish weigliing three pounds will 
take about twenty-five or thirty minutes to broil. When 
co6ked sprinkle with salt arid pepper, and serve very hot. 

62.— BAKED FISH. 



1 onp of cracker or bread crutnbs. 

1 Mp. lalt. 

1 Up. chopped onion. 



1 tsp. chopped parsley. 

1 BHp. popper. 

I cup melted butter or dripping. 



Clean, wipe and dry the fish, rub with salt; fill with 
stuffing and sew or tie curofully. Rub all over with

57 



butter (or dripping), salt and pepper, dredge with flour, 
put it into a hot oven, baste when the flour is brown, 
and often afterwards. Remove carefully from the pan 
and place upon a hot platter. 

53.— SCALLOPED FISH. 

Pick over carefully any remnants of cold, boiled or 
baked fish, put it into a sliallow dish in alternate layers 
with bread crumbs and cream sauce. Cover with crumbs 
and bake till brown. 



I 



54.— BOILED FISH. 

Salmon, halibut, cod or haddock are suitable for boil- 
ing. Place the fish, after cleaning and scraping, on a 
fish rack, coil in a frying basket, or on a plate tied up in 
cheese-cloth, and cover with boiling water, to which has 
been added salt and lemon juice or vinegar. The acid 
keeps the flesh white, and the salt improves the flavor. 
Boil from twenty to forty minutes (the coarser-grained 
fish require more time than the finer-grained). Serve 
with parsley or egg sauce. 



55.— PARSLEY SAUCE. 



1 cup water. 
1 tbsp. flour. 
1 tbsp. butter. 



1 tbsp. parsley. 
I tsp. salt. 



1 cup water. 
1 tbsp. flour.

Open can and turn salmon into a dish at once. Pour 
off all the oil into a clean bowl ; remove the bones and 
skin from the fish and flake it. Put a layer of crumbs 
in the bottom of a buttered baking-dish; then add a 
layer of salmon, sprinkle with pepper and salt and cover 
with bread crumbs, then add another layer of salmon 
and repeat till the salmon is all used. Pour milk over 
the salmon, cover the top with crumbs and dot with the 
butter. 



Bake for twenty minutes in a moderate oven, 
hot, with or without sauce.

CHAPTER VIII. 

The Combination of Food Materials. 

SOUPS. 

Soups may be divided into two classes, soup made 
with stock, and with milk. As soup should form part 
of the regular daily diet, and may be made from the 
cheaper materials, it is absolutely necessary that every 
housekeeper should understand the art of making it 
properly. 

Meat Stock from Left-Overs. 

In the first place it is well to know what may be used 
in the process -of soup-making. The first and most 
important step is to prepare the stock. For this 
purpose have a large earthen bowl or crock. Into this 
put all the bones, trimmings, bits of steak or chop and 
gravy which has been left over. Keep in a cold place. 
When needed, cover with cold water or water in which 
vegetables have been cooked, and simmer four or five 
hours; strain and set away to cool. One eighth bay- 
leaf and six peppercorns may be added to each quart of 
liquid for flavoring. When cold, remove the fat which 
will have formed a solid coating on the top. The stock 
is now ready for use. By saving the remains of vege- 
tables cooked for the table, the outer stocks of celery, 
a hard-boiled egg, etc., a very palatable and nutritious 
soup may be made at a trifling cost. In families where 
large quantities of meat are used, there should be 
sufficient material without buying meat for soup. It is 

59 



60 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

not necessary to have all the ingredients mentioned in 
some recipes in order to secure satisfactory results. It 
will, however, be necessary to understand soup flavorings, 
so as to know which ones may be left out. 

Meat Stock from Fresh Meat. 

Stock made from the shin of beef, or from the cheaper 
pieces which contain the coarser fibre and gristle, require 
long, slow cooking. Wipe carefully with a damp cloth 
before cutting or preparing for use. For soup break or 
saw the bones into small pieces, and for each pound of 
meat and bone allow one quart of cold water. Add 
flavoring as above. Cover the kettle closely and let it 
heat slowly until it reaches the simmering point, when 
it should be moved back and kept at that degree for 
several hours. Soup should never be allowed to boil 
hard. The scum which rises to the surfate is the 
albumen and juices of the meat, and should not be 
skimmed off". If the kettle is clean, and all impurities 
removed from the meat, there will not be anything 
objectionable in the scum. Stock must always be 
allowed to remain until cold, so that the fat may be 
removed before using. A strong, greasy soup is rarely 
relished, and is one of the principal reasons why so 
many people dislike this valuable article of diet. Do 
not add salt to tlie meat which is being prepared for 
stock until a few minutes before removing from the fire. 
Salt hardens the water if added at first and makes the 
tissues more difficult to dissolve. Stock may be kept 
for Hcvcral days by occasionally bringing it to the 
boiling point. This is not necessary in winter if it is 
kept in a cold place. 



SOUPS. 61 



58._VEGETABLE SOUP. 



1 lb. beef.

Cut the meat into half-inch cubes, put it in a stew-pan 
with the cold water and bring to a boil. Mix the flour 
with half a cup of cold water and stir into the boiling 
stock. Add the rice and simmer one hour, add the onion, 
celery and carrot, cook for one hour longer, then add the 
turnips, potatoes, salt and pepper, and simmer for half 
an hour longer. Serve hot. 

Note. — Two quarts of stock from left-overs may be substituted for 
meat and water. 

If liked, half a cup of finely-shredded cabbage may be added with the 
carrots and onions. 

59.— MACARONI SOUP. 

1| pts. clear soup stock. I 1 tsp. salt. 

4 sticks macaroni. | 

Break the macaroni into small pieces and throw it into 
one quart of boiling, salted water. Boil for twenty-five 
minutes with the cover off the stew-pan. Drain off the 
water and add the macaroni to the stock which has been 
heated. Cover and simmer for fifteen minutes. Season 
to taste with salt and pepper. 

60.— CREAM OF VEGETABLE SOUP. 



1 cup cooked vegetable (non- 

starchy). 

2 cups vegetable water. 



Salt and pepper to taste 



2 cups milk. 

4 tbsps. flour. 

2 tbsps. butter (or sweet dripping). 



62 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

Press the vegetable through a sieve, or chop it finely ; 
put the vegetable water on to boil. Mix the flour 
smoothly with an equal measure of milk and thin it 
with a little more of the milk. Stir with the boiling 
liquid, and stir constantly until it thickens and boils two 
minutes. Stir in the butter or dripping, vegetable pulp 
and remaining milk, and bring to simmering point. 
Season to taste and serve hot. 

61._P0TAT0 SOUP. 



4 small potatoes. 

2 slices of small onion. 

2 or 3 sprigs parsley.

1 oz, ham or ham bone. 
^ lb. cold meat. 
1 tbsp. flour. 
J tsp. pepper. 
1 tsp. salt. 



Soak the peas over night in a quart of cold water. In 
the morning pour off the water and put the peas, the 
meat and bone and two quarts of fresh cold water in a 
kettle and place on the fire. Cook slowly for two hours. 
Put the drippings and vegetables in a small saucepan 
and cook slowly for half an hour, press the vegetables 
against the side of the saucepan so as to squeeze out the 
fat, then add them to the soup. Into the remaining fat 
put the flour and stir until smooth, then stir this into 
the soup. Add the salt, pepper and bay-leaf, cover and 
cook slowly for two hours. Strain through a coarse 
wire strainer e-heat and serve with croutons. 

Stock may be used instead of water when the meat is 
_ omitted. 

Note. — Bean soup may be made in the same way. 



CHAPTER IX. 

Flour-Mixtures. 

Most of the flour used in this country is made from 
wheat, and is one of our most valuable food materials 
owing to its cheapness, and to its richness in carbo- 
hydrates and proteids. There are many kinds and 
grades on the market which are classified by the 
housekeeper as : — 

White Flour. — That made from the central part of the grain. 

(1) Strong white flour. — Most suitable for bread, biscuits, etc. 

(2) Weak white flour. — Most suitable for pastry, cake, etc. 

Whole Wheat Flour. — Supposed to contain the whole of the 

grain, except the outer lay of bran. 

I 
Graham Flour. — Is nowadays usually a mixture of white 

flour, bran and middlings. 

The nutritive value and digestibility of flour-mixtures 
depend not only upon the quality of the flour, but also 
upon the skill with which it is combined with other food 
materials, and the care with which they are cooked. 
The object aimed at is to produce an article that is light, 
that is, porous enough to be easily mixed with the saliva 
in the process of mastication. This is secured by the 
methods of mixing and the lightening agents used to 
make the mixture more or less pprous. 

The Flouu Mixtures are classified as: — 
1. Batters. 

(rt) Ponr batters, e.g., popovers, griddle cakes. 
(Ji) Dv()\) batters, <'.//., muffins, gingerbread and many 
CukcH. ; 

64 : 



flour-mixtures. 65 

2. Doughs. 

(a) Soft doughs, e.g., milk biscuits, dumplings. 

(6) Stiff doughs, e.g., pastry, bread. 
The Methods of Mixing. 

1. Stirrimj. — A circular or figure-eight motion, with the object 

of thoroughly mixing the material. 

2. Beating. — A cartwheel motion, with the object of entangling 

air in the mixture. 

3. Folding. — A light, delicate motion, rather triangular in shape, 

used when it is necessary to avoid breaking air-cells. 

4. Cutting. —Used for cutting shortening into flour for pastry 

or doughs. 

5. Kneading. — The motion required to make bread smooth and 

elastic. 

6. Rolling. — The even but light rolling pressure of a rolling-pin 

upon doughs. 

The Lightening Agents. 

1. Air. 

(o) Incorporated by beating the flour-mixture, e.g., pop- 
overs, etc. 

(6) Incorporated by adding beaten egg to the flour-mixture, 
e.g., sponge cake, etc. 

2. Steam. — Obtained in certain mixtures by exposing the mixture 

to .strong heat, when the water in it suddenly expands to 
steam, thus lightening the mixture. 

3. The Gas Carbon Dioxide /CO \ 

I 2;- 

(a) Generated in the flour-mixtures by the action of an alkali 
upon an acid in the presence of moisture. 

1. Soda and the acid of sour milk, e.g. , griddle cakes, etc. 

2. Soda and the acid of molasses, e.g., gingerbread, etc. 

3. Soda and the acid of cream of tartar, e.g., cakes, etc. 

4. Soda and acid of baking powders, e.g., cakes, etc. 



66 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

(6) Generated in the mixture by the action of yeast, e.g., 
bread. 

(c) Generated in the flour-mixture, and forced into it by 
machinery, e.g., aerated bread. 

Note. — Frequently two or more agents are used in the same mixture. 
3. Gluten. 

When wheat flour is made into a dough, kneaded thoroughly, and 
the starch taken out of it by washing in several waters, there remains 
a gray, tough elastic substance. It is this substance gluten which 
stretches like rubber that holds the gas in the flour-mixtures iintil 
the mass is light and porous. In the process of baking the gluten 
stiffens and the mass retains its porous, spongy shape. 

General Directions for Flour Mixtures. 

1. Preparation. 

(a) Attend to the fire. If the fuel is coal, see that 
the fire will not need fresh coal while the 
article is cooking. 

(6) Collect necessary utensils and ingredients. 

(c) As a rule, line pans and grease tins before begin- 

ning to mix. 

(d) Fruit should be cleaned, thoroughly dried, and 

well floured before being added to flour- 
mixtures. 

2. The Mixing. 

Use an earthem bowl and a wooden spoon for 
mixing. MojuMure dry ingredients, then butter, then 
licjuids. If butter is very hard cover with tepid water 
and wash it with the spoon until creamy, then pour off 
the water. 

When the yolks and wliit<!H an; beaten separately, boat 
the whites until stitt" but not dry and add to the mixture 



FLOUR-MIXTURES. 67 

after the flour. Never stir batters after the final beating, 
because tlie stirring takes out the air which has been 
drawn in by the beating. 

Cake pans should be filled nearly two-thirds full and 
the mixture spread evenly over the pan. 

3. Baking. 

As a general rule the depth of batter or thickness of 
dough determines the temperature of the oven. A thin 
cake requires a hot oven and a thick loaf a moderate oven. 

Cake should be looked at frequently while baking. 
By opening the oven door a short distance only and clos- 
ing quickly without jarring the oven, there' is no danger 
of causing the cake to fall. Cake should not be moved 
in the oven until it has risen to its full height, which 
should be when about half baked. 

P Test cake, muffins, etc., by pressing gently with the tip 
of the finger ; if baked no impression of the finger will 
remain. Light cake shrinks from the pan when baked, 
but pound cakes do not. 



64.— POPOVERS. 



1 cup flour. 
1 cup milk. 



1 large egg. 
^ tsp. salt. 



Grease six popover cups, place on a baking sheet or 
pan in the oven. Break the egg into a pitcher, add 
salt and beat until light with a Dover beater. Add the 
milk and beat until perfectly smooth. Pour the batter 
quickly into the hot cups and bake in a hot oven about 
thirty minutes. Look at them about ten minutes after 
placing in the oven, and if browning reduce the heat. 



68 



DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 



65.— GRIDDLE CAKES. 



2 cups flour. 

If cups sour milk. 

1 tsp. salt. 



1 tsp. soda. 

4 tsps. melted fat. 



Sift the flour, salt and soda together, add half the 
milk and beat until smooth, stir in the remainder of the 
milk, add the fat and beat the mixture well. Pour it by 
spoonfuls on a slightly-greased, smoking-hot griddle. 
When lightly browned on one side turn and cook on 
the otlier side ; serve very hot. 

Note. — 1 cup white flour and 1 cup cornraeal, or 1 cup white flour 
and 1 cup Graham flour may be used instead of 2 cups of white flour. 

Notes. 

1. When making griddle cakes, the batter must be beaten before 
pouring a fresh batch of cakes on to the griddle. 

2. If large bubbles rise at once to the top of the cakes, the 
griddle is too hot. 

3. If tlie top of the cake stiff^ens before the underside is brown, 
the griddle is not hot enough. 

4. Never turn a cake twice ; it will make it heavy. 

6. Use a piece of pork fat with the rind on it, or a piece of beef 
suet on a fork, to grease the griddle. 

6. If cakes should stick, scrape the griddle clean before greasing 
it again. 

66.— WHOLE WHEAT GEMS. 

8| onpl whole wheat flour. I ^ tsp. salt. 

2 oups ice water. I 

Grease iron gem pans, and put in the oven in time to 
be very hot when the batter is ready. Sift the flour into 
a dJHh, and put the salt and water into a large bowl. 
Stand the lx)wl in a nirmnt of air; take the flour in hand- 
fula, hold it high over the bowl and HprinkUi slowly into

into the hot gem pans, and bake in a very hot oven about 
thirty minutes. 

Note. — Success depends upon thorough beating, hot pans, and hot 



oven. 



67.— GRAHAM GEMS. 



2 eggs. 

3 tbsps. sugar. 

4 tbsps. shortening. 
^ tsp. salt. 



1 cup sour milk. 

i tsp. soda. 

About 2 cups Graham flour. 



Notes. 

1. i cup white flour and J cup Graham may be used instead of 
1 cup of Graham. 

2. Use whole wheat flour instead of Graham. 

3. Substitute ryemeal for Graham. 

4. Substitute cornmeal for Graham. 



68.— CORN BREAD. 



1 cup commeaL 
1 cup flour. 
J cup sugar. 
i tsp. salt. 



1 cup milk.

1 egg. 

4 tsps. baking powder. 



Put the cornmeal, flour, sugar and salt into a bowl and 
mix thoroughly ; stir in the milk and give the batter a 
good beating. Melt the fat in the baking tin and stir it 
into the batter. Grease the baking tin. Beat the egg 
very light and mix it with the batter ; add the baking 
powder and mix it in quickly. Pour into the baking tin 
and bake in a hot oven. If thin it will bake in about 
twenty minutes ; if deep, in about thirty minutes.

dough with cold water. Toss on floured board, pat into

Set in a cold place for an hour. 

Note. — Pastry, unless light and tender, should never be eaten ; even 
then it should be avoided by people with poor digestion. There are so 
many food preparations superior to pastry in .both nutritive value and 
cost of time and material, that it will be wise to give it a very 
secondary place in the training of a culinary artist. However, as it is 
still a popular fancy with many, we may as well make the best of it. 
Butter is more wholesome in pastry than lard, although the latter 
makes a light crust. In order to secure satisfactory results in pastry 
making — especially puff pastry — three things should be observed : 
(1) have all the materials cold; (2) use as little liquid as possible; 
(3) handle lightly and quickly. Pastry should be very cold when it is 
put into the oven. Have the oven very hob. 



CHAPTER X. 
Flour-Mixtures (continued). 

BREAD. 

The most valuable food product manufactured from 
flour is bread. As one of the most important articles of 
the daily diet it naturally follows that special attention 
should be given to the process of making and care. 

Bread is made from a mixture of flour, yeast, water 
and salt ; other ingredients are frequently used with 
them, but are not essential. They merely serve to vary 
the flavor and texture. 

FLOUR. 

The best bread flour is slightly granular, creamy in 
color, and will not retain the impression of the fingers 
when pressed in the hand, and can be kneaded into a 
firm, elastic dough. 

YEAST. 

Yeast consists of tiny plants which can only be 
seen under the microscope, and belongs to the fungus 
family. These plants have the power of changing 
dextrin* and sugar into alcohol and the gas carbon di- 
oxide (CO2) The process is one of fermentation, and 
the gas produced makes bread light and porous. 

The temperature at which fermentation takes place 
and when to check it are important features of bread- 
making. The temperature best suited for the growth of 

* It is not perhaps a closed question whether yeast can act directly upon starch. 

75 



76 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

yeast is between 70° and 90° F. Its activity is suspended 
at 32° F., and is killed at 212° F. 

Liquid, dry, or compressed yeast may be used for 
raising bread. The compressed yeast cakes, if obtainable, 
are the most satisfactory for beginners, as the strength 
of yeast cakes varies less than liquid or dry yeast. 

A fresh yeast cake has a nutty smell, breaks readily, 
and is creamy in color. If soft it should not be used. 

The amount of yeast used depends upon the time 
allowed for rising. For bread allowed to rise over night, 
use one- quarter yeast cake to one pint of liquid. Bread 
mixed and baked during the day, one yeast cake to one 
pint of liquid ; even more may be used, but it requires 
very careful watching. 

Process of Breadmaking. 

The flour, liquid yeast, salt, and other ingredients are 
mixed into a dough, which is kneaded until the whole 
mass is elastic and velvety. It is then covered and 
allowed to rise until it has doubled its bulk. This 
increase in bulk is caused by the gas produced in 
fermentation trying to escape from the glutinous mass 
of dough. The dough is kneaded a second time to break 
the gas bubbles into small portions so tliat there may be 
no large holes and the fermentation be equal tiiroughout. 
It is moulded into loaves which should half fill the 
bread pans, and allowed to rise again until double its 
bulk in the same temperature as for the first rising; 
if alltjwcd to rise too long the bread will be full of 
holes, and if not long enough it will bo sodden. 
The loaf is baked in order to kill the ferment, to render 



FLOUR-MIXTURES. 77 

the starch soluble, to expand the gas and drive off the 
alcohol, to stiffen the gluten and to form a crust which 
shall have a pleasant flavor. Much of the indigestibility 
of bread is owing to the imperfect baking. The scientific 
method of baking bread is to fix the air cells as quickly 
as possible at first. This can be done better by baking 
the bread in small loaves in separate pans, thereby 
securing a uniform heat and more crust, which is con- 
sidered to be the most easily digested part of the bread. 
Some cooks consider that long, slow baking produces a 
more desirable flavor and renders bread more digestible. 

The custom of baking several loaves together in one 
large pan is contrary to all scientific rules of bread- 
making. The oven should be hot enough to brown a 
spoonful of flour in five minutes, for bread. The dough 
should rise during the first fifteen minutes, then begin to 
brown; keep the heat steady for the next fifteen or 
twenty minutes, then decrease it. If the oven is too hot 
a hard crust will form and prevent the dough from 
rising, which will not only cause the bread to be heavy, 
but will prevent the gas from escaping. If, on the other 
ihand, the oven is not hot enough, the bread will go on ris- 
ing until it becomes sour. A loaf, the size already men- 
tioned, should take from fifty-five to sixty minutes to bake, 
and should give a hollow sound, if tapped, when removed 
from the oven. Better take too long than not long 
enough, as doughy bread is most objectionable and 
unwholesome. If the crust is beginning to burn, cover 
the loaf with brown paper, and reduce the heat, but have 
a brown crust, not a whity-brown, which is usually hard 
and without flavor. Upon removing the loaves from the 
pan, place them on a rack or across the top of the pan 



78 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

where the air may circulate freely. Never leave warm 
bread on a pine table, or where it will absorb odors. 
When cool keep in a tin box or stone jar closely covered. 
Never wrap in a cloth as it affects the flavor of the 
bread. The breadbox should be washed and scalded 
twice a week in winter, and every other day in summer. 

79.— PLAIN BREAD. 



1 pint lukewarm water. 
1 tsp. salt. 



2 to 2i quarts of flour. 
1 yeast cake. 



Put the yeast to dissolve in half cup of the lukewarm 
water. Put the remaining water and salt into a knead- 
ing pan or large bowl, and sift in about half the flour, 
or enough to make a drop batter. Beat this batter until 
it is full of bubbles, then stir in enough flour to make a 
soft dough. Flour the kneading board thickly and turn 
the dough on it ; roll the ball of dough in the flour before 
beginning to knead. Knead the dough until it does not 
stick to the hands or board, using as little flour during 
this process as possible. The dough should be smooth 
on the surface, feel spongy and elastic, and rise quickly 
after pressure. Put the ball of dough back in the bowl, 
brush the top with water, cover closely with a plate or 
tin cover, and keep at a temperature of 70° to 90° F. 
When it has doubled in bulk, divide into four pieces; 
mould each piece into a loaf, handle lightly, using little 
or no flour. Place each loaf in a greased bread -pan and 
cover with a clean towel. Keep at a temperature from 
70° to 90° F., until it has again doubled in bulk ; then 
bake in an oven hot enough to brown a teaspoon ful of 
flour in five minutes, from forty to flfty minutes.

make a stiff dough, and knead about twenty minutes. 
Return the dough to the bowl, cover closely, and let rise 
again until more than double in bulk (which will take 
about three hours). Turn out on a very lightly-Roured 
board, and roll out, without kneading, one-third of an 
inch thick. Cut with a floured biscuit cutter; crease 
through the centre of each roll with a floured knife 
handle ; brush one-half of each piece with melted

and hold one side a little distance above the fire, and 
move from side to side over the heat that all parts may 
dry alike. Dry the other side similarly. Then hold 
the first side nearer to the heat until colored a golden 
brown. Color tlie other side in the same way and serve 
at once standing on edge.

Simple Salads. 

Salads are valuable chiefly for the mineral matter 
which they contain and for their refreshing, appetizing 
qualities. The chief salad plants are lettuce, celery, 
watercress, cucumbers, etc., but may be made of almost 
any cold meat, or vegetable (canned or fresh). The 
dressing may be added at the table, or just before sending 
to the table. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR SALAD-MAKING. 

The leaves of salad plants must be thoroughly washed, 
crisped, in cold water, then drained, put in a wet cloth 
and kept in a cool place until wanted. 

Cooked vegetables are cut into suitable pieces, thor- 
oughly chilled, and mixed with the dressing just before 
serving. 

Meats should be freed from skin and gristle, cut into 
cubes and thoroughly chilled before mixing with the 
dressing. 

Fish should be flaked and all bones carefully removed 
and thoroughly chilled ; cover with the dressing without 
mixing.

Mix the salt, sugar, mustard and cayenne in a bowl, stir 
in the vinegar. Beat the eggs and stir into the vinegar 
and spices. Stir the butter into the sauce, then add the 
vinegar mixtures gradually, stirring quickly all the time. 
Cook until smooth and velvety. Turn into a cold bowl 
and stir occasionally until cool. If too thick for serving 
add cream, either plain or whipped, until it is of the 
consistency of good cream.

two inches of boiling water in it. Beat the eggs in a 
round bottomed bowl until very light, stir in the vinegar 
mixtTU-e, and stand tlie bowl in the boiling water. Stir 
constantly until it thickens and coats the spoon, then 
remove at once from the hot water, stir in the butter 
and stand away to get perfectly cold. 

One half cup cream (whipped) may be added when cold. 

PREPARATION OF LETI^UCE FOR SALADS. 

ChooHo fnish, crisp lettuce. When it comes from the 
^rd(!T) or market got two pans of cold water. Pick the

lettuce leaves apart, washing each carefully in one pan 
and dripping it into the other. Let them lie in the cold 
water about fifteen minutes, then shake as free from 
water as possible and roll them lightly in a clean towel. 
There should be enough water on the leaves to wet the 
towel, but if not see that it is wet but not dripping. 
Keep in the refrigerator or in a cold place. Treated in 
this way lettuce will keep for a day or two, and the nice 
inner leaves used whole for one meal, leaving the larger 
outer leaves to be shredded before serving.

and cook until nicely browned. Serve at once in a hot 
dish. The potatoes may be chopped with the knife 
while cooking. 

112.— PORK AND BEANS. 

Soak the beans over night in cold water. In the 
morning wash them well in a colander, put them on to 
boil in cold water, at the first boil drain this water oflT 
and cover with fresh boiling water. Score the rind off 
the pork and put it in Math the beans. Simmer gently 
until you can blow off" the skin of the beans. To do 
this, take three or four beans in your hand, blow hard on 
them, and if the skin cracks they are done. Take out

the pork and drain. Put the beans into an earthern pot 
or granite kettle with a cover ; ahnost bury the pork in the 
centre of the beans. Add one tablespoonful of salt to one 
pint of the water in which the beans were boiled, pour 
this into the pot, sprinkle with pepper, pour over the 
beans one large spoonful of molasses, put on the lid, bake 
in a moderate oven for six or eight hours. If baked in 
an ordinary iron baking pan they must be covered with 
another on which has been placed a weight, carefully 
watched, and baked only three hours.

of butter creamed. Cut bread — at least one day old — in 
very thin hUcch, spread with the mustard and butter paste, 
then witli the meat. Put two slices together and cut into 
any shape desired. (Chicken or veal sandwiches may be 
made by chopping tlu^ meat very fine, and adding to it 
a little of the cooked salad dressing or mayonnaise.)

115.— STUFFED TOMATOES. 

Take six large, smooth tomatoes, half a teaspoonful of 
salt, half a saltspoonful of pepper, half a tablespoonful 
of butter, half a tablespoonful of sugar, half a teaspoonful 
of onion juice, half a cupful of bread crumbs. Arrange 
the tomatoes in a baking pan. Cut a thin slice from the 
smooth end of each. With a small spoon scoop out as 
much of the pulp and juice as possible without injuring 
the shape. Mix the pulp and juice with the other 
ingredients and fill the tomatoes with this mixture. Put 
on the tops and bake slowly three-quarters of an hour. 
Lift the tomatoes carefully and place on a hot, flat dish, 
garnish with parsley, and serve. 

116.— SHEPHERD'S PIE.

1 small piece onion. 
J cup gravy, 
i tsp. salt. 



1 cup mashed potatoes. 
4 cup boiling milk. 
i tsp. butter. 
Pepper. 



Chop the onion fine, and mix it with the meat, gravy, 
half the salt and a little pepper. Put it into a small 
baking dish. Heat the milk and butter, and beat them 
into the mashed potatoes. Cover the meat with the 
potatoes, smoothing it with a wet knife. Bake in a mod- 
erate oven until it is brown. 

Note. — This may be prepared some hours before it is baked. 

117.— SCALLOPED POTATOES. 



1 cup cold potatoes cut in 

half inch dice. 
1 cup white sauce, (see page 

94) 



J cup dry breadcrumbs. 
^ tsp. butter or nice bacon 
dripping. 



94 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

Prepare the potatoes. Put the butter and crumbs in a 
saucepan and stir them over the fire until the butter is 
thoroughly mixed. Make the white sauce. Put one- 
third of the sauce in a small baking dish, cover it with 
half of the potatoes ; put in another third of the sauce, 
then the remainder of the potatoes ; and cover all with 
the rest of the sauce. Sprinkle tlie crumbs evenly over 
the top, and bake in a moderate oven until brown. 

Note. — Equal quantities of fish or meat may be substituted for the 
potatoes. 

Other vegetables may be used instead of potatoes. 

The dish may bo prepared some hours before it is to be baked. 

118._WHITE SAUCE 

1 cup milk. I J tbsp. butter. 

2 tbsps. flour. I J tsp. salt. 

Pepper to taste. 

Put three-quarters of the milk to heat in a saucepan, 
stirring often to prevent burning. Mix the flour in a 
small bowl with two tablespoonfuls of the cold milk, and 
thin it down with tlie remainder. Stir this gradually 
into the hot milk, and stir it constantly until it thickens 
and boils a minute. Stir in the butter, salt and pepper, 
and it is ready to serve. If it must stand, cover the 
saucepan closely and stand it in a pan of hot water or 
over steam. 

119.— CREAM SAUCE.

thickens and boils a minute. Stir in the seasoning and 
it is ready to serve. 

The milk may be heated before it is added, in which 
case it must be stirred gradually into the flour and butter. 
This is probably the better way when a large quantity 
is being made. 

120.— BAKED BEANS. 

2 cups white beans. | tsp. pepper, 

i lb. salt pork. 1 tbsp. salt. 

1 tsp. mustard. i tsp. molasses. 

2 tsps. sugar. 

Pick over, wash, and soak the beans, as if for " boiled 
beans." Drain, rinse, and put on to simmer in soft 
water. Wash off tlie pork, score the rind, and put it into 
simmer with the beans. 

Simmer until the bean skins crack open, when one is 
taken out and blown upon. Drain the water off and put 
into the bean pot, with the pork in the middle, showing 
only the rind. 

Put the mustard, sugar, pepper, salt and molasses in a 
cup, add boiling water and mix and pour over the beans. 
Add enough more boiling water to just cover the beans. 
Cover closely and bake ten hours or more in a slow oven. 

Keep the water just to the top of the beans, and never 
let it bubble. 

An earthen pot is best. 

121.— DRIPPING. 

Cut beef, mutton or pork fat into small pieces, put 
them into an iron or graniteware pan, cover with cold 
water and cook slowly over a moderate fire four or five 



96 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

hours, stirring frequently to prevent fat sticking to the 
pan. "When all the water has passed off and the fat is 
still, remove from the fire. When slightly cooled strain 
through cheesecloth. When quite cold cover tightly. 

122.— TO TRY OUT FAT. 

Cut the fat into bits and put into a pan in the oven 
with enough cold water to cover, and simmer for several 
hours. When the fat is melted, and nearly free from 
water, strain it, pressing with a spoon to get all the fat. 

123.— TO CLARIFY FAT. 

Melt drippings or tried-out fat and add to it a few 
slices of raw potato ; heat slowly in the oven until 
it ceases to bubble. The potato absorbs some of the 
impurities, the rest will settle to the bottom. Strain the 
fat through a very fine wire strainer, or cheesecloth, and 
set away until needed. 

124.— CARAMEL. 

Put in a smooth granite saucepan or omelet-pan one 
cup of sugar. Stir constantly over hot part of range 
until melted and of a deep golden-brown color. Care 
must be taken to prevent burning and from adhering to 
the sides of the pan. Add an equal (juantity of boiling 
water and simmer until it forms a thick syrup. Bottle 
and use for coloring sauces, soups, etc., and for puddings. 

126.— QUICK ICING FOR CAKE.

at a time until the sugar settles when not stirred. 
Spread on the cake while the latter is hot. 

126.— CHOCOLATE ICING. 

1 cup granulated sugar. I 1 oz. unsweetened chocolate. 

2 tsps. of water. 1 J tsp. vanilla. 

Scrape the chocolate fine, mix it with the sugar and 
water, and simmer about twenty minutes, or until thick 
enough to spread. Spread while hot on the cake. 

PRESERVING FRUIT. 

There are various methods of preserving fruit, but 
those in most common use are canning and preserving. 

Canning. 

Canning fruit is simply sterilizing it and keeping it in 
air-tight jars. Any fresh ripe fruit may be kept in this 
way. To can fruit successfully it is necessary to observe 
the following rules: — 

1. Have good fruit, ripe and fresh. 

2. See that the jars are air-tight (test by filling with 
water and inverting). 

3. Wash the jars, rubbers, covers and rims thoroughly, 
then scald. 

4. Have the rims and covers at hand so that the jars 
may be filled immediately the fruit is put into 
them. Have a pot of boiling water on the 'stove 
in which the jar should be dipped before filling. 

5. When the fruit is cooked, fill the jars to overflowing 
and screw on the top at once. Then wipe with a 
wet 'cloth and leave inverted until assured that 
the jar is air-tight. 



98 domestic science. 

Methods of Canning Fruit. 

1. Follow the usual method of cooking fruit in syrup 

(see page 28). 

2. Fill the jar with prepared fruit, cover with a syrup 

of desired consistency. Cover with the glass top. 
Put a wire frame or perforated board in the bot- 
tom of a kettle or the boiler, place the jars and fill 
the boiler with cold water up to the rim of the 
jar. Small fruit should remain ten minutes, and 
peaches, pears, etc., fifteen after the water boils. 
Remove the tops and fill the jar to overflowing 
with boiling syrup, and screw on the top immedi- 
ately. By this method fruit retains the flavor 
more than by cooking in an open kettle. An 
average syrup is made by boiling one pound of 
sugar to one pint of water. 

3. Wlien the fruit is cold give the tops a final screw 

before putting away in a cool, dark closet. 

Preserving. 

Preserving differs from canning, by Method No. 1, only 
by the amount of sugar used, and the longer cooking 
required. The proportion of fruit and sugar is usually 
pound for pound, and the two cooked together from ten 
to twenty minutes. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

Marketing. 

The ability to purchase food wisely comes only from 
experience, but the following hints may prove useful to 
the young housekeeper: 

Meat. — In the selection of meats it is a mistake to 
think that the higher-priced meats are more nutritious 
than the cheaper cuts. No doubt a well-broiled steak 
is more appetizing and delicate in flavor than the 
less expensive cut, but in proportion to its cost it is not 
equal in nutritive value. Careful cooking and judicious 
flavoring will render the cheaper piece equally palatable. 

Beef. — Good beef should be bright red, well marbled 
with yellowish-white fat. The flesli must be firm, and 
when pressed with the finger should retain no mark. 
The suet should be dry and crumble easily. 

Mutton. — The fat of good mutton is clear white and 
very hard. The flesh fine-grained and bright red. The 
best mutton is about three years old, and should hang 
three weeks before using. 

Lamb. — When killed from six weeks to three months 
old is called " spring lamb." Lamb one year old is called 
yearling. Lamb does not require to be hung like 
mutton. 

Veal. — The fat of veal should be white and clear and 

the lean pink or flesh-colored. White lean veal is unfit 

to eat. 

99 



100 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

Pork. — Fresh pork should be pale red and firm with 
white fat. Fat salt pork of good quality is white or 
faintly tinged with pink. 

Poultry. — Chicken not more than five months old is 
" spring chicken " ; chicken over a year old is " fowl." 
The breast-bone of a chicken or young fowl is yielding, 
and the leg scales yellow and soft. Older fowls 
have a hard breast-bone, horny leg scales, more fat and 
a thicker and yellower skin. Full grown poultry is 
finer in flavor than young chickens, and a young cock is 
the best for roasting. 

Turkeys. — Good turkeys have smooth, black legs, 
plump breasts, soft spurs, and white flesh. As a rule, hen 
turkeys are best. 

Duck or Goose. — The windpipe of a young duck 
or goose is brittle enough to snap readily between 
the thumb and finger, and the feet are soft and yellow. 
Ducks or geese should not be more than a year old. 

Fish. — The flesh of good fresh fish is firm and hard, 
and will rise at once when pressed with the finger. If 
the eyes be dull and sunken, the gills pale and the flesh 
flabby or soft, the fish is not fresh and should not be 
purchased. 

Eggs. — Fresh efrgn have a thick rough shell, and the 
contents will not rattle if shaken. The contents are clear 
if held between the eye and tlio light, and if dropped 
into a bowl of cold water it will go to the bottom and 
lie on its side. Fnssh eggs only arc .suitable for boiling, 
omolctH and other (!gg dishes. Well preserved may bo 
combined with other materials in cooking. 



MARKETING. 101 

Milk. — Great care should be exercised in the purchase 
of milk. Good milk is a yellowish-white, opaque liquid, 
with a slightly sweet taste ; it should have no sediment 
and should not look blue around the edge. The house- 
keeper should demand that the milk supply comes from 
clean stables, is delivered by clean dealers in clean vessels, 
and covered from the air. 

Butter. — Good butter is firm, not crumbly or pasty, 
yields little water when pressed, and foams when heated. 
It is always an expensive article and should be selected 
with care. It is wiser to economize by using some 
cheaper fat, such as good dripping, in cooking, than to 
buy a poor grade of butter because it is cheap. It is 
economical to purchase the winter's supply in October, 
if one can get it from a reliable source, and can keep it 
in a cool place. 

Flour. — Flour maybe purchased in quantities sufficient 
for six months if kept in a cool dry place, as age improves 
it. 

Cereals. — All breakfast cereals are better when fresh, 
and should be purchased in small quantities. 

Tea, Coffee. — Tea and coffee should be purchased in 
small quantities, as they lose strength and flavor if kept 
too long. 

Spices, etc. — Spices, flavors, etc., should be purchased 
in small quantities, and it' is unprofitable to buy any 
but the purest. 

Canned Goods. — In buying canned goods do not buy 
a can if the ends bulge, as that indicates that the can 
has not been air-tight, and the contents are probably 
poisonous. 



102 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

CARE OF FOOD. 

One may purchase food with good judgment and yet 
fail as an economical housekeeper through the improper 
care of it. Perfect cleanliness is essential for the best 
preservation of food. Every place in which food is kept 
should be frequently inspected and kept thoroughly clean. 
Heat and moisture tend to cause decay, therefore it is 
important that all foods should be kept in a cool, clean, 
dry place. Cooked food, especially animal food, spoils 
quickly if covered closely while still warm. All soups, 
meat, bread, etc., should be cooled thoroughly and quickly 
before being covered and stored away. 

In hot weather it is a good plan to put the vessel con- 
taining liquids to cool in another pan of cold water. 

Meat. — Meat should be removed from the wrapping 
paper as soon as it comes into the house, and any parts 
that are not clean and sweet removed before putting it 
away. If it is not to be hung, put it on a dish and keep 
in a cool place. Never put meat directly on the ice. 
When preparing meat for cooking wipe it off with a 
clean wet cloth ; never allow it to soak in the water. 

Poultry. — If poultry be drawn and a few pieces of 
charcoal placed in tlio Ixxly, it will keep longer than if 
hung undrawn. Poultry must not bo washed until it is 
to bo cooked. 

Fish. — FImH should not be kept long in the house 
before c<x)king, as it must be kept cold and is apt to taint 
other food. 

Eggs. — Eggs sliould be carefully waslied when they 
come into the house. Shells may bo saved for clarifying 
purposes. Keep in a cool, dry place. 



CARE OF FOOD. 103 

Milk. — Milk should be kept in a cool place, and away 
from all odors and dust. The vessel in which milk is 
kept should be free from crevices, of such shape as to be 
easily cleaned and scalded, and have a closely fitted cover. 
Glass, crockery, bright tin or granite make suitable milk 
vessels. When emptied they should be soaked in cold 
water, washed in hot soapy water, rinsed, then scalded in 
boiling water. 

Butter. — Butter must be kept in a cool, dry place> 
covered and away from odors. 

Biscuits, Cake, Etc. — Should be kept in air-tight 
tins or boxes. 

Cereals, Rice, Etc. — Should be kept in tin boxes or 
glass jars, so as to protect them from mice, insects, etc. 

Flour and Sugar. — Should be protected from mice 
and insects. 

Canned Goods. — Never leave any tinned food in the 
can after it has been opened but turn at once into a bowl, 
and do not keep more than a day or two after opening. 
Keep in a cold place. 

Fat. — If water or any foreign substance be left in fat it 
will spoil quickly, therefore, all trimmings of fat should 
be rendered while they are sweet and strained into jars 
kept for the purpose. Beef, pork, mutton and chicken 
fat may be put together and kept for deep frying. Ham, 
bacon and sausage fat may be used together for sauter- 
ing. Duck, turkey and all strongly flavored fats may be 
kept for soap-making. 

Left Overs. — It is rarely necessary to waste food if 
proper attention is given to utilizing food remnants. 



104 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

Many dainty and healthful dishes may be prepared from 
these remnants by the exercise of taste and skill. The 
secret of such cookery lies in proper seasoning and 
avoiding a " messy " appearance. 

Pieces of cold meat or fish may be used for scallop 
dishes, or combined in baked dishes with rice, hominy, etc. 

Bits of cooked ham, sausage and cold meat may be used 
for hash, and if there is a little gravy it may be used 
instead of water for moistening the hash. 

Tough pieces of meat and bones may be used in making 
stews or soup stock. All kinds of meat and vegetable 
water, except potato water, may be used for stock- 
making. 

Gravy, sauces and soups, no matter how small the 
quantity, may be used for warming over meat, fish and 
vegetables. 

A few spoonfuls of almost any kind of meat, fish or 
vegetable, may be chopped, heated in a sauce, and spread 
over a plain omelet. 

A soft boiled egg left from a meal, may bo boiled until 
hard and used in salad or e^g sauce. 

Pieces of bread may be converted into puddings, 
griddle-cakes, and dried crumbs. Pieces of cake and 
giiigorbroad may bo used in puddings. A few tablo- 
Hpoonfuls of cold rico or breakfast cereals may bo added 
to muffins or griddlo-cakes. 



CHAPTER XIV. 
Table Service. 

A Few General Hints on Setting the Tablk 

Clean table linen — no matter how coarse — is possible 
for every one. A dish of fruit or flowers, if only a bunch 
of green foliage, improves the appearance of the table. 

When setting the table, cover first with a canton- 
flannel or felt cloth, in order to prevent noise and protect 
the table. 

See that the tablecloth is spread smoothly, that the 
comers are of equal length, that the crease is exactly 
in the centre. Place the fruit or flowers in the centre of 
the table. 

For each person place knife, spoon and glass on the 
right, fork and napkin on the left. Place the glass at 
the point of the knife. Turn the edge of the knife 
towards the plate and the fork tines up, the spoon with 
the bowl up. If soup is to be served, place a square of 
bread or a roll on top of the napkin or between the folds. 
Place the pepper and salt at the corners of the table, unless 
individual salts are used, when they should be placed at 
the head of the plates, where the dessert spoon may be 
placed — the handle towards the right — for convenience. 

Serving Food. 

Hot food should be served hot, and on hot plates. 
Cold food should be served very cold. A little garnish 
of parsley, hard-boiled e^g, sliced lemon, toast, watercress 

105 



100 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

or centre of a lettuce head adds much to the attractive- 
ness of a dish. Small rolls, a sqiiare of bread, or 
croutons should be served with soup. Sliced lemon with 
fish. Cold beets, carrots, turnips, and the whites of hard- 
boiled eggs, stamped out with a fancy vegetable cutter, 
make a pretty garnish for cold meats. Toast cut into 
triangles makes a suitable garnish for many dishes. 

The general rule in serving simple family meals, with 
or without a waitress, is for the hostess to serve the por- 
ridge and cofiee at breakfast ; the soup, salad and dessert 
at dinner, and pour the tea at the evening meal. When 
luncheon is served in the middle of the day the hostess 
usually does the greater part of the serving, as luncheon 
is considered to be the most informal meal of the day. 

The daughters of the house should consider it their 
special privilege to save the mother any annoyance 6r 
discomfort during the meal time. 

Look over the table and see that everything is in its 
place before announcing a meal. Fill the glasses with 
water before the family enter the dining-room. 

Lift the covers from the hot dishes and turn over at 
once in order to prevent the steam from dropping on the 
cloth. Take the plates from the Iiost or liostess, and 
phice before each person from the right aide — keeping 
the thumb well under the plate. When passing anything 
from which the persons seated at table help themselves, 
such as vegetables, sauces, etc., always go to the left, so 
as to leave the right hand of the one to be served free. 
When removing plate, etc., go to the right. Keep a 
waU'hful (!yo over the table and pass anything appar- 
ently required. 



TABLE SERVICE. 107 

Learn to move quickly and quietly. 

Never allow dishes, which have been used, to accumulate 
on the table or allow the table to become disordered. 

Learn to receive instructions from the hostess in an 
undertone. Do not get excited and try to do too many 
things at once. It is an accomplishment to be a good 
waitress, as it requires special refinement and deftness, 
which are scarcely compatible with an untidy nature. 

No matter how simple the meal may be, every house- 
keeper should see that it is served neatly and on time. 

A Few Points to be Considered in Planning Meals. 

Dietetic authorities advise people who are engaged in 
active muscular work to partake of the more substantial 
meal in the middle of the day, leaving such articles of 
food as soup — which is a valuable stimulant after a day 
of hard work — fruit, cake, etc., for the evening meal when 
the system is too much exhausted to digest the more 
concentrated foods. When men are obliged to take cold 
lunches in the middle of the day the housewife should see 
that the lunch basket contains the necessary nourishment 
in the form of cheese, cold meat, meat or fish sandwiches, 
hard boiled eggs, a fish or vegetable salad, cold pork and 
beans, rice pudding, whole- wheat bread and butter, a 
bottle of milk or strained tea or coffee, pie, doughnuts, 
etc. 

Remember, a man working in the open air or in a large 
building requires food which will not oxidize too quickly, 
or, in other words, food which will keep up the fuel and 
force necessary for his work. Supper in such cases 
should consist of a good broth or well made soup, and the 



108 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

lighter foods ; but breakfast and dinner should be more 
substantial. It is a question of economy to provide 
suitable food for the wage-earner. The children may be 
equally well nourished on a less expensive diet, such as 
whole-wheat bread and butter, milk puddings, fruit, green 
vegetables, cereals, milk, and meat once a day. 

On the other hand, the individual engaged in sedentary 
employment, such as book-keeping, teaching, needlework, 
etc., should dine later in the day, as it leaves a longer 
interval for digestion, which is much slower when the 
individual is confined in a close office or work-room, and 
where little exercise is taken.* Care should be taken in 
planning meals for this class to avoid food which requires 
much oxygen, such as fresh pork, fried food, sausage, 
warm bread, pastry, griddle cakes, etc. The mid-day 
meal of a brain worker or business man should be light ; 
a soup, glass of milk (hot or cold), fruit, bread and butter, 
vegetable salad, a broiled chop or steak, etc., are suitable 
for luncheon. 

Special attention should be given to the diet of school 
children. 

Students and children who are obliged to study at 
night should, as a rule, take some light nourishment be- 
fore retiring; a biscuit, a piece of bread and butter, or a 
glass of hot milk, is sufficient. 

Young girls, who are employed in shops, factories, etc., 
freqtiejjtly hurry away to their work in the morning 
without taking a substantial breakfjist. It is needlcsH to 
say that such action is sure to bo followed by a physical

breakdown, A glass of hot milk or an egg beaten and 
added to a glass of milk will serve as an occasional sub- 
stitute for a more substantial meal, but is not enough to 
sustain active exercise for any length of time. 

Another point to consider in the planning of meals 
is economy of fuel. The thoughtful housekeeper will 
arrange to have food requiring long, slow cooking, such 
as stews, soup stock, bread, etc., and ironing done by the 
same fuel. Broiling, toasting, omelets, etc., require a 
quick fire. It is in the careful consideration of details 
that economy in both food and fuel may be exercised. 



CARING FOR INVALIDS. 

One of the first considerations in caring for an invalid 
is the ventilation of the sick room. Care must be taken 
that the air is not vitiated by anything in the room, such 
as a kerosene lamp, wilted cut flowers, soiled clothing, 
etc. The bed should be so arranged as to avoid a draft 
— especially when airing the room. If the room is too 
small to allow this, a very good way to protect the 
patient is to raise an umbrella and place it over the head 
and shoulders ; over this put a blanket while the room is 
being aired ; allowing it to remain until the room has 
reached the desired temperature again. Never turn the 
wick of a lamp below the point of free combustion in 
the room of either sick or well, as the odor is not only 
disagreeable but injurious. 

One of the most important essentials in a sick room is 
perfect cleanliness of the room, the bed linen and cloth- 
ing of the patient. Never air or dry cloths or garments 
in the sick room. Cover the broom with a damp flannel 



110 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

cloth in sweeping, so as to avoid noise and prevent the 
dust from rising. Avoid noise in placing coal on the 
fire by putting the coal in a paper bag, placing bag and 
all upon the fire. Do not allow loud talking or discus- 
sion in the sick room ; neither is whispering desirable, 9js 
it is apt to irritate the patient. 

One should avoid visiting a sick room when in a violent 
perspiration, or with an empty stomach, as the system 
at that time is more susceptible to contagion. 

Do not consult the patient about the food, but see that 
tempting, wholesome varieties are provided, in accordance 
with the doctor's orders concerning the diet. Serve food 
in small quantities, and either hot or cold, as the article 
may require. A warm dish which should be hot, and a 
tepid drink or food, which should be cold, is one of the 
most objectionable and unappetizing forms of serving food. 
Do not allow fresh fruit, which is intended for the patient, 
to remain in the sick room, but keep in a cool place and 1 
serve when needed. In some cases, wlien the system has 
been overtaxed, either mentally or physically, a complete 
rest is necessary, and the diet sliould be food which 
merely satisfies the hunger — neither stimulating nor 
especially nourishing. Such foods come under the head ■ 
of gruels, soups, jellies, fruit and drinks. On the other ^ 
hand when a patient has become wasted from a long 
continued illness and requires building up, more nourish- 
ment is re(|uired.to supply tlie waste. In some cases the 
food mnst be given in concentrated form. Milk is one 
of the most valuable foods in this class ; sometimes it re- 
quires the addition of a little pc^psin in order to fiicilitate 
dige8tion; sometimes the addition of a pinch of salt 
makos milk not only more agre(;able to the patient, but 



CARING FOR INVALIDS. Ill 

aids digestion. Eggs, either lightly boiled or in egg-nog, 
are easily digested and very nourishing. Meat and milk 
soups, farina and oatmeal gruel, port wine jelly, albumen 
and milk (which is the white of e^rg and milk shaken 
together), and in some cases a bit of carefully broiled 
steak or chop, with dry toast, are suitable foods for this 
class of patient. In convalescence, any well cooked, 
easily digested food may be given. Fried food, rich 
puddings and pastry must be carefully avoided. 

People with consumptive tendencies should eat whole- 
some, easily digested food, with plenty of fat such as 
cream, butter, fat of bacon and of roast beef, mutton? 
olive oil, salads, cornmeal and cereals, and take plenty of 
outdoor exercise. A few simple recipes are given, which 
are suitable for invalids. 

Beverages. 

1. — Barley Water. — Take two ounces of pearl barley 
and wash well with cold water at least two or three 
times. Put into a saucepan with one and-a-half pints of 
water, and allow it to boil for twenty minutes closely 
covered. Strain and sweeten, and flavor with lemon juice ; 
a little lemon peel may be added while boiling if desired. 

2. — Apple Water, — Take two or three tart apples. 
After baking, put them in a bowl and pour over them 
one cup of boiling water, strain and sweeten to taste; 
serve when cold. 

3. — Flax-Seed Tea. — One-half cupful of flax-seed — 
which has been carefully washed in cold water — to one 
quart of boiling water ; boil slowly thirty minutes, move 
to the back of the stove and allow it to remain ten or 



112 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

fifteen minutes longer. Strain, and flavor to taste with 
lemon juice and sugar. 

4. — LeTTionade. — Slice one lemon, add one tablespoon- 
ful of sugar, press the lemon and sugar, add one cup of 
boiling water. Strain and serve hot or cold as required. 

5. — Orange Water. — Made the same as lemonade. 

Meat Extractives. 

6. — Beef Juice is prepared by broiling until the meat 
is heated through, then placing it in a lemon squeezer 
and pressing until all the juice is extracted. Heat until 
warm enough to be palatable, add a little salt, and by 
way of variety it may be poured over a slice of hot dry 
toast. 

7. — Beef Tea. — Cut juicy pieces of steak — the round 
steak is the best — into small pieces, cover with cold 
water and heat gradually to 160 F. Allow it to remain 
at this temperature ten or fifteen minutes. Press, strain, 
and flavor with salt and pepper. 

8. — Beef Tea (No. 2). — Put a pound of finely minced 
beef into a glass fruit jar, add a pint of cold water. Let 
it stand for an hour, stirring and pressing occasionally. 
Place the jar in a kettle of water ; place over the fire 
and allow the water to reach boiling point. Move back 
where the water will just simmer for an hour, keeping 
the jar closely covered. Strain the beef tea through a 
fine wire strainer; allowing tlui fine sediment to puss 
through, which should bo drunk with the licpiid. Flavor 
with salt. 

\),—Beef A'ssence.— (This method is highly recom- 
mended.) One ounce of tinely chopped fresh beef, free 



CARING FOR INVALIDS. 113 

from fat; pour over it eight ounces of soft water, add five 
or six drops of dilute hydrochloric acid, and fifty or sixty 
grains of common salt, stir well, and leave for three hours 
in a cool place. Strain the fluid through a hair sieve, press- 
ing the meat slightly ; adding gradually toward the end 
of the straining, two ounces of water. The liquid is of a 
bright red color, tasting like soup. It should be served 
cold, in a small quantity at a time. If preferred warm 
it must not be put on the fire, but heated in a covered 
vessel placed in hot water. 

10. — Chicken Broth. — Singe and clean a small chicken. 
One-half of the chicken may be used for broth, and the 
other half for broiling or a fricassee. Disjoint, and cut 
the meat into small pieces. Break or crush the bones. 
Dip the feet into boiling water and scald until the skin 
and nails will peel off" (as the feet contain gelatin). Cover 
the meat, feet and bones with cold water; heat very 
slowly, and simmer till the meat is tender. A few min- 
utes, before removing from the fire add salt and pepper 
to taste, also one-half of a teaspoonful of sugar. Strain 
and when cool remove the fat. When needed, heat the 
necessary quantity, and if desired very clear add the shell 
and white of one egg. Let this boil slowly three or four 
minutes. Skim and strain through a fine cloth. A little 
lemon juice may be added to vary the flavor. This may 
be poured into small cups and kept in a cool place ; or if 
the patient can take it some of the breast meat may be 
cut into small pieces and moulded with it. If the broth 
is served hot, it should not be cleared with egg. 

11. — Mutton Broth. — Chop one pound of lean, juicy 
mutton very fine ; pour over it one pint of cold water. Let 
it stand until the water is very red, then heat it slowly. 



114 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

Allow it to simmer ten minutes. Strain, season, and if 
liked thick, two tablespoonfuls of soft boiled rice may be 
added ; or it may be thickened with a little cornstarch 
wet with cold water and stirred into the hot broth. Serve 
very hot. If there is not enough time to cool the broth 
and re-heat, the fat may be removed by using a piece of 
tissue, coarse brown or blotting paper, which, by passing 
over the surface, will remove any fat which cannot be 
taken off with a spoon. 

12. — Oatmeal Gruel. — To one quart of boiling water 
add one-quarter of a cup of oatmeal, one-quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Boil one hour, strain and serve with or 
without milk. Another method is to cover the oatmeal 
with cold water. Stir well ; let it settle, then pour off 
the mealy water in a saucepan. Then boil the water. 

13. — Egg Soup. — Put one ounce of sago with one-half 
pint of milk into a double-boiler, and cook twenty minutes. 
Strain through a sieve and add one-half pint of beef 
extract (or Bouillon). Wlien hot take it from the fire 
and stir gradually into it the yolks (well beaten) of two 
eggs. Season to taste, and serve. Chicken or mutton 
broth may be used. 

14. — Albumen arid Milk. — Put the white of one egg 
into one-half pint of milk. Pour into a pint fruit jar, 
screw on the top tightly and shako well for one minute, 
when it should be light and smooth. Serve at once. A 
pinch of salt may bo added if desired. 

16. — Egg-Nog. — Beat one egg until very light, add two 
teaspoonfuls of sugar and boat again ; add two-thirds of a 
cup of cold inilk, mix woU, and if ordered, two toaspoon- 
fuls of brandy nniy bo added. A pinch of salt added to 
the yolk of tlio egg makes it more palatable. 



CARING FOR INVALIDS. 115 

16. — Orange Soup. — Soak the juice of an orange, one- 
third of the grated rind, and one teaspoonful of lemon 
juice for one-half hour. Strain, and make the liquid up 
to a cupful with water. Bring to boiling point and add 
two level teaspoonfuls of arrowroot, moistened with a 
very little cold water, stirring constantly until it thickens. 
When it reaches the boiling point, add one tablespoonful 
of sugar, turn into a bowl and stand away to cool. Serve 
very cold. (Any tart fruit juice may be used for this 
soup.) 

17. — Arrowroot (rrueZ.— Dissolve two level teaspoonfuls 
of arrowroot in a little cold water, add one cup of boiling 
water, cook for a few seconds ; take from the fire, add a 
tablespoonful of sugar, one tablespoonful of lemon juice. 
(One agg may be beaten, white and yolk separately, until 
very light, mix them carefully and pour over the egg 
slowly one pint of hot arrowroot gruel, made as above ; 
stir until well mixed.) 

18. — Rice Water or Jelly.— Vick over and wash carefully 
two tablespoonfuls of rice, and cook in water until the 
rice is dissolved. Add salt and sugar to taste. If in- 
tended to jelly, add lemon juice and strain into a mould. 
Serve cold with cream and sugar. If to be used as a 
drink, add enough hot water to make a thin liquid, and 
boil longer. A little stick cinnamon may be added a few 
minutes before straining. Serve hot or cold. 

19. — Stewed Figs. — Take some choice figs, wash, then 
cover them with cold water. Soak over night. In the 
morning bring them to boiling point, and keep them over 
the fire, just simmering for twenty minutes, or until the 
figs are plump and soft. Lift them out carefully, and boil 



116 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

down the liquor until it forms a syrup. Pour this over 
the figs and serve cold, whipped or plain cream may be 
served with them. 

20. — Jellied Chicken. — Take a young, tender chicken. 
Prepare and disjoint it as a fricassee. Put a bay-leaf, a 
stock of celery about four inches long, and two whole 
peppercorns in the bottom of a bowl. Then put in the 
chicken. Stand the bowl in a pot of boiling water, being 
careful that the steam shall not drip, or the water boil 
over into the chicken. Cover the pot closely and keep 
the water boiling until the meat is tender enough to 
allow the bones to slip out. Remove the skin and bones 
and put the remainder of the chicken into a pint bowl 
or mould. Season the remaining liquor with salt, and 
strain over the meat. Stand in a cool place to harden. 
(Do not add water to the chicken when cooking.) 



CHAPTER XV. 

The House and its Care. 

It is not always possible to choose a dwelling-place 
or its furnishings as one would wish; circumstances 
must always control such matters, but there are certain 
precautions to be observed in every home. There should 
be a good supply of pure fresh air and water, plenty of 
sunlight and good drainage. The furnishing should be 
in keeping with the place and mode of living to be 
practised. The aim of the homemaker should be to 
keep the house clean, to have "a place for everything 
and everything in its place," to provide suitable, properly- 
cooked food, and to arrange the affairs of the household 
so as to avoid confusion of duties, and to surround those 
under her care with influences which will tend to make 
the home a place of rest and contentment. These con- 
ditions are not dependent upon wealth, but are possible 
in the most simple home. The true homemaker will not 
sacrifice the welfare and comfort of the family to out- 
ward display. The housekeeper should understand the 
amount of income at her disposal and regulate her 
expenses accordingly. 

There are certain essentials to be observed in the 
management of a home, no matter upon what scale it is 
established. Chief among these is a systematic arrange- 
ment of duties so as to secure the greatest amount of 
comfort with the least expenditure of time, labor and 
money. 



118 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

Various Rooms and their Uses. 

The average house consists of a sitting-room, dining- 
room, kitchen, pantry, bedrooms, bathroom (except in 
the country where, if possible, a room should be set 
apart for this purpose), closets and cellar. Each of 
these rooms has its special use and requires special 
care. 

The SrrriNG-RooM. 

In a well-ordered household the sitting-room should 
be the social centre of family life. It should be one 
of the largest and brightest rooms in the house, and 
furnished with a view to comfort rather than appearance 
only. There is no place in a well-ordered home for the 
stiff " parlor " loaded with bric-a-brac, with blinds drawn 
to keep out the sunlight, and the furniture chosen for 
ornament rather than use. The sitting-room should be 
the family room in the truest sense, the room which will 
invite rest and pleasant social intercourse after the work 
of the day has been accomplished, and which will remain 
a pleasant memory of home while life lasts. If possible 
this room should have a hardwood floor. The cracks 
in an ordinary pine floor may be filled with putty or 
other filling and the whole painted any desired color 
(oak is the most satisfactory), with a rug in the centre. 
The rug need not be an expensive one ; any kind of 
carpet may bo made into a rug and tacked into place. 
There should be a comfortable couch with plenty of 
pillows in this room, a useful table, a bookcase and some 
comfortable chairs. A f(!W plants, pictures, piano, etc., 
may l>o added us tlio means will allow, but the essentials 
should come first 



I 



the house and its care. 119 

The Dining-Room. 

There are only two articles absolutely necessary for 
this room, a table and some chairs. But few dining- 
rooms are limited to the bare necessaries. The table 
should be of good width, and the chairs should be as 
comfortable as possible. A hardwood or stained floor is 
best for a dining-room. A rug may be used and the 
border of the room stained to match. Elaborate draperies, 
etc., are out of place in a dining-room. The furnishing of 
the table is one of the most important matters in connec- 
tion with this room. Table china can now be purchased 
in artistic designs at prices within reach of all house- 
keepers. As a rule " the best is the cheapest " but with 
care the cheaper wares may last a long time. Simple 
patterns, in soft tints, or plain white will give greater 
satisfaction than the more glaring colors, of which one 
soon tires. Neat patterns in glassware may be purchased 
at little cost, and the little accessories which make a 
table attractive, such as a pretty flower vase, neat designs 
for holding pepper and salt, etc., are inexpensive. The 
cutlery may be of sterling silver, silverplate or steel, 
according to the means of the user, but no matter what 
the quality, it must be well cared for and placed on the 
table in spotless condition. 

The Kitchen. 

From the practical standpoint the kitchen is the most 
important room in the house, and as the greater portion 
of the housekeepers' time is spent there, it should be fur- 
nished so as to make the work as easy and attractive as 
possible. Great care should be taken in the selection of 
a range, as the first essential in kitchen furnishing. • Care 



120 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

should be taken in furnishing a kitchen to have the 
articles in most frequent use in convenient places, so as 
to save as many steps as possible. It is economy to 
buy good articles, for kitchen use. Granite ware is more 
easily cleaned, but is not so durable as iron, steel or 
copper. Special attention should be given to the ventila- 
tion of the kitchen, not only in the interest of the 
workers' health, but to prevent disagreeable odors pene- 
trating into the other rooms. 

As the laboratory of the home, its equipment and 
care should be as complete as possible. A carpeted 
combination of kitchen and sitting-room is not a wise 
arrangement. There should not be any draperies or 
furnishings in a kitchen which will absorb odors. The 
floor should be of hardwood, stained or covered with 
linoleum. The plumbing should be open. A range, table, 
cupboard, a couple of chairs (one low, comfortable cliair), 
are the only necessary articles of furniture required in a 
kitchen. 

Absolute cleanliness should be the watchword in 
every well-regulated kitchen. 

Bedrooms. 

From the hygienic point of view there should be as 
few furnishings as possible in a bedroom. A stained 
floor, with rugs, or straw matting is more easily cleaned 
than a carpet. Tlio furniture should be solid and with 
good finish, but with as little onuun(»ntation as i)OHsiblo. 
The most important article of bedroom furniture is the 
mattress and springH. Better save in the cost of the 
other fumituro and 8i>end it on the article wliicli is most 



THE HOUSE AND ITS CARE. 121 

conducive to comfort. The bed should be placed so as to 
avoid a strong glare of light from the window. Wash- 
able curtains and simple decorations are the most suitable 
for bedrooms. 

Bathroom. 

The chief furniture of an ordinary bathroom should be. 
in addition to the stationary necessaries, a chair, medicine 
cabinet, towel rod or rack, and an abundant supply of 
towels. A hardwood floor or covering of linoleum is the 
most suitable for a bathroom. 

Division of Work in the Home. 

It is a difficult matter for those who have not had 
special training to divide the work of the household so 
as to get through the regular daily routine without 
confusion and unnecessary exertion. Every housekeeper 
should make out a plan of work, as well as of meals for 
the week, always allowing for special duties. Habits of 
order should be cultivated by every member of the 
household, as carelessness and unpunctuality increase 
the burden of the housekeeper, and make it difficult to 
follow any system of order. 

The following order may serve as a basis upon which 
to arrange a division of work where the family is limited 
in number to not more than four. 

Rise at least one hour before the serving of breakfast. 
First, make the kitchen fire and put range in order (see 
page 9). Rinse and fill the tea kettle (allow the water 
to run for some minutes before filling kettle). While 
waiting for the water to boil sweep off the front and 
back steps, porch, etc. When the water has boiled 
prepare the cereal ; put the table dishes to heat ; air and 



122 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

dust the dining-room and set the table. Prepare and 
serve the breakfast. 

After breakfast see that the various rooms are aired, 
take the clothes off the beds and spread over chairs so 
as to allow the air to reach every part. Turn the 
mattresses and leave the room to air at least an hour. 

Now, return to the kitchen and wash the dishes, 
towels, etc. Put the dining-room and kitchen in order. 
If there is anything to prepare for dinner which requires 
long, slow cooking, it should be attended to before going 
on with the housework. Now, return to the bedrooms, 
make the beds, empty the slops, wash and wipe the 
toilet ware. Put the room in order, unless the day for 
special cleaning, when the movable furniture should be 
beaten, dusted and removed from the room, the small 
articles dusted and placed on the bed, where they should 
be closely covered with a dusting sheet. Sweep the 
room, then leave it until tlie other rooms have been put 
in order. Wash the basin, soapdish, and bathtub, fold 
the towels neatly on the roller or towel rack, dust the 
room, wipe off the floor, see that bottles, etc., are in the 
proper place. Now, dust tlie lialls, sitting-room, and 
settle the room which has been turned out. Prepare 
dinner or luncheon. 

NoTB. — While this may seom an intcrminahlo round of dutioH to bo 
performed in one morning, it will bo found quite poRsihlo by a syH- 
tematic and energetic etrort, to have at least one hour to rest before 
preparing dinner or lunolioon. 

If dinner is served in the middle of the day the 
evening meal should be as simple as possible. Any 
special dish recpiired for suppt^r should be pnjpared, if 
possible, while cooking the dinner. It is a mistake 



THE HOUSE AND ITS CARE. 123 

to sacrifice the other interests of the home to the 
preparation of elaborate meals. 

Cleaning- a Room. 

1. Beat and dust any upholstered furniture, cover 
closely with a dust sheet. 

2. Dust and remove any ornaments and lighter articles 
of furnitufe. 

3. If there are rugs, roll them up and put out of doors 
to be aired and beaten. 

4. Sweep the floor. If carpeted, sprinkle over it 
before sweeping either damp tea-leaves or damp paper 
torn in bits. If a stained or painted floor wash with a 
clean, soft cloth, and when dry rub over with a cloth 
damped with kerosene. 

5. While the dust is settling brush and shake the 
rugs. 

6. Wipe the walls and ceilings, tops of doors and 
windows. 

7. Wipe carefully the picture glass and dust the 
frames. 

8. Wipe all dust from window-ledges, frames and 
blinds. 

9. Dust the room and wash the windows. 

10. Wipe the parpet with a cloth wrung out of tepid 
water in which has been added three or four table- 
spoonfuls of ammonia (this will brighten the color). 

11. If rugs are used put in place, arrange the furniture, 
ornaments, etc. 



124 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

Once a month should be often enough for a thorough 
cleaning of a room under ordinary conditions. A carpet 
sweeping and careful dusting should be sufficient daily- 
care. One or more rooms should be thoroughly cleaned 
each week, and a day set apart for that purpose. 

Care of the Cellar. 

There is no part of the house in which cleanliness is of 
greater importance than in the cellar. Odors arising from 
decayed vegetables or other causes are not only disagree- 
able but are a menace to health. There should be enough 
windows in the cellar to secure plenty of light and air, 
and they should be opened every day. The floor should 
be thoroughly swept, and if made of cement should be 
washed occasionally. Every corner should be cleaned. 
The walls should be whitewashed once or twice a year. 
See that all the shelves, tables, etc., are washed at least 
two or three times during the year. A box or barrel of 
unslaked lime is an excellent thing to keep in a cellar, 
especially if it is at all damp. 

Care of Sink. 

A neglected sink may be a fruitful source of disease 
in addition to attracting water-bugs and other pests. 
Never leave ficrapa in the sink after washing the dishes, 
but wash carefully, using small scrubbing brush and 
sapolio. Clean brass faucets with flannel dipped in 
vinegar or lemon juice, rub thorouglily with rottenstone 
and oil, then polish with a dry cloth. Any preparation 
for cleaning brass may be used. If the faucets are 
gnjasy wa8h them with warm soap-suds before using 
anything else. Nickel faucets may be washed with hot 



THE HOUSE AND ITS CARE. 125 

soap-suds, wiped dry and polished with a soft flannel or 
chamois. 

The waste-pipe must be kept free from grease. After 
pouring down greasy water, immediately pour down 
boiling water so as to prevent the grease from sticking 
to the pipes. Two or three times a week pour down a 
strong solution of sal-soda — about a half cupful of soda 
to two quarts of hot water. 

Garbage Pail. 

Scrub and scald the garbage pail every day. If dried 
in the sunshine no other disinfectant is required. 

Care of Refrigerator. 

The refrigerator should be thoroughly cleaned once 
a week. 

1. Remove all food and ice. 

2. Take out ice-rack and wash with hot water and sal- 
soda, and rinse with clear hot water. 

3. Wash out the ice-box in same way. 

4. Wash the food-chambers with hot water without 
soap, using sal-soda if necessary. 

5. Run a wire with a cloth tied on the end down the 
waste-pipe. 

6. Pour boiling water, in which sal-soda has been 
dissolved, down the waste-pipe. 

7. Clean all corners and grooves with a cloth and 
skewer. 

8. Wipe the refrigerator dry, and leave the doors open 
for at least an hour. 



126 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

The waste-pipe should empty into a pan or have 
a pipe connected with a well-trapped drain-pipe and 
finished with a funnel under the waste-pipe of the 
refrigerator. This is better than having the two pipes 
connect closely, as the refrigerator may be moved for 
cleaning purposes if necessary. 

Do not keep food with a strong odor, such as fish or 
onions, in a refrigerator with butter, milk, etc. 

Care of Towels. 

One of the most important, yet most frequently 
neglected, details of kitchen work is the care of towels 
and dish-cloths. A dirty dish-cloth breeds disease, as it 
is a hotbed for bacteria, and, as it comes in contact with 
the dishes from which food is eaten, it will be readily 
seen how it may transfer disease germs to those who eat 
from them ; the wiping only changes the evil from the 
dish-cloth to the towel. Always wash the dish-cloth, 
after using, with soapy hot water, then scald, rinse and 
hang out in the sun if possible. 

Wash dish-towels once a day in warm, soapy water, 
scald, then rinse in cold water, and hang out to dry. 

All cleaning cloths should be washed after use. 

All dish-cloths and dish-towels should be hemmed, as 
the lint and threads are apt to obstruct the sink drain. 

Points to Remember. 

To clean silverware (never scour) dip a soft, moist 
cloth in fine whiting, and rub carofully over the article, 
h't the whiting dry, tlu^n rub off with u dry cloth, ajid 
poliHh with a chamois skin. A soft brush (an old tooth- 



THE HOUSE AND ITS CARE. 127 

brush will do) should be used to clean out all ornamental 
work. Egg-stained spoons should be rubbed with salt, 
then washed in water to which a little ammonia has 
been added. 

To scour steel knives either bathbrick, wood-ashes or 
sand-soap may be used. 

Have a special knifeboard, dip a cork in water, then 
into the scouring material, and rub both sides of the 
blade, then wash and dry. Scour steel forks in the 
same way. 

Do not put knife handles in water, as it discolors and 
loosens the handles. 

Do not wet the cogs of a Dover egg-beater. 

Dry all tin and granite ware thoroughly. 

Always use clean hot water for washing the tea and 
coffee pots, without soap. Pans in which fish or onions 
have been cooked should be washed and scalded, then 
filled with water in which put a teaspoon of sal-soda. 
Place them on the top of the stove for one half hour ; 
this will remove all odor from the pans. 

General Information. 
To Clean Wood. 

After the woodwork has been dusted with a soft cloth 
wrung out of tepid water (do not use soap), go over it 
with a soft cloth moistened with sweet oil and turpentine 
(one part turpentine to two parts oil). Rub with the 
grain of the wood, then rub with a soft dry cloth. 
Tables, chairs, etc., may be treated in this manner. 
White stains may be removed by rubbing thoroughly 
with kerosene. 



128 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

To Clean Brass. 

A mixture of rottenstone, sweet oil and turpentine 
(one cupful rottenstone, pounded fine and sifted, half 
cupful turpentine, and enough oil to make a paste), is an 
excellent preparation for cleaning brass. Wash the 
brass in soap and water, wipe dry and polish with the 
paste. Do not use brass preparations on lacquered ware. 

To Remove Paint. 

Rub with a woollen cloth dipped in turpentine. 

To Remove Stains on Basin and Bathtub. 

Rub muriatic acid* on the stained parts and rinse with 
cold water. A little ammonia may be added to the 
rinsing water. 

Acid Stains. 

When an acid is spilled, J)our ammonia over the spot 
at once to restore the color. 

Alkali Stains. 

If alkali, such as ammonia, soda, etc., be spilled sponge 
tlie spot with vinegar or chloroform. 

Stains on Marble. 

A paste made of whiting or chloride of lime should bo 
left on the stain for several hours, then washed and 
wiped dry. 

To Kill Moths. 

Use naptha freely on all stuffed furniture (it will not 

stain the most delicate fabric). Pour the fluid well over 

* This aoid it apt Ut injure the fittingi ; therefore, keroeene ia better 
if the itain is not very bad. 



THE HOUSE AND ITS CARE. 129 

the article (a watering-can may be used for pouring the 
fluid over carpets, furniture, garments, etc.). Windows 
should be opened and the room left to air for several 
hours after naptha has been used. There should be no 
light or fire in the room where naptha is being used, or 
until the fumes have evaporated,as it is highly inflammable 
and must be used with great care. Bedbugs may be 
banished by a free use of naptha. Remember that the 
article must have a bath of naptha and not simply a few 
drops or a sponging. 

To Drive away Ants. 

Put borax, green walnuts, or pennyroyal in the places 
infested. (The oil of pennyroyal may be used when it is 
impossible to get the fresh article.) 

Water-Bugs. 

A free use of borax will rid the house of these pests. 

To Clean Brushes. 

Put enough warm water into a bowl or basin to cover 
the bristles, but not the back of the brush. To each 
quart of water add three tablespoonfuls of ammonia. 
Let the brushes soak in this for about five minutes, then 
move gently through the water several times. Rinse in 
cold water and stand on the side to dry in an open 
window or in the sun. 

Dish-washing. 

As dish-washing is an important duty, aud occupies 
much time, a few hints may make this inevitable task 
less objectionable to young housekeepers.

1. Wear a suitable dress for kitchen work. It should 
be washable, and short enough to clear the floor. 

2. Fasten the hair firmly so that no loose hairs will 
fall into the food. 

3. Before handling food see that the hands are 
thoroughly washed. Clean the nails with a nail cleaner 
or wooden tooth-pick; any little piece of wood may be 
made to serve the purpose. 

4. Wear no rings or bracelets when engaged in 
kitchen work. 

5. Keep a damp towel in a convenient place, on 
which to wipe the hands. Never use the dish-towel, 
apron or handkerchief for wiping the hands. 

6. Wear a dust cap when sweeping. 

7. When tasting food, take up a little of the food on 
the mixing spoon, then put it on the teaspoon, from 
which it should be tasted. 

8. Cultivate systematic order of work. 

9. Before beginning to cook see that the fire is so 
arranged as to be ready when required. 

10. Have all material at hand — flour sifted, measured, 
etc. Arrange spoons and other dishes, that will be

CHAPTER XVI. 

Laundry "Work. 

As the first essential of laundry work is a plentiful 
supply of water, a word concerning that necessary article 
may not be out of place. Pure water is a chemical com- 
pound of hydrogen and oxygen. It has great absorbent 
and solvent powers, therefore pure water is seldom found. 
The first fall of any shower is mixed with the impurities 
of the air; among these may be acids, ammonia and 
carbon in the form of soot and creosote. It is these 
impurities which cause the stain left when rain water 
stands on the window-sill or other finished wood. Rain 
water absorbs more or less carbon dioxide from various 
sources, and soaking into the soil often comes in contact 
with lime, magnesia and other compound. Water satur- 
ated with carbon dioxide will dissolve these substances, 
forming carbonates or other salts which are soluble ; such 
water is known as " hard." 

Water for domestic uses is called either " hard " or 
" soft," according to the amount of salts which it may 
contain. When soap is added to hard water, the new 
compound formed by the union of the lime with the fatty 
acid of the soap is insoluble, and is deposited upon the 
surface of any article with which it comes in contact. It 
is much better to soften hard water by the addition of 
alkalies, ammonia or sal-soda before using for laundry 
purposes than to depend entirely upon soap for cleansing. 

Another important material used in the laundry is soap. 
In purchasing soap, it is well to choose the make of some 

133 



134 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

well-known firm, who have a reputation to lose if their 
products are not good ; and for anything stronger than 
soap, it is better to buy sal-soda and use it knowingly 
than to trust to the various packages so extensively 
advertised. Washing soda should always be dissolved in 
a separate vessel, and added to the water to be used. 
Ammonia may be used, but its too frequent use will 
yellow bleached fabrics. Borax is an effectual cleanser, 
disinfectant and bleacher. It is more expensive than 
ammonia or soda but is the safest alkali to use. Turpen- 
tine is valuable in removing grease ; one tablespoonf ul to 
a quart of water will serve for washing silks and other 
delicate materials. It should never be used in hot water. 
Removing Stains. — All spots and stains should 
be taken out before the clothes are put into the 
FEuiT. general wash to be treated with soap. Fruit 
stains are the most frequent and the most 
indelible, when neglected. Tlie composition of 
fruit juice is readily dissolved by boiling water. 
Stretch the stained part over an eartliern dish 
and pour boiling water upon the stain until it 
disappears. If fruit stains are allowed to remain 
they will retjuire an acid, or in some cases a 
bleaching li(juid like chloride of lime to remove 
wiwB. them. Wine stains should be immediately 
covered with a thick layer of salt. Boiling 
milk may be used for taking out wine or fruit 
MEDiciNB. Htains. Medicine stains usually yield to alcohol. 
Iodine dissolves in other or chloroform. 

oomm, Coffbo, tea and cocoa- stain badly; the latter,

fabric. ThcHO all contain tannin, besides various 



LAUNDRY WORK. 136 

coloring matters, and are " fixed " by soap and 
water. Clear boiling water will often remove 
fresh coffee and tea stains, although it is safer to 
sprinkle the stains with borax and soak in cold 
water first. An alkaline solution of great use 
and convenience is Javelle water. It will remove "^^^^^'^^ 

WATER. 

stains and is a general bleacher. It is composed 
of one pound of sal-soda with one-quarter of a 
pound of chloride of lime in two quarts of 
boiling water. When the substances have dis- 
solved as much as they will, and become cool and 
settled, pour off the clear liquid and bottle it for 
use. Be careful not to allow any of the solid 
portions to pass into the bottle. Use the dregs 
for scouring unpainted woodwork, or to cleanse 
waste pipes. When a spot is found on a white 
tablecloth place under it an inverted plate. 
Apply Javelle water with a soft tooth brush 
(the use of the brush protects the skin and the 
nails). Rub gently till the stain disappears, 
then rinse in clear water and finally in ammonia. 
Blood stains require clear cold or tepid water; blood. 
hot water and soap render the red coloring 
matter less soluble. When the stain is nearly 
gone soap and hot water may be used. Stains 
from meat juice should be treated in the same 
way. When blood is mixed with mucous, as in 
the case of handkerchiefs, it is well to soak the 
stains for some hours in a solution of salt and 
cold water — two tablespoonfuls to a quart. 
Grass stains dissolve in alcohol. If applied *^^'*^' 
immediately, ammonia and water will sometimes 
wash them out. 



136 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

The following methods have proved successful, 
and may be tried where colors are likely to be 
affected by alcohol. Molasses, or a paste of soap 
and baking soda may be spread over the stain 
and left for some hours, or the stain may be 
kept moist in the sunshine until the green color 
has changed to brown, when it will wash out in 

MILDEW, pure water. Mildew requires different treatment 
from any previously considered. Strong soap 
suds, a layer of soft soap and pulverized chalk, 
or one of chalk and salt, are all effective, if in 
addition the moistened cloth be subjected to 
strong sunlight, which kills the plant and 
bleaches the fibre. Javelle water may be tried 
in cases of advanced growth, but success is not 
always assured. Some of the animal and vege- 

oiLs. table oils may be taken out by soap and cold 
water, or dissolved in naphtha, chloroform, ether, 
etc. Some of the vegetable oils are soluble in, 
hot alcohol (care being taken that the tempera- 
ture be not raised to the point of igniting). 
Vaseline stains should be soaked in kerosene 
before water and soap touch them. 

INK. Ink spots on white goods are the same in 

character Jis on colored fabrics. Where the ink 
is an iron compound, tlie stain may be treated 
with oxalic, muriatic or hot tartaric acid, aj)j)lied 
in the same manner as for iron rust stains. No 
definite ruhi can be given, for some inks are 
affected by strong alkalies; otljcrs by acids, while 
iBOK some will dissolve in clear water. Red iron rust 
*""• spots must bo treated with acid. Fill an earthem 



LAUNDRY WORK. 137 

dish two-thirds full of hot water and stretch the 
stained cloth over this. Have two other dishes 
with clear water in one and ammonia water in 
the other. The steam from the hot water will 
furnish the heat and moisture favorable for 
chemical action. Drop a little muriatic acid on 
the stain ; let it remain a moment, then lower 
the cloth into the clear water. Repeat until 
the stain disappears. Rinse carefully in the 
clear water and finally immerse in the ammonia 
water, that any excess of acid may be neutral- 
ized and the fabric protected. Salt and lemon 
juice are often- sufficient for a slight stain. 

Many spots appear upon white goods, which resemble 
those made by iron rust, or the fabrics themselves acquire 
a yellowish tinge. This is the result of the use of blueing 
and soap, where the clothes have been imperfectly rinsed. 
Therefore, if all dirt is removed, and the clothes thor- 
oughly rinsed from all soap or alkalies used in removing 
the dirt, and exposed for a long time to air and sunshine, 
the use of blueing is unnecessary. In cities, where con- 
veniences for drying and bleaching in the sunshine are 
few, a thorough bleaching two or three times a year is a 
necessity ; but in the country it is wiser to abolish all use 
of blueing and let the sun, in its action with moisture 
and the oxygen of the air, keep the clothes white and 
pure. Freezing aids in bleaching, for it retains the 
moisture upon which the sun can act so much longer. 
When clean grass, dew and sunshine are not available, 
use a bleaching powder. Directions for the use of the 
powder usually accompany the can in which it is bought. 
Care must be taken to completely rinse out the acid 



138 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

present in the powder. Grease is more quickly acted 
upon by hot water than by cold, but other organic matter 
is fixed by the hot water. An effective method is to soak 
thoroughly the most soiled portion of the clothes, fold 
these together towards the centre, roll the whole tightly 
and soak in cold water. The water should just cover the 
articles. In tliis way the soap is kept where it is most 
needed, and not washed away before it has done its work. 
When the clothes are unrolled, the dirt may be washed 
out with less rubbing. Too long soaking, when a strong 
soap is used, will weaken the fabric. 

Whether to boil clothes or not, depends largely upon 
the purity of the materials used and the care exercised. 
Many feel that the additional disinfection which boiling 
insures, is an element of cleanness not to be disregarded, 
while others insist tliat boiling yellows the clothes. This 
yellowness may be caused by impure material in the 
soap, the deposit of iron from the water or the boiler; 
the imperfect washing of the clothes, that is, the organic 
matter is not thoroughly removed. The safer process is 
to put the clothes into cold water, with little or no soap, 
let the temperature rise gradually to boiling point and 
remain there for a few minutes. Soap is more readily 
dissolved by liot than by cold water, hence the boiling 
should precede the rinsing. One tablespoon ful of borax 
to every gallon of water jidded to each boilerful, serves as 
a blujicher and disinfocUint. Scalding or pouring boiling 
water over the clothes is not so effectual for their disin- 
foction as boiling, because the temperature is so quickly 
lowered. 

The main points in laundry cleansing seem to be: (1) 
The removal of all stains; (2) Soft water and a good 



LAUNDRY WORK. 139 

quality of soap ; (3) The use of alkalies in solution only; 
(4) Not too hot nor too much water, while the soap is 
acting on the dirt ; (5) Thorough rinsing, that all alkali 
may be removed ; (6) Long exposure to sunlight, the 
best bleacher and disinfectant. 

Washing of Woollens. 

All wool goods require the greatest care in washing. 
The different waters used should be of the same tempera- 
ture, and never too hot to be borne comfortably by the 
hands. Soap should always be used in the form of a 
solution. No soap should be rubbed on the fabric, and 
only a good white soap, free from resin, or a soft potash 
soap is allowable. Make each water slightly soapy, and 
leave a very little in the fabric at the last rinsing, in 
order to furnish a dressing as nearly like the original as 
possible. Ammonia or borax is sometimes used in pref- 
erence to soap. For pure white flannel borax is the 
most- satisfactory, on account of its bleaching quality. 
Only enough of any alkali should be used to make the 
water very soft. 

Wool fibres collect much dust, and should therefore be 
thoroughly brushed or shaken before the fabric is put 
into the water. Woollen fabrics should be cleansed by 
squeezing, and not by rubbing. Wool should not be 
wrung by hand. Either run the fabric smoothly through 
a wringer or squeeze the water out, so that the fibres may 
not become twisted. Woollen articles may be dried more 
quickly by rolling the article tightly in a thick, dry 
towel or sheet, and squeezing the whole till all moisture 
is absorbed. Shake the article thoroughly before placing 



140 DOMESTIC SCIENCK 

to dry. Woollen goods should not be allowed to freeze, 
for the teeth become knotted and hard. 

Colored Cottons. 

Colored cottons should have their colors fixed before 
washing. Salt will set most colors, but the process must 
be repeated at each washing. Alum sets the colors per- 
manently, and at the same time renders the fabric less 
combustible, if used in strong solution after the final 
rinsing. Dish-cloths and dish-towels must be kept clean 
as a matter of health, as well as a necessity for clean, 
bright tableware. The greasy dish-cloth furnishes a 
most favorable field for the growth of germs. It must be 
washed with soap and hot water and dried thoroughly 
each time. All such cloths should form part of the 
weekly wash and receive all the disinfection possible, 
with soap, hot water and long drying in the sunshine 
and open air. Beware of disease-breeding, greasy, damp, 
dish-cloth hung in a warm, dark place. Oven towels, 
soiled with soot, etc., may be soaked over night in just 
enough kerosene to cover, then washed in cold water and 
soap. 

Preparation for Work. 

All clothes, whether washed at home or sent to a 
pul)lic laundry, should bo plainly marked. 

Sort the clothes for the wash, putting each class in a 
pile by itself. Look over each article and remove any 
staiiiH lK;foro putting it into the water. If the white 
clothes are very dirty they should be soaked in cold 
water, to which a little dissolved soda or borax may be 
added, for houio hours. 



LAUNDRY WORK. 141 

Wring the clothes, rubbing the very soiled spots, out 
of the cold water and wash in the following order : 

1. Fine things, such as muslins, lace, collars and cuffs. 

2. Table linen. 

3. Bed and body linen, including handkerchiefs, or 
wash handkerchiefs by themselves. 

4. Prints and colored cottons. 

5. Flannels (using fresh water). In winter flannels 
should be washed first if dried out of doors. 

6. Coarse things, such as kitchen towels, dusters, etc. 

Laundry tubs should be carefully washed and dried. 
Wooden tubs, if kept in a dry place, should be turned 
upside down, and have the bottoms covered with a little 
water. The rubber rollers of the wringer may be kept 
clean and white by rubbing them with a clean cloth and 
a few drops of kerosene (coal oil). 



CHAPTER XVIL 

Emergencies. 

As frequent accidents occur during the performance of 
household duties, a few suggestions as to how slight 
injuries should be treated may prove useful to the 
young housekeeper. 

Cuts. — A cut should be washed with cold water, 
covered with a small pad of cotton, bound up, and left 
alone. Should matter form, the bandage must be taken 
off, the wound bathed with carbolized water, 1-80, and a 
little carbolized vaseline spread on a bit of linen and laid 
over it. The washing and dressing should be repeated 
two or three times a day if there is much discharge. 

Bruises. — A flannel wrung out of very hot water, and 
laid on a bruise, relieves the soreness. 

For bruises on the face, apply ice. Brown paper wet 
in vinegar is an old-fashioned remedy. If the skin is 
broken, treat as a wound, with carbolized water and 
carbolized vaseline. 

Sjnains. — Both hot and cold treatment is recom- 
mended. Immerse the joint in water as hot as can be 
borne. Keep up the temperature by gradually adding 
more hot water. Let it soak for an hour or mon\ Then 
wrap in warm flannel, and surround with hot water bags 
or bottles. 

Stings. — Bathe the part in ammonia, or baking soda 
and water ; wet a cloth in the same, and bind over it 

142 



EMERGENCIES. 143 

Burns. — The best household remedies for burns are 
baking soda and carbolized vaseline. For slight burns 
mix the soda to a paste with water, and spread thickly 
over the part ; cover with linen or old cotton. This may 
be kept wet by squeezing water over it. If shreds of 
clothing adhere to a burn, they should be soaked with 
oil, and not pulled off until softened. If the skin is 
gone, spread carbolized vaseline on linen, and bind on 
the part until the doctor arrives. 

In burns caused by acids, water should not be applied 
to the parts. Cover with dry baking soda. 

If caused by an alkali, such as lye, ammonia, or quick- 
lime, use an acid, as vinegar or lemon juice diluted. 

Poisoning. — For poison ivy, saturate a cloth in a 
solution of baking soda, ammonia and water, and lay 
over the part. 

When poison has been swallowed, the first thing to do 
is to get it out of the stomach. Secondly, to prevent 
what remains from doing more mischief. Give an 
emetic at once. One tablespoonful of salt in a glass of 
tepid water ; one teaspoonful of mustard, or one teaspoon- 
ful of powdered alum in a glass of tepid water. A 
teaspoonful of wine of ipecac, followed by warm water. 
Repeat any of these three or four times if necessary. 
The quantities given are for children ; larger doses may 
be given to adults. It is well to give a dose of castor oil 
after the danger is over, to carry off any remnants of the 
poison that may have lodged in the intestines. 

After a poison has burned the mouth and throat, plenty 
of milk may be given, also flour, arrowroot or cornstarch 
gruel. 



144 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

For drowning and other serious accidents, see Public 
School Physiology. 

Ventilation and Sanitation. 

As pure air is one of the essentials of good health, it 
follows that one of the chief duties of a housekeeper is 
to see that the family supply of this necessary element is 
properly regulated. Very few housekeepers realize the 
importance of ventilation in promoting the general 
health and comfort of the family. The scope of this 
book prevents anything further than a few suggestions 
or a brief outline of the principles underlying these im- 
portant questions. A few general rules are given: (1) 
See that surface water is carried away from all sides by 
either natural or artificial drains, and that the cellar is 
perfectly dry. Have enough windows in the cellar to 
secure plenty of light and air, and see that they are opened 
every day. (2) Have the cellar thoroughly cleaned and 
whitewashed with lime at least once a year, twice if pos- 
sible, in the spring and fall. (3) Keep the coal in a dry 
place. (4) Do not allow decomposed vegetables, or old 
bottles, which may cause unpleasant odors, to accumulate 
in the cellar. Unless there is a special cellar for vege 
tables, where they may be kept at a proper temperature 
and carefully looked after, it is nuich better for the 
housekeeper to purchase in small quantities. Remember 
the ventilation of the cellar is of the greatest importance, 
and should never be neglected. 

One of the most noted authorities in America, on the 
qnestion of ventilation, says: "The thn;e important 
objects are, (1) to provide an abundance of pure aii* in 
every part of the house ; (2) To avoid drafts, either hot 



i 



VENTILATION AND SANITATION. 145 

or cold ; (3) To provide means of escape for foul air and 
odors." As before stated, much of the vigor, comfort and 
happiness of the family depends upon attention to these 
matters. Next to the cellar, we will take the living and 
sleeping rooms, which should be thoroughly aired every 
day, not simply by opening the window a few inches 
at the bottom, or — as in some double or outside windows — 
by a little opening a few inches wide, but- by causing a 
circulation of air in the room, and providing an outlet for 
foul air near the ceiling, which may be done by lowering 
the window from the top. An outlet for foul air is quite 
as important as an inlet for fresh air. 

If there is a skylight at the top of the house, it should 
be kept open a few inches all the time as an outlet for 
impure air ; an attic window will serve the same purpose. 
Have doors and windows so arranged that a draft may 
be made possible when needed to change the air of a 
room quickly, or in airing bedclothes ; two windows being 
of course more desirable. After dressing in the morning 
open the window of the sleeping room, top and bottom ; 
turn back the clothes over one or two chairs; place 
pillows and mattress where they will have a current of 
fresh air ; also open the closet door. Do not allow water 
to remain in a bedroom more than twenty-four hours. 

When a sleeping room has been used for a sewing or 
sitting room during the day, it should be thoroughly 
aired before bedtime. Open the bathroom window fre- 
quently, top and bottom, for a few minutes, so as to 
allow the air to escape out of doors instead of into other 
parts of the house. A nursery, sitting room or school 
room, which has been occupied by a number of people, 
should have the windows open, top and bottom, while the 



146 DOMESTIC SCIENCE, 

occupants are at meals or elsewhere. A room which has 
been occupied as a family sitting room during the evening 
should be aired by; the last member of the family to 
retire, in order to prevent the impure air making its way 
through the house during the night. 

Special attention should be given to kitchen ventila- 
tion. In order to prevent kitchen odors from penetrating 
through the Other parts of the house, it is necessary to 
have an outlet for steam and impure air near the ceiling 
in the kitchen. If windows are placed so as to secure a 
draft, they may be opened at the top only, when they 
will serve the purpose admirably. There should be a 
ventilating flue in all kitchen chimneys. In building a 
house, see that register ventilators are placed in the 
kitchen on different walls, which may be closed in very 
cold weather.

It may be well to emphasize here that animal food is 
more digestible when cooked between 160° and 180° F. 
than at a higher temperature.

People who eat much oatmeal should lead a vigorous 
out-door life. The following analysis of oatmeal is 
given (Letheby) : — 

Nitrogenous matter 12.6 per cent.

(Hutchison). 

The albumen — or the " white " — of an egg is greatly 
altered by cooking. When heated beyond boiling point 
it becomes a very indigestible substance. Eggs cooked 



152 



DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 



at a temperature of about 170° F., leaving the whites 
soft, are easily digested. A raw egg is ordinarily 
digested in one and a half hours, while a baked egg 
requires from two to three hours. Eggs baked in pud- 
dings, or in any other manner, form one of the most 
insoluble varieties of albumen.
