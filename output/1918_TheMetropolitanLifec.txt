THE METROPOLITAN LIFE COOK BOOK 



OUR DAILY MEALS 

We all know that to live we must have food, but we do not all 
realize that we must eat the right kinds of food to be at our best 
and to work efficiently. 

It is true that a great many families are not well nourished, not 
because they do not spend enough money for food, but because 
they do not get enough food value for the money spent. The 
average housewife of to-day finds that it takes a great deal of 
thought and care to make wise choice of food that will best suit 
the needs of her family and yet keep within the amount of money 
that she can afiford to spend. 

Many housewives have increased the cost of their food supply 
through lack of thought in buying. The cost of food is no measure 
of its food value. A high-priced article may have little food value, 
while a low-priced article may have high food value. 

In buying food, to insure that the different kinds of food are 
provided so that the family may be well fed at the lowest cost^ 
one-fourth to one-third of Ihe money should be spent for 
bread or cereal foods. A pint of milk should be allowed for each 
member of the family, and the same amount that is spent for nulk 
should be spent for meat, fish or meat substitutes, and as much 
again should be spent for fruit and vegetables. 

THE DAY'S FOOD 

A man of average size, who is moderately active, is likely to be 
well fed on a diet which includes the following: 

One poimd or a little less of bread or cereal food, such as 
wheat, com, hominy, rye, oatmeal, barley, buckwheat, or rice 
preparations. 

Two ounces or 4 tablespoons of fat, such as butter, oleomar- 
garine, com oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, olive oil, meat drippings, 
etc. 

Two to 3 ounces or 4 to 6 tablespoons of sugar, symp, com 
sjnrup, molasses, maple sugar or syrup, honey, etc. 

About I pound of meat as purchased, poultry, fish, eggs,cheese, 
dried peas, beans, lentils, cowpeas, peanuts, etc. 



4 THE METROPOLITAN LII^E COOK BOOK 

One pint of milk. This may be in the form of a beverage, or 
in milk dishes. 

About I pound of potatoes or root vegetables. 

About I pound fresh vegetables or greens, or fresh fruit in 
season. If fresh fruit is too expensive, dried fruits should be 
substituted. 

SELECTION AND PREPARATION OF FOOD 

It is well to remember the following: 

That it pays to figure carefully how much food is needed. 

That it pays to buy clean food from clean stores. 

That it pays to go to market, buy for cash, and carry home the 
foods that are bought. 

That foods which are plentiful cost little. 

That anjrthing out of season is always expensive. 

That food in package form is more expensive than that in bulk. 

That it is cheaper to buy in large quantities than in small. 

That all foods should be prepared in such a way that all their 
food value may be kept and none of it wasted. 

That a variety of food from day to day, rather than a great 
variety at one meal, will not only keep the cost of food down, but 
also lessen labor, to say nothing of its good effect on the body. 

CARE OF FOOD MATERIALS 

After food has been carefully selected, it is important that it 
should be carefully stored and prepared. It must be kept clean and 
sweet. 

Milk and cream should be kept in clean receptacles, closely 
covered, in a cool place. If purchased in bottles, the bottles 
should be carefully washed and wiped before putting them in the 
refrigerator. The top of milk should be used for the breakfast 
cereal, beverages and puddings. 

Eggs should be washed before usmg. Egg shells may be used 
for clearing coffee or soups. The white of egg clinging to the shell 
does the work. 

Fruits should be washed and wiped dry, and kept in a cool, 
dry place. 

Salad greens should be carefully washed and picked over. The 
outside coarser parts maybe used in making soups and sauces. The 
inner, finer parts should be used for salads. After the salad greens 



MEASUREMENTS 



have been carefully washed, they should be put mto a cheese-cloth 
bag and kept in a refrigerator. 

Meat and fish should be taken out of the paper wrappings 
immediately, as the paper absorbs some of the juice of the meat. 
Meat and fish should be wiped clean with a piece of cloth dipped 
in salted water. The trimmings should not be removed at the 
butcher shop, as they may be used in many ways. Extra fat on 
the meat should be removed before cooking and used as a butter 
substitute. (See page 38.) Fat of meat may be used with vege- 
tables and in suet puddings, in cookies, soups and sauces. Bones 
and left-over meat may be used in making soups, croquettes, meat 
pies and hashes. 

Fish or other food with a strong odor should be kept in a 
covered dish that the odor may not affect other foods. A tin lard 
pail is good for this. Head, tail and bones of fish may be used in 
making fish soups and fish sauces. 

Cheese should be kept in a cool, dry place, wrapped in a clean 
cloth which has been dampened in vinegar. 

Bread should be kept in a covered box or crock. Pieces of 
stale bread are good for toasting and bread puddings. Odd pieces 
of bread should be dried and crimibed, and are kept best when left 
in a paper bag. 

Flour should be kept in closely covered bms. When empty, the 
bins should be washed, scalded and dried in the sim, if possible. 

Cereals should be kept in covered jars. 

Baking-powder should be left in the tin can, closely covered. 

Bottles containing flavoring should be kept closely covered and 
should never be allowed tg stand any length of time uncovered. 
Flavorings should be added to mixtures after cooking, when 
possible. 

MEASUREMENTS 
Much good food is spoiled in cooking. In order to have good 
results in cooking, reliable recipes should be followed accurately. 
Correct measurements are absolutely necessary to insure suc- 
cessful results. 

A FEW GENERAL RULES 
Sift flour, meal, powdered sugar, confectioners' sugar and soda 
before measuring. 



6 THE METROPOLITAN LIFE COOK BOOK 

Mustard and baking-powder are apt to settle in the can, and 
therefore should be stirred to lighten before measuring. 

Salt lumps easily, and the lumps should be broken before 
measuring. 

Dry materials, such as flour, should be measured lightly with 
a scoop or spoon, and not packed hard into the measure. 

Every household should have measuring cups, measuring 
tablespoons and teaspoons on hand. 

All the recipes in this book call for level or flat measurements. 

To measure butter, lard, or any kind of fat, pack solidly into 
the cup or spoon and make level with a knife. If the fat is very 
hard, it may be softened by leaving it in a warm place for awhile, 
or it may be cut into small pieces before measuring it. 

To measure a spoonful of any dry material, dip the spoon into 
it, fill it, lift it and level it with a knife. 

For a half spoonful, divide lengthwise. 

For a quarter of a spoonful, divide the half crosswise. 

For an eighth of a spoonful, divide the quarter diagonally. 

Less than one-eighth of a teaspoonf ul is considered a f ewgrains. 

A cupful of liquid is all the cup will hold. 

A teaspoonful or tablespoonful is all the spoon will hold. 

NoTB. — It will be found that a heaping teaspoonful of dry material, such as baking- 
powder, is the same as 4 or 5 level teaspoonfuls. Housewives who are not in the habit of using 
level measurements are apt to think that recipes calUng for level measuiements require more 
material than those that they have been using.

BREAKFAST DISHES 



BREAKFAST DISHES 

FRUIT CEREAL MIXTURES MILK 



Europeans are in the habit of serving much simpler breakfasts than 
Americans. The breakfast should be filling and satisfying to start the 
day well. A few well-cooked dishes served at one time always make a 
more wholesome meal than when a great variety is served. 

It is a good plan to serve some kind of fruit for breakfast. This may be 
fresh fruit, when it is in season and plentiful and not too expensive, or it 
may be dried fruit, which has been stewed. 

Mildly acid fresh fruit in good condition should be served raw. 

Dried fruit may be cooked alone or with the breakfast cereal. 

DIRECTIONS FOR COOKING DRIED FRUIT 

Wash fruit carefully. 

Soak in cold water to cover overnight. 

Drain fruit, heat the water in which it has been soaked to boiling point, 
add the soaked fruit, and let simmer slowly until fruit is plump and soft. 
A little sugar or syrup may be added if more sweetening is desired. 

CEREALS 

Cereals furnish one of the most important foods we have. Nature 
provides some kind of a cereal in almost every country. From the oats and 
rye of the Northern countries to the rice of the Southern countries. Man 
depends on it for his daily bread. Cereal foods include the kernels of corn, 
oats, rye, rice, wheat, barley, etc., the breakfast foods, meals and flours 
made from them, or bread, crackers, muffins, cakes or pastry, which are 
rich in cereal products. Cereals are used in one form or another, such as 
in mushes, gruels, macaroni, bread mixtures and all batters and doughs 
in every home. As a rule, the more cereal food used the cheaper the diet. 

Cereal mush, or other cereal dishes, with milk for breakfast, furnishes 
a meal full of food value. It is a good plan to have several different kinds 
of cereal preparations on hand, such as those made from wheat, oat, com, 
rye, barley and rice, that there may be a change from day to day. Corn and 
oat preparations furnish particularly good winter foods, as they are rich in 
fat and are therefore valuable heat producers. Cornmeal, oatmeal, rice 
and hominy grits are cheaper than the "ready-to-eat" breakfast foods. 

As all cereals are rich in starch, they should be thoroughly cooked. 
The cracked cereals should be cooked twelve hours, while the steamed 
and rolled preparations require only one-half hour or more, as they are 
partly cooked at the factory. 

Cereals when cooked should be stiff enough so that they can be chewed, 
that the saliva of the mouth may be thoroughly mixed with the cooked starch. 



8 THE METROPOLITAN LIFE COOK BOOK 

GENERAL RULES FOR COOKING CEREALS 

Fill the lower part of a double boiler | full of water. Place over the 
fire. Measure the water needed for the cereal and pour it into the top 
of the double boiler. Place over the fire, and when the water begins to boil, 
add the salt and the cereal slowly and let boil over the fire 10 minutes. 
Place over the lower part of the double boiler containing water, cover and 
let steam until ready to serve. If more water is useded during cooking, 
add boiling water. 

(Instead of double boiler, two saucepans may be used, one a trifle larger 
than the other, the larger one serving as the lower part of the double boiler.) 

(By using the fireless cooker, the cereal can be boiled 10 minuses over 
the fire in the evening, and then cooked overnight in the fireless cooker.) 

CORNMEAL MUSH 
1| cups commeal 2 teaspoons salt 6 cups water 

Heat water to boiling point, add salt and the cornmeal slowly, stirring 
while adding. Boil directly over the fire 10 minutes, then cook over boiling 
water from 1 to 3 hours or overnight. Half milk and half water may be used. 

OATMEAL MUSH 
2| cups rolled oats 2^ teaspoons salt 6 cups boiling water 

Add the salt to the boiling water, stir in the rolled oats slowly and boil 10 
minutes directly over the fire. Cook over boiling water one-half hour or more. 

STEAMED RICE 
1 cup rice I teaspoon salt 1 qt. boiling water or scalded milk 

Put water and salt in top of double boiler, add gradually the well-washed 
rice, stirring with a fork to prevent rice sticking to the boiler. Boil 5 minutes. 
Place over under part of double boiler and steam 45 minutes. Uncover that 
steam may escape. 

WHAT TO DO WITH LEFT-OVER CEREALS 

Fill molds with cereal mush packed tightly and let stand until cold 
and firm, slice and brown in fat. Serve with syrup. Cornmeal mush is 
very good for this. 

Cheese sauce, tomato sauce or creamed fish, meat or eggs may be 
served on slices of fried mush. 

JVIix left-over mush with cheese, finely-chopped meat or fish, slightly 
beaten egg, and seasonings; shape into cakes and brown in fat, and serve 
with a sauce. 

Mix cereal mush with salt and pepper, shape into cakes, brush over 
with melted fat, place a small Hamburger steak on top, and bake in a moder- 
ately hot oven until nicely browned. Oatmeal mush is particularly good. 

Mix cereal mush with fruit, mold and chill. Serve with cream or a 
fruit sauce" as a dessert. 

Arrange cereal mush in layers with sweetened fruit in well-greased 
baking dish and bake until nicely browned on top. Serve with fruit sauce 
or cream as a dessert. 



TOAST 



Add cereal mush to yeast bread mixtures or quick bread mixtures, 
several recipes of which will be found in this book. 

Add cereal mush to meat loaf mixtures in place of bread crumbs, or both 
may be added. 

Add cereal mush to croquette mixtures. 

Boiled rice may be served with meat, or it may be served with cheese 
sauce as a supper dish, or it may be served with cream or a little sweetened 
fruit as a dessert. 



TOAST 

Toast is considered easy of digestion and is always palatable. 

How to Make Toast. — Cut stale bread into J-inch slices, put slices in a 
wire toaster, lock toaster and hold over or under the heat, holding it some 
distance from the fire that it may dry gradually, and then brown as desired. 
Toast, if piled compactly and allowed to stand, soon becomes moist. It 
should be served as soon after toasting as possible. 

CREAM TOAST 
Dip 8 slices of toast into the cream sauce. Pour remaining sauce on 
the pieces of toast and serve hot. 

CREAM OR WHITE SAUCE 

Rule 1 

1 pint scalded milk 2^ tablespoons water 1 tablespoon butter 

2 1 tablespoons flour j teaspoon salt or fat 

Mix the flour and the water until smooth; add a little more cold water 
to make it thin enough to pour; add the flour mixture gradually to the scalded 
milk, stirring constantly until thickened. Boil 5 minutes, if cooked directly 
over the fire; 20 minutes if cooked in double boiler. Add the salt and butter. 

Rule 2 
Melt the fat, when 2 tablespoons should be used ; add the flour, mixed 
with the salt, and stir until mixed. Add gradually the scalded milk, stirring 
all the time until all is added. Cook until smooth and thickened. 

Note. — Chipped beef, previously soaked in hot water, left-over cooked meat cut into 
small pieces, flaked fish, oysters, finely-chopped cheese, chopped hard-cooked eggs or cooked 
vegetables may be added to the sauce, seasoned, heated and served on the toast. 

FRENCH TOAST 

1 egg slightly beaten Slices of bread 1 cup sweet milk 

I teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons sugar or syrup Fat to grease the griddle 

Add the salt, sugar and milk to the slightly beaten egg, dip the pieces 
of bread into the egg mixture. Cook the soaked slices of bread on a well- 
greased griddle; brown on one side, turn and brown on the other. Serve 
with maple syrup or jelly. Served with stev ed fruit, makes a good dessert.

CEREAL FLOUR AND MEAL MIXTURES 

BATTERS AND DOUGHS 



From cereals we have flour and meals which can be used in^a number 
of ways to make wholesome and palatable dishes. Flour is used in batter 
and dough mixtures, and as mixtures of flours and batters alone when cooked 
would be hard and difficult of digestion, different leavens, such as baking- 
powder, soda and yeast, are used to make them light. 

Mixtures of flour or meal and liquid are called batters or doughs according 
to the quantity of liquid used. 

The dry ingredients include flour, meal, sugar, salt, spices, and baking- 
powder, soda, etc. Mixed flour mixtures furnish better body-building material 
than those made from one grain alone. 

Fats called "shortening," added to make the mixture tender. Include 
butter, oleomargarine, nut margarine, drippings, lard, chicken fat or vegetable 
oils. (See directions for rendering fat to be used for shortening, page 38.) 

The liquids used in batters and doughs are water, milk, whey, molasses, 
syrups, coffee, eggs, etc. Sour milk may be used in recipes calling for sweet 
milk, when I teaspoon soda should be added for each cup of sour milk, and 
for each | teaspoon soda added, 2 teaspoons less baking-powder is required. 

Batters are made "light" or "porous" by the introduction of a gas which 
is expanded by the heat during cooking. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING AND COOKING 
GRIDDLE CAKES 

Sift flour before measuring. 

Put flour by spoonfuls into the measure and do not press or shake down. 

Measure, mix and sift dry ingredients. 

Measure the liquid ingredients and add to the dry ingredients. 

Mix thoroughly and add the melted fat. 

Use a frying-pan or griddle. 

Heat the pan hot without burning the cake. 

Grease the griddle if necessary. (A soap-stone or aluminum griddle 
must never be greased.) 

Let the fat begin to smoke before cooking the cakes. 

Pour the mixture from the tip of the spoon; cook on one side; when 
puffed full of bubbles and cooked on the edges, turn and cook on other side. 

If large bubbles form at once on the top of the cakes, the griddle is too hot. 

If the top of the cake stiffens before the under side is cooked, the griddle 
is not hot enough. 

Never turn a cake twice. 

Remove scraps and wipe pan after each set of cakes is cooked. 

Grease pan and repeat. 

Serve griddle cakes as soon as cooked.

BREAD AND BREAD MAKING 19 



BREAD AND BREAD MAKING 

In most households bread is the chief cereal food served, and is often 
called the "Staff of Life." It is most important that the bread should be 
well made, light and crusty, that it may be wholesome, nutritious and palatable. 

When well made it is a food of which we do not tire. Soggy bread forms 
tough lumps which the digestive organs cannot work upon as they should, 
and when such bread is eaten daily it may do serious harm. 

A good loaf of bread should be light, the cavities of uniform size and 
evenly distributed throughout the loaf. The loaf should be small, rather 
than large, that it may be thoroughly baked, the crust should be a golden 
brown, and either soft or crisp, but not tough. 



INGREDIENTS NEEDED FOR BREAD MAKING 
The necessary ingredients for bread making are flour, liquid and yealt. 

LIQUIDS USED 
The liquids used may be water, rice water, potato water, whey milk or 
milk and water. Starchy water, such as potato or rice water, makes a more 
moist loaf. Milk changes the flavor of the loaf, makes it richer in food 
value and a more tender crumb and crust. Usually one cup of liquid is 
allowed for each loaf of bread the size of a brick loaf pan. 

FLOUR 

White flour is the most important in bread making, with rye flour second. 
When wheat is ground into a fine flour, it has the power of stretching and 
expanding, making it ideal for bread making. It holds the air and carbon 
dioxide, and hardens on baking, forming the framework of the loaf of bread. 

Corn and oats lack this quality, and therefore they are combined with 
white flour for baking purposes. Rye flour may be used alone or with white 
flour in bread making. 

Americans have formed the habit of eating almost exclusively bread 
made with white flour alone, not realizing that other breads, such as rye, 
rye meal, whole wheat, whole cornmeal and oatmeal, are very good to eat 
and richer in food value. Bread made with white flour alone does not contain 
the lime or other mineral salts necessary to build up bones and teeth for 
growing children. The coarser cereals also relieve constipation. 

The present emergency demands that we use less wheat, and it is a 
good lesson for us to learn, as it is in the interest of health that we eat 
bread made with mixed cereals. 

The quantity of flour used, together with the handling of the ingredients, 
has much to do with the quality of the bread. For a firm, fine-grained loaf 
of bread, 3 to 4 times as much flour as liquid is used. For a coarse grain, 
from 2 1 to 3 times as much flour as liquid is used. 



20 THE METROPOIvlTAN LIFE COOK BOOK 



From I to equal measures of other cereal flours may be added to the 
wheat flour. Mashed potatoes, boiled rice or left-over cereal mush may be 
used to good advantage in this way. 

FLAVORS 
, Salt is used in bread making to give flavor, usually allowing | teaspoon salt 
to a cup of liquid, or for 1 loaf. 

Sugar, syrup or molasses is added to give flavor and hasten th"e rising, 
allowing 1 or 2 tablespoons to each cup of liquid. Fat, such as butter, lard, 
oleomargarine, nut-nargarine, suet, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, or corn oil, 
is added to the loaf to make the loaf richer and more tender, allowing 1 table- 
spoon to each cup of liquid. 

YEAST 

Compressed, dry or liquid yeast is used to make bread light. In any 
form there is a collection of yeast plants massed together in a way that they 
will keep for some time. The strength of yeast depends upon the care with 
which it is made and preserved. Liquid yeasts are apt to be full of bacteria 
\^(|Iich will cause bread to sour. Every yeast cake contains millions of tiny 
yeast plants. 

Air, warmth, moisture and a nitrogenous soil are necessary for their 
growth. All these conditions are provided when they are mixed with flour 
and liquid. 

Heat will kill the yeast plants, while cold checks their growth, therefore 
in bread making the yeast mixture should never come in contact with anything 
hot until baking time, or be exposed to cold unless it is desirable to stop the 
rising for awhile. The amount of yeast used depends on the length of time 
desired for the process. 

One yeast cake to a quart of liquid, or for 4 loaves of bread, is used if 
bread is started in the morning. One yeast cake to 2 quarts of liquid or 8 
loaves of bread, is used if allowed to rise overnight. 

Because of the high price of yeast, it may be a good plan to make liquid 
yeast when yeast mixtures are prepared regularly at home. 

RECIPE FOR LIQUID YEA^T 
Poor medium-sized potatoes, pared and boiled in 1 quart water. Mash 
the potatoes and add 2 teaspoons salt, 3 tablespoons sugar and the water in 
which the potatoes were boiled. Cool and add 1 dry yeast cake or 1 compressed 
yeast cake which has been mixed with I cup lukewarm water. Pour into a 
stone or glass jar, cover and let stand in a warm place 3 hours or more. Each 
time mixture reaches top of jar, stir down; do this until it stops working. 
Cover and put in a cool place. Use I cup liquid yeast in place of 1 yeast 
cake. Continue to use until there is but | cup left, then prepare according 
to above recipe, using I cup in place of 1 yeast cake in starting the new batch. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR BREAD MAKING 

First: Scald the liquids, add the salt, sugar and fat; cool. 

Second : Mix the yeast with i cup lukewarm liquid, using yeast according 



BREAD AND BREAD MAKING 



to the time desired for the process. If dry yeast is used, mix it with a lij;!: 
lukewarm liquid and flour several hours before adding it to the sponge. 

Third : Add the yeast mixture to the lukewarm liquid mixture. 

Fourth: Sift the flour, allowing 3 to 4 cups for each loaf. Add § of the 
flour to the liquid mixture and beat thoroughly. Add more flour to make 
a dough, using a knife, until, when touched with the finger, the dough does 
not stick to the finger. A bread mixer is a time and labor saver. Turn dough 
onto a sHghtly floured board; knead by pushing the dough into the palms of 
the hands and drawing it forward with the fingers. Use as little flour as 
possible on board and hands while kneading. Continue until the dough is 
smooth and elastic- to the touch.. It takes from 15 to 20 minutes to knead 
with the hands and about 3 minutes in the bread mixer. Thorough kneading 
makes fine-grained bread. 

Fifth: Put dough in a bowl, brush over with milk, cover closely, put in 
a warm (not hot) place and let rise to double its bulk. This may be over- 
night or in the daytime, depending on the quantity of yeast used. 

Sixth: Knead again, shaping into loaves; divide dough into as many 
portions as there are cups of liquid in the mixture. Place in pans, brush 
over with skimmed milk or melted fat. 

Seventh : Cover and let rise in a warm place to double their bulk. 

Eighth: Bake loaves from 50 to 60 minutes in a moderately hot oven. 

Ninth : Cool loaves on a rack or place them so the air can circulate freely 
around the loaf.

BREAD THAT REQUIRES NO KNEADING 

In making bread that requires no kneading general rules for mixing 
given for kneaded bread should be follov/ed, and the mixture beaten thoroughly 
instead of kneaded. It should be beaten the second time to distribute the 
gas bubbles evenly, and to make a fine-grained loaf. Well-greased pans 
should be half filled with the mixture. 

The mixture should rise in the pan until double its bulk and no more, 
and then be baked in a hot oven at least 45 miniites or until brown on all 
sides, and until a hollow sound can be produced when the loaf is tapped with 
the finger. 

When baked, loaves should be placed so that air can circulate freely 
around them until cooled. They should be put away unwrapped in a tin 
box or stone jar.

SOUPS 



25 



SOUPS 

Left-overs of meat, fish, vegetables and cereals can be used advan- 
tageously in making soups. The heavy vegetable pulp soups, such as split 
pea or bean soup, the cream of vegetable soups and the milk chowders are 
rich in food value. The thin meat stocks are valuable chiefly as appetizers. 
The plain vegetable soups contain the food value of the vegetables they 
contain. If cereals are added, it increases the food value. 

Meat stock is water in which meat and meat bones have been cooked. 
When dark meat is used, it is called brown stock; when light meat is used, 
it is called white stock. Vegetable stock is water in which vegetables have 
been cooked.

cloth. Cut the meat into small pieces, put into the kettle with the carrot, 
onion and water. Heat gradually to boiling point and cook until meat is 
tender, strain and remove any fat. Reheat to boiling point, add the rice or 
barley and cook until the rice or barley is soft. The meat should not be 
thrown away, but used in stews, croquettes or meat cakes. If combined 
with a little broth, the flavor is restored.

to reduce the cost of living. Fish contains the same food value as meat 
at a much smaller cost, and furnishes a food that not only tastes good, but 
is easily digested. 

Whitefish, haddock, halibut, cod, flounder, smelts, perch, pickerel, 
sunfish and crappies belong to the white-fleshed family. Salmon, shad, 
lake trout, butterfish and herring belong to the red-fleshed family. 

As the white-fleshed fish is considered more easy of digestion than the 
red-fleshed, it should be selected for invalids, convalescents or those suffering 
from weak digestion. 

Fish should be eaten while fresh and in season. Stale fish is poisonous, 
so great care should be used in its selection. Fish contains albumen, and 
as albumen (which is like the white of egg) clots at a low temperature, it 
should be cooked at a temperature below boiling point of water. 

Local fish should be used as much as possible. Find out all the kinds 
of fish that can be obtained in your locahty. 

HOW TO SELECT FRESH FISH 

Select a fish that has bright eyes and gills, shiny scales, firm flesh, and 
is free from a disagreeable odor. 

HOW TO CLEAN FISH 

Remove the scales by drawing a knife over the fish, beginning at the 
tail and working toward the head. 

Wipe the fish inside and outside with a cloth wet in cold, salted water, 
then wipe with a clean dry cloth kept for the purpose. Head and tail may 
or may not be taken off, according to the manner of cooking. "^ 

METHODS OF COOKING FISH 

Broiling, baking and steaming are the best methods for cooking fish. 

Fish suitable for broiling are: Split mackerel, white fish, cod, shad, 
trout, etc., sliced halibut and salmon, white smelts and small fish. To broil — 0^ 
brush with melted fat, sprinkle with flour, salt and pepper, and cook over a 
flame or clear fire. 

Fish suitable for baking whole ar^: Whitefish, cod, haddock, small salmon, 
shad. Follow directions for baked fish. 

Fish suitable for boiling are: Salmon, halibut, cod, haddock, trout, 
etc. Cook in piece of cheese-cloth. Add 1 tablespoon vinegar and 1 table- 
spoon salt to each quart of water. 

Fish suitable for frying are the white-fleshed. Cook in deep fat or saute 
in a little fat in a frying pan.

TEST FOR COOKING FISH 

When'the'fish can be easily separated from the bone, the fish is sufTiciently 
cooked. 

FISH— BAKED, WITH STUFFING 

Select a fish weighing from 2i to 4 pounds. Bake with or without 
stuffing. 

STUFFING 
1 cup crumbs (bread or | teaspoon salt Few drops onion juice, 

crackers, or half | teaspoon celery salt if liked 

and half) | teaspoon pepper | cup water 

I cup melted fat 

Mix ingredients in order given. If a dry filling is desired, the water 
may be omitted. Three tablespoons catsup, chopped parsley, capers, pickles, 
or oysters may be added. Clean and wipe the fish. Rub the inside with salt. 
Fill with stuffing and sew together. Cut diagonal gashes 1 5 inches apart 
on both sides of the fish and place a strip of bacon or salt pork fat in each 
gash. Brush with melted fat, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Dredge with 
flour, tie in the shape of a letter "S" and bake on a baking sheet or strips 
of cotton cloth (so that it may be easily removed from the pan in a dripping 
pan). When the flour is browned, baste the fish once in 10 minutes. Cook 
until the flesh is firm and separates easily from the bone. 

SALMON STEAKS— STUFFED 
Buy slices of salmon ^-inch in thickness. Arrange half the number of 
slices in a baking pan, on thin slices or strips of salt pork fat. Cover with a 
well-seasoned, bread-crumb stuffing. Cover with remaining slices of salmon. 
Sprinkle with flour, salt and pepper. Surround with left-over boiled potatoes, 
cut into fourths lengthwise. Arrange strips of salt pork fat on top and bake 
in a moderately hot oven about 30 minutes or until done. Garnish with 
lemon and parsley, 

BROILED TROUT OR OTHER FISH 
Clean trout; wipe dry. Cut into suitable pieces for serving. Dip 
pieces in melted fat and broil over a clear fire for about 12 minutes. Other

MEAT 31 



MEAT 

In the average household there is perhaps no other food that calls for 
more thought in selection and preparation than meat. In no other country 
has meat been used so generously as in America. 

With the present high cost of meat, American housewives are buying 
less meat than formerly, and are using what they buy more carefully than ever 
before. 

The tough cuts of meat, usually the cheaper cuts, are located where 
there is motion, such as those obtained from the neck and Hmbs; while 
the tender cuts are located where there is little motion, such as those along 
the back bone. The meat part from all the cuts from the same animal con- 
tain the same food value, but there is more waste, such as bone and gristle, 
to some cuts, and this should be considered in buying. 

To reduce the meat bill, make a little meat go a long way by preparing 
meat combination dishes, such as stews, meat loaves, meat pies, stuffed 
roasts, beef a la mode, etc. Make good meat gravies. "Spread the meat 
flavor." Only a little meat is needed to give flavor to a whole dish. 

SELECTION OF MEAT 

Meat should be uniform in color, the flesh firm and elastic to the touch. 

The flesh of beef should be of a bright red color and intermingled with 
fat that is yellowish. 

Mutton siiould be dull red in color, and the fat white. 

Lamb and veal should be lighter in color and flesh less firm than beef. 

Meat should be removed from the paper as soon as it is received from mar- 
ket and should be kept in a cool place. Always wipe meat with a damp cloth. 

Beef ranks first in nutritive value, v/ith mutton a close second. 

HOW TO PREPARE MEAT STEWS 

Stewing is cooking slowly, a long time, in a small quantity of water. 
Cut the meat into rather small pieces; divide it into two portions; add one 
portion to cold water and heat slowly to boiling point. Meanwhile brown 
the other portion in a Httle fat in a pan. Then add it to the water and meat. 
The whole should be cooked slowly for three hours or until the meat is 
tender. Add vegetables the last hour of cooking. 

Beef, mutton, lamb or veal may be used, selecting the tough pieces, 
such as the neck, shoulder, lower part of round, aitch bone, etc. Pieces of 
cold cooked meat may be added to the stew. 

The pieces of meat are usually dredged with flour before they are 
browned. This gives color to the stew, a rich flavor, and thickens the gravy. 

Onions, carrots, turnips, parsnips and potatoes are the vegetables 
commonly used in stews. ^ Tomatoes, string beans and green peas are some- 
times used. The vegetables should be cut into l-inch cubes, J-inch slices 
or strips, and added the last hour of cooking. The potatoes, however, should 
be parboiled 5 minutes, then added to the stew, allowing 20 minutes for 



THE METROPOLITAN LIFE COOK BOOK 



cooking. The usual seasonings are salt and pepper. Sweet herbs, parsley, 
a bit of bay leaf, a few cloves, celery salt, or catsup may be added for variety. 

Dumplings or Boiled Rice are often served with stew. When cooking 
dumplings, they should be placed so that they will rest on the meat and 
vegetables. Meat stew may be served on slices of Fried Mush. 

MEAT PIE 
Fill baking dish f full with stew; cover with mashed potato, boiled rice, 
biscuit dough or cereal mush and bake until nicely browned on top. 

NEW ENGLAND BOILED DINNER 
4 pounds corned beef 6 small carrots or 3 6 medium-sized pota- 
(i small beets large ones toes 

1 small cabbage 2 small French turnips 6 medium-sizfed onions 

cut in thirds 6 small parsnips 

Wash the meat quickly in cold water. If it is very salt, soak it about 
30 minutes in cold water. Simmer meat in a kettle, containing enough 
boiHng water to cover, from three to five hours, or until the meat is tender. 
Wash and scrape the vegetables, leave the beets, carrots, turnips and parsnips 
whole, or quartered if preferred. Cut the cabbage into quarters. When 
meat is tender, remove from kettle, and, two hours before dinnertime, add 
the carrots, afterward the turnips and the cabbage. Thirty minutes before 
dinnertime, add the parsnips and potatoes and onions. The beets should 
be cooked separately. Reheat the meat with the vegetables. Serve meat 
and vegetables arranged attractively on a large platter. 

HOW TO BROIL MEAT 

Broiling is cooking by direct exposure to heat, over hot coals or over a 
flame (gas flame). . 

Cooking with little or no fat in a hot frying pan is called "oan-broiling." 
To make broiled meat juicy, turn often while cooking. 

TO BROIL STEAKS OR CHOPS 

Wipe meat with a damp cloth and trim off superfluous fat. Rub the wire 
broiler with a little of the fat, place the meat in broiler and broil over a clear 
fire, turning every 10 seconds for the first minute. After the first minute, 
turn occasionally until well cooked on both sides, or cook in a little fat in a 
frying pan, turning over. Season to taste. Pork chops must be very well 
done. 

PAN-BROILED HAMBURGER STEAK 

Chop finely one pound lean raw beef; season highly with salt, pepper 
and a few drops of onion juice. Add J cup milk gradually; knead dough 
until spongy and shape into cakes. Heat a frying pan, rub with the fat of 
meat and pan-broil the steaks. Turn cakes often during the cooking. 

One cup left-over oatmeal mush may be added to the mixture and is very 
good. Try shaping oatmeal mush into cakes, brush with melted fat; shape 
Hamburger steak mixture into cakes, place on top of oatmeal cakes. Bake in 
the oven until_cooked and nicely browned. 



MEAT 33 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR BRAISING 

The rump, top, round, blade, chuck, ribs, cross ribs cuts and flank stuffed 
are all good braised. Beef, mutton or veal. 

To braise meat, wipe meat, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dredge with 
flour, and, if a lean piece of meat is used, lard previous to seasoning. Brown 
the meat on all sides in a little fat in a Scotch kettle or roasting pan. Then 
cover bottom of pan with hot water or meat stock. Then cover closely and 
cook slowly in the oven, on top of the range or in a fireless cooker two hours. 
Add vegetables, such as onion, carrot, turnips, cut into strips, balls or slices, 
and continue cooking until meat and vegetables are tender. 

BEEF A LA MODE 
Insert 12 large strips of salt pork fat or piece of suet into a 4-pound 
piece of round beef. Season with salt and pepper, dredge with flour. 
Put a piece of suet in a hot pan, brown the meat on all sides in this. Put 
in kettle with vegetables and water, according to recipe for beef stew. Cover 
closely and cook slowly 4 or 5 hours in oven or top of range. 

POT-ROAST 

When beef is similarly prepared (without the strips of fat and vegetables) 
and cooked in a smaller amount of water, it is called pot-roast. 

Two cups brown sugar, 1 cup vinegar and 1 cup soaked prunes added 
the last 2 hour of cooking provides a nice change. 

MEAT EN CASSEROLE 
Cut 2 pounds of meat into suitable pieces for serving. Sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, dredge with flour. Brown meat in a little fat in a frying pan. 
Put browned pieces of meat in casserole dish; add 1 carrot cut into cubes, 
1 cupful stewed and strained tomatoes. Cover closely and cook 15 minutes. 
Add 5 cupful peeled onions and 1 cupful potato balls, and continue cooking 
until meat and vegetables are tender. The casserole should be closely 
covered that the steam may be retained. Serve with boiled rice. 

MEAT ROLL 

Flank steak, or 1 pound 2 or 3 small pieces of I cup carrot, cubed 
of thinly cut round suet 2 cups stock or water 

^ steak 2 onions Bread stuffing 

Beef, mutton or veal may be used. Wipe meat, trim edges, pound on 
both sides, spread with stuffing, roll and tie. Sprinkle the roll with salt and 
pepper, dredge with flour, and brown on all sides in hot drippings and lay it 
on the onion and carrot in a pan with the suet on top. Pour the water or 
stock into the pan. Cover tightly and cook slowly in the oven or on top of the 
stove. For round steak, cook slowly, covered, for I hour or more in 8 
moderate oven, then uncover and cook an additional ^ hour. For flank steak 
cook slowly, covered, for 3 hours or more in a moderate oven, then uncover 
last I hour. Serve with brown gravy made by thickening the liquid in the 
pan. Individual rolls may be made.

ROASTING 
GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

Wipe the meat with a damp cloth. Dredge the surface with flour, salt 
and pepper. Put pieces of fat on the meat and in the pan (melted fat may be 
used and rubbed over the surface). Place meat on a rack in the pan. Put 
into a hot oven. The heat of the oven should be intense at first to sear the 
surface (about 10 minutes), and then the heat should be reduced and water 
added to cover bottom of pan. The meat should either be covered closely 
or basted often with equal parts of fat drippings and water. After the last 
basting, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place meat on a hot platter and 
garnish. 

GRAVY 

Pour fat from pan; allow 2 tablespoons of fat to 3 tablespoons of flour

3s The metropolitan life cook book: 



FAT 

Save every scrap of fat that comes with the meat and render it. 

TO RENDER FAT TO USE FOR COOKING 

Fat connected with tissue must be "tried out." The fat should be finely 
chopped and heated over water and strained. Done in this way there is no 
danger of burning and a white fat is obtained. If the fat has a strong odor, 
soaking it in salted water before rendering and adding a pinch of soda during 
rendering will remove it. 

CLARIFYING FAT 

To lessen characteristic flavors that are disliked by many, add to the 
rendered fat at least an equal amount of water and boil the mixture for an 
hour. Allow the fat to harden in a cake on top, pour off the water and heat 
the fat gently to drive off the water. This increases its keeping qualities. 
If the flavor is very strong, heating the fat with whole or skimmed milk (1 cup 
to 2 pounds of fat) will prove a more effectual method than the addition of 
water. Strain through the cloth to remove all bits of foreign matter. 

CRACKLINGS 
The bits of tissue left after rendering the fat may be used for shortening 
such flour mixtures as corncake and gingerbread — J cup being equal to about 
2 tablespoons of butter. If chopped sweet apple is added to corncake and 
a few raisins to gingerbread, the "chewy" bits of tissue are not noticed. 

SOFTENING HARD FATS 
To make hard fats softer for such uses as cake making, they may be 
mixed with softer fats — such as, 2 parts mutton or beef fat with 1 part lard 
or 3 parts mutton or beef fat with 1 part cottonseed oil. Melt the fats 
together and stir while melting. Stir occasionally. 

SAVORY FAT 
Strongly flavored fats, such as bacon, ham, or mutton, should be used. 
Heat the fat over a slow fire for about an hour with the desired seasoning — 
the amount and kind depending upon individual taste. Some of the seasonings 
that may be used are onion, sour apple, whole thyme, marjoram, savory and 
bayleaf. Savory fat may be used for warming up potato, seasoning vegetables, 
browning fish, seasoning left-over meats, and in many other ways. 

USES OF CLARIFIED FATS 

In substituting other fats for butter as shortening, a slightly smaller 
amount may be used and salt must be added. If the somewhat pronounced 
flavors of such fats as mutton or beef are objectionable, a little more flavoring 
— especially chocolate and spices — may be added. 

Chicken or- bacon fat is good for spreading sandwiches and in making 
pastry. A perfectly satisfactory fat for deep fat frying may consist of a mixture 
of any clarified fats, such as beef, mutton, lard and bacon, provided there is 
not an overabundance of the harder fats. 



MEAT SUBSTITUTES 39 



MEAT SUBSTITUTES 



EGGS 

Eggs are cheaper than meat. A fresh egg has a thick, rough shell. 
Nine medium-sized eggs, as a rule, weigh a pound. Eggs and egg dishes 
should be cooked at a low temperature. 

A 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR COOKING EGGS 

Have ready a saucepan containing boiling water. A general rule is 
to allow 1 pint of water to 2 eggs, and an extra cupful for each additional 
egg. Place the eggs in the water with a spoon and cover the saucepan. 
For hard-cooked eggs, let them stand on the back of the range or over a low 
flame from 40 to 45 minutes. For soft-cooked eggs, place the eggs in a 
saucepan containing boiling water. Let them stand on back of range or 
over a low flame from 8 to 10 minutes. 

POACHED EGGS 
Prepare a slice of buttered toast for each egg, and keep It hot. Have 
ready a shallow greased pan containing boiling, salted water to cover the 
eggs. Break each egg separately into a saucer and slip it gently into the 
water, being careful that water does not reach the boiling point. (If eggs 
are slipped into muffin rings in the water, the shape will be better.) Cook 
until the white is firm and a film forms over the top of the yolk. Remove 
the eggs from the water with a skimmer or griddle-cake turner. Drain,

of which there are brown, red and gray ones. The soy bean is richer in fat 
and fiesh-building material than any of the other beans. Beans as a whole 
contain about the same food value, and the housewife who wishes to get the 
most food value for the money will do well in selecting the kind that sells 
at the lowest cost, provided they are in good condition. 

Recipes given for one kind of beans may be used for any one of the 
others with just as good results.

VEGETABLES 43 



VEGETABLES 

Vegetables should be used generously in our daily meals. They are 
chiefly valuable for the pure water and mineral matter they contain, which 
act as a tonic in our bodies. They contain cellulose or wood fiber, which 
stimulates the digestive organs to carry on their work. The cellulose stimu- 
lates the intestines so that their contents are kept constantly moving. Some 
vegetables contain starch, sugar and other substances. 

Peas, beans and lentils will take the place of meat. Spinach is rich 
in iron, etc. It is well to eat many different kinds of vegetables in order to 
supply the body with the different Idnds of mineral matter and acids they con- 
tain. 

BUYING VEGETABLES 

In buying vegetables, choose those that are in season and plentiful. 

Potatoes. — Never buy sprouted potatoes. To test potatoes, cut one 
in halves, and if they are Juicy enough to stick together the potato is good. 

Cabbage. — Select those that are hard and heavy, with crisp, white leaves. 

Winter Squash. — Select those that are medium-sized with no soft spots. 

Summer Squash. — Select those that are light yellow in color, with the 
shell so tender that it can be broken with the finger nail. 

Summer Carrots. — See that the leaves are green and fresh. 

Corn. — See that the silk is brown and that the ear is well filled with good 
kernels that are full of sweet milky juice. 

Peas. — Pods should be green and brittle; the peas green and not too large. 

String Beans. — Break a pod. It should be brittle. 

Lima Beans. — Select those with green, juicy pods. 

Spinach. — Choose that with leaves fresh and dirty. 

GENERAL RULES FOR COOKING VEGETABLES 

Wash thoroughly. Pare, peel or scrape, if skins must be removed. 
Skins should be left on to keep in all the food value possible. Soak in cold 
water until ready to cook. Cook in freshly boiling salted water until tender. 
Drain off the water, shake over the fire, serve hot with seasoning, using 2 
tablespoons fat, | teaspoon salt, and a few grains pepper to 1 cup cooked 
vegetables, or serve with white sauce. (See page 8.) 

NoTB. — Allow 1 teaSpoon salt to 1 quart of water. Use enough boiling water to cover 
vegetables. Salt may be added when vegetables are put in, except in the case of delicate green 
vegetables, as peas, spinach, etc., when it should not be added until the vegetables are nearly 
done. To preserve the color of green vegetables, cook uncovered. Cabbage, onions and 
turnips should be cooked uncovered in a large quantity cf water. By changing the water 
once or twice during the cooking, much of the strong odor and flavor may be lost. If dried 
bread be tied in a cheesecloth and placed on top of vegetable during cooking, it absorbs some 
of the odor. Water in which vegetables have been cooked is called vegetable stock and should 
never be thrown away but used in soups and sauces. 

Winter vegetables should be kept in a cool, dark, dry place. Fresh 
vegetables may be washed and kept on ice in a clean piece of cloth.

SALADS 

Simple salads consist of fresh vegetables which require no cooking, 
such as the salad greens, which include leaf lettuce, head lettuce, romaine, 
lettuce, endive, chickory, escarole, sorrel and watercress, and vegetables such 
as onions, cabbage, celery, cucumber and tomatoes. Any of these may be 
served with an oil dressing or a boiled dressing. 

HOW TO PREPARE RAW VEGETABLES FOR SALADS 

Separate leaves or stalks into their natural divisions. Examine them 
carefully, removing inferior portions, insects, etc., that may be found on the 
vegetables. Wash thoroughly in several waters. Running water is prefer- 
able. Salted water aids in removing insects. Drain off the water and dry 
with cheese-cloth. Greens may be kept in a paper bag in the refrigerator 
until serving time. Coarser portions may be used for soups or sauces, 
while the tender portions may be served raw. Great care should be exercised 
in the selection and preparation of food which is not subjected to heat before 
serving, such as salad greens. Salad plants, carelessly cultivated or handled, 
may carry dangerous bacteria, and therefore should be carefully cleaned.

54 THE METROPOLITAN LIFE COOK BOOK 



FROZEN MIXTURES 

Ice and salt form a freezing mixture several degrees below the freezing 
point of water. Salt melts the ice, withdrawing heat from the contents of the 
can, and the melting ice dissolves the salt. The smaller the pieces of ice, the 
more quickly the change to liquid, and the more salt used, the more quickly the 
mixture is frozen. If too much salt is used, however, the frozen mixture will 
be coarsely grained. Three parts ice to 1 part salt is the best proportion 
for a smooth, fine-grained cream. 

DIRECTIONS FOR FREEZING 

Scald can, cover and dasher, then chill. 

Place the can of the freezer in the pail; put in the dasher, and pour in mixture 
to be frozen. Cover and adjust top. Turn crank to make sure can fits in socket. 

Fill the space between the can and pail with alternate layers of ice and 
salt, allowing 3 measures of ice to 1 of salt. The ice and salt should come a 
little higher in the pail than mixture to be frozen. 

The can should not be more than | full, as the mixture expands in freezing. 

Turn the crank slowly at first, then turn crank more rapidly, adding more 
salt and ice if needed. Do not draw off the water, unless it stands so high 
that there is danger of it getting into the can. 

After freezing, draw off water, remove dasher, and with spoon push solidly. 

Put cork in opening of cover. Repack, using 4 parts of ice to 1 of salt. 
Place on top newspapers, an old blanket, or a piece of carpet. 

HOW TO MAKE ICE-CREAM OR ICES WITHOUT A FREEZER 

Cover bottom of pail with crushed ice. Put in baking-powder can, 
tumbler, or lard pail containing mixture to be frozen, and surround with ice 
and salt. Turn can or tumbler with hand occasionally, and as soon as it 
begins to freeze, scrape frozen mixture from sides of can with a knife or 
spatula, and beat mixture with spoon, continuing until mixture is frozen. 

Ice-cream is frozen cream. Frozen pudding is frozen cream or custard 
to which fruits and nuts are added. It is usually served with a sauce. 

Mousse is prepared with whipped cream, which gives it a mossy con- 
sistency. It is molded and packed in ice and salt. 

Water ices are fruit mixtures diluted with water and frozen.

FROZEN MIXTURES 55 



have curdled appearance, it will disappear in freezing. When cool, add 
flavoring and cream. Strain and freeze. Fresh fruit may be cut up and served 
with the ice-cream. Serve crushed fruit sauce, chocolate sauce or maple sauce, 
with or without chopped nuts, on top of each serve of ice<cream when desirable.

^ cup water tartar 5 teaspoon flavoring 

Dissolve the sugar and cream of tartar in the water. Cover the saucepan

of the saucepan. If 1 beaten egg is used, boil the sugar solution to the soft- 
ball stage, until it forms 2-inch threads when dropped from a spoon or fork. 
If 2 egg whites are used, boil to the firm ball stage. The syrup should not 
be stirred during the process of cooking, nor the saucepan moved. If crystals 
do collect on the sides of the saucepan, remove with a wet cloth or wet brush. 
When the sugar solution has boiled to the right temperature, pour it gradually 
into the stiffly-beaten whites of eggs, beating continually while pouring, 
and continue beating until of right consistency to spread on the cakes. Flavor.

PASTRY 61 



PASTRY 

Pastry, if it is to be served at all, should be light, tender and flaky. 
It is then more easily digested. 

Winter wheat flour, called pastry flour, should be used as it makes the 
pastry more tender than bread flour. Less shortening is required when 
pastry flour is used. 

The lightness of the pastry depends upon the amount of air enclosed and 
its expansion in baking. 

The flakiness depends upon the number of layers of shortening and paste 
formed by folding and roUing. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

Use butter substitutes for the fat. 

Rub in with the tips of the fingers or chop in with a knife. 
Add enough cold water to make a stiff dough, using a knife for mixing. 
All the ingredients must be cold. 

Handle the dough as little as possible, and keep it as cold as possible, 
as heat melts the fat and makes it difficult to handle the dough. 
Use as little flour as possible during the rolling. 
Cut the pastry a little larger than the dish to allow for shrinkage. 

RECIPE FOR PASTRY 

1 1 cups flour 3 to J cup shortening Cold water to make a stiff 

i teaspoon salt dough, about 4^ table- 

spoons. 
Mix and sift the flour and salt. Rub in shortening with tips of fingers 
or cut it into the flour with 2 knives. Add the cold water, using a knife for 
mixing. Knead the dough lightly into a ball. Cut in two; roll into circular 
pieces to fit pie tin.
