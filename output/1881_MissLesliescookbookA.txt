BY MISS' LESLIE. 




" Miss Leslie's Cook Book contains near one thousand of her celebrated 
receipts, and is accompanied by a well-arranged index, by which any desired 
receipt may be turned to at once. The receipts are for cooking all kinds of 
soups, meats, poultry, game, shell-fish, pies, vegetables, etc., with directions 
for making all kinds of plain and fancy cakes, sauces, bread, sweetmeats, des- 
serts, pickles, preparations for the sick, miscellaneous receipts, and things 
worth knowing. The merit of these receipts are, that they have all been used 
and tried for years, and are so carefully explained as to be easily comprehended 
by the merest novice in the art, and can be recommended to all. Miss Leslie 
has acquired great reputation among housekeepers, everywhere, for the excel- 
lence of her receipts on cookery, and this volume will enhance it. It is the 
best book on all kinds of cookery we know of, and while it will be useful to 
matrons, to housewives, young or old, it is indispensable. By the aid of 
this volume, the young and inexperienced are brought on a footing with those 
who have seen service in the culinary department for years, and by having it 
at hand are rendered tolerably independent oihelp, which sometimes becomes 
very refractory. The best regulated families are sometimes taken a little by 
surprise by the untimely stepping in of a friend to dinner — to such this vol- 
ume of Miss Leslie's is a friend indeed, ready as this book is with instnictions 
for the hasty production of various substitutes for meals requiring timely and 
elaborate preparation."— Dollar Newspaper.

PRE F A C E. 



I HA7E endeavored to render this work a 
complete manual of domestic cookery in all 
its hranclies. It comprises near seven hun- 
dred pages, and contains near one thou- 
sand receipts. The receipts are all practical, 
and ^practicable — being so carefully and par- 
ticularly explained as to be easily compre- 
hended by the merest novice in the art. 
I also flatter myself that these preparations 
(if faithfully and liberally followed.) will be 
found very agreeable to the general taste ; 
always, however, keeping in mind that 
every ingredient must be of unexceptionable 
quality, and that good cooking cannot be 
made out of bad marketing. 

I hope those who consult this book will

never find themselves at a loss, whether 
they are required to prepare sumptuous 
viands " for company," or to furnish a daily 
supply of nice dishes for an excellent family 
table; or plain, yet wholesome and pala- 
table food where economy is necessary.

MISS LESLIE'S 



COOK BOOK 



SOUPS. 

It is impossible to have good soup, without a 
sufficiency of good meat; thoroughly boiled, care- 
fully skimmed, and moderately seasoned. Meat 
that is too bad for anything else, is too bad for 
soup. Cold meat recooked, adds little to its taste 
or nourishment, and it is in vain to attempt to give 
poor soup a factitious flavor by the disguise of 
strong spices, or other substances which are dis- 
agreeable or unpalatable to at least one-half the 
eaters, and frequently unwholesome. Rice and 
barley add to the insipidity of weak soups, having 
no taste of their own. And even if the meat is 
good, too large a proportion of water, and too 
small a quantity of animal substance will render it 
flat and vapid. 

Every family has, or ought to have, some personal 
knowledge of certain poor people — people to whom 
their broken victuals would be acceptable. Let 
then the most of their cold, fresh meat be set 

(33) ' 



34 MIS3 Leslie's new cook book. 

apart for those wlio can ill afford to buy meat in 
market. To them it will be an important ac- 
q^uisition ; while those who indulge in fine clothes, 
fine furniture, &c., had best be consistent, and 
allow themselves the nourishment and enjoyment 
of freshly cooked food for each meal. Therefor© 
where there is no absolute necessity of doing other- 
wise, let the soup always be made of meat bought 
expressly for the purpose, and of one sort only, 
except when the flavor is to be improved by the 
introduction of ham. 

In plain cooking, every dish should have a 
distinct taste of its natural flavor predominating. 
Let the soup, for instance, be of beef, mutton, or 
veal, but not of all three ; and a chicken, being 
overpowered by the meat, adds nothing to the 
general flavor. 

Soup-meat that has been boiled long enough to 
extract the juices thoroughly, becomes too taste- 
less to furnish, afterwards, a good dish for the ta- 
bl«; with the exception of mutton, which may be 
eal.en very well after it has done duty in the soup- 
pot, when it is much liked by many persons of 
simple tastes. Few who are accustomed to living 
at hotels, can relish hotel soups, which (even in 
houses where most other things are unexceptiona- 
ble), is seldom such as can be approved by per- 
sons who are familiar with good tables. Hotel 
soups and hotel hashes, (particularly those that 
are dignified with French names), are notoriously 
made of cold scraps, leavings, and in some houses, 
are the {absolute refuse of the kitchen. In most 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 35 

cases, tbe sight of a hotel stock-pot would cause 
those who saw it, to forswear soup, &c. 

If the directions are exacthj followed, the soups 
contained in the following pages will be found 
palatable, nutritious, and easily made; but they 
require plenty of good ingredients. 

We have heard French cooks boast of their 
soup being " delicate." The English would cali 
it " soup meagre." In such a country as America, 
where good things are abundant, there is no ne- 
cessity of imbibing the flatulency of weak washy 
Boups. 

All soups should be boiled slowly at first, that 
the essence of the meat may be thoroughly drawn 
forth. The lid of the pot should be kept close, 
unless when it is necessary to remove it for taking 
off the scum, which should be done frequently 
and carefully. If this is neglected, the scum will 
boil back again into the soup, spoil it, and make 
it impure or muddled. When no more scum 
arises, and the meat is all in rags, dropping from 
the bones, it is time to put in the vegetables, sea- 
soning, &c., and not till then ; and if it should 
have boiled away too much, then is the time to 
add a little hot water from another kettle. Add 
also a large crust of bread or two. It may no\«- 
be made to boil faster, and the thickening must 
be put in This is a table-spoonful or more of flour 
mixed to a smooth paste with a little water, and 
enriched with a tea-spoonful of good butter, or 
beef -dripping. This thickening is indispensable 
to all soups. Let it be stirred in well. If making 



36 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

a ricli soup that requires wine or catclntp, let it be 
added the last thing, just before the soup is taken 
from the fire. 

When all is quite done and thoroughly boiled, 
cover the bottom of a tureen with small squares 
of bread or toast, and dip or pour the soup into 
it, leaving all the bones and shreds of meat in the 
pot. To let any of the sediment get into the 
tureen is slovenly and vulgar. Not a particle of 
this should ever be found in a soup-plate. There 
are cooks who, if not prevented, will put all the 
refuse into the tureen ; so that, when helped, the 
plates are half full of shreds of meat and scraps 
of bone, while all the best of the soup is kept 
back for the kitchen. This should be looked to. 
Servants who cannot reconcile it to their con 
science to steal money or any very valuable arti- 
cles, have frequently no hesitation in purloining 
or keeping to themselves whatever they like in 
the way of food. 

Soup may be colored yellow with grated carrots, 
red with tomato juice, and green with the juice of 
pounded spinach — the coloring to be stirred in 
after the skimming is over. These colorings are 
improvements both to its look and flavor. It 
may be browned with scorched flour, kept ready 
always for the purpose. Never put cloves or all- 
spice into soup — they give it a blackish ashy dirt 
color, and their taste is so strong as to overpowei 
every thing else. Both these coarse spices are 
out of use at good tables, and none are introduced

m nice cookery but mace, nutmeg, ginger, and 
ciimamon. 

The meat boiled in soup gives out more of its 
essence, when cut off the bone, and divided into 
small pieces, always removing the fat. The bones, 
however, should go in, as they contain much 
glutinous substance, adding to the strength and 
thickness of the soup, which cannot be palata- 
ble or wholesome unless all the grease is care- 
fully skimmed off. Kitchen grease is used chiefly 
for soap-fat. 

In cold weather, good soup, if carefully covered 
and kept in a cool place, and boiled over again 
for half an hour without any additional water^ will 
be better on the second day than on the first. 

It is an excellent way in winter to boil the 
meat and bones on the first day, without any ve- 
getables. Then, when very thick and rich, strain 
the liquid into a large pan ; cover it, and oet it 
away till next morning — it should then be found 
a thick jelly. Cut it in pieces, having scraped off 
the sediment from the bottom — then add the vo« 
getables, and boil them in the soup. 



»« «« ^^^> ^ ##^.»#« 



MUSHROOM SOUR— Cut a knuckle of veal, 
or a neck of mutton, (or both, if they are small,) 
into large pieces, ana remove the bones. Put it 
into a soup-pot with sufiicient water to cover the 
whole, and season with a little salt and cayenne. 
Let it boil till the meat is in rags, skimming it 
well ; then strain off the soup into another pot. 



8S MISS Leslie's new oook book. 

Have ready a large quart, or a quart and a pint c£ 
freshly-gathered mushrooms — cut them into quar- 
ters, having removed the stalks. Put them into 
the soup, adding a quarter of a pound (or more) of 
fresh butter, divided into bits and rolled in flour 
Boil the whole about half an hour longer — try if the 
mushrooms are tender, and do not take them up 
till they are perfectly so. Keep the pot lid closely 
covered, except when you remove the lid to try 
the mushrooms. Lay at the bottom of the tureen 
a large slice of buttered toast, (cut into small 
squares,) and pour the soup upon it. This is a 
company soup. 



*f<f^^^^H 



SWEET COEN SOUP.— Take a knuckle of 
veal, and a set of calf's feet. Put them into a 
soup-pot with some cold boiled ham cut into 
pieces, and season them with pepper only. Hav 
ing allowed a quart of water to each pound of 
meat, pour it on, and let it boil till the meat falls 
from the bone ; strain it, and pour the liquid into 
a clean pot. If you live in the country, or whera 
milk is plenty, make this soup of milk without 
any water. All white soups are best of milk. You 
may boil in this, with the veal and feet, an old 
fowl, (cut into pieces,) that is too tough for any 
other purpose. When the soup is well boiled, 
and the shreds all strained away, have ready 
(cooked by themselves in another pot) some ears 
of sweet corn, young and tender. Cut the grains 
from t're cob. mix the corn with fresh butter, sea-

ion it with pepper, and stir it in tlie strained soup. 
Give the whole a short boil, pour it into the tureen, 
and send it to table. 



VENISON SOUR— Is excellent, made as above, 
with water instead of milk, and plenty of com. 
And it is very convenient for a new settlement 



TOMATO SOUP.-Take a shin or leg of beef, 
and cut off all the meat. Put it, with the bones, in 
a large soup-pot, and season it slightly with salt 
and pepper. Pour on a gallon of water. Boil and 
skim it well. Have ready half a peck of ripe to- 
matos, that have been quartered, and pressed or 
strained through a sieve, so as to be reduced to 
a pulp. Add half a dozen onions that have 
been sliced, and a table-spoonful of sugar to 
lessen a little the acid of the tomatos. When the 
meat is all to rags, and the whole thoroughly done, 
(which will not be in less than six hours from the 
commencement) strain it through a cullender, and 
thicken it a little with grated bread crumbs. 

This soup will be much improved by the addi- 
tion of a half peck of ochras, peeled, sliced thin, 
and boiled with the tomatos till quite dissolved. 

Before it goes into the tureen, see that there 
are no shreds of meat or bits of bone left in the 
e>up. 



iO . MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

FAMILY TOMATO SOUR — Take foui 
pounds of the lean of a good piece of fresh beef 
The fat is of no use for soup, as it must be skimmed 
off when boiling. Cut the meat in piei es, season 
thorn with a little salt and pepper, and out them 
into a pot with three quarts of water. The to- 
matos will supply abundance of liquid. Of these 
you should have a large quarter of a pei k. They 
should be full-grown, and quite ripe. Cus each to- 
mato into four pieces, and put them into the soup; 
after it has come to a boil and been skimmed. It 
will be greatly improved by adding a quarter of a 
peck of ochras cut into thin round slices. Both to- 
matos and ochras require long and steady boiling 
with the meat. To lessen tne extreme en >id of the 
tomatos, stir in a heaped table-spoonful jf sugar. 
Add also one large onion, peeled and minood small ; 
and add two or three bits of fresh butter rolled in 
flour. The soup must boil till the meat is ail to 
rags and the tomatos and ochras entirely dissolved, 
and their forms undistinguishable. Pour it off 
carefully from the sediment into the tureen, in the 
bottom of which have ready some toasted bread, 
cut into small squares. 



M^^V^^^^ ##^^MV»i 



FINE TOMATO SOUP.— Take some nice fresh 
beef, and divest it of the bone and fat. Sprinkle it 
with a little salt and pepper, and pour on water, 
allowing to each pound of meat a pint and a half 
(not more) of water, and boil and skim it till it is 
very tluck and clear, and all the essence see ins to 



MISS xeslie's new cook book. 43 

be drawn out of the meat. Scald and peel a large 
portion of ripe tomatos — cut them in quarters, 
and laying them in a stew-pan, let them cook in 
their own juice till they are entirely dissolved 
When quite done, strain the tomato liquid, and 
Btir into it a little sugar. In a third pan stew an 
equal quantity of sliced ochras with a very little 
water ; they must be stewed till their shape can 
no longer be discerned. Strain separately the 
meat liquor, the tomatos, and the ochras. Mix 
butter and flour together into a lump; knead it a 
little, and when all the liquids are done and 
strained put them into a clean soup-pan, stir in 
the flour and butter, and give the soup one boil 
up. Transfer it to your tureen, and stir altogether. 
The soup made precisely as above will be per- 
fectly smooth and nice. Have little rolls or milk 
biscuits to eat with it. 
This is a tomato soup for dinner company. 



GREEN PEA SOUP. — Make a nice soup, Id 
the usual way, of beef, mutton, or knuckle of veal, 
cutting off all the fat, and using only the lean and 
the bones, allowing a quart of water to each 
pound of meat. If the meat is veal, add four or 
six calf's feet, which will greatly improve the 
soup. Boil It slowly, (having slightly seasoned it 
with pepper and salt,) and when it has boiled, and 
been well skimmed, and no more scum appears 
then put in a quart or more of freshly -shelled 
green peas, wHh none among them that are old 



48 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

hard, and yellow ; and also a sprig or two of green 
mint, and a little loaf sugar. Boil the peas till 
they are entirely dissolved. Then (having re- 
moved all the meat and bones) strain the soup 
through a sieve, and return it to the soup-pot, 
(which, in the mean time, should have been washed 
clean,) and stir into it a tea- cupful of green spi- 
nach juice, (obtained by pounding some spinach.) 
Have ready (boiled, or rather stewed in another 
pot) a quart of young fresh peas, enriched with a 
piece of fresh butter. These last peas should be 
boiled tender, but not to a mash. After they are 
in, give the soup another boil up, and then pour it 
off into a tureeu, in the bottom of which has been 
laid some toast cut into square bits, with the crust 
removed. This soup should be of a fine green 
color, and very thick. 



'•*V^#^'^<< 



EXCELLENT BEAN SOUP.—Early in the 
evening of the day before you make the soup, 
wash clean a large quart of dried white beans 
in a pan of cold water, and about bedtime pour 
off that water, and replace it with a fresh panful. 
Next morning, put on the beans to boil, with 
only water enough to cook them well, and keep 
them boiling slowly till they have all bursted, 
stirring them up frequently from the bottom, lest 
they should burn. Meantime, prepare in a larger 
pot, a good soup made of a shin of beef cut into 
pieces, and the hoek of a cold ham, allowing a 
Urge quart of v/ater to each pound of meat. 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 43 

Season it with pepper only, (no salt,) and put in 
with it a head of celery, split and cut small. 
Boil the soup (skimming it well) till the meat is 
all in rags ; tnen take it out, leaving not a morsel 
in the pot, and put in the boiled beans. Let 
them boil in the soup till they are undistinguish- 
able, and the soup very thick. Put some small 
squares of toast in the bottom of a tureen, and 
pour the soup upon it. 

There is said to be nothing better for making 
soup than the camp-kettle of the army. Many 
of the common soldiers make their bean soup of 
surpassing excellence. 



-t**^^^^t^ ^ i/\/^#i»»»«» « 



SPLIT PEA SOUR— In buying dried or split 
peas, see that they are not old and worm-eaten. 
Wash two quarts of them over night in two or 
three waters. In the morning make a rich soup 
of the lean of beef or mutton, and the hook of a 
ham. Season it with pepper, but no salt. When 
it has boiled, and been thoroughly skimmed, put 
in the split peas, with a head of celery cut into 
small pieces, or else two table-spoonfuls of celery 
seed. Let it boil till the peas are entirely dis- 
solved and undistingui^hable. When it is finished 
strain the soup through a sieve, divesting it of the 
thin shreds of meat and bits of bone. Then trans- 
fer it to a tureen, in which has been laid some 
square bits of toast. Stir it up to the bottom 
directly before it goes to table. 

You may boil in the soup (instead of the ham'i a 



14 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

good piece (a rib piece, or a fillet) of corned pork, 
more lean than fat. When it is done, take the pork 
out of the soup, put it on a dish, and have ready 
to eat with it a pea-se pudding boiled by itself, cut 
in thick slices and laid round the pork. This 
pudding is made of a quart of split peas, soaked 
all night, mixed with four beaten eggs and a piece 
of fresh butter, and tied in a cloth and boiled 
three or four hours, or till the peas have becomes 
mass. 



'^^^^^■^t 



ASPARAGUS SOUR— Make in the usual way 
a nice rich soup of beef or mutton, seasoned with 
salt and pepper. After it has been well boiled 
and skimmed, and the meat is all to pieces, strain 
the soup into another pot, or wash out the same, 
and return to it the liquid. Have ready a large 
quantity of fine fresh asparagus, with the stalks 
cut off close to the green tops or blossoms. It 
should have been lying in cold water all the time 
the meat was boiling. Put into the soup half of 
the asparagus tops, and boil them in it till entirely 
dissolved, adding a tea-cupful of spinach juice,

Stir the juice well in and it will give a fine green 
color. Then add the remaining half of the as-

them in the bottom of the tureen, and pour the 
soup upon them. This (like green peas) will do

CABBAGE SOUP.— Remove the fat and bone 
from a good piece of fresh beef, or mutton — season 
it with a little salt and pepper, put it into a soup- 
pot, with a quart of water allowed to each pound 
of meat. Boil, and skim it till no more scum is 
seen on the surface. Then strain it, and thicken 
it with flour and butter mixed. Have ready a fine 
fresh cabbage, (a young summer one is best) and 
after it is well washed through two cold waters, 
and all the leaves examined to see if any insects 
have crept between, quarter the cabbage, (remov- 
ing the stalk) and with a cabbage-cutter, or a 
strong sharp knife, cut it into shreds. Or you 
may begin the cabbage whole and cut it into 
shreds, spirally, going round and round it with 
the knife. Put the cabbage into the clear soup, 
and boil it till, upon trial, by taking up a little oa 
a fork, you find it quite tender and perfectly well 
cooked. Then serve it up in the tureen. This is 
a family souv

RED CABBAGE SOUP.— Red cabbages for 
soup shouVl either be quartered, or cut into shreds; 
it is mail J as above, of beef or mutton, and sea- 
soned with salt, pepper, and a jill of strong tarra-

gon vinegar, or a table-spoonful of mixed tarragoa 
leaves, if in summer.

FINE CABBAGE SOUP.— Eemove the ou^ 
Bide leaves from a fine, fresh, large cabbage. Cut 
the stalk short, and split it half- way down so as to 
divide the cabbage into quarters, but do not se- 
parate it quite to the bottom. Wash the cabbage, 
and lay it in cold water for half an hour or more. 
Then set it over the fire in a pot full of water, 
adding a little salt, and let it boil slowly for an 
hour and a half, or more — skimming it well. Then 
take it out, drain it, and laying it in a deep pan, 
pour on cold water, and let it remain till the cab- 
bage is cold all through. Next, having drained 
it from the cold water, cut the cabbage in shreds 
(as for cold-slaw,) and put it into a clean pot con- 
taining a quart and a pint of boiling milk into 
which you have stirred a quarter of a pound of 
nice fresh butter, divided into four bits and rolled 
in flour, adding a little pepper and a very little salt. 
Boil it in the milk till thoroughly done and quite 
tender. Then make some nice toast, cut it into 
squares, lay it in the bottom of a tureen, and 
pour the soup on it. This being made without 
meat is a good soup for Lent. It will be improved 
by stirring in, towards the last, two or thre« 
beaten eggn. 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 47 

CAULIFLOWER SOUP.— Put into a soup, 
pot a knuckle of veal, and allow to each pound a 
quart of water. Add a set of calf's feet that 
have been singed and scraped, but not skinned ; 
and the hock of a cold boiled ham. Boil it till 
all the meat is in rags, and the soup very thick, 
seasoning with cayenne and a few blades of mace[ 
and adding, towards the last, some bits of fresh but- 
ter rolled in flour. Boil in another pot, one or two 
fine cauliflowers. They are best boiled in milk. 
When quite done and very tender, drain them, 
cut off the largest stalks, and divide the blossoms 
into small pieces ; put them into a deep covered 
dish, lay some fresh butter among them, and keep 
them hot till the veal soup is boiled to its utmost 
thickness. Then strain it into a soup-tureen, and 
put into it the cauliflower, grating some nutmeg 
upon it. This soup will be found very fine, and 
is an excellent white soup for company. 

For Lent this soup may be made without meat, 
substituting milk, butter, and flour, and eggs, aa 
in the receipt for fine cabbage soup. Season it 
with mace and nutmeg. If made with milk, &c., 
put no water on it, but boil the cauliflower in milk 
from the beginning. This can easily be done where 
milk is plenty.

FINE ONION SOUP.— Take a fine fresh neck 
of mutton, and to make a large tureen of soup, 
you must have a breast of mutton also. Let the 
in<»at be divided into chops, season it with a little

salt, auJ put it in a soup-pot — allow a quart of 
water to each pound of mutton. Boil, and skim it 
till no more scum arises, and the meat drops in 
rags from the bones. In a small pot boil in milk 
a dozen large onions, (or more,) adding pepper, 
mace, nutmeg, and some bits of fresh butter rolled 
in flour. The onions should previously be peeled 
and sliced. When they are quite soft, transfer 
them to the soup, with the milk, &C., in which 
they were cooked. Give them one boiJ in the soup 
Then pour it off, or strain it into the tureen, omit- 
ting all the sediment, and bones, and shreds of meat. 
Make some nice slices of toast, dipping each in 
boiling water, and trimming off all the crust. 
Cut the toast into small squares, lay them in the 
bottom of the tureen, and pour the soup upon 
them. Where there is no objection to onions it 
will be much liked. 

If milk is plenty use it instead of water for 
onion soup. White soups are always best when 
made with milk. 



TURNIP SOUR— For a very small family 
take a neck of mutton, and divide it into steaks, 
omitting all the fat. For a family of moderate 
size, take a breast as well as a neck. Put them 
into a soup-pot with sufficient water to cover them, 
and let them stew till well browned. Skim them 
carefully. Then pour on more water, in the pro- 
portion of a pint to each pound of meat, and add 
eight or Wn turnips pared and sliced thin, with a 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 49 

very little pepper and salt. Let tlie soup T)oil till 
the turnips are all dissolved, and the meat in 
rags. Add, towards the last, some bits of butter 
rolled in flour, and in five minutes afterwards the 
Boup will be done. Carefully remove all the bits 
j>f meat and bone before you send the soup to 
table. It will be found very good, and highly 
flavored with the turnips. 

Onion soup may be made in the same manner. 
Parsnip soup also, cutting the parsnips into small 
bits. Or all three — turnips, onions and parsnips, 
may be used together. 



PAKSNIP SOUP.— The meat for this soup 
may either be fresh beef, mutton, or fresh venison. 
Remove the fat, cut the meat into pieces, add a 
little salt, and put it into a soup- pot, with an allow- 
ance of rather less than a quart of water to each 
pound. Prepare some fine large parsnips, by first 
scraping and splitting them, and cutting them 
into pieces ; then putting them into a frying pan, 
and frying them brown, in fresh butter or nice 
drippings. When the soup has been boiled till 
the meat is all in rags, and well skimmed — put 
into it the fried parsnips and let them boil about 
ten minutes, but not till they break or go to 
pieces. Just before you put in the parsnips, stir 
in it table-spoonful of thickening made with butter 
and flour, mixed to a smooth paste. When you put 
It into the tureen to go to table, be sure to leave in 
the pot all the shreds of meat and bits of bone. 



50 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

CARROT SOUR— Take a gciod piece of fresh 
beef that has not been previously cooked. Re- 
move the fat. It is of no use in making soup , 
and as it must all be skimmed off when boiling, 
it is better to clear it away before the meat goe? 
into the pot. Season the beef with a very little 
salt and pepper, and allow a small quart of water 
to eaxih pound. Grate half a dozen or more large 
carrots on a coarse grater, and put them to boil 
in the soup with some other carrots ; cut them 
into pieoes about two inches long. When all the 
meat is boiled to rags, and has left the bone, pour 
off the soup from the sediment, transferring it to 
a tureen, and sending it to table with bread cut 
into it. 

POTATO SOUR— Pare and slice thin half a 
dozen fine potatos and a small onion. Boil them 
in three large pints of water, till so soft that you 
can pulp them through a cullender. When re- 
turned to the pot add a very little salt and cay- 
enne, and a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, 
divided into bits, and boil it ten minutes longer. 
When you put it into the tureen, stir in two table- 
spoonfuls or more of good cream. This is a soup 
for fast-days, or for invalids.

ner, a soup of the lean of fresh beef, mut^>oL«; or 
venison, (seasoned with cayenne and a little salt,) 
aUoY^ing rather less than a quart of water to each

pound of meat, skimming and boiling it well, till 
the meat is all in rags, and drops from the bone. 
Strain it, and put it into a clean pot. Have ready 
a quart or more of large chestnuts, boiled and 
peeled. If roasted, they will be still better. 
They should be the large Spanish chestnuts. Put 
the chestnuts into the soup, with some small bits 
of fresh butter rolled in flour. Boil the soup ten 
minutes longer, before it goes to table.

PORTABLE SOUP.— This is a very good 

and nutritious soup, made first into a jelly, and 
then congealed into hard cakes, resembling glue. 
If well made, it will keep for many months 
in a cool, dry place, and when dissolved in hot 
water or gravy, will afford a fine liquid soup, very 
convenient to carry in a box on a journey or sea 
voyage, or to use in a remote place, where fresh 
meat for soup is not to be had. A piece of this 
glue, the size of a large walnut, will, when melted in 
w.iter, become a pint bowl of soup; or by using 
lena water, you may have it much richer. If there 
is time and opportunity, boil with the piece of 
soup a seasoning of sliced onion, sweet marjoram, 
Bweet basil, or any herbs you choose. Also, a bit 
of butter rolled in flour. 

To make portable soup, take two shins or lega 
of beef, two knuckles of veal, and four unskinned 
calves' feet. Have the bones broken or cracked. 
Put the whole into a large clean pot that will hold 
four ga/lons of waten Pour in, at beginning,

only as mucli water as will cover the meat well, 
and set it over the fire, to heat gradually till it 
almost boils. "Watch and skim it carefully while 
any scum rises. Then pour in a quart of cold 
water to make it throw up all the remaining scum, 
and then let it come to a good boil, continuing 
to skim as long as the least scum appears. In this 
be particular. When the liquid appears perfectly 
clear and free from grease, pour in the remainder 
of the water, and let it boil very gently for eight 
hours. Strain it through a very clean hair sieve 
into a large stoneware pan, and set it where it 
will cool quickly. Next day, remove all the re- 
maining grease, and pour the liquid, as quickly 
as possible, into a three-gallon stew-pan, taking 
care not to disturb the settlings at the bottom. 
Keep the pan uncovered, and let it boil as fast as 
possible over a quick fire. Next, transfer it to a 
three-quart stew-pan, and skim it again, if neces- 
sary. Watch it well, and see that it does not 
burn, as that would spoil the whole. Take out a 
little in a spoon, and hold it in the air, to see if 
it will jelly. If it will not, boil it a little longei 
Till it jellies, it is not done. 

Have ready some small white ware preserve 
pots, clean, and quite dry. Fill them with the 
eoup, and let them stand undisturbed till next 
day. Set, over a slow fire, a large flat- bottomed 
Btew-pan one- third filled with boiling water. 
Place in it the pots of soup, seeing it does not reach 
within two inches of their rims. Let the pots 
ttand uncovered in this water, hot, but without

boiling, for six or seven hours. This will hrin^ 
the soup to a proper thickness, which should be 
that of a stift* jelly, when hot ; and when cold, it 
should be like hard glue. When finished turn 
out the moulds of soup, and wrap them up sepa- 
rately in new brownish paper, and put them up in 
boxes, breaking off a piece when wanted to dis- 
solve the soup. 

Portable soup may be improved by the addi 
tion of three pounds of nice lean beef, to the 
shins, knuckles, calves' feet, &c. The beef must 
be out into bits. 

If you have any friends going the overland 
journey to the Pacific, a box of portable soup 
may be a most useful present to them.

PEPPER-POT. —Have ready a small half 
pound of very nice white tripe, that has been 
thoroughly boiled and skinned, in a pot by itself, 
till quite soft and tender. It should be cut into 
very small strips or mouthfuls. Put into another 
pot a neck of mutton, and a pound of lean ham^ 
and pour on it a large gallon of water. Boil it 
slowly, and skim it. When the scum has ceased 
to rise, put in two large onions sliced, four pota- 
tos quartered, and four sliced turnips. Season 
with a very small piece of red pepper or capsicum, 
taking care not to make it too hot. Then add the 
boiled tripe. Make a quart bowlful of small 
dumplings of butter and flour, mixed with a very 
little water; and throw them into the pepper pot

KOODLE SOUP.— This soup may be made 
with either beef or mutton, but the meat must be 
fresh for the purpose, and not cold meat, re- 
cooked. Cut off all the fat, and break the bones. 
If boiled in the soup they improve it. To each 
pound of meat allow a small quart of water. 
Boil and skim it, till the meat drops from the 
bone. Put in with the meat, after the scum has 
ceased to rise, some turnips, carrots and onions, 
cut in slices, and boil them till all to pieces. 
Strain the soup, and return the liquid to a clean 
pot. Have ready a large quantity of noodles, (in 
French nouilles,) and put them into the strained 
Boup; let them boil in it ten minutes. The 
noodles are composed of beaten eggs, made into 
a paste or dough, with flour and a very little fresh 
butter. This paste is rolled out thin into a square 
sheet. This sheet is then closely rolled up *ike a 
scroll or quire of thick paper, and then with a 
sharp knife cut round into shreds, or shavings, as 
cabbage is cut for slaw. These cuttings must be 
dredged with flour to prevent their sticking

CHICKEN SOUP.— Cut up two large fine 
fowls, as if carving them for the table, and wash 
the pieces in cold water. Take half a dozen thin 
Blices of cold ham, and lay them in a soup- pot, 
mixed among the pieces of chicken. Season 
them with a very little cayenne, a little nutmeg 
and a few blades of mace, but no salt, as the ham 
will make it salt enough. Add a head of celery, 
split and cut into long bits, a quarter of a pound 
of butter, divided in two, and rolled in flour. 
Pour on three quarts of milk. Set the soup-pot 
over the fire, and let it boil rather slowly, skim- 
ming it well. When it has boiled an hour, put in 
some small round dumplings, made of half a pound 
of flour mixed with a quarter of a pound of butter ; 
divide this dough into equal portions, and roll 
them in your hands into little balls about the size 
of a large hickory nut. The soup must boil tiU 
the flesh of the fowls is loose on the bones, but 
not till it drops off". Stir in, at the last, the beaten 
yolks of tnree or four eggs; and let the soup re- 
main about five minutes longer over the fire. 
Then take it up. Cut off from the bones the flesh 
of the fowls, and divide it into mouthfuls. Cut 
up the slices of ham in the same manner. Mince 
the livers and gizzards. Put the bits of fowl and 
ham in the bottom of a large tureen, and pour the 
Boup upon it 

This soup will be found excellent, and may be 
made of large old fowls, that cannot be cooked in 
any other way. If they are so old that when the

DUCK SOUP.— Half roast a pair of fine Urge 
tame ducks, keeping thera half an hour at the 
fire, and saving the gravy, the fat of which i lust 
be carefully skimmed off. Then cut them up ; 
season them with black pepper; and put them 
into a soup-pot with four or five small onions 
sliced thin, a small bunch of sage, a thin slice of 
cold ham cut into pieces, a grated nutmeg, and 
the yellow rind of a lemon grated. Add the gravy 
of the ducks. Pour on, slowly, three quarts of 
boiling water from a kettle. Cover the soup-pot, 
and set it over a moderate fire. Simmer it slowly 
(skimming it well) for about four hours, or till the 
flesh of the ducks is dissolved into small shreds. 
When done, strain it through a tureen, the bottom 
of which is covered with toasted bread, cut into 
square dice about two inches in size.

When done, strain it through a sieve into a tu- 
reen, or a deep white- ware pan. Next day, take 
off all the fat, and put the jelly (for such it ouglu 
to be) into a clean soup-pot with two ounces of 
vermicelli, and set it over the fire. Wnon the 
Vermicelli is dissolved, stir in, gradually, a pint 
of thick cream, while the soup is quite hot; but 
do not let it come to a boil after the cream is in, 
lest it should curdle. Cut up one or two French 
rolls in the bottom of a tureen, pour in the soup, 
and send it to table.

COCOA-NUT SOUR— Take eight calves' fee. 
(two sets) that have been scalded and scraped, but 
not skinned ; and put them into a soup-kettle 
with six or seven blades of mace, and the yellow 
rind of a lemon grated. Pour on a gallon of 
water ; cover the kettle, and let it boil very slowly 
(skimming it well) till the flesh is reduced to rags 
and has dropped entirely from the bones. Then 
strain it into a broad white- ware pan, and set it 
away to get cold. When it has congealed, scrape 
off the fat and sediment, cut up the cake of jelly, 
(or stock,) and put it into a clean porcelain or ena- 
meled kettle. Have ready half a pound of very 
finely grated cocoa-nut. Mix it with a pint of 
cream. If you cannot obtain cream, take licb 
unskimmed milk, and add to it three ounces of 
the bosi fresh butter divided into three parts, each

bit rolled in arrow-root or rice-flour. Mix it, 
gradually, with the cocoa-nut, and add it to the 
calves-feet-stock in the kettle, seasoned with a 
small nutmeg grated. Set it over the fire, and boil 
it, slowly, about a quarter of an hour ; stirring it 
well. Then transfer it to a tureen, and serve it 
up. Have ready small French rolls, or light milk 
biscuit to eat with it; also powdered sugar in case 
«ny of the company should wish to sweeten it. 



«^MV^/^^/V'^'<^\^s/^AAM~. 



ALMOND SOUP is made in the above man- 
ner, substituting pounded almonds for the grated 
cocoa-nut. You must have half a pound of 
shelled sweet almonds, mixed with two ounces of 
shelled bitter almonds. After blanching them in 
hot water, they must be pounded to a smooth 
paste (one at a time) in a marble mortar ; adding 
frequently a little rose-water to prevent their oil- 
ing, and becoming heavy. Or you may use peach- 
water for this purpose ; in which case omit the 
bitter almonds, as the peach-water will give the 
desired flavor. When the pounded almonds are 
ready, mix them with the other ingredients, as 
above. 

The calves' feet for these soups should be boiled 
wther very early in the morning, or the day before. 



^■^^/\^/^/^'»»~ 



bPRING SOUP.— Unless your dinner hour is 
very late, the stock for this soup should be made 
the day before it is wanted, and set away in » 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 59 

stone pan, closely covered. To make the stock 
take a knuckle of veal, break the bones, and cut 
i^ into several pieces. Allow a quart of water to 
each pound of veal. Put it into a soup- pot, with 
a set of calves' feet,* and some bits of cold ham, 
cut off near tke hock. If you have no ham, 
sprinkle in a tea-spoonful of salt, and a salt-spoon 
of cayenne. Place the pot over a moderate fire, 
and let it simmer slowly (skimming it well) for 
several hours, till the veal is all to rags and the 
flesh of the calves' feet has dropped in shreds from 
the bones. Then strain the soup ; and if not 
wanted that day, set it away in a stone pan, as 
above mentioned. 

Next day have, ready boiled, two quarts or more 
of green peas, (they must on no account be old,) 
and a pint of the green tops cut off from aspara- 
gus boiled for the purpose. Pound a handful of 
raw spinach till you have extracted a tea-cupful 
of the juice. Set the soup or stock over the fire , 
add the peas, asparagus, and spinach juice, stirring 
them well in ; also a quarter of a pound of fresh 
butter, divided into four bits, and rolled in flour. 
Let the whole come, to a boil ; and then take it 
off' and transfer it to a tureen. It will be found 
excellent. 

In boiling the peas for this soup, you may put 
with them half a dozen sprigs of green mint, to ba 
afterwards taken out. 

In bujing calves' feet always get those that are singed, net 
skinned. Much of the glutinous or jelly property residep v» 
Uie skin. 



60 MISS LESLIE'S NEW OOOK BOOK, 

Late in the spring you may add to tlie othoi 
vegetables two cucumbers, pared and sliced, and 
the whitest part or heart of a lettuce, boiled to- 
gether; then well drained, and put into the soup 
with the peas and asparagus. It must be very 
thick with vegetables. 

SUMMER SOUP.— Take a large neck of mut 
ton, and hack it so as nearly to cut it apart, but 
aot quite. Allow a small quart of water to each 
pound of meat, and sprinkle on a tea-spoonful 
of salt and a very little black pepper. Put it into 
1 soup-pot, and boil it slowly (skimming it well) 
till the meat is reduced to rags. Then strain the 
liquid, return it to the soup-pot, and carefully re- 
move all the fat from the surface. Have ready 
half a dozen small turnips sliced thin, two young 
onions sliced, a table-spoonful of sweet marjoram 
leaves picked from the stalks, and a quart of 
shelled Lima beans. Put in the vegetables, and 
boil them in the soup till they are thoroughly 
done. You may add to them two table-spoonfuls 
of green nasturtion seeds, either fresh or pickled. 
Put in also some little dumplings, (made of flour 
and butter,) about ten minutes before the soup is 
done. 

Instead of Lima beans, you may divide a cauli- 
Hower or two broccolis into sprigs, and boil them 
iu the soup with the other vegetables. 

This soup may be made of a shoulder of mutton, 
.3Ut ?nto pieces and the bones cracked. For a larg«

AUTUMN SOUP.— Begin this soup as early 
in the day as possible. Take six pounds of the 
lean of fine fresh beef; cut it into small pieces; 
sprinkle it with a tea-spoonful of salt, (not more); 
pat it into a soup-pot, and pour on six quarts of 
water. The hock of a cold ham will greatly im- 
prove it. Set it over a moderate fire, and let it 
boil slowly. After it comes to a boil, skim it well. 
Have ready a quarter of a peck of ochras cut into 
very thin round slices, and a quarter of a peck of 
tomatos cut into pieces; also a quart of shelled 
Lima beans. Season them with pepper. Put them 
m; and after the whole has boiled three hours at 
l&xstj take four ears of young Indian corn, and hav- 
ing grated off all the grains, add them to the soup 
and boil it an hour longer. Before you serve up 
the soup remove from it all the bits of meat, 
which, if the soup is sufficiently cooked, will be 
reduced to shreds. 

You may put in with the ochras and tomatos 
one or two sliced onions. The soup, when done, 
should be as thick as a jelly. 

Ochras for soup may be kept all winter, by t j- 
mg them separately to a line stretched high aciosi 
the store room. 



62 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

WINTER SOUP.— Tlie day before you makt 
the soup, get a leg or shin of beef. Have the 
bone sawed through in several places, and the meat 
notched or scored down to the bone. This will 
cause the juice or essence to come out more freely, 
wnen cooked. Rub it slightly with salt; cover it, 
and set it away. Next morning, early as possible, 
as soon as the fire is well made up, put the beef 
into a large soup-pot, allowing to each pound a 
small quart of water. Then taste the water, and 
if the salt that has been rubbed on the meat is not 
sufficient, add a very little more. Throw in aldo 
a tea-spoonful of whole pepper-corns; and you 
may add half a dozen blades of mace. Let it 
simmer slowly till it comes to a boil; then ski-o 
it well. After it boils, you may quicken the ni .\ 
At nine o'clock put in a large head of cabbage c tt 
fine as for cold-slaw; six carrots grated; the leavv-is 
stripped from a bunch of swecu marjoram; and 
the leaves of a sprig of parsley. An hour afttsr- 
wards, add six turnips, and three potatoes, all 
cut into four or eight pieces. Also two onions, 
which will be better if previously roasted brown, 
and then sliced. Keep the soup boiling steadily, 
but not hard, unless the dinner hour is very early 
For a late dinner, there will be time to boil it 
slowly all the while; and all soups are the better 
for long and slow boiling. See that it is well 
skimmed, so that, when done, there will be not a

time take it up with a large ladle, and transfer it

shreds of meat and bone. Leave them all in the 
bottom of the pot, pressing them down with the 
ladle. A mass of shreds in the tureen or soup 
plate looks slovenly and disgusting, and should 
never be seen at the table ; also, they absorb too 
much of the liquid. Let the vegetables remain in 
the soup when it is served up, but pick out every 
shred of meat or bone that may be found in the 
tureen when ready to go to table. 

In very cold weather, what is left of this soup 
will keep till the second day; when it must be 
simmered again over the fire, till it just comes to 
a boil. Put it away in a tin or stone vessel. The 
lead which is used in glazing earthern jars fre- 
quently communicates its poison to liquids thai 
are kept in them.

VEGETABLE SOJJP—{very good.)— Soak all 
night, in cold water, either two quarts of yellow 
split peas, or two quarts of dried white beans. In 
the morning drain them, and season them with a 
very little salt and cayenne, and a head of minced 
celery, or else a heaped table-spoonful of celery 
seed. Put them into a soup-pot with four quarts 
of watei, and boil them slowly till they are all 
dissolved and undistinguishable. Stir them fre- 
quently. Have ready a profuse quantity of fr jsh 
vegetables, such as turnips, carrots, parsnips, f *ta- 
tos, onions, and cauliflowers; also salsify, and as- 
paragus tops. Put in, first, -the vegetables that

into small pieces. Enrich the whole with some 
bits of fresh butter rolled in flour. Boil these 
vegetables in the soup till they are all quite tender. 
Then transfer it to a tureen, and serve it up hot. 

The foundation being of dried peas or beans, 
makes it very thick and smooth, and the fresh 
vegetables improve its flavor. It is a good soup 
for Lent, or for any time, if properly and liberally 
made. 

All vegetable soups can be made in Lent with- 
out meat, if milk is substituted for water, and with 
butter, beaten eggs and spice, to flavor and enrich it.

FRENCH POT AU FEU.— This is one of 
^Tie national dishes of France. The following is 
a genuine French receipt, and it would be found 
very palatable and very convenient if tried in our 
own land of plenty. The true French way to cook 
it is in an earthen pipkin, such as can be had in 
auy pottery shop. The French vessel has a wide 
iiiouth, and close-fitting lid, with a handle at each 
side, in the form of circular ears. It is large and 
swelling in the middle, and narrows down towards 
the bottom. The American pipkin has a short 
thick spout at one side, and stands on three or four 
low feet. No kitchen should be without these 
vessels, which are cheap, very strong, and easily 
kept clean. They can sit on a stove, or in the 
corner of the fire, and are excellent for slow cooking.

dients, puts them, by degrees, into the pot, attends 
to it during the day; and when her husband has 
done his work she has ready for him an excellent 
and substantial repast, far superior to what in our 
ci-untry is called a tea-dinner. Men frequently in- 
demnify themselves for the poorness of a tea-dinner 
by taking a dram of whiskey afterwards. A 
Freiiohman is satisfied with his excellent pot a feu 
and some fruit afterwards. The French are noteci 
as a temperate nation. If they have eaten to their 
satisfaction they have little craving for drink. Yet 
there is no country in the world where so much 
good eating might be had as in America. But to 
live well, and wholesomely, there should also be 
good cooking, and the wives of our artisans must 
learn to think more of the comfort, health, and 
cheerfulness of him who in Scotland is called the 
bread-winner^ than of their own finery, and their 
children's uncomfortable frippery. 

RecdpL — For a large pot au feu, put into the pip- 
km six pounds of good fresh beef cut up, and pour 
on it four quarts of water. Set it near the fire, 
skim it v^rhen it simmers, and when nearly boiling, 
add a tea-spoonful of salt, half a pound of liver 
cut in pieces, and some black pepper. Then add 
two or three large carrots, sliced or grated on a 
coarse grater ; four turnips, pared and quartered , 
eight young onions peeled and sliced thick, two of 
the onions roasted whole ; a head of celery cut up • 
A parsnip split and cut up ; and six potatos, pared, 
sliced, or quartered. In short any good vege-

mer and autumn. Also a bunch of sweet Kerbs, 
chopped small. Let the whole continue to boil 
slowly and steadily; remembering to skim well, 
Let it simmer slowly five or six hours. Then, hav- 
ing laid some large slices of bread in the bottom of 
a tureen, or a very large pan or bowl, pour the 
Btew or soup upon it ; all the meat, and all the 
vegetables. If you have any left, recook it the 
next morning for breakfast, and that day you may 
prepare something else for dinner. 

For beef you may substitute mutton, or fresh 
venison, if you live in a venison country, and can 
get it newly killed- 



WELD DUCK SOUP.— This is a company 
soup. If you live where wild ducks are abundant, 
it will aifbrd an agreeable variety occasionally to 
make soup of some of them. If you suspect them 
to be sedgy or fishy, (you can ascertain by the 
smell when drawing or cleaning them,) parboil each 
duck, with a carrot put into his body. Then take 
out the carrot and throw it away. You will find 
that the unpleasant flavor has left the ducks, and 
been entirely absorbed by the carrots. To make 
the soup — cut up the ducks, season the pieces with 
a little salt and pepper, and lay them in a soup- 
pot. For a good pot of soup you should have four 
wild ducks. Add two or three sliced onions, and 
0, table- spoonful of minced sage. Also a quarter of 
a pound of butter divided into four, and each piec6 
rolled in ficur. Pour in water enough to makt ^

rich sottp, and let it boil slowly till all the flesh 
has left the bones, — skim it well. 1 hicken it with 
boiled or r<!>asted chestnuts, peeled, and then mashed 
with a potato beetle. A glass of Madeira or sherry 
will be found an improvement, stirred in at the 
last, or the juice and grated peel of a lemon. In 
taking it up for the tureen, be carefal to leave all 
the bones and bits of meat in the bottom of the pot. 



VENISON SOUP.—Take a large fine piece of 
freshly killed venison. It is best at the season 
when the deer are fat and juicy, from having plenty 
of wild berries to feed on. I do not consider win- 
ter-venison worth eating, when the meat is poor and 
hard, and affords no gravy, and also is black from 
being kept too long. When venison is fresh and 
in good order it yields a fine soup, allowing a small 
quart of water to each pound of meat. When it 
has boiled well, and been skimmed, put in some 
small dumplings made of flour and minced suet. 
or drippings. Also, boiled sweet potatos, cut into 
round thick slices. You may add boiled sweet 
corn cut ofi' the cob ; and, indeed, whatever vege- 
tables are in season. The soup-meat should boil till 
all the flesh is loose on the bonfis, and the bits 
and shreds should not be served up. 

The best pieces of bufialo make good soup. 



68 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

GAME SOUP.— Take partridges, pheasants, 
grouse, quails, oi any of the birds considered as 
game. You may put in here as many different 
Borts as you can procure. They must all be fresh 
killed. When they are cleaned and plucked, cut 
them in pieces as for carving, and put them into a 
soup-pot^ with four calves' feet and some slices of 
ham. two sticks of celery, and a bundle of sweet 
herbs chopped small, and water enough to cover 
the whole well. Boil and skim well, till all the 
flesh is loose from the bones. Strain the liquid 
through a sieve into a clean pot, then thicken it with 
fresh butter rolled in flour. Add some force-meat 
balls that have been already fried ; or else some hard- 
boiled yolks of eggs; some currant jelly, or some 
good wine into which a half-nutmeg has been 
grated ; the juice of two oranges or lemons, and the 
grated yellow peel of one lemon. Give the soup 
another boil up, and then send it to table, having 
bre-ad rolls to eat with it. 

This is a fine soup for com?pany. Yenison soup 
may be made in this manner. Hare soup also. 



*jvs/^^^^>*^\^j\r<w. 



SQUATTER'S SOUP.— Take plenty of fresh- 
killed venison, as fat and juicy as you can get it. 
Cut the meat off the bones and put it (with the 
bones) into a large pot. Season it with pepper 
and salt, and pour on sufficient water to make a 
good rich soup. Boil it slowly (remembering to 
skim it well) till the meat is all in rags. Have 
veady some ears of young sweet corn. Boil then?

in a pot by themselves till they are quitt soft 
Out the grains off the cob into a deep dish. Hav 
i.ng cleared the soup from shreds and bits of bone 
left at the bottom of the pot, stir in a thickening 
made of Indian meal mixed to a paste with a littla 
fresh lard, or venison gravy. And afterwards 
throw in, by degrees, the cut corn. Let all boil 
together, till the corn is soft, or for about half an 
hour. Then take it up in a large pan. It will 
be found very good by persons who never were 
squatters. This soup, with a wild turkey or a 
buffalo hump roasted, and stewed grapes sweetened 
well with maple sugar, will make a good backwoods 
dinner. 



MOCK TURTLE SOUP.— Boil together a 
knuckle of veal (cut up) and a set of calves' feet, 
split. Also the hock of a cold boiled ham. Sea- 
son it with cayenne pepper; but the ham will ren- 
der it salt enough. You may add a smoked 
tongue. Allow, to each pound of meat, a small 
quart of water. After the meat has come to a boil 
and been well skimmed, add half a dozen sliced 
parsnips, three sliced onions, and a head of celery 
cnt small, with a large bunch of sweet marjoram, 
and two large carrots sliced. Boil all together till 
khe vegetables are nearly dissolved and the meat 
falls from the bone. Then strain the whole 
through a cullender, and transfer the liquid to a 
clear pot. Have ready some fine large sw.jet- 
bread? that have been soaked in warm watej for

an hour till all the blood was disgorged; then 
transferred to boiling water for ten minutes, and 
then taken out and laid in very cold water. Thi^ 
will blaach them, and all sweetbreads should look 
white. Take them out; and remove carefully 
all the pipe or gristle. Cat the sweetbreads 
in pieces or mouthfuls, and put them into the 
pot of strained soup. Have ready about two or 
three dozen (or inore) of force-meat balls, made of 
cold minced veal and ham seasoned with nutmeg 
and maoe, enriched with butter, and mixed with 
grated lemon-peel, bread-crumbs, chopped marjoram 
ttfid beaten eggs, to make the whole into smooth 
balls about the size of a hickory nut. Throw the 
bails into the :^oup, and add a fresh lemon, sliced 
thin, and a pint of Madeira wine. Give it one 
more boil up ; then put it into a tureen and send it 
to table. 

This ought to be a rich soup, and is seildom made 
except for dinner company. 

If the above method is exactly followed, there 
will be found no necessity for taking the trouble 
and enduring the disgust and tediousness of clean- 
ing and preparing a calf's head for mock turtle 
soup — a very unpleasant process, which too much 
resembles the horrors of a dissecting room. And 
when all is done a calf's head is a very insipid 
article. 

It will be found that the above is superior to 
anv mock turtle. Made of shin beef, with all thest* 
tnt^reiiients, it is very rich and fine. 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 71 

FISH SOUP.— All fish soups should le made 
with milk, (if unskimmed so much the better,) using 
no water whatever. The best fish for soup are the 
smpU sort of cat-fish; also tutaug, porgie, blue fish, 
wh 'te fiah^ black fish or sea-bass. Cut off their heads, 
tails, aiid fins, and remove the skin, and the back 
bone, and cut the fish into pieces. To each pound 
of fish allow a quart of rich milk. Put into the 
soup -pot some pieces of cold boiled ham. No salt 
will fAien be required; but season with cayenne 
peppci-, and a few blades of mace and some grated 
nutm*.'^. Add a bunch of sweet marjoram, the 
leavcL^t stripped from the stalks and chopped. 
Make^ some little dumplings of flour and butter, 
and pat them in when the soup is about half done. 
Half an hour's steady boiling will be sufficient. 
Serve up in the tureen the pieces of fish and ham. 
Also some toast cut in dice. 

Soup may be made in this manner, of chickens 
or rabbits, using always milk enriched with bits 
of butter rolled in flour and flavored with bits of 
cold ham.

LOBSTEE SOUP.— This is a fine soup rbi 
(jompany. Take two or three fine fresh lobsters, 
(the middle sized are the best.) Heat a large 
[)Ot of water, throwing in a large handful of 
salt. When it is boiling hard put in the lobsters, 
head foremost, that they may die immediately

the shell, and drain the lobster. First break off th 
large claws, and crack them, then split the body 
and extract all the white meat, and the red coral — 
nothing else — and cut it into small pieces. l^Tasl 
the coral into smooth bits with the back of a large 
spoon, mixing with it plenty of sweet oil ; and, gra- 
dually, adding it to the bits of chopped lobster. Put 
into a clear soup-pot two quarts, or more, of good 
milk, and thicken it with half a dozen crackers or 
butter-biscuit, pounded fine; or the grated crumbs 
of two or three small rolls, and stir in a quarter of 
a pound of fresh batter made into a paste with 
two spoonfuls of flour Put in the chopped lob- 
ster, seasoned with nutmeg, a few blades of mace 
powdered, and a little cayenne. Let all boil together, 
slowly, for half an hour, keeping it closely covered. 
Towards the last, stir in two beaten eggs. Lay 
some very small soda biscuit in the bottom of a 
tureen, and pour the soup upon them. Nasturtion 
flowers strewed at the last thickly over the surface 
of this soup, when in the tureen, are an improve- 
ment both to its ap'^earance and flavor. So is pe]>-

boiled crabs, cut it small, and give it a boil in two

OYSTER SOUP— Strain the liquor from one 
Hundred oysters, and carefully remove any bits of 
shell or particles of sea- weed. To every pint of 
oyster liquor allow an equal quantity of rich milk. 
Season it with whole pepper and some blades of 
mace. Add a head of celery, washed, scraped, and 
minced small. Put the whole into a soup-pot, and 
boil and skim it well. When it boils put in the 
oysters. Also, a quarter of a pound of fresh butter : 
divide into four pieces, each piece rolled in flour. 
If you can procure cream, add a half-pint, other- 
\7ise boil some six eggs hard, and crumble the 
yolks into the soup. After the oysters are in give 
them but one boil up, just sufficient to plump 
them. If boiled longer they will shrink and 
shrivel and lose their taste. Take them all out 
and set them away to cool. When the soup ia 
done, place in the bottom of the tureen some small 
square pieces of nicely toasted bread cut into dice, 
iuid pour on the soup; grate in a nutmeg and 
then add the oysters. Serve it up very hot. 

Another way is to chop or cut small the oysters, 
omitting the hard part. Make the soup as abo\e, 
and put in the minced oysters at the last, ietii>tg 
them boil but five minutes. Mix the powUt* *1

Dutmeg with them. This is a good way, if you 
make but a small quantity of soup. 



CIjAM soup. — Having washed clean the out- 
aid 3 shells of a hundred small sand clams, (or 
scrubbed them with a brush,) put them into a large 
jjot of boiling water. When they open their shells 
take them out with a ladle, and as you do so, put 
them into a cullender to drain oft' the liquor. Then 
extract the clams from the shells with a knife. 
Save a quart of the liquor, putting the clams in a 
pitcher by themselves. Mix with the quart of 
liquor, in a clean pot, two quarts of rich milk. 
Put in the clams, and add some pepper-corns and 
some blades of mace. Also, a bunch of sweet 
marjoram, the leaves stripped oft* and minced. Af- 
ter all hss boiled well for an hour, add half a pound, 
or more, of nice fresh butter, made into little 
dumplings with flour ; also a pint of grated bread- 
crumbs. Let it boil a quarter of an hour longer. 
Then pour the soup oft' from the clams and leave 
them in the bottom of the pot. They will not now be 
worth eating. If you cannot obtain small clams, 
you may cut large ones in pieces, but they are 
very coarse and tough.

FAST-DAY SOUP. — i^V 2^;m.'er. — Having 
soaked all night two quarts of split peas, put them 
into a soup-pot, adding a sliced onion, two heads 
o^ celery, the stalks split and cut small ; a table-

tfpoonful of chopped miDt, anotner of marjoram, 
and two beets, that have been previously boiled 
and sliced. Mix all these with half a pound of 
fresh butter cut into pieces and dredged with flour. 
Season with a little salt and pepper. Pour on rather 
more than water enough to cover the whole. Let 
them boil till all the things are quite tender, and 
the peas dissolved. When done, cover the bottom 
of a tureen with small square bits of toast, and 
pour in the contents of the soup-pot. 

It is a good way to boil the split peas in a pot 
by themselves, till they are quite dissolved, and 
then add them to the ingredi-^^nts in the other pot. 

Vegetable soups require a ^arge portion of vege- 
tables, and butter always, as a substitute for meat.

FKIDAY SOUP.-— i^or summer.--Thi8 is a fast- 
day soup. Pare and slice six cucumbers, and cut up 
the white part or heart of six lettuces ; slice two 
onions, and cut small the leaves of six sprigs of 
fresh green mint, unless mint is disliked by the 
persons that are to eat the soup ; in which ca&a, 
substitute parsley. Add a quart of young green 
peas. Put the whole into a soup-pot, with as much 
water as will more than cover them well Season 
slightly with salt and a little cayenne, and add 
half a pound of nice fresh butter, divided into 
six, each piece dredged well with flour. Boil 
the whole for an hour and a half Then serve it 
up, without straining; having colored it greeu w.ih 
A tea-cup c^f pounded spinach juice. 



76 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

When green peas are out of season, you maj 
substitute tomatos peeled and quartered. 

This gkoup, having no meat, is chiefly for East 
days, but will be found good at any time. 



BAKED SOUP.— On the days that you bake 
bread, you may have a dish of thick soup with 
very little trouble, by putting into a large earthen 
jug or pipkin, or covered pan, the following ar- 
ticles : — Two pounds of fresh beef, or mutton, cut 
into small slices, having first removed the fat ; two 
sliced onions and four carrots, and four parsnips 
cut in four ; also, four turnips, six potatos pared 
and cut up, and half a dozen tomatos, peeled and 
quartered. Season the whole with a little salt and 
pepper. A large beet, scraped and cut up, will be 
an improvement. To these things pour on three 
quarts of water. Cover the earthen vessel, and 
set it in the o ven with the bread, and let the soup 
bake at the same time. 

If the bread is done before the dinner hour, you 
must keep the soup still longer in the oven. 

Do not use cold meat for this or any other soup, 
uuless you are very poor.

FISH. 

TO OLE A.N FISH.— T[^liis must always be doue 
with the greatest care and nicety. If sent to table 
imperfectly cleaned, they are disgraceful to the cook, 
and disgusting to the sight and taste. Handle the 
fish lightly; not roughly so as to bruise it. Wash 
it well, but do not leave it in the water longer than 
is needfal. It will lose its flavor, and become in- 
sipid, if soaked. To scale it, lay the fish flat upon 
one side, holding it firmly in the left hand, and 
with the right taking off the scales by means of a 
knife. YT nen both sides are done, pour sufficient 
cold water over it to fl^at off all the loose scales that 
may ha»-e escaped your notice. It is best to pump 
on it. Then proceed to open and empty the fish, 
Be su'.o that not the smallest particle of the entraih 
is leli in. Scrape all carefully from the backbone. 
Wa/ih out all the blood from the inside. A dex- 
terous cook can draw a fish without splitting it 
entirely down, all the way fi'om head to tail. Smelts 
and other small fish are drawn or emptied at the 
gills. 

All fish should be cleaned or drawn as soon as 
they are brought in, and then kept on ice, till the 
moment for cooking. 



■^rfS^-^'^^ ^►■t^'^'A^''**** 



TC BOIL FISH.— No fish can be fit to eat unless 
the eyes are prominent and lively, the gills very 
red, and the body firm and stiff, sprixigiug back

immediately when bent round to try them. Every 
«?cale must be carefully scraped off, and the entrails 
entirely extracted ; not the smallest portion being 
carelessly left sticking to the backbone. Previous 
to cooking, fish of every kind should be laid in cold 
water, and the blood thoroughly washed from the 
mside. Few fish are not the better for being put on 
to boil in cold water, heating gradually with it till it 
comes to a boil. K you put it on in boiling water, 
the outside becomes boiling hot too soon ; and is 
apt to break and come off in flakes, while the inside 
still remains hard and underdone : halibut, salmon, 
cod, and other large thick fish must be boiled slowly 
and thoroughly throughout, taking nearly as long 
as meat. Always put salt into the water at the 
commencement, and a little vinegar towards the 
last. In every kitchen should be a large oval 
kettle purposely for boiling fish. This kettle has 
a movable strainer inside. The fish lies on the 
strainer. To try if it is done, run a thin sharp 
knife in it, till it reaches the backbone ; and see if 
the flesh will loosen or separate easily. If it ad- 
heres to the bone it requires more boiling. When 
quite done, leave it no longer in the kettle, or it 
wiP lose its flavor and get a woolly look. Take 
out the strainer with the fish upon it. Drain off 
the wntcr thi'ough the strainer, cover the fish with 
a folded napkin or fine towel, doubled thick ; trans- 
fer it to a heated dish, and keep it warm and dry 
till it goes to table, directly after the soup. In 
the mean time prepare the sauce to be served up 
a^ong with the fish. 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 79 

FEYING FISH.— Fish should be fried in very 
good fresh butter, or nice beef drippings ; or else 
in lard, which last, is the most usaal method. A 
lar^e allowance of lard should be put into the pan, 
and held over a clear fire, till it becomes so hot aa 
to boil fast in the pan. Till the lard hisses and 
bubbles do not put in the fish. They must first 
be dried separately in a clean cloth, and then scored 
on the back in deep incisions, or gashes, and slightly 
dredged with flour. Unless the lard is amply suf- 
ficient in quantity to cover the fish well, and bear 
them up towards the surface, they will sink heavily 

a„„^ to the bottom of the pan, and perhaps stick there 

1 and burn. Also, if there is not fat enough, the 

fish will absorb the whole of what there is, and 

J, become dark-colored and greasy.

BAKED FISH.—This is a dish for company. 
You may bake in the same manner a shad, a fresh 
codfish, a sheep's head, a white fish, or a blue fish, 
or a pair of large black fish. Trout also are con- 
sidered fish for baking. Cut off the head, and split 
the fish nearly down to the tail. For a stufling, 
(5 at two slices of nice light wheat bread, of shape 
and size to fit easily into the inside of the fish, and 
spread them thickly with nq^^:^ new fresh butter. 
Season them with cayenne and powdered mace, and 
moisten them with port wine or sherry. Add 
the juice and yellow rind of a lemon, grated ; and 
sufficient powdered white sugar to take oil* the ex- 
tir*».rae acid of the last. Fill the body of the fisl?

with this stuffing, kept in bj tying round the f\3\ 
carefully, a white cotton cord, or tape, so as to con- 
fine it in several places. Lay bits of fresh butter 
over the outside, at equal distances. Place the fish 
on a trivet, in a bake pan, and pour round it a })int 
of wine and water mixed. Baste it with this fre- 
quently while baking. It will require at least an 
hour in a quick oven. If the basting does not 
leave sufficient gravy, add half a pint more of wine 
mixed with a little hot water. 

When you have taken up the fish, keep it hot 
while you are finishmg the gravy, which you 
should thicken and enrich by stirring in smoothly 
a piece of butter mixed slightly into a paste with 
flour, and seasoned with grated nutmeg. Serve up 
the gravy in a sauce-boat, and lay slices of lemon 
along the back of the fish, having, of course, 
removed the string that was wound around it to 
confine the stuffing. Send to table with the baked 
fish, a dish of potatos mashed with milk and but- 
ter, and browned on the surface with a salamander, 
or a red hot shovel. Always remove the seeda 
of lemon slices. Fresh mackerel may be baked 
thus. 

Fish may be baked plainly, with a stuffing of 
sweet marjoram, minced sage, and onion, (previously 
boiled and drained,) a little butter, or finely chopped 
beef suet, and plenty of grated bread crumbs, sea- 
soned with a little black pepper. Or instead of 
crumbs you may put in slices of bread and butter 
soaked in milk, and secured as above from fallmg 
out while the fish is baking.

STEWED FISH.— Take any nice &esh fish of 
moderate size, and when it is drawn and washed, 
cut it into three or four pieces, and put them into a 
Btew-pan with amply sufficient hot water to keep 
Ihem from burning. Season them with a little 
salt and cayenne. After it has simmered steadily 
for half an hour, and been skimmed, have ready a 
quarter of a pound of fresh butter, mixed into a 
smooth paste with a heaped table-spoonful of flour. 
Add this to the stew, with a bunch of sweet mar- 
joram chopped fine, and a sprig of chopped parsley. 
If approved, add a small onion pared and sliced 
very thin. Cover it closely, and let it stew another 
kalf hour. Then send it to table. This is a family 
dish. Any fresh fish may be stewed thus. 

■ SPICED FISH.— Cold fish that has been 1-eft 
vet dinner is very nice to put away for the supper 
table. It should be fi^esh salmon, fresh cod, rock- 
fish, halibut, or the remains of any other large fine 
fish. Take out the back bone, and cut the flesh 
into moderate sized pieces. Lay it in a deep dish 
*ihat has a cover. Season the fish with cayenne 
pepper, a little salt, some grated nutmeg, and some 
blades of mace ; also some wliole black pepper- 
corns, and pour over it plenty of good cider vine 
gar. Tarragon vinegar will be an improvement 
Cover it closely, and set it in a cold place till 
wanted. If m spring or summer, set it in ice. 

We do not recommend cloves or allspice. The 
taste of thuise oo£j*&8 »pioete, is so overpowering^

^and to many persons so unpleasant,) that they are 
now nearly out of use at good tables. 

Nutmeg, mace and ginger, will be found much ]>et- 
ter, and with cinnamon occasionally, are sufficient 
tor all spice seasonings. Nevertheless, for those 
who like them, a few cloves will relieve the insipi- 
dity of halibut. 

FISH CAKES.— Take codfish (either fresh oi 
salt) that has been boiled the day before. Care 
fully remove the bones, and mince the flesh. Mis 
with it a quantity of warm mashed potatos, 
(mashed with butter and milk) in the proportion 
of one third codfish, and two thirds mashed pota- 
tos. Add sufficient beaten egg to make the whole 
into a smooth paste. Season it with cayenne; and, 
if the mixture seems dry, moisten and enrich it 
With a little butter. Make it into cakes about an 
inch thick, and as large round as the top of a com- 
mon sized tea-cup. Or into round balls. Sprinkle 
them well with flour. 

Fry them in lard, or beef-drippings. When one 
^ide is done turn them over. Drain them, and send 
them to the breakfast table. If approved, you may 
add to the mixture two or three onions boiled and 
minced. Any large cold fish may be dressed in this 
manner for next morning's breakfast. 

ROCK-FTSII. — Eock-fish are generally plain 
boiled, (with the heads and tails left on,) and they 
are eaten with egg sauce, (hard boiled eggs chopped, 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 83 

and mixed with melted or drawn butter,) seasoned 
with a little cayenne. Put on the side of your 
plate, any nice fish sauce from the castors. Some 
serve up rock-fish with hard boiled eggs, cut into 
halves, and laid closely in a row along the back of 
the fish ; half an egg being helped to each person. 
Cold butter is then eaten with it. We think this 
a very nice way. 

Blue fish, white fish, and black fish, may be 
rlrest in this manner. Also, sea-bass. 

■» 



BLACK FISH AND SEA-BASS— Are «,^ 
foiled in the same manner, having first carefully 
scaled, and drawn, and well washed them. In 
irawing fish take care that the whole of the in 
side is nicely scraped from the back-bone, all along 
When ready, dredge r^ clean soft cloth with flour, 
wrap the fish in it ; lay it on the strainer of a fish- 
kettle, and put it in plenty of water, into which 
has been thrown a small table-spoonful of salt. 
Keep it steadily boiling near half an hour. Take 
it carefully out of the cloth, drain it on the 
strainer, and keep it warm. Send to table with it 
egg- sauce. 

Eat mashed potatos with it. 

Frying. — To fry the above fish, — cut them in 
two or three pieces; wash them and wipe them 
dry; score them with deep cuts, and season with 
cayenne and a little salt — dredge them with flour, and 
fry them brown in a pan nearly fu.ll of boiling lard 

Any fish may be fried in this manner. 



84 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

FRESH COD.— A fine codfish should be very 
thick about the neck ; the eyes lively ; the gills 
red; and the flesh firm and white. If flabby, it is 
aot good. It is in season from October till May, 
After scaling, emptying, washing, and drying, cover 
it, and let it rest for an hour. Then put it on 
in a fish-kettle of cold water, (hard water if you can 
procure it,) throw in a small handful of salt, and 
let the cod heat gradually, skimming it well. Boil 
't gently, but steadily, till thoroughly done. Then, 
take it out of the kettle, drain it, and keep it warm 
till ready to go to table. No fish should be allowed 
to remain in the water after the boiling is quite 
over. Serve it up with oyster or lobster sauce. 

You may broil fresh cod in steaks, or fry it in 
cutlets. For frying fish, you may us^. beef or veal 
drippings, with the fat skimmed off carefully. 
Mutton fat (which is tallow) is unfit for all cookery.

TROUT. — Trout is considered a very nice fish, 
and is in season in the summer. When fresh it is 
a fine flesh color, and its spots are very bright. To 
fry trout, dry them in a cloth. Score them deeply, 
and touch each incision or cut with a little cayenne. 
Dredge them with flour. Grate some bread-crumbs 
rery fine, and in another pan beat some eggs ver^ 
Lght and thick. Dip each fish twice in the eg^

STEWED TROUT.— This is a dish for com 
pany. Mix together as much cold water and sweet 
white wine, in equal quantities, as will well cover 
the fish. When done, take them out of the stew 
pan, drain them, and keep them hot while you 
prepare the gravy. For this, thicken the liquid 
with a piece of fresh butter divided mto four, each 
oit rolled in flour; and add two or more well- 
>eaten eggs, and season with powdered mace and 
nutmeg. Mix all this togethe-r, give xt one boil

soned with cayenne and mace. Inclose each fish 
in a white paper, cut larger than to fit exactly. 
Fasten the papers with strings or pins, to be re-

SALT COD.— The afternoon before tlie fish b 
tf be eaterij put it to soak in plenty of cold water. 
Coyer it, and let it stand in a warm place all night- 
In the morning pour off' that water, wash the fish 
clean, and scrub the outside with a brush. Put it 
into a kettle with cold water sufficient to cover it 
well; and let it boil fast till near dinner time 
skimming it well. About half an hour before din 
ner, pour off' this boiling water, and substitute a 
sufficiency of cold. In this hist water give the fish 
one boil up. Send it to table with egg sauce, made 
with plenty of butter, and hard-boiled eggs cut 
in half, and laid closely along the back of the fish, 
to be helped with it. Accompany the cod with a 
plate of sliced beets 'drest with vinegar. 

Next morning yoa ma}* take what is left, and 
having removed all the bone, mince the fish, aud 
mix it with an equal quantity of mashed potatos, 
adding some butter, pepper, and raw egg. Make 
the whole into balls or flat cakes, and fry theiii xd 
drippings or lard. They are good at breakfast. 
On every one put a small spot of pepper.

FRIED SMELTS.— The smelt is a very nice 
little fish, which has a peculiarly sweet and delicate 
flavor of its own, that requires, to be tasted in 
perfection, no other cooking than plain broiling or 
frying in fresh lard. Do not wash them, but wipe 
them :lry in a clean cloth ; having opened and 
drawn them, (they should be drawn through the 
gills,) and cut off* the heads and tails dredge them 



MtSS LESLIE'S NEW C06K BOO^. 87 

with flour. The frying-pan must be more than 
two -thirds full 3f boiling lard ; boiling hard when 
the smelts are put in, so as to float them on the 
surface. If there is not sufficient lard, or if it is 
not boiling, the fish will sink and be dark colored, 
and greasy. About ten minutes are suffircient for 
the small ones, and fifteen for those of a larger siz& 
When done, drain off the lard and send them to 
the breakfast table on a hot dish. 

If you pi efer retaining the heads and tails, dish 
them, alternately, with the heads up and tails 
down.

FEIED CAT-FISH.— Ihe best cat-fish are the 
small ones. If too large, they are generally coarse 
and strong. They must be cooked quite fresh ; if 
possible, directly out of the water. They are very 
popular at fishing parties. Wash and clean them, 
cutting off their heads and tails, and removing the 
upper part of the back-bone, near the shoulders. 
Score them along the back, with deep gashes oi 
incisions. Dredge them with flour, and fry them 
in plenty of lard, boiling fast when the cat-fish are 
put into the pan. Or, you may fry them in the 
drippings or gravy saved from roast beef, or veal 
Q^hey are very nice dipped in a batter of beaten 
egg and grated bread-crumbs, or they may be don?

very sliyhlly, with a little cayenne before they go to 
table. 

Cat-fish are a breakfast dish, and are also eaten 
at supper. Porgie and tutaug are cooked in this 
manner. 

A ny fish may be fried as above, when not split 
open. 

FINE CHOWDER.— This is Commodore Sto- 
ven's receipt : — Take four table-spoonfuls of min- 
ced onions that have been fried with slices of salt 
pork ; two pilot-biscuits broken up ; one table- 
spoonful of minced sweet marjoram and one of 
sweet basil ; a quarter of a bottle of mushroom 
catchup; half a bottle of port wine; half a nut- 
meg grated ; a few cloves, and mace, and pepper- 
corns ; six pounds of fresh cod, and sea bass, cut 
in slices. Put the whole into a pot wl'th water 
enough to cover it about an inch. Boil it steadily 
for an hour, carefully stirring it. Serve it up hot 
in a large deep dish. 

Chowder may be made as above, substituting 
clams for the cod. The clams must be chopped 
small. You may, for variety, make chowder with 
oysters, or with boiled lobsters, or crabs ; always be- 
ginning the mixture with pork fried with onions 



-«<vs/s^# ■^'#^s/v\<>~. 



YANKEE CHOWDER.— Having sliced very 
thin some salt fat pork, season it with pepper, lay 
it in the bottom of a large iron pot, set it over t^'e 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 89 

fire, and let it fry. When done, take out the ]»ork, 
leaving the liquid fat in the bottom. Next, peel 
and slice some onions, and lay them on the fat. 
Pour in sufficient clam or oyster liquor to stew the 
onions. Have ready a sufficient quantity of sea- 
bass, black fish, tutaug, porgie, haddock, or fresh 
cod. Cut the fish in small pieces, and put it into 
the pot. Add plenty of potatos pared and quar- 
tered. Then some clam liquor; and lastly, some 
crackers, (soaked and split,) or some soda biscuit; 
the crackers to cover the top. If you wish to fill 
a large pot, repeat all these ingredients, arranging 
them in layers. If there is not gravy enough, add 
some boiling milk, poured in at the last, and en- 
riched with bits of butter mixed with flour. Cover 
tne pot closely, and let it stew half an hour, or 
more, till all the contents are thoroughly done. 
You may bake the chowder in an iron oven, over 
a wood fire, heaping live coals on the oven lid. 



»AA/S^^ •^v*^\A^S«>^ 



CLAM CHOWDER.— Put into boiling water 
from fifty to a hundred of the small sand clams ; and 
when all their shells have opened, take them out, as 
they are then sufficiently boiled. Extract all the 
hard, or tough, uneatable part, and throw it away. 
Slice thin as much salt pork as, when fried in the 
bottom of a large pot, will produce half a pint of 
liquid or gravy. Take out all the pork, leaving 
the liquid in the pot. Add to it a layer of clams. 
Then a layer of biscuit soaked in mills: or warm 
water. Next another layer of clams ; then ai>

other layer of soaked biscuit ; then more clarna. 
Season it with pepper and mace. If there is no 
objection to onions, add three or four boiled and 
sliced, and some minced majoram. Also, soma 
potatos, boiled, peeled, and quartered. Let the 
last layer be clams, and then cover the whole with 
a good paste, and bake it in an iron oven, or boil 
it in an iron pot. 

Chowder of fresh codfish, halibut, sea-bass, or 
any other good fish, is made as above. Halibut 
requires a much larger portion of seasoning, and 
a little more pork. Though very large and there- 
fore very profitable, it is in itself the most taste- 
less of all fish. Plain boiled halibut is not worth 
eating. 

SALMON. — In choosing a salmon, see that the 
gills are a fine red, the eyes full, the scales clear, 
and the whole fish stiff; the flesh being of the 
peculiar red known as salmon-color. Between 
the flakes is a substance called the curd, which 
gives it firmness. By keeping, this substance 
melts down and the flesh becomes soft. A salmon 
can only be eaten in perfection on the sea- coast 
where it was caught, and on the same day. To 
transport it any distance, it must be enclosed in a 
box, and well packed in ice. In America, salmon 
is found in the greatest perfection on the coast of 
Maine, in the Kennebec. Very fine ones are 
brought to Boston market. They also abound on 
the coasts of California and Oregon. The Ame- 
xw^r s^mon is much, larger than those of Europe. 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 91 

It is so fine a fish that its own flavor is better 
than any that can be communicated except by 
the most simple sauce. It requires as much 
be ling as meat, that is, a quarter of an hour for 
eve-ry pound. It is in season from May till Au 
gust or September. 

The lake salmon is good, but inferior to thai 
of the ocean, in size, richness, and color. 

In boiling a large fish, to judge if it is done, 
draw up the strainer or fish-plate, and with a tJiin 
knife try if the flesh separates easily from the bone. 
If yoa can loosen it immediately, it is cooked 
enoujjh. - It injures a fish to let it get cool in th(? 
water. 

BOILED SALMON.— After carefully empty- 
ing the salmon, wash it very clean from the blood 
inside, and remove the scales. To preserve t)ie 
fine color of the salmon, or to set the curd or 
creamy substance between the flakes, it should be 
put into boiling water, allowing to a gallon of 
water a handful of salt. After the water has been 
boiling a few minutes, and has been skimmed, put 
in the fish, (laying it on the drainer,) and let it 
boil moderately fast, skimming it well. It must 
be thoroughly boiled. Underdone fish of every 
kind is disgusting and unwholesome. Before it 
is taken from the fish kettle ascertain if it is 
sufficiently cooked, by trying if the back- bone 
easily loosens from the flesh. A quarter of an 
hour may be allowed for each pound, for a largo 
thick salmon requires as much cooking as meat 



92 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

When you. take it up, drain it well, and serve it 
u.p immediately. Have ready some lobster sauce, 
or shrimp, if moie convenient. To make it, mince 
the meat of a boiled lobster, mashing the coral 
with it, and mix it w'ith melted or drawn butter 
made very thick, and having but a very small 
portion of water. For shrimp sauce, boil the 
shrimps, take off their heads, and squeeze out 
their bodies from the shells. Thicken with them 
the drawn butter. Nothing should go with sal- 
mon that will interfere with the flavor of this fine 
fish, or give it any taste that will overpower or 
weaken its own. 

Many prefer salmon with nothing morQ than 
cold butter spread on after it is helped. We think, 
ourselves, that when the butter is very goo I, it is 
not improved (for salmon) by the addition of 
flour and water ; and a very little is suff cient. 
You need use nothing from the castors e>fcept 
cayenne. 

It is usual to eat cucumbers with salmon, and 
no other vegetables ; the cucumbers to be pj-red, 
sliced, laid in cold water, and dressed, and served 
up by themselves, with a little plate for each \ er- 
son, that the vinegar, &c., of the cucumbers nc ny 
not impart too much acid to the salmon. 

In places remote from the sea, a whole salmjn 
IS seldom seen at table but at dinner parties, or at 
good hotels. In a very hot climate it should d >t 
be seen at all. When in season, it can \e 
bought in any quantity by the pound, for a j«iM*U

ROASTED SALMON.— Take a large piece of 
fine fresh salmon, cut from the middle of the fish, 
well cleaned and carefully scaled. Wipe it dry 
in a clean coarse cloth. Then dredge it with 
flour, put it on the spit, and place it before a clear 
bright fire. Baste it with fresh butter, and roast 
it well ; seeing that it is thoroughly done to the 
bone. Serve it up pkin ; garnishing the dish 
with slices of lemon, as many persons like a littlo 
lemon-juice with salmon. This mode of cooking 
salmon will be found excellent. A small one, or 
a salmon-trout, may be roasted whole.

BAKED SALMON.— A small salmon n>ay be 
baked whole. Stuif it with forcemeat made of 
bread-crumbs ; chopped oysters, or minced lob 
fiter; butter, cayenne, a little salt, and powdered 
mace, — all mixed well, and moistened with beaten 
yolk of egg. Bend the salmon round, and put 
the tail into the mouth, fastening it with a skewer. 
Fut it into a large deep dish ; lay bits of butter 
on it at small intervals ; and set it into the ovon. 
While baking, look at it occasionally, and baste 
it with the butter. When one side is well 
b"ov/ned, turn ii carefully in the dish, and add 



94 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

more butter. Bake it till the other side is wel 
browned. Then transfer it to another dish with 
the gravy that is about it, and send it to table. 

If you bake salmon in slices, reserve the force- 
meat for the outside. Dip each slice first in beaten 
yolk of egg, and then in the forcemeat, till it ia 
well coated. 



BROILED SALMON.— Wash carefully all 
traces of blood from the inside of the fish. Cut 
it into rather thick slices, or fillets. Dry thera in 
a clean cloth, and dredge them with flour. Chalk 
the bars of the gridiron, or grease them with lard 
or suet, or the dripping of beef or veal, to pre- 
vent the fish from sticking. Let the fire be a bed 
of clear bright hot coals. Broil the slices well on 
both sides ; and when done, transfer them to a 
hot dish, and lay a bit of fresh butter on each, 
and season them a little with cayenne. 

Fresh codfish may be cut into steaks, and broiled 
a3 above. 

Also halibut, or any other large fish. 

Serve up shrimp or lobster sauce, with all cut 
lets or steaks of large fish.

FRIED SALMON CUTLETS.-Having washed 
dried and floured the cutlets, put near a poun(i

' MISS LESLIE^S NEW COOK BOOK!. 95 

Shopped sweet-majoram, beaten yolks of eggs. 
and powdered mace — all well mixed. Dip each 
cutlet into this marinade twice over, and ?Ty them. 
There must be plenty of lard, so that the cutlets 
may float on its surface instead of sinking to the 
bottom, and becoming dark, heavy, and greasy. 
When they are done, take them up with a perfo- 
rated skimmer, draining off the lard as you do so. 
Lay them on a hot dish, and keep them hot till 
wanted. Serve up with them mashed potatos 
made into flat cakes, and browned with a sala- 
mander or red hot shovel. 

Fresh codfish cutlets may be fried in this 
manner. 

You may broil halibut as above. Halibut is 
too insipid for boiling.

PICKLED SALMON.— Clean a fine fresh sal- 
mon, and remove the bones. Cut off the head, 
fins, and tail. Fish, to be pickled, should (in- 
stead of washing) be wiped, and rubbed with a 
clean dry cloth. Cut it int-o steaks or cutlets. 
Put it into a stone- ware jar with a close cover. 
A broad low jar will be best. Sprinkle it with 
salt, and cayenne. Add some grains of whole 
black pepper, and some blades of mace, seasoning 
it highly w make it keep well. Fill up the jar 
with the best cider vinegar, set it in a moderate 
oven, and bake it till thoroughly done ; adding 
more vinegar, if it seems too dry. Then cover

several months.

BE9ILED FRESH MACKEREL.— Mackcrei 

cannot be eaten too fresh, as no fish spoils so soon; 
for which reason in England mackerel is permitted 
to he sold on Sundays. We have heard in London 
the fishwomen crying it about the streets on Sun- 
day morning before church time. And even then 
it is far inferior to mackerel taken immediately out 
of the sea, at the places on the coast. It is gene- 
rally broiled, as no other cooking seems to suit it, 
and draw forth its true flavor. Split your macke- 
rel, remxove the bone, and cut off* the heads and tails. 
Dredge them on both sides with flour, and sprinkle 
ti^e inside with black pepper and a little salt. Have 
your gridiron very hot, over a clear fire, and 
grease the bars with lard, or chalk them to prevent 
the fish from sticking. Broil them well on both 
sides, and when they are done, and very hot, lay 
fiome bits of fresh butter upon them. Cover to 
keep them warm, and send them to table as soon 
as possible. They are a fine breakfast fish, and 
gojd at a plain dinner. For sauce, cold butter is 
all that is necessary, but you may mix with it, 
chopped parsley, or minced fennel. At the best 
English tables, stewed goosehenits, pulped through

a sieve and sweetened, is the fashionable sauce foi 
broiled mackerel, or lemon-juice is squeezed pro- 
fusely over the fish. To this the lovers of fruit 
witli every thing, will not object. 

If a mackerel is fresh, the eyes will be full and 
lively, the gills very red, and the stripes or bars 
on the back a very dark color, (nearly black,) and 
strongly marked; and the body thick. If thin 
and flat below the shoulders, the eyes sunk, the 
gills pale, and the dark stripes dull and indistinct, 
the fish is unfit to eat. 



■"^f^^f^t^^^^ 



FEIED MACKEREL.— For frying, take smaL 
mackerel, as fresh as possible. Wash them, dry 
them in a clean cloth, and score them deeply in 
the back, making several deep cuts. Season them 
with a little salt and pepper. Go over them with 
beaten egg, and then cover them thickly with 
grated bread-crumbs ; which, for this purpose, are 
superior to Indian meal or pounded crackers. Fry 
them in boiling lard, and dish them hot. Send 
them to table with a dish of potatos sliced and 
fried in butter. 

Any fish may be fried in this manner. If large, 
cut it into pieces.

FRIED HALIBUT.— There is a great deal of 
eating in a halibut, as it is a fish of immense size, 
and has only the back bone. It is sold in pieces 
of any weight or quantity, ai-d is exceedingly white

and delicate in appearance. But it is so very m* 
sipid, that when boiled it has no taste at all. There- 
fore it is always broiled or fried, except at tables 
where economy is the chief consideration. If broiled, 
It is done in the same manner as any other large 
fish, but to make it palatable requires something* 
to give it a little taste. 

To fry halibut — take a piece from the middle of 
ihe fish, wash it very carefully, and dry it in a 
clean cloth. Then cut it into thick fillets, extracting 
the bone, which is easily done with a sharp knife, 
loosening the flesh from the bone, and raising it as 
vou proceed. Eemove the skin. You may also 
cut the fillets into slices about an inch thick. Sea- 
son with cayenne, and a very little salt Cover 
them slightly with nice butter. Have ready in. one 
pan plenty of grated bread-crumbs ; in another a 
sufQciency of beaten yolk of e,gg^ seasoned w^th 
powdered mace and nutmeg. Dip the slices first 
into the Qgg^ then into the pan of bread-crumbs. 
Do this twice over, to every slice. Have ready 
over the fire a hot frying pan fall of boiling lard. 
Put in the slices and fry them well. When one 
side is done, turn the other. When all are done, 
take them from the frying pan with a perforated 
skimmer, and drain them. Keep them hot between 
t~70 heated dishes. 

Cooked in this manner, the halibut will be suf- 
ficiently flavored and is a profitable fish. 

Instead of frying, the halibut steaks may be 
broiled over a clear fire, on a grooved gridiron. 
ELaving first buttered it, dip each steak, as above. 



MISS Leslie's N*EW cook book. 99 

in bread-crumbs and f^gg, and lay upon each eteak 
a large tomato opened, and stuffed witli a lorcemeat 
of bread-ccumbs seasoned with butter, pepper, and 
mace. This will be found a very nice way of 
cooking balibut. Fresh cod may be done in the 
same manner. 

Cold halibut is sometimes drest as salad for the 
tea-table. 

BOILED TUKBOT OR SHEEP'S-HEAD 
FISH. — Having cleaned and washed the fish, soak 
it an hour or two in salt and water to draw off the 
slime. Then let it lie half an hour or more in cold 
wau Afterwards drain, and wipe it dry. Score 
the bao. deeply with a knife. The whiteness of 
the fish Wi. be improved by rubbing it over with 
a cut lemon. The fish kettle must be large, and 
nicely clean. Lay the fish with its back down- 
ward, on the strainer of the kettle. Cover it well 
with cold water, (milk and water in equal portions 
will be better still,) and add a small spoonful of 
salt. Do not let it come to a boil too fast, and 
skim it carefully. . When the scum has ceased to 
rise, diminish the heat under the kettle, and let it 
simmer for about half an hour or more; not allowing 
it to boil hard. When the fish is done, take it up 
carefully with a fish-slice ; and having prepared the 
sauce, pour it over the fish and send it to table hot. 

For the sauce, mix together very smoothly, with 
a broad -bladed knifo, a quarter of a pound of fresh 
b utter, and two table-spoonfuls of flour. Pat them 
iauo a dean sauce-pan, and hold it over the fire.

and stir them till melted. Then add a large salt* 
spoonful of powdered mace, and as much cayenne 
as will lie on a sixpence. It will be much im- 
proved by the addition of some boiled lobster, 
chopped small. When the sauce has simmered 
five minutes, add very gradually half a pint of 
rich cream, and let it come almost to a boil, stirring 
all the time. After the fish is taken up, pour the 
sauce over it hot. Or you may send it to table in 
a sauce-boat. In this case ornaiTxent the fish with 
the coral of the lobster put on in a handsome 
figure. 

Another way of dressing this fish is, after it has 
been boiled, to set it on ice to get cold ; and then, 
having carefully removed the bones, cut the flesh 
into small squares, put it into a stew-pan, and hav- 
ing mixed the above sauce, add it to the fish, and 
let it stew slowly in the sauce ; but do not let it 
come to a boil. When thoroughly hot, take it up 
and send it to table in a deep dish.

FISH. — Having cleaned the fish, soak it an hour 
or two in salt and water, and afterwards wash it 
well through two or three fresh waters. Then dry 
it in a clean towel. Score it deeply across the 
back ; and then lay it in a deep white baking-dish. 
Mix together a large tea-spoonful of pov/dered 
mase and nutmeg ; add a salt-spoon of cayenne ; a

butter: and <.wo table-spoonMs of grated bread- 
crumbs. Stir this mixture into a pint of ricb 
cream. Pour this marinade over the fish, cover it, 
and let it stand half an hour. Then bake it in the 
marinade ; and send it hot to table. 

If the fish is too large to be baked whole, cut it 
into fillets, extracting the bone. 

Salmon-trout may be baked in this mann'er.

SEA BASS WITH TOMATOS.— Take three 
large fine sea-bass, or black -fish. Cut off their 
heads and tails, and fry the fish in plenty of lard 
till about half done. Have ready a pint of tomatos, 
that have been pickled cold in vinegar flavored 
with a muslin bag of mixed spices. Drain the 
tomatos well from the vinegar; skin them, and 
mash them in a pan ; dredging them with about as 
much flour as would fill a large table-spoon heaped 
up. Pour the mixture over the fish while in the 
frying pan ; and continue frying till they are tho- 
roughly done. 

Cutlets of halibut may be fried in this manner 
with tomatos : also, any other pan-fish. 

Beef-steaks or lamb-chops are excellent fried 
thus with tomatos.

BAKED SALMON-TROUT.— Having cleaned

pepper, powdered mace, nutmeg, and a little salt 
mixed well together. Then lay it in a deep baking- 
pan, turn the tail round into the mouth, and stick 
bits of fresh butter thickly over the fish. Put it 
mto an oven, and bake it well; basting it fre- 
quently with the liquid that will soon surround it. 
When you suppose it to be nearly done, try it by 
sticking down to the backbone a thin-bladed knife. 
When you find that the flesh separates imme- 
diately from the bone, it is done suflQ.ciently. 
5erve it up with lobster-sauce. 
Any large fresh fish may be baked in this way.

CREAM TROUT.— Having prepared the trout 
rery nicely, and cut off the heads and tails, put 
the fish into boiling water that has been slightly 
salted, and simmer them for five minutes. Then 
take them out, and lay them to drain. Put them 
into a stew-pan, and season them well with pow- 
dered mace, nutmeg, and a little cayenne, all mixed 
together. Put in as much rich cream as will cover 
the fish, adding the fresh yellow rind of a small 
lemon, grated. Keep the pan covered, and> let the 
fish stew for about ten minutes after it has begun 
to simmer. Then dish the fish, and keep them 
hot till you have finished the sauce. Mix, very 
emoothly, a small table- spoonful of arrow-root, the 
juice of the lemon, and two table-spoonfuls of 
Bugar, and stir it into the cream. Pour the sauce 
over the fish, and then send them to table.

STEWED CODFISH.— Take fine fresh cod, 
and cut it into slices an incli thick, separated from 
the bones. Lay the pieces of fish in the bottom 
of a stew-pan : season them with grated nutmeg ; 
half a dozen blades of mace ; a salt-spoonful of 
cayenne pepper ; and a small saucer full of chopped 
celery ; or a bunch of sweet herbs tied together. 
Add a pint of oyster liquor, and the juice of a 
lemon. Cover it close, and let it stew gently till 
the fish is almost done, shaking the pan frequently. 
Then take a piece of fresh butter the size of an 
Qgg ; roll it in flour, and add it to the stew. Also, 
put in two dozen large fine oysters, with what 
liquor there is about them. Cover it again ; 
quicken the fire a little, and let the whole continue 
to stew five minutes longer. Before you send it 
to table, remove the bunch of sweet herbs. 

Rock-fish may be stewed in this manner. Fresh 
salmon also. 



FEIED CODFISH.— Take the middle or tail 
part of a fresh codfish, and cut it into slices not 
quite an inch thick, first removing the skin. Sea-

STEWED n ALIBUT.— Cut the fish into pieces 
about four inches square, of course omitting the 
bone. Season it very slightly with salt, and let it 
rest for half an hour. Then take it out of tjie salt 
put it into a large deep dish, and strew over it a 
mixture of cayenne pepper, ground white ginger, 
and grated nutmeg. Lay among it some small bits 
of fresh butter rolled in grated bread. Add half 
a pint of vinegar, (tarragon vinegar if you have 
it.) Place the dish in a slow oven, and let the 
halibut cook till thoroughly done, basting it very 
frequently with the liquid. When nearly done, 
add a large table-spoonful or more of capers, or 
pickled nasturtions. 

llalibut is a very insipid fish ; but this mode 
of cooking will give it taste. 



STEWED ROCK-FISn.— Take a large rock- 
fish and cut it in slices near an inch thick. 
Sprinkle it very slightly wiih salt, and let it remain

vinegar, (tarragon vinegar will be best.*) Set it 
over a i^ood fire and let it cook about an hour. 
When done, take out the fish carefully, to avoid 
breaking the slices. Lay it in a deep dish that 
has been made hot, and cover it immediately. 
Have ready the beaten yolks of two eggs. Stir 
them into the gravy. Give it one boil up; and 
then either poor it over the fish, or serve it up in

Halibut, fresh cod, or any other large fish may 
be stewed in this manner.

TO KEEP A SHAD FRESH.— By the fol 
lowing process, (which we can highly recommend 
from experience,) a shad may be kept twenty -four 
hours, or indeed longer, so as to be perfectly fresh 
in taste and appearance. For instance, if brought 
fresh from market on Saturday morning, it may 
be broiled for breakfast on Sunday, and will seem 
like a fresh shad just from the water. Imme- 
diately on bringing it in, let it be scaled, cleaned, 
washed, split, and wiped dry; cutting ofi" the head

and tail. Spread the shad open on a large flat 
dish. Mix we-ll together in a cup, a heaped 
table-spoonful of brown sugar; a heaped tea- 
spoonful of cayenne pepper, and a tea-spoonful of 
fine salt ; and t-nen rub the mixture, thoroughly 
and evenly, all ^ver the inside of the fish; which. 
of course, must be. spread with the skin or out- 
side downvvard. Cover it closely with a large 
tin cover or with another dish, and set it imme- 
diately on ice or in a very cold place, and let it 
rest till next morning, or till it is wanted for cook- 
ing. Immediately before you put it on the grid- 
iron, take a clean towel and carefully wipe off the 
wnoce of the seasoning^ not letting a particle of it 
remain round the edges, or anywhere else. Then 
put the shad on a previously heated gridiron, 
c>ver hot coals, and broil it well. Butter it, and 
send it hot to table, where every one can season 
it again, according to their taste.

PLANKED SHAD.— This is the best way of 
cooking shad when in perfection, just out of the 
river; and it is much in use at fishing party 
dinners. A board or plank, about three inches 
thick and two feet square, must be provided for 
the purpose. This plank should be of well-sea- 
soned oak or hickory, and very clean. A pine 
board will very soon catch fire and burn ; besides 
communicating to the fish a taste of turpentine 
or rosin. Take a very fine shad, and (having cut 
off the head and tail,) split it down the bfick. 



M133 Leslie's new cook book. 10.7 

clean it, wash it well, and wipe it dry. S])riiikle 
it with salt, and cayenne. Stand up the board 
before the fire till it becomes very hot, and almost 
be«^ins to cnar. Then nail to the hot board the 
Bpread-open shad, with the back or skin-side next 
10 the plank, securing it with a few nails, not 
driven in so hard that they cannot easily be drawn 
out. Begin to roast it with the head downward. 
After a while turn the other end of the plank, so 
as to place the tail downward. Turn it frequently 
up or down, that the juices of the fish may be 
equally dispersed throughout. When done, butter 
it with fresh butter, and send it to table on the 
board ; under which, place a large dish or tray. 
Help it to the company off the plank. This mode 
of cooking a shad will be found superior to all 
others ; ^nd is so generally liked, that two at least 
will be required, one at each end of the table. It 
is much enjoyed by parties who have dinners on 
the banks of the river, and bespeak of the fisher- 
men shad just out of the water. 

Lake salmon may be cooked in this manner on 
a plank. Also, blue fish, and the lake white fish. 

At the principal household stores, shad- boards 
of oak are now to be purchased ready made. The 
cost is from a dollar to seventy-five cents. They 
are very strong and smooth^ and furnished with 
thick wires crossing the board diagonally. Behind 
these the fish is to slip in without nailing. They are 
much used, and we advise every house-keeper to 
get one.

SHELL FISH. 

TO CHOOSE OYSTERS.— Insert a knife, nDU 
if the shell instantly closes firmly on the knite. 
the oysters are fresh. If it shuts slowly and 
faintly, or not at all, they are dying, or dead. 
When the shells of raw oysters are found gaping, 
open they are fit for nothing but to throw away, 
and should not have been seen in the market, as 
^hey are quite dead and decomposition has com- 
menced. Clams the same. 



<«.</\/s/N^^'^^\^>A'vr'M« 



TO FEED OYSTERS.— When it is necessary 
K> keep oysters a day or two before they are 
eooked, they must be kept clean and fed, other- 
»vise they will die and spoil. Put them into a 
targe tub of clean water; wash from them the 
mud and sand, and scrub them with a birch 
broom. Then pour off that water, and give them 
a clean tubful, placing the oysters with the deep 
or large side downward, and sprinkling them well, 
with salt mixed with it, allowing about a pint of 
salt to every two gallons of water. But if you 
have a very large quantity of oysters, add to the 
salt and water several handfuls of Indian meal 
Repeat this QWQvy twelve hours, with fresh water 
and meal. Always at the time of hi(;h water, 
oysters may be seen to open their shells, as if in 
expectation of their accustomed food. If this b

carefully continued, they will remain plump and 
healthy for two days. 

Terrapins also, and other shell fish, should have 
the salt and water changed every twelve hours, 
and be fed with corn meal. 

1 urtle must also be well fed, and allowed salted 
water to swim in. 



^is^^^v^^'^^^s^.* 



STEWED OYSTERS.— Get two hundred or 
more fine large fresh oysters. Drain them from 
their liquor, (saving it in a pitcher,) and put them 
into a stew-pan with a quarter of a pound of 
fresh butter, and set them over the fire. When 
they have simmered, and have almost come to a 
boil, remove them from the fire ; and have ready 
a pan of very cold water. Take out the oysters, 
(one at a time, on a fork,) and put them into the 
cold water. This will plump them, and render 
them firm. Having saved about half their liquor, 
put it into the stew-pan, seasoned well with blades 
of mace, grated nutmeg, whole pepper-corns, and 
a little cayenne. Stir in half a pint or more of 
thick rich cream ; and if you cannot procure 
cream, an equal quantity of nice fresh butter di- 
vided into bits, slightly dredged with a very little 
flour. Boil the liquor by itself, and when it 
3omes to a boil, take the oysters out of the cold 
water, and put them into the boiling liquor. In 
five minutes remove the pan from the fire, (the 
oysters having simmered,) and transfer them to a 
ture^Q or 4^ep dish^ in the bottom of which has

FEENCH STEWED OYSTEES.— Wash fi% 
fine large oysters in their own liquor, then strain 
it into a stew-pan, putting the oysters in a pan of 
cold water. Season the liquor with a large j^lasa 
Dr half a pint of white wine, (sherry or Madeira,) 
the juice of two lemons, six or seven blades of 
mace, and a small grated nutmeg. Boil the sea- 
soned liquor ; and skim, and stir it well. When it 
comes to a boil, put in the oysters. Give them 
one good stir, and then immediately take them 
from the fire, transfer them to a deep dish, and 
send them to table. They are not to boil. 

Many persons consider this the finest way of 
cooking oysters for company. Try it. The oys- 
ters must be of the very best. 



■»*/^y/^^-^4 



FEIED OYSTEES.— For frying, take only the 
largest and finest oysters. They should be as 
fresh as you can get them. Salt oysters are not 
good for frying. Take them out of their liquor, 
carefully, with a fork, picking off whatever bits 
of shell may be about them. Dry them in a clean 
napkin. Prepare some grated bread-crumbs, or 
pounded cracker, or soda biscuit, seasoned with 
cayenne pepper. Have ready plenty of yolk of 
egg beaten till very light ; and to each egg allow 
a large tea- spoonful of rich cream, or of the beat

fresh butter. Beat the egg and cieam t»">gether 
Dip each oyster first into the egg, &c., and then 
into the crumbs. Kepeat this twice till the oys- 
ters are well-coated all over. Have ready boil- 
ing, in a frying-pan, an equal mixture of fresh 
butter and lard. It must come nearly to the edge 
or top of the frying-pan, and be boiling fast when 
the oysters go in ; otherwise they will be heavy 
and greasy, and sink to the bottom. Fry them 
of a yellow brown on both sides. Send them to 
table very hot. 

Oysters will be found much the best when fried 
in grated bread-crumbs. Cracker-crumbs form a 
hard, tough coating that is very indigestible, and 
also impairs the flavor. Use no salt in making 
the batter. Omit it entirely. It overpowers tho 
taste of the oysters. 



"VS/V/S^^^/^^^'^'*-* 



OYSTER FRITTERS.— Allow to each egg a 
heaped table-spoonful of flour, and a jill or small 
tea-cupful of milk. Beat the eggs till very light 
and thick ; then stir them, gradually, into the pan 
of milk, in turn with the flour, a little at a time. 
Beat the whole very hard. Have ready the oysters, 
that you may proceed immediately to baking the 
fritters. The oysters should be fresh, and of the 
largest size. Having driined them from their 
liquor, and dried them separately in a cloth, and 
dredged them with flour, set over the fire a frying- 
pan nearly fall of lard. When it boils fast, put in

As they are done, take them up, drain off the lard 
from the oysters, ajid keep them hot till they go to

ixactly followed.

CLAM FRITTERS.— Put a suf&cient quantity 
of clams into a pot of boiling water. The small 
sand-clam will be best. When the shells open 
wide, take them out, extract the clams from the 
shells, and put them into a stew-pan. Strain their 
liquor, and pour about half of it over the clams* 
adding a little black pepper. They will require 
no salt. Let them stew, slowly, for half an hour; 
then take them out ; drain off all the liquor ; and 
mince the clams as fine as possible, omitting the 
hardest parts. You should have us many clams 
as will make a large pint when minced. Make a 
batter of seven eggs, beaten till very thick and 
light; and then mixed gradually with a quart of 
milk, and a pint of sifted flour, stirred in by de- 
grees, and made perfectly smooth and free from 
lumps. Then, g:'adually, mix the minced clams 
with the batter, and stir the whole very hard. 
Have ready in a frying-pan over the fire, a suffi- 
ciency of boiling lard. Put in, with a spoon, the 
batter so as to form fritters, and fry them light 
orown. Drain them well when done and serve 
ihem up hot. 

Oyster fritters may be made as above : except 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. IIS 

that tbe oysters must be minced raw, and mixed 
into the batter without having been stewed. 

Soft-crab Fritters. — Use only the bodies of the 
crabs, and proceed as above. 



SCOLLOPED CLAMS.— Having boiled a quan- 
tity of small sand-clams till they open of them- 
selves, remove them from the shells. Drain away 
the liquor, and chop them small, omitting the 
hardest parts. Season them with black pepper and 
powdered mace, and mix them with grated bread- 
crumbs and fresh butter. Get some large clean 
clam-shells, and fill them to the edge with the 
above mixture, moistened with a very little of the 
liquor. Cover the surface with grated crumbs, and 
add to each one a small bit of butter. Set them 
in an oven, and bake them light brown. Send 
them to table in the shells they were baked in, 
arranged on large dishes. They are eaten at break 
fast and supper. Clams must always have the 
shells washed before they are boiled. 

Oysters are frequently scolloped in this manner, 
minced, and served up in large clam shells. 

Boiled crabs, also, are cooked, minced, and pre- 
pared in this way, and sent to table in the back- 
shell of the crab. 

A .1 these scollops are improved by mixing among 
them some hard-boiled eggs, minced or chopped; 
or some raw Qgg beaten. 



114 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

ROASTED OYSTERS.— The old-fashioi .dwai 
of roasting oysrters is to lay them on a hot hearth 
and cover them in hot cinders or ashes, (taking 
them out with tongs when done,) or to put them 
into a moderate fire. When done, their shells will 
begin to open. The usual way now is to broil them 
on large gridirons of strong wire. Serve them up 
in their shells on large dishes, or on trays, at oyster 
suppers. At every plate lay an oyster knife and 
a clean coarse towel, and between every two chairs 
set a bucket to receive the empty shells. The gen 
tlemen generally save the ladies the trouble of 
opening the oysters, by performing that office for 
them. 

Have on the table, to eat with the oysters, bread- 
rolls, biscuits, butter, and glasses with sticks of 
celery scraped, and divested of the greon leaves 
at the top. Have also ale or porter. 

Or, you may cake large oysters out of their 
shells, dredge them lightly with flour, lay them 
separately on a wire gridiron, and bfoil them. 
Serve them up on large dishes, with a morsel of 
fresh butter laid on each oyster.

ing with a close layer of bread on the top. Set 
this into a hot oven, and bake it, a short time only, 
or till it is well browned on the surface. Oysters* 
require but little cooking, and this bread has hac' 
one baking alrefidy. The liquid that is about th( 
bread is sufficient. It requires no more. 

Scolloped oysters may be cooked in large, clean 
clam-shells and served up on great dishes.

PICKLED OYSTERS.— Take a hundred fin^ 
large oysters — set them over the fire in their own 
liquor — add two ounces of nice fresh butter, and 
simmer them slowly for ten minutes; skimming 
them well. If they boil fast and long, they will 
become hard and shrivelled. Take them off the 
fire and strain from them their liquor; spread the 
oysters out on large dishes, and place them in the 
air to cool fast, or lay them in a broad pan of cold 
water. This renders them firm. Strain the liquoi, 
and then mix with it an equal quantity of the 
best and purest clear cider-vinegar. Season (if 
the oysters are fresh,) with a small tea-spoonfjl (*/

spoonful of powdered mace and nutmeg, miy^xl. 
Let tlie liquor boil till it is reduced to little more 
than enough to cover the oysters well. Put the 
oysters into a tureen, or a broad stone jar. Pour 
the hot liquor over them, and let them grow quite 
cold before they a-re eaten. You may give them 
a fine tinge of pale pink color by adding to the 
liquor (while boiling,) a little prepared cochineal.

to keep them from burning. Season them with 
cayenne, nutmeg, and mace, and a few of the green 
tops or leaves of celery sprigs minced small. Add 
a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, divided into 
bits, and laid among the oysters. To enrich the 
gravy, stir in, at the last, the beaten yolks of three 
or four eggs, or some thick cream or butter. Let 
the oysters stew in this gravy about five minutes. 
When the patties are beginning to cool, fill each 
with one or two large oysters. If you choose, you 
can bake for every patty a small round lid of pastrj , 
to be laid lightly on the top, so as to cover the oys- 
'iers when they go to table. For company, make 
a large quantity of oyster patties, as they are much 
Jik.ed. 

OYSTER LOAVES.— Take some tall fiesh 
rolla, or small loaves. Cut nicely a round «»• oval 



118 MISS LESLTE*S NEW COOK BOOK. 

bole in the top of each, saving the pieces that 
come off. Then carefully scoop out most oi the 
crumb from the inside, leaving the crust standing. 
Have ready a sufficient quantity of large fresh 
oysters. Put the oj'ste^'is with one-fourth of their 
liquor into a stew-pan ; adding the bread-crumbs, 
a large piece of fresh butter, so.ne powdered nut- 
meg, and mace. Stew them aboc't ten minutes. 
Then stir in two or three large table .spoonfuls of 
cream ; take them off just as they are oon^ing to 
a boil. If cooked too long the oysters will be- 
come tough and shriveled, and the cream will 
curdle. Fill the inside of your scooped loaves 
with the oysters, reserving as many large oysters 
as you have loaves. Place the bit of upper-crust 
carefully on the top of each, so as to cover the 
whole. Arrange them on a dish, and lay on each 
lid one of the large oysters kept out for the pur- 
pose. These ornamental oysters must be well 
.1 rained from any liquid that is about them.

OYSTER OMELET. — Having strained the 
hquor from twenty -five oysters of the largest size, 
m:nce them small; omitting the hard part or 
gristlo. If you cannot get large oysters, yoL 
should have fort}^ or fifty small ones. Br^ak into 
a shallow pan six, seven, or eight eggs, according 
to the quantity of minced oysters. Omit half the 
whites, and, (having beaten the eggs 'all very 
light, thick, and smooth,) mix the oyste"s gradu- 
ally into lueui, «:Mir.g a little cayouiKJ pepper, 



MISS Leslie's new cook book« 119 

And some powdered nutmeg. Put three ounces 
or more of the best fresh butter into a small fry- 
ing-pan, if you have no pan especially for ome- 
lets. Place it over a clear fire, and when the 
butter, (which should be previously cut up,) has 
come to a boil, put in the omelet-mixture ; stir it 
till it begin to set ; and fry it light brown, lifting 
the edge several times by slipping a knife under 
it, and taking care not to cook it too much or it 
will shrivel and become tough. When done, clap 
a large hot plate or dish on the top of the ome- 
let, and turn it quickly and carefully out of the 
pan. Serve it up immediately. It is a fine break- 
fast dish. This quantity will make one large or 
two small omelets. 

Clam omelets may be made as above. 

An omelet pan should be smaller than a com- 
mon frying-pan, and lined with tin. In a large 
pan the omelet will spread too much, and become 
thin like a pancake. 

Never turn an omelet while frying, as that will 
make it heavy and tough. When done, brown it 
by holding a red-hot shovel or salamander close 
above the top. 

Excellent omelets may be made of cold boiled 
ham, or smoked tongue ; grated or minced small, 
mixed with a sufficiency of beaten eggs, and fried 
in butter. 

BROILED OYSTERS.— Take the largest and 
finest oysters. See that your gridiron is very 
clean. Rub the bars with fresh butter, and set it 



120 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

over a clear steady fire, entirely free from smoke, 
or on a bed of bright hot wood coals. Place the 
oysters on the gridiron, and when done on ona 
side, take a fork and turn ihew on the other ; 
being careful not to let them burn. Put some 
fr3sh butter in the bottom of a dish. Lay the 
oysters on it, and season them with pepper and 
grated cutmeg. Send them to table hot. 



^■<^^^*V^^*»«■ 



OYSTER PIE.— Having buttered the inside 
of a deep dish, line it with puff-paste rolled out 
rather thick ; and prepare another sheet of paste 
for the lid. Put a clean towel into the dish 
(folded so as to support the lid) and then put on 
the lid; set it into the oven, and bake the paste 
well. When done, remove the lid, and take out 
the folded towel. While the paste is baking, pre- 
pare the oysters. Having picked off carefully 
any bits of shell that may be found about them, 
lay them in a sieve and drain off the liquor into 
a pan. Put the oysters into a skillet or stew-pan, 
with barely enough of the liquor to keep them 
from burning. Season them with whole pepper, 
blades of mace, some grated nutmeg, and some 
grated lemon- peel, (the yellow rind only,) and a 
little finely minced celery. Then add a large por- 
tion of fresh butter, divided into bits, and very 
slightly dredged with flour. Let the oysters sim- 
mer over the fire, but do not allow them to come 
to a boil, as that will shrivel them. Next beat the 
VoIks o'lly, of three, four, or five eggs, (id pro

portion to the size of the pie,) and stir the beaten 
egg into the stew a few minutes before you take 
it from the fire. Keep it warm till the paste is 
baked. Then carefully remove the lid of the pie ; 
and replace it, after you have filled the dish wicii 
the oysters and gravy. 

The lid of the pie may be ornamented with a 
wreath of leaves cut out of paste, and put on be- 
fore baking. In the centre, place a paste-knot or 
flower. 

Oyster pies are generally eaten warm ; but they 
are very good cold. 



'oMsrvsA^^ ^'>/^^V^#'~' 



CLAM PIE.— Take a suflacient number of 
clams to fill a large pie-dish when opened. Make 
a nice paste in the proportion of a pound of fresh 
butter to two quarts of flour. Paste for shell fish, 
or meat, or chicken pies, should be rolled out 
double the thickness of that intended for fruit 
pies. Line the sides and bottom of your pie-dish 
with paste. Then cover the bottom with a thin 
beef steak, divested of bone and fat. Put in the 
clams, and season them with mace, nutmeg, and a 
few whole pepper- corns. No salt. Add a spoon- 
ful of butter rolled in flour, and some hard-boiled 
yolks of eggs crumbled fine. Then put in enough 
of the clam liquor to make sufficient gravy. Put 
on the lid of the pie, (which, like the bottom 
crust, should be rolled out thick,) notch it hand- 
so melj, and bake it well. It should be eatei. warm.

SOFT CRABS.— These are crabs ttiac, having 
cast their old shells, have not yet assumed the new 
ones. In this, the transition state, they are consi- 
dered delicacies. Put them into fast-boiling water 
and boil them for ten minutes. Then take then? 
out, drain, them, wipe them very clean, and pre- 
pare them for frying by removing the spongy 
part inside and the sand-bag. Put plenty of fresh 
lard into a pan ; and when it boils fast, lay in the 
srabs, and fry them well, seasoning them with 
cayenne. As soon as they are done of a nice 
golden color, take them out, drain off the lard 
back into the pan, and lay them on a Jarge hoi 
dish. Cover them to keep warm while you fry, 
in the same lard, all the best part of a fresh let 
tuce, chopped small. Let it fry only long enough 
to become hot throughout. When you serve up 
oha crabs cover them with the fried lettuce. Stir 
into the gravy some cream, or a piece of nice fresh 
butter rolled in flour ; an i send it to table in a 
sauce boat, seasoned with a little cayenne. 

Soft crabs require no other flavoring. They 
make a nice breakfast-dish for company. Only 
the large claws are eaten, therefore break off as 
useless the email ones. 

Instead of lettuce, you may fry the crabs with 
parsley — removed from the pan before it becomes 
brown. Pepper-grass is still better.

TERRAPINS. — In buying terrapins select the 
digest and thickest. Like all other delicacies, 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 12.3 

the best are the cheapest in the end. Small poor 
terrapins are not worth the cost of the seasoning. 
A poor terrapin, poorly dressed, is indeed a poo! 
thing, and is always recognized as such, by those 
who are expected to eat it. Oet fine terrapins only. 
Put them into a pot of water that is boiling very 
hard at the time, and let them boil for about ten 
minutes. Immediately on taking them out, pro- 
ceed to rub, with a coarse clean cloth, all the skin 
from the head, neck, and claws — also, the thin 
shell, as it comes loose. Having washed them in 
warm water, put the terrapins into a clean pot 
with fresh water, and a table-spoonful of salt, and 
boil them again till they are thoroughly done, and 
the paws are perfectly soft. Eemove the toe-nails 
Some terrapins require three hours. When they 
are quite soft, open them carefully, remove the 
spongy part, the sand-bag, the gall, and the en- 
trails — it being now the custom to throw away the 
whole of the disgusting garbage, alwajT's tasteless, 
tough, and disagreeable to look at. Be careful not 
to break the gall, as it will give an unpleasant 
bitter taste to the whole. Cut into small pieces 
all the meat of the terrapins, put them into a stew- 
pan, (adding the juice they have yielded in cutting 
up, but no water,) and proceed to season them, be- 
ginning with cayenne and black pepper, to your 
taste ; aiso, a hand/ul of flour for the thickening. 
Stir all well together, and in a short time add 
four table- spoonfuls of cream, or fresh butter, and 
a half pint of Madeira or sherry to every four 
terrapins. If they have no eggs, make up som^

artificiallv ; crumbling the yolks of liard-bjrJlod 
common «ggs, mashed to a paste with a little nice 
butter, and then made into brxlls with beaten raw 
egg. Add plenty of these to the stew, and let the 
whole cook together for a quarter of an houi 
longer. Serve it up hot, in a w^ll heated coverec 
dish. 

Four fine large terrapins generally make on( 
dish ; and the above is the usual quantity of sea 
soning for them. 



»'^.A#^'^i/v/\/v/v^*»~ 



NEW WAY OF DRESSING TERRAPINS.- 
In buyin-g terrapins, select those only that are 
large, fat, and thick-bodied. Put them whole 
into water that is boiling hard at the time, and 
(adding a little salt) boil them till thoroughlj 
done throughout. Then, taking off the shell, ex- 
tract the meat, and remove carefully the sand- 
bag and gall ; also, all the entrails^ — they are 
disgusting, unfit to eat, and are no longer served 
up in cooking terrapin for the best tables. Cut 
the meat into pieces, and put it into a stew- pan 
with its eggs, and sufficient fresh butter to stew it 
well. Let it stew till quite hot throughout, keep- 
ing the pan carefully covered that none of the 
flavor may escape ; but shake it over the fire 
while stewing. In another pan, make a sauce of 
beaten yolk of egg^ highly flavored with Madeira 
or sherry, and p^rwdered nutmeg and mace, and 
enriched with a large lump of fresh butter. Stir 
this sauce well over the fire, and when it has 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 125 

almost come to a boil, take it off. Send the ter 
rapin to table hot in a covered dish, and the sauce 
separately in a sauce- tureen, to be used by those 
who like it, and omitted by those who prefer the 
genuine flavor of the terrapin whea simply stewed 
with butter. 

This is now the usual mode of dressing terra- 
pins in Maryland and Virginia, and will be found 
superior to any other. 

No dish of terrapins can' be good unless the 
terrapins themselves are of the best quality. It 
is mistaken economy to buy poor ones. Besides 
being insipid and tasteless, it takes more in num- 
ber to fill a dish. The females are the best. 



»*AAA^-^^^*S/^»xw»~. 



A TERRAPEST POT-PIE.— Take several fine 
large terrapins, the fattest and thickest you can 
get. Put them into a large pot of water that is 
boiling hard ; and boil them half an hour or more. 
Then take them out of the shell, pulling off the 
outer skin and the toe-nails. Remove the sand- 
bag and the gall, taking care not to break it, or 
it will render the whole too bitter to be eaten. 
Take out also the entrails, and throw them away ; 
as the custom of cooking them is now, very pro- 
perly, exploded. Then cut up all the meat of the 
terrapins, taking care to save all the liquid that 
exudes in cutting up, and also the eggs. Season 
the whole with pepper, mace, and nutmeg, adding 
a little salt ; and lay among it pieces of fresh 
butter slightly rolled in flour. 



126 MISS LF-SLIE^S NEW COOK BOOK. 

Have ready an ample quantity of paste, made 
in the proportion of a pound of butter to two 
large quarts (or pounds) of flour, or a pound and 
a half of butter to three quarts of flour, and rolled 
out thick. Butter the inside of an iron pot, and 
line the sides with paste, till it reaches within 
one-third of the top. Then put in the pieces of 
terrapin, with the eggs, butter, &c., and with all 
the liquid. Lay among the terrapin, square pieces 
of paste. Then pour in sufficient water to ste\^ 
the whole properly. Next, cover all with a cir 
cular lid, or top-crust of paste, bu.t do not fit it sc 
closely that the gravy cannot bubble up over the 
edges while cooking. Cut a small cross slit in 
the top crust. Place the pot, with the pie, over 
e:ood fire, and boil it till the whole is thoroughly 
done, which will be in from three Quarters to a? 
hour after it comes to a boil. Take care not to 
let it get too dry, but keep at hand a kettle of 
boiling water to replenish the pot when necessary. 
To ascertain if the pie is done, lift up w'th a fork 
a little of the paste, at one side, and try it low 
down in the pot. 

It may be much improved, by mixing among 
the pieces of terrapins, (before putting them into 
the pie,) some yolks of hard-boiled eggs, grated or 
minced. They will enrich the gravy. 

A pot- pie may be made, (a very fine one too,) 
of some of the best pieces of a green turtle. 



MISS LESLIE^S NEW COOK BOOK. 127 

A SEA-COAST PIE.— Having boiled a suffi- 
cient number of crabs and lobsters, extract all the 
meat from tbe shells, and cut it .nto aiouthfals 
Have ready some fine large oysters d.rained from the 
liquor. Cover the bottom and sides of a deep dish 
with pufif-paste; and put in a thick layer of crab 
or lobster, seasoned with a little c^iyenne pepper, 
and a grated lemon-peel. Mix it with some 
hard-boiled yolk of egg, crumbled fine, and moist- 
ened with fresh butter. Next, put a close layer 
of oysters, seasoned with pounded mace and grated 
nutmeg. Put some bits of butter rolled in flour 
on the top of the layer. Proceed in this mannei 
with alternate layers of crab or lobster, and of 
oysters, till the dish is nearly full. Then pour in, 
at the last, a tea-cupful or more of the oyster liquor, 
with an equal quantity of rich cream. Have ready 
a thick lid of puff-paste. Put it on the pie, press 
ing the edges closely, so as to unite them all round 
and notch them handsomely. Make a wreath of 
leaves cut out of paste, and a flower or knot for the 
centre ; place them on the top-crust ; and bake the 
pie well. While it is baking, prepare some balla 
made of chopped oysters; grated bread-crumbs; 
powdered nutmeg, or mace; and grated lemon- 
peel ; also, some hard-boiled yolks of eggs, grated. 
Ha\ing fried these balls in butter, drain them, and 
when the pie is baked, lay a circle of them round 
the top, between the border of paste-leaves and the 
centre-knot. 

This pie will be found so fine that it ought to 



128 MISS LESLIE -S NEW COOK BOOK. 

be baked in a dish wblch will contain a large 
quantity. 

TO DEESS A TUETLE.— The turtle should 
be taken out of water, and killed over night in 
winter, and early in the morning in summer. Hang 
it up by the hind fins, and before it has had time 
to draw in its neck, cut off its head with a very 
sharp knife, and leave the turtle suspended. It 
should bleed two or three hours or more, before 
you begin to cut it up. Then lay it on its back 
upon a table : have at hand several vessels of cold 
water, in which tu throw the most important parts 
as you separate them ; also a large boiler of hot 
water. Take off the fins at t-he joint, and lay them 
by themselves in cold water ; next divide the back- 
shell from the under-shell. The upper part of the 
turtle is called the calipash — the under part the 
calipee. In cutting open the turtle, be very careful 
not 10 break the gall, which should be taken out 
and thrown away; if broken, its bitterness will 
spoil all around it. Take out the entrails and 
throw them away. The practice of cooking them 
is now obsolete. So it is with the entrails of ter- 
rapins. Using a sharp knife, cut ofi' the fins care- 
fully, also the liver, lungs, heart, kidneys, &c. 
Wash them well, and lay them in a pan of cold 
water, the liver in a pan by itself. If there are 
eggs, put them also into cold water. Having ex- 
tracted the intestines, stand up the turtle on end, 
to let the Hood run out. Afterwards cut out all 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 129 

the flefch from the upper and under shells, and re= 
move the bones. Cut the calipee (or meat belong- 
ing to the under-shell) into pieces about as large 
as the palm of your hand, and break the shell. 
The calipash, or meat next the back-shell, may be cut 
smetiler — the green fat into pieces about two inches 
square. Put all the meat into a large pan, sprinkle 
it- slightly with salt, and cover it up. Lay the 
shells and fins in a tub of boiling water, and scald 
them till the scales can be scraped off with a knife, 
and all the meat that still adheres to the shells 
easily removed, as it is worth saving. Clean the 
fins nicely, (taking off the dark skin,) and lay them 
in cold water. Wipe the back-shell dry, and set 
it aside. Then proceed to make the soup. For 
this purpose, take the coarser pieces of flesh with 
the bone likewise. Put them into a pot with a 
pound of cold ham cut into pieces, and eight large 
calves'-feet (two sets) that have been singed and 
scraped, but not skinned. If you cannot conve- 
niently obtain calves'-feet, substitute a large fore- 
leg or knuckle of veal. Add four onions, sliced 
thin ; two tablespoonfals of sweet-marjoram leaves; 
a large bunch of basil ; a dozen blades of mace ; and 
a salt-spoon of cayenne. The ham will make any 
other salt unnecessary. » Pour on as much water as 
will completely cover the whole, and let it simmer 
fllowly over a steady fire during five hours, skim- 
ming it well. If after a while the soup seems to 
be boiling away too much, replenish it with a little 
hot water from a kettle, kept boiling hard for the 
ivaiDOS''. When it has simmered five hours, take 



130 MISS LESLIE^S NEW COOK BOOK, 

up tlie whole, and strain the soup tlirongli a sie"v© 
into a deep pan. Wash out the soup-pot with hot 
water, and return the strained soup t^ it, with the 
liver, &c., cut in small pieces, and some of the best 
of the meat, and a portion of the green fat. Have 
ready two or three dozen force-meat balls, the size 
of a hickory nut, and made of the usual propor- 
tions of minced veal, bread-crumbs, butter, grated 
lemon-peel, mace, nutmeg, and beaten yolk of egg. 
Put them into the soup, and let it boil an hour 
longer ; also the eggs of the turtle, or some hard- 
boiled yolks of eggs. After it has thus boiled 
another hour, add the juice and grated yellow rinda 
of two lemons, and a pint of Madeira. Boil the 
soup a quarter of an hour longer, and it will then 
be ready for the tureen. It must never boil hard. 
In the mean time, stew in another pot the finest 
of the turtle-meat, seasoned with a little salt and 
cayenne, and a liberal allowance of sweet-marjoram 
leaves rubbed fine, and mixed with powdered mace 
and nutmeg. Add a pound of fresh butter, cut into 
pieces and rolled in flour. When the turtle-meat 
has stewed an hour, put in the green fat, and add 
the juice and grated yellow rinds of two lemons, 
and a pint or more of Madeira, and let the whole 
stew slowly an hour longer. While the meat is 
stcAving, take the shell of the back ; Avash it clean, 
and wipe it dry ; lay a band of puft'-paste all 
round the Id side of the shell, two inches below 
the edge, and two incbop above it. Notch the 
paste handsomely, and fill the shell with the 
stewed turtle. Have ready the oven, heated ajs i/ 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 131 

for bread. Lay a large iron baking-sheet or a square 
pan upon four bricks (one at eacb corner) to ele- 
vate the turtle-shell from the floor of the oven. 
Place on it the shell with its contents, and let it 
bake till well browned on the surface. Send it to 
table with the shell placed on a large dish. At the 
other end set the tureen of soup. Have ready 
(on two side dishes) the fins stewed tender in a 
little of the soup, and the liver fried in butter. 

This receipt is for a turtle of moderate size, A 
large one will, of course, require an increased pro- 
portion of all the articles used in seasoning it — 
more wine, &c. In serving up turtle at a dinner- 
party, let it constitute the first course, and have 
nothing else on the table while the turtle is there. 

We have seen elegant silver turtle-dishes, repre- 
senting the back-shell of the animal, superbly 
chased and engraved, the feet for it to stand on 
being paws of silver ; and the fins having hollow 
places to hold the sauce. This was for the stew ; 
making a dish separate from the soup, which is 
always sent to table in a tureen. 



-•*M##X^^^^^/^^4^v« 



TUKTLE PASTY. — When the meat has 
been all extracted, scrape and wash the large back 
shell of the turtle till it is perfectly clean. Make 
a rich pufi'-paste. Roll it out thin, and line with 
it th<^ bottom and sides, in fact the whole of the 
back shell. Having prepared and seasoned th: 
best pieces of the turtle-meat, as in the preceding 
te^xibt, stew tl^em till thorouglily done, and ^erv

tender, and when cool, fill the shell "with them. 
Have ready an upper lid of the same puff-paste, 
rolled out rather thick. Cover the pie with it. 
Unite the edges of the upper and under crusts, very 
leatly, wetting your fingers with water. Then 
notch thetn handsomely all round, and cut a cross 
slit in the centre of the top or cover. Set it di- 
rectly into a rather quick oven. Bake the crust 
of a light brown, and send it to table hot.

LOBSTERS. — If you buy a lobster ready 
boiled, see that his tail is stiff and elastic, so that 
when you bend it under, it springs back imme- 
diately ; otherwise he is not fresh. If alive or 
unboiled, he will be lively and brisk in his motion 
when newly caught. The same with prawns, and 
orabs. 

The heaviest lobsters are the best. 

To boil a lobster, have ready a pot of fast-boil- 
ing water, very strongly salted. Put in the lob- 
ster head downward ; and if the water is really 
hot (it is cruel to have it otherwise,) he will bo 
dead in a moment. Crabs, of course, the same, 
A moderate sized lobster (and they are the best,) 
will be done in half an hour. A large one re- 
quires from three-quarters to an hour. Before it 
is sent to table, the large claws should be taken 
o5f, and laid beside it. The head also should be 
separated from the body, but laid so near it that 
the division is nearly imperceptible The head is 
aever eaten. Split the body, and lay it open aii 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 133 

the way down, including the tail. If there in a 
good dresser of salads in the house, the lobster 
may be served up ready dressed, in a deep dish, 
seasoned with the proper condiments, after being 
cut small or minced, heaped up towards the centre 
of the dish, and decorated with the small claws 
laid across on the top, with the addition of green 
celery leaves, or parsley sprigs. 



MV\/N^^'^VV^V/Wr~~. 



LOBSTER SALAD— (^k?-/?.)— Take a well 
boiled lobster. Extract all the meat from the 
body and claws, cut it up small, and mash the 
coral with the back of a spoon or a broad knife. 
Wash the best part of a fresh lettuce, and cut that 
up also, omitting all the stalk. Mix together 
the chopped l®bster and the lettuce, and put them 
into a salad bowl. Make the dressing in a deep 
plate, allowing for one lobster a salt-spoon of salt, 
half as much of cayenne, a tea-spoonful of made 
mustard, (tarragon mustard is best,) four table- 
spoonfuls (or more) of sweet oil, and three table- 
spoonfuls of the best cider vinegar. Mix all 
these together, with the yolks of three hard-boiled 
eggs, mashed to a soft moist paste with the other 
ingredients, adding the coral of the lobster. When 
they are all mixed smoothly, add them to the 
lobster and lettuce. If the mixture seems too dry, 
add more sweet oil. Toss and stir the salad with 
a box- wood fork. Also, the things should be 
mashed with a box- wood spoon. Cover, and sot 
it in a cool place til] wanted. It should be eattn

as soon as po8sible after mixing, as it becomes flat 
by standing. 

Plenty of sweet oil rendeis a lobster wholesome 
Still, persons who are not in good health, had beax 
abstain from lobster. 

You may add to the dressing, one or two raw 
yolks of eggs, beaten well. 



»*AA/^^^<^^sA'^»~- 



FIKE LOBSTER SALAD— (^A?:? is for com- 
pany) — Boil eight eggs for ten minutes, or till 
quite hard. Lay them in cold water, or cool them 
by laying bits of ice among them. When quite 
cold, cut each Qgg lengthways into four or six 
pieces, taking a bit off one end of each piece or 
slice. Cut up into long pieces the best part of a 
fresh lettuce, that has just been washed in a pan 
of cold water. Lay the lettuce in a dish, and sur- 
round it closely with the pieces of egg standing 
up on their blunted ends, with the yolk side out- 
ward, and forming a handsome wall all round the 
bed of lettuce. Upon this, pile neatly the bits 
of chopped lobster, finishing with the small claws 
i^tuck into the top. Have ready the dressing in 
a sauce-tureen. Make it of the beaten yolks of 
two raw eggs, and four table-spoonfuls of sweet 
oil, thickened with the mashed coral of the lob 
Bter, and the crumbled yolks of two hard-boile-J 
eggs, and season slightly with a little salt, cay- 
enne, and a spoonful of tarragon mustard. Finish 
with two table-spoonfuls of vinegar, and stir the 
whole hard with a box- wood j^poon or fork

Send it to table with the sauce-tureen, along with 
the dish of lobster, &c. Pour on each plate of 
lobster a portion of this dressing. Or, if you can 
obtain no lettuce, mix this dressing at once with 
the chopped meat of the lobster. Sm.ooth it in a 
pile on the dish, (keeping it towards the centre) and 
stand up the slips of hard egg handsomely sur- 
rounding it — the small claws decorating the top.

LOBSTER RISSOLES.— Extract all the meat 
from the shells of one or two boiled lobsters. 
Mince it very fine ; the coral also. Season it with 
a little salt and cayenne, and some powdered mace 
and nutmeg. Add about a fourth part of finely 
grated bread-crumbs ; and with a sufficiency of 
fresh butter or a little finely-minced veal suet, or 
some sweet oil, make it up into balls or cones. 
Brush them over with yolk of egg, dredge them 
lightly with flour, and fry them in lard. Intro- 
duce them as a side dish at a dinner party, or as 
an accompaniment to salmon. 

This mixture may be baked in puff-paste as 
little patties, or you may bake in a soup-plate an 
empty shell of paste, and when done, (having 
stewed the rissole mixture made moist) fill the 
cold paste with it, and serve it up as a lobster pie. 

In buying lobsters, choose those that are the 
heaviest and liveliest, or quickest in their mo- 
tions when touched. They are then fresh. The 
hen has the broadest tail and the softest fins.

LOBSTER PUDDING.— Take the emptj bac^ 

shell of one large boiled lobster, and all the best 
meat of two. Clean out the shell very nicely ; 
washing it, and wiping it dry. Mince the nieat, 
and mash the coral with it ; adding halY a dozen 
yolks of hard-boiled eggs crumbled among it, and 
season it well with powdered mace and nutmeg, 
and a little cayenne. Moisten it all through with 
plenty of sweet oil, and the raw yolks of one or 
two eggs, well beaten. Fill the shell with this 
pudding, and cover the surface of the mixture 
with a coating of finely-grated bread-crumbs. 
Brown it by holding over it a salamander, or a 
red hot fire-shovel. Send it to table in the shell, 
laid on a china dish. 

Small puddings may be made as above, of crab- 
meat put into several large crab-shells, and placed 
side by side on a dish. 

They may be eaten either warm or cold ; and 
they look well with green lettuce or pepper-grasa, 
disposed fancifully among them.

CRABS. — Crabs are seldom eaten except at 
the sea-shore, where there is a certainty of their 
being fresh from the water. They are very abund- 
ant, but so little is in them, that when better 
things are to be had, they are scarcely worth the 
trouble of boiling and picking out the shelL

vinegar The meat of two dozen crabs, when all 
is extracted, will make but a small dish. Season 
it with cayenne, mustard, oil, vinegar, and eat it 
cold ; or stew it wdth fresh butter, powdered mace, 
and nutmeg, and serve it up hot.

SHRIMPS.— Of all fish belonging to the lob- 
ster species, shrimps are the smallest. In Eng- 
land, where they abound, they are sold by the 
quart, ready boiled. The way to eat them is to 
pull off the head, and squeeze the body out of 
the shell by pressing it between your fore-finger 
and thumb. At good tables they are only used 
as sauce for large fish, squeezed out of the shell, 
and stirred into melted butter. 



LOBSTER SAUCE.— Take a small hen lob- 
ster that has been well boiled. Extract all the 
meat, and chop it large. Take out the coral, and 
pound it smooth in a marble mortar, adding, as you 
proceed, sufficient sweet oil. Make some nice 
drawn butter, allowing half a pound of nice fresh 
butter to two heaped table-spoonfuls of flo,ur, and 
a pint of hot water. Mix the butter and flour 
thoroughly, and then gradually add to them the 
coral, .so as to give a fine color. Then mix this 
with a small pint of boiling water. Hold the 
saucepan over the fire, (shaking it about till it 
simraers) but do not let it quite boil. Put in the 



138 MISS Leslie's j^ew cook book. 

chopped lobster, and let that simmer in the sauce 
ti»ll well beated. To allow it to boil will spoil 
the color, (which should be pale pink,) and may 
be improved by a little prepared cochineal. Or, 
yon may tie, in a small bit of thin muslin, a few 
chips of alkanet, and put it into the sauce, (tak- 
ing it out, of course, before it goes to table.) 
Alkanet communicates a beautiful pink color, and 
has no taste in itself. 

This quantity of sauce is for a large fish — sal- 
mon, cod, turbot, or sheep's head. There should 
always be an ample supply of sauce. It is very 
awkward for the sauce to give out, before it has 
gone round the company.

BEEF. 



EOASTING BEEF.— The prime piece of beef 
for roasting is the sirloin ; but being too large f^r 
a small family, the ribs are generally preferred, 
when there are but few persons to eat of it. So also 
is the baron, or double sirloin, undivided along the 
back. It is chiefly seen at great dinners. Except 
the sirloin and ribs, there are no very good roast 
ing pieces, all the rest being generally used for 
stews, soups, &c., and for corning or salting. Un 
less the animal is a very fine one, the inferior 
pieces are apt to be tough, hard, and coarse. The 
round is the best piece for corning or salting, and 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 139 

for cooking, as beef a-la-mode^ or convertiiig into 
what in England, is called rnmp-steaks. These 
steaks require a rolling-pin, before thej can be 
made tender enough for good eating, or good di- 
gestion. The finest and tenderest steaks are those 
cut from the sirloin. The meat of a young well- 
fed heifer is very good ; and that of an old ox, 
(that has done working, and afterwards been fat- 
tened well on plenty of wholesome food,) may be 
made of superior excellence. The lean of good 
fresh beef is of a bright red color, a fine close 
grain, and feels tender to the touch on pinching it 
between your thumb and finger. The fat is firm 
and very nearly white. The suet about the kid- 
ney, firm and quite white. If, on the contrary, 
the lean is coarse, tough, and of a dull color, and 
the fat scanty, yellow, and moist, do not buy that 
meat for any purpose. The same rules will apply 
to mutton. If the weather is so cold that the meat 
is frozen, thaw it by lying it all night or early in 
the morning in a tub of cold water. If thawed in 
water the least warm, the meat will spoil, and be 
rendered unfit to eat. Meat that has been frozen, 
requires a much longer time to cook, than if tiiat 
accident had not happened. All frozen animals 
must be thawed in cold water previous to cooking. 
Cold roast-beef is much liked in England. In 
America, where meat is more abundant, and 
therefore less costly, it is not considered a proper 
dish to place before a visitor; therefore, in our 
country, a large piece is seldom cooked with a view 
to next day's dinner. We prefer smaller piec^. 



140 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

always served up fresli and hot. Beef for roasting, 
should be well washed in plenty of cold water; 
then dried with a clean cloth. Prepare the fire, in 
time to be burning well, when the meat is put 
down. It should have plenty of hot coals, and no 
part of the fire black, ashy, or smoky, and the 
hearth swept very clean : for no sweeping must go on 
while the meat (or any thing else) is cooking. The 
spit should always be kept perfectly clean, when 
not in use ; and well washed, wiped, and rubbed 
immediately after using. Run it evenly into the 
meat, which will hang crooked if not well balanced. 
When first put down, take care not to set it at once 
too close to the fire, but place it rather more than 
two feet distant, that the meat may heat grad- 
ually. If too near the fire at first, the outside will 
scorch, and leave the inside red and bloody. Un- 
derdone meat (foolishly called rare) is getting quite 
out of fashion, being unwholesome and indigestible, 
and to most Americans its savour is disgusting. To 
ladies and children it is always so, and even the 
English have ceased to like it. It is now seldom seen 
but at those public tables, where they consider it 
an object to have as little meat as possible eaten on 
the first day, that more may be left for the second 
day, to be made into indescribable messes, with ri- 
diculous French names, and passed off as French 
dishes, by the so-called French cook, who is fre- 
quently an Irishman, 

At first, baste the meat as soon as it begins to 
roast, with a little fresh butter, or fresh dripping 
Baverl from yesterday's beef Then, when its own 



MISS LESLIIJ'S NEW COOK BOOK. 141 

fat begins to drip, baste it with tbat, all the while 
it is cooking. Grradually move it iiear«,r to the 
fire, turning the spit round frequently, so that the 
meat may be cooked equally on all sides. When 
it is nearly done, sprinkle it slightly, with a little 
salt. When it is quite done, and you take it from 
the spit, put it on a large hot dish, and keep it 
warm while you skim the gravy, thoroughly, so as 
to remove all the fat. Then mix in the gravy a 
small tea-cup full of hot water, and thicken it with a 
very little browned flour. Send it to table very hot. 

As a general rule, a sirloin, weighing fifteen 
pounds, will require about four hours (or more) 
before a good steady fire. K it has been frozen, 
it will take much longer. The fatter it is the 
more cooking it will require. When sent to table, 
place near it, a small sauce-shell of horse-radish, 
washed, scraped fine, and moistened with the best 
vinegar. Put a tea-spoon on the top to take it 
with. Pickles, and a bottle of French mustard, at 
good tables, are generally accompaniments to beef 
or mutton, whether roasted or boiled. 

The dripping of roast beef, after all the fat has 
been removed, and the basting of the meat is over, 
should be strained into a pan, and kept in a cold 
place, with a cover; and next day, when it is con- 
gealed into a cake, scrape off whatever impurities 
may still adhere to the bottom, transfer it to a 
covered jar, and set it in the refrigerator, or where it 
will be cold. The dripping of roast beef is excel 
lent for frying, for plain pie-crust, or for many other 
purposes. The dripping of mutton (being tallow) 



X42 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

is only fit for soap -fat, and will spoil any dxdb 
whatever. 

BKOILED BEEF STEAKS.— The best steaks 
are those from the tender-loin. Those from the 
round or rump require beating with a rolling-pin. 
A steak-mallet tears them and destroys the juices 
of the meat. Without beating they will generally 
be found too tough or hard for an American taste, 
though much liked in Europe, where tender-loin 
steaks are considered too expensive. But they are 
here so much preferred, that, on good tables, any 
others are seldom seen. Have all the steaks nearly 
of a size and shape, and about half an inch thick. 
Trim off the fat, and cut short the bone, or remove 
it altogether. Season them with black pepper, but 
sprinkle on no salt till they have done cooking ; as 
salt, if put on at first, hardens them. Set your grid- 
iron over a bed of bright clear coals, having first rub- 
bed the bars with a very little beef suet, or dripping. 
Not mutton fat, as it will give the taste of tallow. 

A beef steak cannot be cooked in perfection un- 
less over wood coals. To cook them before an an- 
thracite fire, on an upright gridiron, is moiv like 
toasting than broiling, and much impairs tho true 
flavor. A gridiroD of the usual shape, with grcoved 
or hollow bars to catch the gravy, is best of all. 
Broil the steaks well ; and when done on one side, 
turn each steak with steak tongs; or a knife and 
fork, and an inverted plate. 

If onions are liked, peel and boil a few ; d ain 
«md mince them, and sprinkle them thickly » ^er

the surface of eacli steak. When they are well 
done, take them off the gridiron, and transfer them 
to a heated dish, laying a small bit of butter upon 
it ; and put another bit of butter on the surface of 
each steak, having first sprinkled them with a 
very little fine salt. What there is of their own 
gravy, pour round them on the dish. Send it to 
table as hot as possible. 

The English custom of eating what is called rare 
or underdone beef or mutton, is now 1 ecoming 
obsolete. To ladies, especially, all food is disgust- 
ing that is red and bloody-looking — and physiciand 
have discovered, that nothing is wholesome unless 
well cooked. The introduction of French cookery 
has done that much good. 

The onions may be stewed in butter or gravy 
and served up in a sauce-boat, seasoned with nut- 
meg At the famous beef-steak club of London, 
each guest is furnished with a small raw onion, to 
take on his fork, and rub over his empty plate, 
just before the steaks are served up, which is done 
one at a time, and as hot as possible, being cooked 
in the room. 

FEIED BEEF STB AKS. — Sirloin steaks 
should be tender enough without beating. Rump 
steaks will require some; but do not beat them so 
much as to tear the meat and exhaust all its juices. 
We have seen them pounded almost into a mass of 
dry shreds, scarcely adhering together. Remove 
the fat and bone. Lay them in a frying-pan, with 
% little fresh butter dredged with flour and season 



144 MISS LESLIB^S NEW COOK BOOK 

them with pepper. Fry them brown, turning them 
on both sides. Have ready some onions, peeled, 
ivashed, and sliced. After you have turned the 
steaks, cover them with the sliced onions, and then 
finish the frying, till. all is thoroughly done, meat 
and onions, slightly sprinkling them with salt. 
The onions had best be boiled in a small sauce 
pan by themselves, before they are sliced and fried. 

Put the whole on one dish, the onions covering 
the meat. 

Mutton chops, or veal cutlets, or pork steaks 
may be fried in this manner with onions^ adding 
to them some minced sweet marjoram, or if pork, 
some sage. 

BEEF STEAK WITH OYSTEES.— Take 
very fine tender sirloin steak, divested of fat' and 
bone; cut them not larger than the palm of youi 
hand ; lay them in a stew-pan with some bits of 
fresh butter rolled in flour. Strain over them suffi 
cient oyster-liquor to cook them well, and to keep 
them from burning, and to make a gravy so as to 
stew, but not to boil them. Season them with some 
blade!^ of mace, some grated nutmeg, and a few 
whole pepper-corns. Let them cook till they are 
thoroughly done, and not the least red. Then put 
in some fine large oysters. Set the stew-pan again 
over the fire till the oysters are plump, which should 
be in about five or six minutes. If cooked too 
much, the oysters will toughen and shrink. When 
done, transfer the whole to a deep dish, mixing 
the oysters evenly among the meat. Before you

ifk. e them up, make some sippet or thin toast, m 
triangular or pointed slices, with the crust cut off 
Di}) the slices (for a mi-nute) in boiling water, 
then take them out, and stand them in a circle all 
roand the inside of the dish, the points of the sip 
jycts upwards. 

COENED OR SALTED BEEF.— For boiling, 
there is no piece of corned beef so good, and so 
profitable, as the round. A large round is always 
better and more tender than a small one, if the ox 
has been well fed. A small round of beef is gen- 
erally tough. In buying it, see that it looks and 
smells well, as sometimes beef is not salted till it 
begins to taint ; and then it is done, with a view of 
disguising its unwholesome and disgusting con- 
dition, which, however, will immediately be mani- 
fest as soon as it is put on to boil, if not before. 
Every sort of food, the least verging on decompo- 
sition, is unfit for any thing but to throw away or 
bury. It is not necessary to buy always a whole 
round of beef You can have it cut into a half, 
third part, quarter, or into as many pounds as you 
want. If very salt, lay it to soak in cold water 
the night before, or early in the morning. Half a 
round (weighing about fifteen pounds) will require 
about four hours to boil sufficiently. A whole 
round, double that time. It must boil very slowly. 
If it boils too fast at first, nothing will afterwards 
make it tender. The fire must be steady, and 
moderate, that the heat may penetrate ali through. 
'>lowly and ^iqually. The i>ot must be ke[)L closely 



146 MISS Leslie's new cook book 

covered, unless for a minute when the scum ia 
taken off, and that must be done frequently. The 
beef should, while boiling, be turned several times 
in the pot. It is much the best way to boil it 
without any vegetables in the same pot ; they im- 
bibe too much of the fat, particularly cabbage- 
Boil the cabbage by itself in plenty of water, hav- 
ing first washed it well, aid it a while in cold 
water, with the head downwards, and examined it 
well to see if there are no insects between the 
leaves. The leaves on the very outside, should be 
removed, and the stalk cut short. Tie a string 
round the cabbage to keep it from falling apart. 
Put it into a pot with plenty of cold water, and 
boil it an hour. Then take it out, drain it, and 
lay it in a pan of cold water, or place it under the 
hydrant, for the hydrant water to run copiously 
upon it. 

When the cabbage is perfectly cold, wash out 
the pot in which it was parboiled, or put it into 
another quite clean one, and boil it another hour. 
Then take it up, and keep it warm till wanted. 
Before you send it to table, lay some bits of nict; 
fresh butter between the inside leaves, and sprinkle 
on a little pepper. This is much nicer than pre- 
paring what is called drawn or melted butter to 
pour over the cabbage, and far more wholesome. 
Drawn butter is seldom well made, being fre- 
quently little more than a small morsel of butter, 
deluged with greasy water; and sometimes it ia 
nearly all flour and water. Cabbage cooked as above 
wUl b« found excellent, and be divested of the 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 147 

(^bbage smell which is to many persons ilisa 
greeable. 

Carrots are also an usual aocompaniment to 
corned beef. They should be washed, scraped, cut 
mt© pieces, and split, if very large; put into boil- 
ing water, and cooked, according to their size, 
from one hour to two hours. Before taking them 
up, try with a fork if they are tender throughout. 
When done, they are best cut into slices, a little 
cold butter mixed with them, and put into a deep 
dish, to be helped with a spoon. 

Parsnips may be dressed in the same manner. 

For a plain family dinner, corned beef, cabbage, 
and carrots, cooked exactly as above, with, of course, 
the addition of potatos, will, on trial, be found ex- 
cellent. 

Corned beef stewed very slowly, in a small quan- 
tity of water, (barely sufficient to cover the meat,) 
well skimmed, and with tbe vegetables done sepa- 
rately, is still better than when boiled. Mustard is 
a good condiment for corned beef — so is vinegar 
to the cabbage. Pickles, also; French mustard ib 
very fine with it. 

Next to the round, the edgebone is the best piece 
for boiling. The brisket or plate is too fat, and 
should only be eaten by persons in strong health, 
and who take a great deal of exercise. No fat 
meat should be given to children. Indeed there is 
generally great difficulty in making them eat it. 
They are right, as it is very unwholesome for them, 
unless the very leanest bits are selected from among 
tiitr*. mass of fat.

FKIED COEISrED BEEF.— This is a very 
homely and economical dish, but it .is lil ed by 
many persons. Cut thin slices from a cold round 
of beef, and season them with pepper. Fry them 
brown over a quick fire, and put them in a Covered 
dish to keep hot. Then wash the frying-pan, 
cleaning it well from the fat, and put into it plenty 
of cold boiled cabbage, cut small, and some^old 
carrots, sliced thin, adding some thin sliced suet, 
or beef dripping to fry them in. When done, dish.> 
the meat with the vegetables laid around it ; adding 
the gravy. This is the dish called in England, 
Bubble-and-Squeak, perhaps from the noise it 
makes when frying. It is only designed for strong 
healthy people with good appetites. 

It is sometimes made of salt pork or bacon; 
pliced potatos being added to the cabbage.

' DEIED AND SMOKED BEEF.— For this 
purpose have as much as you want cut off from a 
fine round. Mix together two ounces of saltpetre, 
(finely pounded) rub it into the meat, cover it, and 
let it stand a day. Then mix together half a pound 
of bay-salt, an ounce of black pepper, half an ounce 
of ground ginger, and an ounce of pounded mace, 
and a quarter of an ounce of powdered cloves. Rub 
this mixture well into the beef put it into a deep

It every day. Then hang it up in a smoke-lioust', 
and smoke it over a fire made of corn-cobs, ci 
maple chips. Never use pine for sm-oking. 

It may be eaten chipped at tea, or what is much 
better, stewed and Vvrarmed in a skillet. Yenison 
may be spiced, dried, and smoked in the same 
manner, 

TO STEW SMOKED BEEF.— Having chip- 
ped it thin, put it into a skillet, with fresh butter, 
pepper, and two or three beaten yolks of eggs. 
^' Let it stew till the beef is crisp and curled up. 

Never allow yourself to be persuaded to use 
pyroligneous acid in curing dried beef or ham — 
instead of the real smoke of a wood fire. It com^ 
municates a taste and smell of kreosote, and is a 
detestable substitute, detected in a moment.

A SPICED ROUND OF BEEF.— Take a large 
prim-e round of beef; extract the bone, and close 
the hole. Tie a tape all round it to keep it firm. 
Take four ounces of finely powdered saltpetre, and 
rub it well into the beef. Put the meat into a very 
clean pickling-tub that has a close-fitting cover, 
and let it rest for two days. Next rub it thoroughly 
with salt, ;md return it to the tub for eight daya. 
Then take an ounce of powdered mace, a larg€ 
nutmeg powdered, a half-ounce oiP pepper, and a 
quarter of an ounce of powdered cloves, (not more.) 



150 MISS: LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

Mix tbese spices well together, and then mix them 
with a pound of fine brown sugar. Kub the spices 
and sugar thoroughly all over the beef, whicn will 
be ready to cook next day. Then fill the opening 
vyith minced sweet herbs, sweet basil, and sweet 
marjoram, laid in loosely aod lightly. Take half 
a pound of nice beef-suet. Divide it in two, and 
flatten each half of the suet by beating it with a 
rolling-pin. Lay it in a broad earthen pan, with 
one sheet of suet under the meat, and the other 
pressed over it. Above this place a sheet of clean 
white paper, and over all put a large plate. Set it 
in a hot oven, and bake it five hours or more, till 
by probing it to the bottom, with a sharp knife, 
you find it thoroughly cooked. It is excellent as 
a cold standing dish, for a large family. When it 
is to be eaten cold, boil fresh cabbage to go with it. 
Also parsnips and carrots. 

Cabhage. — For this beef, red cabbage is very nice, 
cut small, and stewed with butter and tarragon 
vinegar. 

A-LA-MODE BEEF.— Eem-ove the bone from 
a fine round of fresh beef, and also take off the fat. 
For a round that weighs ten pounds, make season- 
ing or stuf&ng in the follov/ing proport«ions. Half 
a pcund of beef suet ; half a pound of g rated bread- 
crumbs ; the crumbled yolks of three hard-boiled 
eggs ; a large bundle of sweet marjoram, the leaves 
chopped; another of sweet basil; four onion? 
minced small, a large table-spoonfal of mixed mace 
^^ nutmeg powdered. Season slightly with, sab

And cayenixe. Stuff this mixture into the place 
from whence you took out the bone. Make uumer- 
ous deep cuts or incisions about the meat, and staff 
them also. Skewer the meat into a proper shape, 
and secure its form by tying it round wdth tape- 
Put it into a clean iron oven or bake- pan, and pour 
over it a pint of port wine. Put on the lid, and 
bake the beef slowly for five or six hours, or till it 
is thoroughly done all through. 

If the meat is to be eaten hot, skim all the fat 
from the gravy ; into which, after it is taken off the 
fire, stir in the beaten yolks of two eggs. 

If onions are disliked you can omit them, and 
substitute minced oysters. 



BEEF A-JjAMODIE,— {Another way.)— Take a 
fine round of fresh beef, extract the bone, and fill 
the place from whence it was taken with a stuffing 
made of bread soaked in milk and then mashed up, 
butter, and some yolks of hard-boiled eggs crum- 
bled fine, the yellow rind and juice of a large 
grated lemon, sweet marjoram and sweet basil 
chopped small, with some powdered nutmeg and 
mace. Make deep cuts or incisions all over tlio 
outside of the meat, and in every cut stick firmly 
a slip of bacon or salt pork put in with a larding- 
pin. Bring round the flap and skewer to the side 
of the round, filling in between with some of the 
stuffing And pour round it a pint or more of port 
wme. Lay it in an oven, and bake it slowly till 
it is well done all through, which will require

some hours. Serye it up with its own. gruvy 
under it. It is more generally eaten cold, at a suppei 
party. In this case, cover it thickly all over with 
double parsley or pepper grass, so as to resemble 
a green bank. In the centre place a bouquet of 
natural flowers, rising from the green bank. 

French a-la-mode beef, or heef a-la-daube, is pre- 
pared as above, but stewed slowly all night in lard. 



BEEF BOUILLI.— Take from six to eight 
pounds of a fine round of fresh beef. Put it into a 
soup-pot, with the remains of a piece of cold roast 
beef (bones and all) to enrich the gravy, but use 
no other cold meat than beef. Season it slightly with 
salt and pepper, and pour on just sufficient water 
to cover it well. Boil it slowly, and skim it well. 
When the scum ceases to rise, have ready half a 
dozen large carrots, cut into pieces, and put tliem 
in first. Afterwards add six turnips, quartered; 
a head of celery, cut small ; half a dozen parsnips, 
cut in pieces ; and six whole onions. Let it boil 
slowly till all the vegetables are done, and very 
tender. 

Send it to table with the beef in the middle of a 
large dish ; the vegetables laid all around it ; and 
the gravy (thickened with fine grated bread-

TO STEW COLD OOENED BEER — Out 
about four pounds of lean from a cold round of 
beef, that tastes but little of the salfc. Lay it in a 
stew-pan, with a quarter of a peck of tomatos 
quartered, and the same quantity of ochras sliced ; 
also, two small onions peeled and sliced, and two 
ounces of fresh butter rolled in flour. Add a tea- 
spoonful of whole pepper-corns, {no salQ and four 
or five blades of mace. Place it over a steady 
but moderate fire. Cover it closely, and let it 
stew three or four hours. The vegetables should 
be entirely dissolved. Serve it up hot. 

This is an excellent way of using up the remains 
of a cold round of beef at the season of tomatos 
and ochras, particularly when the meat has been 
rather under- boiled the first day of cooking it. 

A few pounds of the lean of a fresh round of 
beef, will be still better cooked in this manner, 
increasing the quantity of ochras and tomatos, 
and stewing it six hours. 

Cold fillet of veal is very good stewed with to- 
matos, ochras, and an onion or two. Also, the 
thi^ik or upper part of a cold leg of mtttt kn; or 
of pork, either fresh or corned.

TO STEW SMOKED BEEF.— The dried beef, 
for this purpose, must be fresh and of the very 
best quality. Cut it (or rather shave it) into very 
•.hin, small slices, with as little fat as possible. 
Put the beef into a skillet, and fill up with boiling 
water. Cover it, and let it soak or steep till the 
wsLter is cold. Then drain off that water, and 
pour on some more ; but merely enough to cover 
the chipped beef, which yo'i may season with a 
little pepper. Set it over the fire, and (keeping 
on the cover) let it stew for a quarter of an hour. 
Then roll a few bits of butter in a little flour, and 
add it to the beef, with the yolk of one or two 
beaten eggs. Let it stew five minutes longer. 
Take it up on a hot dish, and send it to the break- 
fast or tea-table. 

Cold ham may be sliced thin, and stewed in the 
same manner. Dried venison also. 



*<v^/^/^/^■^^#^^/v«**• 



FRENCH BEEF.— Take a circular piece from 
the round, (having removed the bone,) and trim 
it nicely from the fat, skin, &c. Then lard it all 
over with long slips of fat pork or bacon. The 
place from whence the bone was taken must be 
filled with a forcemeat, made of minced suet, 
grated bread-crumbs, sweet marjoram rubbed fine, 
and grated lemon-peel; add a little salt and pep- 
per. Tie a tape closely round the outside of the 
beef, to keep it compact, and m shape. Put it 
into a broad earthen jar with a cover ; or into an 
iron bake-oven. Add some whole pepper, a large 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 155 

oni^^n, a buncli of sweet herbs, three bay leaves, 
a quarter of a pound of butter, divided into small 
bits (each piece rolled in flour,) and half a pint 
of claret, or port wine. Bake or stew it thus in 
its own liquor, for five, six, or seven hours, (in 
proportion to its size,) for it must be thoroughly 
done, quite tender, and brown all through the 
inside. 

STEWED FKESH BEEF.— Cut a square thick 
piece of beef from the round or sirloin, and trim 
off the fat. Put it into a stew-pan with just 
water enough to cover it, and season it slightly 
with salt and pepper. Let it stew slowly, till 
tender all through. Then add potatos pared and 
quartered, turnips the same; and also, parsnips 
split and cut short, and (if approved) a few sliced 
onions. Stew altogether till the vegetables are 
thoroughly cooked, and then serve up the whole 
oil one large dish. 

Mutton, veal, and fresh pork, m-ay be stewed in 
the same manner. Sweet potatos, scraped and 
split, are excellent served with fresh meat. There 
should be a great plenty of vegetables, as they 
are much liked in stews. What is called an Irish 
atew is fresh beef stewed with potatos only — the 
potatos being first pared, and cut in quarters. 

For economy, cold roast beef may be stewed 
next day with fresh potatos cut up, and as little 
water as possible. Cold potatos, if re-cooked, 
aro always ha:d, tough, and unwholesome. 



156 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

STEWED BEEFSTEAKS WITH OYSTEEb 
— Take some fine tender beef-steaks cut from the 
sirloin. If they are taken from the round they 
should be beaten with a rolling-pin to make them 
tender. Put them into a close stew-pan, with 
barely sufficient water to prevent their burning, 
and set them over the fire to brown. When they 
are browned, add sufficient oyster- liquor to cook 
*hem, and some bits of fresh butter rolled in flour. 
Let them stew slowly for an hour, or till they are 
thoroughly done. Then add three or four dozen 
of fine large fresh oysters, in proportion to the 
quantity of meat, seasoning them well with nut- 
meg, a few blades of mace, and a little cayenne. 
Cover the pan, and simmer them till the oystert 
are well plumped, but not till they come to a boil. 
When all is properly cooked, transfer the whole 
to a deep dish, and send it to table hot. 

The meat, when preparing, should be cut into 
pieces about as large as the palm of your hand, 
and an inch tbick, omitting the fat. Small clamg 
may be substituted for oysters. 



<*>AAA/^^'#^ ^^ ^ 



TOMATO STEWED BEEF.— Take large ripe 

tomatos, and scald them, to make the skins peeJ 
off easily. Pare, quarter them, and sprinkle them 
with a little salt and pepper. Lay in a stew 
pan some thin tender beef-steaks, lamb, mutton- 
chops, or cutlets of fresh pork. Bury the meat 
in the tomatos, and add some bits of fresh butter 
rolled in flour and a little sugar to take off the 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 157 

dxtreme aoid of the tomatos ; also, an onion or 
two, very finely minced. Let the whole cook 
slowly till the meat is thoroughly done, and the 
tomatos dissolved to a pulp. Send it to table all 
on the game dish. 

A rabbit or chicken, (cut apart as for carving,) 
is very good stewed with tomatos. Freshly killed 
venison is excellent for this stew. 

Many persons mix grated bread with tomato 
stew. We think it weakens the taste — a thing 
not desirable in any cooking. 

This stew must not have a drop of water in it ; 
the tomatos will give out sufficient liquid to cook 
the meat. There is not a more wholesome dish. 



•*n/^i*\*>-^« 



BEEF STEWED WITH ONIOI^S.— Take a 

square piece of beef from the sirloin, where there 
is no bone or fat. With a sharp knife make very 
deep incisions all over it, but not quite so deep 
as to cut it through to the bottom. ■ Prepare a 
forcemeat by peeling and boiling some onions. 
Then drain and mince them. Mix in with the 
onions some fine bread-crumbs, and some chopped 
sweet- marjoram, (seasoning with powdered nut- 
meg and mace,) and fill tightly all the incisions 
Put into the bottom of a stew-pan some drip- 
pings of roast-beef, or else a piece of fresh butter 
rolled in flour. Lay the seasoned meat upon it 
Let it stew till completely cooked, and no redness 
to be found in any part of it. Serve it up hot, 
and aeni it to table in its own gravy. 



158 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

A round or fillet of fresh pork may be cooket 
as above, putting into the incisions, or holes, pow- 
dered sage instead of sweet marjoram, with the 
onions and crumbs; and using lard instead of 
beef-drippings. Eat apple sauce with it. 



**/^N^#>^>/^ys<V»~- 



BEEF STEWED WITH O YSTEES. — Pre- 
pare two or three pounds of the best beef, by 
trimming off all the fat, and removing the bone. 
Lay in the bottom of the stew-pan a few bits of 
fresh butter rolled in flour. Then put in the meat, 
and sprinkle a little pepper over each piece. Have 
ready a quart of large fresh oysters. Strain the 
liquor to clear it from bits of the shell, and pour 
it over the meat in the stew-pan. Stew the meat 
in the oyster liquor till it is thoroughly cooked, 
skimming it well, and keeping it covered, except 
when skimming. Then add grated nutmeg, and 
a few blades of mace. Lastly, put in the oysters, 
and let them remain in just long enough to 
plump, which will be in a few minutes. If cooked 
too much oysters always shrivel, and become hard 
and tough. When all is done, serve up the whole 
in one dish. 

In the same manner clams may be stewed with 
beef. Never put any salt where there are clams. 
They are quite salt enough in themselves. 



FRENCH STEW.— Cut into pieces two or

mutton, veal, or pork, and peel and slice a quarter 
of a peck or more of ripe tomatos. Season the 
whole with a little pepper and salt. Add, if you 
shoose, a tea-spoonful of sugar to moderate ihe 
extreme acid of the tomatos. Put the whole to- 
gether into a stew-pot, and cover it closely, open- 
ing it occasionally to see how it is doing. Put no 
water to this stew, the juice of the tomatos wili 
cook it thoroughly. Add a large table-spoonful 
of minced tarragon leaves. When the tomatos 
are all dissolved, stir in a piece of fresh butter, 
dredged with flour. Let it stew about a quarter 
of an hour longer. When the meat is quite 
tender all through, and every thing well done, 
n.ake some sippets of triangular shaped toast, 
with the crust trimmed off. Dip the toast, for 
a moment, in hot water ; butter and stand it up 
all round the inside of a deep dish. Then fill 
it with the stew, and serve it hot. Any meat may 
be stewed thus with tomatos.

POTATO BEEF. — This is an excellent fa- 
mily dish. Boil some potatos till well done, all 
through. Peel them, put them into a large pan, 
and mash them smoothly, adding, as you proceed, 
dome milk, and one or more beaten eggs, weD 
mixed into the potatos. Eub the bottom of a 
white ware pudding dish with nice butter, or 
some drippings of cold beef, and cover it with a 
thick layer of mashed potatos. Next, put in thin 
slices of beef, (omitting the fat,) enough to cover 



160 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

tlie potatos. Next, add another layer of mashed 
potatos, evenly and thickly spread. Then, more 
thin slices of beef, and then more potatos. Do 
this, till the dish is full ; finishing it with potatos, 
on the top, heaping them up in the centre. Bake 
it in an oven. There must be plenty of potatos, 
as they will be much liked. 



«W^\A#^^.\#^^/Wv«». 



BEEF AND MUSHROOMS. — Take three 

pounds of the best sirloin steaks. Season them 
with black pepper and a very little salt, having 
removed the fat and bone. Put a quarter of a 
pound of the best fresh butter into a frying-pan, 
and set it over the fire. When it is boiling hot, 
put in the steaks, and fry them brown. Have 
ready a quart of very fresh mushrooms, peeled 
and stemmed. If large, cut them in four. Sea- 
son them with a little pepper and salt, and dredge 
them lightly with flour, and add a few* bits of 
butter. Stew them in a separate pan kept 
closely covered. When the steaks are done, pour 
the mushrooms over them with all their juice. Put 
them all (steaks and mushrooms) into a dish with 
a cover, and serve them up hot. 

This is a breakfast dish, or a side dish for din- 
ner Unless the company is very small, four 
pounds of beef steaks, at least, and three pints of 
mushrooms, (with butter in proportion) will be 
required at dinner, as it will be much liked.

BEEF'S HEAET.— Wash the heart welJ, and 
soak it in a pan of tepid water till all the blood ia 
drawn out of the ventricles, and it is made very 
clean and dry. Next par-boil it a quarter of an 
hour. Then stuff the cavities with a forcemeat 
made of minced veal, bread-crumbs, butter or 
minced suet, and sweet herbs, seasoned with a little 
pepper and nutmeg ; or it may be stufied simply 
with sage and onions. Sew up the openings with 
coarse brown thread, lest the forcemeat should fall 
out. Put the heart on a spit, and roast it before a 
clear fire, for near two hours; basting it well 
with nice fresh butter. Thicken the gravy with a 
little flour, and stir into it a glass of port wine, or 
of tarragon vinegar. Have ready a hot dish and a 
heated cover. Serve up the heart as hot as pos- 
sible, for it soon chills, and pour the gravy around 
it. The gravy should be heated to a boil in a 
small sauce-pan. 

Calves' Hearts are cooked in the same manner. 
As they are small, it takes four calves' hearts to 
make a dish. 

Hearts may be sliced and stewed with onions and 
Bweet herbs, adding to the stew a little salad oiL

BEEF PATTIES.— A nice way of disposing 
of underdone roast beef, is to mince fine all the 
lean, and a vei^y little of the fat. Season it with 
cayenne, and powdered nutmeg, or mace, or else 
iXhopped sweet herbs. K you have any stewed 
aiushroom-gravy; moisten the meat with that 



162 MISS LESLIE^S NEW COOK BOOK. 

Make a nice paste, and cut it into small circular 
sheets, rolled out not very thin. Cover one half 
of each sheet of paste with the minced beef (not too 
near the edge) and fold over the other half, so aa 
to form a half moon. Wet your fingers with cold 
water, and pinch together the two edges of the 
half moon. Then crimp them with a sharp knife. 
Lay the patties in square baking pans, prick them 
with a fork, and bake them brown. Or you may 
fry them in lard. Serve them up hot, as side 
dishes. 

Cold veal, minced with cold ham, or tongue, 
makes very nice patties; also cold chicken or 
turkey. 

A BEEF STEAK PIE.— Stew two pounds or 
more, of fine tender sirloin steaks, divested of fat 
and bone, and cut rather thin. Season them with 
a very little salt and pepper ; and, when about half 
done, remove them from the fire,, and keep them 
warm, saving all the gravy. Make a nice paste, 
allowing to two quarts of flour one pound and a 
quarter of fresh butter. Divide the butter into 
four quarters. Rub one half into the pan of flour, 
and make it into a dough with a very little cold 
water. Roll it out into a large sheet, and with a 
broad knife stick over it, at equal distances, one 
of the remaining divisions of butter. Then sprinkle 
it with more flour, fold it, and roll it out again 
into a large sheet. Put on the remainder of the 
butter in bits, as before. Then fold it again. Cut 
tbe paste into equal halves, and roil thero out iuta

MEAT PIES — May be made in the above man 
ner of lamb, veal, or pork. Also of venison oi 
any sort of fresh meat. Pie crust for baking should 
be shortened with butter, or with the dripping of 
roast beef, veal, or fresh pork. Mutton or lamb 
dripping are unfit for pie crust, as they make it 
taste of tallow. Suet will not do at all for hahed 
paste, though very good if the paste is to be boiled. 
Butter and lard will make a nice plain paste for 
pies, if both are fresh and good ; the butter to be 
rubbed into the flour, mixed with a little cold 
water, and rolled out ; the lard to be spread evenly 
all over the sheet ; then folded and rolled out again. 
Meat pies should alwaiys have a bottom crust, as 
the gi'avy it imbibes makes it very relishing. Veal 
pies are insipid without the addition of some cold 
ham. 

Pies made of game should have a puff-paste, as 
they are generally for company.

perfection. Pot-pies of these ducks are, of course, 
excellent. 

A BEEF STEAK POT-PIE.~Take two 
pounds or more of tender beef steaks, exclusive of 
the fat and bone, which must be omitted ; the steaks 
from the sirloin end, cut less than an inch thick, and 
not larger than four or five inches square. Put them 
into a pot with enough water to cover them, and 
season them slightly with pepper and salt. Dredge 
them with a little flour, and lay on each a morsel 
of Dice fresh butter. Stew the steaks for half aa 
hour. Meanwhile make a large portion of paste ; 
allowing to every quart or pound of flour, a small 
half pound of nice beef-suet, entirely freed from all 
its skin and strings, and minced with a chopper hj 
finely as possible. To three pounds of beef allo^ 
four quarts of flour and not quite two pounds ol 
suet. A pot-pie with but little paste in proportioii 
to the meat, is no better than a stew. The paste, 
if good, is always much liked. Divide the minced 
suet into two halves. Rub or crumble one half 
the suet into the pan of flour ; adding by degrees 
a little cold water, barely enough to make a stiff 
dough ; first mixing in a small tea-spoonful of salt, 
lloll out the lump of dough into a large sheet, and 
spread it all over with the remainder of the minced 
suet, laid on with a broad knife. Then fold it 
up, and set it on a dish in a cool place, to get 
quite cold. Take a large iron pot, made very clean. 
Iia,7 in the bottom the largest pieces of l)eef steak.

and line round the sides with pieces of the paste, 
cut to fit. Next put in the remainder of the 
meat, interspersed with raw potatos sliced, (either 
white or sweet potatos,) and also pieces of the paste 
cut into squares, and laid among the meat, to which 
must be added the gravy saved from the stew. 
When the pot is nearly fuJl, cover its contents with 
a large round or circular piece of paste. This must 
not fit quite closely, but a little space or crack must 
be left all around for the gravy to bubble up as it 
boils. Before you put on the lid pour in half a 
pint, or more, of water. Cut a cross-slit in the 
centre of the top-crust. Set the pot over a good 
fire, and let it boil steadily, till all is done, meat 
and paste. The upper-crust should be well-browned. 
When cooked, serve the whole upon one large dish, 
laying the brown upper-crust on the top of all. 
K there is too much gravy, send some of it to table 
in a sauce-boat, first skimming it. 

It will be improved by adding to the seasoning 
some nutmeg or powdered mace. These are the 
only spices that accord well with meat or poultry.

POT-PIES.— The preceding receipt is good for 
any sort of pot-pie. They are all on the same 
principle. The meat to be divested of the fat, and 
stewed first in a pot by itself, saving the gravy. 
The pa.«Jte (of which there should always be an 
ampxe allowance) sufficient to line the sides of the

witb tne meat, and an upper crust to cover the 
whole. At tlie very bottom the meat and gravy 
only, as there the paste might burn. Pot-pies may 
be made of any sort of fresh meat, or of fowls or 
any sort of poultry (cut up, as if for carving,) and 
previously stewed. If made of chickens or pigeons 
or rabbits, add a few slices of cold ham and put 
no other salt. For want of suet you may make 
the paste with butter, but it must be fresh and 
good. Allow half a pound of butter to a large 
quart of flour. Potato paste is tolerable for short- 
ening pot-pies, if you make it half mashed potato 
and half lard. We do not recommend bread 
dough or any thing raised with yeast or soda for 
boiled paste; when there is no shortening, boiled 
paste is always tough and unwholesome. 

Pot-pies may be made of apples pared, cored, and 
quartered; of peaches quartered and stoned, or of 
any nice fruit. Fruit pot-pies should have butter 
paste, and be well sweetened with brown sugar. 

All boiled dough should be eaten warm. It 
falls and becomes heavy as soon as cold.

i\ large pound and a quarter, of tender-loin beef steak, 
that has been cut into thin pieces (without fat or 
l)one, seasoned with a very little salt and pepper,

Lay this meat upon the large thick sheet of crust ; 
pour the stewed gravy among it, and add some 
bits of fresh butter rolled in flour. Cover it with 
the small round of paste, cut to fit, only allowing 
the lid large enough to project a little over, so as 
to be joined firmly by pressing it all round with your 
fingers. Do it well and securely, that it may not 
come apart while boiling. Dip a large square 
pudding-cloth in hot water — shake it out — lay it 
in a deep pan, dredge it with flour, lay the pudding

nice fresh butter divided into pieces and rolled in 
flour. When this has come to a boil, return the 
onions to the liquor; season them with pepper, and 
give them one boil up. When the tripe is done, 
transfer it to a deep dish, and pour the onion sauce 
over it. When on your plate, add to it some 
tarragon vinegar or mustard. Take the strings 
off before the tripe goes to table.

which can be obtained at a druggist's,) being 
pounded extremely fine, must be sifted through 
clean thin muslin., and spread on a dish, and laid 
before the fire for three hours, stirring them fre- 
quently. Keep this powder in a bottle with a

milk, seasoned with powdered nutmicg or mace. 
Have boiling in the frying-pan an ample quantity 
of the drippings of roast veal, or beef. Dip each

having discovered that it is qnite the contrary, 
the gastric juice that it contained, as the stomach 
of the animal, rendering it singularly fitted for 
digestion, provided that it h thoroughly cooked; 
m that on trial, a fork can easily penetrate every 
part of it. 

TONGUES. — Corned or salted tongues are very 
little in use now. They spoil so soon, that it is 
scarcely possible to obtain one that has not been 
salted too late; and when quite fresh, they have a 
faint, sickening, doubfful taste. It is best always 
to buy them dried and smoked. Choose the largest 
and plumpest, and with as smooth an outside or 
skin as you can. Put a tongue into soak the even- 
ing before it is to be cooked ; changing the water 
at bed-time. In the morning wash it in fresh water. 
Trim off the root, which is an unsightly object, 
and never carved at table. But it may be cut into 
pieces, and added to pea-soup, or bean-soup, or 
pepper-pot. Put on the tongue in a large pot of 
cold water, and boil it steadily for five or six hours, 
till it is so tender that a straw, or a twig from a 
corn-broom, will easily penetrate it. When you 
find that it is thoroughly done (and not till then) 
take it up. A smoked tongue requires more boil- 
ing than a ham, and therefore is seldom sufficiently 
cooked. When quite done, peel it carefully, and 
keep it warm till dinner. If well-boiled, it will 
seem almost to melt in your mouth. When you

by carving it lengthways, or in long pieces. It 
should be out in round slices, not too thin. 

For a large party we have seen two cold tonguess 
on one dish. One of them whole— the root con- 
cealt d entirely with double parsley, cut paper, or a 
bunc^ of flowers cut out of vegetables, very in- 
geniously, with a sharp penknife — the vegetables 
raw, uf course not to be eaten. E@d roses made 
of beots, white roses or camellias of turnips, mari- 
golds of carrots, &c. The stems are short wooden 
skewers, stuck into the flowers, and concealed 
by double parsley. These vegetable bouquets can 
be made to look very well, as ornaments to cold 
tongue, or to the end of the shank of a ham, or to 
stick into the centre of a cold round of a-la-mode 
beef. 

Where there are two cold tongues on one dish, 
it is usual to split one to be helped lengthways, 
and garnish it with the other, cut into circular 
pieces, and laid handsomely round. 

Cold tongue sliced is a great improvement to a 
chicken pie, or to any bird pie.

BAKED TONGU E.— Having soaked a fine large 
smoked tongue all night, in the morning trim it' 
nicely, and if it still seems hard, soak it again in 
fresh cold water till it is time to cook it. Then 
pui it into a deep dish, (having trimmed off the 
root,) and make a coarse paste of flour and water. 
Cut up the roots into little bits, and lay them 
pouu^ a/id abcut the tongue, to enrich the gravy. 



172 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

Lay all along the surface some bits of butter rolled 
in flour, and season with a little pepper — no salt 
Pour in a very Kttle water, and cover the dish with 
the coarse paste. Bake it till the tongue is very 
tender. This you may ascertain by raising up with 
a knife one corner of the paste and trying the 
tongue. When done, peel it, dish it, strain the 
gravy over the tongue, and send it to table. Gar- 
nish with baked tomatos, or mushrooms, or large 
roasted chestnuts peeled. 

For a large company hap^e two baked tongues, 
one at each end of the table. Eat them warm. 



MVN^#^.<^\^V^^S<SA<> 



LARDED TONGUE.— Take a large cold 
tongue, that has been well boiled. Trim off the 
roots. Have ready some slips of the fat of cold 
boiled ham, cut into long thin pieces, about as 
thick as straws. With a larding needle, draw them 
through the outside of the tongue, and leave them 
there. Arrange the borders in rows, or handsome 
regular forms, leaving about an inch standing up 
on the surface. 

Cold meat or poultry is far better for larding 
than that which is yet to cook. 



'^^v^^v^^l^^yw^ 



TONGUE TOAST.— Make some slices of nice 
toast, not very thick, but browned evenly all over, 
on bot?i sides. Trim off the whole of the crust. 
Butter the toast slightly. Grate, with a large 
i^rater plenty of cold tongue, and spread it thickly 



aiiss Leslie's new cook book. 178 

dver the toast. Lay the slices side by side, on a 
large dish — not one slice on the top of another. 
Scire them up at breakfast, luncheon, or supper.

tered toast.

SANDWICHES— Are slices of cold ham, or 
tongue, cut very thin^ and laid between thin slices 
of buttered bread. The meat may be seasoned with 
French mustard. Roll them up nicely. There 
are silver cases made to contain sandwiches to eat 
on the road when traveling. 

Sandwiches for traveling may be made of the 
lean of cold beef, (roast or boiled,) cut very thin, 
seasoned with French mustard, and laid between 
two slices of bread and butter. 



MUTTON. 

MUTTON.— If mutton is good it is of a fine 
giain ; the lean is of a bright red color, and the fat 
film and white. Unless there is plenty of fat the 
lean will not be good ; and so it is with all meat. 
If the lean is of a very dark red, and coarse and 
.bnxd, and the fat yellowish and spongy, the mutton 



17 i MISS LESLIE « NEW COOK BOOK. 

is old, tough, and strong. Therefore, do not buy 
it. If there is any dark or blackish tint about the 
meat, it is tainted, and of course unwholesome. If 
kept till it acquires what the English call venison 
taste, Americans will very properly refuse to eat it. 
We give no directions for disguising spoilt meat. 
It should be thrown away. Nothing is fit to eat 
in which decomposition is commencing. 



BOILED LOIN OF MUTTON.— A good loin 
of mutton is always very fat, so that in cooking 
it is well to remove or pare off a portion of the 
outside fat. Unlike most other meats, mutton is 
the better for being boiled in soup. Put it into a 
large pot ; allow to every pound a quart of water. 
Boil it slowly and skim it well, adding the vegetables 
when the scum has done rising. The vegetables 
should be sliced turnips, potatos, and grated carrots. 
Have ready plenty of suet dumplings, in the pro- 
portion of half a pound of finely minced suet to a 
pound and a quarter of flour. Eub the suet into 
the pan of flour, and use as little water as possible 
m mixing the dough. Make it into thick dump- 
lings, rather larger round than a dollar. Boil them 
in a pot by themselves, till thoroughly done. Serve 
up the meat with the dumplings round it. Or 
put the dumplings in a dish by themselves, and 
surround the meat with whole turnips. This is an 
excellent plain dish for a private femily. Servo 
UD pickbs with it.

SAUCE FOR BOILED MUTTON.-^This par- 
ticiilarly applies to mutton tliat lias been boiled in 
soup, and which is so very generally liked, that it 
L3 served up on tables where soup-meat of beef and 
v^eal is considered inadmissible. To make a suit- 
able sauce to eat with it — take two or three large 
boiled onions; slice them and put them into a 
sauce-pan, with a piece of fresh butter slightly 
rolled in flour, a table-spoonful of made mustard. 
French mustard will be best ; or, for want of that, 
two table-spoonfuls of strong tarragon vinegar, 
and a half-salt-spoon of cayenne, and some pickled 
cucumbers chopped, but not minced. Green nastur- 
tion seeds will be still better than cucumbers. Put 
these ingredients into a small sauce-pan, adding to 
them a little of the mutton soup. Set this sauce 
over the fire, and when it simmers well, take it off, 
put into a sauce-boat, and keep it hot till the mut- 
ton goes to table. 

To keep nasturtions — ^take the full-grown green 
bceds, and put them into a large bottle of the best 
i-ider vinegar, corking them closely. They require 
nothing more, and are far superior to capers. 



'***'^v^^\^^^^^^'V^''*^^ 



BOILED LEG OF MUTTON.— After nicely 
trimming a middle-sized leg of mutton, wash, but 
do not soak it. Put it into a pot that will hold it 
well, and pour on rather more water than is suffi- 
cient to cover it. Set it over & good fire, and skim 
it as soon as it begins to boil, and continue till no 
Ciop© scum a])pears; having thrown l^ a small 



176 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

table-spoonfiil of salt after the first skimming. 
After the liquid is clear, put in some turnips, pared, 
and, if large, divided into four pieceti. Afterwards 
it shold boil slowly, or simmer gently for about 
two hours or more. Send to table with it caper 
sauce ; or nasturtion, which is still better. Eat it 
vith any sort of green pickles. Pickles and turnips 
seem indispensable to boiled mutton. Do not mash 
the turnips, but let them be well drained. 

Setting boiled turnips in the sun will give them 
an unpleasant taste. 

Tarragon sauce is excellent with boiled mutton. 



MVWV^^I<V^^VS>V 



MUTTON STEAKS STEWED.— Take some 
tender mutton steaks, cut from the leg. Beat 
them a Lctle with a rolling pin^ and season them 
with pepper and salt. Put them into a stew-pan 
with sliced potatos, sliced turnips, sliced onions, 
sliced or grated carrots, and sweet marjoram 
leaves stripped from the stalks. Pour in just suffi- 
cient water to cover the stew, and let it cook slowly 
till it is tender and well done. Serve it up hot in 
a deep dish, with a cover. A table-spoonful of 
tarragon mustard will improve the stew. 

When tomatos are in season, you can stew 
mutton or any other meat with tomatos <>nly — no 
water. Having prepared the meat, and luid it in 
the stew-pan, cover it with tomatos, peeled jmd 
quartered. Add some sugar to take off & portion 
of their a</id, and a chopped onicn. No wdier, as 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 177 

the meat will cook in the liquid of the tomatos. 
They must stew till thoroughly dissolved. 

Tender-loin beef steaks — or veal cutlets, may ha 
stewed as above. 



— ^»^v*Wv^^^#^SA'><>»«' 



MUTTON CHOPS BROILED. — The best 
steaks are those cut from the loin, about half an 
inch thick. Divest them of the bone, and remove 
the skin and fat. Then butter them slightly all 
over, before cooking. This will be found an im- 
provement. The French go over them with salad 
oil, which is still better. Sprinkle on them a little 
pepper and salt. Having heated the gridiron well 
over a bed of very hot live coals, place it some- 
what aslant, grease its bars with a little of the 
mutton suet, and lay on the steaks and broil them 
well ; turning them three or four times, and seeing 
that they are not scorched or burnt on the out- 
side, and red or raw when cut. Turn them with 
a knife and fork, or with steak-tongs, an instru- 
ment with which every kitchen should be fur- 
nished. To cook them well requires a clear glow- 
ing fire, without blaze or smoke. They should 
be done in about a quarter of an hour. When 
you take them up, turn them on a well-heated 
dish, and pour their gravy over them. 

If onions are liked, mince one as fine as pos- 
sible, and strew it over the steaks while broiling ; 
or, boil and slice some onions, mix some butter 
amoro: them, season them with pepper, and a little 



178 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

powdered mace or nutmeg, and serve them np 
with the meat on the same dish, or in a sance-boat 



■•■''^'^'^•^^■^^ \^s^\/v^,^.**w^ 



MlPrTOISr CHOPS with TOMATOS.— Broil 

some mutton steaks in the above manner, and 
have ready some baked tomatos. When the steaks 
are dished, lay on each a large baked tomato with 
the face downward, or cover each steak with stewed 
tomato sauce. For baking, take fine ripe tomatos of 
the largest size. Cut out a piece from the stem 
end, and extract the seeds. Then stuff each tomato 
with grated bread-crumbs, butter, and minced sweet 
marjoram, or finely minced onion. If you have 
any cold veal or chicken, add a little of that to the 
stuffing, mincing it, of course. Bake them in a 
dish by themselves. 

Or, you may send the steaks to table with a 
slice of fried egg-plant laid upon each ; buttered, 
and sprinkled with bread-crumbs. 



MS/^/v/^^^I^^SA^V""— 



MUTTON STEAKS FKIED.— Make a mce 
batter of grated bread-crumbs, milk and beaten 
egg, and put it in a shallow pan. Prepare some 
fine steaks cut from the loin, divested of fat, 
and with the bone cut short. Have ready, in a 
hot frying-pan, some fresh butter or drippings. 
Dip each steak twice over in the batter, then fry 
them brown. Send them to table very hot. 

You may fry mutton chops like beef step.ks. 
covered with onions, boiled, drained, and slicod 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 179 

POTATO MUTl'ON CHOPS.— Cut some nice 
chops or steaks from the best end of a neck of 
mutton. The loin will be still better. Trim off 
all the fat, but leave a small part of the bone 
'visible, nicely scraped. Season them with pepper 
and salt, and fry them in butter or drippings. 
Have ready plenty of mashed potatos with which 
cover the chops all over separately, so as to wrap 
them up in the mashed potatos. Glaze them with 
beaten egg, and brown them with a salamander or 
a red-hot shovel. This is a nice breakfast dish. 



KEBOBBED MUTTON.— This is an Asiatic 
dish, much approved by those who have eaten it 
in Turkey or India, and it is certainly very 
good. Kemove the skin from a loin of mutton, 
and also the whole of the fat. Divide it at every 
joint, cutting all the steaks apart, and making 
separate steaks of the whole loin. Make a mix- 
ture of grated bread-crumbs, minced sweet-herbs, 
a little salt and pepper, and some powdered nut- 
meg. Have ready some beaten yolk of egg. Dip 
each steak into the egg then; twice into the sea- 
soning. Eoll up each steak round a wooden 
skewer, and tie them on a spit with packthread. 
Roast them before a clear fire, with a dripping- 
pan under them to catch the gravy, which must 
be skimmed frequently. They must be roasted 
slowly and carefully, taking care to have them 
thoroughly cooked, even to the inmost of every 
roll. Baste them with just butter enough to L een 



180 MISS Leslie's new cook book, 

tbem moist. When done, carefully take the ke* 
bobs from the skewers, and send them to table 
hot. Eat with them large Spanish chestnuts, 
roasted and peeled ; or else sweet potatos, split, 
boiled, and cut into short pieces. Pour the gravy 
i]ito the dish under rjhe kebobs. 

Instead of rolling up the kebobs, you may 
fasten them flat (after seasoning,) with the same 
spit going through them all, and roast them in 
that manner. They should all be of the same 
size and shape. To dish them, lay them one upon 
another in an even pile. Eat mushroom sauce 
with them, or any other sort that is very nice. 

Yenison steaks are very good kebobbed in this 
manner, at the season when venison can be had 
fresh, tender, and juicy. For sauce have stewed 
wild grapes, mashed and made very sweet with 
brown sugar, or grape jelly, which is still better ; 
or, sauce made of fine cranberries, such as abounu 
m the north-west. 



'^VSA#^.^^.^V^SAA»~. 



AN lEISH STEW.— Take three pounds of 
thick mutton cutlets from the loin, and remove 
the fat. Slice thick five pounds of fine potatos 
that have been previously pared. Place a layer 
of meat in the bottom of a stew-pan, or an iron 
pot, and lay some of the potatos upon it. Season 
all with salt and pepper. Upon this another layer 
of meat — then some potatos again, then meat, and 
BO on till all is in, finishing with potatos at the 
top. Pour in a pint of 'cold water. Let it sim* 



MISS LESLIE^S NEW COOK BOOK. 181 

mer gently for two hours or more, till the meat 
and potatos are thoroughly done. Serve it up 
very hot, meat and potatos, on the same dish. If 
approved, you may add, from the beginning, one 
or two sliced onions. 

A similar stew may be made of beef steaks and 
potatos. 

You may stew pork cutlets in the same manner, 
but with sweet potatos, split and cut in long 
pieces, or with yams. The seasoning for the pork 
should be minced sage. 

This is a very plain, but very good dish, if 
made of nice fresh meat and good potatos, and 
well cooked. 

LAMB.— The vein in the neck of the fore- 
quarter should be blueish, and firm— otherwise do 
not buy it. If greenish or yellowish, it is tainted, 
and fit only for manure. Never buy any thing 
that has been kept too long. The worst may, by 
some process, be a little disguised, but nothing 
can render wholesome any article of food in which 
decomposition has commenced, even in the slit^ht- 
est degree. The fat should be quite white. If 
there is but little meat on the shoulder it has not 
been a good lamb. In America, where food is 
abundant, there is no occasion to eat any thing, 
that has the flavor in the least changed by keep- 
ing. 

A fore-quarter of lamb comprises the shoulder, 
the neck, and the breast together. The hind- 
quarter is the loin and leg. Lar;ib comes i»

season in the beginning of j^pril, if the spring is 
cot unusually backward. 

' Jersey lamb is sometimes garlicky early in the 
season. Avoid buying it ; you can easily tell it 
by the garlicky smell. It can only be rendered 
eatable by stewing, or frying it with plenty of 
onions. To plain roast or boil garlicky meat is 
in vain. Beef, also, is sometimes garlicky. 

Lamb may be cooked in every way that is 
proper for mutton 



EOAST LAMB. — The roasting pieces for lamb 

are the fore-quarter, and hind-quarter; and the 

saddle, or both hind-quarters together, not having 

been cut apart. If the saddle is cooked whole, it 

should be of a small delicate lamb, nice and fa.t, 

and is then a fashionable dish at company dinners 

Like all other young meat lamb should^always be 

thoroughly done, not the least redness being left 

perceptible any where about it. A hind-quarter of 

eight pounds will require at least two hours — a 

fore-quarter, rather longer. It should be placed 

before a clear brisk fire, but not very near at first. 

Put a little water in the dripping-pan, and baste it 

with that till it begins to cook, adding a little nice 

fresh butter. Tlien place it nearer the fire, and 

when the gravy begins to fall, baste it with that, 

and repeat the basting very frequently. When the 

lamb drops white gravy it is nearly doue, and you 

may prepare for taking it up. Skim the gravy 

sixat is in the dripping-pan till all the fat is taken

off. Then dredge over it a little flour, and send it 
to table in a gravy boat, having stirred in one 
or two table-spoonfuls of currant jelly. Lettuce 
is always an accompaniment to cold lamb. 

In carving a fore-quarter of lamb it is usual to 
take off the shoulder from the ribs, put in a slice 
of fresh butter, sprinkle it with a little cayenne, 
and squeeze over the divided parts a fresh lemon 
cut in half; and put, for that purpose, on a small 
plate beside the carver. 

The vegetables to be eaten with lamb are, new 
potatos, asparagus, green peas, and spinach. Mint 
sauce is indispensable. French cooks seldom un- 
derstand how to make it. To do it properly, 
takp a large bunch of fresh green niint, wash it 
and when you have shaken the wet frem them, 
mince the leaves very fine, omitting the stems. 
Put the leaves, when chopped, into a small tureen 
or sauce-boat, and pour on a sufficient quantity 
of the best cider vinegar to moisten the mint tho- 
roughly, but not to render it the least liquid or 
thin. It should be as thick as horse-radish, pre- 
pared to eat with roast beef. Mix in sufficient sugar 
to make it very sweet. Good brown sugar will do. 
At table put a tea-spoonful on the side of your 
plate. Those who make mint sauce thin and weak, 
and pour it over the meat like gravy, know nothing 
about it

with the meat, over a clear fire ; and let it stew 
slowly till about half done. Then put in the let- 
t!:ce, covering the meat with it, and let them al] 
stew about half an hour longer. When done, take 
out the lettuces first. Put them into a sieve or 
cullender, press out the water, and chop them 
large. See if the meat is done all through. If it 
is, return the stewed lettuce to the pot, season it 
with a little cayenne and some salad oil, and add 
to it two or three hard-boiled eggs, chopped large

LAMB CUTLETS.— Cut the cutlets from the

lemon-peel, grated fine, the thin yellow rind only.

This is a fine breakfast dish or for a small dinner. 
Instead of frying, you may broil them. Dip each 
cutlet twice into the egg and twice into the crumbs, 
and cover each with clean writing paper, cut of 
a convenient shape, and secured with pins or pack- 
thread, the paper being twisted round the end of 
the bone. Broil them in the papers, which must 
be taken off before the cutlets go to table.

LAMB CHOPS, STEWED.— Cut a loin of 
Iamb into chops or steaks, removing the bone, or 
else sawing it very short. Trim off the skin and 
part of the fat. Season the chops with a little pepper 
and salt, and fry them in fresh butter till they are of 
a pale brown color. Then pour off the fat and trans 
fer the steaks to a stew-pan. Add enough boiling 
water to cover them ; and having seasoned them 
with some powdered nutmeg or some blades of 
mace, add a pint of shelled green peas that have 
been already parboiled, or a pint of the green tops 
of asparagus cut off after boiling, and a fresh let-

LAKDED LAMB.— Cut off the fillet or round 
from a nice hind-quarter of lamb, and remove the 
bone from the centre. Make a stuffing or force 
meat of bread-crumbs, fresh butter, sweet marjo° 
ram, and sweet basil, minced finely ; the yellow 
rind of a fresh lemon, grated ; and a tea-spoonful 
of mixed nutmeg and mace, powdered. Fill with 
this stufiing the hole from whence the bone was 
taken, and secure the flap round the side of the 
meat, putting plenty of stuffing between. Then 
proceed to lard it. Cut a number of long thin slips 
of the fat of ham, bacon, or corned pork. All these 
slips must be of the same size. Take one at a time 
between the points of the larding-needle, and draw 
it through the flat surface of the top, or upper side 
of the meat, so as to leave one end of the ham in, 
as you slip the other end out of the needle. Do 
this nicely, arranging the slips of ham in regular 
form, and very near together. Put the lamb into 
an iron oven, or bake-pan, with a small portion of 
lard or fresh butter under it, and bake it thoroughly

VEAL. 

VEAL. — Do not buy veal unless the vein in 
the shoulder looks blue or bright red. If of any 
other color, the veal is not fresh. A calf's head 
should have the eyes full and prominent. If they 
are dull and sunken, the head is stale. The kid- 
ney should be well covered with firm white fat 
All the fat must be firm, dry, and white, and the 
lean fine in the grain, and light colored. If any 
part is found clammy or discolored, do not buy 
that veal. The best pieces of the calf are the 
loin and the fillet. The loin consists of the best 
and the chump end ; the hind knuckle, and the 
fore knuckle. The inferior pieces are the neck, 
blade-bone, and breast. The brisket end of a 
breast of veal is very coarse, hard, and tough ; the 
best end is rather better, having sweet-bread be- 
longing to it. 

Veal, like all other meat, should be well washed 
in cold water before cooking. Being naturally 
the most tasteless and insipid of all meat, it ro 
quires the assistance of certain articles to give it 
flavor. It is too weak to make rich soup with- 
out various additions. But well cooked, it is very 
aice as roasted loin, fillet, or fried cutlets. 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 189 

ROAST LOm OF VEAL.— Wash the meat 
virell in cold water, wipe it dry, and rub it slightly 
with mixed pepper and salt. Make a stuffing of 
biead soa^ked in milk, or grated bread-crumbs, 
cold ham minced, sweet marjoram minced, and 
the juice and yellow grated rind of a lemon; 
also, a little fresh butter. Loosen with a sharp 
knife the skin, and put the stuffing under it, 
skewering down the flap to keep it in. Put the 
veal to roast before a strong clear fire, and pour a 
little water in the bottom of the roaster. Baste it 
wxth this till the gravy begins to run. Then baste 
it with that. Set the spit at first not very close 
t( ihe fire, but bring it nearer as the roasting pro- 
ceeds. 

Send it to table with its own gravy, well 
skimmed and slightly thickened with a little flour. 

Always choose a fine fresh loin of veal with 
plenty of fat about the kidney. No meat spoils 
so soon. 

The breast and shoulder are roasted in the 
snme manner as the loin, of which two dishes may 
be made, the kidney end, and the chump end.

FILLET OF YEAL.— When a fillet is to be 
roasted or baked, let it be well washed, and then 
dried in a clean towel. Take out the bone, fold 
the flap round, and skewer it to the meat. Make 
plenty of forcemeat or stuffing, of biead soaked 
in milk, or grated dry and mixed with plenty of 
fre^oii bu^ter, or some of the fat or suet fi.nelj 



190 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

minced. SeasoD with pepper, grated nutmeg 
powdered mace, fresh lemon peel grated, and 
sweet marjoram and sweet basil minced fine. The 
hole that contained the bone must be stufted full, 
and also the space between the flap and the side 
of the meat. This should be secured by three 
skewers. Dredge the meat all over lightly with 
flour before you put it down. At first, place the 
spit at a distance from the fire, which should be 
strong and clear. Then, as the meat begins to 
roast, set it nearer, and till the gravy begins to 
fall, baste it with fresh butter, or lard. Just be- 
fore it is finished, (it will take about four hours,) 
dredge it with flour, and baste it well with its 
own gravy. When the meat is dished, skim the 
gravy, thicke^i it with a little flour, and pour it 
round the veal in the dish, or serve it in a sauce- 
boat. 

A ham is the usual accompaniment to roast 
veal, whether fillet or loin.

ROAST YEAL HASHED. — Take whatevei 
cold roast veal was left from yesterday. To pre- 
pare it for a breakfast dish, cut it into small bits, 
and put it (^athout any water) into a stew-pan, 
adding to it the veal gravy that was left from 
yesterday, and a table -spoonful of fresh butter oi 
lard, dredged with flour. Cover it, and after 
stewing it half an hour by itself, put in two large 
table-spoonfuls of well spiced tomato catchup, an 
article ik> f'\mily should be without. After the 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 191 

catchup is in, cover the hash again, and let i* 
stew half an hour longer. If you have no 
catchup, put in with the cold veal at the begin- 
ning, two or three large ripe tomatos, peeled and 
quartered, or sliced, and seasoned with powdered 
mace, nutmeg, and ginger ; and let all stew to- 
gether in gravy or butter. Mushroom catchup 
is a good substitute for tomato in hashing cold 
meat. If you have neither, put in a large table- 
spoonful of tarragon or French mustard, to be 
bought in bottles at all the best groceries. 

Cold roast venison is very good hashed as above 



'^^^^^-^^ 



VEAL A-LA-MODE,— Remove the bone from 
a fillet of veal, and make a large quantity of force- 
meat or stuffing of grated bread-crumbs ; beef- 
suet or veal-suet minced fine, the grated yellow 
rind and juice of a ripe lemon or orange, or some 
chopped mushrooms that have been previously 
stewed, some grated yolk of hard-boiled eggs, and 
some sweet marjoram. Press in the stuffing, tiP 
the hole left by the bone is well filled ; and also, 
put stuffing between the flap and the side of the 
meat, before you skewer the flap. Have ready 
gome lardons or slips of cold ham, or tongue, and 
with a larding pin draw them all through the 
surface of the veal. Or else, make deep cuts or 
incisions throughout the meat, and press down 
into each a small thin .square bit of bacon-fat, 
seasoning every one with a little of the stuffing. 
Lay the veal iii a deep baking-paa or iron bake*

oven. Surround it with nice lard, and bake it 
till thoroughly done all through. Then take it 
out, skim the gravy, and transfer it to a sm-all 
eauce-pan. Stir in a dessert-spoonful of* flour; 
add a glass of white wine to the gravy, and give 
it one boil up. Send it to table in a sauce-tureen, 
accompanying the veal. 



~~srtrv/Vs^-i*>-\4 



TERRAPIN VEAL.— Take some nice real, 
(from the fillet, or the loin) and cut it into very 
rimall mouthfuls. Put it into a stew-pan. Have 
ready a dressing made of six or seven hard-boiled 
eggs, minced fine, a small tea-spoonful of made mus- 
tard, (tarragon or French mustard will be best,) a 
tsalt-spoon of salt, and the same of cayenne ; two 
glasses of sherry or Madeira, and half a pint of 
rich cream. If you cannot conveniently obtain 
cream, substitute a quarter of a pound of fresh 
butter, divided into four pieces, and each piece 
dredged with flour. All the ingredients for this 
dressing must be thoroughly mixed. Then, poui 
it over the veal, and give the whole a hard stir. 
Cover it, and let it stew over the fire for about 
ten minutes. Fresh venison is excellent, cooked 
in this manner. So, also, are ducks, pheasants, 
partridges, or grouse, making a fine side dish for 
company.

ing i<. m its own gravy, without a JroD of 
water. For this purpose, save as much as you 
can ol the dripping or gravy that fell from it 
when roasting. When you have done basting the 
roast meat, skim off all the fat from the surface, 
and strain the gravy through a small sieve. What 
IS left of it, should be carefully set away in a cold 
place. Kext day, when it has congealed into a 
cake, scrape it with a knife on both sides. If not 
wanted for immediate use, cut it in pieces, and 
put it up in a jar well covered. Use it (instead 
of water) for stews and hashes ; and if well sea- 
soned the meat will be found nearly as good (for 
a breakfast dish,) as if not previously cooked. 
Whenever it is possible, make your hashes with- 
out any water; and if you have saved no gravy, 
substitute lard, or fresh butter. But gravy or 
drippings of the same meat is best. A hash of 
cold meat, stewed merely in water, and with no 
seasoning but salt and pepper, is a poor thing. 
Cold potatos, when re-cooked, always remain hard 
and indigestible. In all cookery it is best to use 
fresh vegetables^ even if the meat has been pre- 
viously drest. Cold meat is of no use for soups or 
pi^s. It is better to slice it, and eat it cold — or, 
better still to give it the poor. Eoast beef or mut- 
»on, if very much underdone, may be sliced and 
broiled on a gridiron, and well seasoned with 
pepper. Cold roast porjs. is best sliced plain, and 
eat^n cold. Ham also.

TEAL CUTLETS IN PAPERS (en papilhtes,) 
— Make a nice sauce of sweet herbs, bread 
crumbs, powdered mace and nutmeg, butter and 
beaten Qgg Lay the cutlets in a deep dish, (hav- 
ing first broiled them and saved the gravy,) pour 
the sauce over them, with the veal gravy added 
to it. Cover them, and let them rest till cold. 
Allow, for each cutlet, a sheet of foolscap paper, 
cut it into the shape of a heart, and go over it 
with sweet oil, or fresh butter or lard. Lay a 
cutlet with a little of the sauce upon it, on one- 
half of each sheet of paper ; turn the other half 
over the meat. Fold a narrow rim all round, so 
as to unite both edges. Begin at the top of the 
heart, and pleat both edges together so as to form 
a good shape without puckering. "When you 
come to the bottom, where the paper is to cover 
the bone, give it a few extra twists. Broil the 
cutlets slowly on a gridiron for half an hour, see- 
ing that no blaze catches the papers — or put them 
in the oven for half an hour. If the papers are 
not too much burnt or disfigured, dish the cutlets 
still wrapped in them, to be removed by those 
who eat them. If the covers are scorched black, 
and ragged, take out the cutlets and lay them on 
a hot dish. Serve up with them a dish of mashed 
potatos or potatoe cake, browned on the surface 
with a salamander. CCiekites a la Maintenoi\ are 
mutton or lamb steaks cooked in papers, in the 
above manner. 



MISS LESLlE^S NEW COOK BOOK. 195 

VEAL STEAKS.— -Cat the steaks from ihe 
neck, leaving the bone very short, and polishing 
what there is of it. Make a seasoning of boiled 
onions minced, and sage or sweet marjoram leaves, 
or of chopped parsley. Lay on each steak a bit 
of fresh butter, spread the seasoning thickly over 
each, and fry them in the gravy or drippings of 
cold roast veal or beef. They will be the better 
for beating them slightly with a rolling pin. Put 
into the frying-pan three or four table- spoonfuls 
of mushroom or tomato catchup; or, fry tkem 
with fresh mushrooms or fresh tomatos, sliced. 



h-^l^^SAMw 



VEAL CUTLETS.— Cut your veal cutlets from 
the fillet or round about half an inch thick. Season 
them slightly with a little salt and cayenne. Have 
ready a pan with grated bread-crumbs, and another 
with beaten egg. Have ready, in a frying pan, 
plenty of boiling lard, or drippings of cold veal. 
Dredge each cutlet slightly with flour ; then dip it 
twice in the pan of beaten egg, and then twice also 
in the bread-crumbs. Fry them well, and send 
them to table in their own gravy. Safiron, scat- 
tered thickly over them while frying, is an im- 
provement much relished by the eaters. 

Veal is too insipid to be fried or broiled plain- 

If you live where cream is plenty, add to this 
fry two or three spoonfuls. 

Minced veal cold, is an excellent ingredient for 
forcemeats.

KKUCKLE OF VEAL AND BAC0N.--t3.i. 
less your family is very small, get two knuckiea 
of veal, and have them sawed into three pieces 
each. Put them into a pot with two pounds of 
ham or bacon ; cover them with water, and stew 
them slowly, skimming them well. Season them 
with a little pepper, but no salt, as the bacon will 
be salt enough. When the scum ceases to rise, 
put in four onions and four turnips, and six pota- 
tos pared, and quartered ; also, a carrot and two 
parsnips, scraped and cut into pieces. Let the 
whole boil till all the meat and all the vegetables 
are thoroughly done, and very tender. Drain them 
well, and serve up the whole on one large dish, 
having other vegetables served separately. 

If you wish to have green vegetables, such as 
greens, you'Ug sprouts, poke, or string beans, fla- 
vored with bacon, put them to boil in a pot with 
the bacon only, and take anoth-er pot for the veal, 
Hnd white vegetables, such as onions, turnips, &0. 
You may put the veal and bacon on the same dish.

YEAL PATTIES.— Mince very fine, some cold 
roast veal, or some cold chicken, mixmg with it 
some cold minced ham. or cold smoked tongue. 
Add some yolk of hard-boiled eggs, crumbled or 
minced. Season the mixture with powdered mace 
and nutmeg, moistened with cream or soft fresh 
butter. Have ready some nice puff-pa^te. rolled 
out thin, and cut into oval or circular pieces. 
Cover the half of each with the mixture, spread on

reJEUiy your calf s liver, cut into slices not too thuij 
as that will render tliem liard. Take out the ham 
as soon as it is done, put it into a hot dish, and 
cover it closely. Lay the slices of liver into the 
gravy of the bacon that is left in the frying-pan, 
Bpinkling it well with chopped parsley. It must 
be thoroughly done. Then dish with the bacon. 

To those who like them, some onions will be 
thought an improvement to fried liver. First par- 
boil the onions : then slice them, season them with 
a little salt and pepper, and fry them with the liver. 

If lettuces are in season, quarter a fresh one, and 
lay it under the liver when you dish it, having 
previously removed the thickest part of the stalk. 
The liver of beef or sheep is not seen at good tables. 
It is very inferior to that of calf\ being hard and 
coiarse. 

LARDED LIYER.— Wash and drain a nice 
fat calf's liver. Liver of beef or mutton is never 
seen at a good table ; they are hard, coarse, and 
tasteless, and only eaten by the poor, while the 
livers of veal and poultry are considered very nice. 
Divide it into equal portions. Lard them thickly 
with smaU slips of fat bacon, inserted at regular 
distances with a larding-needle, and very near each 
other. Season the liver v/ith powdered nutmeg 
and mace. Put into a stew-pan, m the bottom of 
which you have laid a large slice or two of fat 
bacon. Let it stew gently, till thoroughly done 
and tender throughout. When you take the liver 
out of the stew-pan, stir into the erravv left at the

with the liver. 

If lilted, surround the liver while cooking, wit)j 
small button onions, (peeled and washed,) aod see 
that thej are well done. Serve them up on the 
same dish It is best always to boil onions before 
frying them. 

STEWED LIYEE. — Having soaked a fine 
calf's liver for two hours in cold water, cut it into 
thick slices, and then cut the slices into mouthfuls. 
Chop fine a small bunch of sweet marjoram, and 
sprinkle it among the liver, seasoning with pepper, 
salt, nutmeg, and powdered mace. Put it into a 
3tew-pan, and conk it in lard or fresh butter. Make 
some nice toast, and dip it for a minute in hot 
water, having pared off all the crust. Lay the 
toast in the bottom of a deep dish, after covering it 
all over with the stewed liver.

LIVER RISSOLES.— Take a calf's liv^er, and 
remove carefully all the veins. Weigh a pound 
of it, boil it, and when cold, mince it very finely 
with a quarter of a pound of suet, either of beef or 
veal. Add a quarter of a pound of finely grated 
bread crumbs. Season it with cayenne, powdered 
muce, and nutmeg, and a very little salt. Mix in 
two well-beaten eggs. Shape them into oval forms, 
abor t the size of large walnuts, and frv them in 
plenty of boiling hot lard, draining them all on a 
perforated skimmer, before they go to table.

LIYER PIE,— Prepare a fine fresk calf's liver. 
Split it in long pieces. Lay it in a pan of cold 
water for an hour or two. Afterwards take it out 
and wipe it dry, and boil it till tender. Drain it 
wken done, and chop it large with a slice of cold 
ham. Season it with pepper and nutmeg, (no 
salt for any thing that has ham it,) and add some 
minced sweet marjoram and sweet basil, and two 
yolks of hard-boiled eggs, grated or minced. The 
grated yellow rind of a fresh lemon will be an im- 
provement. Make a very nice light paste, and line 
a pie dish with it. Then fill it high with the mix- 
ture, laying on the top several pieces of fine fresh 
butter. Cover it with a lid of paste, notching the 
edges handsomely, and cutting a cross-slit on the 
top. Bake it light brown, and serve it up, either 
hot or cold. It will be found very nice. 

With the same mixture you may make liver 
dumplings, enclosing them in a nice paste, and 
boiling them ; or a liver pudding, boiling the mix- 
ture in one large paste, and tying it in a cloth, 
leaving room for it to swell.

CHITTERLIISrGS OR CALF'S TRIPE.— 
This is very delicate and digestible, and is nice at 
breakfast, or as a side dish at dinner. To prepare 
it for cooking, it should be cut open with scissors, 
emptied, and thoroughly cleaned, and then laid all 
night, or for several hours, in cold water, slightly 
salted. It can be bought of the veal butchers 
ready pre])ared. and run on a wooden skewer

Wasli it again just before cooking. Cut it into 
email pieces, and boil it slowly till quite tender, in 
water enough to keep it well covered. When 
entirely done, take it up, drain it, and keep it 
warm. Have ready some onions boiled in milk 
till quite soft, and sliced tliin. Melt some excellent 
fresh buiter, in milk thickened with flour. Make 
a round of very nice toast, with the crust pared oftl 
Dip it for a minute in hot water ; lay it in the bot- 
tom of a deep dish. Cover it thickly with the 
onion sauce, and place the chitterlings upon it, 
seasoning them with pepper and vinegar. It will 
be an improvement to boil with them four or five 
blades of mace. Eat vinegar with it, always. Tara- 
gon vinegar is best. This dish deserves to bo 
more in use. Try it. 



FRIED CHITTERLINGS.— Get chitterlings 
ready prepared by the butcher. Wash them, and 
let them lie an hour or two in weak salt and water. 
Then drain them, cut them in pieces, and parboil 
them. Dry them in a clean cloth. Make a batter 
of two or three beaten eggs, and a pint of milk, 
with a heaped table-spoonfiil of flour. Put into a 
frying-pan an ample portion of the dripping of 
roast veal or pork, and when it boils, (having first 
dipped each piece of the chitterling into the batter,) 
frj/ them in the dripping. They must be tho- 
roughly done. You may fry them in lard, or 
fresh butter. 

Tb'5 is a nice breakfast dish.

BAKED CHITTEELINGS.— Having fiist par- 
boiled the chitterlings, lay among them some bits 
of fresh butter, season them with powderea nut- 
meg, put them into a deep dish, set it into an oven,

FINE YEAL PIE.— BoH, in two quarts of 
water, two unskinned calf's feet, adding the yellow 
rind of a large lemon, pared as thin as possible, oi 
grated, and its squeezed juice. Also, two broken- 
ap sticks of cinnamon, half a dozen blades of 
mace, and two glasses of sweet wine. Boil all 
these together (skimming well,) till the calf's feet 
are in rags, and all their flesh has dropped from 
the bone. Then put the whole into a jelly-bag and 
let it drip into a broad bowl. Set it away closely 
covered. Have ready two pounds of the parboiled 
chump end of a loin of veal cut into square pieces. 
Make a nice puff paste, and line with it a deep pie- 
dish. Put the pieces of veal into it, (all the fat cut 
ofi\) and intersperse them with a dozen or more 
forcemeat balls, each about as large as an English 
walnut. The balls may be made of cold minced 
chicken and ham, minced suet, bread-crumbs, and 
hard-boiled yolk of egg grated or crumbled fine; 
seasoned with sweet herbs, and grated lemon rind. 
Or they may be sweet balls of bread-crumbs, butter, 
chopped sultana raisins, and chopped citron, sea- 
soned with nutmeg. Having dispersed them araon^ 
the pieces of veal, put in the jelly made from the

calf's feet. Cover the pie with a lid of puff-paste, 
cut a cross slit in the centre; notch the edges, and 
bake it brown. This pie is for a company dish. 



A PLAIN VEAL PIE.— Cut the meat from an 
uncooked breast of veal, and stew it in a very little 
water. Have ready a pie dish lined with a nice 
paste. Put in a layer of stewed veal, with its 
gravy, and cover it with a layer of *sausage meat ; 
then veal again, and then sausage meat. Repeat 
this till the dish is full, finishing with the sausage. 
Cover it with a lid of paste, and bake it brown. 
This is a cheap and easy family pie.

YEAL LOAF.— Take a cold fillet of veal, and 
(omitting the fat and skin) mince the meat as fine 
as possible. Mix with it a quarter of a pound of 
the fattest part of a cold ham, also chopped small. 
Add a tea-cupful of grated bread-crumbs ; a grated 
nutmeg; half a dozen blades of rajace, powdered; 
the grated yellow rind of a lemon ; and two beaten 
eggs. Season with a salt-spoon of salt, and half a 
salt-spoon of cayenne. Mix the whole well to- 
gether, and make it into the form of a loaf Then 
glaze it over with beaten yolk of egg- and strew 
the surface evenly, all over, with bread rasp- 
ings, or with pounded cracker. Set the dish into 
a dutch-oven, and bake it half an hour, or till 
hot all through. Have ready a gravy made of the 
trimmings of the veal, stewed in some of the gravy 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 205 

that was left when the fillet was roasted the day 
before. When sufficiently cooked, take out the 
meat, and thicken the gravy with beaten yolk of 
egg, stirred in about three minutes before you take 
it from the fire. 

Send the veal loaf to table, in a deep dish, with 
the gravy poured round it. 

Chicken loaf, or turkey loaf, may be made in: 
this manner. 

STEWED CALF'S HE AD.— Take a fine, large 
calf's head; empty it; wash it clean, and boil it 
till it is quite tender, in just water enough to cover 
it. Then carefully take out the bones, without 
spoiling the appearance of the head. Season it with 
a little salt and cayenne, and a grated nutmeg. 
Pour over it the liquor in which it has been boiled, 
adding a jill of vinegar, and two table-spoonfuls 
of capers, or of green nasturtion seeds, that have 
oeen pickled. Let it stew very slowly for half an 
hour. Have ready some forcemeat balls made of 
minced veal-suet, grated bread-crumbs, grated 
lemon-peel, and sweet marjoram, — adding beaten 
yolk of ^gg to bind the other ingredients together. 
Put in the forcemeat balls, and stew it slowly a 
quarter of an hour longer, adding some bits of 
butter rolled in flour to enrich the gravy. Send it 
to table hot.

small joung onions, chopped small, a tea-spoonful 
of sweet marjoram leaves rubbed from the stalks, 
the yellow rind of a small lemon grated, and a tea- 
8po:)ni\il of mixed mace and nutmeg powdered. 
Mix all well together, and dredge it with a little 
flour. Put it into a stew-pan, with sufficient gravy 
of cold roast veal to moisten it, and a large table- 
spoonful or more of fresh butter. Stir it well, and 
let it stew till thoroughly done. If the veal has 
been previously cooked, a quarter of an hour v/ill 
be sufficient. It will be much improved by add- 
ing a pint or more of small button mushrooms, cut 
from the stems, and then chopped small. Also, by 
stirring in two table-spoonfuls of cream about five 
minutes before it is taken from the fire.

VEAL WITH OYSTEES.— Take two fine 
cutlets of about a pound each. Divide them into

When the veal is almost done, add to it a pint of 
large, fine oysters, — their liquor thickened with a 
few grated bread-crumbs, and seasoned with mace 
and nutmeg powdered. Contin\;e the frying till

Pour it over the veal, and then give the whole a 
hard stir. Cover it, and let it stew over the fire 
for ten minutes. Then transfer it to a deep dish, 
and send it to table hot. 

Cold roast duck or fowl may be drest as above. 
Also, venison. 

VEAL OLI YES.— Take some cold fillet of 
veal and cold ham, and cut them into thin square 
slices of the same size and shape, trimming the 
edges evenly. Lay a slice of veal on every slice 
of ham, and spread some beaten yolk of eg(^ over 
the veal. Have ready a thin forcemeat, m? de of 
grated bread-crumbs, sweet marjoram rubbe i fine, 
fresh butter, and grated lemon-peel, seasone 1. with 
nutmeg and a little cayenne pepper. Spre xi this 
over the veal, and then roll up each slice tightly 
with the ham. Tie them round securely with coarse 
thread or fine twine ; run a bird-spit through them, 
and roast them well. For sauce, simmer in % small 
sauoe-pan, some cold veal gravy with two ^jpoon 
fills of cream, and some mushroom catchup

VEAL EISSOLES.—Take as much fine wheal 
bread as will weigh one pound, after all the crust is 
cut off. Slice it; put it into a pan and pour ovei 
it as much rich milk as will soak it thoroughly. 
After it has soaked a quarter of an hour, lay it in 
a sieve and press it dry. Mince as finely as pos- 
sible a pound of veal cutlet with six ounces of veal 
suet - then mix in gradually the bread ; adding a 
salt-spoonful of salt, a slight sprinkling of cay- 
enne, and a small tea-spoonful of powdered mace 
and nutmeg mixed; also the yellow rind of a 
lemon grated. Beat two eggs, and moisten the 
mixture with them. Then divide it into equal por 
tions, and with a little flour on your hands roll it 
into oval balls rather smaller than an egg. Strew 
over them some dry bread-crnmbs; then fry them 
in lard or fresh butter — drain them well, and send 
them to table hot. For gravy (which should be 
com^menced before the rissoles) put some bits and 
trimmings of veal into a small sauce-pan, with as 
much water as will cover them ; a very little pep- 
per and salt ; and three or four blades of mace. 
Cover the sauce-pan closely, and let the meat stew 
till all the strength is extracted ; skimming it well. 
Then strain it; return the liquor to the sauce-pan: 
add a bit of butter rolled in flour; and squeeze in 
the juice of a lemon. Give it a boil up, and then, at 
the last, stir in the beaten yolk of an egg. Serve 
up this gravy in a sauce-boat, to eat with the ris- 
soles.

TO PKEPAEE SWEETBEEADS. — The 
flwcetbread belonging to the breast of the calf is 
far superior to that which is found about the throat, 
being larger, whiter, more tender, and more deli- 
cate. Always buy them in preference. They should 
be set immediately on ice, and prepared for cook- 
ing as speedily as possible, for they spoil very soon. 
Soak them in warm water till all the blood is dis- 
charged. Then put them into boiling water, and 
boil them five minutes. After this, lay them im- 
mediately in a pan of very cold water. This sudden 
transition from hot water to cold, will blanch or 
whiten th-em. Dark-colored sweetbreads make a 
very bad appearance. Four are generally sufficient 
for a small dish. But as, if well cooked, they are 
much liked, it is best to have six; or else eight 
upon two dishes. If the sweetbreads are to be cut 
up before cooking, remove and throw away the 
gristle or pipe that pervades every one. If they 
are to be cooked whole, you may leave the pipe in 
to be taken out by the eaters. 

For company, it is usual to lard sweetbreads 
with slips of fat ham or bacon, or of cold smoked 
ixmgue. 

Sweetbreads are used as s de-dishes at dinners, 
frr at n^ce breakfeists.

SWEETBKEAD CROQUETTES. — Having 
trimmed some sweetbreads nicely, and removed tlie 
gristle, parboil them, and then mince them very 
fine. Add grated bread, and season with a lei y 
little salt and pepper; some powdered mace and 
nutmeg ; and some grated lemon-rind. Moisten 
the whole with cream, and make them up into 
small cones or sugar- loaves ; forming and smooth- 
ing them nicely. Have ready some beaten egg, 
mixed with grated bread-crumbs. Dip into it each 
croquette, and fry them slowly in fresh butter. 
Serve them hot ; standing up on the dish, and with 
a sprig of parsley in the top of each. 

Sweetbreads should never be used unless per- 
fectly fr€sh. They spoil very rapidly. As soon 
as they are brought from market they should 
be split open, and laid in cold water. Never 
attempt to keep sweetbreads till next day, except 
in cold weather ; and then on ice. 

Similar croquettes may be made of cold boiled 
chicken ; or cold roast veal ; or of oysters, minced 
raw, and seasoned and mixed as above. 



FRICASSEED SWEETBREADS,— Take half 
a dozen sweetbreads ; clean them thoroughly, and 
lay them for an hour or two in a pan of water, 
having first removed the strings and gristle. Then 
put them into a stew-pan vith as much rich milk 
or cream as wil^. cover them well, and a very little 
salt Stew ihem slowly, till tender throughout, 
and thoroughly done, saving the liquid. Then 



MTSS LRSLTE's new COOK BOOK. 211 

take them up ; cover them ; and set them near the 
fire to keep warm. Prepare a quarter of a pound 
of butter, divided into four pieces, and rolled 
in flour. Put the butter into the milk in which 
the sweetbreads were boiled, and add a few sprigs 
of parsley cut small; five or six blades of mace; 
half a nutmeg grated ; and a very little cayenne 
pepper. Have ready the yolks of three eggs well- 
beaten. Eeturn the sweetbreads to the gravy; let 
it just come to a boil ; and then stir in the beaten 
egg immediately before you take the fricassee from 
the fire, otherwise it will curdle. Serve it up in a 
deep dish with a cover. 

Chickens, cut up, may be fricasseed in this man- 
ner. 

TOMATO SWEETBEEADS.—Cut up a quar- 
ter of a peck (or more) of fine ripe tomatos; set 
them over the fire, and let them stew with nothing 
but their own juice, till they go entirely to pieces. 
Then press them through a sieve, to clear the 
liquid from the seeds and skins. Have ready four 
or five sweetbreads that have been trimmed nicely 
cleared from the gristle, and laid open to soak in 
warm water. Put them into a stew-pan with the 
tomato-juice, seasoned with a little salt and cay 
enne. Add two or three table-spoonfuls of butter 
rolled in flour. Set the sauce-pan over the fire; 
and stew the sweetbreads in the tomato-juice tiU 
they are thoroughly done. A few minutes before 
you take themofl, stir in two beaten yelks of eggs

SWEETBREADS AND CAULIFLOWEES 
— Take four large sweetbreads, and two fine cau 
liflowers. Split open the sweetbreads and remove 
the gristle. Soak them awhile in lukewarm water. 
Then put them into a sauce-pan of boiling water, 
and let them boil ten minutes over the fire. Af- 
terwards, lay them in a pan of very cold water. 
The parboiling will render them white ; and put- 
ting them directly from the hot water into the 
cold will give them firmness. Having washed 
and drained the cauliflowers, quarter them, and 
lay them in a broad stew-pan with the sweet- 
breads upon them, seasoned with a very little 
cayenne, four or five blades of mace, and some 
nutmeg. Add as much water as will cover them ; 
put on closel}?" the lid of the pan, and let the whole 
stew for about an hour. Then take a quarter of 
a pound of fresh butter, and roll it in two table- 
spoonfuls of flour. Add it to the stew with a tea- 
cupful of rich milk or cream, and give it one boil 
up, not more, or the milk may curdle. Serve it 
hot in a deep dish ; the sweetbreads in the middle 
with the gravy poured over them, and the quar- 
tered cauliflowers laid handsomely round. Thia 
Blew will be found delicious. 

Broccoli may be thus stewed with sweetbreada

SWEETBKEAD OMELET.— For an omelet 
of six or seven eggs, take two fine sweetbreads 
Split them, take out the gristle, and soak them iu 
two lukewarm waters, to extract all the blood. 
Then put them into very hot water, boil them ten 
minutes, take them out, set them away to cool, 
and afterwards mince them small, and season 
them with a very little salt and cayenne pepper 
and some grated nutmeg. Beat the eggs (omit- 
ting the whites of two) till very light. Then mix 
in the chopped sweetbreads. Put three ounces or 
more of fresh butter into a small frying-pan, and 
place it over the fire. Stir the butter with a spoon, 
as it melts, and when it comes to a boil put m the 
mixture, stirring it awhile after it is all in. Fry 
it a rich brown. Heat the plate or dish in which 
you turn it out of the pan. An omelet should 
never be turned while frying. The top may be 
well browned by holding above it a salama.ider 
or red-hot shovel. 

If you wish it very thick, have three s"reet 
breads. 

While frying the omelet, lift the edge occasion- 
ally by slipping a knife-blade under it, that th« 
butter may get well underneath. 

If omelets are cooked too much they will be- 
come tough, and leather-like. Many pera<^ti8 
prefer having them sent to table as soft omf\% 
before they have set, or taken the form of a Ci»^ s. 
In this case, serve up the omelet in a deep d ^% 
and help it with a spoon. 



214 MISS Leslie's NEW COOK book. 

SWEETBEEADS AND OYStlllS.—Take 

four sweetbreads, and when they have been soaked 
and blanched, quarter them, and remove the pipe. 
Strain the liquor from three dozen large fresh 
oysters, season it with powdered nutmeg and 
mace, and a little cayenne. Put the quartered 
sweetbreads into a stew-pan, and pour over them 
enough of the oyster-liquor ^o cover them well, 
adding, if you have it, three large spoonfuls of 
the gravy of roast veal, and a quarter of a pound 
of fresh butter, cut into four bits ; each bit rolled 
or dredged in flour. When the sweetbreads are 
done, put in the oysters, (first removing their 
gristle or hard part,) and take them out again as 
soon as they are plumped, which should be in five 
minutes. If allowed to boil, the oysters will 
shiivel, and become hard and tasteless. Add, at 
tbe last, two wine-glasses of cream, and shake 
the pan about, for a few minutes. Serve up in a 
deep dish. 

SWEETBREAD PIES.— Make shells of puff- 
paste, and bake them empty. When done, fill 
them to the top with the above mixture. Have 
ready a lid for eacb pie, baked on a flat plate, and 
lay it on the top of the filling. 



»*»SA/\^^.^^\^yA»S^~<«- 



STEWED SWEETBREADS.— After blanch- 
ing them, extract the pipe very carefully, and fill 
its place with a stuffing made of cold minced 
chicken or veal, minced ham or tongue sweet

aiaTjoxiifii, nutmeg, grated lemon -peel, and the 
crumbled folks of hard-boiled eggs. Fasten the 
openings with small wooden skewers, and put the 
sweetbreads into a broad stew-pan with a thin 
slice of ham under each, and another on the top 
of each, kept in place by a splinter-skewer. Stew 
the sweetbreads in the gravy of roast veal, and 
before you send them to table take out the 
skewers. 

Or make a gravy of uncooked trimmings of 
veal or beef, stewed slowly in as much water 
as will cover them well, and seasoned with pep- 
per and salt — or, stew with the fresh meat, as 
much ham or bacon as will flavor the gravy, 
(using no other salt.) When all the essence is 
extracted from the meat, stir in a bit of butter 
dredged with flour. The flour for gravies should 
be browned. Strain the gravy, and add any 
other flavoring you like. 

To brown flour, spread it evenly on a large 
dish or flat tin, and place it before the fire, or in 
a rather cool oven. Scrape it up from the edges 
where it will get the brownest. Take care it burns 
or blackens nowhere. Keep it for use in a dry 
tin box. 

BAKED SWEETBREADS. — Parboil four 

large sweetbreads, having first blanched them. 

When cold, lard them all over the surface, with 

slips c-f bacon the size of small straws. Lay them 

in a shallow pan, putting under each sweetbread 

a piece of nice fresh butter with a very little flour

mixed into it. Pour into the pan a glass of nicfl 
white wine, mixed with the juice and grated yel- 
low rind of a lemon. Season also with giated 
nutmeg Or for sauce, you may use mushroom 
catchup, with a little salad oil stirred into it. 

If you do not live in a place where nice fresh 
butter is to be obtained, endeavor to do without 
butter at all, rather than use that which is strong, 
rancid, or too salt. Bad butter tastes through 
every thing — spoils every thing, and is also ex- 
tremely unwholesome, as decomposition (or in 
plain terms putrefaction^) has already commenced. 
Rather than use what makes all your food taste 
worse instead of better, try to substitute some- 
thing else — such as beef or fresh pork drippings, 
Buet, lard, or olive oil ; or, molasses, honey, or 
Btewed fruit. We know that with these it is pos- 
sible to live in health for years, without tastine 
butter. Nevertheless, good butter is a good thing, 
and an improvement to all sorts of cookery.

PORK. 

PORK. — Young pork has a thin rind or skin, 
easily indented by pressing with the finger, and 
the lean will break by pinching. If fresh, the 
meat is smooth and dry; but if damp and clammy 
it is tainted If the fat is rough with little ker- 
nels, the pig has had a disease resembling the 
measles, ani to eat it is poisonous. Pigs th*^ 



MISS Leslie's NEW cook book. 217 

have short legs, and thick necks, are the best. 
Pigs fed entirely on slop make very bad pork. 
They should be kept up for at least two months, 
fed with corn, and rot allowed during the time of 
fattening to eat any sort of trash. No animal 
tastes more of its food than a pig. If allowed to 
eat the garbage of fish, they will not only have a 
fishy taste, but a smell of fish so intolerable, when 
cooking, that such pork cannot be endured in the 
house. During the two months that they are 
kept up to fatten, all their food must be whole- 
some as well as abundant, and it does them much 
good to have soap-suds given to them occasionally. 
Let them have plenty of corn, and plenty of fresh 
water. They will thrive better and make finer 
pork, if their pens are not allowed to be dirty. 
No aiaimal actually likes dirt, and even pigs would 
be clean if they knew how. It is very beneficial 
to young pigs to wash them well in soap and water. 
We hiive seen this often done with great care. 

The pork in Spain and Portugal is delicious, 
from being fed chiefly on the large chestnuts, of 
which there is great abundance in those countries. 
These pigs are short-legged and thick-bodied — a 
profitable species. The best pieces of a pig are the 
hind-leg and loin; the next is the shoulder, or fore- 
leg. The spare-rib, (pronounced sparrib by fche 
English,) affords so little meat, and the bones aro 
so tedious to pick, that it is seldom seen oc good 
American table?, nothing being popular with ua 
that cannot be eaten fast or fastish. 

Pork must be thoroughly cooked ; done well, 



218 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK ROOK. 

and completely to the very bone. Who ever asked 
for a slice of pork done rare ? Who could eat pork 
with the blood appearing, when served ? So it is 
with veaL Underdone veal, or underdone chicken, 
is not t: be thought of without disgust. 

Pork, for boiling, is always previously salted or 
corned. Fresh pork, however, is very good stewed 
or cooked slowly in a very little water, and with 
plenty of vegetables in the same pot. The vege- 
tables should be potatos, (either sweet or white,) 
pared and cut into pieces — parsnips the same, or 
yams in thick slices. For corned pork cook the 
vegetables separately from the meat, or they will 
taste too salt and fat. They should be cabbage, 
or green sprouts, green beans or peas, green corn, 
young poke, squash, pumpkin, or cashaw, (winter 
squash,) boiled, mashed, and squeezed. 

For salt pork, in winter, have dried beans or 
dried peas; first boiled, and then baked. 



^■^^#^vw-. 



TO ROAST PORK.— The roasting pieces are 
«he loin, the leg, the saddle, the fillet, the shoulder 
and the spare-rib, (which last is found between the 
shoulder or fore-leg,) and the griskin or back- bone. 
All roast pork should be well seasoned ; rubbed 
with pepper, salt, or powdered sage or marjoram. 
Score the skin with a sharp knife, making deep 
lines at regular distances, about an inch apart 
Cross these lines with others, so as to form squares 
or diamonds. Make a stuffing of minced sage or 
marjoram leaves ; bread-crumbs ; if liked, a very 



mss Leslie's new cook book. 219 

Kttle minced onion previously boiled ; and some 
powdered mace. Introduce this stuffing profusely 
wherever it can be inserted, loosening a piece of 
the skin, and fastening it down again with a small 
skewer. In a leg or shoulder you can put in a 
great deal at the knuckle. In a fillet or large end 
of the leg, stuff the place from whence you have 
taken the bone. Put the pork down to roast not 
very close to the fire, but place it nearer when 
the skin begins to brown. You can soon baste 
it with its own gravy; and see that it is tho- 
roughly cooked, before removing it from the spit. 
After taking up the meat, skim the fat from the 
gravy, and stir in a little flour to thicken it. 

The crackling or skin will be much more crisp 
and tender if you go all over it with sweet oil, or 
lard, before you put it to the fire. 

Always accompany roast pork with apple sauce, 
served in a deep dish or a sauce-tureen. 

Cold roast pork is very good sliced at tea or 
breakfast, 

SWEET POTATO POKK.— Boil, peel, and 
mash a sufficiency of sweet potatos, moistened 
with butter and egg. Cover with them the bottom 
of a deep dish ; then put on a layer of slices of 
fresh pork, sprinkled with minced sage or marjo- 
ram. Next, another thick layer of mashed sweet 
potatos ; then another ky er of pork cutlets, and so 
on till thf) dish is full, finishing with mashed sweet 
potatos. Bake it brown on the surface. 



220 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

CnESTNUT PORK.— Where the large Span- 
ish chestnuts abound, a similar dish may be made 
of layers of chestnuts boiled, peeled, and mashed, 
and layers of fresh pork in thin slices. 



^ •^ ^>#^sA<v~. 



ROASTED SPARE-RIB.— This will do for a 
second dish at the table of a very small family 
Rub it all over with powdered sage, pepper, and 
salt, and having put it on the spit, lay the thick- 
est end to the fire. Dredge it with powdered sage 
and baste it with a little butter. When dished, 
have ready Sv-^me mashed potatos made into flat 
cakes, and browned on the top, and laid all round 
the pork, with some in another dish. Send to table 
a; pie sauce also. , 

When apples are difficult to procure, substitute 
dried peaches, stewed very soft, and in no more 
water than remains about them after being washed 
Sweeten them while hot, as soon as you take them 
from the fire, mashing them smoothly. 



TO DRESS A YOUNG PIG.— The pig shoula 
not be more than three weeks old. If not fat, it is 
unfit to eat. To be in perfection, a sucking pig 
should be eaten the day it is killed, or its good- 
ness and tenderness is impaired every hour. It 
requires great care in roasting, lUid constant watch- 
mg. The custom of roasting a very young pig has 
now gone much into disuse, it being found that 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 221 

baking answers the purpose equally well or better, 
and is far less troublesome. 

The pig sbould be washed perfectly clean, inside 
and out, and wiped very dry. Have ready a stuffing 
made of slices of bread, thickly buttered and soaked 
in milk, seasoned with powdered nutmeg and mace, 
and the grated yellow rind of a lemon, with the hard- 
hoihd yolk of an egg, crumbled, and a large handful, 
or more, of fine bloom raisins, seeded and cut in half, 
mix all these ingredients well, and fill with them the 
body of the pig, sewing it up afterwards. Or you 
may make a plain stuffing of chopped sage and 
onions, boiled together, with marjoram ; and mixed 
with bread-crumbs and butter. Having trus&ed 
the pig, with the fore-legs bent back, and the hind- 
legs forward, rub it all over with sweet oil, or with 
fresh butter tied in a rag. Lay it in a baking-pan, 
with a little water in the bottom. Then set it in 
an oven, not too hot, and bake it well, basting it 
frequently with butter. When done, dish it whole. 
Skim the gravy in the pan, and mix in some flour 
Give it one boil up, having first put into it the 
chopped liver and heart of the pig, taken out after 
it was cooked, and stir in the beaten yolk of an 

The practice is now obsolete of dissecting a pig 
before it goes to table, splitting it down the back, 
and down the front, and laying the two halves in 
reverse positions, or back to back, with one half the 
split head at each side, and one ear at each end, the 
brains being taken out to enrich the gravy. All 
these disgusting things have been discarded by the

better taste of modern epicures. And the pig la 
baked and comes to table whole. We have always 
thought it a most unfeminine fancy for a lady to 
enjoy eating the head of any thing, and the brain 
particularly. 

POBK STEAKS, STEWED.— Take some nice 
fresh pork steaks, cut either from the leg or the 
loin. Trim off the superfluous fat. Season them 
with a little salt and pepper, and plenty of minced 
sage. Put in with them, minced onions, sliced 
sweet potatos, parsnips, and white potatos cut into 
pieces, also some lima beans. Pour in barely suf- 
ficient water to cover them ; or else stew the pork 
in a very little lard. Apples cored, pared, and 
baked whole; the core-place filled with sugar, 
moistened with a very little water, to put in the 
bottom of the baking-dish, are a very nice accom- 
paniment to pork steaks.

POEK AND APPLES.— Take nice steaks, or 
cutlets, of fresh pork. Season them with a little 
pepper, and a very little salt. Pare, core, and 
quarter some fine juicy apples. Flavor them with 
the grated yellow rind and the juice of one or two 
lemons, and strew among them plenty of sugar. 
Stew them with merely sufficient water to pre- 
vent their burning ; or else a little lard without 
water, When thoroughly done, serve all up in the 
same dish. If you cannot procure lemons, flavoj

POEK STEAKS, FEIED.— Cut tliem thin, 
but do not trim off the fat. Sprinkle them well 
all over with finely minced sage or sweet marjo- 
ram. Lay them in a frying-pan, and fry them well 
on both sides, keeping them very hot after they are 
done. Wash out the frying-pan, (or have another 
one ready, which is better,) and put it over the fire 
with plenty of lard, or fresh butter. Have ready 
plenty of slices of large juicy apples, pared, cored, 
and cut into round pieces. Fry them well, and 
when done, take them up on a perforated skimmer, 
to drain the lard from them. Sprinkle them with 
powdered sugar, and pile them on a dish to eal 
with the pork. 

Otherwise, send to table with the pork, a dish of 
apple sauce made in the usual manner, or a dish of 
dried peaches, stewed, mashed, and sweetened.

POEK APPLE POT-PIE.—Make a plentiiul 
quantity of nice paste. With some of it line the 
sides (but not the bottom) of a large pot. At the 
very bottom lay a slice oi fresh pork, with most of 
the fat trimmed off. Season it with a very little 
salt and pepper, and add some pieces of paste. Next 
put ui a thick layer of juicy apples, cut in slices, 
strewed with brown sugar. Add aiiother layer of 
pork, avd another of sliced apples. Proceed thua

•till the pot IS nearly full, finishing with a lid oi 
paste not fitting quite closely. Cut a cross-slit in 
the top, through which pour in some sweet cider 
to moisten it, and set it to cooking. Keep the pot 
covered ; set it at once over a good fire, but not so 
hot as to burn the pie. See that it is well done 
before you take it up. It is a convenient dish in 
the country at the season of apple picking, cider 
making, and pork killing. 

Stewed or baked apples are always greatly im- 
pioved by a flavoring of lemon, rose-water, oi 
nutmeg. 

APPLE PORK PIE.— Core, peel, and quarter 
some fine juicy baking-apples. Make a nice 
paste with fresh butter and sifted flour, and line 
with it the bottom' and sides of a deep dish. 
Put in the apples, and strew among them suffi- 
cient brown sugar to make them very sweet. If 
you can obtain a fresh lemon, pare off very thin 
the yellow rind, and squeeze the juice to flavor the 
apples. Prepare some fresh pork steaks, cut thin, 
and divested of all the fat except a little at the 
edge; removing the bone. Cover the apples with 
a layer of meat, and pour in a tea-cup of sweet cider. 
The contents of the pie should be heaped up in the 
centre. Have ready a nice lid of paste, and cover 
the pie with it, closing and crimping the edge. Jn 
the centre of the lid cut a cross-slit. Put it into a 
hot oven and bake it well. This is a £arm-houBe 
disli, and very good. Try it.

Apples have always been considered a suitable 
ftccompaniment to fresh pork. 



~»<W<V/N^^^'^#^V^^«^ 



FILLET OF PORK.— Cut a fillet or round, 
kjksdsomely and evenly, from a fine leg of fresh 
pork. Remove the bone. Make a stuffing or 
forcemeat of grated bread-crumbs ; butter ; a tea- 
spoonful of sweet marjoram, or tarragon leaves; 
and sage leaves enough to make a small table- 
spoonful, when minced or rubbed fine; all well 
mixed, and slightly seasoned with pepper and salt. 
Then stuff it closely into the hole from whence the 
bone was taken. Score the skin of the pork in 
circles to go all round the fillet. These circles 
should be very close together, or about half an 
inch apart. Rub into them, slightly, a little pow- 
dered sage. Put it on the spit, and roast it well, 
till it is thoroughly done throughout ; as pork, if 
the least underdone, is not fit to eat. Place it, for 
the first hour, not very close to the fire, that the 
meat may get well heated all through, before the 
skin begins to harden so as to prevent the heat 
from penetrating sufficiently. Then set it as near 
the fire as it can be placed without danger of 
scorching. Keep it roasting steadily with a bright, 
good, regular fire, for two or three hours, or longer 
still if it is a large fillet. It may require near four 
hours. Baste it at the beginning with sweet oil 
(which will make the skin very crisp) or with lard. 
Aftei'wards, baste it with its own gravy. When 
done, skim the fat from the gravy, and then dredge

in a little flour to thicken it. Send the pork to 
table with the gravy in a boat ; and a deep dish of 
apple sauce, made very thick, flavored with lemon, 
and sweetened well. 

A fillet of pork is excellent stewed slowly in a 
very little water, having in the same stew-pot some 
Bweet potatos, peeled, split, and cut into long 
pieces. If stewed, put no sage in the stu^ng ; and 
remove the skin of the pork. This is an excellent 
family dish in the autumn.

ITALIAN POEK.— Take a nice leg of fresh 
pork ; rub it well with fine salt and let it lie in the 
salt for a week or ten days. When you wish to 
cook it, put the pork into a large pot, with just 
sufficient water to cover it; and let it simmer, 
slowly, during four hours; skimming it well. 
Then take it out, and lay it on a large dish. Pour 
the water from the pot into an earthen pan ; skim 
it, and let it cool while you are skinning the pork. 
Then put into a pot, a pint of good cider vinegar, 
mixed with half a pound of brown sugar, and a 
pint of the water in which the pork has been 
boiled, and from which all the fat has been care- 
fully skimmed off. Put in the pork with the upper 
side towards the bottom of the pot. Set it again 
over the fire, (which must first be increased,) and 
heat the inside of the pot-lid by standing it up- 
right against the front of the fire. Then cover 
the pot closely, and let the pork stew for an hour 
and a half longer ; basting it frequently with the 



MISS Leslie's NEW COOK BOOK. 227 

liquid around it, and keeping the pot-lid as hot ai^ 
possible that the meat may be well browned 
When done, the pork will have somewhat the ap 
pearance of being coated with molasses Serve up 
the gravy with it. What is left of the meat may 
be sliced cold for breakfast or luncheon. 

You may stew with it, when the pork is put into 
the pot a second time, some large chestnuts, pre 
viously boiled and peeled. Or, instead of chestnuts, 
sweet potatos, scraped, split, and cut into smal! 
pieces. 

POEK OLIYES.— Cut slices from a fillet or 
leg of cold fresh pork. Make a forcemeat in the 
■isual manner, only substituting for sweet herbs 
some sage-leaves, chopped fine. When the slices 
are covered with the forcemeat, and rolled up and 
tied round, stew them slowly either in cold gravy 
left of the pork, or in fresh lard. Drain them well 
before they go to table. Serve them up on a bed 
of mashed turnips, or potatos, or of mashed sweet 
potatos, if in season. 



PIGS' FEET, FEIED.— Pigs' feet are fre- 
quently used for jelly, instead of calves' feet. They 
are very good for this purpose, but a larger num. 
ber is required (from eight to ten or twelve) to 
make the jelly sufficiently firm. After they have 
been boiled for jelly, extract the bones, and put the 
meat into a deep dish : cover it with some good cider 
vinegar seasoned with sugar and a little salt and

cayenue Then cover tlie dish, and set it away foT 
the night. Next morning, take out the meat, and 
having di-ained it well from the vinegar, put it 
into a frying-pan, in which some lard has just come 
to a boil, and fry it for a breakfast dish. 



"^^^^^^■^■^ 



PORK AND BEANS.— Take a good piece of 
pickled pork, (not very fat,) and to each pound of 
pork allow a quart of dried white beans. The bone 
should be removed from the pork, and the beans well 
picked and washed. The evening before they are 
wanted for cooking, put the beans and pork to soak 
in separate pans ; and just before bed- time, drain off 
the water, and replace it with fresh. Let them 
soak all night. Early in the morning, drain them 
well from the water, and wash first the beans, and 
then the pork in a cullender. Having scored the 
skin in stripes, or diamonds, put the pork into a 
pot with fresh cold water, and the beans into 
another pot with sufficient cold water to cook them 
well. Season the pork with a little pepper, but, 
of course, no salt. Boil them separately and slowly 
till the pork is thoroughly done (skimming it well) 
and till the beans have all burst open. Afterwards 
take them out, and drain them well from the water. 
Then lay the pork in the middle of a tin pan, 
(there must be no liquid fat about it) and the beans 
round it, and over it, so as nearly to bury it from 
sight. Pour in a very little water, and set the 
dis»' into a hot oven, to bake or brown for half an 
hour. If kept too long in the oven the beans wiD 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 229 

become dry and hard. If sufficiently boiled when 
separate, half an hour will be long enough for the 
pork and beans to bake together. Carefully skim 
off' any liquid fat that may rise to the surface. Cover 
tlie dish, and send it to table hot. 

For a small dish, two quarts of beans and two 
fM>tmds of pork will be enough. To this quantitj', 
when put to bake ' in the oven, you may allow a 
pint of water. 

This is a good plain dish, very popular in New 
England, and generally liked in other parts of the 
country, if properly done 

PORK WITH CORN AND BEAJ^TS.— Boil a 
nice small leg of corned pork, skim it well, and boil 
it thoroughly. Then have ready a quart, or more, 
of fresh string-beans, each boan cut into only three 
pieces. Boil the bean? for an hour in a separate 
pot. In another pot boil four ears of young 
sweet corn, and when soft and tender, cut it down 
from the cob, with a sharp knife, and mix it with 
the boiled beans, having drained them, through a 
cullender, from all the water that is about them. 
Having mixed them well together, in a deep dish, 
season them with pepper, (no salt,) and add a lars^e 
lump of fresh butter. 

For green beans you may substitute dried white 
ones, boiled by themselves, well drained, and sea- 
soned with pepper and butter, and mixed in the 
same dish before they are sent to table. Or the 
mixed corn and beans may be heaped round th* 
p^^k upor the same dish. 



230 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

To eat with them make some indian dumpling? 
of corn meal and water, mixed into a stiff dough, 
formed into thick dumplings, about as large round 
as the top of a tea-cup, and boiled in a pot by 
themselves. 

POEK WITH PEAS PUDDING.— Boil a 
nice piece of pickled or corned pork, (the leg is tho 
best,) and let it be well skinned, and thoroughly 
cooked. To make the pudding, pick over and 
wash through cold water, a quart of yellow split 
peas, and tie them in a square cloth, leaving barely 
safiicient room for them to swell ; but if too much 
space is allowed for swelling, they will be weak 
and washy. When the peas are ail dissolved intc 
a mass, turn them out of the cloth, and rub them 
through a coarse sieve into a pan. Then add a 
quarter of a pound of fresh butter, mixed well 
Lato the peas, and a very little pepper. Beat light, 
three yolks and one whole egg, and stir them into 
ttK^ peas a little at a time. Then beat the whole 
vary hard. Dip your pudding-cloth into hot 
water ; spread it out in a pan, and pour the mix- 
ture into it. Tie up the cloth, and put the pudding 
into a pot of boiling water. Let it boil steadily 
for at least an hour. When done, send it to table, 
and eat it with the pork. 

Next day, if there is much left, boil both the 
pork and the pudding over again, (the remains of 
the pudding tied in the cloth.) Lst them boil till 
thoroughly warmed throughout. Cut them in slices.

tliem to the breakfast table, for strong healthy 
eaters. 

SAUSAGE-MEAT.— To fifteen pounds of the 
lean of fresh pork, allow five pounds of the fat. 
ITaving removed the skin, sinews, and gristle, 
chop both the fat and lean as fine as possible, and 
mix them well together. Eub to a powder suffi- 
cient sage-leaves to make four ounces when done. 
Mix the sage with two ounces of fine salt, two 
ounces of brown sugar, an ounce of powdered black 
pepper, and a quarter of an ounce of cayenne. Add 
this seasoning to the chopped pork, and mix it 
thoroughly. Pack the sausage-meat down, hard 
and closely, into stone jars, which must be kept in 
a cool place, and well covered. When wanted for 
use, make some of it into small flat cakes, dredge 
them with flour, and fry them well. The fat that 
exudes from the sausage-cnkes, while frying, will 
be sufficient to cook them in. 



««tf^S^#i^)#^^W«>~« 



SAUSAGE DUMPLING.— Make a good paslo 
m the proportion of three mashed potatos, and a 
quarter of a pound of finely minced suet to a quart 
of flour. Eoll it out into a thick sheet. Fill it 
with the best home-made sausage meat. Lay 
the sausage meat in an even heap on the sheet of 
dough, and close it up so as to form a largo round 
dumpling. Dip a square cloth iu boiling water,

dumpling in it, leaving room for it to swell. l*ut 
it into a pot of boiling water, and keep it boiling 
hard till thoroughly done. Bo not turn it till 
immediately before it goes to table. It requires 
no sauce but a little cold butter. It may be made 
iiilo several small dumplings. 



VEAL AND SAUSAGE PIE.— Line a deep 
oval dish with a very nice paste. Lay at the bot- 
tom a thin veal cutlet, seasoned with powdered 
mace. Place upon it some of the best sausage 
meat, spread thin ; then another veal cutlet, and 
then more sausage. Eepeat this till the dish is 
full, finishing with sausage meat on the top. Then 
cover the pie with a rather thick lid or upper 
crust, uniting the two edges at the rim, by crimp- 
ing or notching them neatly. Make a cross slit 
in the centre of the lid. Bake the pie well, and 
serve it up hot. 

Put no water into this pie, as the veal and the 
sausage will give out sufficient gravy. We recom- 
mend this pie. 

If you live where veal cannot always be pro- 
cured, substitute chicken or turkey, boiled and 
cut up, and covered with layers of sausage ; or 
else thin slices of venison; or else, the best part 
of a pair of boiled or roasted rabbits.

BOLOGNA SAUSAGES.— Take three pounds 
of the lean of a round of corned or salted beef 



MTSS Leslie's NEW cook book. 238 

and three pounds of the lean of corned or salted 
pork. Boil them for an hour in separate pots 
Take them up, let them grow cold, and chop them 
separately. Chop also, very fine, two pounds 
of the fat of bacon, and one pound of beef suet 
When these things are all separately minced, mix 
them well together, seasoning them well with 
chopped sage, sweet marjoram, black pepper, and 
powdered mace. Also, if liked, two or three 
boiled onions minced very small. Have ready 
some of the large skins commonly used for these 
sausages. The skins must have been carefully 
emptied, washed, and scraped till quite transpa 
rent. Fill them with the above mixture, stuffing 
it in hard and evenly with a sausage-stuffer, sew- 
ing and tying both ends securely. Put the sau- 
sages into a brine or pickle, such as is made for 
ham, of salt, brown sugar, anr* molafs^'es mixed 
with water, and strong enough to bear up ^n egg. 
Let the sausages remain a week in this pickle 
turning them every day, and keeping it closely 
covered. Then take them out and hang them up 
to dry, tied in strings or links. Smoke them for a 
week over a fire of oak sticks or corn-cobs. Af- 
terwards, rub them over with salad oil, which is 
much the better for being mixed with ashes of 
vine twigs. 

Sausages made faithfully as above, will be found 
equal to the real Bologna, by the lovers of this 
Bort of relish. When it is eaten they are sliced 
very thin. Few ladies eat them.

HOG^ HEAD CHEESE.— iiog's head cheese 
is always made at what is called "killing time." 
To mr.ke four cheeses of moderate size., take two 
large hog's ht"!ads ; two sets, (that is eight feet,) 
and tfee noses of all the pigs that have been killed 
that day. Clean all these things well, and then boil 
them to rags. Having drained off the liquid 
through a cullender, spread out the things in large 
dishes, and carefully remove all the bones, even 
to the smallest bits. With a chopper mince the 
meat as fine as possible, and season it well with 
pepper, salt, sage, and sweet m-arjoram, adding 
5omo powdered mace. Having divided the pre- 
pared meats into four equal parts, tie up each 
portion tightly in a clean coarse cloth, and press 
it into a compact cake, by putting on heavy 
weights. It will be fit for use next day. In a 
cool dry place it will keep ail winter. It requires 
no farther cooking, and is eaten sliced at break- 
fast, luncheon, or supper. If well made, and well 
seasoned with the herbs and spices, it will be found 
very nice for a relish. 

LIVER PUDDINGS.— Boil some pigs' livers, 
and when cold mince them, adding some cold 
ham or bacon, in the proportion of a pound of 
liver to a quarter of a pound of fat bacon. Add 
also some boiled pigs' feet, allowing to each pound 
of liver four pigs' feet boiled, skinned, boned, and 
chopped. Season with pepper, powdered mace or 
nutmeg, and sweet herbs, (sweet basil and marjo

ram.) Put the mixture (packed hard) into 
straight-sided tin or white ware pans, and cover 
them with a clean cloth. Put heavy weights on 
the top. Cover them also with folded brown paper, 
and set them in a cool dry place. They will be fit 
to eat next day. Slice them thick, and send them to 
the tea or breakfast table. Or you may fill with 
the mixture, some nicely cleaned and very tran- 
sparent sausage skins, (of a large size,) and tie up 
tlie ends with coarse brown thread, to be removed 
before going to table. 

You may cut them into large pieces, and broil 
them, or fry them in lard. 

Calves' liver makes still nicer puddings. 

Keep liver puddings in flat stone jars. 

Never use newspaper to cover or wrap up any 
thing eatable. The black always rubs off; and 
the copperas '.n the printing ink is very poisonous. 



HAM, etc. 

BHINE FOE PICKLING MEAT.— To every 
four gallons of water allow four pounds of fine salt, 
two ounces of saltpetre, three pounds of brown 
sugar, and two quarts of West India molasses. 
Boil the whole together, stirring it well, and skim- 
ming it after stirring. When clear, let it cool. 
The meal being clean and dry, rub it all over v. Hh 
ground red pepper. Then put as much jichlx

into the pickling-tub as can be very well coveieJ 
by the brine, which must be poured on cold 
Let it remain six weeks in the pickle, (carefully 
taking off the scum,) and turning each piece every 
day. Afterwards, hang it till it is dry outside, 
and then smoke it well for a fortnight, hanging it 
high above the fire with the large end downward. 
The fire in the smoke-house should be steadily 
s:ept up all the time. Hickory or oak is the best 
wood for this purpose. On no account use pine, 
cedar, spruce, or hemlock. They will communi- 
cate to the meat a strong taste of turpentine, and 
render it uneatable, A fire made of corn-cobs is 
excellent for smoking meat, and they should be 
saved for that purpose. When the meat is smoked, 
rub it all over with ground pepper to prevent in- 
sects, and sew up all the pieces in new cotton 
cloths, coarse and thick, and then white- wash 
them. We have seen ham-covers, painted with 
flowers and gilded. Since California, gilding per- 
vades the land. 

This pickle will be found excellent for hams, 
bacon, tongues, or beef. Meat for pickling must 
be very fresh, and of excellent quality. Before 
sewing it up in covers see that it is free from in 
sects. If to go to sea, pack in boxes of powdered 
charcoal for a long voyage, i'oi a short one, 
barrels of woodashes will do.

TO CUKE HAMS.— To make good hams the 
pork must be of the best quality. No animal tastes

«o inuch of its food as the pig. In America, we 
nonsider a pig " killed off the slop" as unfit to 
eat ; and so he is. All our pigs are kept up in a 
pen, and fattened with Indian corn, or corn meal, 
for several weeks previous to killing. A hundred 
pounds of corn meal, (mixed with water to about 
the consistency of very thick mush,) is said to 00 
equal in fattening pigs to two hundred pounds of 
dry-shelled corn. They should be kept up, and well 
fed for eight weeks ; and occasionally, in the coun 
try, where such fruits are superabundant, the pigs 
should have a regale of melons, peaches, (fee. 
This we have seen, and the pork was, of course, 
very fine. The hams or hind-quarters are consi- 
dered the most valuable part of the animal. They 
are cured in various modes. But the Newbold 
receipt has hitherto been the most popular. Mr. 
Newbold was a Pennsylvania farmer. The follow- 
ing directions, we believe, are authentic. 

For one hundred pounds of fine pork, take 
seven pounds of coarse salt, five pounds of brown 
sugar, two ounces of saltpetre, half an ounce of 
pearlash, and four gallons of water. Boil all to- 
gether, and skim the pickle when cold. Pour it 
on the meat. Let hams or tongues remain in the 
pickling-tub eight weeks. Before it is smoked, 
hang it up and dry it two or three days. Three 
weeks will be safficient for pickling beef. Pre- 
vious to sewing the hams in cases, rub them all 
over with ground black pepper. 

Soap-suds given frequently to pigs, when kept 
up to fatten, will greatly promote their healtL

BOILED HAM. — Having soaked a fine ham 
from early in the evening till near bed -time, put- 
ting it into \^arm water, and changing that water 
about ten or eleven o'clock — wash and brush it 
well in the morning, and trim it so as to look 
nicely all over. Lay at the bottom of the ham- 
boiler a bed of nice fresh hay, which will greatly 
improve the flavor. Let the hock bone be sawed 
off short. A long shank bone looks very awk- 
ward. Place the ham upon the hay — pour in 
plenty of cold water, and keep it simmering very 
slowly an hour before you allow it to boil. Then 
increase the heat gradually, and keep the ham boil- 
ing steadily for four, five, or six hours, according to 
its size and age. An old ham requires more soak 
ing and boiling than a new one. Skim it fre 
quently after the boiling begins. It will be much 
improved by transferring it to a spit, (having 
taken off the whole skin,) and roasting the ham^ 
for the last two or three hours, basting it with its 
own essence. Save the skin to cover the cold ham, 
and keep it fresh. Before it goes to table cover 
the ham with grated bread- crumbs, sifted on so as 
to form a slight crust. 

If the ham is to be eaten cold, and is intonJed 
for company, brush it all over with beaten yolk 
of egg. Then dredge on sufficient gristed crumbs 
to form a crust half an inch thick, and finish by 
going all over it with cream. Set it to browa in 
an oven, or put it on the spit of a roaster. When 
cold, this glazing will be found surpassingly fine. 
Decorate the hock with white paper, handsomely

tables. 

Carve a ham in very thin slices — if cut thick, 
ihey have not the same taste, besides looking un- 
fenteelly. 

BAKED HAM.— For baking, take a small ham, 
ar part of a large one, trimmed and made of good 
ihape, cutting away whatever looks unsightly 
Have the bone sawed off at the knuckle, or end 
3f the hock. The evening previous to cooking, 
lay the ham in soak in a large pan of hot WKter 
At bed-time pour off the water, and renew it. 
Keep it closely covered all night. In the inorn- 
ing wash and brush it well. Make a coarse pcurie 
of coarse flour mixed with water only, and roll it 
out about an inch thick. Line a clean iron bako- 
oven with this, and put in the ham, resorying 
enough of paste to cover the top. Pour in a very 
little water, merely sufficient to keep the ham 
from burning. Put 0*1 the lid of paste, and having 
wet the edges slightly press them together, so as to 
unite closely the top and bottom crust. J^ake it 
over a steady fire, from four to five or six hours, 
or more, according to its size. When done, skim 
the gravy, remove the paste, (which is of no far 
ther use,) and take off the skin of the ham. 
Tredge it all over with finely grated bread- 
crumbs, before it goes to table. A ham can 
scarcely be cooked too much, and too slow. The 
genf^ral fault is in cooking them too little, and too 
last. A ham of the smallest size will require at

leudt four hours baking or boiling, even after it 
has Ijoen all night in soak. Save the skin whole, 
to cover the cold ham when it is put away in the 
pantry. 

When a cooked ham is nearly all used up, take 
what remains, cut it all off from the bone, and 
stew the bits in a little water, till they are all to 
rags. You will find the essence an improvement 
to gravies, strained from the fragments.

MADEIRA HAM.— This is a dish only seen 
at dinner parties. No one can believe, for a mo- 
ment, that hams really cooked in Madeira wine 
are served up every week at hotels, particularly 
at thuse houses where there is no other superfluity, 
and whore most of the grea^, dishes exist only in 
the bill of fare. A genume Madeira ham is 
cooked as follows : — Take a ham of the very finest 
sort ; should be a Westphalia one. Lay it in hot 
water, and soak it all day and all night, changing 
the water several times, and every time washing 
out the pan. Early in the morning of the second 
day, put the ham into a large pot of cold water 
and boil it slowly during four hours, skimming it 
well. Then take it out, remove the skin entirely 
and put the ham into a clean boiler, with sufficient 
Madeira wine to cover it well. Boil, or rather 
stew it, an hour longer, keeping the pot covered 
except when you remove the lid to turn the ham 
When well stev^-^d take it up, drain it, and strain 
the liquor into a porcelain-lined saucepaa Have

Mix some orange or lemon-juice with the liquoi 
a Iding plenty of sugar and nutmeg. Give it ono 
l)oil up over the fire, and serve it up in a tureen, 
a? sauce to the ham. 

What is left of the ham may be cut next day 
into small pieces, put into a stew-pan, with the 
remains of the liquor or sauce poured over it, and 
stewed for a quarter of an hour or more. Serve 
it up all together in the same dish. While it is 
on nie fire, add a little butter to the stew.

BROILED HAM.—Ham for broiling or frying 
should be cut into thin slices the evening before, 
trimmed, and laid in a pan of boiling water, 
which, near bed-time, should be changed for cold 
water, and very early in the morning for boiling 
water, in which it should lie half an hour to soak 
still longer. If ham is not well soaked previously, 
it will, when broiled or fried, be disagreeably 
hard and salt ; the salt frying out to the surface 
and forming a rough unpleasant crust, which will 
create thirst in the eaters for hours after. Much 
oi the salt of a ham goes off in boiling, but if it 
is not boiled or soaked, the salt comes out to the 
.-surface and there it sticks. The slices being cut 
thin and nicely trimmed, they should be broiled 
on % very clean gridiron ovor a clear fire, and so

Dish thera hot, and lay on every slice a very small 
bit of fresh butter, and sprinkle them with peppei 



»*^s/^/^*■<^'*^#^^*^w 



FEIED HAM.— Ham for frying need not be 
quite so thin as for broiling. Put but little butter 
m the frying-pan, as their own fat is generally 
sufficient to cook them. Break an egg over the 
middle of each slice, and let it cook till the white 
is set, and the yolk appears round and yellow 
through it. Before it goes to table trim off nicel}' 
the discolored and ragged edges of the fried eggs 
They look disgusting when left on. 

Cold ham is excellent for broiling or frying, 
and very nice without any further cooking. Send 
it to table strewed with either nasturtion flowers, 
pepper-grass, or parsley. All these things have 
a fine flavor of their own, especially nasturtions.

soaked some nice ham, cut it into ratlier thick 
slices, and tlien cut these slices ir^o moutlifuls oi 
little narrow slips. Put tVem in^o a hoc frying 
pan, and fry them well. AV hen dane, season theL-i

add a beaten egg just before they go to table. 

You ma V add to the ham some bits of cold boiled 
chicken, pulled in little slips, from the breast, and 
fried with the ham, adding a little fresh butter,

V' SLICED HAM. — Slice very thiu some cold 
boiled liam, and let the slices be nearly of the same 
size and appearance, making them look as hand- 
some as 3^ou can. Cover them with fresh greet 
pepper-grass at a summer oreakfast or tea table 
and decorate the pepper-grass by interspersing with 
it some nasturtion flowers, which are very nice to 
eat, having a taste agreeably and slightly pungent. 
Pepper-grass and nasturtions, are very appetizing 
accompaniments to nice bread and butter 



DISGUISED HAM.— Scrape or grate a pound 
of cold boiled ham, twice as much lean as fat. 
Season it slightly with pepper and a little powdered 
mace or nutmeg. Beat the yolks only, of three 
eggs, and mix with them the ham. Spread the 
mixture thickly over slices of very nice toast, with 
the crust pared oj5j and the toast buttered while hot. 
Brush it slightly on the surface with white of egg, 
and then brown it with a red hot shovel or sala- 
mander. This is a nice breakfast dish.

HAM CAKE.— This should be made the day 
before it is wanted. Take the remains of a cold 
ham. Cut it into small bits, and pound it wel. 
(fat and lean together) in a marble mortar, adding 
gome butter and grated nutmeg; or a little cream, 
sufficient to moisten it throughout. Fill a mould 
with the mixture, and set it for half an hour into

mould for a few miniites into liot water, and then 
turn out the ham cake on a dish. Cover the sur- 
face all over with a coating of beaten white of egg. 
And before it is quite dry, decorate it with capers, 
cr pickled nasturtion seeds, arranged in a pattern. 
Send small bread rolls to the supper table with 
the han: cake. 

HAM OMELET.— Mince very fine some cold 
boiled ham, (twice as much lean as fat,) till you 
have a half pint. Break six eggs, and strain 
them into a shallow pan. Beat them till very 
light and thick, and then stir in gradually the 
minced ham. Have ready, in a hot omelet pan, 
three table-spoonfuls of lard. When the lard boils, 
put in the omelet mixture and fry it. Occasionally 
slip a knife under the edge to keep it loose from 
the pan. It should be near an inch thick, as a 
ham omelet is best not to fold over Make it a 
good even shape ; and when one side is done, turn 
the other and brown it. You can turn it easily 
with a knife and fork, holding carefally, close to 
the omelet, the hot dish on which it is to go to 
table. Dredge the surface with a little cayenne. 

Omelets maybe made in this manner, of smoked 
tongue, or oysters chopped, cold sweetbread, as- 
paragus minced, boiled onions, mushrooms, &o 
A good allowance for a small omelet is the aboy^ 
proportion of eggs and lard, or fi esh butter ; and 
a large tea-cup of the seasoni'?g article, which must 
always have been previously cooked.

full size, and not folded over in halfs. A large 
omelet must have from eight to ten, or a dozer* 
eggs. It is best to hake all omelets of the six eg§ 
size, and have, more in number if required.

HAM TOAST. — Make some very nice slicMi 
of toast, with all the crust trimmed off; and di;i 
each toast for an instant into a bowl of hot water, 
then butter it slightly. Have ready some grated 
cold ham, and spread it thick over each slice of 
toast. Tongue toast is made in the same manner. 



SANDWICHES.— Spread some thin slices ci 
bread very thinly with nice fresh butter, and la^ 
a thin slice of cold ham (the edges neatly trimmed) 
between every two slices of bread and butter 
You may make them so thin, as to roll up- 
n amber being piled on a plate.

BISCUIT SANDWICHES.—This is a very 
nice and very pretty dish for a supper table. Have 
ready one or two dozen of fresh soft milk biscuit. 
Split them, and take a very little of the soft crumb 
out of each biscuit, so as to make a slight hollow. 
Butter the biscuits with very nice fresh butter, and 
fill them liberally with grated ham or tongue, 
Stick round the inside of the edges, fall sprigs 
of pepper-grass, or curled parsley, or the green

handsomely, so as to project out all round the 
aides, forming a green border or fringe. We 
highly recommend biscuit sandwiches.

POTTED HAM.— Take some cold ham, slice 
it, and mince it small, fat and lean together. Then 
pound it in a mortar; seasoning it as ycu proceed 
with cayenne pepper, powdered mace, and pow- 
dered nutmeg. Then fill with it a large deep pan, 
and set it in an oven for half an hour. Afterwards 
pack it down hard in a stone jar, and fill up the 
jar with lard. Cover it closely, and paste down a 
thick paper over the jar. If sufficiently seasoned, 
it will keep well in winter; and is convenient for 
sandwiches, or on the tea-table. A jar of this will 
be found useful to travelers in remote places. 

Tongue may be potted as above.

TO PREPARE BACON.— All pieces of pork 
i,hat, after pickling, are dried and smoked, come 
under the denomination of bacon ; except the hind- 
quarters or legs, and they are always called ham, 
and are justly considered superior to any other 
part of the animal, and bring a higher price. The 
shoulders or fore-quarters, the sides or flitches, the 
jowl or head, and all the other parts, are designated 
as bacon; and in some places they erroneously 
give that name to the whole animal, if cured, or 
preserved by the process of smoking. 

To prepare bicon for being cooked, examine it ,

well, and scrape it carefully, and trim off all un- 
sightly parts. -If the fat is yellow, tlie meat is 
rusty or tainted, and not fit to eat. So, also, if on 
the lean there are brownish or blackish spots. 
All sorts of food, if kept too long, should be 
tl'.rown away at once. 

If perfectly good, prepare the bacon for cooking, 
by washing it well, and then soaKing it for several 
hours in a pan full of cold water, removing the 
water once or twice during the process. K the 
bacon is salt and hard, soak it all night, changing 
the water at bed-time, and early in the morning. 

Ham should also be soaked before cooking. 

A dish of broiled ham is a nice accompaniment 
to one of calves' chitterlings, at breakfast. 



.~«»*/SA*^ ^ ^^^^*s«^ 



TO BOIL BACON.— Put two or three pounds 
of nice bacon into a pot with plenty of cold water, 
and let it simmer slowly for an hour before it be- 
gins to boil. Skim it well, and when no more 
scum rises, put in the vegetables which are usually 
eaten with bacon, and which taste better for boil- 
ing with the meat. These are young greens, or 
sprouts, very young roots and leaves of the poke 
plant, and green beans — strung and cut in half— 
not smaller. On no account should any other vege- 
lables r>e boiled with bacon. When the bacon is 
so temJer as to be easily pierced through with a 
fork, even in the thickest places, taks it up and 
diain it well in a cullender or sieve. Bemove the 
akin. Then take up the vegetables and drain them 
15 



248 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

also, pressing out all the liquid. Season tliem witL 
pepper only. Send the meat to table with the ve 
i^etables heaped round it, on the same large tlish, 
(th 3 cabbage being chopped, but not minced fi ne.) 
Potatos, squashes, peas, asparagus, &c., should 
never be boiled in the same pot, or served up in 
the same dish with bacon, which is too plain a dish 
for any but a country table ; while a ham is a de- 
licacy foj' the city, or for any place. 

BACON AND BEAKS.—Scrape and trim a 
nice piece of bacon, (not too fat,) and see that no 
part of it looks yellow or rusty, or shows any ap- 
pearance of bein^ too old. If so, do not cook it, 
as it is unwholesome, unpalatable, and unfit to eat. 
A shoulder is a good piece to boil. The best of tho 
animal, when smoked, is, of course, the ham or leg. 
We are now speaking of the other pieces that, 
when cured, are properly called bacon, and are 
eaten at plain tables only. 

The meat, if very salt, is the better for being 
put in soak early in the morning, or tlie night be- 
fore. Afterwards put it into a pot, and boil and 
skim it till tender. Ilave ready a quart or two of 
fresh green string beans, cut into three pieces, (not 
more); put them into the pot in which the bacon is 
boiling, and let them cook with the meat for ^q 
hour or more. When done, tako them, out, drain 
them well; season them well with pepper, and send 
them to table on a separate dish from the bacon. 

Many persons like so well this bacon flavor, that

t*hey ahvays, when boiling string-beans, pnt a 
small piece of bacon in tbe pot, removing it before 
the beans are sent to table. 

With bacon and beans^ serve up whole potatoa 
boiled and peeled— and in the country, where cream 
h plenty, they boil some with butter, and pour it 
over the potatos, touching each one with pepper. 



^^i*^v^/»" 



BKOILED HAM OR BACON.— Wash and 
trim a nice piece of bacon ; soak it all night, or for 
several hours, in cold water. In the morning scald 
it with boiling water. Let it lie till cool, then 
throw away the water, and scald it again. Cut it 
into thin slices, very smooth and even ; the rind 
being previously pared off. Curl up the slices, roll- 
ing them round, and securing them with wooden 
skewers. Broil them on a gridiron, or bake them 
in a Dutch oven. If cut properly thin, they will 
cook in a quarter of an hour. They must not 
be allowed to burn or blacken. Before you 
send them to table, take out the skewers. Thej 
may be cooked in flat slices, without curling, but 
they must be cut always very thin. Sace some 
hard-boiled eggs, and lay them on the meat. 
Season with black pepper. 

Cold boiled ham cooked as above, will require 
no soaking, and can be speedily prepared for a 
breakfast dish. Lay sprigs of parsley on the ham. 

Serve up with them mashed potatos m/ide into 
balls, or thick flat cakes, and browned on th< flur» 
taoe with a red-liot shovel. 



^50 MISS Leslie's new cook bogi?. 

STEWED HAM.—Cut some thin slices of cold 
boiled ham. Season them slightly with pepper. 
No salt. Lay them in a stew pan with plenty of 
green peas or lima beans, or else cauliflowers, or 
young summer cabbage, quartered, and the thick 
stalk omitted. Add a piece of fresh butter, or a 
very little lard. Put in just water enough to keep 
the things from burning. When the vegetables 
are quite done, add a beaten egg or two, and in five 
minutes, take up the stew and send it to table. 



*****^^^*^^^* 



STEWED BACON.— Take a small piece of 
bacon, not too fat or salt. It had best be soaked 
in cold water the night before. Put it into a pot, 
with a large portion of string beans, each cut into 
three pieces, (not more,) or else some cabbage, or 
young cabbage sprouts. Early in the spring, the 
young stalks of the pokeberry plant will be found 
excellent with stewed bacon. Stew the bacon and 
vegetables in just water enough to cover them all; 
skimming frequently. Drain all, through a cul- 
lender, when done. Fave «. dish of boiled potatoa 
also. A mo .asses Indian pudding is a good con- 
clusion to this homely dinner. 

PREPARED LARD.— As soon as it is cut oil 
from the newly killed pork, put the fat into a crock, 
or deep earthen pot. Cover tbc crock with its C'Vd. 
ud, and let it stand all night in. a cool place. Ne^ . 
day, cut it int^ email bits, (carefully removing all 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK .tfOOK. 261 

the fleshy particles of lean) ; and then put tie fat 
into a very clean pot, ^^dthout either water or salt. 
The pot should not be more than half full of pork- 
fat. Let it boil slowly^ (stirring it frequently frora 
the bottom, lest it burn,) till it becomes quite cleai 
and transparent. Then ladle it into clean pans. 
When almost cold, put it into stoneware jars, 
which must be closely covered, and kept in a cool 
place. If it is to go to a distance, tie it up in new 
bladders. 

There are two sorts of pork-fat for lard. The 
leaf- fat, which is best ; and the fat that adheres to 
the entrails. These two fats should be boiled 
separately. 

The large entrails, whose skins are to be used 
for sausages, must be cleaned out carefully, well 
scraped, and thrown into strong salt and water 
for two days, (changing the brine the second day,) 
and afterwards into strong lye for twenty-four 
hours. Lastly, wash them in fresh water. We 
think it much better to dispense with the skina 
altogether ; keeping your sausage meat in jars, and 
frying it in cakes when wanted for use. Its own 
fat (as it exudes) will cook it. 

Never use bad butter when you can obtain good 
lard; for frying, and other purposee.

VENISOIJ. 

Yo-i may judge of the age of venison by locking 
at the hoof, which is always left on the Leg. The 
dc«r is young if the cleft of the hoof is small and 
smooth ; but large and rough, if he is old. Busk 
venison is considered better than the meat of the 
doe. The haunch, or hind-quarter, is the best part, 
and the fat upon it should be thick and white. 
The shoulder, or fore-quarter, is the next best piece. 
The saddle comprises both hind-quarters; and 
these, for a large company, are always cooked 
together. 

To eat venison in perfection, it should be killed 
when the deer can find plenty of fresh food in the 
forest, and when they have fattened on the abund 
ance of wild berries, which they can obtain during 
the autumn. In winter, they are brought into the 
cities, lean, hard, dry, and black, and the meat 
infested all through with small threadlike white 
worms; showing that decomposition has com- 
menced, and requiring the disguise of spices, wine, 
currant jelly, &c., to render it eatable^ not wholesome^ 
for every sort of food in the slightest degree tainted 
13 utterly injurious to health, and cannot often be 
eaten with impunity. 

It never Avas very fashionable, in America, to eal 
spoiled victuals, and it is now bss so than ever. 
Fortunately, in our land of abundance, "we do no^ 
sec the necessity '* 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 253 

HAUNCH OF VENISON.— To prepare a 
nauncL. of venison for roasting (we will suppose it 
to be perfectly good and well kept,) wipe it tho- 
roughly all over with cloan cloths, dipped in luke- 
warm water, and then go over it with clean dry 
clollis. Trim off all unsightly parts. Lay over 
the fat a large sheet of thick brown paper, well 
buttered, and securely tied on with twine. Or else 
make a coarse paste of brown meal, and cover it 
with that. Place it before a good steady fire, and 
let it roast from three to four hours, according to 
its size. After roasting well for three hours, re- 
move the covering of paper or paste, and baste the 
meat well all over ; first with dripping or butter, 
and then with its own gravy, dredging it very 
slightly with browned flour. Skim the fat off the 
gravy, and send the venison to table plain, with 
Bweet sauce of black currant jelly, or raspberry 
jam, in a gla*3 dish with a spoon in it. 



VENISON STEAKS, BEOILED.— Cut th« 
steaks not quite an inch tliick. Trim them nicely, 
and season them with a little black pepper and salt. 
Have ready, over a bed of clear bright hot coab 
from a wood fire, a gridiron with grooved bars to 
cat< h the gravy. 1 ut co'^'n the steaks, and when 
one side is quite done turn the other, and broil that 
Venison should always be very thoroughly aonu

a small saucepan. Give it a boil over the lire, and 
Bkim off all the fat from the surface. Stir into it 
some nice wine, and serve up with the steaks a 
deep dish of cranberry, or peach sauce, or a large 
cup of grape jell J. 



/■.A^^«$>->/v*v/vv»^<^ 



STEWED YENISON STEAKS.— Take some 
fine steaks o? freshly killed venison. Cut them from 
the upper part of the leg. Make a forcemeat, or 
stuffing, with bread soaked in milk, mixed with 
fresh butter, with chopped sweet maijoram and 
sweet basil ; or some boiled onions, minced small, 
and mixed with chopped sage, which may be boiled 
with the onion, and seasoned with a very little salt 
and pepper. Spread the stuf&ng thickly over the 
inside of the steaks. Then roll them up, and tie 
them round with packthread, or secure them at the 
ends with wooden skewers. Put the steaks into a 
stewpan with some fresh butter or lard, or some 
drippings that have been left of roast venison — the 
day before. Let them stew (keeping the pan 
covered) till thoroughly done. Then dish them 
with the grav}^ round them. Serve up with them 
a sauce of stewed cranberries, or stewed dried 
peaches. 

You may stew lamb or mutton cutlets in the 
Eamo manner, but do not use mutton drippmg. 
Water (a very small quantity) is best for t'nem, 
Veal cutlets may be stewed exactly like venison. 



MISS LESLIE^S NEW COOK BOOK. 255 

HASHED YENISOISr.— Take the remains of 
cold roast venison, from which sufficient gravy oi 
dripping has been saved to cook the meat again, 
without any water at all. It would be well if this 
were done in all hashes made from cold meat. For 
want of drippings, use butter or lard. Cold meal 
stewed in water is weak and unpalatable. 

Two or three large spoonfuls of mushroom, or 
tomato catchup, are improvements to all hashes. 
If nothing better can be obtained use onions, always 
previously boiled to render them less strong. 

Minced sweet herbs are excellent seasoning for 
hashes. Also minced tarragon leaves; they give 
a peculiar flavor that is very generally likeJ. 
Fresh tarragon is in season in July, August, and 
September. 

French mustard (to be obtained at all t}ic best 
grocery stores) is a great improvement to haslies 
and stews. Stir in at the last, one or two large 
table-spoonfuls. The chief ingredient of Frenob 
mustard is tarragon.

A FINE VENISON PIE.—Cut steaks from a 
loin or haunch of venison, which should be as 
freshly killed as you can get it. The strange and 
absurd prejudice in favor of hard black-look ii^g 
venison, (that nas been kept till the juices are all 
dried up,) is fast subsiding; and no one now eats 
any sort of food in which decomposition has com- 
menced. Those who have eaten venison fresh 
from the forest. wh<^n the deer have fattened on 



256 MISS Leslie's NEW cook book. 

wild grapes, huckleberries, blackberries, cranber- 
ries, &c., will never again be able to relish such 
as is brought in wagon loads to the Atlantic ci- 
ties, and which has been kept till full of those 
fine threads that are in reality long thin wnitish 
worms, and which are often seen in very old hams. 

Having removed the bones and cut the meat 
into steaks, and seasoned it with salt and pepper, 
put the venison into a pot, with merely as much 
water as will cover it well. Let it stew till per- 
fectly tender, skimming it occasionally. Then 
take it out, and set it to cool, saving the gravy in 
a bowl. Make a nice puff paste; divide the 
paste into two equal portions, and roll it out 
rather thick. Butter a deep dish, and line it with 
one of the slieets of paste, rolled thin at the bot- 
tom. Then put in the stewed venison. Season 
the gravy with a glass of very good wine, (either 
port or sherry,) a few blades of mace, and a pow- 
dered nutmeg. Stir into it the crumbicd yolks 
of some hard-boiled eggs. Pour the gravy over 
the meat, and put on the other sheet of paste, as 
the lid of the pie. Bring the two edges close to- 
gether, so as to unite evenly, and notch them hand- 
somely. Set it immediately into the oven, and 
bake it well. If a steady heat is kept up, it will 
be done in an hour. Send it to table hot. 

Instead of wine, you may put into the gravy 
half a pint of black currant jelly, whi<*h, for vcni* 
aon, is thought preferable to red. Either will do. 

Any sort of gumc, partridges, pheasants, grouse, 



MISS Leslie's NEW COOK BOOK. 257 

wild ducks, &c,, may be made into a fine pie, 
exactly as above. 



*^>/^^***««>' 



YERY PLAIN VENISON PIE.— Cut from 
the bone some good pieces of fine fresh venison, 
season them slightly with salt and pepper, ana 
put them into a pot with plenty of potatos, (either 
sweet or white,) split and quartered, and only as 
much water as will cover the whole. Set it over 
the fire, cover it, and let it stew slowly and stea- 
dily, till all is tender, skimming it several times. 
Meanwhile, make a nice paste of flour shortened 
with cold gravy, or drippings saved from roast 
venison, or of nice lard. Allow half a pint of 
shortening to each quart of flour. Put the flour 
into a pan, and rub the shortening into it as 
quickly as possible, adding a very Utile cold water, 
to make it into a lump of paste. Then roll it out 
into a sheet, and spread over it with a broad 
knife the remaining half of the shortening. Dredge 
lightly with flour, fold it up, and roll it out in 
two sheets. With one of them line your pie-dish, 
and put into it the stewed venison and potatos. 
Pour in the gravy of the stew. The filling of 
this pie should be piled high in the centre. Lay 
on, as a lid, the other sheet of paste, which should 
be rather the largest. Pare off smoothly the edges 
of the two crusts, and crimp them nicely. Set 
the pie in the oven, and bake it well. It may 
be eaten eitlier hot or cold, but is best hot. 

The above quantity of paste is only suliicient 



25S MISS LESLIE^S NEW CODE BOOK. 

for a very small pie. For one of moderate size 
allow two quarts of flour, and a pound of short 
ening. 

VENISON POT-PIE.— Remove the bone from 
some fine venison steaks, cut near an inch thick. 
Season them lightly with pepper and salt, and 
score them each in several places. Stew them in 
a very little water till tender. Have ready an 
ample portion of nice suet paste. If you cannot 
obtain beef suet use cold venison fat, minced fine 
and made into a paste with double its quantity in 
flour, and as little water as possible. Lay some 
stewed venison at the bottom of the pot, and line 
the sides with paste almost up to the top. Put in 
' the meat, adding among it boiled sweet potatos 
cut into pieces, or (if they are to be had in plenty,) 
chestnuts, boiled and peeled. Mushrooms will 
be a great improvement. Onion also, (if liked,) 
bciled and cut up. Intersperse the whole with 
square pieces of paste. Fill the pot almost to the 
top with t) e meat and other ingredients. Lay a 
thick paste over the whole, cut round to fit, but 
not too closely. Pour in a pint of warm water to 
increase the gravy. Make a cross slit in the 
middle of the upper crust. Cook the pie till all 
is well done. Serve it up with the brov/a cnst 
in pieces, and laid on the top. 

This pie, if well made, and with plenty of paste, 
will be thought excellent whenever fresh venison 
ifl to be bad.

YENISON HAM. — Take fine freshlj-killed 
venison. Mix together an ounce of saltpetre, a 
pound of coarse brown sugar, and a pound of salt. 
Let them be very thoroughly mixed and pounded. 
Rub this well into the meat, and continiie rubbing 
hard till it friths. Keep the meat in the pickle 
for two weeks, turning it every day. Then take 
it out, and roll it in saw-dust, (which, on no ac- 
count, must be the saw-dust of any species of pine.) 
Hang it for two weeks longer in the smoke of 
oak wood or of corn cobs. All hams, when being 
smoked, must be hung very high, and have the 
large end downwards. If hung too low, the heal 
softens or melts the fat. 

Venison hams, if well cured, require no boil 
jng. They are always eaten chipped or shaved ' 
like smoked beef, to which they are very supe- 
rior. It may be stewed in a skillet with fresh 
butter and beaten egg, and cut into thin shavings, 
or very thin small slices — or, instead of butter, 
with the drippings of cold roast venison. SeasoD 
with pepper only.

BABBITS. — Eabbits should be young and 
tender, but full-grown and fat. Two are required 
to make a dish. One rabbit, except for an inva- 
lid, is scarcely worth the trouble of cooking; and, 
being naturally insipid, it must have certain sea- 
soning to make it taste well. The hare, so much 
prized in England, owes its reputation entirely to 
their mode of dressing it, which is troublesome

jxpensive, and in our country would never be- 
come popular, unless the animal had in itself 
more to recommend it. With all that can bo 
done for a hare, it is, when cooked, black, dry, 
hard ; and if it has been kept long enough to Ac- 
quire what they call the " true game flavor," so 
much the worse. A fine fat well-fed tame rabbit 
is much better. In Virginia, the negroes fre- 
quently call a large rabbit " a hare" — or rather 
"a yar;" and though they know it to be young, 
they generally term it " that old yar." We opine 
that with thein "yars" are not admired. If a 
rabbit is really old his ears are tough, and his 
claws blunt and rough with coarse hairs growing 
between them. A young rabbit has short sharp 
* claws, and ears so tender that on trying you can 
easily tear them. Babbits should be cooked the 
day they are killed. Always cut off the head. 
A rabbit dished whole, with its head on, is, to 
most persons, a disgusting sight. The head of no 
small animal is worth eating, and always looka 
disagreeable when cooked. 

The livers of rabbits should be added to the 
gravy. 

ROASTED KABBITS.— Take a pair of fine 
well-fed young rabbits, and having drawn or 
emptied tliem, lay them, for about ten minutes, m 
a pan of warm water. Then dry them inside with 
a clean cloth, carefully wiping them out. Truss 
them short, and ncxtly, having removed the heads

that Las bau most of the salt soaked out. Make 
a plentiful stuffing or forcemeat of bread steeped 
in milk, some fresh "butter mixed with a very 
little flour ; or, instead of butter, some beef suet 
finely minced; some chopped sweet herbs; and 
some crumbled yolks of hard-boiled eggs. Sea- 
son with mace and nutmeg, and grated lemon rind 
Fill the rabbits well with this — or, you may stuff 
them entirely with boiled potatos, mashed with 
plenty of nice butter, or the drippings of roast 
veal or pork. Or (if liked) you may make the 
stuffing entirely of minced onion, (previously 
boiled,) and minced sage leaves, moistened with a 
very little lard or sweet oil, and seasoned with 
powdered mace, nutmeg, and pepper. Ilaving 
put in plenty of stuffing, sew up the bodies of the 
rabbits, flour them well, and put them on the spit 
and set them before a clear fire. Baste them with 
railk, or with fresh butter, tied up in thin muslin. 
They will be done in an hour or more. Thickca 
the gravy with flour, and pour it over them in 
the dish. Roasted rabbits make a good second 
dish at a small dinner. Take the livers of the 
rabbits, and chop them, to put into the gravy.

the stew. Season with pepper and mace. Have 
ready sufficient paste, (made with minced suet, and 
rather more than twice its quantity of flour.) 
There must be enough of paste to line the sides 
of the pot all round, nearly up to the top, and 
enough to make a thick lid, besides having plenty 
of extra pieces to lay among the other contents. 
Also have ready a few onions boiled and sliced. 
Cover the pie with the lid of paste, not fitting 
very closely. Make a cross slit in the top, and 
pour in a little water. When done, serve all up 
on one large dish. 

This pie will be much improved by stewing 
with the rabbits a fresh beef steak. Abeef stef^k 
Ui any pot-oie thickens and enriches the gravy.

PULLED RABBITS.— Boil, very tender, a 
fine pair of nice young rabbits. When cold, cut 
them in pieces as for carving, and peel off the 
skin. Then with a for): pull all the meat from 
the bones, first loosening it with a knife. Put it 
into a stew-pan with plenty of cream, or some 
bits of fresh butter, rolled in flour; some minc-ed 
sweet herbs, some grated fresh lemon rind, and 
some hard-boiled yolks of eggs crumbled. Season 
with cayenne and nutmeg. Cover it, and let it 
simmer till it comes to a boil. Then immediately 
take it off the fire, and transfer it to a deep dish. 
Serve it up hot. This is a side dish at dinner.

FRICASSEED RABBITS.— Cut up the rabbits 
SIS for carving, and go over every piece with lard 
or sweet oil. Lay them in a frying pan, and fry 
them in nice fresh butter. If you cannot ]>rocure 
this, use lard. Season them with a very little salt 
and cayenne, dredge them well with flour, and 
sprinkle them thickly with parsley, or sweet mar- 
joram. When they are fried brown, take them 
ap. Keep them warm in a heated dish with a 
cover. Skim the gravy that remains in the pan, 
and add to it some cream, or rich milk thickened 
wl.h flour, enriched with the beaten yolk of an 
egg; and flavored with nutmeg.

A COATED HARE, OR LARGE RABBIT 
The hare, or rabbit, should be large and fafe, 
Save the liver and heart to assist in the gravy, 
^"hich ought to be made of some pieces of the lean 
of good fresh beef, seasoned with pepper, salt, and 
nutmeg, stewed in a small sauce-pan, till all the 
essence is extracted, adding the chopped liver and 
heart, and a bit of fresh butter, rolled in flour. 
Cold fresh meat, or meat that has to be recooked, 
is unfit for gravy, and so it is for soup. Line the 
inside of the hare with small thin slices of fat ham, 
or bacon, and then fill the cavity with a stuffing made 
of grated bread-crumbs, the grated yellow rind 
and juice of a lemon, or orange, a piece of fresh 
butter, some minced sweet marjoram, an i the 
crumbled yolk of one or two hard-boiled eggs. 
Season the stuffing with a little pepper and salt, 
and some powdered nutmeg and mace. Fid the 
body of the hare with this mixture, and sew it up, 
> keep in the stufiing. Spit the hare, and roast 
♦i well, keeping it for a while at a moderate dus- 
»ance from the fire. To baste it, while roasting, 
inaKC a dressing of the beaten yolks of four cggSj 
four spoonfuls of flour, a pint of milk, and three 
table-spoonfuls of salad oil, all well-beaten together. 
Baste the hare with this till it is thickly co-ited all 
over with the batter, takiri<T care it does not 
burn. Send the gravy to table in a sauce-boat 
acconpauied by currant, or cranberry jelly. 

A very young fawn, or a kid, may be diest in a 
similar man/ier. Kids are not eaten after tarc«

delioato. Their flesh, after that time, gradually be- 
comes coarse and dark-colored. A very young 
kid, before it is weaned, is very delicious ; but no 
longer. In the oriental countries, young kids ai'e 
stuffed with chopped raisins and almonds, or pis- 
tachio nuts, previous to roasting; and basted with 
rich milk, or cream. 

For sauce to a kid or fawn, use orange raarma

POULTRY AND GAME. 

Spring chickens bring a high price, and are con 
sidered delicacies, but they are so insipid, ana have 
so little on them, that we think the purchase of 
them, when very ^~ >ung, a mere fashionable ex- 
travagance, and fi waste of money that might be 
better employed in som<^thing that had really a 
fine flavor, t*nd that whc-Ti divided was more 
than a morsel for each peisc-n. We wonder that 
any but invalids should car*> for spring chickens. 
It is better to wait till the young chickens grow 
into nice plump fowls, tliat were well fed, and 
have lived long enough to show it. A fine full- 
grown young fowl, has a clear white skin, that 
tears easily when tried with a pin. It has a broad 
fleshy breast, the legs are smooth, and the toca 
easily broken when bent back. Fowls with whitish 
legs are considered the best for bciling; those with 
^jttrk legs the best for roasting. The jfiiiest of all

fowls are capons. Thej grow very large and fat, 
and yet are as tender as yoting chickens, have a 
fine delicate rieh flavor of their own, and are well 
worth their cost. The great Bucks county fowls 
are profitable because they are large ; but they are 
never very plenty in market, being difficult to 
raise. The best poultry feels heavy in proportion 
to its size. Hen turkeys are best for boiling. 

Ducks and geese (particularly the latter) are so 
tough when old, that it is often impossible to eat 
them; therefore buy none that are not young. 
Geese are generally kept alive too long, for the 
sake of their feathers, which they always shed in 
August, and for which there is always a demand. 
And geese are not expensive to keep, as in summer 
they feed on grass, and will graze in a field like 
sheep. The feet and legs of an old goose are red 
and hard. So is her bill. The s^'in is rough, 
coarse, and tough, and full of hairs. Let nothing 
induce you to buy an old goose. You would find 
it too tough to carve, and too tcrga t-o cat. And 
no cooking can make her tender. 

Poultry should be drawn, or emptied (taking 
care not to break the gall) as soon almost as killed. 
Then let it be wt^l vvasliod, inside and out, and 
wiped dry. In picking it, carefully remove every 
plug or vestige of feathers, and singe ofi'the hairs, 
Sj holding the bird to tlio fr\, with a lighted 
piece of writing paper. Brown paper will give it 
something of an unpleasant taste. Newspaper is 
worse, on account of the printing-ink. 

1£ poultry is brought from market frozen, you

need not hasten to thaw it, before it is actually 
wanted for use. Till then, put it in a cold place, 
and let it remain frozen. It will keep the better. 
When you thaw it, by all means use only cold 
water. Any frozen poultry, or meat, thawed in 
warm water, will most certainly spoil. Let it be 
remembered that any food which has been frozen 
requires a much longer time to cook.

BOILED TURKEY.— For boiling, choose a 
fine fat hen turkey. In drawing it, be carefdl not 
to break the gall, or a bitter taste will be commu- 
nicated to the whole bird. In picking, remove 
every plug and hair, and then singe it with writing- 
'paper. Wash it very clean, and then wipe it dry, 
inside and out. In trussing, draw the legs into the 
body, having cut them off at the first joint. Let the 
turkey look as round and plump as possible. Fill 
the breast with a very nice forcemeat, or stuffing, 
made of a quarter of a pound of grated bread- 
crumbs, mixed with two large table-spoonfuls or 
two ounces of fresh butter, or finely minced suet, 
seasoned with a little pepper and salt, a heaped tea- 
spoonful of powdered nutmeg and mace mixed 
together, a table spoonful of sweet herbs* (sweet 
basil and sweet marjoram) chopped small if green, 
and powdered if dry ; and the crumbled yolks of 
two hard-boiled eggs. Add the grated yellow rind, 

* The herbs summer savorj and thyme (like the spices el>Tei and 
ftUvpioe) an nov seldom used in good cookery. 



268 MISS lbslie's new gook bootc, 

and tlie juice of a fresh lemon, and mix tlie wlioie 
very well. Skewer the liver and gizzard under 
the pinions, having first cut open the gizzard and 
cleared it of sand or gravel. 

It is no longer customary to mix stuffing o^^ 
forcemeat with beaten raw egg for the purpose ol 
binding the ingredients together. Leave them 
loose, without this binding, and the forcemeat will 
be much lighter, better flavored, and more abund- 
ant. It will not fall out if a packthread, or very 
small twine is wound carefully round the body, (to 
be removed before serving up,) and it may be 
secured by sewing it with a needle and thread. 

Put the turkey into a large pot with plenty of 
cold water, and bcil it gently, for two hours or 
more, in proportion to itr? sizej carefully removing 
all the scum as it rises. It will be whiter if boiled 
in a large clean cloth, or in a coarse paste^ (the 
paste to be thrown away afterwards,) and take care 
that it is thoroughly done. Serve up boiled tur* 
key with oyster sauce, celery sauce, or cauliflower 
sauce. Sweet sauce is rarely eaten with boiled 
things — unless with puddings. 

Boiled turkey should be accompanied by a ham 
or tongue. 

To ascertain if boiled poultry is done, try the 
thickest parts with a large needle. H the needle 
goes through, and in and out easily, it is sufficient

with fried sausage cakes, about tlic size of a dollar, 
but near an inch thick. 

It is very convenient to keep always in the 
house, during the winter months, one or two large 
jars of nice home-made sausa^;, >-meat, well covered. 
The best time for making sausage-meat is in No- 
vember. After March, sausag-s arc seldom eaten. 



,. OYSTER TURKEY.— (Frcric/i rf^/^.)— Prepare 
a fine young hen turkey, for boiling; skewering 
the liver and gizzard under the pinions. Fill the 
body well with fine large fresh oysters, having re- 
moved their hard part or gristle. Add to the 
oysters a tea-spoonful of powdefed nutmeg and 
mace, and a tea-spoonful of celery seed or minced 
celery, and a piece of fresh butter dredged with 
flour. With this, stuff the turkey very full ; se 
curing the stuffing with packthread. Put the tur- 
key into a large block-tin kettle, and let it stew in 
the oyster liquor only, without any water. Strain 
ihe oyster liquor before you put it in. Set the 
kettle into an outer kettls fiiU of boiling water. 
This will cook the turkey very nicely. For such pur- 
poses, nothing is so convenient as the utensil called 
in French a havt marie^ (pronounced hine maree.) 
This is a permanent double keltic with two covers, 
and a large tube or spout outside, for pouring in 
fresh hot water, without opening the lid and letting 
out the steam. They are to be had of all sizes at 
the furiiL-hins; stores in New York and Philadel- 



270 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

pliia, and" are so excellent for stewing withoui 
water, that no family should be without them. 

When the turkey is well boiled and quite done, 
keep it warm by wrapping it closely in a cloth, 
putting a dish cover over it, and placing it near 
the fire. A fine oyster gravy will be found in tho 
kettle. Add to it soiie fresh butter, dredged with 
flour^ and some mace and nutmeg, and some celery 
seed. Give it one boil up, and send it to table as 
sauce for the turkey. This is a very nice way of, 
cooking a small turkey. 

A pair of oyster chickens may be thus prepared, 
and stewed in the above manner in a hain marie^ or 
double kettle. 



ROAST TURKEY.— Take a fine large turkey, 
full-grown and fat, draw and singe him carefully, 
saving the giblets (neck, heart, gizzard, and liver.) 
for the gravy. After he is drawn, wash the inside 
well, wipe it dry, and sprinkle it with black pepper. 
Make a large quantity of stuffing or forcemeat. 
It increases his apparent size, and besides is gener- 
ally liked. Mince small some cold boiled ham, in 
equal portions of fat and lean : grated lemon rind, 
minced sweet herbs, fresh butter, or finely minced 
suet. Add plenty of grated bread-crumbs or 
crumbled rusk; also, hard-boiled yolk of egg 
crumbled. Moisten the mixture with lemon juice 
and some good white wine. Stuff the turkey well 
with this forcemeat, sewing it up, or wmding a 
small cord round the body to secure the filling 



MISS LESLIfi'S NEW COOK BOOK. 271 

Roast it before a clear and substantial fire basting 
it well with fresh butter. When done, take it up 
and keep it hot. 

Cut up the giblets and put them into a small 
sauce-pan, with a very little water, and i tew them 
while the turkey is roasting; adding a piece of 
fresh butter dredged with flour. When done, re- 
move the pieces of neck, &c., retaining those of the 
heart, liver, and gizzard. Stir into the grav\, after 
it comes from the fire, the yolk of a beaten egg. 
Having skimmed the gravy in the dripping pan, 
add it to the gravy that has been made of the gib- 
lets, and send it to table in a sauce-boat. Accom 
pany the turkey with an oval dish, or tureen of 
cranberry sauce, made very sweet. 

A roast turkey may be stuffed with oysters, or 
with chestnuts boiled, peeled, and mashed with 
butter. If with chestnuts, thicken the gravy with 
whole boiled chestnuts. If with oysters, send oyster- 
sauce to table with the turkey. If chestnuts can- 
not be obtained, any roasted poultry is good stuffed 
with well-boiled sweet potatos, mashed with plenty 
of butter or meat drippings. 

The legs of turkeys are never helped to any one 
at table. They are always sent away on the dish.

A BONED TUEKEY.— For this purpose you 
DLust liave a fine, large, tender turkey; and after 
it is drawn, and washed, and wiped dry, lay it on 
a clean table, and take a very sharp knife, with a 
aarrow blade and poi it Begiu at the reck; then

go round to the shoulders and wings, and carefully 
separate the flesh from the bone, scraping it down 
as you proceed. Next loosen the flesh from the 
breast, and back, and body; and then from the 
thighs. It requires care and patience to do it 
nicely, and to avoid tearing or breaking the skin. 
The knife should always penetrate quite to the 
bone ; scraping loose the flesh rather than cutting 
it. When all the flesh has been completely 
loosened, take the turkey by the neck, give it a 
pull, and the whole skeleton will come out entirely 
from the flesh, as easily as you draw your hand out 
of a glove. The flesh will then fall down, a flat 
and shapeless mass. With a small needle and 
thread, carefully sew up any holes that have acci» 
dentally been torn in the skin. 

Ilave ready a large quantity of stuffing, made 
as follow*' : — Take three sixpenny loaves of stale 
bread ; grate the crumb ; and put the crust in 
water to soak. When quite ^oft, break them up 
•small into the pan of grated bread-crumbs, and mix 
ui a pound of fresh butter, cut into little pieces. Take 
i,wo large bunches of sweet marjoram; the same of 
fjweet basil; and one bunch of parsley. Mince the 
parsley very fine, and rub to a powder the leaves 
of the marjoram and basil. You should have two 
.'arge heaping table-spoonfuls of each. Chop, also, 
two very small onions or shalots, and mix them 
with the herbs. Pound to powder a quarter of an 
ounce of mace; and two large nutmegs. Mix. the 
•?pices together, and add a tea-spoonful of salt, and 
» tea-^oonftil of ground black pepper. Then uux 



Miss l;6slie'3 new cook book. 2t3 

che herbs, spices, &c., thoroiiglily into the bread- 
crumbs, and add, by degrees, four liard boile<l 
eggs crumbled fine. 

Take up a handful of this filling; squeeze il 
hard, and proced to stuff the turkey with it — begin- 
ning at the wings ; next do the body ; and then the 
thighs. Stuff it very hard ; and, as you proceed, 
form the turkey into its natural shape, by filling 
out, properly, the wings, breast, body, &c. When 
all the stufiing is in, sew up the body and skewer 
the turkey into the usual shape in which they are 
trussed; so that, if skillfully done, it will look al- 
most as if it had not been boned. Tie it round 
with tape, and bake it three hours or more; bast- 
ing it occasionally with fresh butter. Make a 
gravy of the giblets, chopped, and stewed slowly 
in a little water. When done, add to it the gravy 
that is in the dish about the turkey, (having first 
skirnmed off the fat,) and enrich it with a glass of 
white wine, and two beaten yolks of eggs, stirred 
in just before you take it from the fire. 

If the turkey is to be eaten cold at the supper- 
table, drop table-spoonfuls of currant or cranberry 
jelly all over it at small distances, and in the dish 
round it. 

A very handsome way of serving it up cold is 
after making a sufficiency of nice clear calves'-fo: 
jelly, (vseasoned, as usual, with wine, lemon, cinna- 
mon, &c.,) to lay the turkey in th« dish in which it 
is to go to table, and setting it under the jelly -bag, 
let the jelly "drip upon it, sO as to form a trans- 
par^t coating all over it; srnoothing the jelly

evenly with the back of a spoon, as it congeals on 
the turkey. Apple jelly may be substituted. 

Large fowls may be boned and stuffed in the 
above manner : also, a young roasting pig. 



ROAST GOOSE.— A goose for roasting should 
be young, tender, and fat ; so tender, that the skin 
can easily be torn by a pin; the bill and legs 
smooth and of a light yellow color, and the toes 
breaking when bent under. If the skin is thick 
and tough, and the bill and legs a dark reddish 
yellow, rough and hairy, do not buy the goose. 
It is old, and no cooking can make it eatable. A 
goose, from its profusion of feathers, looks like a 
large bird when walking about ; but when plucked 
and prepared for the spit, it will be found very de- 
ceptive. It is much more hollow than a turkey ; 
and, except the breast, there is but little eating on 
it. In large families it is usual to have a pair of 
roast geese, one not being suf&cient. Geese are 
not good except for roasting, or in a pie. 

In preparing a goose for cooking, save the gib- 
lets for the gravy. After the goose has been 
drawn, singed well, washed and wiped, inside and 
out ; trussed so as to look round and short; make a 
quantity of stuffing, (as its hollow body will re- 
quire a great deal.) For this purpose, parboil twc 
good sized onions, and a large bunch of green sago. 
Mince both the sage and onions, seasoning them 
with a small salt-spoon of salt, half as much black 
pqpper, and still less cayenne. Add a hard-boiled 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 275 

egg finely minced (yolk and white ;) tlie clioppeil 
egg giving a nice smootliness to the sage and onion. 
If your goose is large, take two chopped egsfs. 

I'o make the stuffing very mild, ^if preferred so,) 
add a handful of finely grated bread-crumos: or two 
or three fine juicy chopped apples. Fill the b<.Kiy and 
craw with this stuffing, and secure it with a needle 
and thread from falling out. Set the goose before 
a clear, steady fire— Laving a little warm water in 
the dripping-pan to baste it till the gravy begins 
to fall. Keep it well basted all the time it is roast- 
ing. It must be thoroughly done all through. 
Roast it according to its size, from an hour and s 
half to two hours or more. 

Boil the giblets in a sauce-pan by themselves, 
seasoned with a little salt and pepper, and having 
among them a bit of butter dredged with flour. 
When done, remove the neck, and retain the heart, 
liver, and gizzard, cut into pieces, and served in 
the gravy, which should be ^vell skimmed. Also, 
skim carefully the fat off the gravy in the bottom 
of the dripping-pan. Put the two gravies together, 
and serve them up in a gravy tureen. To eat with 
the goose, have plenty of apple-sauce, m^ade of fine 
juicy a]»ples, stewed very dry, well sweetened, and 
flavored with the grated yellow rind and juice of 
a lemon; or with some rose-water and nutmeg 
stirred in after the sauce is taken from the fire. 
Rose-water evaporates in cooking, and should never 
boil or be kept on the fire. A hain marie^ or double 
kettle, is excellent for stev.dng fruit; putting th« 
frjiit inside, and the water outside.

GOOSE PIE. — The old fashioned goose pie 
made wiili a standing crust, (the flour being mixed 
will I boiling water, and therefore unfit for eating,) 
is now obsolete. They were generally sent as 
Christinas presents. Besides the goose, they con- 
tained cliickens, pigeons, (all boned,) and various 
oilier things. They had standing sides like an 
cval wall, covered with a lid of the same paste, 
having, on the top, a knob, by which to lift off. 
These pies were expected to remain good a week; 
but generally the gravy became sour in a few days, 
even in winter, and however carefully kept from 
the air. The following is a receipt to make a fine 
goose pie for immediate use, and with a nice eatable 
paste. 

Take a fine plump young goose, and parboil it, 
(in as little water as will cover it,) saving the 
gravy IIa\dng removed the skin, cut all the 
flesh from the bones. Make a nice light short 
paste, allowing a large halt* pound of fresh butter 
to each quart of flour. Lor a goose pie you wil. 
require two quarts of flour and one pound of 
butter. Line a deep pie-dish with one sheet of 
paste, reserving the other sheet for the lid, which 
should be rolled out thick. Put in the pieces of 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 277 

goose, seasoned with pepper only, interspersing 
among it the best part of a smoked tongue, cut in 
thick rr und slices. Make a nice forcemeat into 
balls, about the size of a hickory nut, and ad<l them 
to the filling of the pie ; and some chestnuts boiled 
and peeled; or some round slices of boiled sweet 
potato. Having made a gravy of the giblets stewed, 
pour that Over the other ingredients, filling the pio 
well, and heaping it high in the middle. Add a 
few bits of fresh butter dredged in flour. Pour in 
the gravy, and lay on the top the lid of tlie pio 
rolled out thick, ornamenting the edges hand- 
somely. Cut a cross slit in the top, and fit into il 
a flower, or tulip cut out of paste. This pie is fc r 
dinner company, and to be eaten warm. 

You may make a similar pie of a pair of finu 
ducks, either tame or wild. Canvas-backs and rei"^ 
necks are excellent for this purpose. To eat with it 
have mashed potato, browned all over with a sala 
mander. 

On the shores of our southern rivers, where 
canvas-backs and other fine wild ducks are abund- 
ant, a pie aflbrds an agreeable variety to the usual 
modes of cooking them.

them stew till the giblets are tender. Then take 
them out, and save all the gravy; having strained

pie with the other sheet of paste, and notch the 
edges. Bake it brown, and send it to table hot. 

A pigeon pie may be made in a similar manner: 
also, a rabbit pie.

ROAST DUCKS. — Take a pair of fine fat 
ducks, and having prepared them nicely for the 
spit, put them, for a few minutes, into boiHng 
water to loosen the skin, which must be peeled 
entirely off, to have them very nice and tender. 
Wash their insides by pouring water through 
them, (tnd wipe the outside all over with a dry 
cloth. Fill the body and craw of one duck with 
a seasoning of sage and onion, as for a goose. In 
case some of the company should have a dislike 
to onion, fill the other duck with a forcemeat of 
bread crumbs, sweet herbs, &c., as for turkey. 
Place them before a quick fire, but not so near as 
to scorch. Roast them well, basting them all the 
tinie. Skim the fat off, and pour over the duck*

WILD DUCKS.— To remove the fishy or 
sedgy taste so often found in wild ducks, parboil 
them with a large carrot, cut in pieces, and placed 
in the body of each. When the ducks are half 
boiled, take out the carrot and throw it away. It 
will have imbibed all the unpleasant taste, and 
taken it away from the ducks. Then cook them 
as you please. 

BOILED DUCK.— Prepare for cooking a fine 
plump tame duck, and lay it five or six minutes in 
warm water. Then put it into a clean large bowl 
or deep dish, and pour over it a pint of rich boil- 
ing milk, in which has been melted two table- 
spoonfuls of nice fresh butter. Let the duck soak 
in the milk three hours, or till it has absorbed 
nearly all the liquid. Next, dredge the duck well 
with flour. Boil it in cold water for half an houi 
till tender all through. Have ready a quantity 
of onion sauce made with milk and butter, and 
fla\ored witu powdered mace or nutmeg. Cover 
the duck all over with the onion sauce, so as to

stuffing, as for a turkey. Bake the ducks in an 
iron oven or bake-pan, and when nearly done, put 
in with them a quart of very young green peas, 
and a few bits of fresh butter, seasoning slightly 
with black pepper. When the peas and ducks are 
all quite done, serve them all up on one large dish

FRICASSEED DUCKS.— Half roast a pair of 
ducks. Then cut them apart, as for carving. If 
they are wild ducks, parboil them with a large 
carrot (cut to pieces) inside of each, to draw out 
the fishy or sedgy taste. Having thrown away 
the carrot, cut the ducks into pieces, as for carv- 
ing. Put them into a clean stew-pan, and season 
them with pepper and salt. Mix in a deep dish a 
very small onion minced fine, a table-spoonful of 
minced or powdered tarragon leaves, (for which 
you may substitute sage and sweet marjoram, if 
you cannot procure tarragon,) and two or three 
large tomatos, scalded, peeled, and quartered, oi 
two largta eble-spoonfuls of thick tomato catchup. 
Put in, also, two table-spoonfuls of fresh butter 
rolled in grated bread-crumbs, and a glass of port 
wine, claret, or brandy, with a small tea-spoonful 
of powdered mace. Cover che pieces of duck 
with this mixture, and then add barely as much 
water as will keep the whole from burning. Cca mt

cho pan Closely, and let the fricassee stow slow! y 
for an hour, or till the duck, &c., are thoroughly 
done. 

Venison or lamb cutlets may be fricasseed in 
this manner. Likewise, tame fat pigeons, whioh 
must previously be split in two. This, also, is a 
very nice way of dressing hares or rabbits.

TO KOAST CANVAS-BACK DUCKS.— 

Having trussed the ducks, put into each a thick 
piece of soft bread that has been soaked in port 
wine. Place them before a quick fire and roast 
them from three quarters to an hour. Before they 
go to table, squeeze over each the juice of a lemou 
or orange, and serve them up very hot with their 
own gravy about them. Eat them with currant 
jelly. Have ready also, a gravy made by stewing 
slowly in a sauce-pan the giblets of the ducks in 
butter rolled in flour, and as little water as pos- 
sible. Serve up this additional gravy in a boat.

Truss the ducks without washing, but wipe 
them inside and out with a clean dry cloth 
Koast them before a rather quick fire for half an 
hour. Then send them to table hot, upon a large 
dish placed on a heater. There must also be heat- 
ers under each plate, and currant jelly on both 
aides of the table, to mix with the gravy, on your

plate ; claret or p )rt wine also, for those who 
prefer it as au improvement to the gravy. 



*i^*^^s^ ^■>^^\AA#*»»~- 



TO STEW CANY AS-BACK DUCKS.— Put 
the giblets into a sauce- pan with a very little 
water, and a piece of butter rolled in flour, and 
a very little salt and cayenne. Let them stew 
gently to make a gravy, keeping the sauce-pan 
covered. In the mean time, half roast the ducks, 
saving the gravy that falls from them. Then cut 
them up, put them into a large stew-pan, with the 
gravy (having first skimmed off the fat,) and merely 
water enough to keep them from burning. Set 
the pan over a moderate fire, and let them stew 
gently till done. Towards the last, (having re- 
moved the giblets) pour over the ducks the gravy 
from the small sauce-pan, and stir in a large glass 
of port wine, and a glass of currant jelly. Send 
them to table as hot as possible. 

Aay ducks may be stewed as above. The com- 
mon wild duck, teal, &c., should always be par- 
boiled with a large carrot in the body to extract 
the fishy or sedgy taste. On tasting this carrot 
before it is thrown away, it will be found to have 
imbibed strongly that disagreeable flavor.

BEOFlED CANVAS-BACK DUCKS.—To eat 
these ducks with their flavor and juices in per- 
fection, they should be cooked immediately after 
killing, ir shot early in the morning, they wiU 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 28;^i 

be found delicious, if broiled for breakfast. If 
killed in the forenoon, let tbem be on tbat day's 
dinner table. When they can be obtained ^uite 
fresh they want nothing to improve the flavor. 
Neither do red-necks, or the other water fowl that 
are found in such abundance on the shores of the 
Chesapeake. 

As soon as the ducks have been plucked, 
singed, drawn, and washed, split them down the 
back, (their heads, necks, and legs having been 
cut off,) rub with chalk the bars of a very clean 
gridiron, and set it over a bed of bright lively 
wood-coals. This gridiron (and all others) should 
have grooved bars, so as to save as much of the 
gravy as possible. Broil the ducks well and tho- 
roughly, turning them on both sides. They will 
generally be done in half an hour. Dish them 
in their own gravy. The flesh should have no 
redness about it when dished. To half broil them 
on the gridiron, and to finish the cooking on a 
hot plate, set over a heater on the table, renders the 
ducks tough, and deadens the natural taste, for 
which no made-up sauce can atone. You may 
]ay a few bits of nice butter on them after they 
are dished.

meat to the stew-pan, and lay it in its own gravy. 
Add the yolks of half a dozen hard-boiled eggs, 
and make them into little balls with beaten white 
of ogg, a quarter of a pound of fresh butter di- 
vided into eight bits, each bit dredged with flour, 
the grated yellow rind and juice of a lemon or 
orange, and a heaped tea-spoonful of powdered 
mace and nutmeg. Let it stew or simmer gently 
till it comes to a boil, keeping it covered. When 
it has boiled, stir in while hot two beaten yolks 
of raw egg, and two large wine glasses of sherry 
or Madeira. Set it over the fire again for two or 
three minutes, keeping it covered. Then serve it 
up in a deep dish with a cover. 

For company, you must have two ducks, and a 
double portion of all the above ingredients.

KOAST FOWLS.— Stuff two fowls with a nice 
forcemeat, made in the best manner, or with good 
sausage meat, if in haste. Another nice stuffing 
for roast fowls is boiled chestnuts, stewed in but- 
ter, or in nice drippings. Mushrooms cut up and 
stewed in a very little butter, make a fine stuff- 
ing for roasted fowls. Secure the stuffing from 
falling out by winding a twine or tape round the 
bodj- of the fowl, or sewing it. Koast the fowls 
before a very clear fire, basting them with butter. 
When the fowls are done, set iliem away to be 
kept v/arm, yhilc you finish the gravy, having 
dHved the heart; gizzard, and liver, to enrich it. 
Skim It well from the fat and thicken it with a

▼cry littio browned flour. Send .t to table in & 
sauce-boat. Serve up with roast fowls, driea 
peach sauce, or cranberry. Make all fruit sauces 
very thick and sweet. If watery and sour, they 
seem poor and mean. 

Full-grown fovls require, (at least,) an hour for 
roasting. If very large, fr( ri an hour and a quar- 
ter to an hour and a half. 

Nothing can be done wl l :ld tough fowls but 
to boil them in soup, till they are reduced to rags* 
The soup, of course, should be made chiefly of 
meat. The fowls will add nothing to its flavor 
but something to its consistence. 

Capons are cooked in the same manner as other 
fowls. They are well worth their cost. 



«^^/\/N^^-^^^/W/ 



BOILED FOWLS.— Take a fine plump pair 
of young (but full-grown) fowls, and prepare them 
for boiling. Those with white or light yellow 
legs are considered the best. Make a nice force- 
meat stuffing, and fill their bodies with it, and 
fasten the livers and gizzards under the pinions. 
For boiled poultry they are not wanted in the 
gravy. Having trussed the fowls, and picked and 
singed them carefully, put them into a large pot 
containing equal quantities of boiling water ind 
cold water. This will make it lukewarm. Let 
them boil steadily for an hour after the simmer* 
ing has commenced, carefully removing the scum. 

beris them up with egg sauce, celery sauco. 



286 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

parsley sauce, or oyster sauce — or, with cauli 
flower or broccoli sauce. 

For boiled fowls, you may make a nice stuffing 
of fresh oysters, cut in small pieces, but not 
minced. Omit the gristle. Mix them with an 
equal ^)ortion of hard-boiled eggs chopped, but 
not minced fine. Add plenty of grated bread- 
crumbs, and season with powdered mace. Mix 
in, ako, lome bits o+ eah butter. Where : nions 
are li-rod, you may substitute for the oysters some 
onions boiled and minced. 

Fowls boil very nicely in a hain marie., or double 
kettle, with the water outside. They require a 
longer time, but are excellent when done. To 
quicken the boiling of a double kettle, put a 
handful of salt in the outside water. 

Small chickens, of course, require a shorter time 
to cook. 

PULLED FOWL.— This is a side dish foi 
company. Select a fine tender fowl, young, fat, 
full-grown, and of a large kind. When quite 
done take it out of the pot, cover it, and set it 
away till wanted. Then, with a fork, pull off in 
flakes all the flesh, (first removing the skin,) and 
with a chopper break all the bones, and pat them 
into a stew-pan, adding two calves' feet split, and 
the hock of a cold ham, a small bunch of parsley 
and sweet marjoram, and a quart of water. Let it 
boil gently till reduced t> a pint. Then take 
it out. Have ready, in another stew-pan, the bits 
of pulled fowl. Strain the liquor from the bocea, 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 287 

&c., over the fowl, and add a piece of fresh butter, 
(the size of a small egg,) rolled in flour, and a tea 
spoonful of powdered mace and nutmeg, mixed. 
Mix the whole together, and let the pulled fowl 
stew in gravy for ten minutes. Serve it hot. 

A turkey may be cooked in this manner, and 
will make a fine dish. For a turkey allow four 
calves' feet. 

FEIED CHICKENS.— Cut up a pair of nice 
young fowls, flatten and quarter them, and season 
them with cayenne and powdered mace, rubbing 
it in well. Put some lard into a heated frying 
pan over the fire, or if you have plenty of nice 
fresh butter use that in preference. When the 
lard or butter boils, and has been skimmed, put 
in the pieces of chicken, and fry them brown on 
one side. Then turn them, and sprinkle them 
thickly all over with chopped parsley, or sweet 
marjoram, and fry them brown on the other side 
You may fry with them a few thin slices of cold 
ham. Before serving them up drain off the lard 
you have used for frying. 

When there is no dislike to onions, they may 
be fried nicely with boiled onions cut in rings, 
and laid over the pieces of chicken.

BEOILED CHICKENS.— These are very di- 
and tasteless if merely split and broiled plain, 
which is the usual way. It seems to be supposed 
by many that no chicken is too poor for broiling, 



288 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

and therefore it is often difficult to get more than 
two or three small mouthfuls of flesh off their 
bones. On the contrary, poor chickens are not 
worth broiling or cooking in any way. To have 
broiled chickens good, choose those that are fat 
and fleshy. Having cleaned them well, and 
washed them, and wiped them dry, split and divide 
them into four quarters ; flattening the bones with 
a steak mallet. They will be much improved by 
stewing or boiUng in a little water for ten minutes. 
Then draining them and saving the liquor for 
gravy. Boil in this the neck, feet, heart, gizzard 
and liver. Strain it after boiling, and save the 
liver to mash into the gravy. Season the gravy 
with grated carrot and minced parsley, or sweet 
marjoram, and a little cayenne, adding a small 
piece of fresh butter dredged in flour. Have 
ready plenty of fine bread-crumbs, seasoned with 
nutmeg, and in another pan four yolks of eggs 
well beaten. The quarters of the chickens having 
become quite cold, dip each one first into the egg, 
and then into the crumbs. Set the gridiron over 
a clear fire, and broil the chicken well, first laying 
down the inside. Having prepared the gravy as 
above, give it a short boil, then send it to table in 
a sauce-boat with the chickens. 

The excellence of chickens broiled in this way 
amply repays the trouble. This is a breakfast 
dish. 

Serve up with the broiled chicken a dish of 
mashed potato cakes, browned with a salamander 
or red-hot shovel.

FEICASSEED CHICKEN. — Have ready a 
pair of fine plump full-grown fowls nicely pre- 
pared for cooking. Strip off all the skin, and 
carve the fowls neatly. Keserve all the white 
meat and best pieces for the fricassee, putting 
them in a dish by themselves, and save all the 
inferior pieces or black meat to make the gravy. 
Season with pepper and salt slightly, and add a 
bunch of sweet herbs cut small, and four small 
bits of fresh butter dredged with flour. Put the 
black meat, herbs, &;c., into a stew-pan. Pour in 
a pint and a half of water, and stew it gently, 
skimming off every particle of fat. When re- 
duced to less than one half, strain the gravy. 
Arrange the pieces of white meat in a very clean 
stew-pan, and pour over them the gravy of the 
inferior parts ; add mace, nutmeg, and a little 
cayenne. Mix into half a pint of boiling cream 
a large tea-spoonful of arrow-root, and shake the 
pan briskly round, while adding the beaten yolks 
of two fresh eggs, mixed with more cream, (two 
table-spoonfuls.) Shake it gently over the fire 
till it begins to simmer again, but do not allow it 
to boil, or it will curdle in an instant. Watch it 
carefully. 

This is a fine side-dish for company. There ia 
no better way of fricasseeing fowls. A fricassee 
is not a fry, but a stew. 

Accompany this fricassee with a dish cf aspa- 
ragus tops, green peas, cr lima beans. Also, 
mashed potatoes.

CHICKENS STEWED WHOLE. — Having 
trussed a pair of fine fat young fowls or chickens, 
(with the liver under one wing, and the gizzard 
under the other,) fill the inside with l-arge oysters, 
secured from falling out by fastening tape round 
the bodies of the fowls. Put them into a tin 
butter kettle with a close cover. Set the kettle 
into a larger pot or saucepan of boiling water, 
(which must not reach quite to the top of the 
kettle,) and place it over the fire. Keep it boil- 
ing till the fowls are well done, which they should 
be in about an hour after they begin to simmer 
Occasionally take off the lid to remove the scum, 
and be sure to put it on again closely. As the 
water in the outside pot boils away, replenish it 
with more hot water from a tea-kettle that is kept 
boiling hard. When the fowls are stewed quite 
tender, remove them from the fire ; take from them 
all the gravy that is about them, and put it into a 
small sauce-pan, covering closely the kettle in 
which they were stewed, and leaving the fowls in 
it to keep warm. Then add to the gravy two 
table-spoonfuls of butter rolled in flour, two table- 
spoonfuls of chopped oysters, the yolks of three 
hard-boiled eggs minced fine, half a grated nut 
meg, four blades of mace, and a small tea-cup of 
cream. Boil this gravy about five minutes. Put 
the fowls on a dish and send them to table, ac- 
companied by the gravy in a sauce-boat. This ia 
an excellent way of cooking chickens. They do 
well in large hain marie. 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 291 

FOWL AND OYSTEES.— Take a fine fat 
young fov/1, and having trussed it for boiling, fill 
the body and craw with oysters, seasoned with a 
few blades of mace, tying it round with twine to 
keep them in. Put the fowl into a tall strait- 
sided jar, and cover it closely. Then place the 
jar in a kettle of water, set it over the fire, and 
let it boil at least an hour and a half after the 
water has come to a hard boil. When it is done 
take out the fowl, and keep it hot while you pre- 
pare the gravy, of which you will find a quantity 
in the jar. Transfer this gravy to a saucepan, 
enrich it with the beaten yolks of two eggs mixed 
with three table-spoonfuls of cream, and add a 
large table-spoonful of fresh butter rolled in 
flour. If you cannot get cream, you must have a 
double portion of butter. Set this sauce over the 
fire, stirring it well, and when it comes to a boil, 
add twenty -five oysters. In five minutes take it 
off, put it into a sauce-boat, and Serve it up with 
the fowl, which cooked in this manner will be 
found excellent. 

Clams may be substituted for oysters, but they 
should be removed from the fowl before it is sent 
to table. Their flavor being drawn out in the 
gravy, the clams themselves will be found tough, 
tasteless, and not proper to be eaten.

as mu(3h of the water in wMch the chickens were 
parboiled as will cover them well, and stew then* 
for gravy ; add a bunch of sweet herbs and a few 
blades of mace. When the chickens are cold, dis- 
sect them as for carving. Line a deep dish with 
thick puff paste, and put in the pieces of chicken. 
Take a nice thin slice of cold ham, or two slices of 
smoked tongue, and pound them one at a time in 
a marble mortar, pounding also the livers of the 
chickens, and the yolks of half a dozen hard-boiled 
eggs. Make this forcemeat into balls, and inter- 
sperse them among the pieces of chicken. Add 
some bits of fresh butter rolled in flour, and theu 
(having removed the giblets) pour on the gravy. 
Cover the pie with a lid of puff-paste, rolled out 
thick; and notch the edges handsomely; placing 
a knot or ornament of paste on the centre of the 
top. Set it directly into a well-heated oven, and 
bake it brown. It should be eaten warm. 

This pie will be greatly improved by a pint of 
mushrooms, cut into pieces. Also by a small tea- 
cup of cream. 

Any pie of poultry, pigeons, or game may be 
made in this manner.

CHICKEN GUMBO.— Cut up a young fowl as if 
for a fricassee. Put into a stew-pan a large table- 
spoonful of fresh butter, mixed with a tea-spoonful 
of flour, and an onion finely minced. Brown them 
over the fire, and then add a quart of water, and 
the pieces of chicken, with a large quarter of a

and a salt-spoon of salt. Cover tlie pan, and let 
ihe whole stew together, till the ochras are entirely 
dissolved, and the fowl thoronghly done. If it is 
a very young chicken, do not pnt it in at first ; as 
half an hour will be sufficient to cook it. Serve it 
up hot in a deep dish. 

You may add to the ochras an equal quantity 
of tomatos cut small. If you use tomatos, no 
water will be necessary, as their juice will supply 
a sufficient liquid.

* FILET GUMBO.— Cut up a pair o^ nne plump 
fowls into pieces, as when car'vdng. Lay them in 
a pan of cold water, till ?.ll the blood is drawn out. 
Put into a pot, two large table-spoonfuls of lard, and 
set it over xhe fire. When the lard has come to a 
boil, put in the chickens with an onion finely 
minced. Dredge them well with flour, and season 
slightly with salt and pepper ; and, if you like it, a 
little chopped marjoram. Pour on it two quarts 
of boiling water. Cover it, and let it simmer slowly 
for three hours. Then stir into it two heaped tea- 
spoonfiils of sassafras powder. Afterwards, let it 
stew five or six minutes longer, and then send it 
to table m a deep dish ; having a dish of beiiea 
rice to be eaten with it by those who like rice. 

This gumbo will be much improved by stewmg 
with it three or four thin slices of cold boiled ham, 
\r which case omit the salt in the seascaing. When

3ver cold ham is an ingredient in any disli, no 
Dther salt is required. 

A dozen fresh oysters and their liquor, added to 
the stew about half an hour before it is taken up, 
will also be an improvement. 

If you cannot conveniently obtain sassafras- 
Dowder, stir the gumbo frequently with a stick of 
sassafras root. 

This is a genuine southern receipt. Filet gumbo 
may be made of any sort of poultry, or of veal, 
lamb, venison, or kid.

TOMATO CHICKEN.— Take four small chick- 
ens or two large ones, and cut them up as for carv- 
ing. Put them into a stew-pan, with one or two 
large slices of cold boiled ham cut into little bits ; 
eight or ten large tomatos; an onion sliced; a 
bunch of pot-herbs, (cut up ;) a small green pepper, 
(the seeds and veins first extracted ;) half a dozen 
blades of mace ; a table-spoonful of lard or of fresh 
butter, rolled in flour ; or a handful of grated bread- 
crumbs. Add a tumbler or half a pint of water. 
Cover the sauce-pan closely with a cloth beneath 
the lid ; set it on hot coals, or over a moderate iire ; 
and let it stew slowly till the chickens are tho- 
roughly done, and the tomatos entirely dissolved. 
Turn it out into a deep dish. 

Rabbits may be stewed in this manner. Also, 
^■eal steaks, cut thin and small.

TUEKEY AND CHICKEN PATTIES.— 
Take the white part of some cold turkey or chicken 
and mince it very fine. Mince also some cold 
boiled ham or smoked tongne, and then mix the 
turkey and ham together. Add the yolks of some 
hard-boiled eggs, grated or minced; a very little 
cayenne; and some powdered mace and nutmeg. 
Moisten the whole with cream or fresh butter. 
Have ready some puff-paste shells, that have been 
baked empty in patty-pans. Place them on a large 
dish, and fill them with the mixture. 

Cold fillet of veal minced, and mixed with 
chopped ham, and grated yolk of egg, and seasoned 
fts above will make very good patties.

CHICKEN EICE PUDDING.— Parboil a fine 
fowl, and cut it up. Boil, till soft and dry, a pint 
of rice ; and while warm, mix with it a large table- 
spoonful of fresh butter. Beat four eggs very 
light ; and then mix them, gradually, with the rice. 
Spread a coating of the fresh butter, &c., over the 
bottom and sides of a deep dish. Place on it the 
pieces of the parboiled fowl, with a little of the liquid 
in which it was boiled — seasoned with powdered 
mace and nutmeg. Add some bits of fresh butter 
rolled in flour and a little cream. Cover the dish 
closely with the remainder of the rice ; set the pud- 
ding immediately into the oven and bake it brown.

EICE CEOQUl .TTES.— Boil half a po-dnd of 
rice till it becomes quite soft and dry. Then mix 
with it two table spoonfuls of rich (but not strong^) 
grated cheese, a small tea-spoonful of powdered 
mace, and sufficient fresh butter to moisten it. 
Mince very fine, six table-spoonfals of the white 
part of cold chicken or turkey, the soft parts of 
six large oysters, and a few sprigs of tarragon or 
parsley ; add a grated nutmeg, and thi yellow rind 
of a lemon. Mix the whole well, moistening it 
with cream or white wine. Take of the prepared 
rice, a portion about the size of an egg, fiatten it, 
and put into the centre a dessert-spoonful of the 
mixture ; close the rice round it as you would the 
paste round a dumpling-apple. Then form it into 
the shape of an egg. Brush it over with some 
beaten yolk of egg and then dredge it with pounded 
crackers. In this way make up the whole into 
oval balls. Have ready, in a sauce-pan over the 
fire, a pound of boiling lard. Into this throw the 
croquettes, two at a time, so as to brown them. 
Let them brown for a few minutes ; then take them 
out with a perforated skimmer. Drain them from 
the lard, and serve them up hot, garnished ■wi*"'h

CHICKEN POT-PIE.— Cut up and parboil a 
pair of large fowls, seasoning them with pepper, 
Bait, and nutmeg. You may add some small slices 
of cold ham ; in which case use no salt^ as the ham 
will make it salt enough. Or you may put in 
some pieces of the lean of fresh pork. You may 
prepare a suet-paste ; but for a chicken pot-pie it 
is best to make the paste of butter, which should 
be fresh, and of the best quality. Allow to each 
quart of flour, a small half-pound of butter. There 
should be enough for a great deal of paste. Line 
the sides of the pot, two-thirds up, with paste. Put 
in the chickens, with the liquor in which they were 
parboiled. You may add some sliced potato^. In- 
tersperse the pieces of chicken with layers of pai-^te 
in square slices. Then cover the whole with a lid 
of paste, not fitting very closely. Make a cros.^- 
slit in the top, and boil the pie about an hour or 
more. 

Instead of ham, you may add some clams to the 
chicken, omitting salt in the seasoning, as the 
clams will salt it quite enough. 



CHICKEN CUERY.— Having skinned a pair 
of fine chickens, cut them into six ]»ieces each, 
that is, two wings, two pieces of the brep.st, and 
two legs cut off at the joint. Put into a stew-pan 
two boiled onions ohopped, and four ounces or 
four table-spoonfuls of fresh butter. Shake the 
pan till the contents begin to simmer; then add

well in ; also, four table-spoonfuls of grated cocoa- 
nut. Mix all well in the stew-pan, and then put 
in the pieces of chicken. Cover the pan, and 
let all stew moderately for half an hour, stirring 
it round occasionally ; and, if getting too dry, 
add a little hot water. Also, towards the last, 
the grated yellow rind of a lemon and the juice. 
It should stew till the chicken is quite tender,

RICE PIE. — Pick clean a quart of rice, and 
wash it well through two or three waters. Tie it 
ill a cloth, put it into a pot of boiled milk, and 
boil it till perfectly soft. Then drain and press 
it till a° dry as possible, and mix with it two 
ounces of fresh butter. Take a small tin butter- 
kettle ; wet the inside, put in the rice, and stand 
it in a cocl place till quite cold. Then turn it 
carefully out of the kettle, (of which it will re- 
tain the form,) rub it over with the beaten yolk 
of an egg, and set it in an oven till lightly 
browned. Cut out from the top of the mass of 
rice an oval lid, about two inches from the edge-,

80 as to leave a flat rim or border all round. Then 
excavate the mould of rice, leaving a standing 
crust all round and at the bottom, about two 
inches thick. Have ready some hot stewed oys- 
ters or birds, or brown or white fricassee. Fill 
ap the pie with it, adding the gravy. Lay on the 
lid, and decorate it with sprigs of green curled 
parsley, stuck in all round the crack where the 
iid is put on. 

This pie may be filled with curried chicken.

COUNTRY CAPTAIN.— This is an East In- 
dia dish, and a very easy preparation of curry. 
The term " country captain," signifies a captain 
of the native troops, (or Sepoys,) in the pay of 
England ; their own country being India, they are 
there called generally the country troops. Pro- 
bably this dish was first introduced at English 
tables by a Sepoy officer. 

Having well boiled a fine full-grown fowl, cut 
it up as for carving. Have ready two large onions 
boiled and sliced. Season the pieces of chicken with 
curry powder or turmeric ; rubbed well into them, 
all over. Fry them with the onion, in plenty of lard 
or fresh butter, and when well-browned they are 
done enough. Take them up with a perforated 
skimmer, and drain through its holes. It will be 
a great improvement to put in, at the beginning, 
three or four table-spoonfuls of finely grated 3ocoa- 
nut. This will be found an advantage to any curry. 

Serve ap, in another dish, a pint of rice, wel- 



800 MISS le.slte's new cook book 

picked, and washed clean in two or three cold 
waters. Boil the rice in plenty of water, (leaving 
the skillet or sauce-pan uncovered ;) and when it is 
done, drain it very dry, and set it on a dish before 
the fire, tossing it up with two forks, one in each 
hand, so as to separate all the grains, leaving each 
one to stand for itself. All rice for the dinner 
table should be cooked in this manner. Persons 
accuctomed to rice never eat it watery or clammy, 
or Iving in a moist mass. Rice should never be 
covered, either while boiling, or when dished. 
We "^ecommend this "country captain" 



CURRIED EGGS. — Boil six fresh eggs till 
they are hard enough for salad, and then set them 
away to get cold. Mix together, in a stew-pan, 
three ounces (or three large table-spoonfuls) of 
nice fresh butter, and three dessert-spoonfuls of 
curry powder. Shake them together for five min- 
utes over a clear but moderate fire. Then throw 
m two boiled onions finely minced, and let them 
cook, gently, till quite soft, adding three ouncea 
or three large spoonfuls of grated cocoa-nut. Cut 
the eggs into rather thick slices. Put them into the 
mixture, with a small tea-cupful of thick cream, or 
if you cannot obtain cream, with two more spoon- 
fuls of butter dredged with flour. Let the whole 
simmer together, but when it approaches coming 
to a boil, take it immediately off the fire and 
serve it up hot. This is a nice side-dish for com 
pany

PARTKIDGES PEAR FASHION— (i^VencA 
dish.) — Your partridges should be fine and fat, 
and of the same size. For a large dish have three 
or four. Trup^s them tight and round, and rub over 
them a little salt and cayenne, mixed. Cut off 
one of the legs and leave the other on, fill them 
with a nice forcemeat. Make a rich paste of flour, 
butter, and beaten egg^ using as little water as 
possible. Be sure to make enough of paste to 
cover each partridge entirely over, and roll it out 
svenly, and rather thick than thin. Put a suffi- 
cient portion of paste nicely round each partridge, 
pressing it closely and smoothly with your hand, 
and forming it into the shape of a large pear. 
Leave one leg sticking out at the top to resemble 
the stem, having cut off the foot. Set them in a 
pan, and bake them in a dutch oven. In the mean 
time, make in a small sauce- pan, a rich brown 
gravy of the livers, and other trimmings of the 
partridges, and some drippings of roast veal or 
roasted poultry. It will be better still if you re- 
serve one or two small partridges to cut up, and 
stew for the gravy. Season it with a little salt and 
cayenne. When it has boiled long enough to be 
very thick and rich, take it off, strain it, and put 
the liquid into a clean sauce-pan. Add the juice 
of a large orange, made very sweet with powdered 
white sugar. Set it over the fire, and when it 
comes to a boil, stir in the beaten yolks of two 
egga. Let it boil two or three minutes longer 
then take it off, and keep it hot till the partridges 
wid their paste are thoroughly well baked. When

done, stand up the partridges in a deep dish, hnd 
serve up the gravy in a sauce-boat. Ornament 
the partridge-pears by sticking some orange leaves 
into the end that represents the stalk. This is a 
nice and handsome side dish, of French origin. 

Pigeons and quails may be dressed in this 
manner. 

SALMI OF FAnTmi)GES-^{Fre}ichdish.)-^ 
Having covered two large or four small partridges 
with very thin slices of fat cold ham, secured with 
twine, roast them ; but see that they are not too 
much done. Eemove the ham, skin the partridges, 
cut them into pieces, and let them get quite cold. 
Partridges that have been roasted the preceding 
day are good for this purpose. Gut off all the 
meat from the bones, season it with a little cay- 
enne, and put it into a stew-pan. Mix together 
three table- spoonfuls of sweet oil, a glass of excel- 
lent wine, (either red or white,) and the grated 
peel and juice of an orange. Pour this gravy 
over the partridges, and let them stew in it during 
ten minutes ; then add the beaten yolk of an egg, 
and stew it about three or four minutes longer. 
All the time it is stewing, continue to shake or 
move the pan over the fire. Serve it up hot.

ROASTED PABTRIDGES, PHEASANTS, 
AND QUAILS.—Make a stuffing of fat bacon

only. Fill the birds with this. Cover them with 
thin slices of bacon, and wrap them well in young 
vine leaves. Roast them well, and serve them up 
in the bacon and vine leaves, to be taken off when 
they come to table. For company, have orange 
sauce to eat with them. If you roast pigeons, &;c., 
without a covering of bacon and vine leaves, do 
them with egg and bread-crumbs all over. 

If these birds have a bitter taste when cooked, 
do not eat them. It is produced by their feeding 
on laurel berries in winter, when their food is 
scarce. Laural berries are poisonous, and people 
have died from eating birds that have fed on them. 



BIRDS WITH MUSHROOMS.— Take two 
dozen reed- birds, (or other nice small birds,) and 
truss them as if for roasting. Put into each a 
button mushroom, of which you should have a 
heaping pint after the stalks are all removed. Put 
the birds and the remaining mushrooms into a 
stew-pan. Season them with a very little salt and 
pepper, and add either a quarter of a pound of 
fresh butter (divided into four, and slightly rolled 
in flour,) or a pint of rich cream. If cream is not 
plenty, you may use half butter and half cream, 
well mixed together. Cover the stew-pan closely, 
and set it over a moderate fire, to stew gently till 
the birds and mushrooms are thoroughly done 
and tender all through. Do not open the lid to 
stir the stew, but give the pan, occasionally, a 
hard shake. Dip in hot water a large slice of 



304 MISS Leslie's new cook book 

uoast with the crust trimmed off. When the birda 
arci done lay them on the toast with the mushrooms 
around. 

If you cannot get button-*mushrooms, divide 
large ones into quarters. 

Plovers are very nice stewed with mushrooms.

BIRDS IN A GROYE— {French dish.)—R3Ly- 
mg roasted some reed-birds, larks, plovers, or any 
other small birds, such as are usually eaten, mash 
some potatos with butter and cream. Spread the 
mashed potato thickly over the bottom, sides, and 
edges of a deep dish. Nick or crimp the border 
of potatoe that goes round the edge, or scollop it 
with a tin cutter. You may, if you choose, brown 
it by holding over it a salamander, or a red-hot 
shovel. Then lay the roasted birds in the middle 
of the dish, and stick round them and among 
them, very thickly, a sufficient number of sprigs 
of curled or double parsley.

THATCHED HOUSE FIE— {French dish.)— 
Rub the inside of a deep dish with two ounces of 
fresh butter, and spread over it two ounces of 
vermicelli. Then line the dish with puff- paste.

uutraeg, and a very little salt and pepper. Place 
theiii with the breast downward. They will be 
much improved by putting into each a mushroom 
or an oyster chopper! fine. Lay them on the past© 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 305 

Add some gravy of roast veal, (eold gravy savea 
from veal roasted the precediag day will do very 
well,) and cover the pie with a lid of puff-paste 
Bake -it in a moderate oven, and when done, turn 
it out carefully upon a flat dish, and send it to 
table. The vermicelli, which was originally at 
the bottom, will now be at the top, covering the 
paste like thatch upon a roof. Trim off the 
edge, so as to look nicely. You may, if you 
choose, use a larger quantity of vermicelli. The 
yellow sort will be best for this purpose. 



BIRDS PREPARED FOR LARDING.— Cut 

a thin slice of fresh veal, and fill the bird with it, 
adding a bit of fat bacon. Tic a string round tLe 
body to keep in the stuffing, and roast the bird 
head downward. The gravy of the meat will dif- 
fuse a pleasant taste all through the bird. 

After being well roasted, let it get cold, and 
then lard it all over the breast with lardons or 
regular slips of fat bacon, put in with a laid- 
ing needle, and left standing in rows. It is more 
easy to lard poultry or game when cold, rather 
than warm. Lardons should be set very close and 
evenly. 

BIRD DUMPLINGS.— Take a large tender 
beef steak, trim off all the fat, and remove the 
bone. Make a large sheet of nice suet paste. 
Lay the beef steak upon it, seasoned with pepper 
ind a very little salt. In the centre of the meat

place either a paTtridge, a quail, a plover, or any 
nice game, or three or four reed-birds — season 
with powdered mace and nutmeg. Add some bita 
of excellent fresh butter, dredged with flour. In- 
olose the birds completely in the steak, so that 
Ihe game flavor may pervade the whole. Closo 
the crust over all, so as to form a large dumpling. 
Tie it in a cloth. Put it into a pot of fast- boiling 
water, and boil it well, turning it several times 
with a fork. Dish it very hot. 

If game is not convenient, a fine tame fat pigeon 
may be substituted.

TO EOAST WOODCOCKS OR SNIPES.— 
Be very careful in plucking these to puU out the 
feathers as carefully and handle them as lightly as 
possible ; for the skin is very easily torn or broken. 
Do not draw them, for epicures have decided, that 
the trail, (as they call the intestines,) is the most 
delicious part of the bird, and should by all means 
be saved for eating. Having wiped the outside 
carefully with a soft cloth, truss them with the 
head under the wing, and the bill laid along upon 
the breast. Keep the legs bent from the knees, 
retaining that posture by means • of a splinter 
skewer. Suspend the birds to a bird-spit, with 
their feet downward. Melt some fresh butter in 
the dripping-pan, and baste them with it, having 
first dredged the birds with flour. Before the trail 
begins to drop, (which it will do as soon as they 
»j*e well heated,) lay a thick round of very iiice 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 307 

toast, (with tbe crust pared off,) buttered on both 
sides, and placed in the dripping-pan beneath, so as 
to catch the trail as it falls ; allowing a slice of toast 
to each bird, with the trail spread equally over it. 
Continue the basting, letting the butter fall back 
from them into the basting spoon. When the birds 
are done, which will be in less than half an hour 
at a brisk fire — carefiilly transfer the toasts to a 
very hot dish; place the birds upon them, and pour 
some gravy round the toast. 

Snipes require less cooking than woodcocks. 
These birds are very fashionable; but we do not 
think either of them superlative. They seldom 
appear except at supper parties. 



s«*/VSX'^S^.^^\^^^.^V/>rf^ 



PLO VEKS. — This is a very nice bird, with a pe- 
culiar and pleasant flavor. They abound near our 
large bays and estuaries in the vicinity of the 
ocean. There are two sorts, the green plover and 
the gray. Koast them plain; basting them only 
with butter. Or fill them with a forcemeat, and 
go entirely over the outside, first with beaten egg^ 
and then roll each plover in finely grated bread- 
crumbs. 

If very fat, stew them plain in butter rolled in 
flour. Then serve them up in their own gravy, 
enriched with a beaten egg. They make a nice 
breakfast dish, either roasted or stewed. And 
<^re excellent in pies. 



308 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

EEED BIRDS. — Reed birds and rice birds are 
the same. They are very small, (only a moatliful 
on each side of the breast,) but very delicious, and 
imtnemely fat in the summer and autumn. They 
are brought to market with a lump of fat skewered 
on the outside, and are sold by the dozen strung 
on a stick like cherries. 

To cook them, roast them on a bird-spit, basting 
with their own fat, as it drips. A nice way for re- 
taining the whole flavor is to tie each bird closely 
in a vine leaf, and bake them in a dutch oven. Or 
wrap them in double vine irjaves, and roast them 
in the ashes of a wood fire. Remove the vine 
leaves before the birds are dished. 



<«v\A^^'^'^^V/vsr« 



ROASTED PIGEONS.— Take fine fat tame 
pigeons, and clean and truss them nicely. Four 
pigeons, at least, are requisite to make a dish. 
Prepare a stufling or forcemeat of finely minced 
veal, and an equal quantity of cold-boiled ham, 
seasoned with powdered mace and a very little 
cayenne. Also, two slices of bread and butter 
soaked in as much milk as they will absorb. Fill 
their bodies with this, (tying a string round to 
keep It in,) and roast the pigeons till thoroughly 
done ; basting with fresh butter or lard. 

Or you may stuff the pigeons with chopped 
mushrooms, seasoned with a little cayenne, and 
putting into each a piece of fresh butter rolled in 
flour. 

Or you may stufi* them with sweet poiato«, 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 309 

Doiled well, and maslied with plenty of Iresh butter. 
Or with chestnuts, boiled, peeled, and mashed with 
butter. 

Wild pigeons are generally too poor to roast. 
Id places where they abound, it has been found 
ver^ profitable to catch them in nets, clip their 
wings, and put them into inclosures, feeding them 
well with corn so as to make them fat. They will 
then bring as high a price as tame pigeons.

SAUCES. 



MELTED BUTTEE.— i^or Sauces.-^This k £ rv 
quently called Drawn Butter. ' For this purpose 
none should be used but fresh butter of the very 
best quality. It is usually sent to table with boiled 
fish and boiled poultry. Also, with boiled mutton, 
lamb, and veal. It is never served up with any 
thing roasted, fried or broiled. Numerous "sances 
are made with melted butter. If mixed with too 
much fiour and water, and not enough of butter, 
it wiU be very poor, particularly if the water is in 
too large proportions. To prepare it properly, 
allow a quarter of a pound of nice butter, to a 
heaped table-spoonful of flour. Mix the butter 
and flour thoroughly, before it goes on the fire. 
Then add to it four large table-spoonfuls of milk, 
or hot water, well mixed in. Hold it over the fire 
in a small sauce-pan, kept for the purpose. One

lined witli what is called porcelam or enamel ia 
best. Take care there is no blaze where the sauce- 
pan is held. Cover it, and shake it over the fire 
till it boils. Then having skimmed it, add three or 
four hard-boiled eggs chopped small, and give it 
one more boil up; or season it with any other 
ingredient with which you wish to distinguish the 
eauce. 

CLAKIFIED BUTTEE.— For this purpose use 
none but the very best fresh butter, such as is 
made in summer, when the cows are well pastured. 
Cut up the butter, put it into an enameled or 
porcelain stew-pan, and melt it gently over a clear 
and moderate fire. When it simmers, skim it 
thoroughly, draw it from the fire, and let it stand 
five minutes, that' the milk or sediment may sink 
to the bottom. Then pour it clear from the sedi- 
ment through a muslin strainer, or a fine clean hair 
sieve. Transfer to jars with close covers, and 
keep them in a cool dry place. If well prepared, 
and ofi:ginally very good, this butter will answer 
for sauces, stews, &c., and continue good a long 
time. In France, where they do not salt any butter, 
large quantities are melted in this way for winter 
use. 

COLORING FOR SAUCES.—i^or Pm^ >Sati^

ler. It will communicate a beautiful pink color, 
which you may heighten, by pressing the bag a 
little. When done, take out the bag, and stir the 
alkanet color evenly through the sauce. The alka- 
net has no taste, and is very cheap. Beet juice will 
ciolor a tolerable red. 

For Green Sauce. — Pound some fresh spinach 
leaves, till you extract a tea-cup or more of the 
clear green juice. Stir it into the melted butter 
while boiling. 

For Yellow Sauce. — Tie up a very little turmeric 
powder in a muslin bag. Let it boil in the butter. 
When done, take it out of the sauce-pan, and stir 
the yellow coloring evenly through the sauce. 

For White Sauce. — Make this with cream instead 
of milk. 

For Brown Sauce. — Stir in' plenty of French 
mustard. 

For Wine Sauce. — Stir in, just before you take 
the sauce from the fire, a large wme-glass or more 
of very good white wine, and grate in half a large 
nutmeg, adding the grated yellow rind, and the

To thicken white sauces, or soups, stir in a

liked. 

BEOWNED FLOUR.— Sift some fine flour, 
spread it on a large dish, or clean tin-pan. Place 
it before the fire, so as to brown bnt not to scorch 
or burn. It will color first at the edges ; therefore 
watch it, and keep it evenly mixed with the white 
flour from th-e centre. When all is nicely browned, 
sot it to cool, and then put it away for use in a large 
clean bottle or jar, well corked. Flour may be 
browned in an oven, after baking is over, taking 
care to stir it well. — Have two dredging boxes. 
One for browned flour and one for white. It is 
convenient also to have dredging-boxes for pow- 
dered herbs. The cost of these boxes is very tri- 
fling, and it saves time and trouble to have things 
ready when wanted. A small sieve for powdered 
white sugar is indispensable.

LOBSTER SAUCE.— This sauce is for fresh 
salmon or turbot, or sheep's-head fish. Also for 
salmon-trout, blue-fishj or the lake white-fish. 

Put a large hen lobster into a hard-boiling pot 
of highly-salted water, that the animal may die 
immediately. Continue the boiling with a steady 
heat, and in about three quarters, or an hour, the 
lobster will be done. When cold, extract all the 
meat from the shell, and cut it into small bits. 
Pound the coral, or red substance, in a marble mor-

taa*, with some fresh butter, or plenty of salad oil ; 
and a little cayenne. Add the coral to the cut- 
up lobster, and put the whole into a stew-pan, with 
some powdered mace and nutmeg, and a large 
table-spoonfiil of sweet oil. Divide into four bits 
a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, each bit rolled 
in flour. If your butter is not fresh and very good, 
omit it entirely and substitute a larger quantity of 
oil. As bad butter spoils every thing, never on 
aay account, use it. Set the sauce-pan over the 
fire, and let it boil up once. Then take it off, and 
while very hot, stir in the beaten yolks of two 
eggs. 

Crab sauce is made in the same manner. Prawn 
sauce also. 

SHRIMP SAUCE.— Shrimps are the smallest 
shell-fish of the lobster species. Put them into 
salted boiling water. They are done when they 
have turned entirely red. When cold^ pull off the 
heads, and peel off the shells from the bodies ; or 
squeeze out the meat with your fingers. Have 
ready some nice drawn butter, and thicken it with 
the shrimps, either chopped or whole. Season the 
sauce with mace or nutmeg powdered, and give it 
one boil up. Shrimp sauce is eaten with salmon 
and otlier fine fish. 

PICKLED SHRIMPS. — Having boiled, in 
salted water, three quarts or more of shrimps, and 
taken then from the shells, boil two quarts of the

best cider vinegar, and season it well with blades 
of mace and pepper-corns, and pour it hot on the 
shrimps, in a stone jar. Cork the jar, and seal the 
cork with the usual red cement for pickle jars: a 
mixture of one-third beeswax with two-thiida 
powdered rosin, and some fine brickdust, all melted 
together. 

OYSTER SAUCE.— Take a pint of the liquoj 
of fresh oysters, and strain it into a sauce-pan. If 
your oysters are salt, and you can get no others, 
boil a pint of milk instead of the oyster liquor, 
seasoning with powdered nutmeg and mace, and 
enriching it with fresh butter dredged with flour. 
When it has come to a boil, put in the oysters (hav- 
ing removed from each the gristle, or hard part.) 
Let them simmer, but take them from the fire with- 
out letting them come to a boil, which will shrivel 
them, and render them tough and tasteless. A new 
fashion is to season oyster sauce with the grated 
yellow rind and juice of a fresh lemon. Others 
stir in a glass of sherry or Madeira. If you use 
wine or lemon, you must not make the sauce with 
milk, as it will curdle. Use in this case the oyster 
liquor, if it is fresh, thickened well with finely 
grated bread-crumbs. The small, highly -flavored 
oysters, abounding on the coast of New England, 
are excellent for sauce, or soups.

Clams require longer cooking than oysters.

EGG SAUCE.— Boil four eggs from eight to 
twelve minutes. Then lay them in a pan of fresh 
water, and let them remain till quite cold. Peel 
off the shells, and take out the eggs. Chop the 
yolks and whites separately; mix them, lightly, 
into half a pint of melted fresh butter, made in the 
proportion of a quarter of a pound of batter to two 
large table-spoonfuls of flour, and four of milk and 
hot water. Add some powdered mace, or nutmeg. 
Egg sauce is eaten with boiled fish and poaltry. 

Instead of milk or water, you can use for melted 
butter, some of the water in which chicken or 
turkey was boiled, or some veal gravy. 



~M^<^V^^#t^t/S^^N«/«M~- — 



CELERY SAUCE.— Split and cut up into short 
slips a bunch of celery, having taken off the green 
leaves from the tops. The celery must have been 
well washed, and laid an hour in cold water. Take 
a pint of milk, and cut up in it a quarter of a 
poand of fresh butter that has been well dredged

MINT SAUCE.-— This is only used for roast 
lamb in the spring. When the lambs are grown 
into sheep, the mint is too old for sauce. But they 
harmonize very pleasantly when both are young. 

Take a large bunch of fine fresh green mint, that 
has been washed well. Strip the leaves from the 
stems, and mince them small. Put it into a pint 
bowl, and mix with it gradually some of the best 
cider vinegar. This sauce must not be the least 
liquid, but as thick as horse-radish sauce or thicker. 
Make it very sweet, with the best brown sugar. 
Mix it well, and transfer to a small tureen, or a 
little deep dish with a tea-spoon in it. Serve it 
up always with roast lamb, putting a tea-spoonful 
on the rim of your plate. 

A quais or more of mint sauce, made as above, but 
with a larger proportion of sugar and vinegar, will 
keep very well for several weeks, in a jar well 
corked. 

HORSE-EADISH.— Wash clean some roots of 
horse-radish, wipe them dry, and scrape off the 
outside. Then grate the sticks of horse-radish with 
a large grater. Put some of the grated horse-radish 
into a large saucer, or small deep plate, and moisten 
it with gool cider vinegar, but do not put so inuob

vinegar as will render it liquid. Send it to table 
with roast beef or mutton. 



**y<sr#^-^V 



CAULIFLOWER SAUCE.— Have ready some 
very rich good melted or drawn butter, made with 
milk and flavored with nutmeg. Thicken it with 
plenty of ready -boiled cauliflower, cut into little 
sprigs or blossoms. Give it one boil up after the 
cauliflower is in, aud send it to table with any sort 
of boiled poultry. It will be found very nice. For 
a boiled turkey it is far superior to celery sauce, 
and well suited to dinner company. 



BBOCCOLI SAUCE.— Make some nice drawn 
butter with milk. Flavor it with powdered mace. 
Pound some spinach in a mortar to extract the 
juice. StraiQ the spinach juice, and stir a small 
tea-cupfal into the butter to give it a fine green 
color. Have ready some well-boiled broccoli. Di- 
vide one or two heads of the broccoli into tufts or 
sprigs. Put them into the melted butter, and when 
it comes to a boil, take it off, and transfer it to a 
sauce-boat. Serve it up with boiled poultry or 
fresh fish. 

PARSLEY SAUCE.— Strip from the stalks 
the leaves of some fresh green parsley; allow 
plenty of it. Chop it slightly; and while the 
urawn butter is hot, stir into it the parsley, till the 
butter look» very green. Serve it up with boiled 



MISS I/Eslte's new cook book. 319 

fowls, rabbits, or boiled fish. The appearance of 
parsley sauce will be much improved by stirring 
in some spinach juice. The whole will be then a 
finte green. 

OEIMPED PAESLEY.— Pick the small sprigs 
of parsley from the large stalks. Wash it, and 
then throw it into cle<in cold water. After the 
meat or fish that it is to accompany has been fried 
and taken out of the pan, give the fat that remains 
a boil up, and lay the parsley into it. It will 
crimp and still continue green, if not kept frying 
too long. Take it out, drain it, and place it before 
the fire a few minutes, to dry it from the fat. Dish 
it laid on the top of the fish or steaks. 



'«**^^>if«^*#^^^^"^^/s^s'* 



FENNEL SAUCE. — The fennel should be 
young and fresh. Take a large handful, or more, 
and having washed it clean, strip the leaves from 
the stems, and boil it till quite tender. Put it into a 
sieve, and press the water well from it. Mince it 
very small, and stir it into drawn butter. 

It is served up with boiled fish. 

Instead of melted butter, you may put the fennel 
into veal gravy, thickened with butter dredged with 
fioui 

SAGE AND ONION SAUCE.— Take a bunch 
of fresh sage leaves. Wash and drain them. 
Pick them from the stems, and put them to boiJ 
in a small sauce-pan, with just water enough to 



820 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

cover them. Boil them fast about ten minutes 
Take them out, and press thorn in a sieve to drain 
them dry. Then mince or chop them small. Have 
ready two onions, boiled tender in another sauce- 
pan; chop them also, and mix them well with the 
minced sage. While warm, mix in a small bit 
of nice butter — season with pepper. Put this 
sauce into a little tureen, and serve it up with 
roast goose, roast duck, or roast pork, that has 
been stuffed with potato, bread, or other stuffing. 
The sage and onion sauce is for those who prefer 
their flavor to any other seasoning for thoso 
dishes. 

This sauce will be greatly improved if moist 
ened with some of the gravy of the duck or goose. 



^^^y^v/^^i^i^^i^***'" 



FESTE ONION SAUCE.— Peel some nice mild 
onions, and boil them in plenty of milk, skim- 
ming them well. When done, take them out of 
the milk, (saving it,) and slice them very thin, 
cutting the slices across, so as to make the pieces 
of onion very small. Return them to the sauce- 
pan of milk, (adding some fresh butter dredged 
with flour ;) season them with powdered mace or 
nutmegs and give the onions another boil, till 
they are soft enough to mash, and to thicken the 
milk all through. Eat this sauce with steaks, 
cutlets, rabbits, or chickens. 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 321 

PLAIN ONION SAUCE.— Peel some very 
small onions, and boil them whole in milk, (sea- 
soned slightly with pepper and salt,) and put in 
some bits of butter rolled in flour. Let them boil 
till tender all through, but not till they loose 
their shape. Eat them with any sort -of boiled 
meat. 

NASTURTION SAUCE.— This is eaten with 
boiled mutton ; is superior to caper sauce, and 
costs almost nothing, if you have nasturtions in 
your garden. Gather the green seeds as soon as 
they are full grown, and throw them (without the 
stems) into a jar of cider vinegar. They require 
no cooking, but keep a muslin bag of spice in thf 
jar, (mace and nutmeg broken small, and a little 
piece of root ginger.) To use them for sauce, 
make some nice drawn butter, and as it simmers 
throw in plenty of nasturtions from the jar. The 
seeds, when gathered, should be full grown, but 
by no means hard ; and the color a fine green. If 
there is the slightest brown tiiige, the nasturtion 
seeds are too old, and should be kept for planting.

MUSHEOOM SAUCE. — Have ready some 
excellent drawn butter, and thicken it with small 
button mushrooms that have been pickled. Or, 
take freshly -gathered mushrooms of good size, 
rub off the outer skin with a clean flannel, and 
cut off the stems close to the flaps. Wash the mush- 
rooms in a cullender. Have ready some bits of 



322 MISS LESLIE^S NEW COOK BOOK. 

iresh butter dredged ail over -vtith Scur. .Liav 
them among tlie mushrooms, (which, if very large, 
should be quartered,) and put them into a stew-pan. 
Cover the pan, and let them stew till the mush- 
rooms are all tender. When you take off the lid 
to try them, replace it immediately, keeping in aa 
much of the aroma as possible. If fresh, they 
will yield a great deal of juice. "When done, 
transfer them to a sauce-tureen, and serve them 
up with any nice dish of meat or poultry. 

The best mushrooms are found in pure open 
air or rather high ground, and where there is no 
swamp or woodland. On the upper side of their 
top they are not white, but of a pale grayish tint ; 
•.he under side is invariably light red, pinkish, 
or pale salmon color, which in a few hours, or 
after being gathered, turns brown. The false 
mushrooms are poisonous. They are entirely white 
above and below. The fungi that grow in fo- 
rests or marshes can never be mistaken for real 
mushrooms. They are of various colors, chiefly 
bright yellow and red, and originate in foul air. 
By boiling a silver tea-spoon with your mush- 
rooms, you may test their goodness. If the silver 
turns black, throw the mushrooms away. An 
onion will also blacken from the same cause. 
Mushrooms should be cooked as soon as possible. 
If kept two or three days, worms will be found in 
them. Never give mushrooms to children. Even 
in their best state they are not wholesome. The 
taste for mushrooms is an acquired one, and it is 
best net to acauire it. 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 323 

TOMATO SAUCE.— Scald some large ripe 
tomatos, to make them peel easily. Then quarter 
them, and press them through a sieve to divest 
them of their seeds. Put the juice into a stew- 
pan, adding some bits of fresh butter dredged 
with flour; add finely grated bread-crumbs, and 
season with a little pepper, and, if liked, a little 
onion boiled and minced. Set the pan over a 
moderate fire, and let the tomatos simmer slowly 
till it comes to a boil. Continue the boiling ten 
minutes longer. Serve it up in a sauce-tureen. 
It v/ill be mellowed and improved by stirring in 
(as soon as it comes to a boil) a table-spoonful or 
a lump of white sugar. 



TAREAGON SAUCE.— Put into a sauoe-pan 
a large half pint of any nice gravy that is at hand. 
After it has boiled five minutes, have ready a 
handful of fresh green tarragon leaves, minced, 
and moistened with plenty of cider vinegar. Add 
this to the gravy, and let it simmer five minutes. 
Then take it out, and serve it up with any kind of 
boiled poultry. 

TO MAKE GRAVY.— Take two pounds of 
the lean of veal, or of very nice beef. Cut it into 
small bits, and lay it in a sauce-pan with only as* 
much water as will cover it. Stew it slowl} 
(skimming it well) till the meat is all rags. Then 
strain the gravy, and thicken it with some bit? o; 
fresh buttei dredged all over with browned fl«>ur 



324 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK 

and give it anotlier simmer. You may flaror it 
with any seasoning you like. 

For made gravies, you can use any small pieces 
of fresh meat that has never been cooked, and the 
feet of calves and pigs. Boil in it also such ve- 
getables as you like, cut small. Strain out every 
thing before it goes to table. For gravies, use 
nothing that has been cooked before. They will 
not add to its goodness, but only render it flat 
and washy. 

"White gravy is made with fresh veal boiloa in 
milk; and after straining, thickened arrow-root, or 
rice flour, mixed with fresh butter, if real cream 
cannot be obtained. 



"»»»*''^^'#^^^'/'^v^"*~" 



MUSHROOM CATCHUP. — Let the mush- 
rooms be large and freshly- gathered, for they 
soon become worm-eaten if not speedily salted 
They should be well examined. Cut off the stalks 
of four quarts of nice mushrooms. Put the flaps 
into a deep earthen pan, and break them up with 
your hands. Strew among them half a pound of 
salt, reserving the largest portion of it for the 
top. Let them stand for three days, stirring them 
gently every morning. The fourth day, put them 
into a sieve, and draw off the liquor without 
pressing the mushrooms. When all the liquor 
has drained through, measure it, allowing to each 
quart a tea-spoon of cayenne, a dozen blades of 
mace, and a nutmeg broken up. Put the whole 
into a porcelain kettle, and boil it slowly till re

duced one half. Then pour it into a clean white- 
ware pitcher, cover it with a folded napkin, 
and keep it in a cool dry place till next day. 
Then, through a funnel, pour it gently from the 
sediment into small bottles. Finish with a tea- 
spoonful of sweet oil on the top of each. Cork 
the bottles tightly, and seal the corks. 

The next time you make catchup, proceed as 
above with the new mushrooms, and other ingre- 
dients ; and, when it is done, strain it, and put it 
into a clean kettle. Then add to it a quart v>f 
last year's mushroom catchup, and boil it a quarter 
of an hour. Then bottle it as above. 

This double catchup is very fine. 



•».'**'/'#^'^'^i#^^**«<- 



WALNUT CATCHUP.— Take two hundred 
walnuts or butter-nuts, while the green shel] ia 
still so soft that you can pierce it with the hee^d 
of a pin. Bruise them to small pieces, in a mar- 
ble mortar. Transfer them to a broad stone- waio 
pan, and stew amr r. g them six handfuls of salt 
Stir them three times a day, for ten days or two 
weeks. Then squeeze and strair* thf.ni through a 
cloth, pressing them very dry, till no more juice 
comes out. Boil up the liquor with two quarts 
of cider vinegar, half an ounce of mace, half an 
ounce of whole pepper, half an ounce of nutmegs 
broken up, and two roots of ginger cut small, and 
half a dozen shalots or small onions, peded and 
cut up, and a large bunch of sweet herbs. Let 
ihe whole boil for half an hour. Then pour off 



326 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

fche liquor into a large pitcher, leaving out the 
bunch of sweet herbs. Pour off the liquor 
(through a funnel,) into small bottles, having first 
put into the bottom of each bottle a portion of 
the spice. Fill the bottle up to the top with the 
catchup, finishing with a tea-spoonful of salad oil, 
which will greatly assist in keeping the catchup 
good. Cork the bottles very closely, and seal the 
corks. 

TOMATO CATCHUP.— Take a peck of large 
ripe tomatos. In the middle States they are in 
perfection the last of August. Late in the autumn 
^hey are comparatively insipid and watery. Cut 
X slit c^.own the side of every tomato. Put them 
mbO a large preserving kettle without any water. 
Their own juice is sufficient. On no account boil 
tomatos in brass or copper, their acid acting on 
those metals produces verdigris, and renders them 
poisonous. Boil them till they are quite soft, and 
easily mashed, stirring them up frequently from 
*.he bottom. Press and mash them through a hair 
sieve, till all the pulp has run out into the pan 
below, leaving in the sieve onlj^ \ne skins and 
seeds. Season the liquid with a little salt, some 
cayenne, and plenty of powdered nutmeg and 
mace. Mix it well, and when cold put up the 
catchup in small jars, the covers pasted all round 
with bands of white paper. This catchup, when 
done, should be verv thick and smooth. 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 827 

LEMON CATCHUP.— Take six fine large ripe 
lemons, and roll tliem under your hand to increase 
til e quantity of juice. Grate off all the yellow rind, 
and squeeze the juice into a pitcher, removing all 
the seeds. Prepare two ounces of finely scraped 
horse-radish, and two ounces of minced shalots, cr 
very small onions. Put them into a pint of boiling 
vinegar, in which half an ounce of bruised ginger 
and a quarter of an ounce of mace have been sim- 
mered for five minutes. Add to this the lemon- 
juice and the grated peel, and two grated nutmegs. 
Boil all together for half an hour, and then trans 
fer it with all the ingredients to a glass jar with a 
lid. Paste a band of strong white paper round the 
lower part of the lid. Set it in a dry cool place 
and leave it undisturbed for three months. Then, 
through a funnel, poar off the liquid into smali 
bottles, putting a tea-spoonful of salad oil at the 
top of each. Cork and seal them. 



CUCUMBER CATCHUP.— For a small quan- 
lity of this catchup, take twolve fine fall-grown 
cucumbers, and lay them an hour in cold water. 
Then pare them, and grate them down into a deep 
dish. Grate also two small onions, and mix tliein 
with the arrated cucumber. Season the mixture to 
your taste with pepper, salt, and vinegar, making 
it of the consistence of very thick marmahide or 
jam. "When thoroughly amalgamated, transfer it 
to a glass jar. Cover it closely, tying over it a

piece of bladder, so as to render it periectly air- 
tight. 

It will be found very nice, (wben fresh encum- 
bers are not in season,) to eat witb beef or mutton. 
And if properly made, and securely covered, will 
keep well. It should be grated very line, and the 
vinegar must be of very excellent quality — real 
older vinegar. 

CAMP CATCHUP.— Take a pint or quart of 
strong ale or porter, and a pint of white wine ; 
half a dozen shalots, or very small onions, peeled 
and minced ; half an ounce of mace, half an ounce 
of nutmeg, broken up ; and two large roots or raCes 
of ginger, sliced. Put all together, over a moderate 
fire, into a porcelain-lined kettle, and boil it slowly 
UU one-third of the liquid is wasted. Next day 
transfer it to small bottles, putting a portion of the 
>5easoning in the bottom of each, and filling them 
to the top with the liquid. Finish with a tea- 
spoonfiil of salad oil at the top. Cork the bottles 
with good corks, and seal them. In a dry place 
this catchu^^ will keep for years.

TAEEACtON vinegar.— The fresh leaves, 
of the tarragon plant are in perfection in July and 
August, and impart a new and pleasant ta^te to 
9uups, hashes, gravies, &;c. To use it fresh, wash 
a bunch of tarragon in cold water. AJ'terwards 
strip off the green leaves, chop or mince them, and 
boil a tea-spoonful or more in the dish you intend 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK, 

to flavor. 'I he best way of keeping tarragon is to 
strip off as many fresh leaves as will half fill a 
glass jar that holds a quart. Pour on as much real 
cider vinegar as will fill up the jar. Cover it 
closely, and let the tarragon infuse in it for a week, 
shaking the jar every day. Then pour off that 
vinegar carefully, and throw away the tarragon 
leaves that have been steeping in it. Wash that 
jar, or take another clean one, put into it the same 
quantity of fresh tarragon leaves, and fill up with 
the same vinegar in which you have infused the 
first supply. Let the second leaves remain in the 
jar of vinegar. A tarragon bush is well worth 
planting ; even in a small city garden. 

Tarragon is the chief ingredient of French 
mustard. 

FINE FRENCH MUSTARD.— Take a jill or 
iwo large wine-glasses of tarragon vinegar, (strained 
•rom the leaves,) and mix with it an equal quan- 
tity of salad oil, stirring them well together. Pound 
in a mortar, two ounces of mustard seed till it be 
comes a fine smooth powder, and mix it thoroughly 
Add to it one clove of garlic (not more) peeled, 
minced and pounded. V< ake the mixture in a deep 
wMte-ware dish. If the mustard affects your eyes, 
put on glasses till you have finished the mixture. 
"When done, put it up in white bottles, or gallipots. 
Cork them tightly, and seal the corks. Send it to 
table in those bottles. 

This mustard is far superior to any other, the 
tarragon imparting a peculiar and pleasant flavor. 



830 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

It is excellent to eat with any sort of roast meat 
particularly beef or mutton, and an improvemenl 
to almost all plain sauces, stews, soups, &c. 

French mustard is to be purchased very good 
&t all the best grocery stores.

SAUCE ROBERT.— Peel five laTge onions, anc 
parboil them to take off some of the strength. Cut 
them into small dice, and put them into a stew-pan 
with a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, divided 
into four, and dredged with flour. When they are 
well browned, pour on them half a pint of beef or 
veal gravy, and let it simmer for a quarter of an 
hour. Season it slightly with cayenne. Just be- 
fore it goes to table, stir in a table-spoonful of 
French mustard. 

This is a good sauce for any sort of roast meat, 
or poultry.

GREEN MAYONNAISE.— This is a fine ac- 
Rompaniment to cold poultry, which must be cut 
into small pieces as for chicken salad, using only 
the white meat. To begin the mayonnaise. Put 
Into a shallow pan the yolks only of three fresh eggs, 
having strained out the specks. Having beaten 
them till light and thick, add, by degrees a hjalf 
pint of salad oil, stirring it in gradually, so that 
no oil wh^a.tever is to be seen on the surface. Then 
add two table-spoonfuls of tarragon vinegar. Next 
a few drops of shalot vinegar, or a very small onion 
tniuced as iinel}^ 3"=? possible. If you have at hand

any clear meat gravy (for instance, veal,) stir m 
two or three taule-spconsful. Add the grated yel- 
low lind, and tlie juice of a lemon. Pound as 
mucli spinach as will yield a small tea-cupful of 
green juice. Give it a short boil up, to take off' 
the rawness, and mix it with the mayonnaise. 
When cool, pour it over the dish of cold poultry.

EPICUKEAN SAUCE.— Pound in a mortar 
five or six anchovies ; a heaped table-spoonfal of 
minced tarragon leaves; a shalot, or very small 
onion, two or three pickled gherkins, finely minced ; 
the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs, a quarter of a 
pound of fresh butter, and a large table-spoonful of 
French mustard. If you have no good butter, mix 
a sufficient portion of olive oil to moisten it well. 
Let the whole be thoroughly mixed. Put it into a 
bowl, and set it on ice till wanted. Then mould 
it into pats of equal size. Arrange them on small 
glass or china plates, and send them to table foj 
dinner company, to eat with the cheese.

EAST INDIA SAUCE FOE FISH.— Mix 
well together a jill of India soy; a jill of chili 
vinegar ; half a pint of walnut catchup, and a pint 
of mushroom- catchup. Shake the whole hard, 
and transfer it to small green bottles, putting a tea- 
spoonful of sweet oil at the top of each, and keep 
the sauce in a cool dry place. If you have not a 
fish oastor, bring the store sauces to table in tho

imall bottles they are kept in. When eating fish, 
mix a little of this with the melted butter on your 
plate. 

CUREY POWDER.— Curry powder originates 
in India, where it is mnch used as a peculiar flavor- 
ing for soups, stews, and hashes. With curry 
dishes, boiled rice is always served up, not only in 
a separate dish, but also heaped round the stew- 
in a thick even border. To make curry powder, 
pound in a marble mortar three ounces of turmeric, 
three ounces of coriander seed, and a quarter of an 
ounce of cayenne ; one ounce of mustard, one ounce 
of cardamoms, a half ounce of cummin seed, and 
half an ounce of mace. Let all these ingredient;: 
be thoroughly mixed in the mortar, and then sift it 
through a fine sieve, dry it for an hour before the 
fire, and put it into clean bottles, securing the corks 
well. Use from two to three table-spoonfals at a 
time, in proportion to the size of the dish you 
intend to curry. 

It may be mixed into the gravy of any of the 
preceding receipts for stews. Two ounces of finely 
grated cocoa-nut is a pleasant improvement to 
curried dishes, and is universally liked. 

The curry powder you buy is frequently much 
adulterated with inferior articles. The best curry 
powder imported from India is of a dark green 
color, and not yellow or red. It has among its 
ingredients, tamarinds, not preserved, as we always 
get them — but raw in the shell. These tamariDda 



mSS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 833

of thein use a lemon.

HABEAS CUBBY POWDEB.— Pound sepa- 
ratelj, and sift, six ounces of coriander seed, tkree 
of turmeric, one of bkck pepper, two of cummin, 
one of fennel seed, and half an ounce of cayenne. 
Mix all together, put them into a glass jar or bottle, 
and seal the cover. 

With less turmftric, you may use ginger or 
sassafras. 

Curry powder may be added to any stew of meat, 
poultry, or game. Boiled rioe must always accom- 
pany a dish of curry. 

The ingredients indispensable to all curries (and 
you may make a curry of any nice meat, or poultry, 
or even of oysters) is a very pungent powder, pre- 
pared for the purpose with turmeric. Also onions 
and boiled rice. In India there is always some- 
thing acid in the mixture, as lemons, sour apple 
juice, or green tamarinds. The turmeric has a 
peculiar flavor of its own.

STORE SAUCES.— The celebrated Englisli 
sauces, for fish and game, Harvey's sauce, (which 
is the best,) Quin's, Reading's, Kitchener's, Soyer's, 
&c., are all very good, and keep well, if genuine. 
They are imported in small sealed bottles, and are 
to be had of all the best grocers. To make them at 
nonie, is so troublesome and expensive, that it i?

better to buy them. They are, however, very nice, 
and are generally introduced at dinner parties ; a 
little being mixed on your plate with the melted 
butter. If you have no fish castors, bring these 
sauces to table in their own bottles, to be carried 
round by a servant. 



^■^\/^^^/v•^ 



FINE PINK SAUCE.— Take a pint of excel- 
lent port wine, the juice and grated yellow rinds 
of four large lemons, two dozen blades of mace and 
a large nutmeg, broken up ; with a quarter of an 
ounce of piepared cochineal, or a small tea-spoon- 
ful of alkanet chips. Add a table-spoonful of fresh 
salad oil. Mix the whole well in a wide-mouthed 
glass jar with a lid. Let the ingredients infuse a fort- 
night ; stirring it several times a day. Then strain 
it, pour it through a funnel into small bottles, and 
seal the corks. It will give a fine pink color to 
drawn butter. Eat it with any sort of fish or game. 

Alkanet producer a much finer color than cochi- 
neal, but it must Uiiite with some substance of an 
oily nature to give out its color to advantage. It 
is very cheap, and very beautiful, and to be had at 
the druggist's. Infuse it tied in a thin muslin bag. 



WINE SAUCE FOE YENISON OR GAME. 
— ^Take the half of a sixpenny loaf of bread. Cut 
off all the crust. Put the crumb (or soft part) into 
a bowl, and pour on sui!icient good port wme to 
ate^p it. Soak the bread in the wine till dissolvM. 



MISS LESLIE^S NEW COOK BOOK. 335 

Then add two heapedtable-spoonsful of fresh "batter, 
and two heaped spoonsful of sugar ; seasoning with 
powdered mace and nutmeg, and the grated yellow 
rind and juice of a lemon. Beat all together till 
very smooth. Put it into a sauce-pan, and give it 
one boil up ; taking it off as soon as i-t comes to a 
boil. Send it to table hot. It is a fine company 
sauce for venison, or hare, or any sort of game. 



i<V\A^^'^(/^^/N^lA>« 



FINE PUDDING SAUCE.— Take a large half- 
pint cup of the best fresh butter, and the same 
quantity of powdered loaf-sugar. Put them together 
in an earthen pan, and beat them to a light thick 
cream. Then mix a jill or wine-glass of boiling 
water, and a large wine-glass of the best brandy, 
with the grated yellow rind and juice of a large 
lemon or orange; and a small nutmeg, grated. 
Mix these ingredients, gradually, with the beaten 
butter and sugar ; and transfer the sauce to a small 
tureen, putting a spoon or ladle into it. 

If designed for sauce to a plum-pudding or a:.y 
other large one, you will require a pint of butter, 
a pmt of sugar, half a pint of boiling water with 
half a pint of brandy, two lemons or oranges, and 
a large nutmeg, or two small ones. Divide the 
sauce in two tureens. A boiled pudding for com- 
pany requires no finer sauce than this. 

Where real cream is plenty, a b/V/l of it well 
sweetened with sugar, and flavored with nutmeg, 
is nice for any boiled pudding. If you add wine 
or lemon juice to cream sauce, previously mix the

VAN ILL A SAUCE.— Split and break up a 
small stick of vanilla, and boil it in a very little 
milk, till all the vanilla flavor is extracted. Then 
titrain it through very fine muslin, and stir it into 
the cream. Give it one boil up in a small porce- 
lain sauce-pan; and sweeten it well with white 



sugar.

PLAIN SAUCE FOE PUDDIKG.— Stir to- 
gether (as in making pound cake) equal quantities 
of fresh butter and white sugar. This is the usual 
proportion ; but if you can stir or beat it easily, 
try a little less butter, and a little more of the sugar. 
Grate in some nutmeg, and the yellow rind of a 
fresh lemon, and send it to table heaped on a small 
plr.te, with a tea-spoon near it.* 

Many persons prefer, with plain puddings, cold 
butter on a butter plate, and sugar from the sugar- 
bowl ; mixing it for themselves on their own plate. 
This is best for boiled iruit pudding or dumplings ; 
and for egg or batter puddings, molasses or syrup 
is very good ; and costs but little.

CRAJSTBEREY SAUCE.— Pick tlie cr^nherries 

cleaiij seeing that no stems, sticks, or dead leaves are 
left among them. Put them into a cullender, or sieve, 
and wash them through two waters. Ccok them 
m a porcelain-lined, or enameled stew-pan, without 
any additional water. The water that remains 
about them after washing is quite sufficient for 
stewing them properly. No stewed frnit should 
be too thin or liquid. Keep a steady neat under the 
cranberries, stirriag them up from the bottom fre- 
quently : and when they are soft, mash them with 
the back of the spoon. When they are quite shape- 
less, take them off the fire, and while they are very 
hot, stir LQ, gradually, an ample quantity of nice 
bwwn sugar. They require much sweetening. Sea- 
son them with nothing else. Their natural flavor is 
suf&cient (if well sweetened) and cannot be im- 
proved by spice, lemon, or any of the usual con- 
diments. Always buy the largest and ripest cran 
berries. The best things are cheapest in the end. 

In stewing any sort of fruit, do not add the sugar 
till the fruit is done, and taken from the fire. If 
sweetened at the beginniag, much of the strength 
of the sugar evaporates in cooking ; besides render- 
ing the fruit tough and hard, and retarding the 
progress of the stew. 

In America, sweet sauce is eaten with any sort 
of roast meat. Send it to table cold. For company, 
put it into a blanc-mange mould, and turn it out in 
d shaoe, first dipping the mould, for a minate, in 
warm water to loosen it.

APPLE SAU^E— Get fine juicy apples— bell: 
flowers are tlie best for cooking. Sweet apples 
cook very badly — becoming tough, dry and taste- 
less. Green apples, if full grown, cook well, and 
have a pleasant acid. 

For sauce, pare, core, and quarter or slice the 
apples. Wash the pieces in a cullender, and put 
them to stew, with only water enough to wet them 
a little. Apple stews that are thin and watery are 
disgraceful to the cook, or to the cook's mistress. 
Let them stew till you can mash them easily all 
through. Then take them off the fire, and sweeten 
them, adding the seasoning while the apples are 
warm. Season with rose-water, lemon juice, nut- 
meg ; or with all these if for company. If you can 
get fresh lemon-peel, cut it into very thin slips, and 
put it in to stew with the apples at first. It is still bet- 
ter, and little more trouble, to grate the lemon-peel. 

Fruit for pies should be stewed in the same 
manner as for sauce, and not sweetened till taken 
from the fire. Let the paste be baked empty in large 
deep plates, and when cool, filled to the brim with 
stewed fruit. A pie, (as we have seen them,) only 
half or one third fall, looks very meanly — and 
thstes so. 

All these fruit-sauces are good receipts for stew- 
ing fruit for pies or any other purpose. 

We advise all families to have, among {}\eir 
kitchcD utensils, hain maries^ or double- kettles^ put- 
tijig the article to be stewed in the inner kettle, 
and the boiling water in the outside ona They 
ai'e to be had of all sizes at the furnLshing stDree.

They are also excellent for custards and lK>iled 
puddings. 

BAKED APPLE SAUCE.— Core very nicely 
as many fine jnicy apples as will fill a large bak- 
ing-pan. All coring of apples should be done with 
a tin cover. This you can buy at a tinman's for a 
quarter dollar, and it is invaluable for the purpose. 
After coring the apples, pare them smooth and 
evenly. Put a large table-spoonfiil of cold watei 
in the bottom of the baking-pan, and then put in 
the apples first, filling, with fine brown sugar, the 
hole from whence the core was taken out. To 
nave them very nice, add some grated lemon-peel, 
or some rose-water. Set the pan into an oven, (not 
too hot,) close the oven, and bake till the apples 
are all broken and can be easily mashed. This 
way of making apple sauce, by baking in a close 
oven, will be found far superior to boiling or stew- 
ing them. They require no more water than is 
IS barely sufficient to give them a start at the bot- 
tom. 

The flavoring (sugar, lemon, or rose,) may be de- 
ferred till the apples are baked, taken out of the 
oven and mashed. Then mix it in while hot. 

Boiled apple sauce is usually spoiled with too 
much water, rendering it the consistence of thin 
pap, weak washy, and mean.

throngli two waters. Put them into an enameled 
stew-pan, with only the water remaining on them 
after washing, and no sugar till after they are 
stewed to a mash, and taken from the fire. Then 
while hot, stir in brown sugar enough to make 
them very sweet. Serve them up cold. For com- 
pany, before they are sweetened, press them through 
a sieve, using only the pulp. Then add the sugar 
and mould the whole in a form.

CUERANT SAUCE.— Take fine ripe currants, 
and strip them from the stems. Put them into a 
pan, and mash them with a large spoon, or a 
wooden beetle. Stew them in their own juice (no 
water,) and sweeten them when they are taken 
from the fire. For company, press the fruit through 
a sieve before you add the sugar, and shape it Iq a 
mould. 

It will answer every purpose of regular currant 
jellv, to eat with game, venison, &c.

RIPE PEACH SAUCE.— Take juicy freestone 
peaches ; pare and stone them, and cut them up. 
Save all the juice, and stew them in it. When 
quite soft, take them off the fire, and sweeten them. 
The fiavor will be much improved by stewing witii 
them a bunch of fresh peach leaves, to be taken 
ort when the peaches are done. Or, if you cannot

p^ach kernels, stewed with the fruit, (and to be 
taken out afterwards,) will answer the purpose. 

It is well, even in the sunny side of a citj^ 
garden, to plant two peach stones; so that when 
they grow into trees, you may have peach leaves at 
hai.d for improving the flavor of custards, and 
other things. Unless the trees are perfectly healthy, 
and the leaves green, do not use them.

DEIEr PEACH SAUCE.— The richest and 
best dried peaches, are those that are dried with 
th'.5 skins on. The skins (however thick,) entirely 
dissohe iii coo]dng, and become imperceptible 
whon the fruit is well stewed. It is a great error to 
pare peaches for drying. Apples must be pared, 
for the skin is tougher than that of peaches, and 
does not dissolve in cooking. 

To prepare dried peaches for stewing, pick 
them over carefully, throwing away all the imper- 
fect pieces. Wash them in two cold waters, and 
then put them into a stew-pan, {adding no water,) 
and stew them till they are quite soft, and shape- 
less, and mash easily aud smoothly in the pan. 
Sweeten them with plenty of brown sugar, as soon 
as they come off the fire.

mon, or other spice of any sort you like, and the 
yeliow rind of a fresh lemon or orange, pared very 
thin ?jid cut into slips. When these apples are 
well stewed and mashed, sweeten them. 

"We believe, that when dried peaches can be 
procured, few will buy dried apples ; they are so 
far inferior ; being the poorest of dried fruit. 

Dried cherries also are scarcely worth cooking, 
even if they have been stoned. Being tough and 
indigestible, they are very unwholesome, except 
for rough, hard-working people. If the stones are 
left in, dried cherries are fit for nothing.

DAMSON SAUCE.— Having stewed the dam- 
sons in their own juice, till all the stones slip out, 
(and can be easily removed with a spoon, when

Damsons, cranberries, and gooseberries require

CHESTNUT SAUCE.—Take the large Spanish

A merican chestnuts, boil then till quite soft, (try- 
ing two or three to ascertain,) then peel, and 
thicken your melted butter with them. American 
chestnuts are too small to roast.

VEGETABLES. 



All vegetables are best when fresh, as can ea- 
sily be discovered by the difference between those 
newly brought from the garden, and those that 
have been kept in a provision shop till next day, 
(and perhaps longer,) imbibing the atmosphere of 
meat, fish, poultry, and a variety of things, each 
becomina: impure from the same causes ; not to 
mention the rats, mice, and insects which run 
over them at night. You cannot have vegetables 
in perfection without a country garden. But if 

obliged to depead upon the market or the provi- 

21 



S44 MISS Leslie's new cook book 

sion shops, always have your vegetables washed 
and la'd in cold water before cooking. Some are 
best when put on to boil in cold water ; others re- 
quire boiling water at the beginning, to give them 
what the cooks call a quick start. All should be 
thoroughly done throughout. If hard in the 
centre they are unpalatable, and very unwhole- 
some; even worse than underdone meat. Use 
but very little salt in cooking vegetables ; too 
much renders them hard, and overpowers their real 
taste. Also, it is easy for the lovers of salt to add 
more when at table. When vegetables are done, 
and taken out the pot, drain them well through a 
cullender or sieve, carefully pressing out all the 
water that is about them. There is generally, in 
our country, too much water allowed to the vege- 
tables. Merely enough to cover them well, and 
keep them from burning, is in most cases suffi- 
cient In France, so little water is used in cook- 
ing vegetables, that they are rather stewe^.i than 
boiled, and are the better for it. A puddle of 
greasy water in the bottom of every vegetable 
dish is a disgusting sight; and yet how frequently 
it is seen. If of every-day occurrence, it is a 
certain indication of a bad cook, or an inefficient 
mistress, or both. 

Almost all green vegetables should be throwa 
into fast-boiling water, and cooked rapidly; first 
washing them carefully, and laying them ^or half 
an hour in a large pan of cold water. If fv^dod 
frozen in the winter, be sure to thaw th^m id 
cold water. Continue ^le boiling till they »'•

thofoughlj done, and with a steady heat, taking 
off the scum as it rises. 

It is very usual in the spring to bring early 
vegetables from the south, for the markets of Phi 
ladelphia and New York. By the time they reach 
us they are faded, withered, tough and unwhole- 
some. It is better to wait a week or two longer 
till the season is a little more advanced, and the 
farms and gardens of our neighborhood can sup- 
ply our own markets, at a far less cost, and with 
fresher and better vegetables. 

The water in which vegetables have been boiled 
becomes very unwholesome, and should be thrown 
out immediately.

BOILED POTATOS.— To have boiled potatos 
in perfection they should all be of a good sort 
and as nearly as possible of the same size. Till 
it is time to cook them, let the slight mould or 
earth that has adhered to the potatos in digging, 
be carefully washed off, even scrubbing them with 
a hard brush. This can be done very conve- 
niently, by laying them under the hydrant or 
pump, washing them there with a broom, and let 
ing the water run on them. 

An iron pot is the best of all things for boiling 
potatos, as it retains the heat longer than anj? 
other utensil. Lay them in it, closely and com- 
pactly, and pour in barely sufficient cold water to 
sover them well, adding a tea-spoonful of salt. 
Trimmer them till nearly done, which you may 



346 MISS Leslie's new cook: book. 

ascertain by probing all through with a fork 
You may quicken the firs for the last five min- 
utes. Pour off all the water from them as soon 
as they are tender all through. Lift the lid of the 
pot at one side to allow the steam to pass off, and 
set them beside the fire, or on a trevet far above 
it, till the moisture has escaped ; the potatos will 
then be dry and mealy. Then peel them ; or if 
preferred, send them to table with the skin on, 
which will keep them hot longer. 

If the potatos are old, cut a piece of skin 
(about the size of a sixpence) from the top and 
bottom before boiling; or, take off a long slip 
from each side. In the spring, when quite old, 
cut out all the blemishes, pare the potatos, and 
always boil them for mashing. 



"Wv/^^^^^^^SA^^**"" 



EOAST POTATOS.— -Potatos for roasting 
should always be large and fine. If small, " they 
go all to skin." Select those that are nearest 
of a size, and wash them very clean, and wipe 
every one with a cloth. Put them into an oven, 
and let them roast or bake for more than two 
hours, turning tkem with a fork. Dish them 
in the skins, and send only cold butter to table 
with them. Bake sweet potatos in the same 
manner, but much longer. Small sweet potatos 
should be boiled; as, when small, they are not 
worth cooking in any other way ; and when roasted 
there is scarcely any thinp: of them, but tough 
shriveled skin 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 347 

BAKED POTATOS.— Pare some fine potatoa 
all about the same size, and cover with them the 
whole bottom of a large deep earthen dish ; lay 
them close together so that thej all touch. Bake 
them under a nice piece of beef, veal, or pork, raised 
above them on a trivet. The gravy from the meat 
will drip upon them as soon as it begins to bake. 
They must bake till they are nicely browned, and 
till a fork will easily go through them. Have a 
smaller dish of potatos baked without meat, in a 
dish by themselves, as potatos pared before bak- 
ing are much liked. Lay some bits of fresh butter 
among those that are cooked without any meat. 



>M/^S/^V^<^^^\/VNAMM« 



TO BOIL NEW POTATOS.— Kub each one 
with a coarse cloth to clear off the skin, it being 
too thin for paring. Wash them well, and cut a 
small piece off the top and battom of each potato, 
to make them boil tender all through. Put no 
salt in the water, and boil them till soft. Serve 
them plain, and eat them with cold butter — or, 
put them into a sauce-pan, and stew them in 
butter. 

MASHED POTATOS— Having boiled the po- 
tatos till tender all through, drain them very dry 
in a cullender, and mash them smoothly with a 
potato beetle, a large wooden spoon, or a short- 
handled wooden ladle. When all are nicely 
mashed, add gradually plenty of fresh butter, and 
8ome cream or rich milk. On no account spoil

the pdtatos by putting any water to them, when 
mashing. Put them into a deep dish or mould 
and brc wn them with a' salamander. 



~**^^^'^'< 



POTATO CAKES.— After the mashed potatos 
are mixed with butter in a deep earthen pan, beat 
them with a wooden spoon to reder them very 
light. Then make them up into thick flat cakes, 
about the size of a muffin, and brown each with a 
salamander. 

COUNTKY POTATOS.— Having boiled and 
peeled some fine newly-dug potatos, melt some 
butter in a sauce-pan, with cream, instead of flour 
and water, and pour it plentifully into the dish of 
potatos ; seasoning with black pepper and sweet 
marjoram leaves. Where cream is plenty, this is 
a very nice way of cooking. Serve them up with 
the sauce poured over them, and around them. 
They must be well boiled, and tender all through. 



'*VS/V*^-^'^#i^^S»» 



FEIED POTATOS.— The potatos must be raw, 
large, unblemished, and of a good round shape. 
First take off a thin paring of the skin. Then 
pare the whole potato round and round, (not too 
thin,) till you have gone through it all, and nothing 
is left unpared but a little lump in the centre. 
Then put these continuous rings of potato into a 
frying-pan, in which is boiling plenty of fresh 
butter, o: butter and lard mixed Fry them

brown and tender, and arrange them handsomely 
in a dish for brealvfast. 

Another Woy. — Slice thin a sufficiency of fine 
raw potatos, and lay them in a pan of cold water 
tc soak for an hour or more. Then pour ofl' that 
water entirely, and replace it with fresh. Let them 
remain in this for another hour, or till it is time to 
cook them. Put them into a fiying-pan that has 
in it plenty'- of fresh butter or lard, enough, while 
frying, to keep the potatos near the surface. Fry 
them till perfectly well done and tender. 

Attempting to re-cook cold potatos renders their 
more hard and tough. 

When once cold, potatos always remain indi 
gestible, cook them as you will. 



STEWED POTATOS.— Having pared some 
firte raw potatos, quarter them, and put them into 
a stew-pan with a little salt, pepper, and some green 
sweet marjoram stripped from the stalks, and scat 
tered among the potatos. Put them into a stew 
pan with milk enough to prevent their burning, 
and some fresh butter — no water. If you can get 
cream conveniently, add some to the milk. Cover 
the pan, and let the potatos stew, till, on trying 
them with a fork, you find them thoroughly 
cooked, and soft and tender all through. If not 
sufficiently done, they are hard, tough, leathery, and 
unfit to eat. 

They are very good stewed entirely in the drip- 
ping of cold gravy of roast beef, veal, or pork^

but not mutton, as that will give them the ta3i« 
of tallow. This is a nice breakfast dish. Cold 
potatos re-cooked never again become good. After 
potatos once become cold, no cooking can restore 
them. 

STEWED SWEET POTATOS.— These should 
drst be scraped or pared. Then cut into pieces, 
and stewed as above.

BOILED CABBAGE.— All cabbage should be 
\9ell washed, and boiled in a large quantity of 
water with a little salt ; the loose or faded leaves 
oeing stripped from the outside. They should al- 
ways be cut or split in two, or in four pieces if 
very large. Cut the stalk short, and split it up to 
where the leaves begin. Put it on in boiling water, 
and keep it boiling steadily till quite done, which 
will not be till the stalk is tender throughout. If 
a young summer cabbage, split it in half, and when 
well boiled, and drained and pressed in a cullender. 
serve it up with a few bits of cold fresh butter, laid 
inside among the leaves. Season it with pepper. 
This is a much nicer and easier way, than to make 
drawn butter, and pour over the outside of the cab- 
bage. 

Sprouts and very young greens, require nothmg 
more than to be well washed, boiled and drained. 
[n the country, cabbage sprouts are commonly 
boiled with bacon.

AN EXCELLENT WAY OF BOILING CAB- 
BAGE. — Having trimmed the cabbage, and washed 
it well in cold water, (examining the leaves to see 
that no insects are lurking among them,) cut it 
almost into quarters, but do not divide it entirely 
down at the stem, which should be cut off just be 
low the termination of the leaves. Let it lie ar 
hour in a pan of cold water. Have ready a pot 
full of boiling water, seasoned with a small tea- 
spoonful of salt. Put the cabbage into it, and let 
it boil for an hour and a half, skimming it occa 
sionally. Then take it out; put it into a cullendei 
to drain, and when all the hot water has drained of^ 
set it under the hydrant. Let the hydrant run on 
it, till the cabbage has become perfectly cold all 
through. If you have no hydrant, set it under a 
pump, or keep pouring cold water on it from a 
pitcher. Then, having thrown out all the first 
water, and washed the pot, fill it again, and let 
the second water boil. During this time the cab- 
bage under the hydrant w;ill be growing cold. 
Then put it on again in the second water, and boil 
it two hours, or two and a half. Even the thickest 
part of the stalk must be perfectly tender ail 
through. When thoroughly done, take up the

ing it down with a broad ladle to squeeze out all 
the moist lU'e; lay it in a deep dish, and cut it en- 
tirely apart, dividing it into quarters. Lay some 
bits of fresh butter among the leaves, add a little 
pepper, cover the dish, and send it to table hot. 

Cooked in this manner it will be made per 
fectly wholesome, and the usually unpleasant cab- 
bage smell will be rendered imperceptible. We 
lecommend it highly.

CALE CANNON. — Boil in one pot a fine large 
cabbage, and when done, drain and press it in a 
cullender till all the water is squeezed out. Have 
boiled in another, four or five large mealy potatos. 
Peel and mash the potatos, and chop the cabbage 
small. Mix the cabbage and the potatos evenly, in 
one large dish, and season them with black pepper ; 
adding some bits of nice butter. Cale cannon is a 
plain family dish, but is very good, when all the

them fine with a cabbage-cutter. Wash them well 
in two waters, and drain them in a cullender. 
Next lay the shred cabbages in a large earthen 
pan, add a table-spoonful of salt, and a pint of 
the best cider vinegar. Stir and toss the cabbage 
in this, and let it steep for three hours. Then wash 
and drain it, and put it into a large stew-pan, with 
half a pound of nice sweet butter, or a quarter of a 
pound of lard. Season it with a little black pepper, 
and three table-spoonfuls of French mustard, or a 
jill of tarragon vinegar. Cover the whole with a 
buttered white paper, and stew it slowly for two 
hours longer. Take off the paper, and send the 
sour crout to table in a covered dish. 

You may lay on the top of the stew, a pound of 
sausage meat, or of sausage cakes. Or a thin slice 
or two of cold ham.

DRESSING FOR SLAW.— Mix a small pint 
of reai cider vinegar with four large table-spoon 
fnls of nice fresh butter, divided into four 
bits, and eacn bit rolled in flour ; a tea-spoon 
of salt, and a salt-spoon of cayenne. Being well 
stirred, and mixed thoroughly, boil this in a por- 
colain-lined sauce-pan ; and, as soon as it has come 
to a fast boil, remove it from the fire, and stir in

the beaten yolk of four eggs. Have ready a nice 
fresli white cabbage, that has been washed, drained, 
and cut. or shaved, into small shreds with a cab- 
bage cutter. Lay the shred cabbage in a deep 
dish or bowl, while you prepare the above dress- 
ing. Having taken it from the fire, and stirred in, 
gradually, the beaten yolk of egg, pour the dress- 
ing hot over the cabbage : mixing it all with a 
large boxwood salad-spoon or fork. Set it out of 
doors to cool ; or cool it quickly on ice or snow. 

Or if preferred warm, place it on the top of a 
stove, and cover it closely till wanted. It may be 
made of red cabbage. 

This slaw (either cold or warm) will be founc' 
very superior to all others, if this receipt is exactly 
followed. 

SALSIFY FKITTERS.— Having washed and 
ecraped the salsify roots, and cut off the extreme 
joints, stand them up and grate them. Beat three 
eggs very light, and stir them gradually into a 
pint of milk, with sufficient fxour to make a stiff 
batter. Instead of grating the salsify you may 
cut it into pieces, and boil it till quite soft, so that 
you can mash it easily. Add a little pepper. 
Have ready over the fire a deep frying-pan or 
skillet, with plenty of boiling lard. Pat in a 
large spoonful of the batter, and into the middle 
of each drop a spoonful of the mashed salsify. 
Fry these fritters of a light brown on both sides, 
and take them out with a perforated skimmer, 
draining off the lard through its holes. 



856 MISS leslib's new cook book. 

You inay fry the mashed salsify without the 
batter, taking large spoonfuls, and dipping each 
in beaten egg first, and afterward twice over in 
grated bread-crumbs, so as to resemble fried oys- 
ters. 

Or you may first boil the roots merely split in 
two, and then fry them in fresh butter, or bake 
them brown in an oven. 



»*^s/Vs/i'^\^^^r^«* 



SALSIFY OYSTERS.— Get some fine salsify 
roots, (called also oyster-plant,) and wash and 
scrape them well. Boil them in sufficient fresh 
oyster liquor to cover them well, and when they 
are soft take them out, split them, and cut them 
into pieces about two inches long. Then put them 
into a stew-pan, with the oyster liquor, some 
pieces of fresh butter rolled in flour, and some 
blades of mace and some grated nutmeg, with a 
few whole pepper-corns. Let them cook between 
five and ten minutes, having stirred among them 
the beaten yolks of two or three eggs. Serve 
them up hot, as a side dish. 



»*<^^^S/l'^V 



MELONGINA OR EGG-PLANT.— Take a 
large fine egg-plant, and see that there are no 
blemishes about it. Having cut it into thin round 
&iices, (without paring off the skin,) sprinkle be- 
tween the slices a very little salt and pepper, cover 
them with a plate, and let them rest an hour moi'e. 
Then wipe the pieces dry. Have some beaten egg 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 857 

m one deep plate, and some bread-crumbs, rinelj' 
grated, in another. Dip each slice of egg-plant 
first into the beaten egg^ and then into the bread- 
crumbs, and fry them brown in a pan full of boil- 
ing lard, or else lard and fresh butter mixed in 
equal quantities. Take them out with a perfo- 
rated skimmer, and drain them well. 

They will be much better if each slice is dipped 
twice in the egg, and twice in the crumbs. 

They may be fried very plainly, simply dredged 
with flour, and then put into a pan with plenty 
of boiling lard, the lard drained well from each 
slice when it is done. They should be fried brown 
on both sides. If underdone, and left greenish or 
whitish, they have a raw bitter taste. 



BAKED EGG- PLANTS. — Prepare several 
fine large unblemished egg-plants, by scoop- 
ing out the inside or pulp with a spoon, leaving 
the rind standing. To do this you must cut off 
very nicely and evenly a round piece from the 
top, (afterwards to be tied on again.) Make a 
sufficient quantity of forcemeat or stuffing of 
soaked bread, pressed and dried slightly ; fresh 
butter; mineed sweet marjoran leaves; a little 
pepper and salt; and some powdered mace, and 
the yellow rind of a lemon grated off vqt"^ fine. 
Mix all these with the pulp or insire of the egg- 
plant. When thoroughly mixed, stuff with it 
the rind or outside into a perfectly round shape, 
and vi Jth a packthread tie on the top-piece which 



358 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

was cut off. Put the egg-plants into a dish, the 
bottom covered with thin slices of cold ham 
Bake them for an hour or more, and then send 
them to table whole, with the slices of ham laid 
round on the dish. Remove the strings. 



FBIED BANANAS.— The bananas should be 
perfectly ripe and yellow all over. Peel them, 
split them into long slips, and dredge them slightly 
with flour. Have ready a frying pan filled with 
boiling lard. Put in the bananas, and fry them 
well. When done, take them up on a perforated 
skimmer, and drain back the lard into the frying 
pan. Dish, and send them to table with powdered 
^sugar to eat with them. 

In the West Indies, the large green bananas 
that are exported from thence, are by no means in 
favor, compared with a very small yellow sort, the 
only banana eaten at the best tables. The little 
ones are fried in the above manner. 



«^l/S/S#^'^l/v#^vr^MM- 



ONION CUSTARD.— Peel and slice ten or 
twelve mild onions, and fry them in fresh butter, 
draining them well when you take them up. 
Then mince them as fine as possible. Beat four 
eggs till very thick and light, and stir them gra- 
dually into a pint of milk, in turn with, the 
minced onion. Season the whole with plenty of 
gratydd nutmeg, and stir it very hard. Then put it 
into a deep white dish, and bake it about a quar-

be eaten with poultry. It is a French preparation, 
and will be found very nice, by those who have 
QO dislike to onions.

CAULIFLOWERS.— Choose large fine whit-e 
cauliflowers. Wash them well, and lay them in 
a pan of cold water, having divided each cauli- 
flower into quarters. Trim off the outside green 
leaves. Put on the cauliflowers in boiling water 
with a little salt in it. It is still better to boil 
them in milk. Let them cook till tender through- 
out, flower and stalk. When quite done, put 
some bits of fresh butter among the flowers, or 
pour over them drawn butter sauce, made with 
milk^^and seasoned with powdered nutmeg or mace. 
Serve them up hot, and covered

BROCCOLI — Is drest in the same manner. It 
IS very good with toast under, though inferior to 
cauliflower. 

CAULIFLOWER OMELET.— Take the white 
parx of a boiled cauliflower after it is cold ; chop 
it very small, and mix with it a sufficient quan- 
tity of well beaten-egg, to make a very thick 
batter. Then fry it in fresh butter in a small pan,

FRIED CAULIFLOWER— naving laid a fi^a 
cauliflower in cold water for an hour, put it iutci 
a pot of boiling water that ha.s been slightly 
salted, (milk and water will be still better,) and 
boil it twenty-five minutes, or till the large atalk 
IS perfectly tender. Then divide it, equally, into 
•mall iufts, and spread it on a dish to cool. Pre- 
pare a sufficient quantity of batter made in the 
proportion of a table-spoonful of flour, and two 
table-spoonfuls of milk to each egg. Beat the 
eggs very light, then stir into them the flour and 
milk alternately; a spoonful of flour, and two 
spoonfuls of milk at a time. When the cauli- 
flower is cold, have ready some fresh butter in a 
frying-pan over a clear fire. When it has come 
to a boil and has done bubbling, dip each tuft of 
cauliflower twice into the pan of batter, and fry 
them a light brown. Send them to table hot. 

Broccoli may be fried in this manner. 



•*IN»S^^^^I^^S/^*/^ 



CAULIFLOWER MACCARONL — Having 

removed the outside leaves, and cut off the stalk, 
wash the cauliflower, and examine it thoroughly 
to see if there are any insects about it. Next lay 
it for an hour in a pan of cold water. Then put 
it into a pot of boiling milk and water that has 
had a little fresh butter melted in it. Whatever 
scum may float on the top of the water must be 
removed before the cauliflower goes in. Boil it 
seadily half an hour, or till it is quite tender. 
Thea take it out, dram it, and cut h into short

•prigs. Have ready three ounces of ri^h, but not 
strong cheese, grated fine. Put into a stew-pan 
a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, nearly half 
of the grated cheese, two large table-spoonfuls 
of cream or rich milk, and a very little salt and 
cayenne. Toss or shake it over the fire till it is 
well mixed and has come to a boil. Then add the 
tufts of cauliflower, and let the whole stew to- 
gether about five minutes. When done put it into 
a deep dish, strew over the top the remaining half 
of the grated cheese, and brown it with a sala- 
mander or a red-hot shovel held above the surface. 
This will be found very superior to real mac- 
caroni. It is a company dish.

BROCCOLI AND EGGS.-.Take several heads 
cf broccoli and cut the stalks short, paring off 
from the stalks the tough outside skin. Trim off 
the small outside shoots or blossoms, and tie them 
together in bunches. After all the broccoli has 
been washed, and lain half an hour or more iri' a 
pan of fresh cold water, put the large heads, with 
a salt-spoonful of salt, into a pot of boiling water, 
and let them boil till thoroughly done, and the 
stalk perfectly tender. When the large heads 
have boiled about a quarter of an hour, put in the 
small tufts, which of course require less time to 
cook. In the meanwhile have ready six beaten 
eggs. Put a quarter of a pound of butter into a 
sauce |)an, and stir it over the fire till it is all 
malted ; then add gradually the beaten eggs, aud

stir tnt; mixture, or shake it over fclie fire till it 
becomes very thick. Toast sufficient bread to 
cover efttirely the bottoin of a deep dish, cutting 
it t~ fit exactly, having removed the crust. Dip 
the toast for a minute in hot water. Pour the 
egg and butter over the hot toast. Then place 
upon it the broccoli ; the largest and finest head 
in the middle, the lesser ones round it, and having 
untied the small sprigs, lay them in a circle close 
to the edge. _ 

FEIED CELERY.— Take fine large celery, cut 
It into pieces three or four inches in length, and 
boil it tender, having seasoned the water with a 
very little salt. Then drain the pieces well, and 
lay them, separately, to cool on a large dish. 
Make a batter in the proportion of three well- 
beaten eggs stirred into a pint of rich milk, alter- 
nately with half a pint of grated bread-crumbs, 
or of sifted flour. Beat the batter very hard after 
it is all mixed. Put into a hot frying-pan a suffi- 
ciency of fresh lard ; melt it over the fire, and 
when it comes to a boil, dip each piece of celery 
twice into the batter, put them into the pan, and 
fry them a light brown. "When done, lay them to 
drain on an inverted sieve with a broad pan placed 
beneath it. Then dish the fried celery, and send 
it to table hot. 

Parsnips, and salsify, (or oyster plant) may bo 
fried in butter according to the above directions. 
Also the tops of asparagus cut off from the stalk, 
and ihe white part or blossom of cauliflower

FRIED ARTICHOKES.— The artichokes must 
be young and tender. Cut them into quarters, 
remove the choke part, and strip off the leaves 
Having washed the artichokes well and laid them 
an hour in cold water, put them into a pot of 
boiling water, and keep them boiling steadily for 
a long time, till you find by trying them with a 
a fork that they are tender all through. Then 
take them out immediately, and drain them. 
Have ready a sufficiency of batter, made in the 
proportion cf the yolk of one yigg to a large table* 
spoonful of milk, and a tea-spoonful of flour. 
The eggs must be well beaten before they are 
mixed with the milk ; then beat .in the flour a 
spoonful at a time. Have ready over the fire 
some fresh butter, or lard, in a frying-pan. When 
it has boiled hard, dip the artichokes into the 
butter, (each piece should be twice dipped,) and 
fry them brown. Then drain them well, and send 
them to table hot. 

Parsnips may be fried as above. Salsify also. 

Another way of frying artichokes, parsnips, 
and salsif}'', is, after they have been boiled tender, 
to dip each piece first in beaten yolk of egg^ 
(without milk or flour,) and then roll it in finely 
grated bread-crumbs. Th<)n put them into the 
pan and fry them in batter or lard, or a mixture 
of bctk. 



364 MISS LKSLIE^S NEW COOK BOOK 

In boiling artichokes, observe to take them ml 
as soon as they are tender. If they remain in thf 
water after they are done, they turn biackiat an(? 
lose their flavor.

MUSHROOM OMELET.— Take some fresh- 
gathered mushrooms ; remove the stalks, and ruL 
the flaps or heads very slightly with a little salt-, 
mixed with cayenne. Then stew the mushrooms* 
in a small sauce-pan, with barely sufficient crean? 
or rich milk to cover them. Put in with them t 
small onion; and if the onion is found to turr 
blackish, throw away the whole ; it being proof 
that there is among them a false or poisonous 
mushroom. Stir them with a silver spoon, and 
keep on the lid of the pan closely, unless when 
you are stirring. If the spoon turns black, the 
mushrooms should not be eaten. 

After they have come to a boil, take them off 
the fire ; drain them, and when cool, chop them 
small. To a pint or more of the minced mush- 
rccms, allow six or seven eggs. Beat the eggs 
till very light and thick, (omitting the whites of 
two,) and then mix in, gradually, the mushroom? 
stirring the whole very hard. Put three ounces 
of fresh butter into a hot omelet pan, or a small 
frying-pan ; place it over the fire, and stir the 
butter as it melts. When it has boiled hard, put 
in the omelet mixture, and as it fries, stir it till 
it begins to set. Do not turn the omelet; but 
brown the top by holding close above it a red-hot 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 365 

shovel. When done, AjaIh off the butter, fold 
over or double the omelet, und serve it up iiniae 
diately on a hot dish. 

In gathering mushrooMiaf, those that are fit to 
cat may be known by their being of a pale peail 
color, or of a grayish while, instead of what is 
called a dead white; and the underside of the flap 
or head (if good) is of a lir^ht pink, or a pinkish 
salmon color. The best mushrooms grow on up 
lands, or in high open fields where the air is pure 
and good, and they should be gathered early in 
the morning before the dew is off. All that ara 
found in low swampy ground, or in the woods, or 
under large trees, are poisonous.

SCOLLOPED TOM ATOS.— Take fine large 
tomatos, perfectly ripe. Scald them to loosen the 
skins, and then peel them. Cover the bottom of 
a deep dish thickly with grated bread-crumbs, 
adding a few bits of fresh butter. Then put in a 
layer of tomatos, seasoned slightly with a little 
salt and cayenne, and some powdered mace or 
nutmeg. Cover them with another layer of bread- 
crumbs and butter ; then another layer of seasoned 
tomatos; and proceed thus until the dish is full, 
finishing at the top with bread-crumbs. Set the 
dish into a moderate oven, and bake it near three 
hours. Tomatos require long cooking, otherwise 
fch(3y will iiave a raw taste, that to most persons is 
uuf Icasaut.

ASPARAGUS OMELET.— Take two bunches 
of the largest and finest asparagus. Put it into s 
pot of boiling water, with a salt-spoonful of salt, 
and boil it about twenty-five minutes, or till per- 
fectly tender. Then drain it, and chop small all 
the green part. Beat four eggs very light, and 
add to them a wine-glass of cream. Mix the 
chopped asparagus thoroughly with the egg and 
cream, adding a salt-spoon of salt, and a very 
little cayenne. Melt a large slice of fresh butter 
in a frying-pan over the fire ; and when it has 
boiled, and the bubbling has ceased, put in the 
mixture, and fry it till light and firm. Then slip 
it from the frying-pan to a hot dish, and fold it 
over. 

For a soft omelet, put the mixture into a skillet 
with a piece of fresh butter. Let it stew slowly 
for ten minutes. Lay a thin slice of buttered toast 
in the bottom of a hot dish, and cut the toast into 
small squares, but let them remain close together. 
With a spoon heap the soft omelet upon the toast, 
and serve it up. 

Any omelet mixture may be kept soft by stew- 
ing instead of frying it, and it will be found more 
wholesome. 

Before buttering the toast dip it a minute in hot 
water. 

STEWED PEAS.— Take young, tender, green 
peas, wash them, and put them into a stew-pan, 
with sufiicient fresh butter to keep them from 
burning, but no vjater. Season them with a little 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK: BOOK. 367 

black pepper, and a very little ealt. Set them 
over a moderate fire, and stir tliem about till 
the butter is well mixed through them. Let 
them simmer till quite soft and slightly broken ; 
take off the lid occasionally, and give them 
a stir up from the bottom. If you find them be- 
coming too dry, add some more butter. When 
done, drain off what superfluous butter may be 
about the peas, and send them to table hot. They 
will be found excellent. 

To the taste of many persons, they will be im- 
proved by a lump or two of loaf-sugar put in 
with the butter, and also by a few sprigs of mint, 
to be removed before the peas go to table. 

Lima beans may be stewed in butter, as above, 
also, asparagus tops, cut off from the white stalk. 



M>/\A^^<^w 



LETTUCE PEAS.— Having washed four let- 
tuces, and stripped off the outside leaves, take 
their hearts, and (having chopped them well) put 
them into a stew-pan with two quarts of jonncf 
green peas, freshly shelled ; a lump or two of loaf- 
sugar ; and three or four leaves of green mint 
minced as finely as possible. Then put in four 
slices of cold ham, and a quarter of a pound of 
butter divided into four bits, and rolled in 
floir; and two table-spoonfuls of water. Add a 
lilcle cayenne, and let the whole stew for about 
twenty- five minutes, or till the peas are thoroughly 
done. Next take out the ham, and add to the

five minutes longer. Then send it to table.

PLAIN LETTUCE PEAS.— Cover the bottom 
and sides of a stew-pan with large fresh leaves 
taken from lettuces. Have ready the peas, which 
should be young and green. To each quart of 
shelled peas allow two table- spoonfuls of fresh 
butter, and a lump of loaf sugar. Add a very 
little pepper and salt, and a sprig of green mint. 
Cover the pan closely, and let it stew for half an 
hour, or till the peas are thoroughly done. Then 
take them out from the lettuce leaves, and send 
only the peas to table.

TO STEW CARROTS.— Half-boil the carrots; 
then scrape them nicely, and cut them into thick 
slices. Put them into a stew-pan with as much 
milk as will barely cover them ; a very little salt 
and pepper; and a sprig or two of chopped pars- 
ley. Simmer them till they are perfectly tender. 
When nearly done, add a piece of fresh butter 
rolled in flour. Send them to table hot. Carrots 
require long cooking ; longer than any other ve- 
getable. 

Parsnips and salsify may be stewed in the 
above manner, substituting a little chopped cslerj 
fcr the parsley. 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK !'><X)K. 869 

SPINACH. — Having peeled and washed the 
Bpinach very nicely, put it into a bammaric^ or in- 
side kettle, without any water, and cover it 
closely. Pour the vrater into the outside kettle, 
and you may hurry the boiling by throwing a 
handful of salt in the outside tin, taking care that 
none of the salt gets into the inside. When the 
spinach is well stewed, take it up and drain it 
without squeezing or pressing, as that will make 
it tough and dry. Then chop it small, and add 
some hard-boiled eggs, also chopped. Season it 
with pepper and fresh butter, stir it well together, 
return it to the kettle, and iet it stew a quarter 
of an hour or more. Serve it up with buttered 
toast and poached eggs laid upon it. 

Spinach being very watery, should always be 
stewed rather than boiled. If you have no bain 
marie, tb'^^ water that remains about the spinach, 
after it has been washed, will suffice to stew it 

slowly. 

Spinach juice, for coloring green, must be 
strained, and boiled slightly. You can obtain 
plenty of juice by pounding the leaves.

TO PREPARE CUCUMBERS.— Let the cu 
cumbers be full-grown, but not in the least yellow 
or hard. They are then only fit to be saved for 
seed. Lay the cucumbers in a pan of cold water 
fcr an hour oi more, or till it is nearly time lo 
send them to table, being careful not to set them 
m the sun. Have ready another pan of fresh 



370 MISS LESLtB^S JitEW COOK BOOK. 

water, (very cold) and having pared the cucum- 
bers, slice them into it. Transfer them to a deep 
china or white- ware dish. Season them with vi- 
negar, pepper, salt, and a little salad oil, taking 
care not to use too much salt. When there is no 
dislike to onione, peel and slice a few that are 
mild, and mix them with the cucumbers. It ia 
usual now, at the best tables, to have the onions 
in a small separate dish, (sliced with vinegar and 
pepper) to be eaten by those that like them, and 
omitted by those who do not. Onions, (and also 
salad oil) are said to render cucumbers more 
wholesome. 

Tomatos (raw) are frequently sliced, seasoned, 
and sent to table in the manner of cucumbers. 
Tomatos are always wholesome. 



STEWED CUCUMBERS.— Pare six fine fresh 
cucumbers. Cut each of them lengthways into 
four pieces ; lay them for an hour in a pan of cold 
water. Take a clean stew-pan, and place in 
its bottom two table-spoonfuls of good fresh 
butter. Then put in the slices of cucumber, and 
sprinkle them slightly with a very little pepper. 
Add two table-spoonfuls of cold water. Set the 
pan over a moderate fire, and let the cucumbers 
stew slowly for half an hour or more, till they are 
well cooked. Keep the pan closely covered, ex- 
cept when you have to remove the lid to stir the 
stew. Serve them up hot, at breakfast, or as a 
iide dish, at dinner. 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 871 

Persons who have no objection to the taste of 
onions, will think the cucumbers improved by 
the addition of the half of a moderate sized 
onion, sliced thin and stewed with them.

A NICE WAY OF COOKING ASPARA- 
GUS. — Where asparagus is plenty, there is no 
better way of cooking it than the following. 
Take it as nearly of a size as possible, wash it, 
and cut ofi' the stalks very short, leaving them not 
more than half an inch in length. Two quarts of 
water will be sufficient to boil one quart of aspa- 
ragus tops; allow a tea-spoonful of salt to this 
quantity of water, and set it over the fire to boil. 
When the water is boiling hard, put in the aspa- 
ragus, and boil it fast for at l^ast half an hour 
To see if it is done, take up two or three of the 
largest pieces and taste them. While it is boil- 
ing, prepare two slices of bread cut half an inch 
thick, and (having removed the crust) toast the 
bread brown on both sides. Have ready a large 
jill of melted (or drawn) fresh butter. When the 
asparagus is done, take it up with a perforated 
skimmer, and lay it on a sieve to drain. Dip the 
slices of toast (one at a time) first in the hot aspa- 
ragus liquor, and then in the melted butter. Lay 
the slices, side by side, in a deep dish, and cover 
it with the asparagus, laid evenly over and round 
the toast. Then add the remainder of the drawn 
butter, and send the asparagus to table bot, in s 
covered dish. 



372 MISS Leslie's new cogk book. 

This is a much nicer way than that of boiling 
and serving it up with the long stalks left on. 
And where you have asparagus in abundance, (for 
instance in a country garden,) it may always be 
cooked in this manner. 

This is from the receipt ol Mr. N. Darling, of 
New Havsn. 

ASPARAGUS OYSTERS.— Take two bun- 
dies of fine full-grown asparagus. Cut off the 
grecii tops or points as far down as the white 
stalk. Take a sufficient quantity of fresh oysters, 
the ftnest you can get at that season. Put the 
asparagus tops into a stew-pan, with enough of oys- 
ter liquor (previously strained) to stew them quite 
tender. Stew the oysters themselves in another 
pan with some more of their liquor, seasoned with 
pepper, mace, and nutmeg, adding a large piece 
of fresh butter, divided into four, and each part 
rolled in flour. Do not let the oysters stew more 
than five minutes, or they will become tough and 
shriveled. When they are merely plumped, take 
them out and cut them up small, omitting the 
gristle or hard part. Set the mixture over the 
fire for about five minutes, stirring all the time. 
Have ready some slices of nice toast, with all the 
crust pared off; the slices dipped for a minute in 
hot water. Butter the toast, and cover with it 
the bottom of a deep dish, and fill it with th^ 
mixture of asparagus and oysters.

OKTON EGGS.— Boil a dozen eggs quite hard. 
Slice and fry in fresh butter five or six onions. 
Slice (whites and yolks together) ten of the eggs, 
reserving two for the seasoning. Drain the sliced 
onions, and lay them on a dish with the sliced 
sggs placed upon them. Cover the dish, and keep 
it hot. Take the two remaining eggs, grate the 
yolks, and mix them with cream and grated nut- 
meg, and a very little cayenne. Put this mixture 
into a very small sauce-pan, give it one boil up, 
pour it over the eggs and onions, and send it to 
table hot. For those who have no objection to 
-anions this is a nice side dish.

EGG BALLS.— Boil eight eggs till quite hard, 
and when done, throw them directly into cold 
water. Then put the yolks into a mortar, and 
pound them to a paste, moistening them as you 
proceed with the beaten yolks of three raw eggs, 
seasoned with as much salt as will lie flat upon a 
shilling, and a little cayenne, and powdered nut- 
meg and mace. Mix the whole well together, and 
make it up into small round balls. Throw them 
into mock-turtle soup, or into stewed terrapm, 
about two minutes before you take it up.

CUllRY BALLS.— Take a sufficiency of finely- 
grated bread-crumbs; hard-boiled yolk of egg, 
grated; fresh butter, and a little curry pov/der 
Pi'und the whole in a mortar, moistening it with

raw yolk of egg (well-beaten) as you proceed 
Make it into small balls, and add them to stewed 
chicken or rabbit, about five minutes before yott 
take it up. 

TOMATO PASTE.— Scald and peel as many 
ripe tomatos as will fill a large, deep, stone jar. 
Set them into a warm oven for an hour. Then 
skim off the watery liquid that has risen to the 
top, and press and squeeze the tomatos in a sieve. 
Afterwards add salt, cayenne, pounded mace, and 
powdered nutmeg, to your taste; and to every 
quart of tomatos allow a half a pint of cider vi- 
negar. Stew the whole slowly in a porcelain 
kettle for three hours, (stirring it frequently from 
the bottom,) till it becomes a smooth, thick paste. 
Then put it into small jars or glasses, and cover 
it closely, pasting paper over each. It is an ex- 
cellent sauce, at the season when fresh tomatos are 
not to be had, and is very good to thicken soup.

DKIED OCHKAS. — Take fine large fresh 
ochras ; cut them into thin, round slices ; string 
them on threads, and hang them up in festoons to 
dry in the store-room. Before using, they must 
be soaked in water during twenty-four hours 
They will thcL be good (with the addition of tc«- 
caato paste) to boil in soup or gumlx>. 



Misff Leslie's NEW COOK booi:. 875 

BEEF GUMBO.— Put into a large stew-pan 
SfLie pieces of the lean of fresh beef cut up into 
small bits, and seasoned with a little pepper and 
sa^t. Add sliced ochras and tomatos, (either 
fresh or dried ochras and tomato paste.) You 
may put in some sliced onions. Pour on water 
enough to cover it well. Let it boil slowly, (skim- 
ming it well,) till every thing is reduced to rags. 
Then strain and press it through a cullender. 
Have ready a sufficiency of toasted bread, cut 
into dice. Lay it in the bottom of a tureen, and 
pour the strained gumbo upon it. 



■~^»^vA#^^>< 



TO BOIL OCHEAS.-^For boiling, the ochras 
should be young and small. Wash them, and cut 
off a small piece from each end. Boil them till 
very tender throughout. Then drain them well, 
and transfer them to a deep dish. Lay among 
them some bits of fresh butter, and season them 
with pepper. Cover the dish, that the butter may 
be warm and melt the sooner. Or you may make 
a sauce of half a pint of milk boiled, and when 
it has come to a boil enrich with a quarter of a 
t>ound of very good fresh butter, divided into 
four pieces ; each piece rolled in a little flour, the 
butter stirred in gradually and smoothly, as soon 
as the milk is taken off the fire Pour this sauce 
over the dish of ochrac. and keep it covered till it 
has gone to table. 

We prefer the first way, putting the bit of but- 
ter cold into the hot ochras, with either milk or

fiour, and letting tlie butter melt gradually, in 
the manner of green beans. You may boil with 
tbem a small piece of very good b.icon, removing 
when the ochras are taken ofT ihe fire. Seasco 
v^ith pepper. 

ONIOT^S. — Tlie best onions for cooking aro 
the white or silver-skinned. The red-skinned are 
generally strong and coarse. Shalots are very 
small and delicate. Some sorts of large onions 
arc milder and nicer than those of middle size, 
ami some that are very small have a powerful 
taste and smell. The outer skin of most onions 
shouhl be peeled entirely, and the ends cut off. 
All onions are the better for boiling, before tliey 
are cooked for any other purpose. Put them into a 
stew-pan with cold water, and when they have come 
to a boil pour off that water, and rei)]ace it with 
fresh cold also. Boil ihera slowly till quite tender 
all through, whicli will not be in less than half 
an hour; more, if they are large. When done, 
drain them well, dish them, and pour over them 
some nice melted butter. 

To Stew Omorts. — Peel, slice them, and stew 
them in milk, enriched with butter rolled in flour, 
and seasoned with a Jitiie cayenne and a few 
bUdes of mace. 

Tc Roast Onions. — Select fiae large onions; di 
not j^eel them, but place them in a bake-pan, and 
flet them in an oven. Bake them sh»vvlv till tenitei 
all through. When done, peel off the outer akiu,

and send them hot to table, to eat with pepper 
and cold butter. 

Tliey are very good when covered up and 
roasted under hot ashes, taking care that they arp 
done quite through to the heart.

TO BOIL GREEN TEAS.- When the peas 
are shelled, wash them in a pan of cold water. 
Pat on the peas in cold water, (a little salted) and 
let them boil vQvy fost. If nice peas, they will 
generally be done in a quarter of -^n hour after 
beginning to boil. When simmering, add to 
them a lump or a spoonful of loaf-sugar, and a 
sprig of fresh green mint, (half a dozen leaves) 
having first ascertained if mint is not disliked by 
any person who is to eat of the peas. To some 
the taste and odor of mint is w^ry ao-reeable to 
others very disgusting, as is the case with onions, 
and many other things that are liked by the ma- 
jority. 

When the peas are all soft or tender, take out 
the mint, drain the peas through a cullender till 
not a drop of water is left among them ; transfer 
them to a deep dish, mix into them some of the 
best fresh butter, and sprinkle them with pepper. 
Cover them immediately, and send them to table 
hot. 

STEWED PEAS. — Having prepared tUe peai 
fts above, put them into a stew-pan without anj 
water. Mix among them plenty of bits of nic* 



S7S MISS xeslte's new coot: Booit. 

fresh butter, sufficient to cook them. Let them 
stew slowly in the butter till they are quite soft, 
stirring them up from the bottom frequently. 
Drain and dish them. They will be found very 
Cne — better than if boiled in water. Peas should 
not be stewed this way, except in places where 
plenty of good frzsh butter is to be easily ob- 
tained. 

GREEN PEAS.— The largest and finest peas 
are what the English call marrowfat. The sugar 
pea is next. All green peas for boiling should be 
young and tender, but not so young as to be taste- 
less or insipid. As a general rule, nearly every 
article of food is best when it has just attained 
its full growth and ripeness ; after that period the 
older it is the worse. Peas, so old as to be hard 
and yellow, are unfit to eat. In some ultra eco- 
nomical houses, good peas are things unknown. 
They are not bought in spring or early summer 
while young and fresh, but are never thought 
cheap enough till they become hard and yellow. 
Afterwards, when they reach the cheap state, a 
quantity are bought low, and put into jars not to 
be touched till next spring, when they are boiled, 
(with great difficult}'', for they never become soft.) 
and atlem'pted to be passed off "as this year's fresh 
peas" — and by the time the ftimily have gotten 
through with Uiem^ "this year's young peas" have 
become old. Do not believe (for it is untrue,) that 
any eatable can be kept in «ZZ its genuine fresh- 
ness and original flavor, by merely secluding them 



MISS lesIiIe's^^ new cook book. ^79 

entirely from air. They will not spoil or decom- 
pose if skillfully managed ; but they have not ex- 
actly their natural taste and consistence. It is 
better for those who never make pickles or preserves^ 
to wait for fresh vegetables or fruit, till they are 
actually in markets — or, if put up in jars, to add 
something more than parboiling and seclusion 
from the air. Vinegar, salt, sugar, spice and al- 
cohol, will be found the grand and universal arti- 
cles for securing the goodness of nearly all eat- 
ables. Without some of these along with them, 
things that have not spoiled while secluded from 
air, will surely spoil almost as soon as the jars are 
opened, and the external air admitted to them. 



GREEN OR STRING BEANS.— Take young 
and tender beans, the seeds just forming in the 
pods. Take off the string with a knife, leaving 
no bits of string adhering to the beans, either at 
top or bottom. Do not split them. Cut each 
bean into three pieces, not more, and as you cut 
them throw them into a pan of cold water, kept 
beside you for the purpose. The old-fashioned 
way is now obsolete of cutting them into dice or 
diamonds, or of splitting them. The more they 
are cut up (beside the trouble and time wasted,) 
the more the water gets through them when cook- 
ing ; tht more tasteless they become, and the more 
difficult they are to drain. We have never met 
with beans that, when cut smalls had not a puddle 
of greasy water iu the bottom of the dish, and 



880 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

sometimes the water was all through the dish, and 
the beans floa , ng in it. Shame on such bean-cook- 
mg ! When the beans are all ready lor the pot, 
throw them into boiling water very slightly salted, 
and they will generally be done in half an hour 
after they have come to a boil. Transfer them to 
a sieve; and press, and drain them well, till no 
water is left about them. Then put them into a 
deep dish, mix them with fresh butter, and dredge 
them with black pepper. 



»*^^#^^^^w**«« 



LIMA BEANS.— Shell the lima beans into t. 
pan of cold water. Let them lie in it an hour. Put 
them in boiling water, little more than enough to 
cover them, and boil them till soft and tender. 
When done, drain and serve them up in a deep 
dish, adding among them a good piece of butter. 
The Lima beans now raised in North America 
have become coarse and white, requiring a re- 
newal of fresh stock or new seeds from Peru. 
They will then be greei and delicate again, as 
formerly. 

SWEET POTATOS.— Choose the sweet pota- 
tos large, and nearly of the same size, then you 
can either boil or roast them. When small they 
should always be boiled; as, when baked oi 
roasted, the skin becomes so thick and hard, thai 
it takes up nearly the whole potato. Wash them 
very clean, and cut off a bit from each end. Put 
iLQm into a large pot of boiling water without 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 381 

salt, and boil thein «tcadily for at least an hour. 
Piobe them with a narrow-bbded sharp knife, 
and if it doen not easily penetrate all through the 
largest potfiVj; (in at one side and out at the other) 
eontin-ae the boiUiig till all are soft throughout. 
Then take theni up, peel them, and keep their, 
warm till sent to table. 

To Bake Sweet Potatos they should all be large 
Wash them, dry them, and cut off the enda. 
Then bake them in an oven, lying side by side, 
not piling one on another. Or else (which is better) 
roast them in hot ashes. They will not be done 
in less than an hour and a half, perhaps longer. 
Then wipe them clean, and serve them up in the 
skins. Eat them from the skins, with cold butter 
and a tea-spoon. 

To Stew Sweet Potatos. — Wash and wipe them. 
Then scrape off the skins with a sharp knife. 
Split them, and cut them into long pieces. Stew 
them with fresh pork, veal, or beef; first putting 
at the bottom a very little butter or water to start 
them, and then the gravy of the meat will sufSce 
for cooking them — skimming it well. Water to 
stew should be hot. 

Mashed Sweet Potatos are very nice. When well 
boiled, mash them smoothly with a potato beetle. 
Mix them with fresh butter, and then stir them 
well, or beat them, with a large wooden speon to 
rendt^r them light. Afterwards, you may make 
them into round thick cukes, and touch the sur- 
face of every one with pepper — red or black

BOILED TUKNIPS.— Have all your tarnipa 
nearly of the same size. Faro thom ; auci if larg^ 
cut them in half. Put tlicm into boil3ng water, 
very slightly salted, and kcop them cjoscly co- 
vered. Twenty minutes -will boil them if very 
small and young ; their flavor is then very fi ne. 
Afterwards, according to their size, they will re- 
quire of gentle boiling, from three-quarters to a 
full hour. Keep them boiling till, on trying them 
with a fork, you find them perfectly tender all 
through. Then take them up, drain them well, and 
pour melted butter over them ; touch the top of 
each with a spot of black pepper. If very old 
and spongy, they are only fit for the pig barrel. 
It is said that if boiled in their skins, (though re- 
quiring a much longer time to cook well) they 
have a fine flavor, and are less watery. You can 
try it. 

If the turnips are to be mashed, cut them into 
small pieces, boil them very soft, and drain and 
squeeze them till all the Avater is pressed out 
Then mash them very smooth. Transfer them to 
a deep dish, and mix them with a moderate j^oriion 
of fresh butter. Turnips are generally served 
with too much butter. Season them with pepper. 
When sent to table take care not to sei them in a 
sunny place, as it will give them a bad taste. 

Turnips, baked in an oven, are very good-— foi 
a change. 

SYDNEY SMITH'S SALAD-DRESSING.— 
Eave readv two well-boiled potatos, peeled and

rcbbcd througli a sieve; they will give j)eculiai 
Binootliness to tlie mixture. Also, a very small 
portion of raw onion, not more tlian a quarter of a 
tea spoonful, (as the presence of the onion is to be 
scarcely hinted,) and the pounded yolks of two 
hard-boiled eggs. Mix these ingredients on a deep 
plate with one tea-spoonful of salt, one of made 
mustard, three table-spoonfuls of olive oil, and 
one table-spoonful of vinegar. Add, lastly, a tea- 
spoonful of essence of anchovy; mash, and mix 
the whole together, (using a boxwood spoon) and 
see that all the articles are thoroughly amalga- 
mated. Having cut up a sufficiency of lettuce; 
that has been well washed in cold water, and 
drained, add to it the dressing immediately before 
dinner, mixing the lettuce through it with a box- 
wood fork. 

This salad dressing was invented by the Rev. 
Sydney Smith, whose genius as a writer and a wit 
is well known on both sides the Atlantic. If ex- 
actly followed, it will be found very fine on trial : 
no peculiar flavor predominating, but excellent as 
a whole. The above directions are taken from a 
manuscript receipt given by Mr. Smith to an Ame- 
rican gentleman then in London. 

In preparing this, or any other salad-dressing, 
take care not to use that excessively pungent and 
ileleterious combination of drugs which is now so 
(requently imposed upon the public,^ as the best 
white ivine vinegar. In reality, it has no vinous 
material about it ; and it may be known by its vio- 
Ujut and <iisagreeable sharpness, which overpowerg 



384 MISS Leslie's NEW cook book 

and defctroys the taste (and also the substance) of 
whatever it is mixed with. It is also very unwhole- 
some. Its color is alw-ays pale, and it is nearly aa 
clear as water. No one should buy or use it; 
TLkj first quality of real cider vinegar is ^ood for 
all purposes. 

The above receipt may be tried for lobster 
dressing. 

A Spanish proverb says, that for compounding 
a good salad, four persons are required — a spend- 
tbrift for oil; a miser for vinegar; a man of judg- 
ment for salt; and a madman for stirring the 
dressing.

FINE CHICKEN SALAD.— Having skinned 
a pair of cold fowls, remove the fat, and carve 
them as if for eating; cut all the flesh entirely from 
the bones, and either mince it or divide it into 
bmall shreds. Mix with it a little smoked tongue 
or cold ham, grated rather than chopped. Have 
ready one or two fine fresh lettuces, picked, wnshed, 
drained, and cut small. Put the cut lettuce on a 
dish, (spreading it evenly,) or into a large bowl, 
and place upon it the minced chicken in a close 
heap in the centre. For the dressing, mix together 
the following ingredients, in the proportion of the 
yolks of fo ar eggs well beaten, a tea-spoonful of 
powdered white sugar, a salt-spoon of cayenne; 
(do salt if you have ham or tongue with the 
chicken,) two tea-spoonfuls of made mustard, six 
table- spoonfuls of salad oil, and five of celejy vi- 
negar. Stir this mixture well : put it into a small 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 385 

sjmce-pan, set it over the fire, aad let it boil three 
minutes, (not more,) stirring it all the time. Fhec 
set it to cool. When quite cold, cover with it 
thickly, the heap of chicken in the centre of the 
ealad. To ornament it, have ready half a dozen 
or more, hard-boiled eggs, which, after the shell is 
peeled off, must be thrown directly into a pan of 
cold water to prevent them from turning blue. 
Cut each egg (white and yolk together) lengthways 
into four long pieces of equal size and shape ; lay 
the pieces upon the salad all round the heap of 
chicken, and close to it ; placing them so as to fol- 
low each other round in a slanting direction, some- 
thing in the form of a circular wreath of leaves. 
Have ready, also, some very red cold beet, cut 
into small cones or points all of equal size ; ar- 
range them in a circle upon the lettuce, outside of 
the circle of cut egg. To be decorated in this 
manner, the salad should be placed in a dish rather 
than a bowl. In helping it, give each person a 
portion of every thing, and they will mix them 
together on their plates. 

This salad should be prepared immediately be- 
fore dinner or supper ; as standing long will injure 
it. The colder it is the better. 



CAEKOTS. — Having washed the carrots, md 
rfcraped off the outer skin with a sharp knife, or 
taken off a very thin paring, split them a few 
inches down, leaving a long cleft in the apper half 
only, and put them on to cook in plenty of boiling 



386 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

water, with a little salt in it. There is no table 
vegetable that needs more boiling than a carrot. 
Small young carrots require at least half an hoar. 
If large, they must boil from one to two houis, ac- 
cording to their size. When you find them tender 
throughout, dish them, with melted butter poured 
round them. They are eaten plain, only with boiled 
beef or boiled mutton. They are often added to 
soups and stews, when they must be put in long 
before the other vegetables. For soups and stews 
the nicest way is to grate them (before boiling,) on 
a coaise grater. This way they improve both tha 
taste and color. 

0?:rcts are very nice, sliced thin after boiling, 
put into a sauce-pan, with bits of butter dredged 
with flour, seasoned with pepper, and stewed soft 
without any water. 



**** ^ ^^*^**—^ 



PAKSNIPS. — Scrape the parsnips, and split 
them half way down. Put them into boiling 
water with a little salt. Parsnips require less 
boiling than carrots ; and, according to their size, 
will take from half an hour to an hour. Skim 
the water while they are boiling. When quite 
tender take them up, drain them, dish them, and 
pour melted butter over them. They are espe- 
cially eaten with corned pork, or salted cod ; but 
are good with various things. They are excel 
lent stewed with fresh beef, or fresh pork, for a 
plain dinner. 

Fried Parsnips make a nic3 brcakfaat d\sb

Bilked Parsnips. — Split and parboil them. Then 
place them in a large dish. Lay among them 
some bits of fresh butter, and bake them brown 
Eat them with any sort of roast meat. 

Parsnip Fntters. — Boil and peel half a dozen 
large parsnips, and then split and cut them in 
pieces. Make a nice butter, allowing four beaten 
eggs to a pint of milk, and four table-spoonfuls 
of fiour. nave ready over the fire, a frying-pan 
with boiling lard. Put in a large spoonful of 
batter; upon that a piece of parsnip, and cover 
it with another spoonful of batter. Proceed thus 
till you have used up the parsnips. When done, 
drain them from the lard, and serve them hot at 
breakfast or dinner. 



ff^^'^'^^^^t^m ^ 



BEETS. — Beets must be washed very clean, but 
not scraped, trimmed, or cut till after they are 
boiled. Put them on in boiling water; and, ac- 
cording to their size, boil them steadily from ono 
hour and a half, to two hours and a half, but they 
must not be probed (to ascertain if they are ten- 
der all through,) but pinched with the fingers, 
1'hen peel off the skins, and trim them ne:?tly. 
Hold the beet in a pan of cold water while you 
p?sl it. Do it quickly. Serve them up either 
split or sliced, with melted butter poured over 
theiid, and seasoned with pepper. Or else they 



SS3 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

may be sliced thiclr, (allov/ing them to get cold,) 
and spiced vinegar poured overrhem. Red boeta 
are usually dressed with vinegar; the white ol 
pale ones with melted butter. 

Baked Beets have a finer flavor, and are moro 
nutritious than when boiled. Wash and wi[»e 
them dry, but do not skin or cut them till after 
cooking. They must be thoroughly done before 
they are taken out of the oven, and then pared 
and trimmed. According to their size they will 
require from four to six hours baking. Their, 
blood-red color makes them ornamental to the 
table; but when cooked in soups or stews they add 
little to the taste, which is overpowered by that 
of other ingredients.

SQUASHES OR CYMLINGS.--See that the 
squashes are not turning old, and hardening. 
Wash them, and cut them into four pieces each; 
but do not split them. Put them on in boiling 
water, with a little salt. Boil them steadily till 
quite tender throughout. Then take them up, 
and mash or drain them through a cullender, 
pressing them with a broad short-handled wooden 
ladle. Ml the water (of which there will be a 
profusion,) must be entirely squeezed out Servo

good. It is better to mash squashes, turnip\ 
pumpkins, &c., without any butter, than to use 
that which is salt and bad. The flat white ones 
are the test summer squashes; the stiiped green 
are more w^atery; the cashaw, or yellow winter 
squash, is best of all, and grows well in the Vevt 
England states, from whence, as it keeps well all 
winter, it is often brought in barrels. Every fa- 
mily should get a barrel of winter squashes from 
Boston. They do not thrive in the middle States. 
In New Jersey and Pennsylvania, they cannot be 
raised oven from the best yankee seed, turning 
. pnmpkinish the next year, and afterwards becom- 
ing quite pumpkins, and very bad ones too. Bat 
when raised in their native soil and climate noth- 
ing of the squash kind is equal to them. They 
are very dry and sweet, and of a rich yellow color. 
Take them out of the barrel, and keep them f?.r 
tipart on the shelves or floor of a dry pantry.

STEWED PUMPKIK— No pumpkin is toj 
;arge to be good, but they may be too old. Cut 
a good deep-colored pumpkin in half, and empty 
out all the seeds, &c. Then cut it into pieces, and 
pare them. Put the pieces of pumpkin into a pot 
with barelv sufficient water to keep them (icra 
burning. "When they are thoroughly done or soli.

them through a cullender. They must be very

with black pepper, and eat it with boiled conr(vl 
beef, or corned pork, or bacon. 

Stewed pumpkin is chiefly used for pies and 
Duddings. 

YANKEE PUMPKIN PUDDING. — Take a 
pint of stewed pumpkin. Mix together a piXit of 
West India molasses and a pint of milk, ad ung 
two large table-spoonfuls of brown sugar, and two 
table-spoonfuls of ground ginger. Beat three eggs 
very light, and stir them, gradualh^ into the milk 
and molasses. Then, by degrees, stir in the stewed 
pumpkin. Put it into a deep dish, and bake it 
without a crust. This is a good farm-house pud- 
ding, and equalhj good for any healthy children. 

For a large family, double the quantities of in- 
gredients — that is, take a quart of milk, a quart 
of molasses, four spoonfuls of brown sugar, four 
spoonfuls of ginger, six eggs, and a quart of 
Slewed pumpkin. 

You had best have at hand move than a quart 
of pumpkin, lest when mixed it should not hold 
out. This pudding is excellent ma?de of winter 
squash.

soning. 

BAKED MUSHROOMS. — Take large £ne 
fresh mushrooms. Peel them and remove the 
stems. Lay them on their backs in a large dish, 
^TK5t letting them touch each other) and put into 
each mushroom, (as in a cup) a bit of the best 
fresh butter. Set the dish in an oven and bake 
them. Send them to table in the saino dish; or 
transfer them to another, with a large toast at the 
bottom. There is no better way of cooking mush- 
rooms than this. 

If you cannot procure good butter, cook them 
in nice olive oil.

TO BOIL INDIAN COKN.— Corn for boil- 
lug should be full grown, but young and tender, 
and the grains soft and milky. If its grains are 
bee j?.ning hard and yellow, it is too old for cook- 
ing. Strip the ears of their leaves and the silk. 
Put them into a large pot of boiling water, and 
boll it rather fast for half an hour or more, in 
proporti(xi to its size and age. When done, take 
U up, dra:n it, dish it under a cover, or napkin.

and serve it up hot. Before eating it, rub each 
car with salt and pepper, and then spread it with 
butter. Epicures in corn consider it sweetest 
when eaten off the cob. And so it is ; but lefort 
ompany few persons like to hold an ear of indian 
corn in their hands, and bite the grains off the 
cob with their teeth. Therefore, it is more fre* 
quently cut off the cob into a dish ; mixed with 
salt, pepper, and butter, and helped with a spoon. 

It is said that young green corn will boil saiS 
ciently in ten minutes, (putting it, of course^ into 5 
pot of boiling w^ater.) Try it. 

Anoihf'/i- toay. — Uaving pulled off the silk, boil 
the corn without removing any but the outside 
leaves. With the leaves or husk on, it will re- 
quire a ioiiger time to cook, but is sweeter and 
more nutritious.

nOMIXY. — Hominy is white indian corn, 
shelled from the cob, divested of the outer skin 
by scalding in hot lye, and then winnowed and 
dried. It is perfectly white. Having washed it 
through two or three waters, pour boiling water 
on it; cover it, and let it soak all night, or for se- 
veral hours. Tfien put it into a pot or sauce- pan, 
allow two quarts of water to each quart of ho- 
miny, and boil it till perfectly soft. Then drain 
it, put it into a deep dish, add some butter to it, 
and send it to table hot. (a.nd uncovered^) to eat

CAROLINA GRITS OS SM.^XL HOMINY. 
- — The small-grained hominy must be washed and 
boiled in the same manner as the large, only allow 
ralher less water for boiling. For instance, put a 
pini and a half of water to a quart of small ho- 
niriy. Drain it well, sei.d it to table in a deep 
dish without a cover^ and eat it with butter and 
sugar, or molasses. If covered after boiling, the 
vapor will condense within the lid, and make the 
hominy thin and watery. 



SAMP. — This is Indian corn skinned, and then 
f)Ounded or ground till it is still smaller and finer 
than the Carolina grits. It must be cooked and 
used in the same mt^nner. It is very nice eaten 
with cream and sugar. 

For invalids it may be made thin, and eaten as 
gruel. 

HOMINY CAKES.— A pint of small hominy, 
or Carolina grits ; a pint of white Indian meal, 
sifted; a salt-spoonful of salt, three large table- 
spoonfuls of fresh butter ; three eggs or three 
table-spoonfuls of strong yeast; a quart of milk 
Having washed the small hominy, and left it 
soaking all night, boil it soft, drain it, and

the salt, and the butter. Then mix it gradually 
with the milk, aad se* it away to cool. Beat 
the eggs very light, and add them gradually 
to the mixture. The whole should make a thick 
batter. Then bake them on a griddle, in the 
manner of buckwheat cakes, rubbing or scraping 
the griddle always before you put on a fresh cake 
Trim off their edges nicely, and send them to 
table hot. Eat them with butter. 

Or you may bake them in muffin rings. 

If you prefer making these cakes with yeast; 
you must begin them earlier, as they will require 
time to rise. The yeast should be strong and 
fresh. If not very strong, use four table-spoonfuls 
instead of two. Cover the pan, set it in a warm 
place; and do not begin to bake till it is well 
risen, and the surface of the mixture is covered 
with bubbles. 

CORN PORRIDGE.— 1'ake young corn, and 
cut the grains from the cob. Measure it, and \o 
each heaping pint of corn allow not quite a quart 
of milk. Put the corn and milk into a pot, stir 
them well together, and boil them till the corn is 
perfectly soft. Then add some bits of fresh butter 
dredged with flour, and let it boil five minutes 
longer. Stir in at the last, four beaten yolks of eggs, 
and in three minutes remove it from the fire 
Take up the porridge and send it to table hot, 
and stir some fresh butter into it. You may add 
sxigar and nutmeg. 



MTSS LESIilE's NEW COOK BOOK. 803^ 

GOEN OYSTERS.— Three dozen ears of large- 
young Indian oorn, six eggs; lard and butter in 
equal portions for frying. The corn must be 
young and soft. Grate it from the cob as fine as 
possible, and dredge it with wheat flour. Beat 
very light the six eggs, and mix them gradually 
with the corn. Then let the whole be well incor- 
porated by hard beating. Add a salt-spoon of 
salt. 

Have ready, in a frying pan, a sufficient quan 
tity of lard and fresh butter mixed together. Set 
it over the fire till it is boiling hot, and then put 
in portions of the corn mixture, so as to form 
oval cakes about three inches long, and nearly an 
inch thick. Fry them bro^n, and send them to 
table liot. In taste they will be found to have » 
singular resemblance to fried oysters, and are uni- 
versally liked if properly done. They make nice 
side-dishes at dinner, and are very good at break- 
fast. 

SUMMER SACCATASn.— String a quarter 
of a peck of young green beans, and cut each 
Dean into three pieces, (not more,) and do not split 
them. Have by you a pan of cold water, and 
throw the beans ' into it as you. cut them. Have 
ready over the fire a pot or saucepan of boiling 
water ; put in the beans, and boil them hard near 
twenty minutes. Afterwards take them up, and 
drain them well through a callendcr. Take half 
a dozen ears of young but fall-grown indian corn, 
(of eight or ulue if they ara not ail large) and cut

the grains down from the cob. Mix together the 
corn and the beans, adding a very small tea-spoon- 
ful of salt, and boil them about twenty minutes 
Then take up the saccatash, drain it well through 
a sieve, put it into a deep dish, and while hot mix 
in a large piece of butter, (at least the size of an 
egg,) add some pepper, and send it to table. It 
is generally eaten with salted or smoked meat. 

Fresh Lima beans are excellent cooked in this 
manner, with green corn. They must be boiled 
for half an hour or more, before they are cooked 
with the corn. 

Dried beans and dried corn will do very well 
for saccatash, but they must be soaked all night 
before boiling. The water poured on them for 
soaking should be hot. 



WINTER SACCATASH.— This is made of 
dried shelled beans and hard corn, soaked over 
night in separate pans, and boiling water poured 
over them in the morning, after pouring oi3f the 
first water. Then boil both together till they are 
quite soft. Drain them dry in a sieve, put them 
into a deep dish, and mix in a large piece of but- 
ter, seasoned with pepper. This is a good accom- 
paniment to corned pork or beef The meat must 
be boiled in a separate pot.

OAROLmA WAY OF BOILING RICE.- 
Pick the rice carefully, and wash it through two 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 397 

or three cold waters till it is quite clean. Then 
(having drained off all the water through a cul 
lender,) put the rice into a pot of boiling water, 
with a very Kttle salt, allowing as much as a quart 
of water to h<ilf a pint of rice. Boil it twenty 
niinutes or mor3. Then pour off the water, draining 
the rice as dry as possible. Lastly, set it on hot 
coals with tlie lid off, that the steam may not con- 
dense upon it and render the rice watery. Keep 
it drying thus for a quarter of an hour. Put it 
into a deep dish, and loosen and toss vi up trom 
the bottom with two forks^ one in each band, so 
that the grains may appear to stand alone.

TO^rATOS.— Tomatos require long cooking; 
otherwise they will have a raw taste, and be quite 
too acid. Take fine tomatos that are quite ripe, 
put them into a pan, and scald tliem in very hot 
water. Let them remain for ten minutes, or till 
you can peel them without scalding your hands. 
Drain tlioni through a sieve. You may either 
press out all the seeds, (retaining only the pulp 
or liquid,) or leave the seeds in, squeezing the to 
matos sligiitly. Put them into a stew-pan, which 
must on no account be of copper, as the acid of 
the tomatos will render it poisonous. We knew 
a lady who died in agonies from eating tomatos 
cooked in a copper vessel that had the tinning 
partly worn off. If the tin inside is indispensable 
(which it is) why have any copper about it? A 
veasel of douhla block tin only, will last as long 



59-S MISS Leslie's n!J!W cook boos. 

and stand the fire as well as if there was coppcf 
inside. For all stews, an iron pan, lined with 
delft (or what is called porcelain or enamel) is 
excellent, Bes^ of all for stewing vomatos, and 
many other things, is a lain maris^ or double ket- 
tle, with the water outside, in the outer kettle. 

Having nearly filled the stew-^an with the to- 
matps, (cut up, if they are large) add a little salt 
and pepper, a piece cf fresh butter dredged with 
flour, and (if approved) a very little chopped 
cnion. If jou have ready-boiled onions at hand, 
take one or two of them and mince it fine. Add 
to the tomatos some powdered white sugar to 
lessen the excessive acid. Put but very few 
bread-crumbs — if too many, they will weaken the 
taste. Tomatos are an improvement to every 
kind of plain soups, and may be added, with ad- 
vantage, after the soup is in the tureen. The 
cooking of tomatos should be commenced at least 
three hours before dinner. Put no water with 
them — their own juice is sufficient. 

Many persons like tomatos raw, sliced like cu- 
cumbers, and seasoned with vinegar and pepper.

TO KEEP TOMATO PULR—Having boi:od 
them till entirely dissolved, ^lidding a little salt 
and pepper) press and strain them through a 
sieve, pour the liquor into pint or half-pint bot- 
tles, (which must be perfectly «lean) and staud 
the bottles up in a large iron pot or oven, with a 
layer of straw in the bottom. Fill up the pel

you take them out, put a spoonful of salad oil at 
tho top of each bottle ; seal the bottles wi:»a rosin 
cement. This pulp will be good for tomato pur- 
poses till next summer, if kept in a cool dry 
place. "When you open a bottle use it fc^t, ur 
cork it again immediately.

BROILED TOMATOS.— Take the very largest 
and ripest tomatos. Wash, but do not scald or 
peel them. Cut the tomatos half apart on four 
sides, extract the seeds, and fill each tomato with a 
nice forcemeat of stuffing, made of bread-crumbs, 
butter, minced veal or pork, mace, nutmeg, and 
sweet marjoram. Ilaving stewed this stuffing in 
a sauce-pan, (moistening it with tomato juice, or 
gravy) fill all the tomatos with it, opening them 
out a little like the leaves of a tu'ip. Butter 
slightly a heated gridiron, and broil them on it. 
Or, they may be baked in an oven. 

This is a dish for company, either at dinner or 
breakfast. 

BUTTON TOMATOS.-— These are the very 
Bmallcst tomatos, and are excellent for pickling 
and preserving. If quite ripe, and free from ble- 
mishes, they will keep very well in cold vinegar, 
and are the easiest done of all pickles. Theie are 
two sorts of button tomatos, the red and the yel-

low, both equally good. Wipe every tomato 
clean and dry, and put them into small glass jara 
thai have a cover. Fill the jars two- thirds v.Ith 
the tomatos, and then fill up to the top with the 
best cider vinegar. On the top put a table-spoon- 
ful of salad oil, and cover them closely. They 
require nothing to secure their keeping well. But 
the taste will be improved, by putting in with 
them, three very small thin muslin bags, each con- 
taining mace, nutmeg, and ginger, broken small, 
but not powdered. Lay one bag of spice at the 
bottom of the jar; one about the middle, and one 
near the top. If done without spice, they are the 
cheapest of all pickles. Do not put them into 
soups or stews ; but eat them cold with meat, like 
other pickles. 

If kegs of these tomatos were carried to sea. 
and liberally served out to the crew, the scurvy 
would be less frequent, even on long voyages. 

Large whole tomatos would do for this purpose. 
^ e wish it were the universal custom in ships to 
Lake out with them plenty of tomatos kept in this 
way in vinegar. Tomato catchup is now much 
used for the army — so it should be for the navy 
not only for the sick, but for the well ; to keep 
them well

HINTS ON EEATING OVENS AND BAK- 
IK G.— Brick ovens are generally heated with dry 
fa/;old or small branches, or with light split wood. 
Fjr baking bread, the oven-wood must be heaviev 
ihan for pies. A heap of wood should be placec? 
m the centre of the oven on the brick floor, and 
then set on fire. While the wood is burning, the 
door of the oven must be left open. When the 
wuod is all burnt down, and reduced to a mass 
of small red coals, the oven will be very hot. 
Then shovel out all the coals and sweep the oven 
floor with a broom, till it is perfectly clean, and 
entirely ^tqg from ashes. Try the heat within 
For baking bread, the floor of the oven should 
look red, and a little flour thrown in should burn 
brown immediately. If you can hold your hand 
within tlie mouth of the oven as long as you can 
distinctly count twenty, the heat is about right, 
ries, puddings, &c., require less heat. When a 
brick oven is used, a peel, or large broad-bladei 
long-handled wooden shovel is necessary for put- 
ting in the bread, pies, &c., placing them on the 
broad or shovel-end of the peel, and slipping 
them off on the oven floor. Then close up the 
door of the oven, and leave the things to bake. 
When done, slip the peel beneath them, and hand 
there out on it. 

To bake in an Iron Dutch oven, (a large deep, 
last-ixv^n pan, with a handle, a close-fitting lid, and

ctanding on three or four feet,) you mnst first 
stand the lid upright before a clear fire to Heat 
the inside, and it will be best if the oven itself 
is also stood up before the fire for the same pur- 
pose. This should be done while the article to be 
baked is preparing, that it may be put in, as soon 
as it is ready. The oven may be suspended to the 
crane, and hung over the fire, or it may be set on 
a bed of hot wood coala in the corner of the 
hearth. As soon as the loaf or pie is in, put on 
the lid of the oven, and cover it all over with 
hot coals, replenishing it with more live coals as 
the baking proceeds. If you find it too hot on 
the top, deaden it with ashes. If the oven stands 
on the hearth, keep up the heat at the bottom, by 
additional live coals placed beneath it. Whether 
the oven is hung over the fire, or stood on thei 
hearth, there must always be hot couis all qvqi? 
the lid, the hottest near the edge. 

To bake on a griddle, you may either hang it 
over the fire, or set it over hot coals on the hearth. 
Most griddles have feet. The fire must be quitQ 
clear and bright, and free from smoke, or the- 
cakes will be blackened, and have a disagreeable 
taste. The griddle must be perfectly olcan; and 
while you are baking, it will require frequent 
scraping, with a broad knife. If it is well scraped 
after every cake is taken off. it will not want 
greasing, as there will be no stickiness. Other- 
wise, some butter tied up in a clean rag and laid 
on a saucer, must be kept at hand all the time, to 
?ub over the griddle between the baking of e.ac/i

dak'e; for butter, lard, or nice beef or veal drip- 
ping may be substituted, but it will not be 60 fine. 
Never grease with mutton fat, as it will comnm- 
nicate the taste of tallow. A bit of the fat of 
fresh pork may do, (stuck on a fork,) but salt pork 
will give the outside of the cakes a disagreeable 
sultness, and therefore should not be used. 

A griddle may be placed in the oven of a hot 
stove. Some close stoves have a hole in the top 
with a flat lid or cover, which lid can be used as 
a griddle. 

The tin-reflecting ovens (with shelves for the 
pies and cakes) that are used for baking in the 
summer, and that, having a furnace beneath, and 
a chimney-pipe, can be set out of doors, so that 
the kitchen may not be kept hot, are very good 
for things that will bake soon, and that do not 
require what is called a strong, solid heat. But 
they are not effective unless the inside is kept 
very bright; otherwise it will not reflect the heat. 
The tin ovens should (as well as tin roasters) be 
cleaned thoroughly and scoured bright with sand 
every time they are used. 

The art of baking with anthracite, (or any other 
mineral coal,) can only be acquired by practice 
The above hints on baking, refer exclusively to 
wood fires. 

When a charcoal furnace is used for baking 
stewing, or any sort of cooking, it should either 
be set out in the open air, or the door of the 
kitchen must be kept open all the time. The

DRIED CORN MEAL YEAST CAKES.— 
Half a pound of fresh hops, four quarts of water, 
a pint of wheat or rye flour, half a pint of strong 
fresh yeast from the brewer or baker, three pints 
or more of Indian meal. Boil half a pound of 
fresh hops in four quarts of water, till the liquid 
is reduced to two quarts. Strain it into a pan, 
and mix in sufficient wheat flour to make a thin 
batter, adding half a pint of the best yeast you 
can procure. Leave it to ferment ; and when the 
fermentation is over, stir in sufficient Indian meal 
to make a moderately stiff dough. Cover it, and 
set in a warm place to rise. When it has become 
very light, roll it out into a square sheet an inch 
thick, and cut it into flat cakes, about four inches 
square. Spread them out separately, on a large 
dish, and let them dry slowly in a cool place 
where there is no sun. While drying, turn them 
five or six times a day. When they are quite dry 
and hard, put them, separately, into brown paper 
bags, and keep them in a box closely covered, 
and in a place not the least damp. 

When you want them to use for yeast, dissolve 
in a little warm water one or more of the cakes, 
in proportion to the quantity of bread you intend 
making. When It is quite dissolved, stir it hard 
thicken it with a little wheat flour, cover it, and 
place it near the fire to rise, before you use it 



MISS LESLIE'S N'E W COOK BOOK. ' 405 

Then mix it with the flour, according to the usual 
manner of making bread. One yeast cake is 
enon.2;h for two q^iiarts of meal or flour. 

This way r.f pre<5erving yeast is very convenient 
foi keeping thr:n:gh tlie summer, or for convey 
ing to a distance.

EXCELLENT HOME-MADE YEAST.— Yjust 
should always be kept in a glass bottle or a stone 
iuo-, and never in earthen or metal. Before you 
make fresh yeast, empty entirely the vessel that has 
coniiiiined the lucst ; and if of stone, scald it twice 
with boiling water, in which it will be well to mix 
a littV. clear lye. Then rince it with cold water, 
till perfectly clean. If you have not used lye in 
scalding it, dissolve some potash or pearlash in 
the rinsing water, to remove any acidity that may 
linger about the vessel, and may therefore spoil 
tlie new yeast. If you keep your yeast in glass 
bottles, the water must be warm, but not hot ; as 
scalding water may crack them : also, melt some 
potash or pearlash in this water. The vessel for 
keeping it being piirified, procee 1 to make your 
yeast. Have ready, in a kettle over the fire, two 
quarts of boiling water; put into it a very large 
handful of hops, (as fine and fresh as possible,) 
and let the water boil again with the hops in it 
for twenty minutes more. Sift into a pan thiee 
pints of wheat flour. Strain the liquor from tha 
hops into a large bowl, and pour half of it hot 
over the flour. Stir it well, and press out all the

lumps till it is quite smooth. Let the other half 
of the liquid stand till it is cool, and then pour it 
gradually to the rest; mixing it well, l*'y stir- 
ring as you proceed. Then tfik-B half a pini of 
good strong yeast — brewer's or baker's yeast, if 
you can get it fresh ; if not, you must use some 
that has been left from, y^'iur last making, prv 
vided it is not the least sour; stir this yeast into 
the mixture of hop water &nd flour, put it imme- 
diately into your jug or bottles, and cork it 
loosely till the fermentation ii? over, (which should 
be in an hour,) and it will then be ft for use. 
Afterwards cork it tightly. It will keep better 
if you put a raisin or two into the bottom of each 
bottle, before you pour in the fresh yeast. Into a 
istone Jug put half a dozen raisins. 

All yeast is better and more powerful for being 
fresh. It is better to m.ake it frequently, (the 
trouble being little,) than to risk its becoming 
sour by endeavoring to keep it too long. When 
sour it becomes weak aod watery, and tastes and 
smells disagreeably, and will never make light 
bread ; besides, being very unwholesome. The 
acidity may be somewhat corrected by .stirring in 
some dissolved pearlash, saleratus, or soda, imme- 
diately before the yeast is used ; but it is better 
lo have it good and fresh, without the necessity 
of any corrective. Yeast should always be kept 
in a cool place.

eries have no occasion to make their own yeasj

can every day supply themselves witli fresli yeast 
from tlie baker's. It is only in country places 
where there are neither brewers or bakers that it 
is expedient to make it at home. For home-mad© 
yeast, we know the above receipt to be excellent. 
Sweet cakes, buns, rusks, &c., require stronger 
and fresher yeast than bread; the sugar will other- 
wise retard their rising.

INDIAN BREAD OR PONE.—Four quarts 

of indian meal sifted, a large half pint of wheat 

flour, a table-spoonful of salt, half a pint of strong 

fresh yeast, a quart of warm water. Sift into a 

large deep pan the indian meal and the wheat 

flour, mixing them well. Make a hole in the 

centre. The water must be warm, but not hot. 

Mix it with the yeast, and pour them into the 

bole in the midst of the meal. Take a spoon, and 

with it mix into the liquid enough of the sur- 

rounding meal to make a thin batter, which you 

must stir till it is quite smooth, and free from 

lumps. Then strew a handful of wheat flour over 

the surface, scattering it thinly, so as to cover the 

wliole. Warm a clean cloth, and lay it folded 

over the top of the pan. Then set it in a warm 

place to rise, nearer the fire in winter than in

sufficient lakewarrn water (which you must have 
ready for the purpose,) to mix it of the proper 
consistence. When the whole is completely 
mixed, and the batter in the centre is thoroughly 
incorporated with the dough, knead it hard for at 
least half an hour. Then, having formed the 
dough into a round lu-mp in the middle of the 
pan, strew a little more flour thinly over it. 
Cover it, and set it again in a warm place for half 
an hour. Then flour your pasteboard, divide the 
dough equally, and make it into two loaves. 
Have the oven ready. Put in the loaves directly 
and bake them about two hours or more. Indiait 
meal requires always more baking than wheat 
When you take them out, it is well to wrap each 
loaf in a clean, coarse towel, well sprinkled with 
cold water, and rolled up damp till the bread 
is baked. Having thus wrapped up the loaves, 
stand them on end to cool slowly. The damp 
cloths will prevent the crust from hardening too 
much while the loaves are cooling. 

All Indian bread, and every sort of Indian cake, 
is best when quite fresh. 

Excellent bread may be made of equal propor- 
tions of wheat, rye flour, and indian corn; or of 
three parts wheat and one part indian. All bread 
should be kept closely secluded from the air, 
wrapped in clotlis, and put away in box^'s or bas* 
kctii with tightly-fitting lids. 

Should you find the dough sour, (either from 
ihe heat of the weather, or from standi ig i ")

lukewarm water a tea -spoonful of pearlasn, sal- 
eratus, or soda. Sprinkle this water all over the 
dough. Then knead it m, so that it may be dis- 
persed throughout. Then put it into the oven slc 
soon as possible; first tasting the dough, to dis- 
cover if the sourness is entirely removed. If not, 
mix in a little more pearlash, and then taste it 
again. Take care not to put in too much of any 
of these alkaline substances, lest they communi- 
cate a disagreeable, soapy taste to the bread. 

When you buy corn meal, it will keep better 
if the whole is sifted as soon as you get it. 
Avoid buying much at a time, unless you can 
keep it in a very cool place. Wheu sour, it is un- 
fit to eat. Common Indian meal is much tne best 
for use. 

INDIAN RYE BEEAD.— Two quarts of in- 
dian meal, two quarts of rye meal, three pints of 
milk or water, two tea-gpoonfuls of salt, half a 
pint of strong fresh yeast. Having sifted the rye 
and Indian meal in a larre pan, mix them well 
together, adding the salt. Boil the milk or water 
in a sauce-pan, and when pcalding hot pour it 
on the meal, and stir the whole very hard. If 
too stifi', add a little more ws^vm water. Let it 
stand till it becomes only of a lukewarm heat, 
and then stir in the yeast. Kne?<d the mixture 
into a stiff dough, and knead it long and hard 
for at least half an hour. Then cover the pan 
rHh a thick cloth that has been pr^«^iously 
warmed, and set it near the fire to rise. \V hep

the dough is quite light, and cracked all over the 
top, take it out of the pan ; divide the mass in 
half, make it into two loaves, knead each loaf well 
for ten minutes or more, and then cover and set 
them again near the fire for about half an hour. 
By this time have the oven ready, put iu the 
loaves directly, and bake them at least an hour 
and a half. This bread is considered YGvy whole- 
some. 

Should you find the dough sour, you may rec- 
tify it by kneading in a tea-spoonful of soda or 
pearlash, dissolved in a little warm water.

INDIAN WnEAT BREAD.— This is made 
in the above manner, substituting wheat for rye 
flour. 

In any sort of home-made bread, (either white 
or brown) a handful or more of Indian meal will 
be found an improvement, rendering it moist and 
sweet. 



BOSTON EYE AND INDIAN BREAD.— 
Two quarts of indian meal, two quarts of rye 
meal, half a pint of strong fresh yeast, half a pint 
of West India molasses, a small table-spoonful of 
salt. Sift the rye and indian meal into a large 
pan or wooden bowl ; and mix them well together, 
adding a little salt. Have ready half a pint of 
water, warm but not hot. Mix with it the mo- 
lasses, and then stir into it the yeast. Make a 
hole in the middle of the pan of meal, pour in 



m^^ LlStifU'S iflW eoof BOOK. 411 

the liquid, and then with a spoon work into it a 
portion of the flour that surrounds the hole, till 
the liquid in the centre becomes a thick batter. 
Sprinkle the top with rye meal, lay a thick clctn 
over the pan, and set it in a warm place to rise. 
In three or four hours it should be light 3nough 
to appear cracked all over the surface. Then 
pour into the middle (by degrees) about a pin«t of 
warm water, (it must not be hot,) and as you pour 
mix it well all through the dough, till the whole 
becomes a round mass. Sprinkle some rye flour 
on the dough, and having floured your hands, 
knead it long and hard, (at least half an hour, 
and after it ceases to stick to your hands,) turning 
it over as 3?^ou proceed. Then sprinkle the dough 
again with flour, cover it, and again set it in a 
warm place to rise. Iliive the oven ready, and 
of the proper heat, so that the bread may be put 
in as soon as it has completely risen the second 
time. When perfectly liglit, the dough will stand 
high, and the surface will be cracked all over. 
This quantity will be sufficient for a common-sized 
loaf. Set it directly into the oven, and bake i\ 
about two hours. When bread has done rising, 
it will fall again if not put into the oven. As 
soon as it is done, wrap it immediately in a clean 
coarse towel wet with cold water, and stand it up 
on end till it is cool. 

This is a palatable, cheap, and wholesome bread. 
ft may be baked in a deep tin or iron pan.

become sour, (which it will, if mixed over night,)

EGG- PONE. — Three eggs, a quart of indiau 
meal, a large table-spoonful of fresh butter, a 
small tea-spoonful of salt, a half pint (or moie) 
of milk. Beat the eggs very light, and mix them 
with the milk. Then stir in, gradually, the In- 
dian meal, adding the salt and butter. It must, 
not be a batter, but a soft dough, just thick 
enough to be stirred well with a spoon. If too 
thin, add more Indian meal ; if too stiff, thin it 
with a little more milk. Beat or stir it long and 
hard. Butter a tin or iron pan. Put the mixture 
into it, and set the pan immediately into an oven, 
which must be moderately hot at first, and the 
heat increased afterward. A Dutch oven is best 
for this purpose. It should bake an hour and a 
half or two hours, in proportion to its thickness. 
Send it to table hot, and cut into slices. Eat it 
with butter, or molasses.

INDIAN MUSn. — Have ready on a clear fire 
a pot of boiling water. Stir into it, by degrees, 
(a handful at a time,) sufficient indian meal to make 
a very thick porridge, and then add a very small 
portion of salt, allowing not more than a level tea- 
spoonful to a quart of meal. You must keep the 
pot boiling all the time you are stirring in the meal 
and between every handful stir hard with tha

raush-stick, (a round stick about half a yard long, 
flattened at the lower end,) as, if not well stirred, 
the mush will be lumpy. After it is suificieatly 
thick and smooth, keep it boiling an hour longer, 
stirring it occasionally. Then cover the pot 
closely, and hang it higher up the chimney, or set 
it on hot coals on the hearth, so as to simmer it 
slowly for another hour. The <3roodness and whole- 
someness of mush depends greatly on its being 
long and thoroughly boiled. It should also be 
made very thick. If well made, and well cooked, 
it is wholesome and nutritious ; but the contrary, 
if thin, and not sufficiently boiled. It is not too 
long to have it three or four hours over the fire, 
first boiling, then simmering. On the contrary, it 
will be better for it. The coarser the corn meal 
the less cooking it requires. Send it to table hot, 
and in a deep dish. Eat it with sweet milk, but- 
termilk, or cream, or with butter and sugar, or 
with butter and molasses; making a hole in the 
middle of your plate of mush, putting some but- 
ter into the hole, and then adding the sugar or 
molasses. 

Cold mush that has been left may be cut into 
slices, or mouth fuls, and fried next day, in butter, 
or in nice dripping of veal, beef, or pork; but 
U3t mutton or lamb.

INDIAN MEAL GBUEL.— This is an excel- 
lent food for the sick. Ilaving sifted some indian 
meal, mix in a quart bowl three table-spoonfuls 
of the meal with six of cold water. Stir it 
smooth, and press out the lumps against the side 
of the bowl. Ilave ready a very clean sauce-pan, 
entirely free from grease, with a pint of boiling 
water. Pour this, scalding hot, on the mixture in 
the bowl, a little at a time, and stir it well, add- 
ing a pinch of salt. Then put the whole back 
into the sauce-pan. Set it on hot coals and stir 
it till it boils, making the spoon go down to the 
bottom to prevent the gruel from burning. After 
it has come to a boil, let it continue boiling half 
an hour, stirring it frequently, and skimming 
it. Give it to the invalid warm, in a bowl or 
tumbler, to be eaten with a tea-spoon. It may be 
sweetened with a little sugar. When the p.hyai 
cian permits, some grated nutmeg may be addud , 
also, a very little wine

RYE MUSTI. — To make smooth rye mush, sift 
a quart or more of rye meal into a pan, aad gra- 
dual!/ pour in sufficient cold water to make a 
very thick batter, stirring it hard with a spoon as 
you proceed, and carefully pressing out all the 
lumps against the side of the pan. Add a very 
little salt. The batter must be so thick at the 
last that you can scarcely stir it. Then thin it 
with a little more water, and see that it is quite 
smooth. Rye, and also wheat flour, have a dispo- 
sition to be more lumpy than corn meal, when 
made into mush. When thoroughly mixed and 
stirred, put it into a pot, place it over the fire and 
boil it well, stirring it with a mush-stick till it 
comes to a hard boil; then place it in a dimin- 
ished heat, and simmer it slowly till you want to 
dish it up. Eat it warm, with butter and mo- 
lasses, or with sweet milk, or fresh buttermilk. 
Rye mush is considered very wholesome, particu- 
lary in cases of dyspepsia.

COMMON nOE-CAKE.— Take an oartheu or 
tin pan, and half fill it with coarse Indian meal, 
which had best be sifted in. Add a little salt. 
Have ready a kettle of boiling water. Pour into 
the Indian meal sufficient hot water (a little at a 
time,) to make 'a stiff dough, stirring it with a 
spoon as you proceed. It must be thoroughly 
mixed, and stirred hard. If you want the cakes 
for breakfast, mix this dough over night ; cover 
ihe pau, and set it in a cool place till morning. 



416 MISS LESLIE S NEW COOK BOOK. 

If kept warm, it may turn sour. Early next 
morning, as soon as the fire is burning well, set 
the griddle over it, and take out the dough, a 
handful at a time. Flatten and shape it by pat- 
tinj/ it with your hands, till you form it into 
cak.es about the size of a common saucer, and 
half an inch thick. When the griddle is quite 
hot, lay on it as many cakes as it will hold, and 
bake them brown. When the upper side is done, 
slip a broad knife beneath and turn them over. 
They must be baKed brown on both sides. Eat 
them warm, with buttermilk, sweet milk, butter, 
molasses, or whatever is most convenient. If 
you intend these cakes for dinner or supper, mix 
them as early in the day as you can, and (cover- 
ing the pan) let them stand in a cool place till 
wanted for baking. In cold weather you may 
save trouble by mixing over night enough to last 
the next day for breakfast, dinner, and supper; 
baking them as they are wanted for each meal. 
Or they may be all baked in the morning, and 
eaten cold ; but they are then not so palatable as 
when warm. They will be less liable to stick, if 
before each baking the griddle is dredged with 
wheat flour, or greased with a bit of fat pork 
stuck on a fork. You may cover it all over with 
one large cake, instead of several small ones. 

This cake is so called, because in some parts 
of America it was customary to bake it on the 
iron of a hoe, stood up before the fire. It is bolter 
kiiow:i by that name than by any other.

COMMON GRIDDLE CAKE.— A quart of in- 
dian meal, sufficient warm water to make a soft 
dough, a small tea-spoonful of salt. Put the In- 
dian meal into a pan, and add the salt. Make a 
hole in the centre of the meal, and pour in a little 
warm water. Then mix it with a large, strong 
spoon, adding, by degrees, water enough to make 
a soft dough. Flour your hands, and knead it 
into a large lump — divide it into two equal por- 
tions. Flour your pasteboard, lay on it the first 
lump of dough, and roll it out about an inch thick. 
Then, (having already heated your griddle,) lay 
the cake upon it, spreading it evenly, and make it 
a good round shape. It should cover the whole 
surface of the griddle, which must first be greased, 
either with butter or lard tied in a rag, or with a 
bit of fat fresh pork. Bake it well ; and when 
one side is well browned, turn it on the other, 
taking care not to break it. Send it to table hot, 
cut into three-cornered pieces — split and butter 
them. As soon as the first cake is sent in, put 
on the other to bake. 

This is one of the plainest and simplest prepa- 
rations of indian cake ; and is very good when 
warm.

it very hard for a quarter of an hour or more, till 
it becomes light and spongy. Then spread the 
dough, smooth and evenly, on a stout, flat board. 
A piece of the head of a flour barrel will serve 
for this purpose. Place the board ncr;/iy (but not 
quite^, upright, and set a smoothing-iron or a stono 
against the back to support it. Bake it well. 
When done, cut it into squares, and send it hot

lasses with it 

YEEY PLAIN INDIAN DUMPLINGS.— 
Sift some indian meal into a pan ; add about a 
Bait-spoon of salt to each quart of meal, and scald 
it with sufficient boiling water to make a stiif 
dough. Pour in the water gradually, stirring as 
you pour. AVhen the dough becomes a stiff lump 
divide it into equal portions; flour your hands, 
and make it into thick flat dumplings, about as large 
round as the top of a glass tumbler, or a break- 
fast cup. Dredge the dumplings on all sides with 
flour, put them into a pot of boiling water, (if 
made sufficiently stiff they need not be tied in 
cloths,) and keep them boiling hard till thoroughly 
done. Try them with a fork, which must como 
out quite clean, and with no clamminess sticking 
to it. They are an excellent appendage to salt 
pork or bacon, serving them up with the meat; 
ur they may be eaten afterwards with butter and 
molasses, or with milk sweetened well with browa 
EUgar, and flavored with a little ground cinnamon 
On no account boil them with meat.

INDIAN MUFFINS.— A pint and a Lalf of 
yellow Indian meal, sifted; a handful of wheat 
flour; a quarter of a pound of fresh butter; a 
quart of milk ; four eggs; a very small tea-spoon- 
ful of salt. Put the milk into a sauce-pan. Cut 
the butter into it. Set it over the fire and warm 
it till the butter is \evy soft, but not till it melts. 
Then take it off, stir it well till all mixed, and set it 
away to cool. Beat four eggs very light, and when 
the milk is cold, stir tliem into it alternately with 
the meal, a little at a time, of each. Add the salt. 
Beat the whole wery hard after it is all mixed. 
Then butter some mufHa-rings on the inside. Set 
them in a hot oven, or on a heated griddle ; pour 
some of the batter into each, and bake the muf- 
fins well. Send them hot to table, continuing to 
bake while a fresh supply is wanted. Pull them 
open with your fingers, and eat them with butter, 
to which you may add molasses or honey. These 
muffins will be found excellent, and can be pre- 
pared in a very short time ; for instance, in threo 
quarters or half an hour before breakfast or tea. 

This mixture may be baked in waffle irons, a? 
waffles. Butter them, and have on the table a 
glass bowl with powdered sugar and powdered 
cinnamon, to eat with these waffles.

tities of yellow indian meal and well boiled rice. 
Mix them together in a pan, the meal and rice al- 
ternately, a little at a time of each. The boiled 
rice may be either hot or cold; but it wiU be 
rather best to mix it hot. Having first mixed it 
with a spoon, knead it well with your hands; 
moistening it with a little milk or water, if you 
find it too stiff. Ilave ready, over the fire, a heated 
griddle. Grease it with fresh butter tied in a clean

portions of indian meal, and stewed pumpkin iliat 
Itas been well mashed and drained very dry in a 
sieve or cullender. Put the stewed pumpkin in a 
pan, and stir the meal gradually into it, a spoonful 
at a time, adding a little butter as you proceed. 
Mix the whole thoroughly, stirring it very hard. If 
not thick enough to form a stiff dough, add a little 
more indian meal. Make it into round, flat cakes, 
about the size of a muffin, and bake them over 
the fire on a hot griddle greased with butter. Or 
lay them in a square iron pan, and bake them in

ful of salt ; a small half pint or a large handful of 
indian meal ; two large table-spoonfuls of strong 
fresh brewer's yeast or four table-spoonfals of 
home-made yeast; sufficient lukewarm water to 
make a moderate batter. Mix together the buck- 
wheat and indian meal, and add the salt. Make 
a hole in the centre of the meal, and pour in the 
yeast. Then stir in gradually, from a kettle, suf- 
ficient tepid or lukewarm water to make a mcde- 
r^'tely thick batter when united with the veasfc 



422 MISS Leslie's NEW cook book. 

Cover the pan, set it in a warm place, and leave it 
to rise. It should be light in about three hours. 
When it has risen high, and is covered with bub- 
bles, it is fit to bake. Have ready a clean griddle 
well heated over the fire. Grease it well with a 
bit of frcih butter tijed in a clean white rag, and 
kept on a saucer near you. Then dip out a large 
ladleful of the batter, and bake it on the griddle; 
turning it when brown, with the cake-turner, and 
baking it brown on the other side. Grease the 
griddle slightly between baking each cake, or 
scrape it smooth with a broad knife. As fast aa 
you bake the cakes, lay them, several in a pile, on 
a hot plate. Butter them, and if of large size cut 
them across into four pieces. Or send them to 
table to be buttered there. Trim off the edges 
before thev ffo in. 

If your batter has been mixed over night, and 
is found sour in the morning, dissolve a salt-spoon 
of pearlash or saleratus in a little lukewarm water, 
Btir it into the batter, let it stand a quarter of an 
hour, and then bake it. The alkali will remove 
the acidity, and increase the lightness of the batter. 
If you use soda for this purpose it will require a 
tea-spoonful. 

If the batter is kept at night in so cold a place 
as to fi-eeze^ it will be unfit for use. Do not grease 
the griddle with meat-fat of any sort.

a salt-spoon of salt; having warmed the milk, beat 
the eggs very light, and stir them gradually int<> 
it, alternately with the rye meal, adding the salt. 
Pat in the meal, a handful at a time, till you have 
the batter about as thick as for buckwheat cakes. 
Then stir in the yeast, and give the batter a hard 
boating, seeing tliat it is smooth and free from 
lumps. Cover the pan, and set it in a warm place 
to iMse. When risen high, and covered with bub- 
bles, the batter is fit to bake. ITave ready over 
the fire a hot griddle, and bake the cakes in the 
manner of buckwheat. Send them to table hot, 
and eat them with butter, molasses, or honey. 

Yeast powders, used according to the directions 
that accompany them, and put in at the last, just 
before baking, are an improvement to the light- 
ness of all batter cakes, provided that real yeast or 
eggs are also in the mixture. But it is not well to 
depend on the powders exclusively ; particularly 
when real yeast is to be had. The lightness pro- 
duced by yeast powders alone, is not the right 
sort; and though the cakes are eatable, they are 
too totigh and leathery to be wholesome. As aux- 
iliaries to genuine yeast, and to beaten eggs, yeast 
[)()wders are excellent. But not as the sole depen- 
dence.

INWAK CUP CAKES.— A pint and a \M

a pint and a half of 5ourmilk; (buttermilk is best;) 
a small tea-spoonful of saleratus or soda dissolved 
in warm water ; two eggs ; a level tea-spoonful of 
Bait. Sift the Indian and wheat meal into a pan 
and mix them well, adding the salt. If you have 
no buttermilk or other sour milk at hand, turn 
some sweet milk sour hj setting a pan of it in the 
sun, or stirring in a spoonful of vinegar. Take 
out a small tea-cupful of the sour milk, and re- 
serve it to be put in at the last. Beat the eggs 
very light, and then stir them, gradually, into the 
milk, alternately Vv^th the meal, a little at a time 
of each. Lastly, dissolve the soda or saleratus, 
and stir it into th'e cup of sour milk that has been 
reserved for the purpose. It will eftervesce; stir 
it while foaming into the mixture, which should be 
a thick batter. Ilave ready some tea-cups, or little 
deep tins. Butter them well; nearly fill them 
with the batter, and set them immediately into a 
rather brisk oven. The cakes must be thoroughly 
baked all through. When done, turn them out 
on large plates, and send them hot to the breakfast 
or tea-table. Split them into three pieces, and eat 
lliem with butter. 

The soda will entirely remove the acidity ;f tlie 
milK, which will eftervesce the better for being 
sour at first, adding therefore to the liglitness of 
the cake. Taste the milk, and if you find that the 
slightest sourness remains, add a little more dia 
solved soda. 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK!. 425 

All the alkalies, pearlash, saleratus, soda, and 
sal-volatile, will remove acidity, and increase light- 
ness; but if too much is used, they will impart a 
disagreeable taste. It is useless to put lemon or 
orange juice into any mixture that is afterwards 
to have one of these alkalies, as they will entirely 
destroy the flavor of the fruit.

CAKOLINA KICE CAKES.— Having picked 
and washed half a pint of rice, boil it by itself till 
the grains lose all form, and are dissolved into a 
thick mass or jelly. While warm, mix into it a 
large lump of the best fresh butter, and a salt- 
spoonful of salt. Pour into a bowl a moderate 
sized tea-cupful of ground rice flour, and add to it 
as much milk as will make a tolerably stiff batter. 
Stir it till it is quite smooth, and free from lumps. 
Then mix it thoroughly with the boiled rice. 
Beat six eggs as light as possible, and stir them, 
gradually, into the mixture. Bake it on a griddle, 
in cakes about as large round as a saucer. Eat

meg, for those who like it.

cakes, (far better than patty-pans,) and are made 
by any tinsmith. Grease the pans with the same 
batter you have used in mixing the cakes. Fill 
the parts to the top with the above mixture, that 
the heat may immediately catch the surface, and 
cause it to puff up high above the edges of the 
pan. If properly mixed, and well beaten, there 
is no danger of it running over. If only half 
filled, and not very light, the mixture when bak- 
ing will sink down, and become heavy and tough.

well baked ; not scorched on the top, and raw at 
the bottom. 

We recommend them highly as the perfection 
of corn cakes, if well made, well baked, and with j 
all the ingredients of the best quality. 

Use yellow Indian meal in preference to white. 
The yellow is sweeter, has more of the true corn 
taste, and its color shows at once what it is. The 
white has less flavor, and may be mistaken for 
very coarse wheat. It is difficult to keep corn 
meal good for the whole year. Before the new 
corn meal is in market, the old is apt to become 
musty. If you live in a city it is best to buy it 
as you want it ; a few pecks at a time. If in the 
country, sift your barrel of corn meal soon after 
it is brought; divide it, and keep it in several 
different vessels, always well covered.

SHORT CAKE.— As this requires no rising, it 
may be mixed and prepared at half an hour*s notice. 
Take a quart and a pint of wheat flour, sift it into 
a pan, and divide into three parts three (quarters of 
a pound of nice fresh butter. Cut up one pie3o 
into the pan of flour, and mix it into a dough 
with a broad knife, adding, as you proceed, as 
little water as will be barely sufficient. The 
water must be very cold. Roll out this lump of 
paste, dredge it slightly with flour, fold it up, and 



428 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

roll it out again. Then cover it with a second 
division of the butter, put -on the sheet of paste 
with the knife, and dispersed at equal distances. 
Sprinkle it with flour, fold it, and roll out the 
sheet again. Put on the remainder of the butter 
as before, in bits equally dispersed. Fold, dredgv3, 
and roll out the dough into a rather thin sheet. 
Cut it into small round cakes with the edge of a 
tumbler, or something like it, using up the clip- 
pings of paste left at the last to make one more 
cake. Have ready a hot griddle or oven. Put on 
the cakes so as not to touch each other, and bake 
them light brown on both sides. Send them to 
table hot, to be split and buttered. Mix and roll 
out these cakes as fast as possible, and avoid 
handling them more than you need. Paste made 
slowly is never light or flakey. Mix quick and 
roll quick. This is a good plain paste for fruit 
pot-pies or dumplings. 

You may make common short cake for very 
healthy people, with two quarts of flour, a quar- 
ter of a pound of fresh butter, and a quarter of a 
pound of lard, mixed into the pan of meal with 
a very little cold water, and a second quarter of 
lard spread all over the sheet of paste, after roll- 
ing it out. Fold, sprinkle, and roll it out again 
into one round griddle cake, or two if you have 
enough of dough. Take care, in baking, not to 
have it smoked or blackened at the edge. When 
done, cut it into " pie pieces," and send it to table 
to be sf lit and buttered

HALF MOONS.— Of this paste you may make 
italf-moon pies. Cut the paste into round cakes 
On half the circle, lay plenty of stewe-d fruit well 
sweetened, (for instance, stewed dried peach,) fold 
over it the other half, pinch the two edges to 
gether. and crimp them. Bake them in an oven, 
and eat them fresh. If you have fruit in the 
house readj stewed, half-moon pies can be got up 
for a plain dessert on an emergency. Either 
mince meat, or sausage meat, may be baked in 
half-moons. They will bake very nicely, laid 
side by side, in large square tin pans, first 
dredged slightly with flour.

SOFT MUFFINS.— Warm a quart of milk, 
und melt in it a quarter of a pound of the best 
fresh butter, cut into bits. When melted, stir it 
about, and set it away to cool. Beat four eggs 
till very thick and light, and stir them gradually 
into a pan of milk, and butter when it is quite 
cold. Then, by degrees, stir in enough of sifted 
flour to make a batter as thick as yoa can well 
beat it. Then, at the last, stir in three table- 
spoonfuls of baker's or brewer's yeast. Cover 
the pan of batter with a double cloth, and set it 
on the hearth (or some other warm place) to rise, 
but it must not be allowed to get hot. It should 
cave lisen nearly to the top of the pan, and be 
covered with bubbles in about three hours. The 
griddle being heated, grease it with nice butter

SALLY LUNN CAKE.— This is a favorite tea 
cake, and so universally liked that it is well to 
make a liberal quantity of the mixture, and bake 
it in two loaves. Sift into a large pan three 
pounds of fine flour. Warm in a quart of milk 
half a pound of fresh butter, and add a small 
tea-spoonful of salt, six eggs well beaten, and 
add, gradually, two wine glasses of excellent 
fresh yeast. Mix the flour well into the pan, 
(a little at a time) and beat the whole very hanl. 
Divide tliis quantity into two equal portions, and 
set it to rise in two pans. Cover it with thick 
cloths, and set it on the hearth to rise. When 
quite light, grease two loaf-pans w^ith the same 
butter used for the cakes, and bake it in a mode- 
rate oven, keeping up the heat steadily to the 
last. It should be thoroughly done all through 
Send it to table hot, cut in slices, but the slices 
left standing as in a pound cake at a party. 

The Sally Lunn mixture may be baked ok a 
gritldle, as muffins in muffin rings, and split and 
buttered at table. 

In mixing this cake, add neither sugar nor spice. 
They do not improve, but spoil it, as would be

found on trial. It is the best of plaja tea cakpfi, 
if properly made and baked. 



DELAWABE CAKES.— This is a plain 
tea cake. Sift into a pan two quarts of flour. 
Cut np half a pound of fresh butter, and rub 
it into the flour with your hands. Beat five 
eggs very light and thick; make a hole in the 
centre of the flour, and gradually stir the beaten 
eggs, in turn with a pint of milk. Then add a 
jill of fine fresh yeast. Mix the whole thoroughly 
with a broad knife. Transfer it to large square 
tin pans. Cover it with a clean flannel, and set it 
on the hearth to rise. When it is quite light, 
and cracked all over the surface, divide the dough 
into cakes and bake them in muffin rings, on a 
griddle or in a stove. If baked in one large cake, 
there is a risk of their being made heavy, by cut- 
ting them when hot. 

To make sweet cakes with the above mixture, 
add gradually to the flour in the pan, half a pound 
of powdered sugar before you rub in the butter, 
and after the eggs and milk. Stir in a wineglass 
of rose water, or less, if it is very strong, (which 
rosewater seldom is) and also it loses much of its 
strength in cooking. Or, substitute the 3'^ellow 
rind and juice of a lemon, and some powdered 
nutmeg. They will then be a cake for company; 
otherwise, they will be for family teas. 

Either plain or sweet they are very good. We 
rather prefer them plain. If plain, omit even

BUgai. Sugar, without other flavoring, gives plain 
tea cakes a faint sickly taste, and is better left out 
entirely, except for children — and they like any 
kind of sweetness, however little.

MARYLAND BISCUIT.— Take two quarts ol 
sifted wheat flour, and add a small tea-spoonful 
of salt. Rub into the pan of flour a large quar- 
ter of a pound of lard, and add, gradually, warm 
milk enough to make a very stiff dough. Knead 
the lump of dough long and hard, and pound it 
on all sides with a rolling-pin. Divide the dough 
into several pieces, and knead and pound each 
piece separately. This must go on for two or 
three hours, continually kneading and pounding, 
otherwise it will be hard, tough, and indigestible. 
Then make it into small round thick biscuits, 
prick them with a fork, and bake them a pale 
brown. 

This is the most laborious of cakes, and also 
the most unwholesome, even when made in the 
best manner. We do not recommend it ; but there 
is no accounting for tastes. Children should not 
eat these biscuits — nor grown persons either, if 
they can get any other sort of bread. 

When living in a town where there are bakeis. 
there is no excuse for making Maryland biscuit 
Bkilieve nobody that says they are not unwhole 
t^ome. Yet we have heard of families, in country 
places, where neither the mistress nor the cook 
knew any other preparation of wheat bread. 
Better to live on indian cakes.

HOME-MADE BREAD. — You cannot have 
good bread without good flour, good yeast, good 
kneading, and good baking, all united Like 
many other things, the best flour is aw ways 
the cheapest in the end. There is none better 
than that which comes from the mills of Iliram 
Smith, Rochester, New York. All flour should 
be kept in a dry place, damp being always in- 
jurious to it. Good flour goes farther than that 
of inferior quality, and is both whiter and lighter. 
No skill will avail either in making or baking 
bread, if the flour is of bad quality. Flour will 
keep much better if, as soon as a new barrel 
is brought in, the whole of it is sifted, and 
divided in several buckets. Flour buckets, made 
for tha purpose, are short and wide, are broader 
at the bottom than the top, and have handles and 
lids. They are to be had of all coopers. Yeast 
must always be of the best quality, strong and fresh. 
With too much yeast the bread will be bitter; 
with too little it will be heavy ; with stale yeast 
it will be heavy, sour, and dark-colored. If baked 
too little, it becomes tough and clammy. We de- 
precate the practice of putting hartshorn in bread. 
It gives it a bad taste; and even if it produces a 
sort of factitious lightness, it also renders it 
touorh and difiicult to masticate, however nice it 
may look. Also, it is very unwholesome. 

The oven should be heated in time, to set in the 
bread as soon as ready. When once it has risen 
to its utmost lightness, it will fall and turn sour 
if permitted to stand. The only remedy for sou r 



431 MISS Leslie's new cook Boot. 

bread is, to melt a table-spoonful of soda or pearl 
ash in tepid water, and sprinkle it over the dough, 
which must then be kneaded again, after it has 
rested half an hour. In summer, do not begin 
your bread over night ; it will certainly be sour 
before morning. In winter you may do so, but 
keep it all night in a warm (though not a hot) 
place. If the dough freezes, you may throw it 
away at once. 

To knead, double up your hands, put them 
deep into the dough, and woik it with your 
knuckles, exerting all your strength. When the 
dough sticks to them no longer, but leaves your 
bent fingers clean and clear, it is time to cease 
kneading, for you have done enough for that time. 

Sift into a deep pan, or large wooden bowl, s 
peck of line wheat flour, (adding a large table- 
spoonful of salt,) and mix the water with half a 
pint of strong fresh brewer's yeast, or near a 
whole pint if the yeast is home-made. Pour this 
into the hole, in the middle of the heap of flour. 
Mix in with a wooden spoon, a portion of the 
flour from the surrounding edges of the hole so 
as to make a thick batter, and having sprinkled 
dry flour over the top, let it rest for near an hour. 
This is called " setting the sponge^^^ or " making the 
kaven^ When it has swelled up to the surface, 
and burst through the coating of flour that co- 
vered the hole, pour in as much more lukewarm 
water as will suffice to mix the whole gradually 
into a dough. Knead it hard and thoroughly, 
leaving no lumps in it, and continue to knea«i 



HlSa LESLIE'S NSW COOK BOOK. 485 

ti]] the dough leaves your hands. Throw over it 
a clean thick cloth, and set it in a warm place to 
rise again. When it is quite light and cracked 
all over the surface, divide it into loaves, and 
give each loaf a little more kneading, and let it 
rest till it has risen as high as it will. Have your 
oven quite ready, and (having transferred the 
loaves to pans, sprinkled with flour,) bake them 
well. Try the heat of the oven by previously 
throwing in a little flour. If it browns well, and 
you can hold your hand in the heat while you 
count twenty, it is a good temperature for bread. 
If the flour scorches black the oven is too hot, so 
leave the oven open a little while till it becomes 
cooler. As soon as the bread is quite done, take 
out the loaves, wrap each tightly in a clean coarse 
cloth, damped by sprinkling- it with water, and 
stand them up on their edges. This will prevent 
the crust from becoming too hard. Keep the 
loaves wrapped up after they are deposited in the 
bread box. 

ROLLS — Are made as above, except that they 
Are mixed with warm milk instead of water, aud 
a little fresh butter rubbed into the dough. 



«N»WS/\/^^'^#^^^<^ 



TWIST BREAD.— Before you put the dough 
into the baking pans, divide it equally into long 
thick rolls, (smaller at the ends) and plait or twist 
whree *.ogether. 



4:^5- MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

BKAN BREAD— Is made like any other, onlj? 
or bran meal; and in setting the sponge, put 
tvheai flour into the hole, and add to the liquid 
half a tea-cupful of nice brown sugar. Bran 
bread should look very brown. It should be eaten 
fresh. When stale, it i? too dry and hard. Bran 
batter cakes are made and baked like buckwheat. 



>~MW^/^^^l^#^^^Ax 



RYE BREAD.— Is made like wheat bread, but 
that it requires more kneading and baking. Rye 
batter cakes, made like buckwheat, should have 
one half corn meal. 



BREAD BISCUITS, — When making bread 
after the dough has risen very light, take from it 
a quart or more ; knead into it a quarter of a 
pound of fresh butter, and form it into tall rolls. 
Bake them in an oven, and when done break 
them apart, but do not cut them with a knife — 
or, bake them in flat biscuits, to be split and but- 
tered. Bread dough, with some butter added to 
the mixture, will make plain cakes for children, 
with the addition of white sugar, powdered cinna- 
mon, some good raisins, (stoned,) cut in half, 
and dredged well with flour, to prevent their 
clodding or sinking. A beaten egg mixed into 
the dough is an improvement. Children, (accus- 
tomed only to plain living,) like these cakes ver^ 
^ell, but they must be light and well baked. 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 437 

BREAD CAKES.— Take slices of stale whea*, 
bread, that has been well made and light. There 
should be enough to fill a pint bowl, closely 
packed. Put the bread into a deep dish, and pour 
boiling water upon it. While the bread is soak- 
ing, mix in a crock or jar a pint of milk, and a 
pint of wheat flour. Put the soaked bread into a 
cullender, and let the water drain off. When the 
water is drained away, beat the bread lightly with 
a fork, but do not press or mash it. Beat two Qgg^ 
very light and thick, and gradually stir them into 
the flour and milk. Then stir in the bread. Bakfr 
the mixture on a griddle in the manner of buck- 
wheat cakes, and eat them hot with butter. This 
quantity is for a small family of four persons. 

For a family of moderate size, take a quart of 
stale bread, a quart of milk, a quart of flour, and 
four eggs. 

For a large family, two quarts of bread, two 
quarts of milk, two quarts of flour, and eight 
eggs. This quantity will not be more than suiS- 
cient for a large family, as they will all like these 
cakes. 

If you have not enougli of stale bread in the 
house, send for a stale loaf, rather than not have 
the proper proportion for the cakes.

MILK BISCUIT.— Warm a pint of milk on

of fresh butter, to soften, but not to melt. Sifl 
into a pan two quarts of flour; make a hole in

the middle of the flour, and pour into it the milk 
and butter. Bent two eggs till very tliick and 
smooth, and pour them in also. Lastly, pour into 
the hole two wine-glasses of strong fresh brewer's 
or baker's yeast; or, three of good home-mado 
yeast. Mix altogether vs'ith a broad knife, till it 
becomes a lump of soft dough. Then knead it 
well on your pasteboard, and make it into round 
rolls or balls. Knead every ball separately. 
Flatten them with your hand into thick biscuits, 
and prick every one with a fork. Lay them se- 
parately in buttered square pans, and set them to 
rise. If all is right, they will be light in little 
more than an hour. When quite light, (riseu 
high and cracked all over) set them in a moderate 
oven, and bake them a light brown. They should 
be eaten quite fresh. 



iitrSK. — Sift a quart of flour into a pan 
Make a hole in the centre, and pour in a quarter 
of a pound of fresh butter, cut up and softened in 
half a pint of milk warmed on the stove. Beat 
two eggs very light, and mix them gradually into 
the hole in the pan of flour, in turn with a small 
wine-glass of rose water; or a table-spoonful of 
the rose water if as strong as it should be, adding 
a largo t(a-spoonful of powdered mace, nutmeg, 
and cinnamon. Lastly, a wine-glass and a half 
of fresh brewer's yeast. Mix those articles well 
into the flour, till it becomes a lump of soft 
dough. Knead it well on your pasteboard, and 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 439 

divide it into pieces of equal size. Knead eact 
piece separately. Form them so as to be tall an'i 
high, when finished. Butter an iron pan, lay tlw 
rusks in it side by side, and set them in a warm 
place to rise again. When quite light, bake them 
in a moderate oven, and sift sugar over them 
whei cool. 

DE Y EUSKS. — Dry rusks are used for infant's 
food, and for invalids. They are made plain, 
without any butter, spice, or rose water, and after 
being once baked are split, and baked over till 
they are all crisp and browned on the inside. 
Use them dissolved, by pouring on a little warm 
water or milk, and beat them with a spoon to a 
thick pap. 

CEOSS BUNS.— Pick clean a pound and a 

half of dried or Zante currants ; wash, drain, and 

dry them on a large flat dish placed in a slanting 

position near the fire, or in the sun. It will be 

still better to substitute for the currants a pound 

of Sultana (or seedless) raisins, each raisin cut in 

half When quite dry, dredge the fruit thickly 

with flour to prevent their sinking or clodding in 

the caVe. Sift into a deep pan two quarts of 

flour, aui mix thoroughly with it a table- spoonful 

of powdered cinnamon, and three quarters of a 

pound of powdered sugar. Cut up three-quarters 

of a pound of fresh bntter, into a large half pint 

of rich milk. Warm it till the butter is quite 

soft, but not till it melts. Make a hole in the

centre of the pan of flour, and pour in the mixed 
^iquid, adding a jill (or two wine-glasses) of strong 
fresh jeast. Mix in the flour by degrees, begin- 
ning round the edge of the hole, and proceed 
gradually till you have the whole mass of ingre- 
dients well incorporated. Cover the pan with a 
clean thick towel, and set it in a warm place to 
rise. When it has risen high, and is cracked all 
over, mix in a small tea-spoonful of dissolved 
soda. Flour your pasteboard, divide the dough 
into equal portions, mix in the plums, and slightly 
knead it into round cakes the size of a small 
saucer. Place them on a large dish, cover them, 
and set them again to rise in a warm place for 
half an hour. Mark every one deeply with a 
cross, bake them brown, and when done brush 
each bun lightly over with a glazing of white 
of egg, sweetened with sugar.

CINNAMON BEEAD—On a bread-baking 
day, (having made more than your usual quantity 
of wheat bread,) when the dough has risen quite 
light, and is cracked all over the surface, take out 
as much as will weigh two pounds. Mix into it 
a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, that lias 
]>een cut up and melted in a half pint of milk ; 
and also, three beaten eggs. Incorporate the 
butter, milk, and eggj thoroughly with the dough, 
and then add (dissolved in a little tepid water,) a 
salt-spoonful {not more) of soda. Have ready 
mixed it a bowl a pint of brown sugar, moistene«i

with fresh butter, so as to make a stiff pasto^ and 
flavor it with two heaped table- spoonfuls of pow- 
dered cinnamon. Form the cake into the sliapo 
of a round loaf, and make deep incisions av cuts 
all over its surface; filling them up with the cin- 
namon mixture pressed hard into the cuts, pinch- 
ing and closing the dough over them with your 
thumb and finger to prevent the seasoning run- 
ning out. Put the loaf into a round pan, and sei 
it into the oven to bake with the other bread. 
When cool, glaze it over with white of egg^ 
in which some powdered sugar has been dissolved. 
Send it to table whole in form, but cut into loose 
slices. Eat it fresh. All yeast cakes become dry 
and hard the next day. 

This mixture may be baked in a square iron 
pan, and cut into square cakes when cool.

WAFFLES.— We are indebted to the Germans 
for this cake, which, if this receipt is exactly fol- 
lowed, will be found excellent. Warm a quart 
of milk, and cut up in it a quarter of a pound of 
the best fresh butter, and stir it about to soften in 
the warm milk. Beat eight eggs till very thick 
and smooth, and stir them gradually into the 
milk and butter, in turu with half a pound of 
sifted ^our. Then add two table-spoonfuls of 
strong fresh brewer's or baker's yeast. Cover, the 
pan with a clean thick cloth, and set it in a warm 
place to rise. When the batter has risen nearly 
to the top, and is covered with bubbles, it i^ time

water. Having heated your waffle-iron in a good 
fire, grease it inside with the fresh butter used 
for the waffle mixture, or with fresh lard ; fill it, 
and shut the iron closely. Turn it on the fire, 
that both sides of the cake may be equally well 
done. Each side will require about three iKinutea 
baking. Take them out of the iron by slipping 
a knife underneath. Then grease and prepare the 
iron for another waffle. Butter them, and send 
them to the tea-table " hot and hot ;" and, to eat 
with this, a bowl or glass dish of sugar flavored 
with powdered cinnamon. 

In buying waffle irons choose them very deep, so 
as to make a, good impression when baked — if 
shallow, the waffle vvill look thin and poor. Those 
that bake one waffle at a time are the handsomest 
and most manageable.

SOFT CEULLEKS.— Sift a pound and a half 
of flour, aiid have ready a pound of powdered 
sugar. Heat in a round-bottomed sauce-pan a 
quart of water ; and when quite warm, stir the 
flour gradually into the water. In another vessel 
set a pound of nice fresh butter over the fire, and 
when it begins to melt, stir it, by degrees, into the 
flour and water. Then add, gradually, the pow- 
dered sugar, and a grated nutmeg. Take the 
sauce-pan off the fire, and beat the contents with 
a wooden spaddle, (which is far better than a 
«pcon) till they are thoroughly mixed. Next

Have ready on the fire a pot of boiling lard. 
Put in the crullers, taking them off the board one 
at a time, on a broad-bladed knife. Boil but a few 
at a time. They must be of a fine brown. Lift 
them out with a perforated skimmer, draining 
back the lard into the pot. Lay them on a large 
dish, and dredge them with sugar. 

These, if properly managed, ^re far superior to 
all other crullers, but they cannot be made in warm 
weather. 

DOUGH-NUTS.-On bakmg day, take two 
pounds of very light bread dough that has been 
made in the usual manner. Put it into a broad 
pan. Eub into it half a pound of fresh butter, 
and half a pound of powdered sugar, and a table' 
spoonful of mixed nutmeg and cinnamon. Wet 
it with half a pint of milk, and mix in three well 
beaten eggs. Cover it, and set by the fire to rise 
again. When quite light, flour your pasteboard, 
and make the dough into oval balls; or, you mav 
cut it into diamond shapes, (handling it as little 
as possible.) Have ready, over the fire, a pot of 
boil'jig lard. Drop the dough-nuts into it, aad 
boil them; or fry them brown in a frying-pan

COMMON CRULLERS.— The above mixture 
for dough-nuts will make good crullers. Flour 
your pasteboard, lay th6 dough upon it, roll it 
very thick, and cut it into strips with a jagging 
iron. Take off short pieces, and twist them into 
various forms. Throw them into a pot of boiling 
lard. When done, drain the lard from them, spread 
them on a large dish, and dredge them with pow- 
dered white sugar.

molasses, stirred in while the milk is hot. Put 
the milk and molasses into a large pan, and mix 
gradually into them the corn meal while they are

finger, and a heaped tea-spoonful of powdered 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOfc. M5 

^inuamon. Beat the whole mixture Long and hard, 
ibr on that will chiefly depend the lightness of the 
pudding, as it has neither eggs, butter, nor yeast. 
If your batter seems too thin, add, gradually, a 
little more corn meal ; if too thick, a little more 
tnilk and molasses. 

Dip in hot water a large square pudding cloth. 
Spread it out in a pan, dredge it well with flour, 
and then pour the pudding-mixture into it. Tie 
it up, making the string very secure, but leave 
plenty of room between the batter and the tying 
■place, for the pudding to swell in boiling, at least 
one-third. Put the pudding, directly, into a large 
pot, and keep it steadily boiling for about three 
hours. Corn meal requires long cooking. Turn 
the padding twice with a fork. If the water boils 
dway too much, replenish it from a tea-kettle of 
hot water, kept boiling for the purpose. If you 
pour in cold water the pudding will become hard 
and heavy, and be totally spoiled. Do not turn it 
out and send it to table till wanted at dinne.*-. 
Then dip it for a moment in cold water, untie the 
string, and transfer it to a dish with a cover. Eat 
it with molasses and butter ; or make a sauce of 
drawn butter, flavored with wine and nutmeg. 

This pudding, if properly mixed, well beaten, 
ana well boiled, will be as light as if made with 
eggs, (the West India molasses having that pro 
peity) and it will cut down rough or open grained, 
like a very light sponge cake, unless the batter has 
aeen made too thick and stiff, and not sufl&ciently 
beaten, and not allowed space enough to swell in

boiliiig. If made too thiri, or not boiled well, tljo 
pudding will come out a soft, shapeless mass. But 
if all is carefully managed, this (the least costly 
of American puddings) will be found excellent for 
a plain table, and perfectly wholesome. The flavo* 
will be much improved by adding to the cinnamon 
and ginger the grated yellow rind and juice of an 
orange or lemon. If your first attempt at this 
pudding is a failure, try it again — practice makes 
perfect. 

For a large family, have two quarts of corn 
meal, two quarts of milk, and one quart of West 
India molasses ; two table-spoonfuls of ginger, and 
one of cinnamon. 

What is left may be tied in a cloth, and boiled 
over again next day, for half an hour or longer

MOLA SSES PIE.— Make a plain paste, allowing 
a quart of flour to a quarter of a pound of fresh 
butter, and a quarter of a pound of lard. Cut up 
the butter into the pan of flour, and rub it into a 
dough, with a half tumbler of cold water. Too 
■nuch water is injurious to any paste, rendering it 
tough and hard. Roll out the paste into a sheet, 
and with a broad knife spread all over it one- half 
jf the lard. Sprinkle it with flour, fold it, and 
roL \t out again. Spread on the remainder of the 
lard, dredge it slightly, fold it again, and thes 
iivide it into two sheets. Line with one sheet the 
inside of a pie-dish, and fill it with molasses, 
mixed with butter, ana ilavored with ginger and

eiunamon, or lemon or orange. Put on tlie other 
sheet of paste as a lid to the pie. Crimp or notch 
the edges. Bake it of a pale brown, and send it to 
table fresh, but not hot. 



>~»'VV/V/^'^ #*V^^A*> 



MOLASSES POT-PIE.— Make plenty of paste, 
allowing to each quart of flour a small half pound 
of finely minced suet. Line the pot three-quarters 
up the sides with paste, and put in a quart of West 
India molasses, flavored with ginger and cinnamon, 
lemon or orange grating, and juice. Cover it with 
a lid of paste, not fitting closely round its edges, and 
cut a cross slit in the top. Have ready six or 
eight extra pieces of suet paste, cut into squares, 
and boiled by themselves. When the pie is done, 
put these little cakes (ready boiled) into the mo- 
lasses, having removed the lid or cover oi the pie, 
and cut it up. Take out the inside paste, and cut 
it in pieces also. Serve up the whole in one large 
dish. 

BATTER PUDBrNG-.—Having beaten eight 
eggs till very thick and smooth, stir them gradu- 
ally into a pan of milk, m turn with eight tabie- 
spoonfuls of flour, added by degrees. Give the 
whole a hard stirring at last. Dip a square pud- 
ding cloth into hot water, shake it out, dredge it 
with flour, and spread it over the inside of an 
empty pan. Pc-:.r the pudding mixture into it. 
jrather up the cloth, leaving ample space for the 
pudding to swell in boHina^, and securing the strio^

tightly. Put the pudding into a large pet of boil* 
mg water, and boil it fast and steadily for two 
hours. Turn it with a large fork once or twice 
while boiling. When done, dip it for a moment 
in cold water, thav you may turn it out easily. 
Send it to table hot, and eat it with any sauce you 
like, from molasses, or butter and sugar, to wine 
sauce. This, if exactly followed, is the very best 
receipt for a plain batter pudding. It may be made 
of corn meal, or wheat bread-crumbs, (eignt table- 
spoonfuls to eight eggs, and one quart of milk.) 
.Corn meal requires with it one or two spoonfuls 
of wheat flour for this pudding. 

We cannot approve of boiling batter puddings 
m moulds, as they are rarely allowed sufficient 
space for swelling, and are therefore tougb and 
solid. Also, it is frequently very difficult to get 
a hot pudding out of a mould. 

The above pudding is very nice baked in tbe 
dripping pan under a piece of roast beef or veal. 



■'^^^^^^■^^ 



FRITTEKS.— Make the same mixture as fbr 
oatter pudding. Eight eggs beaten very light and 
thick, and stirred gradually into a quart of milk, 
in turn with eight spoonfuls of flour; and, when 
alj are united, beat the whole very hard. In a 
large frying-pan melt a pound of lard, and when 
it comes to a boil, put in with a large spoon a half 
tea-cupful of batter. Fry them fast, a panful at a 
time, and as they require n) stirring they will 
v*oon oe done P'or the next panful, add half a

pound more of lard, and see that it is boiling well 
aJl the time. If there is not enough of lard, or if 
it only simmers, the fritters will stick to the bot- 
tom, and be heavy, dark, and greasy. Send them 
to table "hot and hot," sprinkled with sugar. Eat 
them with sugar, cinnamon, and white wine. This 
ia the best possible receipt for plain fritters 



•f***^ ^^■^'^'^^•f**- 



OEAKGE FKITTliES.— For frying fruit frit- 
ters use nice fresh butter. Peel, and cut into round 
slices (not very thin) some fine oranges, removing 
the seeds carefully. Put into each fritter (while 
frying) a slice of orange, and dredge with sugar. 
Eat them with sweetened orange juice. These are 
fritters for company.

PEACH FRITTERS.— Take large ripe free- 
stone peaches, the best you can get. Peel them, 
cut them in half, remove the stones, and put some 
loaf sugar into the cavities from whence you took 
them. Have ready, in a large frying-pan over 
the fire, an ample quantity of nice fresh butter, 
boiling fast. Put in the batter, and to every spoon- 
ful allow half a peach, laid on its back. When 
dr)ne take them up separately, and drain the buttei 
hack into the pan. Serve up the fritters dredged 
with white sugar. You may color these fritters 
pink by mixing in the batter a little prepared al-

lored oil into the batter ; it has no taste, but the 
color is beautiful. Fritters may be colored green 
by mixing in the batter some of the juice obtained 
from pounded spinach leaves.

APPLE OK QUINCE FKITTEES.— Pare 
and core some pippin or bell-flower apples, or ripe 
quinces. Cut them into roi ind slices, and fry one 
in every fritter. Eat them with sweetened lemon 
juice. You may make fritters with a large table- 
spoonful of any thick marmalade in the centre. 
Or, with a large fresh oyster in the middle €*f each 
Or, with a table-spoonful of mincvd meat. These, 
also, are company fritters.

PANCAKES— Are very inferior to good frit- 
ters, and much more troublesome to bake. They 
are the same ingredients mixed thinner ; are also 
fried in lard, and must be turned by tossing them 
over (one at a time) in the frying-pan. 



JUNKET. — Having turned a quart of rich 
milk, by stirring into it a half tea-cupful of the 
watcjr in which two or three square inches of ren- 
net has been soaked for several hours, set the 
milk in a covered pitcher, in a warm place, till it 
becomes a firm curd, the whey separating from it, 
and looking thin and greenish. Keep it on ice tilJ 
just before it is wanted for table. Then traasfw

it to a large bowl, and sweeten it well witli white 
sugar. Mix in two glasses cf sweet wine, and 
grate over it a nutmeg. It is very nice with ex- 
tract of vanilla added to the wine, &o. 

It is not a good way to preserve a rennet by 
cutting it into little pieces, and keeping it in wine, 
gtirring the wine into milk when you wish to form 
a curd. If turned with rennet wine, the curd will 
never separate completely from the whey, which 
will therefore be always thick and whitish. By 
using rennet water, the whey will be pure, thin, 
and of a light green, and the curd very white and 
firm. In Philadelphia market, dried rennets (which 
will keep a year or two hanging up in a cool dry 
closet) are universally used to make curds, and are 
always to be bought at small prices. They are 
cured by salting them, and stretching on a bent 
rod. To use this rennet, cut off a small bit, and 
soak it several hours, or over night, in a cup of 
lukewarm water. Then stir this water into the 
milk. 

MILK POTTAGE OK FAEMEK'S RICE.— 
Take some rich milk, and put it on to boil in a 
pot of sufficient size. When it has begun to boiJ, 
stir in, by degrees, enough of wheat flour to make 
it about as thick as the general consistence of rice 
milk, and boil it well, stirring it frequently down 
to the bottom. Add a few blades of mace, or some 
powdered cinnamon. Knead together some flour 
and fresh butter, forming a lump of white paste. 
Dividff the paste into small round dumplings about

the size of a cent, and put them to boil with vh& 
railk. When the pottage is well boiled, take it up, 
and transfer it to a tureen or deep white- ware dish, 
and make it very sweet with good brown sugar 
Grate some nutmeg over the surface. 

This is an excellent addition to a winter supper 
table, and is much liked by children, for whom it 
is also good at the end of a plain dinner. As a 
substitute for rice milk, it is better and more 
wholesome than rice itself.

PLAIN RICE PUDDING.-Pick some rice, care- 
fully removing from it the husks, and all impuri- 
ties; and if you find it the least sour or musty, 
throw it away, and get some that is perfectly good. 
Wash it through two or three waters, till it drains 
off quite clean. Stir a quarter of a pound of this 
rice into a quart of good rich milk. If the milk 
is poor and thin, and has been skimmed till it is 
blue, or mixed with water, the pudding will be 
poor accordingly. In the country where cream u 
easily to be obtained, add some to the milk which 
ycu use for the rice padding. Stir in also a quar- 
ter ol a pc und of good brown sugar, and a tea- 
spoonful of powdered cinnamon. Set the pud 
ding into an oven, and bake till a brown skin 
covers the surface, and the rice is quite soft, which 
you may ascertain by lifting a bit of the brown 
skin from the edge and trying the rice. Eat it 
varm or cold. It is usual in the country to put

They will be greatly improved by the addition 
of two or three beaten eggs, and a few bits of 
fresh butter, stirred in with the rice and sugar. 
Also powdered cinnamon. Kice is in itself so 
tasteless, that it requires good flavoring. 



PLAIN BOILED KICE PUDDING. — Pick 

wash, and drain a pound of rice. Moisten it witt

raisins. Dredge them well all over with flour to 
prevent their sinking. Stir them gradually into 
the rice and milk. Boil it in a cloth, leaving 
ample space for it to swell. Keep the water very 
hot all the time. Ea4i it with butter and sugar, 
seasoned with ground cinnamon.

KICE CUPS. — Boil in water, in the usual man- 
ner, a pound or more of cleaned rice till it is per- 
fectly soft. Drain it well, and mix it with a quart 
of milk, seasoned with a mixed table-spoonful of 
powdered cinnamon and nutmeg or mace. Boil 
it a seeond time till all the grains are dissolved 
into a smooth mass, and their form cannot be dis- 
• tiuguished. Mould it in large tea-cups, pint bowls, 
o>r blanc-mange moulds; and when it has taken

BREAD PUDDING -Grate or crumble as 
much stale wheat bread (omitting the crust) as will 
fill a pint bowl when done. Boil a pint of good milk 
with a broken-up stick of cinnamon in it. Strain 
the milk, and pour it (boiling) over the bread. 
Sweeten it with three large table-spoonfuls of su- 
gar. Stir in one or two large table-spoonfuls of 
fresh butter. Beat four eggs till very thick and 
smooth, and add them, gradually, to the mixture, 
when it is lukewarm. It will be much improved 
by the grated peel and juice of a lemon or orange. 
Bake it in a deep dish or mould ; sift white 
sugar over it. Eat it warm, with sweet sauce 
flavored with nutmeg.

BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING. — Cut 

large even slices of yesterday's bread, {leaving on 
the crust) and spread them well with fresh but- 
ter. Strew over them thickly half a pound of 
Zante currants, picked and washed. Make a bat- 
ter of four beaten eggs and a large pint of milk, 
seasoned with powdered nutmeg or mace. Pour 
some of this batter into the bottom of a deep white 
dish. Then put on as many slices of bread and 
oirrants as will cover the bottom. Fext. add the 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 455 

remainder of tlie batter, and finish with slices of 
bread and butter strewed with currants. Bake 
till the batter is set and firm. When done, servo 
it up warm. 

A BROWN BETTY.— Pare, core, and slice 
4hin some fine juicy apples. Cover with the ap- 
ples the bottom of a large deep white-ware dish. 
Sweeten them well with plenty of brown sugar; 
adding grated lemon or orange peel. Strew over 
them a thick layer of bread-crumbs, and add to 
the crumbs a very few bits of fresh butter. Then 
put in another layer of cut apples and sugar, fol- 
lowed by a second layer of bread-crumbs and 
butter. Next more apples and sugar ; then more 
bread-crumbs and butter; repeat this till the dish 
is full, finishing it with bread-crumbs. Bake 
it till the apples are entirely done and quite soft. 
Send it to table hot. It will be improved (if in 
the country at cider-making season) by adding to 
each layer of apples a very little sweet unfer- 
mented cider, fresh from the press. 

This pudding is in some places called an Ap 
pie Pandowdy. We believe it is Brown Betty in 
the South ; Pandowdy in the North. It is a good 
plain pudding if the butter is fresh and sweet, 
and not too much of it. The apples must be juicy 
and rwt sweet. Sweet apples never cook well.

SWEETENED SWEET POTATOS. -•' The

or else so large as to require splitting. Boil 
them till, on probing them with a fork, jou find 
them soft all through. Peel off the skin, and 
trim off the sharp points of each end. Place them 
in a large baking dish, and lay among them some 
pieces of fresh butter; sprinkle powdered sugar 
'profusely over them and among them, especially 
in the vacancies between the potatos. Set the dish 
into a moderate oven, and bake slowly till the 
butter and sugar are all melted and blended to- 
gether, forming a nice crust. They should be eaten 
not with the meat, but after it. They make a 
good supper or luncheon dish, and a plain desseri 
at dinner for plain-living people. 

Sufficient butter and sugar will make the crust 
like a thick syrup, when broken. They should 
be cooked this w^ay only when in the height of 
their season, and perfectly fresh and nice. When 
sweet potatos are old enough to decay at the ends, 
give them up. Large sweet potatos may be first 
boiled; then peeled and sliced thick, sprinkled 
thick with sugar, and fried in fresh butter or lard ; 
the lard well drained from them as they are 
taken up. Eat ihjem with meat. 

They are goed boiled very soft, peeled and 'sent 
'^o table mashed, (while hot) with fresh butter —or 
made into thick flat cakes, and browned on the 
top. 

It is a great waste ,*o bake sweet potatos whole. 
If baked enough, (as they seldom are) they " go 
all to akin."

APPLE DUMPLINGS. — For dum pluigs tne 
apples should be large and juicy— pippins, bell- 
flowers, or the best you can get. Small sweet 
apples make very poor dumplings. Having pared 
the apples, extract the cores with a tin apple-corer, 
so as to leave them smooth and whole. Why ia 
it that so many families " have never had an ap- 
ple corer in their house ?" They cost, at the ut- 
most, but twenty-five cents, are to be had at 
all the tinsmiths' and furnishing stares; and 
they screw out an apple core in a minute; sav- 
irug time and trouble. The apples being ready, 
make a nice paste in the proportion of a small 
pint of finely-minced suet, to a large quart of 
flour; one-half of the suet rubbed into the pan 
of flour, (adding a very Itlile water) the other 
half sliced thin, and spread all over the sheet ol 
dough after it is rolled out; then folding it, and 
rolling it out again. Gut the sheet of dough in as 
many circular pieces as you have apples, allowing 
them large enough to close entirely over the top, 
and rolling it thick enouga to hold the apple se- 
curely without danger of its breaking through. 
Put an apple on every piece of paste, and fill with 
brown sugar the hole from whence the core was 
taken. Squeeze on the sugar some fresh leo^^on 
juice, with the grated yellow rind ; or, add some 
powdered nutmeg or mace, or some rose-water. 
This will make them very nice. They should be 
boiled m small cloths kept clean for the purpose, 
dipped in hot water, and sprinkled with flour, and 
roi^m left for the dumpling to swell. Put them 



458 MISS LESLIE-?? NETV COOK ROOK. 

into a pot of boiling water, and boil them stoa. 
dily for near an hour. Serve them up very hot, 
as they become heavy when cold. Eat with them 
butteif and sugar, or cream sauce. 



~«*^'^A#^'^A^^^\^«» 



PEACH DUMPLINGS.— Take large fine free- 
stone peaches. Peel them, cut them in half, and 
extract the stones; fill the sockets with white 
sugar, and put the two halves together. Make a 
nice suet paste , or, if more convenient, of butter, 
but it must be quite fresh, and very nice. Allow 
half a pound of butter to a large quart (or a pound) 
of sifted flour. Eub half the butter into the pan 
of flour, and make it into a dough, with a very 
little cold water. Too much water always makes 
tough heavy paste. Then roll the paste into a 
sheet, and put on it with a knife the remainder 
of the butter in regular bits. Fold it, roll it out 
again, and divide it into circular pieces. Lay a 
peach on each. Gather up the dough over the 
top, so as to form a weil shaped dumpling. Boil 
them in cloths for full three-quarters of an hour 
or more. Eat them with cream sauce. 

DumpJings of raspberries, or blackberries, may 
bejpciade as above. Also, of gooseberries or cur- 
rants, made very sweet. Quinces preserved whole 
make excellent dumplings.

lemon, or rose, or nutmeg. The apples must be 
sliced. The pudding should be tied in a cloth i 
put into a pot of fast-boiling water, kept steadily 
boiling for two hours or more, and sweetened 
with brown sugar as soon as it is taken up, cut- 
ting a round piece of paste out of the top, and 
putting in with the sugar a small piece of fresh 
butter. 

Large puddings may be made in this manner 
of stoned cherries, damsons, or plums, or of 
gooseberries, or currants — allowing plenty of 
fruit, and making it very sweet ; besides sending 
sugar to table with it.

ROLLED PUDDING.— Have ready a quart or 
more of apples stewed with very little water, sweet- 
ened with brown sugar, and flavored with lemon 
or rose. Prepare a nice suet paste. Eoll it out, 
and cut it into a square sheet. Spread it thickly 
vvith the stewed fruit, (not extending the fruit 
quite to the edges of the dough) and roll it up as 
far as it will go. Close it nicely at each end. Tie 
it in a cloth, dipped in hot water and floured, 
and put it into a fast-boiling pot. Boil it well. 
Cut it down in round slices. Eat it with butte^' 
and sugar beaten together, or with cream sauce 
Y"ou may make this pudding of any sort of thick 
marmalade, spread over the sheet of paste; or. 
with ripe uncooked currants, raspberries, or black- 
berries, mashed raw, sweetened, and spread on 
thickly. This pudding is the same that common 



460 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

English people call a " Jack in a blanket;" and 
sometimes "a Dog in a blanket." The blanhet is 
supposed to mean the paste; the dog is probably 
the fruit. v . 

FRUIT POT-PIES.— These are made in a pot 
lined with paste, interspersed with small squares of 
the same dough, and covered with a paste lid. 
The filling is of dried apples, peaches quartered, 
blackberries, raspberries, ripe currants, or goose- 
beries; all well sweetened, and cooked in their own 
juice, with a small ten-cupful of water at the bot- 
tom to '* start them." Both fruit and paste must 
be perfectly well done. 

Fruit pot-pies are easier made and cooked, than 
fruit puddings or dumplings. We recommend 
them highly for plain tables. They require more 
sugar when they are dished. A large bain-marie^ 
is excellent for cooking any sort of pot-pie, the 
water being all in the outside kettle.

BOILED CUSTARD. — Make exactly the 
above mixture ; but instead of baking, boil it in a 
porcelain lined sauce-pan, stirring it all the time. 
As soon as it comes to a boil, take it immediately 
from the fire, or it will curdle. Put it into a glass 
or china pitcher, anil set it to cool. A hain-marU 
is excellent for boiled custard. 

If custards are baked in cups, set them in an 
iron pan half full of warm water. If too hot, or 
kept baking too long, they will be tough and po- 
rous, and have whey at the bottom. So they will

APPLES BAKED WHOLE.— Never bake ap- 
pies without paring and coring. They will be 
found nearly all skin and core, and are trouble- 
some and inconvenient to eat. Have fine large 
apples; take off a thin paring, and extract the 
core with a tin corer. Fill up the holes with 
brown sugar. Place the apples, side by side, in a

BAKED PEAES. — Take good-sized pears. 
Small ones are not worth the trouble of cooking. 
Peel them, split them in half, and remove the 
core, the st^m, and the blossom end. Strew them 
well with brown sugar, and lay them on their 
backs in a large baking dish. A narrow slip of 
the yellow rind of lemon or orange, (cut so thin 
as to look transparent,) will be a great improve- 
ment, laid in the hollow of each pear. Also the 
juice squeezed. Put into the dish sufBicient mo- 
lasses or steam-syrup to well cover the pears. 
Place them in an oven, and bake them till they 
are soft, but not till they break. If you have no 
lemon oi orange, season them with ground ginger 
or cinnamon. 

The great pound pears are baked as above, with 
the addition of port wine and a few cloves, and 
colored red with a little cochineal.

GOOSEBERRY FOOL. — This foolish name 
signifies an excellent preparation of gooseberries ; 
stewed, mashed, and made very sweet with brown 
sugar. Have ready in another dish a good boiled 
custard. When all has become cool, mix well 
together in u large bowl the stewed gooseber- 
ries and the custard and season the mixture well 
v^'ith nutmeg. It will be found vory good. 

Any other *' fool" may be made in the same 
manner, of stewed fruit and boiled custard. It saves 
the trouble and expense of making paste, or can

be prepared at a shorter notice. It is good eithei 
at dinner or tea. 

We hope somebody will think of a better name 
for it. 

POTATO PASTE.— Boil three moderate-sized 
potatos till very soft. Then peel and mash them 
tine and smooth. Put them into a deep pan, and 
mix them well with a quart of flour and a half 
pint of lard ; or what is better, with that quantity 
of beef dripping, or the dripping of fresh roast 
pork. Never for any sort of crust use mutton 
dripping. Having mixed the mashed potato, 
dripping, and flour into a lump, roll it out into a 
thick sheet. Sprinkle it with flour, and spread 
over it evenly a thin layer of dripping or lard. 
Fold it again, and set it in a cool place till wanted. 
It is good for meat pies, and for boiled meat pud- 
ding, or any sort of dumplings. 



•»*^VS*^"^^^^V*«> 



YERY PLAIN PIE-CRUST.— Sift a quart 
of flour into a pan. Mix together, with a knife, a 
quarter of a pound of fresh butter, and a quarter 
of a pound of lard, and when they a e well 
blended mix them with the flour, and form them 
into a dough with as little water as possible — the 
water being very cold. Use ice water in summer. 
Avoid touching the paste with your hands, but 
use a knife almost entirely. If your hand is warm, 
do not rub butter into flour with it, but manage 
M^l the Pdixing with a knife. If you have a coa 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 465 

hand, you may rub the butter into the dour, and 
reserve the lard to spread all over the sheet of 
dough Eoll it out lightly. Dredge with flour, 
fold it, »?pread on the lard, and roll it again. Di 
vido it into two pieces, and roll out each of them. 
Trim the edges nicely, and make them to fit your 
pie-dish. If one is for bottom crust, roll it out 
thmnest towards the centre, having for this part 
of the process a very small rolling-pin, but a fin- 
ger long. Grease with lard a deep dish, or soup 
plate, and line it with the bottom crust. Fill it 
up with the fruit you intend for the pie, sweetened 
well with brown sugar, and heaping the fruit high 
in the centre. Cover it with a lid of paste, trim, 
and notch the edges neatly, and make a cross slit 
in the top ; set it in the oven, and bake it steadily 
till it is a light brown. When it seems to be done, 
lift up a small piece at one side to try if the fruit 
is soft. Apples for pies should be pared, cored, 
and sliced very thin. If green, stew them before 
they are baked. 

][f you have saved enough of the dripping of 
roa'st beef, veal, or pork, (skimmed and put away 
in a covered crock) it will be good shortening for 
common pies — far superior to salt butter, and 
much lighter. Salt renders pastry hard and heavy. 

Never use suet for hahed paste. It is only for 
dumplings and pot-pies. Bread dough, or any 
dough made with yeast, is not good when boiled, 
becoming tough and leathery, and being very un- 
wholesome. 

Except in very plain country places a fruit pie 



466 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

with two crusts, (under aud upper) is now seen 
but rarely. Meat pies, or birds, however, should 
have two crusts. The gravy is a great improve- 
ment to the under one. English people usually 
make their fruit pies with a top-crust only, put- 
ting a turned down tea- cup under the centre of 
the lid to collect the juice, (of course removiug 
tlie cup when the pie is cut.) It is a good method 
in a country where the cost of flour is high. 

Too much economy in the shortening will infal- 
libly make the crust very poor, hard, heavy, and 
unwholesome. If you cannot afford dessert paste, 
do not attempt pies at all ; but substitute a plain 
charlotte, or slices of bread and butter, covered 
with stewed fruit, sweetened, and laid in a deep 
dish. 

COMMON FRUIT PIES.— Make the paste as 
above. For baking, use only apples that are juicy, 
and rather sour. If green, stew them before they 
are put in the pie, and make them very sweet 
with brown sugar. Peaches should be peeled and 
quartered, leaving out the stones. Of cherries, 
take the large red juicy pie cherries. Black cher- 
ries, (when baked) go all to stones, and they are 
not worth the trouble of cooking, though very 
good when eaten from the trees. Currants must 
bo carefully stripped fp:)m the stems, and made 
very sweet. Gooseberries must be "top and tailed,** 
and require great sweetening ; so do cranba fictf. 
Blackberries make good plain pies, and are /»#y 
juicj^ if ripe. All pies should be well filled

Pies may be made of ripe wild grapes, stewed 
in molasses or maple sugar.

EXCELLENT PLAIN PASTE.— Sift into a 
deep pan a quart and a pint of the best superfine 
flour. Have ready (set on ice, and covered with a 
thick double cloth) a pound of the very best 
fresh butter. When you want to use it, cut it 
into four quarters. Cut one quarter into very 
little bits, and with a broad knife mix it well 
into the flour, adding, by degrees, a very little 
water, no more than half a tumbler. Some flour, 
however, requires more water than others. Avoid 
touching the dough with your hands, in case they 
should be warm. Take out the lump of dough 
dredge it with flour, and lay it on your pasteboard 
Keep on a plate near you a little extra flour foi 
sprinkling and rolling. Roll out the sheet of 
dough very thin, having floured the rolling-pin 
to prevent its sticking. Place, with a knife, the 
second quarter of butter in little bits all over the 
sheet of paste, at equal distances. Then fold it 
square, (covering the butter with the corners of 
paste) dredge it, and roll it out again to receive 
the third quarter of butter. Repeat this again, 
till all the butter is in ; always rolling very fast, 
and pressing on lightly. You will see, towards 
the last, the paste puffing into little blisters all 
over the surface; a sign of success. When the 
last layer of butter is all in, roll the whole into a 
large sheet roU it round like a scroll, and pat it 



468 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

away in a cold place, but not so cold as to freeze 
it, for it will thea be spoiled. When you aro 
ready for it bring it out, cut it down, and roll out 
each piece ready for use. There is no better fa- 
mily paste than this, for all sorts of pies ; meat or 
bird pies, especially.

LEMON BREAD PUDDING.— Mince very 
fine a quarter of a pound of beef suet. Have 
ready a pint and a half of finely-grated bread- 
crumbs. Prepare the yellow rind of a large 
lemon, grated off from the white skin beneath, 
and squeeze the juice among it. Mix together in a 
deep pan the bread-crumbs and suet, adding four or 
five table- spoonfuls of powdered sugar, and a tea- 
spoonful of mixed spice, cinnamon, nutmeg and 
mace. Beat in a broad shallow pan five eggs 
till very smooth and thick. Add them gradually 
to the other ingredients, a little at a time. 
Have ready a square pudding-cloth, scalded and 
floured. Pour in the mixture, and tie the cloth 
tightly, but not closely, as room must be left for 
the pudding to swell in boiling. Put it into a 
pot of hot water, and boil it steadily for two 
hours. Send wine sauce to table with it — or cold 
sauce, of beaten butter, and sugar, and nutmeg. 

If you use butter instead of suet, you can bake 
this pudding. 

PLAIN PLUM PUDDING. — This is for a 
small plain-living family. Chop very fine half a

pound of nice fresh beef suet. Stone a half 
pound of very good raisins, or use the sultana or 
seedless sort. Dredge them well on all sides with 
fiour to prevent their sinking to the botiom. 
Grate the yellow rind of a large fresh lemon, and 
strain the juice into the saucer on which you have 
grated the rind. It will be still better if you use 
the rind and juice of an orange as well as of a 
lemon. Put into a bowl half a pint of grated 
bread-crumbs, and a heaped table-spoonful of 
flour, and pour on them a half pint of boiling 
milk. Beat in a shallow pan four eggs till very 
thick and light. Mix the suet gradually into the 
bread, adding alternately the beaten egg, (a little 
at a time) the lemon and orange, and four heaped 
table-spoonfuls of sugar. Lastly, stir in by de- 
grees, the raisins, well floured. Put the mixture 
into a square pudding-cloth spread out into a 
deep pan, and dipped in boiling water. Tie it 
securely, leaving room to sw«lL Boil it three 
hours. 

Eat with it a sauce of butter, sugar, and nutmeg, 
beaten together. 



FINE DESSERTS. 



THE BEST PUFF-PASTE.— To a pound of 
the best fresh butter allow a pound of the finest 
flour, sifted into a deep pan. Ilave on a plate 
some additional sifted flour for sprinkling and

rolling in. Divide the pound of butter into four 
equal parts, and three of those parts divide again 
into two portions. Mix the first quarter of but- 
ter into the mass of flour, cutting it with a broad- 
bladed knife. If your hands are naturally warm, 
avoid touching the dough with them, as their heat 
will render it heavy. Paste, to be very good, 
should be made on a marble slab. All well-fur- 
nished kitchens or pastry rooms should be pro- 
vided with marble-topped tables, and marble mor- 
tars. Add gradually to the lump of dough a 
very little cold water, barely sufficient to moisten 
it with the first quarter of butter, and mix it well 
with the aid of the broad knife ; but proceed as 
fast as you can, and do not work v/ith it too long. 
Too much water will render it tough, and too much 
working will make it heavy. Then sprinkle the 
marble slab with some of the spare flour, take the 
lump of paate from the pan, and roll it out into 
a sheet. Divide one of the portions of butter into 
little bits, and with the knife disperse them 
equally all over the sheet of paste. Then sprinkle 
it again with flour, fold it up so as to cover the 
butter, and roll it out again. Proceed in this 
manner till you have got in all the butter, rolling 
always lightly, and you will soon see the surface 
of the dough puffing up in little blisters, a sign 
that it is becoming light. Besides the first mixing 
in the lump, the butter will then be put in with 
what are called six turns. When baked, you will 
see that every turn makes a layer or sheet. If 
you choose to multiply them, you may m.ake nine 



SnSS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 471 

sheets. Y/e have seen twelve. All this must be 
done fast and lightly. Then put away the paste 
to ccol for ten minutes before arranging it in the 
dishes. This quantity will make two pies or four 
^'\rts. In baking, let the oven be hot, and keen up 
a steady beat, so the paste may not fall after it 
has first risen. When pale browa, it is done. 



»#^S^#^^l/V^S/VA»»<«« 



SHELLS. — For shells take the best puff paste, 
and line with it large deep plates, the size of 
a soup-plate. They should have broad rims. 
Notch the edges of the paste handsomely with a 
sharp penknife, and be careful not to plaster on, 
afterwards, any bits by way of mending cr rec- 
ti fying an error. When baked, every patch in 
the border will show itself plainly. Bake the 
shells entirely empty, till pale brown all over. 
When cool fill them, quite up the top, with what- 
ever marmalade or stewed fruit you have prepared 
f(^r the purpose. In this way (baking them empty,) 
1:3-3 :5.kRlls are thoroughly done, and not clammy 
tiiO. heavy at the bottom, as they always are when 
liio'l before baking. The fruit requires no other 
cooking, having been done once already. Silt 
white sugar over the surface. If for company whip 
some cream, sweeten it, and flavor it with lemon, 
orange, pine-apple, strawberry or vanilla, and pile 
ii on the surface of the shel) hbfore it goes to 
table. 

Small tarts m?.y, in this w&j, be baked entpfyj

made very sweet, and creamed on tbe top — or 
you H-ay fill the shells with any sort of sweet- 
moats, either preserves or marmalade, or with 
mi nee-meat. Sb«lls may be made thus, and filled 
with stewed oysters, or reed-birds, cooked pre- 
viously, and served up warm ; or with nicely- 
dressed lobster. You may iuf^k.e lids for them 
of the same paste baked bv itself on a shallow 
plate, and when taken off fitting well as a cover 
to put on afte wards before sending to table. 

BOBDEES OF PAS^fE.— Th^se are mads ol 
;me puff-paste cut into handsome patterns, or 
wreaths of leaves or flowers. They are laid round 
the broad edge of the deep plate that contains a 
rich pudding, s'lch as lemon, orange, almond, 
cocoa nut, pine-apple, c^c. ; the dish being full 
down to the bottom and up to the top, and having 
no paste but the border round the edge. They 
must be baked in the dish on which they come to 
table, and not in tin or iron, as the pudding can- 
not be transferred. At handsome tables, a pud- 
ding baked with a paste under it (lining the dish,) 
is now seen but seldom. 

Instead of wreaths, you may make a puff paste 
border by laying a thick evenly cut band of paste 
rouiiU tlie flat rim of the dish, and notching it, for'n- 
ing with a penknife small squares about an inch 
wide, and turning one square up and one square 
do'Yn alternately, c^retfic<ie/n2€ fashion- Oi you 



MISS Leslie's NEW cook booe:. 473 

may make the squares near two inches wide and 
turn oyer one corner sharp, leaving the other flat. 
This looks pretty when baked, if me paste is 
very puff, 

LEMON PUDDING.— To make two pudJinga 
take two fine large ripe lemons, and rub them 
under your hand on a table. Grate off the 
thin yellow rind upon a large lump of loaf 
sugar. Cut the lemon, and squeeze the juice 
into a saucer through a strainer, to avoid the 
seeds. Put half a pound of powdered white 
sugar into a deep earthen pan, (including the 
sugar .on which you have rubbed the lemons) and 
cut up in it half a pound of the best fresh butter, 
adding the juice. Stir them to a light cream with 
a wooden spaddle, which is shorter than a mush- 
stick, and flattened at one end ; that end rather 
thin, and rather broad. Beat in a shallow pan, 
(with hickory rods) six eggs, till very thick and 
smooth, and stir them gradually into the mixture. 
Have ready some of the best puff-paste, made in 
the proportion of a pint or half a pound of very 
nice fresh butter to a pint or half a pound of sifted 
flour. Take china or white- ware dishes with broad 
rims. Butter the rim, and lay round it neatly a 
border of the paste. Put no paste inside the dish 
beneath the mixture. Fill each dish to the top 
with the pudding mixture, and set it immediately 
into the oven. It will bake in about half an hour 
When done, and browned on the surface, set it to

^ool. and send it to table in the dish it was 
baked in. 

Fine puddings are now made witriout an under 
crust, but merely a handsome border of puff-paste 
laid round the edge, and helped with the pud* 
ding. Sift sugar over the surface. This quantity 
will make one large padding, or two small ones 

To almost all puddings the flavor of lemcn or 
orange is an improvement. A genuine hahed lemon 
pudding, (such as was introduced by the justly 
celebrated Mrs. Goodfellow,) and is well known at 
Philadelphia dinner parties, must have no flour 
or bread whatever. The mixture only of butter, 
sugar, and eggs, (with the proper flavoring) and 
when baked it cuts down smooth and shining, 
like a nice custard. Made this way, they are 
among the most delicious of puddings; but, of 
course, are not intended for children or invalids. 
We have already given numerous receipts for 
jilain family desserts. In this chapter the receipts 
are " for company." The author was realli/ a pupil 
of Mrs. Goodfcllow's, and for double the usual 
term, and while there took notes of every thing 
that was made, it being the desire of the liberal 
and honest instructress that her scholars should 
learn in reality.

tLus peeled, take them out singly, wipe them dry 
in a clean napkin, and lay them on a plate. Pound 
them one at a time in a marble mortar till they 
become a smooth paste, adding frequently a few 
drops of rose-water to make them light and piC' 
eerve their whiteness, mixing the bitter almonds 
with the sweet. As you pound them, take out the 
paste and lay it in a saucer with a tea-spocn. 
Without the rose-water they will become oily 
and dark-colored. Without a few bitter almonds 
the others will be insipid. The almonds may be 
thus prepared a day before they are wanted for 
use. Cut up a large quarter of a pound of fresh 
butter in a large quarter of a pound of powdered 
sugar, and stir them together with a spaddle till 
very light and creamy. Add a large wine-glass 
of mixed wine and brandy, and half a grated nut- 
meg. Beat, till they stand alone, the whites only 
of six eggs, and stir them gradually into the but- 
ter and sugar, in turn with the pounded almonds. 
Stir the whole very hard at the last. Put the 
mixture into a deep dish with a broad rim, and 
fill it up to the top, laying a border of puff-paste 
all round the rim. Serve up the pudding cool, 
having sifted sugar o'''3r it.

COCOA-NUT PUDDING.— Break up a ripe 
cocoa-nut. Having peeled off the brown skin, 
wash all the pieces of nut in cold water, and wipe 
them dry on a clean napkin. Then grate the 
cocoa-nut very fine into a pan, till you have a 
quart. In a deep pan cut up a quarter of a 
pound of fresh butter, and add a very light quar 
ter of a pound of powdered white sugar. Stii 
together (with a spaddle,) the butter and sugui 
till they are very light an«i creamy, and add a

^ine-apple. Rsmove the leaves, and quarter it 
without paring, standing up o.a:h quarter in a 
deep plate, and grating it dovm till you come to 
the rind. Strew plenty of powdered sugar over 
the grated fruit. Cover it, and let it rest for an 
hour. Then put it into a porcelain kettle, and 
steam it in its own syrup till perfectly soft. Have 
ready some empty shells of puff-paste, baked either 
in patty-pans or in soup plates. When they are 
cool, fill them full with the grated pine-apple; add 
more sugar, and lay round the rim a border of 
puff-past^.

the yellow rind of lemon, pared so thin as to be 
nearly transparent.

A MEEIXGUE PUDDING.— Hub off upon a 
large lump of sugar the yellow rind of two fine 
ripe lemonS; and mix it with a pound of powdered 
loaf sugar, adding the juice. Whip, to a stiff 
troth, the ichites only of eight eggs ; and then, gra- 
dually, beat in the sugar and lemon, adding a 
heaped table-spoonful of tie finest flour. Spread 
part of the mixture thickly over the bottom of a

jelly. Then fill up the dish, and set it a few min. 
ates in a rather cool oven to brown slightly. 
Tiiis pudding is for dinner company. If you use 
oranges, omit half the grated peel. 

You may flavor the meringue with vanilla. 
Split, and break up a small vanilla bean, and boil 
it in a very little cream till all the vanilla flavor is 
extracted, the cream tasting of it strongly Then 
strain it well, and mix the vanilla cream with the 
white of Qgg. Or, a little home-made extract of 
vanilla will be still better. This is obtained by 
splitting and breaking up some vanilla beans, and 
steeping them for a week or two in a bottle of 
absolute alcohol; then straining the liquid, trans- 
ferring it to a clean bottle, and keeping it closely 
corked. Yery little of what is called " Extract of 
Yanilla" is good, and it is more expensive than to 
make it yourself. Also, what is generally sold for 
essence of lemon is very inferior to real lemon 
juice. 

JELLY OR MARMALADE PUDDING. 

Divide the paste equally and line two puff-paste 
shells. Bake them empty ; and while baking, beat 
till very light and thick, the yolks of six eggs. Mix 
the beaten Qgg with a liberal portion of any nice 
kind of fruit, jelly or marmalade, and boil it ter 
mmutes in a sauce-pan. stirring it well. Take it 
up and set it away to cool. When cold, fill wllh 
it the baked s>.elis. Fill them up to the top with 
the mixture, and before they go to table sir: pow- 
dered white sugar over the surfar^e of the puddings.

CHEESE PUDDING. — Take a quarlor of a 
f»oiind of excellent cheese; rich, but not strong or 
old. Cut it in small bits, and then beat it (a little 
at a time} in a marble mortar. Add a quarter of 
a pound of the best fresh butter. Cut it up, and 
pound it in the mortar with the cheese, till per- 
fectly smooth and well mixed. Beat five eggs till 
very thick and smooth. Mix them, gradually, 
with the cheese and butter. Put the mixture into 
a deep dish with a rim. Have ready some puft- 
paste, and lay a broad border of it all round the 
edge, ornamenting it handsomely. Set it imme- 
diately into a moderate oven, and bake it till the 
paste is browned, and has risen very high all 
round the edge of the dish. Sift white sugar over 
it before it goes to table. 

It is intended that the cheese taste shall predo- 
minate. But, if preferred, you may make the 
mixture very sweet by adding powdered sugar ; it 
may be seasoned with nutmeg and mace. Either 
way is good. 

It may be baked in small patty-pans, lined at 
the bottom and sides with pufi-paste. Remove 
them from the tins as soon as they come out of the 
oven, and place them on a large dish. 

This pudding is very nice made of rich fresh 
cream cheese ; the rind, of course, being pared ofi*. 
Cream cheese pudding will require sugar and 
spice — that is, a heaped tea-spoonful of powdered 
nutmeg, mace, and cinnamon, all mixed; two 
ounces of fresh butter, and sLx eggs.

FLORENDTNES.— These are made of any sort 
cf fruit, stewed in its own juice or in sweetmeat 
syrup, but when practicable, without any water. 
A pint of this fruit is mixed with half a pint of 
fresh butter, and half a pint of powdered sugar 
stirred together to a light cream, and then mixed 
with three well- beaten eggs, and the fruit stirred 
in alternately with the beaten butter and sugar. 
Have ready baked shells of puff-paste, ready to 
be filled with the mixture. The fruit may be 
apples, quinces, peaches, gooseberries, currants, 
raspberries. Cranberries, gooseberries, and cur- 
rants, require additional sugar, as they are nat'i- 
rally very sour. If you use plums or cherries for 
any sort of cooking, stone them first. 



PEACH PIES.— Take a sufficient number of 
fine juicy freestone peaches. Clingstones are very 
hard and insipid when raw, and still more taste- 
less when cooked. Peel the peaches and quarter 
them, having removed the stones. Stew them in 
their own juice, and while hot make them very 
sweet with white sugar. When you put them to 
stew, place among them a bunch of fresh green 
peach leaves, to be removed when the peaches ar^i 
done. Or, cook with them some peach kernels 
blanched in hot water, to be picked out when th^ 
stewing is finished. Peach leaves or kernels com 
municate a flavor which to most persons is plea 
sant. Have ready some puff paste shells ; baked, 
and beginning to cool. Fill them to the top with 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 483 

the stewed peaches, and pile on them some whipped 
cream sweetened, and flavored with noyau or ^0£»c^ 
water. 

A FRUIT CnARLOTTE.— Have ready a large 
fresh almond sponge cake, or lady cake. Cut a 
foond or circular piece to fit the bottom of a great 
glass bowl. Also, about twelve or fourteen oblong 
slices, to stand up all round to line the sides. 
Have ready tv.'o quarts or more of ripe strawber- 
ries or raspberries. Mash the fruit to a jam, and 
having made it very sweet with white sugar, 
spread it thickly over the pieces of cake. Lay 
the circular piece of cake in the bottom of tha 
bowl and stand up the others all round the side."!; 
all close to each other or wrapping .iver a little. 
Proceed to fill the bowl with the tr lit ; and when 
half way up, put on another layer of sli3ed cake 
spread with fruit. Then fill up with fruit to the top. 
Have ready a quart of whipped cream flavored 
with vanilla or bitter al::.cnds Heap it high on 
the bowl, and set it m a oool place till it goes to 
table. This is a very fine article for a nice desser^ 
and can be prepared at a short notice, and with- 
out going down stains, as it riquirec no oooki::^^. 

For the whipped cream you may pile the bowi 
with any sort of white ice-cream realty made, ana 
if there is no fresh fruit in season, fcbfitit'jte mar- 
malade or fruit jelly.

VANILLA CUSTARDS.— Split a vanilla bean, 
break it into small bits, and boil it in a half pint 
of milk, till all the flavor of the vanilla is exr 
tracted. Strain it through a very fine strainer^ 
cover it, and set it aside. Boil a quart of rich , 
milk, and when it comes to a boil set it aw^ay to 
cool. Beat eight eggs till very thick and smooth, 
(and when the milk is cold) add that which is fla- 
vored with vanilla, and stir it in gradually with a 
quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar. 
Divide the rr-'.xrar^ m custard cups, (filling them 
to the top) aLC set them into an iron bake-pan 
filled with boiling water, reaching nearly to the 
the rim of the cupo. Put them into a moderate 
oven, and bake them a pale brown. When cool, 
grate nutmeg, or lay a ma^oaroon on the top over 
each. Never send cus^aris warm to table. If 
well made, and baked not too much, there will be 
Qo whey at the bottom of the cups, and the cus- 
tards will be smooth and firm all through, and 
have no spongy hoies in them. 

To make soft custards, omit the whites of all the 
eggs, and have a double quantity of yolks. TLo 
whites may be used for almond or cocoa-nut pud 
ding, for lady cake, for meringue or icing, and foi 
kisses or maccaroong. 

Orange Custards, — Prepare four large rip« 



MISS Leslie's new cook book, 485 

oranges, by roU'ng them under your hand od 
a table to increase the juice. Use none of th^ 
peel for these custards, but reserve it for some 
thing else. Beat in a shallow pan twelve eggs till 
thick and smooth. Mix the orange juice with a 
wineglass of cold water, and stir it gradually into 
the beaten egg^ with a small tumblerful of pow- 
dered ougar. There is no milk in these custards. 
Divide them into custard cups, and beat them ten 
minutes. When cold, grate nutmeg over them. 

Lemon Custard — Is made in the above manner, 
with the juice of four large lemons, (omit- 
ting the rind) a small wineglass of cold water, 
twelve beaten eggs, and a quarter of a pound of 
powdered sugar. Any of these fine custards may 
be boiled in a bain-marie, with water in the outside 
kettle, and there is no way better. When boiled 
and cool, grate in son\e nutmeg, and serve up the 
custard in a glass or china pitcher, with saucerfi 
of the same to eat it from, or divide it in small 
glass cups with handles to them. 

Lemon or orange custards are very fine. They 
are made without milk. 

Chocolate Custard. — Make some strong choco 
late, allowing a quarter of a pound of the best, 
(which is Baker's prepared cocoa) to a quart 
of rich milk ; first mixing the milk and scraped 
chocolate to a smooth paste. Boil them together 
a quarter of an hour. While warm, stir in two 
or three table-spoonfuls of loaf sugar. Then set 
II away to cool. Have ready eight well- beaten 
eggs, and stir them gradually into the chocolate 



486 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

Bake the mixture in enps, and serve them np witli 
a chocolate mnccaroon laid on tb.e top of each. 

Almond and Maccaroon Cusldvd. — Boil in half a 
pint of rich milk a handful of bllter almond,:?, 
blanched and broken up. When highly flavored, 
strain that milk and set it aside. Boil a quart of 
milk by itself, and when cold stir in, gradually, 
eight well beaten eggs, adding the flavored milk, 
and half a pint of powdered sugar. Stir the 
whole very hard at the last. Bake it in cups, 
and when done and cold, lay on the top of each a 
maccaroon with four others placed around it; five 
muccaroons to each custard. Or, if the macca- 
roons are made in the house, let every one be 
lar;(e enough to cover the top of the custard like 
a livl. 

FINE PLUM PUDDmG.— This pudding is 
best when prepared, (all but the milk and eggs J 
the day before it is wanted. Seed and cut in 
half one pound of the best bloom raisins; and 
pick, wash, and dry before the tire, a pound of 
Zante currants, (commoly called plums.) Dredge 
the fruit well with flour, to prevent its sinking 
or clogging. Take one pound Of fresh beef suet, 
freed from the skin and strings, and chopped very 
fine ; a pint of grated bread-crumbs, and half a 
pint of sifted flour; a large quarter of a pound 
of the best sugar, a large table-spoonful of pow- 
dered mace and cinnamon mixed, and two pow- 
dered nutmegs— all the spice steeped in a half 
pint of mixed wine and brandy. Put away these 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 487 

ngredients separately, closely covered, and let 
I hem stand undisturbed all night. Next morn* 
lag proceed to finish the pudding, which requires 
r.t 'oast six hours boiling. Beat nine eggs till 
"very thick and smooth, then add gradually a \ int 
of rich milk, in turn with the bread-crumbs and 
flour. Mix with the sugar the grated yellow 
rind and juice of two large lemons or two oranges, 
and add gradually to the mixture all the ingre- 
dients, stirring very hard. If you find it too 
thick, add by degrees some more milk ; if too 
thin, some more bread-crumbs. But take care 
not to have too much bread or flour, or the pud- 
ding will be solid and heavy. Dip a large strong 
cloth in boiling water; shake it out, and spread 
it in a large pan. Dredge it lightly with flour, 
and pour in the mixture. Tie it tightly, but leave 
sufficient space for the pudding to swell in boil- 
ing. Put it into a pot of fast-boiling water, and 
boil it steadily six hours or more, not taking it 
up till wanted for table. Before turning it, dip 
the cloth for a moment in cold water to make the 
pudding come out easily. Have ready some slipa 
of citron or of blanclied sweet almonds, or both, 
and stick them, liberally, all over the surface of 
ihe pudvling al'ier you have dished it. Serve it 
up with wine sauce highly flavored, or with but- 
ter and sugar beaten to a cream, and seasoned 
with nutmeg and rose. Do not set the pudding 
1^' fire to burn out the liquor; that practice haa 
^ad its day, and is over. It was always foolish. 
If you wish to send it to a distant place, (for

instance, to some part of the world where plum 
puddings are not known or not made) you may 
preserve it, (after boiling it well,) by leaving it tied 
up in the cloth it was cooked in ; hanging ii :n3 
in a cool dry place, and then packing it well, in a 
I in vessel having a close fitting cover. Paste a 
band of thick white paper all around the place 
where the lid shuts down, and put into a tight 
box the vessel that contains the pudding. When 
it arrives at its destination, the friend who re- 
ceives it will pare off thinly the outside, and ty- 
ing up the pudding in a fresh clean cloth, wiD 
boil it over again for an hour or more ; and when 
done the surface may be then decorated with slips 
of citron or almond. It has been said that in 
this way a plum pudding can be kept for six 
months, as good as ever. It cannot. But it may 
keep six weeks. Do not fry or broil jplMm pud- 
ding* that is left at dinner. The slices will be 
greasy and heavy. But tie the piece that remains 
in a small cloth, and boil it over again for an hour. 
It will then be nearly as good as on the first day. 
Believe In no wonders that you hear, of the long 
keeping of either plum pudding, plum cake, or 
mince meat, which are all of the same family. 
However long they may be preserved from abso- 
lute decomposition, these things are always best 
when fresh. 

MINCE PIES.— The best mince meat is made 
of fresh beef's tongue boiled, peeled, and wnen 
quite cold chopped very fine. The next best is 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 489 

of beef's heart boiled and chopped. The next 
of cold loast beef. And the next, of the lean 
of cold boiled beef, quite fresh, and cooked 
especially for the purpose. All the meat must be 
fresh, and not minced till entirely cold. To two 
large pounds of lean meat allow two small pounda 
of nice kidney suet, cleared from skin and strings, 
and chopped very small; two poundsof fine juicy 
apples, pared, cored, and minced ; two pounds of 
Zante currants, w^ashed, and picked clean; two 
pounds of fine bloom raisins, seeded and chopped, 
or of seedless sultana raisins cut in half; two 
pounds of the best sugar; two large nutmegs, 
powdered; a table-spoonful of ground cinnamon; 
the same quantity of ground ginger, with the 
juice and grated yellow rind of six large lemons, 
or the juice of six oranges, and their grated rind ; 
a pint of Madeira or sherry, and half a pint of 
brandy ; lastly, half a pound of citron cut into 
slips, rather large. If the citron is chopped small 
it cannot be distinguished among the other ingre- 
dients, and its flavor is lost. When all is pre- 
pared, mix well in a large pan the chopped meat, 
suet, and fruit. Then, gradually add the spice, 
having steeped it in the liquor all the preceding 
night, mixing the v/holo thoroughly, and putting 
in the citron at the hist. Line with fine puff- 
paste deep pie-dishes, or patty- pans. Fill them 
quite full of the mince, heaping it higher towards 
the centre; and put on a lid, handsomely decorated 
with puff-paste ornaments, and having a cross siu 
in the centre surrounded with paste leaves oi

flowers. Set the pies immediately into a mode- 
rately brisk oven, and bake tliem a light brown. 
Eat them warm. If baked the preceding day, 
heat them again before they go to table. The 
foolish custom of setting the pies on fire after 
they come to table, and causing a blue blaze to 
issue from the liquor that is in them, is now obso- 
lete, and considered ungenteel and tavern-like. 
If this practice originated in a polite desire to 
frighten the ladies^ its purpose is already a failure, 
for the ladies are not frightened; that is, not 
really. 

Mincemeat will taste more fresh and pleasant 
if the apples are not added till the day the pies arc 
made. It should be kept well-secured from aii 
and damp, in stone jars closely covered. When 
ever a jar is opened to take out some for irame* . 
diate use, pour in a large glass or two of brandy, 
and stir it about. It is not true that mincemeat 
will keep all winter, even by this preservative. 
It is sure to become musty (or worse,) before two 
months. It is best to make fresh niinoemeat at 
least three times during the season. When the 
cold weather is over, do not attempt it, unless a 
little for immediate use. 

Mincemeat, with a double portion of excellent 
raisins, (cut in half,) will do very well without 
currants, which are 7v.ry Lroublcscmc to prepare; 
and those imported of late years are rarely of 
good quality. 

We have heard of West India mincemeat made 
with cold roast turkey ; chopped pine-apple; grated 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 491 

cocoa-nut; preserved ginger chopped, and moist, 
ened with its own syrup ; and seasoned with nut- 
meg and novau. 

The above mince pies are for company. 



CALF'S FEET JELLY.— Select the largest 
and best calf's feet. Four is called a set. Choose 
those that, after the hair has been well scalded 
and scraped off, are prepared with the skins left 
on. There is much glutinous substance in the 
skin itself, therefore it adds to the strength and 
firmness of the jelly. The feet being made per- 
fectly clean, split them upwards as far as you can, 
and put them to boil in a g:*llon of veri/ dear soft 
water. Boil them till they have all gone to pieces, 
and the fiesh is reduced to rags, and the liquid to 
one half. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve 
into a white-ware pan, and set it away to cool 
When quite cold, it should be a cake of firm jelly. 
Take it out, and scrape from it all the fat at the 
top and sediment at the bottom. Press on the 
surface, some clean blotting paper, to remove any 
grease that may yet remain about it. Cut the 
3ake of jelly into pieces, and put it into a vej'y 
clean porcelain kettle, with a large pint of sherry, 
(inferior wine will spoil it,) a pound of the best 
loaf sugar, broken small; the yellow rind of 
»!£ lemons, pared so thin as to be transparcnf, 
and their juice squeezed over the sugar through a 
strainer; the ivhites of six or seven eggs, v/iih 
their siieils mashed small. If the jelly is to be 



492 MISS lesiie's new cook book. 

moulded, add a quarter ounce of the besii 1 jsili 
isinglass. Boil together all these ingredients for 
near twenty minutes. Then take it off the fire, 
and let it stand undisturbed for about five min- 
utes, to settle. Next, have ready a pointed jelly 
bag, made of clean white flannel Spread it open, 
suspended by strings to a table edge. Set a large, 
tureen or white- ware pan beneath it, and let the 
jelly drip as long as it will ; but on no accoun'^ 
squeeze or press the bag, as that will spoil all, 
rendering the whole jelly cloudy or streaked. 
If it is not quite clear at the first straining, empty 
the contents of the bag into a basin, wash the bag 
clean, hang it up again, pour the jelly back, wash 
the tureen or pan, and let the jelly pass into it 
again. Repeat this straining if necessary. When 
quite clear, shape the jelly in white- ware moulds, 
which have been setting two hours in cold water. 
When the jelly is wanted, wrap lound the moulds 
for a moment, a cloth dipped in warm water, and 
turn it out on glass dishes. The ingredients that 
are left in the bag may be boiled and strained 
over again for children. If the jelly is not to be 
moulded, you may omit the isinglass. In that 
case break it up, and serve it in a glass bowl. It 
ie now the general opinion that jellies have a more 
lively taste wh'^n broken up, from the numerous 
acute angles they present to the tongue and palate. 
We think this opinion correct; and also they look 
brighter and more glittering, and go farther. 

Apple Jelly — Is far less expensive than that of 
ualf 's feet, and if well made looks beautifully. It

rtsquircs the very best and most juicy apples, (for 
instance, two dozen large pippins or bell-flowera.) 
Wasli and wipe them well, (removing all blem- 
ishen,) pare, core, and slice or quarter them. Put 
them into a hain-marie or double kettle, with the 
water outside, and let them boil till broken and 
dissolved, putting in with them the grated yellow 
rind of four large lemons. Press and mash the 
stewed apples through a very clean sieve, till you 
have extracted all the juice. Measure it while 
warm, and allow to each quart a pound of the 
finest powdered and sifted loaf sugar well mixed 
in, and the juice of the lemons. Transfer it to a 
clean white flannel jelly bag, and let it drip into 
a large white- ware pan. When quite clear, put it 
into moulds, and set it on ice to congeal. When 
wanted, turn it out of the moulds, (loosened by 
wrapping round their ousides cloths dipped a min- 
ute in warm water) and serve it up in glass dishes. 

Siberian Jelly. — A fine pink-colored jelly may 
be made in the above manner, of the red Siberia 
crab-apple, but it requires an additional quarter of 
pound of sugar to a pint of juice. Instead of le- 
mon you may flavor it, (after all the juice has 
done dripping) by mixing with extract of rose, 
or strong rose-water, allowing a wine-glassful to 
each quart of jelly. Eose-water, or extract of 
rose, evaporates so speedily when over the fire, 
that it should never be added till the very last.

oranges pared from the white as thin as possible. 
Give it one boil up, and strain it into the jcdly- 
bag. When clear, transfer it to moulds. Q'wclve 
large oranges will generally yield a pint of juice.

CUEEANT JELLY.— The currants should b. 
large, fine, and fully ripe. 1'he best and sweetest 
currants grow in the shade; and the largest, also. 
If exposed to the full heat of our American sun, 
it turns them sour, dries up the juice, and withers 
their growth. Gather them when fully ripe, strip 
them from the sterrs into a cullender, and wash 
and drain them. Transfer them to a large pan, 
and mash them well with a wooden beetle. Tlien 
put the currants, with their juice, into a bain-marie 
or double kettle, and cook them with the water 
outside, stirring them bard to bring out the juice. 
Simmer them lor a qanrter of an hour, and then 
transfer them to a very cL-an sieve, and press them 
over a pan till no more jaice appears. Measure 
the juice, and to each pint allow a pound of 
broken-up loaf sugar. Mi\ the sugar with the 
juice, put all into a porcelai-. kettle, and boil it till 
i.he scum ceases to rise. If the sugar is of excel- 
len* quality, (the best double refined should le 
used for all nice sweetmeats) it wul need but little 
skimming, and leave no sediment ^y^eK poureU olE 



MISS IJESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 495 

Boil it twenty rnintites with the sugar. To try 
if it is done, take up a spoonful and hoid it out 
m the open air. If it congeals very soon, it is 
cooked onongli Put it warm into glais turnblera. 
Out out some white tissue paper into double 
rounds, e-asActly fitting the glasses. Press these 
papers lightly on the surface of tie jelly; and, 
next day, tie over the top thick pa\.ers dipped in 
brandy, and set them in the sun all chat day if 
the weather is bright and warm. 

All jellies of small fnit may bw made in a 
similar manner; first boiling the f.ait by itself, 
and mashing it to get out all the juico. Then boiling 
the berries again, with the sn-jar^ foi about twenty 
minutes. The above receipt is equally good for 
grapes, blackberries, and gooseberries. Blackcur- 
rant jelly (excellent for sore throats,) requires but 
three quarters of a pound of sugar, the juice be- 
ing very thick of itself. Peaches, plums, dam- 
sons, and green gages, must be scalded, peeled, 
and stoned, before boilinf; for iellv, and thev re- 
ouire, at least, a pound and a half of sugar to a 
pint o? juice. It is better to preserve them as 
marmalade than as jelly. Strawberries and rasp- 
berries require no previous cocking; mash out 
the juice, strain it, allow a pound of sugar to 
every pint of juice, and then boil them togetlier 
(skimming carefully) for about a quarter of ed 
Uour, or till t.hey crngeal on being tri*?d in the hif 



496 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

WINE JELLY. — Wine jellies are seldom made 
except for company. The wine must be of ex- 
cellent quality; either port, madeira, or cham- 
aigne. To a quart of wine allov/ a pound of 
the best double-refined loaf sugar, and an ounce of 
the best Eussian isinglass. Melt the sugar (broken 
email) in the wine. Melt the isinglass by itself in 
as much warm water as will just cover it, and 
when quite dissolved, srjr it into the mixed wine 
and sugar. Boil all together, till on trial it be- 
comes a firm jelly, which will be very soon. If 
It does not congeal well, add some more dissolved 
isinglass, and m.ore sugar. Serve in moulds, and 
eat it on saucers. Jelly is made in this manner 
of any nice sort of liqueur or cordial. Also of 
strong green tea, or very strong coffee ; first made 
as usual, and then boiled with loaf sugar and 
isiJiiglass till they congeal. We do not recom- 
mend them, except as some exhiliration to the 
fUigue of a party.

Put into the bottom of the bowl a pound of biuer 
almond maccaroons. Pour on sufiicient madeira 
or sherry to dissolve them. Let them soak in ii

ftQd sweetened with a quarter of a pound of pow- 
dered loaf sugar. It is best and easiest to hake 
the custard. It will be very rich and soft with 
yolk of Qgg only. When the custard is cold lay 
it on the dissolved maccaroons. Then add ^ thick 
liiyer of very nice marmalade. Rub off the 
yellow rind of a large lemon or two on sonie 
pieces of loaf sugar, and add to it some powdered 
sugar mixed with the lemon juice. Whip to a 
strong froth a large quart (or more) of rich cream, 
gradually mixing with it the lemon and sugar. 
Lastly, pile up the frothed cream high on the 
glass bowl, and keep it on ice till it is sent to table. 
Instead of lemon you may flavor the whipt cream 
with rose-water; it will require, if not very strong, 
a wine-glassful. To give the cream a fine pink 
color, tie up some alkanet chips in a thin muslin 
bag; lay the bag to infuse in a tea-cup of plain 
cream, and then add the pink infusion to the quart 
of cream as you froth it. 



BLANCMANGE.— The best and finest blanc- 
mange is made with a set of calves' feet, (singed 
but not skinned) boiled slowly in a gallon of 
water till the meat drops from the bone ; then 
strain it, and set it away till next day, in a broad 
white-ware pan. Skim it weU while boiling. 
Next day it should be a solid cake of clear jeily.

and when it has come to a boil, stir in six ounces 
of loaf sugar, and whatever you intend ibr flavor- 
ing; either the milk, in which a handful of bittei 
almonds has been boiled, (first being blanched and 
broken up) or a vanilla bean split and cut to 
pieces, and boiled in a little milk and strained. Or, 
it may be mixed with three ounces of chocolate, 
(Baker's prepared cocoa is the best) scraped fine. 
When the flavoring has had a boil with the sugar, 
stir into it, gradually, the melted jelly, and transfer 
it to white- ware moulds that have set in cold 
water, and are still damp. Stir it well, and when 
the blancmange is thickening, and becoming hard 
to stir, set the moulds on ice, or in pans of cold 
water in the cellar, and cease stirring. When 
quite congealed, dip the moulds in lukewarm 
water, and turn out the blancmange on glass 
dishes. You may color almond or vanilla blanc- 
mange a fine pink, by putting into the cream chips 
of alkanet root tied in a small thin muslin bag, to 
be removed as soon as the cream is highly colored. 
Or, it may be made green by the infusion of spi 
nach juice, obtained by pounding iu a marble mor- 
tar, and then boiling and straining. 

Gelatine is now frequently used for blancmanc;9" 
and jelly, instead c. ^dives' feet or isijiiflasa. It 
has no advantage but that of being more speedily 
prepared than calves' feet, which must be boiled

to tour calves' feet. Before using, they muai l)0

Home persons thiiik they perceive an unpleasant 
taste in gelatine; perhaps they have heard of what 
it is made. 

When calves' feet canno*^ be obtained, pigs' feet 
Will do very well, if nobody knows it. Four feet 
of calves are equal to eight of pigs. They are very 
glutinous, and have no perceptible taste.

FINEST BLANCiMANGE,— Break up a Half 
pound of the best double-refined loaf sugar. On 
some of ' le pieces rub off the yellow rind of two 
large leitr ons, having rolled them under your hand 
to incre^ise the juice. Then powder all the sugar, 
and mix with it, gradually, the juice of the le- 
mons, a pint of rich cream, and a large half pici 
(not Jess) of sherry or madeira. Stir the mixture 
very hard till all the articles are thoroughly amal- 
gamated. Then stir in, gradually, a second pint 
of cream. Put into a small sauce-pan an ounce 
of the best Russia isinglass, with one jill (or two 
common-sized wineglasses) of cold water. Boil 
it till the isinglass is completely dissolved, etir- 
Ting it several times down to the bottom. When 
the melted isinglass has become lukewarm, stir it 
gradually into the mixture, and then give the 
whole a hard stirring. Have ready some while- 
ware moulds that have just been dipped and 
rinsed in cold water. Fill them with the mixture, 
set them on ice, and in two or three hours the 
blancmange will be congealed. When it is per 
fectly firm, dip the moulds for a minute in luke

warm water, and turn out the blancmange on 
glass dishes. This, if accurately made, is the 
finest of blancmange. For company, you must 
have double or treble, or four times the quantity 
of ingredients ; each article in due proportion.

FARINA. — Farina is a very fine and delicate 
preparation, made from the inner part of the grain 
of new wheat. It is exceedingly nutritious, and 
excellent either for invalids or for persons in 
health. It is now much in use, and is to be had, 
in packages of a pound or half a pound, of the 
best grocers and druggists, and is highly recom- 
mended by physicians for gruel and panade. It 
also makes an excellent pudding, either boiled or 
baked, prepared in the same manner as any flour 
pudding. For boiling farina, nothing is so good 
as a bain-marie or double kettle. 

JF^or Farina Blancmange.— FTom a quart of rich 
milk take out a half pint. Put the half pint into 
a small sauce-pan, and add to it a handful of bit- 
ter almonds broken up ; or a bunch of fresh peach 
leaves, or a vanilla bean split, cut up, and tied in 
a thin muslin bag. When this milk has boiled 
till vc'y highly flavored, strain it into the pint and 
a half, and set it over the fire in a porcelain kettle 
or a bain-marie. When the milk has come to a 
boil, sprinkle in, gradually, a large half pint or 
more (or. four large heaping table-spoonfuls) of 
Carina, stirring it well — also sprinkling in and 
stirring, as if making thick mush. Let it boii

slowly a quarter of an hour after tbe farina is all 
in. When done, remove it from the fire, and stir 
in two large table-spoonfuls of sugar, and a wine- 
glass of rose- water, or one of white wine. Trans- 
fer it to a blancmange mould, (previously wet with 
cold water,) set it on ice, and turn it out when 
ready for dinner. Eat it with sauce of wine, 
sugar, and nutmeg.

FINE MAEROW PUDDING. — Mince very 
small a quarter of a pound of nice beef marrow, 
and grate or crumble half a pound of almond 
sponge cake. Cut in half, a quarter of a pound 
of sultana or seedless raisins, chop two peels of 
candied citron, mix them with the raisins, and 
dredge both thickly with flour. Add a large 
heaped table-spoonful of loaf sugar, a small nut- 
meg grated, and a wineglass of mixed wine and 
brandy. Mix all these ingredients well, put them 
into a deep dish, lay a border of puff-paste all 
round the rim, and fill the dish up to the top with 
a nice custard made in the proportion of four 
eggs to a pint of well-sweetened milk, flavored 
with either bitter almonds, rose-water, peach- 
water, or vanilla. Bake this pudding half an hour 
When cool, sift sugar over it.

the yolks into another. Acid to the yolks three 
large table-spoonfuls of powdered loaf sugar, 
a heaped tea-spoonful of arrow-root flour, and 
twelve drops of strong orange-flower water, and 
beat it till very thick ar^l smooth. Then beat 
the whites to a stiff froth, beginning slowly at 
first, but gradually beating faster. Then add the 
beaten yolk very gently to the whites. Have 
ready a silver or plated dish well-buttered. Use 
tin for want of better, but it will not look well, 
as the omelette has to be served up in the dish it 
was baked in. Place the dish with the mixture 
in a hot oven, and watch it while baking. When 
it has well risen, and seems very light, take it 
out of the oven for a moment; run a knife round 
it, sift some sugar over it, set it again in the oven, 
and when raised to its utmost take it out again, 
and serve it up as hot as possible, with a spoon on 
the plate beside it. When once broken, it will sink 
immediately. It is usual to send round the ome- 
lette souffle at the very last of the pastry course ; 
the cook not beginning to make it till the dinner 
has commenced. If not light when baked, give 
it up, and do not send it to table at all. It is 
safsst for an inexjxiricnced housewife to engage a 
French cook to come to the house with his own 
ingredients and utensils, and make and bake the 
omelette souffle while there. Still though very 
fashionable, it is less delicious than many othei 
desserts

SuiSTDERL ANDS. — Warm a quart of rich 
milk, and cut up in it half a pound of the best 
fresh butter to soften in the millc, but not to oil. 
Beat eight eggs till very light and thick, and 
then stir I hem gradually into the pan of mili 
and buttei, in turn with eight large table-s\>oon- 
fuls of sifted flour. Beat all very hard together, 
and then transfer the batter to white tea-cups, 
slightly buttered, not filling them quite full. Set 
them immediately into a brisk oven, and bake 
them about twenty minutes, or till they are 
slightly browned, and have puffed up very light. 
As soon as they are cool enough to handle with- 
out burning your fingers, turn them out of the 
cups on a dish, cut a slit in the top of each, and, 
taking a tea-spoon, fill them quite full of any sort 
of jelly or marmalade; or if more convenient, 
with ripe stra\\^berries or raspberries, sweetened 
ivith powdered sugar, and mashed smoothly. 
W^hen filled with fruit, close the slit neatly with 
your fingers; and on the top of each lay a large 
strawberry or raspberry, having first dredged the 
Sunderland with sugar. 

Oream Cakes — Are made in the above manner, 
but baked in patty -pans. When baked take them

CREAM TART.—Make a fine puff-paste of 
equal quantities of fresh butter and sifted flour* 
mixing into the pan of flour a heaped table- 
spoonful of powdered sugar, and wetting it with 
a beaten egg, Eub one quarter of the butter into 
the pan of flour. Divide the remainder of butter 
into six, and roll it into the flour at six turns till 
it is all in. Have, ready grated, the yellow rind and 
the juice of a large lemon or orange mixed with a 
quarter of a pound of powdered loaf sugar ; or a 
flavoring of a spHt-up vanilla bean ; or a dozen 
bitter almpnds broken up, and boiled in a very 
little milk. Mix the flavoring with a pint of rich 
cream, and the well-beaten whites of three eggSi 
Take small deep pans, line them all through with 
the paste rolled out very thin, and cut square. 
Fill them with the cream, and turn the square 
pieces of paste a little over it at the top, so as to 
form corners. Bake the tarts in a brisk oven, 
and when cold^ grate nutmeg over the surface. 

Are these the cream tarts of the Arabian Nights- ?

Jered white sugar. Take some fine large orang-'S, 
very ripe and juicy. Peel off all the rind, and 
slice the oranges rather thick. Cover the bottom 
of a large glass bowl with sliced orange, (the irst 
layer being double, where the bowl is small) and 
strew among the slices sufficient sugar. Then 
put in a thick layer of the grated cocoa-nut, next 
another layer of orange — again a layer of co 
coa-nut, and so on, alternately, till the bowl i^ 
filled, finishing with cocoa-nut heaped high. This 
is a handsome and delicious article for a supper- 
table, and a nice impromptu addition to the des- 
sert at a dinner; and soon prepared, as it requires 
no cooking. When the fruit is in season a des- 
sert for a small company may consist entirely of 
orange cocoa-nut, raspberry charlotte, and cream 
strawberries. 

Never send pranges whole to table. To ladies 
they are unmanageable in company. 

Creamed Strawberries, — Take fine large ripe 
strawberries. Hull or stem them, and set them 
on ice till just before they are wanted. Divide 
them into saucerfulls. If you have glass saucers, 
they will make a better show than china. Put 
some powdered white sugar in the bottom of sach 
saucer. Fiii them with strawberries, and then 
•^trew on a liberal allowance of sugar, for Ameri- 
can strawberries (however fine in appearance) are 
seldom sweet. Have ready sufficient whipped 
cream, that has been frothed with rods or w/vh a 
tin cream-churn. Pile high a portion of the 
whipt cream on each saucer of strawberries.

Stii*tirberries are Bcmetimes eaten with wine ati(3 
sugar, when cream is not convenient. With milk 
they curdle, and are nnwholesome — besides tast- 
ing poorly. 

Creamed Pine-apple. — ^Cut into four pieces two 
large ripe pine-apples. Stand them up succes- 
eivsly in a deep dish, and grate them from the 
rind. When all is grated, transfer it to a large 
glass bowl, and make it very sweet by mixing in 
powdered white loaf sugar. Whip to a stiff froth 
a sufficiency of rich cream, adding to it some sugar, 
and heap it high upon the grated pine-apple. 

Peaches and Cream. — Take fine juicy freestone 
peaches. Pare them, and cut them in slices. Put 
them, with their juice, into a large bowl, and 
make them very sweet with powdered loaf sugar. 
Set them on ice, and let them remain in the juice 
till wanted. Then send them to table with fresh 
sugar sifted over the top. Set near them pitchers 
of plain cream, not frothed. 

If you cannot obtain cream, it is better to be 
satisfied with sugar alone, than to substitute milk, 
with peaches, or any other fruit.

that have been made very clean and bright, and 
fchat are slightly greased with sweet oil. Set the 
t-affy away to cool, first marking it with a kniffe, 
while soft. Mark it in straight lines the broad 
or crossway of the pans. If marked lengthways, 
the pieces will be too long. When the taffy is 
cold, cut it according to the lines, in regular slips, 
like cocoa-nut candy. It is for a handsome sup- 
per party. Serve it up in glass dishes. 

Orange taffy is made in the same manner. 
These candies should be kept in tin boxes.

taffy, using finely grated cocoa-nut, insteaa of 
lemon or orange.

CHARLOTTE RUSSE. — Split, cut up, and 
boil a large vanilla bean in half a pint of rich 
milk, till it is highly flavored, and reduced to 
one-half. Then strain out the vanilla through a 
strainer so fine as to avoid all the seeds. Mix 
the strained milk with half a pint of rich cream. 
Beat five eggs till very smooth and thick. Strain 
them, and add them gradually to the cream when 
it is entirely cold, to make a rich custard. Set 
this custard over the fire (stirring it all the time) 
till it simmers; but take it off before it comes to 
a boil, or it will curdle. Set it on ice. Ha/e 
ready in another sauce-pan an ounce of the best

Russia isinglass, "boiled in half a pint oi water, 
till it is all dissolved into a thick jelly. When 
both are cold, (but not hard) mix the custard and 
the isinglass together, and add four table-cpoon- 
fuls of powdered loaf sugar. Then take a large 
lump of loaf sugar, and rub off on it the yello\v 
rind of two large lemons. Scrape off the lemon 
grate with a tea-spoon, and add it to the mixture, 
with the lump of sugar powdered and crushed 
fine. Mix together the strained juice of the lem- 
ons, and two glasses of madeira; dissolve in them 
the lemon-flavored sugar, and mix it with a pint 
of rich cream that has been whipped with a whisk 
to a strong froth. Add the whipped cream gra- 
dually to the custard, stirring very hard at the 
time, and also after the whole is mixed. Then set 
it on ice. 

Cover the bottom of a flat oval dish with a 
slice of almond sponge cake, cut to fit. Prepare 
a sufficient number of oblong slices of the cake, 
(all of the same size and shape) to go all round ; 
with one extra slice, in case they should not quite 
hold out. Dip every one in a plate of beaten 
white of egg to make them adhere. Stand each 
of them up on one end, round the large oval slice 
that lies at the bottom. Make them follow each 
other evenly and neatly, (every one lapping a 
little way over its predecessor) till you have a 
handsome wall of slices, cemented all round by 
the white of egg. Fill it quite full with the cus- 
tard mixture. Cover the top with another oval 
slice of cake, cemented with a little white of egg 



MISS LESLIE'S NSW COOK BOOK. 509 

'cO the upper edge of the wall. Moke a nice ic-ing 
in the usual way, of powdered sugar beaten into 
frothed white of egg, and flavored with lemon, 
orange, or rose. Spread this icing thickly and 
smoothly over the cake that covers the top of the 
charlotte, and ornament it with a handsome pat- 
tern of sugar flowers. There is no charlotte russe 
superior to this. . 

Another Charlotte Russe, — Have a very nice cir- 
cular lady cake. It should be iced all over, and 
ornamented with sugar flowers. Take off the top 
nicely, and without breaking or defacing, and 
hollow out the inside, leaving the sides and 
bottom standing. The cake taken from the in- 
Bide may be cut in regular pieces and used at tea, 
or for other purposes. Make a very fine boiled 
custard, according to tbe preceding receipt. Fill 
with it the empty cake, as if lillinfj a mould. 
Then put on the lid, set the whole on ice, and 
when wanted serve it up on a glass or chma dish. 

A charlotte that requires no cooking may be 
very easily made by hollowing a nice circular 
almond sponge cake, and filling it with layers of 
small preserves, and piling on the top whipped 
cream finely flavored. 

For the walls of a charlotte russe you may use 
fche oblong sponge cakes, called Naples biscuits, 
or those denominated lady fingers, dipping them 
first in beaten white of egg, standing them on 
end, and arranging them so as to lap over eaoh 
other in forming the wall. Arrange some of them 
handsomely to oover the top of the custard.

ICE CREAM. — Pewter freezers for ice creari 
are better than those of block tin; as in them the 
freezing goes on more gradually and thoroughly, 
and it does not melt so soon, besides being smoother 
when done. The ice tub should be large enough 
to allow ample space all round (six inches, at 
least,) the freezer as it stands in the centre, and 
should have a plug at the bottom (beneath the 
freezer) for letting out the water that drips from the 
ice; that a large coarse woolen cloth should be 
folded, and laid under it and around it. The ice 
bhould be broken up into small bits, and mixed 
with coarse salt, in the proportion of a pound of 
salt to five pounds of ice. Fill the tub within 
three inches of the top ; pounding and pressing 
down hard the mixed ice and salt. Have ready 
all the ingredients. To every quart of real rich 
cream mix in a pint of milk, (not more) and half 
a pound of fine loaf sugar. The following are 
the most usual flavorinojs, all the fruit beinsr made 
very sweet. Ripe strawberries or raspberries, 
mashed through a sieve till all the juice is ex- 
tracted; ripe juicy freestone peaches, pared, and 
cut in half, the kernels being taken from the 
stones, are pounded, and mi.shed with the fruit 
through a cullender ; all the juice that can be 
mashed out of a sliced pine-apple, the grated yel- 
low rind and the juice of lemons or oranges, al- 
lowmg two to each quart of cream, and mixing 
the juice with plenty of sugar before it is put to 
the cream. A handful of shelled bitter almonds 
olanched. broken, and boiled by themselves in 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOo£ 511 

half a pint of milk till all the almond flavor ia 
extracted, and then strain the bitter almond milk 
into the cream. For vanilla flavor, split and cut 
up a vanilla bean, boil it by itself in a halt pint 
of milk, and when highly flavored, strain the va- 
nilla milk into the cieam. For chocolate ice- 
cream, scrape down a quarter of a pound of Ba- 
ker's prepared cocoa, and melt it in just water 
enough to cover it ; then sweeten and mix it gra- 
dually into a quart of rich milk, (boiling at the 
time) and then boil and stir it till strong and 
smooth. Ice cream is spoiled by the addition of 
eggs. Besides giving it a yellowish color, eggs 
convert it into mere frozen custard, particularly 
if instead of using real cream, it is made of milk 
thickened with arrow-root or flour. For company 
at least, ice cream should be made in the best and 
most liberal manner, or else do not attempt it 
Mean ice cream is a very mean thing. 

When all the ingredients are prepared and 
mixed, put the whole into the freezer, and set it 
in the ice tub ; and having put on the lid tightly, 
take the freezer by the handle and turn it about 
very fast for five* or six minutes. Then remove 
the lid carefully, and scrape down the cream from 
the sides with a spadule or long-handled spoon. 
Repeat this frequently while it is freezing, taking 
care to keep the sides clear, stirring it well to the 
Ixittom, and keeping the tub well filled with salt 
and ice outside the freezer. 

After the cream has been well frozen in the 
freezer, transfer it to moulds, pressing it in hard 



512 MISS Leslie's new cook book, 

BO as to fill every part of the mould. Then set tba 
mould iu a fresh tub of ice and salt, (using as 
before the proportion of a pound of salt to five 
pounds of ice) and let it remain undisturled in 
the mould for an hour, not turning it out till it ia 
time to serve it up to the company. Then wrap 
a cloth, dipped in warm water, round the outside 
of the moulds, open them, and turn out the frozen 
cream on glass or china dishes, and serve it up 
immediately. 

Unless ice cream is very highly flavored at the 
beginning, its taste will be much weakened in the 
process of freezing. 

The most usual form of ice cream moulds are 
pyramids, dolphins, doves, and baskets of fruit. 
We have seen ice cream in the shape of a curly 
lap-dog, and very well represented. 

If you eat what is called strawberry ice cream 
looking of an exquisite rose-pink color, there ia 
no strawberry about it. either in tint or taste. It 
is produced by alkanet or cochineal. Eeal straw- 
berries do not color so beautifully ; neither do 
raspberries, or ary other sort oi red fruit. But 
genuine fruit syrups may be employed for this 
purpose, havirig at least the true taste. To make 
strawberry rr raspberry syrup, prepare first what 
is called simple syrup, by melting a pound of the 
best dor.ble-refined loaf sugar in half a pint of 
cold ^ater; and when melted, boiling them to- 
gether and skimming it perfectly clean. Then 
«itir in as much fruit juice (mashed and strained,) 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 513 

as will give it a fine tinge, and let it have one more 
boiling up. 

Vanilla Syrup. — Take six fine fresh vanilla 
beans. Split, and cut them in pieces. Scrape the 
seeds loose in the pods with your finger nail, and 
bruise and mash the shells. All this will increase 
the vanilla flavor. Put all you can get of the 
vanilla into a small quart of what is called by the 
druggist " absolute alcohol." Cork the bottle 
closely, and let the vanilla infuse in it a week 
Then strain it through a very fine strainer that 
will not let out a single seed. Have ready 
half a dozen pint bottles of simple syrup. Pul 
into every bottle of the simple syrup a portion 
of the strained infusion of vanilla. Cork it tightly 
and use it for vanilla flavoring in ice creams, 
custards, blancmange, &c. 

Orange or Lemon Syrups — Are made by paring 
off the yellow rind very thin (after the fruit has 
been rolled under your hand on a table to increase 
the juice,) then boiling the rind till the water 
is highly flavored. Strain this water over the 
best loaf sugar, allowing two pounds of sugar to 
a pint of juice. The sugar being melted, mix it 
with the juice.

WATER ICES OK SHERBET.— Water icef, 
are made of the juice of fruits, very well sweet 
ened, mixed with a little water, and frozen in the 
manner of ice cream, to which they are by many 
persons preferred. They are all prepared nearly

in tne same manner, allowing a pint of juice tc a 
pint of water, and a quarter of a pound of PugfiF. 
Mix it well, and then freeze it in the manner of 
ioe cream, and serve it up in glass bowls. For 
lemon and orange sherbet, first roll the fruit on 
a table under your hand ; then take off a very 
thin paring of the yellow rind, and boil it slowly 
in a very little water, till all the flavor is ex- 
tracted. Next, strain the flavored water into the 
cold water you intend to mix with the juice, and 
make it very sweet with loaf sugar. Squeeze the 
juice into it through a tin strainer to avoid the 
seeds. Stir the whole very hard, and transfer it 
to a freezer. Orange water-ice is considered the 
best, if well made. For pine-apple water-ice, pare, 
core, and slice fine ripe apples very thin. Put 
them into a dish with thick layers of powdered 
loaf sugar ; cover the dish, and let them lie seve- 
\'al hours in the sugar. Then press out all the 
juice you can, from the pine-apple ; mix it with a 
littiC water, and freeze it. To two large pine- 
apples allow a half pound of sugar, which has 
been melted in a quart of boiling water. This 
lookti very wfell frozen in a mould shaped like a 
pine-apple. Orange sherbet may be frozen in a 
pine-apple mould. It can be made so rich with 
orange juice as to perfume the whole table. 

Roman Punch — Is made of strong lemonade oi 
orangeade, adding to every quart a pint of biandy 
or rum. Then freeze it, and serve in saucers or 
a large glass bowl. Put it into a porcelain kettle. 
and boil and skim it till the scum ceases to rise 



Miss LESLIE'S NEW COOK B06K. 616 

When cold, bottle it, seal the corks and keep itm 
a cool place. 

Syrup of strawberries, raspberries, currania 
Bud blackberries, is made in a similar manner. 

FLOATING ISLAND. — For one common 
sized floating island have a round thick jelly 
cake, lady cake, or almond sponge cake, that will 
weigh a pound and a half, or two pounds. Slice 
it downwards, almost to the bottom, but do not 
take the slices apart. Stand up the cuke in the 
centre of a glass bowl or a deep dish. Bave 
ready a pint and a half of rich cream, make it 
very sweet with sugar, and color it a fine green 
with a tea-cupful of the juice of pounded spin- 
ach, boiled five minutes by itself; strained, and 
made very sweet. Or for coloring pink you may 
use currant jelly, or the juice of preserved straw- 
berries. Whip to a stiff froth another pint and 
a half of sweetened cream, and flavor it with a 
large glass of mixed wine and brandy. Pour 
round the cake, as it stands in the dish or bowl, 
the colored unfrothed cream, and pile the whipped 
white cream all over the cake, highesf on the top

FINE CAKES. 

PLU^r CAKE.— In making very fine plum 
cake first prepare the fruit and spice, and sift the 
flour (which must be the very best superfine,) into 
a large flat dish, and dry it before the fire. Use 
none but the very best fresh butter; if of inferioi 
quality, the butter will taste through every thing 
and spoil the cake. In fact, all the ingredients 
should be excellent, and liberally allowed. Take 
the best bloom or muscatel raisins, seeded and 
cut in half. Pir>k and wash the currants or 
plums through two waters, and dry them well. 
Powder the spice, and let it infuse over night in 
the wine and brandy. Cut the citron into slips, 
mix it with the raisins and currants, and dredge 
all the fruit very thickly, on both sides, with 
flour. This will prevent its sinking or clodding 
in the cake, while baking. Eggs should always 
be beaten till the frothing is over, and till they 
become thick and smooth, as thick as a good 
boiled custard, and quite smooth on the surface 
If you can obtain hickory-rods as egg-beaters, 
there is nothing so good; but if you cannot get 
them, use the common egg-beaters, of thin fine 
wire. For stirring butter and sugar you should 
have a spaddle, which resembles a short mush- 
stick flattened at one end. Stir the butter and 
sugar in a deep earthen pan, and continue till it 
is light, thick, and creamy. Beat eggs always in 
a broad shallow earthen pan, and with a short 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 617 

quick stroke, keeping your right elbc fr close 
to your s:-Ge, £.nd moving only your wrist. In 
this way you may beat for an hour without 
fatigue. But to stir butter and sugar is the 
hardest part of cake making. Have this done 
by a man servant. His strength will accom- 
plish it in a short time — also, let him give the 
final stirring to the cake. If the ingredients are 
prepared as far as practicable on the preceding 
day, the cake may be in the oven by ten or eleven 
o'clock in the forenoon. 

For a large plum cake allow one pound, (or a 
quart) of sifted flour; one pound of fresh butter 
cut up in a pound of powdered loaf sugar, in a 
deep pan; twelve eggs; two pounds of bloom rai- 
sins; two pounds of Zante currants ; half a pound 
of citron, either cut into slips or chopped small ; a 
table-spoonful of powdered mace and cinnamon, 
mixed ; two grated nutmegs ; a large wine-glass 
of madeira (or more), a wine-glass of French 
brandy, mixed together, and the spice steeped 
in it. 

First stir the butter and sugar to a light cream, 
and add to them the spice and liquor. Then beat 
the eggs in a shallow pan till very thick and 
smooth, breaking them one at a time into a saucer 
to ascertain if there is a bad one among themu 
One stale Qgg will spoil the whole cake. When 
the eggs are very light, stir them gradually into 
the large pan of butter and sugar in turn with 
the flour, that being the mixing pan. Lastly, 
add the fruit and citron, a little at a tiroQ of <?aah.

and crivo the whole a hard stirring. If the fruit 
is well floured it will not sink, but it will be seen 
evenly dispersed all over the cake when baked. 
Take a large straight-sided block tin pan, grease 
It inside with the same butter used for the cake, 
and put the mixture carefully into it. Set it im- 
mediately into a well-heated oven, and keep up n 
steady heat while it is baking. When nearly done, 
the cake will shrink a little from the sides of the 
pan ; and on probing it to the bottom with a sprig 
from a corn broom, or a splinter-skewer, tho 
probe will come out clean. Otherwise, keep the 
cake in the oven a little longer. If it cracks on 
the top, it is a proof of its being very light. 
When quite done, take it out. It will become 
hard if left to grow cold with the oven. Set it to 
cool on an inverted sieve.

ICING.— Allow to the white of each egg a 
quarter of a pound of the best loaf sugar, finely 
powdered ; but if you find the mixture too thin, 
you muist add still more sugar. Put the white 
of egg into a shallow pan, and beat it with small 
rods or a large silver fork, till it becomes a stiff 
froth, and stands alone without falling. Then beat 
in the powdered sugar, a tea-spoonful at a time. 
As vou proceed, flavor it with lemon juice. This 
will render the icing whiter and smoother, also 
improving the taste. You may ice the cake as 
soon as it becomes lukewarm, without waiting tiU 
't ^ quite cold. • Dredge it lightly with flour io

abriurb the grease i'rom the outside; tiion wipo 
oif the flour. Wth a broad knife put some icing 
on the middle of the cake, and then spread it 
tlown, thickly and evenly, all over the top and 
sides, smoothing it with another knife dipped in 
cold water. When this is quite dry, spread on a 
second coat of icing rather thinner than the first, 
and flavored with rose. Set it a few minutes in 
the oven to harden the icing, leaving the oven- 
door open ; or place it beneath the stove. When 
the icing is quite dry, you may ornament it with 
sugar borders and flowers ; having ready, for that 
purpose, some additional icing. By means of a 
syringe, (made for the purpose, and to be ob- 
tained at the best furnishing stores) you can deco- 
rate the surface of the cake very handsomely ; but 
it requires taste, skill, and practice. You may 
first cover the cake with pink, brown, green, or 
other colored icing, and then take white icing to 
decorate it, forming the pattern by moving your 
hand skilfully and steadily over it, and pressing 
it out of the syringe as you go. An easier way 
is to ornament the cake (when the top-icing is 
nearly dry, but not quite,) with large strawberries 
oi raspberries, or purple grapes placed very near 
each other, and arranged in circles or patterns. Be 
careful not to mash the berries. 

Warm Icing. — This is made in the usual pro- 
portion of the whites of four eggs, beaten to stiff 
froth, and a pound '^f finely powdered loaf sugar 
afterwards added to it, gradually. Then boil the 

agg ani sugar in a porcelain kettle, and skim it

till tlie scum ceases to rise. Take it off the fire^ 
aud stir into it sufficient orange juice, lemon 
juice, or rose-water, to flavor it highly. Floui 
your cake — wipe off the flour, put on the icing 
with a broad knife, and then smooth it with an 
ether knife dipped in cold water. For this icing 
the cak 3 should be warm from the oven^ and dried 
slowly and gradually afterwards. Warm icing is 
much liked. It is very light ; rises thick and 
high in cooling, and has a fine gloss. Try it. The 
mixture called by the French a meringue^ and used 
for macaroons, kisses, and other nice articles, is 
made in the same manner as icing for cakes, al- 
lowing a quarter of a pound of powdered loaf 
sugar to every beaten white of Qgg, 



POUND CAKE.— One of Mrs. Goodfellow's 
maxims was, " up- weight of flour, and down- 
weight of every thing else" — and she was right, 
as the excellence of her cakes sufficiently proved, 
during the thirty years that she taught her art 
in Philadelphia, with unexampled success. There- 
fore, allow for a pound cake a rather small pound 
of sifted flour ; a large pound of the best fresh 
butter, a large pound of powdered loaf sugar, ten 
eggs, or eleven if they are small ; a large glass of 
mixed wine and brandy; a glass of rose-water; 
a grated nutmeg, and a heaped tea-spoonful of 
mixed spice, powdered inace, and cinnamon. Put 
the sugar into a deep earthen pan, and cut up the

tne fire a few minutes, till the butter softens 
Next, stir it very hard with a spaddle till the 
mixture becomes very light. Next, stir in, gra- 
dually, the spice, liquor, &c. Then beat the eggs 
in a shallow pan with rods or a whisk, till light, 
thick, and smooth. Add them gradually tc» the 
beaten batter and sugar, in turn with the flour ; 
and give the whole a hard stirring at the last. 
Have the oven ready with a moderate heat. Trans- 
fer the mixture to a thick straight-sided tin pan 
well greased with the best fresh butter, and smooth 
the butter on the surface. Set it immediately 
into the oven, and bake it with a steady heat two 
hours and a half, or more. Probe it to the bot- 
tom with a twig from a corn broom. When it 
shrinks a little from the pan it is done. When 
taken out, set it to cool on an inverted sieve. 
When you ice it, flavor the icing with lemon or 
rose. 

It should be eaten fresh, as it soon becomes 
very dry. 

Pound cake is not so mucb in use as formerly, 
particularly for weddings and large parties ; lady 
cake and plum cake being now substituted. A 
pound cake may be much improved by the addi- 
tion of a pound of citron, sliced, chopped well 
dredged with flour to prevent its sinking, and 
stirred gradually into the batter, in turn with, the 
sifted flour and beaten egg.

QUEEN CAKE— Is made in tb" same man 
ner as pound cake, only with a less proportion 
of flour, (fourteen ounces, or two ounces less than 
a pound) as it must be baked in little tins; and 
small cakes require less flour than large ones. 
Also, (besides a somewhat larger allowance of spice, 
liquor, &c.) add the juice and grated yellow rind 
of a lemon or two, and half a pound of sultana 
or seedless raisins, cut in half and dredged with 
flour. Butter your small cake tins, and fill to the 
edge with the batter. They will not run over the 
edge if well made, and baked with a proper fire, 
but they will rise high and fine in the centre. 
Ice ihem when beginning to cool, flavoring the 
icing with lemon or rose. Queen cakes mado 
exactly as above are superlative.

OEANGE CAKES.— Make a mixture precisely 
as for queen cake, only omit the wine, brandy, 
and rose-water, and substitute the grated yellow 
rind and the juice of four large ripe oranges, 
stirred into the batter in turn with the egg and 
flour. Flavor the icing with orange juice.

iSPOlSTGE CAKE. — Many persons suppose tliat 
sponge cake must dg very easy to make, because 
there is no butter in it. On the contrary, the 
w.ant of butter renders it diffi-cult to get light 
A really good sponge cake is a very different thing 
from those numerous tough leathery compositions 
that go by that name, and being flavored with 
nothing, are not worthy of eating as cahe^ and aro 
neither palatable nor wholesome as diet, unless too 
fresh to have grown dry and hard. The best 
sponge cake we know of is made as follows, and 
even that should be eaten the day it is baked. 
Sift half a pound of flour, (arrow-root is still bet- 
ter,) in a shallow pan ; beat twelve eggs till very 
thick, light, and smooth. You need not separate 
the yolks and whites, if you know the true way 
of adding the flour. Beat a pound of powdered 
loaf sugar, gradually, (a little a^ a time) into the 
beaten eggs, and add the juice and grated yellow 
rinds of two large lemons or oranges. Lastly^ 
stir in the flour or arrow root. It is all important 
that this should be done slowly and lightly, and 
without stirring down to the bottom of the pan. 
Hold the egg-beater perpendicularly or quite up- 
right in one hand, and move it round on the sur- 
face of the beaten egg, while with the other hand 
you li'j^htly and gradually sprinkle in the flour 
till all is in. If stirred in hard and fast it will 
render the cake porous and tough, and dry and 
hard when cold. Have ready either a large tur- 
ban mould, or some small oblong or square 
ting. Butter them nicely, transfer to them the 



524 MISS lksme's new cook book 

cake mixture, grate powdered sugai profusely 
over the surface to give it a gloss like a very thin 
crust, and set it immediately into a brisk oven. 
The small oblong cakes are called Naples biscuits, 
and require no icing. A large turban -Jake maj/ 
be i^ed plain, without ornament. 

A very light sponge cake, when sliced, will cut 
down rough and coarse grained, and it is desirable 
to have it so. 

Lady Fingers — Are mixed in the same manner, 
and of the same ingredients as the foregoing re- 
ceipt for the best sponge cake. When the mix- 
ture is finished, form the cakes by shaping the 
batter with a tea-spoon, upon sheets of soft white 
paper slightly damped, forming them like double 
ovals joined in the centre. Sift powdered sugar 
over them, and bake them in a quick oven till 
slightly browned. When cool, take them off the 
papers. They are sometimes iced.

ALMOND SPONGE CAKE.— The addition of 
Jilmonds makes this cake very superior to the usual 
sponge cake. Sift half a pound of fine flour or 
arrow root. Blanch in scalding water two ounces 
of shelled sweet almonds, and two ounces of bitter 
ones^ renewing the hot water when expedjent. 
When the skins are all off, wash the almonds in 
ucld water, (mixing the sweet and bitter) and wipe 
them dry. Pound them to a fine smooth paste, (one 
at a time,) in a very clean marble mortar, adding, as 
vou proceed, plenty of rose-water to prevent their 
oiling. Then set them in a cool place. Beat iwelv- 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 525 

eggfe till very smooth and thick, and then beat 
into ihem, gradually, a pound of powdered 
loaf \ ^gar, in turn with the pounded almonds 
LastlA^ add the flour, stirring it round slowly and 
lightly )n the surface of the mixture, as in com- 
mon spv age cake. Have ready a deep square pan. 
Butter iv nicely. Put the mixture carefully into 
it, set it Lito the oven, and bake it till thoroughly 
done and tlsen very high. When cool, cover it with 
plain whitv ioing, flavored with rose-water. With 
Bweet almoiids, always use a small portion of bit- 
ter ores. "Vx' ithout them, sweet almonds have little 
or IT" taste, Vv>R)ugh they add to th^ richness of 
^he cake.

SPANISH .M^NS. — In a shallow pan put a 
half pint of rio.b anskimmed milk, and cut up in 
it a half pound crl the best fresh butter. Set it 
on the stove, or n ur the fire, to warm and soften, 
but do not let it melt or oil. When soft^ stir it 
all through the milk with a broad knife, and then 
eet it away to cool. Sift into a broad pan half a 
pound of the finest flour, and an additional 
quarter of a pound put on a plate by itself. Beat 
four eggs in a shallow pan till very thick and 
smooth, and mix them at once into the butter 
and sugar, adding the half pound of flour. Stir 
In a powdered nutmeg, and two wine-glasses of 
strong yeast, fresh from the brewer's, first remov 
ing the thin liquid or beer from the top. Sti*

gradually^ half a pound of powdered white sugar 
The buns will become heavy if the sugar ia 
thrown in all at ouce. It is important that it 
should be added a little at a time. Then sprinkle 
in, by degrees, the extra quarter of a pound of 
sifted flour, and lastly add a wine-glass of litrong 
rose-water. When all has been well stirred, but- 
ter (with fine fresh butter,) an oblong iron or 
block-tin pan, and carefully put the bun mixture 
into it. Cover it with a clean cloth, and set it 
near the fire to rise. It may require five hours ; 
therefore buns wanted for tea should be made in 
the forenoon. When the batter has risen very 
high, and is covered with bubbles, put the pan 
immediately into a moderate but steady oven, 
and bake it. When cool, cut the buns into squares, 
and ice each one separately, if for company ; the 
icing being flavored with lemon or orange juice. 
Otherwise, you may simply sift sugar over them. 
These buns were first introduced by Mrs. Good 
fellow ; and in her school were always excellently 
made, nothing being spared that was good, and 
the use of soda and other alkalis being unknown 
in the establishment — hartshorn in cakes would 
have horrified her.

LADY CAKE.— This cake must be flavored 
highly with bitter almonds ; without them, sweet 
almonds have little or no taste, and are useless in 
lady cake. Blanch, in scalding water, three small 
oai^ces of shelled bitter almonds, and then lay

fchem in a bowl of very cold water. Afterwarrlg 
wipe them dry, and pound them (one at a time,) 
to a smooth paste in a clean marble mortar ; ad- 
ding, as you proceed, a wine-glass of rose-watei 
to improve the flavor, and prevent their oiling, 
and becoming heavy and dark. When done, set 
them away in a cool place, on a saucer. Almonds 
are always lighter and better when blanched and 
pounded the day before. Cut up three quarters 
of a pound of the best fresh butter in a pound of 
powdered loaf sugar. Mix it in a deep earthen 
pan, and stir and beat it with a spaddle till it be- 
comes very light and creamy. Then, gradually, 
stir in the pounded almonds. Take the whites 
only of seventeen or eighteen fresh eggs, and 
beat them in a shallow pan to a stiff froth, till 
they stand alone. Then stir the beaten white of 
^ggj gradually, into the pan of creamed buttei 
and sugar, in turn with three small quarters of a 
pound (or a pint and a half,) of sifted flour of the 
very best quality. Stir the whole very hard at 
the last, and transfer it to a straight- sided tin 

pan, well greased with excellent fresh butter. 
Set the pan immediately into an oven, and bake 
it with a moderate but steady heat. When it has 
been baking rather more than two hours, probe 
if by sticking down to the bottom a twig from a 
corn broom, or a very narrow knife. If it comes 
out clean the cake is done ; if clammy or daubed, 
keep it longer in the oven. A cake when quite 
done generally shrinks a little. When you take 
U out, set it to cool on an inverted sieve. Ice s

CINNAMON CAKE,— Cut up half a pound 
of fine fresh butter, and warm it till soft in half 
ft pint of rich milk. Sift a pound of fine flour 
Into a broad pan ; make a hole in the centre, 
and pour into it the milk and butter, having 
stirred them well together. Then, gradually, add 
a large quarter of a pound of powdered sugar, 
and a heaped tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon. 
Beat three eggs very smooth and thick, and stir 
fchem in, also a wine-glass and a half of strong 
fresh brewer's yeast, or two glasses of fresh 
baker's yeast. Then mix, (having sprinkled some 
over the top,) all the flour into the hole in the 
centre, so as to make a soft dough. When all is 
well mixed cover it, and set it to rise in a round 
straight-sided tin pan. Place it near the fire, 
and when quite light and cracked all over the 
surface, flour your pasteboard well, place the loaf 
upon it, and having prepared in a pint bowl a 
stiff mixture of ground cinnamon, fresh butter, 
and brown sugar, beaten together so as to stand 
alone, make numerous deep cuts or incisions alj 
over the surface on the sides and top of the 
cake, fill them with the cinnamon mixture, and 
pinch each together so as to keep the seasoning 
from coming out. Glaze it all over with beaten

ioaf to the pan, and bake it in a moderate oven 
till thoroughly done. When cool, cut it down in 
slices like a pound cake. 

This dough may be divided into small round 
cakes, the size of a muffin, and baked on tin or 
iron sheets, sifting sugar over them when cool. 
It must have a high flavor of cinnamon.

WEST INDIA COCOA-NUT CAKE. —Cut 
ap and peel some pieces of very ripe cocoa-nut. 
Lay them for a while in cold water. Then take 
them out and wipe them dry, and grate very fine 
as much as will weigh half a pound. Beat eight 
eggs till very light, thick, and smooth. Have 
ready half a pound of powdered loaf sugar, and stir 
it into the pan of beaten egg, alternately with the 
grated cocoa-nut ; adding a handful of sifted flour, 
a powdered nutmeg, and a large glass of madeira 
or sherry, stirring the whole very hard. Butter 
an oblong tin pan. Put in the mixture, set ik 
Immediately into a quick oven, and bake it weU, 
Set it to cool on an inverted sieve; cut it into 
squares, and ice each square, flavoring tlie icing 
with rose. 

You may bake it in a large loaf; adding dou- 
ble portions of all the ingredients, and ornament- 
ing the icing handsomely. 

Sweet Potato Cake — Is made like the above co- 
£oa-nut cake. The sweet potatos must be pared 
and grated raw^ till you have as much as weighs

half a pound. Then proceed as above, and with 
the same ingredients and proportions. You may 
boil and mash the sweet potatos; but be sure, af- 
terwards, to pass them through a coarse sieve, or 
they may chance to clod and become heavy. If 
well made, and well flavored, this cake is very 
nice. 

GOLDEN CAKE.— The best time for making 
this cake is when ripe oranges are plenty. For 
one cake select four large deep-colored oranges, 
and roll each one under your hand upon a table 
to soften them, and increase the juice. Weigh a 
pound of the best loaf sugar. On some of thr 
largest pieces rub off the yellow or outer rind of 
the oranges, omitting the white entirely. The 
white or inner rind of oranges or lemons should 
never be used for any thing. Cut the oranges, 
and sij[ueeze their juice through a strainer into a 
large saucer or a small deep plate. Powder all 
the sugar, including that which has the orange 
zest upon it, and put it into a deep earthen pan, 
with a pound of the best fresh butter cut up 
among it. With a wooden spaddle stir the butter 
and sugar together, till very light and creamy 
In a shallow pan beat twelve eggs, omitting the 
whites of three. Sift into a dish a small quart of 
the best and finest flour, and stir it gradually into 
the pan of butter and sugar and orange, in turr

diately transfer the batter to square tin pana,

greased with the same tresh butter that was uaod 
for the cake. Many a fine cake has been spoihd, 
at last, by the poor economy of greasing the pans 
with salt butter. Fill the pans to the top. If the 
cake has been well made, and well beaten, there 
is no danger of the batter running over the edges. 
Put it, immediately, into a quick oven and bake 
it well, not allowing the heat to be lessened till 
the cake is quite done. When cool, cut it into 
Bquares. If you ice it, flavor the icing with 
orange juice. 

Do not attempt to make this cake with yolk 
of egg only, by way of improving the yellow co 
lor. Without any whites, it will assuredly be 
tough and heavy. Cakes may be made light 
with white of egg only, but never with yellow of 
egg only. 

If you use soda, saleratus, hartshorn, or any 
of the alkalis, they will entirely destroy the 
orange flavor, and communicate a bad taste of 
their own 

SILVER CAKE.—Scald in a bowl of boiling 
water two ounces of shelled bitter almonds. As 
you peel ofl^ the skins throw each almond into a 
bowl of ice-cold water. When all are blanched, 
take them cut, and wipe them dry on a clean nap- 
kin. Put them, one at a time, into a very clean 
marble mortar, and pound each one separately to 
a smooth paste, adding, as you pound them, a 
few drops of strong rose-water, till you have 
':.«ed up a large wine-glass full. As you remov©

tne pounded almonds from the water, lay them 
A.*gr::tly and loosely on a plate. When all are lone, 
put them into a very cool place. In a deep 
earthen pan cut up a pound of fresh butter into 
a pound of powdered sugar, and with a wooden 
spaddle stir the butter and sugar together till 
perfectly light. Into another pan sift three quar- 
ters of a pound of fine flour, and in a broad shal- 
low pan beat with small rods the whites only 
of eighteen eggs till they are stiff enough to stand 
alone. Then, gradually, and alternately, stir into 
the pan of beaten butter and sugar the flour, the 
beaten white of eggs, and the pounded almonds. 
Give the whole a hard stirring at the last. Trans- 
fer it to square tin pans greased with the same 
butter, and bake it 'veil. When cool, cut it into 
square cakes, and send it to table on china plates, 
piled alternately with pieces of golden cake, 
handsomely arranged. If you ice silver cake, 
flavor the icing with strong rose-water. 

These cakes, (gold or silver) if made as above, 
will be found delicious. The yolk of egg left from 
the silver cake may be used for soft custards. 
But yolk of egg alone, will not raise a cake; 
though white of egg will.

tuls of carraway seeds. Moisten tlie whole witli a 
large glass of white wine; and barely sufficient 
cold water to make a stiff dough. Mix it well 
with a broad knife, and roll it out into a sheet 
less than half an inch thick ; then with the edge 
of a tumbler, or a tin cake-cutter, divide xt into 
round small cakes. Bake them in oblong pans, 
(tin or iron) slightly buttered ; and do not place 
them so closely as to touch. Bake them in a quick 
oven, till they are of a pale brown. These cakes 
are soon prepared, requiring neither eggs nor 
yeast. 

MARMALADE MERINGUES.— Make a mix- 
ture as for apees, omitting only the carraway 
seeds. Roll out the sheet of dough quite thin ; 
cut it into round flat cakes with the edge of a 
tumbler, and bake them a few minutes, till lightly 
colored. Take them out of the oven and spread 
them thickly with very nice marmalade, or with 
ripe strawberries or raspberries, sweetened, and 
mashed without cooking. Have ready a stiff me- 
ringue of beaten white of egg and sugar. Pile 
it high over the marmalade on each cake. Heap 
it on with a spoon, so as quite to conceal the 
marmalade, and do not smooth it on the top. It 
should stand up uneven as the spoon left it. SeJ 
it again in the ovea for a minute or two, to hai 
den it.

JUMBLES. — Mix together, al! at once, in a 
deep pan, a pound of butter cut up in a pound of 
powdered sugar, a pound of sifted flour, and six 
GggSj previously beaten very light in a pan by 
themselves. Add a table- spoonful of powdered 
epice, (mixed nutmeg, mace, and cinnamon) and 
a glass of mixed wine and brandy ; or else a glass 
of rose water; or the juice and grated yellow rind 
of a large lemon. Stir the whole very hard till 
all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, and be- 
come a soft dough. Flour your hands and your 
pasteboard, and lay the dough upon it. Take off 
equal portions from the lump, and with your 
hands form them into round rolls, and make them 
into rings by joining together the two ends of 
each. Place the jumbles (not so near as to touch,'^ 
in tin pans slightly buttered, and bake them in a 
very brisk oven little more than five or six min- 
utes, or enough to color them a light brown. If 
the oven is too cool, the jumbles will spread and 
run into each other. When cold, sift sugar over 
them. Jumhles may be made with yolks of eggs 
only, if the whites are wanted for something else. 

Cocoa-nut Jumbles — Are made as abovo, only 
with finely grated cocoa-nut instead of fl^ur, and 
with white of egg instead of yolk. 

Cccoa-nut Puffs. — Grate any quantity of cocoa- 
nut. Mix it with powdered sugar and a little

an<i of Scottish origin. It keeps well, and is 
often sent from thence, packed in boxes.

JELLY CAKE.— For baking jelly cake you 
must have large flat tin pans rather larger than 
a dinner plate. But a very clean soap-stone 
griddle may be substituted, though more trouble' 
some. Make a rich batter as for pound cake, and 
bake it in single cakes, (in the manner of buck- 
»vheat, or thicker) taking care to grease the tia 
or soap-stone with excellent fresh butter. Have 
ready enough of fiiiit jelly or marmalade, to 
spread a thick layer all over each cake when it 
cools. Pile one on another very evenly, till you 
luue four, five, or half a dozen; and ice the sur- 
face of the whole. Cut it down in triangular

of sponge cake, which is going out of use for ail 
purposes, as being too often dry, tough, and in-

ALMOKD MACAROONS. — The day before 
they are wanted, prepare three quarters of a 
pound of shelled sweet almonds, and a quarter of 
a pound of shelled bitter almonds; by scalding, 
blc\nching, and pounding tliem to a smooth paste 
in a marble mortar, (one or two at a time) adding, 
as you proceed, rose-water to prevent their oiling, 
and becoming dark and heavy. Having beaten 
to a stiff froth the whites of six eggs, and pre- 
pared a pound of powdered loaf sugar, beat tlie 
sugar into the egg a spoonful at a time. Then 
mix in graduajly the pounded almonds, and add 
a grated nutmeg. Stir the whole very hard^ and 
form the mixture into small round balls. Then 
flatten slightly the surface of each. Butter 
slightly some shallow tin pans. Place the maca- 
roons not so close as to be in danger of touching, 
and glaze them lightly with a little beaten white 
of egg. Put them into a brisk oven, and bake 
them a light brown. 

Ground-nut macaroon are made in the sam^ 
manner.

KISSES.— Having beaten to a stiff froth, till 
it stands alone, the whites of eight eggs, mix 
with it, gradually, three quarters of a pound of 
finely powdered loaf sugar, beating it in very 
hard, a spoonful at a time, and as you proceed 
flavoring it with extract of vanilla, rose, or lemon 
juice. If the meringue is not thoroughly beat3n 
and very stiff, the kisses will lose their shape and 
run in baking. Try one first, and if that runs, 
beat a while lono;er before vou bake the whole. 
Pile portions of the meringue on sheets of letter 
paper, placing each heap far apart. Smooth and 
shape them with a broad knife dipped in eol^ 
water. Make them about the size and form of 
half eggs, with the flat part downwards. Arrange 
them on a smooth hickory board, and set it in a 
quick oven, (leaving the door open) and watch 
them well. A few minutes will color them a 
pale browL, and that is all they require. TLon 
take them out, and set them to cool. When cool, 
slip a knife carefully under each, and remove 
them from the paper. Then with your knife 
hollow the nieringue from the base of each ki^s,

and scrape upwards toward tbe top, being careful 
not to break through the outside or crust. Fill up 
this vacancy with any sort of stiff jelly. Then 
clap two halves together, and unite them at the 
base, by moistening the edges with a little of the 
meringue that was left. Handle them very care 
fully throughout. 

Large kisses, of twice or thrice the usual size, 
are introduced at parties, filled with ice cream, 
or flavored calf's foot jelly. 

It is very customary now to finish a fine char- 
lotte russe with a thick layer of this jelly at the

LAFAYETTE GINGERBKEAD.— Cut up in 
a deop pan lialf a pound of the best fresh butter, 
•\^ith a half pound of excellent brov/n sugar; and 
stir it to cream with a spaddle. Add a pint of 
West India molasses, mixed with half a pint of 
v/arm milk; four table-spoonfuls of ginger; a 
heaped table-spoonful of mixed powdered cinna- 
mon and powdered mace and nutmeg ; and a glass 
of brandy. Sift in a pound and a half of fine 
flour. Beat six eggs till very light and thick, 
and mix them, alternately, into the pan of butter, 
sugar, molasses, &c. At the last, mix in the yel- 
low rind (grated fine) of two large oranges and 
the juice. Stir the whole very hard. ^Iclt iu 
ono cup a very small level tea-spoonful of soda, 
and in another a small level salt-spoon of tartaric 
acid. Dissolve them both in lukewarm water, and 
•ea that lx>th are quite melted. First stir the soda 



MISS LESLIES NEW COOK BOOK. 539 

into the mixture, and then put in .he tartaric 
acid. On no account exceed the quantity of the 
two alkalis, as if too much is used, they will de- 
stroy entirely the flavoring, and communicate .^ 
very disagreeable taste instead. Few cakes aie 
the better for any of the alkaline powders, and 
many sorts are entirely spoiled by them. Even 
in gingerbread they should be used very spar- 
ingly, rather less than mere of the prescribed 
quantity. Having buttered, (with the same but- 
ter) a large round or oblong pan, put in the mix- 
ture, and bake it in a moderate oven till tho- 
roughly done, keeping up a steady heat, but 
watching that it does not burn. There is no gin- 
gerbread superior to this, if well made. Instead 
of lemon or orange, cut in half a pound of seed- 
less raisins, dredge them well with flour, and stir 
them, gradually, into the mixture. 
This is also called Franklin gingerbread. 



'**<^^^^^^^^^^^*« " 



GINGER NUTS.— Cut a pound of the best 
fresh butter into two pounds or two quarts of 
sifted flour, and half a pound of fine brown sugar. 
Add four heaped table-spoonfuls of ground gin 
ger; a heaped table-spoonful of powdered cinna 
mon, and the same quantity of mixed nutmeg and 
mace. Mix all the ingredients thoroughly toge- 
ther; adding, gradually, a large pint of West 
India molasses, and tne grated yellow rind anc* 
juice of a lemon or orange. Stir it very hard

pieces of the dough, and knead each piece a lit- 
tie; then flatten them on the top. M^ke them 
the size of a quarter dollar. Or, (flouring your 
pasteboard) roll out the dough, and cut out the 
ginger-nuts with the edge of a small wine-glass. 
Bake them on buttered tins, having first glazed 
them with a thin mixture of molasses and water. 
The same dough may be baked in long straight 
sticks, divided by lines deeply marked with a 
knife. 

There are many other gingerbreads ; but any 
of the soft sorts may be made with little varia- 
tion from the foregoing directions for Lafayette 
gingerbread ; and of the hard sort of ginger-nut 
preparation, the above is the basis of the rest 
If the receipts are liberally and exactly followed 
it will be found that to those two none are supe 
rior. 

PIGEON PIE.— For this pie take six fine fal 
tame pigeons, carefully cleaned and picked. Lay 
them in cold water for an hour, changing the wa- 
ter twice during that time. This is to remove 
what is called "the taste of the nest." Have 
ready the yolks of six hard-boiled eggs, seasoned 
with powdered nutmeg. Place a bit of fresh 
butter rolled in flour, in the inside of each pigeon, 
with its liver cut up, and with a yolk of egg sea- 
soned with powdered mace. Lay a nice tender 
beef steak, or thin veal cutlet, in the bottom of a 
large deep dish, that has been lined with puff 
paste Butter the steak, and dredge it wiih flour 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 541 

Tliere must be meat enough to covor well thf 
bottom of t) 3 pie dish. Itay the pigec^uj? upon it, 
w.th the breast downward, (their heads and feet 
cut off, and their livers cut up, and put inside 
witli the stufhng.) Fill up the dish with water 
Roll out and put on the lid of the pie, which you 
may ornament with paste leaves or flowers, ac- 
cording to your taste. For company, pigeon pies 
are expected to look handsome. It is no longer 
fashionable to have the feet of the pigeons stick- 
ing out of the slit in the top of the paste. 

Moorfowl, plieasants, partridges, or quails, may 
be made into pies in the above manner, it is 
usual, for partridge pies, to peel two fine sweet 
oranges; and having divided them into quarters, 
carefully remove the strings and seeds, and put 
tl]e oranges into the birds without any other stuf- 
fing. Instead of beef steak or veal cutlet, lay a 
thin slice of cold ham in the bottom of the pie- 
dish. 

This receipt, and the following, were accident- 
ally omitted in their proper places. . 



CHICKEN PIE.— Skin a pair of fine fowls, 
and cut them up. Save out the necks, backs, 
feet, livers, and gizzards, and the ends of the pi- 
nions ; and seasoning them with a little pepper 
and salt add some trimmings or spare bits of 
fresh beef or veal, and stew them in a small 
sauce- pan with a little water, to make the gravy

cne liquid ; and while hot, stir into it a ben ten 
egg and a bit of fresh butter, dredged with flour 
In the mean time make a nice puff-paste, and roll 
it out rather thick; divide it in two circular 
shsels. Line with one sheet the bottom and sidea 
of a deep pie dish, and put in the best pieces of 
chicken. Lay among them four hard-boiled e^g^j 
sliced or quartered. Season well with powdered 
mace or nutmeg. The gravy being strained, pour 
that into the pie, and finish at the top with a layer 
of butter divided into small pieces, and dredge 
with flour. This is what the old English cookery 
books mean when they say — " Close the pie with 
a fert?\" 

A chicken pie will be improved by the addition 
of a dozen or more large fresh oysters, stewed. 
If you add oysters, takeoff the lid or upper crust 
as soon as the pie is baked, and put in the oysters 
then; if put in at the beginning, they will bake 
too long. Replace the lid nicely, and send the 
pie to table hot. 

The lid should have in the top a cross slit with 
a nice paste flower in it. To make a paste flower 
roll out a straight narrow slip of paste, about four 
or five inches wide. Roll it up with your fingers 
as if you were rolling up a ribbon. Then with a 
sharp knife cut four clefts in the upper half, and 
when baked, it will spread apart as like the leaves 
of a flower.

SWEETlilEATS. 

No sweetmeats can either look well or ta^jte well 
i-nless the fruit and the sugar are of the best qua- 
1 ty. As in all other branches of cookery, it is fake 
economy to provide bad or low-priced ingredients. 
It has of late years been difficult to obtain very 
good sugar at any price, so much is adulterated 
with flour or ground starch. In the common pow- 
dered sugar the flour is so palpable that we are 
surprised at its having any sale at all ; and the 
large quantity required to produce any percep- 
tible sweetness retders it totally unfit for sweet- 
meats, or indeed for any thing else. The best 
brown sugar is better than this, having clarified 
it with v/hite of ^.gg. To do this, allow to every 
pound of sugar the beaten white of an egg, and a 
half pint of clear cold water. Having poured 
the water on the sugar, let it stand to melt before 
it goes on the fire. Then add the white of egg 
and put in on to boil. When it boils, carefully 
take off the scum as it rises, and add when it is 
boiling hard another jill or quarter pint of water 
for each pound of sugar. Kemove it from the fire 
when the scum ceases to rise, and let it stand for 
a quarter of an hour to settle. Strain, and bottU 
it for use. The best brown sugar thus prepared 
will make a good syrup; and good marmalade, 
when white sugar of the best quality is not to bt 
obtained. But for the nicest sweetmeats use al 
ways if you can, the best double-refined loaC 



544 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK 

In warm weather there is nothing better foi 
n preserving fire than a portable charcoal furnace 
placed out in the open air; as in a room with the 
doors or windows shut the vnpor of charcoal ia 
deadly, and never fails to produce suffocation 
Of whatever the fire is made, it should be clear 
and steady without smoke or blaze. Never use 
copper or bell-metal for either preserving or pick- 
ling. For all such purposes employ only iron, 
lined with what is called porcelain or enamel, 
but is in reality a thick strong white earthen, first 
made at Delft, in Holland. This lining will crack 
if the kettle is placed over a blaze, which it 
should never be. All sweetmeats should be boiled 
with the lid off. If covered, the steam having no 
means of escaping, returns upon them, and causea 
them to look dark and unsightly. When done, 
put the sweetmeats warm into jars or glasses, and 
leave them open a few hours that the watery par- 
ticles may evaporate, but have them all pasted 
and closely covered before night. Do nothing to 
render your preserves hard, or firm, as it is called. 
It is better to have them soft and tender. The 
old custom of steeping them for days in salt and 
water, and then boiling them in something else 
lo remove the salt, is now considered foolish, and 
is seldom practised. 

Put up jellies and small sweetmeats in common 
tumblers, laying on the surface of each a double 
cover of white tissue paper cut exactly to lit, an<l 
then put on another cover of thick white ]>aper 
Pleated and notched where it descends below the

edge, using always gum tragf.canth paste, which 
you should keep always in the house, as it re- 
quires no boiling; and if in making it, a bit of 
corrosive sublimate (not larger than a cherry-stone) 
is dissolved with the ounce of gum tragacanth 
and the half pint of warm water, in a yellow or 
white- ware mug, and stirred only with a stick, the 
paste will never spoil, and if kept covered, will 
be found superior to all others. No metal must 
touch this cement, as it will then turn black and 
spoil. 

Keep your sweetmeats always in a dry place. 
But if after a while you see a coat of mould on 
the surface, you need not throw them away, till 
you have tried to recover them by carefully re- 
moving every particle of mould, filling up the jars 
with fresh sugar, and setting them, one by one, in 
a bottle of water, and in this way boiling them 
over again. But if they have an unpleasant smell, 
and you see insects about them, of course they must 
be thrown away. To purify jars, clean and scrape 
them, and wash them thoroughly with ley and 
water, or with a solution of soda — afterwards 
exposing them to the sun and air for a week or 
more. 

Jellies. — We have already given directions for 
various fruit jellies in the chapter on Fine Desserts. 
They are all made nearly in the same manner, 
using the juice of the fruit, and sufficient su- 
gar to make it congeal and to keep it. Jelliea 
ahauld always be bright and transparent, and 



546 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

therefore require the best and ripest of fruit and 
the finest of loaf sugar. 



•**^.^^^^^^^^*»»« 



MARxVFALADE OR JAMS. — Marmalade oi 
jams are the easiest sweetmeats to make, and are 
useful for all sweetmeat purposes. They are all 
made nearly in the same manner; and to be very 
good, and to keep well, at least a pound of fine 
sugar should be allowed to every pound of fruit — 
the fruit being quite ripe, freshly gathered, and 
of the best kind. 

For Peach Marmalade — Take fine, juicy free- 
Btone peaches. Pare them ; cut them in half; re- 
move the stones, and let them be saved and the 
kernels extracted to use as bitter almonds. Cut 
up the peaches, and allow for each pound a pound 
of sugar. Lay the peaches (with all the sugar 
among them,) in a large pan or tureen, and let 
them rest for three or four hours. Boil the 
peaches and sugar together in a porcelain kettle 
(without a cover) for half an hour, skimming and 
stirring well. When it becomes a thick smooth 
mass it is finished. Put .t up in glass jars, and 
leave it uncovered till cool ; but not longer. The 
fiavor will be much improved by boiling with tl\6 
peaches and sugar one or two handfuls of the 
kernels, blanched and pounded ; or else a buucL 
of fresh peach leaves, to be removed afterward. 

Quince Marmalade is made in the same mannei 
—first carefully removing all the blemishes. Al- 
low a pound of sugar to a pound of quinces 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 547 

They must boii longer than peaches. All marma- 
lades must be cooked till the form of the fruii 
is quite indistinguishable, and till it mashes into 
a thick smooth mass. Quinces should be allowed 
to remain on the trees till after the lirst frost, 
which greatly improves them. Persimmons and 
wild grapes are not eatable till they are touched 
by the frost. 

Tomato Marmalade, — Make this when lemons 
are ripe and plenty. To every two pounds of 
tomatos allow two pounds of sugar, and the grated 
yellow rind and the juice of one lemon. The 
worst way of using lemons for any purpose is to 
merely slice them. Depend on the slices for fla- 
voring, and they are wasted; the taste being 
scarcely perceptible. They should always be first 
rolled under your hand, which increases the yield 
of juice. Then grate off from the outside the 
yellow rind only (the white part of the rind is 
worse than useless,) and having cut the lemon, 
squeeze the juice through a tin strainer to exclude 
the seeds, which otherwise would be troublesome 
to pick out. The yellow rind and the juice are 
all you need want of a lemon for any purpose of 
flavoring. Scald the tomatos to make them peel 
easily, and mix the sugar thoroughly with them 
J3oil them slowly for an hour in a porcelain 
kettle, skimming carefully, and stirring well after 
each skimming. Then add the lemon grate and 
the juice, and boil the marmalade another halt 
hour, or till it is a thick smooth mass. 

Pumpkin Marmalade. — Take a fine ripe high- 



548 MISS Leslie's new cook book, 

colored pumpkin. Cut it up. Empty it very 
clean of the seeds and strings ; take off a tliick 
paring. Slice the pieces small and thin, and 
weigh them. To each pound of pumpkin allow 
a pound of powdered sugar, and the grated peel 
and the juice of one large lemon. Pumpkin 
sweetmeats require a high lemon flavoring. Boil 
the pumpkin alone, till quite soft. Then m.ash it 
in a cullender till the water is pressed out, and 
the pumpkin left dry. Afterwards put it into a 
porcelain kettle, mix with it the sugar and lemon, 
and boil it again till it becomes a thick jam. 
Cantaloupe marmalade is made in the same way 
with lemon and sugar — also vnarmalade of ripe 
figs. 

Plum Marmalade. — Choose pluma that are fully 
ripe. Allow to each pound a pound and a half 
of sugar. Scald them till the skins peel off ea- 
sily, and extract all the stones. Lay them in the 
sugar for two or three hours or more, and then 
boil them till they become a thick smooth mass. 
Green-gages the same. 

Raspberry Jam, — To every quart of fine ripe rasp- 
berries allow a pound of best loaf sugar, powdered. 
Put them together into a broad white- ware pan, and 
let them rest for two or three hours. Then boiJ 
them in an uncovered porcelain kettle, taking off 
the scum carefully. When eo more scum rises, 
mash them, and boil them to a smooth thick mar 
maiade. When cold, put it up in half pint tumblers, 
ftud cover them with rounds of double tissue

paper, cut exactly to fit, and then with thick •white 
paper dipped in brandy. 

Strawberry Jam. — ^The strawberries must be 
q_uite ripe, and very fine. Allow to each quart a 
pound of powdpred loaf sugar. Put them into a 
large white- ware pan ; a layer of sugar and a 
layer of strawberries alternately, finishing with 
strawberries on the top. Let them rest in the 
sugar and juice three or four hours. Then boil 
and skim them till they become very thick and 
smooth. When cold, put them up in tumblers, 
with double tissue paper over the top. Black 
berry jam is made in the same manner. 

Gooseberry Jam. — Top and tail the gooseberries, 
which must be thoroughly ripe, and with thin 
skins. They require to QVQry^ pound of fruit a 
pound and a half of sugar of the best sort. Mash 
them with a wooden beetle, and put them with all 
the sugar into an uncovered porcelain kettle, and 
boil and skim them. When half done add more 
sugar, and continue boiling till they are a very 
thick marmalade. When cold, cover the tumblers 
with brandy paper. 

Pine-apple Marmalade. — Take the best and 
ripest pine-apples; remove the leaves, and split 
each pine-apple into four pieces, and cut out the 
core from the centre. Stand the pieces upright 
in^ a deep dish, and, with a large coarse gr;iter 
grate down all the flmh of the fruit, as it is called. 
To every pint of grated pine-apple allow a 
pound of powdered loaf sugar, and put them to 
^e/;hei in a large tureen. Let. them v?8t two

hours. Then transfer the whole to a porcelain 
kettle. Leave it uncovered ; and boil, skim, and 
Btir, till it becomes a very thick maruialado. 
When cool, put it up in glass jars. It is a very 
nice sweetmeat, particularly for sliells or tarts. 

Grape Marwalode. — Take a sufficiency of fintj 
grapes, thoroughly ripe. Ilaving picked theia 
from the stems, masb them with a wooden beetle 
and then press them through a sieve. To Qwavy 
pint of the pulp allow a pound of powdered 
jsugar, well mixed in ; let it stand an hour or two. 
Then boil it, uncovered, in a porcelain kettle, 
Bkimming and stirring well, till it is very thick 
and smooth. When cool, put it up in small n\?.v- 
malade pots of white- ware with lids, and paste a 
band of thick white paper round each, at the 
small crack where the cover fits on. A good 
marmalade for the backwoods may be made of 
wild grapes and maple sugar. 

Cherry Marmalade. — If you cannot procure mo- 
rellas, (the best of all cherries for sweetmeats) use 
the large Virginia or carnation cherries. Black 
cheiries are unfit for cooking. Stem and stone 
your cherries, saving all the juice you can. Al- 
low a pound of powdered loaf sugar to every 
pint of cherries. Boil the fruit and the sugar 
together, uncovereil, for an hour, skimming 
and siirring. When cool, put it in white ware 
marmalade pots and paste the lids. 

Oiai\(je Marmalade. — Quarter some large ripe 
oranges, and remove the rind, the ^eeds, and the 
itrings or filaments, taking care to save aU

tnc juioe. Put the pulp, with the juice, into a 
porcelain kettle, and mix with it an equal quan- 
tity of strained honey, adding sufficient powdered 
loaf sugar to render it very thick and sweej. The 
houoy alone will not make it sweet enough. Boi^ 
it uncovered, and skim it till very thick, smooth, 
and clear. Taste it, and if necessary add more 
sugar, and boil it longer. When cold, put it up 
in tumblers or white- ware marmalade pots, and 
cover it securely. This marmalade is exquisite, 
and very superior to any other. 

Orange J/t7A;.— Take four dozen large ripe juicy 
oranges, and roll them under your hand. Cut 
them in two; remove the seeds, and squeeze thfl 
juice into a large clean stone jar. Have ready 
four pounds of the best double-refined loaf sugar, 
dissolved in a gallon of French brandy. Pour it 
into the jar that contains the orange juice; stir 
the mixture well, and add the yellow rind of the 
oranges, pared so thin from the white as to be 
transparent, and divide it into bits. Cover the 
jar, and let it stand four days, stirring it fre- 
quently. Then take a gallon of new unskimmed 
milk, (the morning's milk of that day,) boil it 
alone, and when it comes to a hard boil pour it 
into the mixture of orange, sugar, and brandy. 
Cover it closely, and let ii stand till quite cold. 
Then strain it into another vessel through a lincu 
ji-lly bag. Bottle it immediately, and seal the 
ot>»rks. It improves by keeping. To use it, pour 
it out in half tumblers, and fill up with ice water 
or serve it round undiluted in small cordiaJ

glasses, after ice-cream. It is much admirerl, and 
in orange countries may be made in large quan- 
tities. Lemon milk is made in the same manner, 
having a larger proportion of sugar. 

Fruit -ki Syvips. — Make a syrup in the propor- 
tion of half a pint of water to every pound of 
sugar, and a pint of the juice of any sort of fine 
ripe fruit. Boil and skim it till wQvy clear, but 
not till it congeals or jellies. Then bottle it, and 
cork the bottles. As the fresh fruit comes again 
into season, select the finest, largest, and ripest. 
Foi instance, half fill a white- ware preserve jar 
with fine fresh strawberries, and fill up from a 
bottle of strawberry syrup ; or ripe raspberries 
with raspberry syrup; currants, with currant sy- 
rup, &c. Cover them closely till wanted for im- 
mediate use. 

PRESERVED CITRON MELONS. — Take 
some fine citron melons; pare, core, and cut them 
into slices. Then weigh them ; and, to every six 
pounds of melon, allow six pounds of the best 
double refined loaf sugar, and the juice and yel- 
low rind (grated very fine,) of four large fresb 
lemons, and a quarter of a pound of root ginger. 

Put the slices of lemon into a preserving kettle, 
and boil tliem half an hoar or more, till ihey look 
quiie clear, and are so tender that a broom t\»ig 
will pierce through them. Then drain them ; lay 
them in a broad pan of cold water, cover them, 
and let them stand all night. Li the morning tie 
the root ginger in a thin muslin cloth, and boiJ

it in three pints of clear spring or pump water 
till the water is highly flavored. Then take out 
the bag of ginger. Having broken up the sugar 
put it into a clean preserving kettle, and pour the 
ginger water over it. When the sugar is all 
melted set it over the fire, put in the grated ^^ellovs 
peel of the lemons, and boil and skim it till nc 
more scum rises. Then put in the sliced citrons, 
and the juice of the lemons ; and boil them in the 
syrup till all the slices are quite transparent, and 
so soft that a straw will go through them ; but do. 
not allow them to break. When quite done, put the 
slices (while still warm,) into wide-mouthed glass 
or white- ware jars, and gently pour on the syrup 
Lay inside of each jar, upon the top of the syrup, ?•

PINE- APPLES PRESERYED.— Take six fine 
large pine-apples, as ripe as you can get them 
Make them very clean, but- do not, at first, pare 
off the rind or cut off the leaves. The rind and 
leaves being left on while boiling will heep in the 
flavor of the fruit. Put the pine-apples whole into 
a very large and very clean iron pot. Fill it up 
with cold water, and boil the piub-appJes till they 
are so tender that you can pierce them through 
the rind to the core, with a splinter skewer or a twig 
from a corn broom. Then take them out of the pot.

and drain them. When they are so cool as to 
be handled without inconvenience, remove tbc 
leaves, and pare off the rind. Cut then into round 
slices about half an inch thick, extracting the core 
from the centre as to leave a small round hole in 
every slice. Weigh them, and to each pound of 
fruit allow a pound of double refined loaf sugar, 
broken up and powdered. Cover the bottom of a 
large dish or dishes with a thick layer of the sugar. 
On this place a layer of pine-apple slices ; then a 
layer of sugar; then a layer of fruit, and so od 
till the slices are all thickly covered, finishing with 
a layer of sugar at th« top. Let them stand 
twenty-four hours. Then drain the slices from 
the syrup, and lay them in wide jars. Put all the 
syrup into a clear porcelain kettle, and boil and 
ekim it till the scum ceases to rise. Then pour it 
hot upon the pine-apple. While warm, cover the 
jars closely with white paper cut to fit, and dipped 
m brandy ; and then tie on a piece of bladder. There 
is no better way of preserving pine- apples, or that 
retains the flavor so well. 

Quinces may be preserved in the same manner. 



PRESERVED LEMONS OR ORANGES.— 

The fruit must be perfectly ripe, of the best qua 
lity, with a smooth rind and fine color. Cut out 
from the stem end of each, a piece not quite the 
size of a quarter dollar, and with a small knife? 
Bcoop out all the inside, keeping the rind as whole 
aa possible. Put the pulp and juice into a large

bowl, and clear it from the strings and seeds. Lay 
tbe skins in a tureen of cold ice water, and change 
it twice during the day, (fresh water and fresh 
ice); and at bedtime put ice only. Next morn* 
ing boil the skins slowly in a porcelain kettle 
with plenty of water, keeping them well covered. 
Continue to boil till they are tender all through, 
and can easily be pierced with a splinter skewar. 
Then drain them, and lay them in cold water im- 
mediately. Take care to boil with them the small 
round pieces that come out of the top. Make a 
thick jelly or ma-rmalade of the pulp and juice of 
these, and some additional fruit, allowing to a 
pint of juice a pound of loaf sugar. When the 
jelly has been boiled till clear and firm when 
held in the air, fill with it the skins so as to swell 
them out into a good shape. Eeplace the small cir- 
cular pieces that have been cut off the top of t\)^ 
fruit, and tie them on securely with packthread, 
so as to keep in the jelly. Next make a thin sy- 
rup, allowing to a pound of broken-up loaf sugar 
half a pint of fresh juice,, and the beaten white of 
an egg. Boil and skim it till no more scum rises* 
Then having put the oranges into large glass jars 
rather more than half full, pour the syrup on 
them, filling up to the top. 

Ih Green Small Lemons or Litnes. — Boil them 
first in a little hard water, placing them in a por- 
celain kettle with a thick bed of fresh vine -eavc5«

yea change the water, and persisting till they ara 
woll greened. Then make holes in the stem end, 
ar.d extract the pulp, strings, and seeds, and pro- 
ceed as directed in the last receipt. The skins, as 
soon as empty, being laid in cold water, and then 
filled and shaped out with lemon jelly, and tho 
jars filled up warm with lemon syrup. Or by 
putting a larger portion of sugar, and boiling the 
syrup longer, you may candy it all over the sur- 
face of th.e fruit. 

Green limes are preserved in the above manner, 
filling the skins with lemon jelly. To candy the 
syrup use a double portion of sugar, and boil it 
till it bubbles and sparkles in the kettle.

PEACHES PRESERVED.— Take the finest 
ri:pe free-stone peaches. Pare them, cut them in 
half, and remove the stones. To every pound of 
peaches allow a pound of double refined loaf su- 
gar, and half the white of an egg (slightly beaten) 
with half a pin* of very clear soft water. Put 
the sugar into a porcelain preserving kettle, mix 
it \vith the water and white of egg, and when it 
has entirely dissolved, set it over the fire, and 
boil and skim it till the scum ceases to rise, which 
will be very soon, if the sugar is as good as it 
should be. There is no economy in using inferior 
sugar for sweetmeats, as much of it will be lost m 
skimming and sediment. In the mean time, boil 
in a little sauce-pan a bunch of fresh green peach 
leaves that have been cleared from all dust; or a 



, MISS Leslie's new cook book. 657 

Handful of broken-up peach kernels. When the 
^avor is well extracted, strain this water and mix 
♦t witii the syrup. Then put in the halved peaches, 
find boil them (uncovered) till quite clear and soft, 
but not till they break. While warm, put theci 
op with the syrup in glass or white- ware jars. 

Apricots arc preserved in the same way. 

Preserved Green Gages,— Get the largest and 
ripest green gages, or egg plums. Scald them in 
boiling Avater to make them peel easily; the 
£kins of all sorts of plums becoming very hard 
and tough when preserved. Kemove the stems; 
they are no ornament, and render them trouble- 
some to eat. Make a syrup in the usual way, 
allowing to each pound of plums a pound of the 
finest lonf sugar, half a pint of water, and half a 
white of egg. When well skimmed and boiled 
put in the plums, and boil them gently till quite 
clear and soft, but not till broken. All plums 
may be done in this manner. If not as ripe as 
possible, they will require to each pound of fruit 
a pound and a half of the best sugar.

BRANDY PEACHES.— Take large juicy /ree- 
stone peaches, not so ripe as to burst or mash on 
being handled. Rub off the down from everyone 
with a clean thick flannel. Prick every pcacb 
down to the stone with a large silver fork, and 
score ihem all along the seam or cleft. To each 
pound of peaches allow a pound of dt)uble-refined 
loaf sugar, broke a- up small, aud a half pint of

water mixed witb half a white of egg, slightly 
beaten. Put the sugar into a porcelain kettle, 
and pour the water upon it. When it is quite 
melted give it a stirring, set it over the fire, and 
boil and skim it till no more scum rises. Next 
put in tb« peaches, and let them cook (uncovered) 
in the syrup till they look clear, or for about half 
an hour, or till a straw will penetrate them. Then 
take the kettle off the fire. Uaving allotted a 
pint of the very best white brandy to each pound 
of peaches, mix it with the syrup, after taking out 
the fruit with a wooden spoon, and draining it 
over the kettle. Put the peaches into a large tu- 
reen. Let the syrup remain in the kettle a little 
longer. Mix the brandy with it, and boil them 
together ten minutes, or more. Transfer the 
peaches to large glass jars, (two thirds full,) and 
pour the brandy and syrup over them, filling 
quite up to the top. When cool, cover them 
closelv, and tie some bladder over the lids. 

Green Gages — Are brandied in the same man- 
ner. Also, large egg- pi urns. Pears also, having 
first peeled them. To pear sweetmeats always add 
lemon riad grated, and lemon juice.

PKESERVED TOMATOS.— This is an excel- 
Aent and popular sweetmeat, when flavored well 
with lemon, which is indispensable to making it 
palatable. Also, it should be well penetrated with 
sugar, therefore it is best not to attempt preserv- 
ing tomatos whole. The best time for doing the«

is ill the heifyht of the lemon season. Tho most 
convenient for preserving are those vvitli smooth 
even snrfaces. If fluted or cleft thoy are diiricult 
to peel when scalded, as the skins do not strip off 
go easily. Having weighed the tomatos, (which 
must be full-grown and quite ripe) allow to every 
two pounds, two pounds of the best brown sugar, 
a large spoonful of ground ginger, and the juice and 
grated yellow rind of one largo ripe lemon, rolled 
awhile under your hand. Having scalded and 
peeled all the tomatos, and mixed with the sugar 
a little beaten white of egg, put them into a por- 
celain-lined preserving kettle, (uncovered,) and 
add, gradually, the sugar. Boil the tomatos and 
sugar slowly together, till the scum ceases to ap- 
pear. Then add, gradually, the lemons, (peel and 
juice,) and boil slowly for an hour or more. The 
tomatos must all have bursted, otherwise they will 
not keep, from the sugar not getting sufficiently 
into them. When done, take them off the fire, 
and transfer to glass jars the tomatos with their 
syrup. 

For yellow preserves take yellow tomatos, scald 
and peel them, and prick each with a silver fork 
Lay them in a porcelain preserving kettle with 
pieuiy of fresh vine leaves under and over them. 
Boll them with the vine leaves till they become a 
iSno: yellow. Then wash out the kettle anA boil 
the i-jmatos, as above, with the wJiite suga,, and 
add the lemon.

to turn in the least red. Scald and peel them, 
and lay them in a porcelain kettle with plenty of 
fresh vine leaves at the bottom. Cover them 
thickly with another layer of vine leavv>3 at tho 
top. Boil them very slowly with the vine leaves 
till they have all turned j^ellow. Then take them 
out, and spread them on large dishes. Wash the 
kettle, put in fresh vine leaves under and over the 
tomatos. They should become a fine green with 
the second boiling in vine leaves; otherwise re- 
peat the greening. Ilien take them out, vv^ash :e 
kettle again, and return the tomatos to it with 
a pound and a Jialf of while svgcxr to each pound 
of tomatos. Boil and skim, till all is clear and 
nice. Then add the grated 3^ellow rind and the 
juice of one large lemon to every pound of to- 
matos, and boil slowly an hour longer. All the 
tomatos should burst, that the sugar may tho- 
roughly enter the inside. Before you cover tho 
jars, stir into each an additional quarter or half 
pound of pov/dered sugar. Green tomatos re- 
quire a high flavoring of lemon, as they have no 
peculiar taste of their own.

PRESERVED QUINCES. — Take the large.st 
and ripest yellow quinces; after they have re- 
mained on the trees till the first frost Wipe tnem 
clean, and boil them whole till they are tender all 
through, and can be easily penetrated with a 
splinter skewer. Save and strain the water in 
which they were boiled. When cool, pare aad 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 561 

core the quinces, and carefully remove the blem. 
ishes. To every pound of fruit allow a pound of 
tlie best double-refined loaf sugar. Make a syrup 
of the water in which the quinces were boiled, 
allowing half a pint. of this water to every pound 
of sugar. When melted, set it in a porcelain 
kettle over a moderate fire, and boil and skim 
it till no more scum appears. Then put in the 
fruit, either whole or quartered, or cut into 
circular slices about half an inch thick; and boil 
it uncovered. When the quinces are quite clear 
and soft, (but not the least broken) take them 
out, and spread them on large flat dishes. Af- 
terwards transfer them to larg^^ glass jars, rather 
more than half filled; pour the syrup warm over 
them ; and when cool cover the jars, and tie pieces 
of bladder over the covers. You may boil, by 
themselves, the cores and parings, in as much 
water as will cover them well, till they are entirely 
dissolved. Then strain them through a linen bag, 
and while hot stir in as much powdered loaf 
sugar as will form a thick jelly. If the quinces 
have been preserved whole, fill up with this jelly 
the holes left by the cores ; or if sliced, spread 
the jelly over the slices. Quinces soon become 
very hard and tough, unless they have been well 
boiled by themselves, before putting them into the 
lugar. Merely scalding or coddling them is not 
sufficient. If you have not jelly for filling up 
the holes, substitute marmalade. To keep quinces 
w^ii, requires plenty of rich syrup. 



562 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 

PKESERYED CRAB- APPT.ES. — Take tlie 
finest Siberian crab-apples, which being always 
red, and having a pleasant acid, are the only sort 
now used for preserving. Rub each crab-apple 
with a dry clean flaiinel, and ihen prick every one 
in several places with a large needle to prevent 
their bursting. To every pound of fruit allow a 
pound and a half of double-refined loaf sugar, 
and a pint of water. First make a syrup of the 
sugar and water, boiling it in a porcelain kettle, 
and skimming it till perfectly clear. Put in the 
crab-apples, adding for each pound the juice and 
grated yellow rind of a large lemon. The lemon 
is indispensable to this sweetmeat. Simmer them 
slowly in this syrup till tender all through, so that 
they can be pierced with a twig of broom-corn ; 
but do not allow them to break. When done, 
put them up warm in glass jars more than half 
full, and the syrup over them. You may heighten 
the fine red color with a little prepared cochineal 
—that is, cochineal powder kept in a bottle after 
being boiled with alum and cream of tartar. 

Bellflower Apples or Large Pippins — May De pre- 
served whole in the above manner. They look 
handsomely on a supper table, covered all over 
with a thick meringue or icing flavored with le* 
mon or rose, and spread smoothly over ovcry 
apple with a real rose-bud stuck in the top of each 
You may color the icing a beautiful pink, bj alix

PEESERYED CnERBTES.— No cherries are 
worth preserving except morellas, or the large 
Virginia red, or carnation cherries. Stem and 
stone them carefully, saving the juice ; and strew 
them thickly with powdered white sugar. To a 
quart of cherries allow a pound of the best loaf 
sugar. Make a syrup, allowing half a pint of water 
to a pound of sugar. Boil and skim it, and when 
the scum has ceased to rise put in the cherries 
and their juice, and give them a slow boil up. 
Put them up warm in glass or white- ware jars, 
and tie bladder over the lids.

FINE PRESERYED STRAWBERRIES.— 
Have ready two sorts of strawberries, one half 
being of the largest and finest scarlet sort, (not 
loo ripe,) the other smaller and less expensive, but 
quite ripe and perfectly fresh and nice. Put the 
smaller ones into a percelain kettle, having allowed 
three quarters of a pound of double-refined loaf 
sugar to every quart of fruit. Boil the sugar and 
small strawberries together ; skimming well, and 
stirring down to the bottom after evey tkimming, 
and mashing it to a jam. When done, set it to 
cool in a large pan ; wash the kettle clean, or take 
another one, and make in it a clear syrup, allow- 
ing to each pound of the best loaf sugar a small 
half pint of water. When melted set it over the 
(ire, and boii and skim till the scum ceases to 
rise Put the large strawberries in this, and give 
them one boil up. If boiled too long they v/ill 



564 MISS LESLIE^S NEW CoOK B60K 

break. As soon as they have come to a boil take 
them (one at a time,) with a silver tea-£f)Oon, and 
lay them separately on large flat dishes. Then 
mix the syrup with the jam thoroughly together, 
and boil it a quarter of an hour. Put the large 
btrawberries, one at a time, into glass jars, (more 
than half full,) and fill up to the top with the 
hot jam. When cool lay a round of brandy paper 
on the surface, and secure the lids by tying pieces 
of bladder over them.

STRAWBERRIES IN WINE.— Put a small 
quart of fine large scarlet strawberries into a glass 
jar, having sprinkled among them a quarter of a 
pound of the best loaf sugar. Fill up the jar 
*v'ith madeira or sherry. They are served at par- 
ties in small glass saucers, heaped on the top with 
whipped cream, or with white ice cream. What 
is sold by many confectioners as strawberry ice 
cream, has in reality no strawberries about it ; as 
may be known by its beautiful rose color, such as 
strawberry juice never produces, particularly after 
being preserved with sugar. This fine delicate 
pink tinge comes in reality from alkanet. Mopt 
of what is called strawberry cordial, is in reality 
alcohol colored with that elegant dye.

them ; set them in a large kettle of cold water, 
and place it in a moderate heat till it gradually 
comes to a boil. Then let it boil but five minutca. 
Cork the jars, and seal them closely before ycj 
take them out of the water. Use the cement of 
two-thirds resin and one-third beeswax. Keep the 
jar for four weeks in a dry cool place. By 
that time you will find the strawberries with a 
thick white scum at the top, and a clear juice at 
the bottom. Pour it into clean bottles, through 
a funnel with a fine straining cloth. Cork the 
bottles, but do not drive the corks hard down, lest 
the bottles should burst if too tight. Arrange 
the bottles on the kitchen rnantleshelf, where they 
may have some heat from the fire. You will see 
when a vinous fermentation takes place. It may 
continue a week. When it has entirely subsided, 
and is very clear, strain off the liquid from the 
sediment into fresh bottles, and cork them tightly. 
When you put them away, lay the bottles on their 
sides. This is a delicious cordial, and requires 
no brandy in it. 

Preserved Gooseberries, — Top and tail the goose- 
berries, which sliould be of two sorts, and as ripe 
as you can get. The best kind quite ripe, large, 
and of a light amber color. Wash the others, 
and boil them in a porcelain kettle with barely 
water enough to keep them from burning. When 
they are soft and broken, mash the pulp through 
a sieve, or squeeze it through a linen bag. Mea- 
sure it, and to each pint allow a large pound of 
powdered loaf sugar. Boil the sugar with the

pulp^ skimming and stirring it till it begin-s to 
jelly. Then put in the large gooseberries, and 
give them one boil up. Vf hen done take them 
out separately, and spread them on a large flat 
dish. Continue to boil the syrup a while longer, 
till you find it congeals well on holding out a 
spoonful in the open aii-. Then put the large 
gooseberries into jars, and pour the syrup over 
them while still hot and liquid. Put them up 
warm. 

Raspberries — May be preserved as above, re« 
serving the finest for putting whole into the jelly. 
The large white raspberries make a fine sweetmeat, 
done whole in jelly or jam of white currants. 

Black currants should always be made into jelly 
or jam. They require less sugar than other sweet- 
meats, (a quarter of a pound less) their juice beiag 
naturally very thick.

COXJIS^TRY PLUMS. — Gatlver your pluma 
when perfectly ripe, and ready to fall from the 
trees. Split them with a knife, and remove the 
stones. Spread them out on large dishes, so as 
not to touch, and set them in the hot sun on 
a sunny roof or balcony ; taking them, in every 
evening before dark, and not putting them out 
till after the dew is off in the morning. Kepeat 
this for three or four days. Then pack them down 
in stone jars with a large quantity of the best 
brown sugar, a layer of plums and a layer of su- 
gar alternately, (sugar being at the bottom and

lop) and cover the jars closely. Let them remain 
undisturbed till February or March. When 
opened, you will have plenty of rich syrup among 
them. They make good spring pies, and will b6 
prized for family use at that season. 

Country Grapes.— H\iQ little wild grapes have a 
very pleasant taste after the first frost in the au- 
tumn, and should not be gathered till that time. 
Until frosted, they are too sour to eat. To keep 
them all winter, strip them from the stems and 
put them in stone jars with layers of good brown 
sugar, till the jars are three parts full. Then fill 
up to the top with West India molasses. They 
will make good winter pies, when cranberries, 
dried peaches, and dried apples are scarce. 

Persimmon Jam. — Do not gather persimmons 
till late in the fall, when they are well sweetened 
with the frost. They are unfit to eat till all the 
leaves are off the trees, and till they are ripe 
enough to mash. Then pack them in jars with 
plenty of brown sugar. Maple sugar will do. In 
the back- woods they will be valued. When cooked 
they will be improved by the addition of a little 
«we€i cider.

PICKLES. 

For pickles the articles should all be fino an6 
freshlj gathered. Tbey are generally too hard 
to be cut or eaten conveniently, and there is too 
much unnecessary fear of pickles proving soft. 
It is not now customary to keep them for weeks 
in salt and water ; two or three days will be suf- 
ficient for this part of the process, and some kinds 
do not require it at all. The arts of both pre- 
serving and pickling are of late years much sim- 
plified. All pickles have nearly the same taste, 
and there is no use (and much trouble) in multiply- 
ing varieties, when a few sorts of the very best 
will be found amply sufficient for any table. One 
important point to be always observed, is to use 
none but the most wholesome vinegar, (the genuine 
cider,) as all that is made of drugs is unwhole- 
Bome to the eater and destructive to the pickles. 
On no consideration boil them in brass, copper, 
or bell-metal — things which fortunately are now 
nearly exploded from all kitchens; ir^*^ lined 
with Delft, (called porcelain,) being universally 
substituted. 

To green pickles boil them with a thick bed of 
fresh vine leaves, both under and over them. 
This will first render them yellow ; then boil 
them a^aiii in a clean kettle with fresh v'^i:z leaves. 
If not. green enough when you tliink they are 
•lone, repeat the boiling again, with fresh vine 



MISS lesltk's new cook book. 569 

leaves and fresh water. Avoid eating pickles 
that are of a fine verdigris green. They are 
greened with copper, and are poisonous. 

If you cannot obtain vine leaves, you may 
green pickles by boiling them with fresh cabbage 
leaves under and over. The first boiling will 
turn them yellow, the second with new leaves 
should render them green. But vine leaves are 
better and more certain. Put them up warm in 
stone or, glass jars with broad flat corks ; and tie 
kid leather over them. 



»**'^A^^<^i^^'A^SW»~. 



IKDIA PICKLE. — For this pickle you may 
use a variety of young fruits and vegetables. For 
instance, red cherries, grapes, plums, apricots, 
young peaches, or lemons, limes, button-tomatos, 
cauliflowers sliced, white cabbage sliced, hard- 
boiled eggs sliced, little onions, nasturtions, small 
cucumbers, &c. Having nicely prepared these 
things, put them all together into a large porce- 
lain kettle, and scald them in a strong brine made 
in the proportion of a quarter of a pound of fine 
salt to a quart of boiling water. Pour it hot 
over the pickles, and let them remain in it till 
next day. Then take them out, and drain off all 
the brine through a sieve. Spread them out (so 
as not to touch,) on large flat dishes or old japan 
servers, and set them in the hot sun for three or 
four days ; carefully taking them in at evening, 
and if the weather becomes damp or ooudy. 
Afterwards put them into a cullender oi sieve.

wash, tbem well through cold water, and then 
wipe them all dry with a coarse cloth. Put then> 
into a large pan. Mix together a quarter pound 
of grated horse-radish, sliced ; two cloves of gar- 
lic; half a hundred small white onions; two 
ounces of mace; a quarter of a pound of ground 
ginger; two nutmegs, powdered; two pounds of 
powdered loaf sugar ; half a bottle of the best 
ground mustard ; half a pound of yellow mustard 
seed, and an ounce of turmeric powder, which 
must on no account be omitted, as a yellow tinge 
is indispensable to this pickle. Mix all the sea- 
soning with sufficient excellent cider vinegar to 
render it liquid, and pour it o^er the pickles in 
the pan, and then stir them up from the bottom. 
Let the whole rest till cold. Then transfer it to 
stone jars. Have ready some more vinegar, pour 
it boiling hot on the pickles, &c., but do not fill up 
to the top, as they expand and rise.

PICKLED PEACHES.— Take eight fine large 
free-stone peaches, (white or yellow,) when nearly 
but not quite ripe. Wipe oflT the down with a 
clean flannel, and put them into a brine strong 
enough to bear up an egg. In two days take 
them out, and drain them for several hours on an 
inverted sieve. Tie in a piece of thin muslin one 
ounce of whole white pepper ; one of brokcn-up 
ginger ; eight blades of mace, and two ounces of 
mustard seed. Boil this seasoning for ten minutes 
\n a quart of the best cider vinegar Lay tb«

peaches in a broad- mouthed stone jar, with the 
bag of spice at the bottom, and pour the vinegar 
boiling hot upon them. At the top add a table- 
spoonful of salad oil. Put them up warm, and 
secure them with broad flat corks, and rounds ,£ 
leatlie! tied on carefully. 

Peach Mangoes. — The above sort of peaches are 
best for mangoes. Steep them in brine for two 
days. Cut a small piece out of each, and carefully 
loose the stones from the inside with a small sharp 
knife. It will then be easy to thrust them out of 
free-stone peaches, and none others should be used, 
either for pickling or preserving. Make a filling 
for the places that were occupied by the stones. 
For this purpose, use fresh mustard seed moist- 
ened with vinegar; scraped horse-radish, pow- 
dered ginger, a clove of garlic, or a minced shalot 
or very small onion, and a very little chilli or red 
pepper minced very small. Also a little powdered 
mace, and a little chopped peach. AVith this mix- 
ture stuff the peaches hard. Eeplace the bits 
that were cut off, and tie them on firmly with 
fine packthread, crossing the peach. Boil a quart 
of the best vinegar, seasoned with white spices 
and mustard seed, tied up in muslin ; and when 
it has boiled ten minutes, pour it hot over the 
peach mangoes in a stone jar. Add at the top a 
table spoonful of salad oil ; cork the jar imme* 
diatcly, and tie leather over it. AY here there is 
no dislike to cloves, you may stick half a doz;on

MELON MANGOES.— Take the small i^reei. 
melons, used only for this purpose, and let them 
lie iu a strong brine for two days. Take them 
Dut and drain them well. Cut a small square bit 
)iat of one side, and through this hole extract all 
the seeds and filaments. Have ready a stuffing 
made of grated horse-radish, white mustard seed, 
minced shalot, or a clove of garlic chopped fine; 
a very little chilli or red pepper, and a little pow- 
dered mace. Wet this stuffing well with vinegar, 
md then fill with it the cavity of the mango. 
Replace the bit that was cut out, ajid tie it in with 
Dackthread, crossing all over the melon. Then 
place the mangoes in a stone jar. Have ready a 
sufficiency of the best vinegar, (a large quart or 
more, for eight or ten mangoes,) boiled ten min- 
utes, with a seasoning of mustard seed, ginger, 
mace, grated horse-radish, and chopped shalot oi 
little onion, or a clove of garlic minced very 
small — all tied in a bit of muslin. Pour the vi- 
negar boiling hot over the mangoes, having placed 
among them the bag of seasoning. Finish with 
Bweet oil at the top of the jar.

MUSHROOMS PICKLED.— For pickling, the 
small button mushrooms are best. After cutting 
off the ataJk closely, and with a sharp penknife 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 573 

peeling off carefully their thin outsid?. skin, mea- 
sure two quarts, taking care that they are all of 
the right sort, and freshly gathered ; the outside 
of u dull whitish color, and the underside of a 
fine pinkish salmon tinge. If very white abov6 
and below, or if bright yellow, they are poisonous. 
OtH)d mushrooms grow alwaj^s in open fields or 
or airy places; never in woods or marshes. To 
pickle two quarts, prepare eight little bags of 
very clear muslin; and tie up in each bag sis 
blades of mace, six slices of root ginger, and half 
a nutmeg broken up. Uave ready four glass jars, 
such as are considered to hold a quart. Lay a bag 
of spice in the bottom of each. Having sprinkled 
the mushrooms well with salt, let them rest tiii 
next day. Then divide the mushrooms and their 
liquor into four pints. Put one pint into each jar, 
with a bag of spice at the bottom, and another at 
the top. Pour on boiling cider vinegar of the 
best quality, and finish with a table-spoonful of 
salad oil. Cork the jars immediately, and tie 
leather carefully over the top. All mushrooms 
turn brown on the under-side the day after they 
ure gathered, and sometimes sooner. 

Boiling the spice in the vinegar will weaken 
the mushroom flavor. When you open a jar of 
pickled mushrooms, immediately cork it again; 
tie on the leather cover, and use it up as soon aa 
possible. Therefore, p'.nt jars, with half a pint 
of m.udirooms ia each, are convenient.

BELL-PEPPERS PICKLED.— Take fin« full 
grown bell-peppers. Make a brine in a stone jar 
of salt and water, strong enough to float an egg 
and let the peppers remain in it two days, putting 
a weight on the cover to keep it down. Then take 
them out, wash them well in cold water, drain 
them, and wipe them dry. Cut a slit in the side 
of each, and extract all the seeds, as if left in, they 
will be entirely too hot. Through these slits let 
all the water run out. Put them into a clean 
stone jar. Boil sufficient of the best cider vine- 
gar, interspersed with the muslin bags of broken- 
up cinnamon, mace, and nutmeg. Pour it, boiling 
hot, Ou the peppers in the jar. Distribute the bags 
of spice among the peppers, and cork the jar 
warm. You may stuff the peppers in the manner 
of mangoes, with pickled red cabbage 5nely 
shred, minced onions and minced cucumbers 
pickled, and seasoned with a little mustard seed, 
ginger, and mace. Tie up the slit with pack- 
thread, crossing all round. Fill up the jars with 
vinegar, putting sweet oil on the top. 

Your may green bell- peppers in the usual way, 
with vine leaves or cabbage leaves. 

All pickles should be kept in a dry place. If 
you find them mouldy they are not always spoiled. 
Take them out of the jar, wipe off all the mould 
carefully and throw away the vinegar. Wash the 
jai very clean, scald it, and set it in the sun to 
purify still more. Make a new pickle with fresh 
seasoning, and put them into that. 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 575 

PICKLED CAULIFLOWERS. — Take large, 
ripe, full-blovvTi cauliflowers. Remove the leaves 
and stalk, and divide the blossom into pieces or 
clusters of equal size. Throw them into a porce- 
lain kettle of boiling water, (adding a little salt,) 
let them simmer, and skim tbem well. When 
they come to a boil, take them up with a perfo- 
rated skimmer, and lay them on a sieve to drain. 
Put them into stone jars, (three parts full.) Sea- 
son with mace and nutmeg infused in sufficient 
of the best cider vinegar, and simmer it for a 
quarter of an hour. When it comes to a boil take 
it off the fire, and pour it hot over the cauliflower 
in the jar, filling quite up to the top, and adding 
sweet oil at the last. Cover it while warm, and 
tie leather over the top. If you wish to have the 
cauliflowers yellow, boil with the vinegar some 
turmeric powder tied up in thin muslin. This is a 
very nice pickle. 

Brocoli is done in the same manner, but should 
be previously greened by boiling it with vine 
leaves. 

PICKLED BEETS WITH CABBAGE.-^Take 
a large fine red cabbage, wash it well, and drain 
it. Quarter it, (having removed the stalk) and 
Blice it with a cabbage-cutter as for coldslaw 
Boil some beets in the usual way till quite tea

of the shred cftbbage, till tlie jar is more than 
half full. Have ready some scalding vinegar 
that has been boiled with a seasoning of blades 
of mace and sliced gmger root, and some nutmeg. 
Pour the vinegar, boiling hot, upon the cabbage 
and beet, till you have the jars quite full. Finish 
with .a large table-spoonful of sweet oil. Cover 
the jar with leather, and put it away warm.

PICKLED CUCUMBERS.— Take small young 
cucumbers, freshly gathered, and free from ble- 
mishes. Make a brine strong enough to float an 
egg^ and let the cucumbers lie in it till they be- 
come yellow, stirring them down to the bottom twice 
a day. Then pour off all the brine, wash the cu- 
cumbers in cold water, and drain them. Lay a 
thick bed of fresh green vine leaves in the bottom 
and sides of a porcelain kettle. Put in the cu- 
cumbers, and pour on sufficient cold water to wet 
them all plentifully. Then cover them, closely, 
with more vine leaves, and pour on more water, 
packing the leaves well and pressing them down.

'*er them to a very clean stone jar. To fifty cucum 
oers allow four quarts of excellent vinegar, and a 
bit of alum about the size of a large grain of corn, 
with half an ounce of mustard seed, half an ounce 
of mace, a broken-up nutmeg, and half an ounce 
of root ginger, sliced. Tie up the spice in ttiree 
muslin bags, and boil them ten minutes in the vi- 
negar. Then take out and lay them among the 
cucumbers in the jar; one to the bottom, one in 
the middle, and one at the top. Pour over them 
the vinegar boiling hot ; add a table-spoonful of 
sweet oil, and cork the jar immediately, tying a 
leather over it. Keep wooden pickle spoons in 
the pantry for taking out pickles, and always be 
careful to close the jar immediately after. 

You nee I not keep the bags of spice in the jars 
more than two or three weeks.

PICKl SD ONIONS.— Take the small silver- 
skinne(3 white onions. Peel off the outer skin. 
Make n brine strong enough to float an eggj skim 
it well, and when it begins to cool pour it upon 
the onions. Let them stand in it (closely co- 
vered,) till quite cold. Then take them out, peel 
off another skin, and wash them through a cul- 
lender in C'-ld water. Next, boil them in milk till 
tender all fiirough, so that you can easily pierce 
them with a needle. Then drain off the milk. 
Measure tlom, and to a quart of onions allow a 
quart of the best cider vinegar. Boil in the vi 
aegar two muslin bags tied up with broken-up

nutmeg and mace. When it has boiled, pour it 
hot over the onions in the jar ; having laid one 
bag of spice at the bottom, and one in the middle. 
The onions should fill two thirds of the jar, and 
the vinegar the remainder. Finish with a table* 
spoonful of salad oil, and cork the jar imme- 
diately, and tie on the leather cover. 

As onions pickled this way are generally much 
liked, it is well, when doing them, to make 
several jars full. 

Cucumber and Onion Pickle. — To a dozen fine 
cucumbers allow three large onions. Pare the 
cucumbers and peel the onions, and cut both into 
thick slices. Sprinkle salt and pepper over them, 
and let them rest till next day. Then drain them 
well, and put them into a stone jar. Pour boil* 
ing vinegar over them. Close the jar, and set it 
in a warm place. Next day repeat the boiling 
vinegar, and cork the jar. Next day repeat it 
again, with a bag of mace, nutmeg, and ginger, 
boiled in the vinegar. Then cork the jar, and tie 
it up. When the pickle is finished, divide it in 
small stone jars, with sweet oil on the top of each.

WALNUTS OR BUTTERNUTS PICKI/ED 
—Gather them in early summer, when they are 
full-grown, but so tender that a large needle 
will easily pierce them all through. Rub off the 
outer skin with a coarse cloth, and then lay them 
in salt and water for a week, changing the brine 
every other day. A-llow for this brine a small

q<Aart'*r of a pound of salt to a large quart of wa- 
ter. Make enough to cover all the nuts well 
Place a large lid over the pan, and keep them 
closely from the air. The last day take them out 
of the brine, drain them, and prick every one 
quite through in several places with a large 
needle. Drain them again, spread them out 
on large flat dishes, and set them to blacken for- 
two days in the hot sun. For a hundred nuts, 
allow a gallon of excellent cider vinegar, half an 
ounce of black pepper-corns, half an ounce of 
cloves, half an ounce of allspice, an ounce of root 
ginger, and an ounce of mace. Boil the spice 
in the vinegar for ten minutes, tied up in eight 
small muslin bags. Then take them out, and hav- 
ing divided the nuts in four stone jars, distri- 
bute among them, equally, the bags of spice, and 
pour on the vinegar hot, an eqaal portion in each 
jar. While warm, secure them with flat corks, 
and tie leather over them. Done this way, you 
may begin to use them in a week. If you have 
not enough of vinegar to fill the jars up to the 
top, add some cold, and strew among the nuta 
some blades of mace. Finish with a large spoon- 
ful of salad oil at the top of each jar. 



>»#rf^#^^<#^^W«^~• 



PICKLED PLUMS.— Take large fine plums; 
perfect, and quite ripe. To every quart of plums 
allow half a pound of the best white sugar pow- 
dered, and a large pint of the best cider vinegar. 
Melt the sugar in the vinegar, and put it with tb«

fruit into a porcelain kettle; all the plums having 
been previously pricked to the stone with a large 
needle. Lay among them some small muslin 
bags filled with broken nutmeg, mace, and cinna- 
mon ; and if you choose, a few cloves. Give them 
one boil up, skimming them well. Put them 
warm into stone jars, with the bags interspersed, 
and cork them immediately. Green gages may 
be done in this manner, first rendering them 
greener by boiling with vine leaves in the usual 
way. 

Damsons Pickled. — Do these in the same raannei 
as plums ; but as they are much more acid, all'^w 
'crown sugar of the best kind. Plums or damsons 
may be pickled plain, and with little trouble if 
full ripe, pricked with a needle, and packed down 
in a stone jar with profuse layers of brown sugar 
between the layers of fruit ; the jars filled up with 
cold cider vinegar, and putting sweet oil at the top. 



M^^^^<<^i^^y\^s/» 



Pichled Cherries. — Take the largest and finest 
red cherries, fully ripe. Morellas are the best. 
Either remove the stems entirely, or cut them 
short, within two inches of the fruit. Have ready 
a large glass jar. Fill it two thirds with fresh 
newly-gathered cherries, and then fill up to the 
top with the best vinegar. Keep it well covered, 
and if both fruit and vinegar are of excellent 
quality, no boiling is necessary, and no spice, aa 
the cherry flavor will be retained, and they «^iU 
not shrivel. 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 581 

Button Tomatos. — ^ The small round tomator, 
either red or yellow, will keep perfectly, if put 
whole into cold vinegar of the really best qua- 
lity. You may add a bag of spice if you choose 

Nasturtion Seeds. — Keep a large glass jar of 
cold cider vinegar, and put in the green seeds of 
nusturtions after the flowers are off, and the seedi 
full-grown, but not hard. Eemove the stalks. 
In this simple way nasturtions will keep perfectly 
well, and are an excellent substitute for caper? 
with boiled mutton. They can be raided pro- 
fusely, even in a city garden, and the blossoms are 
very beautiful. With pepper-grass and nastur- 
tion flowers from your own garden, you can have 
a nice salad for a summer evening tea-table. 

The three pickles above (cherries, button toma- 
tos, and nasturtion seeds,) are cheap, easy, and 
palatable. Try them. To flavor them with spice, 
boil the vinegar with a bag of spice in it, and pouj 
it on hot, leaving the bag among them in the jar 



PEEPAHATIONS FOR THE SICK 

CillCKEN BROTH.— Skin and cut up a lir.o 
full-grown fowl. If but little is wanted, ti;ke 
only the dark meat for the broth, and put it into 
a pot with a small quart of water, and slowly boil 
it to rags. Strain the liquid and return it to the 



582 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

pot. and thicken it with two spoonfuls of arrow 
root, if no vegetables are permitted. Otherwise, 
you may boil with the chicken some sliced onion 
and sliced turnip, with a grated parsnip and a 
sliced potato, straining out the vegetables with 
the shreds of fowl. You may reserve the white 
meat of the breast and wings to make another 
dish, if the patient is permitted to take it. This 
is the white meat cut off the bones, and stewed 
slowly in fresh oyster liquid, with a bit of nice 
butter. If the patient is well enough, stir in a 
beaten egg just before the stew is taken from the 
fire. 

Oyster Soup for Invalids. — Remove the gristh 
from a dozen fine large fresh oysters. Take hal) 
their liquor and mix it with an equal portion o*^ 
very good milk, seasoning it with three or four 
blades of mace, and a stalk of celery scraped and 
cut into pieces. When it has boiled and been 
skimmed well, strain it over the oysters, and ict 
all simmei together till the oysters are plumped, 
but do not let them come to a boil. Serve it up 
in a bowl, with some milk biscuit to eat with it. 

Clam Soup for Invalids. — Where salt is per- 
mitted, cut up and boil slowly in their own liquor 
a dozen or more small sand clams. When well 
boiled and skimmed, strain the liquor into a clean 
??auce-pan, and thicken it with bread crumbs, and a 
8i\«?J.l bit of nice fresh butter. The clams Me of 
QC further use. Throw them away. 



MTRs lkst,tf:'s new cook book. 5S'j 

MUTTON BEOTH FOE THE SICK.— Take 

iwo pounds from a nice neck of mutton, and leave 
out some of the fat if there seems too much. 
Cut the meat from the bones, and put it into a pot 
wirh a large quart of water, and no seasoning. 
Boil it till the meat is all in rags. Bo not skim 
it, as the fat on the surface is very healing, if 
without salt or pepper. When done, strain it into 
a bowl. Let the patient eat with it a slice of 
very light wheat bread, having the crust cut off. 
It is excellent for the dysentery. When the pa- 
tient is convalescent, a little seasoning may be 
allowed, and gome well-boiled mashed turnips 
stirred into the bowl of soup with a boiled onion 
sliced, and a thickening of arrow-root or farina, 
stirred in about half an hour before the soup ia 
taken up. Pour it off clear from the shreds of 
meat at the bottom. 

Veal Bro*h for Invalids. — Take a pound of 
knuckle of veal cut in pieces, four calf's feet, 
split up. Boil them in a large quart of water, 
till they are all reduced to rags. Then strain the 
liquid, and add to it the soft part, only, of half a 
dozen fine oysters, and three or four blades of 
mace. Set it again on the fire, and as soon as it 
jimmers, well take it off, and serve it up with very 
light milk biscuit, or little bread rolls, to eat with it. 
Veal broth may be made with a piece of knuckle 
of veal cut small, and boiled in the liquor of claras 
insi sad of water. The clams themselves must be 
omitted, as they are always tough and indigestible 
for va invalid, but th^ir liquor adds a pleaoiitit 
36 



584 MISS Leslie's new cook book 

relish to the insipidity of the veal. As tho 
etrength of the patient improves, a grated carrot, 
a sliced onion, and some sliced turnip, may be 
added to the veal from the beginning. 

Raw Oysters for the Sick. — Take large fine fresh 
oysters, and carefully cut out the hard part or 
gristle. They are considered very good for conva- 
lescents, being, when raw, cooling, refreshing, and 
nutritious. Drain them well from the liquor, 
making them as dry as you can; and if permitted, 
accompany the oysters with black pepper and vi- 
negar, and a plate of bread and butter. 

Birds. — Convalescents, not yet allowed to eat 
meat, can generally relish birds nicely broiled, or 
stewed in their own gravy, with any appropriate 
seasoning, and a little fresh butter, if they are not 
very fat. When dished, lay under each a piece of 
nice toast, dipped for a minute in hot water. 

Beefsteak for Invalids. — When this can be eateo 
with an appetite, there is no greater promoter ot 
returning health ; but it must be of the best sir 
loin steak, very tender, well broiled, and tho« 
roughly done on both sides, the gravy being care- 
fully saved to serve up with it, a little fresh 
butter being added after the meat com.es off the 
gridiron. If the taste of onion is desired, merely 
rub the plate with a peeled onion. A very tender 
lamb-chop well broiled may be eaten by way of 
change ; but a tenderloin steak is better. Avoid 
pork, or veal cutlets. 

- Gravy Sippets. — For invalids who cannot yet eat 
meatt a light aod relishing pxeparatioti naay be

ma(]e with one or two slices of the best whea\ 
bread, divested of the crust, and spread on a hoi 
plate, while some nice well-skimmed gravy is 
poured over them ; the gravy of roast beef, veal, 
or mutton, that has had no butter about it. G/avy 
sippets will form a variety to the usual broths, 
and other beginnings for the resumption of animal 
food. 

HERB TEAS. — Have one or more china or 
white- ware pots for the purpose of making herb 
teas ; and see that, after using, they are well 
washed, well scalded and dried, and set open in 
the sun till wanted again. The herbs, whether 
green or dried, should be of excellent quality, 
and picked very clean from dust and stems. 
Having well-scalded the pot, take the allotted 
quantity of the herb and put it in ; then pour on 
the water, which must be actually boiling at the 
time, and press the herbs down at the bottom with 
a silver spoon. Then put on the lid closely, and 
immediately stop up the spout with a small cork, 
or a wad of ^oft white paper rolled tightly. This 
is to keep in the steam, and prevent the strength 
of the herb from escaping. When sufficiently 
boiled, pour into a pitcher with a lid, and through 
a strainer, as much of the tea as is wanted. Strain- 
ers of block tin, with a handle and ve^y fine close 
holes, are excellent for this and other purposes. 

Herb Candies. — Hoarhound candy, and many 
others, may be made of a strong decoction or tea 
of the herbjthickened-WJJthJoaf sugar, and boitei. 



586 MISS Leslie's new cook book. 



skimmed, and stirred till very thick and stiff 
Then pour it smoothly into a square tin pan and 
set it in a cool place to congeal. While still soft, 
mark it in even squares with a knife. When 
quite cold and hard, loosen it from the pan with 
a knife, and take it out. It is good for coughs. 

Peppermint candy is made in the same way, and 
is used for flatulence. 



►^■^«^*sA*\»« 



GKUEL. — Gruels, for patients who are unable 
to take any thing more substantial, may be made 
of ground rice flour, arrow root, indian meal, oat- 
meal grits, or farina. Mix to a paste, with water, 
two large table-spoonfuls of any of the above ar- 
ticles ; then stir the paste, gradually, into a pint of 
water boiling on the fire, making it very smooth 
and pressing out all the lumps. To prevent it 
boiling over, when it has risen nearly to the top 
of the pan, remove it from the fire. Sweeten it 
while hot, and, if permitted, add a little white wine 
with nutmeg, and a small bit of fresh butter. 

Toast and Water. — Cut a large slice or\wo of 
the best wheat bread ; pare off all the crust ; and 
with a long-handled toasting fork toast it evenly 
on both sides, not allowing it to blacken or burn 
in any pant. While hot from the fire, plunge the 
toast immediately into a quart pitcher of clear 
cold water. Cover the pitcher instantly, and let 
it infuse for half an hour or more, without leav* 
Ing off the cover. When done, it should be of a 
Vftty pale brown color. 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 587 

JELLY WATER. — Stir a table-spoonful of 
currant jelly into a half pint tumbler of ice water, 
if the patient is feverish. The jelly may be of 
other fruit; and if not sweet enough add some 
loaf sugar. The juice of any ripe fruit, made 
sweet and mixed with cold water, is a good sub- 
stitute when sweetmeats are not at hand. Warm 
drinks are now seldom used, but to promote per 
spiration and carry off a cold. Tamarinds are in 
themselves very cooling and pleasant, and make 
an agreeable drink infused in water, either warm 
or cold. 

CARRAGEEN BLANCMANGE.— Carrageen 
is a species of sea moss whjiijh becomes glutinoua 
when boiled, and is considered remarkably nutri- 
tious and strengthening. It can also be rendered 
very palatable. It is found abundantly on some 
parts of our sea-coast, and may be obtained of the 
best druggists, very nicely cleaned and pressed. 
To a small loose handful of carrageen allow a 
small quart of rich unskimmed milk, half a pound 
of powdered white sugar, a stick of the best 
cinnamon broken-up, six or seven blades of mace, 
and half a nutmeg, powdered. Having washed 
the carrageen through two or three cold waters, 
and shaken it out to remove the drops that bang 
fthout it, put it to a pint and a half of the cold 
milk. Boil it half an hour in a covered porcelain 
kettle. Then take it out, for if it boils too long 
the carrageen will taste too strongly. In another 
vessel boil the remaining half pint of milk with 



588 MISS LESM!i:'s nkw cook book. 

the spices, till very highly flavored. Then strun 
it into the carrageen milk, and stir in, gradually, 
the half pound of powdered loaf sugar. Set the 
porcelain kettle again over the fire, and let it boil 
fa-st for five minutes longer. Then strain it into 
moulds or bowls previously wet with cold water ; 
and when it has well congealed, turn it out, and 
Berve it up with sweetened cream, flavored with 
rose-water or peach-water. If for an invalid, who 
is not allowed spices, flavor it with rose-water 
only, stirred in after the blancmange has been 
taken from the fire. 



■»*rfVS/\#-^-<^\^#^VA^ 



FARINA BLANCMANGE.— From a quart of 
rich milk take out half a pint. Put the half pint 
into a small sauce-pan, and add (if permitted) 
sufficient mace, nutmeg, and cinnamon to flavor it 
Vvell; the spices being tied up in a very thin 
muslin bag. Then add the flavored miik to the 
remainder, having stirred in two heaped table- 
epoonfuls of powdered loaf sugar. Set it over the 
fire in a porcelain kettle, and when it has come to 
a boil sprinkle in, gradually, four large heaping 
table-spoonfuls of farina, stirring it welL Keep 
it boiling a quarter of an hour after all the farina is 
iu When done, strain it into blancmange moulds, 
aid set it on ice to congeal. If for an invalid not 
alV. wed spice, boil it plain, and when taken from 
ii;i3 fire stir in a wine-glass of rose-water. If 
ijie-water is boiled with it from the beginning, 
lAd Strength and flavor will evaporate.

Farina Flummery. — ^fix with a small pint of 
/rater a large pint of the juice of ripe curranta 
or strawberries, or of stewed cranberries in win 
ter, made very sweet with white sugar. Boil the 
water and juice together, and stir in gradually a 
quarter pound of farina, and then boil it fifteen 
minutes longer. Afterwards transfer it to moulds, 
and set it on ice till congealed. 

Farina Gruel. — Ilave some water boiling on 
the fire, and when it boils fast, sprinkle in suffi- 
cient farina to make it moderately thick. Then 
sweeten it with white sugar. If permitted, stir in 
Home white wine, and nutmeg grated.

BEEF TEA.— Take a pound of fine fresh beef- 
steak cut from the round, without any fat. Chop 
it into small bits, and season it with a level salt- 
spoon of salt. Put it into a wide-mouthed bottle, 
cork it closely, and set it into a kettle of cold 
water, which must reach to the neck of the bottle. 
Let it boil steadily for three hours, by which time 
the essence will be all extracted from the beef. 
Tlien remove the cork, and strain the liquid into 
a bowl, and skim it. It can be made still more 
conveniently in a hain-marie or double kettle: an 
article useful foi many purposes, particular m 
cook.jry for an invalid. Mutton or veal tea are 
made in the same manner. Also chicken tea, or 
e^^sence of any sort of poultry or game.

panada. The dark meat will do for chicken tea. 
Add to the panada a slice of wheat bread crumbled 
and mixed in, and boil it in a bain-marie with the 
water outside ; seasoning it (if permitted) with 
powdered mace or nutmeg. 

Sweet Panada, — Mix with a pint of water a 
glass of madeira or sherry ; a heaped table-spoon- 
ful of powdered loaf sugar, half the yellow rind 
of a lemon grated, and half the juice ; and a half 
tea-spoonful of powdered nutmeg or mace. Set 
the mixture over the fire, and as soon as it boils 
add crumbled milk biscuit, or a rusk. Then giva 
it another boil up.

BARLEY WATER.— Having washed cleat 
two ounces of pearl barley, put it into a sauce-pai 
with a quart of water, the grated rind and thi? 
juice of a lemon, and two ounces of seeded rai- 
sins. Boil it slowly till the liquid is reduced one 
half. Then strain it, and sweeten it, while warm, 
with loaf sugar. 

Gum Arabic Water. — Take an ounce of the best 
and cleanest gum arabic. Put it into a pitcher, and 
pour on a pint of boiling water, and stir while dis- 
solving. When cool, squeeze in (if permitted) the 
juice of a lemon, and add loaf sugar enough to 
make it pleasantly sweet. Gum arabic water 
alone, is sometimes givpn to a patient, whom it is 
expedient to keep very low as a preventive to 
inflammation.

Tamarind Water. — ^This is a pleasant and cell- 
ing drink in fevers, allowing half a pint of cold 
water to as many tamarinds as you can take up 
with a table-spoon. Cover it, and let it stand for 
a few minutes. 

Apple Water. — Take four fine large juicy apples, 
(pippins or bellflowers,) core and pare them, and 
bake them side by side in a tin pan. When well 
done and quite soft all through, put them into a 
pitcher and fill up with warm water. Simmer 
them over the fire, and when quite soft mash 
them; and, if necessary, add more water till they 
become a thick liquid that can be drank. Sweeten 
well with loaf sugar, and if permitted, add some 
lemon juice or rose-water. Drink it cool. 

Bgg Wine. — Break a nice fresh egg into a tum- 
bler, and beat it till smooth and thick. Add a 
heaped tea- spoonful of powdered loaf sugar, and 
stir in a glass of the best port wine. This, when 
permitted, is very strengthening and cheering for 
an invalid, to take about the hour of noon or 
earlier. When wine is not allowed, you may beat 
the egg into a glass of new unskimmed milk. 



WHEY. — Milk can be converted into a curd 
by the infusion of rennet water, white wine, 
.emon juice, tamarind juice, or vinegar, stirred 
into good milk, covered and set in a warm place 
till the curd has formed, and has separated from 
the whey which remains beneath it. Take oif the 
ourd carefully, breaking it as little as possible, 



592 MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 

and put it into a deep dish. Pour the whey into 
a pitcher. It should look clear, and greenish 
rather than white, and have none of the milk curd 
remaining about it. Set the pitcher on ice. It 
is an excellent drink in fevers. When approvedi 
the curd may be eaten in a saucer with sugar. 
For rennet whey, cut a piece of dried rennet about 
two inches square, and wipe all the salt from the 
outside, but do not wash it. Soak the bit of ren- 
net for several hours (or all night) in a small tea- 
cup of lukewarm water. Then pour the rennet 
v/ater into the milk. For wine whey, boil a jiil 
of sherry in a pint of milk, without stirring it. 



*^^N/V#^'^>^'*V^^*~>« 



TAPIOCA. — Having washed in cold water 
thiee heaped table-spoonfuls of tapioca; drain it, 
put it into a clean quart bowl, pour on water 
enough to cover it well, and soak it four hours. 
Then pour on as much more water, transfer the 
whole to a porcelain skillet, in the bottom of which 
yoa have laid the yellow peel of a fresh lemon, 
pa?ed so thin as to be transparent, and boil the 
tapioca gently till it looks quite clear. Then take 
out the lemon peel, and stir insufiScient loaf sugar 
to make it very sweet. If approved, flavor it with 
Bome madeira or sherry, and some grated nutmeg. 
Tapioca may be boiled in plain milk, with no 
seasoning but the sugar to sweeten it. 

Sago. — Pick and wash clean, in two cold waters, 
ft half pint of sago. Put it into a po-rcelain skil- 
let, with the yellow rind of a lemon pared tran- 



MISS Leslie's new cook book:. 593 

sparent. Pour on it a quart of water, and let it 
all soak for two hours. Then set it over the fire, 
and boil it, gently, till the lemon is all to pieces 
and nearly dissolved, and the sago looks clear. 
Take out the lemon peel, and stir in, if permitted, 
gome sherry wine, sugar, and grated nutmeg, and 
give it another boil. 

If the above seasoning is not allowed, boil 
the sago in milk only, or water only, till the liquid 
becomes thick and like a jelly. 

Sago Pudding for an invalid. — Boil three table- 
spoonfuls of soaked sago in ai pint of milk till 
quite soft. Add gradually three ounces of white 
sugar, and set it away to cool. Beat three eggs 
till thick and smooth, and stir them by degrees 
mto the sago and milk. Grate in some nutmeg, 
and bake the pudding in a deep dish. Tapioca 
pudding is made in the same manner.

SWEETBEEADS FOR INVALIDS. — Cut 
open two fine fresh sweetbreads, and lay them in 
warm water till all the blood is discharged. Then 
transfer them to a pan of cold water to blanch or 
whiten. Stew them in the strained liquid of fresh 
oysters, till quite tender. When done, take out 
the <!weetbreads, remove the gristle or pipe, and 
serve them up warm, having laid in the bottom 
of the dish a slice of nice toast that has been 
dipped for a minute in hot water. If permitted, 
the oysters may be cooked with the sweetbread, 
^rs*i removing the hard part.

STEWED SMELTS.— Smelts are considered a 
delicate and nutritious fish for invalids. They are 
*n season in winter, and earl}'' in the spring. Choose 
them as large as you can find them. Having drawn 
and cleaned them, cut off their heads and tails- 
Put sufficient water to cover them in a small stew- 
pan, adding a very little powdered white sugar, and 
a few small sprigs of parsley, or sweet marjoram 
When the water boils lay in the fish, and simmei 
them five minutes. Then stir in a very litth 
arrow root, mixed with a few drops of cold water 
and let it stew ten minutes longer. Serve up th? 
stew in a small deep dish with a cover, and ea/ 
with it some very light bread-roll. It will be t 
pleasat'?t change from the usual broths and iniu 
Fions prepared for the sick. 

A Molasses Supper, — Make a thick slice of very 
nice toast, evenly browned on both sides, but not 
the least burn^. Lay it in a pint bowl, and pour 
over it a small half pint of the best West India 
molasses, having stirred into "the molass'^s a helped 
table-spoonful of ground ginger. Mix the mo- 
lasses with half a pint of hot water, and pour the 
whole over the toast. Cover it with a plate fjr a 
few minutes, and eat it while warm, previous to 
going to bed. This is a wholesome strengthening 
palatable supper for an invalid, (as we know by 
experience) and may be continued as long as ♦,he 
patient continues to like it. It is always a good 
winter supper for children. The ginger musi on 
no account be omitted. If the molasses has tu>^ed 
% little sour, stir in a salt-spoonful of soda. 



MISS Leslie's kew cook book. 595 

To prevent a jug of molasses from running 
over wben kept in a \7arm place, pour out a little 
into another vessel, and leave the molasses jug un 
corked for two days. Then cork it tightly. 



MISCELLAN1S0US RECEIPTS. 

^ TEA. — ^No metal (not even silver,) is good for 
tea-pots. All tea should be made in china or 
queensware. Wedgewood (whether black or white) 
imbibes much of the essence of the tea, and from 
constant use soon becomes unpleasant. Britannia 
ware is exceedingly unwholesome for any sort of 
cooking, as one fourth of the composition is crpper. 
Block tin for a common tea-pot is less c jjection- 
able, and much cheaper. All cea-pots should, 
after using, be thoroughly emptied of the old 
leaves, and washed very clean in warm water, and 
set open in the sun and air for several hours. To 
make good tea, the tea itself, whether black or 
green, must be of excellent quality. There is no 
economy in buying that which is low-priced. 
Green tea, if fresh and good, and not adulte- 
rated will look green in the cup, and have a fra- 
grant odor. Jf it draws red, or brown, or black- 
ish, it is old or mixed with something wrong. 
Begin to make your tea about a quarter of an 
hour before it is wanted. Scald tbe tea-pot (twice 
over) with boiling water. Then put in the tea . 
allowing three heaping table-spoonfuls to eacb

person, and a pint of water, actually boiling, when 
put in. Cover it closely with the lid, and set it 
by the fire for ten or fifteen minutes to infuse. 
After the first cups have gone round, put some 
fresh tea into the pot, and pour on it some more 
boiling water, that the second cups may be as 
strong as the first, having time to infuse. Weak 
tea for company is very mean. For those that 
like it so, have a small pot of water on the server. 
If the water is not boiling fast when poured on 
the tea, and is beginning to cool, the tea will be 
fiat and insipid, and the leaves will float on the 
surface of the cups. There is then no remedy but 
to m.ake some fresh. 



COFl .^^E. — To drink coffee in perfection, a 
f ufficient quantity for breakfast should be roasted 
every morning, and ground hot, as it loses much 
of its strength by keeping even for a few hours. 
The best coffee roasters are iron cylinders, (stand- 
ing on feet) with a door in one side, and a handle 
that turns the cylinder round towards the fire or 
from it, that the coffee may be equally done 
throughout. It must be roasted a bright brown 
color, and on no account black or burnt. When 
about half done, put in bits of fresh butter, allow- 
ing a tabl-e- spoonful to a pound of coffee. Pre- 
vious to roasting pick the coffee carefully, throw- 
ing away the defective grains, and the stones or 
sand. Coffee should be ground while warm in a 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 697 

fill 11 kept solely for that purpose, and fastened up 
against the kitchen wall. 

For boiled coffee allow four ounces of ground 
coffee (or a quarter of a pound) to a quart of 
water. When the water boils, stir in the coffee. 
Give it one hard boil up. Then set it farther 
fiom the fire, and simmer it for ten minutes, add- 
ing the white of an egg, (including the egg shell,) or 
a small strip of isinglass. Pour out a large cup of 
the coffee, and then (holding it high above the 
coffee-pot,) pour it back again. Kepeat this till 
wanted, and then set the coffee-pot beside l«he fire, 
(but not over it.) For company, allow siz ounce.s 
of coffee to a quart of water. Keep the lid always 
on, but if when boiling hard it rises and seems 
inclined to run over, remove it instantly from the 
fire and set it back. Cream is indispensable to 
first-rate coffee ; if not to be obtained sweet, sub 
stitule rich milk boiling hot. On no considera- 
tion fill up the coffee-pot with water. A perco 
later (to be had at the best tin stores) makes 
excellent coffee without boiling, if properly ma- 
naged. 



CnOCOLATE. — There is no plain chocolate 
oetter than Baker's prepared cacao, and none has 
80 much of the true chocolate flavor. The foreign 
chocolate is generally mixed with sugar, spice, and 
milk. It cannot be made thick and strong, and 
therefore to many tastes is not agreeable. To 
make a pint (or two large cupfuls of chocolate,) 
rtcrape down two ounces on a plate, and nxjist^r 



59S MISS t.esltk's new coo^ book. 

^he chocolate with a jill of water, rubbing it on 
ihe plate till quite smooth. Then boil it five mi- 
nutes, and aad a small pint of water. When it 
has been well stirred with a wooden spoon, and 
has come ag-'iin to a boil, serve it as hot as possi 
ble, accompanied by a saucer of fine loaf sugar, 
and a small jug of rich hot cream and a plate of 
nice dry toast, or somf. milk biscuits gt sponge 
cake. Milled chocolate k made with rich un- 
skimmed milk instead of w.^ter. The chocolate 
mill is a deep pot, belonging to which is a stick 
with a broad wheel- shaped bot-tom, the other end 
coming up through a hole in the lid. Take this 
between your hands, and turn it round fast 
till the chocolate is finely frothed. Then transfer 
it to large cups. Chocolate, after it becomes cold, 
is unfit to drink. But if made with milk, you can 
convert what is left into a custard or pudding, 
with the addition of more sugar and some beaten 
egg. The low-priced chocolate is both unpalat- 
ftble and unwholesome, being adulterated with 
animal fat or lard, and made with old cacao beans.

MILK TOAST.— To a pint of nice rich milk 
allow a quarter of a pound of -ixcoilent /res\ but- 
ter. Boil the milk, and as soon as it boils take it 
off, and stir in the butter cut into pieces. When 
the butter has melted, give it another boil up

it covered till it goes to the breakfast table. Send 
a spoon with it. Bread should always be toasted 
by a long-handled fork, such as are made for the 
purpose. They cost but twenty-five cents, and 
no kitchen should be without one. 



'•"^^N/^^i^^ ^^l^ 



BUTTERED TOAST. — Cut even slices of 
bread all of the same thickness, and pare off the 
whole of the crust. With a long-handled toasting 
fork toast it evenly on both sides, taking care 
that no part of it is burnt or blackened. Butter 
the slices hot, as you take them off the fork, 
(using none but nice fresh butter) and lay them^ 
evenly on a heated plate. Cover them till they 
go to table. 

All toast prepared for cookery, (to lay in the 
bottom of dishes,) should have the crust pared oflEJ 
and be dipped in hot water after toasting.

RASPBERRY YINEGAR.— Take a gallon of 
line ripe raspberries. Put them into a large deep 
earthen pan, and mash them well with a wooden 
beetle." Then pour them with all their juice into a 
large and very clean linen bag, and squeeze and 
press out their liquid into a vessel beneath. Mea- 
sure it, and to each pint of juice allow half a pint 
of the best and clearest cider vinegar, and half a 
pound of fine loaf sugar, powdered. First mix 
the juice and the vinegar, and give them a boil in 

a porcelain kettle. Th^n stir in the sugar, gra-

dually, adding to every two pounds of sugar a 
beaten white of egg. Boil and skim till the scum 
ceases to rise. When it is done, bottle it cold 
cork it tightly, and seal the corks. To use it, 
pour out half a tumbler of raspberry vinegar, and 
fill up with ice water. It is a pleasant and cool- 
ing beverage in warm weather, and for invalids 
who are feverish. Mixed with hot water, and 
taken at bed-time, it is good for a cold. 

Strawberry Vinegar — Is made in the above man- 
ner, carefully hulling them. The strawberries 
must be of the finest kind, and fully ripe. These 
vinegars are made with much less trouble than 
the usual way ; and are quite as good, if not better. 



''^^■«^</'#^^N>v»" 



MACABONI. — In buying macaroni, choose 
that of a large pipe; see that it is clean an J white 
and that it has not been touched by insects. Half 
a pound makes one dish. If soaked befoie boil- 
ing it is apt to dissolve or go to pieces, bv K wash 
and drain it through cold water in a sieve. Have 
over the fire a large pan of boiling water, in which 
has been melted a piece of fresh butter the size 
of an egg. If boiled steadily, it will b^ quite 
tender in less than an hour ; but do not boil it so 
long that the pipes break up and lose their shape. 
Having drained it well through a cleat* sieve, 
transfer it to a deep dish, dividing it into fouir 
layers, having first cut it into even lengths of two 
or three inches. Between the layers place on it 
seasoning of grated cheese of the very beat qua- 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 6l"l 

lity, and bits of fresh butter, with some powdered 
mace. On the top layer, add to the covering of 
cheese and butter sufficient bread-crumbs to form 
a sh'ght crust all over the surface. Brown it with 
a salamander or a red hot shovel. Or (omitting 
the cheese) you may dress^it with rich gravy of 
roast meat. 

For Sweet Macaroni. — Having boiled it in milk 
instead of water, drain it, and mix with it pow- 
dered mace and nutmeg, with butter, sugar, and 
rose or peach-water. Macaroni (like vermicelli) 
has in itself no taste, but is only made palatable 
by the manner of dressing it. Good soup is rather 
weakened than improved by the addition of mac- 
aroni. 

COMMON OMELET. — Beat five eggs till 
very light and thick. Stir gradually into the pan 
of eggs four table-spoonfuls of sifted flour. Thin 
the batter with a large tea-cup of milk. Take a 
yeast powder; dissolve the soda (from the blue 
paper) in a small quantity of tepid or lukewarm 
water, and stir it into the batter. In another cup 
melt the tartaric acid, (from the white paper;) stir 
that into the mixture, and stir the whole very 
hard. Have ready in a frying-pan a large portion 
of lard, boiling hot. Put in the omelet mixturCj 
ani fry it well. When one side is done turn it, and 
fry the other. To flavor this omelet, mix gradu- 
ally into the batter either grated ham or smoked 
tongue, minced oysters; minced onion; mixed

i\ntli sweet majoram, or else some mushrooms 
chopped very fine. 

For a Sweet Omelet^ add to the above batter 
powdered sugar, nutmeg, mace, and powdered cin- 
namon. 

The custom is now to dish omelets without 
folding them over it being found that folding 
renders them heavy. Spread them out at full length 
on a very hot dish. The batter for omelets should 
always be made in sufficient quantity to allow 
them very thick. 

There is no use in attempting to flavor an ome- 
let, or any thing else, with marmalade or lemon, 
if you put in soda. The alkalies destroy the 
taste of every sort of fruit.

A PLAIN POTATO PUDDINa.— Having 
pared a pound of fine large potatos, put them into 
a pot, cover them well with cold water, and boil 
them gently till tender all through. When done, 
lay each potato (one at a time,) in a clean warm 
napkin, and press and wring it till all the moisture 
is squeezed out, and the potato becomes a round, 
dry lump. Mince as fine as possible a quarter of 
a pound of fresh beef suet, (divested of skin and 
strings.) Crumble the potato, and mix it well 
with the suet, adding a small salt-spoon of salt. 
Add sufficient milk to make a thick batter, and 
beat it well. Dip a strong square cloth in hot 
water, shake it out, and dredge it well with flour.

ELLEN CLARK'S PUDDING.— Slice, rather 
thick, some fresh bread. Pare off all the crust. 
Butter the bread on both side?, and lay it in a 
deep dish. Fill up with molasses very profusely, 
having first seasoned the molasses with ginger, 
ground cinnamon, and powdered mace or nutmeg. 
It will be much improved by adding the grated 
yellow rind and the juice of a large lemon or 
orange. Bake it till brown all over the top, and 
till the bread and butter has absorbed the mo- 
lasses ; taking care not to let it burn. 



»*^^#^^</S»^^»«*« " 



AKROW-ROOT BISCUIT. — Mix in a pan 
half a pint of arrow- root, and half a pint of 
sifted wheat flour. Cut up a quarter of a pound 
of fresh butter, and rub it into the pan of flour, 
crumbling the bits of butter so small as to be 
scarcely visible. Mix a quarter of a pound of 
powdered white sugar, and wet it with a beaten 
egg. Add gradually a very little cream, just 
enough to make it into a stiff dough. Flavor it 
with the grated yellow rind and juice of a lemon, 
and half a nutmeg grated. Roll out the dough 
into thin sheets, and cut it out into biscuits with 
the edge of a tumbler. Prick every biscuit all 
OTer with a fork. Lay them in square pans 



604 MISS Leslie's new cook book 

slightly floured, and bake them immediately. 
They will be improved by adding (at the last of 
the mixture) a table- spoonful of the best rose- 
water. If rose-water is put into cakes early in the 
mixing, much of its strength will evaporate before 
baking. It should always be deferred to the last. 
These are very nice tea biscuits.

ONTARIO CAKE.— Take a pint and a half 
(or three large breakfast cups,) of sifted flour, and 
the same quantity of powdered white sugar, and 
half a pint of milk ; a quarter of a pint or half a 
cup of the best fiesh butter, and the grated yellow 
rind and juice of a large lemon. Have ready 
four well-beaten eggs, and two table-spoonfuls of 
strong fresh yeast. 

Cut up the butter into the pan of flour. Add 
the milk and sugar gradually, and then the beaten 
6gg) and then the lemon ; next the yeast. Stir the 
whole very well, and set it to rise in a buttered 
pan. Place it near the fire, and cover it with a 
clean flannel or a double cloth. When it has 
risen and is quite light, and is cracked all over 
the surface, transfer it to a square baking pan, 
put it immediately into the oven, and bake it well. 
When cool, either ice it or sift white sugar over 
it, and cut it into squares. Or, you may bake it 
:n a round loaf, or in small round cakes. 



MISS Leslie's new cook book, 605 

NEW- YEAR'S CAKE.— Stir together a pound 
of nice fresli butter, and a pound of powdered 
white sup^ar, till thev become a liofht thick cream. 
Then stir in, gradually, three pounds of sifted 
flour. Add, by degrees, a tea-spoonful of soda 
dissolved in a small tea- cup of milk, and then a 
half salt-spoonful of tartaric acid, melted in a 
large table-spoonful of warm water. Then mix 
f.n, gradually, three table-spoonfuls of fine carra- 
way seeds. Eoll out the dough into sheets half 
an inch thick, and cut it with a jagging iron into 
oval or oblong cakes, pricked with a fork. Bake 
them immediately in shallow iron pans, slightly 
greased with fresh butter. The bakers in New York 
ornament these cakes, with devices or pictures 
raised by a wooden stamp. They are good plain 
cakes for children.

GOOD YEAST.— Take two handfuls of hops 
The best hops have a fresh light green color, and 
a pleasant, lively smell. Pour on them two quarts 
of boiling water, and let them boil five minutes 
after they have come to a boil ; not longer, for it 
makes them bitter. Then strain the liquid into a 
pan, and add a table-spoonful of brown sugar and 
one of salt. When lukewarm, stir in flour enough 
to make a thick batter. Add a jill and a half of 
flesh baker's yeast. Set it in a warm place till it 
begins to ferment; then keep it iu the cellar well 
corked., 

This yeast v/ill continue good two weeks. When 



606 MTSS r<SSLTK*S NEW COOK BOOK. 

you open the jug to take out some yeast, put in 
always a table-spoonful of flour before you cork 
It up again. 

A stone jug or pitcher is a good vessel for 
yeast. Wash it very clean in hot water, always 
before you put in fresh yeast, and then rinse the 
jug with water in which a spoonful of pearlash 
has been melted, letting the pearlash water remain 
in it five or six minutes, and shaking it round 
hard. Then rinse it with plain cold water. 

All vessels that have contained acids should 
have pearlash or soda in the rinsing water, and 
then be finished with plain water. 

Never clean a bottle by rinsing it with shot. 
The lead is poisonous, and has caused death. 
Some bits of raw poi-ato chopped, and put in the 
water, will clean the inside of bottles or jugs, 
and brighten decanters. 



^^^^^S^^'^I^^.^^VTMl 



YEAST POWDERS.— Get two ounces of bi- 
carbonate of soda, and one ounce of tartaric acid. 
Divide the soda into equal portions, about a level 
tea-spoonful in each, and the tartaric acid into 
level salt-spoonfuls. By level we mean that the 
article is not to be heaped in the least, not rising 
above the edge of the spoon. Cut some papc rs 
of regular and sufficient size, and fold them nicely. 
Put the soda into white papers, and the tartaric 
acid into blue papers. Place an equal number of 
each in a little square or oblong box, standing up 
tl^e capers on their folded edges. Dissolve them 



MISS lksme's new cook book. 607 

in two separate cups, in as much tepid water as wiD 
cover the powder. Thej must be entirely melle(? 
before using. Stir in the soda at the beginning, 
and the tartaric acid at the conclusion of the 
batter or cake mixture. 

We do not approve of the introduction of these 
substances into cakes. They give a sort of fac- 
titious lightness very different from that honestly 
produced by a liberal allowance of egg and butter, 
genuine yeast, and good beating and stirring — ■ 
but they destroy the taste of the seasoning, and 
are certain destruction to the taste of lemon, 
orange, strawberry, pine-apple, and every kind of 
fruit flavoring. The justly celebrated Mrs. Good- 
fellow never used any of them in her school, and 
the articles made there by her pupils, (of whom 
the author was one) were such as no money can 
purchase in the present times. Any confectionei 
who would faithfully revive them could make a 
fortune by doing so. 

The present introduction of hartshorn into 
bread and cakes is an abomination, rendering the 
articles equally unpalatable and unwholesome. 
Cannot the use of hartshorn in food be put down? 
Which of our American doctors will write a book 
on " culinary poisons."

VINEGAR. — Mix together in a clean keg three

pint of baker's yeast. Cover it, and set it in a 
warm place where it will be exposed to the sum- 
mer sun. Remember to shake the cask every day. 
In three months it will be excellent vinegar. Then 
transfer it to stonei jugs, and keep it closely 
corked. Begin it in May. 

So much of the vinegar sold in stores is con- 
cocted of pernicious drugs, that we recommend all 
families to make their own, or to buy it from a 
cider farmer. Good cider, set in the sun, will 
after a while become good vinegar. 

What is shamefully called the best white wine 
vinegar is frequently a slow poison, as may be 
known by its action upon oysters, pickles, &c. 
It is quite clear and well to look at. Its taste is 
very sharp and pungent, as to overpower and 
render every thing that is with it painfully sour, 
and it has a singular and disagreeable smell when 
boiling. Oysters cooked with this vinegar go im- 
mediately into rags, and are soon entirely eaten 
up, or dissolved into a thin whitish liquid, fit for 
nothing but to throw away. 

Pickles the same. A punishment should be 
provided by law for persons who manufacture 
and sell these deleterious compounds, of which we 
ha\= now so many, that it would indeed be well 
if we could make at home, as far as possible, every 
thing we eat and drink.

PINK CHAMPAGNE— (i)om€sieb.)-~Pick from 
the stems three quarts of fine ripe red currants, 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 6G9 

and mix with them three quarts of rine white 
currants. Bruise them all. Put nine pounds of 
loaf sugar to melt in three gallons of very clear 
Boft water. Boil the water and sugar together tor 
half an hour, skimming carefully, and pour tlie 
liquid boiling hot over the currants. When it is 
nearly cold, add a small tea-cupful of excellent 
strong fresh yeast. Let it ferment for two days, 
and then strain it into a small cask through a very 
clean hair sieve. Put into the cask half an ounce 
of finely-chipped isinglass. Have rather more 
liquor than will fill the cask at first, and keep it 
to fill up as it works over. In about a fortnight 
bung it up. Let it remain in the cask till April. 
Then transfer it to bottles, (putting into each a 
lump of double-refined loaf sugar,) and letting 
them remain one day uncorked. Then cork and 
wire them. They must stand upright in the 
cellar ; but when likely to be wanted, lay a few 
of them on their sides for a week. 



SHERRY COBBLER.— Lay in the bottom of 
a large tumbler, two table-spoonfuls of powdered 
loaf sugar, and squeeze over it (through a strainer) 
the juice of a large lemon that has been softened 
by rolling under your hand. Then half fill the 
tumbler with ice, broken very small. Add a large 
glass of very good sherry wine. Take another 
tumbler, and pour the liquid back and forward 
from glass to glass, till completely mixed without

stirring. Sip it through a clean straw, or one of 
the tubes made on purpose. 



»**^A#^^l/^*^v^^'~>« 



MINT JULEP.— Cut two or three round slices 
from a fine ripe pine-apple that has been pared ; 
and take out the core or hard part from the 
centre of each slice. A still better way is to 
split down the pine-apple into four pieces, and 
grate two of the quarters with a coarse grater, 
standing it upright while doing so. Put it into 
a large tumbler, and cover the fruit with two or 
three heaped table-spoonfuls of powdered loaf 
sugar. Add a large glass of the best brandy, and 
pour on cold water till the tumbler is two-thirds 
full. Then put in a thick layer of finely broken 
ice, till it almost reaches the top. Finish by 
sticking in a full bunch of fresh green mint in 
handsome sprigs, that rise far above one side of 
the tumbler ; and at the other side place a clean 
straw, or one of the tubes used for the same 
purpose. 



CAROLINA PUNCH.— Mix together a turn- 
bier of peach brandy and a tumbler of water, 
the juice of two lemons, the yellow rinds of four, 
pared to transparent thinness, and four large 
juicy free-stone peaches cut in half, and the ker- 
nels of their stones blanched and broken up. If 
you cannot obtain peaches, quarter and grate 
iown a ripe pine-apple. Let all these ingredients 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 611 

infuse with a quart of Jamaica spirits in a bowl 
for two daj3 before the punch is wanted. Keep 
it carefully covered with a cloth. Then pour on 
sufficient cold water to make the punch of the 
desired strength ; and strain the liquid into ano- 
ther bowl, and put in a large lump of ice. Serve 
it out in small glasses. 



»*rfN/\/^'^V^^*Vl/'»~. 



NECTAR — Take two pounds of the best raisins, 
seeded and chopped ; the grated yellow rind and 
the juice of four fine lemons, and two pounds of 
loaf sugar, powdered. Put the sugar into a large 
porcelain kettle, and melt it in a gallon of water. 
Boil and skim it for half an hour, and while it is 
boiling hard, put in by degrees the raisins and 
lemons. Continue the boiling about ten minutes. 
Put the mixture into a stoneware crock, and 
cover it closely. Let it stand three days, stirring 
it down to the bottom twice every day. Then 
strain it through a linen bag, and bottle it, seal- 
ing the corks. It will be fit for use in a fort- 
night. Take it in wine-glasses, with a bit of ice 
in each. This is a nice temperance drink. 



CHOCOLATE CARAMEL.— Take half a pint 
of rich milk, and put it to boil in a porcelain 
kettle ; scrape down a square and a half of Ba- 
ker's chocolate, put it into a very clean tin cup, 
and set on the top of a stove till it becomes soft. 
Let the milk boil up twice. Then add, gradually.

fe cbooclate, and stir both over the fire till tho- 
TQ'zpi'lj mhied and free from lumps. Stir in a half 
pint of the best white sugar pcwdarcd, and half a 
jiii (or four large table-spoonfuls,) of molasses. 
Let the Tfthole boil fast and constantly (so as to 
bubble,) for at least one hour or more, till it is 
nearly as stiff as good mush. When all is done 
add a small tea-spoonful of essence of vanilla, and 
transfer the mixture to shallow tin pans, slightly 
greased with very nice sweet oil. Set it on ice, 
or in a very cool place, and while yet soft mark 
it deeply in squares with a very sharp knife. 
When quite hard, cut the squares apart. If it does 
not harden well it has not been boiled long 
enough, or fast enough.

EGGS TO BOIL.— The water must be boiling 
fast when the eggs are put in. First wipe thera 
clean all over, with a wet cloth. It is true that 
the shells are never eaten, but still, if brought to 
table dirty and discolored, they look slovenly, 
disgusting, and vulgar, such as are never seen in 
good houses. Put them into water that is boil- 
ing fast; and if desired very soft, four minutea 
will be sufficient. Six or eight minutes will 
barely set the whites and yolks, and ten or twelve 
minutes (in water that is really boiling,) will 
render them hard enough for salad. In the egg- 
boilers that are set on the table no egg will ever 
boil hard, as the water cools too soou. A stale 
egg never boils hard. 



MISS Leslie's new cook book. 613 

Except in the spring, and late in the winter, 
there is often much difficulty in obtaining good 
eggs, unless you have fowls of your own. If an egg 
is really fresh, when held up against the light, the 
yolk looks round and compact and the wliite clear 
and transparent ; you may then trust it. But if the 
yolk is thick, broken, and mixed among the white, 
and the white is cloudy and muddled, it is cer- 
tainly bad, and should be thrown away. When 
tried in a pan of cold water the freshest will sink, 
and the stale ones float on the surface. It requires 
strong brine to bear up a good egg. Eggs may 
be preserved for keeping a few months, by put- 
ting every one in fast boiling water for one minute. 
Then grease thera all over the outside with good 
melted fat, and wedge down close together (layer 
above layer,) in a box of powdered charcoal. 
This preserves them for a sea voyage of several 
weeks. The charcoal box must be kept closely 
covered, and closed immediately whenever opened. 
Pack the eggs with the small end downwards. 



**^A#^^^^#\AA*'»»~- 



POACHED EGGS. — See that the eggs are 
quite fresh. Pour from a kettle of boiling water 
enough to fill a broad shallow stew-pan. Break 
the eggs into a saucer, (one at a time,) slip them 
carefully into the hot water, and let them stand in 
it till the whites are set. Then put the pan over 
a moderate fire; and, as soon as the water boils 
again, the eggs are ready. The whites should be 
firm, and the yolks should appear in the centre 



Gi4 . MISS Leslie's new cook book, 

looking yellow through a thin transparent oouling 
of the white. Take them out carefully (one bv 
one,) with an egg-slice. Have ready, for each 
egg, a nice slice of toast of a light brown or yel- 
low all over. Trim olF all the crust, an-d dip the 
toast for a minute in hot water. Then butter it 
slightly with fresh butter. Trim off neatly the 
ragged and discolored white from the edge of 
each Qgg, Lay a poached Qgg in the middle of 
every toast, and serve them up warm. 

Instead of toast, you may lay beneath every 
Qgg a thin slice of ham, that has been soaked, and 
nicely broiled and trimmed. Or, large thin slices 
from the breast of a cold roast turkey, or cold 
fillet of roast pork or veal. These are nice break 
fast dishes. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Make a mixture as for an 
omelet, but instead of frying put it into a sauce- 
pan, and when it has boiled five minutes take it 
off, and chop and mix all the ingredients into 
confusion. Serve it up hot in a deep dish. It is 
eaten at breakfast, and is by many preferred to a 
fried omelet. You may season it with grated 
ham, tongue, or sweet herbs. 



*<VVA*^'^#*\/S^rf^»~ 



EGG-NOGG.— Beat, till very light and thick, 
•'.he yolks only of six eggs. Stir the eggs, gradu 
ally, into a quart of rich unskimmed milk, and 
add half a pound of powdered loaf sugar, a half 
^int of brandy, and a grated nutmeg. Next beat 
kiiree whites of the eggs by themselves, and stii

them quickly into the mixture. Divide it into two 
pitchers, and pour it back and forward from one 
pitcher to the other till it has a fine froth. Then 
serve it in a large china bowl, with a silver ladle 
in it, and distribute it in glasses with handles. 

To Beat Eggs. — For beating eggs have a broad 
shallow earthen pan. If beaten in tin, the cold- 
ness of the metal retards their lightness ; for the 
same reason, hickory rods are better than tin wire. 
Beat with a short quick stroke, holding the egg 
rods in your right hand close to your side, and 
do not exert your elbow, or use your arm vio- 
lently with a hard sweeping stroke ; of this there 
is no necessity. If beaten in a proper manner, 
(moving your hand only at the wrist) the eggs 
will be light long before you are fatigued. But 
you must continue beating till after the froth has 
subsided, and the pan of eggs presents a smooth 
thick surface, like a nice boiled custard. White 
of Ggg is done if it stands stiff alone, and will not 
fall from the beater when held upon it. 

Butter and sugar should always be stirred with 
a strong hickory spaddle, which resembles a short 
mush stick, rather broad and flattened at one end,

BRAN MUFFINS.— Take three quarts of bran, 
(unbolted wheat flour) and sift it into a large pan.

ler, and stir it about till v/'ell mixed all tlirough, 
Then stir all the liquid into the flour. Beat in a 
shallow pan three eggs till very thick and light, 
and then stir them gradually into the pan of 
flour, &c. Lastly, add tv/o table-spoonfuls of 
strong fresh yeast. Cover the mixture and set it 
tc rise. When risen very light heat a griddle oa 
the oven of a stove, set muffin rings upon it, fill 
the rings nearly to the top, and bake the muffins. 
Send them to table hot, pull them open with your 
fingers, and butter them. They will be much liked 
if properly made and baked.

COTTAGE CHEESE.— This is a good way of 
using up a pan of milk that is found to be turn- 
ing sour. Or you may turn it, on purpose, by 
stirring in a spoonful of cider vinegar. Having 
covered it, set it in a warm place till it becomes a 
curd. Then pour off the liquid, and tie up the 
curd in a clean linen bag with a pointed end, and 
set a bowl under it to catch the drcppings; but do 
not squeeze it. After it has drained ten or twelve 
hours, transfer the curd to a deep dish, enrich it 
with some cream, and press and chop it with a 
large spoon till it is a soft masn ; adding, as you 
proceed, an ounce or more of nice fresh butter. 
Then set it on ice till tea-time.

FRENCH HAM PIE.— Having soaked, boUed, 
tsd skinned a small ham of the bost quality, and 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK JBOOK. 617 

taken ont the bone, trim it into a handsome oval 
shape. Of the trimmings make a rich gravy by 
stewing them in a sauce-pan with a little water 
and four pigs feet, (split up.) Have ready a plen 
tiful sufficiency of nice forcemeat made of cold 
roast chicken or veal, minced suet, and grated 
bread-crumbs, butter, minced sweet marjoram or 
tarragon, and some hard-boiled yolk of egg crum- 
bled. Have ready, prepared, a very nice puff 
paste; line with it the bottom and sides of a large 
deep dish, and lay in it the oval ham, filling up at 
the corners and all round with the forcemeat, and 
spreading a layerof it on the top. Pour on gravy 
to moisten the whole, and put on the paste in- 
tended for the lid. Kotch the edges handsomely, 
and stick a flower or tulip of paste in the cross 
slit at the top, and place a wreath of paste leaves 
all round. Bake it light brown, and eat it warm 
or cold. It is a fine dish for a dinner or supper 
party, or for a handsome luncheon or breakfast. 

A Tongue Pie — Is made in a similar manner of 
a boiled smoked tongue, peeled and trimmed, and 
filled in with forcemeat. For a large company 
have tivo .j^ngne pies, as it will be much liked, if 
inade as above. 



FIG PUDDING.— Take a pint of very ripe figs, 
(peeled,) out them up and mash them smooth with 
the grated yellow rind of a large ripe lemon or 
orange, and the juice of two. Mix together a largo 
■poorful of fresh butter, and two table*spoonful5

of sugar, and stir the whole very hard. Bake it in 
a deep dish, and eat it fresh, but not warm. Grate 
sugar over the surface. When ripe figs can be 
obtained, this pudding is much liked. 



POKE PLANT. — Early in the spring, tbe 
young green stalks of the pokeberry plant, (when 
they are still mild and tender, and have not yet 
acquired a reddish tinge or a strong unpleasant 
taste,) are generally much liked as a vegetable, 
and are by many persons considered equal to as- 
paragus. They are brought in bundles to Phi- 
ladelphia market. Wash and drain them, and 
put them on to boil in a pot of cold water. When 
quite tender all through they are done. Dish them 
in the manner of asparagus, laid on a toast dipped 
for a minute in hot water, and then buttered. 

You may pour a very little drawn or melted 
butter over the poke. 



-•M*#N^^#'^^#^**'~> 



RHUBARB TARTS.— Take large fresh stalks 
of the rapontica plant, such as are full-grown and 
reddish. Peel off the thin skin, and cut them 
into bits all of the same size, either one inch or two 
inches long. Wash them in cold water through a 
cullender, (but do not drain them much,) and put 
them into a stew-pan without nny more water. 
Mix with them plenty of good sugar, in the pro- 
portion of half a pound of sugar to a pint of cut- 
up rhubarb stalks. Cover it, and stew it slowly 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK B(>OK 61h 

till quite soft. Then mash it into a smooth mass. 
Have some puff- paste shells baked empty; and 
when cool, fill them to the top, and grate nutmeg 
and powdered sugar thickly over them. The juice 
and grated yellow rind of a lemon (added when 
the rhubarb is half stewed,) will be a pleasant 
flavoring. This is sometimes called "spring-fruit'' 
and *' pie-plant." It comes earlier, but is by nc 
means so good as gooseberries. We do not think 
it worth preserving, or making into a sweetmeat. 



<VS/S^^'^<^^^WM> 



VOL- AU-YENT. — Have ready a large quan- 
tity of the best and lightest puff paste. Eoll it 
an inch thick, and then cut it neatly into shapes, 
either square or circular. Bake every one sepa 
rately on a flat tin pan, cutting a round hole in 
the centre of each, and fitting in pieces of stale 
bread to keep the holes open while baking. The 
cakes of paste should diminish in size as they 
ascend to the top, but the holes should all be of 
exactly the same dimensions. The lower cake, 
which goes at the bottom, should be solid and not 
perforated at all. The small cake which finishes 
the top of the pyramid must also be left solid, 
for a lid. When all the cakes are baked and 
risen high, (as good puff- paste always does) take 
them carefully off the baking plates ; remove the 
bread that has kept the centres open and in shape; 
brush over every cake, separately, with beaten 
white of egg, and pile one upon another nioely and 
evenly so as to form a pyramid. Have ready »

very nice stew of oysters or game cut small, and 
cooked with cream, &c. Fill the pyramid with 
this, and then put on the top or lid, which may 
terminate in a flower of baked paste. 

A Sweet Vol -au- Vent — May be filled with 
small preserves, or with ripe strawberries or rasp- 
berries, made very sweet. Vol- au- vents are for 
dinner, or supper parties. The paste should be 
peculiarly light. The name Vol-au-vent signifies^ 
in French, something that will fly away in the 
wind ; which, however, it never does. 



A SOUFFLfi PUDDING.— Take eight rusks, 
or soft sugar-biscuits, or plain buns. Lay them 
in a large deep dish, and pour on a pint of milk, 
sufficient to soak them thoroughly. Cover the 
dish, and let them stand undisturbed for about an 
hour and a half before dinner. In the mean time, 
boil half a pint of milk in a small sauce- pan with 
a handful of bitter almonds or peach kernels 
broken small, or a small bunch of fresh peach* 
leaves, with two large sticks of cinnamon, broken 
up. Boil this milk slowly, (keeping it covered,) 
and when it tastes strongly of the flavoring arti- 
ticles, strain it, and set it away to cooL When 
cold, mix it into another pint of milk, and stir in 
a quarter of a pound of powdered loaf sugar. 
Beat eight eggs very light, and add them gradu* 
ally to the milk, so as to make a rich custard 
After dinner has commenced, beat and stir the 
aoaked rusk very had till it becomes a smooth muss. 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 621 

and tlien, by degrees, add to it the custard. Stir 
the whole till thoroughly amalgamated. Set the 
dish into a brisk oven, and bake the pudding 
rather more than ten minutes. The yeast, &c., iu 
the rusk, will cause it to puff up very light. 
When done> send it to table warm, with white 
sugar sifted over it. You may serve up with it 
as sauce sweetened thick cream flavored with rose* 
water, and grated nutmeg, or powdered loaf sugar 
and fresh butter stirred together in equa,l por- 
tions, and seasoned with lemon or nutmeg.

ICED PLUM PUDDING. — Take two dozen 
sweet and half a dozen bitter almonds. Blanch 
them in scalding water, and then throw them into 
a bowl of cold water. Pound them one at a time 
in a mortar, till they become a smooth paste, tree 
from the smallest lumps. As you proceed, add 
frequently a few drops of rose-water or lemor 
juice to make them light, and prevent their oil- 
ing. Seed and cut in half a quarter of a pound 
of the best bloom raisins. Mix with them a 
quarter of a pound of Zante currants, picked, 
washed, and dried ; and add to the raisins and 
currants three ounces of citron, chopped. Mix 
the citron with the raisins and currants, and dredge 
them all with flour to prevent their sinking or 
clodding. Take a half pint of very rich milk; 
sj^.it a vanilla bean, and cut it into pieces two or 
three ioche.-^ long, J^i^d boil it in the milk till the

it out, and mix thevanilla milk with a pint of 
rich cream, and stir in, gradually, a half pound of 
powdered loaf sugar, and a nutmeg grated. Then 
add the pounded almonds, ana a large wine glass 
of either marasquino, noyau, curagoa, or tbe very 
best brandy. Beat, in a shallow pan, tho yolka 
of eight eggs till very light, thick, and smooth, 
and stir them gradually into the mixture. Sim- 
mer it over the fire, (stirring it all the time,) but 
take it off just as it is about to come to a boil, 
otherwise it will curdle. Then, while the mil ture 
is hot, stir in the raisins, currants, and citron. Set 
it to cool, and then add a large tea-cupful of pre- 
served strawberries or raspberries, half a dozen 
preserved apricots or peaches ; half a dozen pre- 
served green limes; and any other very nice and 
delicate sweetmeats. Then whip to a stiff froth 
another pint of cream, and add it lightly to the 
mixture. Put the whole into a large melon-mould 
that opens in the middle, and freeze it in the usual 
way. It will taKe four hours to freeze it well. 
Do not turn it out till just before it is wanted- 
Then send it to table on a glass dish. It will be 
found delicious. Iced puddings are now consi- 
dered indispensable on fashionable supper tables 
or at dinner parties. There is no Hour in this 
pudding. The freezing will keep it together.

RENNETS.— Milk turned into a curd witb 
wine is by no means so good as that which ia 
done with rennet- water alone. The curd aad 



MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 623 

whey do not separate so completely ; tLe curd ia 
less firm, and the whey less clear ; the latter be- 
ing thick and white, instead of thin and greenish, 
as it ought to be. Neither is it so light and 
wholesome as when turned with rennet. 

Kennets of the best quality can be had at all 
seasons in the Philadelphia market ; particularly 
in the lower part, called the Jersey market. They 
are sold at twelve, eighteen, or twenty-five cents, 
according to their size, and will keep a year or 
two; but have most strength when fresh. You 
may prepare excellent rennets youi'self at a very 
trifling expense, by previously bespeaking them 
of a veal butcher , a rennet being the stomach of 
a calf. Its form is a bag. As soon as you get 
the rennet, empty out all its contents, and wipe it 
very clean, inside and out; then rince it with cold 
water, but do not wash it much, as washing will 
weaken its power of turning milk into curd. When 
you have made it quite clean, lay the rennet in a 
broad pan, strew it over on both sides with plenty 
of fine salt; cover it, and let it rest five days. 
"When you take it out of the pan, do not wipe or 
wash it, for it must be stretched and dried with the 
salt on. For this purpose hold it open like a bag, 
and slip within it a long, thick, smooth rod, bent 
into the form of a large loop wide at the top, and 
BC narrow at the bottom as to meet together. 
Stretch the rennet tightly and smoothly over this 
bent rod, on which it will be double, and when 
you have brought the two ends of tlie rod to- 
gether at the bottom, and tied them fast, the form 



624 MISS LESLIE'^ NEW COOK BOOK 

will somewhat resemble that of a boy's kite. 
Hiir.g it up in a dry place, and cut out a bit as 
you want it. Apiece about two inches square 
will turn one quart of milk; a piece of four in- 
ches, two quarts. Uaving first washed off all the 
salt in several cold waters, and wiped tlie bit of 
rennet dry, pour on it sufficient lukewarm water 
to cover it well. Let it stand several hours ; then 
pour the rennet- water into the milk you intend 
for the curd, and set it in a warm place. When 
the curd is entirely formed, set the vessel on ice. 
Ecnnet may be used with good effect before it 
has Quile dried.

AN EASY WAY OF MAKING BUTTER 
IN WINTER.— The following will be found an 
excellent method of making butter in cold wea- 
ther for family use. We recommend its trial. 
Take, in the morning, the unskimmed milk of the 
preceding evening, (after it has stood all night in 
a tin pan,) and set it over a furnace of hot coals, 
or in a stove ; being careful not to disturb the 
cream that has risen to the surface. Let it remain 
over the fire till it simmers, and begins to bubble 
round the edges; but on no account let it come to 
a boil. Then take the pan carefully off, (without 
disturbing the cream) and carry it to a cool place, 
but not where it is cold enough to freeze. In the 
evening take a spoon, and loosen the cream round 
ihe sides of the pan. If very rich, it will be 
tilmost a solid cake. Slip off the sheet of cream 



MISa LESLIE'S NEW COOK BOOK. 62^ 

into another and larger pan, letting as little milk 
go with it as possible. Cover it, and set it »waj. 
Eepeat the process for several days, till you have 
thus collected a sufficiency of clotted cream to fiJI 
the pan. Then scald a wooden ladle, and beat 
the cream hard with it during ten minutes. Yoi? 
will then have excellent butter. Take it out of 
tlie pan, lay it on a flat dish, and with the ladle 
squeeze and press it hard, till all the buttermilk 
is entirely extracted and drained off. Then wash 
the butter in cold water, and work a very little 
salt into it. Set it away in a cool place for three 
hours. Then squeeze and press it again ; also 
v/ashing it a second time in cold water. Make it 
up. into pats, and keep it in a cool place. 

The unskimmed morning's milk, of course, may 
also be used for this purpose, after it has stood 
twelve hours. The simmering over the fire adds 
greatly to the quantity of cream, by throwing all 
the oily part of the milk to the surface ; but if 
allowed to boil, this oleaginous matter will again 
descend, and mix with the rest, so as not to be 
separated. 

This is the usual method of making winter 
butter in the south of England; and it is very 
customary in the British provinces of Ameipiea. 
Try it. 

SWEET POTATO PONE.— Stir together liU 
very light and white, three quarters of a pound

of ginger. Gnate a pound and a half of sweel 
potato. Beat eight eggs very light, and stir them 
gradually into the butter and sugar, in turn with 
the grated sweet potato. Dissolve a tea-spoonfu. of 
saleratus or soda in a jill of sour milk, and stir 
it in at the last, beating the whole very hard. 
Butter the inside of a tin pan. Put in the mix- 
ture, and bake it four hours or more. It should 
be eaten fresh, cut into slices.

EICE BKEAD.—To a pint of well boiled rice 
add half a pint of wheat flou?, mixing them well 
together. Take six eggs, and beat the whites and 
yolks separately. Having beaten the whites to a 
stiff froth, mix them gradually with a pint of rich 
milk, and two large table-spoonfuls of fresh but- 
ter, softened at the fire. Mix, by degrees, the 
yolks of the eggs with the rice and Hour. Then 
add the white-of-egg mixture, a little at a time. 
Stir the whole very hard. Put it into a buttered 
tin pan with straight or upright sides. Set it in 
a moderate oven, and bake it an hour or more. 
Then turn it out of the pan, put it on a dish, and 
send it warm to the breakfast table, and eat it 
with butter. 

This cake may be baked, by setting the pan 
that contains it into an iron dutch-oven, placed 
over hot coals. Heat the lid of the oven on tho 
inside, by standing it up before the fire while the 
rice-bread is preparing ; and, after you put it ODi 
keep the lid covered with hot coals.

RICE FLOUR BREAD.— Sift into a pan a 
pint and a half of rice flour, and a pint and a 
half of fine wheat flour. Add two large table- 
spoonfuls of fresh butter or lard, and mix in a 
pint and a half of milk. Beat four eggs very 
lip;ht; then stir them gradually into the mixture. 
When the whole has been well mixed, add, at the 
last, a small tea-spoonful of soda or saleratus, dis- 
solved in as much warm water as will cover it. 
Put the whole into a buttered tin pan, set it im 
mediately into a quick oven, and bake it well. It 
is best when eaten fresh. Slice and butter it

RICE FLOUR BATTER CAKES. — Melt a 
quarter of a pound of fresh butter, or lard, in a quart 
of milk ; but be careful not to let it begin to boil. 
Divide the milk equally, by putting it into two 
pans. Beat three eggs very light, and stir them 
into one half of the milk with the addition of a 
large table-spoonful of wheat flour. Stir in as 
much ground rice flour as will make a thick batter. 
Then put in a small tea-cupful of strong fresh 
yeast, and thin the batter with the remainder of 
the milk. Cover it, and set it to rise. When it 
has risen high, and is covered with bubble^, bake 
it on a griddle in the manner of buckwheat cakes. 
Send them lo table hot» and butter them.

GROUND-NUT MACAROONS.-~Take a suf- 
ficien<jy of ground-nuts, or pea-nuts, that have been 
roasted in an iron pot over the fire; remove the 
shells, and weigh a pound of the nuts. Put thena 
into a pan of cold water, and wash off the skins. 
Have ready some beaten white of egg. Pound the 
ground-nuts (two or three at a time,) in a marble 
mortar, adding frequently a little cold water to 
prevent their oiling. They must be pounded to 
a smooth light paste ; and, as you proceed, remove 
the paste to a saucer or a plate. Beat, to a stiff 
froth, the whites of four eggs, and then beat into 
it gradually a pound of powdered loaf sugar, and 
a large tea-spoonful Of powdered mace and nut- 
meg mixed. Then stir in, by degrees, the pounded 
ground-nuts, till the mixture becomes very thick. 
Flour your hands, and roll between them por- 
tions of the mixture, forming each portion intc 
a little ball. Lay sheets of white paper on flat 
baking tins, and place on them the macaroons at 
equal distances, flattening them all a little, so as 
to press down the balls into cakes. Then sift 
powdered sugar over each. Place them in a brisk 
oven, with more heat at the top than in the bot- 
tom. Bake them brown. 

Almond macaroons may be made as above, 
mixing one quarter of a pound of shelled bitter 
almonds, with three quarters of shelled sweet ai-

monds. For almond macaroons, instead of flour- 
ing your hands, you may dip them in cold water; 
and when the macaroons are formed on the papers, 
go slightly over every one with your fingers wet 
with cold water. 

Macaroons may be made, also, of grated cocoa- 
nut mixed with beaten white of egg and powdered 
sugar. 

COLUMBIAN PUDDING.— Tie up closely in 
a bit of very thin muslin a split vanilla bean, 
zjut into pieces, and a broken-up stick of cinnamon 
Put this bag, with its contents, into half a pint of 
rich milk, and boil it a long time till very highlj^ 
flavored. Then take out the bag; set the milk 
near the fire to keep warm in the pan in which it 
was boiled, covering it closely. Slice thin a pound 
of almond sponge cake, and lay it in a deep dish. 
Pour over it a quart of rich cream, with which 
you must mix the vanilla-flavored milk, and leave 
the cake to ^dissolve in it. Blanch, in scalding 
water, two ounces of shelled bitter almonds or 
peach kernels, and pound them (one at a time,) to 
a smooth paste in a marble mortar, pouring on 
each a few drops of rose-water or peach-water to 
prevent their oiling. When the almonds are done, 
set them away in a cold place till wanted. Beat 
eight eggs till very light and thick ; and having 
stirrea together hard the dissolved cake and the 
cream, add them gradually to the mixture in tura 
with the almond, and half a pound of powdered 
loaf-sugar, a little at a time of ^aoh. Butter a deep

disli, and put in tlie mixture. Set the pudding 
into a brisk oven and bake it well. Have ready 
a star nicely cut out of a large piece of candied 
citron, a number of small stars, all of equal size, 
as many as there are States in the Union, and a 
sufficiency of rays or long strips also cut out of 
citron. The rays should be wide at the bottom 
and run to a point at the top. As soon as the 
pudding comes out of the oven, while it is smok- 
ing, arrange these decorations. Put the large star 
in the centre, then the rays so that they will 
diverge from it, narrowing off towards the edge 
of the pudding. Near the edge place the small 
stars in a circle. 

Preserved citron- melon will be still better for 
this purpose than the dry candied citron. 

This is a very fine pudding; suitable for a din- 
aer party, or a Fourth of July dinner.

A WASHINGTON PUDDING. — Pick, and 
wash clean half a pound of Zante currants ; drain 
them, and wipe them in a towel, and then spread 
them out on a flat dish, and place them before 
the fire to dry thoroughly. Prepare about a quar- 
ter of a pound or half a pint of finely-grated 
bread-crumbs. Have ready a heaping teaspoon- 
ful of powdered mace, cinnamon, and nutmeg 
mixed. When the currants are dry, dredge thein 
thickly on all sides with flour, to prevent theii 
sinking or clodding in tue pudding while baking. 
Cut up izx a deep pan h?lf a pound of the best

freeb batter, and add to it half a pound of fine 
white sugar, powdered. Stir the butter and sugar 
together with a wooden spaddle, till they are very 
light and creamy. Then add a table-spoonful of 
wine, and a table-spoonful of brandy. Beat in a 
shallow pan, eight eggs till perfectly light, and as 
thick as a good boiled custard. Afterwards, mix 
with them, gradually, a pint of rich milk and the 
grated bread-crumbs, stirred in alternately. Next, 
Btir this mixture, by degrees, into the pan of 
beaten butter and sugar, and add the currants a 
few at a time. Finish with a table-spoonful of 
strong rose-water ; or a wine-gkss full, if it is not 
very strong. Stir the whole very hard. Butter 
a large deep white dish, or two of soup-plate size. 
Put in the batter. Set it directly into a brisk 
oven, and bake it well. When cold, dredge the 
surface with powdered sugar. Serve it up in the 
dish in which it was baked. You may ornament 
the tops with bits of citron cut into leaves and 
forming a wreath ; or with circles of preserved 
Btrawberries. 

This will be found a very fine pudding. It 
must be baked in time to become quite cold be- 
fore dinner. 

For currants, you may substitute raisins of the 
best quality ; seeded, cut in half, and well dredged 
with flour. 

Instead of rose-water you may stir in the yeL 

low rind (finely grated) of one large lemon, oi two 

small ones, and their juice also.

A COTTAGE PUDDIlSra ~ Take ripe car. 
rants, and having stripped them from the stalks^ 
measure as many as will make a heaping quart. 
Cover the bottom of a deep dish with slices of 
bread, slightly buttered, and with the crust zui 
off. Put a thick layer of currants on the bread, 
and then a layer of sugar. Then other layers of 
bread, currants, and sugar, till the dish is full ; 
finishing at the top with very thin slics of bread. 
Set it into the oven, and bake it half an hour. 
Serve it either warm or cold; and eat it with 
sweetened cream. 

Instead of currants you may take cherries, 
(first stoning them all,) raspberries, ripe blackber- 
ries, or barberries, plums, (first extracting the 
stones,) stewed cranberries, or stewed gooseber- 
ries. If the fruit is previously stewed, the pud- 
ding will require but ten minutes' baking. Whea 
it is sent to table, have sugar at hand in case it 
should not be sweet enough. 



ICE-CREAM CAKES.— Stir together, till very 
light, a quarter of a pound of powdered sugar 
and a quarter of a pound of fresh butter. Beat 
six eggs very light, and stir into them a half pint 
of rich milk. Add, gradually, the eggs and milk 
to the butter and sugar, alternately with a half 
pound of sifted flour. Add a glass of sweet win« 
and some grated nutmeg. When all the ingre- 
dients are mixed, stir the batter very hard. Then 
put it into small deep pans, or cups that havo

been well buttered, filling 'them about two Ibirds 
with the batter. Set them immediately into a 
brisk oven, and bake them brown. When done, 
remove them from the cups, and place them to 
cool on an inverted sieve. When quite cold make 
a slit or incision in the side of each cake. If very 
light, and properly baked, they will be hollow in 
the middle. Fill up this cavity with ice cream, 
carefully put in with a spoon, and then close the 
slit with your fingers to prevent the cream run- 
ning out. Spread them on a large dish. Either 
send them to table immediately before the ice- 
cream melts or keep them on ice till wanted.

WHIPPED CREAM MERINGUES. — Take 
the whites of eight eggs, and beat them to a stiff 
froth that will stand alone. Then beat into them,

baking board, and with a spoon drop the mixture 
on it in long oval heaps, about four inches iu 
length. Smooth and shape them with a broad- 
bladed knife, dipped occasionally in cold water. 
The baking board used for this purpose should be 
an inch thick, and must have a slip of iron be-

board must not be of pine wood, as a pine board 
will communicate a disagreeable taste of turpen- 
tine. The oven must be moderate. Bake the 
meringues of a light brown. When cool, take 
them off the paper by slipping a knife nicely be- 
neath the bottom of each. Then push back or 
Bcoop out carefully a portion of the inside of each 
meringue, taking care not to break them. Have 
ready some nice whipped cream, made in the fol- 
lowing proportion: — Take a quarter of a pound 
of broken-up loaf sugar, and on some of the lumps 
rub off the yellow rind of two large lemons. 
Powder the sugar, and then mix with it the juice 
of the lemons, and grate in some nutmeg. Mix 
the sugar with a half pint of sweet white wine. 
Put into a pan a pint of rich cream, and whip it 
with rods or a wooden whisk, or mill it with a 
chocolate mill till it is a stiff froth. Then mix 
in, gradually, the other ingredients ; continuing 
to wnip it hard a while after they are all in. As 
70U proceed, lay the froth on an inverted sieve, 
with a dish underneath to catch the droppings; 
which droppings must afterwards be whipped and 
added to the rest. Fill the inside of each me- 
ringue with a portion of the whipped cream. 
Then put two together, so as to form one long 
oval cake, joining them nicely, so as to unite the 
flat parts that were next the paper, leaving the 
inside filled with the whipped cream. Set them 
again in the oven for a few minutes. They must 
be done with great care and nicety, so as not to

CHOCOLATE PUFFS. — Beat very stiff the 
^^hites of three eggs, and then beat in gro.dually 
half a pound of powdered loaf sugar. Scrape 
down very fine three ounces of the best choco- 
late, (prepared cocoa is better still,) and dredge it 
with flour to prevent its oiling ; mixing the flour 
well among it. Then add it gradually to the 
mixture of white of egg and sugar, and stir the 
whole very hard. Cover the bottom of a square 
tin pan with a sheet of fine white paper, cut to fit 
exactly. Place upon it thin spots of powdered 
loaf sugar about the size of a half dollar. Pile a 
portion of the mixture on each spot, smoothing it 
with the back of a spoon or a broad knife, dipped 
in cold water. Sift white sugar over the top of 
each. Set the pan into a brisk oven, and bako 
them a few minutes. When cold, loosen them 
from the paper with a broad knife.

COCOA-NUT PUFFS.— Break up a large ripe 
cocoa-nut. Pare the pieces, and lay them awhile 
in cold water. Then wipe them dry, and grate 
them as finely as possible. Lay the grated cocoa- 
nut in well-formed heaps on a large handsome 
difib. It will require no cooking. The heap«

and must not touch each other. Flatten thena 
down in the middle, so as to make a hollow in 
the centre of each heap ; and upon this pile som^ 
very nice sweetmeat. Make an excellent whipped 
cream, well sweetened and flavored with lemon 
and wine, and beat it to a stiff froth. Pile some 
of this cream high upon each cake over the sweet- 
meats. If on a supper-table, you may arrange 
them in circles round a glass stand.

FIG MARMALADE.— Take fine fresh figs 
that are perfectly ripe, such as can only be ob- 
tained in countries where they are cultivated in 
abundance. "Weigh them, and to every two 
pounds of figs allow a pound and a half of sugar, 
and the grated yellow rind of a large orange or 
lemon. Cut up the figs, and put them into a pre- 
serving kettle with the sugar, and orange or lemon 
rind, adding the juice. Boil them till the whole 
is reduced to a thick smooth mass, frequently 
stirring it up from the bottom. When done, put 
it warm into jars, and cover it closely.

CARRAWAY GINGERBREAD.— Cut up half 
a pound of fresh butter in a pint of West India 
molasses, and warm them together slightly till the 
butter is quite soft. Then stir them well, and add 
gradually a half pound of good brown sugar, a 
table-spoonful of powdered cinnamon, and two

beape-d table-spoonfuls of ground ginger, or three, 
if the ginger is not very strong. Sift two pounvls 
or two quarts of flour. Beat four eggs till very 
thick and light, and stir them gradually into the 
mixture, in turn with the flour, and five or six 
large table-spoonfuls of carraway seeds, a little at 
a time. Dissolve a very small tea-spoonful of 
pearlash or soda in as much lukewarm water as 
will cover it. Then stir it in at the last. Stir all 
very hard. Transfer it to a buttered tin pan with 
straight sides, and bake it in a loaf in a moderate 
oven. It will require a great deal oi baking. 



SEA- VOYAGE GmGERBRE AD. — Sift two 
pounds of flour into a pan, and cut up in it a 
pound a-nd a quarter of fresh butter ; rub the 
butter well into the flour, and then mix in a pint 
of West India molasses and a pound of the best 
brown sugar. Beat eight eggs till very light. 
Stir into the beaten egg two glasses or a jill of 
brandy. Add also to the egg a tea-cupful of 
ground ginger, and a table- spoonful of powdered 
cinnamon^ with a tea-spoonful of soda melted in a 
little warm water. Wet the flour, &c., with this 
mixture till it becomes a soft dough. Sprinkle a 
little flour on your pasteboard, and with a broad 
knife spread portions of the mixture thickly and 
smoothly upon it. The thickness must be equal 
all through ; therefore spread it carefully and 
evenly, as the dough will be too soft to roll out. 
Then with the edge of a tumbler dipped in flour,

pans, slightly buttered ; lay the cakes in them 
suffici-ently far apart to prevent their running 
into each other when baked. Set the pans into a 
brisk oven, and bake the cakes well, seeing that 
they do not burn. 

You may cut them out small with the lid of a 
cannister (or something similar) the usual size of 
gingerbread nuts. 

These cakes will keep during a long voyage, 
and are frequently carried to sea. Many persons 
find highly-spiced gingerbread a preventive to 
s 3a- sickness. 

EXCELLENT GROUND RICE PUDDING.— 
Take half a pint from a quart of rich milk, and 
boil in it a large handful of bitter almonds oi 
peach kernels, blanched and broken up ; also half 
a dozen blades of mace, keeping the sauce-pan 
closely covered. When the milk is highly fla- 
vored and reduced to one half the quantity, taka 
it off and strain it. Stir, gradually, into the re- 
maining pint and a half of milk, five heaping 
table-spoonfuls of ground rice; set it over the fira 
in a sauce-pan, and let it come to a boil. Theo 
take it off, and while it is warm, mix in gradually 
a quarter of a pound of fresh butter and a quarter 
of a pound of white sugar. Afterwards, beat 
eight eggs as light as possible, and stir them gra- 
dually into the mixture. Add some grated nut- 
meg. Stir the whole very hard ; put it into a deep 
dish, and set it immediately into the oven. Keep il

CHOCOLATE MACAROONS.— Blanch half a 
pound of shelled sweet almonds, by scalding them 
with boiling water, till the skins peel off easily. 
Then throv/ them into a bowl of cold water, and let 
them stand awhile. Take them out and wipe them 
separately. Afterwards set them in a warm place to 
dry thoroughly. Put them, one at a time, into a 
marble mortar, and pound them to a smooth paste, 
moistening them, as you proceed, with a few drops 
of rose-water to prevent their oiling. When you 
have pounded one or two, take them out of the 
mortar with a tea-spoon, and put them into a deep 
plate beside you, and continue removing the al- 
monds to the plate till they are all done. Scrape 
down, as fine as possible, half a pound of the best 
chocolate, or of Baker's prepared cocoa, and mix 
it thoroughly with the pounded almonds. Then 
set the plate in a cool place. Put the whites of 
eight eggs into a shallow pan, and beat them to a 
stiff froth that will stand alone. Ilave ready a 
pound and a half of finely-powdered loaf sugar. 
Stir it hard into the beaten white-of-egg, a spoon- 
ful at a time. Then stir in, gradually, the mixture 
of almond and chocolate, and beat the whole very- 
hard. Drop the mixture in equal portions upon

BREAD FRITTERS. — Pick, wash, and dry 
half a pound of Zante currants, and having spread 
them out on a flat dish, dredge them well with 
flour. Grate some bread into a pan, till you have 
a pint of crumbs. Pour over the grated bread a 
pint of boiling milk, into which you have stirred, 
(as soon as taken from the fire,) a piece of fresh 
butter the size of an egg. Cover the pan and let it 
stand an hour. Then beat it hard, and add nut- 
meg, and a quarter of a pound of powdered white 
sugar, stirred in gradually, and two table-spoon- 
fuls of the best brandy. Beat six eggs till very 
light, and then stir them by degrees into the mix- 
ture. Lastly, add the currants a few at a time, 
and beat the whole very hard. It should be a 
thick batter. If you find it too thin, add a little 
flour. Have ready, over the fire, a hot frying-pan 
with boiling lard. Put in the batter in large 
spoonfuls, (so as not to touch,) and fry the fritters 
a light brown. Drain them on a perforated skim- 
mer, or an inverted sieve placed in a deep pan, 
and send them to table hot. Eat them with wine, 
and powdered sugar.

very hcsi fresh butter. Cut it up in a large tin 
sauce-pan, or in any clean cooking vessel lined 
wiih tin. Set it over the fire, and boil and skim 
it during half an hour. Then pour it off, care- 
fully, through a funnel into a stone jar, and cover 
it closely with a bladder or leather tied down over 
the li'i The butter having thus been separated 
from the salt and sediment, (which will be found 
remaining at the bottom of the boiling vessel,) if 
kept closely covered and set in a cool place, will 
continue good for a month, and be found excel- 
lent for frying and stewing, and other culinary 
purposes. Prepare it thus in May or June, and 
you may use it in winter, if living in a place where 
fresh butter is scarce at that season.

EXCELLENT MUTTON SOUP— Having been 
accidentally omitted in its proper place, we here 
insert a receipt for very fine mutton soup. Try 
it. If for a large family, take two necks of mut- 
ton of the best quality, and let the butcher disjoint 
it. To each pound of meat allow a quart of water. 
Put it into a soup-pot, with a slice of ham, which 
will render the soup sufficiently salt. Boil it 
slowly, and skim it well, till the scum ceases to 
appear. If you have no ham, season the meat, 
when you first put it in, with a tea-spoonful of salt. 
In the mean time prepare the vegetables, but do 
nol put them in till the meat has boiled to rags, 
and all the scum has risen to the surface and been 
carefully removed. It is then time to strain out 



642 MISS Leslie's new cook book, 

the shreds of meat and bone, returi the soup .0 
the pot, and add the vegetables. Fii^j have ready 
the deep yellow outsides of three or four carrots 
grated, and stir them into the soup to enrich it, 
&nd give it a fine color. Next, add turrxips, pota- 
t03, parsnips, salsify, celery, (including its green 
leaves from the top) and onions that have been 
already peeled and boiled by themselves to render 
them less strong. All the vegetables should be cut 
nicely into small pieces of equal size, (as for Soup 
a la Julienne.) You may add some boiled beecs, 
handsomely sliced. And (if approved) strew in 
at the last a handful of fresh leaves of the maiy- 
gold flower, which adds a flavor to some persons 
very agreeable. Put all these vegetables g."*adu. 
ally into the soup, (those first that require the 
longest boiling,) and when they are all quite done 
the soup is finished. If well made, with a iib^.ral 
allowance of meat and vegetables, and well boO^d, 
it will be much liked — particularly if served ^3 
Julienne soup, for company.

bang it up m the dairy witli a pan under it to 
receive the droppings, till it drips no longer. 
Then transfer the curd to a small cheese mould. 
Cover it all over with a clean linen cloth, folded 
over the sides, and well secured. Put a heavy 
weight on the top, so as to press it hard. The 
wooden vessel in which you mould cream cheeses, 
should be a bottomless, broad hoop, about the cir- 
cumference of a dinner plate. Set it (before you 
till it with the curd) on a ycvj cle;^.n lablft or largo 
fiat dish. Turn it every i\»y for four dajj, seep- 
ing it covered thickly all over with fresh green 
grass, frequently renewed. When done, keep it in 
a dry cool place, first rubbing the outside with 
fresh butter. When once cut^ use the whole cheese 
on that day, as it may spoil before the next. Send

yieces. 

MOLASSES CANDY.— Take three quarts ol 
the best West India molasses — no other will do 
put it into a thick block-tin kettle, (or a ham' 
marie) and stir in a pound and a half of the best 
and cleanest brown sugar. Boil slowly and skim 
it well, (stirring it always after skimming,) and 
taking care that it does not burn. Prepare the 
grated rind and the juice of three large lemons or 
oranges, and stir them in after the molasses and 
sugar have boiled long enough to become very 
thick. Continue to boil and stir till it will boil 
no longer, and the spoon will no longer move. 
Try some in a saucer, and let it get cold. If it is

brittle, it is done. Then take it from the fire, and 
transfer it immediately to shallow square tin pans, 
that have been been well greased with nice fresh 
butter or sweet oil. Spread it evenly, and set is 
to cool. 

While boiling, you may add three or four spoon- 
fuls of shell-barkS; cracked clean from their 
shells, and divided into halves. Or the same 
quantity of roasted pea-nuts or ground-nuts. 
With botu nata and lemon it will be very good.

THE BEST CEMENT FOE JARS.—Before 
preserving and pickling time, buy at a druggist's, 
two ounces of the clearest and whitest gum traga- 
canth. Obtain also tAVO grains of corrosive sabli-

picked the gum tragacantli clean, and free from 
dust and dark or discolored particles, put it with 
the sublimate into a very clean yellow or .vhite- 
ware mug that holds a small quart and has a close- 
fitting lid belonging to it. Then fill the vessel 
more than two-thirds with very clean water, either 
warm or cold, and put on the lid. Let it rest till 
next morning. Then stir it with an unpainted 
stick, that wUl reach quite down to the bottom. 
Repeat the stirring frequently through the day, 
always replacing the lid. In a few days the ce- 
ment will have risen to the top of the mu.g, and 
have become a fine, clear, smooth paste, /ar supe- 
rior to any other ; and, by means of the corrosive 
sublimate, it will keep perfectly well to an indefi^ 
nite penod, if always closely covered, and having 
no sort of metal dipped into it. On no account 
attempt to keep this paste in tin, or even in silver. 
Both paste and metal will turn black and become 
spotted. Remember this. 

Whe;ii going to put away your sweetmeats or 
pickles, this paste will come into use, and bs found 
invaluable. It is best to keep all these things in 
fimall jars, as opening a large jar frequently, n>ay

injure its contents bj letting in the air. In a larga 
family, or where many pickles are eaten, those in 
most frequent use may be kept m stone- ware jars, 
with a wooden spoon always at hand for taking 
them out when wanted. On the surface of every 
jar of pickles, put one or two table-spoonfuls of 
salad oil, and then cover the top of the jar closely 
with a circular piece of bladder or thin leather. 
Next cut out a narrow band of the same, and ce- 
ment it on with gum tragacanth paste, (made as 
above), and let it remain till you open the jar for 
use. 

For sweetmeats, have glass or white- ware jars. 
Lay on the surface of each a circular paper, cut to 
fit and dipped in brandy. Next, put on an out- 
side cover of bladder or thick white paper secured 
with a band of the same, coated with tragacanth 
paste. When this cement is used, the jars will 
not be infested with ants or other insects, the cor- 
rosive sublimate keeping them out. 

This paste should be at hand in every library or 
office, when wanted for papers or books. It re- 
quires no boiling when made, and is always ready, 
-and never spoils. For a small quantity, take an 
ounce of the best gum tragacanth and a grain of 
corrosive sublimate. Get a covered white or yel' 
low-ware mug that holds a pint ; such a mug will 
cost but twelve cents. Dissolve in less than a 
pint of water.

—These- are -most useful and satisfactory ut^jnsil?,

as all who have tried them can certify. They are 
to be had of various sizes at the best household 
furniture stores, and are made to order by the 
chief tinsmiths. The French make great use of the 
Bain- Marie ; which, in some measure, accounts for 
the general superiority of their cookery. 

This utensil, as made in America, is a double 
kettle of the strongest and best block-tin. The 
bottom of the outside kettle is of strong copper or 
iron, well tinned, and kept so. The food, however, 
is all contained in the inner kettle, which is of tin 
entirely. After the food is in, (having with it no 
water whatever), put on the lid tightly, and 
through the tube on the outside, pour into the 
outer kettle the water that is to cook it. If it 
boils away too fast, replenish it with more water 
poured in at the tube. 

If it boils too slowly, quicken it by adding some 
Bait put in at the tube. Keep the kettle closely 
covered, except when removing the lid to take 
off the scum ; and do this quick and seldom. The 
Buperfluous steam is all the time escaping through 
the top of the tube and through a very small hole 
in the lid. Nothing cooked in this manner (with 
all the water outside) can possibly burn or scorch. 
After every skimming, stir the stew down to the 
bottom before you replace the lid. To cook in a 
Bain- Marie, requires a strong, steady heat, well 
kept up ; and you must begin earlier than in the 
common way of stewing. This is an excellent 
vessel for boiling custards, blancmanges, marma- 
lades, and many other nice tMngs; as a good 
40

housewife will soon discover. Also, for making 
beef tea and other preparations for invalids. It 
is well to keep a small one purposely for a sick 
room. 

If from deficiency of sugar, or being kept too 
warm, or not closely covered, any of your sweet- 
meats turn sour, do not hastily throw them away, 
but carefully remove the surface, (even if coated 
with blue mould), add an additional portion of 
sugar so as to make them very sweet, and put 
them into a Bain-Marie. Fill the outer kettle 
with Jwt water, and boil it till you find the pre- 
serves restored to their proper taste. Then put 
them up again in jars that have been well scalded, 
rinsed, and sunned, and lay brandied paper on 
the surface of each. 

Mouldy pickles may be recovered in a similar 
manner, adding fresh spices and vinegar before 
you put them up again.
