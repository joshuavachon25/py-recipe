INTRODUCTION 

In the effort to plan menus which comply with sugges- 
tions and requirements of the Food Administration and 
which at the same time meet financial ends, the resources 
of the Institutional Manager or Lunch Room Director are 
taxed to the utmost. While much has been done to aid 
the homemaker, Uttle has been pubHshed, in practical 
form, to meet the need of the larger institutions. 

This bulletin has been arranged with the idea of meeting 
the multiphcity of demands caused by the increasing num- 
ber of inexperienced young people going direct from college 
or training school to more or less responsible positions now 
being created to fill the great demand for group feeding in 
military hospitals, canteens and community kitchens. The 
aim and purpose is to furnish recipes and suggestions 
helpful to those who are trying to cope with the present 
situation by increasing the variety of dishes which are 
palatable, nutritious, economical and practicable. 

By listing the recipes under group headings, foods are 
roughly classified according to types, that is, meats, 
including left-overs, meat substitutes, salads, etc. This 
arrangement makes easy the selection of dishes for each 
course in a meal. It is not expected that the variety is 
sufficiently complete to meet all the needs of the menu 
maker; but with the variety available in different locaHties 
it is hoped that these combinations will suggest other 
ways of making attractive the unusual foods and also, 
means of stretching those which should be conserved. 

As planned, these recipes allow for one hundred generous 
portions sufficient for the substantial part of the meal, as is 
3 



4 INTRODUCTION 

usually the case where an d la carte menu is used. How- 
ever, care has been taken to state the weight or measure 
of each portion so that one using the recipe may judge 
whether or not it is suited to the needs of the particular 
group. The recipes are adapted to the use of a practical 
cook or chef, and have been used by many with equally 
good results. Weights rather than measures are given for 
the dry ingredients to insure accuracy and to save time. 
Cooks who are not used to scales soon learn to use them 
very successfully. In a small kitchen balance or dial scales, 
and in a large one table-size platform and balance scales 
have proved adequate and practical. 

Because cooks are apt to be inaccurate in measuring 
small amounts and because it is safer to under-season 
when catering to large numbers of people, only the mini- 
mum amounts of such seasonings as salt, pepper, onions, 
spice, etc., are given. It is expected that the cook will 
taste the dish and season it to please those to whom she 
caters. 

The recipes are chosen from those used and found popu- 
lar at the Horace Mann Lunch Room, Teachers College. 
If they prove of value to others the purpose of the writer 
will have been accompUshed.
