We may live without poetry, music and art; 

We may live without conscience, and 
live without heart; 

We may live without friends, we may 
live without books; 

Hut civilized man cannot live without cooks.

Short Method for Bread Making 

Scald one and one-half pints milk ; dissolve 1 cake compressed yeast 
in two-thirds cupful lukewarm water; add two tablespoonfuls sugar; sift 
two sifters of Albers flour in mixing- bowl. When milk is lukewarm, 
add one large tablespoonful salt; add dissolved yeast to milk; make well 
in center of flour, and add milk. Stir with mixing spoon until flour is all 
taken up, then turn out on board and knead well for twenty minutes. 
Return to bowl and let raise in warm place, well covered. This will take 
from two to three hours. When sufficiently risen, punch down and let 
stand for three-quarters of an hour longer (doubled in bulk). Mold into 
loaves or rolls, handling the dough very gently. Put in well-greased 
pans, let raise and bake. Rolls should raise at least one-half hour and 
loaves one hour. Bake rolls twenty-five minutes and loaves one hour in 
wood or coal range, or forty-five minutes in gas range. If desired to make 
this bread over night, use only one tablespoonful sugar and one and one- 
half tablespoonfuls salt. Bread made by this method can be set at seven 
o'clock in the morning and should be out of the oven by noon. 

If desired to make bread at night, use method as above at night just 
before retiring, and in the morning dough will be ready to put into pans; 
let raise and bake. If dough is made into loaves at seven in the morning, 
it should be baked by nine o'clock. 

Brown Bread 

( >ne pint Indian corn meal, t pint Albers rye flour, 1 teaspoon brown 
sugar, one teaspoon salt, two teaspoons baking powder, one table- 
spoon butter or lard, y± pint milk. Sift together corn meal, rye flour, 
sugar, salt and powder. Rub in the shortening; add the milk and mix all 
into a batter. Put into greased tin and bake about forty minutes in a 
rather hot oven. Cover at first with paper. 

Graham Bread — Unfermented 

One and one-half pints graham flour, one-half pint of Albers flour, 
one tablespoon sugar, one teaspoon salt, two teaspoons baking powder, 
1 and one-fourth pints milk, or equal parts of milk and water. Sift 
Albers graham flour, sugar, salt and powder together; add the 
milk, or milk and water; mix rapidly into soft dough, then put in 
greased tin. Bake in rather hot oven about forty minutes. Protect loaf 
with paper first fifteen minutes. 

Corn Bread 

One cup fine white corn meal, one and one-half cups milk, two eggs, 
one teaspoon sugar, one tablespoon butter, two level teaspoons Baking 
Powder, % teaspoon salt. Scald the milk and pour on the corn meal. 
Let it cool, then add salt, sugar, baking powder and yolks of eggs and 
beat quickly and thoroughly together. Fold in the stiffly beaten whites 
of eggs. Bake in a flat pan in hot oven for about thirty minutes.

CEREAL FOODS and FLOURS 



In a bulletin recently issued by the U. S. Department of Agriculture 
will be found this statement: "Cereals supply actual digestible nutrients 
to the body more cheaply than any other class of food except dried 
legumes (beans)." 

It would follow, therefore, that the young housewife should know 
the best methods of preparing Cereal Breakfast Foods. Before giving 
a list of recipes for accomplishing the best results with cereals and 
flours, the following table is given to show how economical and valuable 
cereals are. Protein as used in this table is the most important and 
most expensive element in food. A calorie is the amount of strength 
or energy necessary to lift 15 pounds one foot high 200 times. 

Cost per Pound Amount of Energy 
Kind of Food of Protein in 10c Worth 

Rolled Wheat @ 6c 68 2505 

Rolled Oats @ 6c $ .48 2938 

Flour @ Z%c 35 4700 

Corn Flakes Toasted @ 10c 1.33 1735 

Round Steak @ 16c 87 560 

Leg of Mutton (a) 20c 1.37 445 

Roast Pork @ 12c 92 1035 

Eggs @ 24c 1.39 385 

By comparing the above figures it will readily be seen that cereals 
furnish by far a greater amount of nutrients than meats. So much so 
that were the source of the facts other than actual government reports 
they would not be believed. It will be noticed also that of the cereals, 
Oats furnishes almost twice as much nourishment for the money as 
parched Corn Flakes. 

ONE DOZEN SPECIAL RECIPES NOT FOUND 
ELSEWHERE IN THIS BOOK. 

Rolled Oat Mush 

To two parts of boiling water, salted to taste, slowly stir in one 
part of ALBERS ROLLED OATS and boil for ten to twenty minutes, 
then allow to simmer, stirring occasionally. Serve with sugar and cream. 
Carnation Rolled Oats may be used in place of Albers Rolled Oats. 
We recommend the use of a double boiler, in which case the inner boiler 
should be placed in the outer boiler, in which the water is already boiling, 
after the flakes have been boiling about two minutes. Cook in double 
boiler ten or fifteen minutes more, but do not stir. 

Wheat Flake Mush 

;• To boiling water, salted to taste, stir in slowly equal parts of 
ALBERS WHEAT FLAKES, or less if desiring thinner consistency. 
Boil five to ten minutes, then allow to simmer, stirring occasionally. 
Serve: with cream and sugar. Carnation Wheat Flakes may be used in 
place of Albers AYheat Flakes. We recommend the use of a double 
boiler.

Milk Toast 



Take one quart milk ; when it comes to a boil, thicken with one 
teaspoonful corn starch and add salt to taste. Toast the bread a light 
brown ; butter each slice, put layers of toast in a covered dish and pour on 
the thickened milk, then more toast and milk, and so on till the dish is 
full ; cover and let stand five minutes. 

German Toast 

Cut slices of stale bread, dip them in enough milk to soften, then 
dip in beaten egg; put in a pan with just enough butter to fry brown 
as an omelet, then serve. Like pancakes, the hotter the toast the better. 

Ham Toast 

Chop cold boiled ham very fine, toast slices of bread and butter 
them. After laying the ham on toast place in oven for a few minutes 
Beat four eggs with milk and salt and pepper. Pour the eggs into a 
saucepan with a lump of butter and stir till thick, but do not boil. Put

chopped fine, and grate the yolks over the top. 

Mock Cream-Toast 

Melt two ounces of butter in a quart of morning's milk, take a 
large teaspoonful of Albers flour, freed from lumps, and the yolks of 
three eggs beaten light; beat these ingredients together several minutes; 
strain the cream through a fine hair sieve, and when wanted heat it 
slowly, beating constantly with a brisk movement; it must not boil or it 
will curdle and lose the appearance of cream; when hot dip the toast; if 
not sufficiently seasoned with butter, add salt; send to the table hot, the 
cream not taken up by the toast, in gravy bowl.

To Make Icing for Cakes 

Beat the whites of two small eggs to a froth, then add to them a 
quarter of a pound of white sugar, ground fine like flour flavor with 
lemon extract or vanilla, beat it until it is light and very white, but not 
quite so stiff as kiss mixture ; the longer it is beaten the more firm it will 
become. No more sugar must be added to make it so. Beat the frosting 
until it may be spread smoothly on the cake. This quantity will ice quite 
a large cake over the top and sides. 

Marble Cake 

White Parts: — Whites of seven eggs, three cups white sugar, one 
of butter, one of sour milk, four cups of Albers flour, sifted and heaping, 
one teaspoon soda ; flavor to taste. 

Dark Parts: — Yolks of seven eggs, three cups of brown sugar, one 
of butter, one of sour milk, four of Albers flour, sifted and heaping, one 
tablespoon each of cinnamon, allspice and cloves, one teaspoon soda ; 
put in pans a spoonful of white part and then a spoonful of dark part, 
and so on. Bake an hour and a quarter. This will make one large and 
one medium cake. The white and dark parts are alternated, either put- 
ting in a spoonful of white then a dark or a layer of white and then of 
dark part, being careful that the cake may be nicely "marbleized." 

Chocolate Layer Cake 

Grate one cake of unsweetened chocolate, add four tablespoonfuls 
Albers flour, two teaspoonfuls baking powder, one cupful of sugar, five 
eggs beaten with the sugar. Beat all fifteen minutes and bake in layers. 

Filling — One cupful of milk, one heaping teaspoonful of corn starch, 
mixed smooth in milk. Beat 3 eggs separately, add yolks to cup of milk, 
add 2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla extract. When warm, add butter the size 
of a hickory nut and one-half cupful of sugar. Stir in the beaten whites 
when cool. 

Fig Cake 

Two cups of sugar, one of butter, one of cold water, dissolve one 
teaspoonful of soda; three cups of raisins, chopped fine, cinnamon 
and nutmeg, four eggs, one pound of figs ; use the figs whole, cover- 
ing them well with the cake to prevent burning. Bake in layers, frosting 
between each layer. Make as stiff as pound cake. Cut with very sharp 
knife to prevent crumbling. This makes two loaves.

Puff Paste 

One quart of Albers flour, one pint of butter, or butter and lard 
half and half, a pinch of salt, one and one-quarter cupfuls of cold water. 
Sprinkle the salt in the flour and with the hands mix in quickly the 
shortening until all is smooth. Mix the cold water quickly as possible 
and roll out and fit to a pie plate. The flour on the crust is all that is 
needed to prevent the crust from sticking ; cut off evenly around the edge 
of plate — gather up the scraps and make another sheet for the top of the 
pie and roll out the upper sheet a little thinner than the under crust, lap 
one half over the other and cut four or five small slits at the center. Fill 
the pie with prepared filling, wet the edge of the rim to prevent the 
juices from running out, lay the upper crust across the center of the 
pie, turn back the half that is lapped, slightly press the edges down with 
your thumb, dipping occasionally into flour to prevent sticking. Bake 
to a light brown. Paste 

Three cups of Albers Hour (sifted), one large cup butter, one-half 
teaspoon baking powder, two tablespoons sugar, one-half cup milk. Sift 
flour with powder and sugar, rub in butter, add milk ; mix into a smooth 
dough of medium stiffness. 

German Paste 

Take three-quarters of a pound of Albers flour, put into it half a 
pound of butter, the same of powdered sugar, and the peel of a lemon 
grated ; make a hole in the middle of the flour, break in the yolk of two 
eggs, reserving the whites, which are to be well beaten ; then mix all 
well together. If the eggs do not sufficiently moisten the paste, add half 
an eggshell of water. Mix all thoroughly, but do not handle too much. 
Roll out thin, and it may be used for all sorts of pastry. Before putting 
it into the oven, wash over the pastry with the white of the beaten eggs, 
and shake over a little powdered sugar. 

Rich Short Crust 

Break ten ounces of butter into a pound of Albers flour dried and 
sifted, add a pinch of salt and two ounces of loaf sugar rolled fine. Make 
it into a very smooth paste as light as possible, with two well-beaten eggs 
and sufficient milk to moisten the paste. 

To Ice Pastry 

To ice pastry, which is the usual method adopted for fruit and sweet 
dishes of pastry, put the white of an egg on a plate, and with the blade 
of a knife beat it to a stiff froth. When the pastry is nearly baked, brush 
it over with this, and sift over some powdered sugar; put it back into 
the oven to set a glaze, and in a few minutes it will be done. Great care 
should be taken that the paste does not catch or burn in the oven, which 
it is very liable to do after the icing is laid on. 

What a happy future for you.

Lemon Pie 

One small teacup of boiling- water, put in juice and rind of one lemon, 
one teaspoonful of corn starch to thicken ; then add four egg yolks, one 
cup of sugar, mixed together ; beat the whites of two eggs stiff and put in 
with egg yolks and sugar. After custard is done put on top the whites 
of the other two eggs, put in oven and brown. Bake pie crust first. 

Apple Pie 

Stew green or ripe apples, when you have pared and cored them. 
Mash to a smooth compote, sweeten to taste, and while hot, stir in a tea- 
spoon butter for each pie. Season with nutmeg. When cool, fill your 
crust, and either cross-bar the top with strips of paste, or make without 
cover. Eat cold, with powdered sugar strewed over it. 

Pumpkin Pie 

The following measure will make three good sized pies: Put into 
your mixing dish one quart and a pint of stewed and strained pumpkin, 
about one-quarter pound sugar, half cup molasses, half a tablespoon

Vanilla Sauce 



Put one-half pint milk in small saucepan over the fire; when scalding 
hot, add yolks of three eggs ; stir until thick as boiled custard ; add, when 
taken from the fire and cooled, one tablespoon extract vanilla and whites 
of eggs whipped stiff. 

Orange Sauce 

Mix one teaspoonful corn starch with two tablespoonfuls of sugar. 
Squeeze the juice from three oranges and heat it. When sufficiently hot 
add corn starch and sugar and cook till clear. 

Wine Sauce 

Three-quarters pint water, one cup sugar, one small teaspoon corn 
starch, one teaspoonful of extract lemon and cinnamon, one-half gill of 
wine. Boil water, add corn starch, dissolved, and the sugar; boil fifteen 
minutes, strain ; when about to serve, add extracts and wine. 

Chocolate Sauce 

Scald one pint milk in double boiler. Add one tablespoonful corn 
starch mixed with one-half tablespoonful Albers flour and few grains salt 
dissolved in cold milk, and cook over hot water ten minutes. Melt one 
and one-half squares chocolate, add one-quarter cup sugar, stir until 
smooth and add to thickened milk. Beat whites two eggs until stiff, add 
one-half cup sugar and yolks two eggs mixed, not beaten, together, and 
pour hot mixture slowly into egg mixture. Turn back into boiler, let 
stand over hot water, but not cook, for a minute or two. Add one tea- 
spoon vanilla. Cool before serving. 

Ice Cream 

One quart of milk, 7 eg&s, yolks and whites beaten separately, 
four cupfuls of sugar, two quarts of sweet cream, six tablespoon- 
fuls of flavoring. Scald the milk in a double boiler, beat the yolks 
extra white, add the sugar and beat a little longer, run little by little, add 
the boiling milk, beating continuously, stir in the well-beaten white of 
eggs, return to the boiler and cook until as thick as boiled custard, stir- 
ring steadily ; take off fire, and when quite cool stir in the cream and 
flavoring:; then freeze. 




To Fry Fish 

After the fish is well cleansed, lay it on a folded towel and dry out 
all the water; when well wiped and dry, roll it in wheat flour, rolled 
crackers, grated stale bread or Indian meal, whichever may be preferred; 
Albers flour will generally be liked. Have a thick-bottomed frying pan 
with plenty of sweet lard salted (a tablespoonful of salt to each pound of 
lard) for fresh fish which have not been previously salted; let it become 
boiling hot, then lay the fish in and let it fry gently until one side is a 
fine, delicate brown, then turn the other; when both are done take it up 
carefully and serve quickly, or keep it covered with a tin cover, and set 
the dish where it will keep hot. 

To Broil Fish 

Rub the bars of your gridiron with dripping or a piece of beef suet, 
to prevent the fish from sticking. Put a good piece of butter into a dish, 
enough salt and peper to season the fish. Lay the fish on it when it is 
broiled, and with a knife put the butter over every part. Serve very hot. 

To Bake Fish Whole 

Cut off the head and split the fish down nearly to the tail ; prepare a 
dressing of bread, butter, pepper and salt, moisten with a little water. 
Fill the dish with this dressing, and bind it together with a piece of 
string; lay the fish on a bake-pan and pour round it a little water and 
melted butter. Baste frequently. A good-sized fish will bake in an hour. 
Serve with the gravy of the fish, drawn butter. 

Broiled Salt Mackerel 

Freshen by soaking it over night in water, being careful that the skin 
iies uppermost. In the morning dry it without breaking, cut off the 
head and tip of the tail, place it between the bars of a buttered fish- 
gridiron, and broil to a light brown ; lay it on a hot dish, and dress with 
a little butter, pepper, and lemon juice, vinegar. 

Fried Bass With Bacon 

Clean required number of bass, season with pepper and salt, roll in 
Albers flour, drop in pan of hot lard or oil and fry to a golden brown. 
Fry in a separate pan some bacon ; one piece for each piece of fish, and lay 
on the fish. Garnish with parsley. 

Broiled Salmon 

Cut six slices of salmon, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dip in beaten 
eggs and bread crumbs. Place in a saucepan, cook both sides quickly. 
Drain and lay them in a dish. Garnish them with a few pieces of lemon 
dipped in parsley chopped fine and some eggs fried in oil.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Boiled Salmon 

Sew as many pounds as desired up in a cheese-cloth bag, and boil 
for a quarter of an hour to the pound, in slightly salted water. When 
done, take out and lay upon a dish, being careful not to break the fish. 
Prepare a small cupful of drawn butter, in which had been stirred a tea- 
spoonful of minced parsley and the juice of one-fourth of a lemon. Pour 
over the salmon and serve. Garnish with parsley. The choicest portion 
of the salmon is that at the center and toward the tail. 

Boiled Halibut 

Purchase a thick slice cut through the body, or the tail piece, which 
is considered the richest. Wrap it in a floured cloth and lay it in warm 
water with salt in it. A piece weighing six pounds should be cooked 
in half an hour after the water begins to boil. Melted butter and parsley 
are eaten with it. If any is left, lay it in a deep dish and sprinkle on it 
a little salt, throw over it twelve cloves in some vinegar, and it will, when 
cold, have much the flavor of lobster. 

Baked Bass 

Make filling of cracker or bread crumbs, an egg, pepper, cloves, salt 
and butter. Fill very full, when sewed up, grate over it a small nutmeg 
and sprinkle it with pounded cracker. Then pour on the white of one 
egg, and a little melted butter. Bake it an hour in the same dish in 
which it is to be served. 

Baked Bass— No. 2 

Select a choice bass, weighing in the neighborhood of four pounds ; 
season with salt and pepper and roll in flour. Roast with a good slice 
butter, three tablespoonfuls of catsup, two tablespoonfuls Worcestershire 
sauce, one small onion and a clove of garlic. Bake four minutes and add 
the juice of fifteen cent's worth of California oysters and a little water, 
if necessary, to make enough gravy. Ten minutes before serving, add a 
wine glass of white wine and ten cents' worth of picked shrimps; just 
before removing from the oven add the 15 cents' worth of oysters and 
let cook up once. 

Fried Finnan Haddies 

Rub oil on both sides of the fish, and set it in a frying-pan, with 
plenty of butter. Shake the pan over a clear fire. Three minutes will 
cook it. Then rub a little butter over it and send to table. 

Fish Cutlets 

Season with salt and pepper, pint of any cold cooked fish ; make thick 
cream sauce of milk, butter and Albers flour, when cold mold it with the 
fish into shapes of cutlets. Put the cutlets first into cracker crumbs, 
then into egg and again into crumbs. Fry in hot fat until brown.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Codfish Balls 

Put fish in cold water, set on back of stove ; when water gets hot, 
pour off and put cold again until fish is sufficiently fresh ; then pick it up. 
Boil potatoes and mash them, mix fish and potatoes together, while po- 
tatoes are hot, taking two-thirds potatoes and one-third fish. Put in plenty 
of butter; make into balls and fry in plenty of lard. Have lard hot be- 
fore putting in balls. Variation may be had by rolling each ball in beaten 
egg, then in dry bread crumbs before frying. 

Fish Steaks Fried 

Cut the slices of fresh fish three-quarters of an inch thick, sprinkle 
with Albers flour, or cornmeal slightly salted or dip them in eggs lightly 
salted and roll in crumbs ; fry a light brown. Salmon or any other large 
fish can be fried this way. 

Creamed Fish 

Pick (not shred) one cupful of codfish ; place in a spider and fill and 
cover with cold water. Stir a moment over the fire and pour off the 
water. Stand on the stove, cover the fish with one and one-half pints of 
milk and a large tablespoonful of butter. Stir into a cup of cold cream 
two heaping tablespoonfuls of Albers flour and when the milk on the 
stove is about to boil mix this with it. When the mixture has thickened 
stand where it will boil no longer and stir into it one egg. Serve at once. 

Fish Chowder 
Two pounds of fresh white fish, a quarter of a pound of bacon, five 
small potatoes, one small onion, six tomatoes, one quart of milk, butter 
the size of a small hen's egg and a teaspoon Albers flour. Pick the fish 
to pieces. Remove the bone and skin; cut potatoes into small squares; 
the bacon in small pieces; rub the butter and flour to a cream. Spread 
in a granite kettle half of the potatoes, then half of the fish, then sprinkle 
in the minced onions, then the bacon, then half of the tomatoes. Then 
a shake of salt and pepper; add the rest of the fish, tomatoes, potatoes, 
and more salt and pepper, using in all one teaspoon of salt and one-fourth 
teaspoon of pepper. Cover with water, let simmer for half an hour. Scald 
the milk, put a pinch of soda into the chowder and stir; add the hot milk 
to the butter and flour; stir smooth; then add to the chowder. Serve 
very hot. 

Fish Balls 

The remnants of any cold fish can be used by breaking the fish to 
pieces with a fork, removing all the bones and skin, and shredding very 
fine. Add an equal quantity of mashed potatoes, make into a stiff batter 
with a piece of butter and some milk, and a beaten egg. Flour your hands 
and shape the mixture into balls. Fry in boiling lard or drippings, to a 
light brown. 

Fish Croquettes 

Take remnants of boiled cod, salmon or halibut and pick the flesh 
out carefully. Mince it moderately fine. Stir a piece of butter, a small 
spoon Albers flour and some milk over fire until they thicken. Then add 
pepper, salt and a little grated nutmeg, together with finely-chopped 
parsley, and then the minced fish. When very hot remove from the fire, 
turn on a dish to get cold, then shape and finish the croquettes.

Deviled Sardines 

Roll each fish in a mixture of mustard, Worcestershire sauce, an- 
chovy sauce and a little melted butter. Lay each on a slice of toast in 
a hot oven for five minutes. Serve immediately. (The "Mustard" 
Sardines are easiest prepared this way, as the mustard in which they 
are packed can be utilized). 

Sardine Rolls 

Make a nice, rich pie crust, cut in four-inch squares. Put 
one soused sardine in center of each square. Roll up and close ends 
by pinching. Bake quickly as you would pie. Garnish platter with 
lettuce leaves. This makes a delicious luncheon dish.

fuls of grated cheese, stir until cheese is melted, add gradually the beaten 
yolk of an egg mixed with one-fourth cup of cream. Stir until smooth and 
thick, and add l / 2 teaspoonful of salt and y 2 teaspoonful of tobasco sauce.

in hot water. Cut fresh bread in strips remove crusts, and toast. Place 
one or two of the fish on each strip of toast, pour some of the dressing 
from the can upon each, and arrange in a circle on a large platter. Fill 
the center of the dish with the sauce and garnish with water cress or 
olives. Make a thick Hollandaise Sauce as follows :

rounding tablespoonful of Albers flour, mix to a paste and add strained 
tomatoes. Boil the mixture for two minutes. Mix sardines and bread

Sardine Salad 

Break the fish into pieces with a silver fork. Cut four or five crisp 
lettuce leaves, some celery stalks, small pickles and stuffed olives. 
Season with paprika. Add enough mayonnaise dressing to make it 
creamy, and toss the whole lightly together with a fork. Serve in tomato 
cups, or on lettuce leaves with mayonnaise and olives. 

Sardine and Egg Salad 

Place two fish on lettuce leaves, over which slice hard-boiled egg; 
add one or two ripe olives to each dish. Then cover with mayonnaise. 
This makes an exceptionally good salad. 

Cucumber Salad 

Slice cucumbers on lettuce and on this place two fish, for each dish, 
and cover with mayonnaise. 

Sardine Salad 

(Mrs. Shaw, San Francisco) 

Split the fish lengthwise down the back and lay on crisp lettuce 
leaves ; squeeze the juice of one-fourth of a lemon on each fish. Put a 
spoonful of mayonnaise on top and garnish with cucumber pickles cut 
in small strips. 

Sardine and Tomato Salad 

Arrange crisp white lettuce leaves around platter, select good-sized 
round tomatoes and remove the pulp, after cutting a slice off the top of 
each. Mince three stalks of white celery and one small onion. Take one 
can of sardines, remove the tail and back-bone and break into pieces. 
Mix the fish, the celery and onion together and fill the tomatoes, putting 
a spoonful of mayonnaise dressing on top. 

One Minute Salad 

One can of sardines, several stalks of celery and half a pint of 
mayonnaise dressing. Remove the tail, skin and back-bone from the 
sardines and pick the fish apart, adding the celery (cut up fine) and the 
mayonnaise, mixing lightly together. Season with salt and cayenne. 
Arrange in salad dish, pour a little mayonnaise over the top, and trim 
the platter with lemon and lettuce leaves. This makes a delicious salad, 
and is very easily and quickly prepared.

Ideas in Salads 

Prepare celery stalks very carefully by removing the stringy fiber 
until entirely free from shreds. Chop quite fine, and to two cupfuls of 
celery add two cupfuls of chopped lettuce, the latter crisp and fresh as 
possible. Season with salt, pepper and thyme, vinegar, olive oil, bay 
leaf. If possible, add half a teaspoonful shoyu, or Japanese sauce, which 
greatly improves the flavor. Mix all thoroughly and then add crab, 
shrimp, sardine, spiced mackerel or halibut filling. Boiled halibut, chilled 
in salt water, makes a good combination with crab, and when broken 
into small portions and allowed to stand for an hour or so, in the same 
salt water with crab, can with difficulty be distinguished from the crab 
itself. For sardine, potato and meat salads, a tablespoonful of onion 
juice is desirable. 

Make mayonnaise dressing by using the yolks of three or four 
eggs, according to the quantity desired, and after beating add, drop by 
drop, pure olive oil, stirring constantly until the mixture begins to 
thicken. Then a larger quantity of oil may be stirred in until the mixture 
becomes of proper consistency, about like heavy cream ; do not season 
until thickened for fear of curdling. Salt very sparingly, and if desired 
sift in a little cayenne pepper, a few drops of lemon, two teaspoonfuls 
of spiced mustard vinegar from mustard pickles. 

Mayonnaise Dressing 

Put the yolk of an egg into a cup with salt-spoonful of salt, and 
beat until light, one-half teaspoonful of mustard and beat again. Then 
add olive oil, drop by drop, then a few drops of vinegar and the same of 
lemon juice. Continue this process until the egg has absorbed a little 
more than a half a teacup of oil ; finish by adding a very little cayenne 
pepper and sugar. 

French Dressing 

Mix one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, dash of white pepper, 
3 tablespoons olive oil. Stir for few minutes, then gradually add 1 table- 
spoon vinegar, stirring rapidly until mixture is slightly thickened and 
vinegar cannot be noticed. Mixture will separate in about twenty 
minutes. 

Chicken Salad 

Cut cold roast or boiled chicken in small dice, add celery cut fine, 
season with salt and pepper. Mix with French dressing and put aside 
for an hour or more. Just before serving stir in some mayonnaise 
slightly thinned with lemon juice or French dressing, arrange on lettuce 
leaves and cover with thick mayonnaise. 

Crab Salad 

One pint of crab meat, two stalks of celery, cut fine ; one hard- 
boiled egg, chopped fine, and one tomato cut into small pieces ; season 
with salt, pepper and vinegar, mix in salad bowl, garnishing it with 
crisp leaves of lettuce ; dress with mayonnaise dressing.

Lobster Salad 



Cut the lobster into small squares and season with two tablespoon- 
fuls of vinegar, 2 of oil, 1 teaspoonful of salt and pepper and let it stand 
in a cool place for an hour. When ready to serve line the salad bowl 
with crisp lettuce leaves, and after mixing the lobster thoroughly with 
mayonnaise place it on the lettuce. Serve with toasted crackers and 
cheese. 

Salmon Salad 

Remove bones and skin from salmon. Drain off liquid. Mix with 
French dressing or thin mayonnaise ; set away for awhile. Finish same 
as lobster salad. Other fish salads may be prepared in same manner. 

Tomato Salad 

Pare with sharp knife. Slice and lay in salad bowl. Make dressing 
in the following manner: Work up saltspoon of each of salt, pepper 
and mustard, two tablespoons of salad oil, adding a few drops at a time, 
and, when thoroughly mixed, whip in with an egg, beaten, four table- 
spoons vinegar; toss up with fork. 

Cold Slaw 

Chop or shred a small white cabbage. Prepare a dressing in the 
proportion of one tablespoonful of oil to four of vinegar, a teaspoonful 
mustard, salt and sugar, and pepper. Pour over the salad, adding, if 
you choose, three tablespoonfuls of minced celery; toss up well and put 
in a glass bowl. 

Potato Salad 

Four large potatoes, one-half a small onion, a little celery, chopped 
fine. If the potatoes have been boiled in their skin they are better. The 
dressing consists of one cupful of cream, one tablespoonful of corn starch, 
one egg, two tablespoonfuls of butter, three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 
one-half teaspoonful of mustard, one of sugar, salt and pepper to taste. 

Lily Salad 

Place shelled, hard-boiled eggs in cold salt water for one hour. 
Wipe dry, cut a thin slice from large end of eggs, then with sharp knife, 
directing stroke from small end downward, cut whites into sections like 
petals of water lilies. Mash yolks of eggs, mix with equal quantity of 
grated cheese, moisten with French dressing, add salt and pepper, and 
arrange on lettuce leaves to stimulate center of lily, arranging whites for 
petals. 

Celery Salad 

Two bunches celery, one tablespoon salad oil, four tablespoons 
of vinegar, one teaspoonful of sugar, pepper and salt. Wash 
and scrape celery ; lay in ice-cold water until dinner time. Then cut 
into inch lengths, add above seasoning. Stir well together with fork 
and serve in salad bowl.

M. Q. S. B. Fruit Salad 

One-half cup chopped walnuts, two apples sliced thin, one-half cup 
chopped celery ; mix with lettuce leaves and serve with following salad 
dressing: Two eggs (yolks), two tablespoons sugar, two tablespoons 
butter, four tablespoons vinegar, one tablespoon salt, one tablespoon 
mustard. Mix together. Put in bowl and place in kettle of boiling water 
and stir until thick. Add the beaten whites of eggs the last thing before 
boiling. Thin with milk when you wish to use it. This dressing will 
keep two or three days. 

Egg Salad 

Boil six eggs until the yolks are very mealy. Boil also one dozen 
medium-sized potatoes, with jackets on. Peel eggs and potatoes and 
cut in dice. Add two slices onions. Put first a layer of one, then of 
the other, until all is used. Pour over it some cream salad dressing. 

A Delicious Salad for Stuffed Peppers 

One can of sardines picked into fine pieces with a fork, two table- 
spoonsfuls of chopped pickles, two tablespoonsfuls of chopped 
olives, mayonnaise dressing and salt and pepper to taste. Remove the 
seeds, membrane and stem end from the peppers and soak in salt water. 
Mix the olives, pickles, etc., with the sardines and add enough mayon- 
naise dressing to hold it together. Then drain the peppers dry an,d fill 
with the salad. Garnish the plate with lettuce leaves and olives. 

Sardine Sandwich 
Take one can of sardines, remove the back-bone from the 
fish, add juice of one lemon, one tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce. 
Mix the above thoroughly and spread on buttered bread. Before placing 
layers of bread together, add a few slices of pickled onions. 

Sardine Paste 

Work required amount of sardines into a paste with a broad knife 
or spatula. Add to this very tiny pickled onions, the quantity depending 
upon the taste, about one-quarter as much onion as paste, is good. 
Season with Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, paprika, celery salt and 
a liberal amount of lemon juice. 

This is delicious for sandwiches, to serve on small pieces of toast 
with cocktails, or on crackers with salad. 

Sandwiches 

Take each fish, lightly scrape off skin and remove the tail, and pick 
the meat into convenient sized pieces with a fork. Put the pieces into a 
bowl of lemon juice and let stand a few minutes. Then drain and spread 
on thin slices of bread between fresh lettuce leaves. If the "Soused" 
Sardines are used, substitute mayonnaise dressing for the lemon juice. 

Sardine Sandwiches 

Very tasty sandwiches can be prepared by mincing fish with 
half the quantity of hard-boiled eggs and moistening with mayon- 
naise dressing. Place this mixture between thin slices of bread and cut 
into small squares with a sharp knife.

Sardine Loaf 

Take one can of sardines, two eggs, two tablespoonfuls melted 
butter, two cupfuls bread crumbs, pinch of cayenne pepper, and salt to 
taste. Mix all togther well, turn into a mold, cover and steam one hour. 
When cold, cut into thin slices. This is excellent for sandwiches, or 
served cold as a luncheon dish. 



Sardine Canapes 

(Mrs. Robert Yates, East Oakland) 

Take one can of sardines and chop them fine, removing the 
back-bone and tail. Toast a piece of bread. First place a strip 
of tomato, half an inch wide, across the toast. Fill in a like space 
with chopped sardines, then a strip of green pepper, after removing the 
seeds, put on toast green side up. Repeat this order until the toast is 
covered. Serve with mayonnaise at the side of the dish so as not to inter- 
fere with the appearance, which is made to look like the stripes of a flag. 

This is an excellent entree.

HOW TO SELECT POULTRY 

In selecting poultry full-grown fowls have the best flavor, provided 
they are young. The age may be determined by turning the wing 
backward — if it yields, it is tender. The same is true if the skin on 
the leg is readily broken. Older poultry makes the best soup. The 
intestines should be removed at once, but frequently in shipping they are 
left in and, hence, when removed, the fowl needs washing in several 
waters. The next to the last water should contain a half teaspoonful of 
baking soda, which sweetens and renders all more wholesome. The 
giblets are the gizzard, heart, liver and neck. 

Roast Turkey 
Carefully pluck the bird and singe off the down with lighted paper; 
break the leg bone close to the foot, hang up the bird and draw out 
the strings of the thigh. Never cut the breast; make a small slit down 
the back of the neck and take out the crop that way, then cut the 
neck bone close, and after the bird is stuffed the skin can be turned over 
the back and the crop will look full and round. Cut around the vent, 
making the hole as small as possible, and draw carefully, taking care that 
the gall bag and the intestines joining the gizzard are not broken. Open 
the gizzard, take out the contents and detach the liver from the gall 
bladder. The liver, gizzard and heart, if used in the gravy, will need 
to be boiled an hour and a half and chopped as fine as possible. Wash the 
turkey and wipe thoroughly dry, inside and out; then fill the inside with 
stuffing, and sew the skin of the neck over the back. Sew up the opening 
at the vent, then run a long skewer into the pinion and thigh through 
the body, passing it through the opposite pinion and thigh. Put a 
skewer in the small part of the leg, close on the outside and push it 
through. Pass a string over the points of the skewers and tie it securely 
at the back. 

Sprinkle well with Albers flour, cover the breast with nicely-buttered 
white paper, place on a grating in the dripping-pan and put in the oven 
to roast. Baste every fifteen minutes — a few times with butter and water, 
and then with the gravy in the dripping-pan. Do not have too hot an 
oven. A turkey weighing ten pounds will require three hours to bake. 

Roast Goose 

Get a goose that is not more than eight months old, and the fatter 
it is the more juicy the meat. The dressing should be made of three 
pints of bread crumbs, six ounces of . butter, a teaspoonful each of 
sage, black pepper and salt and chopped onions. Don't stuff very 
full, but sew very closely so that the fat will not get in. Place 
in a baking pan with a little water, and baste often with a little salt.

water and vinegar. Turn the goose frequently so that it may be evenly 
browned. Bake about 2y 2 hours. When done, take it from the pan, 
drain off the fat and add the chopped giblets, which have previously been 
boiled tender, together with the water in which they were done. Thicken 
with Albers flour and butter rubbed together; let boil, and serve. 

Baked Chicken 

Take a plump chicken, dress and lay in cold salt water for half hour, 
put in pan, stuff and sprinkle with salt and pepper; lay a few slices of fat 
pork. Cover and bake until tender, with a steady fire. Baste often. 
Turn so as to have uniform heat. 

Boiled Chicken 

Clean, wash and stuff as for roasting. Baste a floured cloth around 
each, and put into a pot with enough boiling water to cover them well. 
The hot water cooks the skin at once, and prevents the escape of the 
juices. The broth will not be so rich as if the fowls are put on in cold 
water, but this is proof that the meat will be more nutritious and better 
flavored. Stew very slowly, for the first half hour especially. Boil an 
hour or more, guiding yourself by size and toughness. Serve with egg or 
bread sauce. 

Chicken Fricassee 

Clean and disjoint chicken. Wipe each piece. Put in pot, cover with 
boiling water and simmer till tender. To the liquor add one cup or more 
hot milk, thicken with Albers flour dissolved in cold water. Season well, 
boil up for a few minutes. Serve with dumplings or biscuit. 

Fried Chicken 

A chicken for frying should be very young, but if there are doubts as 
to its age, before cutting it up parboil it for ten minutes in water that has 
been slightly salted. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and roll them in 
Albers flour. Fry in plenty of butter till done. It takes twenty min- 
utes to fry them. Put the chicken on a platter, make a gravy by turn- 
ing off some of the fat and adding a cup of milk that has been thick- 
ened with a tablespoon of Albers flour. Pour this gravy over it. Or the 
gravy can be omitted and the platter can be garnished with crisp lettuce 
leaves. 

Chicken Croquettes 

Cut up fine any kind of cold fowl, season with salt, pepper and 
butter, a little onion, stir in two fresh eggs. Make in cakes, dip in beaten 
egg, then in cracker crumbs and fry in boiling lard or lard and butter 
mixed. 

Fried Spring Chicken 

Clean and disjoint, then soak in salt water for about two hours. Put 
in frying pan equal parts of lard and butter, enough to cover chicken. 
Roll each piece in Albers flour, dip in beaten egg, then roll in cracker 
crumbs, and drop into boiling fat. Fry until browned on both sides. 
Serve on flat platter garnished with sprigs of parsley. Pour most of the 
fat from frying pan, thicken remainder with browned flour, add to it 
cup of boiling water or milk. Serve in gravy bowl.

Chicken Pie 

Disjoint fowl and simmer in boiling water until tender. Season to 
taste, and lay in deep baking dish. Mix two level tablespoonfuls corn 
starch with two level tablespoonfuls of Albers flour, add four tablespoon- 
fuls cream and three cups hot chicken stock, stir till it thickens. Pour 
over chicken and cover with crust. Sift into mixing bowl one cup Albers 
flour, one-quarter cup corn starch, two and one-half teaspoonfuls Baking 
Powder, one-quarter teaspoonful salt; rub in finely 1 tablespoonful each 
of butter. Add milk to make dough enough as soft as may be handled. 
Roll out little larger than top of dish, so that crust may be placed on 
loosely. Pierce small openings in crust, and bake until crust is well done. 
Send to table in baking dish. 

Boiled Chicken — Royal Style 

Truss chicken and tie strips of bacon over the breast. Put into a 
kettle, cover with boiling water, season with salt and pepper, cover close 
and cook slowly until tender. Remove from water, drain, rub with mix- 
ture of creamed butter and Albers flour and brown in the oven. Cool the 
liquor quickly and remove the fat, then reheat. To each pint of liqour 
allow one rounding tablespoonful corn starch. Blend the corn starch 
in a little cold water, pour into the hot liquor and boil ten minutes. 
Then add one-half cup chopped mushrooms. When gravy is perfectly 
done, remove from fire, and to one pint of gravy add yolk of one egg, 
slightly beaten. Do not cook again after the yolk has been added, or it 
may curdle. Serve gravy in boat. 

Broiled Chicken 

Singe, split down backbone, and clean. Grease broiler, place chicken 
on it, crossing legs and turning wings. Rub inside and out with soft 
butter, and season. Have fire clear and hot. Cook flesh side first, holding 
up well that it may not brown too quickly. Should cook in about twenty 
or twenty-five minutes, then turn and brown skin side. 

Chicken a la Creole 

Cut a boiled chicken into cubes of an inch. Put a tablespoonful of 
butter and one of grated onion in a frying pan, add half a cupful of tomato 
and three sweet peppers cut into strips. Add the chicken, a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and a dash of red pepper. Cover, serve hot. 

Cream Chicken 

Boil a four pound chicken and four sweetbreads and set aside to 
cool. When cold cut in small pieces. In the meantime, or when ready to 
serve, put in double boiler five tablespoonfuls Albers flour, four of butter 
and stir together, slowly add, stirring all the time, quart of cream. Sea- 
son with salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper, few drops of tabasco. 
Into this stir the chicken and sweetbreads and one can of mushrooms 
cut in half; heat thoroughly and serve in patty cases.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Chicken — Southern Style 

Wash your chicken thoroughly in soda and water. Dry and dis- 
joint. Put one and one-half cups of cold water in a porcelain pot ( Dutch 
oven preferred) : pack chicken in closely. Mince two small onions, one 
kernel garlic, little parsley and sprinkle over chicken. Cover closely and 
let simmer for three hours. One-half hour before done season with 
salt and pepper. Don't lift cover during the cooking. When done re- 
move chicken and thicken gravy with a little Albers flour. 

Wild Ducks 

Nearly all wild ducks are liable to have a fishy flavor, and when 
handled by inexperienced cooks, are sometimes uneatable from this cause. 
Before roasting them guard against this by parboiling them with a small 
carrot, peeled, put within each. This will absorb the unpleasant taste. 
An onion will have the same effect: but unless you mean to use onion in 
the stuffing, the carrot is preferable. 

Roast Wild Duck 

Parboil as above directed: throw away the carrot or onion, lay in 
fresh water one-hall" of an hour; stuff with bread crumbs, season with 
pepper, sage, salt and onion, roast until brown, basting for half the 
time with butter and water, then with drippings. Add to the gravy, 
when you have taken up the ducks, a teaspoonful of curiant jelly and a 
pinch of cayenne pepper. Thicken with browned flour and serve in a 
tureen. 

Pigeon Pie 

Clean and truss three or four pigeons, rub outside with a mix- 
ture of pepper and salt; rub inside with a bit of butter, fill 
with a bread-and-butter stuffing, or mashed potatoes; sew up the slit, 
butter the sides of a tin basin or pudding dish, and line (the sides only) 
with pie paste, rolled to quarter of an inch thickness; lay the birds in; 
for three large tame pigeons, cut quarter of a pound of sweet butter and 
put it over them, strew over a large teaspoonful of salt and a small 
teaspoonful of pepper, with finely cut parsley ; dredge a large tea- 
spoonful of Albers wheat flour over: put in water to nearly fill the pie; 
lay skewers across the top, cover with a puff paste crust ; cut a slit in the 
middle, ornament the edge with leaves, braids, or shells of paste, and put 
in a moderately hot or quick oven for one hour; when nearly done brush 
the top over with the yolk of an egg beaten with a little milk, and finish. 
The pigeons for this pie may be cut in two or more pieces, if preferred. 
Any small birds may be done in this manner. 

Roast Pigeon 

Clean and truss two young pigeons, mince the liver, and mix with 
them two ounces of finely grated bread crumbs, two ounces of fresh 
butter, finely chopped onion, a teaspoonful shredded parsley, a little salt, 
pepper, nutmeg. Fill birds with this forcemeat, fasten a slice of fat 
bacon over the breast of each, and roast. Make a sauce by mixing a 
little water with the gravy which drops from the birds, and boiling it 
with a little thickening; season it with pepper, salt and chopped parsley.

Quail on Toast 

Take five quail, but don't remove the legs, for you would lose all the 
taste of the game. Wipe them well ; string them tight, . so as to raise the 
breasts. Put a little butter on each, a little lemon juice, and inside each 
the quarter of a lemon without the peel. Then put a very thin slice of 
pork, about two inches square, around each quail, with two or three cuts 
in each side, and string it tight. Let cook on a good fire, and when they 
are nearly well done, for white meat game must be well done, cut the 
strings; dress nicely on toast and serve hot. Pour the juice on the quail 
after having taken the fat off, and put some slices of lemon around the 
dish, one for each quail. 

Rabbit Pie 

Cut a rabbit into seven pieces, soak in salted water one-half hour and 
stew until half done in enough water to cover it. Lay slices of pork in 
the bottom of a pie dish and upon these a layer of rabbit. Then follow 
slices of hard-boiled egg, peppered and buttered. Continue until the dish 
is full, the top layer being bacon. Pour in the water in which the rabbit 
was stewed, and adding a little Albers flour, cover with puff paste, cut a 
slit in the middle and bake one hour, laying paper over the top should 
it brown too fast. 

Roast Tame Duck 

Take a young farmyard duck fattened at liberty, but cleansed by 
being shut up two or three days and fed on barley meal and water. Pluck, 
singe and empty ; scald the feet, skin and twist round on the back of the 
bird; head, neck and pinions must be cut off, the latter at the first joint, 
and all skewered firmly to give the breast a nice plump appearance. For 
stuffing, one-half pound of onions, one teaspoonful of powdered sage, 
three tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, the liver of a duck par- 
boiled and minced with cayenne pepper and salt. Cut fine onions, 
throwing boiling water over them for ten minutes; drain through 
a gravy strainer, and add the bread crumbs, minced liver, sage, pepper 
and salt to taste; mix, and put inside the duck. This amount is for one 
duck ; more onion and more sage may be added, but the above is a deli- 
cate compound not likely to disagree with the stomach. Let the duck 
be hung a day or two, according to the weather, to make the flesh tender. 
Roast before a brisk, clear fire, baste often, and dredge with flour to 
make the bird look frothy. Serve with a good brown gravy in the dish, 
and apple sauce in a tureen. It takes about an hour. 

Venison Steak Broiled 

Take the leg and cut slices from it, having a quick, clear fire. Turn 
them constantly. They should be served underdone. Butter both sides 
of the steak; sprinkle salt and pepper over the venison, garnish with 
parsley and accompanying it by a jelly sauce. 

Roast Venison 

Slit the venison and lard it with pieces of pork or bacon. Place 
pieces of pork or bacon on the bottom of the pan ; slice very fine, vege- 
tables on the bacon, then place your meat on this. Season, brown well 
on the top of the stove, then turn over and brown on the other side ; 
then set in the oven and put soup stock or water in the bottom of the

pan and cover closely. Serve with gravy. The vegetables may be 
chopped fine and served with it, or not. Be careful not to let them burn. 
Baste with port wine. 

Braised Wild Duck 

Chop fine one head of celery, a bunch of parsley, one small onion, 
a piece of garlic, one cup of sage, a pinch of mace and red pepper, 
salt to suit. Beat yolk of one egg and bind stuffing, adding also 
a heaping tablespoonful of soft butter. Fill ducks, sew up opening, 
put in braising pan with cover, adding a little onion, garlic, parsley 
and celery cut fine, a bay leaf, two tablespoonfuls of cider vinegar, 
a small glass of white wine, pinch of sage, red pepper and salt, five table- 
spoonfuls of butter and a pint of good stock. Cover tightly and put in 
medium oven, cooking one hour. Mix with cold water two tablespoonfuls 
of browned flour and stir in one-quarter cupful of capers. Cover and 
cook slowly for half an hour or more ; beat to a paste with a teaspoonful 
of butter the yolks of three hard boiled eggs, a pinch of salt and red 
pepper. Form into small balls. Put the ducks on large squares of toast. 
Put egg balls around and pour sauce over all. 

Quail or Pigeon en Casserole 

Take six birds or more, eight small onions, half a small cauliflower 
divided in pieces, one large turnip cut in pieces, six small French car- 
rots, one beet cut up, six small round potatoes, one cupful green 
peas, one small bit of cabbage, salt and pepper to taste. Line a tight 
fitting kettle with thin slices of salt pork larding; tie birds 
so as to retain shape and put in the kettle ; spread the vegetables over 
the birds and cover top with thin slices of the larding. No water will 
be required. Put on the tight fitting cover and set back on the range 
or bake in a slow oven for three or four hours. Use a French earthen 
kettle if possible, as it gives the best results, and serve from it at the 
table.

Consomme or Plain Meat Stock for Soup 

Consomme or stock forms the basis of all meat soups, gravies and 
purees. The simpler it is made, the longer it keeps. It is best made of 
fresh uncooked beef and some broken bones, to which may be added the 
remnants of broken meats. In a home where meat forms part of the 
every-day diet, a good cook will seldom be without a stock-pot. 

Four povtnds of beef and broken bones, one gallon of cold water and 
two teaspoonfuls of salt. Put the meat and water on the back of the 
stove and let it slowly come to a boil, then simmer three or four hours, 
until the water is boiled away one-half; add the salt, strain and set to 
cool, in an earthenware dish well covered. When cold, take off the fat 
from the top and it is ready for use. To make soup for a family of six, 
take one-quarter of the stock, to which add one-quarter of boiling water, 
and any vegetables desired — boil three hours. Season with salt and 
pepper. 

Mixed Stock for Soups 

To six pounds of lean beef, with the bones well cracked, add six 
quarts of water. Put the beef, bones and water in a covered kettle 
on the stove to heat slowly. Let it boil gently for six hours. After it 
has boiled for six hours, strain and set aside well covered until the next 
day. Before needed, remove the fat, set the soup over the fire and put 
in a little salt, two carrots, two onions, one turnip, one head of celery. 
Stew in sufficient water to cover them. When tender, add the vegetables 
and the water in which they were cooked, to the soup. Boil slowly for 
one-half hour. Strain when done. A bay leaf added to the stock before 
cooking the second day, adds greatly to the flavor. 

Egg Balls for Soup 

Rub the volks of four hard boiled eggs with a little melted butter, 
add a little pepper and salt. Beat two eggs, add to above, with enough 
Albers flour to make them hold together. Make into balls, put in the 
soup and let boil one minute. 

Noodles for Soup 
Take two eggs, butter the size of a walnut, three tablespoonfuls sour 
cream, sufficient Albers flour to make a rather stiff dough ; knead, roll 
out very thin and cut in narrow strips ; cook half hour or less. 

Croutons 
To make croutons to serve with soups, cut bread in slices one- 
quarter of an inch thick, remove crust and cut in squares. If to be 
browned in the oven, butter lightly before cutting in squares ; put on bak- 
ing sheet, dry thoroughly and brown delicately. Should be crisp cubes 
when done. May be fried in deep fat.

Mutton Broth 

Place in a kettle three pounds of a neck of mutton from which the 
fat has been cut, and chopped into small pieces, with six pints of water. 
Boil, skim, set the pan to the rear of the stove, where it can simmer for 
an hour. Add three ounces of washed rice, with a turnip and some cel- 
ery. Simmer for two hours. Strain, free from fat and salt. 

Beef Tea 

Take two pounds of lean rump beef, remove all fat, cut into small 
pieces and place in a tightly corked bottle. Place the bottle in a deep 
saucepan of cold water, reaching two-thirds of the way to the top of the 
bottle, place over a slow fire, and keep it boiling slowly for fifteen min- 
utes, take out the bottle, pour out the liquor, and use as required. 

Bouillon 

Four pounds of beef, one knuckle of veal, one carrot, two small 
turnips, a sprig of celery, one very small red pepper pod, two small 
onions, salt and six quarts of water; boil six hours, and strain through a 
sieve. Let stand over night. Serve hot. 

Barley Broth 

Put two pounds of shin beef in one gallon of water. Add a teacup 
of pearl barley, 3 large onions and a small bunch of parsley minced, 3 
potatoes sliced, a little thyme and pepper, salt to taste. Simmer steadily 
three hours, and stir often, so that the meat will not burn. Do not let it 
boil. Always stir soup or broth with a wooden spoon. 

Turkey Soup 

Place the remains of a cold turkey and what is left of the dressing 
and gravy in a pot, and cover it with cold water. Simmer slowly four 
hours, and let stand until the next day. Take off what fat may have 
arisen, and take out with a skimmer all the bits of bones. Put the soup 
on to heat until at boiling point, then thicken slightly with flour stirred 
into a cup of cream, and season to taste. Pick off all the meat from bones, 
put it back in the soup, boil up and serve. 

Mock Turtle Soup 

Take a calf's head, a knuckle of veal, a hock of ham, six potatoes 
sliced thin, three turnips, parsley and sweet marjoram chopped fine, and 
pepper. Forced meat balls of veal and beef, half a pint of wine one 
dozen egg balls, juice of a lemon. The calf's head must have had the 
brains removed, and must have been boiled previously till the meat slips 
off the bone. The broth must be saved, so as to use in the soup. Cut 
the head in small pieces after boiling. The veal and ham also must 
have been boiled and cut up, and all simmered for a couple of hours in 
the broth made by the calf's head. Now put all together. The forced 
meat balls and egg balls should be added, and all boiled about ten 
minutes.

Vegetable Soup With Stock 

Cut three onions, three turnips, one carrot and four potatoes. Put 
them into a stew-pan with two tablespoonfuls of butter and a teaspoonful 
of powdered sugar. After it has cooked ten minutes, add two quarts of 
stock, and when it comes to a boil put aside to simmer until the vege- 
tables are tender — about one-half hour. 

Macaroni Soup — Italian Style 

Put four and one-half sticks of macaroni into a saucepan with one 
tablespoonfuls of butter and one onion. Boil until the macaroni is tender;

watching lest it break or become pulpy. Add a little grated Parmesan 
cheese and serve. 

Chicken Soup 

Time, four hours. Boil two chickens with great care, skimming 
constantly, and keeping them covered with water. When tender, take 
out the chickens and remove every bone from the meat ; put a large 
piece of butter into a frying-pan and sprinkle the chicken meat well with 
flour, lay in the hot pan ; fry a nice brown and keep it hot and dry. Take 
a pint of the chicken water and stir in two large spoonfuls of curry pow- 
der, two of butter and one of Albers flour, one teaspoonful of salt and a 
little cayenne ; mix it with the broth in the pot ; when well mixed, simmer 
five minutes, then add the browned chicken. Serve with rice. 

Chicken Broth 

Cut up a chicken into small pieces and put it in a deep earthen dish, 
adding a quart of cold water, and setting it over a boiling kettle. Cover 
closely and let it steam several hours until the meat of the chicken has 
become tender, after which stain off the broth and let it stand over 
night. Skim off the fat in the morning and pour the broth into a bowl. 
Into the dish in which the broth was made put one-third of a teacupful 
rice in a teacupful of cold water, and steam as before until the rice is 
soft; then pour in the broth and steam an hour or two longer. 

Chicken Gumbo Soup 

Fry one chicken; remove the bones; chop fine; place in kettle, with 
two quarts of boiling water, three ears of corn, six tomatoes, sliced fine, 
twenty-four pods of okra ; corn, tomatoes and okra to be fried a light

One ox tail, two pounds lean beef, four carrots, three onions, pars- 
ley, thyme, pepper, and salt to taste, four quarts cold water. Cut 
tail into joints, fry brown in good drippings. Slice onions and 2 carrots 
and fry in the same, when you have taken out all of the pieces of tail. 
When done tie the thyme and parsley in lace bag, and drop into the soup- 
pot. Put in the tail, then the beef cut into strips. Grate over them two 
whole carrots, pour over all the water, and boil slowly four hours ; strain 
and season; thicken with brown flour wet with cold water; boil fifteen 
minutes longer and serve. 

Split Pea Soup With Salt Pork 
Wash a pint of split peas and cover with tepid water, adding a 
pinch of soda; let remain over night to swell. In the morning put them 
in a kettle with three quarts of cold water, adding half a pound of lean 
salt pork ; a teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper. Cook gently for three 
hours, stirring occasionally till the peas are all dissolved, adding a little 
more boiling water to keep up the quantity as it boils away. Strain 
through a colander. Serve with small squares of toasted bread. If not 
rich enough, add a small piece of butter. 

Bean Soup 
Soak quart of white beans over night; in morning pour off water; 
add fresh, and set over fire until skins will come off; throw them into 
cold water, rub well, and skin will rise to top, where they may be re- 
moved. Boil beans till perfectly soft, allowing two quarts of water to one 
quart of beans ; mash beans, add flour and butter, which have been 
rubbed together, also salt and pepper. Cut bread into small pieces, 
toast and drop on soup when you serve.

Cream Tomato Soup 

One can of tomatoes, quart of fresh, ripe tomatoes, one-half cup 
rice, two tablespoonfuls of butter and one of Albers flour. Peel and slice 
the tomatoes and put over the fire in a granite kettle, with one quart of 
cold water. Let them heat gradually and then add an additional quart 
of cold water. When this boils, put in the rice pepper and salt to taste, 
and continue the boiling until the rice is tender; then stir in Albers Hour 
and butter, half teaspoonful baking soda and one pint of milk. Boil for 
a few minutes and serve. 

Cream of Celery Soup 

In three pints of boiling water cook three cupfuls of celery, cut fine, 
until tender enough to be rubbed through a sieve. One pint of milk 
thickened with one tablespoonful of butter and one tablespoonful of 
Albers Hour. Add celery salt, or extract, salt and pepper. Simmer ten 
minutes. A cupful of scalded cream added just before serving is an 
addition. 

Onion and Potato Soup 

Take six potatoes, one onion, three pints of water, one tablespoon- 
ful of chopped parsley, yolks of two eggs, pepper and salt. Fry 
the potatoes and onions in the butter. When slightly colored put 
them into the boiling water and the parsley. Let it boil till the potatoes 
are very soft, then press all through a colander. Return the puree to the 
fire and let it simmer for two or three minutes. When ready to serve 
have the beaten yolks ready and add a little of the soup to them, stirring 
all the time. When mixed add them slowly to the soup, with plenty of 
pepper and salt. Do not let the soup boil after adding the eggs. 

Mock Bisque Soup 

One quart of tomatoes, three pints of milk, one tablespoonful of 
Albers flour, one of butter, pepper and salt. Put the tomatoes 
on to stew, adding a teaspoonful of soda. Boil milk in a double boiler, 
keeping enough to mix with the flour. Add the cold thickened milk to 
boiling milk and cook ten minutes. Add butter, pepper and salt, and 
then the tomatoes (strained). Serve immediately. 

Potato Soup 

To one quart of water use one onion sliced fine and ten large po- 
tatoes sliced fine; boil until tender, about thirty minutes, then add one 
cupful of sweet milk, one tablespoonful of Albers flour stirred with a 
lump of butter the size of a walnut and salt and pepper to taste. Serve 
hot. 

Egg Broth 

Beat an egg up high in a broth basin. When quite frothy stir into 
it one-half pint of good mutton or veal broth, quite hot, a little salt and 
serve with toast. 

Bread Soup 

Cut bread in half-inch cubes ; melt one tablespoonful of butter in 
skillet. When hot put in cubes and stir constantly until they are 
brown. Remove cubes. Into the pan put rich milk, a pinch of salt, 
dash of pepper. When thoroughly heated pour over cubes and serve at 
once. Very appetizing.

Broiling 

The rules for roasting meat apply to broiling except that instead 
of cooking it in the oven it is to be quickly browned, first on one side 
and then on the other, over a hot fire, and removed a little from the fire 
to finish cooking. Meat an inch thick will broil in about four minutes. 
Season after it is cooked. 

Frying 

There are two methods of frying: One with very little fat in the 
pan, to practice which successfully the pan and the fat must be hot 
before the article to be fried is put into it. For instance, in frying chops, 
if the pan is hot, and only fat enough is used to keep the chops from 
sticking to it, the heat being maintained so that the chops cook quickly, 
they will be nearly as nice as if they were broiled. Frying by the other 
method consists in entirely covering the article to be cooked in smoking- 
hot fat and keeping the fat at that degree of heat until the food is brown. 
It should then be taken up with a skimmer and laid upon brown paper for 
a moment to free it from grease. 

Boiling and Stewing 

Fresh meat for boiling should be put into boiling water and boiled 
very gently about twenty minutes for each pound. A little salt, spice or 
vegetables may be boiled in the water with the meat for seasoning. A 
little vinegar put in the water with tough meat makes it tender. The 
broth of boiled meat should always be saved to use in soups, stews and 
gravies. Stewing and simmering meats means to place them near 
enough to the fire to keep the water on them bubbling moderately, 
constantly and slowly. Salt meats should be put over the fire in cold 
water, which, as soon as it boils, should be replaced by fresh cold water, 
the water to be changed until it remains fresh enough to give the meat a 
palatable flavor when done. Salted and smoked meats require about 30 
minutes very slowly boiling, from the time the water boils, to each pound. 
Vegetables and herbs may be boiled with them to flavor them. When 
they are cooked the vessel containing them should be set where they 
will keep hot without boiling until wanted, if they are to be served 
hot; if they are to be served cold, they should be allowed to cool in the 
pot liquor in which they were boiled. Very salt meats, or those much 
dried in smoking, should be soaked over night in cold water before 
boiling. 

Roasting 

Wipe the meat with damp cloth. Trim and tie into shape, if neces- 
sary. In the bottom of pan put some pieces of fat from meat. Arrange 
meat on rack in pan. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and flour. Have oven 
very hot at first ; when meat is half done reduce heat. Baste every ten 

105 



BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

or fifteen minutes. If there is danger of fat in pan being scorched, add 
a few spoons of boiling water. Allow from ten to twenty minutes per 
pound of meat, according as it is desired, rare or well done. When done 
remove to hot plate. Thicken gravy in pan with browned flour, adding 
more water as necessary and add seasoning. An onion may be laid on 
top of the roast to give it flavor, but should be removed before serving. 

In purchasing meat one should know how to select the best quality, 
and the most useful pieces. 

Beef, which stands at the head of the list, as being most generally 
used and liked, should be of a bright, clear red, and fat white. It should 
be well clothed in fat, to insure it being tender and juicy. The finest 
pieces are the sirloin and the ribs — the latter making the best roasting 
piece in the animal. 

In cooking steaks remember it is far better to turn over three or 
four times on a platter containing a little olive oil than it is to hammer 
them, to make them tender. The object is not to force out the juice, but 
to soften the fibre. 

In selecting pork, one cannot exercise too great care in examining 
it. Do not buy any that is clammy or has kernels in the fat. Remember, 
too, when the rind is hard it is old. 

Veal should be fine in grain, of a delicate pink, with plenty of kidney 
fat. It should never be eaten under two months old. 

Mutton should be firm and juicy, the flesh close-grained, the fat hard 
and white. 



To Clarify Drippings 

Drippings accumulated from different cooked meats (except mutton, 
which has a strong flavor), can be clarified by putting all into o ha^n 
and slicing into it raw potato, allowing it to boil long enorgh for the 
potato to brown, which causes all impurities to disappear. Remove from 
the fire, and when cool drain into basin and set in a cool place. 



BEEF 

Hint on Cooking Roast Beef 

For roast beef to be juicy and tender when done, it should be basted 
every few minutes so in order to save yourself this trouble, place a large 
piece of beef suet on top of the roast; have baking pan perfectly dry 
and oven very hot; place in the oven and let cook the allotted time — 
say half an hour, according to the size. You can be about your inside 
work and in the allotted time your roast is done to a beautitul brown 
and is very juicy, as it has been constantly basting itself all the while 
with the suet. Take roast out of pan, pour off drippings in a bowl and 
make a gravy on top of stove. A nice addition to this is to put half 
dozen or so peeled potatoes in the pan with roast when placing it in 
to cook, and they will be done to a nicety when the roast is. On taking 
up roast lay baked potatoes around same. This was an experiment and 
proved very successful, and saves a great deal of work and worry.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 



Ox-Tail Saute 



About 20 cents worth of ox-tail for three people. Have them dis- 
jointed in pieces about an inch long. Take one large onion and brown in 
butter, one carrot, one turnip, one small piece of garlic, enough water to 
cover and cook slowly for four hours. 

Boiled Beef With Cabbage — German Style 

Take one head of cabbage, and after removing all soiled and bruised 
leaves, cut in sections lengthwise making about eight or nine pieces, 
leaving the piece of heart attached to each piece to hold it together. 
Place in the kettle on top of beef, which has been boiling some time; 
boil together for one hour. Salt to taste and pepper. Lift out the meat, 
let the cabbage boil a few moments longer in the beef broth and send it 
to the table. 

Hot Beef Loaf 

Take three pounds of steak from the round and grind it through 
i chopper. Beat two eggs, pepper and salt, one and one-haK 
of fresh, soft bread crumbs. Press this into a shallow, oblong, 
tin loaf-shaped pan and cover with about eight slices of salt pork, 
cut thin. Add one-half cupful of water to the pan, bake an hour, 
basting often, then put in on a warm platter, removing pieces of pork 
Thicken the gravy in the pan with a little Albers flour, and one-half can- 
ful of stewed mushrooms; pour over and around the meat and serve hot. 
It is good when cold if cut in slices and served with lettuce salad. 

Creamed Dried Beef 

Pick in small pieces one-fourth of a pound of thinly-cut rather 
moist dried beef and brown in a little butter. When brown pour in it 
a coffee-cup of milk and cream. Let it come to a boil and slightly 
thicken with a little butter and Albers flour creamed together. When it 
boils, pour it over a platter of brown toast and serve it at once. 

Beef Pie With Potato Crust 

When you have used the best of a cold roast of beef take the small 
pieces, or as much as will half fill a granite baking pan ; also any gravy, 
a lump of butter, a bit of sliced onion, pepper and salt, and 
enough water to make plenty of gravy ; put over a fire, thicken by 
dredging in a tablespoonful of Albers flour ; cover it up where it may 
stew gently. Now boil a sufficient quantity of potatoes to fill up your 
baking dish, mash smooth and beat light with milk and butter and place 
in a thick layer on top of meat. Brush it over with egg, place the dish 
in an oven and let remain long enough to become brown. There should 
be a goodly quantity of gravy left with the beef, that the dish be not dry 
and tasteless. 

Rolled Steak 

Take a good rump steak, flatten and lay upon it a seasoning made of 
bread crumbs, parsley, pepper and salt, mixed with butter beaten to a 
cream. Roll up the steak, bind it evenly, and lay it in a dish with a cup 
of boiling water. Cover with another dish and bake forty minutes, bast- 

107 



BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

ing frequently. Remove the cover and let it brown before sending to 
table. Thicken the gravy with browned flour, and serve very hot. The 
twine should be cut off before sending to table. 

Pot Roast 

Put a very little drippings in an iron kettle. When hot, lay the 
beef in. Add an onion chopped and fried till brown in butter; pour in 
water to half height of meat; add salt and pepper, and cover as close as 
possible. Thicken the gravy. Simmer from two to three hours, accord- 
ing to weight. When done, take up, and pour the gravy over it and 
serve. 

Hamburg Steak 

The round of beef is usually taken for this purpose. Grind or chop 
a pound very fine, removing all the fiber or fat. Add one-half a teaspoon 
of onion juice, of salt, one-fourth of a teaspoon pepper, a little nut- 
meg and one egg- Make into small balls, and press them flat. Fry 
them in butter. Make a brown gravy of the butter used in frying. Let 
it brown, then add a little soup stock. Pour a little on each cake. 

Kidney Stew 

Take three kidneys, which must be cut lengthwise into three pieces. 
Wash these well and dry, wiping them very carefully. Warm three 
tablespoons of butter, put in kidneys before really hot, with very little 
mace and pepper, and salt to taste, one teaspoonful of chopped onion 
and a cupful of good brown gravy. Simmer all together, closely cov- 
ered, about ten minutes. Add the juice of one-half a lemon and a pinch 
of grated lemon peel ; take up the kidneys and lay upon a hot dish, with 
fried or toasted bread underneath. Thicken the gravy with browned 
flour, boil up once, pour over all and serve. 

Fried Brains 

One nice calf's brain, beaten egg, sifted cracker crumbs, butter, 
parsley. Soak the brain in cold water, then scald for just one second, dip 
it in egg and crumbs, and fry a light brown on both sides in butter. 
Garnish with parsley and serve hot. 

Irish Stew — Beef or Mutton 

Take two pounds round steak or mutton chops, six potatoes, two 
turnips, four small onions, nearly a quart of water. Place meat in stew- 
pan, add vegetables, pour in one and one-half pints of cold water; cover 
closely, let stew gently till vegetables are ready to mash and the greater 
part of the gravy is absorbed. Serve hot. 

Boiled Beef Tongue 

Clean three fresh tongues and place in a kettle with just enough 
water to cover and one cup of salt; add more water as it evaporates, so as 
to keep the tongues covered until done — when they can be easily pieced 
with a fork ; take out and if to be served at once remove the skin. If 
wanted for future use, do not peel until needed. If salt tongues are 
used, soak over night and omit the salt when boiling.

Beef's Heart Stuffed 

After washing- the heart thoroughly cut it into dice one-half inch 
long-; put into a saucepan with water enough to cover. Remove scum. 
When nearly done add a sliced onion, a stalk of celery chopped fine, 
pepper and salt and a piece of butter. Stew until the meat is very tender. 
Stir up a tablespoon ful of Albers flour with a small quantity of water 
and thicken the whole. Boil up and serve. 

Beef Stewed With Onions 

Cut two pounds of tender beef into small pieces, season with pepper 
and salt; slice one or two onions and add to it, with water enough to 
make a gravy. Let it stew slowly, till the beef is thoroughly cooked, then 
add some pieces of butter rolled in Albers flour, enough to make a rich 
gravy. Cold beef may be cooked in the same way, but the onions must 
then be cooked before adding them to the meat. Add more boiling water 
if it dries too fast. 

Beef Timbales 

Free left-over meat from fat and gristle, put through meat chopper, 
cutting finely. To one pint of meat add one teaspoon of salt, one-eighth 
teaspoon of pepper, put one-half cup of stock or water, two tablespoons 
of bread crumbs and one tablespoon of butter together in a saucepan over 
the simmering burner; when hot, add to it the meat; take from the fire 
and stir in carefully two whole eggs, well beaten. Put mixture in but- 
tered custard or timbale cups, stand in baking pan half filled with hot 
water. Bake in moderate oven fifteen to twenty minutes. Serve with 
tomato sauce. 

Fried Tripe 

Should be washed in warm water and cut into squares of three 
inches; take one egg. three tablespoonfuls of Albers flour, a little salt 
and make a thick batter by adding milk ; fry out some slices of pork, 
dip the tripe into the batter and fry a light brown. 

Tripe Stew 

Melt in stew kettle two tablespoonfuls lard, one of butter; add three 
medium-sized onions, three cloves and garlic, all chopped very fine; one 
cup chopped greens, a little parsley ; one-quart can strained tomatoes, 
a pinch of dried mushrooms, if handy; pepper and salt to suit taste; six 
large potatoes cut in quarters, lastly, three pounds plain boiled tripe 
cut in thin strips. Add boiling water if too dry. Serve hot. 

Hash 

Take cold pieces of beef that have been left over and chop them fine; 
then add cold boiled potatoes chopped fine; add pepper and salt and a 
little warm water; put all in a frying-pan and cook slowly for about

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

put all this in over the beef, keep the pot well covered ; fill up with more 
hot water if it boils down, and let it boil three hours ; then burn a table- 
spoonful of Albers flour, with some butter, a nice brown, thin with the 
gravy and let it boil up once more with the meat ; then put the beef in 
a deep dish and strain the gravy over it; add more vinegar to taste; serve 
with fried potatoes and red cabbage. 

Braised Beef 

Wipe and trim six pounds round or rump of beef without bone. 
Sear brown on all sides in very hot frying-pan over hot fire. In braising 
pan or iron kettle put layers of sliced onions, turnips and carrots, sweet 
herbs, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper; on 
this lay meat, add pint boiling water (or water and stewed tomatoes). 
Cover closely and cook four hours in moderate oven. If water evapor- 
ates rapidly, add more. Put meat on hot platter. Strain, thicken and 
season gravy. The vegetables may be served separately if desired. 

Corned Beef 

Should be cooked in plenty of cold water brought slowly to a boil ; if 
very salt, the meat should be soaked over night; but if young and not 
too strongly brined this will not be necessary. It should be cooked long 
enough to make tender, so that in a brisket or plate piece the bones may 
be readily removed. Preserve the liquor in the pot, and if any of the 
meat remains after the first meal, return it and let it stand over night in 
the liquor, so that it may absorb it. If no meat remains to be returned to 
the liquor, the latter will make a good soup for next day's dinner, if the 
beef was not too salt. 

Beef Steak Pie— French Style 

Take a nice piece of beef, rump or sirloin, cut in small slices; slice 
also a little raw ham ; put both in a frying-pan, with some butter and 
small quantity chopped onions ; let them simmer together a short time 
on the fire or in the oven ; add a little Albers flour and enough stock to 
make sauce ; salt, pepper, chopped parsley and Worcestershire sauce ; 
add some sliced potatoes, and cook together twenty minutes; put this 
into a pie-dish, with a few slices of hard-boiled eggs on top, and cover 
with a layer of common paste. Bake from fifteen to twenty minutes in a 
well-heated oven. All dark-meat pie can be treated precisely in the same 
way. 

Spiced Beef 

Four pounds of round of beef chopped fine; take from it all fat; 
add to it 3 dozen small crackers rolled fine, 4 eggs, cup of milk, tablespoon 
mace, 2 black pepper, 1 melted butter ; mix well, put in pan that it will 
just fill, packing it well ; baste with butter and water, and bake two hours 
in a slow oven. 

Roast Beef With Yorkshire Pudding 
Have your meat ready for roasting on Saturday, always. Roast upon 
a grating of several clean sticks (not pine) laid over the dripping pan. 
Dash a cup of boiling water over the beef when it goes into the oven ; 
baste often, and see that the fat does not scorch. About three-quarters 
of an hour before it is done, mix the pudding. 

112 



BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Yorkshire Pudding 

One pint of milk, four eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately, two 
cups of Albers flour (prepared flour is best), one teaspoonful of salt. 
Use less Albers flour if the batter grows too stiff. Mix quickly; pour off 
the fat from the top of the gravy in the dripping pan, leaving just enough 
to prevent pudding from sticking to the bottom. Pour in the batter 
and continue to roast the beef, letting the drippings fall upon the pudding 
below. The oven should be brisk by this time. Baste the meat with the 
gravy you have taken out to make room for the batter. In serving, cut 
the pudding into squares and lay about the meat in the dish. 

MUTTON AND LAMB 
Roast Mutton 

Get a leg of eight pounds, which has hung about a week, weather 
allowing. During hot weather this joint get quickly tainted. Rub it 
lightly with salt and put it at once before a brisk, sharp fire. Place it 
close to the fire for five minutes, then place it in the oven and let it 
roast slowly until done. Baste continually with good dripping until that 
from the joint begins to flow. When within twenty minutes of being 
done, sprinkle it witlv Albers flour, and baste with butter or dripping; 
and when the froth rises, serve on a hot dish. Make a gravy, throw off 
the fat, when any gravy, if the dripping pan has been floured, will adhere 
to it. Add a little stock and a little boiling water, pepper and salt. Pour 
the gravy around the meat, not over it. 

Boiled Mutton or Lamb 

Trim and wipe the meat. Have ready kettle of rapidly boiling salted 
water. Immerse meat, boil hard five minutes, then reduce to gentle sim- 
mer. Allow fifteen minutes per pound. Lamb should always be well 
done ; mutton may be rare. A little rice may be added to water to keep 
meat white. 

Mutton Pie 

A very good family pie is made with the remains of a cold leg, loin 
or any other joint of mutton from which neat slices of rather lean meat 
can be cut. These should be put with a good seasoning, in alternate 
layers with thin-sliced potatoes, into a pie-dish, commencing at the bot- 
tom with some of the meat, and finishing at the top with potatoes. 
Parsley, herbs or onion, a little mace and white pepper and salt at discre- 
tion. A cupful of good gravy from the meat be poured into the, pie 
before the crust is put on. Suet is generally used for the crust. 

Mutton Patties 

Mutton patties are made with cooked meat, which is minced, then 
hashed in gravy, season with pepper and salt, and catsup. The mince 
should not boil, hot and thickened. Patty pans, lined with half paste 
and filled with meat, will require a very short time to bake. Cover with 
the paste, and put them into a qu'ck oven for fifteen minutes.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Breaded Mutton 

Sew the mutton up in a thin cloth, lay it in a sauce-pan, nearly cover 
it with cold water and stew gently, allowing ten minutes to each pound. 
Take it out, unwrap and lay it in a baking dish, brush over with warm 
drippings, dredge with flour and set in the oven for one-half of an hour, 
basting freely with its own broth. A few minutes before taking it up 
strew thickly with crumbs, fine and dry, bits of butter over it, and brown. 

Mutton Haricot 
Cut two pounds breast mutton in pieces, roll in Albers flour, brown 
in drippings. Transfer to stewpan, add two sliced onions, cover with 
boiling water and simmer until very tender. Add one pint parboiled po- 
tatoes or one pint boiled macaroni and one pint shelled peas; season, 
simmer till vegetables are done. 

Lamb Sweetbreads 
Two or three sweetbreads, one-half pint of veal stock, white pep- 
per and salt to taste, small bunch of green onions, mace, thickening of 
butter and flour, two eggs, nearly one pint of cream, one teaspoonful of 
minced parsley, a very little grated nutmeg. 

Mode — Soak the sweetbreads in hike-warm water, and put them into 
a saucepan with sufficient boiling water to cover them, and let them 
simmer for ten minutes ; then take them out and put them into cold water. 
Now lard them, lay them in a stewpan, add the stock, seasoning, onions, 
mace and a thickening of butter and Albers flour, stew gently for one- 
quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. Beat up the eggs with the cream, 
to which add the minced parsley and very little grated nutmeg. Put this 
to the other ingredients; stir it well till quite hot, but do not let it boil 
after the cream is added or it will curdle. Have ready some asparagus 
tops, boiled; add these to the sweetbreads and serve. 

Lamb or Mutton Stew 
Part of a breast of mutton or lamb; cut in bits as many potatoes, 
pepper and salt to taste, two onions, a bunch of parsley, a bunch of sweet 
herbs. Stew together in water to cover two hours, gently. Put in a 
teacupful of tomato catsup and boil up again. Serve hot. 

Broiled Mutton Chops 
Select one dozen chops cut from the loin ; trim, season with salt and 
pepper; dip in melted butter and broil over a clear fire, nearly ten minutes, 
turning frequently. Lay on warm platter and garnish with parsley. 

Irish Stew 
Cut two pounds of chops from the best end of a neck of mutton, and 
pare away all the fat. A portion of the breast may be cut into squares 
and used, but a neck, of mutton is the best joint for the purpose. Take as 
many potatoes as will amount, after paring, to twice the weight of the 
meat. Slice with 8 large onions. Put layer of potatoes and onions at the 
bottom of stewpan. Place the meat on this and season it plentifully with 
pepper, and lightly with salt. Pack closely and cover the meat with an- 
other layer of potato and onion. Pour in as much water or stock as will 
moisten the topmost layer, cover the stewpan tightly, and let its con- 
tents simmer gently for three hours. Don't remove lid, as this will let 
out the flavor.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Sweetbread Croquettes 

Wash and parboil one pair of sweetbreads, then put into cold water; 
remove outside skin and all membrane ; then with silver knife chop in 
small pieces and measure. There should be one-half of a pint of chopped 
meat. Put one-quarter pint of cream into a sauce-pan ; rub together one 
level teaspoonful of butter, a heaping teaspoonful of Albers flour ; stir 
into the hot cream until you have a smooth paste ; add the yolk of one 
egg and the sweetbread ; mix and cook one minute, take from the fire 
and if desired, add one dozen mushrooms chopped fine ; if fresh they 
must be cooked before chopping; add one tablespoonful of salt, one salt- 
spoonful of pepper, one teaspoonful of finely-chopped parsley, 10 drops 
of onion juice; mix well. When cool form into croquettes; roll into 
beaten eggs and bread crumbs, fry in hot lard. 

Knuckle of Veal 

Cut in small thick slices, season with salt and pepper, flour lightly 
and fry it brown, lay in saucepan and cover with water. Skim well and 
season with thyme and parsley and a little mace. Simmer for two hours 
and a half, then thicken the gravy with a little Albers Hour and add a 
piece of butter, and salt to taste. 

Veal Pie 

Use the neck or any part of the veal which you prefer. Cook it by 
boiling an hour, then place the meat in a very deep dish, and when you 
lay on the upper crust wet the edge of the under crust all around and 
flour it ; then lay on the upper crust and press your hand upon the edge, 
so that the Albers flour and water will make the crusts adhere and pre- 
vent the gravy from escaping. Stick the top several times with a large 
fork. If you have pieces of crust left, cut them into leaves and orna- 
ment the pie. Bake for about one-half hour. 

Veal Cutlets With Vermicelli — German Style 
Remove all the fat, but not the small rib of the cutlet, season and 
turn in egg and crumbs, or dip in melted butter, then in cheese mixed 
with an equal quantity of crumbs ; let this absorb, then dip in the egg 
and again in the cheese mixture. Stand aside for two hours, then fry 
in plenty of butter the same as doughnuts. Meanwhile boil some vermi- 
celli in salt water until well done, then drain and mix with tomato sauce, 
arrange the vermicelli in the center of a chop platter and place the cut- 
lets around them Serve hot. 

Veal Croquettes 
One pint minced cooked veal, half a pint of milk, two tablespoonfuls 
of Albers flour, three tablespoonfuls of butter, one level tablespoonful 
of salt, one-third teaspoonful of pepper, one-half teaspoonful onion 
juice, one teaspoonful of lemon juice. Put the milk in a saucepan. Beat 
the butter and Albers flour together and stir in the milk as soon as it 
boils. When the sauce is smooth and thick add the seasoned meat and 
cook for three minutes. Beat three eggs together and pour half of them 
over the cooking meat. Take from the fire at once and stir well. Pour 
into a platter and set away to chill. When chilled make into cylindrical 
shapes- and roll gently on board sprinkled with dried bread crumbs. Drop 
the croquettes in the beaten eggs and then in bread crumbs and fry.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 



Roast Loin of Veal 



Leave in the kidney, around which put considerable salt. Make a 
dressing the same as for fowls; unroll the loin, put the stuffing well 
around the kidney, fold and secure with several coils of white cotton 
twine wound around in all directions ; place in a dripping pan, with the 
thick side down, and put in a rather hot oven, letting it cool down to 
moderate; in one-half hour add a little hot water to the pan, and baste 
often ; after half an hour turn over the roast and when done sprinkle 
lightly with Albers flour and baste with melted butter. Before serving 
carefully remove the twine. A roast of four or five pounds will bake in 
about two hours. For a gravy, skim off some of the fat if there it too 
much in the drippings; dredge in Albers flour; stir until brown, add hot 
water if necessary; boil a few minutes, stir in sweet herbs as fancied and 
put in a gravy boat. Serve with green peas and lemon jelly. 

Entree of Veal 

Take a piece of butter the size of an egg, three pounds of raw 
veal, one teaspoonful salt, one of pepper and two eggs. Chop fine and 
mix together, adding two tablespoonfuls of water. Mold this into a loaf, 
then roll into two tablespoonfuls of pounded crackers and bake two 
hours. When cold, slice. 

Fried Sweetbreads 

For every mode of dressing they should be prepared by half boiling, 
and then putting them in cold water; this makes them whiter and firmer. 
Dip in beaten egg and then in bread crumbs, pepper and salt and fry in 
lard. Serve with peas or tomatoes. 

Veal Cutlets, Breaded 

Trim and flatten the cutlets, add pepper and salt, and roll in beaten 
egg, then in cracker crumbs. Fry in good dripping, turn when the lower 
side is brown. Drain off the fat, squeeze a little lemon juice upon each, 
and serve in a hot flat dish. 

Calves Liver and Bacon 

Cut liver in one-half inch slices, soak in cold water twenty minutes, 
drain, dry and roll in Albers flour. Have pan very hot. Put in bacon 
thinly sliced, turn until brown ; put on hot platter. Fry liver quickly 
in the hot fat, turning very often. When done, pour off all but one or 
two tablespoons fat. dredge in Albers flour until it is absorbed, and stir 
till brown. Add hot water gradually to make smooth gravy, season and 
boil one minute. Serve separately. 

Veal Loaf 

Three pounds chopped veal, one pound fresh pork chopped fine, 
three well beaten eggs, butter size of an egg, one pint of bread crumbs, 
1 tablespoon of salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, one-half teaspoon each of 
thyme and sage. Make into loaf, take piece of white muslin and wrap 
securely, also the ends. Place in a baking pan with very little water. 
Baste often. Turn so as to brown both sides. Leave in cloth until cold.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

PORK 

To Roast a Leg of Pork 

Choose a small leg of fine young pork ; cut a slit in the knuckle with 
a sharp knife, and fill the space with sage and onions, chopped, and a 
little pepper and salt. When one-half done, score the skin in slices, 
but do not cut deeper than the outer rind. Apple sauce should be served 
with it. 

Salt Pork, Cream Gravy, Southern Style 

Cut sweet cured salt pork into half-inch slices, put into saucepan, 
cover with cold water and bring to boiling point. Drain oft water, add 
cold water, stand a few minutes, roll in Albers flour, two parts, corn 
starch, one part, mixed and seasoned with white pepper. Have one 
tablespoonful of hot bacon fat in the frying pan to prevent pork from 
sticking. Pour off fat as it melts while frying, brown and fry until re- 
duced one-half. For one and one-half cups cream gravy allow three 
spoonfuls melted fat, add two level tablespoonfuls corn starch. Cook 
three minutes in the hot fat without browning, then add one and one- 
half cups milk, one-quarter teaspoonful salt, and cook until smoothly 
thickened. Serve for breakfast with baked potatoes and hot biscuit. 

Roast Spare-Rib 

Trim the ragged ends of a spare-rib neatly, crack the ribs across 
the middle, rub with salt and sprinkle with pepper. Fold over, stuff with 
a turkey dressing, sew up tightly, place in dripping pan with a pint of 
water, baste often, turning it once or twice so as to bake both sides a 
rich brown. 

Saddle of Pork, Roasted 

Have your butcher cut a saddle of pork as he would a saddle of 
mutton. Strip off the skin, trim the joint neatly and cover the fat with 
buttered paper. Have a clear fire and baste often. One-half of an hour 
before it is taken up remove the paper, dredge the meat lightly with 
Albers flour, and baste until it is brightly browned. Serve brown gravy 
and apple sauce or tomato sauce with it. If liked, the skin can be left on 
and it will then require to be scored lengthwise, the same way in which 
the saddle is carved. 

Fried Pork Chops 

Cut the chops about half an inch thick and trim them neatly; put a 
frying-pan on the fire, with a bit of butter; as soon as it is hot, put in 
your chops, turning them often till brown all over; a few minutes before 
they are done season with powdered sage, pepper and salt. 

Pork Tenderloin 

Tenderloins should be sliced crosswise and flattened, then fried or 
broiled, season with salt and pepper. When done, move to platter and 
make gravy by sprinkling a little Albers flour into the hot fat; if not 
enough add a little butter, stir until browned and add a little milk or 
cream, stir until it boils and pour over the dish. 

117 



BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 



Fried Salt Pork 



Take thin slices of pickled pork ; fry lightly. Then mix a batter of 
egg' and Albers flour and milk and place the pork in this till it has be- 
come completely covered and fry to a light brown. 

Salt Pork 

Cut as many slices as needed ; if for breakfast, the night previously, 
and soak over night in a pint of milk and water, about one-half milk, 
either skimmed milk, sonr milk or buttermilk ; rinse till the water is 
clear, and roll in corn meal and fry. It is as nice as fresh pork. 

Fried Ham and Eggs 

Cut slices of ham very thin, trim off the rind, put into a frying-pan, 
cooking until crisp. Place on a hot platter; pour off some of the grease, 
then carefully break the eggs separately in a small plate so that no bad be 
cooked, and slip each egg gently into a frying-pan. Do not turn them 
while frying, but gently tip the pan so that the hot lard will be over them 
all. Cook about three minutes ; the white must retain its transparency so 
that the yolk can be seen through it. Lay a fried egg upon each side of 
ham and serve hot. 

To Boil a Ham 

Well soak the ham in a large quantity of water for twenty-four 
hours, then trim and scrape it very clean, put it into a large pot with 
more than sufficient water to cover it ; put in a blade of mace, a few 
cloves, a sprig of thyme and two bay leaves. Boil it for four or five hours, 
according to its weight; and when done, let it become cold in the liquor 
in which it was boiled. Then remove the rind carefully, without injuring 
the fat, press a cloth over it to absorb as much of the grease as possible, 
and shake some bread raspings over the fat. Serve cold, garnished with 
parsley. 

Roast Pig 

Select a pig about six weeks old, wash it thoroughly inside and out- 
side ; wipe dry with a towel, salt inside and stuff it with a rich fowl 
dressing, making it plump. Sew it up, place it in the dripping pan, salt 
and pepper the outside. Pour a little water into the dripping pan, baste 
with butter and water a few times as the pig warms, afterward with 
gravy form the dripping pan. Roast from two to three hours. Make 
the gravy by skimming off most of the grease ; stir in the pan a good 
tablespoonful of Albers flour, turn in the water to make it the right thick- 
ness, season and let all boil up once. Strain and turn into the gravy 
dish. Place the pig upon a large platter surrounded with parsley. Send 
to the table hot. In carving, cut off the head first; split the back, take 
off the hams and shoulders and separate the ribs. 

Baked Ham 

Put a medium-sized ham in a pot and cover with sweet cider. Let 
it simmer gently for three and one-half hours. Skim frequently to re- 
move the grease as it rises. When tender take out and remove the rind ; 
cut the fat on top into diamonds and in each diamond stick a clove ; then 
rub over the top of the ham one-half of a cupful of maple syrup, place in 
the oven and bake slowly for forty-five minutes. 

118 



BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 



Tortilla of Ham 



One-half of a pound of ham is to be cooked, then chopped and put 
with one tablespoonful of butter into a pan. Beat three eggs well and 
season. Pour them into the ham and stir for a minute, then let set, being 
careful that it does not adhere to the pan. When it is a little brown, turn 
and brown the other side. 

Pork Chops With Tomato Gravy 

Trim off skin and fat; rub the chops over with a mixture of pow- 
dered sage and onion ; put small pieces butter into frying-pan ; put in the 
chops and cook slowly, as they should be well done. Place chops on 
hot dish ; add a little hot water to gravy in pan, one large spoon butter 
rolled in Albers flour, pepper, salt and sugar, and one-half cup juice 
drained from can tomatoes. Stew five minutes and pour over the chops 
and serve. 

Pork and Beans 

Soak one quart white beans over night in cold water. Drain, add 
fresh w r ater and simmer till tender. Put in baking pan and place in cen- 
ter one-half pound fat salt pork, parboiled. Mix one teaspoon salt, one- 
half teaspoon mustard and one tablespoon molasses ; add this to the 
beans, with enough boiling water to cover. Bake eight hours in a mod- 
erate oven, adding more water as necessary. 

SAUCES FOR MEATS, FISH, POULTRY OR VEGETABLES 
To Make Drawn Butter 

Put half a pint of milk in a perfectly clean stewpan, and set it over 
a moderate fire: put into a pint bowl a heaping tablespoonful of Albers 
wheat flour, quarter of a pound of sweet butter, and a teaspoonful of 
salt ; work these well together with the back of a spoon, then pour into 
it, stirring it all the time, half a pint of boiling water; when it is smooth, 
stir it into the boiling milk, let it simmer for five minutes or more and 
it is done. 

Drawn butter made after this recipe will be found to be most ex- 
cellent; it may be made less rich by using less butter. 

Parsley Sauce 

Make a drawn butter as directed, dip a bunch of parsley into boiling 
water, then cut it fine and stir it into the drawn butter a few minutes 
before taking it up. 

Egg Sauce 

Make a drawn butter ; chop two hard boiled eggs quite fine, the white 
and yolk separately, and stir it into the sauce before serving. This is 
used for boiled fish or vegetables. 

Onion Sauce 

Peel some nice white onions, and boil them tender; press the water 
from them ; chop them fine and put them to a half pint of hot milk ; add 
a bit of butter and a teaspoonful of salt and pepper to taste. Serve with 
boiled veal or poultry or mutton.

Bread Sauce 

One pint of milk, one cup of bread crumbs, onion, sliced, pinch 
of mace and pepper and salt to taste ; three tablespoonfuls butter. 
Simmer the sliced onion in the milk until tender; strain the milk and 
pour over the bread crumbs, which should be put into a saucepan. Cover 
and soak half an hour; beat smooth with an egg-whip, add the seasoning 
and butter; stir in well, boil up once and serve in a tureen. If it is too 
thick, add boiling water and more butter. 

This sauce is for roast poultry. Some people add some of the 
gravy from the dripping pan, first straining it and beating it well in 
with the sauce.

This is a good dressing for fish cutlets and fish fried in deep fat. 
Melt one tablespoonful butter in a saucepan, add one tablespoonful corn 
starch and one tablespoonful Albers flour; mix, add three-quarters cup 
vinegar and quarter cup water. Cook till smooth, then add one teaspoon- 
ful salt, one teaspoonful sugar and one-quarter teaspoonful celery salt. 
Pour by tablespoonfuls the cooked mixture into four beaten yolks of eggs, 
return to boiler and stand over hot water. Do not cook, but beat till 
eggs are thickened, remove from water, add four tablespoonfuls olive 
oil, mix well and set to cool. Have ready one cup chopped fresh cucum- 
bers that have been soaked in ice cold unsalted water till crisp, drained 
dry as possible, and two small sweet midget pickles chopped finely. 
When ready to serve add little salt and paprika to drained cucumber 
and drain again. When dry, add cucumbers, fresh and pickled, to dress- 
ing. Beat well into dressing and serve cold with fish croquettes or 
similarly cooked fish dishes. May be served with fried oysters, if finely- 
cut crisp cabbage is substituted for the cucumbers. 

Brown Sauce 

In a saucepan, brown one tablespoon butter until dark, but not 
burned. Add one tablespoonful Albers flour, stir until smooth and 
gradually one cup good stock or hot water and stir until smooth and 
thick. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer five minutes.

Simmer together for twenty minutes one pint tomatoes, with one 
bay leaf and slice of onion, strain pulp and add few grains soda. Melt 
two tablespoonfuls butter, add one and one-half tablespoonfuls corn 
starch, mix and gradually add one and one-half cups tomato pulp, salt and 
pepper to taste, cook well, stirring constantly.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Caper Sauce 

Two tablespoons butter, one tablespoon Albers flour ; mix well ; pour 
on boiling water till it thickens; and one hard-boiled egg, chopped fine, 
and two tablespoons of capers. 

Giblet Sauce 

Take the liver, heart, gizzard and neck of a chicken, wash and boil 
in salted water. Let boil till tender. Take them out with a skimmer 
and chop into coarse pieces. Put them back, add a little butter and 
thicken to a cream. Pepper and salt, boil a few minutes and serve. 

Sauce Robert 

One cup brown sauce made with stock, one teaspoon sugar, one tea- 
spoon mustard, one tablespoon vinegar. Simmer five minutes. 

Tomato Mustard 

One peck of ripe tomatoes, boiled with two onions, six red peppers, 
four cloves of garlic, for one hour; then add a half pint or half pound 
salt, three tablespoons black pepper, half ounce each ginger, allspice, 
mace, cloves ; boil again for one hour longer, and when cold add one 
pint of vinegar and a quarter pound of mustard ; and if you like it very 
hot, a tablespoonful of cayenne. 

Mint Sauce 

Mix one tablespoon of white sugar to a half teacup of good vinegar; 
add the mint and let it infuse for half an hour in a cool place before send- 
ing to the table. Serve with roast lamb or mutton. 

Celery Sauce 

Mix two tablespoons Albers flour with half teacup butter, have ready 
a pint of boiling milk ; stir the flour and butter into the milk ; take three 
heads of celery, cut into small bits and boil for a few minutes in water, 
which strain off; put the celery into the melted butter and keep stirred 
over the fire for five or ten minutes. This is very nice with boiled fowl 
or turkey. 

Currant Jelly Sauce 

Melt one-half glass currant jelly over slow fire. Add one cup hot 
brown sauce ; stir well and simmer one minute. 

Cream or White Sauce 

One cupful milk, a teaspoonful Albers flour and a tablespoonful of 
butter, salt and pepper. Heat butter in pan when hot, but not brown, add 
the flour. Stir until smooth ; gradually add the milk. Let it boil up 
once. Season with salt and pepper and serve. This is nice to cut cold 
potatoes into and let them heat through. They are then creamed pota- 
toes. It also answers as a sauce for other vegetables, omelets, fish and 
sweetbreads, or, indeed, for anything that requires a white sauce. If 
you have plenty of cream, use it, and omit the butter.

Mayonnaise Sauce 

Mix in a bowl one even teaspoon mustard, one of salt and one and 
a half of vinegar; beat in the yolk of a raw egg, then add very gradually 
half a pint of pure olive oil (or melted butter), beating briskly all the 
time. The mixture will become a very thick batter. Flavor with vin- 
egar or fresh lemon juice. Closely covered, it will keep for weeks in a 
cool place, and is delicious. 

Oyster Sauce 

Take a pint of oysters, save a little of the liquor; put with remain- 
ing liquor and some mace and nutmeg, into a covered saucepan and 
simmer them on hot coals for about ten minutes ; then drain them. Oys- 
ters for sauce should be large. Having prepared in a saucepan some 
drawn or melted butter (mixed with oyster liquid instead of water), 
pour it into a sauceboat, add the oysters to it and serve it up with 
boiled poultry or with boiled fresh fish. Celery first boiled and then 
chopped, is an improvement to oyster sauce. 

Lobster Sauce 

Put the coral and spawn of a boiled lobster into a mortar with a 
tablespoonful of butter, pound it to a smooth mass, then rub it through 
a sieve ; melt nearly a quarter of a pound of sweet butter, with a wine- 
glass of water or vinegar, add a teaspoonful of mustard, stir in the coral 
and spawn and a little salt and pepper, stir it until it is smooth and 
serve. Some of the meat of the lobster may be chopped fine and stirred 
into it. 

Olive Sauce 

One cup brown sauce, twenty-four stoned olives, one tablespoon 
sherry. Simmer olives in hot water ten minutes. Drain, add sauce, sim- 
mer five minutes ; take from fire and add sherry. 

Spanish Sauce 

Boil one quart strong stock down one-half. Make as directed for 
brown sauce, and add two tablespoons sherry. 

Mustard Sauce 

Stir three tablespoonfuls of mixed mustard and a speck of cayenne 
into a butter sauce. 

Curry Sauce 

One tablespoonful of butter, one of Albers flour, one tablespoonful 
of curry powder, one large slice of lemon, one large cupful of stock, salt 
and pepper to taste. Cut and fry onion brown in butter; add Albers 
flour, and curry powder; stir one minute, add stock and season with salt 
and pepper; simmer five minutes, then strain and serve. 

Cranberry Sauce 
Wash and pick one quart of cranberries and put them in a saucepan 
with water to cover, let them stew slowly, stirring often till they are 
reduced to a pulp ; then sweeten to taste and turn in a deep dish or 
mould. They may be strained and cleared as jelly is prepared.

water, cover them, and set them over the fire; when tender, mash them 
smooth, and serve with roasted pork, goose or duck. 

Horseradish Sauce 

A good-sized stick of horseradish is required, which should be grated 
into a bowl and a teaspoonful of mustard, a little salt, one-quarter of a 
pint of cream and vinegar to taste added. Stir all well together. 

Chili Sauce 

Two quarts of ripe tomatoes, four large onions, four chili peppers; 
chop fine, then add four cups vinegar, three tablespoonfuls brown. sugar, 
two of salt, two teaspoonfuls each of cloves, cinnamon, ginger, allspice 
and nutmeg; boil all thoroughly together and bottle after straining

boiling water. Fry one minced onion and one chopped carrot in a little 
butter or dripping until lightly browned ; pour the liquid over them, let 
all boil together for ten minutes and add a dessert-spoonful of mush- 
room catsup, skim, strain, and it is ready for the table. 

124 



Escalloped Eggs 

Boil six eggs twenty minutes, make one pint of white sauce by 
melting two tablespoons of butter and adding two tablespoons of Albers 
flour to the melted butter and slowly add one pint of milk. Add tea- 
spoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper. Cook until quite thick. 
Moisten one cup of cracker crumbs with one-quarter cup melted butter. 
Chop fine one cup of cold boiled ham, separate the cooked yolks and 
whites of eggs, chop the whites fine. Put a layer of buttered crumbs in 
a buttered baking dish, add a layer of whites, next a layer of white 
sauce, then some of the chopped meat, then yolks rubbed through a fine 
sieve. Repeat until all the ingredients have been used, having a layer 
of butter crumbs on top. Brown in a hot oven. Very good without 
chopped ham. 

Rum Omelet 

First make a very soft sweet omelet; when on the dish pour over 
some rum and sugar, send it to the table and then set it on fire, basting 
frequently to keep it alight. 

Baked Eggs 

Place a very little beef drippings in the pan, get it quite hot; break 
in the egg as if for frying. Salt them and set in hot oven a few minutes, 
when they are done. Eat with buttered toast. 

Poached Eggs 

Break the eggs into a warm, buttered pan, being careful to avoid 
breaking the yolks; add a little salt and butter or cream; as soon as 
they begin to whiten stir carefully until they are cooked as desired. 

Scrambled Eggs 

Two eggs, two tablespoonfuls of milk, half a teaspoonful of salt, half 
a teaspoonful of butter; beat the eggs and add the salt and milk; put 
the butter in a small saucepan, and when it melts add the eggs; stir over 
the fire until the mixture thickens, being careful not to let it cook hard; 
about two minutes will cook it. The eggs, when done, should be soft 
and creamy. Serve immediately. 

Dropped Eggs 

Have a quart of boiling water and one tablespoonful of salt in a 
frying-pan. Break the eggs one by one into a saucer and slide carefully 
into the salted water; cook until the white is firm, and lift out with a 
griddle cake turner and place on toasted bread. Serve immediately.

Omelet Souffle 

Take three eggs, two ounces of butter, one dessert spoonful of 
chopped parsley, one salt spoonful of chopped onions, one pinch of dried 
herbs. Beat the whites of the eggs to a very stiff froth ; mix the yolks 
with the parsley and a little salt and pepper. Stir the herbs gently into 
them and continue as in a plain omelet. Fold the omelet and serve im- 
mediately. 

Curried Eggs 

Slice two onions and fry in butter, add a tablespoon curry powder 
and one pint good broth or stock, stew till onions are quite tender, add 
a cup of cream thickened with arrowroot or rice flour, simmer a few 
moments, then add eight or ten hard-boiled eggs, cut in slices and beat 
them well, but do not boil. 

Eggs a-la-mode 

Remove skin from ten tomatoes, medium size, cut in a saucepan, add 
butter, pepper and salt ; when sufficiently boiled, beat up five or six eggs, 
and just before you serve turn them into the saucepan with the tomatoes, 
and stir them one way for two minutes, allowing them time to be well 
cooked. 

Omelet 

Six eggs, whites and yolks, beaten separately ; half pint of milk, six 
teaspoons corn starch, one teaspoon baking powder, and a little salt; add 
the whites, beaten to a stiff froth, last; cook in a little butter. 

Spanish Omelet 

Mince very fine enough ham, fat as well as lean, as will fill a small 
teacup and add two finely-chopped small onions, such as are used for 
pickling. Beat six eggs, stir the ham into them and fry the omelet the 
usual way, folding it over when done. 

Omelet au Natural 

Break eight or ten eggs into a basin ; add a little salt and pep- 
per, with a tablespoonful of water; beat the whole well with a 
spoon or whisk. In the meantime put some fresh butter into an 
omelet pan, and when it is nearly hot, put in an omelet; while it is 
frying, with a skimmer spoon raise the edge from the pan that it may be 
properly done. When the eggs are set and one side is a fine brown, 
double it half over and serve hot. These omelets should be put quite 
thin in the pan; the butter required for each will be about the size of a 
small egg. 

Eggs and Bacon 

Cut eight slices of bacon very thin, and fry until crisp; take them 
out and keep hot in the oven. Break four eggs separately into the boiling 
fat and fry until brown. Serve with the eggs laid over the bacon, and 
small fried pieces of bread placed round. Hash may be used instead of 
bacon.

Egg Timbales 

Beat six eggs; add to them one and one-half cups of warm 
milk, one-half tablespoonful of salt, dash of pepper, one scant teaspoon of 
onion juice and one tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley. Thickly 
butter the sides and bottoms of a number of timbale molds and fill them 
with the mixture. Stand in a pan partly filled with hot water, cover 
with buttered paper, and place in a moderate oven until they are firmly 
set in the center. Turn out carefully, pour around them a plain white 
sauce and sprinkle with a little chopped parsley. 

Sunflower Eggs 

One egg, one tablespoonful butter, one tablespoonful Albers flour, 
half a cup of milk. Boil egg hard ; mash white of egg with fork. Cream 
butter and flour; stir until it foams; add milk and cook. Mix with white 
of egg; turn on a small plate ; put yolk through a sieve and cover mixture. 
Place pointed bits of toast around plate, representing sunflower. 

Egg Cutlets 

Prepare a thick cream, using one and one-half tablespoonfuls each 
of butter and Albers flour, half of salt, a dash of cayenne, one 
and one-half cups of milk. Stir into this four eggs, which have been 
boiled and coarsely chopped, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one 
small tablespoonful of lemon juice, ten drops of onion juice and the yolks 
of two beaten eggs. Stir and cook for a minute. Set aside until chilled. 
Form into small cutlets, dip in beaten eggs and fine bread crumbs and 
fry a golden brown in fat.

and carefully drop a raw egg in each. Place apart on a buttered pah 
and bake in a moderate oven until the eggs are set. Serve with or without 
a cream sauce. 

Steamed Eggs 

Beat six eggs into separate cups, and have ready a well-buttered 
dish, into which each egg should be placed carefully. Cover the dish 
to prevent the heat from escaping, and place it over a pan of boiling 
water, first putting small bits of butter lightly over the top of the eggs. 
When they are set sufficiently, sprinkle them with a little salt and serve 
with fried ham or sausages. It takes four minutes to set. 

Egg Nogg

Blanc-mange, Souffles, Meringues 
Custards, Creams, Etc. 



Blancmange 

Time, fifteen minutes — Put into a delicately clean stewpan one ounce 
isinglass or gelatine, two ounces of sweet and bitter almonds, blanched 
and pounded, one pint and a half of new milk, and one pint of cream, 
the lemon juice and the peel grated, with loaf sugar to taste. Set the 
stewpan over a clear fire, and stir it till the gelatine is dissolved, then take 
it off and continue stirring it till nearly cold before putting it into the 
mold. This quantity will fill a quart mold, but if you wish to make it in 
a smaller shape, you must not pour more than a pint of milk and a half a 
pint of cream. Color the top ornament with cochineal, and allow it to 
cool. Strawberry Souffle 

Beat the yolks of two eggs in one-half cupful of ripe crushed straw- 
berries, juice of two oranges and one-half cupful of sugar together, then 
cook for two minutes add one-quarter of a package of gelatine soaked till 
soft, the whipped whites of two eggs, and when cold one cupful of 
whipped cream ; turn into a souffle dish surrounded with a paper band ; 
cover with strawberry jelly and place on ice until needed. 

Omelet Souffle 

Separate the whites from the yolks of twelve eggs. Put the whites 
into a basin and beat them extremely fast till they form a thick snow. 
Then beat six yolks separately, with two ounces of sugar, and a dessert 
spoonful of orange-flower water, or just enough to flavor it to your taste. 

Before beating the eggs have ready a round tin, well greased all 
over the inside with fresh butter. When you have finished beating the 
six yolks, mix them very quickly with the whites, lest the snow should 
turn — that is, melt into water. Put it then into the buttered tin, and place 
it in the oven. It will be so thick, if it is well and skillfully mixed, that 
there will be no fear of its running over. Watch it well, glancing at it 
from time to time through a little opening in the oven door, to see how 
it is going on. As soon as it has risen very high, and if of a golden color, 
take it out of the oven. 

Do not suffer the omelet souffle to remain too long in the oven. If it 
is not watched it will fall in and become a mere gelette. Let the oven 
be of a very gentle heat, or the bottom of the omelet will be burnt before 
the top is done. Before putting the tin in the oven, you may powder the 
snow with fine sugar; it crystalizes and has a pretty effect. As soon as 
the omelet is done it must be sent to table. If it waits for longer than 
ten minutes, it falls in. The eggs should be beaten with a fork or a 
little whisk. 

If this souffle is liked more solid, add to the yolks of the eggs when 
beaten two dessert spoonfuls of rice boiled in milk and flavored with 
vanilla. In this case do not put in the orange-flower flavoring. The 
rice must be very well cooked, and well sweetened before it is added to 
the eggs. Chocolate Souffle — Mexican Style 

Scald one cup of clear, black coffee; stir into it three level table- 
spoonfuls butter; creamed and mixed with three level tablespoonfuls 
corn starch, and a few grains salt; add one and one-half ounces chocolate 

131 



BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

beating it through the mixture as it melts. Mix the yolks of three eggs 
with one-third cup of sugar, beat and stir into the hot mixture ; remove 
from fire and fold in the stiffly beaten whites of three eggs. Turn the 
mixture into a buttered pudding dish, dredge with sugar, and bake in 
a pan of hot water about twenty-five minutes. Serve with vanilla sauce. 

Lemon Souffle 
Melt two rounding tablespoonfuls butter in a saucepan, add 
three tablespoonfuls corn starch, and one tablespoonful Albers flour, mix, 
gradually add one-half cup hot water, stirring until smooth and well 
cooked. Beat the yolks of three eggs till light, add one cup sugar, grated 
rind and juice one lemon, add hot mixture, beating in smoothly. Then 
fold in carefully the stiffly beaten whites of three eggs, to which has been 
added while beating one-half teaspoonful lemon extract. Turn into a 
buttered baking dish, stand in a pan of hot water and bake thirty-five 
to forty minutes. Orange Souffle 

Slice five oranges, and pour over them a cold custard made of one 
pint of milk, the yolks of five eggs, sweetened to taste; beat the whites 
of eggs to a froth, and brown carefully. 

Celery Souffle, Cheese Sauce 
Cut into very thin slices, white inside stalks celery, and dne thin 
slice onion, cook in boiling water to cover until tender, then drain, reserv- 
ing liquid. In three level tablespoonfuls melted butter cook three level 
tablespoonfuls of corn starch, two level tablespoonfuls of Albers flour, 
one-half teaspoonful of salt and pepper to taste. Add one-half cup of 
celery liquid, and one-half cup of cream and cook thoroughly. Remove 
from fire, add cooked celery, the well-beaten yolks of three eggs and 
lastly fold in the stiffly beaten whites of three eggs. Bake in a buttered 
shallow dish for about twenty-five minutes. Serve with cheese sauce. 
To one cup cream sauce add one-third cup grated cheese for sauce. 
Season with paprika and celery salt. 

Apple Souffle 
Pare, core and stew four tart apples in just enough water to prevent 
burning. Pass through a sieve when soft. Baked apples can be used 
as well. Put one tablespoonful of butter into a saucepan, add one cup 
boiling water and one-quarter teaspoonful salt, stir in four level table- 
spoonfuls corn starch and one level tablespoonful Albers flour dissolved 
in four tablespoonfuls cold water, stir and cook until smooth and clear. 
Add one cup hot apple pulp sweetened to taste, and one teaspoon- 
ful lemon juice. Remove from fire, mix well and add three beaten yolks 
of eggs, then fold in stiffly beaten whites of three eggs. Pour into 
buttered baking dish, shallow rather than deep, then bake in moder- 
ately hot oven till puffed and browned. Serve at once when ready. 

Meringues 
Whisk the whites of four small eggs to a froth, then stir into it 
one-half pound of powdered sugar; flavor with vanilla or lemon essence, 
and repeat the whisking until it will lie in a heap ; then lay the 
mixture in lumps on letter paper, in the shape of half an egg, molding 
it with a spoon, laying each about half an inch apart. Then place the 
paper containing the meringues on a piece of hard wood and put them 
into a quick oven ; do not close it. Watch them, and when they begin to 
have a yellow appearance, take them out, remove the paper carefully 

132 



BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

from the wood, and let them cool for two or three minutes ; then slip a 
thin-bladed knife very carefully under one, turn it into your left hand, 
take another from the paper in the same way, and join the two sides 
which were next the paper together. The soft inside may be taken 
out with the handle of a small spoon, the shells filled with jam, jelly or 
cream and then joined together as above, cementing them together with 
some of the mixture. Cream Puffs 

One cupful of hot water and one-half cupful of butter. Boil the 
water and butter together and stir in a cupful of dry flour while boiling. 
When cool, add three eggs not beaten. Mix well and drop by spoonfuls 
on buttered tins. Bake about twenty minutes. 

Cream. — One cupful of milk, one-half cupful of sugar, one egg and 
three level tablespoonfuls of Albers flour. Beat the eggs, sugar and flour 
together and stir in the milk when boiling. With a knife lift off the top 
of the puffs and fill. Boiled Custard 

One quart milk, eight eggs, one-half pound sugar ; beat to a good 
froth the eggs and sugar. Put the milk in a tin pan and set it in boiling 
water; pour in the eggs and sugar and stir it until it thickens. 

Baked Custards 

For each quart of milk allow four large or five small eggs and three 
tablespoons sugar. Warm milk ; pour over eggs and sugar beaten to- 
gether. Fill small earthen cups or pudding dish. Stand in pan of warm 
water; add flavoring to suit, and bake in moderate oven till firm in the 
center. For chocolate custards melt chocolate with sugar. 

Tapioca Custard 

Put two tablespoonfuls fine tapioca in double boiler with one pint 
milk, cook and stir till tapioca is transparent. Add yolks of two eggs 
beaten with three tablespoons sugar, and pinch salt; stir till thickened. 
Add whites whipped to a stiff froth, then stir lightly three minutes; take 
from fire, add flavoring when cooled. If pearl or lump tapioca is used, 
it must be soaked in cold water several hours before cooking. 

Lemon Custard 

Take half pound of loaf sugar, the juice of two lemons, the peel of 
one pared very thin, boiled tender and rubbed through a sieve, and a pint 
of white wine. Let all boil for a quarter of an hour, then take out the 
peel and a little of the liquor and set them to cool. Pour the rest into 
the dish you intend for it. Beat the yolks of the eggs and the whites and 
mix them with the cool liquor. Strain them into your dish, stir them well 
up together, and set them on a slow fire in boiling water. When done, 
grate the peel of a lemon on the top, brown it over with a salamander. 
This custard may be eaten either hot or cold. 

Apple Snow 

Core, quarter and steam three large sour apples. Rub through sieve, 
cool, whip whites three eggs to very stiff froth with one-half cup pow- 
dered sugar, gradually add apple and whip long time till white and 
stiff. Put in dish and garnish with dots of currant jelly.

can of Sri fflonfr Brand spinach and chop very fine or put through a 
meat chopper. Rub the egg yolks to a paste with a tablespoonful of 
melted butter ; work into this the spinach, adding more melted butter 
if necessary to make a paste that can be handled. Season with salt 
and pepper, and make the mixture into balls. Cut off the ends of the 
halved egg-whites so that they may stand. Fit into each one of these 
one of the balls, and arrange on a lettuce-lined platter. As there will 
be some of the paste left over, make it all up into round balls, and gar- 
nish the edge of the dish with them. Pour over all mayonnaise dress-

Tomatoes, Corn and Green Peppers 

Cut the tops from green peppers, remove with a sharp knife the 
inner membrane and seeds, and put into a bowl. Pour over the peppers 
enough boiling water to cover them, and leave in this water until it

HINTS ON COOKING AND SERVING 

Vegetables should be boiled in soft water, if obtainable, if not, a little 
carbonate of soda thrown in will render it so. The water should only 
be allowed to come to a boil before putting in the vegetables. It is best 
to boil vegetables by themselves and to boil quickly. When done take 
them up immediately and drain. 

In cooking all vegetables, a teaspoonful of salt for each two quarts 
of water is allowed. Most vegetables are eaten dressed with salt, pepper 
and butter, but sometimes a piece of lean pork is broiled with them, 
which seasons them sufficiently. 

Time Table 

Thirty minutes. — Asparagus, Corn, Macaroni, Mushrooms, Peas, 
Tomatoes, New Cabbage, Cauliflower. 

Forty-five minutes. — Young Beets, Carrots, Parsnips, Turnips, Baked 
Potatoes, Rice. 

One hour. — Artichokes, String Beans, Sprouts, Greens, Salsify (oys- 
ter plant), New Onions, Winter Squash. 

Two hours. — Carrots, Parsnips, Turnips. 

Three to five hours. — Old Beets. 

Five to eight hours. — Dried Beans, Dried Peas, Hominy, etc. 

Corn Boiled on the Cob 

It is difficult to get corn that has been taken fresh from the field, 
therefore much of its original sweetness is lost. But no time should 
be lost in cooking it properly. It is a prevalent custom to cook the cob 
and thereby sacrifice the corn. Put the corn on to cook in rapidly and 
freshly boiling water. After it begins to boil, let it cook for five to eight 
minutes, take out the water, place on a cloth to steam and keep hot, and 
then on platter to serve at once. 

Sauted Green Tomatoes 

Select smooth tomatoes not quite half ripe. Wash, slice one-half 
inch thick, drain, dry and dust with salt and pepper. Egg and crumb the 
slices ; put three tablespoons of oil or drippings, with a bit of butter for 
flavor, in a frying pan, and when very hot, put in tomato slices. Fry 
until brown on one side, turn and brown on the other. Remove from 
pan with cake turner to retain shape, place on heated dish and serve with 
Hollandaise sauce.

Wipe the egg plant, cut in one-quarter-inch slices, soak in salted 
cold water one hour. Dip each slice in beaten egg and fry in butter until 
inside is very soft, outside brown. 

Potato Croquettes 

Mix together one pint of hot mashed potatoes, teaspoonful of salt, 
one-third of pepper, one of onion juice, one tablespoonful of butter, 
one tablespoon chopped parsley, yolks two beaten eggs. Stir over fire 
until mixture leaves side of saucepan. When cool, shape into croquettes, 
dip each in beaten egg, roll in crumbs, and fry brown in deep kettle of 
smoking hot fat. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes 

Heat one tablespoon butter in frying-pan. Add one tablespoon 
chopped onion. When pale brown add one pint diced boiled potatoes, 
seasoned. Shake till butter is absorbed ; potatoes should not color. Add 
one tablespoon chopped parsley and take up. 

Potato Cakes 

Roast some potatoes in the oven ; when done skin and pound in a 
mortar with a small piece of butter, warmed in a little milk ; chop a 
shallot and a little parsley very finely, mix well with the potatoes, add 
pepper, salt, shape into cakes, egg and bread crumb them, and fry a light 
brown. 

To Cook Salsify 

Scrape the root and put into cold water immediately; cut into thin 
slices; boil tender, make a nice white sauce or drawn butter and pour 
over, or boil to a mash ; mix with butter, salt, a little milk and pepper, 
add flour enough and mix as codfish cakes; and fry in the same manner. 

Summer Squash 

The white scallopped ones are the best. Take them before the rind 
or seeds become hard. Wash and cut in moderately small pieces. Boil 
in clear water until tender enough to mash. Then place in a colander and 
drain. Have ready some bread cut in small pieces (not crumbled). Now 
put in a spoonful of good butter in a skillet. When hot put in the bread 
and stir until brown, then add the squash. Mash and mix well together, 
and season with pepper and salt. 

Green Peas 

Shell into cold water. Then put them into cold water and let simmer 
twenty minutes ; season with plenty of butter and salt and a cupful of 
cream. Canned peas should merely be turned out of the can, liquor 
poured off the peas, rinsed, and set on to boil. When done add milk, 
butter and salt. When they have come to a boil once they are ready 
for the table.

Stuffed Peppers 

Six green peppers from which stem ends and seeds have been re- 
moved. Scald in water to cover, over the simmering burner, from five to 
eight minutes. Drain ready to fill. Make filling from nicely boiled or 
steamed whole and blanched, season with salt, pepper and butter. Or 
from "left overs," if at hand ; one and one-half cupfuls of rice, 
three-fourths of a cup of minced lamb, veal or chicken is used. To- 
matoes may be stuffed with one-half cup of stewed and strained to- 
matoes ; and one teaspoon grated onion pulp. Mix ingredients, fill pep- 
pers two-thirds and finish each with buttered bread crumbs. Put closely 
together in a deep baking dish, with one-half cup of stock or water 
in the dish. Cover for first ten minutes in the oven, and bake fifteen 
minutes longer uncovered. A very rare vegetable entree when minced 
lamb, veal or chicken is used. Tomatoes may be stuffed with the same 
mixture, substituting chopped pepper for tomato or using peppers with 
the plain rice. 

Potato Noodles 

Mash boiled potatoes fine and mix with enough flour to make a stiff 
dough. Pinch off bits of the dough and roll between the palms of the 
hands to little strips, the length of your smallest finger. Throw into a 
pot of boiling water. When they come to the top skim them out, 
put in a colander and hold under cold running water. When they are 
boiled and cooled, stand until dry. Fry brown in butter and serve with 
steak and tomato sauce. 

Potato au Gratin 

Slice cold boiled potatoes. Make a cream sauce from two table- 
spoonfuls each of butter and Albers flour, one level teaspoonful of salt, 
one-eighth of a teaspoon of pepper. Heat butter, add flour and seasoning. 
When hot, add milk gradually and cook smoothly. Add potatoes, let 
heat through and put in buttered individual dishes or baking dish. Fold 
lightly some finely chopped cheese and bake about ten minutes in a 
moderate oven. 

Carrots and Other Root Vegetables 

Scrape or pare carrots, parsnips, turnips. Dice and cook gently in 
unsalted water till tender. Drain and reheat in seasoned butter, one 
tablespoon to one pint, or in a drawn butter or white sauce. In early 
summer, when roots are small, water should be salted. Onions should 
also be boiled in salted water, then finished as here directed. 

Stewed Corn 

Husk corn. Draw sharp knife down center of each row of grain; 
press out pulp with back of knife. To one pint add one-half teaspoon 
salt, one-half teaspoon sugar, dash pepper, one-half cup cream or rich 
milk. Heat and simmer ten minutes.

Spanish Dish 

Take one cupful boiled rice, then fry two tomatoes and a half an 
onion together, season with pepper, salt, half teaspoon sugar and half a 
chili pepper. Mix with rice, all together, then add four tablespoonfuls 
of grated Swiss cheese and one cupful of cooked shrimps. Cook on back 
of stove half an hour. Very good, eaten hot or cold. 

Spanish Beans 

Soak two cups pink beans over night. In the morning cover beans 
with water, add a small onion and boil until beans will mash between 
fingers ; drain the liquid from the beans, but do not throw it away. Into 
a frying pan, not less than two inches deep, put a large cooking spoonful 
of fresh lard. Allow it to become quite clear. After laying in as many 
beans as will absorb lard, place the pan over a hot fire and mix beans 
and lard thoroughly together until the beans appear to have a coating 
of lard and begin to burst. Add a cupful of the liquid in which the beans 
were boiled and gently crush the beans with a spoon, but do not mash. 
Now add the remainder of the liquid and allow to simmer on the back 
of stove for half to one hour, or until the beans are of the consistency 
desired, either with considerable liquid (but thick) or quite dry. Success 
depends upon observing the following rules: Do not add salt until the 
beans are boiled soft. The onion is not perceptible after cooking, only 
gives the beans the characteristic Mexican taste, which no spice can 
produce. Have the lard at boiling point. Mexican chili may be added 
after the last portion of liquid is used. 

To prepare Mexican chili, take half a dozen dry chili peppers, remove 
seeds and cover with water and boil ten minutes. Chop fine and run 
through sieve to remove skins. Put in as much or as little, according 
to how hot you like them. 

Spanish Rice 

Take three onions, cut them up fine, and a small piece ot garlic 
cut fine, and put them in a pan with two or three large green peppers, 
cut small and fry not too brown ; then add one can of tomatoes, salt and 
pepper to taste and a little prepared chili con carne. Now have a small 
pan with hot lard, put in rice and fry not too brown ; then take rice and 
mix together with the sauce and fry slowly for about one hour. You will 
find this a delicious dish, also a very fine vegetable. 

String Beans Spanish 

Boil one pound of string beans until tender, let them cool ; beat 
the white of three eggs until, thick, put in the yellow, beat five minutes 
more, take six or seven string beans and roll them in the egg and fry 
them and serve with tomato sauce. 

Winter Squash 

Cut in pieces, take out the seeds and pare as thin as possible ; steam 
or boil until soft and tender. Drain and press well, then mash with 
butter, pepper, salt and sugar. Summer squash cook the same way; if 
extremely tender they need not be pared.

Broiled Mushrooms 

In order to test mushrooms, sprinkle salt on the gills — if they turn 
yellow they are poisonous, if they turn black they are good. After test- 
ing, pare and cut off stems, dip in melted butter, season with salt and 
pepper, broil on both sides and serve on toast. 

Baked Mushrooms 

Toast for each person a large slice of bread and spread over with 
rich, sweet cream ; lay on each side, head downward, a mushroom, or if 
small more than one ; season and fill each with as much cream as it will 
hold. Place over each a custard cup, pressing well down to the toast; set 
in a moderate oven and cook fifteen minutes. Do not remove the cups for 
five minutes after they come from the oven, as thereby the flavor of the 
mushroom is preserved in its entirety. 

Creamed Potatoes 

Put a pint of milk (or one-half pint of cream) in a frying-pan and 
let heat ; add a piece of butter the size of a butternut, thicken with Albers 
flour, can be cut into cubes. Boil twenty minutes in slightly salted 
water, taking care that they do not break, then drain and let cool a little. 
Now prepare a golden sauce as follows : Boil one-half cupful of milk or 
water with one-half dozen pepper corns and one teaspoonful of salt. 
When flavored, strain it into another saucepan and add one-half cup of 
butter and the yolks of three eggs, beat with a fork, over the fire, until it 
thickens like cream. Then squeeze in the juice of one-half of a lemon 
or a tablespoonful of vinegar. Pour over the potatoes and garnish with 
sprigs of parsley. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes 

Take six cold boiled potatoes, place them in a frying-pan with a 
piece of butter the size of an English walnut and an onion chopped up 
raw. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring until well browned. 
Chop a little parsley and sprinkle over. 

Potato Cakes 

Grate raw potatoes and add a little salt, a piece of butter and an egg. 
Beat all well together, dredge with Albers flour. Drop them into good 
drippings and fry a light brown. Cold mashed potatoes can be made in 
the same manner, but they are not as nice.

Succotash 



Time, one hour and a half. — Cut off the corn from the cobs, and 
put the cobs in just water enough to cover them, and boil one hour; 
then remove the cobs and put in the corn and a quart of Lima beans, and 
boil thirty minutes. When boiled, add some cream or milk, salt and 
butter. 

Parsnip Fritters 

Time, one hour and a half to boil. — Boil four or five parsnips until 
tender, take off the skins and mash them very fine, add to them a tea- 
spoonful of flour, one egg, well beaten, and a seasoning of salt. Make the 
mixture into small cakes with a spoon, and fry them on both sides a 
delicate brown in boiling butter or beef drippings ; when both sides are 
done, serve them up very hot on a napkin or hot dish, according to 
your taste. 

Saratoga Chips 

Peel the potatoes carefully, cut into very thin slices and keep in 
cold water over night ; in the morning drain off water and rub the 
potatoes between napkins thoroughly dry, then throw a handful at 
a time into a kettle or pan of very hot lard, stirring so that they may not 
adhere to the kettle or to each other. As soon as they become light 
brown and crisp remove quickly with a skimmer and sprinkle with salt 
as they are taken up. 

Cucumbers a la Creme 

Cucumbers of medium size are best for this dish. Pare and quarter 
or dice six cucumbers ; remove the seeds and soak for one-half hour, 
or until crisp, in water. Put into a saucepan, cover with boiling water, 
add a teaspoon of salt, and boil about thirty minutes or until tender, 
Drain and add one and one-half cups of cream sauce, allowing to cook a 
moment or two in the sauce. 

Spinach 

Wash in several waters, until entirely free from sand. When young 
and tender, put in a deep stewpan, add one-quarter cup of water and 
cook slowly, covered for fifteen or twenty minutes, in its own juices. Old 
spinach should be cooked in boiling salted water, two quarts of water 
allowed to one peck of spinach. Drain well, reheat, season with salt, 
pepper and oil or butter. Garnish with slices of hard-boiled eggs, or to 
suit individual taste. 

String Beans 

Top and tail the beans, and strip off all strings carefully; break into 
short lengths and wash. Boil in salted water until tender — from one and 
one-half to three hours. Drain, season and butter, salt and pepper.

boiling- water, to which has been added a little salt. Cook until tender, 
then add half a pint of milk, one dessertspoonful of flour which has been 
moistened with a little milk and one heaping teaspoonful of butter. Boil 
for five minutes and serve with boiled potatoes. 

Asparagus on Toast 

Have stalks of equal length ; scrape lower ends ; tie in small bunches 
with tape. Cook twenty to thirty minutes, according to size. Dip six 
or eight slices dry toast in asparagus liquor, lay on hot platter, place 
asparagus on them, and cover with a white or drawn butter sauce ; in 
making sauce use asparagus liquor and water or milk in equal quantities. 

Kidney Beans, Brown Sauce 

Cook one pint fresh shelled beans in salted water till tender. Drain ; 
shake in saucepan with one teaspoon butter three minutes. Add one cup 
brown sauce and simmer five minutes. 

Macaroni 

Have a large kettle nearly full of rapidly boiling salted water. 
Break macaroni into two or three-inch lengths, drop into the water, and 
boil as directed for rice until tender, which will take from thirty to 
forty-five minutes. Drain, then pour cold water through colander to 
remove pastiness. Reheat in a little butter or in a white, brown or 
tomato sauce. Before sending to table, sprinkle thickly with grated 
cheese or stir the cheese through it. 

Spaghetti, vermicelli, or any of the forms of paste may be prepared 
in the same way. 

Mexican Stuffed Chili 

Select even sized green peppers and cut the stems, seed and core. 
Make a stuffing of sardines and cheese chopped fine. Mix it with one egg. 
Stuff the peppers with this. Dip in thick butter and fry in deep, hot fat. 
Drain in a colander. When done serve very hot. 

Stewed Celery 

Time, one hour and twenty minutes. — Wash four heads of celery- 
very clean, take off the dead leaves, and cut away any spots or discolored 
parts. Cut them into pieces about two or three inches long, and stew 
them for nearly half an hour. Then take them out, strain the water they 
were stewed in, and add it to half a pint of veal gravy, mixed with three 
or four tablespoonfuls of cream. Put in the pieces of celery and let them 
stew for nearly an hour longer. Serve with the sauce poured over.

Young Beets Boiled 

Wash them very clean, but neither scrape nor cut them. Put them 
in boiling water, and according to their size, boil them from one to two 
hours ; skin when done, grade with pepper, salt, a little butter. Beets are 
very nice baked, but require a much longer time to cook.

Recipes for Invalid Cooking 



Always prepare food for the sick in the neatest and most careful 
manner. In sickness the senses are usually acute, and far more sus- 
ceptible to carelessness, negligence, and mistakes in the preparation and 
serving of food than when in health. 



To Make Gruel 

Pour one quart of hot water into a clean earthen or tin vessel over a 
brisk fire ; when it boils, add two large tablespoonfuls of corn or oat- 
meal ; mix it smooth in just enough water to thicken it; put a small lump 
of butter into the water and when melted, add the meal and stir for about 
one-half hour; then add a teacupful of sweet milk, and when it boils again 
throw in the upper crust of hard-baked bread, cut into small pieces ; let 
it boil some time and add a little black pepper, a little salt, a pinch of 
grated nutmeg, a little more butter and a teaspoonful of French brandy. 
The butter, spices and brandy should be omitted when the case is a 
serious one. 



Beef Tea 

Take one pound of lean beef, cut it fine, put it in a bottle corked 
tightly, and put the bottle into a kettle of warm water; the water should 
be allowed to boil for a considerable time ; the bottle should then be 
removed and the contents poured out. The tea may be salted a little and 
a teaspoonful given each time. Another way of preparing it is as follows : 
Take a thick steak, broil slightly on a gridiron until the juices have 
started, and then squeeze thoroughly with a lemon squeezer. The juice 
thus extracted will be highly nutritious. 

Restorative Jelly 

Put in glass jar one-half box granulated gelatine, one tablespoon 
granulated gum arabic, two cloves, three tablespoons sugar, two table- 
spoons lemon juice, one cup port wine. Stand in kettle cold water, heat 
till all is dissolved. Strain into shallow dish. Chill. Cut in one-half 
inch squares. 

Beef Juice 

Cut a thin, juicy steak into pieces one and one-half inches square; 
brown separately one and one-half minutes on each side before a hot 
fire; squeeze in a hot lemon squeezer; flavor with salt and pepper. May 
add to milk or pour on toast.

Mutton Broth 

Lean loin of mutton, one and one-half pounds, including bone; water 
three pints. Boil gently till tender, throwing in a little salt and onion 
according to taste. Pour out broth in basin ; when cold skim off fat. 
Warm up as wanted. 

Chicken Broth 

Select a plump chicken, cut into pieces and put into a granite pot 
with cover. Add two tablespoonfuls of pearl barley and two quarts of 
water; simmer for three hours, skimming frequently. When done re- 
move from the fire, let stand for three hours ; skim off top, heat, and 
serve. 

Clam Broth 

Wash thoroughly six large clams in shell ; put in kettle with one cup 
of water; bring to boil and keep there one minute; the shells open, the 
water takes up the proper quantity of juice, and the broth is ready to pour 
off and serve hot. 

Cream Soup 

Take one quart of good stock (mutton or veal), cut one onion into 
quarters, slice three potatoes very thin, and put them into the stock with 
a small piece of mace; boil gently for an hour; then strain out the onion 
and mace ; the potatoes should by this time have dissolved in the stock. 
Add one pint of milk, mixed with a very little corn flour to make it about 
as thick as cream. A little butter improves it. This soup may be made 
with milk instead of stock, if a little cream is used. 

Apple Soup 

Two cups of apples, two of water, two teaspoons of corn starch, 
one and one-half tablespoonfuls of sugar, one saltspoonful of cin- 
namon and a bit of salt. Stew the apple in the water until it is very soft, 
then mix together into a smooth paste the corn starch, sugar, salt and 
cinnamon with a little cold water; pour this into the apple and boil 
for five minutes. Strain it and keep it hot until ready to serve. 

Raw Meat Diet 
Scrape pulp from a good steak, season to taste, smear on thin slices 
of bread. Sear bread slightly and serve as a sandwich. 

Nutritious Coffee 
Dissolve a little gelatine in water, put one-half ounce of freshly 
ground coffee into sauce pan with one pint of new milk, which should 
be nearly boiling before the coffee is added ; boil both together for three 
minutes; clear by pouring some of it into a cup and dashing back again; 
add the gelatine and leave it to settle for a few minutes. Beat up an 
egg in a breakfast cup and pour the coffee upon it. If preferred, drink 
without the egg. 

Rum Punch 

White sugar two teaspoonfuls ; one egg stirred and beaten up ; warm 
milk, large wineglassful ; Jamaica rum, two to four teaspoonfuls nutmeg.

Lima Bean Puree 

Soak one pint of lima beans over night. Pour off water and if the 
skins are very loose, remove them as you would almonds, when blanching 
them. Put on to cook in one pint of water, add one-eighth teaspoon of 
soda, celery leaves or stalk of celery, and a few moments before tender, 
teaspoonful of salt and one-eighth of a teaspoon of pepper. When soft, 
put through puree sieve, return to fire and add one pint of milk and one 
tablespoon of Albers flour, blended with two tablespoons of butter. Serve

teaspoon of pepper. When sauce has thickened smoothly, add the peas, 
let them cook a moment, and fill the cases. 

Boiled Artichokes 

The artichokes should be washed well in several waters and picked 
over carefully to see that no insects are about them. Trim the leaves at 
the bottom. Cut off the stems and put the artichokes into boiling water 
with a heaped tablespoonful of salt and a piece of soda the size of a 
quarter. Keep the saucepan uncovered, and let them boil quickly until 
tender. When done you can thrust a fork through them. Take them out, 
drain, and serve with white sauce, made of flour, butter, new milk, two 
small onions cut up thin in it, and pepper. A tureen of melted butter 
should accompany them. It takes twenty-five minutes to cook them, and 
they should be gathered two or three days before wanted for use. 

Escalloped Onions 

Take eight or ten onions of good size, slice them, and boil till tender. 
Lay them in a baking dish, putting bread crumbs, butter in small bits, 
pepper and salt between each layer, until the dish is full, putting bread 
crumbs last; add milk or cream until full. Bake twenty minutes or half 
an hour.

Chop Suey 
(For Six persons) 

One pound of water chestnuts, two pounds of bean sprouts, which 
can be procured at any Chinese vegetable stand. While shopping buy 
twenty-five cents' worth of gu yow, a Chinese sauce made only in China 
and which enters into nearly all oriental meat dishes. It is a brown look- 
ing liquid with a peculiar flavor, and can be purchased of any Chinese 
dealer. The water chestnuts must be shaved thin ; add a little sliced 
celery, one small onion chopped, half a dozen mushrooms ; cut young 
chicken into small pieces; have a kettle with peanut oil (in same quan- 
tity as lard would be used) ; into this place the vegetables and chicken all 
together; let fry until tender, stirring often to prevent burning. Just be- 
fore taking off add the bean sprouts, which must not be cooked too long, 
as they are better when little more than half done. Drain off the liquor, 
add a little flour to thicken ; salt to taste. Just at the last add a teaspoon- 
ful of the brown sauce. Pour all over the chop suey; stir together and 
serve. 

Noodles 

Take one egg, add half an egg shell of water, then Albers flour 
enough to make very stiff. Roll thin and allow to lay about half an hour. 
Then cut in strips and boil about 15 minutes. Put in dish and pour drawn 
butter over it. 

Wroten's English Plum Pudding 

Two and one-half cups Albers flour, one cup bread crumbs, one pound 
raisins, one pound currants, one-half pound citron, one and one-half cups 
chopped suet, one wineglass brandy, one heaping teaspoon all kinds of 
spices, pinch salt, one cup black molasses, one cup brown sugar, six eggs 
well beaten, one teaspoon soda dissolved in hot water, two teaspoons 
baking powder sifted in Albers flour enough for stiff batter. Put in well 
greased tins. Boil four hours. 

Crackers and Cream 

A nicely toasted cracker, with sweet cream poured over it, is deli- 
cate and nourishing for an invalid. 

Tapioca 

Soak over night two tablespoonfuls of tapioca in two cups of water. 
In the morning add one pint of milk, sugar to taste and a pinch of salt; 
simmer until soft, stirring frequently. When dished add one tablespoon- 
ful of wine and grate over a little nutmeg. 

Rye Coffee 

When one is not allowed coffee or tea a good substitute can be made 
by browning rye as coffee is browned; then to one cup of rye add one 
cup of cold water. Let it boil slowly for ten minutes, then add two cup& 
of boiling water and serve with sugar and cream.

Jams and Jellies 



Apple Jelly 

Select sound, red, fine-flavored apples not too ripe ; wash, wipe and 
core ; place in a granite kettle, cover with water and let cook slowly until 
the*apples look red. Pour into a muslin bag and drain; return juice to 
a clean kettle and boil one-half hour; skim. Now measure and to every 
pint of juice, allow a pound of sugar; boil quickly for ten minutes. Red 
apples will give jelly the color of wine while that from light fruit will be 
like amber. 

Quince Jelly 

Do not pare but polish quinces smooth with flannel cloth. Cut in 
small pieces, core and put all in a kettle. Pour over cold water to cover 
and boil soft. Pour all into a flannel bag and hang up to drain carefully, 
pressing occasionally to make the juice run freely. To one pint of juice 
add three-fourths of a pound of sugar and boil fifteen minutes. Pour into 
tumblers. 

Plum Jelly 

Take plums not too ripe, put in a granite pan and set in a pan of 
water over the fire. Let the water boil gently till all the juice has come 
from the fruit, strain through a flannel bag and boil with an equal weight 
of sugar twenty minutes. 

Crab-Apple Jelly 

Select juicy apples. Mealy ones are no good. Wash and quarter 
and put into a preserving kettle over the fire with a teacupful of water. 
If necessary add more water as it evaporates. When boiled to a pulp 
strain the apples through a flannel bag, then proceed as for other jelly. 

Orange Marmalade 

Cut two dozen oranges in halves, crosswise. With a glass lemon- 
squeezer extract the juice. Dig out the pulp and seeds, throwing them 
away. Soak the peelings over night in salt water. In the morning 
rinse and boil peelings in clear water until tender, then chop and add 
juice. Weigh and add equal quantity of sugar. Let boil thirty minutes. 
Put in jelly tumblers and cover as you do jelly. 

Tomato Marmalade 

Remove the skins from a peck of tomatoes, slicing them as for the 
table. Put them into a kettle, with a pint of sugar, and spice to taste. 
Cook slowly till they are quite thick. Put them in a jar and pour over a 
little vinegar. This is a nice relish with meat.

preserving kettle and boil slowly twenty-five minutes ; add the juice of 
one lemon to every quart of fruit. Set away in jelly glasses. 

Preserved Peaches 

Select the yellow red-cheeked ones if possible (skin same as toma- 
toes, by pouring on boiling water, then thrusting them in cold water 
and separate in halves). Proceed as for preserving cherries, only using 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit. 

To Preserve Plums 

To every pound of fruit allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar. 
Divide the plums, take out the stones, and put the fruit on a dish with 
pounded sugar strewed over; the next day put them into a preserving 
pan and let them simmer gently by the side of the fire for about thirty 
minutes, then boil them quickly; removing the scum as it rises, and keep 
them constantly stirred, or the jam will stick to the bottom of the pan. 
Crack the stones and add the kernels to the preserve when it boils. 

Quince Preserves 

Pare and core the fruit and boil till very tender. Make a syrup of 
a pound of sugar for each pound of the fruit and after removing the 
scum boil the quinces in this syrup for one-half hour. 

Preserved Lemon Peel 

Make a thick syrup of white sugar, chop the lemon peel fine and boil 
it in the syrup ten minutes ; put in glass tumblers and paste paper over. 
A teaspoonful of this makes a loaf of cake, or a dish of sauce nice. 

Preserved Cherries 

Select the large cherries, remove the stems and stone them care- 
fully. To each pound of sugar allow one pound of cherries. Put fruit 
in granite pan and pour over them the sugar. Stir up and let stand over 
night to candy. In the morning put all into the preserving pan, place 
on the stove and boil gently until the cherries look clear, skimming oft' 
the scum as it rises. When the cherries have become quite clear, remove 
the pan from the stove and seal. Keep in dry, dark closet. 

Preserved Tomatoes 

A pound of sugar to a pound of tomatoes. Take six pounds of each ; 
the peel and juice of four lemons and a quarter of a pound of ginger tied 
up in a bag; put on the side of the range and boil slowly for three hours.

Spiced Fruits 

These are also called sweet pickle fruits. For four pounds prepared 
fruit allow one pint vinegar, two pounds brown sugar, one-half cup 
whole spices — cloves, allspice, stick cinnamon, and cassia-buds. Tie 
spices in thin muslin bag, boil ten minutes with vinegar and sugar. Skim, 
add fruit, cook till tender. Boil down syrup, pour over fruit in jars, and 
seal. If put in stone pots, boil syrup three successive mornings and pour 
over fruit. Currants, peaches, grapes, pears and berries may be prepared 
in this way, also ripe cucumbers, muskmelons, and watermelon rind. 

Currant Jam 

Wash, stem and mash red or white currants. Use one pound of 
sugar to one pint of fruit. Put the fruit and one-fourth of the sugar 
into a granite kettle ; stir and when it boils add balance of sugar. Let it 
boil until very thick. Putting in only a little sugar at a time prevents the 
currants from becoming hard. 

Gooseberry Jam 

Three pounds of loaf sugar six pounds of red gooseberries. Pick 
oft the stalks and buds from the gooseberries and boil them carefully but 
quickly for rather more than half an hour stirring continually, then add 
the sugar pounded fine and boil the jam quickly for half an hour stirring 
it all the time to prevent it sticking to the preserving pan. When done 
put it into pots cover it with brandy paper and secure it closely down 
with paper moistened with the white of an egg. 

Raspberry Jam 

To every pound of raspberries use the same weight of sugar, but 
always boil the fruit well before you add the sugar to it, as that will 
make it a better color. Put the fruit in a preserving pan, mashing well 
with a long wooden spoon. After boiling it a few minutes, add the same 
quantity of sugar as fruit, boiling it half an hour, keeping it well stirred. 
When done, and sufficiently reduced, fill the jars, and when cold cover 
them over with white paper moistened with the white of an egg. 

Blackberry Jam 

Crush a quart of fully ripe blackberries with a pound of the best loaf 
sugar pounded very fine; put it into a preserving pan, and set it over a 
gentle fire until thick, add a glass of brandy, and stir it again over the 
fire for about a quarter of an hour; then put it into pots and when cold 
tie them over. 

Strawberry Jam 

To six pounds of strawberries allow three pounds of sugar. Procure 
some fine scarlet strawberries, strip off the stalks and put them into a 
preserving pan over a moderate fire, boil them for half an hour, keeping 
them constantly stirred. Break the sugar into small pieces and mix them 
with the strawberries after they have been removed from the fire. Then 
place it again over the fire and boil for another half hour very quickly. 
Put it into pots, and when cold cover it over with brandy papers and a 
piece of paper moistened with the white of an egg over the tops.

now add syrup, strain the jelly and pour into glasses. 

Black Currant Jelly 

Gather the currants when ripe, on a dry day, strip them from the 
stalks and put them into an earthen pan or jar, and to every five quarts 
allow a half pint of water; tie the pan over and set it in the oven for an 
hour and a quarter, then squeeze out the juice through a coarse cloth, and 
to every pint of juice put a pound of loaf sugar, broken into pieces; boil 
it for three-quarters of an hour, skimming it well ; then pour it into small 
pots, and when cold put brandy papers over them and tie them closely 
over. 

Cranberry Jelly 

Place in granite saucepan one quart of cranberries and one cupful of 
water. Cook until soft and turn into flannel bag and let drain over night. 
In the morning measure the juice and allow an equal measure of sugar. 
Boil twenty minutes and turn into glasses. 

Raspberry Jelly 

Heat and strain as above. To each pint of juice allow one pint of 
sugar. Put the juice and sugar into a granite kettle, place over the fire

GENERAL RULES FOR 
CANNING and PRESERVING 



Canning 

The important points to be observed in canning are, to get only 
sound, ripe fruit; to have hot syrup and air-tight jars ; to fill jars to over- 
flowing and seal immediately. Jars should be scalded and tested before 
using. Patent canners greatly simplify the work. 

Pick over the fruit, stem, pare, cut, wash, etc., and pack in jars. 
Make syrup by adding one-half pint boiling water to one pound sugar. 
When clear, bring to boiling point and carefully fill the jars. Stand in 
canner or on board in wash boiler containing water up to shoulders of 
jars. Cover and cook according to directions or till tender. Take from 
canner or boiler, add more syrup till overflowing, cover and seal im- 
mediately. 



Amount of Sugar per Quart Jar 

Canned. Preserved. Canned. Preserved. 

Pineapple 8 oz 12 oz. Cherries 4 oz 8 oz. 

Crab apples ...6 oz 10 oz. Strawberries ..8 oz 12 oz. 

Plums 6 oz 9 oz. Raspberries . . 4 oz 6 oz.

Peaches 4 oz 8 oz. 



Preserving. 

Preserves require from three-quarters to one pound of sugar to each 
pound of fruit, and one-half cup water to each pound sugar. The fruit 
should be simmered in the syrup until tender, a little at a time ; skimmed 
out into jars; when all are done the syrup should be brought to boiling 
point, jars filled and sealed. Hard fruits like quinces should be first 
steamed or cooked in boiling water till tender.

Coffee, Tea, Chocolate and Cocoa 



Directions to Make "Good Coffee" 

In the preparation of Coffee, experts generally all agree on the fol- 
lowing rules : 

1 — To make coffee to perfection, you must use one tablespoonful of 
good coffee for each cup and one for the pot. 

2 — The water must be fresh drawn from the faucet and let come to 
a boil, because water that has once been boiled has lost a large amount 
of the air or oxygen it contains. 

3 — The percolation method is best ; coffee, preferably, should not be 
boiled, but if you must boil it, do not boil it over five minutes or a bitter 
concoction of tannin results. 

4 — The infusion must be drunk soon after making or its aroma and 
fine flavor are missed. 

5 — Whatever pot is used, it must be strictly clean and scalded with 
hot water so that it is thoroughly heated throughout. 

6 — To obtain the full aroma and flavor, the coffee must be freshly 
roasted and ground. 

Vienna Coffee 

Put in strainer of a percolator, a heaping tablespoonful of finely 
ground coffee for every ordinary size cup of coffee, press the coffee 
clown in the strainer slightly, and pour on your required amount of boil- 
ing water ; put the lid on the strainer and leave the water to filter through. 
Add to coffee, when serving, to two parts coffee, one part hot milk and a 
tablespoonful of whipped cream, which will float on top of coffee, adding 
to it a rich flavor and a very inviting appearance. When you prepare 
coffee after this recipe, you will have a very delicious coffee, such as 
served in all first-class cafes on the Karthner Ring in Vienna. 

French Drip Coffee "Cafe Noir" 

For every one ordinary cup, take two tablespoonfuls of finely 
ground coffee, which press down slightly in the strainer, then pour on 
your boiling hot water, put lid on strainer and leave water to filter 
through. When the water is all filtered through, you have "Cafe Noir," 
a very strong black coffee which is usually drunk with brandy, the latter 
being poured in saucer with sugar and then ignited, leaving the spirits 
burn out. Sometimes it is diluted with hot water. 
Milk Coffee or "Cafe au Lait" 

Prepare the coffee the same as "Cafe Noir," with a little chicory 
added, about 3 ounces chicory to the pound of coffee, and when serving, 
add to it an equal amount of hot milk. When serving "Cafe au Lait" in 
the French cafes, the waiter brings the coffee pot in one hand and the 
vessel containing hot milk in the other and pours into the cup from both 
vessels at the same time. These recipes are followed in all the prominent 
cafes in Paris. 

Coffee Boiled 

Take one tablespoonful medium ground coffee to a cup. and one 
for the pot. Draw fresh water from the faucet, boil in kettle for 
five minutes, pour the water on coffee in pot and allow it to steep for 
five minutes, then remove the grounds from the liquor, and you can use 
it several hours afterwards. 

166 



BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Coffee Steeped 

Take one tablespoonful medium ground coffee to a cup, and one 
for the pot. Put the coffee in the required amount of cold water, and 
then bring it to a boil, and boil for a few minutes, and then strain 
grounds from liquor and serve while hot. 

Meringued Coffee 

Make coffee after any approved formula. Put sugar and scalding 
milk in each cup and add the coffee. Have a meringue made by mixing 
the white of an egg, well beaten, with half a pint of whipped cream. Lay 
a heaping spoonful on top of each cup before serving. 

Meringue Chocolate 

Make chocolate according to general directions. Beat an egg sepa- 
rately, pour the liquid over the beaten yolk (one egg to pint). Whip the 
whites to a stiff froth and put a spoonful on the top of each cupful of hot 
chocolate before serving. Half cupful of whipped cream mixed lightly 
with the beaten white is a great improvement. 

Ordinary Chocolate 

Mix one tablespoonful of Ghirardelli's Chocolate for every ordi- 
nary cup, with two tablespoonfuls of Cream. Dissolve the above with 
boiling water, 'the quantity required, or dissolve the quantity required in 
the corresponding quantity of boiling milk. Boil half minute, stirring 
continuously. The delicious beverage is then ready. 

Cocoa 

Use a teaspoonful of Ghirardelli's Cocoa in a breakfast cup, add 
a tablespoonful of boiling water, or two tablespoonfuls of Cream, and 
mix thoroughly. Then fill balance of cup with boiling milk or water. 
Two minutes' boiling will improve it. 

Directions to Make "Tea" to Perfection 

To have tea in perfection, it is only necessary to follow the following 
rules : 

1 — Let the water be fresh from the faucet. 

2 — Let the water boil furiously five minutes before using. 

3 — Let the water remain on the leaves not less than seven nor over 
ten minutes, then be poured off into another heated vessel. 

4 — Use one full teaspoonful of tea for every cup of water, and if too 
strong, reduce the quantity. 

Adherence to these simple rules procures the best and most harmless 
tonic, the most exquisite flavor and most inexpensive beverage known to 
civilization, averaging two hundred to three hundred cups to the pound. 
No water sold in bottles is cheaper than this. 

A thoroughly good tea can be purchased at retail at 50c per pound, 
but by no means a choice one. Hence it is better to buy no tea under 60c 
per pound, but better still, $1.00, and be assured of receiving both the 
bouquet and maximum tonic properties. 

If you want the best brand of teas, ask for the following: 

Black Teas — Indian or Assam, Ceylon, English Breakfast and 
Oolong. 

Green Teas — Gunpowder, Young Hyson, Basket Fired or Uncolored 
Japan, Porcelain Fired Japan. 

Chocolate 

Take one tablespoonful of Ghirardelli's Ground Chocolate for an 
ordinary breakfast cup or half pint. Dissolve the quantity required in 
the corresponding quantity of boiling milk. Boil for half a minute, 
stirring continuously. The delicious beverage is then ready.

sugar the last time of boiling. Cover tightly and put in cool place. 



Raspberry Vinegar 

Fill a stone jar that is not glazed, with raspberries; pour vinegar 
over them till the jar is full. Let it sand nine days, stirring it every day. 
Strain it off and to every pint of juice add three-quarters of a pound of 
white sugar. Boil it as long as any scum rises, and bottle up for use. 
A dessertspoonful of this in a glassful of water will prove a refreshing 
drink. 



Economy Vinegar 

Save the sound cores and the parings of apples used in cooking. Put 
into a jar, cover with cold water, stand in a warm place, add one-half 
pint of molasses to every two gallons. Cover the jar with gauze; add 
more parings and cores occasionally. This will make a good vinegar.

Mildew in white clothes may be removed by soaking for a short time 
in a pail of water to which has been added a heaping teaspoonful of 
chloride of lime. Then hang in sun. Repeat if necessary. 

When frying potatoes, etc., try chopping with empty baking powder 
can instead of knife. You will find it much more handy and quicker. 

Try greasing cake and bread pans with a small five-cent paint brush. 
Keep grease in round tin can ; cut hole in cover and insert handle of 
paint brush when not in use. It is then always ready for use and does 
not soil hands. 

To prevent cake from burning when using new tins, butter the new 
tins well and place them in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes. After 
this the cake may be cooked in them without danger of burning. 

When ironing with gas, place a lid of the coal stove over the gas 
burners and place the irons over this. The irons will always be clean and 
heat much better than if they are put directly over the gas flame. 

To clean plaster of paris figures, use toilet soapsuds and a shaving 
brush. Rinse well. Dipping them in a strong solution of alum water 
will give them the appearance of alabaster. 

To preserve gilt frames, cover them when new with a coat of white 
varnish. All specks can be washed off with water without injury. 

To keep lemons, put them in water. Change once a week. Will 
keep a long time. 

Do You Know — 

That a small piece of butter added to the water prevents vegetables, 
macaroni or rice from boiling over? 

That the water from macaroni or rice after they have been cooked 
should be saved for soup and gravies? 

That a teaspoonful of vinegar added to boiled meat, while cooking, 
makes the meat tender? 

That after peeling onions if celery salt is rubbed over the hands 
before washing the odor will disappear? 

That if you add a pinch of salt to ground coffee before boiling it will 
improve the flavor? 

That if kid gloves are rubbed gently with bread crumbs after each 
time they are worn they will remain clean much longer than otherwise? 

That a poultice made of tobacco and warm water, put between two 
cloths and placed over the breast and pit of the stomach will relieve con- 
vulsions when nothing else will? It will do no harm.

That any one who has aching feet, if the feet are placed in kerosene 
for about ten minutes each day will receive the greatest relief. If used 
regularly for a month is said to cure all corns and callous places on the 
feet. Will not blister or do any injury. 

To relieve burns get a small bottle of picric acid and with a feather 
paint the burned or scalded parts, allowing it to dry. In a few minutes 
all the pain will be gone and you will never feel it again. Where the 
burns are very severe more than one application is sometimes necessary. 
This is an invaluable remedy, especially where there are children in the 
home, for they are getting burned continually. 

There is nothing better than sulphur tea for the hair. It cures dan- 
druff, promotes the growth, makes the hair soft and glossy and is very 
good to keep the hair from turning gray. 

The whitish stain left on a mahogany table by a jug of boiling water 
or a very hot dish may be removed by rubbing in oil and afterward 
pouring a little spirits of wine on the spot and rubbing it dry with a 
cloth. 

Place pieces of camphor, cedarwood, tobacco leaves, bog myrtle or 
anything else strongly aromatic in the drawers or boxes where furs or 
other things to be preserved from moths are kept, and they will never 
sustain any harm. 

Wash your weathered oak woodwork and furniture with milk. 

To rid your home of ants, which are numerous here in California; 
mix thoroughly two parts borax with one part powdered sugar and put 
around where the ants come. For two or three days the ants will come 
in swarms, but after that they will disappear. Leave the powder around 
for a week or two and you will never be bothered again with ants. 

If food becomes slightly burned in cooking, set the saucepan in cold 
water and it will take away burned taste. 

Silver knives, forks and spoons are worn out and scratched more in 
the washing than in their use. Buy a child's wooden pail, have a car- 
penter put cross pieces in it, dividing it into four compartments, one 
for knives, the second for forks, the third for tablespoons and the fourth 
for teaspoons. Make some hot, soapy water and pour into the pail. After 
gathering silver from table put them each in their own part of pail, 
leaving until ready to wash, then washing each lot separately. In this 
way they need less cleaning and are not scratched. 

To clean bathtub, wash bowl or toilet, use coal oil on cloth, then 
wash with hot water and soap. One can also clean their linoleum the 
same way very quickly. 

To stop nosebleed, no matter how severe, the following simple 
process will be found effective: Fold a small piece of paper several 
times and place in the upper part of the mouth between the lip and teeth.

A can of cholride of lime should always be kept around the kitchen 
sink ; if not only acts as a disinfectant, but is very useful for cleansing 
porcelain sinks. It will remove brown stains from the porcelain white- 
ware by putting about a tablespoonful in the vessel and filling with water 
and allowing to stand over night. Of course, the hands should not come 
in contact with the solution.
