BANKING BY MAIL 






A cook book is a very necessary article; 
so is a 

BANK BOOK 

A checking account with a bank is a 
convenience no housekeeper should 
be without. By paying your bills by 
checks you are enabled not only to 
keep your accounts straight, but you 
have receipts for all disbursements — in 
the cancelled checks which are re- 
turned to you. 

In our Savings Department interest at 
4 percent., (compounded and credited 
semi-annually) is allowed, and small 
deposits receive the same careful at- 
tention that is given to large ones. An 
invitation is extended to all to open an 
account with the

Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1908 by the Second Auxiliary Missionary 

Society of tlie Presbyterian Church of Warren, Pa., in the office of Librarian of 

Congress at Washington. 



PREFACE, ^^r 



The Second Auxiliary Missionary Society, formerly the Young 
Ladies' Missionary Society, of the Presbyterian Church of Warren, 
Pa., takes great pleasure in offering the third edition of '' The 
Warren Cook Book " to the public. 

For twenty years The Warren Cook Book has been a guide 
in many homes, receiving the highest commendation from those 
who have followed its directions. 

The demand for the book increases with each edition. The 
last edition, (less than five years old), has been carefully revised 
and enlarged and made up-to-date in every particular. 

The new book has behind it the experience of one hundred 
practical housekeepers. Each department has been compiled in a 
most careful manner by the person whose name appears at the head 
of the department. 

It is believed the new edition of The Warren Cook Book will 
meet the dem.inds of the average housekeeper better than many 
books which sell for double the price. 

The Society takes this opportunity to thank all its patrons 
of the past and to bespeak for the new book the generous support 
which has been accorded The Warren Cook Book in the years 
that have gone by.

SOUPS. xz 

SOUPS 

Mrs. H. A. Booth 

Nothing furnishes a bettrr foutidatioii t'of soup than a shank 
of beef; if veal is added the fiavor will be more delicate; the bones 
^broken in small pieces), are a valuable addition. Always put the 
meat to cook in cold water, for all the juices are required for the 
soup, and if the meat is put into boiling water the pores will be 
closed and the juices retained. Do not allow it to boii rapidly, but 
irt the kettle stand on the back part of the range and simmer slow- 
ly; remove the scum that rises to the top and add a little cold watei 
occasionally to keep it from boiling until it has been thoroughly 
skimmed and your soup will then be clear. A skillful cook will be 
careful that no pungent flavor predominates, but all are so blendea 
;is not to suggest any one in particular, except in cases where only 
the flavor of one vegetable is desired. When you can make a good 
stock you have the foundation of all soups and can have a new soup 
(•very day by adding different flavorings or vegetables. Be careful 
pbout the quantity of salt; remember it is easier to add than to take 
away that seasoning. 

SOUP STOCK. 

1 shin of beef. 5 quarts of cold water. 1 onion, 1 carrot. 1 tur- 
ni]). 2 bay leaves. 1 sprig of j^arsley. 12 cloves. 1 stalk celery, ] 
tal)lespoon salt. Lean, uncookc<l. juicy beef should t'onu the basis 
of your soup; wipe the meat well with a damp towel; now cut all 
the meat from the bones; place the bones in the bottom of a large 
kettle; lay the meat on top of them; add the water and stand the 
kettle on the back part of the range for an hour; then place it over 
-1 good fire; after about 80 minutes the scum of the meat will gather 
on the surface, and the Avater will begin to steam ; now place it over 
a more moderate fire; add 1 cup of cold water aiul skim off the 
scum; now cover the kettle closely and let it siiuiiu'i- (not boil) for 
•1 hours; then add the vegetables and simuici" one hour longer; then 
strain the stock through a fine sieve; add the salt and stand at 
once in a cold place. If you keep it in a warm i)lace it will not nuike 
a nice jelly. When cold take all the grease from the surface and it 
is ready for use. Mi-s. Rorer. 

WHITE SOUP STOCK. 

Select meat that is much fresher tiiaii for roasting. Cut tlie 
meat, about 4 poiuids of veal, Vi of which is Ijone, into several 
pieces; ])ut the whole into the soup kettle, and then add 2 (|1s. cold 
water, and heat, gradually, to the boiling iioint . LiM siiinncr tbre.^ 



18 THE WARKEN COOK BOOK 

or four hours; then add 1% teaspoons of salt, 8 or 10 peppercorns 
or a part of a sweet red-pepper pod, a sprig of parslej^ 3 or 4 cloves. 
V-2 l^^ay leaf, li/o teaspoons sweet herbs, and 2 tablespoons, each of 
chopped celery and onion. Continue the cooking until the meat is 
tender. Remove the meat for use in hash or other made dishes, 
and strain off the broth. There should be three pints or a little 
loss of broth. If there be more, let simmer until reduced to that 
quantity. A fowl cooked in the broth will make the broth mucli 
richer. It will be no detriment to the fowl to be thus cooked. 

Boston Cook Book, 

TO CLARIFY SOUP STOCK.

stock to boiling point, boil 2 minutes ; then cook gently 10 minutes ;

BLACK BEAN SOUP. 

1 pint of black beans; soak over night in 3 quarts cold water; 
in the morning pour off this water and add 3 quarts of fresh water ; 
boil gently 3 hours; when done there should be over a quart. Add

FISH 

Mrs. J. O. Parmlee 

Fish are easier of digestion but less nutritious than meats. To 
be eatable they should be perfectly fresh, those being most perfect 
which go straight from their native element into the hands of the 
cook. 

HOW TO TELL WHEN PERFECTLY FRESH. 

The eye should be clear, the gills red, the scales bright, the 
f.esh firm. After fish are dressed and cleaned, rinse thoroughly in 
cold water, using only what is necessary for perfect cleanliness, 
drain, wipe dry and place on ice until ready to cook. 

To remove the earthy taste from fresh water fish, especially 
bass, sprinkle with salt and let stand over night or a few hours be- 
fore cooking, rinse off and wipe dry. Fresh water fisb should never 
be soaked in water, except when frozen, when they may be placed 
in ice-cold water to thaw and then immediately cooked. 

Salt fish may be soaked over night in cold water (skin side up), 
changing water once or twice if very salt. Fish should always be 
well cooked, being both unpalatable and unwholesome when under- 
done. 

One of the most essential things in serving fish is to have 
everything hot and quickly dished, so that all may go to the table 
at once. 

The method of cooking which retains most nourishment is broil- 
ing, baking next and boiling poorest of all. Steaming is better than 
boiling. 

BAKED BLUEFISH. 

To bake a bluefish lay some slices of larding pork in the bottom 
of a baking pan ; over this sprinkle a large onion chopped fine ; put 
about 4 slices of bread on top of the chopped onion ; then lay the 
fish in, having had it dressed at the market for baking; slice the 
fish across the backbone in four or five places, and insert in each 
gash a piece of the larding pork; lay some strips of the pork over 
the surface of the fish; season well with salt and pepper; dredge 
with flour; cover the fish with another pan; stand it in a quick oven 
and bake till the flakes of the fish separate from the backbone ; then 
serve in the pan in which it is baked. Have a dish of quarters 
of lemon served with the fish. New boiled potatoes are the proper 
accompaniments to baked blue-fish. This baked fish with potatoes, 
followed by a salad of lettuce, green peppers and Spanish onions, 
makes an excellent dinner without anything else. 



26 THE WARREN COOK BOOK 



BAKED SALMON. 

Drain the liquor from one can salmon ; pick to pieces ; work in 
1 tablespoon melted butter, salt, pepper, 2 eggs, 1 cup bread crumbs, 
a little milk ; put in a buttered bowl or baking powder can ; set in 
pan of boiling water; cook in a hot oven 1 hour. 

SAUCE.

towel; rub it well with salt; make a dressing of 1 cap stale bread 
crumbs, 1 tablespoon chopped parsle\, salt, pepper arnl melted but- 
ter; stuff fish and sew it up with soft yarn. Now score one side of 
the fish about two inches apart, and put a strip of salt pork in each 
gash; place slices of pork on bottom of dripper and rest the fish on 
these; dredge thickly with salt, pepper and flour; bake in warm- 
oven fifteen minutes to every pound of fish ; garnish with lemon 
slices, potato balls and parsley. Mrs. Parmlee. 

SHAD ROE. 

Cover the roe with boiling salted water to which a teaspoon of 
■vinegar has been added and boil gently from eight to ten minutes. 
Remove from fire; drop into cold water and cool slightly; roll in a 
mixture of milk and egg and then in cracker crumbs ; fry in butter, 
seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve with a fish sauce or lemon 
points. Mr. John Schmutz.

remove ; slice over it two hard boiled eggs ; pour over drawn but- 
ter or a dressing made with a little milk and flour; garnish with 
parsley leaves. Mrs. T. W. McNett. 

BROILED FISH. 

This is one of the nicest ways qf cooking bluefish, mackerel, 
large trout, shad and white fish. Rub your broiler with a piece of 
suet before putting the flsh in . A fish weighing four pounds will 
take a half hour to cook over a moderate fire. When the fish is 
done, separate it carefully from the broiler with a knife, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper and spread with butter. It is now ready to 
serve. For broiling, the fish should be split down the back.

Mrs. Parker. 

LOBSTER. 

Never buy a dead lobster. The male is preferred; the female 
for sauces and soups. The female has a broader tail and less claws 
Ihan the male. If possible, always boil the lobster at home; but 
in some localities, where it is necessary to buy them boiled, see that 
the tail is stitf and elastic ; so that when you bend it out, it springs 
back immediately; otherwise they were dead before boiling. Lob- 
sters boiled when dead are watery and soft; they are very unwhole- 
some, even to a dangerous degree. 

TO OPEN A LOBSTER. 

Separate the tail from the body and twist off all the claws ; 
shake out carefully the tom-alley (this is the liver and may be known 
by its greenish color) ; also the coral. Then draw the body from 
the shell, remove the stomach, which is found immediately under 
the head and throw this away, now split the body through the cen- 
ter and pick the meat from the cells; cut the underside of the tail 
shell; loosen the meat and take it out in one solid piece; now split 
the meat of the tail open and you will uncover a little vein running 
its entire length; this remove. The vein is not always the same 
color; sometimes it is red; sometimes black and sometimes white; 
but in all cases it must be taken out and thrown away. The stom- 
ach or lady, the vein and the spongy fingers between the body and 
sliell, are the only parts not eatable. Crack the claws and take out 
the meat. Philadelphia Cook Book.

MINCED CLAMS. 

Open 25 clams, taking care to keep entire the same number of 
half shells; wash the clams; cut off the heads; split and scrape the 
necks and mince the entire clams very fine ; put them over the fire 
to stew in the strained .iuice which they yield while being opened. 
Meantime peel an onion, slice it thin; put it over the fire in 2 ounces 
of butter ; let it begin to turn yellow ; then stir smoothly into it 2 
ounces of flour, the minced clams and their broth : 1/2 pt. cream 
or milk ; 1 saltspoon of salt, V4 of a saltspoon each of grated nutmeg 
nnd white pepper, and a dash of cayenne; the mixture should be as 
thick as for ordinary croquettes, and if the clams do not yield suffic- 
ient juice, substitute milk for it ; let the mixture simmer where it 
will not burn for twenty minutes ; remove it from the fire ; stir into 
it the yolks of 8 raw eggs; put it into the clam shells; arrange them

toss in oysters; shake over fire until oysters are plump- season Avith 
salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon butter; serve on platter with tomato 
catsup. Mrs. Gruninger. 

PLANKED SHAD. 

This is the very best way of cooking shad : — The plank should 
be 3 inches thick, 2 feet long, li/o feet wide, and of well seasoned hick- 
ory or oak. Pine or soft wood gives the fish a woody taste. Take 
a fine shad just from the water; scale; split it down the back; clean 
it; wash well and wipe dry; dredge it with salt and pepper; place 
(he plank before a clear fire to get very hot; then spread the shad 
open and nail it skin next the hot plank with tacks; put it before 
the fire with the large end down. In a few minutes turn the board 
so that the other end will be down. To tell Avhen it is done pierce 
it with a fork; if the flesh be flakey. it is done. Spread with butter; 
serve on the plank or draw the tacks carefully, and slide the shad 
onto a hot dish. The white fish caught in the lakes when cooked in 
this manner are excellent. "Sirs,. Parker.

Mrs. F. P. Hue 

BEEF. 

The qviality of beef depends on the age of the creature, and man- 
ner of feeding". Good beef should be firm and of fine grained tex- 
ture, bright red in color, and well mottled and coated with fat. 
The fat should be firm, and of a yellowish color. Suet should be dry 
and crumble easily. Meat should be removed from paper as soon 
as it comes from the market, otherwise the paper absorbs some of the 
juice. 

Keep meat in a cool i)laee. Always wipe beef before cooking, 
with a cheesecloth wrung out of cold water, but never allow it to 
stand in cold water. Inattention to the temperature of the water 
and too early application of salt causes great waste in boiling meats. 
To make fresh meat rich and nutritious it should be placed in a ket- 
tle of boiling water, skimmed well as soon as it begins to boil again, 
and placed where it will slowly boil. Turn meat occasionally and 
keep well under water and fresh hot water supplied as it evapor- 
ates in boiling. Boil gently, as rapid boiling hardens the fiber and 
renders the meat hard and tasteless. No salt should be added until 
the meat is nearly done, as it extracts the juices if added too soon. 
Salt meats should be put on in cold water, so that it may freshen in 
cooking; as soon as water boils (if meat is very salt), replace by 
fresh cold water, the water being changed until it remains fresh 
enough to give meat a palatable flavor when done. Allow twenty 
minutes to the pound for fresh meats, and twenty-five for salt and 
smoked meats; the time to be modified, of course, by the quantity of 
meat. The broth of boiled meats should always be saved to use in 
soups, stews and gravies. A pod of red pepper in the water will 
prevent the unpleasant odor from filling the house. 

BEEFSTEAK BROILED. 

To cook a good, juicy steak never pound it, but slash it several 
times across each way ; lay upon a gridiron well greased : have a nice 
bright fire and broil quickly without burning; if the coals blaze from 
tlie drippings, sprinkle on a little salt, which will instantly extinguish 
the flames. Steak should be turned constantly while broiling, and to 
be rare should not cook over three minutes; butter, pepper and salt 
well after taking up. Serve on a hot platter. Mrs. W. W. 

BEEFSTEAK FRIED. 

Put the steak into a very hot frying pan; after it has remained 
a very few moments ; turn quickly several times. When done, put

SWEETBREADS. 

A sweetbread is the thymus gland of lamb or calf, but in cook- 
ery, veal sweetbreads only are considered. 

A sweetbread consists of 2 parts. The round, compact part is 
called the heart sweetbread, and is the most desirable. Sweetbreads 
spoil quickly. They should be removed from paper as soon as re- 
ceived, and plunged into cold water and allowed to stand one hour, 
drained and put into acidulated, salted, boiling water; cook slowly 
twenty minutes ; drain ; plunge into cold water that they may be 
firm and white. Sweetbreads are always parboiled in this way for 
further cooking. Mrs. Farmer. 

Sweetbreads are quite as. frequently employed as ingredients in 
sundry made dishes, as served alone and as they do not possess a 
very decided natural flavor they need to be accompanied by a high- 
ly seasoned sauce or they will taste rather insipid. They are in 
full season from May to August. 

SWEETBREADS LARDED. 

Boil twenty minutes; draw through each one thin slices of pork, 
dredge with salt, pepper and flour; bake twenty minutes in a quick

SAUCES 

STOCK. 

Stock is the basis of all meat sauces, soups and purees. It if 
really the juice of meat extracted by long and gentle simmering, and 
in making it, it should be remembered that the object to be aimed 
at is to draw the goodness of the material out into the liquor. It 



46 THE WARREN COOK BOOK 



may be prepared in various ways, richly and expensively or econ- 
omically. All general stocks, or stock which is to be used for mis- 
cellaneous purposes, should be simply made, that is, all flavoring in- 
gredients should be omitted entirely until its use is decided upon. 
The stock will keep longer than it would do if vegetables, herbs 
and spices were boiled in it, besides which the flavoring can be 
adapted to its special purpose. To ensure its keeping, stocks should 
be boiled and skimmed every day in summer and every other day in 
winter. The pan and lid used in iiaiking it should be scrupulously 
clean. Excellent stock is made constantly with the bones and 
trimmings of meat and poultry, with the addition, or not, of a little 
fresh meat, or a portion of extract of meat. A good cook will 
never be without stock as broken remnants of all kinds will find 
their way to the stock-pot, and will not be thrown away until, by 
gentle stewing they have been made to yield to the utmost what- 
ever of flavor and goodness they possessed. The liquor in which 
fresh meat has been boiled should always be used as stock.

POULTRY AND GAME. 51 



POULTRY AND GAME 

Mrs. L. G. Noyes 

Poultry includes all domestic birds suitable for food, except 
pigeon and squab, examples: — Chicken, fowl, turkey, duck, goose, 
etc. Game includes such birds and animals suitable for food as are 
pursued and taken in field and forest ; examples : — quail, partridge, 
Avild duck, plover, deer, etc. The flesh of game, with the exception 
of wild duck and wild geese is tender and contains less fat than 
poultry and is of fine flavor. Game meat is of dark color, partridge 
and quail being exceptions, and is usually cooked rare. 

The great secret of cooking game is constant basting, it should 
be under done, red in the middle full of gravy, but not raw. 

BOILED FOWL. 

Dress, clean and truss a fowl ; tie in a piece of cheesecloth, 
otherwise scum will settle on skin and discolor it; place in kettJe 
half surrounded with boiling water; cover; cook slowly until ten- 
der, turning occasionally; add salt the last hour of cooking; serve 
with egg, oyster, or celery sauce. 

ROAST CHICKEN. 

AVhen the chicken is nicely dressed fill it with a dressing made 
as follows : Take enough stale bread to fill the chicken and cut in 
very fine pieces; then i)ut in a spider with 2 tablespoons of butter 
and brown slightly ; when cool enough not to cook the egg, mix 3 
eggs and enovigh milk to moisten nicely; pepper and salt to taste, 
and for those Avho desire it, sage is an improvement ; put in the oven 
and roast until tender; baste often. Mrs. D. D. Reed. 

BROILED CHICKEN. 

Dress for broiling; sprinkle Avith salt and pepper and place in 
a well greased broiler; broil twenty minutes on a clear fire, turning 
so that all parts may be equally browned. The flesh side must be 
exposed to the fire the greater part of the time, as the skin side will 
brown quickly. Chickens are so apt to burn while broiling that 
many prefer to partially cook in oven ; place chicken in dripping- 
Xmn, skin side down; sprinkle with salt and pepper; dot over with 
butter; bake fifteen minutes in hot oven; then broil to finish cook- 
ing. 

MARYLAND CHICKEN. 

Dress, clean and cut up chicken; sprinkle with salt and pepper: 
dip in flour, egg and crumbs ; place in a well greased dripping-pan

minutes of cooking with % cup of nielte'd butter; serve with ereara 
and mushroom sauce. Miss Farmer 

PRESSED CHICKEN. 

An old chicken may be used for this. Place over a moderate 
fire and simmer gently until the meat falls from the bones; add 1 
teaspoonful of salt when about half done. When done take the 
meat from the bones and cut into small pieces ; put the skin and 
bones back into kettle and boil until the liquor is reduced to IV2 pts. ; 
then strain and season to taste with salt and pepper ; mix this with the 
chicken; pour the whole into a mould and stand in a cold place 
over night. A light weight may be placed on top to press it to- 
gether. Mrs. Rorer. 

CHICKEN TERRAPIN. 

Melt 3 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons flour, i/t teaspoon salt, 
a little pepper; add gradually 1 cup sweet milk; stir until it thick- 
ens ; then add II/2 cups of cooked chicken, cut fine, the yolks of 2 
hard-boiled eggs also cut fine, the whites cut in Yi inch pieces; cook 
two minutes longer and serve on toast. E. Detlefs. 

CHICKEN SMUTHERED IN MUSHROOMS. ^ 

Split 2 well grown, tender fowls down the back ; place them 
breast upwards in a dripping pan; pour over them a large cupful 
of boiling water in which has been melted 2 tablespoons of butter; 
cover closely and roast in a steady oven until they are tender all 
Ihrough and a light, even brown, about one hour is required : baste 
at least every ten minutes ; the two last times with clear butter ; dish ; 
keep hot while you make the gravy; use browned flour to thicken 
it and add 1 small can of mushrooms, cut up, each in three pieces; 
pour over the fowls and serve. Mrs. Mark Jamieson. 

CHICKEN a la PROVIDENCE. 

Prepare and boil a chicken following receipt for boiled fowl. 
The liquor should be reduced to 2 cups and used for making sauce 
with 2 tablespoons each butter and flour, cooked together; add to 
sauce 1/2 cup each of cooked carrots (cut in small pieces) and green 
peas; 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 2 eggs, salt and pepper; place chicken 
on hot platter, surround with sauce. Mrs. L. G. Xoyes. 

CAPONS. 

A caponed chicken is drawn, cleaned and singed in the sam(i 
way as a common chicken. It may be roasted or boiled or stuffed 
with truffles, according to the receipts given for turkey. A capon 
thus prepared makes a very recherche dish.

short and fat, with soft legs and feet. A¥hen the flesh turns dark, 
they are squabs no longer. Young pigeons are good eating; broil- 
ing is the most popular method of cooking squabs.

Dress the rabbit; wipe well inside and out with a wet cloth; 
then dry; cut down, splitting it into halves; then cut each into -1 
pieces; finish the same as Fricassee of Chicken. 

YOUNG HEN TURKEY. 

Young hen turkeys are best for roasting; the legs should be 
black, the skin white, the breast broad and fat. and the shorter the 
neck the better. In the legs of fowls are ten oi- more tough ten- 
dons, which in cooking, particularly in roasting, become hard and 
bony. In turkeys these tendons are especially large and objection- 
al)le. but if these be drawn and the leg skewered close to the body, 
to avoid drying, the drumstick becomes almost equal in tenderness 
and delicacy to the second joint, a thing greatly to be desired by 
all those who enjoy the rich, dark meat of the fowl. 

ROAST TURKEY WITH GIBLET SAUCE. 

Clean and prepare exactly the same as Roast Chicken, using 
double the amount of stuffing and roasting fifteen minutes to every

For a turkey weighing from 8 to 10 pounds, allow one loaf of 
stale bakers' bread. 1 (\t. of oysters, 1 Jeraon. 2 roots of celery and

oughly cleaned and wiped dry before putting the stuffing in ; crumble 
bread until very fine; season with pepper and salt; drain oysters, 
setting the liquor aside ; now take a very sharp knife and peel off 
the outer rind of the lemon, being careful not to have any of the bit- 
ter and tough white skin left on ; out the peel in very small bits : 
chop the Avhito part of the celery very fine, adding butter and juice 
of lemon ; stir until thoroughly mixed ; then proceed to stuff' body 
and crop. A turkey of the size spoken of requires at least two 
hours baking, and should be basted frequently; the liquor of the 
oysters should be put in the pan when the pan is first set in the 
oven and this is to be used in liasting. The <:ible-'s should 
be chopped fine and cooked in a basin on the top of the stove and 
when the gravy is made, add them to it. Mrs. Fred Sill.

bake in a quick oven fifteen minutes to every pound ; after one 
liour, cool the oven slightly; put 1 teaspoon of salt in the pan, and 
baste with melted butter every ten minutes at first, afterwards with 
its own gravy. Mrs Rorer, 



POULTRY AND GAME. 59

VEGETABLES 

Mrs. J. W. Kitchen 

Many green vegetables contain materials physiologically suited 
to our needs ; better by far take iron as contained in vegetable 
foods than from a bottle. People who cut from their diet the suc- 
culent vegetables are continually taking drugs to bring about the 
necessary natural conditions which might always be produced by 
the judicious and regular use of green vegetables. 

Mrs. Rorer says: "All vegetables should be put over the tiro 
to cook in actually boiling water. Green or top ground vegetables 
should have a teaspoonful of salt to each quart of water. Under- 
ground vegetables should be salted after they are tender. "' 

Mrs. Farmer of the Boston Cooking School says all vegetables 
should be cooked in boiling salted water, except peas and beans, 
which should be salted the last half hour. When noted teachers 
thus disagree the modern cook may decide for herself and use salted 
or unsalted boiling water for cooking vegetables as "experience, the 
dear teacher," may dictate. 

ARTICHOKES. 

After washing well, soak in cold water V-i hour; boil in plenty 
of water with a little salt l^A hours ; drain and serve with melted

spoon of flour mixed with a little milk and stir in; have toasted a 
few slices of bread ; spread with butter and put in a dish and over 
them turn asparagus and gravy. ]\Irs. T. AV. McNett. 

CREAMED ASPARAGUS.

SALADS AND DRESSINGS. 65 



SALADS AND DRESSING 

Mrs. E. E. Allen 

Salads made of greens slioiild always be served crisp and cold. 
The vegetables should be thoroughly washed, allowed to stand in 
cold or ice water until crisp, then drained and spread on a towel and 
set aside in a cold place until serving time. Dressings may be 
added at table or just before sending to table. If greens are allowed 
to stand in dressing they will soon wilt. It should be remembered 
that winter greens are raised under glass and should be treated as 
any other hot house plant. Lettuce will be affected by a change 
of temperature and wilt just as quickly as delicate flowers. 

Canned or cold cooked left over vegetables are well utilized in 
salads, but are best mixed wnth French dressing and allowed to 
stand in a cold place one hour before serving. Where several vege- 
tables are used in the same salad they should be marinated separ- 
ately, and arranged for serving just before sending to the table. 

Meat for salads should be freed from skin and gristle, cut in 
small cubes, and allowed to stand mixed with French Dressing be- 
fore combining with vegetables. Fish should be flaked or cut in 
cubes. 

Where salads are dressed at the table, first sprinkle with salt 
and pepper, add oil. and lastly, vinegar. If vinegar is added before 
oil, the greens will become wet. and oil will not cling, but settle to 
bottom of bowl. 

To Marinate : — The word marinate used in cookery, means to 
add salt, pepper, oil and vinegar to a salad ingredient or mixture 
and let stand until well seasoned.

BREAD 

Mrs. D. Cowan 



The old saying. "Broad is the staff of life" has sound reason in 
it. Good bread makes the homeliest me^l aeceptable, and the coars- 
est fare a])i)etizing, while the most luxurious table is not even tol- 
erable without it. Opinions as to what constitutes good bread 
diflFer. perhaps as much as tastes and opinions concerning anything 
else, but all will agree that bread to be good ought to be light and 
sweet — that is, free from any perceptible acid or yeasty taste — 
flaky, granular, or not liable to become a doughy mass and as white 
as the grade of flour used will allow. 

To obtain these qualities in bread, use the best flour. The 
best is cheapest. The Minnesota hard si)ring wheat is the equal of 
the best and is so much superior in strength that i/s less is used in 
all receipts for bread. No rule can be given bv which an inexper- 
ienced person can determine the grade of flour with accuracy, but 
a few hints will enable anyone to know what not to buy. Good 
flour adheres to the hand, and. when pressed, shows the imprint of 
the lines of the skin. Its tint is cream white. Never buy that 
which has a blue-white tinge. Poor flour is not adhesive, may be 
blown about easily, and sometimes has a dingy look. In no event 
should flour be used without being sifted. It seems like a simple 
process to make bread, but it requires a delicate care and watchful- 
ness. The process which raises bread successfully in winter, will 
often make it sour in the summer. One may have valuable recipes 
and well defined methods in detail, but nothing but experience will 
secure the name merited by so few although coveted by every prac- 
tical houskeeper, an excellent bread maker. Three things are indis- 
pensable to success, good flour, good yeast and watchful care. As a 
general rule one small teacup of yeast and 3 pts of "wetting will 
make sponge enough for 4 ordinary loaves of bread; or. if you pre- 
fer, a little more than 3 pts. of "wetting" and 1 compressed yeast 
cake will make the same amount. In all cases add the yeast last, 
making sure that the sponge is not hot enough to scald it. When 
]>laced to rise, cover closely. A temperature of eighty or ninety 
degrees is right. It is an improvement to beat the sponge thorough- 
ly for fifteen minutes. 

To make good bread always be up in morning early to prevent 
the sponge becoming sour by too long standing, and in winter to be 
getting materials warmed and in readiness for use. 



104 THE WARREN COOK BOOK 



THE SPONGE. 

This is made from warm water or milk, yeast and flour, (some 
add mashed potatoes), mixed together in the proportion of 1 pt. 
wetting, (water or milk), to 2 pts. sifted flour; when milk is used 
it must be first scalded and then cooled to blood heat. The scald- 
ing tends to prevent souring. If the wetting is too hot the bread 
will be coarse ; when water is used a tablespoon of lard or butter 
makes the bread more tender. Bread made from milk is of course 
more tender and nutritious and requires less flour and less knead- 
ing. "The Buckeye." 

YEAST. 

3 large, old potatoes pared, soaked and boiled until broken in 
small pieces ; % cup of loose hops boiled in 1 qt. of water ; drain and 
mash potatoes ; add the hop water and enough more hot water to make 
2 qts. ; strain, rubbing all the potato through ; put it on to boil, and 
when boiling add % of a cup of flour which has been wet to a 
smooth paste in cold water, and % of a cup of sugar ; boil five min- 
utes, stirring well ; let cool ; add % of a cup of yeast and when 
well risen add Y^ cup of salt; keep in a covered jar in a cool cellar. 
Bread made of this yeast will not sour even in hot weather. 

Mrs. "W. J. Alexander. 

YEAST. 

Take 12 large potatoes and boil in 2 qts. of water; when donii 
pour the water over 2 cups of flour; mash the potatoes and put in 
with the water and flour ; take 1 small handful of hops ; add boiling 
water ; boil a few minutes ; then strain into the mixture, and add 1 
cup of sugar and %, cup of salt ; when cool add 2 good yeast cakes. 
This will keep for weeks in a cool place. Mrs. M. I. Mead. 

YEAST. 

2 qts. of water, 3 handfuls of hops ; boil twenty minutes ; boil 6 
large potatoes in the hop water and when done mash them fine ; then 
add 1 cup of sugar, 2 tablespoons of ginger and 2 of salt ; when cool 
stir in 14 cup of good yeast ; keep it warm until it foams . 

Mrs. A. J. Collins. 

LIGHTNING YEAST. 

Mash fine 6 medium-sized boiled potatoes and mix with them 
1% tablespoons each of flour, salt and sugar; beat well together; then 
add 1/2 pt. boiling water; beat again and follow with a whole pint 
of boiling water; stir again and cool by adding 1 pt. of cold water; 
then add a cake of Yeast Foam which has been dissolved in 14 ^^^> 
of tepid water; let stand m a warm place about ten hours, after

which it is ready for use. Never set bread at night with this yeast, 
but in the morning take i/o yeast and V^ water (a pint of each makes 
2 loaves), add a pinch of salt, a tablespoon of sugar and a tablespoon 
of lard to each loaf: mix into ?. large loaf, moulding until it does not 
stick to the board ; keep in a warm place till light ; then mould into 
loaves; keep warm again until light enough for the oven; bake fifty 
or sixty minutes. The above amount of yeast is sufficient for three 
bakings of 2 loaves each, and should be kept in a cool place until 
used. If directions are followed this bread may be out of the oveu 
before 11 o'clock a.m. Mrs. F. M. Knapp.

tle salt ; let it get cool, and add 1 compressed yeast cake, previously 
soaked in 1/4 cup tepid water; it is now ready to sift in the wheat 
flour; keep sifting in the flour until stiff enough to mould on the 
board without sticking, (do not add flour after your bread is on 
the board, as that will spoil any bread) ; mould twenty minutes and 
then place in bread bowl and let rise until morning, in a warm room. 
In the morning mould down and shape into loaves, (do not mould 
only long enough to shape the loaves nicely), put into baking tins;

]Mrs. S. P. Schemerliorn. 

ENTIRE WHEAT BREAD . 

2 generous qts. of unsifted flour, IVU pts. Avarm water, 1 table- 
spoon butter, 1 tablespoon sugar. Vo tablespoon salt, H cake com- 
pressed yeast or 1/0 cup home-made yeast. 

This will make 2 loaves of bread and a pan of rolls. Many peo- 
ple confound entire wheat flour with graham, but it is very differ- 
ent. Graham is a coarse-ground wheat meal; entire wheat flour is 
the whole wheat-^with the coarse husk discarded, of course — ground 
to a fine flour. It gives a brown loaf or roll, but a delicious one^ 
smooth and fine. 

After sifting the flour into a bread bowl, put aside a cupful for 
use in kneading the bread later, and put the sugar and salt with the 
remainder. If the yeast be compressed, dissolve it in a small quan- 
tity of water ; pour the remaining water and the yeast into the bowl, 
and finally add the butter, somewhat softened by standing in a warm 
place for a while ; beat the dough vigorously with a strong spoon, 
and when it gets smooth and light, sprinkle a moulding board with 
a part of the flour that was reserved, and turn the dough out upon 
the board ; knead until smooth and elastic, say from twenty minutes 
to 1/2 an hour ; then return to the bowl, and after covering first with 
a clean towel and then with a tin or wooden cover; let it rise for 
about eight hours in a temperature of about 70 degrees. If the tem- 
perature be lower than 70 degrees, more time will be required for the 
rising, and, of course, if it will be higher, less time will be needed. 

If the dough be mixed in the morning and kept for four or five 
hours in a temperature of 80 or 90 degrees, it will be in a condition 
for baking in the afternoon. When it has risen, butter lightly 2 
bread pans and 1 roll pan. Make enough rolls to fill the pan. shap- 
ing them with the hands: then put the remainder of the dough on a

till they are double their original size; then bake in a moderate oven 
— the rolls for % hour and the bread for one hour.

kneading in the bowl, (but not on the board) ; when thoroughly 
mixed set aside to get very light ; then roll out to about "^^ inch in 
thickness ; spread abundantly with sugar and butter previously mixed 
together; then sprinkle lightly with cinnamon; roll up like a jelly 
roll and cut off from either end with a sharp knife about 1 inch for 
each bun; place in biscuit tin (close together) and spread with but- 
ter and sugar; sprinkle with cinnamon; let rise until very light, and 
bake in a quick oven from ten to fifteen minutes. In doubling this 
recipe 1 large egg is sufficient. Mrs. Dwight Cowan.

GRIDDLE CAKES. 

In cooking pancakes and waffles, be sure to use only enough 
grease to keep them from sticking to the griddle or waffle iron. 
Have the griddle hot ; cook the cakes until the edges are full of bub- 
bles ; then turn. If doughey inside, the griddle is too hot; if 
leathery and heavy, not hot enough. A teaspoon of brown sugar 
will make cakes brown nicely. The addition of some soaked bread 
crumbs, mashed fine, or a little cold rice soaked in milk until soft, 
makes them very tender and delicious. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES.

milk to the right consistency and add 1 teaspoon soda ; bake on a 
hot griddle. Mrs. Bettis. 

Buckwheat batter can be kept perfectly sweet by pouring cold 
water over that left from one morning, and which is intended to be 
used for raising the next morning's cakes. Fill the \'essel entirely 
full of water and put in a cool place; when ready to use, pour off 
the water, which absorbs the acidity.

ency for baking on a hot griddle. ]\Irs. Lizzie Garfield. 

GRIDDLE CAKES. 

Enough flour is added to a qt. sour milk to make a rather thick 
batter. The secret is, that it is left to stand over night instead of 
being finished at once. It may stand to advantage 24 hours. Next 
morning add 2 well beaten eggs, and salt, also I/2 teaspoon soda dis- 
solved in warm water. Bake at once. Mrs. Boyce.

CHAFING DISH 

Miss Mary White 

The chafing dish, wliieh, within the last few years has gained so 
much favor, is by no means a utensil of modern invention, as its his- 
tory may be traced to the time of Louis XIV. 

The simple tin chafing dishes may be bought for as small a 
sum as 90 cents, while tJie elaborate silver ones command as high a 
price as $100. Very attractive ones are made of granite ware, nickel 
or copper. The latest patterns have a screw adjustment to regulate 
the flame and a metal tray on which to set the dish. 

A chafing dish has 2 pans, the under one for holding hot water, 
the upper one with long handle for holding food to be cooked. A 
blazer differs from a chafing dish, inasmuch as it has no hot w^ater 
pan. Wood alcohol is often used instead of the high proof spirits. 

List of dishes previously given that may be prepared in the 
chafing dish : Eggs and Cheese, Egg Fondue, Scrambled Eggs with 
Tomato, Creamed Fish, Creamed Chicken, Fish on Toast, Barbecued 
Ijamb, Frizzled Beef, Creamed Beef. Creamed Sweetbreads. Veal on 
Toast. 

» CURRIED EGGS. 

Melt 2 tablespoons butter; add 2 tablespoons flour mixed with 
1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2, teaspoon curry powder and % teaspoon paprika ; 
stir until well mixed; then pour in gradually 1 cup milk; add 3 
hard-boiled eggs cut into eights lengthwise, and re-heat in sauce. 

Mary L. White. 

EGGS WITH CHEESE. 

For 5 eggs use 2 tablespoons grated cheese, 1 tablespoon butter, 
salt ancl pepper to taste; melt the butter; add the eggs; then the 
cheese, stirring until thick and smooth in a chafing dish. 

FRUIT WITH ORANGE SAUCE. 

Put into the chafing dish 1 cup of orange juice and ""^ cup sugar ; 
moisten 1 level teaspoon of arrowroot in a little cold water; when 
the juice is hot add to it the arrowroot and cook until thick ; then 
add 1/4 cup candied cherries, and 3 oranges peeled and separated into 
small pieces ; cook for three minutes and serve. Mrs. Roy. 

FUDGE. 

Melt 1 tablespoon butter; add %, cup milk and l^/o cups sugar; 
stir until sugar is dissolved; then add 5 tablespoons prepared cocoa

Layer Cakes, Fillings and Frostings 

Mrs. William Hammond 

To insure success in the making of any kind of cake, use none 
but the best ingredients; then exercise great care and judgment in 
the mixing and baking. 

The essentials for good cake are fresh eggs, fine granulated 
sugar, pastry flour and best butter. 

To mix butter cakes, measure dry ingredients and mix and sift 
baking powder and spices, if used, with the flour. Break each egg 
separately, thus avoiding loss should a stale egg chance to be found 
among the number, separating the whites from yolks, if the rule so 
specifies. 

Measure butter, then liquid. Place the butter which should be 
soft, but not melted, together with the sugar in an earthen bowl; 
rub together until creamy, add yolks of eggs or whole eggs, beaten 
until light, liquid, and flour mixed and sifted with baking powder. 
When whites alone are used fold into the batter the last thing be- 
fore baking. 

Cake can be made fine grained only by long beating. Do not 
stir, but beat thoroughly, bringing the batter up from the bottom 
of the dish at every stroke, thus driving the air into the cells of 
the batter. Unskilled mixing, too rapid or unequal baking, or a 
sudden decrease in heat before it is quite done, will cause streaks 
in the cake. Fruit, when added to a cake, is usually floured to pre- 
vent settling to the bottom. Raisins should be seeded, then cut with 
scissors, rather than chopped. 

Grease the pans with melted butter, lining the bottom with thin 
paper, taking care that it does not project over the sides. In 
filling^ the pans, have the mixture come well to the corners and sides 
of the pans, so that when the cake is baked it will be perfectly flat 
on top. The baking of cake is quite as important a feature as mix- 
ing. • Many a well mixed cake has been spoiled in the baking. Ex- 
perience alone can teach one what the temperature of the oven 
should be for the different cakes. Cake should be watched closely 
while in the oven, opening and shutting the door carefully. Do not 
move the cake in the oven unless positively necessary, then do it 
gently. When done cake shrinks from the pan, and in most cases 
this is sufficient test, but if in doubt try with a broom splint and 
if the dough does not adhere, it is done. When removed from the 
oven, allow it to stand five minutes; then invert the pan on a board 
covered with fibre paper, and the cake will fall out. If the cake is 
inclined to stick to the sides, loosen with a knife before inverting. 
Allow the cake to cool before icing. Mrs. Hammond.

SUNSHINE CAKE. 

AVhites of 11 eggs, lVi> t-'iips gi-uiiulated sugar, 1 cup flour, 1 
teaspoon cream of tartar, little salt, 1/9 teaspoon Royce's vanilla, 
yolks of 5 eggs. The secret in this cake is to have the eggs fresh 
and cold: measure flour after sifting once; sift flour, sugar and 
cream of tartar together four or five times, so they will be light 
and well mixed; break the eggs, whites only, onto a large platter 
or bowl ; beat thorn with the salt to a stiff dry froth ; add the va- 
nilla ; then sift the flour in a little at a time, and stir but do not 
beat. AVe call it folding; beat the yolks of 5 eggs very light and 
fold into the cake; use a tin with removable bottom, and legs, and 
never grease such a tin for cake of any kind; bake about one hour 
in a moderate oven. If the oven bakes fast on the top put paper 
over it and put a couple of tin cans in the oven to hold the paper 
up, so the cake, as it rises, wnll not touch the paper. Do not open

COFFEE . 

Coffee for family use should be bought in small quantities, 
freshly roasted and if one has a coffee mill, ground at home as need- 
ed, because after being ground unless kept air tight, it quickly de- 
teriorates. If not bought in air tight cans with tight fitting cover, 
it should be emptied into canister as soon as brought from the gro- 
cer's. 

Coffee may be served as filtered coffee, infusion of coffee, or de- 
coction of coffee. Commonly speaking, boiled coffee is preferred, 
and is more economical for the consumer. According to the way in 
which it is to be made, coft'ee is ground fine, medium and coarse. In 
making filtered coffee it should be ground fine, for boiled, coarse or 
medium . 

FILTERED COFFEE. 

I cup finely ground coft'ee, 6 cups boiling water; place coffee 
in strainer, strainer in coffeepot, and pot on the range ; add gradual- 
ly^ boiling water and allow it to filter; cover between additions of 
water. If desired stronger, re-filter ; serve at 02ice with cut sugar 
and cream ; put sugar and cream in cup before hot coffee. If creairi 
is not obtainable, scalded milk may be substituted. 

Mrs. Farmer in Boston Cook Book. 

BOILED COFFEE. 

II tablespoons coffee, 1 egg, 10 cups water (boiling) ; beat the 
egg; add a. little cold water and mix with the coffee; turn into coffee 
pot; pour on boiling water and stir thoroughly; boil for three min- 
utes ; place on back of the stove for ten minutes, where it will keep 
hot but not boil ; serve at once. Mrs. Rankin. 

TO MAKE COFFEE FOR ONE. 

Allow 2 tablespoons ground coffee to 1 cup of cold water; add 
coffee to cold water; cover closely and let stand over night. In the 
niorning bring to boiling point. 

AFTER DINNER COFFEE. 

For after dinner coffee use twice the quantity of coffee, or half 
the amount of liquid given in other recipes ; serve in after dinner 
coffee cups, with or without cream and sugar.

BRAN COFFEE. 

8 cups clean wheat bran (get at a mill), 2 cups oat flake, 1 cup 
corn meal; mix together; then stir in % cup Porto Rico molasses; 
mix with hands like pie crust to aovid having it lumpy; put in drip- 
per and place in a hot oven; stir every five or ten miinites for IV2 
or 2 hours, when it will be a nice brown. Be careful to avoid burn- 
ing. 

BRAN COFFEE. 

Use a tablespoon of the above mixture to a person, and put in 
a tarleton bag in either hot or cold vv^ater. A bit of butter size of 
bean will prevent boiling over. Let boil at least i/> hour. This coffee 
warmed over is even better than at fii'st. ]\[rs. J\I. J. Danfnrth. 

TEA. 

Black Tea is made from leaves which have been allowed to fer- 
ment before curing. Green Tea is made from unfermented leaves 
artificially colored. Freshly boiled water should be used for nuiking 
tea. Boiled, because below the boiling point the stimnlating prop- 
.-i'ty, theine, would not be e;ctraeted. Freshly boiled, because lon^ 
cooking renders it flat and insipid to taste on accpunt of escape of 
its atmospheHc gases. Tea should always be infused, never boiled. 
Long steeping destroys the delicate flavor by developing a larger 
amount of tannic acid. 

HOW TO MAKE TEA. 

3 teaspoons tea, 2 cups boiling water; scald an earthen or china 
tea pot: put in tea, and pour on l)oiling water; let it stand in a 
^varm place for five minutes. 

i\rrs. Farmer in Boston Cook Book. 

RUSSIAN TEA. 

Follow recipe for making tea. Russian tea may he served hot 
or cold, but always without milk. A thin slice of lemon, from which 
seeds have been removed, or a few drops of lemon jnice is allowed 
for each cup; sugar is added according to taste. Each cup can also 
be garnished with a preserved strawberry or a candied cherry.

HOW BOILED WATER MAY BE MADE PALATABLE. 

FIRST, Take exactly 2 gallons of water. If the water is not 
clear, beat up the white of 1 egg and add to the water before boil 
uig. This will gather up every particle of foreign matter in the 
water and carry it to the bottom of the vessel. The water should he 
1)rought to a brisk boil and then stood aside to cool and settle. 

SPjCOND, Pour off the clear water and stir into it a level tea- 
spoon of bicarbonate of soda ; then stir in % teaspoon of hydrochloric 
acid. This will make the water perfectly safe, sparkling and re- 
freshing without any flat taste. Cassius Gillette. 
Chief of the Bureau of Filtration of Philadelphia. 



ICE CREAM, ICES, ETC. 205 



ICE CREAM, ICES, ETC. 

Mrs. A. R. Blood 

Under frozen dishes we include : 

Ice Cream — Thin cream or custard foundation, sweetened, flavor- 
ed and frozen. 

Water-ice — Any fruit juice, diluted with water, sweetened and 
frozen . 

Sherbet — AYater Ice to which has been added gelatine or whites 
of eggs. 

Frappe — Water Ice frozen only to the consistency of mush. 

JNIousse or Parfait — Cream, whipped, flavored and sweetened, 
placed in moulds, packed in ice and salt and allowed to stand three 
or four hours. 

DIRECTIONS FOR FREEZING DESSERTS. 

Frozen dishes are perhaps the easiest desserts to be prepared if 
one is provided with a good freezer, ice shave, or burlap bag and axe, 
sufficient ice and coarse salt. Snow may be used instead of ice, but 
as it is not easily acted upon by the salt, pour water upon the snow 
and salt until it is slushy. Never draw off the salt water until the 
mixture is frozen unless there is danger of its getting into the can, 
for this salt water is what effects freezing. 

Shave ice, or if you haven't an ice shave, put the ice in a burlap 
bag and pound it fine with the broad side of an axe. Adjust can con- 
taining mixture to be frozen in the wooden tub, fasten the crank, 
and give it a turn to see that the can fits in the socket. Allow three 
measures of ice to one of salt for ice cream, sherbet or water ice, 
while equal parts of ice and salt should be used for freezing frappe, 
and packing mousse or parfait. If only a small quantity is to be 
frozen, the ice and salt need come but little higher in the tub than 
the mixture in the can, otherwise fill tub to top of can. As the mix- 
lure increases in bulk when freezing, the can should never be more 
than 34 filled. Turn the crank slowly and steadily until it goes pret- 
ty hard. After mixture is partly frozen the crank may be turned 
more rapidly. Add more ice and salt as needed. In freezing water 
ices turn the crank slowly for a few minutes, then rest for about five 
minutes, turn slowly again and again rest. Continue this until the 
water ice is frozen quite hard. It requires a much longer time to 
freeze water ice than ice cream. If you are making a sherbet in- 
stead of a water ice turn dasher rapidly until the mixture is frozen 
pretty hard. After mixture is frozen, draw off water; remove 



206 THE "WARKEN COOK BOOK 

dasher ; with a large wooden spatula scrape the cream from the sides 
of the can, then beat and work it for a number of minntes ; put lid 
on the can, with a cork in the opening; repack with icf and salt, us- 
ing now four measures of ice to one of salt; cover the tub with a 
piece of carpet or with newspapers and set away for one or two hours 
to ripen. Water ices and sherbets should be given three or four 
hours for this ripening process, by which we mean the blending of 
the different ingredients. When ready to serve, dip can in cold 
water, wipe, then turn cream out on a dish. If you wish to mould 
the frozen mixture, do not freeze too hard. Fill the mould or form 
with the mixture, being careful to fill every part of the mould. Cover 
with buttered paper, buttered side up. Put on cover and press down.

FOOD FOR THE SICK. 2 1 1 



FOOD FOR THE SICK 

Mrs. W. S. Pierce 

i\Iany persons think that the more they eat the more strength 
they will have, forgetting that they are only able to assimilate the 
amount of necessary nourishment and all over this is worse than 
-wasted, for it clogs the system in its removal. It was Balzac who 
said, "if there is anything sadder than unrecognized genius, it Is 
a misunderstood stomach."' 

Statistics jirov.e that % of all disease is brought about by er- 
ror in diet. The correct proportions of food-principles have n(jt 
been maintained, or the food has been improperly cooked. Physic- 
ians agree, with but few exceptions, that the proper preparation of 
food for the sick is of as great importance in the restoration to 
health as administration of drugs. Time and manner of serving are 
of ecpial importance. Take especial care in setting an invalid's tray 
Cover with a spotless tray-cloth or napkin. Avoid having too mam 
things on the tray at one time. Salt may appear, but pepper never 
Foods which are intended to be served hot should be placed in heat 
ed dishes and kept covered during transit from kitchen. Equal care 
i-hould be taken to have cold foods served cold. Serve in small quan- 
tities. The sight of too much food often destroys the appetite. 

If patient is restricted to milk diet and milk is somewhat objec- 
tionable, it may be tolerated by serving in different ways, such as 
koumiss, albumenized milk, or by adding Apollinaris, seltzer water 
or rennet. 

BARLEY WATER AND RICE WATER. 

Are generally used to reduce a laxative condition. Toast water 
is often useful in cases of extreme nausea. Fruit waters are princi- 
])ally used for fever patients. They are cooling, refreshincr ai>d mdd- 
I> stiDinlating and vahi;ible fur the salts and acids they (Contain. 
Beef essence, which is the expressed juices of beef, being nutritious, 
is given when a condensed form of food is necessary. Beef tea con- 
tains the juices 01 beef diluted Avith water, and is given as a stim- 
ulant, rather than a nutrient, as is generally supposed. 

Egg-nogs are recommended where it is necessary to take a 
large amount of nutriment daily, as is often the case after a severe 
illness. 

Corn and oatmeal gruels are heat producing and should never 
be given when inflammatory syii^ptoms are present. 

ArroAvroot makes a delicate gruel and is more easily digested 
than anv other form of starch. Tt should never be given to infants. 



2 1 8 THE WARREN COOK BOOK. 

Foods should be nutritious, easy of assimilation, in small quan- 
tities, at regular intervals. After the completion of a meal, the tray 
should be removed at once, from the sick room, milk should be cov- 
ered while in the room and if any is left in the glass it must be 
thrown away.

BEEF TEA. 

Beef tea is the juice of the beef diluted with water. Care should 
be exercised in the selection of the beef as it should be juicy and of 
good flavor. The back and middle of the rump and the top of th-;

be used. 1 pound of lean steak ; remove all fat, skin and membrane ;

JELLIES 

Mrs. C. H. Smith 

Jellies are made from fruit juice and sugar in nearly all cases 
proportions being equal. When failures occur, they may usually 
be traced to the use of too ripe fruit ; or a damp atmosphere. If a 
possible thing, try and make it on a clear day. 

To Prepare Glasses — AVash and put on back of range to get 
hot, or wipe them from hot water when jelly is almost finished. 

To Cover Jelly Glasses — Melt parafine wax; put one large 
tablespoon over each top after jelly is perfectly cold — cover with the 
regular top or paper and plainly mark each glass and set in cold, 
but dry place. 

Always heat your sugar before adding it to the hot juice ; put 
it in a granite dish, or a dripper; put in the oven lea\ing the door 
open and stir occasionally. 

To Make Jelly Bag — Fold two opposite corners of cheese cloth 
or cotton and wool flannel 44 yards long: sew up in form of a corn- 
ucopia, rouuding at the end: fell or French seam to make strong; 
bind the top with tape and finish with two or three loops. 

BAR-le-DUC JELLY. 

This jelly requires time and patience, but amply repays the 
maker for her trouble, if made in small quantities, and is much less 
expensive than the imported article. Either white or red currants 
may be used, not over-ripe. Stem and wash the currants ; spread 
on a soft towel ; cover with another towel, and pat gently to remove 
all moisture. Now take an ordinary unused steel pen ; open each 
currant and scoop out the seeds and juice into a bowl; save the 
skins in another bowl. To % bowl of juice and seeds, add H bowl 
(.f currants unseeded ; mash and put on to boil. When hot. add one 
bowl and a quarter of granulated sugar ; boil ten minutes and strain 
through a fine wire sieve. Now add a good half bowl of currant 
skins to the syrup thus formed and boil slowly about fifteen min- 
utes. A few seeds will adhere to the skins, but do not attempt to 
remove them all, as it would crush the skins too much ; pour into 
jelly glasses. When set, cover with parafine. This makes five or 
six glasses. Mrs. W. D. Hinckley.

CANNED FRUITS AND PRESERVES 229 

Canned Fruits and Preserves 

Mrs. C. L. Clough 

Fruit for canning should be fresh, firm, of good quality, and not 
over-ripe. If over-ripe, some of the spores may survive the boiling, 
then fermentation will take place in a short time. 

For canning fruit, use % as much sugar as fruit and 2I/2. to 3 
cups water to each pound of sugar; make a syrup of the sugar and 
water cooking ten minutes ; add a small quantity of the fruit at a 
time ; by so doing, fruit may be kept in perfect shape. Fill sterile 
jars with fruit, and enough syrup added to overflow jars. If there 
is not sufficient syrup, add boiling water, as jars must be filled to 
overflow. Introduce a spoon between fruit and jar, that air bubbles 
may rise to the top, quickly put on rubber and screw on sterilized 
covers, being sure that the jars are air tight. 

PRESERVING, — Use % or equal amount of sugar with fruit. 
Large fruit may be left whole or cut in halves. 

TO STERILIZE JARS. 

"Wash jars and fill with cold water: place in a large kettle and 
surround with cold water ; heat gradually to boiling point ; remove 
from water, empty, and fill while hot with fruit ; place tops in water 
to sterilize; dip rubbers in hot water, but do not allow them to stand. 
New rubbers should be used each season, and care must be taken that 
rims of covers are not bent, as jars cannot then be hermetically 
sealed. 

SMALL FRUITS. 

Be careful in selection of fruits; remove stones or hulls, if any; 
put in porcelain kettle with granulated sugar on top in the propor- 
tion of ] cup of sugar to 1 qt. of fruit ; let stand for an hour or sn 
as this keeps fruits whole ; set on stove with a little water in the bot- 
tom, to prevent burning stir up from bottom once or twice; boil five 
or six minutes. Mrs. W. D. Hinckley. 

AMBROSIA. 

1 bowl of grated pineapple, 2 bowls of mashed strawberries. 3 
bowls of granulated sugar; mix together and boil slowly till thick; 
then pour into jelly glasses and seal with parafine. If pineapple 
flavor is liked best use two bowls of pineapple and 1 of berries.

see when tender ; should not boil more than two or three minutes ; 
as fast as the pieces are tender put them into hot cans and cover with 
boiling syrup from the other kettle; seal can and proceed in the same 
manner with rest. It is not best to cook more than enough to fill 2 
or 3 cans at a time. Always run a silver fork handle down inside 
the can two or three times to let out air bubbles. Plums and cherries 
may be put up in the same way, allowing them to cook until skins

CANNED VEGETABLES. 23? 

CANNED VEGETABLES 

Mrs. W. E. Rice 



Fruits and vegetables to be sterile must be thoroughly heated. 
All jars and covers must be sterile and the housewife must observe 
surgical cleanliness. 

If the housewife understands the real definition of sterilization, 
the canning of vegetables becomes an easy process. Peas, corn and 
beets contain sugar which furnish nourishment and food for yeast 
plants and bacteria, which make them more difficult to keep than 
fruits rich in acids. 

Young lima beans, young green peas and sweet corn are easily 
dried and are much more palatable than those canned, if properly 
soaked and carefully cooked. 

Dried cabbage, spinach, cauliflower and beets are sold by lirst- 
class grocers. 

Eggs are dried to use in winter when eggs are scarce and ex- 
pensive. Mrs. Rorer. 

ASPARAGUS. 

Wash, trim, cover Avith boiling water; boil rapidly for fifteen 
minutes ; then drain and arrange, heads up, in wide-mouthed jars. 
Adjust rubbers, fill the jars to overflowing with water (that has been 
boiled and cooled) ; add a teaspoon salt and lay on rubbers and lids 
loosely. Stand the jars in the boiler on top of rack, surround half 
way with cold water; cover the boiler; bring quickly to boiling 
point and boil for liA hours; lift out 1 jar at a time; ouickly fasten 
or screw down top without lifting it from the jar; keep protected 
from draught until cool. 

BEETS. 

AVash young beets; throw into boiling water and cook for Vo 
hour; remove skins; pack the beets in jars; add i/^ pt. vinegar to a 
qt. water (that has been boiled and cooled) : fill the jars and cook % 
(if an hour; follow directions for Asparagus. 

STRING BEANS NO. I. 

String and cut the beans; put them into the cans and fill cans 
full of cold water ; steam three hours ; remove cover and put on rub- 
ber; steam one hour and seal without removing cover. 

Mrs. W. D. Hinckley. 



256 THE WARREN COOK BOOK 



STRING BEANS NO. II. 

Wash and cut beans in inch pieces; fill jars with beans and 
place under faucet ; let cold water flow freely on them until jars are 
full ; put rubbers and covers on jars ; fasten loosely ; use boiler or 
steamer and steam 3i/o hours ; seal without removing cover. If boil- 
er is used, put shingles or board in bottom of boiler, on which place 
jars and fill boiler with cold water until jars are % covered. 

LIMA BEANS. 

Wash, shell and fill jars and place under running water and 
steam like string beans.

TOMATOES. 

Scald and pare tomatoes; cut large ones in quarters and 
small ones in halves ; add salt to suit taste ; cook only from three to 
five minutes, after they come to a boil ; can and seal while hot. Tin 
cans are best, and if care is taken to empty, wash and dry thorough- 
ly as soon as opened for use, the cans may be used with safety for 
4 or 5 years. Mrs. J. Gleave. 

TOMATOES. 

Follow above directions, omitting the salt, place in sterilized 
glass jars, using new rubbers, seal quickly. Keep in a cool dark place.

PICKLES. 239 

PIC LKES 

Mrs. T. S. McNett 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

In making pickles use none but the best cider vinegar, and boil 
in a porcelain kettle — never in metal. A small lump of alum dis- 
solved and added when scalding pickles the first time, renders them 
crisp and tender, but too much is injurious. Keep in glass or stone- 
ware; look at them frequently and remove all soft ones; if white 
specks appear in the vinegar; drain off and scald, adding a liberal 
iiandful of sugar to each gallon, and pour again over the pickles ; 
liits of horserdish and a few cloves assist in preserving the life of the 
vinegar. If put away in large stone jars, invert a saucer over the 
top of the pickles, so as to keep well under the vinegar. The nicest 
way to put up pickles is bottling, sealing while hot, and keeping in 
a cool, dark place. Many think that mustard (the large white or 
mellow) improves pickles, especially those chopped and bottled, and 
mangoes. Never put up pickles m any thinir that has held any kind 
of Grrease. and ne\'f'r let them freeze. T'se an oaken tub or cask for 
pickles in brine, keep them well under, and have more salt thaji will 
<lissolv(\ so that there will always be plenty at the bottom of the 
cask. All pickles should be kept from the air as much as possible. 
In making sweet pickles, use best brown sugar, "Coffee C," or good 
maple sugar.

DIRECTIONS FOR PULLING CANDY. 

('andy to be pulled must l)e eooked until it is brittle wlien cool, 
therefore, the i)ulling must bejrin with the first hardening of the 
edges of the candy in the buttered pans ; work steadily, adding a lit- 
tle at a time as it cools sufficiently until it is all taken up. If the 
warmth of the hands is not sufficient work over a stove, as keeping 
the candy warm facilitates the process. Faithful work for V^ hour, 
never less time, makes the candy light, smooth, brittle, yet with that 
melting quality so desirable. Mrs. Jane Orr.

TO REMOVE STAINS FROM LINEN. 

BERRY STAINS. — Place garment over pan and slowly pour 
on boiling water until the stain disappears. 

TEA, COFFEE AND CHOCOLATE STAINS.— If cold water 
fails to remove, dip in diluted javelle water, which like oxalic acid 
solution, should always be kept on hand. See recipes below. 

PEACH, PEAR AND GRAPE STAINS require acid. Use Oxalic 
Acid Solution on stains, being careful to rinse well in water as soon 
as stain disappears, as the acid will eat linen if not well rinsed out. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 263 



MILDEW will disappear if persistently wet in buttermilk and 
laid in the sun, but it is easier to use chloride of lime. Put a little 
lime in cold water and stir until dissolved; then strain through cheese 
cloth and pour over stained spots; watch carefully and as soon as 
bleached out, rins(> in 8 oi- 4 waters to remove every particle of lime. 

INK STAINS shouUl l)e soaked in fresh milk or washed in salt 
and water and then sponged with lemon juice. Vinegar will take ink 
out of carpets. Peroxide Hydrogen is used successfully in cciiioving 
ink from colored goods. 

IRON RUST. — Dissolve a teaspoon of salt in a tablespoon or 
more of lemon juice and apply to stain, then hang in the sun. Sev- 
eral applications may bo necessary 'before the stain is entirely re- 
moved. 

GRASS STAIN. — Either alcohol or molasses will remove grass 
stain. Lard is also used successfully. 

]\IACHINE OIL OR VASELINE.— Rub with soap and cold 
water. Hot water sets the stain. 

TAR. — Vse kerosene oil. or rub lard well into the tar; tlien i-iil) 
with soap and hot water. 

STAINS OF LONG STANDING.— Wet in cold water; dip in 
javelle water for a minute or two ; then rinse in several waters ; dry 
in the sun. If this fails the oxalic solution given below is infallil)le. 

PAINT STAINS that are dry and old may bo romovcd from cot- 
ton or woolen goods Avith chloroform. 

BLOOD STAINS may in most cases be removed b,v soaking in 
cold water with a little salt in it. 

JAVELLE WATER. — Put 2 pounds of salsoda in a large granite 
pan or stone jar; pour 4 qts. boiling water over it and stir ujitil well 
dissolved ; add 1 pound chloride of lime and let stand a day or two, 
stirring occasionally; let settle; then drain off clear portion and 
strain into fruit jars. 

TO WHITEN CLOTHES when Avashing, add a small teacup of 
javelle water to a boiler of water; pour over well rubbed clothes; let 
stand fifteen minutes, stirring occasionally that everj^ part may be 
thoroughly scalded ; rinse well and dry. 

OXALIC SOLUTION.— Put i^ ounce oxalic acid (crystalized) 
in a T>t. bottle of water; when dissolved it is ready for use; plain- 
ly label the bottle as it is very poisonaus. AftiM- an application of 
this, the fabric should be quickly and well rinsed.

HELPFUL HINTS. 

TO SCALD jMILK. — Put in double boiler, having water boiling; 
cover, and let stand on range until milk around edge has a bead-like 
appearance. 

TO EXTRACT JUICE FROM ONION.— Cut a slice from root 
end of onion ; draw back the skin and press onion on a coarse gratei", 
working with a rotary motion. 

TO CARAMELIZE SUGAR.— Put in a granite saucepan; place 
over range and stir constantly until melted and of the color of maple 
syrup. Care must be taken to prevent sugar from adhering to the 
sides of the pan or spoon. 

TO PREVENT SALT FROM LU:MPING — Mix with corn starch, 
allowing 1 teaspoon cornstarch to 6 teaspoons salt. 

TO "WASH CARAFES — Use handful of shot or rice in strong so- 
lution of soda and shake well; or half fill with hot soapsuds, to which 
is added 1 teaspoon washing soda. Put in new^spaper, torn in small 
pieces. Let stand 1/2 hour, shaking occasionally. Empty, rinse witli 
hot water, drain, wipe outside and let stand to dry inside. 

TO CLEAN GRANITEWARE where mixtures have been burned 
on. Fill wnth cold w^ater, add washing soda, pearline, or any soap 
powder; heat gradually to boiling point, then empty when dish may 
be easily washed. 

TO KEEP A SINK DRAIN FREE FROM GREASE.— Pour down 
once a week at night: i/o can Babbitt's potash dissolved in 1 quart 
water. 

A small piece of window glass will be useful for holding the 
leaves apart on a cook book, and one can read the recii)e and not 
soil the book by too much handling. 

IF POTATOES HAVE BOILED DRY, setting the kettle in\- 
mediately into cold water prevents a burned flavor. Boil a strong 
solution of soda in the bui'ned kettle. 

WHEN SINK DRAIN IS CHOKED pour into sink \\ pound cop- 
peras, dissolved in 2 quarts boiling water. If this does not clear it. 
repeat before sending for plumber. 

TIE STRANDS OF A NEW BROOIM closely together; put into 
a pail of boiling water, and soak 2 hours. Dry thorougiily before us- 
ing.

^ In the purchase of Flavoring Extracts, you buy flavor and Cologne Spirits. f' 

rj The proportion of Cologne Spirits in Flavoring Extracts seldom varies except in ^ 

J very cheap goods, where Alcohol and Water are largely used. t 

■^ The proportion of Flavoring Material added to the Spirits varies greatly, t: 

■i therefore, what you buy in addition to Flavoring Material is Alcohol or Alcohol Z^ 

i^ and Water. fe 

■^ You can buy Cologne Spirits at $2.50 per gallon, or less than 2c an ounce. f' 

■» You can buy Flavoring Extracts one-quarter, one-third, three-fourths or t 

^ full strength according to price. t 

.g You will readily recognize that full strength Flavoring Extracts are the best f- 

■J to buy. A less amonnt is required and a better flavor is obtained. They are ^ 

^ cheaper in the end. t 

I ROYCE'S HIGH GRADE FLAVORING EXTRACTS are full strength | 

■■» — are made from the best of selected materials — require only one-half teaspoonful f-^ 

i^ to give a delicious fruit flavor to one quart of material. t
