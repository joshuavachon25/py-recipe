TO THE 



R E A D E R. 



T Believe I have attempted a branch of Cookery ^ which 

nobody has yet thought worth their while to write upon : 

bui as I have both feen^ and found by experience^ that 

the generality of fervants are greatly wanting in thai pointy 

therefore I have taken upon me to inJiruSf them in the befi 

manner T am capable \ and^ I dare fay y that every ferv ant 

who can but ready will be capable . of making a tolerable 

good cooky and tbofe who have the leajl notion of Cookery 

cannot mifs of being very good ones, 

' If I have not wrote in the high pclite flyle^ I hope I 

fhall be forgiven \ for my intention is to inJiruSl the lower 

fort, and theirefore muft treat them in their own way. 

For example^ - when I bid them lard a fowU if I fhould 

bid them lard with large lardoons^ they would, not know 

what I meant ; but when I fay they muft lard with little • 

pieces of bacon^ they know what I mean. So in many 

other things in Cookery ^ the great cooks have fuch a high 

way of exprejfing tbemfehesy that the poor girls are at 

a lofs to know what they mean: and in ail Receipt 

Books yet printed^ there are fuch an odd jumble of things 

as would quite fpoil a good dilh ; and indeed fome things 

fo extravagant y that it would be almoji a fhame to make ufe 

of them^ when a difti can be made full as goody or bet^ 

tery without them. For example : when you entertain ten 

or twelve peoplcy you fhall ufe for a cullisj a leg of veal 

and a ham \ whicby uith the other ingredientSy makes it 

very expenjivCy and all this only to mix with other fauce. 

And againy the effence of ham for fauce to one di(h ; when 

/ will prove ity for about' three fhitlings I wilt make as 

A 2 rich 



ii To tte RE ^DER. 

rich and high a fauce as all that will be^ when done. Far 
example : 

Take a large deep ftew-pan, .half a pound of ham, 
fat and lean together, cut the fat and lay it over tke 
bottom of the pan 5 then take a pound of veal, cut 
it into thin flices, beat it well with the back of a 
knife, Uy it all over the ham i then have fix-penny- 
worth of the coarfe lean part of the beef cut thin, and 
well beat, lay a layer of H all over, with fome carrot, 
then the lean of the ham cut thin and laid over that 1 
then ctit two onions and ftrew over, a bundle of fwect 
herbs, four or five blades of mace, fix or feven 
cloves, a fpoonful of all-fpice or Jamaica pepper, 
half a nutmeg beat, a pigeon beat all to pieces, lay 
that all over, half an ounce of truffles and morek, 
then the reft of your beef, a good cruft of bread 
toaftcd very brown and ,dry on both fides : you may ' 
add an old cock be^t to pieces ^ cover it clofc, and 
•let it ftand over a flow fire two or three minutes, then 
pour on boiling water enough to fill the pan, cover ic 
4:lofe, and let it ftew till it is as rich as you would 
have ft, and then, ftrain off all that fauce. Put all 
your ingredients: together again, fill the pan with 'boil* " 
ing water, put4n a frefti onion, a blade of mace, and 
a piece of carrot i cover it clofe,.and let it ftew till it 
is as Arong as you want it. This will be full as good 
as the cflfcnce of ham for all forts of fowls, or indeed 
modi made di(he§, mixed with a glafs of wine, and two 
or three fpoonfuls of catchup, "V^hen your firft gravy 
is cool, fkim off all the fat, and keep it for ufe.-— r« 
This falls far Jhort of the exp^nce of a leg of veal and ham^ 
snd anfwers every purpofe you want. 

If you go to market y the ingredients will pot ami U 
above half a crown % or for about eighteen pence you may 
make as much good gravy as willferve twenty people* 

Take twelve-penny-worth of coarfe lean beef, which 
will be fix or feven*^pound$» cyt it all to pieces, flour 

• ■ It

k well ; take si quarter of a pound of good butter, pu« 

it into a little pot or large dtep (lew-pan^ and put in 

your beef 1 keep ftirring itj and whtn it begins to 

look a little brown, pour iti a pint of boiling water;, 

ft'ir it all together, put in a large onion, a bundle of 

(Weet herbs, two or three blades of mace, five or fix 

cloves, a fpoonful of all-fpicc, a cruft of bread toaft- 

ed, and a piece of carrot 5 then pour in four or five 

quarts of water^ ftir all together, cover cloie, and let 

k ftew till it i« as rich as you would have it ; when 

enough, (train it off, mix it v/ich two or three fpoon* 

fuU of catchup^ and half a pint of white wine s then 

put ail the ingredients together again, and put in two 

quarts of boiling water, cover it clofe, and let it boil 

till there is about a pint; llrain it off* well, add it ta 

the firfl;, and give it a boil together. This will make 

a grea£ deal of rich good gravy. 

Totf may leave otH the wine^ aecerdmg to what ttfe you 
want it for ; fa that really one might have a genteel enter^ 
tainment for the price the fame of one difh comes to : but if 
gentlemen will have Frcach cooks ^ they muft fay for French 
tricks. 

A Frenchman in his own coumtry will drefs a fine din* 
net of twenty dijhes^ and all genteel and pretty^ for the ex^ 
pence he will put an Englifh lord to for drejpng one dijb» 
But then there is the little petty profit. I have heard of a 
cook that ufed fix pounds of butter to fry twelve eggs ; when 
every body knows (that underfiands cooking) that half 
a pound is full enough^ or more than need be ufed : but then 
it would not be French. So much is the blind folly of this 
age^ that they would rather be impofed on by ^ French 
booby't than give encouragement to a good Englilh cook I 

I doubt I fball not gain the efteem of thofe gentlemen ; 

however^ let that be as it will^ it little concerns me \ but 

fhould I be fo happy as to gain the' good opinion of my own 

fex^ I defire no more ; that will be a full recompence for all 

mj' Irdiible ; and I only }^eg the favour of every lady to read 

A3' my

my Book throughout before they tenfure me, and then I 
flatter myfelf IJhall have their approbation^ 
- I Jhall not take upon me to meddle in the phyjicalway 
farther than two receipts, which \i)ill be of ufe to the pub- 
lic in general, one is for the bite of a mad dog-, and the 
other, if a manfhculd be near where the plague is, he fhaU ' 
be in no danger \ which^ if made ufe of would be found of ' 
very great fervice to thofe who go abroad. 

Nor fhall I take upon me to direct a lady in the ceconotny 
of her family ; for every miftrefs does, or at leafi ought to 
know, what is mofi proper to be done there ; therefbre I 
Jhall not fill my Book with a deal of nonfenfe of that kind, 
which I am very well ajjured none will have regard to* 

J have indeed given fome of my difhes French names to 
dijiingutfh them, becaufe they are known by thofe names : 
and zvhere there is great variety of dijh^, and a large table 
to ccver, fo there muji be variety of names for them \ and 
it matters not whether they be called by a French, Dutch, 
or Englifli name, fo they are good, and done with as little 
expe^ce as the dijh will allow of. 

IJhall fay no more, only hope my Book will anjwer the 
ends I intend it for -, which is to improve thefervants, and ' 
fave the ladies a great decl of trouble.

editor's preface. 



CJ^H E Art of Cookery y like all other arts^ isfidyeSto 
"^ the variations of fajhion^ and the improvements of 
tafie. — Therefore y notwiihjlanding the juft claim of Mrs. 
Glafle's Book on that fubjeS to the approbation of the 
Public^ yet it was apprehended that a careful revifyl might 
render this new edition of her workftill more acceptable and 
more ufeful ; how far the Editor has fucceeded^ the Public 
will determine : but to enable them to judge of his perform^ 
ancty it will be necejfary to give a jfketch of the improve^ 
ments and alterations. 

> * 

On a careful perufdl of the laft Edition^ the Editor noted 
the deficiencies in many receipts s which he hath fupplied^ 
hy adding what was wanting^ and reSlifying what ap^ 
feared to be wrong in the cbmpojttionsy either as to quantity 
cr quality. 

In the Chapter on Roafting and Boiling, be hatb 
made fever al neceffary alterations^ in point of time, in per-- 
forming thofe operations of the Culinary Art ; and given 
bis direSions in as plain^ clear y . and comprehenfive a man* 
Tier as poffible^ that the Lear Her may not be ai a lofs bow 
to proceed. 

He hath alfo made many alterations and improvements in 
the Chapter on Made Difties. 

In that on Soups and Broths, finding room for cor* 
re£lion^ be bath made fuch amendments and alterations as 
were requifitCy and introduced feveral new ones. 

The 






Vi ne EDITOR'S PREFACE. 

Tbe Chapters on Pics, and for Lent, have alfi received 
the necejfary additions and correSiions. 

As to the Direftions for the Sick, the Editor hath 
mt presumed tc make any, alteration ^ the Aulhor af fears 
U he ti^e tefi judge of the direS&ons^ Jhe kys doiM in this 
department of her book. — He hath, however, expunged 
ter dire£iions for Drcfling Turtle (both real and mock) ; 
and infirtvd dire3ions adapted to the mePhed ie bath 
$emJiMtfy and fucesfsfuUf paSifed for many years \ and 
wii^by be is perfeSly convmedy will anfwer the expe^^ 
Sim of tit Reader, 

In the courfe of the correSions^ alterations^ and addi-- 
tions made in the work^ the Editor hath endeavoured ta be( 
as eoncijir hue as intelligible as poffible : be hath not laid 
dow$t a^ rules, or inferted any receipts, which are noi 
warranted by experience in a courfe of practice for ma^ 
years ; and hopes he hasfnijbed his undertaking as a good 
a)ok> which will fufficiently apolagife for every defe& of 
imiguage as^ m good writer* — "the firfi has always been 'his 
teFofeSkn \ ta the latter he makes na^ tret's/ions.

the mofl neceiTary part of it ; and few fervants there are, ttiat 
know how to roaft and boil to perfedion. 

I do not pretend to. teach profefled cooks, but my dcliga \t to 
inflruft the ignorant and unlearned (which will likcwife be 
of great ufe ii^ all private families], and in To plain and full « 
manner, that the moft illiterate and ignorant perfoiv^ who can 
but read, will Icnow bow to do every thing in Cookery well, 

I Ihall iirft begin with roaft and boiled of all forts, and muA 
^re the cook to order her fire according to what the ii to 
drefg ; if any thing very little or thin, then a pretty little briflc 
^% that it may be done quick and nice ; if a very large joint, 
(hen be fure a good fire be laid to cake. Let it be clear at th« 
bottom ; and when your meat is half done, move the dripping-

IF^ beef, ht {urt to paper the top, and bafte it well all the . 
time it is roafting, and throw a handful of fait on it. Whea 
you fee the fmoke draw to the fire; it is near enough ; then 
take ofF the paper, bafte it well, and drudge it with a little 
flour to make a fine froth. Never faljt your roaft meat before ' 
you lay it to the fire^^ for that dr^ws outs^l the gravy. If y6u 
would keep it a few days before you drefs it, dry it very well 
with a clean cloth, then flour it all over, and hang it v/here 
the air ^i\l CG^e to it j but be fure always to mind thftt ♦'here ^

AS to , roafting of mutton, the loin, the chincpf mutton, 
(whieh is the two loins,) and the faddle^ (which is the two 
necks and pact of the (houldecs cut together,) mun have the 
fkin raifed and (kewered on, and, when near done, take ofF 
the fkin, bafte, and floor it to froth it: up. All other forts of, 
mutton and lamb muft be roafted *witb a quick, clear fire, 
without the fkin being raifed, or paper put on. You fliould 
always dbterVe to bafte yourmeat as focfn 'as you lay it down

korfe-rad<}iih ; lamb, with crelTes, or fmall-falUding. , 

VEAL. 

AS to veal, you muft be careful to roaft it of a fine brown \ 
if a large joint, a very good fire j if a fmall joint, a pretty Hitlc 
brijQk fire ; if a fillet or loin, be fure to paper the? fat, that yon 
Ibfe as little of that as poffible. Lay it fome drftance from the 
firetillit is foaked, then lay it near tht: fire. When you Tay ^ 
it down, bafte it Well with good butter; ind when it is h^ar 
chough, bafte it again, and drudge k>ith a little fibur. -The

little whole pepper \ boil it for about five ; or fix mitiutes, and 
then pour the water oiF: take out the fpice, and beat up the 
bread with a good piece of butter, and a little milk or cream. 
Some love a few currants boiled in it, a glafs of wine, and a 
little fugar ; but that you muft do juft as you like it. Others 
take half a pint of good beef gravy, and the gravy which comes 
out of the pig, with a piece of butter rolled in flour, two fpoon- 
fuls of catchup, and boil them all together ; then , take the 
brains of the pig and bruife them fine ; put all thefe together, 
with the fage in the pig, and pour into your difh. It is a very

7i drefs Turnips, 

TH£Y ea^ beft boiled in the pot, and when enough take 
them out and put them in a pan, and mafli them with batter^ 
a little cream, and a little fall^ and fend them to table. But 
you may do them thus : pare your turnips, and cut them into 
dice, as big as the top of one^s finger ; put them into a clean 
fauce-pan, and juft cover them with water* When enough,^^ 
throw them into a fieve to drain, and put them into a fauce- 
pan with a good piece of butter and a little cream ; ftir then 
over Che fire for five or fix minutes, and fend them to table. 

;.7i dre/s Par/nips* 

THEY (hould be boiled in a great deal of water, and when 
you find they are foft (which you will know by running a fork 
into them), take them up, and carefully (crape all the dirt off 
them, and then with a knife fcrape them all fine, throwing 
away all the fticky parts^ and fend them up plain in a difli 
with melted butter. 

To drejs Broccoli. 

STRIP all the little branches off till you come to the top 
oncy then with a knife peel off all the hard outfide Mn^ whicb 
]g on the ftalks and little branches, and throw them into water. 
Have a ftew-pan of water with fome fait in it : when it boils 
put in the broccoli, and when the fialks are ^tender it is 
enough, then fend it to table with a piece of toafted bread 
toaSmi in the water the broccoli is boiled in under it, the 
iame way as afparagus, with butter in a cup. The French 
eat oil and vincfgar with it. 

To drefs Potatoes* 

YOU muft boil them in as little water as you can, without 
burning the fauce*pan. Cover the fauce-pan clofe, and when 
the (kin begins to crack they are enough. Drain all the water 
out, and let them ftand covered for a mioiite or two ; then peel 
them, lay them in your plate, and po^r fome melted butter over 
them. The beft way to do them is, when they are peeled to 
lay them On a gridiron till they are of a fine brown, and fend 
them to table. Another way is to put them into a fauce-pan 
with fome good beef dripping, cover them clofe, and fiiake 
the faucp-pan often for fear of burning to the bottom. When 
they are of a fijie brown, and crifp, take them up in a pUte» 

then 



Made plain and easy. 17 

then put them into another for fear of the fat, and put butter 
in a cup. 

To drefs Cauliflowers. 

TAKE your floWers, cut olF all the green part, and then 
cut the flowers into four, and lay them into water for an hour : 
then have fome milk and water boiling, put in the cauli- 
flowers, and be fure to (kirn the fauce-pan well. When the 
ftaiks are tender, take them carefully up, and put them into a 
cullender to drain : then put a fpoonful of water into a rleaii 
fiew-pan with a little duft offlour, about a quarter of a pound 
of butter, and ihake it round till it is all finely melted, with 
alitt)e pepper and fatt ; then take half the cauliflower and cut 
it as you would for pickling, lay it into the ftew-pan, turn it^ 
and ibake the pan round. Ten minutes will do it. Lay the 
ftewed in ^he middle of your plate, and the boiled round ic» 
Pour the butter you did it in over it, and fend it to table. 

Another way, 

CUT the cauliflower ftalks off, leave a little green on, and 
boil them in fpring water and fait : about fifteen minutes will 
do them. Take them out and drain them \ fend them whole 
in a diOi, with fome melted butter in a cup. 

To drefs French Beans. 

FIRST ftring them, then cut them in two, and afterwards 
acrofs: but if you would do them nice, cut the bean into 
four, and then acrofs, which is eight pieces. Lay them int<> 
water and fait, and when your pan boils put in fome fak and 
the beans; when they are tender they are enough ; they will 
be foon done. Take care they do not loofe their fine green* 
Lay them in a plate, and have butter in a cup% 

To drefs Artuhokes. 

WRING off the ftalks, and put them into cold watcr^ and 
Wa(h them well, then put them in, when the water boils^ with 
the tops downwards, that all the duft and fand may boil out« 
An hour and a half will do them. 

/ 

To drefs Afparagus*

then cut all the ftalks even alike, throw them into water, and 
bave ready a ftew-pan boiling. Put in fome fait, and tie the

afparagus in little bundles. Let the water keep boiling, And 
when they are a tittle tender take them up. If you boil them 
too much you loofe both colour and tafte. Cut the round of a 
fmall loaf, about half an inch thick, toaft It brown on both 
fides, dip it in the afparagus liquor, and lay it in your difli ; 
pour a little butter over the toaft, then lay your afparagus on 
the toaft all round the difii, with the white tops outward. 
Do not pour butter over the afparagus, for that makes them 
greafy to the fingers, but have your butter in a bafoii> and 
fend it to table. 

Dlre^ions concerning Garden Things* 

MOST people fpoil garden things by over-boiling them* 
All things that are green (bould have a little crifpoefs, for if 
they are over-boiled^ they neither have any fweetnefs or 
beauty. 

To drefs Beans and Bacon. 

WHEN you drefs beans and bacon, boil the bacon by !t* 
felf, and the beans by themfelves, for the bacon will fpoil the 
colour of the beans. Always throw fome fait into the water^ 
and fome parfley, nicely picked. When the beans are enough 
(which you will know by their being tender), throw them in- 
to a 'Cullender to drain. Take up ihe bacon and fkih it; 
• throw fome rafpings of bread over the top, and if you have 
an iron, make it red hot and hold over it, to brown the top of 
the bacon ; if you have not one, hold it to the fire to brown ; 
put the bacon in the middle of the difti, and the beans all 
round, clofe up to** the bacon, and fend them to table, with 
parfley and butter in a bafon. 

To make Gravy for a Turkey^ or any fori of Fowls. 

' TAKE a pound of the lean part of the beef, hack it with a

To roajl a Turkey. ' 

THE befi way to roaft a turkey is to loofen the flcin on the 
hreaft- of the turkey,* and fill it with force-meat, made thus : 
take a quarter of ^ pqund of beef-fuet, as many crumbs of 
bread, a little lemon -peel, an anchovy, fome nutmeg, pepper, 
pariley, and a little thyme. Chop and beat them all well to- 
gether, mix them with the yolk of an egg, and flufF up the 
breaft j when you have .no fuct, butter wiIJ do : or you may 
make your force-meat thus ; fpre^d bread and butter thin, and 
grate fome nutmeg over it ; when you faa^e enough roll it up, 
and ftui£ the breaS of the turkey ; then roaft it of a fine brown^ 
but be fure to pin fome white paper on the breaft till it is near 
enough* You muft have good gravy in the difh, and bread- 
fauce^ made thus : take a good piece of crumb, put it into a 
pint of water, with a blade or two of mace, two or three cloves, 
and fome whole pepper. Boil it up five or fix times, then witli 
a fpoon take out the fpice you had before put in, and then you 
n)u ft pour off the water (you may boil an onion in it if you 
pleafe) ; then beat up the bread with a good piece of butter 
and a little fait. Or onion-fauce, made thus : ' take fome 
onions, peel them, and cut them into thin flices, and boil them 
half an hour in milk and water ; then drain the water from > 
them, and beat them up with a good piece of butter; fliake a' 
little flour in, and ftir it all together with a little cream, if you 
W^ it (or milk will do] \ put the fauce into boats, and gar- 
JJifli with lemon. , ' 

Another way to make fauce: take half a pint of oyfters, 
fttain the liquor, and put the oyfters with the -liquor into a 
fauee-pan, with a blade or two of mace ; let them juft lump, 
then pour in a glafs of white wine, let it boil once,^ and thick* 
en it with a piece of butter rolled in flour. Serve this up in a 
hafofl by itfelf, with good gravy in the di(h, for every body does 
not love oyfter-fauce. This makes a pretty fide-difh for fu^« 
per,, or a corner-difli of a table for dinger. If you chafe it in 
thedifli, add half a pint of gravy to it, and boil it up together. 
Thijs fauce^is good either with boiled or roafied turkies or 
fpwls^ but you may leave the gravy out, adding as much but* 
ter as will do for fauce, and garniChing with lemon. ^

your duck very high, you may fill it with the following irigr^- * 

dients : take a veal fweetbread cut in eight or ten pieces, a few 

truffles, feme oyfters, a few fweet herbs and parfley chopped 

fine, a little pepper, fait, and beaten mace ; fill your duck with 

.the above ingredients, tie both ends tight, and drefs as above. 

Or you may fill it with force-meat made thus : take a little 

j>iece of ve^l, take all the ikin and fat ofF, beat it in a mortar, 

with as much fuer, and an equal quantity of crumbs of bread, 

a few fweet herbs, fome parfley chopped, a little lemon- peel, 

pepper, fait, beaten mace,^ and nutmeg, and mix it up with 

the yolk of an egg. 

You may (lew an ox's palate tender, and cut it into pieces^ 
with fome artichoke bottoms cut into four, and toflfed up in 
the fauCe. You may lard your duck, or let it alone^ juft as 
you pleafe : for my part I th}nk it beft without. 

To boil ducks the French way. 

LET your ducks be larded, and half roafted } then take 
them ofF the fpit, put them into a large earthen pipkin, with 
half a pint of red wine, and a pint of good gravy, fome chef- 
nuts, firft roafted and peeled, half a pint of large oyfiers, the 

vliquor ftrained, and the beards taken oiF, two or three little 
onions minced fmall, a very little ftripped thyme, mace, pep- 

'per, and a little ginger beat fine ; cover it cipfe, and let them 
ftew half an hour over a flow fire, and the cruft of a French 
roll grated when you put in your gravy and wine. When they 
are enough, take them up, and pour the fauce over them* 

To drefs a Goofe with Onions or Cabbage^ » • 

SALT the goofe for a week, then boil it. It will take an 
hour. You may either make onion-fauce, as we do for ducks, 
or cabbage boiled, chopped, and ftewed in butter, with a little 
pepper and fait; lay the goofe in the difb, and pour the fauoe 
overJt. It eats very good with either. 

DireSiions for roajiing a Goofe. 
TAKE fome fage, wafh and pick it clean, and an onion ; 
chop them very fine^ with fome pepper and fait, and put them 
into the belly; let your goofe be clean picked, and »wiped dry 
with a dry cloth, infide and out ; put it down to the fire, and 
roaft it brown : one hour will roaft a large goofe, three quar- 
ters of an hour, a fmall one. Serve it in your difli with fome 
brown gravyj^ apple-fauce in a boatj^nd fome gravy in anoth^.

NEVER put any thing but a little pepper and fair, unlefs 
defired ; put gravy in the di(h, and green fauce in a boat, 
made thus : take half a pint of the juice of forrel ; if no fqrrel, 
fpinach juice: have ready a cullis of veal broth, about half a 
pint, fome fugar, the juice of an orange or lemon ; boil it up 
for five or fix minutes, then put* your forrel juice in, and juft 
boil it up. Be careful to keep it ftirring all the time^ or it 
vill curdle ^ then put it in your boat* 

To dry a Goofe. 

GET a fat goofe, take a handful of common fait, a quarter 
of an ounce of falt-petre, a quarter of a pound of coarfe fugar ; 
mix all together, and rub your goofe v^ry well ; let it lie ia 
this pickle a fortnight, turning and rubbing it every day ; then 
roll it in bran, and hang it up in a chimney where wood-fmoke 
is, for a week. If you have not that conveniency, fend it to 
the baker's ; the finoke of the oven will dry it.: or you may 
hang it in your own chimney, not too near the fire, but make 
a fire under it, and lay horfe-dung and faw-duft on it, and that 
will fmother and finoke-dry it ; when it is well dried keep it in 
a dry place ; you may keep it two or three months, or more : 
when you boil it put in a good deal of water, and be fure to 
fkim it well. 

Note, You may boil turnips, or cabbage, boiled and ftewed 
in butter, or onion- fauce. 

To drefs a Goofe in ragoo. 

m 

FLAT the breaft down with a cleaver, then prefs it down 
with your hand, fkin it, dip it into fcalding water ; let it be 
cold, lard it with bacon, feafon it well with pepper, fait, and a 
little beaten mace ; then Hour it ail over, take a pound of good 
beef-fuet cut fmall, put it into a deep ftew-pan, let it be melt- 
ed, then put in your goofe; let it be brown oh both fides; 
when it is brown put in a quart of boiling gravy, an onion o|^ 
two, a bundle of fweet herbs, a bay-leaf, fome whole pepper, 
and a few cloves; cover it clofe, and let it ftew foftly ;ili it

an hour and a half. In the mean time make a ra<;oo : boil

Take a large fine goofe, pick it clean, ikln it, bone it

white*bread, with a little fine fugar } and be careful to keep 
them in feparate cages : they feed very faft, and will die of 
their fat if not killed in time : trufs.them as you do a Wood* 
cock^ but draw them, and cover them with vine leaves. 

To drefs Larks. ^-^ ^ 

PUT them on a bird-fpit, tie them on another (^\Jt^ ' ^ 
and roaft them twenty-five minutes with a g^tle fire ^ put

and put into the fauce ; (hake it round, and when it is thick 
take up your plovers, and pour the fauce over ^them. Garniih

you muft mince their livers with* a bit of^buccer, fome . 
fcraped bacon, green truffles, if you l>ave any, parffey^ chim-

it fiirring with a wooden ladle; then let your cullis flew fqft- 
ly, and &im off all ^he fat, put in two gla^s of champaign, or

fa that y6a may take the fat well oflT, and clarify it. To c]a^ 
lify it, you muft put it in a flove that draws well, and cover it 
cloie, and let it boil without uncovering, till it boils over ; then 
uacover it, and take off the fat that is round the ftew-pan, 
then wipe' it off the cover alfo, and cover it again. When 
yoor cullis is done, take out the meat, and flrain your cullis

dripping, or hogVlard, as will almoft cover yourfilh; and 
be fure it boils before you put in your fifli. Let it fry quick, 
and let it be of a fine light brown, but not too dark a colour. 
Have your fifli- flice ready, and if there is occafion turn iti 
when it is enough, take it up, and lay a coarfe cloth on a difli, 
op which lay your fifli, to drain all the greafe from it; if yoti

and put to it eight or nine gallons of foft water ; firft make ic

ter of an ounce of cloves, an ounce of whole pepper jblack and

it together; cover it clofe again, and let.it boil till it is a verj 
rich good jelly, which you will know by taking a little out 
now and then, and letting it cool. When you think it is a . 
thick jelly, take it off, ftrain jt through a coarfe hair bag, and 
pref^ it hard ; then ftrain it through a hair fieve into a large 
earthen pan; when it is quite cold, take ofF the fcum and fat^ 
and take the fine jelly clear from the- fettlings at bottom, and 
then put the jelly into a large deep well tinned ftew-pan. Set 
it over a ftove with a flow fire, keep ftirring it often, and take 
great care ft neither fticks to the pan or burns. When you 
iind the jelly very ftifF and thick, as it will be In lumps about 
the pan, take it out, and put it into large deep china-cups^ 
or well-glazed earthen-ware. Fill the pan two-thirds full of 
water, and when the water boils, fet it in your cups. Be fure 
no water gets into the cups, and keep the water boiling foftly 
all the time till you find the jelly is like a fiifFglue; take out

rich; but as to thit you are to make it as good as you pleafe; 
if for foup, fry a French roll and lay it in the middle of the 
di(h, and when the glue is difTolved in the water, give it a 
boil, and pour it into a difli. If you chufe it for change, you 
may boil either rice or barley, vermicelli, celery cut fmail, or 
truffles or morels; but let them be very tenderly boiled in the 
water before you ftir in the glue, and then give it a boil all 
together. You may, when you would have it very fine, add 
force- n^at balls, cocks-combs, or a palate boiled very tender,' 
and cut into little .bits ; but it will be very rich and good, 
without any of thefe ingredients. 

If for gravy, pour the boiling water on to what quantity you 
tkink proper; and when it is diflblved, add what ingredients 
you pleafe, as in other fauces. This is only in the room of a 
rich good gravy. You may make your fauce either weak or 
ftrong, by adding more or lefs ; or you may make it of.veal, 
or of mutton the fame way. 

RULES to be obferved in making SOUPS or BROTHS. 

FIRST take great care the pots or fauce- pans and covers be 
very clean atid free from all greafe and fand, and that (hey be* 
well tinned, for fear of giving the broths and foups any brafiy 
tafte. If you have time to ftew as foftly as you cian, it will 
both have a firmer flavour, and the meat will be tenderer. But 
thenobferve, when you make foups or broths for prefent ufe, 
if it is to be dorfe foftly, do not put much more water than 
you intend to have fOup or broth ; and if you have the con- 
venience of an earthen pan or pipkin, fet it on wood embers 
till it boils, then fkim it, and put in your feafoning ; cover . 
it clofc, and fet it on embers, fo that it may do very foftly 
for fome time, and both the meat and broths will be delicious. 
You muft obferve in all broths and foups that one thing does 
not tafte more than another; but thai the tafte be equal, and ^ 
it has a fine agreeable relifli, according to what you defign ic 
for; and you muft be fure, that all the greens and herbs you . 
put in be cleaned, waihed, and picked.

mafcea a pretty pafty, booed and made aa above with the mut-

A lorn of mutton makes a fine pafty : take a large fat loin of 
mutton, let it bang four or five ,days, then bone it, lesvii>g 
the qneat a$ whole as you can : lay the meat twenty- four hours 
ill half a pint of red- wine and half a pint of rape vinegar;

it comes out of the oven. 

To make a Calf^s-head'^Pii, 

CLEANSE your head very well, and boil it till it is tender 1 
then carefully take off the ileih as whole. as you can, take ouc 
the eyes, and flice the tongue; make a good puffpafte cruft, 
cover the d^ffa; lay on your meat, throw over it the tongue, lay 
the eyes cut in two,^ at each corner. Seafon it with a very 
little pepper and fait,, pouc in half a pint of the liquor it was 
boiled in, lay a thin top-cruft on, and bake it an hour in a 
quick oven* In the mean time i^oil the bones of the head in 
two quarts of liquO^, with two or three blades of mace, half a 
quarter of an ounce of whole pepper, a large onion, and a bun* 
die of fweet herbs. Let it boil till there is about a pint, then 
ftrain it off, and add two fpoonfuls of catchup, three of red* 
wioe, a piece of butter as big as a walnut rolled in flour, half 
an ounceof trufll^s and morels. Seafon with falc to your palate.^ 
Boil it,* and have half the braiqs boiled with fome fage; beat 
them, and twelve leaver of fage chopped fine ; ftir all togthcr, 
and give it a boil ; take the other part of the brains, and beat

SCALE them, gut and wa(h them clean ; do not rip open 
their bellies, but take the guts out with the gills ; dry them iti 
a clean cloth very well : if there be any roe or liver, take it 
out, but put it in again ; flour them well, and have a clear 
good fire. Let your gridiron be hot and clean, lay them on, 
turn them quick two or three times for fear of fticking; then 
let one fide be enough, and turn the other fide. When that 
is done, lay them in a dilli, and have plain butter in a cup, or 
anchovy and butter. "^ 

They eat finely faked a day or two before you drefs them, 
and bung up to dry, or boiled with egg- fauce. Newcafile is 
a famous place for faked haddocks. They come in barrels, 
and keep a great while. Or you may make a fluffing the fame 
9S for the pike, and broil them.

cut up your chicken all in joints in the di(h ; then bruife the 
liver very fine, add a little boiled parfley chopped fine, a very 
little fait, and a little grated nutmeg : mix it all well together 
with two fpoonfuls of the liquor of the fowl, and pour it into 
the diih with the reft of the liquor in the difh. If there is not

If it is for a very weak perfon, take off the fkin of the chicken 
before you fet it on thechafing-dirti. If you roaft it, make 
nothing but bread- fauce^ and that is lighter than any fauce you 
can make for a weak ftomach.

night, and then hang i^ >n wood-fmoke for a fortnight.. You 
may boil it, or parboil it and roaft it. In this pickle you may 
do two or three tongyes, or a piece of pork. 

To moh Beef Hams* 

YOU muft take the leg of a fat, but fi^all beef, the fat 
Scotch or Welch cattle is beft, and cut it ham fafhion. 1 ake 
an ounce of bay- fait, an ounce of falt*petre, a pound of com* 
mon fait, and a pound of coarfe fugar (this quantity for about 
fourteen or fifteen pounds weight, and fo accordingly, if you 
pickle the whole quarter), rub it with the above ingredients, 
turn it every day, and bafte it well with the pickle for a month. 
Take it out and roll it in bran or faw-duft, then hang it itt 
wood*fmoke, where there is but little fire, and a conftanc 
fmoke, for a month ; then take it down, and hang it in a dry* 
place, not hot, and keep it for ufe. You may cut a piece ofF 
as you have occafion, and either boil it or cut it in rafhers, and 
broil it with poached eggs, or boil a piece, and it eats fine cold, 
and will fliver iij^e Duii:h beef. After thia beef is done, yoa 
may do a thick brifket of beef in the fame pickle. Let it lie 
a month, rubbing it every day with the pickle, then boil it 
Mil it is tender, hang it in a dry place, and it eats finely cold,

this pickle, turning and bafting it every day, then hang it in 
wooa-fmoke as you do beef, in a dry place, fo as no heat 
comes to it ; and if you keep them long, hang them a month 
or two in a damp place, and It will make them cut fine and 
fliort. Never lay thefe hams in water till you boil them, and 
then boil them in a copper, if you. have one, . or the biggeft 
pot you have. Put (hem in the cold water, and let them be 
four or. five hours before they boil. Skim the pot well and 
often, till it boils. If it is a very large one, three hours w'Al 
boil it ; if a fmall one, two hours will do, provided it be a 
great while brfore the water boils. Take it up half an hour 
l>efore dinner, pull oflF the ikin, and throw rafpings finely Gft« 
cd all over. Hold a red-hot fire-fhovel over it, and when din- 
ner is ready take a few rafpings in a fieve and fift all over the 
aOoL', then lay in your ham, and with your finger make fine 
figures round the edge of the difh. Be fure to boil your hani 
In as much water as you can, and to keep it ikimming all 
the time till it bolls. It muft be at leaft four hours before it 
boils. 

This pickle does finely for tongues, afterwards to lie In it a 
fortnight, and then hang in the wood-fmoke a fortnight, or to 
|>oil them out of the pickle. 

YorkQiire is famous for hams ; and the reafon is this : their 
fait is much finer than ours in London ; it is a large clear falt^ 
and gives the meat a ^ne flavour. ,1 ufed to have it from MaU 
4en in Eflex, and that fait will make any ham as fine as you 
can defire. It is by much the beft fait for fatting of meat.. A 
deep hollow wooden tray is better than a p^n^ becaufe the 
pickle fwells about it. 

When you broil any of tiiefe hams iti flices, or bacon, have 
fome botliog water ready, and let theiftices lie a minute or two 
in the water, then broil them -, it takes Qiit the fait, and makes

To make Birch-lVine. • 

THE feafon for procuring the liquor from the birch-^rees is 
in the beginning of March, while the fap ts rifing, and before 
the leaves fhoot out; for when the fap is come forwarxl, and 
the leaves appear, the juice, by being long digefted in the 
back, grows thick and coloured, which before was thin and 
clear. 

The method of procuring the juice is, by boring holes in 
the body of the tree, and putting in fofTets, which are com- 
monly made of the branches of elder, the pith being taken outw 
You may without hurting the tree, if large, tap it in fever al 
places, four or five at a time, and by that means fave from a 
good many trees feveral gallons every day ; if you have not 
enough in one day, the bottles in w}iich it drops muft be cork- 
ed clofe, and rouned or waxed ; however, make ufe of it as 
foon as you can. 

Take the fap and boil it as long as any fcum rifes, fkim*

'three hours, and as Toon as you fee it begin to fall, take a gal- 
lon more of liquor; weigh three quarters of a pound of fait, 
and with your hand mix it well with the water:- firain if, and 
with this liquor make your dough of a moderate thicknefs, fit 
to Ihake up into loaves; then cover it again with the lid, and 
let it (land three hours more. In the mean time, put the 
wood into the oven and heat it. It will take two hours heat- 
ing. When your fpunge has (lood its proper time, clear the 
oven, sind begin to make your bread. Set it in the oven, and 
clofc it up, and three hours will bake it. When once it is in^ 
you muft not open the oven till the bread is baked ; and ob- 
ferve in fummer that your water be milk-warm, and in winter 
as hot as you can bear your finger in it. 

Note, As to the quantity of liquor your dough will take, 
experience will teach you in two or three times making, for 
all flour does not want the fame quantity of liquor ; and if 
you make any quantity, it will raife up the lid and run over.

. TAK.£ a lump of dough, about two pounds of your laft ' 
making, which has been raifed by barm, keep it by you in a 
wooden velTel, and cover it well with flour. This is your lea- 
ven : then the pigbt before you intend to bake, put the fatd 
leaven to a peck of flour^ and work them well tc^ether with 
^arm water« Let it lie in a dry wooden veilel, well covered 
with a linei) cloth and a blanket, and keep it in a warm plaoe. 
This dough kept warm will rife again next morning, and will 
h? fuiEcient to mix with two or three bufhels of flour, being 
worked up with warm water and a little fait. WKen it is well 
worked up, and thoroughly mixed with all the flour, let it be 
well covered with the linen and blanket, until you find it 
rife ; then knead it well, and work it up into bricks or loaves, 
making the loaves broad, and not fo thick and high as is fre- 
quently done, by which means the bread will be better baked. 
Then bake your bread. 

. -Always keep by you two or more pounds of the dough of 
your laft baking well covered with flour, to make leaven to kr\e 
from one baking day to another; the more leaven is put to the 
flour, the lighter and fpungier the bread will be. The frefher

walnuts very fine without boiling, even to go to the Indies ; 

but then do not put water to it. For green pickles, you 

may pour it fcaldfng hot on two or three times. AH other fort 

of pickles you need not boil it. Mufbrooms only wafh them

Frejh Herrings and MdckreU 

IF their grlls are of a lively (hining rednefs, their eyes ftand 
full, and the fi(b is ftiff, then they are new; but if dufky and 
faded, or finking and wringled, and tails limber, they are fiale. 

Lohjlers. 

CHUSE them by their weight ; the heavieft are beft, if no 
water be in them : if new, the tail will pull fmart, like a 
fpring ; if full, the middle of the tail will be full of hard, or 
redd ilh- (kin ned meat. Cock lobfter is known by the narrow 
back-part of the tail, and the two u{fpermoft fins within his 
tail are ftifF and hard \ but the hen is foft, and the back of her 
tail broader^ 

Prawns f Shrimps^ and Crabjijh. 

THE two firft, if ftale, will be limber, and caft a kind of 
flimy fmell, their colour fading, and they flinty: the latter 
will be limber in their claws and joints, their red colour turn 
blackiOi and dufky, and will have an ill fmell under their 
throats j otherwife all of them are good. 

Plaife and Flounders, 

IF they are ftifF, and their eyes be not funk or look dull, they 
ar« new ; the contrary when ftale. The beft fort of plaife look 
bluifti on the belly. 

Pickled Salmon. 

IF the ftefli feels oily, and the fcales tire ftpfF and ftiining, 
and it comes in flakes, and parts without crumbling, then it 
is new and good, and not otherwife. ' 

Pickled and Rid Herrings. 

For the firft, open the back to the bone, and if the flefh be 
white, fleaky and oily, and the bone white, or a bright red, they 
are good. If red herrings carry a good glofs, part well from 
the bone, and fmell well, then conclude them to be good,

A artatn Cure fir thi Bite of a Mad Dog. 

LET the patient be blooded at the arm nine or ten ounces. 
Take of the herb, called in Latin, lichen cinereus terrejlris^ 
in Engl i(h,.a(h- coloured ground-liverwort, cleaned, dried, and 
povrdered, half an ounce. Of black pepper powdered, two 
drachms Mix thefe well together, and divide the powder into 
four dofe^ one of which muft be taken every morning failing, 
for four mornings fucceffivelyi in half a pint of cow's milk 
warm. After thefe four doies are taken, the patient muf); go 
into the cold bath, or a cold fpring or riyer every morning faft- 
ing for a month. He mud be dipped all over, but not to ftay 
in (with his head above water) longer than half a minute, if the 
water be very cold. After this he muft go in three times a week 
for a fortnight longer. 

N. B. The lichen is a very common herb, and grow$ 
generally in fandy and barren foils all 'Over England. The 
right time to gather it is in the months of Odober and No- 
vember. D. Mead. 

Amther for the Bite of a Mad Dog. 

FOR the biteof a mad dog, for either man or beaft, take 
fix ounces of rue clean picked and bruifed, four ounces of gar- 
lick peeled and bruifed, four ounces of 'Venice treacle, and 
four ounces of filed pewter, or fcraped tin. Boil thefe in two 
quarts of the bcft ale, in a pan covered clofe, over a gentle 
fire, for the fpace of an hour \ then (irain the- ingredients froip 
the liquor. (Jive eight or nine fpoonfuls of it warm to a man, 
or a woman, three mornings faf^iag. Eight or nine fpoonfuU 
is lufficient for the ftrongeft j a leffer quantity to thofe younger, 
or of a weaker conAitution, as you may judge of their flrength. 
Ten or twelve fpoonfuls for a horfe or a bullock ; three, four, 
or five to a (heep, hog, or dog. This muft be given within 
nine days after the bite : it feldom fails in man or beaft. If 
you bind fome of the ingredients on the wound, it will be A) 
much the better.

they came to the gallows, that they had preferved' them (elver 
from the contagion by ufing the above medicine only ; and 
that they went the whole time from houfe to houfe without 
any fear of the diftemper. 

How to keep clear from Bugs, 

FIRST take out of your room all filver and gold lace, then 
fet the chairs about the room, fbut up your windows and 
doors, tack a blanket over each window, and before the chim- 
ney, and over the doors of the room, fet open all clofets and 
cupboard doors, all your drawers and boxes, hang the reft of 
your bedding on the chair-backs, lay the feather- bed on a table, 
i'len fet a. large broad earthen pan in the middle of the rooni, 
and in that fet a chafing-difh that ftands on feet, full of char- 
coal well lighted. If your room is very bad, a pound of rolled 
brimftone; if only a few, half a pound. Lay it on the char*' 
coal, and get out of the room as quick as poifibly you can, or 
it will take away your breath. Shut your door clofe, with the 
bfankct over it, and be fure to fet it fo as nothing can catch 
fire. If you have any India pepper, throw it in wi(h the 
brimftone. You muft take great care to have the door op€n 
whilft you lay in the brimftone, that you may gee out as fopn 
as poffibleP. Do not open the door iinder fix hours, and then 
you muft be very careful how you go in to open the windows ; 
therefore let the doors ftand open an hour before you open the 
windows. Then brufh and fweep your room very clean, wafli 
it well with boiling lee, or boiling water, with a little un- 
packed lime in it ; get a pint of fpirits of vA^ine, a pint of fpi- 
rits of turpentine, and an ounce of camphor, (hake all 'well 
tpgether, and with a bunch of feathers wafti your bedfltad 
very well, and fprinkle the reft over the feather-bed, and about 
the wainfcot and room.

be well to paint tne room after the brimftone is burnt in it. 
. This never fail*, if rightly done.

TAKE quiclcfilver, and mix it well in a, mortar with the 
white of an egg till the guickfilver tjs^all well mixt, ajEid there

t)bfervations on Preferving Salt Meat, fo as to keep it mellbvif 
and fine far three or four Months ; and 'to preierve Potted 
Butter. 

TAKE care when ybu fait your meat in the fummer, that 
it be quite cool after it comes from the butcher^s ; the 
way is, to lay it on cold bricks for a few hours, and when 
you fait it, lay it upon an inclining board, to drain of^ the 
blood ; then fait it afrefh, add to every pound of fait half a 
pound of Lifbon fugar, and turn it in the pickle every day ; at 
the mdnth's end it will be fine. The fait which is commonly 
ufed hardens and fpoiis all the meat ; the right fort is that 
called Lowndes*s fait ; it comes from Nantwich in Chefliire : 
there is a very fine fort that comes from Maiden in EfTcx, and 
jprom Suffolk, which is the reafon of that batter being finer 
than any other ; and if every body would make ufe of that fait 
in potting butter, we ihould not have fo much bad come t» 
market; obferving all the general rules of a dairy. If you 
Keep your meat long in fait, half the quantity of fugar will ^ 
do^ and then beftow loaf fagar, it will eat much finer. This~ 
pickle cannot be called extravagant, becaufe it will keep a 
great while; at three or four months end, boil it up; if you 
have no meat in the pickle, fkim it, and when cold, only add 
a little more fait an*d fugar to the next meat you put in, and it 
wil( be good a twelvemonth longer. 

Take a leg of-mutton-piece, veiny' or thick flank-piece. 
Without any bone, pickled as above, only add to every pound 
of fait an ounce of falt-petre; after being a month or two in 
the pickle, take it out, and lay it in fofc water a few hours, 
then roafl it ; it eats fine* A leg of mutton or fhoulder of veal 
does the fdme. It is a very good thing where a market is at a 
great diftance, and a large family obliged to provide a great 
deal of meat.

• ALL the kinds, except ftock-fiih, are filted, or eitber dried 
in the fun, as the moil common way, or in prepared kilns, or. 
by the fmokc of .wood-fires in chimney-corners, and, in either 
cafe, require the being fofiened and frefhened in proportion to 
theirbulk, their nature or dryncfs j the very dry fort, as ba- 
calao, cod-fifh, or whiting, and fuch like, ihould be fteeped 
in luke-warm milk and warer ; the {leaping kept as near as 
poffible to an eqUal degree of heat, l^he Wger fiih fhould be 
fleeped twelve, the fmaU, as whiting, &c. about two hours ; 
the cod are therefore laid to fteep in the evening, thijj.Whiiings, 
&c. in the morning before they are to be drefied \ after the

thus prepared, the fmall fiih, as whiting, tuflc, and fuch like, 
are floured aiui laid on the gridiron, and when a little hard- 
ened on the one fide, mufl: be turned and bafled with oil 
upon a feather ; and when bafled on both fides, and well hot 
through, taken up, alway obferving, that as fweet-oil fupples 
and fupplies the fi& with a kind of artificial juices, fo the fire 
draws out thofe juices, and hardens them ; theref(*re be careful 
not to let them broil too long j no time can be prelbnbed, be-* 
caufe of the difference of fires, and various bignefs of the fifh. 
A cle^r charco«tl fire is muck the beft^ and the fiih kept at a 
gogd diflance to broil gradually : the beft way to know when 
they are enough is, they will fwell a little in the bailing, and 
^you muft not let them fall again. 

The fauces are the fame as ufual to falt-fiih, and gainiih 
with oyders fried in batter. 

' But for a fupper, for thofe that like fweet oil, the beft fauce 
IS oil, vinegar, and muilard, beat up to a coafiAtncCf and 
ferved up in faucers» 

1( boiled, as the great fi(h ufually are, it ihould be in milk 
and water, bqtnot fo properly boiled, as kept juft fimmering

Jargeft fifh, and five minutes th^ fmalleft. ♦ Some people 
broil both Yorts after fimmering, and fome pick them to pieces^i 
and then to(s them up ip a pan with fried onions ;ind apples, 

They are either way very good, and the choice depend^ OA 
the we«ik or ilrong ilomachs of the eaters, 

Dried Salmon muft be differently managed'^

than a whiting ; and whefi laid on the gridiron, ihould be mo-
