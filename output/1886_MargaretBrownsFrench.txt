PKEFAOE. 



This book contains a variety of receipts, from the finest 
French dishes to the most ordinary cooking. They are reli- 
able, as nearly every one has been used by me at different 
times. My experience in the work has prompted me to issue 
this book, every part of which has been dictated by me, and 
carefully written down by my friend, Louise A. Smith.

No. i. 
OX TAIL SOUP. 



Soak 3 tails in warm water. Put into a gallon stewpan 8 
cloves, 2 onions, i teaspoonful each of allspice and black pepper, 
and the tails cover with cold water. Skim often and care- 
fully. Let simmer gently until the meat is tender and leaves 
the bones easily. This will take 2 hours. When done take 
out the meat and cut it off the bones. Skim the broth and 
strain it through a sieve. To thicken it put in flour and but- 
ter, or 2 tablespoonfuls of the fat you have taken off the 
broth into a clean stewpan, with as much flour as will make 
a paste. Stir well over the fire ; then pour in the broth slowly 
while stirring. Let it simmer for one-half hour; skim, and 
strain through a sieve. Put in the meat with a tablespoon ful 
of mushroom catsup, a glass of wine ; season with salt. 

No. 2. 
MOCK TURTLE. 

Get a calf's head with skin on, take out the brains, wash the 
head several times in cold water, let it soak one hour in spring 
water, then lay in a stewpan, and cover with cold water, and 



14 MARGARET BROWN'S FRENCH COOKERY BOOK. 

half a gallon over. Take off the scum that rises as it warms. 
Let it boil for one hour, take it up and, when almost cold, cut 
the head into pieces one and a half inches, and the tongue 
into mouthfuls, or make a side dish of tongue and brains. 
When the head is taken out put in the stock meat, about 3 
pounds of knuckle of veal, and as much beef, add all the 
trimmings and bones of the head, skim it well, cover close, 
let it boil 5 hours (save 2 quarts of this for gravy sauce), 
strain it off and let stand until morning ; then take off the 
fat ; set a large stewpan on the fire, with half a pound of fresh 
butter, 12 ounces of sliced onions, 4 ounces of green sage; 
chop it a little; let these fry 1 hour, then rub in one pound 
of flour, then add the broth by degrees until it is as thick as 
cream. Season with % ounce of ground allspice, *4 ounce 
of black pepper ground fine, salt to your taste the rind of a 
lemon peeled thin. Let it simmer gently for 1^ hours, strain 
through a hair sieve. If it does not go through easily press a 
wooden spoon against the sides of the sieve. Put it in a clean 
stewpan with the head, and season it by putting to each gal- 
lon of soup ]/ 2 pint of wine, 2 tablespoon fuls ofdemon juice. 
Let it simmer until the meat is tender (from ]/ 2 hour to 1 hour). 
Take care it is not overdone. Stir often to keep the meat 
from sticking to the pan. When the meat is quite tender the 
soup is ready. A head of 20 pounds and 10 pounds of stock- 
meat will make 10 quarts of soup, besides the 2 quarts of stock- 
meat set aside for side dishes. If there is more meat on the 
head than you wish to use make a ragout pie of some of it. 

No. 3. 
MOCK MOCK TURTLE. 

Line the bottom of a 5 -pint stewpan with 1 ounce of lean 
bacon or ham, i 1 /^ pounds lean gravy beef, a cow's heel, inner 
rind of a carrot, a sprig of lemon thyme, winter savory, 3 



MARGARET BROWN'S FRENCH COOKERY BOOK. 15 

sprigs of parsley, a few green leaves of sweet basil, 2 onions, 
a large onion with 4 cloves stuck in it, 18 grains of allspice, 
18 grains of pepper. Pour on these 1 pint of cold water, 
cover the stewpan and set it on a slow fire to boil gently y 
hour. Watch it carefully, if need be, with the cover off, until 
it gets a good brown color ; then fill up the stewpan with 
boiling water, and let it simmer for 2 hours. If you wish 
you can cut up some of the meat into mouthfuls and put into 
the soup. To thicken it take 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, a ladle- 
ful of gravy, mix them and pour it into the stewpan where 
the gravy is, let it simmer y 2 hour longer. Skim it and strain 
through a fine sieve. Cut the cow's heel in pieces 1 inch 
square. Squeeze the juice of a lemon, 1 tablespoonful of 
mushroom catsup, 1 teaspoonful of salt, y> teaspoonful of black 
pepper, a pinch of grated nutmeg, a glass of Madeira or sherry 
wine, through a sieve into the stewpan of soup ; let simmer 
5 minutes longer. 

No. 4.

it to boil ; put in a hock of ham (smoked), weighing about 2 
pounds, .also thyme, 3 onions, 1 bunch of celery tops, 1 table- 
spoonful each of allspice cloves, not ground ; let it boil down 
slowly to 1 1/2 gallons. When the head is done take it out, 
being careful to remove the brains and tongue, then cut the meat 
into small pieces. Strain the soup ; brown y& pound of flour 
and make a batter of it to thicken the soup ; grate ^ of a 
nutmeg in it, put in pepper and salt to taste ; take a portion

frying them in lard, having first rolled them in eggs, then in 
breadcrumbs ; put the forcemeat ball in the soup just before 
dishing up, together with ^ pint of wine. 



No. 5. 

CELERY SOUP. 

After splitting 6 heads of celery into pieces about 2 inches 
long, wash them well, lay them on a hair sieve to drain, and 
put them in 3 quarts of clear gravy soup in a gallon soup-pot ; 
let it stew just enough to make the celery tender, say about 1 
hour; take off the scum if any should rise, season with a 
little salt. Should you wish to make this soup at a season 
when you could not get celery, use the celery seed, say about 
Y> pint, put this in the soup % hour before it is done, with a 
little sugar. 



No. 6. 

PEASE SOUP AND PICKLED PORK.

the night before. Put 1 quart pease (split), 2 heads of cut 
celery, 2 onions peeled, 1 sprig of sweet marjoram in 3 quarts 
of water ; boil gently for 2 hours, then put in the pork. Let

MARGARET BROWN'S FRENCH COOKERY BOOK. 17 

No. 7. 
PLAIN PEASE SOUP. 

One quart of split peas, 2 heads of celery ; let them simmer 
gently in broth or soft water (3 quarts) over a slow fire, stirring 
every now and then to keep the pease from burning. Add 
more water should it boil away or the soup get too thick. 
After boiling for 3 hours put them through a coarse sieve, then 
through a fine one. Wash out your stewpan and put the soup 
back into it, let it boil up once. Take off the scum if any. 
Fry small square pieces of bread in hot lard until they become 
a delicate brown ; take them out and let them drain on a sheet 
of paper. Send these up with the soup in one side dish and 
dry powdered mint or sweet marjoram in another. 

No. 8. 

LOBSTER SOUP. 

Take 3 fine, lively hen lobsters, boil them ; when cold split 
the tails; take out the fish, crack the claws, and cut the meat in 
mouthfuls; take out the coral and soft part of the body, 
crush part of the coral in a mortar ; pick out the fish from the 
shell, beat part of it with the coral ; out of this make force- 
meat balls, flavored with mace, nutmeg, grated lemon peel, 
cayenne, and anchovy. Pound these, with the yolk of an egg. 
Have ready 3 quarts of veal broth, bruise the small legs and 
the shell, and put them into it to boil for 20 minutes, then 
strain. To thicken the soup take the live spawn, crush it 
in the mortar, with a little butter and flour, rub it through 
a sieve and add it to the soup with the meat of the lobsters 
and the rest of the coral ; let it simmer gently for 10 minutes. 



18 MARGARET BROWN'S FRENCH COOKERY BOOK. 

No. 9. 

ASPARAGUS SOUP. 

Take all the tender portion of three good-sized bunches of 
asparagus. This will make 2 quarts of soup. Put a large 
saucepan half full of water on the fire ; when it boils put one- 
half of the asparagus in, Avith a little salt ; let it boil till done, 
then drain it off. Put in a clean stewpan, with 3 quarts of 
plain veal or mutton broth, cover up close, and stew one hour 
over a slow fire. Rub through a sieve, then cut the other half 
of the asparagus in pieces one inch long, and send up in the 
soup. 

No. 10. 

TOMATO SOUP OR MOCK HOCK SOUP. 

One quart of tomatoes, put on fire and let boil ; when done 
mash through a sieve 3 tablespoon fuls of sugar, 1 tea- 
spoonful nutmeg and mace together, and put in tomatoes, 1 
tablespoonful of butter, mixed with a large tablespoonful of 
flour, stir all into the tomatoes, and put on to boil again ; 
stir till it boils. Quarter of an hour before serving pour in 
1 pint of milk. Pepper and salt to taste. Stir till it boils 
up nicely. Put in 2 tablespoonfuls wine just before dishing up. 

No. n. 
FRIED OYSTERS. 

For this purpose each and every oyster should be as large, 
plump, and fat — fresh, of course, not salt — as you can pro- 
cure. Any small ones will serve for sauces, croquettes, soups, 
etc. Drain off their juice, put them in a bowl, cover them 



MARGARET BROWN'S FRENCH COOKERY BOOK. 19 

with ice water, let stand a few minutes, then place them in a 
colander and drain them. Dry between two thin, soft towels, 
without pressing them, and lay upon a moulding-board, 
slightly coated with cracker-dust, finely sifted. Beat up to a 
thick rich custard as many eggs and an equal measure of cream 
as you need for moistening all the oysters, adding, at the last, 
a saltspoonful of salt for every three eggs. Have ready a suf- 
ficiency of finely-sifted bread crumbs prepared by rubbing 
the heart of a stale loaf of white bread in a towel and pressing 
it through a sieve. Dip the oysters, one by one, into the 
beaten egg and roll them in the crumbs till covered in every 
part. By no means flatten them, but keep them as round 
and plump as possible; lay them on napkins and keep in a 
cool place for half an hour; again dip, roll in crumbs, and 
set aside for another half hour. Now lay them on the wire 
stand, not quite touching each other. Set the stand into a 
deep frying-pan nearly full of whatever frying mixture you 
use, which must be boiling hot, and fry quickly to a deep 
yellow color, but do not brown them, or they will be tough 
and greasy. Lift the stand out of the pan, drain quickly, 
and serve the oysters on a hot, white napkin, placed on a hot 
platter, and garnish with sprigs of parsley or water cress, 
stuffed olives, and small bits of lemon. The daintiest condi- 
ment of all is the French mayonnaise sauce served with let- 
tuce. 

No. 12. 

FRICASSEED OYSTERS. 

Fifty oysters, 6 ounces butter, 3 tablespoon fuls flour, 3 salt- 
spoonfuls salt, 2 saltspoonfuls white pepper, 2 saltspoonfuls

ful bread crumbs. Put the oysters, with their juice, into a 
stewpan on a quick fire; give one boil, drain them, put them 



20 MARGARET BROWN'S FRENCH COOKERY BOOK. 

into a hot tureen, and set in a warm place. Rub the butter, 
flour, and 3 teaspoonfuls of scalding cream to a fine smooth 
paste, stir it quickly into the quart of cream in a bright stew- 
pan on a quick fire. Add the salt and spice, and stir till it 
no longer thickens. Now put in the yolks of eggs, well 
beaten ; stir till smooth, strain the whole through a fine sieve 
upon the oysters. Cover evenly with the crumbs and lightly 
brown in a quick oven.

of cream on top. Put in a rather quick oven; let bake 20 
minutes. 

No. 14.

another with cochineal, leaving the third white. Put a little 
of each into small round pans or cups, giving a little stir to 
each color as you add the next. This will vein the cakes 
prettily. Put the white between the pink and green that the 
tints may show better. If you can get pistachionuts to pound 
up for the green the cakes will be much nicer. Ice on sides 
and top.

FISH, BOILED. 

Place the fish in salted water, cold, if the fish is large, and 
hot if small sized. In the latter case, 2 or 3 minutes in 
boiling water will be enough ; and a sheep's-head of 4 or 5 
pounds will not require more than 10 minutes from the time 
the water boils. Use a strainer to place fish in saucepan. 
Salmon and all dark-fleshed fish require more boiling than 
white-fleshed kinds. Vinegar must be rubbed on the outside 
of fish before it is boiled ; this keeps the skin from cracking.

Cut them lengthwise, score them, sprinkle some pepper 
and salt on them, and run a wire skewer through them to keep 
them from curling on the gridiron, that they may broil evenly. 
Broil them over a clear fire, turning them often till done. 
This will take about 10 or 12 minutes if you have a brisk fire, 
or fry them in butter, and make a gravy in the pan after tak- 
ing the kidneys out by putting in a teaspoonful of flour ; as 
soon as it looks brown, put in as much water as will make 
gravy. It will take 5 minutes more to fry them than to broil 
them. A few parsley leaves chopped fine, and mixed with a 
little butter, pepper, and salt, may be put on each kidney.
