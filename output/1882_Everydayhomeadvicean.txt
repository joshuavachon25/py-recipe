HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 



CHOICE OF A HOUSE.. 

The first and most important requisite in domestic 
life is a house to live in. You may either build, pur- 
chase or rent a house. In the first case, there is some 
difficulty — the cost of building having considerably in- 
creased of late. But if you determine to build, sqx.\.\c first 
on the size and style of house you need. Then apply to 
a respectable architect and surveyor ; tell him the extent 
of your family, number of servants, whether stables, bil- 
liard-room, conservatories, hothouses, &c., are wanted, 
and the limit of expense to whicli you intend to go. 
The architect will submit to you a rough draft of the 
proposed house and its estimated cost; approved of, the 
plan is elaborated. Finally, you obtain separate plans for 
each story, with elevations for the principal fronts — all 
accurately and carefully drawn. The next matter is to 
find a suitable locality. Let your new vicinity be high 
and v^^ell-drained. Carefully avoid the neighborhood 
of graveyards, gas-works, canals, factories, water reser- 
voirs, marshes, open ditches, slaughter-houses, and chem- 
ical manufactories. Endeavor to obtain a site facing the 
south or southeast, — the very best being that site which 
has the diagonal line of its general plan north and soutli, 
so as to have the sun's rays on every window during some 

[25] 



26 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 

part of the day; — in other words, having no front or side 
pointing directly east, west, north or south. A gravel 
soil is preferable to all others, as it will not retain the 
water, and soon dries after rain. If you cultivate a gar- 
den, you will soon discover the advantage of this. The 
direct or moderate slope is always a healthy site, and sure 
to be well drained. Before you conclude upon building, 
be careful to find that the water supply and drainage of 
the neighborhood are thoroughly satisfactory. Good 
and plentiful water and complete drainage are absolutely 
essential to health and comfort. Procure next from a 
good builder a detailed estimate of his charges. If they 
are satisfactory, you may order the work to be proceeded 
with. The thickness of walls, weight of timber employed, 
depth of foundations, height of chimneys above roof, 
party walls, &c., may safely be left to the architect. A 
defect may be easily set right while the house is in 
course of building which would be a source of much dis- 
content and expense if allowed to remain undetected 
until after the work was completed. The style and pat- 
tern of the various decorations should be personally seen 
to. Remember always to give the new house plenty of 
time to dry, and never on any account move in until you 
have the surveyor's assurance that the walls and roof are 
perfectly set. Some very melancholy cases have occurred 
from persons living too soon in newly-built houses. 
Mold gets upon the furniture, and clothes and linen 
are constantly damp. This state of things rapidly ren- 
ders the blood unhealthy, and the whole system becomes 
deranged. Dropsy, rheumatism, and, in some cases, pa- 
ralysis, are brought on; the slightest wound or scratch 
speedily inflames, and existing t.omplaints are greatly 
aggravated. 

Every house should have a garden; but, as a matter 
of taste and comfort, it is as well to get as large an area 
as possible. Where practicable, let your garden wall 
back upon another garden wall, as you v/ill thus secure 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 27 

a good open space between your house and your neigh- 
bor's. 

Purchasing or Renting. 

Purchasing or Renting of a house already built. These 
means of obtaining a house are certainly preferable 
when your circumstances render economy necessary. 
Your best plan is to get the lists of properties for 
sale issued by respectable house agents, who have 
always a number of tenements, more or less bargains, 
for disposal. In these lists may be found houses to suit 
the means and desires of all classes. You can then see 
them for yourself. If you consider the matter favorably, 
pay a second visit — this time accompanied by a surveyor 
or skilled friend — and if everything be satisfactory, you 
can commence negotiations by offering your maximum 
price. 

You will find all necessary particulars as to agree- 
ments for leases, repairs, &c., under the section devoted 
to Law. If all go smoothly, you can dispense with the 
aid of a lawyer; but should you have any reasonable 
doubt as to the bo7ia fides of the vendor or his agent, im- 
mediately instruct your legal adviser to examine the 
titles under which the property is held, and the powers of 
the vendors to sell. 

In nearly all cases the cost of transfer is paid by the 
purchaser; but it is sometimes arranged that all costs are 
covered by one lump sum. 



Sanitary Law. 

The observance of the principles of cleanliness and 
care in the management of a house is all-important. Be- 
fore these principles were understood, the rate of mor- 
tality, in large towns especially, was much higher than it 
is now. In choosing a house or apartments, strict atten- 



28 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 

tion should be paid to drainage, ventilation, light, and 
water supply, and if these are all good, you may con- 
gratulate yourself on a fortunate selection. 



Drainage. 

Drainage is one of the great characteristics of modern 
building operations; for though the principle of carrying 
off the refuse of towns is of ancient date, the practice 
was, in this country, until recently, only partially carried 
out. See that the fall from the house-drainage to the 
main sewer is considerable — eight to twelve feet at the 
least. Avoid, if possible, drains passing through the 
house; and see that the kitchen and out-house drains are 
ample and efficient. Once during the twenty-four hours 
in suiTimcr, and once or twice a week in winter, the whole 
of the drains about tlic premises should be well Hushed. 
This serves the double purpose of getting rid of the stale 
water from the cisterns, and carrying away to the main 
sewer any foul matter retained in the drain pipes. In hot 
seasons disinfectants — a list of which will be found under 
the section ** Domestic Chemistry " — should be freely 
used. 

Ventilation. 

The great desideratum in ventilation is a free current 
of fresh air through all the rooms. Early in the morn- 
ing (except when the weather is very foggy) open all win- 
dows, dooKs, chimneys, and ventilators, and thoroughly 
freshen the whole house. As soon as the family are up, 
the beds should be stripped, the sheets, pillows, blankets, 
&c., placed about the room, the windows opened top and 
bottom, and left so for a couple of hours. Many servants 
think that windows should only be opened in warm 
weather. This is a great mistake, as fresh air is just as 
necessary in cold weather as in warm. 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 29 

light. 

Light is an indispensable essential to health. A room 
flooded with light early in the morning is cheerful and 
pleasant all day. The complaint made in summer of the 
great heat of rooms much exposed to the sun has cer- 
tainly some truth in it; but summer heat may be tem- 
pered in many ways. Outside blinds arc excellent, and 
indeed almost essential to rooms upon which the sun 
shines many hours. Another excellent mode of cooling 
sunny rooms is to place a large glass bowl, such as gold- 
fish arc kept in, in the center of the room. Fill it with 
cold water, and put into it as many little branches as it 
will hold, the lower ends downwards, of willow, birch, or 
lime-tree. By this easy expedient an apartment will in 
a short time be rendered much cooler, the evaporation of 
the water producing the desirable effect without detri- 
ment to health. Besides, the exhalation of green plants, 
under the influence of the sun's rays, greatly tends to 
purify the air. Plants, however, should not remain in 
the room after nightfall, or in the shade, and especially 
not in bed-rooms. Fresh branches and fresh water should 
be used every day, and if tastefully selected and arranged 
this tree-bouquet w,ill be found a graceful and novel orna- 
ment. 

Artificial Light. 

In the matter of artificial light, if gas is used, see that 
the fittings do not allow any escape. Patronize " patent " 
burners, as the ordinary burners allow a large quantity 
of imconsumed gas to pass, which fills the room, and is 
the fruitful cause of headaches and nausea. 



Water Supply. 

The Water Supply should be constant if possible. If 
that cannot be obtained, then the cisterns, water-butts, or 



30 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 

other receptacles should be kept clean and covered 
from dust and dirt. Rain-water will be found suf- 
ficient for many purposes; but for drinking or cook- 
ing all water should be filtered. Boiled water is very- 
good, but water filtered through animal charcoal is still 
better. 

The foul cistern, the rarely-emptied dust-bin, and the 
street drain are only some of the sins against nature's 
laws which propagate disease. 



DECORATION. 



There is nothing like individual taste in these mat- 
ters; but a few hints will be acceptable. 

Drawing-Eoom. 

Have your Drawing- Room decorated cheerfully. Let 
the wall paper be of no decided pattern, and light in 
color. The chimney-pieces should be of white or varie- 
gated marble; the wood-work light, and the door-plates, 
&c., simply white and gold. Stoves should be steel, 
bronze, or ormolu; and the gasaliers either to match (in 
color and pattern), or of cut glass. Where the burners 
represent wax tapers, bronze is perhaps more elegant. 
Chandeliers are always pretty, if kept bright. 

Diuiug-Room. 

In your Dining-Rooffi a different style can be adopted. 
The paper should be rich and warm in tone, without 
staring patterns, and the cornice and moldings massive. 
Most persons prefer " pattern " finger-plates and knobs 
in dining-rooms. The stoves should be roomy, and the 
general effect that of substantial comfort. 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 31 

Breakfast-Eoom. 

Preakfast-rooms should be light and simple in their 
decoration. Bed-rooms are usually ornamented with less 
care than they might be. The walls should be papered 
in light colors, the patterns not too prominent. The 
cornice should be small and neat. 

Eitchen. 

Kitchens, &c., are more appropriately papered in var- 
nished staircase paper, as the soils can be easily washed 
off. In many houses kitchens are wood-paneled, or the 
walls covered with tiles, after the good old fashion com- 
mon in Germany and Holland. 

Staircases. 

Staircases should be papered with varnished marbled 
papers ; and the cornices should be large and orna- 
mental. 

Outside Decoration. 

Outside decoration is so entirely a matter of taste, that 
it must be left to individual judgment. 



FTJENITURE. 



Walnut, ebony and gold, or rosewood, for drawing- 
rooms, mahogany or oak for dining-rooms, maple, birch, 
fir, or satin-wood for bed-rooms, and deal or birch for 
kitchens, are the accepted woods for furniture. 

In Furnishing a House, the best plan is to buy every- 
thing of one large firm. 

Let your guiding rules be that the same style, with 



32 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 

modifications, be apparent all over your house ; that in 
the employment of color you avoid bad contrasts ; that 
walls be well covered with mirrors, pictures, &c., and 
that the rooms be not overcrowded. 



Furniture for a Ten-roomed House, 

consisting of drawing-room, dining-room, library or 
study, four bedrooms, kitchen and scullery: — 



Drawing-Room. 

The carpet should be of velvet pile or Brussels, 
light in color, rather subdued, and not so large or prom- 
inent in pattern as to detract attention from the furni- 
ture to which it forms a sort of background; not too full 
of flowers, and all the pattern Hat. Chairs, sofa, couches, 
ottomans, &c., uniform in style. Take covers and cur- 
tains not too prominent in pattern, and similar in color. 
Stoves, polished steel, ornamented with ormolu. Six or 
eight chairs, with a few occasio^ial cane-seated chairs and 
tables; jjiano of rosewood, maple, or ebony and gold. 
A center-table is now generally replaced with an otto- 
man; chcffonicr, with plate-glass back and doors; large 
chimney-glass. These glasses are improved by double 
candle-branches, so contrived as also to hold flowers, 
ferns, &c. With respect to ornaments — such as statuettes, 
time-pieces, artificial flowers, &c., great taste must be ex- 
hibited. Well-bound books are, however, always admis- 
sible. Antimacassars may be plentifully used, fringed, 
and not too large. When out of use, the furniture should 
be covered with linen cases, for, without great care, fur- 
niture soon dulls. 

If windows are close together — side by side — a strip 
of plate looking-glass should run from floor to ceiling, 
filling the space. With regard to pictures, select those 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 33 

which are glazed — such as water-color drawings, steel- 
plate engravings, photographs, chromo-lithographs, &c. 



Diuing-Room. 

The Dinuig-roont should be snug and comfortable, 
well furnished, with telescope table, solid arm-chairs of 
oak or mahogany, in morocco leather or leather cloth — 
green and gold or crimson and gold. Wall paper of a 
warm color, cornice deep and rich; stove of bronze or 
steel; and for ornaments, oil paintings. Let this room 
be well lighted and cheerful. A side-board buffet, or 
dumb waiter, for glasses, dishes, &c., near to the head of 
the table, is indispensable in a large dining-room. 



Breakfast-Room. 

Simplicity and neatness should be the character- 
istic of the Breakfast-room or Parlor, Your table 
should be tolerably large, and your chairs comfort- 
able — say ten in number, in addition to two easy chairs. 
Birch is a very pretty wood for this room, as is also ma- 
hogany. The carpet, curtains, and table-cover should 
not be too brilliant. The hearth-rug, hassocks, &c., should 
either be a match or some good contrast. A large chef- 
fonier, the practice piano, a chimney-glass, several pic- 
tures, a work-table, folding chess-table, bronze or lack- 
ered gasalier, and a what-not should also find places 
here. 

Library. 

The Library or Study should be furnished in mahog- 
any or oak, and leather. Two or three reading-chairs, 
writing-table with drawers, couch, two occasional tables 
to hold papers, &c., and a book-case, or book-shelves, are 
required for your library. The shelves themselves should 



34 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 

be movable, so that you can accommodate their height to 
the sizes of your volumes. This apartment should be 
furnished with damask curtains, both summer and winter. 
Oil paintings are very appropriate, as are also statuettes, 
groups in bronze, &c. In addition to the ordinary gas- 
fittings, a movable gas lamp, with flexible tubing, is es- 
sential. 

Hall. 

The Hall should be entirely covered with floor-cloth, 
or other patent floor-covering, with suitable door-mats; 
it should also contain a hat and umbrella-stand, with 
glass back, one or two chairs, a small table furnished 
with writing materials, a gong or dinner-bell, a clock, 
and a barometer and thermometer (combined), with oil- 
paintings on the walls. 

Staircases. 

Staircases should be carpeted from top to bottom with 
the same pattern carpet — browns, drabs, and greens are 
the best colors. In summer the stair carpets should be 
covered with white linen damask, or thin oiled canvas. 

Bed-rooms. 

With respect to the advantages of iron or brass, 
as against wooden bedsteads, the former certainly 
possesses greater strength, lightness, and beauty; but the 
selection is a matter of taste. For the curtains, &c., pure 
white, or white striped with rose color, or light-blue, 
has a good effect. Silver fir, polished pine, birds'-eye 
maple, or satin-wood, are all fashionable. Three to six 
chairs (cane seated), a wardrobe, a chest of drawers, a 
large washstand (double), toilet-table and glass, towel 
airer, and an easy chair, wil comprise all you require. 
Your carpet should be rather light in color, with hearth- 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 35 

rug to match. The toilet and washstand fittings should 
be plain white, with a gold border. 

In the matter of quilts, blankets, sheets, pillow-cases, 
bed furniture, valances, bolsters, pillows, beds, mattresses 
and palliasses, the taste of the mistress of the house must 
reign supreme. A bedside or invalid table is useful in a 
large bed-room. 

Kitchen Furniture. 

Kitchen Furniture should be plain, neat, and strong; 
plate-racks wide, ironing-board steady, and cupboards 
deep and roomy. 

A Tool and Nail Box, filled with useful articles 
necessary in a house, is an essential requisite. 



BITS OF ADVICE. 

Before putting down your carpets and floor-cloths 
lay down carpet-paper on the floor. This simple process 
is of immense use in preserving carpets. 

Carpet. 

To Choose a Carpet. — Brussels carpets, although 
estimated by the beauty of design and coloring, ought 
to possess another very essential property, viz., dura- 
bility. This arises more from the quantity and quality 
of worsted on the surface than from the ordinary opera- 
tions of the weaver. In the best qualities the worsted 
warp-threads usually appear on the surface, in sets of 
threes, each set occupying the space between the linen 
warp-threads or chain, and of which threads there are 
about seven to an inch. This closeness of arrangement 
maintains the loops of worsted nearly upright, giving 
thereby greater elasticity, with a sustained resistance 



36 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 

to the effects of pressure and wear. Inferior carpets 
usually have a reduction in the quantity of surface 
worsted, produced by dropping loops. The quality of 
worsted is not less important than the quantity; indeed, 
a carpet made of good worsted, in a smaller quantity, is 
to be preferred to one crowded with an inferior material. 
Good worsted is bright, evenly twisted, free from loose, 
hairy fiber, soft and elastic to the touch. Crimson and 
scarlet are very durable colors; greens are sound; and 
brown, buff and fawn colors rather less pernianent. 

Window Blinds. 

Choose Your Window Blinds according to taste. If 
Venetian, then let them be green or drab. With white 
blinds you should also have outside blinds, either lath or 
striped linen canvas, so as to keep your rooms cool. 
Spring blinds are the most handy and economical. 

If any of your rooms are underground, or partially 
so, don't use wire blinds, but make a screen of flowers, 
gold-fish, ferns, or something of the kind. 

Flowers are appropriate in, and enhance the appear- 
ance of, every room in the house but the bed-rooms. 

An extra suit of covers — of holland — will be found 
very useful for your chintz or drawing-room furniture. 

Have hot water in your bed-room, if you have no bath 
or dressing-room. 

Have a gas bracket in your basement passage. 

Immediately you have furnished your house, make 
out a list, and insure for the full value. 

Have no dark corners about your house : if they are 
there, and you can't help it, fill them up, or they will be 
continually choked with rubbish. 

Conservatories and hot-houses will be dealt with un- 
der head " Gardening." 

Have the gas laid on in every room in the house. It 
is the safest, most convenient, and cheapest plan. 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 37 

Towels, white damask table-covers, table-napkins, 
toilet-covers, &c., &c., should all be of very superior 
quality, as their fashions never change, and they last a 
great length of time. 

Let your house be well furnished with bells, and keep 
them in perfect repair. Every young wife will acknowl- 
edge the benefit of a bell from the nursery or servants' 
room to the parlor or bedroom. See constantly to your 
locks and latches. 

Let your pantry and filters be cool and airy. 

Never let small repairs, either to house or furniture, 
be neglected even for a day. 



Drafts. 

Drafts in a house cause great discomfort, and a house 
is frequently drafty through being constructed on erro- 
neous principles; this is particularly the case when the 
back door is placed immediately opposite the front 
entrance. A direct draft should be avoided, and this 
may, in some cases, be remedied by an intermediate door 
of cloth or baize, which will in some measure prevent 
the inconvenience. Strips of fancy leather should be 
employed. 

Lamps. 

In Xh.t, Management of Lamps several points are to be 
observed. If the wick be turned too much the oil will 
not rise readily; nor should it be too loose, or it will 
^ cause the capillary attracting power to raise too much 
oil. Lamps require constant attention to the wick, other- 
wise the light will be unequal. Trim your lamps daily. 
The wick should be cut perfectly level with scissors; any 
ragged bits on the edge of the wick cause the flame to 
burn unevenly, and to smoke. 



SS HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 



In the matter of Gas, when the quantity that escapes 
is but small, it may be discovered by its smell, and there 
may be yet no danger; but when the quantity is large, it 
forms with the common air a highly explosive mixture. 
Whenever it is expected, therefore, that gas may have es- 
caped into a room, first go on in (without a light) and 
open the doors and windows wide. Let them remain 
open for some time; and then, when th-e smell has de- 
creased, endeavor to ascertain where the leak is. Grease, 
or rag steeped in oil, is a handy and efficient plug. 

Smoky Lamps. 

To Cure Smoky Latnps. — Soak the wick in strong vine- 
gar, and dry it well before you use it; it will then burn 
both sweet and pleasant. 

Smoky Chimneys. 

The Cure of Smoky Chimneys is often a perplexing mat- 
ter. When the opening of the fire-place is found to be 
so large as to lead to the descent of smoke into the room, 
the easiest remedy is a movable smoke-board of wood, 
tin, or iron, hung to the mantel-piece, so as to lessen the 
aperture. In new buildings smoky chimneys could be 
avoided by forming a second and smaller flue by the side 
of the smoke flue. Another remedy is to have a chimney- 
pot constructed with four doors, one on each side, with 
a connecting-rod attached to each pair, so that when the 
wind is blowing strongly from any quarter, two doors 
will be immediately shut, and the two opposite opened 
by those that are shut. The top is quite closed. Some- 
times a smoky chimney is the result of obstructions by 
soot, bricks, mortar, or even birds' nests. These the 
chimney-sweeper must remove. Be sure to have your 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT, 39 

chimneys swept at regular intervals. To know the cause 
of a smoky chimney is half its cure. Where the draft 
is sluggish, it may be accelerated by introducing cold air 
in front of the fire. Say, for example, through a hole in 
the hearth-stone, covered by a ventilator, and protected 
from cinders and ashes by the fender. Generally speak- 
ing, the air from underneath the floor will be sufficient; 
but if not, a greater supply can be obtained by construct- 
ing an air-drain communicating with a passage, or with 
the external air. 

Paper-Hangings, 

Light paper-hangings imbibe less heat and light 
than dark ones, and consequently maintain a lower tem- 
perature. Summer rooms should therefore be hung with 
light and pretty, and winter rooms with dark, warm 
papers. 

Whitewashing. 

Following is a good mode of Whitewashing; — First, 
wash the plaster over with clean water, by means of a 
large flat brush, to remove the dirt; then stop up all 
cracks and flaws with new plaster; and in doing this, it 
is frequently necessary to cut away the plaster in such 
places to obtain a clean first surface to enable the new 
plaster to adhere. When the surface is dry, the white- 
wash, made of whiting mixed up in water, is laid on with 
the brush, and is gone over two or three times, so as 
effectually to obliterate all marks and stains on the 
surface. 

Whitewash for Walls. 

To make Whitewash soak four ounces of glue in 
tepid water. Put it into a tin vessel with a quart of 
water; set the vessel in a kettle of water over the fire; 



40 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 

keep it there till it boils, and then stir until the glue is 
dissolved. Next put from six to eight pounds of Paris 
white into another vessel, add hot water, and stir until 
it has the appearance of milk of lime. Add the sizing, 
stir well, and apply in the ordinary way while still 
warm. 

Cleansing of Furniture. 

Manual labor is the first necessity. Various receipts 
for French polish and furniture paste have been given 
at different times, but the following will be found most 
useful: — 

French Polish. 

Three-quarters of an ounce of seed-lac, three 
drachms gum juniper, two drachms gum mastic, 
and four ounces of spirits of wine, avoirdupois : 
powder and mix them with the spirits in a glass bottle. 
Set the mixture in a warm place, and shake it twice or 
thrice a day, taking care to loosen the cork during the 
shaking. Four or five days will be sufficient for dissolv- 
ing the resin, when it will be fit for use. 

French Polish, with Naptha. 

Naphtha, one quart ; shellac, six ounces: sandarac, 
two ounces. Powder the gums, and mix. To be used 
in the ordinary way, and cleared off with pure naphtha. 

French Polishing. 

Mode of French Polishing. — The polish itself may be 
bought ready mixed at the color-shops; but the mode 
of applying it needs to be explained. If the wood be 
porous, or of a coarse and open grain, it will be necessary 
to first give it a coat of clear size. When dry, gently go

over it with very fine glass-paper. The size will fill up 
the pores and prevent the polish from being absorbed 
into the wood, and be also a saving of considerable time 
in the operation. Make a wad with a piece of coarse 
flannel, or drugget, by rolling it round and round, over 
which, on the side meant to polish with, put soft, fine 
linen rag several times doubled. Put the wad or cushion 
to the mouth of the polish bottle, and shake the mixture. 
Damp the rag sufficiently; then proceed to rub your work 
in a circular direction, observing not to do more than a 
square foot at a time. Rub it lightly, till the whole sur- 
face is covered; repeat this three or four times, accord- 
ing to the texture of the wood; each coat to be rubbed 
till the rag appears dry. Be careful not to put too much 
on the rag at a time, and you will have a very beautiful 
and lasting polish. Be also very particular in letting 
your rags be very clean and soft, as the success in French 
polishing depends, in a great measure, on the care you 
take in keeping it clean and free from dust during the 
operation. 

Furniture Paste. 

Scrape two ounces of beeswax into a pot or basin ; 
then as much spirits of turpentine as will thoroughly 
moisten it ; powder an eighth part of an ounce of 
resin, and add to it, when dissolved to the consistency 
of paste, as much Indian red as will bring it to a deep 
mahogany color; stir, and it will be fit for use. Elbow- 
grease and patience will do the rest. 



Cleansing Brasswork. 

Paste for Cleansifig Brass-work. — Rotten stone, two 
ounces; oxalic acid, half-an-ounce; sweet oil, three-quar- 
ters-of-an-ounce; turpentine, enough to make a paste. 
Apply with a little water. 



42 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 

Brass Ornaments. 

To Cleanse Brass Ornaments. — Wash with roche alum 
boiled to a strong lye, in the proportion of an ounce to 
a pint. When dry, rub with fine tripoli. 



COLORS FOR HOUSE PAINTING. 

The following particulars will be found useful to 
those who wish to do their own house-painting: — 

Sione color: White lead, with a little burnt or raw 
umber, and yellow ochre. — Graystone : White lead and a 
little black. — Drab : White lead, with burnt umber and a 
little yellow ochre for a warm tint, and with raw umber 
and a little black for a green tint. — Pearl, or Pearl Gray : 
White lead with black, and a little Prussian blue. — Sky 
Blue: White lead, with Prussian blue. — French Gray: 
White lead, with Prussian blue, and a little lake. These 
last, used in various proportions, will make purples and 
lilacs of all shades. — Fawn : White lead, with stone ochre, 
and a little vermilion or burnt stone ochre. — Buff : White 
lead and yellow ochre. — Cream : Same as the last, with 
more white. — Lemon : White lead, with chrome yellow. — 
Orange: Orange lead, or chrome yellow and vermilion. 

' — Peach : White lead, with either vermilion, Indian red, 
purple brown, or burnt stone ochre. — Gold : Chrome yel- 
low, with a little vermilion and white. — Violet: White 

> lead, with vermilion, blue, and black. — •S'^^^ .• Prussian 
blue, raw umber, and yellow stone ochre, with a little 
white, and thinned with boiled oil and a little turpentine. 
— Olive Green : Raw umber, with Prussian blue, thinned 
as before. — Pea Green : White lead, with Brunswick 
green, or with Prussian blue and chrome yellow. — 
Brown : Burnt umber, or vermilion and lamp black. — 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 43 

White : White lead only, mixed with oil and turpentine, 
and a very smaJl quantity of black or blue, to take off 
any yellowness of color arising from the oil. — Chocolate : 
— Spanish brown, or Venetian red and black, thinned 
with boiled oil and a little turpentine. — Lead: White 
lead and black. — Opaque Oak : White lead, with yellow 
ochre and burnt umber. — Opaque Mahogafiy : Purple 
brown, or Venetian red, with a little black. — Black 
should be ground in boiled oil, and thinned with boiled 
oil and a little turpentine. The proportions of the col- 
ors above mentioned must be determined by the particu- 
lar tone of color required; and you increase the quantity 
in like proportions. 



Oil Paintings. 

To Cleanse Oil Paintings. — Dissolve a small quantity 
of salt in rain water ; dip a woolen cloth in the mixture, 
and rub the paintings over with it till they are clean ; 
then wash them with a sponge and clean water, dry them 
gradually, and rub them over with a clean cloth, or silk 
handkerchief. Should the dirt be not easily moved by 
the above preparation, add a small quantity of soft soap. 
Be very careful not to rub the painting too hard. The 
blackened lights of old pictures may be restored to their 
original hue, by touching them with deutoxide of hydro- 
gen, diluted with six or eight times its weight of water, 
and afterwards washed with a clean sponge and water. 



Fire-proof Paint. 

Take a quantity of the best quick-lime, and slack 
with water in a covered vessel ; when the slacking 
is complete, add water, or skim milk, or a mix- 
ture of both, and mix to the consistency of cream ; then 
add at the rate of twenty pounds of alum, fifteen pounds 



44 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

of potash, and one bushel of salt to every hundred gal- 
lons of creamy liquor. If the paint be required to be 
white, add six pounds of plaster of Paris, or the same 
quantity of fine white clay. All these ingredients being 
mingled, the mixture must then be strained through a 
fine sieve, and ground in a color mill. When roofs are 
to be covered, or when crumbling brick walls are to be 
coated, mix fine white sand with the paint, in the pro- 
portion of one pound of sand to ten gallons of paint ; 
this addition being made with a view of giving the in- 
gredients a binding or petrifying quality. This paint 
should be applied in a hot state in cold weather to keep 
it from freezing. Three coats are sufficient. Any color 
may be obtained by adding the usual pigments to the 
composition. 

Fire-proof Mortar. 

Take two-thirds of the best lime and one-third of 
Smith's black dust, and mix with the necessary quantity 
of water. This will form a mortar that will set nearly 
as hard as iron. 

Hot-Water Pipes. 

To Stop Leakage in Hot- Water Pipes. Get some iron 
borings or filings, and mix them with vinegar, forming 
it into a paste; with this fill up the cracks, and if the pipe 
has been previously dried, and is kept dry until this has 
become quite hard, it will never fail to effectually stop 
the leakage, and will stand for a length of time. Should 
an iron pipe burst, or a hole be broken into it by accident, 
a piece of iron may be securely fastened over it, by bed- 
ding it on, in a salve made with iron borings and vinegar; 
but the pipe should not be used until it has become per- 
fectly firm. 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 45 

Cheap Filter. 

Procure a conical jar — an ordinary flower-pot 
will do — with an aperture in the bottom. Into this 
aperture fit a clean sponge as firmly as possible ; and 
the jar being then filled with water, and placed in such a 
manner as to allow the water to pass through it into a 
receiver, it will be found that all the grosser impurities 
of the water will be removed, and the water at the same 
time will be much softer and better fitted to drink. Or 
on the sponge may be placed a layer of fine sand and ani- 
mal charcoal. 

Steel and Iron. 

To Cleanse Steel and Iron. — One ounce of soft soap, two 
ounces of emery, made into a paste; then rub the article 
with wash-leather till bright. 

Fire Irons. 

To Keep Bright Fire Irons from Rusting. — Smear them 
over with hot melted mutton suet; before it cools and 
hardens, have some powdered unslacked lime in a muslin 
bag, and dust it on to the hot suet which covers the irons. 
Oil is of little use, but salad oil being the only oil free 
from water, should alone be used at any time for them. 
When not used, fire-irons should be tightly covered in 
baize. 

Varnished Wood. 

Varnished Wood for Furniture. — This may be finished 
off so as to look equal to French polished wood. Take 
two ounces of tripoli, powdered; put it into an earthen 
pot, with just enough water to cover it; then take a piece 
of wliite flannel, lay it over a piece of cork or rubber, and 
proceed to polish the varnish, always wetting it with the 



46 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 

tripoli and water. It will be known when the process 
is finished, by wiping a part of the work with a sponge, 
and observing whether there is a fair, even gloss. When 
this is the case, take a bit of mutton suet and fine flour, 
and cleanse the work. Suitable also to other varnished 
surfaces. 



HINTS FOR HOUSEWIVES. 

Save suds for gardens and plants. 

Count your clothes-pins, spoons, knives, forks, towels, 
handkerchiefs, &c., every week. 

Never pour boiling water on tea trays, but wash them 
with cool water, and polish with a little flour and a dry 
cloth. 

Save pieces of bread for puddings; dry them well, 
and they will not turn moldy. 

Do not buy cheese in large quantities at a time, espe- 
cially in summer. 

A hot shovel, or a warming-pan of coals, held over 
varnished furniture, will take out white spots. Rub the 
place, while warm, with flannel. 

Marble fire-places should not be washed with soap, 
which will, in time, destroy the polish; after the dust is 
wiped off, rub the spots with a soft cloth, then rub dry 
with a rag. Oil will make white marble yellow. 

When knobs of doors are rubbed, use a large piece of 
pasteboard, with a hole in the center, just enough to 
encircle the knob, and a slit in the paper to let it in. 
This slipped on will protect the paint from being soiled. 

If flat-irons are rough, or smoky, lay a little fine salt 
on a flat surface, and rub them well, to make them 
smooth, and prevent them from sticking to anything 
starched. 

Keep tapes, threads, and pieces of various fabrics in 
separate bags; and so save time in looking for them. 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 47 

Change water in flower-pots every day in summer, or 
it will become offensive and unwholesome. 

When clothes liave acquired an unpleasant odor by 
being kept from the air, charcoal laid in the folds will 
soon remove it. 

A bit of soap rubbed on the hinges of a door will 
prevent their creaking. 



SERVANTS. 



It is the fashion to say that the servants of our day 
are less skilled and trustworthy than their predecessors. 
This may be so, but at the same time the masters and 
mistresses are often to blame. Few indeed possess the 
skill (or if they do possess it they do not show it) to 
unite authority with kindness, and fewer still are capa- 
ble of that steady and uniformly reasonable conduct 
which alone can maintain true dignity, and command a 
willing and attentive obedience. Servants' wages vary 
so considerably, according to time and place, that no 
attempt will here be made to set down the rates at 
which they ought to be paid ; but — for the benefit of 
young housekeepers — a short epitome of the duties of 
the various servants is appended. A clever housewife 
will not only know what her servants should do, but see 
that they do it properly. 

Housekeeper. 

Th.Q Housekeeper \Sy among servants, the most important 
member of the household, for to her is confided the 
management of nearly the whole of the establishment ; 
and on her skill and sagacity depends the comfort of 
every one in the house. Among her principal duties 
are the general marketing — the purchase or choice of 



48 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 

meat, poultry, fish, vegetables, groceries, &c.; the storing 
of fruit, pickling, and the curing of meat, and the general 
charge of the store room. In most families the house- 
keeper is expected to keep accounts of all domestic ex- 
penditure. Slie should, therefore, be familiar with 
figures, and write a neat, plain hand. As a rule, even if 
the mistress of the house herself undertakes to keep 
the regular accounts, the housekeeper should enter all 
sums which pass through her hands in a memorandum 
book, at the end of which should be made an inven- 
tory of the stock in hand when she commenced her 
duties, as this inventory will enable her, at any time, 
to see what is required in the way of replenishment. 
And in this way also she will arrive at a pretty accurate 
judgment of the average needs and consumption of the 
household. As the whole conduct of the servants is 
under the control of the housekeeper, she should be an 
early riser, a good manager, and a clever adviser. She 
should, moreover, be patient, good tempered, and partic- 
ularly clean ; always ready to advise or assist in any 
department of the house, and possess a thorough knowl- 
edge of the duties of every domestic under her control. 
Various small but important matters will come within 
her province — such as the regulation of fires in the bed- 
rooms, the periodical cleansing and repairing necessary 
in every establishment, however large or small ; the 
order and arrangement of the furniture, the changes of 
the window curtains according to the season ; the pre- 
paring, counting, and entering the clothes for the laun- 
dress, or for the weekly wash ; the supervision of the 
storeroom, and the general putting to rights of the fur- 
niture, books, linen, plate, wearing apparel, &c., of the 
household. 

Cook. 

The Cook should above all things be cleanly, and 
should learn the particular tastes of her employers, 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 49 

whether they prefer meats well done or underdone, soups 
thick or thin, light or daric, clear or full ; what flavors 
they fancy — especially of spices and herbs — whether they 
prefer their food highly seasoned or not, and many other 
little matters. 

In large establishments the cook is engaged entirely 
in the preparation of the daily meals, but in the more 
numerous households in which only a cook and house- 
maid are employed, the cook has the charge of the dining- 
room, and is the sole mistress of the kitchen. She is 
also expected to keep the hall, the lamps, the doorsteps, 
and the passages clean and neat ; and in some cases helps 
the housemaid to make the beds, &c. The young house- 
wife will, however, arrange these matters for herself. In 
the early part of the day the cook is expected to answer 
single knocks at the door, and rings of the bell ; after 
which her sole attention will be devoted to the prepara- 
tion of the family dinner. In this she needs all her knowl- 
edge, experience, taste, and the economic tact for which 
she doubtless received credit from her last mistress. 



Second Cook or Kitchen Maid. 

The Second Cook or Kitchen-maid has to take the man- 
agement — under the cook's superintendence — of roasting, 
boiling, and otherwise dressing of plain joints, fish and 
vegetables. One of her foremost duties is the preserva- 
tion of cleanliness in the kitchen and other parts of the 
house. In large establishments the kitchen-maid is as- 
sisted by 

Scullery-Maid. 

The Scullery-maid, whose business it is to wash up the 

plates and dishes, saucepans, stew-pans, and other kitchen 

utensils. She also assists the kitchen-maid generally, in 

preparing vegetables for cooking, lighting fires, sweep- 

3 



50 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 

ing and cleaning the kitchen and lower rooms of the 
house, and making herself generally useful. 

Under the head, Domestic Cookery, will be found all 
particulars relating to the preparation of meats, fish, 
made dishes, &c. 

Housemaid. 

The Housemaid is always busy, for her labors extend 
to nearly every apartment, as well as occasionally assist- 
ing the lady's-maid and laundress. On her exertions de- 
pend the cleanliness and good order of the house, furni- 
ture and bedding, the care of which forms her principal 
duty. In many houses there are two or more house- 
maids, one being sometimes styled Parlor-maid, and the 
other the Under Housemaid. Between them they divide 
the work, such as dusting, svv-eeping and cleaning, bed- 
making, fire-lighting, preparing the rooms for company, 
carrying in the breakfast and supper trays; and, when 
there is no parlor-maid, waiting at table. The house- 
maid should be an early riser, clean and neat in her per- 
son, active, methodical, and good-tempered. 



Laundry-maid. 

The Laundry-maid. — Her business is almost exclusively 
confined to the washing and getting up of the family 
linen. She should be thoroughly up to her work and 
scrupulously clean. Much of the hard work of the laun- 
dry is now performed by means of various labor-saving 
ijontrivances, such as the washing machine, the clothes' 
wringer, the roller-mangle, the dryer, &c., and by the use 
of approved washing powders in the place of the rough 
soda, almost universal a few years ago. Every mistress 
will have her own plans and arrangements; but a good 
laundry-maid will so apportion her work as to have reg- 



HO USE HOLD MAN A GEM EN T. 5 1 

ular days for washing, ironing, &c., and a uniform method 
of proceeding so as to save time and economize labor. 
Thus she will begin with an examination of the articles 
for the wash, separating the coarse from the j5ne, the 
towels and sheets from the body linen, collars, muslins, 
the woolens from the cottons; putting each in its sepa- 
rate tub. She will carefully look for wine, beer, ink, or 
grease spots, which she will remove by applying sal am- 
monia, oxalic acid, soap, &c., as directed in another chap- 
ter. She sees that her fire is properly alight early in the 
morning for those things which require boiling — such as 
coarse linens, &c. ; receipts for the best modes of cleans- 
ing which articles will be found in subsequent pages- 
She must also be very particular not to have the water for 
flannels, angolas, &c., too hot, or they will shrink and 
lose their color. All articles of silk, as hankerchiefs or 
dresses, must be washed by themselves in two or three 
waters, the last almost cold, and hung out to dry in the 
shade, without wringing. After the washing and drying 
comes the starching, mangling, and ironing, with which 
processes all servants should be quite familiar. 

Dairy-Maid, 

The Dairy-maid has the management of the dairy, 
poultry-yard, and bake-house ; she milks the cows, makes 
the butter, cheese, &c., feeds, picks, and prepares the 
poultry for the cook ; and also, in some fam.il ies, makes 
the bread. Her duties, however, vary according to the 
size of the family and the district in which they reside. 
Various useful receipts and directions for the dairy-maid 
are given in subsequent pages. 

Lady's-Maid. 

The Lady" s-tnaid should be fairly well educated, taste- 
ful and neat. Her principal duty is to attend to the per- 



52 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 

sonal wants of her mistress in connection with the toilet 
and the wardrobe. She should be apt at dressing hair, 
and have a good taste in the contrast and distribution of 
colors, acquainted with the most favorite perfumes and 
cosmetics, ready v/ith the needle, and an expert milliner. 
In most families the lady's-maid is also employed as a 
needlewoman. She has the charge of her mistress's 
wardrobe and should be au fait at packing trunks and 
boxes for journeys ; and, in fact, a handy help, cheerful 
assistant, and confidential, though not too familiar, friend 
to her employer. 

Nurse. 

The Nurse has so important and responsible a position 
that the utmost vigilance is necessary in selecting such a 
person as will be at the same time a safe companion for 
young children, an experienced manager, and a good- 
tempered, pleasant-looking woman ; she should be ac- 
quainted with children's diseases, and their treatment, 
attentive to regularity of diet, and should have the en- 
tire management of the children's clothes. Under the 
nurse's supervision in large families is — 



Nursemaid. 

The Nursemaid^ who is, in every respect, the nurse's 
deputy. She should be active, kindly and industrious. 
It is the business of the sick nurse to cleanse and dust 
her lady's room, and look after her wants and wishes 
generally. As to the special duties of the Monthly Nurse, 
and the Wet Nurse, no mistress of a family need be in- 
formed ; but the young wife will do well to make strict 
inquiries into their ages, habits, tempers, and capabilities. 
Recipes for simple medicines, food for children, sick- 
room cookery, with hints and cautions on emergencies, 
are inserted in another portion of this work. The nurse 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 53 

should make herself familiar with these, as the proper 
thing done at the proper time often saves anxiety, trou- 
ble, expense, and even life. 



Butler. 

The Butler is the principal of the men-servants, and 
consequently enjoys a position of great trust and impor- 
tance. His duties include the management of the wine 
and beer cellars — for which special training is necessary 
— the arrangement of the table, the business of the side- 
board and side-table, and the care of the plate. He 
should also be a good carver, and a fair judge of wine. 



Cnder-Butler. 

The Under-butler is the assistant of the butler, and 
should possess the same knowledge. Where an under- 
butler is not kept, the footman assists the butler. All 
who undertake the duties of butler should thoroughly 
understand the bottling and fining of wines, beer, &c., 
and be acquainted with the most approved modes of lay- 
ing a table for a large party. 



Valet. 

The Valet is expected to possess a competent knowl- 
edge of the habits and customs of polite life, and to 
be thoroughly acquainted with etiquette and forms of 
fashion. His especial business is to attend to the per- 
sonal accommodation of his master ; to take charge of 
his wardrobe, and to attend to the general business of the 
dressing-room. He usually travels with his master, and 
should consequently be able to give accurate information 
as to times and distances. A knowledge of French is 
almost essential in these days of travel. 



54 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 

Coaclimaii. 

The Coachman — in families where only one is kept- - 
has to undertake the care of the carriage, and some of 
the stable business. He should be skillful, nimble, 
hardy, and honest, should love horses, and never be 
afraid of turning his hand to anything that is required of 
him. 

Groom. 

The Groom — who is often under-coachman as well — has 
the feeding, exercise and general management of the 
horses. He has also to see to the general good order of 
the stable. The groom should be a good driver and 
rider, and possess some knowledge of the ailment and 
temper of horses. Recipes for water-proofing leather, 
managing harness, removing stains, &c., inserted in other 
chapters, will be found useful to the coachman and 
groom. 

Footman. 

The Footman's duties inoiude almost every kind of 
household employment. Cleaning, in its various branches, 
assisting, and in some cases, taking the place of the but- 
ler or valet. He should be accomplished in waiting at 
table, the management of wardrobes, and, indeed, should 
be able and willing to make himself generally useful. 
He it is who opens the door to visitors (where a hall 
porter is not kept), waiting at table, riding behind the 
carriage, or on the box with the coachman, carrying 
messages for his employers, cleaning plate, and, in fact, 
acting in any capacity where handiness, readiness, and 
tact are required. 

Gardener. 

The Gardener s duties will be fully shown in the section 
devoted to Garden Management, and therefore we need 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT, 55 

only here say, that for every large establishment, a sci- 
entific florist, with a working gardener under him, is 
necessary. 

Maid of All Work. 

The Maid of All Work or General Servant is often a girl 
of from thirteen to sixteen. Under a good and active 
mistress, she will soon, if she be attentive and willing, 
learn the usual duties of the housemaid, and acquire 
some knowledge of the plain cooking, and the ordinary 
business of a small household. From the moment she 
rises in the morning and opens the house, lights the 
fires, sweeps up the sitting-room, and gets ready the 
breakfast, her work goes on continuously; but if the 
mistress be a good manager, certain days will be set 
apart for cleaning up and dusting the several apart- 
ments, and thus, by system and regularity, much labor 
may be saved. A good maid of all work should so ar- 
range her business as to have leisure time in the evening 
for a little reading or needlework. It is false economy 
to engage young, cheap, and inexperienced servants. 
Those who keep one or two servants only, must not 
expect all the work of the house to be done by them 
alone. Master and mistress must divide between them 
the duties of butler and housekeeper, and the mistress 
will herself probably undertake much of the finer and 
more elaborate kind of cookery, assist in making her 
own bed, dust the drawing-room, and take charge of the 
lighter duties generally assigned to the lady's-maid and 
upper housemaid. 



ADVICE TO MISTRESSES. 

Avoid, in your behavior to your domestics, all injur- 
ious treatment, whether it consists of too much severity 



56 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 

or too much familiarity. Behave towards them with that 
courtesy and good breeding which will heighten respect 
as well as affection. If servants do more than you have 
a right to demand, give them at least the reward of see- 
ing that they have obliged you. If, in your service, they 
have any hardship to endure, let them see that you are 
concerned for the necessity of imposing it. When they 
are sick, give them all the attention and every comfort 
in your power, with a free heart and kind countenance. 
Carefully avoid making a favorite of any; unjust distinc- 
tions, and weak indulgences to one, will, of course, ex- 
cite envy and hatred in the rest. Be punctual in your 
payments, whether their wages are weekly, monthly, or 
quarterly. Finally, remember that human nature is very 
much the same, whether in a princess or a scullery-maid. 



RENT AND TAXES. 

It has been said, and with truth, that the rent of his 
house should not be more than one-eighth of a person's 
income. This maxim will, of course, not hold good in 
every case; but, as a general rule, it may be taken as 
trustworthy. In calculating the rent of a house in the 
suburbs of the town to which the master of the house 
may be obliged to go to business, the railway or omnibus 
fare must be calculated and added. Against this expense, 
however, there may occasionally be a set-off by rates and 
taxes being lighter than in town. In matters of three or 
more years' agreements you can sometimes get a con- 
siderable reduction from the regular rent; but you must 
take care to bind the landlord down to do all needful re- 
pairs, or make you an extra allowance for them. 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 57 

POLICE CAUTIONS. 

Though the police are employed to guard the streets 
from depredators, housekeepers and tenants will do well 
to back their efforts in the most efficient manner possible. 
The following Police Cautions will therefore very appro- 
priately close this section. 

Burglaries or larcenies in houses attempted in any of 
the following ways may be most effectually prevented if 
due precautions are taken by the inmates: — ist. By en- 
tering with false or skeleton keys in the absence of the 
family, especially on Saturday and Sunday evenings. — 
2d. By passing through an empty house in the neigh- 
borhood, and entering from the roof through the 
attic windows. — 3d. By window shutters insecurely 
fastened, which can be instantly removed, and property 
stolen by the hand, or passing any instrument through 
the window. — 4th. By calling at houses under pretense 
of having messages or parcels to deliver, or work to per- 
form, and, during the absence of the servant, stealing 
articles from the passage. — 5th. By climbing up the por- 
tico, and entering through upper windows.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



The whole Art of Cookery may be said to be described 

in a sentence — the best and most efficient ways of pre- 
paring raw food so as to preserve its natural qualities 
unimpaired, and render it most palatable and nutritious. 
The several methods of cookery are Roasting, Baking, 
Boiling, Stewing, Broiling, Frying, and Toasting. Be- 
fore, however, we describe the way to cook, we should 
know what we have to cook. We therefore give a list of 
the

MODERN COOKERY. 

The culinary art, as practiced in the best houses, seeks 
to produce recherche, effects by the simplest and most 
ejBfective means ; and as, in many of the receipts which 
follow, French words are employed, it is necessary that 
we should, briefly explain some of the most usual. A 
choice meal does not necessarily imply great expense, or 
great skill in its preparation. The first requisite for a 
good dinner is good sense. First, we should consult 
the best authorities for receipts, and then we should 
carry out the instructions given, with care and patience; 
the materials being chosen with taste, and cooked with 
a judicious regard to tlieir appearance at table. With- 
out these, the largest income will be insufficient to pro- 
duce a satisfactory Bill of Fare. 



Terms used in Modern Cookery. 

Aspic — A transparent jelly used as an outer molding 
for fish, game, poultry, &c.; also for decorating and gar- 
nishing. 

Assiette (a plate) — Small entrees, not more than a plate 
will hold. Fruits, cheese, chestnuts, biscuits, &c., at des- 
sert, if served upon a plate, are called assiettes. 

Assiette volante — A dish handed round by a servant, 
but not placed on the table. Small cheese souffles, and 
other dishes, served hot, are often made assiettes volantes. 

Bain-marie — An open saucepan or kettle of almost 
boiling water, that a smaller vessel can be set in, for 
cooking and warming, extremely useful for keeping 
things hot, without effecting any alteration in either their 
quality or quantity. If you keep broth, soup, or sauce 
by the fire, it reduces and thickens. This is obviated by 



62 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

the rse of the hain-maricy in which the water should be 
hot, but not boiling. 

Bechamel — \Yhite sauce, now often used, much com- 
mended by Francatelli. 

Blanch — To whiten poultry, vegetables, fruit, &c,, by 
dipping them into boiling water for a short time, and 
afterwards into cold water, letting them remain there for 
a while, till they are whitened. 

Blanquctie — A kind of fricassee much used in French 
cookery. 

Bouilli — Beef, or other meat, boiled or stewed. In 
France, the term is applied only to beef boiled, the gravy 
from which forms stock for soups.

French peasantry. 

Braise — To stew meat, which has been previously 
blanched, with fat bacon, until it is tender. 

Braisiere — A saucepan, with raised edges, to hold fire 
on the top. Indispensable in many made dishes. 

Caramel — Burnt sugar. A little piece of sugar is 
placed at the bottom of a saucepan, and burned; upon it 
is poured stock or water, little by little, till the whole is 
brown. Caramel is used to color meats and give tone to 
sauces, entremets, &c. 

Casserole — A crust of boiled rice, after having been 
molded into the form of a pie, filled with a fricassee of 
white meat or a puree of game. 

Compote — A stew, as of fruit, or game, or pigeons. 

Consomm/ — The name by which rich soup, stock, or 
gravy is commonly known. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. d^ 

Croquette — A ball of fried rice or potatoes. 

Croutons — Sippets of bread, toasted or browned for 
hashes, &c. 

Ddsosser — To bone, or take out the bones from poul- 
try, game, or fish; an operation requiring some tact. 

Entrees — Tasty little side dishes, served with the first

fectionery, "to glaze " means to ice fruit and pastry with 
sugar, which glistens when cold and crisp. 

Hors (Toeurjres — Small dishes, or assiettes voiantes of sar- 
dines, anchovies, and similar relishes, used during the 
first course. 

Maigre — Soup, broth, or gravy, without meat, com- 
monly eaten in Roman Catholic countries on fast days. 

Mayonnaise — Cold sauce or salad-dressing for salmon 
and lobster. Much patronized for luncheons and cold 
collations.

MARKETING. 



A good and thrifty housewife will, if possible, go to 
market herself, in order to select the best pieces, and get 
them at the lowest price. A housewife will vary the 
kinds of meat which she buys, not only as they may be 
suitable to the seasons, but as calculated to promote the 
health of the familv. 



HOW TO CHOOSE MEAT, FISH, POULTRY, &c. 

Beef. 

The grain of ox beef, when good, is loose, the lean 
red, and the fat inclining to yellow. Cow beef has a 
closer grain, a whiter fat, and the lean of a paler red. 
Inferior beef, from old, ill-fed animals, has hard, skinny 
fat, dr dark red lean. Prime meat pressed by the finger 
rises up quickly; when the dent made by pressure returns 
slowly or remains visible, the meat is of inferior quality. 

Mutton 
should be firm, close in grain, and reddish, with the fat 



66 DOMES TIC COOKERY. 

white and firm. If too young, the flesh feels tender; if 
too old, on being pinched, it wrinkles up. In young 
mutton, the fat readily separates; in old, it is held to- 
gether by strings of skin. 

Veal 

should be delicately white, though it is often juicy and 
well-flavored when rather dark in color. If the fat round 
the kidney be white and firm-looking, the meat is prime, 
and recently killed. Veal will not keep so long as an 
older meat, especially in hot or damp weather; when de- 
teriorating, the fat becomes soft and moist, the lean flab- 
by, spotted, and spongy. The fillet of a cow-calf, pre- 
ferable to that of a bull-calf, is known by the udder, and 
by the softness of the skin. 

Lamb 

will not keep long after it is killed. The large vein in 
the neck is bluish in color when the fore-quarter is fresh, 
green when becoming stale. In the hind-quarter, if not 
recently killed, the fat of the kidney will emit a faint 
smell, and the knuckle will have lost its firmness. 

Pork. 

_.. When good, the rind is thin, smooth, and cool to the 
touch ; when changing from being too long killed, it 
becomes flaccid and clammy. Enlarged glands in the 
fat, called kernels, are marks of an ill-fed or diseased 

pig- 
Bacon and Ham 

should have a Ihin rind, the fat firm, the lean a clear 
red, without intermixture of yellow. To judge of the 
state of a ham, plunge a skewer into it rig^t to the bone; 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 67 

on drawing it back, if particles of meat adhere to it, or 
if the smell be disagreeable, the ham is not good. A 
short thick ham is to be preferred. 

Venison. 

When good, the fat is clean, bright, and of consider- 
able thickness. To know when it is necessary to cook 
it, plunge a knife into the haunch, and from the scent 
the cook must determine accordingly on dressing or 
keeping it. 

Turkeys and Ponltry. 

The age of the bird is chiefly to be attended to. An 
old turkey has rough and reddish legs, a young one 
smooth and black. When fresh killed the eyes are full 
and clear and the feet moist. When it has been kept 
too long the parts about the vent have a greenish tinge. 
Poultry, when young, have the legs and combs smooth ; 
when old they are rough, and on the breast are long 
hairs instead of feathers. Fowls and chickens should be 
plump on the breast, fat on the back, and white-legged. 



Geese. 

Bills and feet are red when old, yellow when young. 
When fresh killed the feet are pliable, stiff when too 
long kept. Geese are called green while they are only 
two to four months old. 



Ducks. 

Choose them with supple feet, and hard, plump breasts. 
Tame ducks have yellow feet, wild ones red. 



68 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Pigeons. 

Suppleness of the feet show them to be young ; when 
getting bad from keeping, the flesh is flaccid. 



Partridges, 

when young, have yellow legs and dark-colored bills. 
Old partridges are indifferent eating. 



Hares and Rabbits, 

when old, have the haunches thick, the ears dry and 
tough, and the claws blunt and rugged. A young hare 
has claws smooth and sharp, ears that easily tear, and a 
narrow cleft in the lip. A leveret is distinguished from 
a hare by a knob or small bone near the foot. 



Woodcocks and Snipes, 

when old, have feet thick and hard ; when young and 
fresh killed, they are soft and tender. When their bills 
become moist, and their throats muddy, they have been 
too long killed. 

V Cod 

is known to be fresh by the rigidity of the flesh, the red- 
ness of the gills, and the clearness of the eyes. Crimping 
much improves this fish. 



Salmon. 

Flavor and excellence depend upon its freshness 
and the shortness of time since it has been caught ; for 
no method can completely preserve the delicate flavor it 
has when just taken out of the water. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 69 

Mackerel 

must be perfectly fresh. The firmness of the flesh, and 
the clearness of the eyes, are the criterions of fresh 
mackerel, as they are of all other fish. 

Herrings 

can only be eaten when very fresh, and, like mackerel, 
will not remain good very long after they are caught. 

Fresh-water Fish, 

including Trout, Pike, Perch, &c., present the same in- 
dications of being fresh or otherwise as previously stated. 

Lobsters 

recently caught have always some remains of muscular 
action in the claws, which may be excited by pressing 
the eyes with the finger ; when this cannot be produced, 
the lobster has been too long kept. The tail preserves 
its elasticity if fresh, but loses it as soon as it becomes 
stale. When light, lobsters are watery and poor. 

Crabs 

have an agreeable smell when fresh, chosen by observa- 
tions similar to those exercised in the choice of lobsters. 

Prawns and Shrimps, 
when fresh, are firm and crisp. 

Oysters, 
when fresh, have their shells firmly closed ; when the 



70 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

shells of oysters are opened, they are dead, and unfit for 
food. 



BEST MODES OF PRESERVING FOOD. 

Meat 

should be carefuUy examined every day in summer, 
wiped dry, and such parts as are beginning or seem 
liable to taint, particularly kernels, removed. In hot 
vireather it may be kept for several days more than it 
otherwise would, by wrapping around it a linen cloth 
moistened with vinegar, or equal parts of vinegar and 
water; the acid vapor keeps off flies, and the moisture 
causes cold by evaporation. Fresh charcoal bruised to 
powder has also the property, spread over the meat, of 
preventing it from spoiling for some time. Meat, when 
but slightly tainted, may be recovered, by boiling it for 
some minutes with several pieces of fresh charcoal. 

To preserve Fish. 

Thqy should be kept in a very cool place — an ice-house, 
if possible; but if that is not available, they should belaid 
upon a stone floor or shelf, and dipped in cold salt and 
water every night and morning. If it be necessary to 
keep them a few days longer, immerse them in a pickle 
of vinegar and water. 

Vegetables, 

as cabbages, and other vegetables of a soft nature, 
quickly lose their natural juices by evaporation from 
the leaves, which soon become flaccid and poor. As 
heat causes them to lose their juices, they should be 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 71 

kept in a cool, shady, and damp place, not in water, as 
that injures their flavor; the best method of refreshing 
them is to cut off a portion of the stem, and set the cut 
part in water. They should not be laid together in 
heaps, since this is apt to generate heat and fermenta- 
tion. 

To preserve Fruit. 

Fruit should be gathered just before it is ripe; the 
floor and shelves of the room on which the fruit is 
placed should be strewn with straw, and the fruit should 
be laid on this without being suffered to come into con- 
tact with each other. 

Poultry and Game 

must be hung in a cool place, covered with a muslin net 
to keep off the flies and dust. 



ROASTING, BOILING, STEWING, &c. 

Roasting. 

This is the most simple and in many respects the best 
mode of cooking ordinary joints and poultry. As a gen- 
eral rule the cook will allow fifteen minutes to every 
pound of meat, and in the case of white meats, — as lamb, 
veal, and pork — a little longer. Make up a good large 
fire, let it be brisk, clear, and steady, and you then can 
obtain any heat you require by regulating the distance of 
the joint from the fire. Large joints should be placed at 
a moderate distance for the first quarter or half-hour, 
and then brought gradually nearer. For this quarter of 



72 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

an hour the meat does not require basting, but from the 
time it is placed closer, it should be continually basted 
(first with butter or lard, and afterwards with its own 
dripping) until cooked. The meat should never be 
nearer to the fire than six to eight inches. Do not 
sprinkle the meat with salt when first put down, as this 
draws out the gravy. Fine flour should be lightly 
dredged over it from time to time, and a little salt when 
nearly done. Very lean meat will sometimes need to 
have paper placed over it for the early part of the roast- 
ing, or it will scorch. In stirring the fire, always re- 
move the dripping-pan, or ashes may fall in. If a bottle- 
jack be used, the hook should be so placed as to take in 
a bone, and the thickest part of the meat should hang 
downwards. If a spit, then slide it in along the bones, 
avoiding the prime parts of the joint, and be careful to 
spit the meat evenly: if it will not turn well, use balance- 
skewers with sliding heads. 

Beef. 

The Sirloin should never be less than three of the short 
ribs, and to be first-rate, when cooked, it should not 
weigh less than about ten pounds. Cover the joint with 
buttered paper, and place it about a foot and a half from 
the fire. About an hour after it has been down, take off 
the paper, and bring the joint nearer the fire, and from 
that time until done dredge from time to time with flour 
and salt, basting continually with its dripping. When 
the joint is done, empty the dripping-pan into a basin, 
remove the fat from the gravy, and pour the latter into a 
well-dish, garnished with finely-scraped horseradish. 
Place the joint in the dish, and serve very hot. 

Ribs, Rump, Aitch-bone, and other joints of Beef, 
require similar treatment. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 73 

Mutton 

should never be cooked until it has hung for fully forty- 
eight hours. In winter you can sometimes keep it a 
fortnight, and it will be all the better for it. 



The Saddle 

should be covered with buttered paper, and placed about 
a foot and a half from tlie fire. The roasting of this joint 
does not take quite so long in proportion as any othec. 
Keep the paper on until within a quarter of an hour of 
the meat being done, then remove it, dredge lightly with 
salt and flour. Serve with its own gravy, and red-cur- 
rant jelly. 

Haunch of Mutton. 

Cover with paper as for saddle, but remove it half-an- 
hour before the joint is cooked Baste well v/ith butter, 
or its own dripping, and dredge slightly. Serve with its 
own gravy and red-currant jelly. Mashed potatoes 
siiould accompany this joint, and, if in season, French 
beans. 

Leg of Mutton 

is better cooked with a bottle-jack than the spit. Cover 
with paper, which remove ten minutes before done ; 
baste with butter or its own dripping, and dredge slight- 
ly. Serve same as haunch, with the proper vegetables. 



Shoulder of Mutton 

should not be basted while roasting, but instead rubbed 
sparingly with butter. White onion sauce is usually 
\^see Receipt) served with this joint. 
4 



74 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Loin and Neck of Mutton, 
should be roasted like haunch, and served very hot. 

Lamb 

is roasted in the same way as mutton ; but as a rule will 
require to be better done. A little lemon-juice squeezed 
over the joint when nearly ready for table, is, by many, 
considered an improvement. Mint sauce is always 
served with roast lamb. 



Veal 

should be eaten fresh, and should never be allowed to 
hang more than thirty-six to forty-eight hours in sum- 
mer, and four days in winter. The prime joints for 
roasting are the fillet and the loin. Roast as for beef. 



The Fillet 

requires great care in roasting. It should have the bone 
removed, and the cavity filled with stuffing {see Receipt). 
Then fold the udder and flap round, and skewer tight. 
Cover the top and bottom with buttered paper, and put 
down to the fire. Let it be quite close for the first quar- 
ter of an hour, during which time the joint must be well 
rubbed with butter, and then remove it to about two feet 
from the fire, so that it roasts slowly. Keep the paper 
on all the time, and by these means you will have veal a 
fine light brown, almost golden color. A fillet of twelve 
to sixteen pounds will require about four hours' to four 
and a half hours' roasting. Serve with hot melted butter, 
flavored with catsup. 

It is usual for this joint to be accompanied with either 
a boiled ox-tongue, a small ham, or a piece of boiled 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 75 

pickled pork. In all cases send two or three lemons to 
table with veal. Some cooks garnish the dish with 
sliced lemon. 

Loin of Veal 

requires rather less time to roast, but should be treated 
in the same manner as the fillet. Serve with melted but- 
ter. You can either take out the kidney and its fat and 
serve separate on toast, or leave it to be carved with the 
joint. The fat about the kidney should be thoroughly 
cooked. 

Breast, and Shoulder of Veal 

may also be roasted and served like the loin. The 
breast is best roasted with the sweetbread skewered to it. 



Pork 

takes longer to cook than other meats — from twenty to 
twenty-five minutes per pound should be allowed. If not 
well done, it is neither wholesome nor agreeable. The 
parts usually roasted are the loin, spare-rib, chine, and 
leg. 

Leg of Pork. 

The rind should be scored, and the stuffing {see Re- 
ceipt) put in the day before cooking. Roast steadily, 
basting with its own fat. It does not require to be 
papered, unless the fire be very fierce. Serve with gravy 
and apple sauce in a bowl. Some persons like onion 
sauce, or sage and onions, with pork. 

Spare-rib of Pork 

should be well rubbed with flour when put down to the 
fire, and dusted with powdered sage before taking up ; 
froth up with butter and serve hot. 



76 DOMESTIC COOKERY 

Slicking Pig 

is sent to table roasted whole. It should be rubbed 
thoroughly dry, and slightly floured, stuffed with veal 
stuffing, and roasted before a brisk fire. Let it be 
thoroughly done a light brown all over. This will take 
from one to two hours. It is served with the head cut 
off, and it and the body divided lengthways, wath sauce 
made of the brains, and melted butter (seasoned) and 
plain apple-sauce. Some persons rub the pig over with 
white of Q^^ instead of flour before cooking. 

Venison 
is never eaten until it has hung for some time. 

The Haunch 

is esteemed a great luxury, and is thus roasted : — Wash 
the joint thoroughly in milk and water, and then dry it. 
Next cover it with a stiff paste of flour and water, and 
outside that two or three layers of stout paper, securely 
tied. Place the joint in a cradle-spit. Tliis is the only 
way to roast a haunch properly — so that it is perfectly 
balanced and turns evenly. Put it very close to the fire, 
to crust the paste, keeping the paper well saturated with 
grease. After a short time move it a little back. A 
good sized haunch, weighing from 20 to 25 pounds, will 
require from three to four hours roasting before a large, 
clear, solid fire. When yon think it is nearly done, 
remove the paste and paper, and lightly dredge with 
flour — basting with butter — until it froths and browns. 
Serve with its own, and also some strong brown gravy. 
Currant jelly, or currant jelly sauce, is served with it. 
To see if sufficiently done, when you take off the crust, 
thrust a thin skewer into the thick part ; if it passes in 
readily the meat is done, if not, the haunch must be put 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 77 

down to the fire again in the coverings. Many cooks 
put a layer of buttered paper inside the paste as well as 
outside. 

Fawns, 

when small, should be treated like hare {see Hare), but 
when of a tolerable size, they can be dressed like lamb. 



Kid 

may also be prepared like lamb, but if very young they 
are better prepared in the same way^s rabbit. 



POTTLTEY. 



To Pluck either Game or Poultry. 

Lay the bird upon a board, with its head towards you, 
and pull the feathers away froni you, in the direction 
they lie. Many persons pull out the feathers the con- 
trary way, by which means they are likely to tear the 
skin, and very much disfigure the bird for the table. 



To draw Poultry or Game. 

After it is well plucked, make a long incision at the 
back of the neck, take out the thin skin from under the 
outer, containing the crop, cut the neck off close to the 
body of the bird, but leave the neck skin a good length. 
Make another incision under the tail, just large enough 
for the gizzard to pass through — no larger — then put 
your finger into the bird, and remove the crop ; then 



73 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

loosen and detach all the intestines, taking care not to 
break the gall-bladder, squeeze the body of the bird, so 
as to force out the whole of them at the tail ; it is then 
ready for trussing. 

Roast Turkey. 

There are several ways of preparing turkeys for 
roasting, the best of which are here given : — Truss by 
breaking the leg bones, and drawing out the leg sinews ; 
cut the neck off close to the body ; cut the breast-bone 
on each side, and draw the legs up ; then put a folded 
cloth over the breast, and beat it down until flat ; skewer 
in the joints of the wings, the middle of the leg and body, 
the small part of the leg and body, and the extremity of 
the legs. Singe thoroughly, and then fill the skin of the 
neck, or crop, with stuffing {see Receipts) ; tie the skin 
under, and put it on a small-sized spit, and place it 
about a foot and-a-half from the fire. In a quarter of an 
hour rub the bird over with a little butter ; when this is 
melted, draw it a little farther from the fire, and take 
great care not to let the skin break by the fire being too 
fierce. For the last quarter of an hour of roasting you 
should occasionally rub on a little butter. Do not baste. 
The liver should not be put under the wing, as the gravy 
from it disfigures the bird. There is not this objection 
to the gizzard being placed there. Some persons cover 
the breast with buttered paper, but this will not often be 
found necessary if care be exercised to prevent burning. 
Serve with plenty of rich gravy, which pour under, and 
not over, the bird. An excellent gravy is made of the 
fat from the frying-pan in which you have cooked your 
sausages (which should always garnish the dish of plain 
roast turkey), the ordinary brown gravy, and a teaspoon- 
ful of arrowroot, previously mixed in a little cold water. 
A turkey of from five to seven pounds weight will take 
two hours. Bread sauce {see Receipt) should be served 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 79 

with roast turkey, and a boiled ox-tongue, or ham, may 
accompany it. 

All birds, poultry, and game maybe roasted in this manner. 

Another Way to Stuff Turkey 

is to place a quarter of a pound of butter, with pepper 
and salt, in the bird ; then stuff with truffles, forcemeat, 
and sausage-meat in alternate layers. Put the bird in a 
cradle-spit, baste well with butter, and roast slowly. 



A Third Method 

is to stuff entirely with chestnuts. Take their outside 
skins off, and plunge the chestnuts into boiling water. 
In two or three minutes the inner skins will easily peel 
off ; then boil the chestnuts by themselves until perfectly 
tender. When ready, add a little butter, and stuff the 
bird. Roast as before, and serve very hot, with plenty 
of rich gravy. 

Turkey Stuffed Entirely with Truffles 

is a very favorite dish. Take four to six pounds of black 
truffles, cut them up and stew them for about ten minutes 
in butter, seasoned with pepper and salt. This done, 
stuff the body and breast with them, roast and serve as 
before. 

All kinds of poultry are excellent, treated the same. 

Roast Goose. 

To truss for roasting, cut off the feet at the joint, and 
the wings at the first joint. Sever the neck close to the 
body, leaving the skin as long as you can ; then pull out 
the throat, and tie the end in a knot ; put your finger in- 



86 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

to the bird, and detach the liver, &c. Then cut open 
near the vent, and draw out all the inside, except the 
little piece of the lungs called by poulterers the 
'* soal." Cleanse the inside thoroughly with a damp 
cloth, and beat down the breast-bone as directed for tur- 
key ; skewer up, stuff, and roast before a moderately 
brisk fire ; cover the breast with buttered paper for the 
first half hour; baste with its own fat or butter, and 
serve with brown gravy and apple sauce. Green Geese 
are not stuffed. 

Various Stuffings 

are used for roast goose, the best of which, are : — i. Six 
medium-sized onions, chopped small ; two ounces of 
butter, half a teaspoonful of salt and pepper, a dust of 
grated nutmeg, six or eight leaves of fresh sage chopped 
very fine ; put on the fire, and stir till pulp ; stuff while 
hot and put the bird down immediately. 2. Add to this 
stuffing the liver, chopped very fine. 3. Instead of the 
liver, put two or three cold potatoes, cut up into small 
dice, or a little boiled rice, or two or three ounces of 
breadcrumbs. These additions make the stuffing milder. 
4. A couple of dozen boiled chestnuts can be added to 
No. I stuffing, or the bird may be stuffed solely with 
chestnuts. 5. Boil some good potatoes very dry, mash 
well, and mix with butter; season with salt, cayenne, a 
large onion or two or three small ones, and three or four 
sage leaves chopped very fine. — A glass of port wine is 
often poured into the bird when done. 

Fowls for Roasting. 

Take out the intestines, and clean the gizzard ; put 
the gizzard under one wing, and the liver under the 
other ; skewer through the first joint of the wing, right 
through the body ; bring the legs close up, and skewer 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 8i 

through the middle of both legs and body, and also 
through the drum-stick and side-bone, and another 
through the feet. 

Roast Fowls 

distinguished as chickens, capons, pullets, cocks, and 
hens — are dressed for roasting in the same way as turkeys, 
except that they are not usually stuffed. Capon is, how- 
ever, sometimes cooked with turkey-stuffing. Capon is 
improved by a slice of fat bacon tied over the breast, 
under paper, until about a quarter of an hour of the bird 
being done. Dredge fowls, and baste with butter. All 
fowls must be well cooked, nicely browned, and sent to 
table very hot, with rich gravy. 



Roast Capon 

may also be served with young carrots, button onions, 
or turnips, boiled with salt and pepper, and dished on a 
border of mashed potatoes ; they look well on table. 



Roast Duck. 

Prepare and stuff as roast goose, with sage, onions, 
and breadcrumbs, and roast before a brisk fire. A med- 
ium-sized duck will require about twenty-five minutes. 
Green peas, when obtainable, should always be served 
with this dish. 

Roast Hare. 

Considerable care must be exercised in preparing a 
hare for roasting. Directly after it is skinned, it should 
be well washed in warm water. If it has been over-kept, 
and has got musty inside — which will often happen if it 
has been emptied before hanging up — use vinegar, well 
diluted, to render it sweet ; then throw it into water to 
4* 



82- DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

remove the taste of the acid. Pierce with the point of a 
knife any parts in which the blood may have settled, and 
wash in tepid water. Wipe dry, fill with forcemeat or 
good veal stuffing, sew up, truss and spit firmly, baste 
for ten minutes with warm water, throw this away, and 
put into the pan a quart of new milk ; keep it constantly 
ladled over the hare until it is nearly dried up, then add 
a large lump of butter, flour the hare, and continue the 
basting steadily until it is well browned ; unless this be 
done, and the roast be kept at a distance from the fire, 
the outside will become dry and hard. Serve with good 
brown gravy in the dish, and red currant jelly separate. 
A moderate-sized hare takes about forty minutes. 

Roast Leverets. 

Do not stuff, but plain roast, and serve with brown 
gravy. A little less than half an hour before a brisk fire 
will suffice. 

Eoast Babbit. 

Stuff with the liver minced, breadcrumbs, a little 
chopped parsley, butter, salt and pepper, mixed with 
beaten Q%^. Roast before a sharp fire, baste constantly 
with butter, and serve with plain gravy. 

Woodcock, Snipes^ Larks, Quails^ &t;., 

are all best when roasted plain. They must be well 
done, and served on toast, with a little rich gravy. 



Cooking by Gas. 

Joints, poultry, &c., may be roasted, and pies, &c., 
may be baked in a. gas stove, which is a clean and econo* 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 83 

mical contrivance, seeing that tlie fuel is only employed 
during the actual time of cooking. Care must be taken 
that tiiere is no escape of gas, or the meat will be touched 
with its odor, and the heat be insufficiently applied. For 
large establishments, gas-cooking apparatus is very use- 
ful. 

Cooking in American and Dutch Ovens. 

Poultry, small joints, chops, steaks, fish, bloaters, &c., 
may be well cooked in front of the fire in these stoves, 
which have the advantage of radiating and regulating 
the heat, and employing less fuel than in an open stove. 
Baste well, as for roasting. 



BAKING. 
How to Bake. 



Many meats can be cooked as well in the oven as on 
the spit or jack. Legs, spareribs, and loins of pork, 
sucking pigs, fillets or breasts of veal, small joints of 
roasting beef, shoulders and legs of mutton, all kinds of 
hearts, geese, rabbits, and hares are the fittest for the 
oven, and these may, with care, be sent to table as pala- 
table and well-looking as if roasted. The great fault 
with housewives is, that they do not baste their joints 
while in the oven, and consequently the meat is burnt 
outside, and sodden inside. For meat, the oven should 
be brisk, as, if the joint scorches, a piece of paper can be 
put over and round it for some time, taking care to re- 
move it at least half an hour before done. When poultry 
is baked, the heat of the oven should be moderated a 
little. If potatoes are baked under meat, a little longer 



84 DOMESTIC COOKER Y. 

time must be allowed the joint, as the steam from the 
potatoes hinders the cooking. 

Many persons prefer a ham baked to boiled, as it is 
said to keep longer after dressing. It must be covered 
with a common crust of tlour and water, and baked in a 
moderately slow oven. 

Several kinds of Fish — as haddock, pike, eels — can be 
baked v/ith bread crumbs. 



The Baking Disli or Tin 

should be from four to six inches deep, and have a mov- 
able wire lid, or a stand for the meat. The dish or tin 
should have one or two partitions. For pork, and especi- 
ally sucking pigs, a shallower tin is to be preferred, as 
then the rind, or crackling, is better done. 



Sucking Pig. 

A favorite Stuffing is — a quarter of a pound ^.to six 
ounces of bread-crumbs, two ounces of butter, two or 
three small onions chopped fine, three or four sage leaves 
minced very small, and a pinch of pepper and salt. Hav- 
ing this ready, you thoroughly wash the pig, first in tepid, 
and then in cold water, take out all the inside, and dry it 
thoroughly; then put in your stuffing, and sew up. Rub 
the skin dry and anoint it with white of egg. It will re- 
quire from one hour to two to bake, according to size, 
and to be basted with its own gravy from time to time. 
The best way of serving it is to cut off the head when 
done, and divide both it and the body lengthways. Many 
persons serve with the plain gravy that has run from the 
pig, but a better plan is to chop up the brains with a little 
finely minced sage (boiled), and add it to the gravy. 
Serve very hot. Apple sauce is to be served separate. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 85 

Ham. 

Soak in cold water for six to ten hours; take out and 
wipe moderately dry; then make a thick paste of flour 
and water, and entirely cover the ham. Bake in a slow 
oven, allowing from twenty minutes to half an hour per 
pound, according as it is preferred well or under done. 
When done, remove the paste and also the skin of the 
ham, and sprinkle with bread raspings. Many persons 
after taking it out of soak, and before encrusting it, steep 
it for about a quarter of an hour in white wine: others, 
when it is done, and the crust and rind off, put it in again 
for about ten minutes to brown. A glass or two of 
champagne poured over before the raspings are sifted on, 
is said to improve the flavor. 

Leg of Pork. 

Score lightly so as not to cut into the fat, and stuff 
the knuckle with bread-crumbs, a few finely minced sage 
leaves, a couple of boiled onions chopped very small, pep- 
per and salt to taste. Baste continually with its own fat, 
and serve with apple sauce, and baked and boiled pota- 
toes separate. The oven should be sharp, and the time 
allowed for cooking twenty-five minutes to every pound 
of meat. 

Proceed in the same manner v/ith loin of pork, neck, 
and sparerib. Many persons baste these joints with cider. 

Leg of Pork 

can also be cooked by first parboiling it, removing the 
skin, and then baking to a fine brown, keeping it basted 
with fresh butter. This, dusted with powdered sage, and 
fine bread-crumbs, and served with made gravy and fried 
forcemeat balls made of goose stuffing, is called " mock- 
goose." 



86 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Loin of Fork 

is often dressed thus : — cut as for chops, but leave the 
end bones undivided. Chop sage leaves very j5ne, and 
lay them in each cut ; then let the meat soak in vinegar 
and water (half of each) for six or eight days. Take it 
out, dry it, add more minced sage, tie or skewer up 
tightly, and bake in vinegar and water, rind down- 
wards. Serve, without gravy, with red wine — claret will 
do — and sweet sauce. This is said to eat like wild boar. 

Fillet and Breast of Veal 

may be baked, prepared as for roasting (which see), tak- 
ing care to baste thoroughly with butter. As white 
meats for baking require to be a trifle more highly sea- 
soned than for roasting, a few sweet herbs, dried and 
powdered, and without stalks, may be added to the 
stuffing. 

Shoulder of Veal, 

is good baked with stuffing as above, and served with 
mushroom or oyster sauce. 

Fillet of Veal. 

Another way. Skewer up very round, and cover well 
with udder ; place a good piece of streaked bacon where 
the bone was taken out, and stuff under the udder thus : 
chop three quarters of a pound of beef suet very fine, put 
into a basin with six ounces of bread-crumbs, the rind 
of half a lemon, chopped very fine, a little grated nut- 
meg, two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, and a little 
chopped thyme and marjoram; with one bay-leaf, mixed; 
bind the whole with the yolks of three and two whole 
eggs, sew it in, and tie up the joint in buttered paper. 
Bake for about three hours in a moderately brisk oven. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 87 

When done, skewer up with silver or polished skewers, 
drawing out those it was first trussed with; place upon 
your dish with celery sauce, or white sauce {see Receipts). 

Beef. 

The same joints of beef are suitable for roasting and 
baking. The oven must be very hot, but well-ventilated. 
Dust lightly with flour before putting in, and sprinkle with 
a little salt when about three parts done. If the oven be too 
fierce, and scorch the corners of the joint, open the door 
for two or three minutes. Baste frequently — first with 
butter, and then with its own gravy. Serve very hot in 
a well-dish, garnished with horse-radish. Almost any 
vegetables are suitable with beef, but always serve pota- 
toes, either boiled plain, or mashed with fresh butter, 
and a little salt and white pepper. Cauliflowers and 
white cabbages may have a little of the beef gravy 
poured over them. 

Mutton 

may be baked with sliced potatoes. The Shoulder should 
be well floured, and continually basted. Brown well, 
and send to table very hot with its own gravy, slightly 
salted, and white onion sauce {see Receipt) separate. 

Leg of Mutton 

must also be dredged with flour and frequently basted. 
Do not serve with hot water poured over it; but if 
liked, thicken the gravy a little with flour. Red cur- 
rant jelly is usually eaten. 

Fillet of Mutton. 

Cut a large leg of mutton like fillet of veal. Remove 
the bone, and ^U the <<;avity with forcemeat. Flour well, 



88 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

bake in a sharp oven, basting frequently, and serve with 
brown gravy and red-currant jelly. 

Goose, Rabbit, and Hare 

are all very good baked, and the same directions apply 
as for roasting, which see. 

Hearts 
of all kinds are better baked than roasted 

Bullock's Heart 

must be soaked in warm water for two or three hours, 
and then dried, and the lobes cut off. Stuff the inside 
with veal stuffing, or some highly seasoned forcemeat. 
Sew it up, envelop it in white paper, and bake in a 
brisk oven from one and a half to two hours, keeping it 
well basted. Just before ready, take ofif the paper; serve 
very hot, with rich brown gravy and red-currant jelly. 

Calf s Heart and Sheep's Heart 

are dressed in the same manner, but do not take quite 
so long cooking. 



BAKING FISH. 



Haddocks 



are baked thus:— Cut off the heads and fins of two or 
three and put into a stewpan, with an onion, some pars- 
ley, salt, pepper, and two anchovies, cut up fine, a little 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 89 

flour, two tablespoonfuls of white wine, and a little 
catsup. Boil well up together, and when the fish has 
been skinned and cut into pieces, lay them in a deep 
pie-dish; pour the sauce over them, and bake. Strew 
the bottom of the dish with bread-crumbs, and put some 
more over them ; season well with pepper, salt, and 
grated nutmeg. 

Plaice and Herrings 

are baked in a dish, with water, or milk and water. 
Flour well, and bake to a good brown. Serve with 
parsley and cut lemons. 



Cod. 

The thickest part of the cod should be chosen for 
baking. Fill with a stuffing made of grated bread- 
crumbs, a little butter, the yolks of three hard-boiled 
eggs, pepper, salt, grated lemon-peel and nutmeg, and 
anchovy finely shredded, binding the whole with white 
of Q^^ beaten up; put on a disli with bits of butter over 
the top, and bake for an hour. A Dutch oven is also 
suited for this dish. It requires to be frequently basted 
and turned; plain melted butter or oyster sauce should 
be served with it. 

God's Head and Shoulders 

may be dressed thus: — Wash well, cut off the fins, lay on 
a dish, pour boiling water over part, and scrape off all 
the black scales, taking care not to break the skin, till 
every part of the fish looks white, then wash in cold 
water; put on in boiling salt and water, and boil for a 
quarter of an hour; then lay on a dislj and rub with the 
beaten yolks of two or three eggs, and strew with bread- 
crumbs, pepper and minced parsley ; stick it all over 



90 DOMESTIC COOKERY, 

with little bits of butter, and put it in an oven to brown; 
then mix a large tablespoonful of flour with a quarter of 
a pound of butter, a quart of gravy, a tea-cupful of white 
wine, some pepper, salt, and a little grated nutmeg; 
mince the white meat of a lobster, slightly brown three 
dozen of oysters in a frying-pan, and put them with half 
their liquor and the lobster to the gravy and other 
things ; beat it up and pour round the dish; garnish 
with cut lemon. It is not necessary to have lobster 
and oysters. 

Mackerel. 

Cut off the hands and tails, and clean the fish ; then 
season with pepper and salt ; lay in a dish with a little 
butter, and bake in a slow oven. They may be eaten hot 
or cold ; if hot, with any of the usual fish sauces ; and if 
cold, with vinegar. A little vinegar and port wine may 
be added to them. 

Oysters. 

Chop fine, and pound in a mortar with crumb of bread 
dipped in cream : a little parsley and chives, or a very 
small onion, a shred of anchovy, butter, salt, and pepper. 
When well pounded, add white of ^^^ beaten up, in the 
proportion of one ^^^ to two dozen oysters ; mix all 
well together, put into scallop shells, and bake brown. , 



Pike. 

Clean and scale the fish, take out the inside, and fill 
with a stuffing of bread crumbs, a little fresh butter, 
grated lemon-peel, nutmeg, pepper and salt to taste — 
the whole bound with an q^^. Bake in a tin dish, and 
baste continually with fresh butter. Serve with lobster 
sauce, or plain melted butter. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 91 

Salmon. 

Clean, cut the fish into slices about an inch to an inch 
and a half thick, put it in a dish, with the following 
sauce : — Melt an ounce of butter, kneaded in flour, in a 
pint and a half of brown gravy, with two glasses of port 
wine, two tablespoonsfuls of catsup, two shredded ancho- 
vies, and a little Cayenne, When the anchovies are dis- 
solved, strain and pour the sauce over the fish, tie a sheet 
of buttered paper over the dish, and bake till nicely 
brown. 

Shad, 

when good — which is in spring and early summer — may 
be baked in the same way as salmon. 



Sturgeon. 

L,ard with fat bacon, and bake in a slow oven. Serve 
with mushroom sauce, or stewed trufHes. 



Sprats. 

Put into a dish with vinegar and allspice a quantity 
of fresh sprats, wiped clean: flour the top slightly, and 
bake to a good brown. 



Trout. 

Clean well, split down the back, remove the Done, 
and dry with a cloth; season with black pepper, salt, and 
a little mace pounded; roll them up and pack close in a 
dish; pour over them some vinegar; put in to or three 
bay leaves, and some whole pepper, and bake in the oven 
for an hour, covering the dish with buttered paper. 



92 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



BAKING PASTRY. 

The heat of the oven should be regulated according 
to the article to be baked. Those things should be first 
made which will suit the heat of the oven. Light paste 
requires a moderately quick oven; for if the oven is too 
hot, the paste will be colored before it is properly baked; 
and if it is then taken out of the oven it will fall, and be- 
come fiat. A cool oven will not cause pastry to rise suf- 
ficiently; and puff-paste baked in an oven with anything 
that causes much steam, will not be so light as other- 
wise. Iced tarts or puffs should be baked in a cooler oven 
than those that are not iced; or if the oven is too hot, the 
door should be left open, or the icing will become 
brown. Small articles of pastry require to be baked in 
a hotter oven than large ones. All pastry should 
be baked in clean tins or patty pans, without being but- 
tered. When baked sufficiently, pastry may be easily 
slid about on the tin, or pan, while hot; and puffs, pat- 
ties, or small pies, may be lifted from the tin, without 
breaking, by putting your fingers round the edges and 
carefully lifting them, which cannot be done unless they 
are sufficiently baked to be taken from the oven. 



BOILING. 

How to Boil. 

The meat should be put into boiling water, and kept 
gently simmering until done. This is an invariable 
rule, for otherwise the water gets into the meat and sod- 
dens it. 

By this means the natural juices are kept in the meat. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 93 

The slower meat boils, or rather simmers, the better it 
will eat; but the water must never be allowed to get 
cool. 

Twenty minutes to the pound may be considered 
about the average time for meats. 

The saucepan or kettle should be of sufficient size to 
allow the water to flow all round the meat. 

Large joints should be raised from the bottom of the 
saucepan by means of a trivet or fish drainer, to prevent 
the under side burning. 

Meat should not be boiled in a cloth. 

Keep only a moderate fire for boiling. 

Meat that has been fresh killed will take a little longer 
than hung meat. 

If meat is too salt, change the liquor when a quarter 
done. 

The scum must be taken off as fast as it rises. 

Never boil meat without there being a little salt in 
the water. 

Salted and dried meats will want soaking for some 
considerable time before boiling, but never soak fresh 
meats. 

If the water be hard, boil it for a couple of hours be 
fore using. 

Eound of Beef 

should be in salt for about eight or nine days. When 
your water is boiling, wash off the salt and skewer up 
the joint. Put it in, and let it just boil up. Directly it 
does so, remove it to a cornerof the fire, and let it simmer 
gently till done. A piece of round, weighing from 
twelve to sixteen pounds, will take three to four hours, 
at least. 'Y\\q greatest care \s necessary to remove all scum 
as it rises. Serve with a little of the liquor, carrots, and 
suet dumplings. Turnips, parsnips, and peas-pudding 
are also appropriate accompaniments. 



94 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



Aitclibone. Brisket, and Rump of Beef 

may be boiled in ihe same manner. If very salt, two or 
three hours soaking: in cold water — which may with ad- 
vantage be chiinu:ed oncx'; or twice — will improve the 
llavor. A joint of twelve pounds will take about three 
hours after it boils up. 



Eibs of Bee^ 

in small joints, may be cooked like Round. A piece of 
six to eight pounds should be boned, salted and skew- 
ered up round. Put it in strong brine for four days, 
turning the meat twice a day. Then boil as for round, 
letting it simmer for two to two and a quarter hours. 



Leg of Mutton. 

Put into boiling water, and skim carefully, and then 
let it only simmer. This joint should not be overdone; 
the red gravy should follow the knife when cut. Capers, 
chopped line and put into melted butter, may be thrown 
over the joint, and some more of the same sauce should 
be served in a sauce tureen. Mashed turnips are usually 
served with boiled mutton. 



Collared Mutton. 

The best joint is the breast, but the shoulder will do. 
Take out all the bones, make a force-meat with bread 
crumbs, parsley, lemon-thyme, and an anchovy minced; 
season with salt and pepper; rub the meat over with an 
egg, cover it with the forcemeat, roll lirnily, and tie; put 
it on in boilingwater, and skim well; make a good gravy, 
seasoned with sweet herbs and mushroom catsup. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY, 95 



Leg of Lamb 

is very good boiled and served same a leg of mutton, 
(which see). Spinach should be eaten with boiled lamb. 



Collared Breast of VeaL 

Bone, and lay some good forcemeat over the veal. 
Roll it up, and tie round with tape; envelop in a cloth, 
and simmer gently for three hours. Fry some forcemeat 
balls, and serve with brown sauce. 

Knuckle of Veal 

must be boiled rather longer than most meats, until it 
feels very soft under the fork. It must not boil too fast, 
and be Vv^cU skimmed. If cooked in milk and water, it 
increases its whiteness. Pickled pork or ham should be 
boiled and served with it. Parsley and butter or white 
onion sauce are appropriate. 

Another Method 

is to procure two knuckles and saw them into three 
pieces each, put into a stew-pan with two pounds of 
streaked bacon, a carrot, four onions, two turnips, and 
half-a-dozen peppercorns; place over the fire, and add a 
little salt when boiling; skim well, and allow to simmer 
for a couple of hours, then take up, and dress with the 
vegetables and bacon, in the same dish as the veal; serve 
with parsley and butter. 

Calfs Head. 

The head must be split and the brains and tongue 
removed. Wash well, and soak for two hours in cold 



96 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

water; boil it with the tongue and brains gently in 
plenty of water, until quite tender; pour over the head 
parsley and butter made very thick; rub the brains 
through a sieve, add some chopped parsley, pepper, salt, , 
and a bit of butter; mix, and put it round the tongue. 



Leg of Pork. 

About eight days will be found sufficient for salting; 
then soak in cold water for an hour, and dry with a 
cloth. Put it into cold water, and let it gradually come 
to a boil, after which it must very gently simmer, till 
well done, which will be, for a leg of nine or ten pounds, 
three to three and a half hours after the water boils. 
Carrots, parsnips, or turnips should be served with this 
dish, and may be boiled with the meat. Peas-pudding 
{see receipt) must always accompan)- it. 



Ham. 

Soak it as for baking, and put it into cold water, with 
a bunch of savory herbs; when the water begins to sim- 
mer, let it cook gently, until it is done, skimming con- 
stantly: allow about twenty minutes to each pound ; 
when cooked, take ofif the skin, and cover with raspings. 
Serve on a dish garnished with parsley. 

Bacon. 

Soak in cold water for a couple of hours; pare oflf the 
rusty edges, and scrape the rind. Then put in cold water 
and boil gently, allowing three-quarters of an hour to 
every pound of bacon. When done take off the rind, 
scrape the under side, and grate bread-crumbs over it. 
Put in a hot oven for five minutes, and serve with Lima 
beans or peas. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 97 

Pickled Pork. 

Boil gently, till very tender, and serve with peas- 
pudding and plenty of vegetables. 



BOILING POULTRY, &c. 

After the bird is drawn and plucked, singe it with 
white paper, and wipe dry. If a turkey, break the \q.^ bones 
close to the feet, fasten tlie feet together, and attach 
them to a hook ; then take the body of the bird in your 
hands, and pull it firmly towards you, until the sinews 
are drawn out of the thigh. Then cut off the neck close 
to the back, leaving the crop skin long enough to cover 
the opening. Insert your finger, and detach the liver 
and intestines ; cut off the vent and remove the intes- 
tines. Then insert a hook, and carefully pull out the 
gizzard and liver, taking great care not to break the gall 
bladder. Cut off the legs at the first joint ; cut the breast 
bone through at each side close to the back ; then draw 
the legs up to the crop, and beat the breast bone flat with 
a rolling pin. Skewer the legs and wings firmly — one 
skewer fastening the two legs by the middle joint, and 
another the wings. Fowls arc trussed in a similar man- 
ner, except that the nails only, and not the feet, are cut 
off, and that the skewers are put in the first joint of each 
pinion, and the middle of the leg — brought close to it — 
and into the body. This is done at each side. A string 
round the legs keeps them firmer. Pheasants, partridges, 
and all kinds of moor game are trussed for boiling same 
as fowls.

herbs, a shredded anchovy, butter or suet, lemon-peel, 
nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, bound with an t^^. 
Put into boiling water, simmer gently for an hour and a 
half to two hours, according to size. Skim carefully, 
and serve with parsley and butter, or mushroom, or 
oyster sauce. Pickled pork, ham, tongue, or bacon, must 
accompany this dish. 



Chicken and Fowl. 

Boil as turkey. A chicken will take about half an 
hour after the water boils, and a good sized fowl nearly 
an hour. Serve with parsley and butter, or with the fol- 
lowing sauce : — Melt in a teacupful of milk a large table- 
spoonful of butter kneaded in flour, beat up the yolk of 
an &^^ with a little cream, stir it into the butter, and heat 
over the fire, stirring continually. Ham, tongue, or 
pickled pork must be served with boiled fowl. If boiled 
in a cloth a few slices of lemon should be placed on the 
breast, and the bird covered with buttered writing paper. 



Another Way 

of boiling a fowl is to soak it in milk for one hour, tie it 
up in a cloth and put cold waler in a sauce-pan, place 
your fowl in, and put on a slow fire; when boiling, re- 
move it, and let simmer for about twenty minutes; then 
remove it altogether, and let it remain in the water ten 
minutes more. Serve with parsley chopped fine into 
some melted butter, a little salt, pepper, and some juice 
of lemon poured over; with the usual adjuncts. 

Boiled Fowl and Rice. 

Have some good clear mutton broth boiling in your 
saucepan; put in the fowl so that it is entirely covered; 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 99 

add one large onion, a little mace, bruised, pepper and 
salt. Let the whole simmer gently for about half an 
hour, when add one-third of a pound of well-washed and 
soaked rice. When the rice is soft and tender, take it 
out, strain it, and put it in the oven for a few minutes to 
dry. Your fowl being done, serve very hot with the rice 
in the dish, and parsley and butter separate. 

Another Method 

is to stuff the fowl with two dozen bearded oysters, and 
put in a jar. The jar should then be placed in a sauce- 
pan of boiling water, and boiled for nearly two hours. 
Take another dozen of oysters, scald them in their own 
liquor, add a gill of cream and the yolks of three eggs 
beaten. Mix with the gravy from the fowl, and serve 
very hot. 

Rabbit. 

Soak for a quarter of an hour in warm water. Either 
boil plain and serve with pickled pork or boiled ham, or 
prepare thus: — thicken the water in which it is to boil 
with a bit of butter covered with flour, and just as it 
boils, add a pint of milk, with salt and whole pepper; 
then put in the rabbit, with a quantity of onions cut into 
quarters, and stew gently until the rabbit is tender, from 
half to one hour, according to size; when ready, take out 
the onions, put into a separate saucepan with a little 
milk, butter, flour, and salt; when the sauce is well 
mixed, dish the rabbit, and pour the sauce over it. 
Mushrooms may be substituted for onions. 

Goose

ing milk poured over it, and then boiled, is very delicate, 



loo DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

thus: Put it into boiling water, and let it simmer until 
very tender. Then serve, smothered with onions and 
cream. Duck can also be cooked in this way. 

Partridges, Pheasants, &c., 

are seldom boiled. Dress like fowl, and do not stuff 
them. Parsley and butter, with just a soupcon of cayenne 
pepper, should be served in a tureen; and a sauce made 
of chopped parsley, half a pint of cream, with a little 
fresh butter, stirred together, and poured over the birds. 
If preferred, celery heads, cut fine, can take the place of 
the parsley. 



BOILING FISH. 



Put fish into cold water to boil, unless the fish are 
small, when warm water is best. Do not put into boiling 
water, unless specially directed. 

A little salt and vinegar should be added to the water 
just before the fish is ready to put in. 

Fresh-water fish must always be soaked in strong salt 
and water before cooking. 

Fish should always simmer gently, or the outside will 
break before the inside is done. 

A fish plate or strainer should be put in the kettle for 
the fish to lie upon. 

When the fish separates easily from the bone, (which 
can be ascertained by drawing up the plate), it is done, 
and must be at once taken out of the water. 

Recollect, fish must never be served underdone. 

Sea water is best, where it can be had, for the boiling 
of salt-water fish. 

The roe and liver should in most cases be placed in 
the dish by the side of the fish. 



DOMESTIC COOKER Y. loi 

Always serve fish on a hot napkin. 
Parsley, horseradish, and sliced lemon, are the best 
garnishings for fish. 

Salmon. 

When the fish is scaled and cleaned, put it into the 
kettle with cold water (with six to eight ounces of salt 
to each gallon) enough to quite cover it. Let it boil up 
pretty quickly, skim, and simmer until done. Then take 
it out and serve on a hot napkin, garnish with parsley 
and sliced lemon. Lobster sauce, shrimp sauce, and 
plain melted butter {see receipts), may all accompany 
this dish, as well as cucumber, either dressed or plain. 

Another, 

and by some considered a better way of boiling salmon, 
is to cut it in slices two inches thick, and simmer gently 
for about twenty minutes, and then serve as before. 

Many cooks advise putting salmon into boiling water, 
as it then eats firmer. Often, however, a fish cooked thus 
comes to table very hard. 

Collared Salmon. 

A thick slice, about four pounds, of a large fish is 
best; which is to be cut open, boned, and scaled. Then 
rub it all over with a seasoning of pounded mace, pepper, 
and salt, roll it up and tie. Simmer gently for about an 
hour in water (with a propoi-tion of one-fourth vine- 
gar), in which a few bay leaves have been thrown. Serve 
with anchovy sauce {see receipt), or plain melted butter. 

Salmon 
is also plain boiled in slices of two to three inches thick. 



102 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

It should be soaked in strong salt and water for half an 
hour, put into boiling water, simmered for about twenty 
minutes, with some horseradish in the water; and served 
the same as if boiled whole. 

Carp "witli Vinegar. 

Put into the kettle entire, with enough boiling vine- 
gar to cover it; simmer for an hour or more, according 
to size. Serve with parsley, without any of the liquid. 
Carp dressed in this way, however, is best eaten cold. 

Cod 

is seldom boiled whole, as a good sized head and shoul- 
ders is sufficient for a dish. To boil the head and shoulders^ 
first clean, and then rub salt over the thickest parts and 
inside, and let it remain so for a couple of hours. Tie it 
up with a broad tape, and put it on in cold water (with 
half a pound of salt to the gallon), sufficient to cover it. 
When the water boils (some cooks prefer to put a large 
head and shoulders into boiling water), draw the kettle 
to the corner of the fire, and let it simmer slowly for 
about twenty to twenty-five minutes. Skim very care- 
fully. Serve on a hot napkin with horseradish and sliced 
lemon. Oyster sauce and plain melted butter must ac- 
company. 

Cod 

is very often boiled in slices, which should soak in a 
mixture of salt, vinegar and water for nearly an hour. 
Boil as before, only not so long. 

Salt Cod 

should be obtained the day before wanted, and put into 
cold water with a little vinegar, and allowed to soak all 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 103 

night. Then put it on in cold water. Do not let it boil, 
but simmer gently until tender (say one hour). Skim 
frequently. Serve on a hot napkin in a dish garnished 
with hard-boiled eggs sliced, and parsley. Egg-sauce 
{see receipt), and boiled parsnips should be served 
with it. 

Salt Cod with Cream. 

Soak as above, and boil without vinegar; when done, 
pull into flakes, pour half a pint of rich cream over it, 
and serve with egg-sauce, and parsley and butter. 

Cod's Sounds 

should be soaked in salt and water for a short time, and 
then well washed. Boil quite tender in milk and water, 
and serve with &^^ sauce. 

Eels. 

The smaller ones are best for boiling. Put them — 
well cleaned and skinned — into warm water, with a 
bunch of parsley, simmer until tender (say half an hour). 
Serve with parsley and butter. 

Collared Eel. 

Take a large eel, bone and skin it, and dust over it a 
mixture of finely-powdered mace, cloves, and allspice, a 
few sage leaves and sweet herbs chopped very small, salt 
and pepper. Roll up, tie with tape, and boil till tender. 
Serve with plain melted butter. 

Elounders 
are boiled plain in water, with a little salt and vinegar. 



I04 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Let them simmer slowly for five or six minutes; serve 
with parsley and butter. 

Haddock 

may be plain boiled thus: — Put them on in boiling water, 
with a handful of salt; when done, they will rise to the 
surface, and must be immediately taken up; skim well 
while boiling; serve Avith melted butter, shrimp sauce, 
cream sauce, or anchovy sauce. 

Another Way 

is to make a few cuts on each side of the fish, and let it 
remain in salt for an hour or two — according to size; put 
into boiling water and simmer till tender. A fish of five 
pounds will take about half an hour. Garnish with 
parsley, and serve with egg sauce and boiled parsnips. 

Mackerel 

should be allowed to soak in salt and water for a quarter 
of an hour. Then put them on in hot water, with a little 
salt, and simmer gently for about half an hovir. When 
done the tails will split. The dish on which the fish is 
served should be garnished with fennel, and a sauce 
served with them of melted butter with chopped fennel 
or parsley, or green gooseberry sauce {see receipt). An- 
chovy sauce is sometimes served. Mackerel may be 
filleted, plain boiled, and served with parsley and butter. 

Mackerel Soused. 

When the mackerel are boiled, put half a pint of 
vinegar to a quart of the liquor in which the fish have 
been boiled, half an ounce of whole black pepper, two or 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 105 

three bay leaves, and a little mace ; let boil together for 
a short time, and when cold, pour it over the mackerel. 

Berch. 

Boil as directed for carp. About ten to fifteen 
minutes' gentle simmering will suffice. 

Pike 

must be scaled and have the gills removed, and be well 
washed — first in vinegar and water, and then in plain 
cold water. Make a stuffing of grated bread crumbs, 
butter, a few oysters, and a little parsley chopped very 
fine, some onions, pepper, salt, some fine herbs dried and 
rubbed to powder, binding the whole with an egg ; fill 
the inside and gills with this stuffing, and sew the fish up, 
and put on in boiling salt and water, with a little vinegar 
in it, and simmer for half an hour to one hour, accord- 
ing to size. Serve with melted butter and anchovy or 
oyster sauce. The tail is usually skewered in the mouth. 

Plaice 
should be plain boiled, and served with melted butter. 

Skate. 

Tliis fish is either boiled plain, or crimped, and served 
with melted butter, lobster or caper sauce. 

Crimped Skate 

is the most firm. The fish is crimped by drawing a knife 
through it, in lines, when first caught. Skate must be 
well done. It is dangerous to eat it out of season. 



io6 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Soles 

should be thoroughly washed and then plain boiled. 
Serve with shrimp or lobster sauce, and plain melted but- 
ter. They will require from five to ten minntes simmer- 
ing — according to size — after the water boils. 

Herrings. 

Simmer for about twenty minutes. Serve with the 
following sauce: put half a gill of cream in a little stew- 
pan, and when it boils add to it two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, a bit of fresh butter, and a little lemon 
juice, pepper and salt. 

Trout and Salmon Trout 

can both be boiled thus: — Put in boiling water, made pretty 
salt, and boil fast for about fifteen to twenty minutes; 
serve with melted butter. 

Lobster. 

Put into boiling water with a little salt, and keep boil- 
ing for twenty to forty-five minutes, according to size, 
skimming well. Lobsters are spoilt if done too much or 
not done enough, so that great care is necessary. A little 
sweet oil rubbed over the shell when done and then wiped 
off again, improves the appearance. 

Shrimps. 

To one gallon of water put two ounces of salt, one 
sprig of lemon thyme, one of mint, and a bayleaf. Boil. 
When boiling hard put one quart of shrimps into an open 
wire or wicker basket, which place in the water. The 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 107 

time the shrimps take to boll depends upon their size; 
but it may be known by their changing color. If boiled 
too much they are tasteless and indigestible. 



STEWING. 



For stewing meat should be put into cold water, only 
just sufficient to cover it. When it comes to the boil it 
must be carefully skimmed until no more scum rises, and 
then allowed to simmer very gently until the meat be- 
comes perfectly tender, and the gelatinous parts partially 
dissolved. 

A stew must never boil. 

Stewing does not require either so much water or so 
great a heat as boiling: it is the most economical of all 
modes of cooking, as many coarse meats, old poultry, and 
game, and different parts of animals, which, cooked any 
other way, would be uneatable, are rendered nutritious 
and savory. By stewing we obtain all the nutritious ele- 
ments of food, some of which are lost in roasting and 
boiling. 

Slow cooking is necessary, and meat may even be 
stewed over and over again, without injury, until it is 
sufficiently tender. 

Earthenware vessels are better than metal ones, be- 
cause they are longer getting hot, but retain their heat 
for a greater length of time. 

The quantity of water should be regulated by the 
kind of meat stewed. 

Salt is an invariable adjunct toetews. 

Rump of Beef. 
About half a rump makes an excellent dish. Remove 



io8 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

the bone, and tie up with broad tape. Put into a stew- 
pan with just enough stock (which see) to cover it. Add 
whatever vegetables are liked — sliced — such as onions, 
carrots, or turnips, and flavor the stock with cloves, 
savory herbs, vinegar, catsup, pepper and salt. The 
whole must then be allowed to simmer very gently until 
perfectly tender (from four to five hours), keeping it 
skimmed. When done strain the gravy the meat was 
boiled in, and thicken with a little butter and flour, put 
in a glass of port, Madeira, or other rich wine, let it boil 
up, and serve over the meat, very hot; garnish tlie dish 
with forcemeat balls and the vegetables boiled with the 
meat. 

Shin of Beef. 

Saw the bone in several pieces, put the meat in stock 
or water; when it boils, skim, and add a head of celery, 
a bunch of savory herbs, pepper, salt and allspice to 
taste. Cut up a few onions, carrots and turnips, and 
boil them till tender. When the beef is quite tender (say 
four hours) take out the liquor, and thicken half of it with 
batter and flour, season with pepper and salt; add a glass 
each of catsup and port wine, boil up, pour over the meat, 
and serve very hot, on a dish garnished with the boiled 
vegetables. Any pai-t of the ox may be stewed by cutting 
it into small pieces and gently simmering till tender with 
a little mace, cloves, and herbs. When half done add 
sliced vegetables, and if liked, parsley. Barley or rice 
may be added, as thickening to the stock. 

Irish Stew. 

To about three pounds of breast, loin, or neck of mut- 
ton, cut into moderate-sized pieces, put six pounds of 
potatoes and six or eight large onions, peeled and cut 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 109 

into thick slices. Put into a stewpan and add pepper 
and salt to taste. Pour over it about one to one and a 
half pint of water, and stew very gently, with the lid on 
always, until quite tender (say two to three hours). 
Shake the pan now and then to prevent burning. Serve 
very hot. This dish may also be prepared by putting 
exactly the same ingredients in a jar instead of a stew- 
pan, and baking in a moderate oven for about tv/o hours, 
or until quite tender. 

Breast of Lamb or Mutton. 

Cut in pieces, and stew very gently for about an hour 
and a quarter to an hour and three quarters, in good 
stock, sufficient to cover it. When done thicken the 
stock with butter and flour, add a glass of sherry or 
other white wine, boil up, and pour over the meat. 
Green peas, spinach, or mushrooms, may be stewed with 
this dish, and much improve it. 

Breast of Veal. 

Cut in pieces and fry to a good brown. Then turn 
into a stewpan with a little butter, savory herbs, pounded 
mace, onions, cloves, allspice, and grated lemon-peel, 
pepper and salt to taste. Cover the meat with water, and 
stew gently for about a couple of hours. Then thicken 
the gravy with butter and flour, add a couple of glasses 
of sherry, a tablespoonful each of catsup and tomato 
sauce, pour over the meat and serve. Green peas boiled 
separately may be served in the same dish, or they may 
be stewed with the veal. 

Fillet of Veal 

may be stewed whole with the same additions as above, a 
little lemon-juice and a dozen mushrooms. This joint 



no DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

must be stuffed with forcemeat and stewed very gently. 
Half an hour per pound should be allowed. 

Blnuckle of Veal 

should be stewed plain for an hour, and then have added 
half a pound of rice or macaroni, and the whole simmer 
for two hours longer. Serve with boiled bacon, and 
parsley and butter. 

Neck of Veal. 

Bake for half an hour in a brisk oven, and put in a 
stewpan of boiling water, with a few young carrots, 
green onions, and new potatoes, and a bunch of savory 
herbs. Stew for two hours. Serve with boiled green 
peas and forcemeat balls. 



STEWING POULTRY, &c. 

Pigeons 

may be stewed with fat bacon. The livers should be 
minced and added to the stock, the gravy thickened as 
before, and flavored with a little port wine or catsup. 
They will take about half an hour. 

Ducklings and Eabbits, 

can also be dressed in this manner. Forcemeat balls and 
a few onions may be added just before done. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. m 

Venison. 

The shoulder is the best joint. Bone and put into a 
pan rolled and tied up with slices of mutton or lamb fat, 
which have been soaked in port wine, seasoned with all- 
spice and whole pepper. Stew in good stock with a gill 
of port wine, till quite tender (say three hours and a half 
to four hours), and serve with the gravy over it, with red 
currant jelly. 



STEWING FISH. 



Carp. 

Put into a stewpan a quart of water and a bottle of 
port wine (or half these quantities, according to size of 
fish), and a little mace, fine herbs, young onions, pepper 
and salt, and a scraped horse-radish ; simmer very gently 
for an hour, or until tender, then take out the carp and 
drain into another pan, put a pint of port wine, two 
shredded anchovies, an onion, a little lemon-juice, a 
quarter of a pound of butter rubbed in flour, a little 
cream, and a half a pint of the liquor in which the carp 
were boiled ; boil together for a few minutes, then add 
the yolks of two eggs with cream, and juice of half a 
lemon ; dish with the sauce. 

Salt Cod. 

Put into a strong earthenware dish a slice of butter, 
some parsley and green onions chopped, pepper, and a 
few capers ; place the fish in layers in the dish, covering 
each with the seasoning. When the dish is full cover 
with bread crumbs ; stew gently over hot ashes until 
quite tender, and brown with a salamander. 



113 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Eels. 

Clean and skin the fish and cut into pieces ot three 
inches long, soalc in strong salt and water for one hour. 
Dry witli a cloth and fry them brown. Then put them in 
a stewpan with a pint of good stock — boiling — with a gill 
of port wine, a little essence of anchovy, lemon-juice, and 
cayenne, mace, salt and pepper to taste. Stew gently for 
about half an hour, and serve with gravy over them, very 
hot. 

Another Method 

is, after cleaning, cutting, and soaking them, to take an 
onion, two or three shallots, a little thyme, parsley, two 
or three bay leaves, pepper, a pint of gravy, half a pint 
of vinegar, and four bruised anchovies, put the whole, 
with a pint of port or French red wine, into a stewpan, 
and let them boil for about ten minutes, when take out 
the fish ; let the sauce continue boiling until consider- 
ably reduced ; thicken as before directed and serve. Or 
cream may be added to the gravy just before done. 

Lobster. 

Take all the meat of cold lobsters, and have ready a 
gravy, made by boiling the shells, previously pounded 
roughly, for a long time in water ; strain this liquor, and 
season it with pepper, salt, and mace ; thicken with flour 
and butter, and when thoroughly hot, put on the lobster, 
and heat it up ; just before serving add a little lemon- 
juice. Serve very hot. 

Salmon. 

When the fish is cleaned, cut it into slices, and stew 
gently in a rich white gravy. A little before serving, 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 113 

add two tablespoonfuls of soy, one of essence of anchovy, 
salt, some chopped parsley, and chives. 

Oysters. 

Scald one dozen oysters in their own liquor, and 
beard them. Put into a stewpan a little butter and suf- 
ficient flour to cover it, and the liquor of the oysters, 
strained, flavored with a blade of mace. When this boils 
add the oysters, a gill of cream, salt and cayenne to taste. 
Simmer for a couple of minutes, and serve with toast. 

Trout. 

Wash and dry thoroughly, and cut into thick slices ; 
put them in the pan with a little good stock, salt, pepper, 
and lemon-juice, and let it simmer until quite reduced ; 
then dish up the fish with a sauce made thus : — Put into 
a pan some crumb of bread, with a little butter, some 
parsley, shallots chopped very fine, pepper, salt, two or 
three cloves, a little nutmeg grated, a glass of French 
white wine, and one of good gravy ; let it boil until it 
becomes thick. Dish very hot. 



FRYING. 



Perhaps of all modes of cookery frying is the least 
nutritious and economical. All kinds of meats and vege- 
tables may, however, be fried and made tasty. The fry- 
ing-pan should be sufficiently large to allow the meat to 
lie flat at the bottom; and the fire should be brisk, clear, 
and free from blaze. If the meat to be fried is fat, the 
pan will need only to be greased to prevent sticking; but 



114 DOMESTIC COOKERY, 

in the case of veal cutlets, and other lean meats, butter, 
dripping, lard, or bacon will be necessary. Salt fat, from 
the liquor of boiling meat, is apt to fly and spurt, and 
therefore is unfit for frying; but fat used for frying will, 
if strained, serve for the same purpose again and again. 
Meat for frying should be slightly salted, peppered and 
floured, and when done, laid on a hot dish and the fat 
poured off for further use. If onions or other vegetables are 
to be fried, place them in the pan directly after the meat 
is removed and fry in the fat. When they are brown, pour 
off the fat, as before. Y ox gravies vc\7!i.d.Q in the frying-pan 
there are many receipts. This is 2i good plain gravy: — A 
teacup or more of cold gravy, broth, or water, with a 
spoonful of catsup or Worcester sauce, and a bit of but- 
ter the size of a walnut rolled in as much flour as it will 
carry; set on the fire and kept well shaken in the pan, till 
the gravy is smooth and thick. 

Sacon or Ham 

should be scalded a minute or two in water in the frying- 
pan. When the fat begins to run and becomes transpar- 
ent, pour off the liquor and brown the meat in its own 
fat. Liver should be fried over a slow fire, as it is apt 
to fly. 

Eggs 

are fried in a variety of forms, as in bacon fat, omelettes, 
&c. (for which see receipts). Each eg^ should be sepa- 
rately broken in a tea cup and gently poured into the pan, 
that the yolks may remain unbroken in the center of the 
whites when the whole is set, and the lower part fried to 
a delicate brown; take up each separately with a slice 
{see Omelettes). 

Fish 
should be dry and well floured; or they may be rubbed 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 115 

with white of egg and covered with fine bread crumbs. 
All Icinds of fish require much more fat than meats or 
vegetables: the fat may, however, be used for fish over 
and over again. Turn fish in the pan with a slice, and 
be careful in taking them up that they do not break. 

Sauteing 

is a mode of frying in a deep kind of frying-pan, or 
shallow saucepan, generally lined with earthenware. A 
moderate or small quantity of fat only is required. 
When it boils, put in the meat, &c., and keep the pan in 
motion till its contents are properly cooked. Chops, 
steaks, cutlets, pancakes, omelettes, fritters, small game, 
and poultry, kidneys, sweetoreads, potatoes sliced or cut 
in dice, vegetables, and fish are all sauted. The great 
point is to avoid over cooking, especially if the sauteing 
be only the preliminary process in the preparation of 
the dish. 

Fish to Fry. 

Skate, Soles, Plaice, Flounders, Mackerel, and fresh- 
water fish generally, are fried au naturel, in fat or butter, 
and served without sauce, which is added at table accord- 
ing to taste, in a dish garnished with parsley. Fresh- 
water fish must be laid for an hour or two in a bath of 
salt and water to remove the earthy flavor. 

Crimped Skate. 

Lay slices in butter for three or four hours, with salt, 
pepper, cloves, a little garlic, onions, parsley, and vine- 
gar, near enough to the fire to gently melt the butter. 
Then take out the slices and fry quickly in butter, and 
serve on a hot dish garnished with parsley. 



ii6 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Smelts. 

Wipe with a clean cloth, but do not wash; dredge 
with flour, or brush over with yolk of beaten ^^'g and 
roll in bread-crumbs, and fry in boiling dripping or lard 
till thoroughly brown. 

Soles. 

Take off the brown skin and scrape the other side. 
Wash well and place them in a cloth to dry; then rub 
well over with yolk of ^g'g well beaten, and cover with 
grated bread-crumbs; fry to a good color in boiling 
lard, and when done, lay them on a sieve before the fire 
to dry; serve with melted butter, and shrimp sauce, gar- 
nishing the dish with crimped parsley. The sieve may 
be covered with blotting paper to absorb the fat. 

Soles a la Italieune. 

Clean, cut off heads, and tails. Cover with chopped 
parsley, salt, pepper, a little powdered nutmeg, adding a 
good piece of butter, previously warmed. Fry over a 
quick fire, and turn as soon as one side is done. Serve 
with Italian sauce. 

Soles au Gratin. 

Rub a piece of butter on a silver or plated dish ; then 
fry for a short time some chopped fine herbs, shallots, 
chopped mushrooms, and salt and pepper ; when nicely 
browned put them in the dish, and place your soles upon 
them ; cover the soles with grated bread-crumbs ; add a 
little butter, and a small quantity of white wine. Cook 
gently under a braising pan, or over a slow charcoal fire;

slices of lemon, or lemon juice squeezed over, just pre- 
vious to sending to table. 

Sprats. 

Frying is the best way to cook these delicate fish. 
Wipe them dry, and flour well before putting them in 
the pan. Let them almost float in boiling fat or butter, 
and fry till they are well browned. Sprats are often fried 
in butter, when they make a nice dish. 

Trout. 

Cleanse, dredge with flour, rub with beaten yolk of 
^^'g, cover with bread-crurribs, fry to a good color, and 
serve with melted butter and lemon pickle. Small trout 
are dressed whole. In some parts of Scotland, trout are 
rubbed with oatmeal instead of flour, and some consider 
this improves the flavor. 

Herrings. 

Scale, cut off the fins, gut, and wipe dry, leaving in 
the roe or melt. Dredge with flour, and fry in boiling 
lard or oil to a good colof. Drain before the fire, and 
serve hot with melted butter, or parsley and butter. 
Some are partial to an onion sliced up and put into a 
sauce-boat, and boiling water poured over it, seasoned 
with pepper and salt. 

Eels. 

Cleanse ; cut into pieces of about three inches, scored 
across in two or three places without separating them ; 
dust with flour, and fry in boiling lard to a good brown, 
or dip in a batter, sprinkle with finely grated bread- 
crumbs; fry, and serve with melted butter. 



ii8 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Whitebait. 

This delicate little fish must be eaten fresh. Drain, 
and smother in flour ; shake off the superfluous flour, fry- 
in a pan of boiling lard till very slightly colored. If 
browned they are ruined. When cooked, lay them on a 
sieve, covered with blotting paper to absorb the fat, be- 
fore the fire. Dish very hot in a heap, with salt and 
pepper. Serve with halved lemons and brown bread and 
butter. 

Devilled Whitebait 

are cooked in the same way, with Cayenne pepper. In 
both cases they should be hot, crisp, and free from fat. 

Oysters. 

Boil for a minute in their own liquor and drain; fry 
in butter, seasoned with catsup, lemon-peel, and parsley, 
over a quick fire, and serve hot with fried potatoes. 



BROILING AND GRILLING. 

How to Broil Economically, 

Meats, fish, small poultry, and game may be broiled 
as a variety in cooking. First you must have a good 
clean fire, wirhout blaze; then set on your gridiron, and 
when the bars are hot through, wipe them thoroughly 
with a clean rag or paper, and rub them v/ith a morsel of 
suet or dripping to prevent the meat from sticking. Meat 
for broiling should be from half an inch to an inch thick: 
if thinner, it will be dry and hard; if thicker, the outside 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 119 

will be brown before the middle is sufficiently done. In 
broiling, meat should be frequently turned, and for this 
purpose a small pair of tongs is necessary, as the wound 
made by a fork lets out the gravy. Rump steaks, mutton 
and pork chops, and several kinds of fish are best broiled. 
The part of the ox, called beef -skirt, should be turned only 
once, when half done, and then peppered and salted to 
taste. Never cut broiling meat to see if it is done. That 
can be better ascertained by the smell, and by the little 
jets of steam from the meat. This also applies to all 
roast. Hot plates or dishes should be ready to receive 
the broil immediately it is fit to come from the fire. A 
bit of butter rubbed on a broiled steak in the dish will draw 
out the gravy and add to its appearance. Catsup and 
other sauces should be added hot in the dish. Though 
not the most economical mode of cooking, broiling is a 
decidedly toothsome, wholesome, and pleasant one, es- 
pecially agreeable to invalids and children. 

Broiled Fowl. 

Truss as for boiling, cut out the back-bone and press 
quite flat, season well with pepper, salt, and chopped 
shallots or small onions; fry upon both sides, take out, 
egg over with a paste-brush, dip into bread crumbs, place 
upon a gridiron, over a moderate fire, and broil a very 
light brown color, and serve with a little plain gravy, or 
mushroom sauce — of button mushrooms, simmered for 
ten minutes, with two tablespoonfuls of catsup, and a 
pat of butter. Pour the sauce in the dish over the fowl, 
and serve, 

Spitchcocked Eels. 

Cut large eels into pieces three or four inches long ; 
sprinkle with pepper and salt, beat up an Q^^, dip 
them into it, and cover them afterwards with a mixture 
of bread crumbs, chopped parsley, and pepper and salt ; 



1 2 o D OMES TIC CO OKER Y. 

broil and serve with melted butter, parsley and butter, or 
with mustard sauce. 

Sturgeon Steaks. 

I 

Cut into steaks, season with pepper and salt in melted 
butter, and cover with bread crumbs, after having rubbed 
them over with yolks of eggs well beaten ; broil to a 
good color, and serve with rich sauce, or melted butter. 
To make them look best at table, they should be broiled 
in buttered paper. 

Kippered or dried Salmon. 

Cut up the back and take out the bone ; wipe clean, 
score the fish, pepper, and broil. Sabnon Steaks are 
broiled in buttered paper or between slices of bread, 
over a slow fire. Serve with melted butter and savory 
sauce. 

Mackerel. 

Clean, split, wipe dry, pepper and salt and broil 
thoroughly. The French broil mackerel in buttered 
paper, and serve with chopped herbs and melted butter. 
A small mackerel will take about ten minutes to broil. 

Game 

is broiled and served in various ways, for which see 
receipts. 



TOASTING. 

How to Toast. 
Bread for buttered toast, sippets for made dishes, 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 121 

game, toast and water, &c., should be held pretty close 
to a bright fire and frequently turned ; the whole success 
of the process being found in its likeness to roasting. 

Savory Toast. 

Cut slices of bread free from crust, about half an inch 
thick and two inches and a half square ; butler the tops 
thickly, spread a little mustard on them, and then cover 
them with a deep layer of grated cheese and ham, sea- 
soned with cayenne ; fry in butter, but do not turn them 
in the pan ; place in a Dutch oven for four minutes to 
dissolve the cheese. Serve very hot. 



Welsh Rarebits 

are served on toast. Toasted Cheese is prepared in a 
patty-pan and toasted before a clear fire. 



CARVING. 



It is important that every one, especially the head of 
every family, should know how to carve a joint of meat, 
a head of game, a fowl, or other kind of poultry; for 
what can be more awkward than to be placed before a 
dish without being able to help it properly ? Good carv- 
ing is also economical; for a joint well carved may be 
thoroughly served without an ounce being wasted, while 
everyone at table gets a due proportion of well-done 
and under-done, fat and lean, tit-bit and gravy. Carving 
requires some knowledge of the nature of the joint or 
the anatomy of the birds, fish, hare, &c., usually eaten as 
food. It also requires nerve, steadiness, and practice. 



122 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Never stand up to carve; nothing is more vulgar. Let 
your knife be sliarp, but not your temper; and wlien- 
ever you have to carve for a large party remember that 
expedition is a sort of grace of itself. 

Sirloin of Eeef. 

The ordinary way to carve this famous joint is to cut 
from the chine-bone to the flap, directly in the center, 
helping slices from either side, giving a piece of fat with 
every plate. But a more economical plan is to cut thin 
slices from the chine-bone downwards. Some persons 
prefer the under side or fillet. In the latter case the 
fillet side is laid uppermost in the dish; the undercut is 
best when hot, 

Ribs of Beef. 

Cut same as sirloin; but as it has no under-cut, it may 
be cut in thin slices from the thick end to the flap, with 
slices of the latter. 

Round of Beef. 

After removing a slice all round, cut thin slices 
evenly, so as not to disfigure the joint; helping fat with 
each plate. 

Aitchbone of Beef. 

This joint is sometimes roasted; but whether roasted 
or boiled, it is carved in a very simple manner, by slices, 
with a portion of the fat from the under side. 

Brisket of Beef. 

Cut lengthv/ise down to the bone, after removing the 
outside slice; the soft fat lies beneath. Avoid all ragged 



DOMES TIC COOKER V. 123 

or jagged cuts, which spoil tiie look of the joint when 
cold. 

Tongue. 

Begin three inches from the tip, serve thin slanting 
slices, with a portion of the fat at the root with every 
plate. 

Roast Leg of Mutton. 

Some persons carve a leg of mutton like a ham, in 
slices towards the middle, which is an economical plan, 
and leaves the cold joint of good shape. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton. 

This is sent to table with fat side uppermost. The 
wether leg has a round lump of fat at the edge of the 
broadest part. The best part of the joint is in the middle, 
between the knuckle and further end. Begin by cutting 
thin deep slices. Take slices of fat from the end. Many 
prefer the knuckle part, whicli is in general tender. 
Good slices may be cut on the back of the leg ; turn it 
up, and cut at the broad end, longways, different from 
the direction taken on the opposite side. For the cramp- 
bone, cut down to the thigh-bone ; then pass the knife 
under the cramp-bone. 

Haunch of Mutton. 

Make a deep cut down to the bone near the knuckle, 
which will let the gravy escape. Then cut slices length- 
wise from the cross-cut to the end. 

Saddle of Mutton. 

This, the best joint of the sheep, consists of the two 
loins. It is to be carved by making a deep cut from end 



124 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

tc end, right through the middle, and serving slices on 
either side, with a portion of fat to each. Some carvers 
take slices from the thick part obliquely. 

Loin of Mutton. 

Carve in chops, which should be easily removed if 
the butcher has properly chopped the bones. 



Shoulder of Mutton. 

Is usually served with the back part uppermost. Cut 
in the hollow part ; the knife should pass down to the 
bone. The best fat is on the outside edge, and should 
be cut in thin slices. Some nice slices may be obtained 
on each side of the blade-bone. On the under side, there 
are two parts full of gravy. 



Fore Quarter of Lamb. 

Remove the shoulder from the breast and ribs, by 
passing your knife towards you in a horizontal position. 
Lay the shoulder aside or in another dish. Squeeze the 
juice of a lemon on the other part, with a little pepper 
and salt ; then divide tlie gristly part from the ribs and 
help either from that or the ribs as desired. 



Breast of Veal. 

The richest part is called the brisket. Insert the knife 
about four inches from the brisket, and cut through so 
as to separate it from the ribs. Then serve according to 
the taste of the company. The sweetbread is usually 
sent to table with this joint. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 125 

FiUet of Veal 

is carved like round of beef ; the slices should be even 
and rather thin. Help stuffing with each portion. 

Calf s Head. 

Cut long thin slicesof the cheek lengthways, and help 
with a little bit of neck, ear, or palate. The tongue and 
brains are served separate. 

Roast Sucking Fig. 

Before bringing to table the head is taken ofif and 
divided. The body is also divided from end to end. At 
table the carver first removes the legs and shoulders. 
This is easily done if the knife be sharp and held flat. 
Then the ribs, which are esteemed the best parts, are cut 
in slices, and served with the regular sauce or stufiing. 

Roast Leg of Pork. 

When cooked with the crackling on, the latter should 
have been well scored. Carve in slices through the 
thickness of the joint. 

. Boiled Leg of Pork. 

Carve in thin slices from the thick end, slanting to- 
wards the knvickle. Sometimes the bone is removed, so 
as to enable the carver to cut slices right through ; but 
this is not an elegant plan. 

Ham. 

There are various ways of carving a ham ; but the best 
and most usual is to begin in the middle by taking long 



T26 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

thin slices through the thick fat. By this plan we get to 
the prime part at once. A more economical way is to cut 
^thin circular slices. The former is the better way for hot, 
and the latter for cold ham. 



Turkey. 

Whether roasted or boiled, a turkey is served up like 
a fowl, and cut up in the same way as a pheasant. The 
best parts are the breast, wings, and neck-bones. The 
neck itself is taken away, and the cavity under the breast 
stuffed with forcemeat, which must be cut into thin slices 
from the rump to the neck, and a portion given with 
each piece of the turkey. The common practice is not to 
cut up more than the breast, or one of the wings ; but 
this must be regulated by circumstances, and the number 
of guests at table. 

Goose. 

Remove the apron, pour into the body a glass of port 
wine, and a large spoonful of mustard, previously mixed. 
Bring the neck end toward you, and cut the breast in 
long slices, from one wing to another. In taking off the 
leg, put the fork into the small end of the bone, pressing 
it to the body, and having passed the knife, turn the leg 
back, and if the goose be young, the joint will easily sep- 
arate. To take off the wing, put the fork into the small 
end of the pinion, and press it close; then insert the knife, 
and divide the joint. The best parts of the goose are the 
slices on the breast; the flesh of the wing, divided from the 
pinion; the thigh-bone, which may be separated easily 
from the drum-stick or bone of the leg; the pinion, and 
next the side-bones. Take sage and onion stuffing from 
the body with a spoon, at the place where the apron lay, 
and then mix with the gravy, which should be poured 
into the goose before any person is served. 



£>OMES TIC COOKER V. 127 

Fowls. 

The legs of a boiled fowl are bent inward, and tucked 
under with skewers, which must be removed. Separate 
the wing, first dividing the joint; and then with your 
fork lift up the pinion, and draw the wing towards the 
legs, and the muscles will part better than if cut. Insert 
the knife between the leg and body, and cut to the bone; 
then turn the leg back, and the joint will yield easily, if 
the fowl be young. When the quarters are removed, take 
off the merrythought, and then the neck bones; and press- 
ing the knife under the long broad part of the bone, in 
the direction, lift it up, and break it off from the part 
that adheres to the breast. To divide this from the car- 
cass, cut through the tender ribs, close down to the end. 
Next lay the back upwards; the knife next the bone, half 
way from the neck to the rump, and on raising the lower 
part, it will divide with ease. Turn the rump from you, 
and take off the two sidesmen, — which completes the pro- 
cess. As each part is taken off, it should be turned neatly 
on the dish; and care taken, that what is left goes prop- 
erly from the table. The breast and wings are the choic- 
est parts; but the legs, in younger fowls, are the most 
juicy. 

Whether roast or boiled, fowls are carved in the same 
way. 

Pheasant. 

Fix your fork in the middle of the breast ; cut down 
in slices, take off the leg on one side, then separate the 
wing on the same side ; after which, remove the leg and 
wing on the opposite side, and then cut off the slices of 
the breast, which were before divided. In taking off the 
wings, be careful not to cut too near the neck. Cut off 
the merrythought by passing the knife under it towards 
the neck. The other parts are to be divided as in a fowl. 



128 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

The breast, wings, and merrythought are the most 
esteemed, but the leg has the richest flavor. 

Partridge. 

Cut off the wings and the merrythought. The parts 
most preferred are the wings, breast, and merrytliought ; 
but from the smallness of the bird the two latter are sel- 
dom divided. The wing is the best, and the tip of it is 
by epicures deemed most delicious. 

Pigeons. 

Cut in two lengthways and serve a half to each 
person. 

Snipes, Plovers, Woodcocks 

and other small game should be treated in the same 
manner. When they are large the wings and legs may 
be removed and served separately, making six helps of 
each. 

As a rule poultry should never be wholly cut up at 
table, but simply divided; but game should, as many 
prefer the backbone. 

Hare. 

Put your knife in and cut down to the rump, on one 
side of the backbone. Do the same thing on the other 
side. Cut the back into four, cut the shoulder off. 
When all your joints are before you help with stuffing 
to each. When all are served cut off the head, and 
separate the jaws ; then split the head, and serve the ears 
and brains as required. 

Rabbit. 

As for hare. Boiled rabbit is jointed, the head divided, 



DOMESTIC COOKER V. 1-29 

and the back cut into three or four pieces, breadthwise ; 
then help with stuffing to each portion where used. 

Salmon. 

Cut down the middle of the side to the bone length- 
ways, and take slices from that cut; serve each portion 
with a little piece of the belly, which is fattest and most 
delicate. 

Cod's Head and Shoulders. 

Cut across from the back downwards to the thin part, 
taking care not to break the flakes; serve a piece of the 
sound to each person. 

Mackerel 

should be divided into four — that is, the fish stripped up 
the middle, and each side divided into two, leaving the 
bone and head on the dish. 



Eels 

are cut into small pieces and served a thick and a thin 
piece together. 

Soles, 

if fried, should be divided quite across; if boiled, serve 
large ones like turbot, and small ones like mackerel.

SOUPS. 

Stock. 

All meat soups have " stock " for their basis. Beef 
and veal make the best stock, but mutton, if previously- 
broiled or roasted, is very good. The Stock-pot should be 
made the receptacle of all sorts of meat bones, either 
broken or crushed, as the large proportion of gelatinous 
matter they contain is the basis or jelly of the stock, to 
which it can be added at pleasure. 

Rub a large stewpan, or better still, a fire-proof 
earthenware jar or pan, with a little butter, and put into 
it one pound of ham without fat or skin, four pounds of 
leg or neck of veal, and three pounds of lean beef, all 
cut into thin slices, or small pieces; set over a clear fire 
till the meat is equally browned; move it often so that it 
does not stick to the pan nor burn. Place the bones 
upon it, and pour in gradually one gallon of cold water. 
Take off the scum as it rises, and throw in at intervals a 
little cold water and salt, to bring it quickly to the sur- 
face. When no more scum appears, put in two ounces 
of salt, three onions, three carrots, two turnips, one head 
of celery, two ounces of savory herbs, one dozen of 
cloves, three-quarters of an ounce of white pepper 
(whole), and three blades of mace. Allow to simmer 
gently for five or six hours, and then strain. When cold 
remove the fat from the top; and, in taking out the soup, 
leave the sediment untouched, and pass the soup through 
a fine hair sieve. It is then ready for use, and when re- 
quired, take out the quantity demanded for table, and 
add a little mushroom catsup. 

Another good Stock 

is made thus: — Cut up small a fine knuckle of veal — say- 
seven or seven and a half pounds — and a piece of lean 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 131 

ham — say half to three-quarters of a pound. Rub with 
butter or clarified dripping the bottom of your stewpan 
(the proper size for this quantity of meat is from two to 
two and a half gallons). Put your meat into this pan 
with a little water — say one pint — a handful of salt, two 
or three onions, a small head of celery, a carrot, or two 
small ones, and a turnip. Cover your pan, and place 
over a brisk fire and stir now and then, till a thick white 
jelly-like substance covers the bottom of the pan. It is 
then time to add the water, so fill up the pan with cold 
water, and let it remain until almost boiling, but do not let 
it boil. Then put on one side, and let it simmer very 
gently for three to four hours, skimming thoroughly at 
intervals. Strain through a hair sieve and keep for use. 

If beef be used in the place of the veal at least six 
hours must be allowed for simmering. A little more 
meat will be required — say eight and a half pounds in- 
stead of seven and a half. 

Instead of cutting up the knuckle of veal so small, 
you may leave it in pieces of about a pound, the ham 
being entire, and the meat may be eaten hot with a little 
of the broth. Allow four to five hours. 

Another Mode 

is to cut beef from its bones, and roll lightly in flour, 
seasoned with pepper and salt; fry until a light brown. 
Put into the pan with a pint of cold water to each pound 
of beef, and vegetables as before, and stew gently for 
about six hours. 

Trimmings of poultry, the remains of rabbits, part- 
ridges, or other game, and in fact, any pieces of clean and 
sweet meat, or bone, cooked or uncooked — are useful in 
the stock-pot. 

White Stock. 
Cut up small four pounds of knuckle of veal, and put 



132 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

it into your pan (previously rubbed with butter), with any 
poultry bones and trimmings, half a dozen slices of lean 
ham, and a glass of water ; simmer gently till the gravy 
fiows. Then add a gallon of cold water, two sliced car- 
rots, two or three small onions, a few white peppercorns, 
a small handful of salt, a bunch of savqry herbs, and a 
blade of mace. Simmer gently for fully five hours, 
skimming constantly. Strain through a very fine hair 
sieve, and it is ready for use. If this stock be not strong 
enough, more veal may be added, but this will be found 
good enough for use in the preparation of most white 
soups. 

Stock, to Clarify. 

When, by accident, stock is not clear, put it into a 
stewpan, take off any scum as it rises, and let the 
rest boil. Take out half a pint of the stock, and add it 
gradually to the tvhites of three eggs (previously whisked 
well in half a pint of cold water) ; then put the whisk 
into the stewpan, and keep the liquid well agitated while 
you pour in the whites of ^^^ and stock you have mixed; 
let the whole nearly boil, and then take it from the fire. 
After a time, the whites will separate themselves, when 
the whole should be passed through a clean fine cloth, 
and the stock should be clear. If not, repeat the process. 



Browning. 

Put two ounces of sugar in a stewpan, and let it melt 
slowly; stir with a wooden spoon, and when black add 
half a pint of cold water, and let it dissolve. If corked 
closely, this will keep for a long time. Burnt onions 
are also used for the purposes of browning. As a rule, 
use this coloring matter very sparingly, as it is liable 
to flavor the soup. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 133 

Plain Beef Soup, 

called in French, Pot an Ecu, may be made tnus : — Take 
three pounds of good rump of beef, or any other lean 
part, put it into a fire-proof earthen pot, with three 
quarts of water, one large carrot, two or three turnips, 
two leeks, a head of celery, and one burnt onion, add 
pepper and salt, and let the soup boil slowly, skimming 
it from time to time, for at least five hours ; when the 
soup is ready, strain it through a fine hair sieve, then 
pour it over thin slices of bread, and serve it up. The 
meat and vegetables make a disli, which is served up 
after the soup. 

Another receipt 

for " Pot ati Eeti." — Take one and a half pounds of beef, 
three to six ounces of broken bones, and an ounce of 
salt, and put them in your stewpan, with three quarts of 
cold water ; let it boil up, and as soon as the scum 
rises, put in a dash of cold water, and remove the 
scum. It should then be quite clear. Add (peeled and 
sliced fine) a quarter of a pound each of turnips, car- 
rots, onions, ieeks, and parsnips ; a little celery (cut 
fine), a clove or two, pepper and salt. Let it all boil up 
again, and then allow it to simmer very gently for about 
three hours. Take all the fat off the soup, remove the 
meat, — which serve separate, with a little of the soup 
over it — and serve hot. 

Cottage Soup. 

Cut a pound of salt beef into very small pieces, and 
let it simmer gently in a gallon of water for thirty or 
forty minutes; then put in some carrots, turnips, pota- 
toes, and a cabbage, all sliced. Let this boil slowly 
another hour, and then thicken with a pint of oatmeal, 
stirring to keep it smooth. Season it with pepper and 



134 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

salt, and serve very hot. More meat may be used, but 
with the above quantity, a very palatable soup is ob- 
tained. 

Oxtail Soup. 

Cut up two good tails into pieces about an inch and a 
half long, and soak for a couple of hours in cold water. 
Put them into a stewpan, with a bunch of sweet herbs, a 
little whole pepper, two onions, a carrot, and a turnip; 
add four quarts of cold water, and cover; when it boils, 
throw in an ounce of salt, and as the scum rises, skim it, 
and let it simmer for three hours; remove the fat, add a 
small quantity of vinegar, half a pint of Burgundy or 
port wine; before serving, the vegetables and herbs should 
be taken out. 

Another mode 

is to take three tails, wash and soak them as before, but 
do not cut them up. Put them on a moderate fire in a 
gallon of cold water. When they boil, throw in a small 
handful of salt, and skim carefully till no more scum 
rises. Then add four moderate-sized carrots, two or three 
onions, a large head of celery — all sliced thin — a large 
bunch of savory herbs, two turnips, eight cloves, and 
half a teaspoonf ul of peppercorns. Stew gently for three 
hours and a half. If the tails be very large, lift them out, 
strain the liquor, and all the fat. Cut the meat from the 
tails, and put it into two quarts, or rather more, of the 
stock; stir in, and let the whole just boil up, when serve, 
flavored with cayenne and salt. The herbs, cloves, and 
peppercorns must be removed, but the vegetables may re- 
main if a thickening is added. Rice-flour or arrowroot 
is the best for this purpose. Thick soups should be of the 
consistency of good cream, and clear soups must be quite 
transparent. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 135 

Eeal Turtle Soup. 

It is unwise to attempt to make turtle soup at home 
unless you have a first-rate professed cook. By far the 
best and cheapest way is to buy it ready made, by the 
quart, of a good cook or hotel-keeper. 

Mock-Turtle Soup. 

Parboil a calf's head, remove the skin, and cut it and 
the meat into small pieces; skin and slice the tongue, 
and put the whole into the stewpan with about three 
quarts of cold water, and a pint of Madeira, or a bottle 
of pale golden sherry. Simmer gently for two hours ; 
season with cayenne, mace, salt, and a little lemon peel ; 
mix two tablespoonfuis of flour in a little of the soup, 
and stir it into the stewpan, adding at the same time a 
little lemon juice, and the yolks of six hard eggs ; let the 
whole simmer for about a quarter of an hour, and serve 
very hot. A dozen forcemeat balls may be added just 
before the flour is put in. They should be made by mix- 
ing the brains with a little grated bread, finely minced 
suet, salt, pepper, nutmeg and chopped parsley ; make 
into balls with the yolks and whites of two eggs beaten, 
and fry to a good color in boiling dripping. 

Another receipt 

is to take half a calf's head, not skinned, and a pound of 
good pickled pork. Wash and soak both, and put them 
into your pan ; add one onion, a head of celery (both 
cut in' slices), sweet herbs, mace, and pepper ; cover with 
about one gallon of water, and boil gently till the meat 
is tender : then take out the head and the pork ; separate 
the meat from the bones, return the latter into the soup, 
let them simmer gently for three hours, and then pour 
into a pan to cool ; cut the meat into small square pieces, 



136 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

and prepare a few q^% balls and forcemeat balls (made 
as in previous receipt) ; take the fat off the soup, and 
then return it to the stevvpan, and, when quite hot, strain 
it through a fine hair sieve ; then put in the calf's head 
and. pork ; add the forcemeat and egg balls, cayenne 
pepper, and the juice of half a lemon ; let the whole 
simmer for a short time, and it will be fit for use. If 
you wish to brown the above, put a little of the fat into 
the frying-pan ; dredge with flour ; fry brown, stir, and 
return to the soup, and stir well in. If preferred only a 
portion of the cut-up calf's head and pork need be served 
in the soup. Several modifications of the above receipts 
could be given. Knuckle of veal, and a little lean ham 
is sometimes substituted for the pickled pork ; adding a 
little cream just before serving, or — when served brown 
— a couple of glasses of golden sherry. 

Mulligatawny Soup. 

One of the best methods of making this soup is : — 
Cut into small pieces a knuckle of veal, and put into 
your pan with a little lean ham, and a bit of butter. Peel 
and cut into slices four large apples, two onions, a small 
turnip, and a carrot ; add a glass of cold water, and put 
over a sharp fire until the bottom of the pan is covered 
with jelly, moving the pan now and then. Add three 
spoonfuls of curry powder, one ounce of pounded al- 
monds, and three heaped tablespoonfuls of flour; stir 
this in, and then put in a gallon of cold water with a 
teaspoonful of salt, and a dust of sugar. When it boils 
up, put it on one side of the fire, and simmer for nearly 
three hours, skimming constantly. Pass through a tammy 
into your tureen, and serve. The pieces of veal may be 
sent to table separate, with plain boiled rice. 

Another Receipt. 
Crack the bones of a knuckle of veal in two or three 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 137 

places ; put into a pan, cover with water, and when half 
done, cut off the meat you wish for the soup, and boil 
the bones and the remainder of the meat to make the 
stock ; let this stand until cold, remove the fat ; cut the 
meat into small pieces, and fry in butter, with four onions 
sliced and floured, two or three dessert-spoonfuls of 
curry powoer, add Cayenne and vSalt ; put these into the 
stewpan ; add the stock gravy with three cloves, and a 
table-spoonful of lemon juice ; let the whole simmer for 
an hour at least, and serve with plain boiled rice in a 
separate dish. (9r, in a quart of strong stock — made as 
previously directed — stew half a pound of butter with 
half a dozen large onions, a couple of dozen of carrots, 
and as many turnips, all these vegetables being peeled 
and cut into thiu slices. When quite tender, §train off, 
and remove the vegetables ; add to the stock in which 
they were stewed, about three quarts more of good plain 
stock, a handful of bread-crumbs, and two table-spoon- 
fuls of curry powder ; take a fowl cut into pieces, and 
fry with butter ; Avhen brown put it into the pan with the 
stock ; simmer for nearly three hours, the fat being taken 
off from time to time ; just before ready, mix two table- 
spoonfuls of arrowroot in a little water, and put it into 
the pan, stirring well, until the soup becomes of the con- 
sistency of good cream. Flavor with salt and Cayenne. 
Some persons serve the vegetables in the soup, but that 
is entirely a matter of taste. 

Soup Julienne 

may be made thus: — Peel and slice very fine (so that 
there are no pieces thicker than a straw, or longer than 
an inch), in any quantity, according to the number of 
persons, equal parts of leeks, carrots, parsnips, onions, 
turnips, celery, and potatoes; add an equal proportion 
of finely chopped lettuce, and a little sorrel and parsley; 



138 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

let these be about half cooked in a saucepan with suffi- 
cient fresh butter to prevent their burning; when they are 
all of a good brown, add sufficient beef stock to make 
the quantity of soup required; simmer gently for an 
hour, season Avith pepper and salt, and serve without 
straining. If there be no beef stock on hand, make some, 
as previously directed, for the purpose, in a separate pan. 

Another Eeceipt. 

Cut six pounds of beef into pieces of one pound each; 
put in a pan with a bit of butter and a glass of water; 
move the meat about until the glaze or jelly covers the 
bottom of the pan; then add a gallon of cold water, two 
ounces of salt, three onions (with a clove in each), two 
turnips, two carrots, a head of celery, leek, and a bunch 
of parsley, thyme, and bay-leaf; when boiling, put in two 
burnt onions (make these by baking in a slow oven until 
quite black, but not cinders); simmer for three hours, 
keeping it well skimmed, then pass the broth through a 
hair sieve into a stewpan; )^ou have previously cut two 
middling-sized carrots, two turnips, an onion, a leek, and 
a little celery into very thin strips, as before; put them 
in another stewpan with two ounces of butter and a tea- 
spoonful of powdered sugar; place upon a sharp fire, 
tossing them over occasionally until well fried and look- 
ing transparent, then put them into the broth with the 
half of a young cos-lettuce, and a little tarragon and 
shervil; when it boils skim off all the butter; let it sim- 
mer until the vegetables are perfectly tender, when serve. 
The beef may be sent to table upon a separate dish. 

Eel Soup. 

Take half a dozen good-sized eels, and clean them 
well; cut them into small pieces and put into your pan 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 139 

with a little butter and a couple of bruised or broken 
onions, (this is better than slicing them for this soup), 
and let them remain over a sharp fire for five minutes; 
cover with boiling water, remove the scum, and fidd m;irr, 
pepper, salt, sweet herbs and parsley; stew them very 
slowly a couple of hours, and strain them. Thicken the 
liquor with a little cream, or flour and butter, mixed 
gradually, and serve with sippets of toasted bread. The 
pieces of eel may either be served in the soup or separate. 

Oyster Soup. 

Put into a stewpan a quart of cold water, a quart of 
new milk, half a pound of fresh butter rolled in flour, 
pepper and salt. When this is just warm add the liquor 
— strained — of five dozen oysters, and let this boil for a 
few minutes, and tlien set it aside to cool. Then beard 
the oysters, add them to the liquor, and boil the whole 
sharply for two minutes, serve with a dust of nutmeg. 
Mussels may be substituted for oysters. Essence of an- 
chovies and Harvey sauce improve the flavor of this 
soup. 

Babbit Soup. 

Cut a good-sized rabbit into joints, and soak in cold 
water for an hour ; then dry and fry brown in butter, 
with three or four onions cut in slices ; when done, put 
into a stewpan, with three quarts of cold water, a pint of 
split peas, pepper and salt, and stew very gently for five 
hours ; then strain and serve hot. The rabbit is best 
served separate with a little pickled pork. 

Hare Soup. 

Melt six or eight ounces of fresh butter in a stewpan, 
and add twelve ounces of flour, and half a pound of fat 



14 o DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

bacon, cut small ; stir till of a light brown. Then, hav- 
ing cleaned and soaked your hare, cut it up into small 
pieces, put them in the pan, and stir till all is nicely set; 
then fill up with one gallon of cold water, a couple of 
sliced onions, a head of celery, cut small, a bunch of 
savory herbs, and a few cloves ; when it boils up put 
in a handful of salt, skim carefully, and simmer until 
the hare is tender — say from one to two hours, according 
to the age of the hare. Take out the hare and pass the 
remainder through a hair sieve ; put it and the pieces of 
hare back into the pan with a gill of port wine ; boil for 
ten minutes, and serve very hot. 

This soup is improved if some of the more unsightly 
pieces of the hare are pounded in a mortar, before 
being restored to the soup for the last boil, and added to 
the soup in that form. 

Griblet Soup. 

Clean two sets of goose or duck giblets, and soak 
them for two hours in cold water. Cut them into equal 
sizes, except the gizzards, which should be smaller, and 
scald. Then put them into your stewpan with three 
pounds of shin of beef, half a pound of lean ham, three 
ounces of fresh butter, two each of carrots, turnips, and 
onions, peeled and sliced, a handful of salt, a large bunch 
of savory herbs, pepper and salt. Put over a sharp 
fire until the glaze forms on the bottom of the pan ; then 
stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour, and fill up with a gal- 
lon of cold water and a little good brown gravy {see re- 
ceipt). Stir till boiling ; skim and simmer gently till 
the giblets are quite tender, when take them out and put 
them in the tureen. Strain the soup through a hair sieve, 
add a gill of cream and an ounce of fresh butter rolled 
in flour, give it one boil, and then pour over the giblets 
and serve. 

A glass of port wine or mushroom catsup may be 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 141 

substituted for the cream. A few button onions, plain 
boiled, may also be dropped into the tureen. 

Clear Vegetable Soup. 

A carrot and a turnip, peeled and cut very small, and 
a couple of dozen button onions, peeled, must be washed 
and drained. Then put them in your stewpan with a 
little powdered sugar and about two ounces of butter, 
and let them be over a sharp fire for about ten minutes, 
or till they are covered with a thin coating of " glaze " — 
they must not brown ; then pour over them three pints 
of clear broth and let simmer till quite tender, skimming 
all the time. This will take about half an hour. 

Carrot Soup. 

Any beef or poultry bones, or remains of veal may be 
put on with about one pound of fresh beef, in a little 
water with a sliced onion and six or eight large carrots. 
After several hours' stewing, strain the soup, put the car- 
rots into it, and let it stand in a covered earthenware 
vessel till next day. Then take off the fat, and after 
making the soup and carrots hot, pulp them through a 
colander, and then through a fine hair sieve ; add this 
pulp with a little salt, black pepper, cayenne, and any 
other spice you like, to the soup, give it a boil, and just 
before serving add half a pint of cream, or good milk, 
and if you wish it to be very rich, an ounce of butter 
rolled in flour. 

Spring Soup. 

Take a quart of young green peas and a quantity of 
lettuce, sorrel, parsley, spinach, and young spring onions 
— all thorougly cleaned and cut into small pieces. Put 
them into your stewpan with a pint of stock, a couple of 
ounces of fresh butter, pepper and salt. Stew gently, 



142 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

turning them over occasionally, until all are quite ten- 
der. Then pass them through a hair sieve, and add two 
or three quarts more stock, according as you like your 
soup thick or thin; throw in a little boiled rice or bread- 
crumbs, simmer for twenty minutes, skimming and stir- 
ring, and serve. 



Onion Soup. 

Have ready in your pan a quarter of a pound of fresh 
butter; peel, and cut into small dice a dozen large onions, 
put over a sharp fire, and fry to a light brown, then add 
three tablespoonfuls of flour, mix well, and a quart of 
water, simmer till the onions are quite tender, season 
with salt and sugar, and serve. Some cooks add a little 
grated cheese; but this is optional. 

Cabbage Soup. 

A fine large cabbage must be cleaned, and then cut 
up small, very small, and put into a quart of water, with 
two or three minced potatoes, a fagot of sweet herbs, a 
couple of sliced onions, and a couple of ounces of lard 
or fat bacon. Simmer gently for four hours, skimming 
as before. Serve very hot, with slices of brown bread. 



Parsnip Soup. 

Put a quarter of a pound of fresh butter into your 
pan, put it over a gentle fire, and when melted, slice in 
two pounds of sweet parsnips, stew very softly till ten- 
der, moving them about from time to time; add enough 
broth to cover it, and simmer gently for half an hour; 
press through a hair sieve, and add two or three pints of 
good stock {see receipt), season with cayenne, white pep- 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 143 

per and salt; boil up, skim, and serve very hot with 
fried sippets. 

Vermicelli Soup. 

Nothing is required but clear stock and vermicelli, in 
the proportion of half a pound of the latter to a gallon 
of the former. When the stock boils, add the vermicelli, 
simmer for ten to fifteen minutes and serve. 

Macaroni Soup. 

The macaroni must be boiled in water for ten min- 
utes, strained and put into boiling stock, in the propor- 
tion of half a pound to the gallon; simmer slowly for 
half an hour, and serve very hot, with grated cheese on a 
separate dish. 

Green Pea Soup. 

Have ready in your pan a gallon to a gallon and a 
half of cold water, two sliced onions, and a little green 
mint; salt and pepper to taste; add one quart of old green 
peas, and simmer till they are quite tender; then press 
through a fine hair sieve, with a wooden spoon. Mean- 
while stew in fresh butter a couple of young cos-lettuces, 
cut very small, and boil separately a quart of young green 
peas; when both peas and lettuces are tender, put the 
whole into the soup, and simmer gently until the young 
green peas are tender, then serve. This soup is better ij 
made with stock, and many persons prefer to boil the sound 
pea-shells in the soup, but if so they must be taken out 
before rubbing through the sieve. 

Pea Soup. 

Soak a quart of split peas in soft water for twelve or 
fourteen hours, and remove those which float on the top. 



144 D0MES2VC COOKERY. 

Then simmer in two quarts of water until tender; put 
them in your stewpan; add two quarts of beef stock, 
about a couple of pounds of shin of beef, any odd meat 
bones, chopped up, and a slice of fat ham; a head of 
celery, six onions, three each of carrots and turnips, — all 
peeled and sliced, — and seasoning to taste. Simmer the 
whole for two to three hours, stirrinor and skimminsf 
from time to time; pass all through a line hair sieve, give 
it one boil, and serve with toasted bread. The liquor in 
which a joint of meat, such as salt beef, salt pork, leg of 
mutton, has been boiled, or even plain water will do for 
pea-soup, but stock is best and most nutritious. 



Another Mode 

is to put a pint of split-peas into a gallon of water, with 
two ounces of butter, three pounds of shin of beef, one 
pound of crushed bones, and a knuckle of ham, or half 
a pound of good bacon; add two or three peeled and 
sliced carrots, as many turnips, a head of celery, four 
onions, salt and pepper; simmer gently for three hours; 
then crush the pulp from the peas through a sieve and 
return it to the soup; boil for another hour; then pass 
the soup through a fine sieve and serve. The meat may 
be made a separate dish. When green peas are in sea- 
son, a pint may be added at the second boiling. 

Cock-a-Leekie. 

Use five quarts of good beef stock, made as directed. 
Wash well two or three bunches of fine winter leeks (if 
old, scald for five minutes in boiling water), cut off the 
roots and part of the head, split into halves lengthways, 
and cut into lengths of about an inch. Put into the 
stock, with the leeks added, a fowl trussed as for boiling 
(an old cock is usually procured for this purpose, but a 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 145 

young boiling fowl is best, as it cooks more easily); 
simmer very gently for three or four hours, skimming 
constantly ; add pepper and salt to taste. When it is 
ready to serve cut up the fowl into neat Joints (their 
size must depend upon the number of diners), put them 
into your tureen, pour the soup, which should be very 
thick of leeks, over it, and serve very hot. Some cooks 
put a few French plums, whole, into the soup half an 
hour before serving. 



GRAVIES. 



The stocks already given for soups may be made the 
groundwork or basis of almost any but very rich gravies. 

Gravies should have no fat : to prevent the disagree- 
able appearance of fat floating about on the surface of 
your gravy, pass it through a tammy, or napkin that has 
been dipped in cold water ; the fat will adhere to this 
and the clear gravy will run through. If any grease re- 
main after this process, touch each spot with filtering 
paper, which will readily remove it. 

The number of standard receipts for gravies is enor- 
mous, but those following are good, simple, easy to 
make, and economical. 

Brown Gravy. 

Put into a three-quart stewpan (previously rubbed 
with butter) six onions, peeled and sliced ; cut into thin 
slices three and a half pounds of shin of beef, and crush 
the bone ; lay this on the onions, add a small turnip and 
two young carrots (sliced), a little whole pepper, and two 
or three cloves. This must remain over a moderate fire 
for eight or ten minutes, moving the contents now and 
7 



146 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

then. After that put it at the corner of the fire, so that 
in about an hour to an hour and a quarter, the bottom 
of the pan is all over a thick, high-colored jelly-like 
substance. Then add three quarts of cold water flavored 
with half a tablespoonful of salt, and let it all gradually 
come to the boil ; it must be removed to the corner of 
the fire as before, and simmered gently for an hour — 
carefully skimming — and after that time your gravy — 
strained through a fine hair sieve — is ready for use. 
This gravy is suitable for all kinds of roast game, 
poultry, or meat, and will keep perfectly good for several 
days, by just giving it a boil up every now and then. It 
may be made as above with veal or mutton, but shin of 
beef is the best and cheapest. 

Another Brown Gravy. 

Prepare the stewpan with butter as before, and put 
into it three onions (previously sliced and fried to a 
light color); prepare and put in your beef as directed in 
last receipt, add half a glass of cold water, a little whole 
pepper and two or three cloves ; boil for ten or fifteen 
minutes, shaking the pan from time to time to prevent 
the contents burning. Then add three quarts of cold 
water as before, and when it boils up simmer gently for 
about an hour and a half ; strain, and let it go cold, 
when carefully remove all the fat, and it is ready for use. 

Thickening for Brown Gravy 

is made thus: — Put a quarter of a pound of fresh butter 
into a stewpan, and let it melt gradually ; add about 
two-thirds that weight of flour, and keep it well stirred 
till it browns, but do not let it burn. When quite cold 
put it to the above gravy, (the quantities are here pro- 
portioned, so that if only one quart of gravy is made, 



DOMESTIC COOKERY, 147 

use only about one ounce of butter for thickening), give 
it one boil, skim, strain, and serve. 



Savory Gravy. 

Put into a quart stevvpan two large slices of ham, 
and two pounds of shin of beef, sliced ; a carrot, a large 
onion with four cloves stuck in it, a head of celery, a 
small bundle of parsley, lemon thyme, and savory, a 
few leaves of sweet basil, a bay leaf, and a shallot, a 
piece of lemon peel, and twelve berries of allspice; pour 
over half pint of water, cover close, and simmer gently 
for half an hour, when it will be nearly dry ; watch 
carefully, and see that it gets well browned all over ; 
then add three pints of boiling water, and simmer two 
hours ; strain ; and when cold, clear away the fat. 

Veal Gravy. 

Slice a pound and a half of lean veal, and put it into 
your stevvpan, with a few slices of undressed gammon of 
bacon, and two large onions sliced ; set on a slow fire, 
and shake occasionally until the meat is well browned ; 
then fill the pan up with brown gravy (made as direct- 
ed), let it just boil up, and then simmer for about an 
hour to an hour and a half, skimming off all fat; strain, 
and use. 

Venison Gravy. 

Use the trimmings of the joint itself, and proceed as 
for brown gravy. 

Liver Gravy. 

Put the neck, liver, gizzard, and heart of a turkey or 
fowl into rather more than half a pint of cold water, with 
half a slice of toast, and a little lemon thyme, and sav- 



148 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

vory. When the liver is quite tender, take it out and 
pound it in a mortar; let the rest stew till reduced to 
about one-half. Strain off, put in a spoonful of mush- 
room catsup, and the pounded liver; well mix, strain, 
add a bit of butter rolled in flour, and simmer for ten 
minutes. If too thick, add a little boiling water, and 
simmer a few minutes. 



White Gravy. 

This gravy is the stock of several white sauces, and is 
made thus: — Put into a quart stewpan three pounds of 
lean veal, cut into dice, and half a pound of lean ham, 
cut smaller; add a glass of cold water, and put over the 
fire until the "white glaze," or jelly, forms on the bottom 
of the pan; then add three pints of cold water, a bunch 
of savory herbs, a sliced onion, and a blade of mace. 
Let it slowly come to the boil, then add a little salt, 
skim carefully, and simmer slowly for about three hours; 
strain, and when quite cold, remove all the fat. 

Fish G-ravy. 

Skin, clean, cut up, and soak three small eels; put 
them in a stewpan and cover them with cold water; add 
two or' three anchovies (or a little essence of anchovy); 
add some sweet herbs, whole pepper and mace, lemon- 
peel, and a shred of horse-radish. Stew gently till the 
fish is drawn down, and put in, when about half done, a 
crust of bread toasted to a high color. Strain off, thicken 
with a piece of butter and flour, and it is ready for use 
with almost any kind of fish. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 149 

MADE DISHES, ENTREES, &c. 

Lobster Salad. 

Boil two fresh eggs hard, take the yolks, and mix 
them in a tablespoonful of good cream; add two table- 
spoonfuls of salad oil. Now mix separately a teaspoon- 
ful each of fine salt, and made mustard, and a gill of 
malt vinegar. Add this mixture gradually to the eggs, 
cream and oil, and let them be thoroughly incorporated. 
Then break up a large lobster, mix the soft parts with 
the dressing and put it at the bottom of the dish; then 
cut up the meat of the claws and tail into small pieces, 
mix with chopped endive and lettuce, put it on the 
dressing, and serve. 

Another Way. 

Cut up some lettuces and endive, and put tiiem into 
your salad-bowl, with any small salad in season, and 
make a dressing thus: — Mix together, perfectly smooth 
and creamy, one tablespoonful of made mustard, two 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and four tablespoonfuls of 
salad oil, the yolks of two hard boiled eggs, a few drops 
of essence of anchovy, cayenne, and salt to taste. Mix 
this dressing with the soft parts and the pickings of the 
lobster, and pour over the lettuce, &c. Then take the 
solid meat of the fish, and cut it into moderate pieces, and 
put it into the salad. Garnish with sliced eggs (hard 
boiled) and a few slices of cucumber. 

Prussian Cutlet. 

Take about a pound of veal, with a little fat; chop it 
fine ; add half a teaspoonful of chopped shallot, a tea- 



1 5 o DOMES TIC COOKER Y. 

spoonful of salt, half a one of pepper and a little nutmeg; 
mix thoroughly; make it into two pieces; roll them in 
egg and bread crumbs, and saute in butter till nicely 
browned; serve very hot. Any other meat can be used 
equally as well as veal. 



Stewed Rump StealEis. 

Steaks for stewing should be cut rather thicker than 
for broiling. Melt a little butter in a stewpan, and brown 
the steak in it on both sides, shaking it now and then that 
it does not burn; then add a little flour, and when it is 
colored, cover the meat gradually with cold water. When 
it boils add a teaspoonful of salt, take off the scum as it 
rises, put in a few sliced onions, can^ots and turnips; and 
a bunch of savory herbs; simmer the whole gently for 
about three hours. If liked thick — which is best — stir 
into the gravy ten minutes before serving a tablespoon- 
ful of rice-flour or arrowroot, flavored with a dust of 
ca)''enne and a little catsup. 



Gibelotte of Rabbits. 

Mince half a pound of streaked bacon into joints 
and fry; put it into your stewpan with two young rab- 
bits, well washed and cut into joints, add a little flour; 
cover with cold water, salt and pepper to taste; let it 
slowly come to the. boil, when add a couple of dozen of 
button onions, and a few button mushrooms; simmer 
gently until the pieces of rabbit are quite tender, when 
take them out. Let the sauce boil, keeping it stirred, till 
the onions are very tender, add a little browning, pour 
over the rabbits — which have been kept hot in the oven 
or before the fire — and serve. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 151 

Beef Olives. 

Let your steaks be about six inches long, four or five 
broad, and not less than half an incli thick ; beat with a 
rolling-pin, and rub them over with yolk of o.^'g ; strew 
bread crumbs, chopped lemon-peel, minced parsley, 
chopped suet or marrow, grated nutmeg, and pepper and 
salt over Uiem. Roll them up tightly, and skewer ; fry 
lightly, then stew until quite tender in some good stock 
(which see); thicken with Hour, and add a little mush- 
room catsup, and lemon juice. If wanted richer, serve 
with pickled mushrooms, yolks of eggs (hard boiled), 
and fried forcemeat balls. 

Stewed Chops or Cutlets. 

Place six mutton chops or cutlets into a pan with a 
pint of cold water, and a little sugar and salt ; simmer 
very gently from an hour and a half to two hours, skim, 
put in a handful of pearl barley, sliced celery, leek, and 
turnip ; and serve the chops in the broth, unstrained. 

Broiled Fowl. 

Truss a fowl as for boiling, remove the back-bone, 
and press quite flat, season well with pepper, salt, and, if 
liked, with shallots ; put into your frying-pan, fry upon 
both sides, take out, ^^^ over, dip into bread crumbs, 
place on a gridiron, and broil a very light brown color. 
Serve with plain gravy and mushroom sauce. 

Oyster Sausages. 

Pound to a paste in a mortar — removing all skin, 
strips, &c. — half a pound of lean neck of mutton, and 
half a pound of good suet, season with pepper and salt; 
chop two dozen large oysters very fine, moisten the paste 



152 DOMESTIC COOKERY, 

with a gill of cream, and add the chopped oysters ; form 
into fancy rolls, and fry to a light brown. 

Fried Patties. 

Take half a pound of cold veal, and one pound of ham 
(or any less quantity in these proportions), and mince 
fine ; add an ^^%, boiled hard and chopped, and a season- 
ing of pounded mace, salt, pepper, and lemon-peel ; 
moisten with a little gravy and cream. Make a good 
puff-paste ; roll rather thin, and cut it into round or 
square pieces ; put the mince between two of them, pinch 
the edges to keep in the gravy, and fry to a light brown. 
Fry the patties about fifteen minutes. 

Patties 

made as above, may also be baked in patty-pans, in 
which case brush over with white of Q^^. Oysters may 
take the place of the ham, as above, and chicken by itself 
makes excellent patties. 

Fricassee of Chicken or Fowl. 

Carve the bird into eight pieces, i.e., the two legs, 
the two wings, and the remainder cut into four — 
wash, put into a stewpan and cover with water, season 
with salt, pepper, a bunch of parsley, four cloves, and 
a blade of mace, let simmer for twenty minutes, pass 
the stock through a sieve, take out the pieces of fowl, 
trim, then in another stewpan put two ounces of but- 
ter, a spoonful of flour, just moisten with the stock, 
put in the pieces of fowl ; stir occasionally until boil- 
ing, skim, add twenty button onions, let simmer until 
onions are tender, when add a gill of cream, mixed with 
the yolks of two eggs, stir in quickly over the fire, but 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 153 

do not let boil, take out the pieces, and serve with the 
sauce and onions over them. 



Rump-Steak Pie. 

Take two and a half pounds of good rump-steak, and 
beat it well with a rolling-pin; cut it into thin slices, 
and lay it in a dish bofdered-with paste. Season with 
salt and pepper, and cover the meat with water. Lay on 
the cover (made as per receipt, see " Paste "), join to the 
paste round the rim, trim off close, make a hole in the 
top; bake in a well-heated oven for nearly an hour and 
a half. You may season with minced onion or shallot. 

Another Way. 

Stew or broil the steak partially before putting it 
into the pie, and then the meat need not be cut thin. A 
sheep's kidney or two, or a dozen oysters (bearded) im- 
prove this dish. 

Beef Collops. 

Cut into two pieces two or three inches long, two 
pounds of any part of beef that is tender; beat flat with a 
rolling-pin, and dredge well with flour; fry in butter to 
a light brown; lay them in a stewpan, and cover with 
brown gravy {see receipt) ; put in half a shallot, 
minced, a lump of butter rolled in flour, pepper and 
salt; simmer gently till tender ; serve with pickles, or 
squeeze in half a lemon, according to taste ; serve in a 
tureen, very hot. 

Minced Collops. 

Mince four pounds of fresh round of beef very fine, 
and add to it four large onions, chopped small; pepper 

7* 



154 DOMESTIC COOKER Y. 

and salt. Put into a stewpan with a little water; dredge 
in enough flour to just cover the meat; then take a col- 
lop mincer (which is a piece of wood about twelve 
inches deep, and four across, with the end sharpened), 
and beat for a few minutes; then cover and slowly stew 
for half an hour. Toast some bread, cut in diamonds; 
put the coUops on a large dish, and dress with the toast. 
A few poached eggs should be laid on top; mushroom 
catsup may be added. 



Peas and Butter. 

Put a quart of young green peas into a stewpan with 
half a pound of fresh butter; add the heart of a large 
lettuce, a bunch of parsley, a few small onions, and salt; 
stew together slowly till done; thicken before serving 
with a little butter and flour, and the yolks of two eggs; 
add a little white sugar in powder, and serve. 



Anchovy Toast. 

Wash, bone, and skin six or eight anchovies and 
pound them in a mortar with an ounce of fresh butter, 
and a few grains of cayenne and nutmeg; when this is 
an even smooth paste, rub it through a very fine hair 
sieve, and spread on toasted bread or rusks. If pre- 
ferred, the bread may be fried in butter instead of 
toasted. 

The above ''anchovy paste," or "anchovy butter," 
may be made in a quantity, and kept good for a long 
time, by putting it in little pots, and, when cold, cover- 
ing with a piece of tissue paper, and pouring over it a 
little clarified butter. Tie over with a bladder or oiled 
paper, to make it air-tight. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 155 

Poached Eggs and Bacon. 

The bacon should be streaked, well-trimmed, with- 
out rind, and thin; lay the slices in your pan, put it on 
the fire, turn the bacon pretty frequently, and when 
done, put on a dish before the fire. Poach the eggs, and 
serve on the bacon without breaking the yolks. 

Fried Eggs and Bacon. 

Proceed with the bacon as above; fry each &^^ sepa- 
rately in a little bacon fat; the eggs should be broken in 
a cup, and the yolks preserved whole; turn them care- 
fully into the pan and they will soon cook; the yolks 
must not harden. As each ^^^ is done, lay it on the 
bacon in front of the fire. Serve very hot. 

Broiled Beef Bones. 

Procure some sweet rib or sirloin bones with a little 
meat all over them; season well with salt, cayenne and 
black pepper; broil to a good brown, and serve on a nap- 
kin, very hot. 

Bullock's Kidney. 

Cut the kidney into thin slices, and lay them in cold 
water for an hour or two, changing the water twice. Dry, 
sprinkle with minced parsley and savory herbs, and fry 
to a nice brown; when done, sprinkle in a little flour, 
and add a gill of sherry and the same quantity of good 
brown gravy {see receipt); let it just simmer for a minute 
{not boil); serve very hot, garnished with sliced lemon. 

A-la-mode Beef. 
Take six pounds of the thick flank of beef, and beat it 



156 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

well; lard it with bacon {see Larding), and put into a stew- 
pan with some rind of bacon (well soaked), two onions, 
two carrots, some savory herbs, four cloves, pepper and 
salt; add a glass of water, and let it stew over a very slow 
fire, closely covered, for five to eight hours (shaking it 
from time to time to prevent burning), or until quite ten- 
der. A glass of white wine and a small quantity of brown 
gravy may be added to the liquor it was stewed in, which, 
before serving, must be strained. Vinegar (ateacupful), 
allspice (a dozen berries), parsley, celery, and a few car- 
rots and turnips may be added where liked. This should, 
where possible, be cooked over a hot-plate, and not on an 
open fire, as it is essential that the stewing is very slow. 

Stewed Ox Palates. 

Let four palates remain in a basin with warm water 
for half an hour; then wash them; simmer in a stewpan 
with water, until they can be easily skinned. Then take 
them out, skim them, and cut into square pieces; put 
them into a stewpan, with one pint of brown gravy {see 
receipt), a spoonful of white wine, as much catsup and 
browning, an onion stuck vvitli cloves, and a slice of 
lemon. Stew for half an hour (or until tender), take out 
the onion and lemon, thicken the sauce (as previously 
directed), serve with forcemeat balls, and garnish with 
sliced lemon. There are many ways of serving ox pal- 
ates, but this is the best and simplest. 

Broiled Rump-steak. 

Rump-steaks should be cut from a rump that has 
hung some days, and be about three-quarters of an inch 
thick ; if at all fresh beat them with a rolling pin. The 
fire must be clear (sprinkle a little salt on it just before 
you are going to cook), and the gridiron clean, hot, and 
placed in a slanting position, to prevent the fat from 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 157 

making a smoke. Season the steaks with pepper and 
salt ; and when brown on one side turn them. When 
half done, take up, and lay tliem in a hot dish before the 
fire, with a slice of butter, and a little pepper and salt 
between every two steaks. While they are in this state, 
shred a shallot very fine, and put to it some good gravy, 
with a little catsup. Having drained the steaks of the 
gravy, replace them on the gridiron, and keep turning till 
done. Put them on a dish, with the gravy and shallot ; 
garnish with horse-radish, and serve very hot. The shal- 
lot and catsup may be omitted if not liked. In turning 
steaks, you should use a pair of tongs, and not a fork. 

Fried Rump Steak. 

Fry them brown in fresh butter, and serve very hot 
with walnut catsup. Oyster, mushroom, tomato, or 
onion sauce usually accompany rump steaks. 

Rump Steak and Fried Potatoes. 

Have rather thin steaks — say half an inch — broil them 
well, turning them frequently, and serve with sliced 
potatoes round the dish — fried brown and crisp in boil- 
ing butter. Sometimes the butter the potatoes were fried 
in, flavored with a pinch of powdered herbs, is poured 
under the steak. 

Rump Steak and Kidney Pudding. 

Cut two pounds of tender rump-steak into pieces 
about an inch or two square, add two or three sheep's 
kidneys, sliced ; line your pudding basin with a good 
thick suet crust {see receipt), leaving it lapping a little 
over the edge of the basin ; then put in the steak and 
kidney in layers — a couple of dozen oysters, blanched 
and bearded, makes an excellent addition : season eagh 



158 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

lav^er with salt and black pepper. When full put in 
half a pint of water, and cover the top with more crust, 
moisten the edges and join the two crusts firmly, then 
turn up the crust which was lapping, and join firmly. 
Dip your pudding cloth in hot water, wring it out, flour 
it well, and tie up pudding, basin, and all ; put it into a 
large saucepan or copper of boiling water — adding hot 
water from time to time so that the pudding is always 
covered; let it boil continually for at least four hours. 
It must not stop boiling for a minute. When done take off 
the cloth, cut a little hole in the top of the pudding, and 
serve in the basin, on a dish, very hot. Bullock's kidney 
will do if sheep's cannot be procured. A few mush- 
rooms add to the flavor. 

Kidney Pudding. 

Slice the kidneys thin, and proceed as directed for 
rump steak pudding. A few mushrooms or oysters 
greatly enrich this dish. If veal kidneys are used a few 
slices of ham must be added. 

Mutton, Veal and Pork Puddings 

are made on the same principle : — For mutton use loin 
chops ; for lamb, the neck, veal, the leg (the veal is better 
if fried a little first with a few slices of bacon — and then 
put in the pudding with the bacon and butter it was fried 
in ; pork, the leg (season highly with pepper, salt, and 
dried sage, and add a little pork sausage meat). These 
puddings will take from one and a half to two and a half 
hours boiling continually. Serve in the basin. 

Boiled Tongue. 

Soak in cold water for three hours, if just out of the 
pickle ; but, if dried, soak for ten or twelve hours. Put 
in a stewpan of cold water, with a fagot of savory herbs; 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 159 

when it boils up, skim, and simmer gently until quite 
tender ; peel and serve very hot, garnished with parsley. 
This is a proper accompaniment to poultry. 

Toad-in-the-Hole. 

Make a batter of four eggs, about one to one and a 
quarter pints of good milk, and four heaped tablespoon- 
fuls of flour ; salt to taste — the flour should be first mix- 
ed smooth with a little of the milk and then the beaten 
eggs and the other things put tc it ; stir well. Cut into 
about six pieces each two sheep's kidneys, and put them 
in a pie-dish with two pounds of rather fat rump steak, 
cut into twelve or fourteen pieces. Pour the batter over, 
and bake for nearly two hours in a hot oven. 

Boiled Calf s Feet. 

Take two white calf's feet, and soak them in warm 
water for an hour and a half ; bone to the first joint, and 
stew in enough water to cover it for about three hours, 
with a little fat bacon — sliced, a bunch of savory herbs, a 
sliced onion, two or three cloves, a blade of mace, whole 
pepper, a wine-glassful of lemon juice, and salt to taste. 
Serve smothered in parsley and butter {see receipt). The 
liquor, strained, may be mixed with some veal gravy and 
served in a tureen. 

Calf s Liver and Bacon. 

Cut the liver in slices about a quarter of an inch in 
thickness; take as many slices of bacon as there are of 
liver, fry the bacon, and put it in a dish before the fire ; 
then fry the liver in the bacon fat, to a good brown ; 
when done, take them out and put into the pan some 
chopped parsley and shallots, and fry brown; add a little 
flour, and a gill of white wine, with a dash of vinegar ; 



i6o DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

let all these boil together for a minute or two ; pour 
over the liver and serve. 

Curried Chicken. 

Cut up into joints and take off the skin, roll each 
piece in flour, mixed with a tablespoonful of curry- 
powder. Slice two or three onions, and fry them in 
butter of a light brown. Then add the meat, and fry all 
together, till it begins to brown, put the whole into a 
stewpan, and just cover with boiling water. Simmer 
gently two or three hours, and serve with boiled rice. 

Cod-Fish Pie. 

Put two or three good slices of cod into salt and cold 
water, and let it remain for three or four hours. Put 
the fish into a pie-dish, season with nutmeg, mace, pep- 
per, and salt ; add a bit of butter and half a pint, or a 
little more, of good stock ; cover with a good crust, and 
bake in brisk oven for about one and a quarter to one 
and a half hours. When done put in a sauce (make a 
little hole in the top and pour in through a funnel) made 
thus: — Mix together a gill of cream, a gill of stock, a 
lump of butter rolled in flour, a bit of lemon peel — 
minced, and a dozen oysters ; put this in a stewpan, let 
it just boil up, and add to the pie. 

Veal CoUops. 

Take a couple of pounds of veal, and cut it into thin 
pieces about three inches long ; dredge them with flour ; 
fry in butter for a few minutes. Put them into your 
slewpan in a pint of good gravy {see receipt), with a bit 
of butter rolled in flour, a pickled walnut, a few capers, 
salt and pepper ; simmer the whole for about ten 
minutes, and serve. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. i6i 

Pork Cutlets. 

Bone and trim half a dozen lean pork chops, and 
broil them for about fifteen or twenty minutes, until 
well done, over a brisk clear fire. Serve with tomafo 
sauce, or pickled gherkins. 

Veal Cutlets. 

Cut into good thick cutlets — say nearly an inch — two 
or three pounds of loin, neck, or leg of veal. Roll them 
in bread crumbs, mixed with a few powdered savory 
herbs, pepper and salt; and fry them in butter, to a light 
brown; when thoroughly done, put them in a dish in front 
of the fire, and make the following sauce: — Put into the 
pan a little flour and butter, add a teacupful of boiling 
water, salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon; boil up, 
pour over, and serve. 

Mutton Cutlets. 

Cut from the neck, loin, or leg, about half a dozen 
good slices; broil them till nicely broAvn, and serve with 
mashed potatoes in the same dish, or with sauce piquante. 

Eagout of Duck. 

Prepare a duck as for roasting; roast until well 
browned. Meanwhile, put into a stewpan two or three 
large onions (sliced and fried), a few leaves of sage and 
lemon thyme, pepper and salt. Put in the duck; cover 
the whole with good gravy {see receipt), and simmer till the 
duck is quite tender (say twenty to twenty-five minutes); 
skim and strain the gravy, add a little thickening of but- 
ter and flour, let it boil up, pour it over the duck, and 
serve. Green peas, boiled plain, and put into the gravy, 



i62 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

after straining, and allowed to just boil up, may be served 
with this. 

Veal and Ham Pie. 

Cut up into thin slices a neck of veal, and take away 
the bones; cut into small pieces a few slices of cooked 
ham; put it in a pie dish, in alternate layers, and season 
highly. Add a little water, cover with good paste crust, 
bake well in a sharp oven, and when done pour in a 
little good veal gray, highly seasoned. Sliced sweet- 
breads, bearded oysters, forcemeat balls, a sliced veal kid- 
ney, sliced eggs, hard-boiled, or a little lean pork — cut 
into squares — may be added with great advantage. 

Rabbit Pie. 

Cut a young rabbit into moderate-sized joints, re- 
move the principal bones, and split the head; lay all in 
warm water for about thirty minutes; then dry them, 
season with white pepper, salt, pounded mace and nut- 
meg to taste (parsley and bay leaves may be added when 
liked); put in the joints of rabbit with a little ham or 
fat bacon, cut into squares, a few forcemeat balls, and a 
couple of hard boiled eggs, sliced lengthways. Add 
about a tumbler of cold water; line the dish, and cover 
with a good crust; bake in a hot oven for about an hour 
and a quarter to an hour and a half; when cut add — 
very hot — a little richly-seasoned gravy, which can be 
made by stewing the bones of the rabbit in stock, with 

' an onion, a bunch of savory herbs, and a little allspice; 
strain before putting it in. The liver can either be 

^ mixed in the forcemeat or cut up and put in the pie. 

Giblet Pie. 
Scald and clean two sets of goose or duck giblets, cut 



■DOMESTIC COOKERY. 163 

into pieces, and wash them; put them into your stewpan 
with two or three small onions, a bunch of savory herbs, 
salt and whole pepper; simmer gently in a little water 
for an hour; then put them into a pie dish with season- 
ing, and the liquor in which they have been stewed 
(strained); when cold, line the edges of the dish, and 
cover it with puff paste; before serving, open the crust, 
and pour in a little rich white gravy, mixed with a glass 
of French white wine, seasoned, and made quite hot: it 
will require an hour to an hour and a half to bake. A 
good rump-steak, cut in three or four pieces, and put in 
the bottom of the pie-dish, is an improvement. 

Stewed Giblets. 

Clean, and parboil them; take off the outer skin of 
the feet; cut them up in small pieces and stew gently till 
quite tender, in good stock {see receipt), with some sweet 
herbs, an onion, cloves, whole pepper, and a little cat- 
sup; when done, strain the sauce, and thicken it with a 
little fiour and butter; then pour it hot over the giblets. 
Just before serving add a squeeze of lemon. 

Jugged Hare. 

Clean and cut up your hare into small joints ; put 
them in lukewarm water and a little vinegar, and let them 
remain for half an hour. Dry and dredge the pieces 
with flour; fry in boiling butter. Then put into a large 
earthenware jar or jug about a pint of good beef gravy 
{see receipt), a large onion or two (stuck with a few 
cloves), a sliced lemon (peeled), a high seasoning of 
cayenne, salt and whole pepper, and the pieces of fried 
hare. Cover the jar closely, and set it in a saucepan of 
boiling water up to the neck. Let it boil continuously 
until the hare is quitetender (say three and a half to four 
hours). When nearly done, put in three or four glasses 



1 64 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

of port wine, and a few forcemeat balls {see receipt), 
which have been previously fried. Arrange the pieces 
on your dish, and strain gravy through a cloth previously 
wrung out in cold water (this removes the grease); give 
it another boil up, pour over the hare, and serve — with 
red currant jelly. 

Another Way. 

Soak and cut up the hare as before ; then drain and 
put into a stewpan with a pint and a half of good stock 
{see receipt), pepper, salt, two or three cloves, a shallot, 
and two or three green onions shred fine, a bunch of 
savory herbs, and two or three bay leaves ; stew for 
about an hour on a slow fire ; then put it into a deep 
dish that will stand heat ; strain the liquor from the stew- 
pan on it, adding a little more stock, cayenne, a squeeze 
of lemon, and a pint of port wine. Let it bake in a slow 
oven until tender — say two hours — covering the dish 
with a coarse paste of flour and water ; when done, re- 
move the paste, put into a hot dish, strain the gravy as 
before, thicken it a little with butter and flour, give it 
one boil ; pour it over the pieces of hare, and serve very 
hot, with red currant jelly. 

Hare Pie. 

Soak, wash and cut up the hare as for jugging ; sea- 
son highly with a few cloves pounded, and some whole 
black and cayenne pepper ; then lay the pieces in a pie 
dish, with a few small slices of ham, about a pint of good 
brown stock {see receipt), and a tumblerful of port wine; 
cover the dish with puff paste. If to be eaten hot, a suet 
crust is very good ; but if to be eaten cold, raise the 
crust while hot and fill up the dish with rich, highly sea- 
soned beef gravy, which when cold will become a firm 
jelly. 



DOMESTIC COOKER Y. 165 

Partridge Pie. 

Take about half a pound of veal cutlets and put in 
bottom of your pie dish ; on the veal lay a large thin 
slice of fat ham. Split a brace of partridges in halves 
(after being plucked, drawn, and cleaned, and the legs 
cut off at the first joint) ; season with whole pepper, salt, 
and a little chopped parsley ; add a few mushrooms, and 
put a bit of butter in each half bird. Put the partridges 
on to the ham and cover with half to three quarters of a 
pint of good stock ; put a border of paste round the 
dish ; cover with puff paste, brush over with yolk of 
egg, and bake in a brisk oven for nearly an hour. If to 
be eaten cold, lift the crust while hot, and fill up the pie 
with good, highly-seasoned beef gravy. 

Pigeon Compote. 

Truss as for boiling six pigeons ; grate the crumb of 
a stale penny loaf ; scrape a pound of fat bacon ; chop 
some thyme, parsley, and onion, and some lemon-peel 
fine ; grate nutmeg, and season with pepper and salt. 
Mix with two eggs. Put this forcemeat into the craws 
of the pigeons, lard the breasts ; fry brown ; stew in beef 
stock three quarters of an hour ; thicken with butter and 
flour, serve with forcemeat balls round the dish, and 
strain the gravy over. 

Grouse Pie. 

Pick and clean your grouse, and if large cut them 
into joints, but if small, put them in whole ; season with 
cayenne, salt, whole pepper, and two or three bruised 
cloves ; put a bit of butter into each bird, and lay them 
closely into a pie dish, with a glass of good beef stock, 
and another of port wine ; cover the dish with puff 
paste, and bake it an hour to an hour and a quarter. If 



1 66 DOMESTIC COOKERY, 

intended to be eaten cold, have ready a little rich gravy, 
and pour into the dish while hot. 

Pigeon Pie. 

Pick and clean a couple of birds, and rub them inside 
and out with pepper and salt, and put a bit of butter 
inside each. Cut about a pound of rump-steak into 
several pieces and lay them in a pie dish ; put on them 
the pigeons, a few slices of fat ham, and the yolks of 
two or three hard-boiled eggs. Three parts fill the dish 
with good stock (^-^^ receipt); season with pepper and 
salt ; put a border of paste round the edge, and put on 
your puff-paste crust. Glaze the crust with yolk of q^^ 
and bake in a hot oven for about an hour or a little 
longer. Two of the feet should be cut off and put 
through the top. 

Salt Buck. 

Rub a quarter of a pound of salt well into a duck; 
turn the duck daily on a dish for three days. Then wash 
clean, put it into a stewpan, with a half pint of water to 
the pound; let it simmer for two hours. Serve with 
white onion sauce. 

Sweetbread Pie. 

Cut your sweetbreads into thick slices, and stew for 
about a quarter of an hour in white stock [see receipt), 
with a few herbs, chopped shallot, and mushrooms, salt, 
pepper, and a piece of butter; then strain the gravy, put 
into a pie-dish with the sweetbreads, some ox palates, 
(previously boiled very tender), or the remains of a 
roasted fowl, and a little ham, some green peas, or as- 
paragus tops, the yolks of some hard-boiled eggs, and 
forcemeat balls; over the whole put thin slices of fat 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 167 

bacon. Cover with a puff-paste crust, and bake for 
about an hour and a half to two hours in a moderate 
oven. If when cut it looks dry add a little good veal 
gravy, hot. 

Roast Sweetbreads. 

Scald in milk and water, and when half done, take 
out and wipe dry; rub over with yolk of egg, and roll in 
fine bread crumbs. Roast to a good brown in a Dutch 
oven, and serve with fried bread crumbs. 

Stewed Sweetbreads. 

Stuff with good forcemeat three large sweetbreads 
(previously soaked in warm water for an hour), skewer 
them up; then put a few slices of bacon at the bottom of 
a stewpan, season with pepper, salt, mace, cloves, sweet 
herbs, and a large onion sliced. Lay upon these 
slices of veal cut thin, and the sweetbreads over them. 
Cover all up close for ten minutes; then pour in a quart 
of boiling water, and simmer gently two hours. Take 
out the sweetbreads, strain off the gravy, skim, and boil 
it till reduced to half a pint. Return the sweetbreads to 
the pan, and boil two or three minutes; dish, with the 
gravy over. Garnish with lemon, and serve very hot. 

Baked Sweetbreads. 

Soak them for an hour in warm water; put into boil- 
ing water and simmer for ten minutes; drain them; brush 
over with yolk of q^^ and roll in fine bread crumbs; 
bake for forty minutes in a moderate oven. Serve on 
toast, with brown gravy in a tureen. 

Haricot Mutton. 
Cut a loin of mutton into chops; or, if breast, into 



1 68 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

square pieces — fry them brown in clarified dripping; put 
them into a stewpan with a few onions (sliced and fried 
in butter), carrots and turnips cut in thin slices, two or 
three cloves, pepper, and allspice; this sliould be put to 
simmer very slowly for about and hour and a half to two 
hours and a half in a little water; serve with mushroom 
catsup. A bunch of savory herbs may be stewed in this, 
and taken out before serving. 

Braised Fillet of Mutton. 

Take the fillet of a tender leg of mutton, cover it with 
buttered paper, and roast for two hours. Boil some 
French beans, which drain; take the paper off the meat, 
and glaze it; let the beans heat in a pint of good gravy; 
put them in the dish, and serve the meat on them. 

Tripe. 

Have it dressed nicely, and then boil it in milk atid 
water until quite tender — say one hour, for dressed tripe; 
if undressed more than twice that time. Dish very hot, 
smother in onion sauce {see receipt) and serve. You may 
also dress it in any of the following ways — always first 
boiling it till tender, and removing some of the coarser 
fat. — Cut into squares, dip in butter, roll in bread crumbs, 
and fiy to a light brown. Or, stew in beef gravy with 
mushrooms. Or, cut into collops, sprinkle with chopped 
onions and minced herbs, and fry in butter. Or, stew in 
gravy with a little curry powder, flour and cream, 

Scotch Haggis. 

Thoroughly clean a sheep's pluck; make various cuts 
in the heart and liver to let the blood out; put into a 
saucepan, with the wind-pipe hanging over the side; 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 169 

change the water after ten minutes; let it boil twenty 
minutes more; then take all out but half the liver, which 
must boil until it will grate easily. Now take the other 
half of the liver, the lights and the heart, and trim away 
all the skin and black portions; then mince finely. Mince 
a pound of sweet beef suet, discarding the stringy parts; 
cut half a dozen onions up small; grate the half liver that 
was left in the pot; and then mix together the minced 
heart, &c., the suet, onions, and grated liver. Scald and 
peel a dozen little onions and add them to this. Then 
take some finely ground oatmeal which has been slowly 
toasting in front of the fire or in the oven for an hour or 
cwo, and is slightly brown; put the mince on a board, 
season highly with pepper, salt, and cayenne; sprinkle 
the meal over this, and bind it all with half a pint of 
good beef stock, a little milk, and the yolks of two eggs. 
Thoroughly clean a good strong sheep's paunch, and put 
m the whole of the mixture, adding a tablespoonful of 
lemon juice, — being careful to allow room for the meat 
to swell, — and press out the air. Sew up firmly, and en- 
close the paunch in a short canvas bag, which also sew 
up tightly. Put on in cold water and let it gradually 
come to the boil: as the bag swells up first prick it in 
two or three places with a large needle. Simmer slowly 
for about three hours; turn it out, and serve very hot. 
For the lights, sheep's kidneys or tongues may be sub- 
stituted. 

Dried Haddocks. 

The best way to cook these fish is to put them in a 
large basin with some savory herbs and a bay leaf, and 
cover them with boiling water ; put something over the 
top of the basin to keep the steam in ; keep the fish in 
the water for ten minutes to a quarter of an hour, then 
take them out, drain, rub overwith a little butter, pepper 
well, and serve very hot. If the haddocks are large, cut 
them into four pieces. 



I70 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Lobster Cutlets. 

Take two lobsters, or one large one ; take all the meat 
out of the shell, and pound it to a smooth paste, in a 
mortar with a bit of butter, and grated nutmeg, pounded 
mace, cayenne, salt, and pepper to taste. Divide the 
paste into equal pieces, and make them into thin shapes 
like cutlets, cover with t^^ and bread crumbs, and fry- 
in boiling lard to a good color ; drain and serve hot. 

Lobsters and Grabs, 

when served plain should be dressed thus : — Cut the body 
from the tail and cut both in halves lengthways, break 
off the two large claws and crack them in two or three 
places without breaking the meat, arrange the pieces as 
nearly as possible as if the fish were entire, and serve 
with a garnish of sprigs of parsley. 

Fricasseed Soles. 

Take two medium-sized soles and fry plain in butter, 
as directed, with a small sole. When done take the meat 
from the small one, mince it ; and mix with a little 
chopped lemon-peel, chopped parsley, grated bread, nut- 
meg, salt, and pepper, bind it with the yolk of an e^^^ 
and a little butter, shape this into balls, as for force- 
meat, and fry in butter. Thicken the gravy with a little 
flour, put in a glass of port wine, a little lemon juice and 
cayenne ; put the two soles into the stewpan, give them 
one boil up, and serve very hot, on a hot dish garnished 
with sliced lemon. 

Eel Pie. 

Prepare the eels as for stewing ; put in your pie-dish 
a little forcemeat ; add the eels — except the heads and 
tails, season with nutmeg, pepper, salt, and a little chop- 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 171 

ped parsley ; put in a glass of veal gravy {see receipt), 
cover it with puff paste, rubbed over with yolk of Q%^, 
ornament the pie with some of the paste ; bake it about 
an hour, and when done, pour in a sauce made as fol- 
lows : — The trimmings boiled in half a pint of veal 
gravy, seasoned with pepper and salt, a tablespoonful of 
lemon juice, and thickened with flour and butter ; strain 
it through a fine sieve, and when boiling put into the pie. 

Boiled Eggs. 

Put them into boiling water, and boil for three 
minutes if liked lightly boiled ; but usually three and 
three-quarters to four minutes, when the white will be 
well set. If wanted hard — say six minutes ; if for salads, 
ten minutes. Care must be taked to put the eggs ver) 
gently into the water, the best plan being to put them 
in with a spoon, and lay them on the bottom of the 
saucepan. For new-laid or extra-large eggs, a little 
longer time is required. 

Poached Eggs. 

Boil some water in a stewpan, or deep frying-pan ; 
break each o,^^ separately into a cup, and when the 
water boils, take off the pan, and gently slip tlie ^^^ 
into it without breaking the yolk; let it stay till the 
white is set, then put it over a moderate fire, and as soon 
as the water boils again, the o.^^ is done (say two and a 
half to three and a half minutes). Take it up with a slice, 
round off the edges of the white, send up the o.^^ on a 
toast, or on ham or bacon well fried, or slices of broiled 
beef or mutton. The bread should be somewhrit larger 
than the ^^'g, about a quarter of an inch in thickness, 
and barely toasted of a yellow brown. The best eggs 
for poaching are such as have been laid two days, ior 
new ones are too milky, and old ones too strong. A 



172 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

poached ^^^, to look well, should exhibit the yolk 
(which must never be hard) through the white. Never 
poach more than three eggs together; serve two to each 
person. 

Fried Eggs. 

Cover the bottom of the pan with fresh butter, and 
when melted break in the eggs as for poaching; when 
the whites are set, take the eggs up with a slice, and 
serve upon fried or toasted bread, or upon fried ham or 
bacon, 

Poached Eggs and Ham Sauce. 

The eggs are to be poached as before directed. 
Mince fine — with a gherkin, an onion, some parsley, 
pepper, and salt — three slices of boiled ham; simmer for 
about fifteen minutes in enough gravy to cover it. 
When this sauce boils dish the eggs, squeeze over a 
little lemon juice, and serve with the sauce over them. 

Scotch Eggs. 

Boil your eggs hard, remove the shells, and cover 
them thickly with a forcemeat made as follows : — Take 
some veal or sheep's kidney, with a slice of ham, a 
cleaned anchovy, a bit of butter, shallot, cayenne, and a 
green onion, all finely minced together, and mixed to a 
proper consistency with the yolks of eggs. Dredge with 
flour, and fry the eggs in boiling lard, or clarified drip- 
ping ; serve up with rich gravy. 

Curried Eggs. 

Mix into a paste with a little gravy a small table- 
spoonful of curry powder ; then add about a pint or a 
pint and a half more gravy ; mix it all smooth, and let 
it simmer slowly for about four hours, when it should be 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 173 

reduced to about half a pint. Boil half a dozen eggs 
hard, slice them lengthways, put them into the gravy 
(previously thickened with a little butter and flour) and 
when very hot serve. 

Eggs 

are cooked in a variety of other ways — stuffed, stewed 
in gravy, cooked on a hot-plate, and browned with a 
salamander, boiled hard and served with various vege- 
tables, broken and put in front of the fire, in a dish with 
a little milk, covered with grated cheese, and browned 
with a salamander ; beaten up in milk and flour, cooked 
slowly and browned, &c., &c. 

Plain Omelette. 

Break, separately, eight eggs, season with a teaspoon- 
ful of fine salt, and a dust of pepper, and beat them till 
exceedingly light, with a little milk or water : the more 
you beat them the lighter will be the omelette. Melt 
about a quarter of a pound of fresh butter in a frying- 
pan or omelette-pan. Beat the batter for another minute, 
and then pour into the pan ; shake for a minute or two 
to prevent sticking, and when the under side is of a 
bright golden brown, fold it in two, so as to make it 
like a half moon ; in a few seconds the edges will unite 
— it is then done ; take up without breaking, pass a sala- 
mander or hot shovel over it, and serve very hot on a 
hot dish. From five to six minutes is the average time 
for cooking omelettes of this size. If the yolks and 
whites are first well beaten separately, and then mixed 
and beaten again, the omelette will be lighter. 

Savory Omelette. 
Proceed as for plain omelette, only adding, before 



174 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

beating it up, a teaspoonful of minced parsley, another 
of spring onions, chopped very fine, and a few herbs, 
minced. Minced ham, oysters, &c — previously cooked 
— may be added to the above by mixing them with the 
eggs or sprinkling them ou the omelette just before 
doubling it over. 

Veal Kidney Omelette. 

Cut up some cold roast veal kidney into small dice, 
with a little bit of the fat, make it hot in gravy, with a 
seasoning of pepper, salt, and parsley. Do not let it 
boil. Have ready a plain omelette made as before di- 
rected, and just before doubling it over put the kidney 
into the middle; fold over, and serve as before. 

Cheese Omelette. 

Mix a little grated Parmesan cheese and a gill of 
cream with your eggs, and proceed as for plain ome- 
lette. 

Salmon Omelette. 

This is the English form of the celebrated Omelette au 
Than, of Brillat Savarin. Take the soft roes of two carp 
or mackerel; cleanse them in cold water, and then let 
them lie in boiling water (with a little salt) for five min- 
utes. Then chop up fine together these soft roes, a little 
piece of freshly-boiled salmon, and a minced shallot. 
When these are thoroughly mixed put them into a pan 
with a little butter; when the butter is just melted take it 
off the fire and mix well the whole with twelve fresh 
eggs — previously beaten — the yolks with a little salt, and 
the whites to a froth, and then again beaten together; 
then cook your omelette as directed for "plain omelette," 
and serve, very hot, on a hot dish, with a garnishing of 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 175 

chopped parsley and green spring onions, flavored with 
lemon juice. This is a marvelously delicious and suc- 
culent dish. 

Cold Fish Omelette. 

Put into a saucepan, with sufficient water to moisten 
them, any scraps of cold lobster, turbot, sole, or any other 
delicate white fish, and a few drops of some fish sauce; 
warm them through; have a good plain omelette ready 
for turning when the fish is nicely warm; put the fish in 
the middle, and fold over, as before directed. Serve in- 
stantly on a hot dish garnished with a few spring onions 
and parsley minced, with lemon juice in butter. 

Sweet Omelette. 

Proceed as for plain omelette, but use cream instead 
of milk or water, and powdered loaf sugar and grated 
lemon peel instead of pepper and salt. Serve very hot, 
dusted with powdered sugar. Instead of lemon you may 
flavour with noyeau, orange-flower water, &c. 

Fruit Preserve Omelette. 

Proceed as for sweet omelette, but, before beating up 
the eggs, add just enough jam or preserve to flavour the 
batter without weakening its consistency. A better way 
is to add the preserve in the pan before folding the 
omelette. Any jam, preserve, marmalade, candied peel, 
or preserved ginger can be appropriately put into a 
sweet omelette. 

On Omelettes generally. 

They should be cooked in a small pan, not more than 
six inches across. The omelette should be plump, very 
light and tender, and delicately browned. Never turn 



175 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

ofnelettes in the pan; it renders them flat and tough, 
whereas they should be juicy, succulent, and as soft as 
cream inside. Never be afraid of beating the eggs too 
much — to do so is practically impossible. Never serve 
gravy in the same dish, as it flattens and soddens what 
should be balloon-like and light. Serve the instant they 
are done, on a very hot dish. Never cook them until five 
or six minutes before wanted, as the essence of a good 
omelette is that it should be hot, soft, thick, and fresh. 

Pancakes. 

Beat up well eight yolks and six whites of eggs in a 
quart of milk, make a paste of about half a pound of 
flour and a little milk, add to the eggs and milk, and 
when of the consistency of thick cream, put about half 
an ounce of butter into your frying-pan (which must be 
perfectly clean) and let it melt ; then drop in sufficient 
batter, and fry on both sides to a good color. Send to 
table in small quantities, hot and hot, on a hot dish gar- 
nished with cut lemon. Powdered loaf sugar and halved 
lemons should be served with them. A glass of brandy 
and a little powdered cinnamon or grated nutmeg im- 
prove the batter. A richer receipt is, — To six table- 
spoonfuls of flour add twelve eggs well beaten, a tumbler 
full of white wine, half a pound of butter which has been 
melted, and is nearly cold, the same weight of pounded 
lump sugar, a little grated nutmeg and powdered cinna- 
mon, a quart of cream, and a wineglass of ratafia ; mix 
it well ; beat the batter for some time, and pour very 
thin into the pan. Strew with pounded white sugar; 
serve as before. 

Rice Pancakes. 

Boil half a pound of well-cleaned rice to a jelly, with 
a little water; when cold, mix with it a pint of cream, 
eight eggs well beaten, salt, and nutmeg to taste. Stir 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 177 

in eight ounces of butter just warmed, and as much flour 
as will thicken the batter. Fry and serve as before. 

Chicken Fritters. 

Take some new milk, and put to it in a stewpan as 
much flour of rice as will give it a tolerable consistency. 
Beat four eggs and mix them well with the rice and milk. 
Add a pint of cream, set it on the fire and stir well. Put 
in some powdered sugar, candied lemon peel cut small, 
and fresh grated lemon peel. Cut the white meat off a 
roasted chicken, pull it into very small shreds, and put it 
to the other ingredients, stirring the wliole together. 
This will make a rich paste, which must be rolled out, 
cut into fritters, fried in boiling lard, or butter, till a 
good brown, and served very hot, with powdered loaf 
sugar in the dish. 

Pig's Fry. 

Take about a pound to a pound and a half of pig's 
fry, and put into a pie-dish in layers, the lean fry at the 
bottom and the fat fry at the top, season with minced sage, 
chopped onions, pepper, and salt. Cover the whole with 
a layer of potatoes, fill the dish with boiling water, and 
bake in a sharp oven for about two hours. 

Lamb's Fry. 

Serve as for Pig's Fry, season with parsley, ^^^y and 
bread crumbs, instead of the sage and onions.

COLD MEAT COOKERY. 

Hashed Goose. 

The remains of a roast goose should always be hashed. 
Cut the meat off the bones, and put the latter, broken, 
into a stewpan with a spoonful of chopped onions and 
an ounce of butter; pass over the fire until rather brown, 
when mix in a tablespoonful of flour, put in the cut up 
meat of the goose, season with pepper and salt, add about 
a pint of stock or water, simmer ten minutes or a quarter 
of an hour, dish and serve. 

Hashed Mutton. 

Cut all the meat off any cold joint of mutton, dredge 
with flour, and put it into a stewpan, with a slice of 
ham; add a little stock or water; season well with pep- 
per, salt, and cayenne, and let it get thoroughly hot 
without boiling; when serve it should be garnished with 
poached or sliced eggs and fried or toasted sippets. If 
mutton is hashed with fine herbs, it is done in the fol- 
lowing way: — Take a piece of butter, add about a table- 
spoonful of chopped shallots, and put them on the fire 
for a short time, but not sufficiently long to turn brown; 
then add four spoonfuls of finely chopped mushrooms, 
a spoonful of chopped parsley, and a spoonful of flour; 
turn them all well in, and add about a pint of good 
stock, or a little water, seasoning with salt, pepper, and 
a little nutmeg; then put in the mutton, and let it get 
thoroughly hot, garnish as before. 

Hashed Beef, Veal, Lamb, &e. 

Proceed as for mutton, stewing the bones with the 
meat in stock or water, with whatever flavorings are 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 179 

preferred. Never use more stock or gravy than is neces- 
sary for the stewing ; as hashes should never be watery. 
Garnish with plain dumplings, or sippets of fried or 
toasted bread. Hashes, like stews, should simmer, not 
boil. If more gravy is required when done, serve it 
separately in a tureen. 

Curried Lamb, Beef, Veal, or Poultry. 

Proceed as for hashing, adding curry-powder to the 
mixture. Serve either with plain boiled rice, or when 
half done put the rice into the stew. 

Hashed Game. 

Take the best joints of any cold game, and put the 
bones and trimmings into a stewpan with a pint of water 
or stock, an onion, a bit of lemon peel, two or three 
cloves, and pepper and salt. When these have simmered 
for about an hour, strain and thicken with a little butter 
and flour; put in about a tablespoonful each of catsup 
and lemon juice, and a glass of port wine. Then put in 
the pieces of game, and let them gradually warm 
through, but not boil. Serve garnished with sippets. A 
little curry-powder is sometimes added, but it is seldom 
thought an improvement. 

Hashed Venison. 

Take any part of cold venison, and cut the meat 
neatly from the bones. Put the bones and trimmings 
into a stewpan with a little good gravy, and stew gently 
for an hour; then strain the gravy, add a glass of port 
wine, and half a one of catsup, and put in a thickening 
of flour and butter, give this one boil up, skim, and let 
it get a little cool. Then add the slices of meat, put on 



I So DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

the side of the fire, and Avhcn just about to simmer, serve, 
■with red-currant jelly. 

Stew of Cold Veal. 

Cut the meat from the bones of any joint of cold veal; 
cut into moderate-sized pieces, and fry to a light brown 
with butter and a sliced onion; when done put on one 
side. Put the bones in cold water, and stew for three 
hours. This will make excellent soup or broth, which 
may be flavored with parslc}', celery, or any other vege- 
table. A pint of this broth, before any other flavor than 
parsley has been added, is needed for the meat, which 
put into a saucepan with it and stew gently for an hour. 
Add flour, a little catsup, cayenne pepper and salt. Give 
it a boil up, and serve with sippets of toasted or fried 
bread. 

Turkey or Fowl Sausages. 

Take the meat of a cold boiled or roasted turkey or 
fowl, and cut up small: if about a pound and a half, put 
a teaspoonful of chopped onions into a stewpan, with a 
piece of butter, pass a few seconds over the fire, then 
mix in gently a little flour and the mince, which moisten 
with a pint either of ordinary stock, or stock made from 
the bones; simmer some time, keeping it moved, season 
with pepper, salt, and sugar, add the beaten yolks of 
three eggs, stir in quickl)'^ over the fire, not allowing it 
to boil; pour out upon a dish till cold; just before ready 
to serve, divide it into equal parts, roll out each to what- 
ever shajie preferred, egg and bread-crumb twice over, 
fry in lard, or clarified dripping of a light brown color, 
and serve very hot. 

Cold Meat Minced. 
Take the remains of any cold joints, and chop up fine 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. i8i 

with some fat ham or bacon; add a little salt, cayenne, 
grated lemon-peel, nutmeg, parsley, and a few bread- 
crumbs. Put all into a saucepan, with two tablespoon- 
fuls of cream, two beaten eggs, and two ounces of butter 
to every pound of chopped meat. Stir over the fire for 
five minutes. Let the mixture get cold, and then put it 
into light paste to bake, either in the form of patties or 
rolls. Or, when all ready, stew in gravy for about half 
an hour, thicken with flour, and serve in an open dish, 
very hot; garnish with forcemeat balls, or sippets of 
toast. 

Cold Fowl or Turkey 

may be minced as above, adding, if liked, a little cay 
enne, pounded mace, savory herbs, and two or three 
sliced or cut up eggs — hard boiled. 

Poultry of all Kinds 

may be served thus : — Take from the bones all the deli- 
cate meat, clear it from the skin, and keep covered until 
wanted for use. Stew the bones, well bruised, and the 
skin, with a pint of water, until reduced to half, strain 
the gravy and let it cool ; skim, and put it into a clean 
saucepan, with a gill of milk, three ounces of butter, well 
mixed with a dessert-spoonful of flour, a little pounded 
mace, and grated lemon-rind ; keep stirred until they 
just boil, then put in the meat finely minced, with three 
hard-boiled eggs, chopped small, salt and white pepper. 
Shake the mince over the fire until it is just ready to 
boil, stir to it quickly a squeeze of lemon ; dish with 
/ pale sippets of fried or toasted bread, and serve quickly. 

Beef or Mutton Pudding. 

Boil some good potatoes until they are ready to fall 
to pieces ; drain well in a sieve, clear tiiem of all im- 



1 82 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

purities and specks, mash, and make into a smooth batter, 
with two eggs, and a little milk. Then place a layer of 
rather thick slices of cold roast beef or mutton, seasoned 
with pepper and salt, at the bottom of a baking dish, 
cover them with the batter, and so on till the dish is full, 
adding a thin layer of butter at the top. Bake it till well 
browned. 

Baked Beef. 

Cut roast beef in slices and put them in a pie-dish, 
with alternate layers of thinly sliced onions, carrots, and 
turnips (which should all be first parboiled); season well 
with minced herbs, pepper and salt, add a little stock of 
gravy, cover with a crust of mashed potatoes, and bake 
for thirty to forty minutes in a sharp oven. 

Pried Beef. 

Slices of cold beef are excellent fried in butter, with 
sliced onions ; well seasoned, and served with a little 
gravy. 

Eagont of Beef. 

Cut in neat and rather large pieces the meat off a 
joint of cold roast beef ; put them in a stewpan with a 
few sliced onions, pepper, salt, and spice, add a glass of 
boiling water and a little gravy or stock ; simmer very 
gently for "about two hours ; serve hot with pickled wal- 
nuts or gherkins. 



Eagout of Mutton. 

Proceed as above, adding a few turnips and carrots. 
Allow nearly an hour to stew. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 183 

Ragout of Veal. 

Fry the meat to a light brown first; then stew for half 
an hour in a little gravy or hot water; thicken with flour 
and butter, and flavor with catsup, lemon juice, and a 
glass of sherry. Forcemeat balls improve it. 

Fricasseed Fowl, Veal, Lamb, &c. 

Take the meat and cut into nice pieces, without bone 
or fat. Make a gravy of the bones, &c., by stewing them 
with a little lemon-peel, savory herbs, pounded mace, 
sliced onion, pepper and salt, in, say, a pint of water. 
When this is reduced to half, strain it, and add the meat. 
Warm it well, but do not let it boil, stir in a pinch of 
flour; mix the yolks of a couple of eggs in a gill of 
cream, and add it to the sauce; this must all get hot again, 
but must not boil. Serve in a covered dish. 

Mutton Fie. 

Take any cold mutton, and cut into small pieces; use 
very little fat, season with whole pepper and salt; when 
liked, minced onions may be added. Put the meat in 
layers into the dish, add a little stock or rich mutton 
gravy, and a tablespoonful of mushroom or walnut cat- 
sup; cover with a good crust and bake in a moderate 
oven. This should be eaten very hot, and, when cut, a 
cupful of richly seasoned hot gravy should be put in. 
A sheep's kidney or two, sliced or cut small, is a great 
improvement. 

Cold Veal Pie. 

Take a little of the veal and an equal quantity of ham ; 
mince together, and season highly with salt, pepper, 
spices, and herbs chopped, and a small clove of garlic, or 



IS4 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

shallot when liked; pound in a mortar, add eggs and an 
equal quantity of veal gravy; cover the bottom of a pan 
with thin slices of bacon, lay a little of this forcemeat 
upon it, put some slices of the cold veal over the force- 
meat, seasoning them with pepper and minced mush- 
rooms; in this manner fill to the top, covering the whole 
with forcemeat; bake for an hour and let it cool; put into 
a pie dish, cover with a good paste crust, and bake for an 
hour and a half in a hot oven. When done put in a little 
good veal gravy or stock, well seasoned. This may be 
eaten either hot or cold. 

Rabbit, Fowl, or Game 

can be substituted for the veal ; but the veal forcemeat 
should always be used. 

Pork Pie. 

Take the remains of a loin or leg of roast pork, cut 
into tolerably thick slices without bone, beat it well with 
a rolling-pin ; season highly with pepper, salt, and, if 
liked, sage. When the dish is full, add a little veal 
gravy, and bake in a moderate oven. 

Siiuab Pie. 

Line the dish with a thin crust, put in a layer of 
sliced apples (peeled and cored), then a layer of slices of 
mutton, seasoned with pepper and salt, another layer of 
apples, another of mutton, and on top a layer of onions 
sliced. Add some water or gravy, and bake in a moder- 
ate oven. Remains of poultry, roast pork, veal, or beef 
are frequently added to this pie. 

Potato Pie. 
Take some good potatoes, peel and slice them thin, 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 185 

and put them in your pie-dish with alternate layers of 
either beef, mutton, pork, or veal ; season well ; add a 
little water or stock ; put on a good crust, and bake. 
A few slices of kidney improve this pie. 

Cold Fish Pie. 

Any remains of cold boiled turbot, cod, sole, lobster, 
salmon or whiting may be made into a very savory pie 
thus : — Remove the meat from the bones, without break- 
ing it too small, and season with whole pepper, salt, a 
clove or two, a littled grated nutmeg, and some sweet 
herbs, minced fine. Lay the fish in the dish with two or 
three hard-boiled eggs, cut small, a sliced onion (when 
liked), and two or three bits of butter ; add a little water 
or stock, cover with a good crust, and bake. The re- 
mains of a salmon and a lobster (or some lobster or 
shrimp sauce) make a capital pie. By the same rule a 
few blanched and bearded oysters, or a little cold oyster 
sauce, improves cod pie. In these latter cases the hard- 
boiled eggs are better left out. 

Gold God 

may be dressed in several ways — either curried, or served 
with cream, or bechamel sauce (see receipt). The first 
way is to break the fish into flakes and fry it with a sliced 
onion in butter. Put it into a stewpan with a little white 
stock, and a bit of butter, rolled in flour; simmer for ten 
minutes; then mix together a gill of cream, a bit of but- 
ter, and a salt-spoonful of curry-powder; add these to 
the fish, give it all one boil up and serve. If it be served 
with cream, substitute lemon juice for the curry, and let 
it warm, but not boil. With bechamel sauce, put a gill of 
the sauce into a stewpan with butter, and when melted 
add some pepper, salt, and the flakes of fish; when warm 
through, dish, pour over a little butter, sprinkle some 



i86 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

bread crumbs, and brown with a salamander; garnish 
with fried or toasted sippets. 

Bubble and Squeak. 

Fry some thin slices of cold boiled beef in a little 
butter; take them out and keep hot. Squeeze dry some 
cold cabbage or savoy, and mince it small ; put the cab- 
bage into the butter, with a sliced onion, pepper and 
salt, and fry gently for some little time. Serve very hot, 
the cabbage under the meat. Of course freshly boiled 
cabbage will answer the same purpose. Sliced cold 
potatoes are often fried with the cabbage. 

Hodge Podge. 

Mince some cold roast mutton, lamb, or veal, and 
slice up a few green onions and a couple of lettuces; 
simmer these gently in a stewpan, with a little butter, 
pepper and salt, and sufficient water or stock to moisten 
them, for three-quarters of an hour, stirring from time 
to time. Serve very hot. A few green peas, boiled 
separately and put into the stew just before serving, 
greatly improve it. 

Pepper Pot. 

Put two quarts of water in a large stewpan, and add, 
cut small, such vegetables as are in season; in summer, 
peas, lettuce, spinach, and two or three onions; in win- 
ter, carrots, turnips, onions, and celery. Stew them 
with two pounds of mutton, or the meat off a cold fowl, 
and a pound of pickled pork, till they are tender — the 
meat should be cut small. While boiling, skim, and half 
an hour before serving, clear a lobster or crab from the 
shell, and put the meat into the stew; to which some add 
small suet dumplings. Season with salt and cayenne. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 187 

A little rice may be boiled with the stew. The lobster 
is of course not necessary, but it greatly improves the 
flavor. When ready to serve strain off part of the gravy, 
dish, make the top smooth, sprinkle cayenne liberally 
over it, and brown the top with a salamander. Any 
cold meats may be used instead of or with the mutton 
or fowl. 



SICK-ROOM COOKERY. 

In addition to the receipts which follow, there are 
numerous others; — such as plainly-dressed poultry, meat 
and fish, light nourishing soups, jellies, cooked fruits, 
and light puddings, — that may be eaten during the prog- 
ress towards convalescence. 

Be scrupulously neat and clean in all preparations 
for the sick-room, and let everything be served on snow- 
white cloths. 

Never allow food to remain at the patient's bedside; 
if he does not care to it eat when brought to him, take it 
away, and bring it, or something else, when wanted. 

A little jelly, beef-tea, lemonade, toast and water, 
broth, or milk should always be ready to take up the in- 
stant the patient asks for it, as with invalids the desire 
to eat soon passes away. 

Do not quite fill cups, glasses, basins, as a dirty sau- 
cer or tray is a great irritant, and a soiled sheet or pillow 
an absolute worry to a sick person. 

Let every article of food intended for the patient be 
well and carefully dressed; and remember that fat is 
almost always distasteful. 

Hard-boiled eggs are very difficult of digestion, but 
the whites should be set, or the slimy appearance of the 
egg will create nausea. 



1 88 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Toast and water should be made some time before it 
is wanted, and allowed to stand till quite cold. 

The smaller the quantity, and the greater the variety 
of the food, the more appetizing will it appear. 



GRUELS AND PORRIDGES. 

For the sick-room various slight preparations of oat- 
meal, flour, &c., may be readily prepared. These, when 
nicely cooked and properly flavored are very grateful to 
the palate of the invalid. 

Water Gruel. 

Mix two tablespoonfuls of fresh oatmeal in a quart of 
water, and set it on a clear fire. When just ready to boil, 
take it off and pour it backward and forward from one 
basin to another several times. Then set again on the 
fire, and let it just come to the boil, when it should be 
turned into a basin and allowed to settle. If thoroughly 
cooked it will not need to be steamed; but if any lumps 
appear in it, steam through a hair sieve. Adda little salt 
to taste. 

Another "Way. 

Mix a little fine oatmeal in a small quantity of cold 
water, then adding the rest of the water, and boiling very 
gently, until it becomes sufficiently thick to be agreeable; 
season with salt or sugar. 

Groat Gruel. 

Groats are crushed oats deprived of their outer skins. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 189 

These are very gently boiled for a long time, and being 
passed through a sieve, to separate the groats, the gruel 
has soon the appearance of a fine jelly. It is then eaten 
with sugar, and if there be no inflammatory symptom, 
with the addition of a little sherry wine, or brandy. In 
this state it is very wholesome, as it satisfies the appetite 
without fatiguing the stomach. 

Kice Gruel. 

Soak two tablespoonfuls of fine rice in cold water for 
half an hour. Pour off the water, and to the rice add a 
pint or rather more of new milk. Simmer gently till the 
rice is tender, then pulp through a sieve and mix with the 
milk. Heat over the fire, add a little more milk gradu- 
ally, pour off to cool, and flavor with salt or sugar; and, 
in some cases, with sherry or other white wine. 

Bread Pap. 

Pour scalding water on white bread, mash, strain, and 
add new milk, seasoned with sugar. 

Oatmeal Pap. 

To two-thirds of water gruel, when cold, add one- 
third of unboiled new milk, and warm up, flavored with 
salt or sugar. 

Another Method. 

Stir into a pint of water three tablespoonfuls of fresh 
oatmeal, let it stand till clear, and pour off. Put a pint 
of fresh water to the oatmeal, stir well, and leave till 
next day. Strain the liquor through a sieve, and set it 
in a saucepan over a clear fire. Add about half as much 
milk, gradually, while it is warming, and when it is just 



I90 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

ready to boil, take it off, pour it into a basin, and set it 
by to cool. Add thereto a little salt or sugar. 

Arrow-Root. 

Put a full dessert-spoonful of good arrow-root into a 
basin, and mix with it as much cold new milk as will 
form a paste. Pour thereon half a pint of milk scalding 
hot, and stir it well to keep it smooth. Set it on the fire 
till it is ready to boil, take it off, pour it into a basin, and 
let it cool. Flavor with sugar, and, for convalescents, 
add a little wine. It is not usual to boil the arrow-root 
at all. 

Sago. 

Soak a table-spoonful of sago in cold water for an 
hour, then pour off the water, and substitute a pint of 
fresh ; simmer gently till reduced to about half the 
quantity ; then pour it into a basin to cool ; flavor with 
sugar, salt, or wine, to taste. 

Rice Milk. 

After washing the rice, set it over the fire for half an 
hour, with a little water. Gradually add some warm 
milk, till the whole is of proper consistency. Season 
with salt or sugar. 

Ground Rice Milk. 

Make a large spoonful of ground rice into a batter 
with new milk. Set a pint of new milk over the fire, and 
when it is scalding hot, stir in the batter, and keep stir- 
ring, one way, till it thickens, but do not allow it to boil. 
Cool in a basin, and flavor with salt or sugar. 

MiUet Milk. 
Wash three tablespoonfuls of millet seed in cold 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 191 

water, and put it into a quart of new milk. Simmer gen- 
tly till it is moderately thick ; pour it into a basin to cool, 
and flavor with salt or susrar. 



Barley Water. 

To a handful of barley add three pints of water. 
Simmer gently till of a proper thickness, strain and 
flavor with salt or sugar. 

Pearl Barley Water. 

To an ounce of pearl barley add half a pint of cold 
water, set it on the fire, and when hot pour off the water, 
and add a quart of fresh. Simmer for an hour, strain, 
season and let it cool. 

Apple Water. 

Slice two or three ripe apples, v/ithout paring, into a 
jug, pour on a quart of scalding water, let it stand till 
cool, and season with sugar. 

Toast and Water. 

Toast a slice of new bread quite brown, but not burnt, 
and then put it in a jug of boiling water. When quite 
cold remove the toast, and it is fit for drinking. Burnt 
bread ruins toast and water. 

Sippets. 

Toast nicely brown some thin slices of white bread, 
cut into diamonds, and pour over them some good hot 
gravy, without butter. 

Caudle. 

Make a smooth gruel of good grits, and when well 



192 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

boiled, strain, stirring occasionally till cold; add sugar, 
wine, lemon peel, and nutmeg. A spoonful of brandy 
may be added, and also lemon juice. 

Another Way 

is, to boil some water, put therein grated rice, that has 
been mixed with cold water, and when properly thick- 
ened, add sugar, lemon peel, cinnamon, and a glass of 
brandy. Boil the whole together. If used cold, boil a 
quart of water, and after it has stood, add the yolk of an 
^^^, the juice of a lemon, six spoonfuls of sweet wine, 
sugar, and syrup of lemons. For brown caudle, made a 
gruel with six spoonfuls of oatmeal, and strain. Then 
add a quart of good malt liquor, boil, sweeten, and put 
in half a pint of white wine, with spices or not, to taste. 



JELLIES. 



Though there is little real nourishment in jellies, 
they are very grateful to weak stomachs, and can be 
eaten when, almost every other food is rejected. 

Tapioca Jelly. 

Wash the tapioca in three or four waters, then soak 
it again in fresh for five hours, and simmer till quite 
clear. Add lemon juice, wine, and sugar. 



Isinglass Jelly. 

Boil one ounce of isinglass, with a few corns of 
pimento and a crust of bread, in a quart of water. 
Simmer till reduced one half, and strain. It may be 
flavored with wine. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 193 

Rice Jelly. 

Take of rice, sago, pearl barley, and shavings of 
hartshorn, one ounce each. Simmer in a quart of water 
till reduced to a pint. Add wine or milk. 

Buttermilk. 

Place milk in a small churn, and when it has stood 
about ten minutes begin churning, continuing to do so 
till the flakes of butter appear, and the discharged milk 
is thin and blue. Strain through a sieve, and it is fit to 
drink. 



POSSETS, WHEYS, &c. 

Various preparations of milk, eggs, and wine are 
useful in the sick-room, but they should only be given 
to the patient when ordered by the doctor, or under the 
direction of an experienced nurse. 

Wine Posset. 

To a quart of new milk add the crumb of a penny 
loaf, and boil the whole till the bread is soft, then take 
it off, grate therein half a nutmeg, and some sugar, put 
it into a basin, with a pint of Lisbon wine, very gradu- 
ally, or the curd will be hard and tough. Serve with 
toast. 

Sack Posset. 

Beat up twelve eggs, and strain ; then put half a 
pound of lump sugar into a pint of sherry and mix the 
same with the ^%^. Set over a chafing dish, and stir till 
scalding hot. In the meantime, grate some nutmeg in a 
quart of milk, and heat it ; then pour it over the g^^ and 
9 



194 DOMESTIC COOKERY, 

wine, stirring it all the while. Then take it off, set it 
before the fire half an hour, and it will be ready. 



Another Method. 

Take a quart of new milk, four Naples biscuits, 
crumble them, and when the milk boils, throw them in. 
Give it another boil, then take it off, grate therein some 
nutmeg, and sweeten it to taste, add half a pint of sherry, 
stirring it all the time. 

Brandy Posset. 

Boil a quart of cream, with a stick of cinnamon in it, 
over a slow fire, and take it off to cool. Beat up the 
yolks of six eggs, mix the same with the cream, add 
some nutmeg and sugar to your taste, set it over a slow 
fire, and stir it all one way; when it appears like a fine 
custard, pour it into a basin, add a glass of brandy and 
serve. 

Ale Fosset. 

Put a little bread into a pint of milk, set it over the 
fire, and when it boils, add a pint of strong ale, with nut- 
meg and sugar. Let it stand a few minutes to clear, and 
the curd will float on the surface. 



White Wine Whey. 

Put a pint of new milk, and half a pint of white wine, 
into a basin, and let it stand a few minutes; then pour 
over it a pint of boiling water, let it settle, and the curd 
will fall to the bottom. After this, pour the whey into 
another basin, and add a little sugar and a slice of lemon. 
— Whey may also be made with lemon or vinegar, and when 
clear, diluted with boiling water and sugar. This will 
excite perspiration. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 195 

Mustard Whey. 

To half a pint of boiling milk add a tablespoonful 
of made mustard. Strain from the curd, and administer. 
It will produce a glowing warmth. 

Curds and Whey. 

Although considered by many as a light dish, curds 
are heavy of digestion. Curds and whey is made simply 
by milk turned with rennet, and sweetened. Various 
kinds of curds and whey are in use under several names, 
but the differences between them consist entirely in the 
flavoring. 

Naples Curd. 

Boil a little cinnamon or nutmeg for a few minutes 
in a quart of milk, stirring in the well-beaten yolks of 
eight eggs, and a little white wine; boil, and strain 
through a sieve; beat up the curds with a little orange 
flower water, and powdered sugar; put into a mold to 
give shape; when compact, serve in a dish with a little 
fresh and sweetened cream. 

Mulled Wine. 

Thoroughly boil some spice and sugar in a little 
water till well flavored, then add an equal quantity of 
wine. Serve with toasted bread. Some add to mulled 
wine the yolks of eggs well beaten, and mixed with a 
little cold water, then poured backwards and forwards 
from the basin to the saucepan. Another way is, by boil- 
ing a little cinnamon and some grated nutmeg a few 
minutes in a large tea-cupful of water, then pour to it a 
pint of port wine, and add some sugar; beat it well up, 
and it will be fit to drink. 



196 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Beef Drink. 

Take off the fat and skin from a pound of lean beef, 
and having cut the meat in small pieces, put it into a 
gallon of water, with some toasted bread and a little salt; 
boil till reduced one half, and when cold take off the fat. 

Cool Drink. 

Beat up anew-laid egg, and mix with it half a pint of 
new milk warmed, a spoonful of capillaire, as much 
rose-water, and a little scraped nutmeg. It must not be 
warmed after the ^^^ is put in. 

Asses' Milk. 

This useful drink for consumptive patients should be 
milked into a glass, kept warm by being set in a basin of 
hot water. A teaspoonful of rum may be added just be- 
fore it is drank. 

Lemonade. 

For domestic use the addition of a small quantity of 
tartaric acid to carbonate of soda, to cause effervescence, 
makes an agreeable and wholesome drink. — Or the addi- 
tion of sugar to lemon juice and water, makes a nice cool 
beverage. Tamarinds, currants, or cranberries, added to 
hot water, and allowed to cool, make good drinks for in- 
valids. 

Barley Lemonade. 

Put a quarter of a pound of sugar into a small stew- 
pan with half a pint of water; boil till it forms a thickish 
syrup; then add the rind of a fresh lemon and the pulp 
of two lemons. Boil for a few minutes, add two quarts 
of barley-water, strain when cool, and bottle for use. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 197 

Barley Orangeade. 

Made in the same way by substituting the rind and 
juice of oranges, to which lemon juice is a great improve- 
ment. 



BROTHS. 



The best broths are made from mutton, veal, chicken, 
eels, and beef; their value as food being reckoned accord- 
ing to this order of placing. 

Mutton Broth. 

Take a pound and a half of scrag of mutton; break 
the bone, and put into a stewpan with a good pinch of 
salt, and from three pints to two quarts of cold water. 
Let this simmer very gently for two hours and a half, 
skimming off every particle of fat. Serve plain. 

Another Flan 

is to take the same quantity of meat and water, and stew 
for two hours and a half, withhalf atablespoonfulof salt, 
a dust of moist sugar, a button onion or two, a small 
stick of celery, and a slice or two of turnip. When be- 
ginning to boil draw it to the side of the fire, and let it 
simmer for two hours and a half, skimming off all the 
fat. Strain it through a fine hair sieve. The meat, if 
permitted, may be served separately. Pearl barley is an 
agreeable addition to mutton broth. Put in with the 
meat, say a tablespoonful, when first put on, and stew in 
the broth. It must not in this case be strained, but, after 
carefully skimming, remove the meat and vegetables. 
Vermicelli may be added after the broth is strained, just 



198 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

giving it ten minutes' steady boiling. Rice when added 
should have twenty minutes' boiling. Perhaps the best 
of these additions is arrowroot. After straining the 
broth, put it back in the pan, and when it boils up, stir in 
half a teaspoonful of an-owroot — previously made into a 
smooth paste, with a little cold water, and let it simmer 
for ten minutes. 

Veal Broth. 

Take two pounds of knuckle of veal, and cut up into 
small pieces, with a little bit of butter ; a few slices of 
carrot, turnip, and onion, a small stick of celery, and a 
pinch of salt ; put these on in a stewpan, and stir for 
about ten or twelve minutes ; then add about two quarts, 
or a little more, of hot water, and let the whole simmer 
for an hour and a half, skim, and strain through a hard 
sieve. Arrowroot, rice, or vermicelli may be added in 
the same way as directed for mutton broth. A calf's foot, 
split and boned, may with great advantage be stewed 
with the veal. If onions be disliked, they may be omit- 
ted. 

Chicken Eroth. 

Take the half of a small chicken, and put it on the fire 
in about a quart of cold water, with a small stick of 
celery, a bit of parsley, and a pinch of salt; when it boils 
skim thoroughly, and let it simmer for about an hour. 
Strain as before. A teaspoonful of fiour may be added 
as thickening. When the broth is strained put it back 
on the fire, and let it boil up, then add the flour, mixed 
to a paste with a little cold water, stir in, and simmer for 
fifteen minutes. 

Eel Broth. 

Put a young eel or two cut up small into three pints 
of water, with parsley, and a few peppercorns ; let the 
whole simmer till the eels are broken, and the liquor re- 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 199 

duced to half the quantity. Add a little salt. An ex- 
cellent and nutritious broth may also be made in the 
same way from Tench. 

Beef Tea. 

Take a pound of lean gravy beef without bone, and 
cut into small dice ; put on in a quart of cold water with 
a little salt. When it boils up skim carefully, and let it 
simmer very gently for thirty or forty minutes. Strain 
very carefully and put aside for use. Beef tea is always 
better if made the day before it is wanted, and then 
warmed up, as when cold every particle of fat can be re- 
moved. If wanted very good use a larger proportion of 
meat to the quart of water. 

Baked Beef Tea. 

Cut up one pound of meat as before, and put it in a 
warm oven, in a jar, with nearly a quart of water, and a 
pinch of salt. Simmer very gently indeediox several hours. 
If put at night into an oven that has been very hot all 
day, and allowed to remain in till the morning, it should 
be done. Then strain as before. When allowed, beef 
tea is rendered more savory by the addition of an onion, 
a few herbs, and a clove. 

Beef Tea in Ten Minutes. 

When beef tea is wanted in a great hurry get some 
lean beef, put it on a board, and scrape it with a very 
sharp knife into shreds. Put into a stewpan, pour a 
tumbler of boiling water over it, and let it stand by the 
fire, covered, for ten minutes. Then strain it into a 
tumbler, which place in very cold water, remove the fat, 
pour into a warm teacup, stand it in hot water, and when 
warm enough serve. A piece of Liebig's Essence 0/ Meat, 



200 DOMESTIC COOKER Y. 

about as large as a walnut, will make a pint of good 
beef tea. Put the extract into a cup, and pour over it 
boiling water ; stir for two or three minutes, and add salt 
to taste. 

Babbits Stewed in Milk. 

Make into a smooth paste two teaspoonf uls of flour and 
a little milk; then add about a pint and a half more milk, 
which must be very good and fresh. ' Cut up into small 
joints two very young rabbits; put into a stewpan with 
the milk, a blade of mace, and salt and pepper to taste; stir 
from time to time, and simmer very slowly for about 
half an hour. This may be eaten either hot or cold. 
This quantity would suffice the invalid for four meals, so 
that half may be made. 

Stewed Cutlet. 

Take off all the fat from a nice mutton cutlet, and put 
into a stewpan with a third of a pint of cold water, half 
a stick of celery, pepper and salt; simmer very gently 
for fully two hours, skimming from time to time. The 
water ?mist never be allowed to boil. Strain the broth and 
serve with the cutlet. When celery is not liked, omit it; 
and substitute a few sweet herbs. 



Stewed Calf's Foot. 

Stew a blanched calf's foot in a pint of milk and the 
same quantity of water, for about four hours, simmering 
gently all the time, with a flavoring of a little lemon- 
peel, mace, pepper, and salt, and when liked a little 
celery and onion. Stir in a gill of cream five minutes 
before serving. Take out the onion and celery. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY, 201 

Mutton Chop. 

Remove nearly all the fat, broil well over, or in front 
of a clear fire, and serve very hot without gravy or sauce; 
with pepper and salt by the side of the plate. Lamb 
Chops are not to be recommended for invalids. 

Boiled and Eoast Fowl. 

These invalids' luxuries will be found under the 
heads Roasting and Boiling. 



PUDDINGS AND PIES. 

Yorkshire Pudding. 

Beat up well, and mix gradually with six heaped 
tablespoonfuls of flour and a teaspoonful of salt, six 
eggs; then pour in by degrees as much milk as will re- 
duce the batter to the consistence of rather thin cream. 
Beat the batter briskly and lightly the instant before it 
is poured into the pan, watch it carefully that it may not 
burn, and let the edges have an equal share of the fire. 
When the pudding is quite firm in every part, and well 
colored on the surface, it is done. If put under a roast- 
ing joint, it may be made thicker than if simply baked 
by itself. Pour off the fat before serving. 

Peais Pudding. 

Take a quart of split peas, and dry them thoroughly 
before the fire: then tie them up loosely in a cloth, put 
into warm water, boil, until quite tender; take them up, 
beat them well in a dish with a little salt, the yolk of an 



202 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

^^%, and a bit of butter. Make the whole quite smooth, 
tie it up again in a cloth, and boil it an hour longer. 
Serve with boiled pork. 

Batter Pudding. 

Mix smooth with a little milk three good tablespoon- 
fuls of flour; add a pint of milk and a bit of butter, stir 
well; beat up with a little salt, three eggs, or four small 
ones. Boil for an hour in a well-floured cloth that has 
been wrung out of boiling water. This pudding is eaten 
with jam, stewed fruits, or marmalade, or served plain 
with sweet sauce. It may also be baked — putting it into 
a buttered dish or tin, or several cups, and baking in a 
moderate oven for about half an hour. 



Yeast Dumplings. 

Take half a quartern of bread-dough — that made with 
milk is best — put it in front of the fire for five minutes, 
make it into about eight or nine dumplings, put them, 
into boiling water, and boil for eighteen to twenty min- 
utes. Serve instantly. 

Suet Pudding. 

Chop very fine six ounces of beef suet, add six ounces 
of flour, and two ounces of crumb of bread, grated, a 
little salt, a pint of milk, and six eggs well beaten; mix 
the whole well together, and boil in a cloth for four or 
five hours; serve plain, to eat with meat, or with sweet 
sauce. 

Cheese Pudding. 

Put into a saucepan half a pound of good grated 
cheese, with a pint of new milk, six ounces of grated 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 203 

bread crumbs, and two eggs well beaten; stir well, till 
the cheese is dissolved; then put it into a buttered dish, 
and brown it in a Dutch oven, or with a salamander. 
Serve quite hot. 

Hasty Pudding. 

Put a quart of water on to boil; stir six tablespoon- 
fuls of Indian meal or rye-meal — sifted thoroughly — into 
a bowl of water; when the water in the saucepan boils, 
pour into it the contents of the bowl, stir up well, and 
let it boil up thick, put in salt to taste; then sprinkle in 
meal, handful after handful, stirring it all the time, and 
letting it boil between whiles. When it is so thick that 
you stir it with difficulty — it is done. It takes about half 
an hour. Eat it with milk or molasses. If the system is 
in a restricted state, nothing can be better than rye 
hasty pudding and molasses. Dyspepsia is greatly re- 
lieved by it. Be careful to observe that Indian corn in 
all its preparations requires thorough cooking. If not 
sufficiently done, it loses its flavor and becomes indiges- 
tible. 

Hominy Pudding. 

This may be either baked or boiled. Mix the hom- 
iny (Indian corn bruised) which has been previously 
boiled, either in milk or water, with eggs, a little sugar 
and nutmeg, a little chopped suet, and with or without 
currants ajid raisins, as preferred. Tie up in a basin, 
and boil two hours, or put into a pie dish, and bake in a 
moderate oven. 

Potato Pudding. 

Take two or three pounds of boiled potatoes (cold 
ones will do), pound them in a mortar with from half a 
pound to a pound of butter, previously melted for the 
purpose, the same weight of pounded loaf sugar, a quar- 



204 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

ter of a pound of blanched sweet almonds bruised, a lit- 
tle grated nutmeg, and half a glass of ratafia, or other 
liquor (brandy will do if no liquor at hand). Boil in a 
cloth, or a buttered basin, and serve with sv/eet sauce 
{see receipt). 

Bread Pudding. 

Take any good pieces of stale bread, and scald them 
in boiling milk or water. When cold mash the bread, 
and having laid in the bottom of a pudding dish some 
preserved gooseberries, currants, or other fruit, jam or 
marmalade, add the bread; then pour over it some good 
milk, three well beaten eggs, and a little orange-flower 
water; bake for half an hour. Grate nutmeg over the 
top when served. 

Brown Bread Pudding. • 

A capital pudding is made of stale brown, or even 
white bread, by cutting it into thin slices, and browning 
it in a moderate oven, then reducing it to a very fine pow- 
der, and soaking it in as much gin, rum, or brandy, as it 
will fairly absorb. Whip up the yolks of a few eggs, 
and make the whole into a paste. Then whisk the whites 
of the eggs very stiff, add to them some sliced candied peel 
— citron is best — and a little powdered cinnamon. Mix 
all well up together, put into a buttered dish or mold, 
and bake in a moderate oven for an hour to an hour and 
a half. Make a sauce of a few blanched and sliced al- 
monds, currants, or raisins, candied peel — cut up very 
small — made hot in a little port or Burgundy, and pour 
over the pudding. For economy the sauce may be dis- 
pensed with. 

Plum Pudding. 
There are various excellent receipts for making a 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 205 

Christmas pudding, and we have selected a few of the 
best. Christmas puddings may be made in the autumn, 
boiled so that another hour's boiling will suffice, taken 
out of their cloths, and put into a dry place until wanted, 
then put into boiling water, boiled fast for one hour, 
and served. 

1. Put into a large basin one pound of fine Malaga 
raisins (picked and stoned), one pound of best currants 
(well washed in several waters, dried in a coarse cloth, 
and carefully picked), three-quarters of a pound of pow- 
dered loaf or fine brown sugar, one pound of sweet beef 
suet (chopped moderately fine), half a pound of beef mar- 
row (cut up small) — if beef marrow cannot be obtained 
use another half pound of chopped suet; eight ounces of 
candied peel — citron, lemon, and orange mixed — (sliced 
very thin), two ounces of ground or finely chopped sweet 
almonds, five ounces of flour, and five ounces of fine bread 
crumbs. Add a grated nutmeg, or half a stick of pow 
dered cinnamon, and a teaspoonful of salt, and mix the 
whole thoroughly with a little milk, a glass of brandy, 
and ten or twelve eggs (previously thoroughly beaten up 
together). It may then be either boiled in a well-floured 
cloth, or a pudding mold, tied up in a cloth. Put into 
a large saucepan full of boiling water, and let it boil fast 
for fully six hours — if in a mold one hour longer. Turn 
out carefully, cover the top with powdered sugar, deco- 
rate with a sprig of holly, and send to table very hot, with 
a little blazing brandy in the dish. Of course the holly 
and lighted brandy belong only to Christmas. Brandy 
sauce {see Receipt) usually accompanies Christmas plum 
pudding. 

2. One pound and a half of finely-chopped beef suet, 
one pound of grated bread, one pound of well-washed 
currants, one pound of stoned raisins, one glass of 
brandy, half a nutmeg grated, a teaspoonful of salt, eight 
eggs, leaving out half the whites, a small quantity of 



2o6 DOMESTTC COOKER V. 

loaf sugar (in powder), and a few bitter almonds. Boil 
in a floured cloth for six hours. Serve as before. 

3. Half a pound of potatoes, a quarter of a pound of 
carrots, well-boiled and worked through a colander, a 
tablespoonful of treacle, half a pound of currants, half a 
pound of raisins, quarter of a pound of moist sugar, 
quarter of a pound of suet, well chopped, four ounces of 
candied peel, a little grated nutmeg, and salt, half a 
pound of flour ; mix all together the night before wanted, 
and boil hard for four hours. 

4. Take one pound of suet, chopped fine, one pound 
of grated bread, onQ pound of carrots (boiled and passed 
through a colander), one pound of raisins, stoned, half a 
pound of currants, the rind of half a lemon shred as fine 
as possible, four eggs, a glass of brandy, a little grated 
nutmeg and salt, and as much milk as will make it a 
proper consistence ; boil it nine hours, and serve as be- 
fore. 

5. Take half a pound of grated bread or flour, half a 
pound of suet, three ounces of brown sugar, half a pound 
of currants, half a pound of raisins, a wineglass of 
brandy, the yolks of five eggs and whites of two, one 
nutmeg grated ; a little salt ; candied peel to taste. Mix 
well and boil four hours. 

6. Take half a pound of suet, chopped fine, half a 
pound of grated bread, half a pound of raisins, stoned; 
half a pound of currants, the yolks of three eggs, and 
the whites of two, a little nutmeg, two spoonfuls of 
sugar, and a salt-spoonful of salt. Boil six hours; serve 
as before. 

7. Take one pound of fresh beef suet, finely minced, 
add a pound of raisins (stoned and chopped), the same 
weight of currants (well washed, dried and picked), half 
a pound of flour, half a pound of grated bread, the peel 
of a lemon grated, half a nutmeg, grated, eight eggs well 
beaten, six ounces of candied citron, lemon, and orange 
peel, half a pound of brown sugar, a teaspoonful of salt, 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 207 

a glass of brandy, and a teacupful of cream or milk; mix 
all these ingredients well together, put them into a floured 
cloth, and boil for about seven hours, taking care that it 
does not stop boiling during that time, and keeping the 
vessel well filled up with boiling water as it wastes; be- 
fore serving, strew powdered loaf-sugar over it. Serve 
with brandy sauce {see receipt). 

Baked Plum Pudding. 

Scald a French roll in boiling milk, when the bread 
has become well soaked, drain off what milk remains, 
and, with a silver spoon, beat the bread to a pap, to 
which add a quarter of a pound of well cleaned currants, 
a quarter of a pound of melted butter, a little lemon- 
peel and nutmeg, grated, a few blanched sweet almonds 
(chopped line), and the yolks of four eggs well beaten, 
and sweeten to palate; mix all well together, potir into 
a buttered pie-dish, and bake for half an hour. This 
pudding is better eaten cold. 

Family Plum Pudding. 

Take a pound of flour, half a pound of beef suet, 
minced fine, half a pound of well washed currants, the 
rind of half a lemon grated, a few bitter almonds, grated, 
a little nutmeg, a pinch of salt, and an ounce of brown 
sugar; mix all these ingredients well together with four 
eggs, well beaten, and a little milk; pour into a buttered 
pie-dish or tin, and bake in a moderate oven for an hour. 
When done, turn it out, and strew it over with powdered 
lump sugar. 

Mince-Meat Pudding. 

Slice up a stale savoy cake, and fill up a pudding 
mold with it and mince-meat made thus: — Mince 
separately, very finely, two pounds of kidney beef suet, a 



2o8 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

quarter of a pound of mixed candied peel, half a pound 
of cooked beef — very lean — and two pounds of apples. 
Put all these things into a pan with two pounds of 
fine currants (washed, dried, and picked), a pound of 
raisins (stoned and chopped fine), a pound of moist 
sugar, and an ounce of mixed spice. Mix well together, 
and then add a gill of lemon juice, and about half a 
bottle of brandy. Mix these thoroughly until the 
whole is wet, but firm; then put into jars, and cover 
over with bladders to keep them air-tight; a little cin- 
namon, or ginger, or a few cloves may be added at 
will, and the quantity of citron peel increased. In a 
week this is ready for use. When the mold is iuU 
pour in some custard; bake for about half an hour. 

Roly Poly Pudding. 

Roll out some pudding crust {see Paste), and cover 
one side with any jam, marmalade or mincemeat. Roll 
up till it is the same shape as a large sausage, and tie it 
up rather loose in a floured cloth, carefully securing the 
ends. Put on in boiling water, and boil for about two 
hours, or longer if the pudding is very large, and serve 
either whole or in slices, with sweet sauce {see receipt). 
A variation of this pudding is to substitute raisins and 
sugar for the jam or marmalade. 

Lemon Dumplings. 

Chop fine four ounces of suet, and mix with eight 
ounces of bread-crumbs, four ounces of brown sugar, 
and the grated or finely-minced rind of a lemon. Mix 
thoroughly, add the juice of the lemon, strain through 
muslin; then add two beaten eggs, stir until the whole 
is amalgamated, then put into small buttered tins or 
cups, tie over, and boil fast for nearly an hour. Serve 
with powdered sugar and wine sauce {see receipt). 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 209 

Apple Dumplings. 

Peel and core half a dozen large apples, sugar to 
taste, cover each of them with crust, tie in floured cloths, 
and boil for about three quarters of an hour. Take off 
the cloths and serve hot. These may be baked, by put- 
ting them into a baking-dish or tin, without cloths, and 
baking in a moderately hot oven for thirty to forty 
minutes, or even longer if the apples be large. 

Currant Dumplings. 

Take six or seven ounces of finely-chopped suet, and 
mix it with a pound of flour ; clean three-quarters of a 
pound of currants, and add to the flour and suet, then 
make the whole in a soft dough with milk (water will do, 
but milk is far better); divide this quantity into about 
eight dumplings, drop them into a saucepan of boiling 
water, and boil hard for about forty minutes ; shake the 
saucepan now and then to prevent them sticking. They 
may also be tied up in cloths, and will then require more 
than an hour's boiling. 

Egg Pudding. 

Mix together thoroughly the yolks of eight, and the 
whites of three eggs, well beaten, half a pint of rich 
cream, half a pound of good brown sugar, a little flour, 
a little grated nutmeg, and a glass of brandy ; melt half 
a pound of butter, add the above to it when nearly cold, 
and put the whole into a dish lined with puff paste ; bake 
in a slow oven for twenty minutes. 

Plain Custard. 

This very agreeable accompaniment to fruit tarts is 
made thus : Boil in a quart of milk, a bit of cinnamon, 



2IO DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

lemon peel, and grated nutmeg; when this is nearly cold, 
strain, and mix with it a tablespoonful of flour, the yolks 
of eight, and the whites of four eggs, well beaten ; boil 
in a buttered basin for half an hour. A better way is to 
add a few ounces of sugar to the mixture, and bake in a 
very slow oven for half an hour. You may flavor with 
bitter almonds instead of lemon, and by using part cream, 
and increasing the number of eggs, enrich the custard. 

Another and Simpler Mode 

is to mix a quart of new milk with eight eggs well 
beaten, strain through a hair sieve, and sweeten to taste ; 
add a quarter of a saltspoonful of salt, and pour the 
custard into a deep dish, with or without a lining or rim 
of paste ; grate cinnamon or nutmeg and lemon-peel 
over the top ; and bake in a very slow oven thirty 
minutes, or even longer, should it not be firm in the 
center. A custard, well made and properly baked, will 
appear quite smooth when cut, and there will be no whey 
at the bottom. 

Custard Pudding. 

Butter and pepper a mold, and put in, broken in 
pieces, the remains of any kind of pudding, such as 
plum, cabinet, or college, fill up with custard, and bake 
for about half an hour. 

College Pudding 

Chop very fine half a pound of beef suet — beef mar- 
row is better — and add to it half a pound of well-cleaned 
currants, four ounces of bread-crumbs, three well-beaten 
eggs, a little nutmeg and salt. Add half a glass of 
brandy, and sufficient milk to reduce the whole to a prop- 
er consistency ; put into small molds or cups, bake for 
about half an hour, and serve with wine sauce {see receipt).

Cabinet Pudding. 

The best way to make this favorite pudding is to 
butter the inside of a round basin or mold, and stick 
about it some dried ciierries, or raisins, then about three 
parts fill the mould with sponge cake, interspersing a 
few ratafias, over which sprinkle a glass of brandy. 
Then have ready the following custard : boil a pint of 
milk, in which infuse the rind of two lemons, cut thin, 
in a basin ; have six whole eggs, which well whisk, with 
a quarter of a pound of powdered loaf sugar, and add 
the milk by degrees ; pass through a strainer and fill up 
the basin or mold, round the edge of which place a 
band of buttered paper ; have a convenient-sized stew- 
pan, with about two inches in depth of boiling water, 
place in your pudding, cover a sheet of paper over, and 
let simmer gently over the fire, keeping the stew-pan 
covered until the pudding becomes quite firm, when 
serve thus : take out, detach the paper, and turn from 
the mold over upon a dish ; have ready the following 
sauce : put half a pint of melted butter into a stew-pan, 
into which stir the yolks of two eggs, and add a glassful 
of brandy, with the juice of a lemon, and sufficient sugar 
to sweeten it ; stir over the fire until it becomes a little 
thick, when pass it through a strainer ; sauce over the 
pudding, and serve. Many persons prefer the sauce 
served separately in a tureen. 

Fig Pudding. 

Chop very fine half a pound of good figs and six 
ounces of beef suet; mix the latter with twelve ounces of 
grated bread crumbs, then add the figs, six ounces of moist 
sugar, and a little nutmeg; bind the whole well with an 
^%%, and add a gill of good milk or cream. Boil in a 
mold for about four hours, and serve with sweet sauce 
{see receipt). 



212 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Ginger Pudding, 

Mix over the fire half a pound of flour and the same 
quantity of butter; pour in gradually a quart of boiling 
milk; when thoroughly amalgamated, put in half a pound 
of shredded preserved ginger, and the yolks of six or 
eight eggs, previously well beaten. Mix well, and let it 
stand; then whisk the whites until very stiff, add them 
lightly, put into a buttered and papered mold, and bake 
in a slow oven for nearly two hours. 



Citron Pudding. 

Line a pie-dish with puff-paste {see receipt), and put 
into it — previously well mixed together — the yolks of 
seven eggs well beaten, a quart of good milk — cream is 
better — two tablespoonfuls of flour, half a pound of pow- 
dered loaf-sugar, a little nutmeg, half a pound or more 
of candied citron peel, sliced very thin and then cut small, 
and a glass of any liqueur or brandy. Bake in a slow 
oven. This pudding is delicious. 



Castle Pudding. 

Take six ounces each of fresh butter, flour, and pow- 
dered loaf-sugar. Let the butter half melt before the 
fire, then beat it into a cream. Then beat the yolks and 
whites of three new-laid eggs separate and then together 
for fully a quarter of an hour. Mix the butter and eggs 
together, add the sugar, and then the flour by degrees; 
flavor with a little grated nutmeg and lemon peel. 
Lightly butter half a dozen cups, divide the mixtvre be- 
tween them, and bake for half an hour in a slow oven; 
turn them out and serve with powdered sugar. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 213 

Jenny Lind's Pudding. 

Take the half of a stale loaf, and grate the crumb ; 
butter a pie-dish well and put in a thick layer of the 
crumbs ; pare and slice ten or twelve apples, and put a 
layer of them and sugar ; then crumbs alternately, until 
the dish is full ; put a bit of butter on the top, and bake 
it in a slow oven. 

Lemon Pudding. 

Take four fine lemons, and boil them in water until 
quite soft, keeping them closely covered the whole 
time, take out the pips, and pound the lemons to a 
paste ; then add half a pound of loaf sugar, finely pow- 
dered, half a pound of fresh butter beaten to a cream, 
and the yolks of six eggs well beaten ; mix these well 
together, and bake it in a tin lined with puff paste ; be- 
fore serving, turn it out, and cover the top with sifted 
lump sugar. 

Orange Pudding. 

Mix well together the yolks of nine and the whites of 
five eggs, six tablespoonfuls of orange marmalade, half 
a pound of powdered lump sugar, and the same weight 
of melted butter ; six tablespoonfuls of grated bread, 
and half a pint of cream ; bake in a dish lined and edged 
with puff paste. Add a little ratafia or brandy when put 
into the dish. 

Marrow Pudding. 

Take the crumb of a French roll, and pour over it 
three pints of boiling milk ; cover closely for an hour; 
then add to it a pound of beef marrow cut into small 
bits, half a pound of raisins stoned, the same quantity 
of currants, well washed and dried, twelve eggs well 
beaten and a little salt, grated nutmeg and lemon peel; 
mix well all these ingredients with the bread and 



214 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

milk, sweeten with brown sugar, and bake tor half an 
hour in a slow oven. The dish may be lined or not 
with puff paste, as approved. A small glass of liqueur 
or brandy may be added when the pudding is well 
mixed. Instead of bread many persons use stale cake; 
and they also substitute candied peel for the raisins. 

Rhubarb Pudding. 

Take some fine sticks of rhubarb ; peel and cut small 
sufficient to weigh about a pound or a pound and a quart- 
er, which put into a clean saucepan with eight or ten 
ounces of sugar, the rind of one lemon, grated, the juice, 
and half a teaspoonful of powdered cinnamon. Place 
the whole on the fire, and stir it occasionally at first, but 
constantly at last, until reduced to a sort of marmalade ; 
take it from the fire, and pass through a hair sieve into a 
basin, mix with it about an ounce or two of fresh butter, 
or cream. Line a pie dish with puff paste ; let it be thin 
at the bottom, but thick on the edge. When the prepara- 
tion is cold, fill the dish with the rhubarb, and bake in a 
moderate oven until the paste is sufficiently done. 

Muffin Pudding. 

Cut into very thin slices six stale muffins, lay them 
in a deep dish, and pour over them half a pint of 
brandy ; soak. Simmer half a pint of cream (or good 
milk), with a stick of cinnamon, the grated peel of a large 
lemon, and four ounces of lump sugar, for ten minutes ; 
then take it off and keep stirring until cold. Mix it by 
degrees with the yolks of eight eggs, well beaten. But- 
ter a plain mold, and line it with the muffins, the crusty 
sides outwards. Fill up the mold with alternate layers 
of dried cherries or other fruit, and the crumb of the muf- 
fin. Flavor the custard with orange-flower water, vanilla, 
lemon, or any other favorite essence, and pour it into the 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 215 

mold. Keep the mold upright by setting it in bran 
until the custard has soaked in. Bake half an hour in a 
moderate oven and serve hot. 

Almond Pudding. 

Reduce to powder, or paste, six ounces of sweet al- 
monds ; take six ounces of powdered white sugar, a tea- 
spoonful of lemon-peel grated, a few drops of essence of 
lemon, and eight eggs, omitting two of the whites. Beat 
up the eggs well, and then mix in the other ingredients, 
beating the whole for a full hour, and always one way ; 
when the oven is ready, oil the dish with salad oil, and 
set the pudding into the oven the minute it is made. This 
pudding must be beaten for fully the time specified. 

Bread and Butter Pudding. 

Lay into the bottom of a mold, or pie-dish, well but- 
tered, some thin slices of a French roll, buttered (many 
persons prefer stale bread), strew over them a layer of 
well washed currants, and so on alternately, until the 
shape is half filled; then add half a pint of currant wine, 
or, if not at hand, brandy or rum; let this stand for about 
an hour, and then pour over it a quart of good milk, in 
which six eggs have been beaten, a little grated nutmeg, 
and sugar: boil or bake in a very slow oven two hours, 
(or until quite done), and serve with wine sauce {see re- 
ceipt). 

Tapioca Pudding. 

Soak three tablespoonfuls of tapioca for an hour in 
warm water; then strain, and mix it with the yolks of 
six, and the whites of three eggs, well beaten, three pints 
of good milk, a little grated nutmeg, lemon peel, and a 
glass of sherry; sweeten to taste; bake in a buttered pie- 
dish lined with puflf-paste {see receipt). 



2i6 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Sago Pudding. 

Take two heaped tablespoonfuls of well-washed sago, 
and boil it in a pint of milk (water will do), with a little 
grated lemon peel, and cinnamon; when rather thick, add 
as much sherry and sugar as necessary; then beat the 
yolks of five, and the whites of two eggs, and mix to- 
gether; pour tiie whole into a pie dish lined with puff- 
paste, and bake about forty minutes. 

Arrowroot Pudding. 

Mix to a smooth paste a heaped tablespoonful of ar- 
rowroot in a little milk. Then boil a quart of milk, pour 
it over the arrowroot, and let it get cool, when add the 
yolks of three eggs, well beaten, three ounces of pow- 
dered loaf sugar, and two ounces of butter, broken into 
small bits; flavor with a little nutmeg or cinnamon. 
When well mixed, turn into a buttered dish lined with 
pufif-paste, and bake for about a quarter of an hour. 

Souffle Rice Pudding. 

Take two ounces of rice, washed and dried; put into 
a stewpan with nearly a pint of milk, an ounce of butter, 
half the rind of a lemon, free from pith, a little salt, and 
a spoonful of powdered sugar; set upon the fire until 
boiling, when draw it away and let simmer very gently 
until the rice is quite tender, when take it from the fire, 
and beat well with a wooden spoon until forming a 
smooth paste; add the yolks of four eggs, mixed well; 
pour the whites of the eggs into a bowl, whisk them until 
very stiff, and mix with the preparation: have ready, but- 
tered lightly, a deep pie-dish, pour in the mixture, and 
about a quarter of an hour before ready to serve, place 
it in a moderate oven, serving the moment you take it 
from the oven. Souffle of ground rice is made the same 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 217 

CIS the above, the rice, however, not requirinc^ so long to 
simmer as when whole. As also are souffles of tapioca, 
semolina, vermicelli, £;c., changing their flavors accord- 
ing to taste, using vanilla, lemon, orange, orange-flower 
water, or a small quantity of any description of liqueur. 
A few currants, or any sort of light preserve or jam, 
may also be mixed Vvith any of the preparations, or laid 
at the bottom of the dish, which greatly improves the 
appearance and flavor of the pudding. 

Boiled Rice Pudding. 

Take half a pound of well-cleaned rice and boil it till 
tender in water, then put into a basin, and stir into it 
four ounces of butter, four ounces of sugar, some nut- 
meg and lemon peel grated, work the whole well to- 
gether, adding a pound of well washed and cleaned cur- 
rants; when the whole is thoroughly mixed, put it into 
a pudding-cloth, and boil for two hours; serve with wine 
sauce {see receipt). 

Ground Rice Pudding. 

Take a quarter of a pound of ground rice and mix it 
in a pint of boiling milk, and let it boil up for several 
minutes, stirring continually; then add a quarter of a 
pound of butter; when nearly cold sweeten it to taste; 
add the yolks of six and the whites of three eggs, well 
beaten, a little orange-flower water, or other flavoring, a 
little grated nutmeg, and a small glass of brandy, or 
liquor; bake in a Dutch oven, or brown with a sala- 
mander. 

Baked Rice Pudding. 

Take a quarter of a pound of well washed rice, and 
let it simmer over a slow fire in a quart of milk, with a 
stick of cinnamon, or a few bitter almonds, till the milk 
10 



2i8 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

begins to thicken; then take it off, and when a little cool 
stir in a good sized piece of butter, a quarter of a pound 
of good brown sugar; the yolks of four eggs, well 
beaten, should be poured over the top, when all the 
other ingredients are well mixed; grate a little nutmeg 
over the top, and bake for twenty minutes in a slow 
oven. 

Plain Eaked Eice Pudding. 

"Wash a quarter of a pound of rice thoroughly and let 
it swell in a quart of hot milk; then add two or three eggs 
well beaten, sugar to taste, and a little nutmeg. Bake 
in a slow oven. A very good rice pudding vatij hQ mSidQ 
without the eggs, by simply placing rice and sugar in 
sufficient milk, and baking gradually in a slow oven. 
The rice will then swell and take up all the milk. Pro- 
portions — a quarter of a pound to a quart or three pints 
of milk. 

Treacle Pudding. 

Take one teaspoonful of molasses, about two ounces 
of minced suet, three tablespoonfuls of Indian meal. 
Scald the meal with boiling water or milk, mix it 
quite thin; when nearly cold, add four eggs well beaten. 
It requires three hours' boiling in a floured cloth. 

Baked Indian Meal Pudding 

is made thus: — Boil a quart of milk, and while boiling, 
stir in seven spoonfuls of Indian meal, mix it quite thin; 
when it is moderately warm, add a tea-cupful of treacle, 
a little grated ginger and salt, four eggs, a lump of but- 
ter the size of an &g§,. Bake in a moderate oven till 
quite firm. 

Rice and Fruit Pudding. 

Take half a pound of well washed and dried rice, put 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 219 

it into a deep dish, just moisten it with milk, and set it 
into a gentle oven; add milk to it at intervals, in small 
quantities, until the grain is swollen to its full size, and 
is tender, but very dry; then mix with it two dessert- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar, and live tablespoonfuls of 
rich cream. Fill a tart-dish almost to the brim with 
fruit properly sugared, heap the rice equally over it, 
leaving it rough, and bake it in a moderate oven for half 
an hour. If the fruit be of a kind to require a longer 
time it must be half stewed Avith the sugar put into the 
dish. 

Fresh Fruit Puddings. 

Use good crust, about half an inch thick, and well 
sweeten the fruit. Stone fruits, such as greengages, 
plums, damsons, peaches, nectarines, apricots, and even 
cherries, are improved by cutting in halves, taking the 
stones, and adding the kernels to the pudding. In any 
case, carefully wipe off the bloom, stalks, &c., and reject 
all the unsound fruit. Currants, raspberries, black- 
berries, gooseberries, &c., must be carefully picked, so 
that no stalks, mold, &c., go into the pudding. Sugar 
must be added to these pies according to taste, and the 
nature of the fruit. A little whipped cream, just flavored 
with cinnamon or vanilla, is an excellent addition. 
They must always be boiled in a basin — tied in a floured 
cloth — and put into boiling water. The time of boiling 
depends entirely upon the size of the pudding and the 
kind of fruit used. 

Boiled Apple Pudding. 

Line a buttered basin with a good crust, slice up 
sufficient apples (peeled and cored) to fill it, adding from 
time to time, sugar, an occasional clove and a shred of 
lemon-peel. When full add nearly a wine-glassful of 
lemon-juice (strained), and cover over with the crust; 
join up well that no water gets in, and tie up tight in a 



2 20 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

floured cloth — previously wrung out of boiling water. 
Put on in a large pan of boiling water; and boil fast and 
continuously for fully two hours. You may boil in a 
cloth without the basin, but it is not so good. 

Anotker Mode 

is to cliop a pound of apples (peeled and cored) very 
fine, add them to half a pound of minced suet, half a 
pound of washed currants, half a pound of grated bread, 
and a few minced almonds. Add six ounces of moist 
sugar, and a little grated nutmeg, bind the v^^hole with 
six yolks and four whites of eggs, mix thoroughly, add 
a glass of brandy, put into a buttered mold, tie over 
with a floured cloth, and boilfor four hours. 

Baked Apple Pudding. 

Pare, core, and cut up small, a dozen large-sized 
apples, put them in a stewpan with just enough water to 
save them from burning; when stewed to a pulp, add three 
ounces of butter, melted, sugar to taste — say a quarter of 
a pound — and three eggs well beaten. Beat tlie whole 
together for a few minutes; strew some fine breadcrumbs 
over the bottom of a well-buttered pie dish, put in the 
apple; cover with more bread crumbs; cut half an ounce 
of butter into little bits and put them about the top; bake 
in a moderate oven for thirty to thirty-five minutes. A 
little lemon peel, or a clove or two, improves the flavor. 

Presh Fruit Pies. 

Do not line the dish with paste, but put a strip round 
the edge of the dish to fasten the cover to. Always use 
good puff-paste {see receipt). Invert a small cup in the 
center of the pic-dish, and heap up the fruit (for remarks 
upon fruit see Fresh Fruit Puddings), use plenty of sugar, 
and, if liked, a little whipped cream, flavored with va- 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 221 

nilla or cinnamon. We are told that a large quantity 
of the free acid which exists in rhubarb, gooseberries, 
currants, and other fruits, may be judiciously corrected 
by the use of a small quantity of carbonate of soda, with- 
out in the least affecting their flavor, so long as too much 
soda is not added. To an ordinary-sized pie or pudding 
as much soda may be added as will cover a shilling, or 
even twice such a quantity if the fruit is very sour. If 
this little hint is attended to, many a stomach-ache will 
be prevented, and sugar saved; because, when the acid is 
neutralized by the soda, it will not require so much sugar 
to render the sour sweet. Some of the most favorite 
pies are red currant and raspberry, gooseberry and rhu- 
barb, apple and rhubarb, currant and cherry, plum, 
greengage, and damson. 

Rhubarb Pie. 

Take some fine rhubarb, strip off the skins, and cut 
the sticks into inch pieces ; fill a large dish with them, 
cover with sugar, and flavor with lemon-juice and peel, 
cinnamon or vanilla. Put this in tiie oven, and when 
considerably shrunk, put into a smaller dish, add more 
sugar and flavoring, if required, cover with a good crust 
and bake for about half an hour. 

Apple Tart. 

Take two dozen fine apples, peel, core, and slice them; 
put the slices into a dish with strips of lemon-peel, a few 
cloves, and a little grated nutmeg or cinnamon ; build 
the apples up in a dome to the center of your dish, 
and cover over with fully half a pound of powdered 
sugar; make a band of paste half an inch in thickness, lay 
it round the rim of the dish ; roll out the cover (puff- 
paste) to the thickness of a quarter of an inch, cover over, 
egg the top over, and place in a moderate oven to bake, 



222 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

which will take abotit an hour ; just before taking from 
the oven, sift a little white sugar over. 

Pumpkin Pie. 

Cut into small thin slices, and fill a pie-dish with, a 
ripe pumpkin (previously skinned, halved, and the seeds 
and fluffy part removed) ; add a salt-spoonful of ground 
pimento, and a table-spoonful of sugar, with a small 
quantity of water. Cover witli paste, and bake in the 
ordinary way. It is much enriched when eaten by ad- 
ding clotted cream and sugar. An equal quantity of 
apples with the pumpkin improves it. 



CETTST FOE PUDDINGS AND PIES. 

Puff-Paste. 

Put one pound of flour upon your pastry slab, make 
a hole in the center, in which put the yolk of one ^^^ 
and the juice of a lemon, with a pinch of salt, mix it with 
cold water (iced in summer, if convenient) into a softish 
flexible paste ; with the right hand dry it off with a little 
flour until you have cleared the paste from the slab, but 
do not work it more than you can possibly help, let re- 
main two minutes upon the slab ; then have a pound of 
fresh butter from which you have squeezed all the butter- 
milk in a cloth, bringing it to the same consistency as 
the paste, upon which place it; press it out with the 
hand, then fold the paste in three so as to hide the butter, 
and roll it witli the rolling-pin to the thickness of a quar- 
ter of an inch, thus making it about two feet in length ; 
fold over one third, over which again pass the rolling- 
pin ; then fold over the other third, thus forming a 
square; place it with the end stop and bottom before you. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 223 

shaking a little flour both under and over, and repeat the 
rolls and turns twice again as before ; flour a baking 
sheet, upon which lay it, upon ice or in some cool place 
(but in summer it would be almost impossible to make 
this paste well without ice) for half an hour, then roll 
twice more, turning it as before, place again upon the 
ice a quarter of an hour, give it two more rolls, making 
seven in all, and it is ready for use when required, roll- 
ing it to whatever thickness, according to what you in- 
tend making. 

Half Puff- Paste. 

This is excellent for all fruit tarts. Eight or ten 
ounces of butter must beallowed to every pound of flour; 
G^^ and lemon juice as above. Three or four times roll- 
ing will suffice. It must stand in a cool place for twenty 
minutes before using. 

Suet Puff-Paste. 

is made exactly as with butter, preparing the suet thus : 
for every pound of flour take a pound of kidney beef 
suet ; chop it very fine, and remove ail skin, &c. Pound 
in a mortar — ^just moisten with butter or oil from time to 
time — until the whole sticks together, and is quite 
smooth and of the consistency of butter. 

Short Paste. 

Rub into a pound of flour eight ounces of butter, and 
about a couple of ounces of fineiy-sifted sugar; take the 
yolks of two good large eggs and beat in about a gill of 
milk; mix these with the flour and butter into a very 
smooth paste; roll this out two or three times, put in a 
cool place for a little while, and it is ready for use. 



224 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Commoa Paste. 

Rub eight ounces of fresh butter well into twenty 
ounces of tiour; make this into a smooth paste with 
water — say one-third to half a pint — roll out twice or 
thrice and use. By adding to the flour two or three 
ounces of finely-powdered sugar (before the water, but 
after the butter), this paste is made very suitable for 
fruit tarts, &c. 

Pudding Crust. 

Chop very fine six ounces of beef suet, and rub well 
into one pound of flour; add graduall}'- sufficient water 
— say half a pint — to make this into a smooth paste, roll 
out twice, and use. Eight or even ten ounces of suet 
may be used for richer crusts. 

Dripping Crust. 

Clarify your dripping (beef is best) by boiling it over 
a slow fire for a few minutes, and skimming carefully; 
then take it up, let it cool a little, and then pass through 
muslin, and put away in jars in a cool place for use. 
Make into a smooth paste one pound of flour and half a 
pint of water; break six ounces of this clarified drip- 
ping into small pieces, and roll out the paste a few times, 
adding the dripping, by putting it on the crust, by de- 
grees. The addition of two or three ounces of sugar 
makes this into a fairly good fruit-pie crust. Dripping 
from roast beef and mutton may be used for ordinary 
crusts without clarifying. Keep each sort of dripping in 
a separate jar. Marmalade pots do very well for this 
purpose; and when the dripping is quite cold and set, 
they may be covered over with paper till needed for use.

PASTKY, JELLIES, CREAMS, &c» 
Vol-au-Vent. 

This is, well done, the triumph of the pastry-cook's 
art. It must, however, be baked in a very hot oven, or 
it will not be strong enougli to stand upright. The best 
plan, therefore, is to obtain the standing puff-crust hot 
from your pastry-cook. Anything may be put into a 
A'ol-au-vent — meat, poultry, game, fish, fruit, or preserve. 
"With your paste-crust ready baked, you can fill it with 
whatever you please. Cover over, and serve either cold 
or hot ; if the latter put the whole into a gentle oven and 
warm up. 

Open Fruit Tarts. 

Line the inside of a shallow tart-dish with puff-paste 
{see receipt), ornament the edges, fill the middle Avith 
any kind of fresh or preserved fruit, jam, marmalade, 
or stewed fruils, or roll out very thin a little of tlie paste, 
and ornament the fruit with paste leaves, piping, &c. 

Strawberry Tartlets, 

Take a pint of fine fresh strawberries, remove the 
stalks, and pass them through a coarse sieve ; add a 
quarter of a pound of powdered and sifted loaf sugar ; 
whisk thorouglily eight fresh eggs, and mix witii the 
sugar and fruit. Then line some patty-pans with fine 
puff-paste, and put in the center of each a little of the 
fruit, leaving space all round for the paste to rise. Bake 
in a brisk oven for about ten minutes. Raspberries, 
blackberries, or red-ripe gooseberries may be treated in 
the same way. 

Sausage Rolls. 

Take delicate young pork in the proportion of two- 
10* 



226 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

thirds lean to one-third fat ; chop very fine, and well 
season with pepper, salt, and spices, add a small quantity 
of sage, or basil, use water in chopping the meat, or a 
little soalced bread. Roll out puff-paste into square 
pieces (four or five inches), lay a roll of meat in the 
center, lengthways ; fold them in two ; join the edges ; 
and wash with Q'g'^;,. Bake in a brisk oven. Sausage 
rolls may also be made in the same manner, with ordi- 
nary Epping sausages — not beef, which are insipid when 
thus served. 

Cheese-Cakes. 

Pass through a fine sieve twelve ounces of cheese 
curd, and mix into a perfectly smooth paste with six 
ounces of fresh butter; add two ounces of almonds (a few 
bitter ones), four ounces of sifted sugar, four eggs (well 
beaten), leaving out two of the whites, three tablespoon- 
fuls of cream, two of brandy, a little mace or nutmeg, and 
if candied peel and currants are liked, two ounces of the 
former and three of the latter. Bake in patty-pans, lined 
with puff -paste, for twenty minutes. Be careful to leave 
a margin of paste all round the mixture. 

Cheese-Cakes 

(another way). Take a pound and a half of powdered 
loaf sugar; add the yolks of nine, and the whites of six 
eggs, well beaten, the juice of four lemons, the rind of two 
grated, and half a pound of fresh butter; put all these in- 
gredients into a saucepan, stirring gently over a slow 
fire, until of the consistence of honey; pour it into small 
jars, and when cold it is fit for use. A little sliced citron 
peel is an improvement. Line your patty-pans with puff- 
paste, put a little of this mixture in the middle of each, 
and bake in a hot oven. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 227 

Lemon Cheese-Cakes. 

Pound in a mortar eight ounces of sweet almonds pre- 
viously blanched; add to them the grated rind of two 
lemons, half a pound of broken lamp sugar, the same 
weight of melted butter when nearly cold, and the yolks 
of eight and the wliites of four eggs well beaten; mix all 
the ingredients well together, and put into patty-pans 
lined with puff-paste. Bake in a moderately hot oven. 



Orange Cheese-Cakes. 

Substitute orange-peel for lemon-peel; proceed as for 
lemon cheese-cakes. 



Almond Cheese-Cakes. 

Blanch and pound in a mortar a pound and a half of 
sweet and twenty bitter almonds, add the yolks of twelve 
and the whites of six eggs, well beaten, a pound and 
a quarter of loaf sugar, in powder, a pound and a half 
of melted butter nearly cold, a nutmeg, grated, and the 
peel of two lemons, grated, two wineglassfuls of orange- 
flower water, and a little brandy. Of course less may 
be made, preserving the proportions. Mix well together 
and bake as before. 

Puffs. 

Roll out rather thin some fine puff-paste {see receipt), 
and cut it into round pieces; put in the center of each 
some raspberry, strawberry, gooseberry, apricot, green- 
gage, plum, damson, or any other jam, orange or lemon 
marmalade, or fresh fruit prepared as for tartlets (which 
see), fold up the sides so as to form a three-cornered 
puff; turn it over, notch the edges with a knife, and 
ice them — by first washing over with the white of an Q^ig 



228 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

that has been whisked to a froth; then dust well with 
finely-powdered loaf sugar, and with a brush just 
sprinkle with clean water, to moisten the sugar. Bake 
in a brisk oven for twelve or fifteen minutes. 

Mince-Pies. 

Line your patty-pans with puff-paste (i-(?^ receipt), put 
a little mince meal {see receipt), into the center of each, 
cover with paste and bake in a very hot oven for a few 
minutes. A little more brandy or sherry should be 
added when the pies are made. 

Apple Fritters. 

Cut the apples (peeled) into rather thick slices, 
breadthwise, and cut out the core; put the slices into a 
batter made of the whites of two eggs, well whisked, six 
ounces of flour, a bit of butter, and sufiicient milk to 
make it rather tliin; wliei;i this is quite smooth, add a 
small pinch of salt. Fry in boiling dripping or lard ; as 
they are done drain them in front of the fire on blotting 
paper, or a sieve; serve very hot, with powdered loaf 
sugar. If the sliced apples are soaked for some hours 
in a little sherry, sugar, and lemon juice the taste and 
aroma are greatly enhanced. 

Currant Fritters. 

Take a tumbler of new milk, make a smooth batter 
with two tablespoonfuls of flour; put to tlie batter four 
eggs, well beaten, three heaped tablespoonfuls of boiled 
rice, sugar and nutmeg to taste, and about two or three 
tablespoonfuls of fine grocers' currants, well washed, 
dried, and picked; mix Vv'ell together, and this should be 
a firm, smooth batter. Divide this quantity into about 
eight or ten fritters; fry for about ten minutes, or less. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 229 

in boiling lard or dripping; drain and serve as for apple 
fritters. Arrowroot, tapioca, or sago may be used in 
place of the rice for variety. 

Apricot Fritters. 

It is better that the frait should not be too ripe. Cut 
in two as many apricots as you may require, and having 
taken out the stones, let them soak for an hour in sherry 
or brandy, with a little sugar and the juice of a lemon; 
drain them, dip them in batter, as for apple fritters (which 
see), and fry to a good color. Before serving, powder 
them well with white sugar. All stone fruit fritters are 
made by this receipt. 

Cream Fritters. 

Take a handful of flour, the yolks of eight and the 
whites of three eggs, well beaten, four macaroons, bruised, 
a little candied lemon or citron peel, cut very fine, half 
a pint of good cream, the same quantity of milk, and 
a large lump of sugar; let the whole boil over a slow 
fire for a quarter of an hour, until the cream has become 
of the consistence of thick paste; cool it on a floured 
dish, dredging flour over; when the paste is quite cool, 
cut it into small pieces, roll them in your hands to a 
round form, and fry of a good color; when served, pow- 
der with fine sugar. 

. Almond Fritters. 

Take a pound of sweet almonds, blanch them; pour 
over them four tablespoonfuls of orange flower-water, 
and in a short time after a pint and a half of cream; let 
them stand for two hours and a lialf, and then pound 
them to a paste; add the yolks of nine eggs, well beaten, 



230 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

a few Naples biscuits, pounded sugar to taste, and mix 
well together; fr)- in butter to a good color; serve with 
powdered sugar over the top. 

Calf's Foot Jelly. 

Take a calf's foot, cut it up small, and put in a stew- 
pan with three pints of cold water; directly it boils up, 
move to the side of the fire; simmer these gently for 
fully five hours, keeping it well skimmed; pass this 
through a fine hair sieve, put in a cold place, and when 
quite firm, carefully take off anything there may be on 
the surface. Have ready a delicately clean stewpan, put 
into it two tablespoonfuls of cold water, the same quan- 
tity of pale sherry, the peel of a lemon, cut very thin, 
the juice of two lemons, the whites and broken shells of 
two large or three small eggs, and eight ounces of pow- 
dered loaf sugar; beat these well together until the 
sugar is quite dissolved, when add the jelly; whisk this 
over the fire until it boils, then pass it twice or thrice 
through a jelly bag, and put aside for use. 

Isinglass Jelly. 

Put a quart of cold water into a pan, add an ounce 
and a half of either isinglass or gelatine, and boil until 
reduced to one pint; pass through a bag as above, sweeten, 
flavor, and color according to taste. 

Many Jellies 

are made from one or other of these stocks. For liqueur 
or punch jelly a wine-glass to the pint will be found fla- 
vor enougii. Any kind of fruit jelly may be made by 
pouring a little jelly into a mold and letting it set, then 
putting a layer of strawberries, slices of peach, nectarine, 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 231 

&c., then more jelly, allow that to set, then more fruit, 
and so on till the mold is full. A mere flavoring — such 
as lemon, vanilla, orange-flower water, &c., is suffKuent 
to make either of these plain jellies very tasty and pretty. 
A few drops of prepared liquid cochineal is nearly all 
that is required for coloring. (For other jellies see " Sick 
Room C(jokcry.") 

Apple Jelly. 

This jelly is beautifully clear, firm, and delicious. Use 
ripe and juicy apples cut into quarters, put in a preserv- 
ing-pan and cover with water, let them simmer till they 
become a pulp, strain through a thick flannel bag all 
night, for each pint of juice add one pound of loaf sugar, 
with essence of lemon to flavor; boil for twenty minutes, 
put into pots and cover down tightly. Should the jelly 
not be firm when cold, reboil. 

Tapioca Jelly. 

Wash well four tablespoonfuls of tapioca, put it in 
sufficient cold water to cover it, and let it soak for four 
or five hours. Set a pint of cold water on the fire — when 
it boils, mash and stir up the tapioca that is in water, and 
mix it with the boiling water. Let the whole simmer 
gently, with a stick of cinnamon or mace. When thick 
and clear, mix a couple of tablespoonfuls of white sugar, 
with half a tablespoonfulof lemon-juice, and half aglass 
of pale sherry; stir it into the jelly; if not sweet enough, 
add more sugar, and turn the jelly into your mold; put 
aside to set; serve with a border of marmalade or jam. 



Orange Jelly. 

Take a dozen fine oranges, and two or three lemons ; 
peel eight oranges very finely, put the rinds into a basin, 



232 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

clarify a pound of loaf sugar, pass through a napkin 
into the basin (over the rind) while hot, and cover close- 
ly ; cut the oranges and lemons in halves, squeeze out 
all the juice through a hair sieve into another basin, and 
proceed to clarify it as follows ; wash well two sheets of 
vrhite blotting-paper in a basin of water, let well drain 
upon a sieve, bruise them in a mortar until forming quite 
a puree, take from the mortar and put into the basin with 
the juice, which mix well with it ; let it remain a quarter 
of an hour to settle, then pour it into your jelly-bag, 
pouring what runs through back again into the bag until 
it becomes as clear as spring water, strain the syrup 
again through a napkin, add the clarified juice, two 
ounces of dissolved isinglass, and a few drops of pre- 
pared liquid cochineal, to give an orange tint ; mix all 
well together, and pour into a mold ; when set and ready 
to serve, turn out by just dipping the mold in warm 
water, wiping quickly with a cloth, shaking the mold 
gently, turning over on a dish, and drawing the mold off 
quite straight. 

Lemon Jelly. 

Proceed precisely as directed for the orange jelly, 
using all lemon juice instead of orange, rather more 
syrup, and omitting the cochineal. A glass of very pale 
sherry or hock^improves this jelly. 

Red or Black Currant Jelly. 

Select fine ripe fruit and take away the stalks, &c. 
Put them in an earthenware jar, which put in a pan of 
boiling water, and in about forty or fifty minutes the 
juice will have been extracted; then strain them through 
a jelly-bag ; when cold add a pound of powdered loaf 
sugar to every pint of juice, mix well ; then boil for 
about thirty minutes, skimming carefully. Put into pots 
for use, covering down quite air-tight. The fruit, if 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 233 

boiled a little more, with some sugar, makes a tolerable 
jam. 

Blancmange. 

Take half an ounce of good isinglass and dissolve in 
a pint of new milk ; strain through muslin ; put it 
again on the fire, with the rind of half a lemon, pared 
very thin, and two ounces of loaf sugar, broken small ; 
let it simmer gently until well-flavored, then take out 
the lemon peel, and stir the milk to the beaten yolks of 
three fresli eggs ; pour the mixture back into the pan, and 
hold it over the fire, keeping it stirred until it begins to 
thicken ; put it into a deep basin, and keep it moved 
with a spoon, until nearly cold ; then pour it into the 
mold, which should have been laid in water. 



Tapioca Blancmange. 

Soak for about an hour in a pint of milk, eight ounces 
of tapioca ; then boil until very tender, sweeten to taste 
with powdered loaf sugar, and pour into a mold. This 
looks best if served with a litllc jam, or preserve, topped 
with Avhipped cream round it, and eaten witli it ; if 
flavored with vanilla, noyeau, lemon, &c., garnishing is 
unnecessary. 

Other Blancmanges 

only differ in flavor and sweetness, the regular propor- 
tion being half an ounce of isinglass and two ounces of 
powdered loaf sugar to every pint of milk. Proceed as 
for lemon blancmange, adding any flavoring preferred. 
Calf s foot jelly blancmajige is made in the proportion of 
six yolks to a pint of jelly. Beat the yolks well and add 
them to the jelly while warm : put the mixture on the 
fire, and beat well till on the point of boiling, then let it 
cool gradually, stirring all the time ; when nearly cold 



234 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

fill the mold. Flavor to taste. The various corn-flours 
make tolerable blancmanges. 



Samson Cheese. 

Take fine ripe fruit, and boil it in water, enough to 
cover it ; strain through a very coarse sieve ; and to each 
pound of pulp add a quarter of a pound (or more, accord- 
ing to taste) of powdered loaf sugar ; boil \antil it begins 
to candy at the sides, when pour it into your molds. 
Many sorts of fruit — especially plums, greengages, 
peaches, nectarines, and cherries — may be treated in the 
same manner. Apples require to be flavored with lemon 
juice and a little noyeau. 

Almond Eocher. 

This delightful sweetmeat is made thus: — Blanch and 
dry seven ounces of sweet and one ounce of bitter al- 
monds; chop them very fine, with four ounces of candied 
lemon and orange peel, and three of citron; then add 
two ounces of flour, three-quarters of a pound of sugar, 
a small teaspoonful of mace and cinnamon mixed, and 
the whites of three large eggs, well beaten; mix well; 
roll into balls of the size of large marbles, and bake on 
wafer-paper twenty minutes in a moderate oven; they 
should be quite crisp, but not too deeply colored. 

Black-cap Apples. 

Peel, divide, and core several large apples, cover with 
powdered loaf sugar, and bake. Mix a wineglass full of 
sherry, the same of water, one clove, a little grated lemon 
peel, and sugar to taste. Boil gently, and strain over 
the apples when in the dish. Black the tops of each 
with a salamander or a hot shovel. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 235 

Cup Custards. 

Put into a clean saucepan a quart of new milk, with 
a small stick of cinnamon, the rind of a lemon, cut very- 
thin, a few bitter almonds, or laurel leaves, and sugar to 
taste, — of course these flavorings are only matters of 
taste; beat the yolks of eight eggs with the whites of 
four, add a little milk, and strain. When the quart of 
milk boils, take it off the fire, and strain it; then stir the 
beaten eggs into it. Return the whole to the saucepan, 
and set it on the fire again, stirring constantly. Let it 
just come to the boiling point; then take off the fire, 
pour into a large jug and continue stirring till nearly 
cold. It should now be quite smooth and have the con- 
sistency of thick cream, and is ready for being poured 
into custard glasses. When the glasses are filled, grate 
a little nutmeg over them. 



Another Method 

is to put into your saucepan sufiicient new milk to fill a 
dozen of your custard glasses; set upon the fire until 
boiling, when add a quarter of a pound of powdered loaf 
sugar, and the rind of two lemons, free from pith; place 
the lid upon the stevvpan, take from the fire, and let it 
stand ten minutes; have ready the yolks of eight eggs, 
well beaten; stir in the milk by degrees, pass through a 
strainer, and fill the cups; have ready upon the fire a 
large flat stewpan, containing water sufficient to cover 
the bottom two inches in depth, and just simmering, stand 
in the cups, and let remain gently simmering until the 
custards are quite firm, when take them out, let them re- 
main until cold, when wash the cups outside, and serve. 
Any kind of flavor may be introduced into the above. 



236 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Coffee Custards 

are made thus: — Mix together half a pint of strong cof- 
fee, made as usual, add half a pint of thin cream or milk 
previously boiled, sweeten to palate, mix with the yolks 
of eggs, pass through a strainer, and proceed precisely as 
directed in the last receipt. 

Stone Cream. 

Take an ornamental dish, and put into it a few maca- 
roons, two or three tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice, a little 
lemon peel, grated, and some jam — apricot, greengage, 
plum, or apple. Boil together a pint of cream, half an 
ounce of isinglass and some sugar; when nearly cold 
pour it on the jam, &c. This should be made a few hours 
before using, to allow the flavor of the jam and lemon- 
juice to permeate the biscuits and cream. 

Dessert Cream. 

Boil a quart of new milk, with grated nutmeg or cin- 
namon, two or three peach leaves, or a few bruised bitter 
almonds, and a sufficient quantity of sugar to sweeten 
it, then straining the cream, and when cold beating up 
with it the yolks of four eggs, and warming the whole 
over the fire until it thickens. This is eaten cold with 
fruit tarts, or wnth any fresh fruits at dessert. If half a 
pint of rich cream be used instead of the whole being of 
milk, it will be improved. 

Creme ''au Liqueur," or "aux Fruits." ' 

Take a pint of fresh cream, sugar to taste — say six 
ounces ; a heaped teaspoonful of powdered gum arable 
(dissolved in a little orange-flower water); a wine-glass 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 237 

of any liqueur, or the same quantity of fresh fruit juice ; 
whip tlie whole into a froth, and serve. Cream is 7vhipped 
with a whisk, and as tlie froth rises it is removed on to a 
clean sieve, and allowed to drain, and so on till all is 
firm froth. Serve either piled on a dish or in glasses. 
These creams should, if possible, be frozen to prevent 
the froth from fallinsf. 



Italian Cream. 

Take a pint of cream, sweeten to taste, boil it with 
the rind of a lemon, cut very thin, and a small stick of 
cinnamon ; strain and mix with it a little dissolved isin- 
glass ; while hot, add to it the yolks of eight eggs well 
beaten, and stir it till quite cold. 

Lemon Cream. 

Sweeten a pint of cream with sugar rubbed over the 
rind of two lemons, and as much more sugar, pounded, 
as may be necessary ; then adding juice of two lemons 
and the grated peel (very fine), whisk well, and serve 
the froth upon sponge biscuits dipped in wine. 

Raspberry Cream. 

Take one quart of cream, and six ounces of raspberry 
jam ; mix well, and rub through a very fine sieve (lawn 
is best), add the strained juice of a lemon, and powdered 
loaf sugar to taste ; whisk to a stiff froth, and serve 
heaped on a dish, in a shape or in glasses. Strawberry^ 
gooseberry, and many other jatns may be used instead of the 
raspberry. 

Solid Cream. 

Take a pint of cream, and mix with it two ounces of 
pounded loaf sugar, the juice of a lemon, and a glass of 



23$ DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

any liqueur, brandy, or rum ; work them well together 
by pouring for some time from one jug to another. 
Serve in glasses. 

Solid Fruit Creams. 

Boil apples, apricots, peaches, or plums in a very 
light syrup of sugar and water, — after coring and peel- 
ing, or stoning — until they are sufficiently soft to press 
the pulp through a sieve ; then sweeten, and beat up 
with the whites of eggs which have been well whiskedy 
and serve on a dish with cream round. 



Colored Creams. 

If it is required to give color to any of these creams, 
put the carmine, annatto, or whatever color it may be in 
a bag, and putting it into boiling water, squeeze out the 
color in the same way as with a blue-bag; filter the 
liquid, and add it to the cream before whisking, until the 
desired tint is obtained. All creams to be eaten cold are 
much improved by being frozen. An immense variety 
of colors and flavors are given in many of the cookery 
books, but the receipts given above will be found amply 
sufficient for all purposes. 

Trifle. 

A very excellent trifle may be made thus : — Take two 
ounces of blanched sweet almonds, and one ounce of 
blanched bitter almonds ; pound them to a smooth paste, 
adding a little rose water ; take two lemons, grate the 
peels, and squeeze the juice into a saucer ; break small 
and mix with the almonds, four small sponge cakes, or 
Naples biscuits, and eight or more macaroons. Lay the 
mixture at the bottom of a glass bowl ; grate a nutmeg 
over this, and throw in the grated peel and strained juice 



DOMESTIC COOKERY, 239 

of the lemons ; to tlie wliole add half a pint of sherry 
mixed with a gill of brandy and half a gill of rum, and 
let the mixture remain until the cakes are dissolved, 
when it may be stirred a little ; to a quart of cream, add 
a quarter of a pound of powdered loaf sugar, and a glass 
of noyeau, and beat with a whisk till it stands alone ; as 
the froth rises, take it off with a spoon, and lay it on a 
sieve, with a large dish under it, to drain ; then take the 
cream that has drained into the dish, and pour it back in- 
to the pan with the rest, beat over again, until it is all 
froth ; this being done, set the cream in a cool place ; 
have now a pint of rich baked custard, cold, and pour it 
into the bowl upon the dissolved cakes, and when the 
cream is cold, put that in also, heaping it high in the cen- 
ter ; a layer of fruit jelly, or preserved fruit, may be put 
in between the custard and the frothed cream. Spirits 
should always be used in trifle, as otherwise the cream 
may turn sour. Stale savoy cake in slices may be used 
for the bottom layer. A layer of any kind of jelly or jam 
may be put between the cake at the bottom. If wanted 
in the evening a trifle should be made in the morning, 
and kept in as cold a place as possible. 

Charlottes. 

Line a plain round mold with any kind of fruit, or 
sweet biscuits, or both, and fill up with creme aux fruits 
{see receipt), if biscuits are used, or creme au h'^ueur {see re- 
ceipt); freeze, and serve. 



CAKES. 



In all cakes lightness is essential, so the eggs used 
should be thoroughly whisked, the sugar finely powdered 
and sifted, the flour, currants, raisins, &c., ^uiU dry, the 



240 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

butter perfectly sweet and good, and beaten with the 
hand to n cream (beef suet beaten to a cream, or clari- 
fied dripping, may be used in the commoner cakes in 
place of butter), the oven hot but not fierce, and every- 
thing used in the making scrupulously and delicately 
clean. To ascertain if a cake be done, stick a clean knife 
into the middle, and when drawn out it should be quite 
bright; if any of the cake adiieres to it, it is not done. 
If the top of a cake is scorching or burning, open the 
oven door for a few minutes, and put a sheet of writing 
paper over the top of the cake. 

Pound Cake. 

Take a pound of fresh butter, and beat it to a cream ; 
work it well with a pound of powdered and sifted sugar, 
till smooth; beat up nine eggs, and add them gradually, 
continuing to beat twenty minutes; mix in lightly one 
pound of flour, put the whole into a hoop covered with 
paper, on a plate, and bake it an hour in a moderate 
oven. Currants, plums, candied peel, or caraway-seeds 
may be added at will. 

Savoy Cake. 

Take twelve fine eggs, their weight in sifted sugar, 
and half their weight in flour; break the eggs, keeping 
the whites and yolks separate; add the yolks to the 
sugar with a little rasped lemon-peel, and beat them 
xip well together; whip the whites of the eggs, add 
them to the flour, and then gradually mix the whole 
together, stirring well with the whisk as you mix ; 
w^hen thoroughly mixed, have ready a cake shape, 
butter it well, put in the ingredients, and bake in a 
moderately hot oven for an hour and a half; when 
done, turn it out gently on a dish. It should be of a 
fine gold color. This cake may be iced {see Icing). 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 241 

Common Lunch Cake. 

Take a pound and a half of butter, beat it to a cream, 
and mix it vviiii three-quarters of dough; add a pound of 
good brown sugar, the same quantity of well-cleaned 
currants, a little nutmeg, and, if liked, a few caraway- 
seeds; beat all well together, and bake in a buttered tin 
for an hour. 

Ordinary Plum Cake. 

Procure from the baker's half a quartern of dough, 
spread it with the hand on a pie-board; cover it with half 
a pound of butter dotted about, strew over it half a 
pound of moist sugar, half a pound of currants, well 
washed and dried, half a pound or a pound of stoned 
raisins, a few cloves, a little mace, and half a nutmeg, 
grated; roll the whole together, and put it into a pan; 
then beat three eggs in a cup of lukewarm milk, and 
pour to the other ingredients, beating the whole together 
with the hand for about three-quarters of an hour; put it 
into a buttered pan, and bake in a moderate oven for an 
hour; when done, turn it out. It should not be cut for 
three or four hours after. This is a very good school 
cake. 

Ordinary Seed Cake. 

Take half a quartern of baker's dough (milk-dough is 
better), cover it with half a pound of butter dotted about, 
strew over half a pound of moist sugar, three-quarters of 
an ounce of caraway seeds; mix into a dough; then add 
three beaten eggs, a few pounded almonds or a glass of 
noyeau, and enough warm milk to make it into a moder- 
ately stiff paste; line a hoop with buttered paper, put in 
the cake, sprinkle over a few bits of citron peel, or a 
dozen caraway comfits, and bake in a hot oven for about 
an hour.

Soda Cake. 

Rub four ounces of butter into a pound of flour, add 
half a pound of currants and half a pound of sugar. 
Dissolve a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda in a teacup- 
ful of warm milk, beat up three eggs, mix with the milk 
and soda; and then mix the whole thoroughly together; 
put into a cake tin or mold, and bake in a moderate 
oven for about an hour and a half. 

Respecting the use of carbonate of soda in cakes or 
pastry, it certainly gives great lightness to them, but it 
must be used cautiously, as it has an injurious effect 
upon many persons, if taken in large quantities. 

Currant Cake. 

A very fine rich cake is make thus: — Take four pounds 
of fresh butter, and beat it with the hand to a cream; then 
add four pounds of good moist sugar and the yolks and 
whites of thirty eggs (beaten separately and afterwards 
together); when these are thoroughly mixed add by de- 
grees four pounds of well dried flour, five pounds of cur- 
rants, washed, dried, and picked (if preferred, take four 
pounds of currants and one pound of stoned raisins); two 
nutmegs, grated; a pound and a half of candied citron 
and lemon peel, and half a pound of ground almonds (if 
not procurable pound the whole almonds in rose-water); 
mix thoroughly for an hour, add a glass of brandy and 
another of liquor, and put it into a buttered cake tin, 
lined with buttered paper; bake in a moderate oven for 
about four hours, and cool gradually. 

Icing. 

This cake is well worth icing, which is done thus: — 
Procure a pound and a half of confectioner's icing sugar 
— or, if not procurable, pound, and sift very finely, that 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 243 

weight of best loaf sugar — add very gradually the well 
beaten whites of eight eggs (tiiese should be a stiff froth); 
then mix in the juice of a lemon; beat this very light, 
white and smooth; put the cake — already baked and still 
hot — in front of the fire, and put tlie icing on with a 
spoon, smooth, and let it set gradually. 



Bride Cakes, Twelfth Cakes, 

and others which require much ornamentation, had better 
be bought of a good pastry-cook. This is the cheapest 
and most satisfactory way. Bride cakes and twelfth 
cakes, indeed, are simply rich currant cakes iced, sugared 
and ornamented. 

Rice Cake. 

Whisk up well six eggs, and add their weight in sugar 
and butter ; and half their weight in ground rice, and 
also in wheaten flour. Any flavoring may be added. 
Citron peel is a great improvement. For mode of mak- 
ing see Madeira Cake. Bake for an hour to an hour and 
a quarter in a moderate oven. 

Madeira Cake. 

Take four or five eggs, and whisk them well for fifteen 
minutes, then, still whisking, add — first, six ounces of 
dry, pounded, and sifted sugar; then six of flour, also 
dried and sifted ; then four ounces of butter just dis- 
solved, but not heated ; the rind of a fresh lemon (grat- 
ed very fine) ; and the instant before the cake is molded, 
beat well in the third of a teaspoonful of carbonate of 
soda ; bake in a ring for an hour in a moderate oven. In 
this, as in all compositions of the same nature, observe 
particularly that the butter must be added gradually, and 
each portion be beaten into the mixture until no appear- 
ance of it remains before the next is added ; and if this 



244 DOMESTIC COOKERY, 

be done, and the preparation be kept light by constant 
and liglit whisl^ing, ilie cake will be as good as if the 
butter were creamed — tiiat is, reduced by the hand to the 
consistency of thick cream ; this is hard work, but it well 
repays for the trouble by the great lightness of the cake. 
Candied citron peel should be added to this cake. 

Sponge Cake. 

Break separately six fine eggs, separate the whites 
from the yolks ; beat the yolks for ten minutes, then add 
to them gradually twelve ounces of very finely powdered 
loaf sugar (confectioner's icing sugar is the best) ; mix 
well together. Meanwhile whisk the whites to a solid 
froth, add this to the yolks and sugar, and when these are 
all well blended stir in about eight ounces of sifted flour. 
Mix well, and flavor with the finely grated rind of a lem- 
on. This cake baked in one mold will take an hour in 
a moderate oven ; sprinkle currants or sliced candied 
peel on the bottom of the mold. If baked iu small tins 
put in a quick oven, and bake to a light color. 

Wine Cakes. 

Beat a pound of butter to a cream, and mix it with a 
pound of .well-dried flour, and a pound of powdered loaf 
sugar; to these add half a pound of well-cleaned cur- 
rants, and a glass of liqueur or brandy; roll out the 
paste to the thickness of half an inch, cut into fancy 
shapes, and bake upon a floured tin. 

Macaroons. 

Pound or chop very finely six ounces of blanched 
almonds, and mix them with half a gill of water, and the 
whisked whites of three eggs. Add six ounces of sugar, 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 245 

and having made the whole into a paste, drop tlie cakes 
witli a spoon on wafer-paper laid on a tin, and a little 
sugar on them. They should be baked in a brisk oven, 
till well brown ; when done, the wafer paper at the bot- 
toms must be left on. For Ratafias add two ounces of 
bitter almonds; make them smaller, and remove the 
wafer paper. 

Gingerbread. 

Mix three pounds of flour with half a pound of but- 
ter, four ounces of brown sugar, and half an ounce of 
pounded ginger. Make these into a paste, with one 
pound and a quarter of warm treacle. 

Spice Gingerbread. 

Take three pounds of flour, one pound of butter, one 
pound of moist sugar, four ounces of candied orange or 
lemon peel, cut small; one ounce of powdered ginger, 
two ounces of powdered allspice, half an ounce of pow- 
dered cinnamon, a handful of caraway seeds, and three 
pounds ot treacle; rub the butter with your hand into 
the flour, then add the other ingredients, and mix it in 
the dough with the treacle; make into cakes or nuts, and 
bake it in a moderate oven. The top should be brushed 
over with white of &^^. 

Shortbread. 

Beat half a pound of butter to a cream, and add to it 
by degrees one pound of flour; then mix with two ounces 
of powdered loaf sugar, a few chopped sweet almonds, 
and, if liked, a few caraway seeds. When this is quite 
smooth halve it, and roll out each cake to about two- 
thirds of an inch thick; pinch up or in some other way 
ornament the edges; prick with a fork in several places, 



246 BOMESTIC COOKER Y. 

and decorate the tops with candied peel in slices; cara- 
way comfits, or a piping of icing. Rake upon paper, in 
a hot oven, for about twenty to twenty-five minutes. 



A Plain Cheap Cake. 

One quartern of rolled dough, half a pound of butter, 
three quarters of a pound of sugar, one pound of cur- 
rants, small teaspoonful mixed spice ; mix well together, 
butter the tin, and bake for two hours. 



Plain Buns, 

Take four pounds of flour, and mix with one pound 
of sifted moist sugar; make a hole in the middle, and 
stir in gradually half a pint of yeast, a pint of warm 
milk, witii tlour to make it as thick as cream ; cover it, 
and let it stand two hours ; then melt to an oil, but not 
hot, one pound of butter, stir this to the other ingredi- 
ents, with warm milk enough to make a soft but dry 
dough, throw over it a little flour, and let the wliole 
stand in a warm place until it rises very light. Take a 
baking dish rubbed over with butter, mold the dough 
into buns, each about the size of an ^%^, lay them in 
rows three or four inches apart, set them in a warm 
place to prove till they have swollen to double their size, 
bake them in a hot oven, and brush them over with milk. 
Caraway seeds, currants, raisins, or finely chopped can- 
died peel, may be added at will. 

Bath Buns. 

Take of flour tv/o pounds ; ale yeast, one pint ; sherry, 
one glass ; add a little orange-flower water, three beaten 
eggs, a little nutmeg, and salt, whatever currants, plums, 
chopped almonds, caraway seeds, or chopped candied- 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 247 

peel, you wish ; and make the whole into a dry dough, 
with warm cream or milk. Let this stand before the fire 
for some time until it has risen well ; then knead in a 
pound of fresh butter ; mold the dough into buns, and 
set them to prove as before directed ; sprinkle a few 
comfits on each, and brush over with beaten white of ^%.Z-, 
dust over with powdered loaf sugar, sprinkle with a little 
water from a brush, and bake in a quick oven on floured 
paper. 

Muffins. 

Mix together for a quarter of an hour two quarts of 
flour, a pint and a half of warm milk and water, a quar- 
ter of a pint of yeast, two ounces of salt, then add a 
quarter of a peck more flour, make the whole into a 
dough ; let it rise one hour, roll up, pull into pieces, 
make them into balls, put into a warm place, shape them 
into muffins, and bake on tins; turn them when half 
done, dip them into warm milk, and bake to a pale 
brown. 

Indian Meal Muffins. 

Take a quart of Indian corn meal, and pour into it 
by degrees sufficient boiling water to make it into a 
thick batter; when cooled a little, add a tablespoonful 
of yeast, two eggs well beaten, and a teaspoonful of salt; 
set in a warm place to rise for two hours; then butter 
square tin pans, two-thirds fill them, and bake in a quick 
oven; when done, serve hot or cut into squares; or bake 
as directed above {see Muffins). 

Crtunpets. 

Mix a quart of new milk to a thin batter with water, 
flour, a little salt, an &^^, and a tablespoonful of good 
yeast, beat well, cover it up, and let it stand in a warm 
place to rise. Clean the muffin plate, while warm over 



248 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

the fire, and rub it Avith a little butter tied up in a piece 
of muslin; pour a cupful of the baiter on the plate in a 
thin ring; as it begins to bake, raise the edge all round 
with a sharp knife. When one side is done, which 
it is ver)' speedily, turn and bake the other. 



Tea Cakes. 

Take one pint of warm milk, or cream, with a teacup- 
ful of yeast, put these into a pan, with flour enough to 
form a. thick batter; add the yolks of three eggs well 
beaten, two ounces of loaf sugar dissolved in some warm 
milk, and a quarter of a pound of butter. When risen 
(say from thirty to sixty minutes), make the dough into 
cakes, put them on tins, and bake them in a quick oven. 
In summer the milk should be lukewarm, in winter 
warmer. 

Ensks. 

Take seven fine eggs and beat tliem up, then mix 
with half a pint of new milk, in which four ounces of 
butter has been melted. Add a gill of yeast, and three 
ounces of sugar; put this gradually into flour to make a 
light batter: let it rise before the fire half an hour; then 
stiffen with more flour. Knead well, divide it into small 
loaves or cakes, and flatten them. These, baked well 
and eaten hot with butter, are capital tea-cakes; but to 
form rusks, allow them to get cold, slice them, and put 
into the oven to crisp. 

There are many other varieties of cakes, but the 
above receipts will be found suflBcient for family re- 
quirements. When a particularly rich or highly orna- 
mented cake, with almond and sugar icings, sugar pip- 
ings and flowers, the best and cheapest way is to go to a 
good pastrjxook, tell him exactly what you want, and 
leave the rest to him.

BISCUITS. 

Plain biscuits are very wholesome food, and enjoy- 
able at almost any time. Now that so many very excel- 
lent machine-made biscuits are sold cheaply in tins, or 
by the pound, it is not necessary to give more than a few 
good receipts. 

Sea-Biscuits. 

will be found very useful to all travelers. Take five 
pounds of wheaten -flour, with the bran in it, half a pound 
of yeast, and just enough tepid water to make it into a 
very stiff dough, this viust be kneaded for a long time, with 
great foree J ihQxi shaped into biscuits, pricked with a fork, 
and baked in a slow oven for about two hours; then set 
to dry in a warm place. 

Sweet Biscuits. 

Make into a stiff paste with two eggs, not beaten, and 
tepid water, a pound of flour, half a pound of butter, and 
half a pound of pounded loaf sugar. Roll out the paste, 
and to form the biscuits, make into round balls, flatten 
them a little; prick with a fork; bake on tins. A few 
caraway seeds may be added. 

Savoy Biscuits. 

Take twelve eggs, their weight in powdered sugar, 
and half their weight of fine flour; beat up the yolks 
with the sugar, adding a little grated lemon peel and 
orange flower water; whip the whites separately into a 
stiff froth, mix with the other; then stir in the flour, and 
beat the whole well together; butter a mold, and put in 
your mixture; bake in a moderately warm oven. 



2SO DOMESTIC COOKERY, 



SAUCES AUD STTJFFmGS 

have become more general of late, and several forms of 
tliese condiments are popular. Taken in moderation, 
the)'' may be considered healthy, but used in excess they 
are decidedly injurious. The base of all the meat sauces 
is the Indian pickle chutney, soy, garlic, sugar, pepper, and 
catsup, in various proportions. 

Sauce Robert. 

Slice four or five onions, and brown them in a stew- 
pan, with three ounces of butter, and a dessertspoonful 
of flour. When of a deep yellow, pour to them half a 
pint of beef or of veal gravy, and let them simmer for 
fifteen minutes; skim, add a seasoning of salt and pepper, 
and, at the moment of serving, mix in a dessertspoonful 
of made mustard. 

Mango Chutney. 

The following receipt is given by a native of India. 
To twenty ounces of moist sugar, in S5'rup, add twelve 
ounces of salt, four ounces of garlic, four ounces of 
onions, one ounce of powdered ginger, four ounces of 
dried chillies, twelve ounces of mustard seed, sixteen 
ounces of stoned raisins, three pints of white wine vin- 
egar, and thirty unripe sour apples peeled, cored, and 
sliced small. Place the whole into a large pan, and stir 
till iTiixed. Boil gently, allow to get cold, and bottle 
for use. 

Another Way, 

Ingredients: — Six pounds of apples or rhubarb, three 
ounces of garlic, half a pound of brown sugar, three 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 251 

ounces of ground ginger, three quarters of a pound of 
raisins, tiiree quarters of a pound of salt, one ounce of 
cayenne pepper, two pints of vinegar. Apples must be 
stewed to a pulp, pick and beat the garlic as fine as pos- 
sible, stone the raisins, and cut in small pieces — mix all 
thoroughly together, boil vinegar, and pour over all, put 
in a large jar, stir well, close at top and let it stand at 
side of the fire for three weeks, stir daily. 

Fish Sauces. 

The base of most fish sauces is Melted Butter^ which is 
easily made by flouring the butter and adding milk, keep- 
ing the whole stirred, one way, in a pipkin over a clear 
fire till it boils. Proportions: — A teaspoonful of flour 
to two ounces cjf butter, a half pint of milk and a pinch 
of salt. Melted butter may also be made with water in- 
stead of milk. Add the roes or milts of mackerel, and 
finely chopped parsley, and a spoonful of soy, and you 
have Mackerel Sauce; — the flesh and soft parts of crabs, 
and you \\^VQ.Crab Sauce. Half a dozen to a dozen fresh, 
bearded oysters, with half a spoonful of anchovy sauce, 
and you have Oyster Sauce; — a handful of shelled shrimps, 
and a teaspoonful of lemon pickle, and you have Shrimp 
Sauce; — a tablespoonful of anchovy paste, or a couple of 
pounded anchovies, and you have Anchovy Sauce; — the 
liquor of a quart of picked and bearded mussels — the 
mussels to be added afterwards, — and you have Mussel 
Sauce; — the pounded flesh of salmon, with a little sherry, 
a few button mushrooms and shallots, and a pinch of 
sugar, and you have Matelote Sauce; — boiled and washed 
onions, strained, and you have Onion Sauce. 

Parsley Sauce. 
Add to melted butter some finely-chopped parsley, 



252 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

previously scalded, giving- it a boil up before serving. 
Eennel Sauce is made in the same way. 

Egg Sauce 

for Salt Fish. Add four hard-boiled eggs, chopped fine, 
to half a pint of boiling melted butter, with a squeeze of 
lemon. 

Tomato Sauce. 

To four or five tomatoes add an onion, two or three 
cloves, a little minced ham, and a mere pinch of thyme. 
When boiled, rub the wiiole through a sieve, add a little 
flour, season with pepper and salt, boil for a few min- 
utes, and serve hot. 



Becliarael Sauce. 

Mince together shallots or small onions, parsley, and 
cloves, put them in a stewpan, with an ounce of butter, a 
little flour, cream, salt and pepper; let the whole boil till 
it thickens, then add a little nutmeg, and serve. Minced 
meat may also be added. 

Sauce for Cold Heats. 

Into a quart of white wine vinegar, eight cloves of 
garlic, twelve shallots, a small clove of ginger, a little 
salt, and the peel of a lemon ; boil together, strain, and 
bottle for use. 

Caper Sauce. 

To melted butter add bruised or chopped capers, with 
a dash of lemon pickle. Heat — taking care that it does 
not boil. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 253 

Bread Sauce. 

Boil crumb of white bread, with a minced onion, and 
some whole white pepper ; when cooked, take out the 
onions, peppercorns, and put the bread, carefully 
crushed through a sieve, into a pipkin with cream, a little 
butter and salt, stirring carefully till it boils. 

Apple Sauce. 

Pare, core and slice apples, boil them in water, with 
a bit of lemon peel, until tender ; strain and roast ; then 
add moist sugar and butter ; heat and serve. Used with 
pork, geese, or ducks. 

Mint Sauce. 

Pick, wash, and chop fine some green spearmint. To 
two tablespoonfuls put eight of vinegar, adding brown 
sugar to taste ; serve cold in a sauce tureen, with lamb or 
mutton. 

White Sauce. 

In a pipkin with a quarter of a pound of butter add a 
dessertspoonful of flour, some salt, and whole pepper ; 
add a little water, mix well together, stir one way, with- 
out allowing it to boil, and serve hot. This may also be 
made without the butter, by adding the yolk of an egg. 

Brandy Sauce and Wine Sauce 

are made by adding brandy or wine and sugar to melted 
butter, without salt. Proportions : Three teaspoonfuls 
of pounded sugar, a wine-glass of wine, or half that 
quantity of brandy, or curacoa. Stir till nearly boil- 
ing and serve in a tureen. Some prefer to serve Brafidy 
Sauce in the dish with the pudding. 



254 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Sweet Sauce for Puddings. 

To half a pint of melted butter, add three teaspoon- 
fuls of pounded white sugar, flavor with grated lemon 
rind, nutmeg, cinnamon, or bitter almonds ground; sim- 
mer and serve hot. Another 

Sweet Sauce 

is made by boiling a pint of milk and stirring into it two 
beaten eggs and four ounces of pounded sugar, in a jar 
placed in a saucepan of water, and stirred till it thickens, 
but not boils. Flavor with nutmeg or cinnamon and 
half a glass of brandy. 

Mushroom and Walnut Sauce 

is made by putting a pint of mushrooms and a pint of 
walnut pickle into a bottle, with a little essence of 
anchovies, set uncorked in a saucepan of water and heat 
to boiling. Then allow to cool, and cork for use. 

Celery Sauce 

for boiled turkeys and poultry generally. Boil until 
tender, in salt and water, four nice heads of celery, cut 
them into small pieces and put them into half a pint of 
melted butter, with a blade of pounded mace, white 
pepper and salt to taste. Simmer, and serve in a tureen. 
This quantity is enough for a fowl ; half as much more 
for a turkey. It may also be made with stock instead of 
melted butter, thickened with a piece of butter rolled in 
flour. 

Forcemeat 

for fish-soups, stews, &c. Beat the flesh and soft parts 
of a lobster, half an anchovy, a piece of boiled celery, 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 255 

the yolk of a hard ^%%, a little cayenne, mace, salt, and 
white pepper, with two tablespooiifuls of bread crumbs, 
one of oyster liquor, two ounces of butter warmed, and 
two eggs well beaten ; make into balls, and fry brown 
in butter. 

Veal Stuffing or Forcemeat. 

Season with pepper, salt, cloves, grated nutmeg, and 
lemon peel, a pound of lean veal, and a quarter of a 
pound of sausage meat ; add mushrooms, mincing the 
whole very fine together. For forcemeat balls, add yolks 
of eggs, and roll in flour. 

Stuffing for Hare. 

The liver scalded, an anchovy or a teaspoonful of 
anchovy paste, a slice of fat bacon, a little suet, parsley, 
thyme, knotted marjoram, a shallot or two, and either 
onion or chives, all chopped fine ; crumbs of bread, 
pepper, and nutmeg ; beat in a mortar with an t^^ well 
beaten. 

Ordinary Stuffing. 

Mix with any potted meat or game an equal propor- 
tion of soaked bread or bread-crumbs, and you will have 
at once a very fine stuffing. Bacon or butter must be 
substituted for suet, when the forcemeat is to be eaten 
cold. 

Sage and Onions. 

This is the ordinary stuffing for goose or roast pork. 
Chop onions very fine, with half the quantity of green 
sage leaves, put into a stewpan with a little water, simmer 
gently for ten minutes, then add pepper and salt, with 
about twice the quantity of fine bread crumbs; mix the 
whole, and pour thereto a quarter of a pint of broth, 



256 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

gravy, or melted butter; stir well together gently, arid 
simmer. The liver of the goose added to the stuffing is 
a great improvement. 



VEGETABLES. 

Potatoes. 

Perhaps the best method of cooking potatoes is to 
boil them with their skins on. Take a dozen or more 
equal-sized potatoes, wash and scrub them until the skins 
are perfectly clean; put them in a saucepan that they 
will half fill, just cover them with cold water, put in a 
good handful of salt, and let them come to the boil, then 
draw the saucepan on one side, and simmer gently until 
they are — on feeling witli a fork— tender; which will be, 
for medium-sized potatoes, about twenty to twenty-five 
minutes after the water boils up; larger potatoes will 
take from thirty to forty minutes. When tender pour 
off the water, and let them stand with the lid off, by the 
side of the fire, for five minutes to dry; then peel and 
serve very hot. Young new potatoes should have their 
skins riibbedo'S. with a coarse cloth, put into boiling water, 
and boiled until tender-say fifteen to twenty-five minutes, 
according to size — pour off the water and let them stand, 
with the lid raised but not removed, until quite dry; 
serve very hot, with a piece of butter in the dish. When 
tlie skins of the young potatoes will not rub off, boil 
them with the skins on, as directed above. 

The best way to steam potatoes is to peel them, throw 
them into salt and water, and when all are peeled, put 
theirr in a steamer over a saucepan of boiling water, and 
let the water boil fast until the potatoes are quite tender 
— which will be in half an hour, more or less, according 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. ^ 257 

to size. To mash potatoes, boil tliem in tiieir skins as 
directed above, and when quite dry peel and mash them 
with a fork until they are smooth and free from lumps, 
then put them into another saucepan with a little butter, 
milk and salt, stir this mixture over the fire until very hot, 
dish lightly, and do w^/ smooth the top, but you may brown 
with a salamander. Be careful of three things in the 
dressing of mashed potatoes: — i, that they are allowed to 
quite dry before peeling; 2, that they are beaten to a per- 
fectly smooth paste; and 3, that when served they are 
light, floury, and not sticky. About the proper propor- 
tion of butter and millc is two ounces of the former and 
a gill of the latter, to every two pound dish of potatoes. 
To fry potatoes, wash and peel them, and cut them into 
rather thin slices, breadthways, or cut into thick slices 
and then into ribbons, and fry to a good color in boiling 
lard or dripping; when crisp — say five minutes — drain 
them on a cloth or blotting-paper before the fire, and 
serve very hot with a little salt. Cold potatoes may be 
fried in this way. To bake potatoes, wash well, and put 
them, witli their jackets on, into a moderate oven, until 
they are tender to the fork; serve in their skins. The 
best way to eat tliese is to rub them out with a napkin. 
To bake potatoes under meat, peel them and sprinkle 
with salt. Potato Rissoles are made by boiling and mash- 
ing, as directed above, mixing with salt, pepper, a little 
minced parsley and onion (wlien liked), rolling into small 
balls, covering with egg and bread crumbs, and frying in 
boiling lard or dripping for about eight or ten minutes. 
Drain on a cloth and serve very hot. Any kind of cold 
meat, ham, or tongue, or lean bacon, may be minced very 
fine and added to the mixture. 

Cabbages. 

Remove the damaged outside leaves, and cut the stalk 
short. If small summer cabbages, make two cuts cross- 



258 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

wise at the stalk end; if larger, halve them, and if very 
large, cut them in quarters. Wash them in strong salt 
and water, and let them remain in it for some little time 
— this destroys insects. Then put them — after draining 
or shaking the cold water out of them — into a large 
saucepan of boiling water, with a handful of salt and a 
teaspoonful of carbonate of soda to every two quarts of 
water. Boil fast, with the lid of the saucepan off, until 
the stalk is tender. Drain in a colander, and serve very 
hot in a dish with a strainer. A large cabbage will take 
thirty to forty minutes, and a small summer cabbage ten 
to fifteen. Great care must be exercised that no water 
is served with any kind of boiled vegetables. 



Sprouts and Young Greens 

are boiled in the same way as cabbage, in a large pan of 
boiling water, and boiled fast till done. 



Green Peas. 

Choose them young and fresh; shell them, wash well 
in cold water, and drain in a colander. Then put them 
into a large saucepan (say half a gallon) of boiling water, 
witli a handful of salt, a small lump of sugar (unless the 
peas are of a sweet kind), and — when the peas are old 
and the water hard — half as much carbonate of soda as 
will lie on a dime; let them boil fast, with the lid of the 
saucepan off, until quite tender, but not smashed. Drain 
in a colander, and serve very hot in a hot vegetable dish, 
with a bit of butter in the middle. Some cooks either 
boil a few sprigs of fresh mint with the peas, or garnish 
with some boiled separately. This is entirely a matter 
of taste. The various modes of stewing with lamb, veal, 
&c., will be found under the head Stewing.

French Beans. 

Prepare by cutting off each end, and the strings 
which go down each side, then slice up thin and lay 
them in salt and water for a little while. Put them on 
in boiling water, Avith a handful of salt and half a tea- 
spoonful of carbonate of soda to two quarts of water, 
and keep them boiling fast, with the lid off, until ten- 
der, say ten to twenty minutes — fast boiling — according 
to size. Drain and serve very hot. When very young 
these beans are not sliced up, but simply have each end 
cut off. 

Scarlet Beans 

are cooked in the same way as French beans. The French 
cooks, after they are boiled as above, dry the beans in a 
stewpan over the fire, and when quite hot, add a spoon- 
ful of gravy, a little butter, lemon juice, pepper and salt; 
shake the whole till the butter is melted, and then serve. 

Broad Beans. 

Shell the beans and put them on in plenty of boiling 
water, with a handful of salt, and boil /a^^ until tender — 
say fifteen to twenty-five minutes, according to size. 
Drain, and serve with a tureen of parsley and butter. If 
the beans are very old take off the skins after boiling. 

Haricot Beans. 

Pour boiling water over your white haricots, and af- 
terwards remove the skins ; put on to boil, in cold water, 
enough to cover them, adding hot water as the former 
evaporates ; when quite tender take out and dry. Roll 
a bit of butter in flour, put into a stewpan with a few 
minced onions ; add a little gravy, pepper and salt. Toss 



26o DOMESTIC COOKERY, 

the beans into this ; move thcni about for five or ten 
minutes over the fire, and serve in a large tureen. 

Cauliflowers. 

Take off the outer leaves, and cut the stalks short ; 
put into strong salt and water for an hour, to draw out 
the insects. Put them into fast boiling water with a 
handful of salt ; leave the saucepan uncovered, and boil 
fast for about fifteen to twenty minutes, skimming the 
water from time to time ; when tender, strain and serve, 
with plain melted butter, a little of which may be poured 
over. Large cauliflowers should be cut in halves, and 
very large ones quartered, before soaking in the salt and 
water, as this vegetable is frequently attacked by insects. 

Spinach. 

Take a pailful of spinach and wash it thoroughly in 
several waters, until quite free from grit ; then put it 
into a large saucepan with a tumbler of cold water, and a 
couple of handfulsof salt, press close together from time 
to time, and when quite tender — say ten or twelve min- 
utes — take it out, drain it, and then press all the water out 
and chop very small ; tlicn put it into a stewpan with 
pepper, a little lemon-juice, and a pat of butter, stir over 
the fire for about five minutes, and serve very hot, with 
sippets of bread. Poached eggs may be served on 
spinach. 

Spanish Onions. 

Take six equal-sized Spanish onions, and put on in 
plenty of boiling water, with the skins on ; boil for an 
hour. Then peel, put into a baking dish with a little 
butter, and bake for a couple of hours in a moderate 
oven. Serve with brown gravy, pepper and salt. They 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 261 

may also be stewed in a pint of gravy — being first peeled: 
simmer very gently until tender — say two to three hours ; 
a large piece of butter will do instead of the gravy, but 
the onions must be moved about now and then, and 
must only just simmer. 

Carrots, Parsnips, and Turnips 

arc all boiled in the same way. Remove the tops, wash, 
scrape, and cut out all bruises, specks, &c. Cut, length- 
wise, into quarters ; put tiiem on in plenty of fast boiling 
water, with a handful of salt. They should boil without 
stopping until quite tender, which time varies greatly 
with the age and size of the vegetables. Turnips are 
quickest done, tiien parsnips, and, longest, carrots — large 
ones being often over two hours boiling. To ifiash tur- 
nips, boil as above, and drain in a colander ; squeeze 
them as dry as you can, and then rub them through a 
colander or sieve; put into a stewpan with a pat of 
butter, a little milk, white pepper, and salt, and stir for 
ten minutes, when serve. 

Tomatoes. 

Take off the stalks and put them in a stewpan with a 
little gravy ; stew gently till tender — say twenty minutes 
to half an hour; thicken with a bit of butter rolled in 
flour, season with salt and Cayenne, boil up and serve. 
They may also be sliced and stewed in butter until ten- 
der — say twenty minutes — when stir in a wineglass of 
vinegar, and serve with any sort of roast meat. Many 
cooks bake them in butter, with a high seasoning of 
pepper and salt. This way they take about thirty to 
forty minutes. 

Trufles. 
Wash some fine truffles thoroughly clean, wrap in 



262 DOMESTIC COOKER Y. 

buttered paper and bake in a hot oven for sixty or seventy 
minutes. Remove the paper and serve. As truffles are 
indigestible they should be eaten sparingly. 

Huslirooms. 

Wipe the mushrooms, cut off the ends of the stalks, 
peel, and broil over a clear fire. On every mushroom 
put a bit of butter and a squeeze of lemon, pepper and 
salt; serve very hot. Button mushrooms may be stewed 
for about half an hour in gravy, with a little cayenne, 
nutmeg, and salt. 

Asparagus 

should be cooked as fresh as possible. Scrape the stems, 
and tie up in bundles — the heads put all the same way — 
of fifteen or twenty heads; then cut them all the same 
length, put them into fast boiling water, with a handful 
of salt; boil quickly for fifteen to twenty minutes, or un- 
til quite tender; dish upon toast and serve with plain 
melted butter. 

Celery 

may be stewed in a little white stock [see receipt), with a 
gill of cream, a thickening of butter and flour, and sea- 
soning to taste. To serve with cheese and eat raw, wash 
clean, take away all unsightly pieces, slice it lengthwise 
if large, and serve in a celery glass, half full of water. 
{See Salad). 

Articliokes. 

Wash in several waters, and boil as directed for cab- 
bages, which see. 

Jerusalem Artichokes. 
Wash and peel; put them on in cold water, with a 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 263 

handful of salt, enough to just cover them; boil gently 
till quite tender — say fifteen to twenty minutes after the 
water boils up; serve very hot, with melted butter. 

Lettuces. 

To serve plain, wash carefully in salt and water, and 
then in plain water, pick off ihe outer leaves, drain in a 
colander, and cut into quarters lengthwise, {See Salad). 

Cucumbers. 

Peel and cut, beginning at the thick end, into very 
thin slices, season with pepper and salt> Dish, and serve 
with salad oil and vinegar, or vinegar only, over. {See 
Salad). 

Horseradish. 

Put the root into weak salt and water for an hour; 
wash thoroughly and scrape very thin with a sharp, stiff 
knife. This is always served with roast beef. A good 
plan is to keep a little scraped and kept in a glass 
bottle with vinegar. 

Salads. 

All fish salads are made precisely as directed for lob- 
ster salad. The best dressing for salad is the yolk of 
hard eggs rubbed up with oil, vinegar, mustard, pepper, 
and salt; some add a little sugar. As few persons agree 
as to which of these ingredients should predominate, it 
would be useless to give instructions for the mixing, the 
best way being to purchase the ready-made salad-dress- 
ing of some good pickle maker. Watercresses are, per- 
haps, the most wholesome vegetable for salads; and then 
the lettuce, from its sedative properties. Celery is gen- 
erally mixed with salad, and where onions are liked, 



264 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

they should always form part of the salad, as they give 
a warmth which is wanting in the other vegetables. To 
those who like the flavor, it is recommended to rub the 
bottom of the salad bowl with a clove of garlic, without, 
however, putting any portion into the salad. 

Tomato Salad. 

Take from four to six tomatoes (according to size), 
let them be fully ripe and fresh, slice them in thin 
rounds, lay them in a glass dish arranged neatly; then 
pour over sufficient vinegar to barely cover them, and 
add a spoonful of salt and a very little pepper; let the 
salad stand about two hours before serving. The above 
is excellent with either cold or hot meat, fish, &c., and is 
a very wholesome and pleasing dish. 



PRUIT. 



In serving a dessert in summer be careful the fruit is 
all freshly gathered, and perfectly ripe. A nice selection 
of fresh fruit, with a little crystallized fruit, a few bon-bons 
and fancy biscuits, preserved ginger, fruit ices, and pow- 
dered loaf sugar is a dessert at once tasteful and com- 
paratively inexpensive. In winter time apples, oranges, 
nuts, almonds, raisins, and dried and crystallized fruits 
must take the place of the fresh. These should be ar- 
ranged with taste, and the ornamental leaves of various 
fruits interspersed. 

Stewed Pears and Pippins. 

All kinds of winter pears form a very good dish, 
simply peeled, cut into slices, and stewed gently with a 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 265 

little sugar, water, cloves, and cinnamon, adding a little 
lemon-juice ; or they may be stewed in white wine with 
similar seasoning ; or be baked in an oven in the same 
way, adding a little port wine to increase the flavor and 
improve the color. The addition of a little fresh lemon- 
peel is an improvement. To stew pippins, and other 
apples, core them, pare thin, and throw into water. For 
every pound of fruit, make a syrup with half a pound of 
refined sugar and a pint of water. Skim well, and put 
in the pippins to stew till clear, then grate some lemon- 
peel over them, and serve cold in the syrup. 

[For all other modes of cooking and preserving, or 
otherwise dressing fruit, see the various receipts under 
Puddings and Pies, Pastry, Jellies, Sickroom Cookery, 
Sauces, Preserving, Confectionery, &c.] 



CURING, PICKLIIfG, PRESERVING. 

Curing and Potting 

are terms applied to the treatment of meat, &c., with salt; 
Pickling to the preparation of fresh fish, vegetables, &c., 
with vinegar, and Preseniing to the modes of treating 
fruit and vegetables with sugar, &c. A Good Pickle for 
pork hams, tongue, or beef is the following: — Put two 
gallons of water, two pounds of brown sugar, two pounds 
of bay-salt, two pounds and a half of common salt, and 
half a pound of saltpeter, in a deep earthen pan, with a 
cover to fit close. Before putting in the meat sprinkle 
it well with coarse sugar, and drain. Pack close, so 
that the pickle may cover. This pickle is not to be 
boiled. A small ham may lie fourteen days, a large 
one three weeks; a tongue twelve days, and beef in pro- 
portion to its size. They will eat well out of the pickle 



266 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

without drying. When they are to be dried, let each 
piece be drained over the pan; and when they cease to 
drop, take a clean sponge and dry thoroughly. Six or 
eight hours will smoke them; a little saw-dust and wet 
straw burnt will do this. If put into a chimney, sew 
them in coarse cloth, and hang them a week. This 
pickle, if skimmed before each pickling, will last for 
years. 

To Cure Pork. 

Bone, and cut into pieces. Rub with saltpeter, and 
then with common salt and bay-salt, mixed. Put a layer 
of common salt at the bottom of tub, cover each piece 
with salt and lay them even one upon another; fill the 
hollow places with salt. As the salt melts on the top, 
strew on more, lay a coarse cloth over the vessel, a board 
over that, and a weight on the board. Cover close, strew 
on more salt, as may be necessary, and the pork will.keep 
good the year round. 

To Cure Bacon. 

Place the meat on a table ; salt, with a little niter 
added, well all over. Some straw is then placed on a 
floor, a flitch laid thereon, with the rind downwards — 
straw laid above this, then another flitch, and so on; above 
the whole is placed a board, and weights above all. In 
three weeks or a month the meat is sufficiently salted 
and is hung up to the kitchen rafters. 

To Cure Hams. 

Rub the legs of pork with salt, and leave them for 
three days to drain ; throw away the brine. For hams 
of from fifteen to eighteen pounds weight, mix together 
two ounces of saltpeter, one pound of coarse sugar, and 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 267 

one pound of salt ; rub with this, lay in deep pans with 
the rind down, and keep for three days well covered ; 
then pour over a pint and a half of vinegar, turn them 
in the brine, and baste with it daily for a month ; drain 
well, rub with bran, and hang for a month high in a 
chimney, or a smoking house, over a wood fire to smoke. 

To Pot Veal. 

Cut a fillet into four pieces ; season with pepper, salt, 
and a little mace ; put the veal into a pot with half a 
pound of butter ; tie a paper over it, and bake three hours. 
Cut off the outsides ; pound the meat in a mortar with 
the fat of the gravy, till of the thickness of paste ; then 
pack close in pots, press down hard, and when cold, 
pour clarified butter over it. It is fit to eat in a month. 
Venison, Ham, Fowls, Pigeons, Poultry, &'c., may be potted 
in the same way. 

Brawn. 

Having cleansed a large pig's head thoroughly, and 
rubbed it with salt, boil it until the bones can be removed; 
season with salt and pepper, and, while lujt, lay the meat 
in a mold. Press it down with a board ;uid heavy weight, 
and let it remain in a cool place for six hours. Then 
boil for about an hour, covering the mold with the 
liquor in which the head was first boiled ; press again 
after this boiling. The flavor is improved by adding in 
layers, when. the mold is filled, some salted and boiled 
tongue in thin slices. The tongue must be peeled. A 
sucking pig may be collared in the same way. 

Meat or Fish Preserved in Sugar. 

Rub the joint or fish (after being opened) with sugar, 
and leave it for a few days to dry. If intended for long 
keeping, dry it after this, taking care to expose new 



268 DOMESl'IC COOKERY. 

surfaces to the air frequently, to prevent moldiness. Fish 
preserved in this manner will be found, when dressed, 
superior to that which has been cured by salt or smoke. 



PICKLING. 

Salmon. 



Split the fish, after it has been scaled and cleaned, and 
divide it into convenient pieces. Lay the pieces in a 
shallow kettle, with as much water as will cover them. 
To three quarts add one pint of vinegar, two or three 
ounces of salt, twelve bay leaves, six blades of mace, and 
a quarter of an ounce of black pepper. When boiled 
enough, drain and put it on a clean cloth; then put more 
salmon into the kettle, and pour the liquor upon it, and 
so on till all is done. After this, if the pickle be not 
well flavored with vinegar and salt, add more, and boil 
quick for three quarters of an hour. When all is cold 
pack the fish in deep pans or tubs, and let there be enough 
pickle to plentifully cover. Preserve it from the air. 

Mackerel. 

Clean and divide large mackerel; cut each side into 
three parts; take pepper, nutmegs, mace, cloves, and salt, 
all finely powdered; mix, and having made a little hole 
in each piece of fish, force the seasoning therein, rub also 
some on the outside; then fry brown in oil, let them stand 
till cold, put into a stone jar and cover with vinegar. If 
to be kept any time, p^our oil on top. 

Mushrooms. 
Clean small button mushrooms, and put them into 



DOMESTIC COOKERY, 269 

cold vinegar, and allow it to come slowly to aboil; drain 
and lay them in a cloth till cold, and then put them into 
fresh vinegar. If very small, they should not be allowed 
to boil, as so strong a heat might destroy them. When 
dried, they maybe put again into the vinegar after it has 
been cooled. A little mace will improve the flavor, but 
no hot pepper should be used. 

Capers. 

Directly they are gathered put the capers into a jar, 
with strong vinegar and salt, leaving two inches of vin- 
egar over the capers, then tie the jar down with a skin; 
and if the capers are kept in a cool place, and a little 
fresh strong vinegar added from time to time, they will 
remain good for four or five years. 

Cabbage. 

Slice into acolander, and sprinkle salt over each layer. 
Drain two days, put into a jar, and cover with boiling 
vinegar, adding a few slices of red beet-root. If spice be 
used, it should be boiled with the vinegar. Hard white 
cabbage may be intermixed wilh the other, or cauliflowers 
cut into branches. Cauliflowers, Brocoli, Beans, Nastur- 
tiumsy Artichokes, Radishes, &=c., may be pickled in the same 
way. 

"Walnuts. 

Take green walnuts before the inner shell is formed 
— which may be known by pricking them with a pin ; if 
it goes through easily, they are young enough to pickle. 
Prick them in several places, to allow them to imbibe 
the salt, and keep them in strong brine for a fortnight, 
making fresh salt and water every three days ; drain and 
put them in a jar, sprinkle with salt, and pour over boil- 



2 70 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

ing vinegar; some shallots, garlic, or onion may be boiled 
in the vinegar if the flavor be not disliked. 

Onions. 

Select young equal-sized onions, peel and steep them 
in strong salt and water for four days, changing the 
water two or three times ; wipe perfectly dry, and put 
them into scalding milk ; when the milk becomes cold, 
drain them, and dry each separately in a cloth ; put into 
jars ; pour over as much white wine vinegar, which has 
been boiled with white pepper, as will cover them ; tie 
over first with vret bladder, and then with leather, and 
keep the jars in a dry place for use. A little powdered 
or crushed ginger may be added. 



PEESEEVma 

Fruit.. 



Burn a match in each bottle, to exhaust the air, then 
place in the fruit, quite dry and sound ; sprinkle pow- 
dered sugar between each layer, put in the cork, and tie 
over ; set the bottles, cork downwards, in a large stew- 
pan of cold water, with hay laid between to prevent 
breaking. Put on the fire, and when the skins of the 
fruit are just cracking, take out, and put away for the 
winter. 

Rhubarl). 

Skin rhubarb and cut into two inch pieces ; take an 
equal weight of sugar ; put sugar in preserving-pan on 
the fire to clari-fy, add a little whole ginger with very 
little water; put in the rhubarb, allow it to simmer for 
three hours, put in jars to cool, then cover up as in jams. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 271 

Damsons. 

The sugar is to be pounded, and dissolved in the 
syrup before being- set on the fire. Green sweetmeats 
will spoil if kept long in the first syrup. Fruit should 
be covered with mutton suet melted, to keep out the 
external air. Wet sweetmeats must be kept in a dry and 
cool place, with paper dipped in brandy laid over. Put 
into a saucepan over the fire, with water to cover the 
fruit. When boiled, strain off the liquor, and add to 
every pound of fruit wiped clean, as much refined sugar. 
Put one-third of the sugar into the liquor, set over the 
fire, and when it simmers put in the damsons. Boil, 
then take off, and cover close for half an hour. Set on 
again, and let simmer while over the fire, after being 
turned. Take out, put them into a basin, strew all the 
sugar that remains on them, and pour the hot liquor 
over. Let stand covered till next day ; boil up once 
more ; then take out and put into pots. Boil the liquor 
till it is a jelly, and when cold, pour it over the fruit. 
All Sorts of Stone Fruit may be preserved in this way. 

Candied Citron, Lemon or Orange Peel. 

Soak the peels in water, which must be frequently 
changed, until the bitterness is extracted ; then drain 
and place them in syrup until they are soft and trans- 
parent ; the strength of the syrup being kept up by 
boiling it occasionally with fresh sugar. When taken 
out they should be drained and placed on a sieve to dry. 

Jams. 

All sorts of stone fruit, currants, &c., may be made 
into jams by the potting method : — Pick the fruit from 
the stalks, and to every pound add one pound of lump 
sugar. Boil the whole half an hour, skim and stir it all 



f 



2 72 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

the time ; put it into pots, tightly covered and fixed witli 
string or gum. In stone fruits, crack kernels, and put 
into the jam when potted. Brown sugar may be used 
for these jams. 

Raspberry and Strawberry Jam. 

Pick the fruit, which must be perfectly fresh, ripe and 
dry. Strew over it an equal weight of lump sugar, and 
half as much of the juice of white (or red) currants. 
Boil the whole over a clear fire for half an hour, skim it 
well, put it into pots or glasses, andlet it stand till next 
day. Cover with white paper dipped in brandy or 
whisky, then cover as above. All jams and jellies should 
be covered with white paper dipped in brandy or whisky. 

Marmalade. 

Take Seville oranges and lump sugar, weight for 
weight, cut the rind very thin, and put it in a preserving 
pan; cover with cold water, and boil till quite soft; 
strain through a sieve, and preserve the water; cut the 
rind into thin chips half, an inch long, mix them with 
the water they were boiled in; then take the spongy 
white off the orange very clean and throw it away. 
Divide the inside of the orange into quarters, and scrape 
the pulp off the fibery part or fine skin of the orange; 
put the latter Avith the seeds, put the pulp with the chips; 
then wash the seeds with a little boiling-water through a 
sieve, which will form a thick jelly, add that to the pulp 
and chips. Put in preserving pan with sugar, boil for 
half an hour, and next day cover down as for jams. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 273 



CONFECTIONERY. 

Compotes. 

Take a pint and a half of cold water and a pound 
of lump sugar; boil them for fifteen minutes, skim- 
ming constantly; then add, while the syrup is boiling, 
any kind of fruit, such as peeled and quartered apples 
or oranges, whole apricots, peaches, damsons, plums, 
greengages, &c. Let the whole simmer very gently 
until the fruit is quite tender, but not broken, when 
take it out carefully, and arrange in an ornamental 
glass dish. Tlien give the syrup a sharp boil for a 
few minutes, skimming off any scum that may rise; 
let the syrup cool, pour over the fruit, and when cold, 
serve, garnished with strips of candied peel, bon-bons, 
&c. This syrup is intended for immediate use only, and 
will not keep long. If apples are used, peel, halve, 
and core them, and give each piece a drop or so of 
lemon-juice; apricots and other stone fruit may be 
halved, the stones removed, and, if liked, the kernels 
boiled in the syrup. Oranges must be carefully peel- 
ed, the white pithy skin removed with a blunt knife 
so as not to injure the inner skin, and divided in their 
natural way into, say, four or five pieces each; a little 
of the peel may be cut thin and boiled in the syrup. Com- 
potes should always be served in glass dishes. Owing 
to the ease with which they are prepared, their whole- 
somencss and tasty appearance, they are permanent 
favorites in all homes. 

Candied Fruits 

are so difficult to prepare properly, owing to the great 
care and experience needed in boiling the sugar to make 
a syrup of proper consistency, that the best and cheapest 
12* 



2 74 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

plan is to buy what you require of a good confectioner, 
A simple and excellent substitute is — 



Iced Fruit. 

Take any fresh fruit — such as strawberries, currants, 
plums, &c., and remove all stalks and bruised fruits. 
Then beat up Uie whites of four eggs and mix with half 
a pint of water. Dip your fruit in this, drain it, and roll 
it well in finely powdered sugar; lay on paper for sev- 
eral hours in a dry place, when the sugar will have crys- 
tallized over the fruit. Serve at dessert. 



Butter Scotch. 

Take a pound of good brown sugar, and put it into 
a delicately clean pan, with four ounces of butter, beaten 
to a cream. Stir constantly over the fire for about twenty 
minutes to half an hour (the way to tell when this is done 
is to drop a little on to a dish, and if this, when cool, does 
not stick to the teeth when bitten it is done); just before 
it is done put in half an ounce of powdered ginger. 
Pour the mixture into a buttered tin or dish, and put 
into a cool place to set. 

Everton Taffy. 

Dissolve in a pan over the fire a pound of powdered 
loaf sugar in a gill of water; beat to a cream four ounces 
of butter, and add it. Then proceed as directed for but- 
ter-scotch, substituting four or five drops of essence of 
lemon for the powdered ginger. 

ConfectioneiT, bejajnd the few simple receipts here 
given, cannot be taught in books — the simplest, best and 
c!:ieapest way is to buy what you want ready made.

SUPPER PARTIES. 

The best and most economical way is to have every- 
thing cold, it can then be laid at your leisure. The quan-

MODE OF SERVING DINNER. 

Dust the table and cover with green baize or the or- 
dinary table cover, then put on the white table cloth, 
which should be perfectly clean, taking care to have the 
right side uppermost, and the middle of the cloth in the 
center of the table The new fashion of "slips" down 
each side of the table, which are removed after the cheese 
— thus leaving a clean white cloth for the dessert — is to 
be recommended. Place the mats in their proper places 
— that is, for the principal dish at the head, if two prin- 
cipal dishes, at the head and bottom; if three, the extra 
one in the middle; tlie made dishes are ranged near the 
center of tlie table, and the vegetables, sauces, &c., be- 
tween tlie center and each end. Fold the napkins and 
place one, with the bread on or in it, to each person. 
Then lay the knives and forks at proper distances, the 
latter to the right and the former to the left hand. In a 
dinner of many dishes lay extra knives and forks for 
each person. Set the carving knives and forks before 
the large mats, outside the other knives, and lying paral- 
lel with them. Then put a salt-cellar at each corner — or 
if the table be large, put four on each side — with a table- 
spoon on each side; the nearest spoon to the carving knife, 
with the handle towards it, and the other the contrary 
way. Lay the gravy spoons by the side of the carving 
knife, and the same way. If there is only to be one soup, 
put the ladle at the head of the table, near the end of the 
carving knife, cross-wise. If only one fish, it will take 
the place of the soup when removed, and the slice should 
be placed accordingly. If two soups and two fish, the 
latter take the places of the former. Put a tablespoon to 
each person, outside the knife, with the handle about an 
inch from the edge of the table. The cruet stands are 
next put on, and then the water bottles, with tiu'ee or 
four tumblers to each, and two plain wine glasses, and 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 279 

one colored one for claret, still hock, &c,, at the right 
hi'.nd of each person, about two or three inches from the 
point of the knife. If the wine decanters are put on the 
table, there should be one near each corner, aUcrnatin::^ 
will) the water bottles. If there are many changes, have 
six l:iigc plates for eacli person, besides pudding and 
cheese plates, togetlier with as many knives and forks, 
plenty of cheese knives, dessert spoons, extra wine- 
glasses, napkins, &c. These may be kept on the side- 
board until required, Don't be afraid of having more 
than are wanted. Set the sideboard in order with the 
glasses needed for the dessert, the cold plates, the dessert 
service, ijowdered sugar, &c. In some houses, the dessert 
itself is placed on the sideboard before serving dinner. 
Underneath the sideboard should be placed a plate bas- 
ket to receive the dirty plates, and a box for the used 
knives, forks, spoons, &c. 

In Serving tne Dinner 

be careful that the plates are very hot, and free from 
dust, &c. Place the principal dishes top and bottom, at 
the proper distances from the edge of tlie table, and with 
the smaller dislies, vegetables, sauces, &c., see that they 
be uniform, i.e., that each dish has a corresponding one 
at the other end or side of the table. This plan is car- 
ried out right through the dinner. The heads of fish, 
hares, rabbits, and sucking pigs should be turned to the 
carver's right hand, and the skewer of an aitch-bone of 
beef towards his left hand. Put the thin part of a quarter 
of lamb from the carver, towards the center of the table, 
the neck end facing the carver's left hand; the same also 
for a leg and shoulder of mutton, and a haunch of ven- 
ison, the shanks being put towards the left hand; hams 
should be placed in the sam^ manner. Turkeys, geese, 
ducks, fowls, pheasants, w odcocks, partridges, and any 
kind of game, are served vv'ith the heads towards the right 



28o DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

hand, for the convenience of carving. Some persons, in- 
deed, prefer having the head of the goose or duck to- 
Avards the left hand, for the greater ease of getting at the 
stuffing. The sirloin of beef should have the bony end 
to the left hand, and the same rule applies to the rump 
end of the saddle or chine of mutton. Dishes which have 
a well for the gravy should be laid so that that end is to 
the right hand of the carver. To remove the first course 
take the knife tray, with a clean cloth in it, and take all 
the forks, spoons, and knives (if any), beginning at the 
bottom, and going from the left hand of the dish regu- 
larly round; then put down the tray, and I'emove the 
dishes in the same martner, putting them into a large tray 
or basket, which must be emptied as quickly as possible 
for the second course. When all the fresh dishes are sent 
up, put them on in the same order as the first, taking care 
to observe the proper places and distances. Clean knives 
and forks iimst be ready for each change. The second 
course being removed as before, place the puddings, tarts, 
jellies, blancmanges, &c., and when these are done, the 
cheese, butter, and salad, the cheese at the the top or bot- 
tom, the butter in the middle, and the salad and cucum- 
ber on each side. After the cheese, remove everything, 
and clear of the fragments of bread, &c., with a crumb- 
brush. Then put round the finger-glasses, when used. 
Finger glasses are rapidly going out of fashion, the more 
usual, tasty and elegant plan being to place a silver or 
plated dish of rosevvater at the head of the table. The 
host dips the corner of his napkin in this, and then the 
dish is passed doAvn the table, each guest following the 
host's example. This answers the purpose of wetting the 
lips and fingers — all that should be done at the table. Where 
" slips " are used, remove them by rolling up. If not, the 
white table cloth should be taken off, and the dessert 
served either on the green baize, or the bare mahogany. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY, 281 

In Putting on the Dessert, 

observe the same general rules as before, and when the 
fruits and other things are placed, set the sugar basin 
and water jug between the top and bottom dishes, next 
place the tumblers between the two side dishes and mid- 
dle one, two to each ; then put the decanters of wine on 
the table. Lay table-spoons to serve the dessert with, 
and a knife for the cake — if one is served ; next put on 
the dessert plates, with the doyleys and two wine-glasses 
to each person. 

General Observations. 

Always have flowers on your dinner table. Let there 
be plenty of light during dinner, but it may be a little sub- 
dued after cloth is removed. Half an hour after the 
dessert is put on the table the ladies retire, and in about 
another half hour the gentlemen follow them to the 
drawing-room, where tea and coffee are served. All the 
knives, plates, glass, &c., should be bright and free from 
dust. Above all things never attempt an elaborate din- 
ner, unless you have the appliances and means of cook- 
ing it thoroughly well, and of serving tastefully and 
properly — with the regular changes of plates, knives, 
forks, &c. ; and remember that good wine is essential to a 
good dinner. 

The head of a dinner table is always occupied by the 
lady of the house, who sits at that end of it, with face to- 
wards the door. In the case of a gentleman (bachelor 
or widower) having a lady housekeeper, the gentleman 
will then sit at the head ; if there is no housekeeper, and 
ladies present, the host may invite a married lady to oc- 
cupy the head of the table. 

Serving Supper. 
In covering the table, the same order should be ob- 



282 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

served as for dinner, except that "slips" are unnecessary. 
Napkins are only required for supper parties •when there 
is any liot meat. Decanters or jugs, with water in them, 
are to be set on the table, with three glasses to each. If 
a cold supper plates may be put round, but if there are 
hot dishes, the plates sliould be served as dinner. The 
decanters of wine are placed on the table, and the dishes 
of meat as well as fruit should be garnished with parsley, 
leaves, flovvers, jelly, candied peel, &c. 

Breakfast, Luncheons, &c., 

should be served on white cloths with taste and simplic- 
ity, the same general rules applying to these meals as to 
dinners. 



BREAD MAKING. 

Household Bread. 

Take ten pounds of flour, and three quarts of soft 
water, about lukewarm, if in summer, and rather warmer 
in winter. Put the water into a large pan, add a table- 
spoonful of salt, and a portion of the flour, stirring well 
until about the consistency of batter. Add rather more 
than half a pint of good yeast, and then more flour, mix- 
ing the whole well. Put the pan, covered with a cloth, 
and witli a little dry flour strewed over the dough, be- 
fore the fire a few minutes. About a third of the flour 
is to be kept back in this first operation, and to be well 
kneaded in when the mixture has risen properly before 
the fire. After the rest of the flour is added, put the 
dough again before the fire, and let it rise for a few min- 
utes, then knead again, and bake in a quick oven, having 
previously made the dough into loaves, and pricked ihe 
surface of the dough with a fork, and placed it agaiu be- 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 283 

fore the fire. The baking in an ordinary oven will re- 
quire about an hour to an hour and a quarter, for a four- 
pound loaf, and fifty minutes for a loaf of three pounds. 
If a heated oven be employed, it must be well heated be- 
fore tlie (haigh is put into it. \i potatoes be mixed with 
the bread in the proportion of an ounce to two ounces 
to a pound, the flavor will be improved. First boil the 
potatoes in their skins as directed (see Vegetables), then 
skinned, when dry, rub well up with milk or water boil- 
ed, and allowed to stand for a few minutes before it is 
used. Then add the mixture- to the disli in which the 
dough is mixed. Rice may also be used. Take a pound 
of rice to ten pounds of wheat flour, boil the rice in a 
quart of water until if has become a complete pulp. 
Strain off the water, and beat the rice well in a mortar 
until it is completely crushed, and is entirely dissolved, 
then add the water in which il was boiled, and a pint of 
milk, and boil the whole together for an hour. Strain 
off the liquid and add it to the dish in which the dough 
is made, suppressing as much water from the process as 
the quantity of liquid obtained from the boiling of the 
rice will supply. The dough must in all cases be 
thoroughly kneaded. If the water be hard, a drachm of 
carbonate of soda may be added to three quarts of water, 
but this is unnecessary when the water is of a soft nature. 
To ascertain the proper heat of the oven, throw a small 
quantity of flour on the floor of the oven; if the flour 
turn black in a short time, without taking fire, it is con- 
sidered of a proper heat. If tliis be not attended to, the 
bread will either be heavy and soddened, or scorched on 
the outside. 

Eolls. 

Take a portion of the dough and mix up wilh a few 
tablespoonfuls of cream in which the whites of two or 
three eggs whipped have been put; knead them care- 
fully, and add a little flour, if they be too moist. The 



284 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

dough for rolls should be taken off when it has risen the 
second time. After taking the dough from the fire the 
second time, it must be kneaded for lialf an hour on a 
board strewed with flour, if intended for loaves, but the 
rolls will not require more than five or six minutes 
kneading. They are then to be baked in a quick oven 
until they are nicely browned. A minute or two before 
they are done, they should be taken out of the oven, and 
a brush dipped in the white of ^^^ be passed over the 
top; then they are to be put in the oven again for one or 
two minutes. 

When there is reason to suspect, either from the ap- 
pearance or the smell of the flour, that it is not good, and 
there is still a necessity for using it, let it be baked for an 
hour in a very slack oven, and add to it, when making 
into dough, about ten grains of fresh carbonate of am- 
monia, carefully powdered, for every pound of flour. 
This will frequently correct any bad properties of the 
flour, and render the bread palatable. 

Milk may be substituted for water in the manufacture 
of bread, but it does not improve the flavor if the flour 
be good 

Brown Bread. 

The best is made of pure wheaten flour coarsely 
ground, but good bread is also made from a mixture of 
wheat, barley, and rye flour, in the proportion of two 
pounds of the first, to one of each of the other, Oat- 
meal may be substituted for the barley flour, or added to 
the barley and rye in the proportion of one-third. When 
making brown bread, use a larger quantity of yeast and 
less water, and knead for an hour. A nutritious brown 
bread is made by the addition of the flour of the haricot 
beans as follows: — two parts of wheaten flour, one of 
rye flour, and one of the bean flour. Generally speak- 
ing, brown bread requires longer baking than that from 
pure wheaten flour. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 285 

French Rolls. 

To about seven pounds of fine flour add the whites of 
four eggs well beaten, and sufficient warm milk to make 
it into a stiff dough ; work it together in the same way 
as for pie-crust, and let it rise before the fire under a 
cloth. As the outside becomes hard by being placed be- 
fore the fire, it should be removed, and the remaining 
dough be well beaten, made into rolls, and set for a few 
minutes before the fire to rise, and then baked in a quick 
oven. 

Barley Bread. 

Take three pounds and a half of barley meal, mix 
well together in a large earthen pan, add yeast and warm 
water, and leave the dough to rise for one hour ; it must 
then be kneaded and well worked together for twenty 
minutes, after wliich, make into one loaf, put it into the 
oven, and let it bake for four hours. The barley should 
be finely ground. 

Indian Corn and Wheat Flour Bread. 

Take a quart of corn meal and a little salt, and one 
quart of boiling water. Wet the meal, let it stand until 
it is blood-warm ; then add two quarts of wheat flour, 
and half a pint of yeast, and let it rise. This quantity 
will make two loaves. Bake one hour and a half in a 
brisk oven. 



HOME-MADE WINES AND DRINKS. 



FmmGS: HOW TO MAKE AND USE THEM. 
For Skerry and all other Wliite Wines 

use the following: — Get an ounce of the best isinglass, 
pull it to pieces, and put into a small tub. Pour on to it 
half a gallon — three quart bottles — of cheap still hock. 
Beat up well together with a whisk for half an hour, 
cover the tub over, and keep it in a moderately Avarm 
place. Repeat the whisking three or four times a day 
for two or three days until the mixture is a thiciv smooth 
jelly-like substance. Then put away in a dry and tightl-y- 
corked ]^r for future use. This will keep good for some 
time if well corked and laid on its sidei'.? that the cork is kept 
wet. The quantity required for a butt is one quart; a 
hogshead, one pint; a quarter cask, half-a-pint; and an 
octave a gill-and-a-half. When the cask is readyto.be 
laid upon the scantling — or what serves for ihe same 
purpose — knock out the bung of the cask, and take out 
about half a gallon of the wine, put this into a large pan, 
and add the finings; whisk well for some time, and then 
put the whole into the cask; stir well round with a stick 
inserted in the bung-hole. Then lay up the cask, and 
fasten it with four wedges. Tap it about an inch to an 
inch and a half from the bottom of the head — always use 
silver-plated taps for wine — and put a spile in close to 
[286] 



WINES AND DRINKS. 287 

the bung-hole. This spile must be left loose for some 
time. In a month or six weeks the wine should be ready 
for bottling or drawing off for use. About a pint siiould 
be first drawn off and then the wine tried. If not bright 
give it more time. Isinglass Jittiiigs for beer are made in 
the same way, with half an ounce to one ounce of isin- 
glass to a quart of " hard " beer. This should be made 
as wanted. It is stronger and cleaner than the doubtful 
mixtures often sold as " finings." 

For Port, Claret, &c., 

the whites of eggs are the most serviceable. Use twelve 
to a pipe, six to a hogshead, four to a quarter cask, and 
two to an octave. Break carefully and discard the yolks 
— this is best done by breaking the shell in the mid- 
dle on the rim of a cup, passing the whole yolk from one 
half shell to the other, until all the white has run into 
the cup. Then put the yolks aside, and so on; mix the 
whites well in a little wine; put into the cask, and pro- 
ceed as for sherry. 



"WINES. 



The whole art of wine-making consists in the proper 
management of the fermentation process. The same 
quantity of fruit — as unripe grapes, gooseberries, cur- 
rants, or rhubarb — will, with sugar and water, produce 
two different kinds of wine, by simply varying the mode 
of fermentation: that is, a dry wine, like sherry, or a 
brisk one like champagne. But none of these fruits will 
produce a wiue of the true champagne flavor, which is 
only to be obtained from the berries, leaves, tops, and 
tendri.'s of a particular kind of grape, principally grown 
in France. The following receipt, however, will do for 
making ten gallons of capital wine, without brandy. 



288 WINES AND DRINKS. 

from unripe grapes, with tops, leaves, and tendrils, or 
from rhubarb, currants, or gooseberries. 

Champagne. i 

Take fifty pounds of rhubarb, or any of the above- 
mentioned fruits, and thirty-seven pounds of good moist 
sugar. Have ready a tub that holds from fifteen to twen- 
ty gallons. Bore a hole near the bottom for a tap. In 
this tub bruise the rhubarb, add four gallons of clear 
cold water; stir well; cover with a blanket and let 
stand for twenty-four hours; then draw off the liquor 
through the tap; add one or two more gallons of water 
to the pulp, let it be well stirred, and then allowed to 
remain an hour or two to settle, then draw off; mix the 
two liquors together and in it dissolve the thirty-seven 
pounds of sugar. Let the tub be made clean, and return 
the liquor to it, cover with a blanket and place in a 
room, the temperature of which is not below 60° Fahr. ; 
here it is to remain for twenty-four, forty-eight or more 
hours, until there is an appearance of fermentation hav- 
ing begun, when it should be drawn off into the ten-gal- 
lon cask, as clear as possible, which cask must be filled 
up to the bung-hoie with cold water; if there is not 
liquor enough, let it lean to one side a little, that it may 
discharge itself; if there is any liquor left in the tub not 
quite fine, pass it through a flannel bag, without squeezing, 
and fill up with that instead of water. As the fermenta- 
tion proceeds and the liquor diminishes, it must be filled 
up daily, to encourage the fermentation, for ten or twelve 
days; it then becomes more moderate, when the bung 
should be put in, and a gimlet-hole made by the side of 
it, fitted with a spile; this spile should be taken out 
every two or three days, according to the state of the 
fermentation, for eight of ten days, to allow some of the 
carbonic acid gas to escape. When this state is passed, 
the cask may be kept full by pouring a little liquor in at 



WINES AND DRINKS. 289 

the vent-hole once a week or ten days, for tliree or four 
weeks. This operation is performed at long intervals of 
a month or more, till the end of December, when on a 
fine fi-osty day it should be racked off from the lees as 
fine as possible; the turbid part pass through a flannel 
bag as before. Make the cask clean, return the liquor 
to it; fine with isinglass as directed; put the bung in 
firmly. Choose a clear dry day in March for bottling it. 
Use champagne bottles, as common wine bottles are not 
strong enough; wire down the corks. Make up the 
liquor to two or three pints over the ten gallons, which 
bottle for the purpose of filling the cask as it is wanted. 

Sherry. 

To obtain a dry wine from these materials keep the 
cask constantly filled up to the bung-hole, daily or every 
other day, as long as any fermentation is perceptible by 
applying the ear near to the hole ; the bung may then be 
put in lightly for a time, before finally fixing it ; it may 
be racked off on a fine day in December, and fined as di- 
rected, and bottled in March. 



Another Receipt for Champagne. 

Take a large tub and put into it, boiling, eight gallons 
of soft distilled water, and fifteen pounds of lump sugar, 
and let stand for two hours, skimming now and then. 
Then dissolve in it an ounce and a quarter of tartaric or 
lemon acid. Before cold add half-a-pint of yeast; ferment. 
Then put into a very clean cask ; and add half a gallon 
of sherry (or a gallon of perry), half a gallon of French 
brandy, and a pint of fresh strawberry juice. Bung tight, 
and keep in a cool dry place for three months ; bottle it, 
and keep two months longer. It is then ready for use. 
There is considerable danger of these bottles bursting. 
13 



290 WINES AND DRINKS. 

Elderberry Wine. 

Take dry, ripe elderberries, pick, bruise, and strain 
them. Let the liquor stand in glazed earthenware ves- 
sels for twelve hours to settle. To every pint of clear 
juice add one pint and a half of water; to every gallon of 
this liquor put three pounds of moist sugar ; set it in a 
kettle over the fire, and when it is ready to boil, clarify 
it with the white of eggs ; boil one hour, and when al- 
most cold, work it with strong ale-yeast, and tun it, 
filling up the vessel from time to time with the same 
liquor, saved on purpose, as it sinks by working. Eight 
or nine gallons is a convenient quantity and it will then 
be ready to fine {see Fining). In a month's time it will 
be fit to bottle, and, after bottling, fit to drink in twelve 
months. Many persons add a little foreign wine or 
brandy to this wine. 

Orange Wine. 

Take eleven gallons of soft water, break into it the 
whites of thirty eggs; boil. Then peel very thin a couple 
of hundred fine ripe oranges, and two or three dozen 
Seville oranges. Pour the water, boiling, upon this, and 
let it stand for twelve hours. Strain; add the juice of 
the oranges, and thirty to thirty-five pounds of sugar. 
Add half a pint of ale-yeast, and let it ferment for four or 
five days. Put into a cask, add a gallon and a half of 
brandy ; bung closely, and in six months it will be per- 
fectly bright and ready to bottle. If not bright, it must 
be fined {see Fining). 

Cowslip Wine. 

Take three gallons of water and six pounds of loaf 
sugar; boil for an hour, and let it cool. Toast a piece 
of bread, and spread both sides of it with yeast, but be- 



WIJS/ES AND DRINKS. 291 

fore you put it into the liquor, add to every gallon one 
ounce of the syrup of citrons. Beat well with the rest, 
and then put in the toast wliile it is warm. Let it 
work for two or three days, and in the meantime put in 
about a peck of bruised cowslip flowers, with three lemons 
sliced, and one pint of white wine to every gallon. Let 
the liquor stand three days, then put it into a clean cask, 
and when fine, bottle off. 



Ginger Wine. 

Boil four gallons of water and seven pounds of sugar, 
half an hour, skimming all the time. When cold, squeeze 
in the juice of two lemons, then boil the peels, with two 
ounces of white ginger, in three pints of water, one hour. 
As soon as this is cold, put it to the rest, and three 
pounds of Malaga raisins. Then close it up, fine {see 
Fining), let it stand two months, and bottle it off. 



CIDER, LEMONADE, &o. 

Cider. 

Take good sound apples, when they are perfectly 
ripe. Lay in heaps, and discard the decayed or over- 
ripe fruit. Bruise the remainder small, and when com- 
pletely mashed, put into a hair bag, and squeeze by de- 
grees. Strain into a cask, in which a sulphur match has 
just been burned, after which, mash the pulp with warm 
water, adding a fourth part to the cider. Warm three 
whites of eggs and a little honey and flour together, put 
into a linen bag, and let it hang by a string in the mid- 
dle of the liquid; then put in a pint of new ale yeast, 
warm and let stand five or six days, after which draw it 



292 WINES AND DRINKS. 

off by a tap from the lees into smaller casks or bottles. 
If the latter, take care to leave the cider an inch below 
the bottom of the corks. In winter keep warm, but in 
summer as cool as possible, thus preserving as nearly as 
possible an equal temperature all the year round. Put 
a dust of white sugar into each bottle. To improve the 
appearance and flavor of a hogshead of cider, it sliould 
be racked from its lees, by means of a tap, into another 
cask, matched as before, and then have added to it this 
liquor : take half an ounce of cochineal, a pound of 
alum, and three pounds of sugar-candy. Bruise in a 
mortar, and infuse in a gallon of brandy for a day or 
two; then mix with the cider, and stop it close for six 
months. Then bottle as before. 

Perry. 

Take fine ripe pears and extract the juice as for cider. 
Then immediately squeeze the pulp through two thick- 
nesses of hair-cloth, into a tub. Let this be put into a 
matched cask, and the bung left out. In a few days the 
perry will be fairly still and clear, and it must then be 
racked from the lees into another cask as for cider. Then 
fine with sherry finings {see Fining). Put in a tap, di- 
rectly fined, and when the liquor is bright — try by draw- 
ing a little into a brightly-polished wine-glass, take into 
a dark place, and hold it before a candle or wax taper: 
if it then appear brilliaiit and without "flies" — i.e., mat- 
ter floating about in the liquor — it is fit to bottle. Put 
into champagne bottles, and let the top of the liquor be 
two inches from the top of the bottle-neck. Cork with 
good, long corks, and wire down. 

In perry and cider there is some danger of the bottles 
bursting. 

Ginger Beer. 

Boil together for an hour two gallons of water (put 



WINES AND DRINKS. 293 

on cold) two ounces of bruised ginger, and two pounds 
of sugar. Skim and pour into a jar with one sliced 
lemon. When nearly cold, put in half a teacupful of 
yeast. After the beer 1ms worked (for two days) strain 
and bottle it for use. Tie the corks down strongly. There 
are many receipts for ginger-beer, but the above will be 
found as good as any. 

Lemonade. 

Dissolve loaf sugar in water, and add strained lemon- 
juice. If wanted for bottling proceed thus: — Having pre- 
pared the lemonade not quite so sweet as it is intended to 
be, make a very thick syrup of sugar; and when nearly 
done stir into it a quantity of carbonate of soda, sufficient 
to give about half a drachm to each bottle; pour out the 
syrup into a plate or dish, previously oiled, and when the 
sugar is nearly cold divide it with a knife into as many 
portions as there are to be bottles of lemonade; roll up 
each portion in writing paper in an elongated form, so 
that it may enter the bottle freely. As this will not dis- 
solve immediately, there will be abundant time to cork 
the bottles without loss of gas. The bottles then, being 
well corked, and tied over, the lemonade may be kept for 
tvi^o or three months. 

Italian Lemonade. 

Take a dozen lemons, pare and press them ; pour the 
juice on the peels, and let it remain all night ; in the 
morning add one pound of loaf sugar, a pint of good 
sherry, and three pints of boiling water. Mix well, add 
a pint of boiling milk, and strain through a jelly-bag till 
clear. It is then fit for use. This will keep for several 
days. 

Barley Lemonade. 
Take four ounces of sugar and half a pint of water ; 



294 WINES AND DRINKS. 

boil together for ten minutes, until it forms a thick syrup; 
then grate the rind of a lemon ; add it. Then put in the 
pulp of two lemons, and let the whole boil for a minute 
or two longer, when add two quarts of barley-water 
(made without sugar or lemon); boil five minutes longer, 
pass through a hair sieve into a jug, cover with paper, 
making a hole in the center to let out the heat. When 
cold it is ready for use. If put cold into a bottle, and well 
corked, it keeps good several days. 



Barley Orangeade 

is made by adding to the above the rind of one and the 
juice of two oranges, and leaving out the rind and the 
juice of one lemon. 

Soda Water. 

Dissolve in a gallon of w^ater one ounce of carbonate 
of soda ; put it into bottles, half a pint to eacli ; having 
the cork ready, drop into each bottle half a drachm of 
tartaric or citric acid or crystals, cork and wire i7mne- 
diately^ and it will be ready to use at any time. 



Gingerade. 

Bruise two ounces of Jamaica ginger-root, and infuse 
it four hours in a pint of boiling water ; strain ; add two 
pounds of loaf sugar ; make hot, skim ; add two ounces 
of citric acid, and cork down for use. 



EefresMng Drink. 

A capital drink for hot weather is : — Take a large 
tumbler of cold water, stir into it two tablespoonfuls of 
oatmeal ; allow it to partially settle, and then drink off.

Yeast. 

The following is an excellent substitute for yeast, 
when the latter cannot be obtained. Boil together for an 
hour sixteen ounces of flour, four ounces of brown sugar, 
a teaspoonful of salt, and two gallons of water. Let this 
get cool, and then put into a stone bottle and cork down. 
Make the day before wanted. 



SYLLABUBS AND JUNKETS. 

Syllabub. 

Take a large bowl, and put into it a pound of pow- 
dered sugar, and pour on it the juice (strained) of four 
lemons; stir well together, and then add one quart of 
port wine, one quart of sherry, and one pint of brandy; 
grate in two nutmegs, place the bowl under the cow, and 
milk it full. In serving, put a portion of the curd into 
each glass, fill up with whey, and pour a little cream on 
the top. Half this quantity may be made. Where the 
milk cannot be obtained from the cow put warm milk 
into a large jug and pour it from a height into the bowl. 

Syllabub with Cider 

is made by mixing together a quart of cider, half a pint 
of pale brandy, loaf sugar, and nutmeg, to taste, adding 
the milk and serving as before. 

Junket. 

Take some warm milk, put into a bowl, and turn with 
rennet; then put over it, without breaking the curd, some 
scalded cream, powdered sugar and cinnamon.

pounded ice. 

Moselle or Champagne Cup. 

To each bottle of still or sparkling Moselle or cham- 
pagne, add one of soda-water, a glass of sherry or brandy, 
a few slices of pine-apple, the peel of half a lemon, cut 
thin, powdered sugar to taste, and some lump or pow- 
dered ice. 

Claret Cup. 

To each bottle of claret add one of soda water, a glass 
of sherry, a small glass of liquor, the peel of a lemon, cut 
thin, and powdered sugar to taste. Add some ice, and 
let it remain half an hour before serving. A few slices 
of raw cucumber, or some sprigs of. green borage maybe 
added.

large tumbler with a good spoonful of powdered sugar. 
Add a liquor glass each of pale brandy and noyeau. 
This should one-third fill the glass. Then fill up with 
pounded ice. Allow it to stand for a few minutes, and 
serve. A very small slice of pine-apple or peach, or a 
little bit of cinnamon may be added. 

Lemonade and Claret. 

To a glass of claret, add sonfe pounded ice, and slices 
of lemon. Stir, and pour in a bottle of effervescing lem- 
onade. A slice of cucumber improves this drink. 

Oxford Swig.

it half a pint of warm ale; add grated nutmeg and 
grated ginger, two glasses of sherry and a quart more 
ale, stir this well, and if not sweet enough add more 
sugar. Cover the bowl and let stand four hours. It is 
then fit for use. Lemon juice, and lump sugar rubbed 
on lemon-peel improve this ; or the lemon-peel itself, 
cut thin, may be used. If wanted effervescing, put into 
a stone bottle, cork tightly, and keep for a few days. 



PTJNCH, &c. 
Milk Punch. 



Steep the rinds of a dozen common-sized lemons for 
two days in two quarts of brandy, make a syrup of a 
pound and a half of sugar, and when nearly ready, add

bottle. 

Tea Punch. 

Make a quart of strong green tea. Make a ;w/^/ punch- 
bowl very hot, and then put into it half a pint of brandy, 
half a pint of rum, lump sugar to taste, and tlie juice of 
a lemon; set these alight, and pour in the tea gradually, 
mixing it from time to time with a ladle; it Avill remain 
burning for some time, aftd is to be poured in that state 
into the glasses; a few lumps of tlie sugar should be 
rubbed over the lemon-peel as before directed. This 
punch, if in a china bowl, will not keep alight long. 

Eum Punch. 

Rub two lemons with sugar as before directed. Put 
the sugar in your bowl, squeeze the lemon-juice on it, 
and add a quart of boiling water; when this is getting 
cool, take a pint of rum and half-a-pint of brandy; stir 
them in; sweeten to taste with capillaire or sugar; strain; 
make quite hot and serve. A few roasted apples or slices 
of lemon are often served with this favorite drink.

Take some lump sugar and rub three lemons until 
the essence of the rinds is extracted; put the sugar into 
a large jug with the peel of two Seville oranges, and two 
lemons, extremely thin, the juice of four Seville oranges 
and of ten lemons, and six glasses of calf's feet jelly, 
warm. Stir well together, pour on two quarts of boiling 
water, cover close, and set near the fire for a quarter of 
an hour; then strom into a punch bowl, sweeten with a 
bottle of cappir xire, made as follows: Boil five pounds 
of lump sugar vvith three pints of water, and one ounce

quently, and continue the boiling until the s)'rup becomes 
thick; then filter through a jelly-bag, add five drops of 
neroli, and when cold, put into bottles for use. Add 
half a pint of sherry, one pint of brandy, one pint of 
rum, and one bottle of orange shrub; stir the punch as 
the spirit is poured in. This is best hot, but may be 
taken cold.

water, a gill of sherry, and loaf or barley sugar to taste. 
Stir well and serve hot. 

Cold Punch. 

Take the thin parings of three oranges and three lem- 
ons, let them steep in a bottle of brandy for two days. 
Then make a syrup with a pound and a half of loaf sugar; 
when this is cold, strain the brandy, and add it, together 
with half a gallon of filtered or distilled water, the 
strained juice of six oranges and six lemons. A little 
sherry may be added. Let this stand, closely corked, for 
a month, then strain and bottle. To be taken cold. 



WINTER DRINKS,

couple of ounces of loaf sugar. 



Noyeau. 

Blanch and pound three ounces of almonds — half 
sweet and half bitter; mix them with a pound of pow- 
dered loaf sugar. Then boil half a pint of new milk, let 
it get cold and then add to the almonds and sugar. Then 
add the rinds of three lemons, thinly cut, one tablespoon- 
ful of honey, and a quart of good gin, or Irish wliisky; 
mix well, and let stand in a jar for a fortnight, shaking 
frequently. Then filter through blotting paper, and bot- 
tle off into small bottles; cork tightly and seal. Any 
bruised plum, apricot or peach kernels may be added. 



Cherry Brandy. 

Take six pounds of red and black cherries — half of 
each — mash; add a quart of brandy, and let it stand for 
twenty-four hours; strain through a bag, sweeten with 
loaf sugar, and add a stick of cinnamon; let it stand 
covered for a month. Then bottle and put a lump of 
sugar into each; or, the cherries may be left whole, and 
put into bottles, and covered with the brandy. It then 
requires to be kept some months before using.

add the orange juice. 



SOCIAL AND SCIENTIFIC FACTS. 



THE PHILOSOPHY OF EATING. 

Dr. Hall's maxims are founded on good sense, long 
observation, and scientific principles He says: — 

"Never sit down to a table with an anxious or dis- 
turbed mind ; better intermit that meal ; eating under 
such circumstances can only prolong and aggravate the 
condition of things. Never sit down to a meal after any 
intense mental effort, for plivsical and mental injury are 
inevitable. Never go to a full table during bodily ex- 
haustion. The wisest thing you can do under such cir- 
cumstances is to take a biscuit and a cup of warm tea, 
either black or green, and no more. In ten minutes you 
will feel a degree of refreshment and liveliness which 
will be pleasantly surprising to you; not of the transient 
kind which a glass of liquf)r affords, but permanent; for 
the tea gives prompt stimulus, and a little strength, and 
before it subsides nutriment begins to be drawn from 
the sugar, cream and biscuit, thus allowing the body 
gradually, and by safe degrees, to regain its usual vigor. 
Then, in a couple of hours, you may take a full meal, 
provided it does not bring it later than two hours before 
sundown. It is a fact of no unusual observation among 
intelligent physicians, that eating heartily under bodily 
exhaustion is not unfrequcntly tlie cause of alarming 
and painful illness, and sometimes sudden death. These 
[303] 



304 SOCIAL AND 

things being so, let every family make it a point to 
assemble around the family board with kindly feelings, 
with a cheerful humor, and a courteous spirit. Eat in 
thankful gladness." 



WATEE DRINKING. 

There is no habit which is so disposed to grow upon 
one as that of drinking. Even water-drinking, apparent- 
ly so harmless, becomes, with some people, a most per- 
nicious habit ; the}^ are regularly in the habit of drink- 
ing many glasses of water daily between meals. This 
habit is an injurious one ; it greatly weakens the digest- 
ive power. Unfortunately, however, Avater-drinking is 
far less frequently a habit than beer-drinking, which, in 
quantities very far short of intoxication, is much more 
injurious. By water-drinking we dilute our tissues ; by 
beer-drinking we contaminate tliem. It is a matter of no 
small importance to those who drink water tliat they 
should be able to obtain it as pure as possible. It is a 
mistake to suppose tliat water is necessarily pure because 
it is bright and sparkling. Water of this description is 
naturally much more attractive than that which is opaque 
or muddy ; but tlie analytical chemist tells us that in the 
most brilliant water there sometimes lurks the most 
deadly poison, and that a sudden rise in the temperature 
may develop this poison into activity, and so spread 
death and disease throughout a whole district. This is 
easily accounted for, because in most cases the brilliancy 
and sparkling character of water is owing to the large 
quantity of carbonic acid gas w^hich it contains ; and al- 
though this in itself is by no means injurious, yet it gives 
to water the power of dissolving matters of an organic 
nature. Avhich are the real cause of its unwholesomeness. 
There are other gases capable of being absorbed or dis- 



SCIENTIFIC FACTS. 305 

solved by water, which produce a similar effect, and the 
combinations whicla result from them are all more or less 
injurious under certain conditions of temperature, the 
water all the time, perhaps, remaining beautifully clear 
and bright. It is, therefore, to the removal of this class 
of impurities that the attention of the water drinker 
should be inore particularly directed. The remedy con- 
sists in the filtration of all water used for drinking or 
cooking. Now, until very recently, it was supposed that 
so long as the visible impurities of water were removed 
by a filter, its action was perfect, and nothing more was 
expected from it. Tliis, however, is not all that is re- 
quired ; we want a filter which will deprive it, not only 
of its visible impurities (this is merely straining it), but 
also of those unseen and far more dangerous matters 
which impart so much unwholesomeness toour drinking 
water. This the old-fashioned filters will not do — they 
are mere combinations of sponge, sand, and gravel, with 
sometimes a little wood-charcoal ; and although they 
may strain water and render it tolerably bright, they do 
not exercise any chemical action on it. The newer and 
better class of filters have animal charcoal for the filter- 
ing medium. The best plan is to buy of a good maker. 



THE POCKET FLASK. 

All travelers know the great value of a pocket flask, 
and therefore the following excellent mixture with which 
to fill it will be acceptable: — Melt or dissolve by a gentle 
heat one ounce of black currant jelly in half-a-pint of 
syrup; when cold, add the same quantity of rum, which 
is preferable to any other spirit, as it increases the respi- 
ration, so essential to all sportsmen. This should be pre- 
pared in the summer — as follows: — Pick fine dry black 
currants, put them into a stone jar, and then the jar in 



3o6 SOCIAL AND 

a. saucepan of boiling water till tbe juice is extracted; 
strain, and to every pint ackl half a pound of loaf sugar; 
give one boil, and skim well; when cold, add the same 
quantit}' of rum, shake well and bottle. 



THE RIND OF ALL FRUIT IS INDIGESTIBLE, 

and so is the pellicle or skin of kernels and nuts of all 
kinds. The edible part of fruit is particularly delicate, 
and liable to rapid decomposition if exposed to the 
atmosphere; it is therefore a provision of Nature to 
place a strong and impervious coating over it, as a pro- 
tection against accident, and to prevent insect enemies 
from destroying the seed within. The skin of all the 
plum tribe is wonderfully strong, compared with its 
substance, and resists the action of water and many 
solvents in a remarkable manner. If not thoroughly 
masticated before taken into tlie stomach, the rind of 
plums is rarely, if ever, dissolved by the gastric juice. 
In some cases, pieces of it adhere to the coats of the 
stomach, causing sickness and other inconvenience. 
Dried raisins and currants are particularly included in 
these remarks, showing the best reasons for placing 
the fruit upon the chopping-board with the suet in 
making a pudding of them, for if a dried currant 
passes into the stomach whole, it is never digested at 
all. When horses eat oats or beans that have not been 
through a crushing-mill, much of this food is swal- 
lowed whole, and in this state, being perfectly indi- 
gestible, the husk or pellicle resisting the power of 
the stomach, there is so much loss to nutrition. Birds, 
being destitute of teeth, are provided with the appara- 
tus for grinding their seed, namely with the gizzard, 
through which the seed passes, and is crushed prior 
to digestion. The peels of apples and pears should 



SCIENTIFIC FACTS. 307 

ahva5's be cast awny. Oranges wc need not mention, 
as this is always done. (Orleans, grcens^ages, damsons, 
and all oilier plums, should be carefully skinned if 
eaten raw; and if put into tarts, tliey should be crushed 
before cooking. Nuts are as indigestible as we could 
desij-e, if the brown skin be not removed or blanched, 
as almonds ai^e generally treated. 



SLEEP AT WILL. 

On every hand we hear complaints such as " I lay 
awake for hours,'' &c., &c., and any means natural or arti- 
ficial — of procuring sleep — in other words, falling to 
sleep at will — is certainly worth a trial. Dr. Binn, the 
author of the "Anatomy of Sleep," thus describes his proc- 
ess: — " I turn my eyeballs as far to the right or left, or 
upwards or downwards, as I can without pain, then com- 
mence rolling them slowly with that divergence from a 
direct line of vision around in their sockets, and continue 
doing this till I fall asleep, which occurs generally within 
three minutes, and always within five at most. The im- 
mediate effect of this procedure differs from that of any 
other of which I have heard to procure sleep. It not 
merely diverts thought into a new channel, but actually 
suspends it. I have endeavored innumerable times, while 
thus rolling my eyes, to think upon a particular subject, 
and even upon that which before kept me awake, but I 
could not. As long as they were moving around, my 
mind was a blank. If any one doubts this, let him try 
the experiment for himself. Let him pause just here and 
make it. I venture to assure him that if he makes it in 
good faith, in the manner described, the promise of *a 
penny for his thoughts,' or for each of them, while the 
operation is in progress, will add very little to his w^ealth." 



3o8 SOCIAL AND 



THE HUMAN EODY. 

Pope truly said " the proper study of mankind is man;" 
but just as marvels by familiarity ceases to seem marvel- 
ous, so by its being constantly before our eyes, we over- 
look that wonder of wonders, t]:ie human body. In the 
human skeleton, about the time of maturity, there are 165 
bones. The muscles are about 500 in number. The 
length of the alimentary canal is about 32 feet. The 
amount of blood in an adult ax'erages 30 pounds, or full 
one-fifth of the entire weight. The heart is 6 in. in length, 
and 4 in. in diameter, and beats 70 times per minute, 4,200 
times per hour, 100,800 per day, 36,772,000 per year, 2,565,- 
440,000 in three score and ten, and at each beat 2% ounces 
of blood are thrown out of it, 175 ounces per minute, 656 
pounds per hour, 7 and 3-4ths tons per day. AH the 
blood in the body passes through the heart in 3 minutes. 
This little organ, by its ceaseless industry during life, 
lifts the enormous weight of 370,700,200 tons. The lungs 
will contain about i gallon of air at their usual degree 
of inflation. We breathe on an average 1,200 times per 
hour, inhale 600 gallons of air, or 24,000 gallons per day. 
The aggregate surface of the air cells of the lungs ex- 
ceeds 20,000 square inches, an area very nearly equal to 
the floor of a room 12 ft. square. The average weight 
of the brain of an adult male is 3 pounds and 8 ounces, 
of a female 2 pounds and 4 ounces. The nerves are all 
connected with it, directly or by the spinal marrow. 
These nerves, together with their branches and minute 
ramifications, probably exceed 10,000,000 in number, 
forming a " body guard " outnumbering by far the great- 
est army ever marshaled ! The average area of the skin 
in an adult is estimated to be 2,000 square inches. The 
atmospheric pressure being about 15 lbs, to the square 
inch, a person of medium size is subjected to a pressure 
of 40,000 lbs. Each square inch of skin contains 3,500

be likened to a little drain-tile T-4tli of an inch long-, 
make an aggregate length of the entire surface of the 
body of 201,166 ft., or a tile-ditch for draining the body 
almost 40 miles long! 



THE TEETH OF MAN AND OF INFERIOR ANIMALS. 

Vegetarians will do well to study the teeth of man, 
and they will find there the distinct refutation of their 
arguments. No naturalist who has examined the teeth 
of man, and compared their structure with those of the 
lower animals, but must be of the opinion that those who 
restrict themselves to a vegetable diet, are not acting in 
accordance with the dictates of nature. The teeth of man, 
partaking as they do, in a nearly equal degree, of the prop- 
erty of the herbivorous and carnivorous animals, show that 
he has been destined to be nourished by both descriptions 
of food. We do not require to refer to what would be 
sufficient evidence of the propriety of using this kind of 
aliment, viz., the natural instinct of man to seek it, or to 
the superiority in energy and stamina seen in those 
races of mankind who freely use it, compared with 
those who, from circumstances or superstitious observ- 
ance, do not partake of animal food. The form and 
structure of tlie teetli alone afford the most conclusive 
proof that man was intended to derive his food in nearly 
equal degrees from the animal and vegetable kingdoms. 
They will best preserve their constitutions in unimpaired 
vigor, therefore, who do not confine themselves exclu- 
sively to the use of either. 



310 SOCIAL AND 



YEAELY FOOD OF OKE MA:^. 

From tbe army and navy diet scales, based upon the 
recognized necessities of large numbers of men in active 
life, it is inferred that about two and one-fourth pounds 
avoirdupois of dry food, per day, are required for each 
individual; of this about three-fourths are vegetable, and 
the rest animal. At the close of an entire year, the 
amount is upwards of eight hundred pounds. Enumer- 
ating under the title of water all the various drinks, its 
estimated quantity is about fifteen hundred pounds per 
annum. The air received by breathing may be taken at 
eight hundred pounds. With these figures before us, we 
are able to see how the case stands. The food, water, 
and air which a man receives, amount, in the aggregate, 
to more than three thousand pounds a year — about a ton 
and a half, or twenty times his weight. Tliis fact shows 
the gigantic expenditure of material required for life, 
and proves better than words the changes which are 
hourly caused by every living being. 



AGE OF AITIMALS. 

A bear rarely exceeds 20 years; a dog lives 20 years; 
a wolf 20 years; a fox 14 or 16 years; lions are long-lived. 
Pompey lived to the age of 70. The average of cats is 
15 years; a squirrel and hare 7 or 8 years; rabbits 7. 
Elephants have been known to live to the great age of 400 
years When Alexander the Great had conquered one 
Phorus, King of India, he took a great elephant which 
had fouglit very valiantly for the king, named him Ajax, 
and dedicated him to the sun, and let him go with this 
inscription — " Alexander, the son of Jupiter, hath dedi- 
cated Ajax to the sun." This elephant was found with 



SCIENTIFIC FACTS, 31 x 

this inscription 350 years after. Pigs have been known 
to live to the age of thirty years; the rhinoceros to 20. 
A horse has been known to live to tlie age of 62, but 
averages 25 to 30. Camels sometimes live to the age of 
100. Stags are long-lived. Sheep seldom exceed the 
age of 10. Cows live about 15 years. Cuvier considers 
it probable that whales sometimes live to the age of 
1,000. The dolphin and porpoise attain the age of 30. 
An eagle died in Vienna at the age of 104 years. Ravens 
frequently reach the age of 100. Swans have been known 
to live 360 years. Pelicans are long-lived. A tortoise 
has been known to live to the age of 107.

HOW TO KEEP HOUSES COOL IN HOT WEATHER. 

If the air outside a room or house be cooler than the 
air inside, let it in by all means; but if it be hotter, care- 
fully keep it out. A staircase-window left open during 
the night will often cool the passages of a house, and the 
rooms, too, if their doors be not shut; but it must be closed 
at eight or nine o'clock in the morning, or, if on the 
sunny side, at four or five o'clock, and the blind drawn 
down. The mistake people generally make is to throw 



3X2 SOCIAL AND 

open their windows at all hours of the day, no ms-tter 
whether the atmosphere outside be cool or scorcliing. 
"Let us have some air," they say, and in comes the 
treacherous breeze — for even hot air is pleasant while it 
is gently blowing, taking away perspiration, and thereby 
cooling the skin; but the apartment is made warmer, in- 
stead of cooler, and as soon as they move out of the 
draft, they find their room to be more uncomfortable 
than before. Let in cool air, keep out hot; that is the 
only formula to insure the minimum of discomfort. Sit- 
ting-rooms may generally be kept cool during the whole 
day, if the doors be only opened for ingress and egress, 
and the windows be kept closed and shielded from direct 
sunshine by a blind. If the atmosphere of a room be im- 
pure from any cause, let it be renewed; hot air is less 
injurious than bad air; if a room be small in comparison 
with the number of persons engaged in it, free ventila- 
tion becomes indispensable. In a cooking apartment 
the temperature will probably be higher than outside 
hence the free admission of even hot air will be desira- 
ble. If persons do not object to sit in a direct draft of 
air, windows and doors may be opened, a breeze being 
rnore refreshing, even though several degrees warmer, 
than still air; but under nearly all other circumstances 
rooms should be kept closed as much as possible till 
after sundown, or till the air outside is cooler than that 
inside. Let in cool air, keep out hot. 



OPEN WmDOWS AT NIGHT. 

The above theory of letting in cool air must of course 
be adopted with caution. If you sleep uncomfortably 
cool you will get ill. To put the window of a bedroom 
quite high, when the thermometer is at zero is an absurd- 



SCIENTIFIC FACTS. 313 

ity. The cooler a sleeping department is — below a 
certain temperature — the more unhealthy does it become, 
because cold condenses the carbolic acid formed by the 
breathing of the sleeper. It settles near the door and is 
re-breathed, and if in a very condensed form he will die 
before the morning. Hence, we must be governed by 
circumstances ; the first thing is, you must be comfort- 
ably warm during sleep, otherwise you are not refreshed, 
and inflammation of the lungs may be engendered, and 
life destroyed within a few days. An open fire-place is 
sufficient for ordinary purposes in cold weather. When 
the windows are opened, it is well to have them down at 
the top two or three inches, and up at the bottom. 



CAUTION TO PERSONS LIVING IN MARSHY DIS- 
TRICTS. 

In miasmatic localities — and these are by rivers, ponds, 
marshes, fens, and the like — it is most important, from 
the first of August until several severe frosts have been 
noticed, to sleep with all the windows closed, because 
the cool air of sunset causes the condensation of the 
poisonous emanations which were caused by the heat of 
the noonday sun to rise far above the earth ; this conden- 
sation makes the air " heavy " at sunset, made heavy by 
the greater solidification of the emanations by cold; and 
resting on the surface of the earth in their more con- 
centrated and malignant form, they are breathed into the 
lungs, and swallowed into the stomach, corrupting and 
poisoning the blood with great rapidity. By daylight these 
condensations are made so compact by the protracted cool- 
ness of the night, that they are too near the surface of 
the earth to be breathed into the system ; but as the sun 
begins to ascend, these heavy condensations, miasms, 
14 



314 SOCIAL AND 

begin to rise again to the height of several feet above the 
ground, and are freely taken into the system by every 
breath and swallow. Hence the hours of sunrise and 
sunset are the most unhealthful of all the hours of the 
twenty-four in the localities named ; and noontide, when 
the sun is the hottest, is the most healthy portion of the 
day, because the miasm is so much rarefied that it as- 
cends rapidly. 



BEDS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT. 

The notion that feather beds are unhealthy and mat- 
tresses healthy, is erroneous. A feather bed is only un- 
healthy when the sleeper finds himself too warm in it. 
During the cold winter months the warmth of feathers is 
almost necessary. A feather bed is a greater luxury than 
a mattress. Nothing is more uncomfortable to lie upon 
than an ill-kept feather bed. A bed should be well 
shaken by the four corners alternately, and the two sides 
of the center; shake it again and again. Turn it, and re- 
peat the process, then feel for any knots of feathers, and 
separate them with the hands. On rising, strip the bed. 
Do not lay the clothes back over the footboard, but re- 
move them on one or two chairs. Shake the bolsters and 
pillows. Some make up beds immediately they are va- 
cated. To do so is not healthy. They need to air for a 
couple of hours. Open the windows, and set open the 
doors also. Unless there is a thorough draught, there 
is no true ventilation of a sleeping-room. 



CARBOLIC ACID v. CHLORIDE OF LIME. 

A recent report upon the relative value of chloride of 



SCIENTIFIC FACTS. 315 

lime and carbolic acid as disinfectants, deserves serious 
attention. Some meat was hung up in the air till the 
odor of putrefaction was strong. It was then divided 
into two pieces. One was soaked for half an hour in 
chloride of lime solution, and was then washed and hung 
up again; the offensive smell had entirely gone. The 
other piece of meat was soaked in a solution of carbolic 
acid, containing one per cent, of the acid; it was then 
dried and hung up. The surface of the meat was 
whitened, but its offensive odor was not removed, though 
it was masked by the carbolic acid. In two days' time 
the bad odor had entirely gone, and was replaced by 
a pure but faint smell of carbolic acid. In a few weeks' 
time the pieces of meat were examined again. The 
one which had been deodorized with chloride of lime 
now smelt as offensively as it did at first, whilst the piece 
treated with carbolic acid had simply dried up, and had 
no offensive odor whatever. Even after a month's ex- 
posure no change had taken place. This shows us that 
whilst chloride of lime merely removes the smell of de- 
composing matter — in fact, is a deodoriser — carbolicacid 
actually prevents decomposition, and is antiseptic. 



SUGAR AS FOOD. 



Next to corn and animal food, sugar constitutes a 
most important part of the food of the people. Al- 
though, being a non-nitrogenous substance, sugar can- 
not make flesh, yet it makes fat; it aids respiration, con- 
duces to the digestion of flesh-making things, and in 
several other ways exalts the power of that mysterious 
energy which we agree to call "life." 



3i6 SOCIAL AND 



ADULTERATION OE SUGAR. 

If brown sugar be adulterated with sand, the fraud 
may be detected by taking a glass full of clean water, 
and dissolving a quantity of the suspected sugar therein. 
If sand, or any similar substance, be present, it will fall 
to the bottom when the solution has stood for some time. 



DRAFTS PREVENTED. 

The means of preventing drafts from doors or 
windows simply consists of a slight beading, screwed or 
nailed round the door-frame, with a narrow slip, or rib- 
bon, of vulcanized india-rubber, fixed in a groove at an 
angle, so as to form an elastic spring to press against the 
door when closed, and thus to make the joints air-tight all 
round. The beading at the foot of the door is so hinged 
and affixed to the door itself, as to open much like one 
of the pieces of a parallel ruler, only protected between 
the two slips, and having a spring between its two 
pieces and the india-rubber ribbon running along the 
outer edge, so that as the door closes, a protruding heel 
of the bead, as it were, is caught by the frame and 
pressed so as to open the parallel slip and cause its rub- 
bered edge to press upon the floor or carpet, thus effi- 
ciently preventing all access of air or draft. Not 
only drafts, but dust and noise can thus be readily 
excluded, either by windows or doors. 



WHEN PERFUMES SHOULD BE USED IN THE SICK 

CHAMBER. 

Though the odors which we dislike are overpowered

by others more agreeable, the former are neither re- 
moved nor destr(jyed ; and the invalid continues to 
inhale them in spite of the warning given him by his 
sense of their injurious effects. Tliis fact leads to the 
inference that the best means of removing a bad odor 
from a room is by proper ventilation. A fire in the 
gi-ate, and the door left a-jar, or the window open top 
and bottom about an inch, will quickly change the at- 
mosphere in the apartment; the vitiated air will flow up 
the flue, while fresh air will come in at the various por- 
tals. There are, however, instances when the doctor and 
the nurse positively prohibit tiiis fresh air, and it is on 
such occasions they are beneficial, not only because they 
hide the bad smells, but because — what is far more im- 
portant — they act as a prophylactic in the atmosphere. 
The odorous substances of flowers are all antiseptic in a 
high degree, and being diffused into an atmosphere 
charged with malarious gases, they destroy their poison- 
ous effects. 



PEPSIN 



is prepared by digesting the cleansed stomachs of sheep 
or pigs in distilled water, the resulting liquid with ace- 
tate of lead, separating the precipitate thus formed by 
filtration, then suspending it in water, and passing sul- 
phuretted hydrogen through the water to decompose the 
lead precipitate. The liquid, after being gently heated 
and filtered, is evaporated nearly to dryness, and mixed 
with sufficient starch to form a powder. This powder is 
the so-called pepsin. Liquor pepticus praep. is some- 
times a solution of this powder in distilled water, and 
sometimes the liquid obtained as above, before it is 
evaporated to dryness, and mixed with starch. Fre- 
quently a little alcohol is added to it for its preservation. 



3i8 SOCIAL AND 

The dose of pepsin is about one scruple, and the liquor 
pepticus prsep. in proportional quantity. 



MUSTAED LEAVES. 

These are said to be prepared by fixing on strong 
paper a thin layer of mustard by means of a solution of 
caoutchouc in a volatile oil. To increase the activity of 
the mustard the fixed oil is extracted. The mustard 
leaves are used as substitutes for mustard poultices. 



TO RESTORE SCaRCHED LINEIT. 

The accident of scorching linen is of such frequent 
occurrence that the following process is of great value. 
It is almost needless to premise that if the tissue of the 
linen is so much burnt that no strength is left, it is use- 
less to apply it; for nothing could prevent a hole from 
being formed, although the composition would by no 
means tend to hasten that consummation. But if the 
scorching is not through, and the threads not actuall}' 
consumed, then the application of this composition, fol- 
lowed by two or three good washings, will restore the 
linen to its proper color, and the marks of the scorching 
will be totally effaced. Mix well together two ounces of 
fuller's earth reduced to a powder; one ounce of hen's 
dung; half an ounce of ca^ce soap, scraped: and the juice 
of two large onions, obtained by the onions being cut up, 
beaten in a mortar and pressed. Boil this mass in half a 
pint of strong vinegar, stirring it from timeto time, until 
it forms a thick liquid compound. Spread the composition 
thickly over the entire surface of the scorched part, and 



SCIENTIFIC FACTS. 319 

let it remain on twenty-four hours. If the scorching was 
light, this will prove sufficient, with the assistance of two 
subsequent washings, to eradicate the stain. If, how- 
ever, the scorching was strong, a second coating of the 
composition should be put on after removing the first; 
and this should also remain on for twenty-four hours. If 
after the linen has been washed twice or thrice, the stain 
has not wholly disappeared, the composition may be used 
again, in proportion to the intensity of the discoloration 
remaining, when a complete cure will seldom fail to be 
effected. It has scarcely ever happened that a third ap- 
plication was found necessary. The remainder of the 
composition should be kept for use in a gallipot tied over 
with bladder. 



PRESERVING BOOTS. 

A coat of gum -copal varnish applied to the soles of 
boots and shoes, and repeated as it dries, until the pores 
are filled and the surface shines like polished mahogany, 
will make the soles water-proof, and also cause them to 
last three times as long as ordinary soles. 



THE VALUE OF LEAVES. 

If every horticulturist would reflect for a moment on 
fhe nature of fallen leaves, which contain not only the 
vegetable matter, but the earthy salts, lime, potash, &c., 
needed for the next season's growth — and that, too, ex- 
actly in the proportion required by the very tree and 
plant from which they fell, — nay, more, if they would 
consider that it is precisely in this way, by the decom- 
position of these very fallen leaves, that nature enriches 



320 SOCIAL AND 

the soil, year after year, in her great forests ; it would 
scarcely be possible for such a reflecting horticulturist 
to allow these leaves to be swept away by every wind 
that blows, and finally lost altogether. A wise horticul- 
turist will diligently collect from week to week the 
leaves that fall under each tree, and, by digging them 
under the soil about the roots, where they will decay and 
enrich that soil, provide in the cheapest manner the best 
possible food for the tree. In certain vineyards in France, 
the vines are kept in the highest condition by simply 
burying at their roots every leaf and branch that is 
pruned off such vines, or that falls from them at the end 
of the season. 



THE AaUARIUM 

may consist of either salt water and marine animals and 
plants, or fresh water and plants and fishes ; the latter 
kind is perhaps the more amusing. 

In order that the fish and other animals may retain 
their health, nay, even their life, oxygen is absolutely 
necessary — this the plants give off in large quantities; 
while the carbon necessary to the growth and sustenta- 
tion of the plants is produced by the fishes, the two in 
combination preserve the water pure and fresh for al- 
most any length of time; water has the power of absorb- 
ing certain quantities of atmospheric air and carbonic 
acid gas; the presence of the air gives to the rain and 
spring water its refreshing qualities. The leaves of 
plants, when acted upon by light, decompose this gas, 
and, having no necessity for oxygen, they merely absorb 
the carbon. Animals, on the other hand, require oxygen 
for the purpose of removing the waste carbon of great 
divisions of organized beings, But two other elements 
play an important part in the phenomenon of life — 



SCIENTIFIC FACTS. 321 

namely, nitrogen and hydrogen. Both plants and ani- 
mals require these gases as food. They combine to 
form ammonia, which is found in small portions in the 
atmosphere and in water. Ammonia is indeed the main 
fertilizing element of vegetable life. Plants obtain their 
supply of it either through the natural water absorbed 
at their rootlets, or by means of artificial manures; ani- 
mals through the means of the substance they devour. 
All forms of vegetable and animal life are built up of 
these four elements. All that we have to do, therefore, 
to keep our miniature v/orld in activity is to imitate 
nature as closely as possible; to give fishes to the plants, 
and plants to the fishes; to keep up a proper supply of 
oxygen to the one and carbon to the other, the other 
gases being always present in sufficient quantity. 

Various kinds of receptacles are used for both the 
marine and the fresh water aquaria. The square, or 
rectangular glass tank, is the most expensive, while an 
ordinary propagating glass turned upside down and 
placed in a stand, forms a very good-shaped vase, espec- 
cially for fresh water animals. 

Where the jointed glass is used it is sometimes found 
to leak, ^n which case either of the following cements 
will remedy the defect : — i. Mix boiled linseed oil, lith- 
arge, red and white lead together, to a proper consistence, 
always using the larger proportion of white lead. This 
composition may be applied to a piece of flannel and fit- 
ted to the joints. — 2. A more powerful cement is com- 
posed in the proportion of two ounces of sal ammoncia, 
and four ounces of sulphur, made into a stiff paste with 
a little water. When the cement is wanted for use, dis- 
solve a portion of the paste in water rendered slightly 
acid, and add a quantity of iron turnings or filings sifted 
or powdered, to render the particles of uniform size. 
This mixture will in a short time become as hard as stone. 
— 3. Make a mixture of a solution of eight ounces of 
strong glue, and one ounce of varnish of linseed oil, or 



32 2 SOCIAL AND 

three-quarters of an ounce of Venice turpentine, which 
are to be boiled together, agitating all the time, until the 
mixture becomes as complete as possible. The pieces to 
be cemented ought to be kept in conjunction for forty- 
eight or sixty hours. 

Next as to the filling and stocking. A sub-stratum 
of soil, in which the plants may grow, is necessary, just 
enough of sand, stones, and clay to cover the bottom ; 
but no mud — nothing that is easily removable or apt to 
discolor the water. Then the weeds; and lastly, the ani- 
mals. Ordinary pond water will do admirably for fresh- 
water aquaria, while good sea water is necessary for the 
marine tank. Weeds require very little soil. Almost 
any weed may, however, be naturalized in the aquarium. 
Then for fish. The ordinary stickleback, if kept by 
themselves, are most amusing inhabitants ; or the gold- 
fish, the carp, or the minnow may be profitably intro- 
duced. But, in order to keep down the green conferv(z, a 
few snails are absolutely necessary. To these may be 
added water-newts, or efts, or even a good-sized toad ; 
which, by the way, is by no means so repulsive an animal 
as is by many believed. But you must be careful not to 
introduce some kinds of water-beetles ; but tlae diving 
spider {Arga roueta aquaticd) will be found a most inter- 
esting addition. 

As a general rule the best position for an aquarium 
is at a window where it may receive plenty of light, and 
yet not be subjected to direct sunshine, unless some pro- 
vision is made for affording shelter for the fishes, for it 
must be borne in mind that fishes have no eyelids; it 
would, therefore, be as cruel to expose them to the rays 
of the sun, as to place a man whose eyelids were cut off 
in the same position. We have met with cases where 
ignorant, though well-meaning persons, who have kept 
gold-fishes, have made a practice of placing the globe 
containing them in the sunshine, because, as they thought, 
it made them " so lively," whereas the unfortunate fishes 



SCIENTIFIC FACTS. 323 

were really darting about in agony, vainly attempting to 
escape from the blinding glare. 

Some persons place the aquarium in such a position 
as to allow the light to enter it on all sides, while others 
prefer to darken one or more of the sides, or sometimes 
allow the light to enter at the top only. Sunshine for an 
hour or two a day accelerates the growth of the plants. 



REPOLISHING JEWELRY, &c. 

A solution of cyanide of potassium in water is equal, 
if not superior, to any compound that can be used for 
cleaning jewelry, the liquid cleaning all those parts of 
the work which neither brush, buff, nor thread could 
reach. Here is the method: — Dissolve one ounce of cya- 
nide of potassium in three gills of soft water, turn up the 
end of a piece of brass or iron wire into a hook, attach it 
to the article to be cleaned, and immerse it in the solu- 
tion, shaking it backward and forward for a second or 
two, then take it out and rinse well in clean water. Wash 
it with warm water and soap to remove any film of cya- 
nide that may remain; rinse again, dip into spirits of wine, 
and dry in boxwood sawdust. The advantage of dipping 
in spirits of wine is the immediate drying of the work 
without any sticking of the sawdust to it. When done 
with the solution, put it in a bottle and cork tightly. It 
may be used again and again for some months. Care 
should be taken not to wet the fingers with the solution, and not 
to inhale the odor, as the cyatiide is a violent poison. 



THE WEIGHT OF A SUNBEAM. 

Not only does light fly from the sun with a velocity 



324 SOCIAL AND 

which is a million times greater than the speed of a can- 
non-ball, but it darts from every reflecting surface with 
a like velocity, and reaches the eye so gently that, as it 
falls upon it, it imparts the most pleasing sensations. 
Philosophers once sought to weigh the sunbeam. They 
constructed a most delicate balance, and suddenly let in 
upon it a beam of light. The lever of the balance was 
so delicately hung that the fluttering of a fly would have 
disturbed it. Everything prepared, the grave men took 
their places, and with keen eyes watched the result. The 
sunbeam that was to decide the experiment had left the 
sun eight minutes prior, to pass the ordeal. It had flown 
through 95,000,000 miles of space in that short measure 
of time, and it shot upon the balance with unabated 
velocity. But the lever moved not; and the philosophers 
were mute. 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 



SOAPS, 



in all their varieties, consist of certain proportions of 
grease and alkaline salts, to which resin and scents are 
added in greater or lesser quantities. The common yel- 
low soap is a compound of tallow, resin, and soda; and 
what is called honey soap is only yellow soap slightly 
refined and scented. The actual process of cleansing, 
and the reason why soap cleanses, is this: — soap consists 
of lixivial salts, alkalies, and tallow, and the greater 
part of the dirt on linen, clothes, &c., consists of oily 
perspiration, grease, and the dust which such grease at- 
tracts. In cold water these matters are insoluble; but in 
warm water, to which alkalies have in any way been 
added, the greasy dirt unites with the salts, and becomes 
saponaceous, and so far soluble as that it may be soon 
washed out. This is the secret of all washing powders; 
and in washing our hands we, in fact, perform a real 
chemical experiment. Many kinds of soap are prepared 
. for the toilet; the following are among the best: — 

Toilet Soap. 

Take four ounces of Castile soap, slice it down into a 
pewter jar, and cover with alcohol; place the jar in a ves- 

[325] 



326 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 

sel of water at such a heat as will cause the spirit to 
boil, when the soap will soon dissolve; then put the jar, 
closely covered, in a warm place until the liquor is clari- 
fied; take off any scum that may appear on the surface, 
and pour it carefully from the dregs; then put it into the 
jar again, and place it in the vessel of hot water: distil- 
ling all the spirits that arise; dry the remaining mass in 
the air for a few days, when a white transparent soap 
will be obtained, free from impurities, and void of smell. 
In this way the best fancy soaps of the shops are pre- 
pared. To color this soap, add a small quantity of any 
of the vegetable dyes. Then expose the jar to a gentle 
heat, and pour the soap out into small molds to cool; 
adding a few drops of any perfume. 

Lemon Soap. 

Take two ounces of lemon juice; one ounce of oil of 
bitter almonds; one ounce of oil of tartar; and two 
ounces of Venice soap. Stir the mixture (cold) until the 
different ingredients are thoroughly blended, and it has 
acquired the consistency of honey; then put it up in 
small china boxes. 

Musk Soap. 

Take four ounces of dried root of mallows in fine 
powder, four ounces of rice powder, two ounces of oil 
of tar, two ounces of oil of sweet almonds, six ounces of 
Florentine iris root, and one drachm of essence of musk. 
Blend the whole thoroughly, and make it up into a stiff 
paste with orange-flower water; then mold into round 
balls or cakes. 

Wash-balls. 

Shave thin two pounds of new white soap into about 
a teacupful of rose-water, then pour as much boiling 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 327 

water on as will soften it. Put into a brass pan a pint 
of sweet oil, one ounce of oil of almonds, half a pound 
of spermaceti, and set all over the fire till dissolved; 
then add the soap and half an ounce of camph(jr in pow- 
der, with a few drops of lavender-water, or any other 
scent. Boil ten minutes, then pour it into a basin, and 
stir it till it is thick enough to roll up into hard balls, 
which must then be done as soon as possible. 

Windsor Soap. 

Scrape some of the best white soap very thin, melt it 
in a stewpan over a slow fire, scent it well with oil of 
caraway, or other odor, and pour it into a mold. After 
standing three or four days in a dry place, cut it into 
square pieces. 

Washing Powders 

are best bought ready made. — But much soap and labor 
is saved by dissolving alum and chalk in bran-water, in 
which the linen is to be boiled, then well rinsed out, and 
bleached. Soap may even be rendered supertluous, or 
nearly so, in the getting up of muslins, by washing them 
in plain water, and then boiling them in rice-water; after 
which they must not be ironed, but passed through the 
mangle. 



WASHES. 



Rose Vinegar for the Toilet. 

Gather a quantity of rose leaves, and put them in a 
clean basin; then add two penny-worth of pure acetic 
acid,. diluted with half a pint of water (cold): pour on the 
rose leaves, and cover well from the air. Macerate for 



328 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 

four days; then strain off the fluid, and add a drop or two 
of otto of rose (or not, at pleasure). Of course the above 
can be made in large quantities, only observing the same 
proportions. 

Elder-Flower Water. 

Pick a quantity of the flowers, put them into a jug, and 
pour boiling Avater upon them. Let the decoction stand 
till it is quite cold, and then strain through a piece of 
muslin. It is an excellent wash for the face, and re- 
moves freckles when merely produced by the summer 
heat. The wash can be made strong, and can be used as 
frequently as desired; but one or two applications a day 
are usually sufficient. 

Lotion. 

Blanched bitter almonds, two ounces; blanched sweet 
almonds, one ounce; beat to a paste, add distilled water, 
one quart; mix well, strain, put into a bottle, add corro- 
sive sublimate in powder, twenty grains, dissolve in two 
tablespoonfuls of spirits of wine, and shake well. Used 
to impart softness to the skin; and also as a wash for 
obstinate, eruptive diseases. Wet the skin with it, either 
by means of the corner of a napkin, or the fingers dipped 
into it, and then gently wipe off with a dry cloth. 

"Wash for the Face. 

The following is a cheap and perfectly harmless 
wash to remove the disagreeable effects of perspiration 
on the face and other parts of the body: — Procure 
compound spirits of ammonia, and place about two 
tablespoonfuls in a basin of water. Washing the face, 
hands, and arms with this, leaves the skin clean, sweet, 
and fresh.

PERFUMES 

Are in a general way best prepared by the chemists, 
but a few receipts for the more useful kinds are here 
given. 

Lavender Water. 

Best oil of lavender, four drachms; oil of cloves, 
half a drachm; musk, five grains; best spirits of wine, 
six ounces; water, one ounce. Mix the oil of lavender 
with a little of the spirits first, then add the other in- 
gredients, and let it stand, being kept well corked for 
at least two months before it is used, shaking it fre- 
quently. 

Eau de Cologne. 

Take one gallon of white brandy; sage and thyme, 
of each one drachm; balm-mint and spear-mint, of each 
one ounce; calamus aromaticus, one drachm; root of 
angelica, one drachm; camphor, one drachm; petals of 
roses and violets, of each a quarter of an ounce; 
flowers of lavender, one eighth of an ounce; flower of 
orange, one drachm; wormwood, one drachm; nutmegs, 
cloves, cassia, lignea, mace, of each one drachm. One 
orange and one lemon, cut in pieces. Allow the whole 
to macerate in the spirit during twenty-four hours; 
then distill off a pint by the heat of a water bath. 
Add to the product, essence of lemons, of cedrat, of 
balm-mint, of lavender, each one drachm; neroli and 
essence of the seed of anthos, each one drachm; es-

essence of cedrat, one drachm; essence of lavender, 
half a drachm; essence of orange flowers, and tincture 
of ambergris, of each ten drops; tincture of musk, half 
a drachm; tincture of benzoin, three drachms; essence 
of roses, two drops. Mix, and filter. 

Perfume for Handkerchiefs. 

Oil of lavender, three fluid drachms; oil of bergamot, 
three fluid drachms ; extract of ambergris, six minims ; 
camphor, one grain ; spirits of wine, one pint. To be 
well shaken every day for a fortnight, and then filtered. 

Perfume for Gloves. 

Extract of ambergris, two minims ; spirits of wine, 
one ounce. Rub the gloves inside with a piece of cotton 
impregnated with this perfume. Boots and shoes may be 
treated in the same manner. 

Rose Water. 

Take six pounds of the leaves of fresh damask roses, 
and as much water as will prevent burning. Distill off a 
gallon. 

Pastiles. 

Take gum arable, two ounces ; charcoal powder, five 
ounces ; cascarilla bark, one-fourth of an ounce ; salt- 
peter, three-fourths of an ounce. Mix with water and 
make into shape. 

Artificial Musk. 

Rectified oil of amber, one pound ; nitric acid, four 
parts ; after some time a black matter is deposited ; this, 



DOM EST] C CHEMISTRY. 331 

after having been well washed with water, has very much 
the smell of musk. True musk is adulterated with this, 
but still oftener with dried bullock's blood. 



The Congress. 

Essence of cloves and bergamot, of each three-quarters 
of a drachm ; neroli, about a drachm ; essence of musk, 
half an ounce ; eau de rose, spirit of tuberose, and the 
strongest spirits of wine, of each half a pint ; spirits of 
jasmin and cassia, of each one pint; dissolve the essences 
in the spirits of wine, then add the other spirits, and 
when weir mixed, add the rose-water. 

The Jasmine. 

Ambergris, half an ounce ; musk, three drachms ; 
grind together in a Wedgwood-ware mortar ; add oil of 
cloves, ten drops ; of true balsam of Peru, twenty drops; 
and of essence of jasmine, or tuberose, a sufficient quan- 
tity to convert it into a perfectly smooth paste; then put 
it into a strong bottle, with rectified spirits of wine, one 
quart. Observe, before adding the whole of the last, to 
rinse the mortar out well with it, that nothing may be 
lost. Lastly, digest for six or eight weeks. Avery small 
quantity added to lavender water, eau de cologne, tooth 
powder, or wash balls, communicates a delicious fra- 
grance. 

Scents for Pomatums. 

I. Oil of lavender, fourteen ounces; oil of cloves, one 
ounce; oil of marjoram, two ounces; gum benzoin, twenty 
ounces. — 2. Essence of bergamot and essence of lemon, 
of each, twelve ounces; oil of cloves and oil of marjoram, 
of each three ounces; gum benzoin, twenty ounces. — 3. 
Essence of bergamot, one pound; essence of lemon, eight 



332 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 

ounces; oil of marjoram and oil of cloves, of each, two 
ounces; oil of oranges, one and a half ounce. — 4. Essence 
of bergamot, one pound; essence of lemon, half a pound; 
oil of cloves, four ounces. — 5. Essence of bergamot and 
essence of lemon, of each, half a pound; oil of cloves, 
two ounces; oil of sassafras and oil of orange, of each, 
one ounce. — 6. Essence of lemon, three ounces; essence 
of ambergris, four ounces; oil of cloves and oil of lav- 
ender, of each, two ounces. 

Howers for Distillation. 

It is said that common salt applied to flowers will 
preserve them, with nearly all their characteristic odor, 
for several years. Thus roses and aromatic plants may 
be preserved to any time most convenient for distilla- 
tion, or may be imported for that purpose. The process 
of salting roses is take one pound of the leaves or other 
vegetable substance, one pound of salt, and rub them to- 
gether a few minutes. The friction of the salt forces out 
the juice of the flower, and the whole is reduced to an 
aromatic paste, which is put in a cool place until wanted. 
When distilled, the paste is placed in a retort with twice 
•its weight of water. 

Smelling Salts. 

Slack lime, half an ounce; carbonate of ammonia, 
half an ounce; each to be well powdered and mixed. 
Add, essence of bergamot, six drops; oil of cloves, two 
drops; essence of musk, twelve drops; otto of roses, six 
drops; strong liquor of ammonia, one drachm. 

Almond Sloom. 

Dust of Brazil-wood, one ounce; water, three pints; 
boil, strain; add isingass, six drachms; cochineal, two 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 333 

drachms; alum, one ounce; borax, three drachms; boil 
again, and strain through a fine cloth. This is a fine 
pinii color, used by the perfumer. 



POMATUMS. 



Melt very slowly one pound of prepared suet and three 
ounces of white wax. Perfume with any favorite essen- 
tial oil. To make this softer, add to every pound six 
ounces of oil of sweet almonds, and if necessary, more of 
the perfume. Strain and pot. 

Rosemary Pomatum. 

Boil in a tin saucepan, with half a pound of hog's lard, 
two large handfuls of flowers of rosemary, until reduced 
to half bulk. Strain and pot. 

Almond Pomatum. 

Take one pint of oil of sweet almonds; set over a 
slow fire, and gradually melt in it one ounce and a half 
of spermaceti, and two ounces of hog's lard. The heat 
must be barely sufficient to melt these, for a high tem- 
perature would make the oil rancid in a few days. When 
melted, pour into a basin; and when almost cold, stir in 
whatever essential oils you prefer. Strain and pot. Beef 
marrow, purified by being boiled in water, and the scum 
removed, may be used instead of hog's lard. 



334 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY, 



HAIR OILS 

should be simple, and not contain any injurious proper- 
ties. 

Eose Oil. 

Beat to a pulp four ounces of rose-leaves; add three- 
quarters of a pint of olive oil; mix well; let stand, covered, 
for a week; press out the oil. Repeat the process with 
fresh roses until the oil smells sufficiently strong; filter 
and use. 

Jasmine Oil. 

Mix well one pint of oil of ben, three grains of civet, 
three fluid ounces of Italian oil of jasmine, and three min- 
ims of otto of roses. Strain and use. Ten minims of oil 
of roses may be substituted for the otto of roses, if the 
latter is not to be had. 



Oil to Promote the Growth of the Hair. 

Mix three ounces of olive oil with one drachm of oil 
of lavender. Mix equal parts of olive oil and spirits of 
rosemary, add a few drops of oil of nutmeg, and anoint 
the head very sparingly before going to bed. Apply fre- 
quently. 

Macassar Oil. 

Mix one pound of olive oil, one drachm of oil of ori- 
ganum, and one and a quarter drachms of oil of rosemary. 
Strain and use.

HAIR WASHES. 

The following washes may be safely applied for the 
removal of scurf, dandruff, &c. 

Rosemary Wash. 

Rosemary water, one gallon; rectified spirits of wine, 
one half-pint; pearlash, one ounce. 

Athenian Water. 

Rose water, one gallon; alcohol, one pint; sassafras- 
wood, one quarter pound; pearlash, one ounce. Boil 
the wood in the rose water in a glass vessel; then, when 
cold, add the pearlash and spirits. This wash is even 
more efficient than the rosemary preparation for clean- 
sing the hair. 

Wash to Promote Curling. 

Take borax, two ounces; gum arabic, one drachm; 
and hot water (not boiling) one quart; stir, and as soon 
as the ingredients are dissolved, add three tablespoon- 
fuls of strong spirits of camphor. At night, wet the hair 
with this, and roll in curling paper. 



TOOTH POWDERS. 

Pound together in a mortar, cream of tartar and 
chalk, of each half an ounce; myrrh, powdered, one 
drachm; orris root, powdered, half a drachm; and pow- 
dered bark, two drachms; or, powder and mix, red bark 
and Armenian bole, of each half an ounce; poAvdered 



336 DOMESTIC CHEMISTR Y. 

cinnamon and bicarbonate of soda, of each quarter of an 
ounce; and oil of cinnamon, one or two drops; or mix 
together half an ounce of powdered charcoal, and one 
and a half ounces of prepared chalk. , 

Vegetable Tooth Powder. 

Take fine powder of Florentine iris five parts, pure 
starch, three ditto, quinine two ditto, ditto hyoscyamus 
one ditto; sugar to taste, and perfume the iris with otto 
of roses — carmine may be used to color it. Pound in a 
mortar, to an impalpable powder. 



COSMETICS. 
Carmine Rouge. 



Pour two quarts of distilled water into a copper pan, 
and when boiling add two ounces of. the best grain 
cochineal, finely ground and sifted; boil for six minutes, 
carefully stirring, add sixty grains of fine Roman alum, 
in powder, boil three minutes longer; set to cool. Be- 
fore quite cold, decant the clear liquor and strain through 
'white silk into porcelain dishes; in four days decant and 
filter again into other dishes. The precipitate which has 
then fallen down is to be dried carefully in the shade. 

Cold Cream, 

Take oil of almonds, one pound ; white wax, four 
ounces; melt, pour into a warm mortar; add, by degrees, 
rose water, one pint. 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 337 



Almond Paste. 

Used to soften and whiten the skin, prevent chapped 
hands, &c. Sweet and bitter almonds, of each two 
ounces ; spermaceti, two drachms ; oil of almonds, half 
an ounce ; Windsor soap, half an ounce ; otto of roses 
and oil of bergamot, of each, twelve drops ; 07-, take 
four pounds of bitter almonds, blanched and dried; beat 
them in a mortar to a smooth paste with lavender water; 
add one pound of best honey, two ounces of oil of jas- 
mine, half a pound of almond powder, and four ounces 
of fine orris powder ; beat and mix repeatedly together. 
This paste will keep for twelve months. 

Lip Salve. 

Take hog's lard, washed in rose water, half a pound, 
red and damask rose leaves bruised, quarter of a pound; 
work well together in a mortar, repeatedly, for two days; 
then melt and strain ; add to the lard the same quantity 
of rose leaves, let them stand for two more days ; sim- 
mer in a water-bath, and strain, stirring in five or six 
drops of otto of roses. Pot for use. 



White Lip Salve 

is made of equal parts of oil of almonds, spermaceti, wax, 
and white sugar candy ; pound, mix, and pot. 



INKS 

of various colors are not difficult to make, if care be 
taken to follow the directions here given. 
15 



338 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 



Black. 

Take of Aleppo galls, bruised, one pound and a half ; 
green vitriol, twelve ounces ; powdered gum arable, 
eight ounces ; rasped logwood, eight ounces; soft water, 
two and a half gallons. Boil the galls and logwood in 
the water till it be reduced to two gallons, then add the 
rest, and put the whole into a convenient vessel, stirring 
it several times during the day for fourteen or fifteen 
days, when it will be fit for use. For smaller quantities 
employ the same proportions. 

Another Slack Ink 

may be made of bruised galls three parts, gum and sul- 
phate of iron one part; vinegar and water; macerate and 
agitate for three or four days. 

Indestructible Ink. 

For black, twenty-five grains of copal, in powder, dis- 
solved in tvvo hundred grains of oil of lavender, by gentle 
heat; mixed with two and a half grains of lamp black, 
and a half grain of indigo. Useful for labeling phials, 
&c., containing corrosive chemicals. 

Red. 

Raspings of Brazil wood, quarter of a pound, in- 
fused for two or three days in vinegar. Boil one hour 
over a gentle fire, and filter, while hot, through paper 
laid in an earthenware colander. Heat again, and dis- 
solve in it, first, half an ounce of gum arable, and after- 
wards of alum and white sugar, each half an ounce. 

Blue. 

Chinese blue, three ounces; oxalic acid, three-quar- 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 339 

ters of an ounce; gum arable, powdered, one ounce, dis- 
tilled water, six pints. Mix. 

, Yellow. 

Boil French berries, a quarter of a pound; alum, half 
an ounce, in water, one pint, for half an hour, or longer; 
then strain, and dissolve in the hot liquor, gum arable, iialf 
an ounce ; gamboge, in coarse powder, half an ounce; 
hot water, two ounces and a half, dissolved, and when 
cold add spirit, about half an ounce. 

Marking Ink. 

One drachm of nitrate of silver (lunar caustic), dis- 
solved in a glass mortar, in double its weight of pure 
water. This forms the ink. Then dissolve one drachm 
of salts of tartar in an ounce of water, in another vessel; 
this is the liquid with which the linen must be previously 
wetted, then allowed to dry, and afterwards to be written 
on. Nitrate of silver is the basis of all marking inks. 

Invisible or Sympathetic Inks. 

I. Sulphate of copper and sal-ammoniac, equal parts, 
dissolved in water; writes colorless, but XxSiXn^ yellow when 
heated. — 2. Onion juice, like the last. — 3. A weak infu- 
sion of galls; turns black when moistened with weak 
copperas water. — 4. A weak solution of sulphate of iron; 
turns blue when moistened with a weak solution of prus- 
siate of potash, and black, with infusion of galls. — 5. 
Diluted solutions of nitrate of silver and ter-chloride of 
gold, darken when exposed to sunlight. — 6. Aquafortis, 
spirits of salts, oil of vitriol, common salt or saltpeter, 
dissolved in a large quantity of water; turns yellow or 
brown when heated. — 7. Solution of nitro-muriate of 
cobalt; turns green when heated, and disappears again 



340 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 

on cooling. — 8. Solution of acetate of cobalt, to which a 
little niter has been added; becomes rose-colored when 
heated, and disappears on cooling. 

Imitation Indian Ink. 

Dissolve six parts of isinglass in twice its weight of 
boiling water, one part of liquorice in two parts of boil- 
ing water. Mix together while warm; then incorporate 
by little and little, on a stone with a spatula, one part of 
the finest ivory black. Heat the mixture in a water-bath 
till the water has evaporated to a paste. Mold into sticks 
or balls. 

Ink for Zinc Crarden Labels. 

Thirty parts of verdigris, thirty of sal-ammoniac, eight 
of lamp-black, eight of gum-arabic, and three hundred of 
water; dissolve the gum in water, and pour it over the 
other ingredients, well mixed and reduced to powder. 
Write with a quill pen. 

Plumbago for Zinc Labels. 

Rub the part of the label to be written on with pumice- 
stone; then write with a carpenter's black-lead pencil; 
and when the writing has been exposed to the air for a 
few days it will become indelible. If the label gets cov- 
ered with mold, it may be washed off, and the writing 
will reappear. 



DYEING. 



The more difficult processes in dyeing are best left to 
the professional dyer, but many persons will be able to 
accomplish the following successfully: — 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 341 



For Small Kibbons. 

Procure your liquid dye — magenta or any other color 
you prefer — of a good chemist. The ribbon must be very 
light — wiiite is best — and must, before making use of the 
dye, be washed in strong soap and water, and afterwards 
rinsed in plain hot water. Then take a quart of water, 
nearly boiling, pour into it a few drops of the dye, stir 
well, put in your ribbons, and stir well during the time 
of dyeing. 

Cotton may be Dyed Red 

thus: — Boil in an iron kettle one pound of cam-wood. 
This will color three pounds of cotton cloth a light red; 
let it remain in the dye for a day or two, airing and heat- 
ing it now and then. 

To Dye Leather, Iron, Wood, &c., Red. 

Dissolve four grammes of picric acid in 250 grammes 
of boiling water, and add, after cooling, eight grammes 
of ammonia. In a separate vessel dissolve two grammes 
of crystallized pichsine in forty-live grammes of alcohol, 
and dilute with 375 grammes of hot water, then add fifty 
grammes of ammonia. When the red color of the pichsine 
has disappeared, mix the two liquids, and immerse the 
articles to be dyed. For ivory or bone, add a little 
nitric or hydrochloric acid. On adding gelatine it can 
be used as a red ink. 

Black Dye. 

Wool, hair, or silk may be dyed thus: — Boil the arti- 
cles for two hours in a decoction of nutgalls, and after- 
wards keep them for two hours more in a bath com- 
posed of logwood and sulphate of iron; kept during the 



342 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 

whole time at a scalding heat, but not boiling. During 
the operations, they must frequently be exposed to the 
air. The common proportions are five parts of galls, 
five of sulphate of iron, and thirty of logwood for every 
hundred of cloth. Sometimes a little acetate of copper 
(verdigris) is added to improve the color. Silk is dyed 
in the same manner as wool, but the quantity of galls 
must be doubled, and the silk left longer in the solution. 

Scarlet Dye for WooL 

Take a clean brass kettle, and heat in it sufficient 
water to cover the articles to be dyed. Then to every 
pound weight of wool, put in half an ounce of cream of 
tartar, one ounce of pulverized cochineal, scald and 
strain, set it back, put two ounces of muriate of tin, stir 
well, wet your cloth in clean water, wring dry, put in 
the dye and let it remain one hour, air it. This dyes a 
bright scarlet; and a darker color may be obtained by 
dipping the articles in strong alum water. 

Dyeing Feathers. 

This process is too difficult, and the cost of failure so 
heavy — as a badly-dyed feather is often useless — that it 
should never be undertaken by unskilled hands. 



CLEANING. 



Silks, feathers, kid gloves, and many other articles of 
dress require cleaning from time to time, but, except in 
the few instances given below, it is always best and 
cheapest to send the articles to a regular cleaner. Colored 
silks are cleaned with so much risk that this is imperative. 
White sPk is cleaned by dissolving curd-soap in water as 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 343 

hot as the hand can bear, and passing the silk throug)i 
and through, handling it gently, and rubbing any spots 
till they disappear. The silk should then be rinsed in 
lukewarm waLer, and stretched by pins to dry, FlowereJ 
white silk is cleaned by bread-crumbs rubbed on by the 
hands. Black silk, by some ox -gall, put into boiling water. 
The silk should be laid out on a table, and both sides 
sponged with the gall-liquor, then rinsed with clear 
water. A very little gum-arabic or gelatine, dissolved in 
a quantity of water, and passed over the wrong side of 
the silk, which should then be stretched out on pins to 
dry, will stiffen it. All these operations, however, re- 
quire practice, and are not to be recommended to novices. 

Feathers 

are cleaned by dissolving four ounces of white soap, cut 
small, in half a gallon of water, not quite scalding hot ; 
beating this into a lather; then putting in the feathers, 
rubbing them gently with the fingers ; and then washed 
out in very hot, clean water. Kid Gloves should not be at- 
tempted. Silk and cloth gloves, however, are easily cleaned 
by plain washing. IVhite lace vails are boiled gently 
for a few minutes in curd-soap and water ; then taken 
out and passed through warm water and soap, removing 
any spots, &c. ; tlien rinse from the soap, and have ready 
a pan of clean cold water, in which put a small drop of 
liquid blue ; then take a teaspoonful of starch, and pour 
boiling water upon it, run the vail through this, and 
clear it well, by clapping it between the hands ; frame it 
or pin it out ; keep the edges straigh^. 

To Eenovate Black Satin. 

Take a quarter of a pound of soft soap, quarter of a 
pound of honey, and two glasses of gin; mix well; place 



t 



344 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 

the satin flat on a clean table, right side np, wet all over 
with a sponge and tepid water; put on a little of the 
mixture with a hard brush, and wash the surface of the 
satin with the brush and tepid water. Then merely rinse 
the satin in a large tub of cold water, and hang up to 
dry; iron on the wrong side, when damp, with a very 
hot iron. 

Black Lace Vails 

are cleansed by passing them through a warm liquor of 
ox-gall and water, rinse in cold water, and finish as fol- 
lows: — Take a small piece of glue, about the size of a 
bean, pour boiling water upon it; when dissolved, pass 
the vail through it; then clap it between your hands, and 
pin it out; keep the edges straight. 

Straw Bonnets 

must be well scoured with soap and water, then rinsed 
in cold water, and hung in the air to dry. When dry, 
wash over with white of ^^^ well beaten. Remove the 
wire before washing. The process of bleaching by sul- 
phur is too tedious and troublesome to be done at home. 

Another Way. 

Procure at a druggist's five cents' worth of " crab's-eye;" 
crush the lumps, and apply the powder to the straw with 
a piece of rag; rub in firmly and thoroughly, going over 
it twice, and dust it with a velvet brush when finished. 

To Clean Gilt Frames, Cornices, &c. 

Squeeze dry a soft sponge that has been dipped in 
cold water, and go, with a very quick light hand, all 
over the gilding, into the hollows, &c.; do not go over 
them more than once, and do not dry with a cloth. 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 345 



To Clean Silver. 

Wash with soap and hot water, to free from grease; 
mix a little fine whiting and water to a paste, and rub it 
on with the soft part of the hand. Wlien dry, polish 
witli a very soft wash-leather and brush made for this 
purpose. If the silver is very dirty, use rouge instead 
of whiting, and wash it off with hot water and soap; dry 
thoroughly with a soft cloth, and polish. 

To Renovate Black Lace Edgings, &c. 

Dip the laces into a little very weak gum-water; then 
have ready a piece of black book muslin (new); fold it 
over and under the laces, &c., and iron all together with 
a hot iron; remove the lace before it adheres to the mus- 
lin, when it will be found to be similar to new, having 
taken the black from the muslin, without any objection- 
able gloss. If of brown color, add a little good black ink 
to the gum- water. 



STARCHING. 



Fine things are best got up thus: — Soak in cold water 
the night before; the next day wring them out, soap well, 
and pour boiling water over; rub out of that water, and 
soap a second time. Repeat the boiling water. When 
this has been done twice, rinse well in two or three 
waters, letting the last one have a little liquid blue in it. 
Let remain till your starch is made; get best starch, mix 
up well in a little cold water, then pour boiling water in, 
mixing all the time; put into a very clean saucepan, and 
when starch is just on the boil, stir into it a small lump 
15* 



346. DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 

of sugar, or a very little bit of wax candle, with a little 
blue. When your starch has boiled for a minute, strain 
it through apiece of linen, and then starch your things 
(first wringing them out of the blue water). After they 
are starched let them dry; and two or three hours before 
ironing out, they must be well damped and rolled up 
tight in a clean cloth. Collars and lace should always 
be ironed out upon a piece of blanket or cloth, used only 
for that purpose. If linen be mildewed, wet it with soft 
water; rub with white soap; scrape some fine chalk to 
powder, and rub it well ipto the linen; lay it out on grass 
in the sunshine, watching to keep it damp wi-th soft water; 
repeat the process next day. 



Another "Way. 

After the articles are thoroughly washed, mix the 
starch with a little tepid water to a paste; tlien add more 
warm water, well mixed; dip the articles in this, wring 
out, roll up in a clean cloth, and iron at once with very 
hot irons. 



WASHING COUNTEEPANES, &c. 

A solution of one pound of mottled soap, a quarter of 
an ounce of potash, and one ounce of pearlash, in a pail 
of boiling water, will be found most useful in washing 
thick quilts, counterpanes, &c. Another good washing 
preparation is: put one ounce of saltpeter into half a 
pint of water, and keep it in a corked bottle; two table- 
spoonfuls for a pound of soap. Soak, wash, and boil as 
usual. This bleaches the clothes well, without injuring 
the fabric. 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 347 



To Prevent Irons Sticking on Starched Articles. 

Well clean, and then rub the iron on soap j then wipe 
and proceed to iron. Repeat, if necessary. 



Iron-mold, to Remove. 

Wet the spots with water, then lay the linen on a 
boiling hot-water plate, and put a little essential salt of 
lemon on it. As the part becomes dry, wet it again, 
keeping the water in the plate at the same degree of 
heat. When the spots disappear, wash the linen in cold 
water. 

To Clean Cloth. 

Dissolve in a pint of spring water one ounce of pearl- 
ash, and add a lemon cut in slices. Let stand two days, 
then strain the clear liquor into bottles. A little of this 
dropped on spots of grease will soon remove them, but 
the cloth must be washed immediately after with cold 
water. 



STAINS. 



To Remove from Books, &c. 

As it is often important to remove these stains effect- 
ually, the following hints will be found useful: — Oxy- 
muriatic acid removes perfectly stains of ink. Spirits of 
salt, diluted in five or six times the quantity of water, 
may be applied with success upon the spot, and after a 
minute or two washing it off with clean water. A solu- 
tion of oxalic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid is 
attended with the least risk, and may be applied upon 



348 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 

the paper and plates without fear of damage. These 
acids, taking out writing ink, and not touching the 
printing, can be safely used for restoring books where 
the margins have been written upon. 



Grease Spots. 

Scrape the surface grease off with a blunt knife; warm 
carefully the part stained, and apply blotting-paper; then 
dip a brush in rectified spirit of turpentine, heated almost 
to boiling, and draw it gently over both sides of the paper, 
which must be kept warm; repeat until the grease is en- 
tirely removed. To restore the paper to its former white- 
ness, dip another brush in spirits of wine, and draw it 
over the place which was stained, and round the edges of 
the spot. 



FUES AND WOOLEN GOODS. 
To Preserve from Moth. 

There are several standard receipts; but they are 
rendered useless unless the furs or clothes, when laid 
aside, are placed in a roomy drawer lined with cedar, and 
have small pieces of crude camphor sprinkled amongst 
them; and once a month, at least, be taken out, examined 
in the sun, and beaten with a cane. To preserve furs on 
a voyage, they must be secured from damp, and thickly 
covered with cayenne pepper. The following mixtures, 
ground to fine powder, sewn up in little bags, and put 
among your clothes, are preventatives: — 

I. Take one ounce each of cloves, caraway seeds, nut- 
meg, mace, cinnamon, and Tonquin beans; then add as 
much Florentine orris-root as will equal the other ingre- 
dients put together. — 2. Two ounces eacli of coriander 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 349 

powder, Florentine orris powder, powdered rose-leaves, 
powdered sweet-scented flag root, four ounces of laven- 
der flowers, powdered, one scruple musk, one drachm 
powder of sandal-wood. — Turpentine sprinkled over the 
clothes is said to effectually preser\e. They ought to be 
well aired before wearing. A simple method is to wrap 
the fur in brown paper, well sprinkled with pepper out- 
side, and placed in a tin box. 



WATERPROOFma. 



Cloth. 



Put into a bucket of soft water half a pound of sugar 
of lead, and half a pound of powdered alum; stir occa- 
sionally until clear. Then pour off into another bucket, 
put the cloth in and let it remain for twenty-four hours; 
hang up to dry without wringing. Any woolen clothes 
may be waterproofed by this simple method. 

Calico, &c. 

Take three pints of pale linseed oil, one ounce of 
sugar of lead, and four ounces of white resin; the sugar 
of lead must be ground with a small quantity of the resin, 
and added to the remainder; the resin should be incor- 
porated with the oil by means of a gentle heat. The com- 
position may then be laid on the calico with a brush. 

Boots and Shoes. 

Melt together one pint of linseed oil, eight ounces of 
suet, six ounces of beeswax, and one ounce of resin. Ap- 
ply with a brush. 



350 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 



A Chinese Waterproof Composition, 

which has the property of making wood and other sub- 
stances perfectly water-tight, consists of three parts of 
blood deprived of its fibrine, four of lime, and a little 
alum. Cardboard, when covered with the composition, 
becomes as hard as wood. 

Waterproof Packing Paper. 

The paper must first be covered with a resinous liquid, 
then painted over with a solution of glue and soot to 
prevent blotches. After this is dried, the waterproof coat 
is applied. This is prepared with two and a half ounces 
of powdered shellac, dissolved in two pints of water, 
which is gradually brought to boil and stirred until it is 
perfectly dissolved, then gradually add one-third ounce 
of powdered borax and thoroughly mix. llae liquid is 
then left to cool, but while still hot, any mineral color, 
such as lampblack, yellow ochre, &c., may be added, and 
when quite cold it is ready for use. 



VARNISHES. 



A capital colorless varnish for many purposes is 
made thus : — Dissolve two ounces and a half of shellac 
in a pint of rectified spirits of wine, boil for a few min- 
utes with five ounces of well-burnt and recently-heated 
animal charcoal. A small portion should then be filtered, 
and if not colorless, more charcoal must be added. When 
all color is removed, press the liquor through silk, and 
filter through thick blotting paper. This varnish is use- 
ful for drawings and prints that have been sized, and 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 351 

may be used on oil paintings which are thoroughly hard 
and dry ; it brings out the colors. 

Another Picture Varnish 

is made of mastic, twelve ounces ; Venice turpentine, 
two ounces and four drachms ; camphor, thirty grains ; 
pounded glass, four ounces ; and oil of turpentine, three 
and a half pints. Let tlie mastic dissolve with frequent 
agitation, then after setting for some time, pour off the 
clear part, and keep for use. 

Mastic Varnish. 

Take of gum mastic two and a half pounds; pow- 
dered glass, one and a quarter pounds; and turpentine, 
one gallon. Put into a boitle tiiat will hold twice as 
mucli, and shake it at intervals, till the mastic is dis- 
solved. Lastly, filter through bhjtting paper. This re- 
moves the glass, which was used to prevent the mastic 
sticking. 

Mahogany Varnish. 

Take litharge, and powdered dried sugar of lead, of 
each one ounce; clarified oil, nearly a gallon; sorted 
gum animi, two pounds; boil together till it "strings" 
well, then cool a little. Tlien a gallon to a gallon and 
a half of oil of turpentine should be added, mixed, and 
then the whole strained. 

Graining to Imitate Eosewood. 

A good and lasting imitation is thus effected: — A con- 
centrated solution of hypermangate of potassa is spread 
smoothly on the surface of the wood, and allowed to act 
until the desired shade is obtained. Five minutes suffice 



352 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 

ordinarily to give a deep color. A few trials on a spare 
piece of wood will indicate the proper proportions. 
When the action is terminated the wood is carefully 
washed with water, dried, and then, oiled and polished in 
the usual manner. 



Graining to Imitate Oak. 

Take Vandyke brown and chrome yellow, mixed with 
about one part of boiled linseed oil, and two parts tur- 
pentine; add a small quantity of litharge to cause it to 
dry soon. The wood is afterwards glazed. The paint 
used for glazing is a mixture of vandyke brown and 
burnt umber; or lampblack may be substituted for the 
latter. It is drawn lengthways along the wood with a 
small brush, wet with sour beer; there must be no oil 
used in the glazing process. When perfectly dry varnish 
with oak varnish. 

Roofing for Hen-Houses. 

Boil tar in an iron pot, and stir in finely-powdered 
charcoal. Stir constantly until the whole is reduced to 
the consistency of mortar. Spread this with a broad 
wooden trowel, on any wooden roof of outhouses, &c., 
to the thickness of a quarter of an inch. It will resist 
heat and cold, and last for years. 



PREPARED POLISH. 

Take half a pint of best rectified spirits of wine, two 
drachms of shellac, and two drachms of gum-benzoin. 
Put into a bottle ; keep in a warm place till the gum is 
all dissolved, shaking frequently ; when cold, add two 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 353 

teaspoonfuls of best clear white poppy oil ; shake well 
together, and it is fit for use. This is useful for finish- 
ing after using French polish, as it adds to the luster and 
durability, as well as removes every defect, and gives 
the surface a brilliant appearance. 



To Polish Ivory, Bone, &c. 

Take a small quantity of whiting free from grit, mix 
with water to the consistence of cream, and apply with a 
piece of soft rag, rubbing gently till polished, and finish- 
ing with dry whiting. Should any whiting remain be- 
tween the teeth of combs, &c., remove by dipping the 
article in cold water and drying in a cloth. The above 
may also be used to polish and remove scratches from 
the finger nails. 



SILVEEING LOOKING-GLASSES. 

Take a sheet of tin foil, and spread it upon a firm, 
smooth table ; then rub mercury upon it with a hare's 
foot till the two metals incorporate. Lay the plate of 
glass upon it, and load it with weights, Avhich will press 
out the excess of mercury that was applied to the tin foil. 
In a few hours the tin foil will adhere to the glass. Two 
ounces of mercury are sufficient for three square feet of 
glass. Glass globes are silvered thus : To four ounces of 
quicksilver, add as much tinfoil as will become barely 
fluid when mixed. Let the globe be clean and warm, 
and inject the quicksilver by means of an earthen pipe 
at the aperture, turning it about till it is silvered all over. 
Let the remainder run out, and hang the globe up. Take 
care not to inhale the fumes of the quicksilver. 



354 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY, 



BLACKING. 

The only difference between paste blacking and liquid 
blacking for boots and shoes is the quantity of liquid 
put into it. To make it — take ivory black, ground fine, 
four ounces ; treacle, two ounces ; vinegar, three-quar- 
ters of a pint ; spermaceti oil, a teaspoonful. If the in- 
gredients are of the best qualities, this blacking will be 
found exceedingly good. Mix the oil with the blacking 
first, then add the treacle, and lastly the vinegar. Oil of 
vitriol is sometimes used in the making of blacking; 
if used in small quantities it is not injurious, but it is not 
necessary. 

Another Eeceipt is: 

Take four ounces of ivory black, three ounces of the 
coarsest sugar, a tablespoonf ul of sweet oil, and one pint 
of small beer; mix them gradually together cold. 

To Polish Enameled Leather. 

Take milk and linseed oil — in the proportion of two- 
thirds of the former to one-third of the latter — make each 
lukewarm; mix; rub on with a sponge, having previously 
removed all dirt, &c. Rub this off, and keep rubbing 
with a soft dry cloth, until brilliant. 

French Polish for Boots. 

Take half a pound of logwood chips, a quarter of a 
pound of glue, a quarter of an ounce of indigo, pounded 
very fine, a quarter of an ounce of soft soap, and a quar- 
ter of an ounce of isinglass. Boil in two pints of vine- 
gar and one of water for ten minutes after ebullition; 
then strain. When cold, it is fit for use. To ^pply, the 



DOMESTSC CHEMISTRY. 355 

dirt must be washed from the boots; when quite dry put 
the polish on the boots with a sponge. 



Blacking for Harness. 

Melt together four ounces of mutton suet and twelve 
ounces of bees' wax; add twelve ounces of sugar-candy; 
four ounces of soft soap dissolved in water; and two 
ounces of indigo finely powdered. When melted and 
well mixed, add half a pint of turpentine. Lay the 
blacking on the harness with a sponge, and polish off 
with a brush. This blacking is both brilliant and 
durable. 



DISINFECTANTS. 

Perhaps the best disinfectant is Chloralwn, which can 
be cheaply and easily purchased. It is highly to be 
recommended, as safe, sure, and powerful. 

Clilorids of Lime 

is another excellent preventative — half a pound to five 
gallons of water is the quantity i-ecom mended. Aromatic 
vinegar poured upon a heated iron plate is perhaps the 
pleasantcst, and is very good. The cheapest, and at the 
same time one of the most convenient and agreeable of 
all, is common coffee. Pound the well-dried raw bean in 
a mortar, and strew the powder on a moderately heated 
iron plate. Carry through the house a roaster contain- 
ing freshly-burned coffee, and offensive smells will be 
removed. — A fumigating disinfectant is — common salt, 
three ounces; black manganese, oil of vitriol, of each 
one ounce; water, two ounces. Carry it in a cup through 



356 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 

the apartments to be fumigated, and shut up for an hour 
or two. This is especially good in cases of sickness. 

Carbolic Acid 

is used as a disinfectant, and Professor Gamgee has re- 
cently recommended the deliquescent chloride of aluminium ] 
the latter is non-poisonous, free from any odor, prevents 
decomposition, absorbs noxious gases, and destroys para- 
sites and germs. 

Water may be purified 

by stirring into it powdered alum — a teaspoonful to three 
or four gallons. This will precipitate the impurities. 



SEALING WAX. 



Good Bottle wax, for sealing wines, liqueurs, &c., is 
made thus: — Black. — Black resin, six pounds and a half; 
bees' wax, half a pound; finely-powdered ivory black, 
one pound and a half. Melt together. Red. — Substitute 
Venetian red, or red lead, for the ivory black. Green. — 
Green bice or powdered verdigris. Blue. — Indigo. Let- 
ter wax is made thus: — Red. — Shellac (very pale), four 
ounces; cautiously melt in a copper pan over a charcoal 
fire, and when fused add Venice turpentine, one and a 
quarter ounce; mix; and add vermilion, three ounces; re- 
move the pan from the fire, cool a little, weigh it into 
pieces, and roll them into sticks, on a warm stone. Black. 
— Shellac, sixty parts; ivory black in an impalpable pow- 
der, thirty parts; Venice turpentine, twenty parts. Pro- 
ceed as for red wax. Greefi. — Shellac, four parts; Venice 
turpentine, one part; melt gently together and add the 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 357 

proper color; the best greens are powdered verdigris, bice, 
or Scheele's green. 



CEMENT. 

For Marble, Glass, &c. 

Take a small portion of powdered quick-lime, and mix 
with cold linseed oil to the consistency of thin paste. Be 
sure the edges are clean, and apply with a small brush, 
gently pressing the pieces together. This cement is only 
applicable to articles that can remain undisturbed for 
some time, but when set, is most durable. 

A Simple Cement for Marble. 

Clean parts to be joined, put together firmly with 
white lead, and let stand. 

An Excellent Cement for Fastening Knife Handles, &c. 

Take a small quantity of Bath brick-dust, and about 
half the quantity of resin, reduce to a fine powder; fill 
the hole in the handle with the mixture; make the part 
of the knife, &c., to be inserted rather hot (in the fire); 
put it in the handle, and let it remain till set. 

Glue Cement. 

This cement is most useful for joining broken articles 
of a strong nature. Melt one pound of glue without 
water, or with as little as possible; when melted, add one 
pound of resin, and four ounces of either red lead, Vene- 
tian red, or whiting, or ivory black, according to desire. 



358 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 



Parchment Glue. 

Boil a pound of parchment in six quarts of water, 
until the quantity is reduced to one quart. Then pour 
off from the sediment, and boil again till as thick as 
glue. Take out, and keep for use. 



Japanese Cement. 

Mix ground rice with cold water, and gently boil. 
This is a capital paste for paper, &c. 



Glne to ITnite Polished Steel. 

Dissolve five or six bits of gum mastic, each the size 
of a large pea, in as much spirits of wine as will make it 
liquid. In another vessel dissolve in brandy as much 
isinglass, previously softened in water, as will make a 
two-ounce phial of strong glue, adding two small bits of 
gum ammoniac, which must be rubbed until dissolved. 
Then mix the whole with heat. Keep in a phial closely 
stopped. When used, set the phial in boiling water. 



GENERAL EECEIPTS. 

Test for Gold and Silver. 

A test often employed by jewelers, is to slightly wet 
the metal, and gently rub it with a piece of lunar caustic, 
fixed with a pointed piece of wood. If the metal be 
pure gold or silver, the mark will be faint; but if of an 
inferior metal, it will turn quite black. 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 359 



To Make Glasses Very Brilliant. 

Wash in strong tepid soda-water, rinse in plain cold 
water, and dry with a linen cloth witJwui nap. 



Skeleton Leaves. 

Mix a tablespoonful of chloride of lime, in a liquid 
state, in a quart of spring water; steep the leaves in this 
for about four hours — strong-ribbed leaves will require a 
little longer, — then take out and wash well in cold water; 
they must then dry in the light. 

A Longer and More Delicate Process 

is to steep the leaves in rain water, in an open vessel, ex- 
posed to the air and sun. Water must occasionally be 
added to compensate loss by evaporation. The leaves 
will putrefy, and then their membranes will begin to open; 
then lay them on a clean white plate, filled with clean 
water, and with gentle touches take off the external mem- 
branes, separating them cautiously near the middle rib. 
When there is an opening towards the latter, the whole 
membrane separates easily. The process requires a great 
deal of patience, as ample time must be given for the 
vegetable tissues to decay and separate. 

To Dry Flowers. 

Take some fine white sand; wash repeatedly till all 
dirt is removed, and the water remains clear; dry 
thoroughly, and half fill a stone flower-pot; in this, stick 
freshly-gathered flowers when dry, and cover the flowers 
over completely, so that no part of them can be seen, and 
take care not to injure the leaves. Place the vessel in 
the sun, or in a room where a fire is kept, and let it re- 



36o DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 

main until the flowers are perfectly dry; then carefully 
remove the sand, and clean with a feather brush. The 
process succeeds best with single flowers. 

[To Dry Grass and Moss. 

Proceed as for leaves. To Dye them: — For pink, get 
some logwood and ammonia, boil together in water; for 
red, logwood and alum; for blue, indigo; and all other 
colors that will dissolve. To keep the grass together, dip 
it in a weak solution of gum-water; or put some gum- 
water in the dye, which will answer the same purpose. 

To Whiten Pianoforte Keys. 

Leave the instrument open to the sun and air, and the 
keys will rarely discolor; dust carefully, and when at all 
soiled wash the keys thus: — wring a wash-leather per- 
fectly tight out of tepid water, and wipe the keys; dry 
with a cloth, free from nap, and polish with a silk hand- 
kerchief. 

To Remove Pitch or Paint from the Hands. 

Apply salad oil, or grease of any kind; well rub to- 
gether before the fire till the oil and pitch are blended; 
then wash in warm soap and water. 

The above will remove these stains from any wash- 
ing fabric. 

To Clean Jugs, Decanters, &c,, from Fur. 

Take a little very weak aquafortis, and pour carefully 
into the decanter, &c., replace the stopper (a cork is bet- 
ter), and shake the vessel thoroughly till all the crust is 
removed; should this fail after a thorough trial, take 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 361 

strong potash or soda-water, and repeat the experiment. 
Afterwards rinse in cold water. Take care no spots of 
either acid or potash fall on the clothing. 



Another Way. 

They may be washed with tea-leaves and strong soda- 
water; and then rinsed with cold water. 



To Clean Sewing Machines. 

When clogged with oil, procure a little benzoline (of 
the kind usually employed to take grease spots out of 
silk, &c.), and drop a small quantity into those portions 
of the machine generally oiled; when this is done, treadle 
the machine for a few minutes, and when the oil is soft- 
ened wipe perfectly clean with a soft rag, and oil as 
usual. An apron spread over the dress is desirable 
during the above process. 



Bird-lime. 

Gather some holly in the summer, and take the mid- 
dle bark; boil for six or eight hours, in water, until 
tender ; then drain off the water, and place in a pit 
underground, in layers with fern, and surround with 
stones. Leave to ferment for two or three weeks, until 
it forms a sort of mucilage, which must be pounded in a 
mortar, into a mass, and well rubbed between the hands 
in running water, until all the refuse is worked out; then 
place it in an earthen vessel, and leave for four or five 
days to ferment and purify itself. Turpentine will re- 
move any of the lime that may stick to the hands.

Size for Prints. 

Take a quarter of a pound each of pale glue and curd 
soap; dissolve in three pints of hot water. 

Feathers are Curled 

by the ribs being scraped with a bit of circular glass in 
order to render them pliant; and then by drawing the 
edge of a blunt knife over the filaments, they assume a 
curly form. 

To Fix Pencil Drawings. 

Take pale resin, and dissolve it in spirits of wine; lay 
the drawing on its face on a sheet of clean paper, and 
brush the back of the drawing with the solution. This 
penetrates through the paper, and as the spirit evaporates, 
the resin is deposited as a varnish on the drawing. This 
will not answer with card, or anything thick; but a weak 
solution of isinglass may be placed in a shallow dish, 
and the drawing passed through it, so as to wet every 
part. 



HAIR DYE. 



No method has yet been made public which answers 
the desired purpose, and is at the same time attended by 
no inconvenience. The basis of most of the powders is 
quicklime, and tliat of the lotions, nitrate of silver. The 
powder is thus made: — Dip six ounces of quicklime in 
water, and when it has fallen to pieces, pound it, and 
sift it through a fine sieve; then add four ounces of lith- 
arge, and two of starch, also sifted; this is made into a 
paste with warm water, and the hair is completely cov- 
ered with it, after which an oilskin cap is bound on, and 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. z^^i 

allowed to remain tlie whole night. The hair is washed 
on the following day with soap and water, and then 
oiled. This gives a deep black, but with rather a 
purple hue; by increasing the starch, the shade will be 
lighter. The hair lotion or water is made as follows: — 
Pour upon half an ounce of pure silver three-quarters of 
an ounce of nitric acid, and expose to sharp heat to dis- 
solve the silver; decant the liquid, and add half a pint of 
water; by increasing the quantity of water lighter shades 
are obtained. The practice of dyeing the hair is un- 
worthy of civilization; it is a sham and a cheat, and the 
time will come when a woman with dyed hair will be 
considered as contemptible an object as a guardsman in 
stays. 

To Darken the Hair. 

Nitrate of silver (lunar caustic) is the agent com- 
monly employed in hair dyes. A leaden comb is also 
recommended by some ; but the introduction of silver or 
lead into the system through the tubes of the hair is al- 
ways somewhat dangerous. A better wash for darkening 
the hair may be made from a solution of the green husks of 
walnuts, applied with a brush as frequently as necessary. 
There are no other vegetable hair dyes of any certain 
value. 



DEPILATOEIES. 



Nostrums to remove superfluous hairs from the face 
or neck are all more or less dangerous, and should only 
be used under the advice of a surgeon. The following, 
are, however, the least harmful : — 

To Remove Superfluous Hair. 

Saturate the skin with olive oil, and let remain one 
hour; then wipe it off and apply the following mixture 



364 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 

with a brush : — One ounce finely powdered quicklime, 
one drachm powdered orpiment, mixed with white of egg. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 

WasMng Colored Linens, Muslins, &e. 

They should not be soaked or soaped over night. 
When ready for washing, put into cold water and wash 
very speedily; if very dirty, the water may be lukewarm, 
and no more. Do not use the smallest particle of soda. 
The best soap is common yellow. The soap should not 
be allowed to remain any time on, and the linen must 
not lie in the water any length of time. One article 
should be washed at a time, and immediately rinsed, the 
others remaining in a dry state by the side of the tub. 
The rinsing water should be cold, soft water, with salt in 
it. When an article is taken from the rinsing tub, it 
should be wrung very gently. Silk pocket-handkerchiefs 
require to be washed by themselves. Handkerchiefs con- 
taining snuff should be put to soak by themselves in 
lukewarm water. Three hours after, they should be 
rinsed out and put to soak with the others in cold water 
for a couple of hours. They should then be washed out 
in lukewarm water, being soaped as they are washed. If 
all the stains are not out, they must be washed through 
a second water. When finished, they should be rinsed 
in cold, soft water, with salt. They may be rinsed alto- 
gether, thrown into a dry tub, and from thence into the 
rinsing tub with the others. 

To Wash Blankets. 
Cut a pound of yellow soap into thin slices, and place 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 365 

them, or as much as will be required, in the copper with 
water, and boil. Pour into a tub and add cold water to 
the required warmth, put in blanket and wash well with 
hand or dolly; repeat, adding a little blue with the hot 
water; wring tight and shake well. 



To Wash Damask Curtains. 

Shake the dust ofif, lay in cold water to free from 
smoke, use boiled soap as in blankets, and wash in tepid 
water, then rinse in cold water with a handful of salt 
thrown into it. 

To Wash Carpets, 

Sweep the carpet thoroughly, take a large pail of hot 
water, colored with blue, if any white in it; wet about 
half a yard of the carpet, rub it well with a piece of soap, 
then use a hard brush, wash off with clean flannel, and 
dry with a coarse cloth. Repeat on other parts. Do not 
wet the carpet too much, and have the water frequently 
changed. 

To Clean Ermine Fur. 

Take out the linings and stuffings, lay the fur fiat on 
a table covered with clean cloth. Take a piece of fine 
whiting and rub it into the fur; shake thoroughly, and re- 
peat again till clean. Rub well with a clean towel. 

To Renovate Black Cloths. 

Carefully clean from dust; take out any spots of grease 
with turpentine, the smell of which may be destroyed by 
essence of lemon. Boil a few chips of logwood in a little 
water, and sponge the cloth with it; or, make a strong 
infusion of galls, and a solution of copperas or green 



366 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 

vitriol, or sulphate of iron, and either moisten the parts 
separately, or mix the liquids in a phial. 



To Cleanse Glass Vessels from Petroleum. 

Wash the vessel with thin milk of lime, which forms 
an emulsion with the petroleum, and removes every trace 
of it; wash a second time with milk of lime and a small 
quantity of chloride of lime, and the smell will be com- 
pletely removed. If the milk of lime be used warm, in- 
stead of cold, the operation is rendered much shorter. 



To Engrave on Glass. 

This process requires great care. Cover one side of 
a flat piece of glass, after having made it perfectly clean, 
with bees'-wax, then draw the design with some sharp- 
pointed instrument, taking care that every stroke cuts 
completely tiirough the wax. Make a border of wax all 
round the glass ; take finely-powdered fluate of lime 
(tiuor spar), strew evenly over the plate and then gently 
pour upon it, not to displace the powder, sulphuric acid, 
diluted with thrice its weight of water, to cover it. Let 
remain for three hours, then remove; clean the glass with 
oil of turpentine. The figures which were traced through 
the wax will be found engraved on the glass, while the 
parts which the wax covered will be uncorroded. Be 
very careful in the management of the acid, as if too 
strong it will eat through the glass. 



Fixing Glass in Stone Windows. 

Portland cement, though often used, is not so good 
as a mixture of Bath stone dust and linseed oil, made up 
like putty. 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 367 



The "Furry" Deposit in Tea-kettles 

may be removed by a very weak solution of muriatic, 
nitric, or acetic acid, which will immediately dissolve it 
witli effervescence. Care must be taken to remove tlu: 
acid as soon as the deposit is dissolved, or it would at- 
tack the iron. After the operation boil water in the 
kettle some days before using. 

Bazor Paste. 

Mix together, and rub over the strop, two parts of 
emery, reduced to an impalpable powder, and one part 
of spermaceti ointment. 

Plate Powder. 

Mix together four ounces of prepared chalk, and two 
ounces each of polisher's putty and burnt hartshorn. 

Asphalt Pavement 

for garden walks, floors for sheds, &c., is thus laid down: 
— The place must be leveled; then put on it a coat of 
tar, and sift some road sand or coal ashes all over it very 
thickly; when dry repeat the operation four times. You 
will then have a dry, hard path. 

Plant-Sticks, &c., 

may be preserved by dipping the portions which are in- 
serted in the ground two or three times in hot tar. Hot 
asphalt is better, but both are excellent preservatives. 

Another Way. 
Char the ends in the fire till black.

To Bender Wood TJninfiammable. 

Place the wood unplaned for twenty-four hours in a 
liquid composed of one part of concentrated silicate of 
potassa and three of pure water. After being removed 
and dried for several days, soak it again in this liquid, 
and after being again dried, paint over witli a mixture 
of part of cement, and four parts of the above liquid; 
when the first coat of this paint is dry, repaint twice. 

To Prevent Rust on Iron. 

Immerse the iron for a few minutes in a solution of 
carbonate of potash or soda. 

To Preserve Iron and Steel. 

Coat with melted sulphur, the sulphur chills and sets 
into a hard, thin, protecting covering. 

A Preservative against Lead Poisoning. 

The use of milk at meals preserves those employed 
in lead works from any symptoms of lead disease. To 
preserve the purity of water passing through leaden 
pipes, insert an internal lining of block tin. 

Drying of "Wood. 

The drying of all kinds of timber by artificial means 
should be effected slowly, and the temperature moderate 
to begin with; for small pieces, such as are used for join- 
ers and furniture-makers, place in dry sand, and heat to 
100° — the sand acts as an absorber of the moisture as 
well as a diffuser of the heat. 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 369 



Danger from Union of Metals. 

The pipes leading to a leaden cistern should be of lead; 
if of iron and connected with an iron boiler, a kind of 
galvanic battery is formed, which will gradually destroy 
the boiler. 

To Detect Logwood in Wine. 

Take a strip of good filtering paper, and 'place it in 
an aqueous solution of neutral acetate of copper, and 
then dry. Dip the paper into the wine, and the adher- 
ing drops should be made to run backwards and for- 
wards on the paper, then quickly but carefully dry. If 
the wine be free from logwood, the color shown will be 
grey or rose-red greyish, but if logwood is present the 
tinge will be sky-blue. 

To Detect Arsenic. 

Mix the arsenious liquid with hydrochloric acid until 
fumes appear ; chloride of tin is then added, which pro- 
duces a basic precipitate, containing the greater part of 
the arsenic as metal, mixed with oxide of tin. 

Imperishable Putty. 

Mix together ten pounds of whiting and one pound 
of white lead, with the necessary quantity of boiled lin- 
seed oil, adding a wine-glassful of best sweet oil. This 
last prevents the white lead from hardening. 

To Preserve Wood. 

Mix one pound of chloride of zinc with five gallons 
of water. Steep the wood in this solution.

the hair upon the grass for several days, that it may be 
alternately exposed to dew and sun. Light hair will 
bleach this way. Dark hair should be sent to a professed 
bleacher, as many of the means used destroy the gloss. 

Light Mahogany — to Darken. 

If in repairing old furniture lighter pieces of wood 
are introduced, they may be darkened by washing with 
a weak solution of quicklime. 

Green Paint. 

An economical and capital paint for summer-houses, 
&c., is made thus : — Take four pounds of Roman vitriol, 
and pour on it boiling water ; when dissolved add two 
pounds of pearlash, and stir the mixture well with a 
stick until the effervescence ceases ; then add a quarter 
of a pound of pulverized yellow arsenic, and stir the 
whole together. 

Inodorous Faint. 

A composition for mixing with lead and other colors 
to form a paint, in lieu of linseed oil, turpentine, and the 
usual driers, has lately been patented. The material con- 
sists of methylated spirit, shellac, and castor-oil ; it dries 
very quickly and is without smell.

Imitation Ivory. 

Make into a paste isinglass, brandy, and powdered 
egg-shells. Color as you desire, cast it, warm, into an 
oiled mold ; in a few hours it will be firmly set. 



Gun Cotton Ivory. 

Camphor, triturated with gun cotton, and subjected to 
hydraulic pressure, produces a hard white substance, 
which, if coated with a compound of gun cotton and cas- 
tor oil, resembles ivory, to which for many purposes it 
is superior. 

Fire-Proof Stucco. 

The following has been found to answer. Take moist 
gravelly earth (previously washed), and make it into 
stucco with this composition; mix well one part of com- 
mon clay with two parts of pearlash and five parts of 
water. 

Leakage in Hot Water Pipes. 

Mix iron borings and filings with vinegar and a little 
sulphuric acid; let stand till it becomes paste. Dry the 
pipe, fill in the cracks with this mixture, and keep the 
pipe dry until hard. This cement lasts a long time. 

Alabaster Ornaments. 

"When these have become discolored, they may be 
cleansed by the fumes of chlorine, applied for a short 
time, and afterwards being bleached in the sun, and then 
being sprinkled over v.ith a diluted solution of chlorin- 
ated soda, commonly called chloride of soda. Care must 



372 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 

be taken not to expose the alabaster too long to the ac- 
tion of the chlorine, or its color will be injured; and the 
fumes, being dangerous, must not be inhaled. 

Durable Paste. 

Take common flour paste, rather thick, add a little 
brown sugar and corrosive sublimate, which will prevent 
fermentation, and a few drops of oil of lavender, which 
will prevent moldiness. When this paste dries it resem- 
bles horn, and may be used again by adding water. This 
paste will keep well for years if kept in a covered pot, 
and is always ready for use. 

Transfer Papers. 

A useful transfer paper may be made for copying 
monumental inscriptions, brasses, &c., by rubbing a mix- 
ture of black-lead and soap over silver paper. 

To Preserve Steel from Rusting. 

Smear it over with hot melted fresh mutton suet; be- 
fore it cools and hardens, have some powdered unslacked 
lime in a muslin bag, and dust it over the hot suet which 
covers the steel. 

Easily-made Storm-Glass. 

Take two drachms of camphor, half drachm of pure 
nitrate of potash (niter or saltpeter), and half drachm of 
muriate of ammonia (sal-ammoniac), and pound them 
together in a mortar, until they are thoroughly pulver- 
ized. The operation may be assisted by adding a few 
drops of alcohol. When well powdered, the mixture is 
to be dissolved in about two ounces of alcohol, and put 



DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 373 

into a tall phial, or into a glass tube of about ten inches 
in height and three-fourths of an inch in diameter, the 
mouth of which is to be covered with a bit of bladder or 
the like, perforated with a pin. The instrument is then 
complete. It gives the following z^^Z/V^/^V/zi-.- — If the at- 
mosphere be dry and the weather promising to be fine, 
all the solid part of the composition which appears in 
the glass will be closely collected at the bottom, and the 
liquor above will be quite clear; but on the approach to 
a change to rain, the solid matter will appear gradually 
to rise, and small crystalline stars will be observed to 
float about in the liquid, which, however, will remain 
othei'wise pellucid. On the approach of winds, flocks of 
the composition, apparently in the form of a leaf, will 
appear on the surface of the liquid, which in this case 
will seem thick and in a state of fermentation. These 
indications often begin to exhibit themselves twenty- 
four hours before the actual breaking forth of the storm. 
The quarter of the compass from which the wind blows 
will always be indicated by the solid particles lying 
more closely to the opposite side of the glass. During 
the winter, the composition is rendered white by a mul- 
titude of small white stars. 



Home-made Barometer., 

Fill a large, wide-mouthed pickle bottle with cold 
water to within two or three inches of the top. Then 
take a long-necked flask, and plunge the neck into the 
bottle as far-as it will go, and the barometer is made. In 
fine weather the water will rise into the neck of the flask 
even higher than the pickle bottle. In wet and windy 
weather it will fall to within an inch of the mouth of the 
flask. Before a heavy gale of wind the water will prob- 
ably leave the flask altogether hours before the gale 
comes to its height. 



374 DOMESTIC CHEMISTRY. 



Galvanic Battery, 

Take a large glass or stone jar, with the mouth cut 
off evenly, and put another cylindrical vessel, of porous 
porcelain, inside it; fill the vessel vidth diluted sulphuric 
acid, and the space betv^een the two with sulphate of 
copper, a solution of the salt of gold, silver, &c., accord- 
ing to what you want to plate the article; put a slip of 
zinc in the sulphuric acid, and attach a copper wire to it, 
and the other end of the wire to the medal or article you 
wish to plate, and immerse that in the other solution. 
Your battery is now complete. A little grease rubbed 
on any part of the medal will prevent the solution plat- 
ing the greased portion. 

Magic Lantern Slides 

are easily painted by observing these few directions: — 
Draw on paper the subject you intend to paint, and fix 
it at each end to the glass; trace the outlines of the 
design with a fine hair pencil in strong tint in their 
proper colors, and when these are dry, fill up in their 
proper tints; shade with black, bistre, and vandyke 
brown, as you find convenient. The colors used are 
transparent, lake, sap-green, Prussia blue, distilled ver- 
digris, gamboge, &c., ground in oil, and tempered with 
mastic varnish. Copal varnish may be used in the dark 
shades. 

Mops 

are best washed in with the following colors: — Yellow; 
gamboge dissolved in water. — Red; Brazil dust steeped 
in vinegar, and alum added; or, cochineal steeped in 
water, strained and gum arable added. — Blue; Saxon 
blue diluted with water. — Green; distilled verdigris dis- 
solved in water, and gum added; or, sap-green dissolved 
in water, and alum added. 



CLOTHING. 



What Should be Worn Next the Skin. 

The primary consideration in dress is — what should 
be worn next to the skin ? We answer — wool, decidedly, 
and for the following reasons : — Linen, by all its com- 
pactness, retains the perspired matter, so that shirts worn 
for some days will exhale a sensation of coolness, indi- 
cating an obstructed circulation. Silk attracts less 
humidity than linen, and is, therefore, still more object- 
ionable. Wool, by the gentle friction and moderate heat 
whicli it excites, promotes perspiration, and absorbs the 
matter thrown out from the skin, without clogging the 
pores. Cotton increases warmth and perspiration ; but 
having the property of retaining the discharged humors, 
is too apt to throw the same back again into the system, 
and thereby hurting the animal fluids. It is, however, 
during active exercise that the different effects of the 
substances are more plainly seen. When the body is 
covered with woolen, though perspiration is increased, 
the matter thrown out passes through the flannel into 
the air, leaving the skin dry and warm. If, under the 
same circumstances, linen is worn, the perspiration, in- 
stead of being dispersed, remains, and causes a disagree- 
able sensation. Flannel has also this advantage : those 
who perspire profusely will not easily catch cold on go- 
ing into the open air. This is not the case with linen shirts, 

[375] 



376 CLOTHING. 

which will produce chilliness, followed by fever. Flannel 
when first used is apt to irritate the skin, and so cause an 
uneasy feeling ; this soon goes off, and it becomes at 
length comfortable and even pleasant. Flannel is suit- 
able to all seasons. Worsted socks and stockings, varied 
in thickness, according to the season, are on all accounts 
the best. 

In Choosing Cloth For Clothes. 

see that the fabric is fine and the texture close and even. 
Pass the hand lightly in the contrary direction to the 
nap, and if the feel is soft and silky without harshness, 
you may conclude the cloth is made of fine wool. Very 
" satiny " cloths spot with the rain. Take up a piece of 
cloth in both hands, and fold a little piece between the 
thumb and forefinger of one hand ; pull the cloth sharp- 
ly with the other hand, and if the sound produced by the 
slipping of the fold is clear and sharp, the cloth is of 
good quality. Do not choose large patterns if you are 
short, and if you are stout do not wear checks or plaids. 

Clothes for Traveling. 

Every traveler should wear flannel next the skin both 
in hot and cold climates. Linen is very improper, for 
when the wearer is wet with rain or perspiration, it 
strikes cold to the skin; coarse calico sheets, for fine, hot, 
dry weather, and flannel for damp, windy, or cold, may 
be considered generally appropriate. A poncho is very 
useful, for it is a sheet as well as a cloak, being simply a 
blanket with a slit in the middle to admit the wearer's 
head. Cloth is made waterproof, as directed {see receipt), 
and also by rubbing soapsuds into the wrong side, and 
working well in; when dry do the same with a solution 
of alum. A thick tweed shooting costume is the most 
comfortable and best dress for all except damp or tropi- 
cal climates. If you are likely to have much riding, lea- 
ther or moleskin trousers are useful, or tvveed trousers 



CLOTHING. 377 

may be covered down the insidesof the legs with leather. 
A blouse or jacket, cut short to clear the saddle, is capital 
either for walking or riding. Another "indispensable" 
is a thick lined dressing-gown. It is equally good to 
wear in the evening and for sleeping in. Thick worsted 
socks only should be worn, whether the climate be hot or 
cold. It is important to keep the clothes as dry as pos- 
sible, and if on the water a capital plan is to dip the wet 
clothes in the salt water, wring them out, and put them 
on again. This, we are told on good authority, feels like 
a change of dry clothes. 

To Brush Clothes. 

If a coat be wet let it be quite dry before brushing it. 
Rub out the spots of dirt with the hands, beat it lightly 
with a small cane. Then lay it out on a board or table, 
the collar to the left hand, and brush, briskly and 
smoothly, the right way of the cloth. Brush first the 
shoulders, back and sleeves, and then the skirts. Last 
the insides and the collar. Waistcoats and trousers are 
brushed straight down, taking care they are quite dry, 
and rubbing out spots of mud, &c., before brushing 
down. You should have two brushes, one hard and the 
other soft, the former of which should be used as little 
as possible, and never for "faced" cloth. Should there 
be spots of tallow-grease on the clothes, take it off with 
the nail; or, if that cannot be done, take a hot iron, cover 
the part where the grease is with some thick brown 
paper, and run the iron over the spot. This will draw 
the grease into the paper. Repeat this process until no 
more grease comes. Ordinary grease-spots or marks on 
the collar or lappels may generally be removed by a 
little soft soap, or a little ox-gall or curd soap. Fruit 
and wine stains may frequently be taken out by holding 
the part over an ordinary brimstone match, lighted; or 
by water with a little salts of lemon, muriatic or oxalic 



378 CLOTHING, 

acid in it. These last must not, however, be applied to 
delicate colors. For the stains of acids wash the part 
with a little spirits of hartshorn or liquid ammonia. Ox- 
gall is one of the most valuable articles for cleansing 
woolen and other articles: it combines readily with ail 
greasy substances, and assists powerfully the action of 
soap, which may in many cases be dispensed with. Silks 
and all other articles of even the most delicate colors 
may be cleaned with it. The chief objection to its use is 
its disagreeable smell; this is got rid of thus: Boil a 
quart of the gall, skimming it frequently, then add one 
ounce of powdered alum ; leave on the fire until thorough- 
ly combined. Set the mixture to cool, and pour it, whea 
cold, into a bottle which is to be loosely corked. Pro- 
ceed exactly in the same way with another quart of gall, 
using one ounce of common salt instead of alum. The 
two bottles are to be put by for three months in a room 
of moderate temperature; a thick sediment will be de- 
posited, but, as a good deal of yellow coloring matter 
still remains, the contents of the two bottles, carefully 
poured off from the sediment, are to be filtered sepa- 
rately, and then mixed in equal parts, a portion at a time. 
The coloring matter will be precipitated, leaving the gall 
perfectly pure and colorless. It is then to be again fil- 
tered, bottled and tightly corked, and kept in a cool place 
for use. In this state it preserves all its detergent prop- 
erties, is free from smell, and does not spoil with keeping. 

Mending Clothes. 

Things neatly mended last four times as long as those 
carelessly repaired. Too much pains cannot, therefore, 
be expended on the prosaic but very necessary operation 
of " mending clothes." A piece of each material should 
be reserved, in making up dresses, &c., for repairing 
when needed. All things should be periodically ex- 
amined, and rents sewn up before they go farther. When 



CLOTHING. 379 

the linen is looked out for the wash it should be ex- 
amined to see if there is anytliing vvron<^, and after wash- 
ing, &c., all buttons should be looked to, and made tight 
and secure. If chamber towels are wearing thin in the 
center, cut them in halves, sew the edges together, and 
hem the cut — now the outside edges. Sew up torn lin- 
ings, rebind frayed edges, and replace broken strings, but- 
tons, and hooks, directly seen, or the trouble will be 
greatly increased. Never forget the well-known aphor- 
ism, *' A stitch in time saves nine." 

Altering Clothes. 

In altering clothes for children from those of adults 
take the pattern of the best fitting things and copy exactly. 
Some practice, knowledge, and physical strength are re- 
quired to do this tailors' work, and therefore without 
these essentials it had better be left alone. The right 
way to proceed cannot be taught in books, and even when 
learned is seldom worth the trouble. 

Clothes Closets, Drawers, &c. 

When moths have infested these places rub them well 
with a strong decoction of tobacco, and sprinkle them 
often v/ith spirits of camphor. 

Black Clothes 

may be restored if threadbare about the elbows, cuffs, 
knees, &c., by the following process: — The clothes must 
be soaked in cold water for half an. hour, then taken out 
of the water, and put on a board, and the threadbare parts 
of the clothes rubbed with a teazel, or half-worn hatter's 
"card," filled with flocks. When this is done, hang the 
coat up to dry, and with a hard brush lay the nap the 
right way. This is said to be the method which is pur- 



38o CLOTHING. 

sued by the dealers in old clothes, and it greatly improves 
the appearance of the garments. 

Ladies' Dress. 

The secret of dressing well, simply consists in know- 
ing the three grand unities of dress — your own position, 
age, and peculiarities, and no woman can dress well who 
does not. Dress should be simple, elegant and becoming, 
without appearing so expensive as to evidently be be- 
yond the circumstances of the wearer. Consider well be- 
fore you purchase whether the new silk, bonnet, shawl, 
or ribbon matches your complexion, is adapted to your 
height and figure, and above all, that it is graceful and 
pretty — not merely fashionable. You must also adapt, 
as much a possible, your new purchases to the things you 
alread)' have, so as to show no bad contrasts. Dress with 
regard to your station in life, your age, and your ap- 
pearance. 

Children's Clothing 

should be well-cut, but sufficiently loose to allow fair 
play to the limbs. Nothing is so absurd, as to dress 
a babe or young child in tight garments; but they 
should be of materials suited to the season. It is not 
necessary to give directions for the cutting or making 
of children's dresses, as almost every mother or elder 
sister knows how to cut out and make simple frocks, 
jackets, &c., and when that knowledge has not been 
obtained in youth, a i^w lessons from a practical dress- 
maker will suffice. Carefully avoid the absurdity of 
swaddling a child's body in lieaps of flannel and warm 
stuffs, and leaving its legs and arms bare. Too many 
clothes, however, are as mischievous as too few. Contrast 
in colors is of no slight importance. Liglit colors and 
thin materials for summer; bright warm colors, and 
stout cloth for winter. The head should be cool, and 



CLOTHING. 381 

the feet well shod. Long clothes and caps for infants 
are happily going out of fashion, and a more rational 
style of dress adopted by all sensible mothers. 

Tight Lacing. 

Avoid all tight bandages — as stays, garters, belts, &c. 
They impede the free circulation of the blood, and in 
thousands of cases produce disease and deformity. 
More harm has been done by tight-lacing, than by all 
the other vagaries of fashion put together. 

The Covering of the Head 

should be very light, as well for men as for women, 
and if children were more often allowed to go bare- 
headed into the open air, the practice would much in- 
vigorate their constitutions, and render them less sus- 
ceptible of cold. No one, however, should go uncov- 
ered in sunshine. Black hats, though generally worn, 
are not so good a defense against the power of the 
sun as hats or caps of any other color. 

Keep Your Feet "Warm. 

If you do not do this, the blood accumulates towards 
the head, and sensation of chilliness is felt over the 
whole body, and the general comfort interfered with. 



DOMESTIC PETS. 



DOGS. 

All dogs require clean, warm, but well ventilated 
beds, pure water, and plain, fresh food. If your dog- 
does not have sufficient exercise, give him now and then 
a teaspoonful of flour of sulphur mixed with his food. 
When his nose is cold and wet he is generally in good 
health, and vice versa. The more common diseases, and 
their mode of treatment, ai-e given below. 

Fits. Often caused in young dogs by over-feeding ; 
give a spare but nourishing diet, and plenty of exercise. 

Distemper. Nearly every dog has this disease once, 
and usually betAveen his fourth and tenth months. Mr. 
Johnson, a practical writer on the subject, says : — "On 
the approach of this canine scourge the dog will be dull, 
his eyes Avill appear less bright than usual, a languidness 
will pervade his whole system, and his appetite will fail, 
or he may perhaps refuse his food altogether ; he will 
be also troubled with a great degree of constipation — 
this is the first stage of the disease in question. The dis- 
temper makes its way by inflammation, accompanied by 
costiveness ; and, therefore, reason clearly points out the 
necessity of checking the one and removing the other. 
Bleed the animal immediately, and give him a tablespoon- 
[382] 



DOMESTIC PETS. 3S3 

ful of syrup of buckthorn, which will most likely answer 
the purpose effectually ; if, after the lapse of a few days, 
the dog does not appear perfectly recovered, repeat the 
bleeding and the pliysic ; a third time if found necessary, 
which will not often happen — not once in five hundred 
cases. 

" By the process above described the disease is checked 
and subdued in the first instance, and as it cannot, when 
thus opposed, acquire strength, is therefore easily van- 
quished or dissipated. Such a mode of treatment is in- 
contestably supported by reason, since nothing can tend 
so effectually to check inflammation as lowering the 
system. The animal should be bled very freely — in fact, 
it almost impossible to take too much blood from a dog 
under these circumstances. Supposing the subject to be 
a stout pointer whelp, seven or eight months old, about 
five ounces of blood should be taken from him. A table- 
spoonful of syrup of buckthorn will be found a proper 
dose for such an animal, and tlie quantity may be varied 
according to the age and strength of the patient. The 
operation of bleeding a dog should be thus performed: — 
Place a cord round the animal's neck, and draw it suffi- 
ciently tight so as to throw up or elevate the jugular 
vein; puncture it longitudinally (not cross-wise) with a 
common lancet, and, for the purpose of causing the blood 
to flow, the finger should be pressed on the vein a little 
below the orifice. When sufficient blood has been drawn, 
the puncture need not be pinned, nor in any way be 
closed, as the dog, by holding down his head, draws the 
lips of the wound together, and the blood forms a crust 
upon it immediately; hence the reason of puncturing 
the vein longitudinally, since, if cut cross-wise, the dog 
will pull the wound open every time he holds down his 
head, particularly in feeding." For small pet dogs a 
milder cure is Dr. James' powders, given in milk, water, 
or jam. 



384 DOMESTIC PETS. 

Colds. Keep the dog warm and clean, and administer 
a purgative. 

To Destroy Fleas. Wash and rinse well in- strong to- 
bacco water, taking care to avoid the eyes. 

Mange. The common mange is brought on by damp, 
dirt, and bad or unwholesome food. It is very con- 
tagious, but easy of cure. Rub Vvcll in (with your gloved 
hand) an ointment made of equal proportions of sulphur 
vivam, oil of tar, and train oil. Repeat the process every 
two or three days until well. The dog must not be per- 
mitted to lick himself while he has this disease. An oc- 
casional dose of flowers of sulphur may be given with 
his food. The red mange is incurable — destroy the dog. 

In giving a dog a powder or pill, put it in a piece of 
meat; he will swallow it without suspecting you. To 
give him liquid physic, take the dog between the knees, 
and, when some other person has the dose ready, open 
his mouth quietly hxxt firmly, keeping the tongue down, 
speaking kindly to the dog meanwhile; then let a little of 
the physic be poured into his mouth, which you imme- 
diately close, as dogs cant swallow with their mouths open. 
Repeat this operation with firmness, but as little fuss as 
possible and no punishment, until all the dose is taken. 

The best food for small dogs is the meat biscuits, 
supplemented by any scraps or pieces. Larger dogs 
may want "paunch" — which must be boiled — and other 
animal food ; but don't give him the disgusting stuff 
called and hawked about the streets as "dogs' meat." 

CATS. 

Few persons are aware that there are several distinct 
varieties of the domestic cat — as the Persian, the Angola, 
the Spanish, the Chinese, and the Angora. All, however, 
have certain characteristics in common. They are very 



DOMESTIC PETS. 385 

prolific, fond of the house rather than its master or mis- 
tress, have a great dislike to dirt and are inveterate ene- 
mies to rats and mice. But little care is required to 
render a cat a tame and pleasant companion; but if you 
have a garden you must not grow valerian in it, for this 
aromatic plant is such a favorite with puss that it will 
attract to your garden all the cats in the neighborhood; 
and they will not desist till tiiey have rolled over and 
scratched every bit of valerian out of the bed. Cats 
should not have too great a profusion of animal food, or 
they will get fat and lazy; but a due proportion of fish 
and household scraps may be advantageously given 
them with skim milk and water. Good mousers should 
not be petted too much, nor allowed to stray about the 
streets. Belonging to the tiger family, cats are often 
sly, treacherous, and vicious; and no amount of training 
will prevent some of them seizing your favorite canary 
or gold fish and making a surreptitious meal of the 
dainty morsel. Cats are subject to but few ailments, and 
if carefully looked after live for many years. 

RABBITS. 

These animals are both profitable and amusing. They 
should be kept very clean and regularly fed. One im- 
portant rule as to food is, never to give wet vegetables, which 
are absolutely poisonous to them. Abundant food is the 
main thing ; and next to that variety. They should have 
oats once a day. The leaves and roots of carrots, all 
sorts of peas and beans, the leaves and branches of trees, 
wild succory, parsley, clover, brewers' dry grains, apple 
parings, peas-haulm, dock-leaves, sorrel, may be their 
diet during summer ; and hay, potatoes, artichokes, tur- 
nips, beet root, &c., during the winter. The best way to 
begin rabbit-keeping is to obtain a number of young 
ones fairly weaned, at about nine or ten weeks old. Wild 
young rabbits, called warren rabbits, will not do, for 
17 



386 DOMESTIC PETS. 

they cannot be domesticated, and run away at tlie earliest 
opportunity. The hutches should be dr)-^, light, well 
ventilated, and strong ; well raised from tlie ground. 
The doe's hutch must have a partition about twelve 
inches from one end, and a hole must be cut at the ex- 
tremity nearest the front, about an inch and a lialf from 
the bottom, more than sutTiclenlly large for the rabbit to 
pass through. The edges of the Jiolc should be bound with 
tin or zinc to prevent the rabbits gnawing them ; and if 
a small door is made to close the hole, it will be as well, 
as the rabbit can be shut in on one side while the other 
is being cleaned out. This partition should be mov- 
able, as the object of this is to form a snug corner in 
which the doe may make her nest. 

The Feeding Troughs arc K)ng open boxes outside the 
hutch ; but a better phin is to have a swing board outside, 
which the rabbits can push inwards when they are feed- 
ing, and which falls down when the meal is over. Some 
persons have lids to the feeding trough ; these the rab- 
bits soon learn to lift — for rabbits are by no means dull 
or stupid animals — and which shuts down of itself as 
soon as the rabbit's head is withdrawn. Keep the buck 
in a separate hutch, as he is apt to fight with his wife and 
children. If you let your rabbits run loose in a yard or 
garden occasionally, be careful to provide security from 
cats, dogs, and rats. Scatter over their court the refuse 
and sweepings of the kitchen and garden, and even a 
portion of stable litter, and the rabbits will be all the 
better pleased. Give liiem abundance of dry food and 
they will thrive, and soon bcccMue so tame as to eat out 
of your hand, and to Hock around you when you present 
yourself with a new supjily. 

SaUIRRELS. 

Not difficult to tame and very amusing as domestic 
pets. Squirrels require but slight care beyond the keep- 



DOMESTIC PETS. 387 

ingtheir cages thoroughly clean and sweet, and regularly 
supplying ihem with fcjod, which consists of nuts, fruit, 
seeds, and bread crunil)s. They seldom breed in cap- 
tivity. They may be bought at the bird-fanciers'. 

GUINEA PIGS. 

These little animals feed on all kinds of green vege- 
tables, corn, beans, peas, and bread crumbs. Their houses 
must be kept particidarly clean, as they soon smell offen- 
sively and become a ntusance. They breed readily; the 
young ones requiring to be kept warm and dry. A good 
bundle of hay should always be in thecoi ner of the hutch, 
when the little tailless creatures soon make for themselves 
comfortable nests. They are perfectly harmless, but 
rather stupid, though they soon accustom themselves to 
come when they are called and feed from the hand. 

WHITE MICE. 

This variety of the ordinary species is an amusing, 
harmless little creature, often kept by boys and girls as 
home pets. They may be bought cheaply of the bird- 
fancier, and when kept in cages or hutches, care must be 
taken to keep them particularly clean and dry: otherwise 
their peculiar odor becomes offensive. Their food is 
bread and milk, with occasionally a little oatmeal or a 
few peas and beans. Avoid cheese and meat. They re-» 
quire cotton wool and hay for their beds, and are very

GOLD AND SILVER FISH. 

A few hints as to the management of these amusing 
pets: When purchasing a globe procure as wide-mouthed 
a one as possible; and in use it should never be more 
than three parts full of water. By these means y<ju will 
secure as much air as possible for the fish. Keep the 
globe in the m(>st airy part of the room, neither in the 



388 DOMESTIC PETS. 

sun, nor near the fire. Change the water daily, and 
handle the fish tenderly when doing so. A small net is 
the best thing with which to remove them. The best 
plan is to have two equal-sized globes and change the 
fish from one to the other daih^, always being careful 
that the fresh one is perfectly clean and the water (river 
water is far preferable) fresh and clean. Never give the 
fish food ; all they require is plenty of fresh air and fresh 
water — they will derive sufficient nutriment from the 
animaculae contained in the water. Numbers of people 
kill their gold-fish by giving them bread; for though 
bread is good for gold-fish, and they will eat it, the un- 
eaten crumbs immediately get sour and deteriorate the 
water, to the great injury of the fish. Keep the globe 
out of the reach of cats and dogs. Sometimes a fish 
seems less lively than usual, and on a close inspection 
will have a sort of mealy look, and in a day or two, this 
mealiness will turn out to be a parasitical fungus. We 
have never found any of the so-called remedies of the 
slightest use. There is nothing for it but to take the 
fish, at the first appearance of the disease, and destroy it, 
for it will not recover, and will infect the others. The 
inexperienced gold-fish keeper, whenever a fish seems un- 
healthy, had first better place it by itself for a few days; 
he will then see whether the fungus makes.*4t appear- 
ance; if not, the fish may recover, and be returned to the 
globe. Another disease is apparently an affection of the 
air-bladder, arising from being supplied with too little 
air. Fish recover from it when removed from the globe 
and placed in a pond. When under the influence of this 
disease, the fish swims sideways, with its body bent ag if 
its back were broken; and in a short time it dies. When- 
ever those S3"mptoms are observed, the fish should be 
placed in a large tub of water, and a small stream of 
water allowed to drop into it; the water, through drop- 
ping, becomes more aerated, and the fish will frequently 
recover.

DOMESTIC FOWLS. 

Cocks and hens may be profitably kept in town gar- 
dens, but they should, if possible, have a good grass run, 
with a dust heap at the end. All kinds of fowls want 
animal food and lime for the making of their egg-shells. 
The fowl-house should be dry and properly provided with 
perches. The nesting-places should be separate from 
each other, so that they may be easily cleansed when the 
hen has done sitting. A round bushel-basket, such as 
they bring with vegetables to market, form capital nest- 
ing places. They may be put down in any convenient 
place in the fowl-house. Each one should be about half 
filled with coal ashes or loose earth, with some short 
bruised straw on the top. This the hen readly hollows 
into a perfect nest, and is much better than a large quan- 
tity of straw or a flat board. 

Sitting and Hatching. When a hen sits in one of 
these baskets, she can at any time be covered with a coop, 
so as to prevent other hens going into the same nest to 
lay — a circumstance that generally leads to fighting, and 
consequently, to the destruction of the eggs. As soon 
as the chickens are hatched, the basket should be taken 
out of the fowl-house, the straw and ashes or mold thrown 
out, and the basket washed, so as to get rid of the fleas, 
&c. June is the best month for hatching. It is best to 
allow a hen to sit in the same nest in which she has been 
in the habit of laying, as there is usually some trouble in 
getting a hen to sit steadily in a strange nest. 

When a hen becomes broody or wants to sit, she shows 
her desire by remaining on the nest, and by a strange 
clucking noise she makes in the place of her usual note. 
To ascertain whether she is likely to sit steadily, it'is usual 
to give her three or four nest-eggs to sit on for a day or 
two. If she is found to sit well, the eggs she is to hatch 



390 DOMESTIC PETS, 

should be placed in the nest Avhcn she leaves it to feed, 
and the nest-eggs taken away. The day on which the 
eggs are given lier should be carefully noted down, and, 
if convenient, two hens should be set on the same day, 
for a reason that will appear presently. The eggs for sit- 
ting should be as fresh as possible, for if more than fif- 
teen or twenty days old they do not hatch so readily as 
when fresher, li a friend who has a good breed of fowls 
offers you a sitting of eggs, you may safely accept them. 
They will hatch none the worse even if they have been 
sent a hundred miles. 

After the hens have been sitting twenty days, some of 
the chickens begin to chip ihe shell. On this day the hen 
should not be disturbed. On the twenty-first day — that 
is, the same day three weeks that the eggs were put under 
the hen, ail the chickens will be hatched. Many persons 
take away those first hatched, and put them in a basket 
witli flannel by the side of the fire. This is a very useless 
phui — tlie hen and chickens had much better be left alone. 
When undisturbed, the hen will not leave the nest till 
the twenty-second day. and then all the chickens will be 
found quite strong and able to run. On no account 
should the young chickens be crammed with food ; until 
they are about thirty hours old they do not require any 
other nourishment than the yolk of the egg from which 
they are hatched. 

Food for Chickens. The best food for young chickens 
consists of wliole grits, but their diet sliould be 
varied. Coarse oatmeal mixed into a crumbly mess with 
milk or water, chopped hard-boiled egg, or curd, are 
very useful ; but the food on which they make the most 
rapid and healthy progress is the supply of grubs, insects, 
small worms, ants' eggs, and other animal substances 
that the hen obtains by scratching. Some persons say 
that the hens roam too much when they are not cooped, 
and weary the chickens ; but if the hen is well fed, thei^e 



DOMESTIC PETS. 391 

is no danger of her wanderihg so far as to tire the 
chickens. 

Food for Fowls. All fowls require warmth-giving food, 
as staich-rice, the solid part of potatoes, &c. ; flesh-forvt- 
ingfood. as the gluten of wheat, oatmeal, peas, barley; and 
fat-forming food, as the yellow variety of Indian corn, and 
other ttiings containing oily and fatty matters. Thesi; 
must be given in combination, not singly. — Grain forms, 
naturally, the principal food of poultry of all kind^J. 
Barley is the best, as it contains a larger amount of flesii 
and fat forming material. Next comes oats, which are 
to be given more sparingly, in consequence of the quan- 
tity of husks ; but in the form of oatmeal it is highly 
nourishing and fattening, especially for Cochins and 
Spanish fowls. Wheat stands in rather less request ; it 
is more expensive, and not more nutritive. Rice is 
useful only in the making of bone, and should, therefore, 
be given only in small quantities, except as a variation 
to richer food. Boiled rice is a capital food iox chickens 
when taken in conjunction with barley and buckwheat 
flour, or tnillet, both of which are very nutritious. Bran, 
pollard, malt-dust, and middlings are capital additions 
to their meal. A fresh supply of water daily is indispen- 
sable. 

Profitable Varieties. For keeping in town yards and 
small enclosures, the Spanish is a good breed, but the 
hens are bad sitters. The Minorca is a plump variety 
of the Spanish. Game fowl are great favorites with 
many, but as q^^ producers they are inferior to Span- 
ish, Hamburgh, Polish, Dorkings, or Cochins. For 
table purposes no fowls are so profitable as Dorkings. 
This bird, says a practical henwife, is an excellent 
farm-yard fowl: — "It is a good layer, a close sitter, 
and an attentive mother; the chickens grow rapidly, 
and are excellent for the table. The pure white Dorking 



392 JDOAfESTIC PETS. 

may truly be ctnisidored as fancy stock as well as 
uscfni, because they will breed true to iheir points. 
To the breeders and admirers of the so-called 'Dorkings' 
I would say, continue to improve the fowl of your 
choice, but let him be known by liis right title; do 
not support him on another's fame, nor yet deny that 
the rose comb or lifth toe is essential to a l)oiking, 
because your favorites arc not constant to those points." 
The principal drawback to tlie Dorking is the delicacy 
of the chicken; but for persons who rear fowls in 
order to make money of them, they are invaluable for 
tenderness and delicacy of flavor. 

Many spurious Dorkings are bred and brought to 
market. A full-grown CvH^k should weigh eight pounds, 
and a hen seven; heavier weights have been reached, 
but they are not common. The form of the body 
should be square, very broad across the shoulders, and 
full-chested; the legs should be short, nothing nn>re 
than the shanks being visible in the hen, and the hock 
only just showing in the cock. The shanks and feet 
are white, and the latter furnished Avith an additional 
hind toe. The head should be small and neatly formed; 
two varieties of combs are found in true-bred birds — 
a large evenly-arched single comb, and also a broad 
double, or, as it is often termed, a ** rose comb;" the 
latter should be flat on the top, and studded with 
points uniform in height. The single-combed birds 
are generally more admired. 

Bantams, whether known as black, white, gold-laced, 
silver-laced, g"ame, booted, or what not, have all certain 
characteristics in common — diminutive size, grace of out- 
line, and beauty of plumage. Bantams can hardly be 
called "prolitable," though they are good layers and sit- 
ters. Indeed, they are generally kept rather for orna- 
ment than service. *' Feather-legged bantams," says a 
fancier, " may be of any color; the old-fashiuned birds 
are xtvy small, falcon-hocked, and feathered with long 



DOMESTIC FETS. 393 

quill feathers to tlic oxticmily of the toe. Many of tliem 
were bearded. They arc now very scarce; indeed, till ex- 
hibitions brought tliem again into notice, these beautiful 
specimens of their tribe were all neglected and fast pass- 
ing away." Game bantams are miniature resemblances 
of the famous game-fowl — pert, lively, and full of feather. 

To Increase the Product of Eggs. We understand it 
has been practically demonstrated that a little cayenne 
pepper, administered with tlieir common food, at the rate 
of a tcaspoonful of cayenne each alternate day to a dozen 
fowls, will increase the product of eggs, A Boston house- 
wife, who first pursued this plan, found a considerable 
increase in the yield, and that the cayenne had the same 
effect both winter and summer. 

PIGEONS. 

The best place in which to keep pigeons in towns is 
the loft of a stable, or the space between the upper rooms 
and the roof of the house. In the country they can be 
comfortably housed in dovecotes, properly protected 
against wind and rain. In comfortable quarters pigeons 
rapidly increase and multiply. The floor of the pigeon 
house must be strewn with sand or gravel. Pigeons 
should be fed twice a day, at the same hours, until they 
get used to their master. When they begin nesting, scat- 
ter a few sticks and straw on the floor; they will know 
how to use them. When there are young birds hatched, 
and not before, you may open the door or window, and 
let the parent-birds go forth to see their food — they will 
n(jt require much more from you. The rock-dove likes 
to stray far and wide in search of provender. No young 
pigeons should be killed to eat the first year. Keep 
dovecotes well white-washed to prevent disease. Never 
give fcK.id that has visible insects in it; take especial care 
of mites. Observe to give each pair of parent-birds two 
17* 



394 DOMESTIC PETS. 

convenient holes or little rooms, and put in every nest a 
straw basket or earthen unglazed pan for the eggs. Every 
pigeon-house should be provided with a pan of water and 
a lump of rock salt. 

The Varieties of Pigeons are both numerous and curi- 
ous — tumblers, carriers, croppers, pouters, blue-rocks, 
&c.; but they may all be fed on the same kind of food. 
Tares or small horse-beans are the best and cheapest; but 
gray and white peas, hemp, wheat, and rape-seed may be 
advantageously used to vary their diet. Pigeons' dung 
need not be wasted, as it is a really good garden manure. 

SINGING BIHDS. 

Pood for. Birds are often rendered diseased, or spoilt 
in their song, from improper food. The following are 
some practical hints: 

Canaries. Canary-seed, one pint; rape-seed, half a 
pint; millet-seed, quarter of a pint. Mix. This is the 
general seed during moulting; give in addition some 
maw-seed, scattered on the bottom of the cage, and occa- 
sionally a little bruised hemp-seed. During summer 
keep them provided v/ith groundsel, chickweed, lettuce, 
watercress, &c. ; in winter supplement the usual seed 
with a slice of sharp apple, and a small root of common 
grass plucked up from the roadside; they are very fond 
of this, especially if it be in seed, and the earthy particles 
that cling to the roots are of use to them. If they have 
a few white lettuce seeds scattered sometimes over the 
cage-bottom, it will be found an incentive to them to 
sing. Give a little saffron when moulting. 

Goldfinches. A pint of canary-seed; a quarter of a 
pint of maw-seed; half a pint of rape-seed; and a quarter 
of a pint of Kv//-bruised hemp-seed. Mix. Give green 
vegetables as directed for canaries, and, when it can be^ 



DOMESTIC PETS. 395 

procured, a ripe plantain. Pay particular attention 
to the bruising of the hemp-seed — one whole one may prove 
fatal, as thCvSe birds, having slender beaks, unfitted for 
husking so large a seed, are apt to get tlie shell between 
the beak and nostril, causing inflammation and death. 
During moulting give a little flax-seed (linseed) as a 
treat, and put a rusty nail in the water. 

Linnets. Canary-seed, a pint; rape-seed, three-quar- 
ters of a pint; hemp-seed (whole), quarter of a pint; lin- 
seed, a pint. When moulting give a little maw-seed. 

Chaffinches. A pint of canary-seed; half a pint of 
rape-seed, and 'd few whole hemp-seeds mixed in. 

Bullfinches. Canary and rape-seed in equal propor- 
tions, and one-fourth of hemp-seed; a little maw added 
when moulting. Be careful not to give too much hemp, 
as it turns the plumige black. A few unopened buds of 
the pear, apple, plum, cherry, or hawthorn trees in the 
Spring are a great treat to this bird; the shade of any 
leaves of these trees over the cage in Summer is also 
grateful to it, as it is a wood-loving S(jngster. 

Another kind of food, recommended for thrushes, rob- 
ins, larks, linnets, canaries, finches, and most other sing- 
ing birds, and said to preserve them admirably in song 
and feather, is made thus: — Knead together three poinds 
of split peas, ground or beaten to flour, one and a half 
pound of fine crumbs of bread, the same quantity of 
coarse sugar, the raw yolks of six eggs, and six ounces 
of fresh butter. Put about a tliird of tiie mixture at a 
time in a frying-pan over a gentle fire, stir it until a 
little browned, but not burned. When the other two 
parts are done, and all cold, add to the whole six ounces 
of maw-seed and six pounds of bruised hemp seed, sepa- 
rated from the husks. Mix. 

To clean birds' feet. Some birds with every means 
granted them of bathing will not do more than splash a 



396 DOMESTIC PETS. 

few drops over their heads and backs. The consequence 
of this (and the neglect of cleaning the perches con- 
stantly) is that the feet gets coated with dirt, swell, and 
become so painful to the bird that he mopes. When 
this is the case fill a saucer with tepid water and have 
ready a bell glass — (an ordinary glass shade if round 
will do) — one person must now quietly catch the bird 
and put it into the water in the saucer, another person 
putting over the shade on the withdrawal of the other's 
hand. If carefully done the bird will be little frightened 
and probably at once begin to bathe. Keep him in the 
water till the dirt is softened and removed, which should 
not take more than ten minutes. Quietly re-catch the 
bird and examine the feet, and if lumps remain remove 
gently with a camel's hair brush. Have a soft clean 
handkerchief on the bottom of the cage and replace him 
on it, having previously well cleaned and scalded the 
perches. If necessary, repeat the operation after two or 
three days. 

Treatment of Young Canaries. No young birds should 
ever be removed, when carefully nursed by their parents, 
until they are at least five weeks old; and their food 
should be changed gradually. They should then be 
placed in separate cages, and kept in a warm room, 
where there is a fine, steady song-bird, ready to act the 
part of "tutor." At this tender age their little throats 
will be found full of music — they being o;ya\.Q piano j their 
early notes being called "recording;" and they readily 
copy, or imitate, whatever they hear. Hence, the great 
importance of putting them out to a good preparatory 
school. 

TALKmG BIRDS. 

Parrots, Paroquets, Macaws, Cockatoos, and other 
foreign birds of this kind arc fed on bread and milk, In- 
dian corn and hemp-seed mixed, scraps of raw meat, &c.; 



DOMESTIC PETS. 397 

but too much sugar is injurious. To teach them to talk, the 
room should be darkened and the birds talked to singly 
by its instructor. The Gray Parrot is tlie best talker, 
and easily learns to pronounce words and even sen- 
tences it is accustomed to hear frequently repeated. 
Ravens, Jackdaws, Jays, Magpies, Starlings, and other 
native talking birds are all soft billed, and require a reg- 
ular supply of animal food, bread, milk, and water. 
Both these and the parrots are subject to various dis- 
eases — as asthma, surfeit, diarrhoea, atrophy, pip, &c. A 
rusty nail in their water (a little cayenne for parrots), 
stick-licorice, chalk, or scraped root of white hellebore 
will be necessary; but if your bird continues ill, consult 
the bird-fancier. For attacks of vermin, to which they 
are all subject, an ointment of precipitate powder is 
necessary, or an infusion of tobacco water applied to the 
parts they are seen to peck and scratch. In confinement 
talking birds become very tame and teachable. They 
should be allowed to leave their cages, and very little 
training will accustom them to return to them at night. 
They have all a propensity for hiding their food and 
stealing bright things, as silver money, spoons, S:c. 
Upon this peculiarity rests the interest of the old story 
of " The Maid and the Magpie." 

BIRD STUFFING. 

Most persons who keep birds and have the misfortune 
to lose one by death or accident, like to have it stuffed 
and set up to imitate life. The following directions by 
a Professor of the art of Taxidermy, will therefore be 
gladly accepted. 

Preparing tlie Body. Beginners should never attempt 
to stuff any bird smaller than a blackbird: the larger the 
specimen the easier it is to stuff. First put a small 
quantity of cotton wool down the throat in order to pre- 



39S DOMESTIC PETS. 

vent moisture escaping from the stomach: this is im- 
portant, and must never be omitted; then brealc the bones 
of the wings close to the body; divide the feathers from 
the bottom of the breast-bone to the vent; divide the 
slcin in like manner. Do not puncture the abdomen; 
raise the skin with the point of a penknife until you can. 
take hold of it with your finger and thumb; hold the 
skin tight, and press on the body with a knife as the skin 
parts from it, putting the knife farther under until you 
reacli the thigh; break the thigh-bone close to the top 
joint, and push it gently up until you can take hold of 
the flesh. Now take the bone that is attaclied to the leg 
and pull it gently out, turning the skin of the leg inside 
out; cut tlie flesh ofif close to the knee and skin as far 
down to the back as you can. Do the same with the 
other side of the bird ; if any damp escape from the 
flesh dry it up with fi'esh bran. Put the skin on both 
sides out of your way with a small pair of scissors; push 
the body up (the tail of the bird being held in your 
hand); cut the back through as close to the tail as pos- 
sible (this must be done inside the skin), then take the 
bird by the back-bone and gently push the skin down 
with your thumb-nail till you come to the wings; take as 
much flesh from the wing-joints as you can, and go on 
skinning till you reach the ears; take hold of them close 
to the skull and pull them out. Take the eyes out, and 
be careful not to burst them, holding the skin with one 
thumb and finger while you pull the eye out of the skin 
with the other. After taking the eyes out, put as mucli 
cotton in the sockets as will fill them. Skin down to the 
beak very gently, cut the neck away from the skull, and 
also a piece of the skull to take the brains out; anoint 
the skin with Becoeur's soap, which may bebougiit at the 
chemist's; put a little tow round the thigh bones to form 
the thigh, and gently turn the skin back again. If care 
has been talv^i, the loss of the body will make but little 
difference in the size of the bird. 



DOMESTIC PETS. 399 

Setting up the Body. Get three wires, one as long 
again as the bird, the other two twice the length of the 
legs ; file them sharp at one end, bend the blunt end of 
the long wire, put some tow on the bend and squeeze it 
tight to fasten it, then twist the tow until it is about tiie 
size of the body ; do it as tight as possible. Have some 
tow cut up small ; get a strong wire, rough one point, 
and turn the other into a bow to hold in your hand ; 
take hold of some of the tow with the rough end, and 
push it up the nock ; this requires but a small portion of 
tow; put some in the chest and a little all over the in- 
side of the skin. Put the body wire up the neck, and 
bring it out through the skull at the top of the heal ; 
draw the body into the skin, and be careful not to stretch 
the neck ; then put the other wires through the center of 
the foot up the legs, being careful not to break the skin; 
put enougli wire inside the skin to push intotiie body to 
fasten the legs ; cut off a piece of the wire that has gone 
through the head, and put it through the tail into the 
body (under the tail, of course); open the eyelids, and 
put in the eyes ; mount the bird on a perch fastened to a 
small board, bend the legs, so that it will seem to stand 
in a proper position, be careful not to loosen the leg 
wires from the body, bring the feathers nicely together 
between the legs, bend the neck, and put the head in the 
shape you think proper, then run a pin or a piece of wire 
through the butt of the wing and into the body, to keep 
it in its proper place. Should the bird be out of shape in 
places, raise the skin gently with a needle, put the feath- 
ers as straight as you can, put a pin in the breast, back, 
and under each wing near to the top of the thigh, fasten 
the end of some cotton to one of the pins, and 
gently wind it round the bird from one pin to the other; 
put up the bird when you see that it is right. You had 
better let the specimen dry of itself, then bake it ; keep 
it free from dust, and it will dry in a fortnight. Spread 
the tail in a natural position, and when it is dry, unwind 



400 DOMESTIC PETS. 

the cotton ; cut the pins close to the butt of the wing 
and head ; take out the others, and the bird is finished. 

An easier and less expensive way of preserving 
memorials of departed pets is by painting. 

Pictures of Birds with their Natural Feathers. Take 
a thin, well-seasoned board and paste down on it 
smoothly a sheet of white drawing paper, and let it dry; 
if the color of the wood can be seen through the paper, 
paste down another sheet and so on until perfectly wliite; 
let stand till quite dry; then draw the figure of your bird 
as exactly as possible on the papered surface; then paint 
what trees or groundwork you intend to set your bird 
upon, also its bill and legs, leaving the rest of the body to 
be covered with its own feathers. Next prepare that part 
to be feathered by laying on thick gum arable, dissolved 
in water; lay it on with a large hairpencil, and let it dry; 
then lay a second coat of gum arable, and let it dry; and 
a third, and oftener, if you find that when dry it does not 
form a good body on the paper, at least to the thickness 
of a shilling; let it dry quite hard. When thus prepared, 
take the feathers off the bird as you use them, beginning 
at the tail and points of the wings, and working up- 
wards to the head, observing to cover that part of your 
drawing with the feathers taken from the same part of 
the bird, letting them fall over one another in the natural 
order. Prepare your feathers by cutting off the downy 
parts about the stems, and the large feathers must have 
the insides of their shafts shaved off with a sharp knife or 
a piece of glass to make them lie flat; the quills of the 
wings must have their inner webs clipped off", so that in 
laying them the gum may hold them by their shafts. 
"When you begin to lay them, take a pair of steel pliers 
to hold the feathers in, and have some thick gum-water, 
and a large pencil ready to moisten the ground-work by 
little and little, as you work it; then lay your feathers on 
the moistened parts, which must be just clammy, to hold 



DOMESTIC PETS. 401 

the feathers. You must have prepared a great many 
small sugarloaf shaped leaden weights, which form by 
casting the lead into sand, in which shapes or molds for 
it have been made by means of a pointed stick prodded 
all over the surface, having small holes to receive the 
melted lead. These weights will be necessary to set on 
the feathers when you have merely laid them on, in order 
to press them into the gum till they are fixed. Be cau- 
tious lest the gum comes through the feathers. Do not 
have your coat of gum too moist. When you have 
wholly covered your bird with its feathers, with a little 
thick gum stick on a piece of paper, cut round, of the 
size of an eye, which color the same as the eye of the bird 
if you cannot procure a glass bead of the kind. When 
the whole is dry, dress the feathers all round the outline 
and rectify defects: then lay on it a sheet of clean paper, 
and a heavy weight, such as a book, to press it; when 
dry preserve in a glass frame, such as used for pieces of 
shell-work, stuffed fish, &c. 

BEES. 

Management of. Select for your hives a sheltered part 
of the garden, screened from the north and east winds, 
but open to the southern aspect. Do not place the hives 
so that the sun strikes upon them too early, because bees 
must never be tempted to quit their hives in the heavy 
morning dew, which clogs their limbs and impedes their 
flight. Place them, if possible, near a running stream, 
as they delight in plenty of water; but if none is within 
their easy reach, place pans of fresh water near the hives, 
in which mix a little common salt; and let small bits of 
stick float on the surface, to enable the bees to drink 
safely, instead of slipping down the smooth sides of the 
vessel, to perish. Never place hives under a roof: it 
heats them, and induces the bees to form combs outside 
the hives, instead of swarming. Let the space before 



402 DOMESTIC PETS, 

the hives be perfectly clear of bushes and other impedi- 
ments to their movement. Bees, returning heavy laden 
and wearied, are unable to bear up against any object, 
should they hit themselves and fall. Trees and bushes 
in the vicinity are, however, advisable, as they present 
convenient spots for swarms to settle, which might 
otherwise go beyond sight or reach In November re- 
move your hives upon their stools, into a cool, dry, and 
shady room, or outhouse, where they will be protected 
as well from the winter sun as from the frosts. Warm 
days in winter often tempt bees to quit their cells, and 
the chilling air numbs and destroys them. Let them 
remain thus until February or March, should the spring 
be late and cold. It is not sufficient to stop the mouth 
of the hive with clay; the bees will soon make their way 
through it. 

Bees are subject to a disease like dysentery in the 
spring. Before you place the hives in their summer 
quarters, turn up the hive, and notice the smell proceed- 
ing from it. If the bees are healthy, it will smell like 
heated wax; but if diseased, like putrefaction. In this 
case, a little port wine, or brandy, mixed with their food, 
will restore them. In the early spring feed them, and 
do the same when the flowers pass away in autumn, 
until they are taken into the house, then do not further 
disturb them. The proper food is beer and sugar, in the 
proportion of one pound to a quart; boil it for five min- 
utes. In May, bees begin to swarm, if the weather be 
warm. New and dry hives must be prepared, without 
any doorway; the entrance must be cut in the stool. 
Sticks across the inside of the hives are of no use, and 
very inconvenient. Let the hive be well washed with 
beer and sugar, before you shake the bees into it. After 
swarming, place it upon a cloth with one side raised 
upon a stone; shade it with boughs, and let it alone till 
quite dusk, then remove it to the stool where it is to 
stand. 



DOMESTIC PETS, 403 

A practical writer tlms describes the process of chlo- 
roforming Bees: — " The quantity of chloroform required 
for an ordinary hive is the sixth part of an ounce: a very- 
large hive may take nearly a quarter of an ounce. My 
mode of operation is as follows: — I set down a table op- 
posite to, and about four feet distant from, the hive; on 
the table I spread a thick linen cloth; in the center of 
the table I place a small shallow breakfast plate, which 
I cover with a piece of wire gauze, to prevent the bees 
from coming in immediate contact with the chloroform; 
and into this plate I pour the chloroform. I now quickly 
and cautiously lift the hive from the board on which it 
is standing, set it down on the top of the table, keeping 
the plate in the center; cover the hive closely up with 
cloths, and in twenty minutes or so, the bees are not only 
sound asleep, but, contrary to what I have seen when 
they arc suffocated with sulphur, not one is left among 
the combs; the whole of them are lying helpless on the 
table. You now remove what honey you think fit, re- 
place the hive in its old stand, and the bees, as they 
recover, will return to their domicil. A bright, calm, 
sunny day is the best; and you should commence your 
operations early in the morning, before many of them 
are abroad." Care must be taken that the dose is not 
too strong. 

SILKWORMS. 

In this country silk-worms are kept simply for amuse- 
ment. The eggs which produce the worm are hatched in 
May or June, unless artificial heat brings them out at an 
earlier period. The eggs are about as large as mustard- 
seed ; and the worms, when first hatclied, are very small; 
but they feed on fresh lettuce and mulberry leaves so 
voraciously, that in six or seven weeks they grow to 
their full size. 

When growing they shed their coats several times, 
each time assuming more delicate colors. They have 



404 DOMESTIC PETS. 

nine holes on each side, through which they breathe. The 
silk is spun from two small sacks on each side, filled 
with a gummy substance which becomes silky as it dries. 
The worm never breaks his thread as he spins, and it is 
said one ball contains entire silk enough to reach six 
miles. These balls are called cocoons. 

These answer the same purpose as the chr3'-salis of 
the butterfly ; and if they were let alone, a delicate white 
moth would eat its way out of each of them ; but the 
holes thus eaten would break the silk in pieces ; there- 
fore, in order to kill the moths, the cocoons are baked or 
scalded. Those that are reserved for eggs are laid aside 
in the dark on sheets of paper. As soon as the moth 
comes out of her cocoon, she lays her eggs and dies, A 
few minutes' attention each day, for six or seven weeks, 
is all that is necessary. One person can attend to fifty 
thousand. It takes two thousand worms to produce a 
pound of silk. Everything about them must be kept clean 
and sweet. They must have fresh mulberry leaves two 
or three times a day ; and must neither be covered with 
dew nor dried in the hot sun. 



DOMESTIC PESTS. 



RATS AND MICE. 

I. Mix a few grains of powdered nux vomica with 
oatmeal, and lay it in their haunts, observing proper pre- 
caution to prevent accidents. 2. Another method is to 
mix oatmeal with a little powdered phosphorus. 3. Dried 
sponge cut small, and dipped in oil of rhodium and honey, 
proves mortal to those that eat it, by distending their in- 
testines. 4. Birdlime laid in the places which they fre- 
quent will adhere to their skins, and become so trouble- 
some as to make them leave their old quarters. 5. Balls 
made of a mixture of malt dust and butter, with a little 
of the oil of aniseeds, or rhodium, will allure them into a 
trap, when other baits have failed. 6. Having kneaded 
some wheaten flour or malt meal into a paste, when it be- 
comes sour mix with it fine iron filings, and form the 
whole into balls; then put them into the crevices or holes, 
and it will kill them. 7. Mix two or three grains of 
arsenic in a ball of dripping and flour, and strew several 
of these balls in the places most infested by the rats. 8. 
Another mode is to mix about a dfachm of the poison in 
a dish Avith boiled potatoes, slices of bacon, &c.; or to 
melt some cheese, and mix the arsenic with it. All these, 
however, have been known to fail, when arsenic, mixed 
with plain boiled potatoes, without any highly-flavored 
food, has been effectual. When it is found that the rats, 

[405] 



4o6 DOMESTIC PESTS. 

for a considerable length of time, avoid one kind of bait, 
another should be tried; and persons should not despair 
of their taking the poison eventually because they avoid 
it for several days together, as they will sometimes do 
this, and then in a single night devour all the bait. 

Notwithstanding the efl&ciency of these poisons, and 
the number caught in traps, a good cat will do more serv- 
ice in destroying and frightening away rats and mice 
than the whole list of poisons and all the traps that were 
ever made. 

In places where cats cannot safely be allowed — as 
cupboards, &c. — traps and poisons must, however, be 
employed, and of those given above the strongest and 
best — -though very dangerous — is strychnine, which is a very 
powerful preparation of nux vomica, mixed, a few grains 
nightly, with food. This is not easily detected by the 
rats or mice, and, if eaten, is instantaneously f .tal. The 
greatest care must in all these cases be exercised, and ser- 
vants or children should on no account be allowed to have 
anything to do with the preparation. It has been stated 
that vermin have a great aversion to the smell of garlic, 
and, if a clove or two of this vegetable be introduced in- 
to their holes, they will leaves the place and seek some 
other haunt. 

INSECTS. 

The butterfly, which lives on honey, and did live on 
leaves, lays her eggs on a twig. She seems to feel that hon- 
ey will not suit her young, and that the leaves will wither 
and fall before another spring comes round. — The gnat, 
which lives in the air, and feeds on blood, lays her eggs 
on the surface of water; and the sugar-loving house-fly 
knows that very different food is necessary for her 
young. — The nut- weevil chooses the embryo of the nut; 
the goat-moth the bark of the willow; the rhipiphora 
braves the dangers of the wasp's nest; the oestrus lays on 



DOMESTIC FESTS. 407 

cattle; the ichneumon in caterpillars; the gall-fly in the 
still almost imperceptible bud; and some insects even in 
the eggs of others. — Generally tlie larvae forage for 
themselves; but, in some cases, tlie mother supplies her 
young with food. Thus, the solitary wasp builds a cell 
and fills it with other insects. If, however, she im- 
prisoned them while alive, their struggles would infalli- 
bly destroy her Gg^; if she killed them they would soon 
decay, and the young larvae, when hatched, would find, 
instead of a store of wholesome food, a mere mass of cor- 
ruption. To avoid these two evils, the wasp stings her 
victim in such a manner as to pierce the center of the 
nervous system, and the poison has the quality of para- 
lyzing the victim witliout killing it. Thus deprived of 
all power of movement, but still alive, it remains some 
weeks motionless and yet fresh. — But, perhaps, the ants 
are the most remarkable of all. They tend their young, 
they build houses, they make Avars, they keep slaves, they 
have domestic animals, and it is even said that in some 
cases they cultivate the ground. 

Insect Poison. Petroleum oil possesses the highest 
efficacy as a destroyer of all kinds of insects injurious to 
plants or animals, and the less purified, and consequently 
the cheaper, it is the better. Thirty parts should be 
mixed with one thousand of water, and applied where re 
quired. Vermin of houses may be destroyed by intro- 
ducing into the holes or cracks a few drops of petroleum. 
— A solution (one to twenty of water) of carbolic acid, 
which is said to kill every insect from the size of a mouse 
downwards. It is also said that Russia leather drives 
away all manner of vermin if a small piece of it is worn 
near the person, or even kept in the pocket. 

Moths are very destructive, and, when suffered to make 
inroads into wearing apparel, &c., are with difficulty got 
rid of. To preserve blankets from them, fold the blan- 



4o8 DOMESTIC PESTS. 

kets up and lay them between feather-beds and mattresses 
that are in use, unfolding them occasionally, and shak- 
ing them. Woolen stuffs, such as cloth cloaks, merino 
dresses, &c., are best placed in drawers, with sheets of 
paper, moistened with spirits of turpentine, laid between 
them ; lavender-flowers, cedar-shavings, and cuttings of 
Russia leather will also produce a similar effect. Damp 
harbors moths ; therefore great care should be taken in 
putting woolen things away for the summer, that they 
have been well brushed and are perfectly dry. Furs 
should be occasionally taken out, shaken, beaten with a 
cane, and hung in the open air. Great care must be 
taken that they are dry when put away, but they must 
not be placed hear the fire. Other methods are employed 
for the same purpose, such as laying a few pieces of 
camphor among the furs ; peppering them with black 
pepper ; bitter apples, obtained of any chemist, are also 
placed in little muslin bags, and sewn over in several 
folds of linen, carefully turned in at the edges. 

Bugs, Take of corrosive sublimate, two drachms ; 
spirits of wine, eight ounces. Rub them well together 
in a mortar until the sublimate is dissolved ; then add 
half a pint of spirits of turpentine. This is an effectual 
destroyer of bugs; but, being a strong poison, great care 
should be taken in using it. Another plan is to rub the 
bedsteads well with soft-soap or lamp oil. This alone 
is good, but, to make it more effectual, get six-penny- 
worth of quicksilver and add to the mixture. Put it into 
all the cracks around the bed, and the pests will soon dis- 
appear. The bedsteads should first be scalded and wiped 
dry ; then lay on the mixture with a feather. 6>r, dip a 
sponge or brush in a strong solution of vitriol, and rub 
it over the bedstead. This will expel the bugs, and de- 
stroy their nits. Cleanliness, however, and frequent ex- 
amination, will prove the best remedy. 

In houses infested with bugs — and sometimes old 



DOMESTIC PESTS. 409 

houses are so, in spite of all precautions — the following 
is an effectual cure. Take one pound of common lump 
brimstone, or sulphur, value twopence; place it in an old 
iron saucepan, and put a piece of red-hot iron on it to set 
it on fire, having previously filled up the chimney and 
every crevice; allow the room to remain closed about 
three hours. The fumes of the brimstone will smother 
every insect in the room; repeat as often as required; be 
sure to leave no children, birds, or domestic animals in 
the room while fumigation is going on; put a piece of 
iron or stone under the saucepan containing the brim- 
stone, so as not to damage the Hour. 

When bugs are in the walls and floors, all the crevices 
should be stopped with glazier's putty; and, before the 
walls are re-papered, the old paper should be stripped off, 
and at least one coat of oil-paint be laid on. If they are 
in bedsteads, the bedstead should be taken to pieces, 
well washed and dried, and aquafortis laid with a brush 
in all the holes and crevices, or some size may be made 
and laid on with a brush; this, when dry, is an eternal 
prison for bugs, and also for their eggs. Another very 
good plan is to put spirits of wine, or strong tobacco- 
juice, on every part of the bedstead that is suspected, do- 
ing this by portions at a time and setting fire to it; this 
will not injure even a polished bedstead, if the part be 
immediately rubbed up with a cloth covered with a little 
beeswax. Where bugs are very numerous, and they are 
in situations which cannot easily be got at, there is but 
one effectual remedy — fumigation, as above directed. 

Fleas. Numerous remedies are resorted to by good 
housewives to get rid of and prevent the increase of this 
most prolific domestic torment; but the best preventive 
and also remedy is great cleanliness. The rooms should 
be frequently washed, and the bed-clothes exposed to the 
free action of the outer air. A bit of camphor in the bed, 
or camphor sprinkled in the bed in powder — which is 
18 



4IO DOMESTIC PESTS. 

made by dropping upon a lump of camphor a few drops 
of spirit, and then reducing it by the hand to powder — 
will prevent fleas from coming near the person. 

Another Eemedy. Sprinkle the floor with a decoction 
of wormwood; hang near the bed a bag filled with dry 
moss, or lay therein some fresh leaves of pennyroyal sewn 
up in linen. As dogs and cats harbor fleas very much, 
they should not be allowed to come into bedrooms. 

Flies may be expelled by fumigation, and by various 
preparations of fly-paper and fly-water. But as these are 
poisonous, they are dangerous where children are about. 
The following is efficacious, and without risk: — Put a 
handful of quassia chips into a basin, and pour a pint of 
boiling water over them; let them infuse for a time, then 
strain off the liquor, and add to it two ounces of ground 
black pepper, and a quarter of a pound of brown sugar. 
Put this mixture in plates or saucers, in places where the 
flies are most numerous. 

Another effectual method is: — Take a cominon drink- 
ing-glass and a slice of bread; wet the latter, and turn 
down the glass upon it, so that the rim makes a deep 
groove. Make a hole with your finger through the 
bread, trim off the waste, and spread one side of it with 
treacle or sugar; half fill the glass with water, and fit on 
the cover of bread with the treacle side beneath. The 
bread-trap is now ready to be placed on the places fre- 
quented by flies. Attracted by the sweet treacle, they 
will swarm down the hole and get caught; others follow- 
ing will force them into the water, and thus, in the course 
of the day, the glass will get full. The curious fact is 
that the flies cannot return through the hole. ThroAV 
the doomed flies on the fire, or otherwise effectually de- 
stroy them; if thrown on the dust-heap they will soon 
recover. The ordinary house-fly breeds year after year 
in the same dwelling; and if, in the early spring, its eggs 



DOMESTIC PESTS. 411 

were carefully sought and destroyed, the nuisance of 
flies would soon be mitigated, if not abolished. The 
great meat-flies, or blue-bottles, are of a different species. 
They breed principally in the yard or garden, live on de- 
caying flesh and garbage, and come into the house in 
searcli of food. Whenever they alight on a piece of 
meat, they leave behind them an Q^^, wliich in a few 
hours develops into a disgusting maggot. Meat-flies 
should, therefore, be destroyed without mercy; a simple 
netting of black thread will prevent them entering an 
open window. 

Cockroaches and Crickets. Cucumber peelings are 
said to destroy cockroaches. Strew the floor in that 
part of the house most infested with the vermin with the 
green peel cut pretty thick, Try it for several nights, 
and it will not fail to rid the house of them. 

Or, take a teacupful of well bruised plaster of Paris, 
mixed with double the quantity of oatmeal, to which 
add a little sugar; then strew it on the floor or in the 
chinks where they frequent, and it will destroy them. 

Beetles may be got rid of by half filling a basin or 
pie-dish with linseed oil, sweetened beer, or treacle, 
and setting it in such places as they are accustomed 
to frequent. Place two or three strips of wood slant- 
ingly from the dish or basin to tiie floor. Attracted 
by the smell, the insects will venture up and be 
drowned on the other side. The drowned insects 
should be burned or crushed. An eminent naturalist 
tells us that his servant, having removed one morning 
from tlie trap about two hundred cockroaches seemingly 
drowned, to make assurance doubly sure, poured over 
them boiling water, and then threw them in front of 
the house; in less than three hours the influence of 
the sun had revived nearly the whole of them, and 
Ihey were again crawling about in full vigor. The te- 



412 DOMESTIC BESTS. 

nacity of life in the beetle tribe is very great. Many 
cats will eat oockroaches, but they do not thrive on them 
but become thin and languid, and sometimes die — 
poisoned ! 

Or, Place quicklime in the holes of the wall whence 
they issue, or scatter it on the ground. For trapping them, 
the beetle-wafers sold in the shops to poison " black- 
beetles" are made by mixing equal weights of flour, 
sugar, and red lead; but as these wafers are liable to be 
picked up and sucked by children, they are objection- 
able. 

Ants. Houses infested with ants, black or red, may 
be disinfected by a little attention. A sponge is one of 
the best things. Sprinkle it with dry white sugar: the 
sponge being slightly moist, it will adhere. The ants 
will go into the cells of the sponge after the sugar in 
large numbers, and can be destroyed in hot water, and 
the sponge squeezed out and sugared again, and returned 
to the closet for another haul, until all are caught. 

Gnats. These troublesome insects, which are closely 
allied to the terrible musquito. Both belong to the class 
of creatures whose mouths are furnished with bristly 
stings, included in flexile sheaths. They pierce the skin 
by means of the proboscis, in order to feed upon the blood, 
and at the same time, inject a poisonous fluid, producing 
considerable inflammation and swelling. Their activity 
usually commences towards evening, or after sunset. 
The Laplanders use tar-cream to prevent the insects 
biting them, but that could scarcely be used in this coun- 
try. The common Goulard water, scented with Eau de 
Cologne, is a good remedy in allaying the irritation, as 
also preventing the attacks. Gnats seldom or never fre- 
quent rooms or houses where chloride of lime has been 
exposed. 

Sting of Bees. Although the poison a bee emits when 



DOMESTIC PESTS. 413 

it inserts its sting, is proved to be a iiighly concentrated 
acid, the applicaiion of all alkalies will not neutralize 
the acid. The more gentle alkalies — chalk, or the " blue 
bag," are much more likely to effect a cure, and cannot 
injure. The same person will be variously affected by 
the sting of a bee ; at one time, scarcely any inconven- 
ience will attend it ; at another, much swelling ; again, 
but little enlargement, although great pain, &c. The eye 
suffers considerably, though in general the uneasiness is 
local; but if the back of the ear be stung, there is fre- 
quently a general affection of the system ; sickness, gid- 
diness, numbness, nervous trembling, &c., &c., wiiich 
will sometimes continue for hours. A draught of cam- 
phor jalap, and total repose, has been known to be bene- 
ficial. 



MANNERS AND BEHAVIOR. 



What is Etiquette? Etiquette may be defined as a 
code of unwritten laws whicli govern the manners of peo- 
ple living in polite society one towards another. Insti- 
tuted in the days of chivalry, the etiquette of gentle man- 
ners has descended to us, and all who claim a right to be 
considered ladies and gentlemen have a direct interest in 
upholding the acknowledged rules of courtesy and good 
taste, and preventing, so far as they can, the encroach- 
ments of vulgarity and ill-breeding. 

ETiaUETTE FOR GENTLEMEN. 

The true and standard maxim of good-breeding is 
courtesy; you cannot be agentleman until you constantly 
practice kindness and gentleness. " Thoughtf ulness for 
others, generosity, modesty, and self-respect are the 
qualities which make a real gentleman or lady, as distin- 
guished from the veneered article which commonly goes 
by that name." A vulgar man has freedom without ease; 
agentleman ease without freedom. 

Never altogether dispense Avith ceremony, even among 
your most intimate friends. A general quiet observance 
of their wishes, and a desire to earn their good opinion 
— perfectly distinct both from stififnessand servility — will 
do more to win the respect and friendship of yourassoci- 
[414] 



MANNERS AND BEHAVIOR. 415 

ates than all the lavish expenditure and flattery too often 
used to the same end. 

In making a present let it be in accordance with your 
known means and position, and offer it quietly and with- 
out parade. Its value should be its usefulness or beauty, 
and not its mere money worth. 

In receiving a present do so without making extrava- 
gant speeches of thanks, as such would lead the giver to 
think a present from him or her was the last thing to be 
expected. On the other hand, let your acknowledgment 
be cordial and gratifying to the giver. 

Never keep your hat on in a theater, whatever part 
of the house you may be sitting in. It incommodes the 
view of those behind you, and is a certain sign of bad 
breeding. 

In walking with a lady always place her on the side 
nearest the wall; and in crossing any muddy road or 
path you lead the way, except in the case of a crowded 
road, when you should give the lady your arm to con- 
duct her across. In such a case, unless you were walk- 
ing arm-in-arm before, relinquish it when you have 
crossed. 

In walking alone, keep to the right. 

If a lady inquire the way, inform her, if you can, in as 
few and simple words as possible; but do not, unless the 
way be difficult to find, or very near, presume to show 
her, as she very naturally would not like to walk by the 
side of a stranger. This remark does not apply to old 
ladies or very young girls. 

Avoid loud laughter or loud conversation in all pub- 
lic places, and in the street. 

Should you accidentally come in collision — or jostle 
against — with any person in the street or elsewhere, 
apologize instantly, even though you were the offended 
party. The offense was, in all probability, uninten- 
tional, and you also may have been in some measure to 
blame. 



4i6 MANNERS AND BEHAVIOR. 

In speaking of one gentleman to another, never, un- 
less you both know him very intimately, speak of him in 
any other way than as Mr. ; and never, on any ac- 
count, use the initial of his or her name, as Mr. C , 

Miss J . 

In introducing persons to each other, present the gen- 
tleman to the lady; and, where both are of the same sex, 
the inferior in rank or position to the superior or elder. 
Always, when making the introduction, speak the names 
correctly and distinctly, and take care that each com- 
prehends the name of the other. 

When introduced to a lady, or a superior in position 
or age, do not attempt to shake hands, but simply bow; 
the advance, if made, must come from the other side. 

In meeting a friend accompanied by a lady, bow to 
him, and always raise your hat. 

Two gentlemen walking together, and meeting a 
lady known only to one, should both raise their hats. 

When you meet a lady in the street, turn and walk 
with her rather than stand. 

In morning calls it is usual to leave your card when 
the family are announced as " Not at home." 

The bearer of a letter of introduction should deliver 
it personally, accompanied by his card. In giving a 
friend a letter of introduction, be careful to leave it 
unsealed. 

When you receive a letter of introduction, if sent by 
post, acknowledge it immediately; but if the lady or 
gentleman introduced bring it in person, courteously re- 
ceive her (or him); and then, if you wish to continue the 
acquaintance, give an invitation for another day. 

In meeting a lady in the street you must not notice 
her unless she first bows. This is imperative, except in 
the case of familiar acquaintances. On leaving a lady 
always bow and raise your hat. 

On meeting a male friend, shake hands with him; an 



MANNERS AND BEHAVIOR. 417 

acquaintance, bow, or raise the hat; to one much your 
superior, do both. 

Always be punctual; never make an appointment you 
cannot keep; and never break one unless from positive 
inability; and, in the latter case, apologize. 

At dinners never be late; at evening parties punctual- 
ity is not so important. 

In paying a mere visit of ceremony, do not call be- 
fore two or after five in the afternoon; this general rule 
must, of course, be altered occasionally as circumstances 
dictate; and, unless invited for any particular purpose 
which will detain you, take your hat into the room v/ith 
you. If any other visitor is in the room, the first visitor 
should leave early. 

On calling at a house to inquire after a sick friend or 
acquintance, send in your card, and wait till the servant 
informs you of the state of his health; then immediately 
leave. 

On no account enter a room — unless shown in by the 
servant or your friend meets you at the door — without 
first knocking and obtaining permission to go in. 

In paying an evening visit, should there be other peo- 
ple at the house, go in, but do not stay long, even if 
pressed to do so, unless on intimate terms. 

In dress be quiet, neat, and fashionable, without 
going to extremes. Equally avoid singularity, staring 
colors, and large patterns. Neither dress above or be- 
low your station; and always suitably to the time of day. 

Whenever you appear in public wear gloves. 

It must be clearly understood that marriage puts a 
stop to all former acquaintanceships a man may have 
had, unless cards are sent — except in such cases where 
none are issued. 

Be polite without being foppish, conciliatory without 
being servile, considerate without being anxious, truth- 
ful without being indiscreet, just without being severe, 
and generous without being lavish. 
18* 



41 8 MANNERS AND BEHAVIOR. 

The Etiquette of the Dinner-tahle is a matter that can 
scarcely be taught. Be punctual in arriving, courteous 
and quiet while dining — moderate both in speech and in 
appetite. Only partake once of soup or fish ; take no 
wine or beer with soup ; do not eat fish with a knife 
(unless fish-knives and forks are provided), but use the 
fork in your right hand, and a small piece of crust, 
(which leave on the plate when done with) in your left ; 
always break your bread, not cut or bite it ; when a 
plate is handed to you, keep it, and, without undue haste, 
commence eating without reference to the others. It is 
usual to help the guests in regular order. In the matters 
of finger-glasses, taking wine, &c., " do at Rome as the 
Romans do." 

In the matter of giving dinners, do not invite more 
than you have comfortable accommodation for ; be punc- 
tual in having dinner served, as waiting long in the 
drawing-room is most tedious ; be liberal without pro- 
fusion or crowding ; be cool-tempered and at your ease, 
for nothing is more annoying to the guests than to have 
the faults of servants or children talked of, or the delay 
■ — which even with the greatest care does sometimes oc- 
cur — commented upon. 

The hostess must be in the drawing-room at the ap- 
pointed hour to receive her guests, and should, by the 
exercise of tact, endeavor to set up a perfect understand- 
ing between them, and alleviate, as far as possible, the 
tediousness of the " drawing-room conversation," 

On going down to dinner the host escorts the lady 
who is highest in rank or position, or to whom the great- 
est deference is due; he then seats her on his right hand, 
and intimates, quietly but distinctly, where the rest shall 
sit. He should not seat relations — except man and wife 
— together, nor two of a sex, or profession, except where 
it is unavoidable. The host and hostess occupy the top 
and bottom of the table, the two most distinguished lady 
guests sitting on either side of the former, and the hostess 



MANNERS AND BEHAVIOR. 419 

being supported by the gentlemen of most considera- 
tion. Gloves should be worn in the drawing-room, and 
removed immediately upon taking your seat at the din- 
ner-table. 

Eat peas, currant-jelly, and all sorts of thick sauces 
with your fork. Use your dessert-spoon in eating cur- 
ries, various of the softer made-dishes, puddings, and 
tarts; the latter it is usual to eat with a dessert-spoon and 
fork, the latter being in the left hand. In helping sauce 
or vegetables, do not put them over the meat, but care- 
fully just within the hollow of the plate. 

When dessert is served, assist the lady next you to 
some of the choicest of the fruit. 

The following, from a book of etiquette, is curious, 
and hardly necessary for our readers: — 

"Never smack your lips nor chirp with your mouth 
at or after dinner. Don't pick your teeth, nor insert 
your fingers in your mouth. Use the butter knife, not 
your own, when you help yourself or others to butter. 
Put the debris of fish, fowl, or meat on the corner of your 
own plate, not on any other, nor on the table-cloth. Do 
not be supplied with more than you can eat; you will 
thereby avoid leaving a portion on your plate. If a jun- 
ior in the company, do not speak much, nor attempt to 
lead the conversation. Do not carry anything to your 
mouth with a knife. If you cough, place your handker- 
chief to your mouth. If you have occasion to use your 
handkerchief, do not look at it afterwards." 

" Do not ask any one at table to assist you if there is a 
servant in attendance. 

" Never ask to be helped twice to the same dish, nor 
make remarks on quality or price of the articles on the 
table. 

" Always use the proper glass for each particular wine 
you drink. 

"Do not speak or drink with your mouth full. 

"If asked by any of the company to drink wine, al- 



420 MANNERS AND BEHAVIOR. 

ways replenish your glass from the decanter, and bow. 
This custom is, however, almost out of date. 

"Never pick a bone with your finger." 

In accepting invitations, write at once. 

Always go in evening dress to dinner parlies. 

After a party call, or leave your card, within a xveek. 

The mode of serving dinner — what to give, how to 
carve and help it, as well as how to make and cook it — 
will be found under the section " Domestic Cookery." 

Etiquette in Traveling. Do not take a seat in a rail- 
way-car or coach which you see has been engaged by any 
personal article being placed upon it, in consequence of 
the temporary absence of the occupier. 

Do not vi^histle or hum offensively, nor make a noise 
with your stick, umbrella, or feet on the floor of the 
carriage. 

Do not put your foot on the opposite cushion, nor 
open or close the window if against the prevailing wishes 
of your fellow-travelers. 

Do not talk loudly, especially for any lengtliened 
time, when others are present. This is a most irritating 
habit — most travelers prefer to travel quietly. 

The weather side of the car is that on which the rain 
beats or wind blows, and you can always claim to have 
that window shut. He who sits with his face to the en- 
gine, next a window, has usually the first claim or option 
of having it shut or open, unless the latter interferes with 
the comfort of the other passengers. 

Always open the door for a lady, and assist her in 
getting out and in. 

Avoid the use of the words "gent " or " party." 

If you have more newspapers than one, or have 
perused the only one your have, offer it to j^our neigh- 
bor. 

Avoid placing your feet or legs in the way of your 
opposite fellow-traveler. 



MANNERS AND BEHAVIOR. 421 

Never insist on getting into a car which is full, but 
ask permission to enter, if other parts of the train are 
full. 

If you are cultivating a mustache, avoid constantly 
trimming it with your fingers. 

It need hardly be said, never swear nor use profane 
language. 

Never insist on speaking to a fellow-traveler if he 
shows a disinclination to continue the conversation. 

If a lady enters a car that is full, offer her your seat, 
and stand until another passenger leaves. 

Never irritate a person who is the worse for liquor, 
and avoid conversation witli him. If a lady is annoyed, 
you are bound to interfere for her protection. 

Avoid interfering in the quarrels of relations or of 
husbands and wives. 

If on a long journey, with one or more in the same 
car, better to exchange a few commonplace observations 
than preserve a demure silence and attitude. 

Do not fill up the seats with your portmanteau or car- 
pet-bag, if they are likely to be required. 

Do not take a dog into the car without permission of 
the other passengers. 

When you enter a car, do not hold up your umbrella 
or stick, nor thrust it out — you are apt to injure others. 
Carry it suspended in your hand, and avoid placing it 
on the foot of any passenger when you get seated. 

Make yourself always agreeable and obliging; this 
will generally secure you an immediate return of good 
feeling and urbanity. 

ETiaUETTE FOR YOUNG GIRLS. 

Manners, too, frequently make or destroy the happi- 
ness of women more than we can imagine; and what the 
young girl is, the woman is almost sure to become. Man- 
ner is, indeed, of infinite consequence, for it is an index 



42 2 MANNERS AND BEHAVIOR. 

of the mind. The professor of calisthenics and the danc- 
ing-master may drill the body into easy and graceful 
movements; but what will these be if the actions lack 
courtesy, and the words gentleness. 

A polite child should enter the room with a bow or 
courtesy, which is the customary modeof showing respect 
to strangers. She ought to go up to those who speak to 
her, answer their questions clearly and distinctly, and 
then sit down quietly. She may hand round cakes, and 
make herself generally useful and agreeable; she should 
in fact, be seen but not heard, and certainly never take 
notice of any peculiarity in the dress, appearance, or man- 
ner of the visitor. 

Young ladies should always be civil to servants or in- 
feriors, and always polite when asking anything of them. 
Haughtiness and ostentation should be avoided. 



LADIES' TOILET. 

The hair should be carefully attended to, brushed 
night and morning, and kept clean; a little oil ma)-- be 
rubbed into the roots occasionally; and ought to be fre- 
quently cut, to prevent the ends from splitting. 

The nails should be kept clean with a brush and cut 
nicely, the skin at the roots being rubbed back every time 
the hands are washed. 

The teeth, being a great ornament to the face, and of 
unquestionable value, should be carefully attended to; 
wash with a brush after each meal with tepid water, or oc- 
casionally rub with a fine towel. Notice the first appear- 
ance of decay, and have it stopped by a good dentist. 

ETiaUETTE FOE LADIES. 

It is absolutely essential that a lady should conform 
strictly to tiie usages and rules of society, and what in a 



MANNERS AND BEHAVIOR. 423 

gentleman would be a venial offense against good taste 
and good breeding, would bring ridicule upon a lady 
moving in the same class. 

Therefore, it is indispensable that a lady should ob- 
serve all proper forms and rules, without being cither 
ceremonious or fastidious — avoidingalike affectation and 
vulgarity, prudery and insincerity. 

Be moderate in everything, and never try to appear 
anything but what you are ; be gentle and affable, and 
never seek to win by any other weapons than simplicity, 
honesty, dignity, and gentleness. 

Dress neatly and plainly before dinner, and, even 
when full-dressed, avoid all extremes of fashion and or- 
nament. 

On no account appear, even to breakfast, in those 
hideous abominations called curl-papers. If you use 
them, take them out of your hair before presenting your- 
self. 

Upon a first introduction, whether to a lady or a gen- 
tleman, and even until the acquaintance be intimate, a 
graceful inclination of the head is all that etiquette de- 
mands. 

In traveling, should a gentleman address you respect- 
fully and courteously, you may politely but coolly reply; 
but such acquaintanceships must invariably cease where 
they commence. If the manner of speaking to you be 
in any way wanting in consideration and respect, pre- 
serve absolute silence, and, as soon as possible, move 
away. 

If you are in any difficulty do not hesitate to apply to 
any gentleman for assistance, but be careful to word 
your request in the plainest and simplest terms, combin- 
ing politeness with prudence. 

In ordinary friendly calls, dispense as far as possible 
with ceremony and formality, without overstepping the 
bounds of propriety and self-respect. 

If the person you are visiting be preparing to go out, 



424 MANNERS AND BEHAVIOR. 

or to sit down to table, leave quickly, even if invited to 
remain. 

A visit of ceremony should not last more than a quar- 
ter of an hour, and you should not remove either bonnet 
or shawl. You should retire, easily and quietly, as soon 
as possible after the arrival of other visitors, but do not 
let it appear that their arrival is the cause. When they 
are seated, take leave of your hostess, and bow to the 
guests. 

In walking through the street be careful to walk 
neither too fast, which is ungraceful, nor too slowly, 
which is indecorous. 

On receiving a visit of ceremony, I'ise and advance, 
offering your visitor, or visitors, seats, and then give your 
entire attention to them until the short visit is at an end, 
being careful neither to llattcr nor to neglect your guests. 
On a ceremonious visit it is not the custom, unless the 
visitors are from the country, to offer refreshment, but 
this rule varies. When your visitors rise to leave, ring 
the bell for the servant to open the street-door, and ac- 
company tliem to the door of the room and no farther. 

Punctuality in returning visits is absolutely necessary. 

A married lady had better not speak of " My hus- 
band," but " Mr. ;" and should observe the same 

rule in speaking to lady friends of their husband. Never 
address a young lady as " Miss," without the addition of 
the name; but say " Madam," or " IMiss ." 

In meeting a gentleman in the street whom you 
desire to recognize, bow slightly, but do not stop. He 
will then, if the acquaintance warrant it, turn and walk 
with you for a few yards. A lady is not obliged by eti- 
quette to recognize a gentleman in the street if she does 
not wish to do so. 

If a lady meet a gentleman in the country, or in a 
park or square, she may, however, stop and speak. 
The rule as to tliis must, of course, be regulated by the 
intimacy of the acquaintance. 



MANNERS AND BEHAVIOR. 



LETTER V/RITIIIG. 



425 



A letter should be polite, courteous, clear, simple, 
and written with appropriateness to the subject. A good 
legible handwriting is an essential accomplishment. 

Use good, but plain and undecorated paper and en- 
velopes, avoiding the extremes in the sizes of envelopes. 

Do not be more formal than is absolutely necessary, 
but keep studiously from the vulgarity of a " free-and- 
easy" style. 

Remember that a written letter is an important docu- 
ment, and a harsh word or expression contained in it 
may be a lasting annoyance, or worse. 

In all cases put the date and address on the letter, as 
well as the name of the person addressed, and let your 
signature be plain and distinct. 

In writing to a stranger on any matter requiring a 
reply, inclose a stamped addressed envelope. 

Do not use wafers — wax or adhesive envelopes are 
more respectful, and in good taste. 

Commence your letter — "Sir," or "Madam;" and, if 

more intimate, " Dear Madam," or " Dear Miss ." A 

lady should not address a gentleman other than as " Sir," 
unless the acquaintance is both long and intimate. 

Conclude — " I am, Sir;" or "I am, Madam, yours sin- 
cerely;" or, more familiarly, " I am, dear Mrs. , very 

sincerely yours." 

Ceremonious notes, written in the third person, should 
be brief and to the purpose. Do not sign such notes, or 
use the first person anywhere in them. 

ETiaUETTE OF THE BALL-ROOM. 

On entering "you must, in the first place, find your 
hostess and make your obeisance. A gentleman must 
not dance frequently with one lady, nor must he engage 
her too many dances in advance. In private balls, where 
there are no programmes, engagements should not be 



426 MANNERS AND BEHAVIOR, 

made until the dance is announced. In private bjills. 
also, a lady has no option but to dance when asked, or 
sit out that dance. When the dance is over, the gentle- 
man takes the lady to a seat, or offers her refreshment. 
Where there is a regular supper, the gentleman must 
take down his last partner, and sit beside her; or, if there 
be only room at the table for the ladies, he finds her a 
seat, and stands behind her. If, however, the hostess re- 
quest him to take down another lady, he must do so, 
first finding an escort for his last partner. The time for 
making your appearance at a public ball varies accord- 
ing to the fashion and custom of the place; you cannot 
do wrong, however, by presenting yourself between ten 
and eleven. For a private ball, the invitations usually 
specify the time. Your dress must be simple but ele- 
gant; and remember, that to married ladies only belongs 
the privilege of attiring themselves in those elaborate 
ball costumes which are at once the delight and envy of 
their younger sisters. 

EVENING PARTIES. 

At these, as well as at balls, a room must be provided 
by the hostess for the unrobing of her lady guests. The 
ordinary but delightful amusements of dancing, music, 
and singing are proceeded with under the mild despotism 
of the host and hostess. When private theatricals are given, 
the ladies invariably have the front seats. The hostess 
usually commences thedancing with the greatest stranger 
or the most honored guest. In leaving make as little fuss 
as possible, bowing slightly, if either be close to you, to 
the host or hostess, but making no other sign of departure. 
Wlien, however, there is a general break-up, your leave- 
taking may be more marked. Do not omit to call and 
express your thanks and gratification to your hostess. 
This call should be made some morning within a week 
after the entertainment. 



GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 



PRACTICAL HINTS FOR KEEPING A GARDEN. 

The chief and most important matters to be attended 
to by cultivators, whether on a large or small scale, are 
comprised in the following simple and essential rules: — 

1. Let everything be done in its proper season and in 
the best manner. 

2. This is to be accomplished only by intelligent prac- 
tice. For example, in digging over a piece of ground, it 
is not uncommon to throw the weeds and stones on the 
ground or on the adjoining alley or walk, with the in- 
tention of gathering them up afterwards. The best way 
is to have a wheelbarrow, or large basket, in which to put 
the weeds and extraneous matter, as they are taken out 
of the ground. 

3. Complete every part of your work as you proceed. 

4. Finish one job before beginning another. 

5. In leaving off work at any job, leave the work and 
tools in an orderly manner. In leaving off work for the 
day, make a temporary finish, and carry the tools to the 
tool-house. 

6. In passing to and from work, or on any occasion, 
look out for leaves, or any other deformity, and remove 
them. 

7. In gathering a crop, remove at the same time the 

[427] 



428 GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 

roots, leaves, stems, or whatever else is of no further use, 
or may appear to be decaying, or offensive. 

8. Let no crop of fruit, or vegetables, go to waste on 
the spot. 

9. Cut down the flower-stalks of all plants. 

10. Keep every part of the garden perfect in its kind. 

11. Attend at all times to implements and tools, keep- 
ing them clean, sharp, and in perfect repair. House 
every implement and tool not in use, both in winter and 
in summer. 

12. Allow no blanks in edgings, rows, single speci- 
mens, drills, beds, and even when practicable, in broad- 
cast sown pieces. Keep edgings and borders cut to the 
utmost nicety. Keep all the walks in perfect form, free 
from weeds, dry and well rolled, and lawns and grass- 
plots of a close texture and a dark -green velvety appear- 
ance. 

SIMPLE DIKECTIONS FOR EACH MOl^TH IN THE 

YEAR. 

The following is a brief summary of such things as 
are most needful to be done by amateur gardeners in the 
various months of the year. The temperature, and the 
state of the weather must be taken into consideration, 
but as nearly as can be the work set down for the month 
should be done in it. 

January. Dig and manure when the frost will per- 
mit ; let the digging be deep, and rough, or raised into 
ridges. Trenching is noble work for winter, and need 
not be hindered by pretty hard frost. Plant in mild 
weather, and prune in any weather, all manner of trees 
and bushes. Wall-training, which requires much time, 
may be greatly advanced at this season. A little may be 
done in sowing on warm borders, for an early crop, a 
few early peas and beans, onions, carrots, radishes, lettu- 
ces, and parsley. Hot-beds may be prepared for forcing 



GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 429 

plants. Cauliflowers and early cabbages may be sown in 
them. Protect by mats, or branches of spruce fir, deli- 
cate shrubs, and also new-sown beds. Care must be 
taken of dahlia roots and stored bulbs, that tliey do not 
suffer by exposure to frost, or become moldy from damp 
and want of air. Walks may be formed, fruit and other 
trees and hedges pruned, palings made or repaired, de- 
ciduous trees and shrubs planted. 

Here we may remark on the value of wood-charcoal ^s 
an ingredient of manure. It has tiie effect of absorbing 
both the beneficial and harmful gases, &c., that the soil 
of previous growing crops have produced; in the one 
case storing food, and in the other preventing injury to 
the growing plant. Hence the common but less beneficial 
use of coal-ashes, the mineral constituents of which, to- 
gether with those of charcoal, afford potash, silica, and 
other minerals, for the use of the plant. In setting plants 
a common error is to put them in too deep. Tiie roots will 
always find tlieir own way dowtnvards in search of mois- 
ture and foo<l. A good rule is to plant so, that the top 
of the radiating branch of the root sliall only be two or 
three inches below the surface of the soil. It should be 
remembered that all the vitalizing influence of the soil 
depends on the ready access of air. Sticks, labels, &c., 
for spring use may now be prepared. 

February. In frost, the same work as directed in the 
previous month. In mild weather dig, trench, ridge, and 
prepare such ground as has been well exposed to frost, 
and sow in dry weather for a succession of crops, peas, 
beans, onions, carrots, parsnips, spinach, every sort of 
s.veet herbs and salad, celery, cauliflower, cabbage, and 
savoys. Plant early cabbages; cut a few early potatoes 
and put them in a warm place, with some dry earth, that 
they may sprout and form roots; then plant at the foot 
of a south-wall, where a few spruce branches will keep 
off the frost. Form walks, plant box-edging, or dress 



430 GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 

borders and shrubberies. The pruning of vines should 
be concluded during February; also prune gooseberries 
and currants, standard and espalier trees; dress and tie 
up raspberries, erect espalier rails, and continue the 
training of wall-fruit-trees, keeping back such as are too 
luxuriant, and stimulating those which are backward by 
judicious manuring. In hot-beds, or under glass frames, 
set slips or cuttings of various plants this month, such 
as fine wall-flowers, delicate shrubs, and China roses; 
sow stocks, and a variety of the stronger annuals that 
agree with transplanting. Plant bulbous roots, ra- 
nunculuses, hazel-nuts, filberts, &c., in deep trenched 
beds. 

March. Sow all manners of seed for a principal crop; 
beans, peas, leeks, onions, early turnips, vegetable mar- 
rows, caiTots, parsnips, turnip radishes, asparagus, cel- 
ery, cauliflower, beet, and spinach. Plant early, late, 
and red cabbage, and take cauliflowers from tiie frame, 
with a little ball of earth, and plant them on the earli- 
est and richest border. Strawberries may also be planted 
now, but the best season is in autumn. Dress straw- 
berry beds and flower borders. Divide and straighten 
flower edgings, form walks, plant shrubs and shrubbery, 
flowers next the walks. Engraft fruit-trees, and, on the 
common brier, various sorts of roses. Make layers of 
roses and shrubs, sow perennial and biennial flower- 
seeds, and some of the more hardy annuals. Protect all 
early blossoms on walls by woolen nets, tender plants 
and flowers with mats or green branches. 

April. Begin early by sowing and planting what- 
ever has been prevented by unfavorable weather. Plant 
artichokes, asparagus, cabbages, and greens; sow peas 
and beans for a succession; also carrots and turnips. 
Transplant lettuces, water cauliflower plants, and seed- 
ling beds. Dress box-edging; plant evergreens, and 



GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 431 

make layers of fine shrubs. Propagate by cutting wall- 
flowers, lavender, and primrose, and by separating the 
roots of all sweet herbs. Form flower edgings of dwarf- 
gentian, seapink, polyanthus, and London pride. Di- 
vide and plant out all turfy-rooted flowers. Sow 
hollyhock, sun-flower, dahlias, carnations, pinks, stocks, 
marigolds, and China asters; and in the finest weather, 
towards the end of the month, all the annuals. Chrys- 
anthemums should be potted and fresh cuttings made; 
plant out strong dahlia roots. Keep the glass frames 
well aired, pluck off decayed leaves, be careful of frost, 
and watchful of green fly; put fresh mold on the flower- 
pots, and water them occasionally. Superfluous shoots 
on vines should be rubbed off. Make all clean and neat 
by clipping box, hoeing, raking, and rolling gravel- 
walks, and mowing grass plots. Worms may be de- 
stroyed on gravel-walks, and the appearance of the 
latter improved, by watering with a solution of one 
pound of copperas (sulphate of iron) to two gallons of 
water. Soot applied on beds, round the stems of plants, 
is also an excellent preventative of worms. 

May. Of vegetable crops, sow what there is room 
for, especially late peas and spinach, for a succession; and 
carrots, to have a better chance of escaping the carrot- 
wo.rm. Fill up any odd ground with beet, spinach, French 
or kidney beans. Transplant cabbages, cauliflowers, 
greens, and lettuces. Let the hoe be much employed for 
the destruction of weeds, and the health of all crops An- 
nuals may be sown, if previously omitted on account of 
wet; mignonette and sweet-peas, though early remem- 
bered, may well be sown late, to continue their bloom 
till winter. Plant dahlias, and protect their delicate 
shoots, as well as early potatoes, from frost. Stake peas 
after hoeing, and water seed beds, new planted shrubs, 
and crops. Seedlings and slips from the glass frame 
may now be trusted to the open air. It is now a fine sea- 



432 GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 

son for planting the evergreens, provided they are both 
shaded and watered; also for setting slips or cuttings of 
pinks and carnations, sweet-william, wall-flower, lychnis, 
double rockets, and the like. Plant out verbenas, tliey 
form a pretty alternation with geraniums and calceola- 
rias. Roses and fruit trees, being now greatly subject to 
the attacks of insects, should be well smoked. Grass 
and gravel walks must be kept in good order, mowing 
the grass weekly, and frequently sweeping the gravel 
when dry, and rolling it after rains. Beds should be well 
and carefully raked. Remove the superfluous blossoms 
from all fruit trees; as, no matter how luxuriant a tree 
may be, there is a limit to its strength. 

June. Still sow peas, spinach, carrots, and turnips, 
for late autumn use. Plant out cauliflowers, cabbages, 
savoys, and celery. Ply the hoe on all drill crops, and 
water plentifully when needful, morning and evening. 
Thin out onions, leeks, carrots, turnips, 8z:c. Transplant 
seedling flowers of whatever sort in moist weather. Lift 
bulbs that have ceased flowering, and place tliem in sand, 
leaving the stalks to wither away. Stake peas after hoeing 
and before tendrils appear. Make layers of pinks and 
carnations, and re-pot choice auriculas and polyanthuses 
in fresh mold, mingled with old decayed manure. Water- 
ing with a solution of guano is excellent for roses Jvnd 
most flowers. Sow hollyhocks, and stake them. Look 
well to the wall-fruit trees, and anticipate the i-avages of 
insects, by copious watering with tobacco water. Watch 
the beginnings of caterpillar on the gooseberries, and 
apply the vapor of sulphur, or wash with tobacco, lime 
or soot water. 

July. This is the great month for putting into the 
ground the autumn and winter crops. Plant out cauli- 
flowers, and winter cabbages. Select from the leek beds 
or drills, the strongest plants, and set them in new dug 



GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 433 

and rich earth. Earth up celery, watering from time to 
time. Lift and dry in the sun full-grown onions that 
have been sown before winter. Fruit trees require much 
attention at this season, especially those on the wall, to 
expose the fruit to the sun by the removal of superfluous 
shoots, to ripen by fixing close to the wall those shoots 
which are to remain for future bearing ; to keep free 
from insects, and to loosen the earth around the roots. 
Gather such seeds of flowers as have come to maturity; 
make layers of pinks and carnations, and plant cuttings 
or slips of dahlias, geraniums, calceolarias and pansies. 
Take up anemone and ranunculus roots, when done 
flowering; dry them in the shade, and store in a dry 
place for the winter. Stake hollyhocks and all other 
tall-growing stems. Plentiful watering is required for 
most of the flowering plants, in the absence of rain. 

August. Fill up all vacant ground from which early 
crops have been removed, with such as may serve for 
autumn and winter. Sow spinach and early turnips ; 
also greens, early and late cabbage, savoys, and cauli- 
flowers for plants in spring, and about the middle of the 
month onions to stand the winter. Earth up celery, 
hoe and thin turnips, transplant brocoli, savoys^ and cauli- 
flowers. Late in the month plant plenty of early cab- 
bages, which in a sheltered place will stand the winter, 
and prove of excellent use in spring. Take up ripe 
onions, and let them dry on the gravel. Bud fruit trees 
and roses, and shade the buds by a funnel-shaped piece 
of brown paper. The utmost care is now necessary to 
defend your fruit trees from insects. Sow mignonette 
on a warm border, and to obtain varieties, sow auricula, 
polyanthus, and anemone seeds ; also those of bulbous- 
rooted flowers. Geraniums and cinerarias should be 
abundantly propagated by cuttings. Transplant biennial 
and perennial seedings. Tie up dahlias to strong stakes, 
and thin out the flower buds where there are too many. 
19 



434 GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 

Nail to the wall, and tie to the espalier rails, the proper 
shoots of apples and pears, before they get too strong. 
Prepare all plants intended for early spring blossoming. 
In the absence of rain or heavy dew, water freely. Clip 
box, prune hedges, ply the hoe and the scythe, and suf- 
fer no weeds or moss. 

September. The sowing and planting directed for last 
month will still do in this, and do better if the weather is 
more favorable. All the seeds for spring crops will do 
early in the month, and so will the planting of early cab- 
bages, to be ready for use in March, April, and May, when 
they are better than in the heat of summer, and when 
there is little that is good for food in most gardens. Hoe 
spinach and turnips, dress with lime or soot to kill slugs, 
and earth up celery. New is the time for setting slips of 
gooseberries, and many sorts of shrubs. Manure and dig 
between the drills of strawberries, and make new planta- 
tions of the young and well-rooted plants. Remove all 
blighted fruit, and carefully see to the insect pests. Rip- 
ening grapes, peaches, &c., must be protected by netting, 
and the leaves that would prevent ripening be removed. 
Divide and transplant biennial and perennial flowers, and 
make layers of all manner of shrubs. Crocuses, snow- 
drops, irises, crown-imperials, narcissus, and most bulb- 
ous roots may now be planted out; also rooted pinks and 
carnations. Plant, shade, and water important ever- 
greens, and at this season not one will be lost, as they 
begin to take root before winter. 

October. Sow early peas before a south wall, or in 
the most sheltered place; and set traps for mice. Stick 
in, three or four inches apart, young cauliflower plants 
close to a south wall, or in a glass frame, for early plant- 
ing in spring. Take up carrots and parsnips, cut off the 
leaves, and pit the roots in dry mold, or cover with sand 
Commence your preparation of the ground — digging, 
draining, trenching, &c. Plant fruit and forest trees, and 



GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 435 

all deciduous shrubs; prune in general. In standard 
fruit trees, tliin the branches, top some of those that are 
left; and make a sloping cut close to an outside bud, to 
secure a spreading instead of a vertical growth. On a 
threatening of frost put a mat over fine dahlias, to pro- 
long the season of beauty. Protect also the delicate 
layers of pinks and carnations. The refuse of dead an- 
nuals should now be removed, new beds prepared, bor- 
ders and walks trimmed and cleaned, and all other prep- 
arations made for the frost and storms of winter, 

Ifoveinber. This is still a good season for planting all 
manner of trees and shrubs, except evergreens. Early 
peas and potatoes may be put in to come early, with due 
care to guard against frost. Prune trees and shrubs 
that obtrude on the walks. After the removal of the 
fruit, the stems of apple, pear, plum, and cherry trees 
should all be washed with hot lime and water, after 
removing moss, &c. Dwarf fruit trees should also 
be pruned into the desired shape. Trench out and dig 
rough, as in all winter months, and make drains where 
needed. Wheel out manure and gather leaves for com- 
post, excellent for flowers. Force rhubarb and sea kale, 
under pots or wooden boxes, heaped over with rough 
manure. Take up dahlia roots when the leaves are 
gone, and after gradual drying in a shed, bury them in 
dry sand. Protect all delicate things with mats or lit- 
ter, but suffer no straw to be seen blowing about. 

December. There is now plenty of work in prepar- 
ing ground by trenching, ridging up to the mellowing 
frost, and digging in manure for spring cropping, also 
in turning over and maturing compost heaps. Plant all 
sorts of deciduous trees, if not done earlier (which is 
better). Prune forest and fruit trees, and fill up odd 
time with wall training and tying espaliers. Roses to 
bloom well need to be pruned and enriched with com- 
post, or old and well decayed manure. Guano gives a

healthful darkness to the leaves, and a richer blossom. 
Poverty may be seen in a rose, as well as in a crab-like 
apple, or an unboiled cabbage. All fine flowers require 
protection from frost. Peas, potatoes, or cauliflower 
plants that have been set close to a south wall, may be 
greatly aided by sticking in and sloping against the 
wall branches of spruce fir, which admit air, and cause 
no deformity. The stock of manures should be occa- 
sionally stirred up to prevent excessive heating, and to 
promote equal decomposition. 

EASILY-RAISED ANNUALS. 

In the following list the English name is given first, 
then its color, and last its period of blossoming. Those

blooming only once in several years. 

Sow in the last week of April, or the first of May, 
when the weather is fair, and the ground dry. Those 
seeds which are almost invisible may be laid on a smooth 
bed and merely sprinkled with dust. A common garden- 
basket, with a few handful s of fine loose earth, answers 
well for sifting over the seeds. Many beautiful flowers 
are lost by coarse hands that make their bed a grave. To 
mark the seed-bed and save it from the hoe, draw a circle 
around it; sow in a ring. 

Seeds. To guard them from vermin, lay a piece of 
glass over the pot or trough in which they are sown, until 
they come up, and afterwards, at night, cover with a pot 
of the same size, till the seed leaves have expanded, and 
the husks have dropped. If sown under a hand-glass, or 
Mn a frame, the cover should always be removed by sun- 
rise, and replaced in the evening, for it is at night that 
vermin mostly commit their depredations. No air 
need be admitted till the heat begins to arise, and the 
steam begins to appear; but after that the light should be 
tilted a little every day, whatever the state of the weather 



GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 441 

'may be, until the plants break ground. Air must then 
be admitted more freely: and if frosty, the end of a mat 
should be hung over the opening, that the air may not 
immediately strike the plants. 

Germinating Powers of Seeds. These powers will, 
we are told, be considerably increased if, a few hours be- 
fore they are sown, they are immersed in a weak solution 
of oxygenated muriatic acid, and suffered to remain until 
they uegin to swell. The germination will be accelerated, 
and the plants produced will, in most cases, be stronger 
and healthier. 

To Preserve Seeds. When seeds are to be preserved 
for a long time, or to be sent a long distance, sugar, salt, 
cotton, saw-dust, sand-paper, &c., have been adopted with 
various degrees of success. Chinese seeds, dried by 
means of acid, may be afterwards preserved in a vegetat- 
ing state for any necessary length of time, by keeping 
them in an airy situation in common brown paper, and 
occasionally exposing them to the air on a fine day, es- 
pecially after damp weather. This method will answer 
with all mucilaginous seeds. Very small berries, and 
oily seeds, may be kept in sugar, or among currants and 
raisins. 

Varnish, for Garden Fences, &c. A cheap and excel- 
lent varnish may be made thus: — Take two gallons of tar, 
and two pounds of resin, one pound of tallow, and one 
quart of turpentine; put these into an iron vessel, and let 
them boil gently over a fire, made for the purpose in the 
opeti garden (taking care that the mixture neither boils 
over, nor the fire reaches the vapor which escapes, and 
which is very inflammable), until the quantity is reduced 
one fourth. This varnish, which may be used at the same 
time as paint and varnish, is fully equal to the best vege- 
table tar. 

Greenhouse and Indoor Plants. Wash the leaves and 
19* 



442 GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 

stalks often, with a soft sponge and repid water; if 
blacks have settled use a little soap in the water. Place 
spent tea leaves upon the mold in the flower-pots, and 
now and then a little soapsuds, specially good for 
geraniums. 

Garden Mousetrap. Place two small sticks in the 
ground five inches apart ; bore a hole through a broad 
bean, double a piece of thread and put through it, and 
tie it to the sticks about three inches from the ground, 
with the bean in between the two ; then place a brick to 
rest on the thread with the middle of the brick on the 
bean ; the mouse will bite the thread through to get to 
the bean, and the brick will fall on the top of him. A 
better rat or mousetrap is that called the figure of four 
trap; it is made with three sticks and a slate or tile. 
The sticks should be half an inch in breadth and an 
eighth of an inch in thickness ; the first piece should be 
four inches in length — this should form the perpen- 
dicular line of a figure of four; the second should be 
eight inches in length with a sharp point at one end to 
stick the bait on (generally a piece of cheese), and a 
notch cut on the flat side at the other end, and one in the 
edge about the middle ; this piece will form the hori- 
zontal line of the figure ; and a third should be four 
inches long, with a notch on the flat side, about three 
quarters of an inch from one end ; this should fit on the 
top of the perpendicular, and the other end should fit in 
the notch at the end of the horizontal piece, and thus form 
a figure of four ; a roofing tile or a slate should then be 
placed to rest on the end of the top piece. When the 
mouse disturbs it by endeavoring to take away the bait, 
the tile will fall on the intruder. 

INDOOE GARDENING. 

What to Grow. For general indoor gardening, gera- 
niums, fuchsias, calceolarias, heliotropes, begoniuras, 



GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 443 

stocks, balsams, cinerarias, dwarf roses, mignonette, and 
such-like simple and pretty flowers will be found most 
appropriate. Various kinds of bulbs — as hyacinths, tu- 
lips, crocuses, ixias, jonquils, snowdrops, ranunculi, 
gladioli, &c., may be grown in pots. Bulbs should be so 
arranged as to furnish a succession of bloom. Hanging 
baskets and ornamental flower pots, also make pretty 
additions to the parlor garden, especially if planted with 
pendant fuchsias, money-wort, ivy-leaves, geraniums, 
campanulas, blue lobelias, nierembergias, or other plants 
which grow readily, and require but little attention. For 
the outside of windows with a south or south-west aspect, 
nothing is prettier than canary -creeper, climbing roses, 
scarlet geraniums, convolvulus, mignonette or creeping 
jenny, intermixed with a few of the more free-growiug 
climbers. 

How to Succeed. It is easy to say what flowers and 
plants live best indoors; but for unprofessional gardners 
a few simple directions are necessary, and are here ap- 
pended. 

Watering. The water used should always be of near- 
ly the same temperature as that of the earth in which the 
plants are growing. Accordingly, never use very cold 
water f(jr indoor plants, as, except in frosty weather, the 
earth round the roots is comparatively warm. To get 
the water and the soil of the same temperature, put the 
vessel, with sufficient water for the whole of the plants 
next morning, by the side of the plants the evening before. 
Use rain-water rather than any other. Never water until 
the surface of the mold is tolerably dry, and then enough 
to moisten the whole of the earth in the pot. Do not 
pour the water into the saucers under the plants, but al- 
ways upon the surface of the mold. Growing plants 
should have plenty of water, and the quantity must be 
gradually decreased as the growth approaches maturity, 
and almost cease when the height is attained, and restrict- 



444 GARDEN MANAGEMENT, 

ed until the return of the growing season. In other 
words — in the spring, plants must be kept moderately 
moist ; in summer, water daily ; in autumn, decrease the 
quantity ; and in winter, keep rather dry. In summer 
water plants in the evening; in winter y in the morning. 

Potting. Put plenty of charcoal, pot-sherds, oyster- 
shells, &c., to secure proper drainage; and never fill the 
pot up to the brim. The best mold (compost) for potting 
in is an equal mixture of the peat, loam, and silver-sand. 
Where these materials cannot be readily obtained, get 
your compost of a good nurseryman. Common clay 
pots are better than glazed ones. Keep your pots clean; 
old pots should be scrubbed, and new ones soaked be- 
fore using. 

Give your plants plenty of light, and let it strike 
down on them as perpendicularly as possible. All 
plants kept in windows will turn their branches, leaves, 
and flowers to the light, and so grow rather one-sided. 
By turning them occasionally you will keep theiu a bet- 
ter shape, but they will not be so strong or so full of 
flower. 

Plants require plenty of fresh air; avoid extreme 
cold, cutting winds, and all sudden changes. In winter 
plants do not require so much air, as they will have 
accommodated themselves to the atmosphere of the 
room. 

Indoor plants are generally pretty secure from frost; 
but care should be taken that there are no sudden or vio- 
lent changes of temperature, and there should be as little 
difference as possible between the heat day and night. 
This it is more especially necessary to observe in winter. 
In rooms in which fires are lighted daily, plants will 
generally thrive. In a room or conservatory, where gas 
is constantly burned, it is useless to attempt plant culture. 

Large-leaved plants should be gently wiped with 
a wet sponge, now and then. Small leaved plants should 



GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 445 

be held slantingly, and watered with a fine-holed water- 
ing-pot. An hour in a gentle spring or summer shower 
will always do good. 

FERNS. 

Fern Cases. To plant a fern case, put in plenty of 
broken flower-pot and broken charcoal to drain the case 
well; over this have a thin layer of moss, or the fibrous 
part of peat; then fill in the compost before mentioned, 
adding bits of charcoal and sandstone. The soil in the 
center of the case should be raised, and the larger ferns 
planted there. When planted give it a good watering, 
let it stand an hour to drain. Then put the glass on, and 
place the case near one of the windows of the room; it 
ought never io be exposed to direct sunshine; but if inev- 
italale, it should be shaded by any light material; green 
being preferable. 

Water very seldom, and only when the soil is found 
to be getting dry. The case should be kept quite close, 
so as to exclude the air, when it is hot or dusty, but for 
an hour in the morning, once or twice a week, the glass 
of the case should be raised, but the window must not be 
open, as no current of air must reach the plants. Re- 
move dead leaves, and slightly trim any plants that may 
be over-growing the others. If the inside of the glass 
gets green with being continually moist, take off the case, 
wash the green off, and replace. Replant the case in the 
spring, removing the larger growths, and re-arrange the 
smaller ones according to taste. When the inner surface 
of the glass is not covered with condensed moisture, 
more especially in the morning, it is a sign the plants 
need water. Before planting, each separate plant should 
be examined for insects. Afterwards, if any appear, 
fumigate the case well with tobacco-smoke — blow the 
smoke through the stem of the pipe — by blowing 



446 GARDEN MANAGEMENT. " 

into the bowl, until the case is so full, you cannot see 
through it. 

The best compost is three-quarters rough fibrous 
peat, and one quarter an equal mixture of well decom- 
posed leaf mold and loam, witli a little coarse sand 
added. Cocoa-nut fiber refuse is, with the addition of a 
little loam, to be recommended for fern growing. 

BULBS. 

Choose such as are of a medium size for their species, 
are firm, without bruises, spots, or off-sets, have shiny 
and smooth skins, and present no signs of premature 
vegetation. Hyacinths, crocuses, &c., should be allowed 
to remain in the mold after flowering, and be sparingly 
watered until the leaves decay, when they must — still in 
their own soil untouched — be put away in a dark place. 
Crocuses should, however, be taken up every tliird year, 
but only to thin out and increase the number of pots by 
making one into two. Hyacinths grown in water 
should be carefully taken out after they have done 
flowering, and placed in sand, spreading the roots out, 
and not doubling them up. Never purchase bulbs at 
auction or of any but well-known and respectable dealers. 
The best time to lay in your stock of bulbs is the end of 
September. 

The following bulbs do not require any especial care 
in cultivation, and may be grown either in the open gar- 
den, or In the house: — Dog-tooth violet, purple and white; 
blossom in the early spring: winter aconite; yellow 
flovv'ers, very early: grape hyacinth; common and feath- 
ered, pretty blue flowers, and also early: fritilaria: im- 
periaiis, yellow lily; raeleagris, purple spotted, spring 
flowering; snow-drop: narcissus minor (dwarf daffodil); 
bulbocodium, both yellow; gladiolus cardinalis; dark 
red: floribundus; white: ramosus; rose color; the various 
sorts of this plant, mixed and set in beds, make a fine ap- 



GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 447 

pearance; jonquil; sweet and beautiful; all ordinary 
hyacinths in glasses. 

Time for Planting Hyacinths. This must, to a con- 
siderable extent, be regulated by circumstances. October 
and November are the most generally approved months; 
make your first planting near the ist of September, and 
your last about the 31st of December; should an oppor- 
tunity, however, afterwards offer of cheaply purchasing 
sound bulbs as late as the middle of January, plant them 
too. You may then have your sitting-room and conser- 
vatory adorned with the glowing beauty of the hyacinth 
from Christmas till April or May. In the open ground 
hyacintlis arc sometimes planted as late, as the beginning 
of March, and very good blooms have come; but those 
planted early in February blossom beautifully; but Ja- 
nuary is the best month for out-door planting of this 
bulb. After the early part of December, hyacinths in- 
tended to bloom in glasses would flower better if first 
planted in pots, and there allowed to remain till half 
grown or even in bloom. The removal into the glasses 
being readily performed (especially if the new collar- 
glass is used), by simply turning the plant out of the pot, 
placing the ball in a basin of tepid water, and gently 
washing away the soil from the roots. 

CREEPEES. 

Virginia creeper and other climbing plants of the 
same class require little attention ; if allowed plenty of 
room to grow, by training against a wall, they will cover, 
spread, and increase immensely. Ivy will cling of itself 
to almost anything and is sure in time to cover a wall, 
though its progress is very slow compared to other creep- 
ers. Canary creepers, climbing roses, jessamines, honey- 
suckles, &c., may be bought in pots. 



448 GARDEN MANAGEMENT, 



EVERGEEENS. 

Hollies and laurels look well in any good-sized 
garden. Put in hollies from the nursery in rows about 
eighteen inches apart, and six or eight inches distant in 
the row. Let them remain until they are bushes of two 
feet in height, giving them all the time a frequent hoeing 
in summer, and slight digging between the drills in 
winter. They rapidly expand above ground, and form, 
instead of the whip-lash roots of the seedling bed, a fleece 
of fibers, to which the earth adheres, and by which, when 
transferred to the shrubbery, their growth is at once sure 
and vigorous. Along with the hollies, lay in a small 
stock of Portugal laurels, common laurels, variegated 
hollies and a few of the arborvitae, laurustinus, arbutus, 
and juniper. Of these, some of the finer sorts may be 
planted near to the house,, where they are to remain, and 
on ground which may not require a tedious process of 
amelioration. Should the house be situated in the gar- 
den, by all means let some of those beauties come next 
the eye. Others of the more hardy shrubs may be set to 
nurse, for future lifting in the manner of the hollies ; 
and in the meantime layers of every sort may be freely 
taken. 

LAWNS. 

A layer of fine cinders about an inch thick, spread 
over the ground immediately under the turf of a new 
lawn, will almost always keep worms away. If they are 
already troublesome water the lawn with limewater; /. e. 
fresh burnt lime put into water, and allowed to stand 
until the lime has settled to the bottom, and then the 
water used in a clear state. 



GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 449 



EDGINGS. 

Box may be planted at almost any time, and is, if care- 
fully planted and looked after, perhaps the best edging 
for walks. Take up with the spade a portion of the edg- 
ing that has grown too old, and part the roots; one yard 
of the old will make ten of the new. In parting, tear all 
the old bush down into the smallest shreds; throw away 
every one that is thicker than a crowquill, and cut off all 
the roots beneath the uppermost tier of fibers, a single 
fiber is enough; with none the plant may do, but it is not 
necessary to try it. The plants so trimmed should be 
about four inches in length. Having filled the excavation 
with stones, all to four inches, left for gravel, on either 
side of the walk, dig the surface, set the line to a nicety, 
using many pins at every turn, to make the windings 
easy, bring the level exactly to the line, and beat all 
smooth and firm, so that the earth may stand cutting with 
a trowel; cut by the line to the depth of three inches, 
pulling the earth towards the v^^alk; and lay the green 
tops of the plants to the line, setting their heads above 
it, not more than one inch, and all touching one another. 
The roots will vary a little in depth, but let a few plants 
be held exact at the top with one hand, whilst the earth 
is applied to the unequal roots with the other. The re- 
verse rule of evenness, providing for the roots and not 
the tops, is the cause of the straggling appearance so 
often seen in box edgings. For kitchen gardens good 
hard bricks on edge, make the best, most durable, and 
cheapest edging. The ornamental tiles are now gaining 
in favor for all sorts of gardens. 

GRAVEL WALKS. 

In the graveling of walks, let the top stratum of 
stones be such as are raked from the surface of the 
garden in dry weather, and made clean by sifting. By 



450 GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 

such method, the top stratum being of small stones, 
much less gravel will suffice. To have no unnecessary 
carriage, the gravel at the pit or river side must undergo 
one sifting with a search one inch between the wires, 
disposing of all large stones. Of stuff in this state 
walks are commonly made, and. the result is evil con- 
tinually. The small sand is a seedling-bed for all man- 
ner of weeds, and the coarser part compacted with it 
renders hoeing almost impracticable. Proceed thus: — 
Use a quarter-inch search for a second sifting, and apply 
the coarse to one part of the walks and the fine to the 
other. The coarse does not bind; but it will not grow 
any weeds at all; and for dryness it is admirable. For 
the small sort — which is almost pure sand, and in most 
cases will be three to one of the gravel — thougli it binds 
and grows weeds, the Dutch hoe pares it as easily as 
moss is scraped from a tree, and so keeps it clear easily. 
Excellent walks may be made by mixing well-washed 
gravel, lime, and hot gas tar in such proportions as will 
form a black mortar. If laid on four inches thick it will 
last a very long while, always be dry, and no weeds will 
grow in it. If thicker, and on a layer of chalk or gravel, 
so much the better. 

MOSS ON FRTJIT TREES 

Scrape moss off the trunks and main branches — you 
need not meddle with the twigs — with a trowel, and burn 
it. Having cleared the trees from moss, apply the fol- 
lowing composition, viz., a peck of fresh cow-dung, half 
a peck of quick-lime, half a pound of flour of sulphur, 
some wood ashes, and a quarter of a pound of lamp- 
black. Mix the whole together with as much urine and 
soap-suds in a boiling state as will form the ingredients 
into a thick paint, and lay it on with a brush. A less 
quantity may be made, preserving these proportions.

of dark evergreens. 

To Prevent Caterpillars attacking Gooseberry Bushes, 
let the bushes be pruned as soon as the leaf is down, and 
let all rubbish be raked clear off the ground; then scrape 
with a hoe the surface earth from the stem of each bush 
to the depth of two or three inches, not exposing the 
roots ; and let all remain in this state till the middle of 
winter. By this the frost reaches and destroys the larvae. 
In digging the ground, make a deep furrow, into which 
the mold-like rings made by the hoe will be leveled, 
when a little fresh earth may be laid next to the roots in 
room of that which has previously been removed. Soapy 
water, which is best applied in mild weather, and when 
the earth has been drawn from the roots, is an excellent 
manure, and either kills the larvae, or promotes in the 
trees a more healthy vegetation.

Having stocked a greenhouse with suitable plants 
such as the foregoing (which, from practical experience, 
are strongly recommended), the great matter is to 
keep them in a healthy growing state, and getting 
their blossoms perfected at the proper season; to effect 
this, attention to the following will be desirable. 
Keep the house clean — free from insects, green-fly, 
scale, &c., let there be as far as possible a uniform tem- 
perature, and admit air whenever possible; during 
damp, foggy weather when the air is sluggish put on 
a brisk fire and let the windows be opened for an 
hour about noon. In winter be careful to use water 
the same temperature as the house, but sparingly, and 
in the morning; in summer, on the contrary, water 
such plants as remain in the house in the evening; 
remove at all times, assiduously, dead leaves, &c., 
these being not only unsightly but a fruitful source of 
moldiness and disease. Should plants from over-heat 
or other causes become infested with scale-insect, paint 
the plants over with the following: — Mix equal parts 
of soft soap, sulphur, and black pepper — the leaves 
and stems should be alike covered; the stems of such 
plants as acacias, coreas, orange trees, camellias, &c., 
may be brushed over thickly with the mixture — as this 
method introduces it thoroughly into the crannies of 
the bark; let it remain on two days, and then syringe 
the plants with tepid water till thoroughly clean — if 
properly done this is effectual. The space beneath the 
stages may, during winter, be advantageously filled up 
with such geraniums, dahlias, &c., taken up from the 
garden, that it is desired just to protect from frost; 



GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 457 

these must be cut close and watched from time to 
time, or else, if they decay and become moldy, they are 
likely to be a cause of mischief to the other occupants 
of the house. 

HINTS FOR YEAHLY WORK IN A GREENHOUSE OF 
MODERATE DIMENSIONS. 

January. Keep up equable lire heat when necessary, 
giving air cautiously, water as little as possible. Pot and 
tie out cinerarias and pelargoniums ; if mildew attacks 
the stock keep dry and powder with sulphur. Where 
there is a hot-bed sow seeds of thunbergias, ten- week 
stocks, mignonette, &c. ; watch for and keep down green* 
fly. 

February. This is a month when many plants "damp 
off," therefore keep to the foregoing rules in respect to 
watering, &c.: — begin to pot New Holland plants that 
requii^e it, and calceolarias, also Cape bulbs, amaryllis, 
&c. ; give cinerarias manure-water, to make a vigorous 
growth ; nip the shoots of young pelargoniums to pro- 
mote a bushy habit; pot liliums, giving a light rich peat 
and silver sand ; prune climbers; make cuttings of dah- 
lias and various soft-wooded plants ; search for snails, 
slugs and woodlice, just now becoming active — destroy 
spiders — also remember green-fly. 

March. Pot the majority of stock in the house ; ar- 
range neatly the blooming plants, removing such im- 
mediately as have gone out of flower, allowing hyacinths, 
tulips, &c., to wither away quietly in the pots; give more 
air than in the two preceding months, but guard against 
cold, biting winds and changes of atmosphere ; syringe 
camellias that have done blooming. Pot cineirarias, and 
smoke them to destroy the green fly. 

April. Let leschenaultias, prinelias, polygalas and 
80 



458 GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 

other New Holland plants be stopped in their new 
growth to make finer specimens ; wash and pick them 
frequently, repot pelargoniums, giving them oyster-shells 
broken fine, at the bottom of the pot, take cuttings of 
them during fine sunny days — shade such flowers as 
camellias, late tulips, &c., that become otherwise too 
fully expanded or scorched. 

May. Cut down all cinerarias that have flowered, to 
promote suckers, which, when developed, pot off for 
propagation. Keep climbers neatly trained and clean; 
put up now the outside shading blind of the house and 
moderate sunshine; give abundance of air and light; 
give budding pelargoniums manure-water once a week, 
and syringe with clear water until in blossom; give ca- 
mellias a very little water but do not let them flag — they 
should have their new bloom buds set now — remove 
heaths, eparis, &c., to frames. Clear the house of all 
bedding plants in the last week of this month, and plant 
in borders. 

June. If an open month, and of clear weather, re- 
move the whole stock to the open air, either in frames 
or on stages erected temporarily on a spare garden bor-' 
der; give abundance of water, and prune freely such 
plants as ferns, &c., that may remain for ornament 
in the greenhouse to be plentifully supplied with water 
twice a day; climbers to be trained and tied in; balsams 
to be kept close to the light. Give heaths plenty of 
air. 

July. Sow cineraria seed, also calceolaria and lobe- 
lia; cut down pelargoniums, and take freely cuttings of 
them and heliotropes, roses, jasmines, lophospernums, 
&c., keep the Japan lilies moist, and on hot days keep 
close shaded, and water the floor of the house to promote 
moist vapor. 



GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 459 

August. Continue to propagate pelargoniums — the 
cuttings will strike readily in the open garden, and will 
be stronger done that way. Keep down red-spider in 
the house, on thunbergias, &c.; on fine days collect suit- 
able soils for winter use and place under the stages. 
Now is the time to turn out any plants that remain in 
house, and scrub all paint and wood-work, and, if neces- 
sary, paint and glaze afresh the structure so as to have it 
well seasoned and purified before the return of the 
plants. 

September. By the middle of this month all the 
greenhouse-plants should be back in their places — well 
cleansed and picked over to free them from insects, and 
the pots examined for snails and slugs inside them — 
some bulbs must now be potted to bloom early, as h3'^a- 
cinths, tulips, narcissus. Cape bulbs, &c. Take up and 
let wither gradually silimus and all summer-flowering 
bulbs; sow mignonnette for winter bloom, pot violets 
for same. Gradually curtail the supply of water to cacti 
and succulent plants, remove Chinese primroses to a 
shelf near the glass, and watch against damp. 

October. Replace without further delay all plants 
from the garden that are to be housed, trimming, cutting 
back, and washing each individually. Pot all bulbs for 
winter, especially crocuses for early flowering, also lily 
of the valley. Remove all dead or yellow leaves as they 
occur, and keep vigilant search for mildew, and dress 
with sulphur; use a little fire heat on stagnant foggy days, 
but give air as much as possible. Sow mignonette to 
flower after Christmas. 

November. Treat as last month — in regard to firing 
and air — guarding against sudden frosts, keep down 
green fly, &c., and dead leaves; pot bulbs for a succession, 
shift Chinese primroses, stake them out neatly and water 



46o GARDEN MANAGEMENT. 

sparingly; keep all the foliage clean, especially of shiny 
leaved plants. 

December. Endeavor now to keep the temperature as 
even as can be — from forty to forty-five degrees at night, 
and from fifty to sixty during the day. Keep as far as 
possible a bright and flowery aspect in the house, and ar- 
range divers colored foliage plants (where flowers are 
wanting) with the bright-berried solanus and acubas to 
produce a good effect.

WHAT TO DO. 



In these pages will be found the proper course to pur- 
sue in all common ailments, accidents, wounds, aches, 
and pains. These instructions are not intended to super- 
sede but to assist the doctor. Under each head will be 
found the easiest and most effectual remedies for various 
disorders and accidents — always, when so directed, under 
the advice of the doctor, whose will must be law. The 
symptoms of disease, poisoning, fits, &c., are all given, 
and the treatment necessary until the doctor's arrival. 

Fainting. Lay the patient flat on the back, and do not 
raise the head at all, but allow it to remain on the same 
level as the rest of the body. Loosen collar, and any- 
thing tight about the neck and body; apply smelling 
salts to the nose, and hot flannels to the bosom, heart, 
and armpits; dash cold water in the face; when able to 
swallow give a little sal-volatile (say twenty drops) in 
water. The great point is to keep the head low. 

Hysterics. Lay the patient flat on the back, and keep 
the head low. Apply smelling salts and cold water as 
above. Give a little brandy and hot water, and warm the 
feet. If these fits recur often, medical advice must be 
sought. Hysterical fits are distinguished by the laugh- 
ing^ screaming and crying which accompany them. 

[461] 



462 DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 

Epilepsy. Boys are most subject to these fits. There 
is usually froth from the mouth, and great agitation of 
the body, the hands being tightly clenched. Lay the 
patient flat on his back, and raj,se the head a little. Loosen 
his shirt-collar, braces, waistcoat, &c., and hold him firm- 
ly or he will do harm to himself; splash the face well 
with cold water, and use smelling salts. To prevent the 
tongue being bitten insert the handle of a tooth-brush, 
or some such articles, right across the mouth between 
the teeth, and as far back as possible. Keep the patient 
quiet, and he will usually come round in a short time, 
if not, the doctor must be sent for. Fits of epilepsy 
are recurrent, and usually leave the person in his cus- 
tomary state; but sometimes a considerable degree of 
stupor remains behind, particularly where the disease is 
of frequent recurrence. 

Apoplexy. A man in an apoplectic state breathes 
very hard, like snoring, his face, head and eyes look 
swollen, and the body is more or less paralyzed. Put 
him to bed and send for the doctor instantly. Until he 
comes keep the head well raised, remove the collar, 
&c., and let him be kept easy and cool; apply hot mus- 
tard poultices to the soles of the feet and the thighs — in- 
side. The patient must be bled freely from the arm as 
directed {see blood-letting), and have rags dipped in 
vinegar and water, or even plain cold water, applied to 
the head. The bowels must be opened, but this is diffi- 
cult, and had better be left to the doctor. If, however, 
he does not come quickly, mix eight or ten grains of 
calomel with two drops of castor-oil, and put on the 
tongue, as far back as you can. 

On Fits Generally. Let the above treatment be prompt- 
ly attended to, and in the case of apoplexy — which is 
distinguished by the snoring, the paralysis of the body, 
the swollen head, &c. — send for the doctor with all pes- 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE.. 465 

sible speed, as the patient may die in a few minutes. 
Simple fainting fits — at the sight of blood, of fright, a 
shock, &c. — need occasion little alarm, as they seldom 
last long. In all serious cases give the patient air, send 
crying children or servants out of the room, keep cool 
and collected, for remember on your presence of mind 
the patient's life may depend. 

Blood-lettingf. Only bleed in cases of the greatest 
emergency, and when the doctor is delayed. Bind a 
handkerchief round the right arm, three or four inches 
above the elbow. Then let the hand be opened and shut; 
when the veins swell you will see one in the middle of 
the lower arm which has two branches, and the outer 
branch is the best to bleed from ; hold the lancet (a 
sh rp pen-knife will do) between the thumb and fore- 
finger, cut the vein slanting and lengthways, not deep. 
When the pulse subsides enough blood has been taken 
away. Then remove the bandage, put the left thumb on 
the cut, and when the bleeding stops put on a pad of lint, 
and bind it firmly with a handkerchief. 

Bruises. One of the very best remedies for all kinds 
of bruises is tincture of arnica, diluted in from three to 
four times its bulk of water, and rubbed in carefully. 
Vinegar and water, Eau de Cologne, brandy, soap lini- 
ment or opodeldoc are all excellent remedies if gently 
rubbed in. In more severe cases, and where the accident 
is near an important part, as the eye or any of the joints, 
leeches must be employed, repeating them according to 
circumstances. It is unwise, however, to bleed unless 
under the advice of a medical man. If considerable fever 
be present, bleeding from the arm, purgatives, and low i 
diet, may become necessary. A bread and water poul- 
tice and rest will generally do all that is necessary, after 
the application of the arnica. In the last stage, where 
there is merely a want of tone, and swelling, friction 



464 DOMESTIC MFDICINE. 

should be employed, either simply or with any common 
liniment. Wearing a bandage, pumping cold water on 
the part, succeeded by warm friction, a saturated solu- 
tion of common salt in water, have each been found suc- 
cessful. A capital liniment is compound soap liniment, 
one ounce and a half, laudanum, half an ounce; mix and 
rub in. 

Wounds. Simple, slight cuts only need that the edges 
of the wound should be placed carefully together — first 
ascertaining that no foreign matters, such as glass, splin- 
ters, dirt, &c., are in the cut — and then fastened tightly 
with diachylon (white sticking) plaster. More serious 
•wounds should be promptly treated by the doctor, but 
until his arrival a weak solution of tincture of arnica 
(one part to twelve parts of water) may safely be used, 
bathing the wound Avell. This is an excellent remedy. 
If an important part be severely wounded, such as any 
part of the arms, legs, thighs, &c., attended with a pro- 
fuse discharge of blood, compression, until a surgeon 
arrives, should be made thus: viz., tie a handkerchief or 
bandage below the wound, loosely round the limb, put a 
strong piece of stick, about a foot long, under the hand- 
kerchief, and twist it round and round until the bandage 
is tight enough to check the discharge. 

Scratches and Small Cuts should be washed clean in 
warm water, bathed in a weak solution of tincture of 
arnica, and strapped up with plaster, or if free from dirt 
simply bandage with a clean rag. If there is much in- 
flammation apply a bread and water poultice. 

Sprains. For sprained wrist or ancle make two flan- 
nel bags, each a foot long by six inches wide, fill them 
with bran and plunge into boiling water till thoroughly 
saturated, then squeeze almost dry and apply one, as hot 
as he can bear it, to the patient's ancle or wrist. Con- 
tinue this, applying one as soon as the other gets cool, 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE, 465 

for many hours; then apply a stimulating embrocation, 
and bandage well up. All strains are assisted in their 
cure by bandaging, but they should not be applied until 
hot fomentations, followed by the application of the 
embrocation with plenty of friction before a fire. This 
is a great pedestrian's advice. Sprained knees can be 
treated in the same way. 

Dislocations and Fractures. The danger of interfering 
with these matters is so great that unless an experienced 
and clever sugeon can be immediately obtained, the patient 
should be gently placed in a cab, and driven quickly to 
the nearest hospital, or, if none near, surgeon's house, 
keeping the limb as nearly as possible in its natural 
position. 

Sites and Stings. Snake bites are so uncommon in 
this country that we will simply say that sucking the 
wound, cutting out the affected parts, and cauterizing are 
necessary. Ammonia is said to be an effectual remedy. 
Wasps, gnats, bees, &c., sting very frequently, but their 
victims are easily cured, unless the part attacked be the 
eye or throat. The sting must be taken out with a needle, 
and then the place squeezed tightly, sucked, and a lini- 
ment of powdered chalk and olive oil in a paste applied 
to the part. When the sting is inside the mouth or 
throat, leeches must be at once applied, a strong gargle 
of salt and water used, and the doctor sent for. For the 
bites of dogs take imtnediately warm vinegar or tepid 
water, and wash the wound very clean; then dry it, and 
pour upon the wound a few drops of muriatic acid. 
Mineral acids attack the poison of the saliva, and its evil 
effect is partially neutralized. This treatment, however, 
good as it is, is seldom successful, there being no antidote 
to the bite of a mad dog. The doctor's aid must be sought 
instantly. Cat bites and scratches may be safely treated 
20*

with a solution of tincture of arnica freely and persever- 
ingly used. 

Falls where the Patient is Stunned. Undress the pa- 
tient, put him into a warmed bed, send for the doctor, and 
let the patient remain untouched until he arrives, even if 
it be six hours. Nothing but quiet and moderate warmth 
will do any good. 

Burns and Scalds. For all simple burns coat the place 
well with common flour, or, which is better, powdered 
whiting, or scraped potato, or cotton-wool with flour 
thickly dusted over it, or gum water, or sweet oil, and 
bind a cloth over. Even plunging in cold water will do 
good, as it answers the first necessity, — keeping the in- 
jury from the air. Soap scraped up fine, laid on, and 
bound over, is also excellent. The body should be kept 
cool, and the bowels rather open. If the burn or scald 
be more serious, and little bladders appear over the sur- 
face, spread on linen or lint a liniment made of equal 
proportions of linseed oil and lime-Avater well mixed; or 
apply a warm linseed-meal poultice. As severe burns 
and scalds are attended with great pain and irritability, 
and often with considerable danger, a doctor should be 
promptly sent for, any of these remedies being applied 
meanwhile. 

Accidental Poisoning. Send for the doctor instantly, 
and until he comes observe the following. If the thing 
swallowed causes an intense burning in the throat it is 
probably a " corrosive " poison, that is, it destroys the 
textures with which it comes in contact. Make the 
patient swallow a glass of sweet or of sperm oil, or melt- 
ed butter, or lard, whichever is most convenient to use, 
and then, within five minutes, half a pint of warm water 
in which has been stirred a teaspoonful each of table 
mustard and salt. When the poison taken is known to 
be nitric acid (aquafortis), sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol), 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 467 

or muriatic acid (spirit of salt), emetics must on no ac- 
count be given. A mixture of magnesia, powdered ciialk, 
or wiiiting, or plaster from the ceiling, and milk and 
water, made to a paste, and freely given ; or soap and 
water. When a poison has been swallowed which has no 
special effect on the throat, but causes sickness at the 
stomach, faintness, drowsiness, stupor, or any other 
strikingly unusual or unnatural feeling, let him swallow 
insta?itly the whites of a dozen eggs in a quart of water, a 
glassful every three minutes, and. as quickly as can be 
prepared, half a pint of coffee made thus ; on a teacup- 
ful of ground coffee pour half a pint of boiling water. 
Stir into it the white of an egg. After allowing it to 
rest a minute or two, pour into a cold cup, and when not 
too hot let him drink it. Then within five minutes pour 
a glass of water on a tablespoonful each of ground mus- 
tard and table salt, stir, and let him drink it instantly. 
The Ggg in the stomach more promptly neutralizes a 
larger number of poisons than any other known sub- 
stance ; the coffee acts thus on the next largest number, 
while the mixture relieves the stomach of the whole of 
its contents by vomiting. These things, too, are always 
ready and at hand. 

In the case of poisoning by laudanum (opium), the 
symptoms are very like apoplexy, the patient rapidly 
becoming insensible, and snoring heavily. The first 
care is to empty the stomach. If sulphate of zinc can 
be procured, from twenty to thirty grains dissolved in 
water are to be given immediately. Failing this, a mus- 
tard emetic must be administered, and the back of the 
throat tickled with a feather. Vomiting must be en- 
couraged by copious drafts of tepid water. During this 
time let the patient be walked up and down between two 
persons constantly and without rest for two or three hours. 
When prussic acid (which is known by its smell, resem- 
bling bitter almonds), has been swallowed, there is little 
hope, the action of this poison is so swift and deadly. 



468 DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 

Lay the patient on his stomach, and dash on to his back 
large quantities of cold water, putting him under a 
pump if convenient. Arsenic is almost as deadly. Give 
mustard and water, and try hard to induce the patient to 
vomit. In all cases of poisonous food give mustard and 
water, and afterwards castor oil (two tablespoonfuls). 
In all cases send for the doctor instantly, and his stomach- 
pump, useless in your hands, will work wonders. Re- 
member if poison is allowed to remain in the system, 
there is no hope of recovery. 

Warts. Touch lightly every other day with lunar 
caustic; or, touch them, twice a day, with a very small 
drop of strong acetic acid; or, rub them every night with 
blue-stone. Either of these remedies, if persevered in, 
will effect a certain cure. Great care must be exercised 
in applying them, as if the acetic acid or lunar caustic 
touch any other part it will cause inflammation and 
pain. 

Whitlows. Poultice with linseed meal; do not lance 
unless very slow in ripening. Heal with ointment. 

Corns and Bunions. As these are usually caused by 
wearing short, tight, or high-heeled boots, the preventa- 
tive is to wear easy ones with moderate heels, and made 
of soft leather, cloth, or oiled canvas. A bit of soft 
leather, spread thickly with soap plaster, and with a hole 
in the middle for the corn, wiU give relief. A good 
remedy is to take the skin of a hot boiled potato, and 
put the inner side of it to the corn, leave it on for twelve 
hours, and the corn will be much better. The above has 
been tried by many persons, and found to give great re- 
lief. — Another method is to rub the corn with pumice 
stone as long as it can be endured, anr" repeat until it dis- 
appears. For a bunion, if not inflamed, tho best remedy 
is to put upon it first a piece of diachylon plaster, and 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 469 

upon that a piece of leather, with a hole the size of the 
bunion cut in it. If inflamed, it must be poulticed; if 
this does not succeed and matter should form, it must be 
treated as a boil, and the matter let out with a needle or 
lancet. The following ointment is for an inflamed bun- 
ion: — Iodine, twelve grains; lard, or spermaceti ointment, 
half an ounce. Gently rub in a little piece two or three 
times a day. 

Blistered Feet. Bathe them on going to bed with 
strong salt and water, and if tender also add a little vine- 
gar and pounded alum. If the blisters are large, run a 
stocking needle through them, and leave a bit of the 
worsted in the blister. If you walk much, use a thick, 
solid, well-fitting boot, and lamb's wool socks, spreading 
soft soap on the inside of the foot of the sock, and con- 
tinue the bathing. 

Chilblains. The following may be applied night and 
morning: — Tincture of cantharides, two drachms; soap 
liniment, ten drachms; or, this ointment; calomel and 
camphor, of each, two drachms; spermaceti ointment, 
eight drachms; oil of turpentine, four drachms. Mix 
well. Apply, by gentle friction, two or three times daily. 
Snow rubbed in is said to be a remedy; as is also two 
ounces of sal ammoniac in a pint of water. When there 
is any appearance of ulceration, get medical advice. 

Bleeding of the Nose. As this is a natural effort to 
relieve an overload of blood, a moderate discharge should 
not be too abruptly checked. In the spring of the year 
drowsiness, pains in the head, &c., are often relieved by 
a slight loss of blood; but when bleeding is very profuse 
and frequent, it should be stopped. Wet cloths, wrung 
out of cold water, applied suddenly to the back, forehead 
and hands, or a key put down the back inside the clolhes, 
will often stop the bleeding. If not, put a bit of lint or 
wool dipped in cold water, or a weak solution of alum 



470 DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 

and water should be tried. Children subject to bleeding 
at tlie nose, and weakness ensuing, should have plenty 
of open air exercise, and sea-bathing. 

Perspiration. Where this is unpleasantly profuse, a 
good wash in cold spring water, rub with a rough towel 
till the blood tingles to the skin; or, put two tablespoon- 
fuls of compound spirits of ammonia into a basin of cold 
water and wash with that. This leaves the skin quite 
clean, sweet and fresh, and is perfectly harmless. 

Habitual Intemperance — to Check. The following is 
a preparation which acts as a tonic and a stimulant, and 
so supplies, in a measure, the place of the accustomed 
dram. It should be taken at the times and in the quan- 
tities at which the drams were usually drunk (say twice 
a day). Mix four grains of sulphate of iron, one drachm 
of spirit of nutmeg, and eleven drachms of peppermint 
w^ater. 

Stammering. Read aloud with the teeth closed, two 
or three hours a day for three months. This is infallible. 
Another easy and effectual cure is — tap with the finger 
at every syllable pronounced. Dr. Warren says, this, if 
persevered in, will cure the most inveterate stammerer. 

Knock-Knees. Three times a day, for an hour each 
time, tie the ancles tightly together, and put a small 
book between the knees. Increase the thickness of the 
book at each trial. Every night in bed tie the knees to- 
gether and cross the legs. Persevere in this, and the 
pain will soon pass away. 

Substances in the Throat. Swallow the whites of one 
or two eggs, and then a large mouthful of crumbs of 
new bread. This will generally carry down any such 
substances as fish-bones, pins, &c., or a large draft of 
water, or an emetic will sometimes answer the purpose. 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 471 

Substances in. the Ear. Force must never be used to ex- 
tract anything from the ear. The best and safest plan is 
to inject lul-cewarm water rather forcibly by means of a 
large syringe. — This will rarely be found to fail. Should 
the substance or the ear have become swollen, a little 
sweet oil must be poured in, and left there till the next 
day, when syringing may be again used. 

Styes are little abscesses which form on the edge of 
the eyelid. If very painful and inllamed, bathe well with 
warm water, and put on a small bread or linseed meal 
poultice; take an aperient; rub the stye with the edge of 
your nail or a ring, and when it has burst smear the edge 
of the eyelid with an oinimeni made thus: — Take of sper- 
maceti, six draclims; white wax, two drachms; olive oil, 
three ounces. Melt together over a slow fire, and stir 
constantly until cold. 

Headache arises from a variety of causes — long fast- 
ing, study, excess in eating or drinking, improper food, 
want of exercise, indigestion, mental depression, seden- 
tary occupations, and anxiety of mind. The true cure 
of headache is in fact to remove the cause. What is 
called sick headache, arising from biliousness or some 
error of diet, is accompanied by acute or dull pain over 
the temples, throbbing and incapacity for mental exer- 
tion. A draft of effervescing magnesia, a wet napkin 
round the head, and rest for a few hours will usually 
accomplish a cure. Headache from indigestion will be 
removed by anti-bili(.)us pill and a cup of strong tea. 
When the headache is accompanied by tenderness of the 
scalp and acute pain on pressure, these symptoms indi- 
cate a disturbance of the system, for which the aid of the 
doctor should be immediately sought. 

Exercise in the open air, cold water splashed over the 
face and head, and in fact any ineans which entirely re- 
verse tiie previous course of living, will be found effect- 
ive iu removing headaclie. Proper diet, cheerfulness of 



472 DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 

mind, and a regular habit of body are almost always un- 
failing restoratives. More iieadaches occur from neglect 
of the digestive organs and irregularity in the bodily 
functions than from any other cause. Remove the cause 
and the effects will disappear. F^or ordinary headaches, 
arising from too great an attention to business or study, 
strong ammonia, smelling salts, cold water on the head, 
and from ten to fifteen drops of chlorodyne in a wine- 
glass of water, will generally be found an effective cure. 
Headaches arising from functional disorders must never 
be trifled with. They are often the precursors of rheu- 
matism, epilepsy, or paralysis, and if not attended to in 
time, or yield to the simple remedies above mentioned, 
must be medically treated. 

Tooth-ache. The only real and lasting cure for tooth- 
ache is the extraction of the carious tooth. Great relief 
may, however, be obtained from putting into the hollow 
a pellet of cotton wool with one drop of oil of cloves or 
oil of nutmeg on it. A small piece of camphor kept in 
the mouth is a great relief. Creosote and all mineral 
acids destroy the teeth and are extremely dangerous to 
use, as an overdose might be permanently injurious, if 
not immediately fatal. The teeth should be brushed 
every morning and again every evening with clear water 
and powdered charcoal. When several teeth are aching 
at one time the cause is generally some rheumatic affec- 
tion, and is best cured by the application of hot flannels 
to tlie face, first rubbing the outside of the cheek with 
some soothing liniment, or a hot embrocation of poppy- 
heads. A trustworthy, though only temporary cure is : 
take a small piece of sheet zinc and a silver coin, a little 
larger than the zinc. Hold the tooth between them, let- 
ting the two metals touch each other. This is in fact a 
galvanic battery, and will act upon the nerve of the tooth 
in a very few minutes. We have tried the following very 
successfully ; make a little muslin bag, and fill it with 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 473 

ground pepper ; fasten up ; dip it in brandy or whisky. 
Put this /// the ear on the side of the aching tooth. 
Hollow teeth may be stopped, when not aching, by filling 
the hole with gutta-percha, made soft in hot water, and 
gently pressed into the tooth. This will harden, and 
prevent the air getting to the nerve. 

Ear-ache and Deafness. These are sometimes con- 
nected with chronic ulceration of the internal or external 
part of the ear, when injections of warm water and soap 
are advisable. Sometimes ear-ache continues many days 
without any apparent inflammation, and is then fre- 
quently removed by filling the ear with cotton or wool, 
wet with tincture of opium, or ether, or even with warm oil 
or warm water. Sometimes a pain in the ear is the con- 
sequence of sympathy with a diseased tooth, in which 
case the ether should be applied to the cheek over the 
suspected tooth. 

Colds and Coughs. Never neglect a cold; if promptly 
treated the worst cold can generally be cured in a few 
days. Barley water, weak tea, or gruel are all suitable 
drinks. Eat very little, and that of a very light kind, 
avoiding for a few days animal food. Drink no spirit- 
uous liquors, except a little hot rum and water, with a 
bit of butter, a slice of lemon, and sugar in it, on going 
to bed. This can do no harm, except to delicate persons. 
An excellent remedy is said to be an ounce of raisins, 
half an ounce of Spanish liquorice, and a tablespoonful 
of linseed, boiled in a pint of water until reduced to half 
a pint; then add a teaspoonful each of lemon-juice and 
rum, and drink off warm at bed-time every night until 
cured. A little can also be taken now and then in the 
day-time. If this recipe be made up in larger quantities 
and kept, do not add the rum and lemon-juice until just 
before the dose is taken. A capital cure for a cold on 
the chest is to take a large coarse flannel, dip it in boil- 
ing water, sprinkle with turpentine, and cover the chest 



474 DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 

with it instanter. The old woman's remedy of tallowing 
the nose at niglit and putting the feet in mustard and 
water, are not by any means to be neglected. 

RESTOEATIOU OF THE AEPAEENTLY DEOWNED. 

Never rub the body with salt or spirits, or roll it on 
the ground, or hold the head down. Continue the fol- 
lowing treatment for many hours, so long as there is the 
slightest hope of restoring life. Persons have recovered 
after twelve hours' insensibility. 

Strip the body and rub it dry; then wrap it in hot 
blankets, and place in a warm bed in a warm room. 

Cleanse away the froth from the mouth and nose. 

Apply warm bricks, bottles, bags of sand, &c., to the 
armpits, between the thighs, and to the soles of the feet. 

Rub the body with the hands inclosed in worsted 
socks or with hot flannels. 

To restore breathing, put the pipe of a pair of bel- 
lows to one nostril, while you carefully close the other 
v/ith your finger, and keep the mouth shut. At the same 
time draw downwards, and gently push backwards the 
upper part of the windpipe to allow a more free admis- 
sion of air. Then blow the bellows very gently, in order 
to inflate the lungs, till the breast be raised a little; then 
set the mouth and nostrils free, and press gently on the 
chest. Repeat this process, till signs of life appear. 
When the patient revives, apply smelling salts to his 
nose, and give him a few drops of warm wine, or brandy 
and water. 

To Excite Breathing. Turn the patient well and in- 
stantly on the side, supporting the head, and excite the 
nostrils w'wh snuff, hartshorn, and smelling salts, or 
tickle the throat with a feather, &c., if they are at hand. 
Rub the chest and face warm, and dash cold water, or 
cold and hot water alternately on them. If there be no 
success, lose not a moment, but instantly — 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 475 

To Imitate Breathing. Replace the patient on the 
face, raising and supporting the chest well on a folded 
coat or other article of dress. Turn tlie body very gently 
on the side and a little beyond, and then briskly on the 
face back again; repeating these measures cautiously, 
efficiently, and perseveringly about fifteen times in the 
minute, or once every four or five seconds, occasionally 
varying the side. By placing the patient on the chest, the 
•weight of the body fo?'ces the air out; when turned o?i the side, 
this pressure is removed and air enters the chest. On each 
occasion that the body is replaced on the face, make uni- 
form but efficient pressure with brisk movement, on the 
back between and below the shoulder-blades, or bones on 
each side, removing the pressure immediately before 
turning the body on the side. During the whole of the 
operations let one person attend solely to the movements 
of the head, and of the arm placed under it. The first 
measure increases the expiration, the second commences inspira- 
tion. The result is Respiration or Natural Breathing — and 
if not too late. Life. 

Whilst the above operations are being proceeded 
with, dry the hands and feet; and as soon as dry cloth- 
ing or blankets can be procured, strip the body and 
cover, or gradually reclothe it, but taking care not to in- 
terfere with the efforts to restore breathing. 

To Imitate the Movements of Breathing. Standing at 
the patient's head, grasp the arms just above the elbows, 
and draw the arms gently and steadily upwards above 
the head, and keep them stretched \\^\\<irds for two seconds. 
By this Jiieans air is drawn into the lungs. Then turn down 
the patient's arms, and press them gently and firmly for 
two seconds against the sides of the chest. By this means 
air is pressed out of the lungs. Repeat these measures al- 
ternaiely, deliberately, and perseveringly, about fifteen 
times in a minute, luitil a spontaneous effort to respire is 
perceived, immediately upon which, cease to imitate the 



476 DOMESTIC MEDICINE, 

movements of breathing, and proceed to induce circula- 
tion and warmth. 

To promote warmth and circulation, commence rub- 
bing the limbs upwards, with firm grasping pressure and 
energy, using handkerchiefs, flannels, &c.: by this measure 
the blood is propelled aloiig the vetfis towards the heart. 

The friction must be continued under the blanket or 
over the dry clothing. Promote the warmth of the body 
by the application of hot flannels, bottles or bladders of 
hot water, heated bricks, &c., and to pit of the stomach, 
the armpits, between the thighs, and to the soles of the 
feet. If the patient has been carried to a house after res- 
piration has been restored, be careful to let the air play 
freely about the room. On the restoration of life, a tea- 
spoonful of warm Avater should be given; and then, if the 
power of swallowing has returned, small quantities of 
wine, warm brandy and water, or coffee, should be admin- 
istered. The patient should be kept in bed, and a dis- 
position to sleep encouraged. 

Leeches (to apply). When leeches are ordered by the 
medical man, wash the part to be operated on with soap 
and warm water, and then with plain cold water; dry 
well. Observe that leeches will not bite if the patient has 
been taking sulphur internally, or if there be any peculiar 
odor in the room, such as the vapor of hot vinegar, the 
smoke fi'om burning brown paper, that from lighting a 
candle with a sulphur match, from blowing out a candle, 
or tobacco smoke. If the part be hot and inflamed, the 
leeches should be put, for a few minutes, into tepid water; 
and also when to be applied in the mouth, or to any very 
warm part of the body. At all times, before applied, 
they should be dried between the folds of a fine towel. 
Place the number to be used in a hollow in a towel; then, 
so to turn the towel and the leeches upon the part that 
the towel will cover them. The hand must be kept over 
the towel until all bite. If this plan cannot be pursued. 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. All 

scratch the skin with a needle, and apply the leech to the 
sptjt. When they are to be applied within the mouth, put 
each leech into a large quill; apply the open end and re- 
tain until the leech is fixed, when the quill may be gently 
withdrawn. 

Leeches should never be forcibly detached, but should 
be permitted to drop spontaneously. A bread-and- 
water poultice, not too hot, should then be laid over the 
bites, to encourage the bleeding. When a large quan- 
tity of blood is to be taken, the invalid should be kept 
warm in bed. When the bleeding is too profuse, it may 
usually be stopped by pressing into the holes small 
pledgets of lint dipped in spirits of wine, or the muriated 
tincture of steel, or touching them lightly with a pointed 
piece of lunar caustic. If neither of these methods suc- 
ceed, it will be requisite to pass a stitch, with a fine needle 
and silk, through each of the bleeding orifices. Bleed- 
ing must in every case be stopped before the patient is left 
for the night. 

Boils, Carbuncles, &c. Common boils are to be poul- 
ticed with linseed meal, or bread and water. Warm 
fomentations, as for abscesses (which see), are necessary. 
The diet of the patient should be generous, and wine 
must be given. Lint soaked with o)ive oil, and bound 
over the boil, keeps the air from it, and allows the patient 
to go about his regular business. If these means do not 
disperse the boil, medical advice must be sought, as the 
tumor may ulcerate and produce troublesome sores. 
Carbuncles are larger and more painful boils, and are to 
be treated in the same way. 

Abscesses. These are treated with linseed meal, and 
bread and water poultices, and warm fomentations; the 
bowels being kept open with mild aperients. A gener- 
ous diet, with wine, is necessary to keep up the patient's 
strength. A good fomentation is: — One ounce of bruisefl 
poppy heads, and two ounces each of camomile flowers, 



478 DOMESTIC MEDICINE, 

and marsh-mallow leaves, infused for several hours in 
two quarts of boiling water. The poultices and fomen- 
tations must be continued imtil the abscess bursts. 
When this is the case see that the matter is fully dis- 
charged, and tlien dress the wound for a day or two with 
moist rags. Then anoint \N'\i\\ spermaceti ointment and 
lint. When there is great pain, and the abscess, though 
ripe, does not burst, the "head" may be opened with a 
lancet. When an abscess is slow in ripening, a poultice 
of oatmeal and water, with a little yeast and salt, will 
stimulate it. 

Loss of Appetite. When this disorder is chronic, 
medical advice must be obtained; but when spontaneous, 
as where the stomach is loaded with bile, or crudities, an 
emetic in the evening, with some kind of stomachic pur- 
gative the next morning, will seldom fail to effect a cure. 

Vertigo usually proceeds from too great a fulness of 
the blood-vessels of the head, or is brought on by dys- 
pepsia or hysteria. When vertigo comes on, the patient 
is suddenly seized with a swimming or giddiness in the 
head, and is in danger of falling. When there is great 
fullness of blood, leeches to the temples will be neces- 
sary, as well as cooling purgatives, and spare living, un- 
til the patient has recovered. Where there does not ap- 
pear much giddiness, vinegar rags laid over the forehead 
and temples will often cure it. The patient should have 
rest, and the head be kept well raised. Plenty of cool air, 
but no draft, must be allowed in the room. 

Sore Throat. In severe cases, leeches must be applied 
under the ears. Emetics, saline purgatives, and mustard 
plasters must be employed in the cure. Simple cases 
will, however, be cured by simply rubbing the throat 
two or three times a day outside, with a camphor lini- 
ment and covering with flannel. Gargles of vinegar are 
very useful.. 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 479 

Ulcerated Sore Throat. This disorder, which is con- 
tagious, usually comes on wiih cold shivcrings, anxiety, 
nausea, and vomiting, succeeded by heat, restlessness, 
thirst, debility, and oppression at the chest ; tlie face 
looks flusl)ed, the eyes are red, a stiffness is perceived in 
the neck, with a hurried respiration, hoarseness of vcjice, 
and soreness in the throat. After a short time the breath 
becomes offensive, the tongue is covered with a thick 
brown fur, and the inside of the lips is beset with vesicles, 
containing an acrid matter. Upon inspecting the throat, 
a number of sloughs, between a light ash and a dark brown 
color, are to be observed. From the first attack of the 
complaint, there is a considerable degree of fever, with 
a small, irregular pulse, and the fever increases in the 
evening. An emetic must be given, and the doctor sent 
for, directly these symptoms are recognized. Through 
the whole illness the patient must have only liquid nour- 
ishment, such as beef-tea, gruel, barley-water, tapioca, 
sago, rice or arrowroot, wine negus, or lemonade. 
Gargles of vinegar and barley-water are used with ad- 
vantage. Keep the mouth and throat very clean. 

Inflammation of the Eyes. Dust, small flies, lime, and 
many other things occasionally get beneath the eyelid. 
These may be removed by holding the eye closed for a 
minute, when the substance will work into the corner, 
and be easily removed witli the corner of a silk handker- 
chief. The following lotion is very useful: — A table- 
spoonful of brandy, a teaspoonful of vinegar, and half a 
pint of spring water. A shade of green silk should be 
worn while the eye is inflamed, and violent light avoided. 
Bathing the head and face frequently in cold water, and 
abstaining for a time from food or drink of a stimulating 
or heating nature, will generally cure mild cases. When 
the inflammation is severe and arises from any organic 
disorder, a medical opinion must be obtained upon it, as 
what seems simple inflammation may be a constitutional 



48o DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 

disorder. Bread poultices may always be safely applied, 
but the great majority of eye-waters, eye-lotions, and 
poultices are dangerous in the hands of unskilled per- 
sons. , 

Pimpled, or Blotched Face. Many persons of sanguine 
temperament suffer from blotched faces without their 
general health being at all affected. In such cases ex- 
ternal applications of a stimulating nature — such, for 
instance, as contain alcohol, do considerable good. 
Acrid lotions must not be employed when there is much 
inflammation. For soothing the irritation a mixture of 
four ounces of yolk of eggs with five ounces of pure 
glycerine, will be found excellent. It forms a pliable 
varnish, and protects the part from the air. A lotion, 
made by pouring a quart of boiling water on to an 
ounce of broken sulphur and allowed to infuse for sev- 
eral hours, is also useful. When the pimples or blotches 
proceed from any derangement of the liver or stomach, 
lotions are useless, and the doctor must be consulted. A 
course of sarsaparilla has, by purifying the blood, often 
succeeded in these cases. 

Neuralgia (Tic Doloreux). There are several popular 
but unsafe nostrums for this complaint. Horse-radish, 
scraped or bruised, applied to the part, is, however, safe, 
and is said to cure it. Put a drachm of sal-ammonia in 
two ounces of camphor-water, and take teaspoonful doses 
now and then till the pain is relieved. The many poison- 
ous mixtures should not be taken except under the advice 
of a medical man. Chloroform is a sovereign remedy, 
but must on no account be applied by an unprofessional 
person. 

Palpitation of the Heart. During the attacks the 
quicker and stronger beating of the heart may be felt, 
seen, and even heard. The disorder is often brought on 
by tight lacing, indolence, or luxurious living: when this 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 481 

is the case, remove the cause. If it arises from plethora, 
meat and all fermented liquors must be avoided, reg- 
ular exercise and cooling purgatives employed, and the 
hours of sleep shortened. If from general debility, stom- 
achic bitters, tonics, change of air, and cold-bathing will 
be of service. When in consequence of nervous irrita- 
bility, tonics and change of air will also be proper reme- 
dies. But if the disease arises from an organic affection 
of the heart, and of the large blood-vessels that immedi- 
ately proceed from it, in consequence of aneurisms, then 
it must be treated by skilled hands, and all that can be 
done is to avoid carefully the circumstances which may 
expose to any increased action of the heart and the blood 
system — as violent exercise, fits of passion, great exer- 
tions of the body, stimulating diet, and all kinds of 
spirituous liquors. 

Dysentery is an inflammation of the mucous mem- 
brane of the intestines, attended by griping pains, a con- 
stant desire to evacuate the bowels, and a discharge of 
mucus and blood. Give a gentle emetic and afterwards 
castor oil or some saline purgative. This will usually 
ease the pain, and in a day or two it will pass .away. 

Avoid all vain attempts to discharge the contents of 
the bowels, as also all violent strainings. Warm fomen- 
tations may be applied to the anus; and when the pain 
is removed, the impaired tone of the intestines may be re- 
stored by the use of tonics and bitters, in moderation. 
Feed the patient upon light nutritive food, such as prep- 
arations of rice, sago, arrowroot, or barley, with milk; 
and light gelatinous broths. Warm clothing is very 
necessary, and flannel should be worn next the skin by 
all persons subject to attacks of dysentery. Cold, damp, 
and night air must be avoided as much as possible. A 
little wine — Port or Madeira — is useful in the progress 
towards convalescence. 

When, on the first seizure, the symptoms run high, and 
21 



482 DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 

the patient's strength is prostrated, the doctor must be 
sent for, as we have only spoken above of mild, attacks. 

Dyspepsia. The usual symptoms are : — Want of appe- 
tite, pains and distensions of the stomach, heartburn and 
costiveness or diarrhosa. The most frequent causes are 
over-indulgence in the luxuries of the table, want of 
regular exercise, both bodily and mental, the fatigues of 
business, or inebriety. The treatment depends more upon 
the adoption of regular habits than on medicine. Moder- 
ation in eating and drinking; early rising and proper ex- 
ercise; cessation from great mental study and exertion. 
Mild aperients should be taken if the bowels be confined, 
and the stomach should be strengthened by the moderate 
use of bitters and tonics. The use of a tepid bath, of 
aOout ninety-six or ninety-eight degrees of heat, for half 
an hour every other day, for two or three months, has, in 
many instances, proved of great service. The tempera- 
ture of the bath should be reduced each time, until at last 
the patient bathes with pleasure in perfectly cold water. 

The mind is to be amused at the same time that the 
body is employed. The diet in indigestion ought to be 
nutritive and generous, consisting chiefly of game, tender 
mutton and poultry; and it should be taken in three or 
four meals per diem, and never exceed a few ounces at 
any time. Due care is to be taken to masticate it prop- 
erly. Instead of fermented bread, the patient should eat 
biscuit with his food, but never between meals, or else the 
stomach has no time for repose. No diluent fluids should 
be taken at meals, nor till some time after each repast, 
nor should the quantity of the fluid taken at once exceed 
half a pint, nor be repeated oftener than at intervals of 
three hours. A moderate use of wines ought to be al- 
lowed; but should these disagree, and become acid on 
the stomach, weak brandy and water may be substituted 
for ordinary drink. Under no other circumstances 
should ardent spirits be made use of. The best food in 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 483 

severe indigestion is probably water gruel, made thick, 
slightly sweetened, and with the addition of a very small 
quantity of brandy. By taking this food for two or 
three da3's, and no other, very severe symptoms of indi- 
gestion are frequently removed, and the stomach is grad- 
ually brought to a tone, which enables it to digest food 
of a more stimulating character. 

Bronchitis, The same remarks as to diet and living 
apply to this as to asthma (which see). The symptoms 
are, running at the eyes and nose, dry cough, hoarseness, 
fever, shivering, dullness, and headache. In its mild 
form this disorder is called a cold on the chest, and is re- 
lieved by application of mustard poultices and the ad- 
ministration of small and repeated doses of ipecacuanha, 
£Vnd antimonial diaphoretics, at the same time adopting 
a light diet, and keeping the bowels open by mild laxa- 
tives. When there are unfavorable symptoms — irregular 
and feeble pulse, cold sweats, increased mucus, and pros- 
tration of strength, the doctor must be sent for without 
delay, as, if wheezing and delirium come on, there is 
real and immediate danger. 

Asthma. This disease is characterized by great diffi- 
culty of breathing, coming on in fits, accompanied by 
wheezing, cough, and tightness of the chest. It is 
brought on by sudden exposure to cold, by hard drink- 
ing, surfeit, violent exercise, and cold, damp and foggy 
weather. The best course is to seek a dry, warm, and 
airy situation, keep the bowels regular, and the stomach 
in order, and wear flannels next the skin. Chronic 
asthma is supposed to be incurable, but the paroxysms 
may be moderated by taking twenty or twenty-five 
drops of chlorodyne in a wineglass of water. Or, sit 
up in bed, or in your chair, and inhale the vapor of hot 
water, or an infusion of camomile. The following also 
give relief: — For an expectorant, take syrup of squills, four 
ounces; milk of gum ammoniacum, six ounces; wine of 



484 DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 

ipecacuanha, two ounces. Mix. The dose is a small 
teaspoonful four or five times daily. — For a tonic^ take 
infusion of gentian, four ounces; infusion of cascarilla, 
six ounces; simple syrup, two ounces. Mix. The dose 
is two tablespoonfuls three times a day. A light 
nutritious diet and strictly regular habits should be 
adopted, and will produce a marked improvement; the 
paroxysms will neither be so long nor so severe, and 
the patient will experience considerable ease both of 
mind and body. When asthma attacks a person of 
considerable age, a skilled physician should be con- 
sulted whenever possible. 

Costiveness (or Constipation). The symptoms are fe- 
verish ness, want of appetite, and headache, besides the 
defect of the regular evacuations. The great and fruit- 
ful cause of this complaint is the neglect of the regular 
and unvarying time of passing the excrement; every 
person should have a certain time, every day, and keep 
that time; morning, soon after breakfast, is perhaps the 
best. The use of bread containing alum, and water con- 
taining lime, and want of sufficient exercise, all produce 
costiveness. The disorder will be corrected by occasion- 
ally taking mild laxatives, such as jalap, senna, castor 
oil, &c. In cases where costiveness has become inveter- 
ate, and the above remedies have failed, charcoal finely 
levigated, and mixed with three ounces of confectio sennce 
and two drachms of carbonate of soda added to it, should 
be taken in doses of from half an ounce to an ounce at a 
time, as circumstances may require. Should this not 
move the bowels, get a strong pill or draft from the doc- 
tor. If a moderate quantity of green vegetables, ripe 
fruits, raisins, tamarinds and drum figs be occasionally 
eaten, and the directions above given be carried out, 
habitual costiveness will generally be overcome. Brown 
bread and oatmeal porridge are also of sig^nal service in 
these cases. Walking exercise is a great assistant to 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 485 

these remedies, as well as being an active agent in keep- 
ing the bowels regular, and in order. 

Diarrhoea. The looseness which often attends on 
teething must not be too abruptly checked, as unless it 
prevails in a great degree, it is a real benefit and relief 
to the child. If, however, there is much pain and grip- 
ing, four grains of toasted rhubarb, mixed with double 
that quantity of prepared chalk, or magnesia, should be 
given. When the diarrhoea is violent, a dose every two 
hours of Tincture of Kino (ten to twenty-five drops, ac- 
cording to age), mixed in a spoonful of syrup, will gen- 
erally check it. 

Diarrhoea in adults is, in its first stages, easily over- 
come by a few drops (never more than twenty-five at a 
time) of chlorodyne every three or four hours. This is 
the dose for a strong and full-grown person. Young or 
weakly patients must not have more than ten to sixteen 
drops. Dilute the chlorodyne in a wineglass of water. 
Or, a wineglass every hour of this mixture will give re- 
lief. Rhubarb, forty grains; magnesia, thirty-five grains; 
laudanum, sixty drops; double distilled peppermint 
water, one pint. If the disorder is not stayed in two or 
three hours, send for the doctor. 

Cholera. This dreaded disease is often epidemic. It 
usually comes on with nausea, soreness, pain, distension, 
and flatulency in the stomach, and acute griping pains in 
the bowels, succeeded, after a time, by a severe and fre- 
quent vomiting and purging of bilious matter, heat, thirst, 
a hurried respiration, and a frequent, but weak and flut- 
tering pulse. When the disease is not violent, these 
symptoms gradually cease after a day or two, leaving the 
patient in a debilitated and exhausted state; but where 
the disease proceeds with much violence, there arises 
great depression of strength, with cold sweats, consider- 
able anxiety, a hurried and short respiration, cramps in 



486 DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 

the legs, coldness of the extremities, and hiccups, with a 
sinking and irregularity of the pulse, which, in the ma- 
jority of cases, quickly terminates in death. Directly the 
symptoms are recognized — especially if cholera be epi- 
demic at the time — the doctor must be called in. Before 
he arrives, if at all delayed — give the patient a dose of 
castor oil, and let him drink copiously of barley water, 
toast and water, water gruel, or any other diluent liquors. 
A teaspoonful of laudanum may be rubbed over the 
stomach and bowels. Small doses — at intervals of about 
two hours — of chlorodyne give great relief. 

Itch. This disease consists of an eruption of little 
watery vesicles between the fingers, on the wrists, stom- 
ach, thighs, &c., which itch intensely, and the irritation 
is only increased by scratching. The disorder is very 
contagious, and the patient should not shake hands or 
mingle more than is really necessary with his associates. 
The eruption and itching are produced by a small ani- 
mal, called acarus scabiei, which burrows between the 
two layers of the skin, and hence the object in the 
treatment is to kill these animals, when the eruption and 
irritation disappear spontaneously. The best and safest 
remedy is sulphur, taken both internally and externally. 
For the ointment — which must be rubbed into all the 
affected parts every night on going to bed — take a quar- 
ter of a pound of flowers of sulphur, and mix with half a 
pound of hog's lard or butter, and four drachms of crude 
sal-ammoniac. If a drachm of essence of lemon be 
added it will remove the disagreeable smell. Every 
morning and night a teaspoonful of flowers of sulphur 
mixed in treacle or milk must be swallowed. This sul- 
phur remedy, disagreeable as it certainly is, is the quick- 
est and most effectual remedy for the itch. The patient 
should sleep by himself, in gloves and flannel drawers 
and shirt. These underclothes — except, perhaps, the 
gloves — should be worn continually for two or three 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 487 

days and nights, and then fresh ones put on, and worn 
the same period. Every morning he should wash him- 
self well all over with hot water and soft soap. By these 
means the very irritating disorder will be soon cured, 
when the clothes must all be fumigated and thoroughly 
washed and aired in the sun. 

Dropsy consists of a collection of aqueous fluid in 
some parts of the body. It is known under different 
names according to the part attacked, and is usually a 
symptom of extreme debility and a broken-down consti- 
tution. The treatment depends entirely upon the cir- 
cumstances with which the case is connected, and, there- 
fore, skilled medical advice must be obtained directly 
the following >^ymptoms are observed : distension of the 
belly, swelling of the feet and legs, difficult breathing, a 
dry skin, and very little palpitation, a difficulty of void- 
ing urine, immoderate thirst, and a dry, "hacking" 
cough. 

Inflammation of the Lnngs usually begins with shiver- 
ing, followed by considerable fever, obtuse pains in the 
chest or side, great difficulty of breathing, together with 
a cough, a very full pulse and dry skin flushings of the 
face, and thirst. This disease is very dangerous, and 
must be promptly placed under the doctor's charge. A 
vapor bath, and the inhalation of the steam arising from 
bitter herbs put into a teapot with boiling water, are ex- 
cellent aids in relieving the chest. The inhaling may be 
repeated every two or three hours. Free perspiration 
must be induced by sudorific {i.e. sweat-causing) medi- 
cines — as hops, bitter herbs, or camomile flowers, infused 
in vinegar for a few hours. When the breathing is re- 
lieved an emetic and a laxative medicine may safely be 
given. During the whole course of the disease — which 
must be watched and attended throughout by a nurse 
who follows the medical man's instructions strictly — the 
patient must be kept to his bed, lying with head and 



488 DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 

shoulders elevated. The sick room to be kept to a prop- 
er temperature, neither below fifty nor above sixty de- 
grees of heat; and the patient's strength supported with 
food of a light, nutritive nature. Thin gruel and barley- 
water should be his common drink. On recovering, ex- 
posure to cold should be carefully guarded against, as a 
relapse is apt to recur in this complaint, and which may 
bring on pulmonary consumption. In cases of inflam- 
mation of the lungs blood-letting is unwise; doctors only 
take this step in some extreme cases. 

Consumption manifests itself by pain in the side of the 
chest, shortness of breath after walking or speaking, a 
cough, which generally proves most troublesome to- 
wards morning; general emaciation and debility, and 
lastly, by hectic fever. We shall attempt nothing here, 
as to the medical treatment of consumption. A few hints 
on diet, &c., will, however, be acceptable. It should con- 
sist of such things as are nutritive and easy of digestion, 
as dishes made of flour and milk, most kind of vegetables 
and fruits, poached eggs, light puddings, custards, jellies, 
and animal broths. The various kinds of shell-fish — 
oysters, lobsters, crabs, prawns, and cray-fish — will also 
be good. All fermented liquors, but more particularly 
spirituous ones, are to be avoided. Milk is very good, 
that of the ass is usually preferred; it ought to be taken 
several times a day, in a considerable quantity, and with 
a little bread. The milk of cows may be made lighter 
by allowing it to stand for some time, and then taking 
off the cream. At the commencement of pulmonary con- 
sumption, a free use of buttermilk has frequently been 
of advantage. The quantity should be gradually in- 
creased. The patient is at all times to avoid any irrita- 
tion of the lungs, from singing, playing on wind instru- 
ments, or much speaking, or reading aloud. He should 
avoid going into crowded rooms, and should not place 
his body in a stooping position. AH kinds of bodily ex- 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 489 

ercise should be avoiderl whicli require much exertion, 
or exposure to cold. Flannel is to be worn next the 
skin all over. If the patient cannot bear flannel, he may 
try calico, but it is not nearly so good. Warmth and 
equability of temperature, especially in the winter 
months, are most essential points. Cod-liver oil is per- 
haps the most valuable remedy we possess in consump- 
tion, and may be given in doses, beginning with a tea- 
spoonful, and gradually increasing up to a tablespoonful, 
twice or thrice a day. Orange wine is the best thing for 
covering the disagreeable taste of the oil. 

Ague. The miasma of marshy ground, or stagnant 
water, usually causes it. Vapor baths, hot fomentations, 
heat applied to the feet, and plenty of barley-water, or 
gruel, may be administered during the cold stage. The 
remedy for the disease is quinine, and is quite specific in 
its effects. Administered in doses of from twenty to 
sixty grains shortly before the expected paroxysm, it 
checks it, and by continuing during the interval in 
smaller doses of from two to six grains, twice a day, the 
disease is usually cured. The patient should be very 
warmly dressed, and during the attacks, be covered with 
warm blankets. Persons subject to ague — or intermit- 
tent fever — should remove to a dry and bracing neigh- 
borhood. The air of a city is more favorable than the 
air of the country to such persons. 

In chronic cases the administration of arsenic some- 
times answers better than quinine, but a medicine so 
powerful must never be had recourse to except under 
proper medical advice. 

Erysipelas. When this disease attacks the face, it 
comes on with chilliness, succeeded by heat, restlessness, 
thirst and other febrile symptoms, with a drowsiness, or 
tendency to delirium, and the pulse is very frequent and 
full. At the end of two or three days, a fiery redness ap- 
21* 



490 DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 

pears on some part of the face, and this at length extends 
to the scalp, and then gradually down the neck, leaving 
a tumefaction in every part the redness lias occupied. 
The whole face at length becomes turgid, and the eyelids 
are so much swelled as to deprive the patient of sight. 
The danger of this disease, and its difficulty of treatment, 
make it compulsory that a skillful medical man should 
alone attempt to cure it. If such advice cannot be ob- 
tained, send the patient to the hospital. In slight cases, 
where the disease attacks the extremities, it makes its ap- 
pearance with a roughness, heat, pain, and redness of the 
skin, which becomes pale when the finger is pressed upon 
it, and again returns to its former color when it is re- 
moved. If the attack be mild, these symptoms will con- 
tinue only for a few days; the surface of the part affected 
will become yellow, the outer skin will fall off in scales, 
and no further inconvenience will be experienced. But if 
the attack has been severe, there will ensue pains in the 
head and back, great heat, thirst, and restlessness, the 
part affected will slightly swell, and about the fourth day 
a number of little vesicles, containing a limpid, and in 
some cases a yellow fluid, will arise. 

Small-Pox. The eruption generally makes its appear- 
ance about the third or fourth day after the first seizure; 
it shows itself first in little red spots on the face, neck, and 
breast, which continue to increase in number and size for 
three or four days. The eruption is commonl}'- preceded 
by a redness in the eyes, a soreness in the throat, pains 
in the head, back, and loins; weariness and faintness, and 
alternate fits of chilliness and heat, together with thirst, 
nausea, and a quick pulse. When small-pox is epidemic, 
and a person who has never had it is attacked with these 
symptoms, he ought to be immediately debarred from 
animal food, his drink impregnated with coolixig acids, 
his bowels kept open with gentle laxatives, and he should 
more particularly be exposed to a cool air. The patient 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 49X 

will be greatly refreshed, and all the symptoms become 
moderated, if there is a free ventilation of air. The tem- 
perature of his chamber should be such, that he may al- 
ways feel rather a sensation of cold, though not actually 
chilly. He ought to lie upon a mattress, covered only 
with a few bed-clothes, a feather bed being apt to occa- 
sion too much heat. This being done, the medical man 
must be summoned, and his instructions taken. 

FEMALE COMPLAINTS. 

So much mischief has been caused by quack remedies 
for the several complaints to which young girls and 
newly-married women are subject, that we dare not ven- 
ture upon giving advice. In all the functional disorders 
attendant upon tlie turn of life, marriage, &c., the only 
safe plan is to consult an experienced matron, who will 
know directly whether the case is one that needs the doc- 
tor. In other parts of this book will be found directions 
in case of fainting fits, hysterics, &c. ; but for those seri- 
ous derangements which occur from what are known as 
female irregularities we can only say, — put no faith in 
advertised pills and nostrums, as what may suit one per- 
son may do lasting harm to another. 

CHILDRENS COMPLAINTS. 

Weaning Brash occurs in children that are weaned too 
early, or in such as are reared without the breast; and 
also when improper food is given to the child, with or 
without suckling. It makes its first appearance with 
frequent griping and purging, the excrement being 
usually of a green color; sometimes there is also bilious 
vomiting. Wlien the disease has continued for some 
time, the excrement is ash-colored. The treatment con- 
sists, first, in a proper attention to diet, and a return to 
the mother's milk, if possible. Asses' milk is about the 



492 DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 

best substitute for the mother's milk. Good cows' milk, 
diluted with an equal quantity of water, and sweetened 
with a little loaf sugar, will be found the next most 
proper food. The addition of three or four tablespoon- 
fuls of lime water to the pint of milk is of great service 
in correcting the acidity in the stomach, from which 
vomiting is frequently produced in children. Pure air, 
exercise, gentle frictions, and frequent washing of the 
body with tepid or cold water, will do the rest. Flannel 
worn next to the skin, worsted stockings, and every pre- 
caution against cold, must be employed. 

Teething. In all cases of painful teething the things 
to be done are: — to keep the bowels open with mild 
aperients, to allay the irritation by rubbing with a stale 
crust of bread, to use the hot bath whenever the skin ap- 
pears mnch xn^'A.Ka.Qdi, 2ca.^ to scarify the gums. This last 
operation should — when possible — be done by the doctor; 
it is perfectly safe, and gives immediate and permanent 
relief, and prevents all after evil. If the ignorant preju- 
dice were overcome, and mothers allowed their children's 
gums to be freely lanced in all cases of painful teething, 
we should hear little of convulsions or screaming fits. 
If the doctor is not at hand take your lancet, or sharp 
penknife, and cut the gum lengthways for half an inch — 
where most inflamed — right down to the tooth. Then 
immediately make a second cut across the middle of the 
other, and as deep. This operation is almost painless to 
the child, and in most cases g\XQS insta?it relief . It should, 
however, never be done, unless the gum be much swollen 
and hard, indicating that the tooth is fully formed. It 
has been observed that children in whom there is a copi- 
ous flow of saliva suffer the least during teething, and 
that children cut their teeth more readily in winter than 
in summer. Further, that lean children cut their teeth 
more easily than fat; and those whose bowels are regu- 
larly open cut them the most safely of all. Pure air, 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 493 

proper exercise, wholesome food, and everything that 
has a tendency to promote general health, and to guard 
against fever, will greatly contribute to the child's pass- 
ing safely through teething. 

Convulsions. These infantine fits are produced either 
by teething, worms, the presence of some acrid matter in 
the inside, or wind pent up; or they arise from the ac- 
cession of some constitutional disease — as the small-pox, 
scarlatina, &c. Any trifling matter, capable of irritating 
the nervous system, will induce symptomatic convulsions 
in some infants. When convulsions proceed from any 
other cause than an eruption of the small-pox they are 
always dangerous. When the intervals are short, al- 
though the fit itself be not long or violent, the disease is 
more dangerous than when even severe paroxysms are 
attended with long intervals. First of all, put the child 
in a hot bath to cover his whole body up to the chin; if 
this cannot be done, put the child in a smaller, and 
splash him with the water. Cloths dipped in cold vine- 
gar and water may be applied at the same time to the 
head. If no bath at all is at hand, rub the spine briskly 
for several minutes with the fingers dipped in brandy, 
or other spirit. Then immediately after the bath, give an 
aperient, and a little barley-water, or weak niter and 
water. An injection of half a pint of gruel with a table- 
spoonful of castor oil added, may also be administered. 
When the convulsions occur through teething, the lancet 
must be used, and that promptly (see Teething), but when- 
ever possible, the doctor should be called in, in cases of 
this sort. The hot bath, however, is sure to be rigiit, and 
must be used in all cases. 

Jaundice. This disease comes on with languor, inac- 
tivity, loathing of food, flatulency, acidity in the stom- 
ach and bowels, and costiveness. As it advances in its 
progress, the skin and the eyes become tinged of a deep 



494 DOMESTIC MEDICINE, 

yellow; there is a bitter taste in the mouth, with fre- 
quent nausea and vomiting. When these symptoms are 
observed the patient should be put in a hot bath, and the 
medical man sent for. 

Thrush. This ailment is a source of great irritation 
and pain to young children. It is shown by increased 
redness of the nostrils and lips, white spots on the 
tongue, hot and fetid breath, and relaxation of the 
bowels. As the thrush extends over the mouth and 
throat, as well as the stomach and bowels, it is very little 
use to treat it locally. A warm bath and a little mag- 
nesia are, however, perfectly safe and good. 

It should be known that the thrush is not in itself a 
disease, but only a syjjiptom of some other morbid condi- 
tion in the system, and hence the necessity for skilled 
advice, in order that each case may be appropriately 
treated. 

Croup. This disease is very rapid and fatal in its ef- 
fects, and must be treated with the greatest promptitude 
and energy. It is a stoppage of the windpipe occasioned 
by a substance forming inside it. The disease most fre- 
quently attacks fat, heavy, short-necked children, and is 
preceded by lassitude and wheezing, followed by great 
difficulty of breathing, distension of the veins of the neck, 
and a ''crowing," or as it is called, "croupy " sound in 
the voice. These symptoms are followed by terrible fits 
of coughing which agonize the child, and cause him to 
expel a thick mucus. Z>/Vr<;//)/ these symptoms are recog- 
nized, the doctor should be sent for, the child placed in 
a bath, as hot as it can bear it, right up to the neck, and 
an emetic administered. When the patient has been sick, 
put a mustard plaster round its neck, and keep it on as 
long as the child can bear it. If the doctor has not then 
arrived, you must give it a powder made thus: — Mix six 
grains of calomel, one grain of tartar emetic, and fifteen 
grains of powdered loaf sugar together, and give one 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 495 

every twenty or thirty minutes until there is relief. Re- 
member, the first things are a hot bath and an emetic; 
these must on no account be delayed. 

Nettle Rash shows itself by an eruption on the skin, 
similar to what is produced by the stinging of nettles. It 
is generally produced by eating indigestible articles of 
food, such as shell-fish, cheese, &c. There is generally a 
little fever, and considerable itching. The body must be 
kept warm, free from all drafts, damp, &c., or the dis- 
ease may strike inward and become serious. The erup- 
tion subsides in the day-time, and increases in tlie even- 
ing. A little opening medicine, and a gentle emetic 
(proportioned to the age of the patient) are generally suf- 
ficient to effect a cure. 

Mumps. This disorder is often epidemic, and consists 
of a swelling on one or both sides of the neck. Tliis 
swelling usually continues to increase, becomes large, 
hard, and somewhat painful, till on the fourth day it be- 
gins to decline, and a few days later entirely goes off, as 
does the fever likewise. The mumps do not often re- 
quire more than to have the head and face kept warm, to 
avoid taking cold, and to keep the bowels well open. 
Should the swellings in the neck disappear suddenly, 
and the fever increase, so as to affect the brain, it will be 
necessary, however, to call in a doctor, as strong lini- 
ments and warm fomentations are immediately neces- 
sary. 

Scald Head. This disease (which is closely allied to 
mngworm, and is treated in the same way) is exceedingly 
contagious, and each case must be carefully kept 
separate. On no account must the child use another 
person's hat, comb, brush, or any other article that 
touches the iiead. Lunar causiic rubbed (jver the ring 
is, we believe, the surest and speediest remedy, but it 
must only be administered by a skilled doctor. The 



496 DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 

hair must be cut short, the head washed with soft soap 
every morning, and the following lotion applied every 
night: Two drachms of sub-carbonate of soda dissolved 
in a pint of vinegar. This is safe and tolerably efficaci- 
ous, but as this loathsome disorder will rapidly spread, 
the doctor's aid had better be sought. Indeed in many 
instances — not only with the ringworm, but with other 
contagious diseases — people by attempting to supersede 
the doctor, do great harm, and only aid the disorder. 
The simple rules laid down in this book may, however, 
be safely followed. 

"Worms. The symptoms are a variable appetite, fetid 
breath, acid eructations, pains in the stomach, grinding 
of the teeth during sleep, picking of the nose, paleness of 
the countenance, hardness and fullness of the belly, slimy 
stools with griping pains now and then; heat and itching 
about the anus, short, dry cough, emaciation of the body, 
slow fever, and sometimes convulsive fits. Cowhage, or 
cowitch, is believed to be a safe and certain remedy, and 
having only a mechanical action, it may be given to the 
most delicate infant; all that is necessary being to mix it 
with a little thick water gruel, taking care that it does 
not touch the skin of the face or hands; there is no danger 
in the contact with the moist part of the lips, consequently 
nothing is more easy than to administer it with a spoon. 
The dose for a child may be from five to ten grains, or 
even more, for it is not medicinal; and an adult may take 
from fifteen to thirty grains without the slightest incon- 
venience. The effect of this remedy is astonishing. It 
acts upon the skin of the worm, and so irritates it that it 
looses its hold upon the intestines, and soon dies; it is 
then expelled by the natural course of evacuation; its 
expulsion may be hastened by the administration, twelve 
hours after taking the cowhage, of a dose of castor oil, or 
any other simple purgative. Cowhage is to be obtained 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 497 

at any druggist's. This ti-eatineiit has succeeded when all 
other means have failed. 

For the cure of the tape-worm, which is the most dif- 
ficult to expel, the male fern has been much recom- 
mended. The dose for an adult is from one to two 
drachms. After two doses have been taken, a purge is 
to be employed. The oil of turpentine taken internally, 
in about one ounce for a woman, and one and a half for 
a robust man, is also used in cases of tape worm, with 
good effect. Dr. Graham, a high authority, writes: — " I 
believe that there are few cases which will resist the 
proper use of salt, if the usual means of strengthening a 
weakly constitution be resorted to, and saccharine sub- 
stances avoided as much as possible. Salt is particularly 
obnoxious to all kinds of worms. I would, therefore, 
advise persons troubled with these animals to increase 
their quantity of salt at each meal; to lessen that of every 
kind of sweet food; to avoid partaking much of vege- 
tables; to regulate the bowels by the occasional employ- 
ment of a mild pill, and to avail themselves of the usual 
means of strengthening the general habit, by having re- 
course to active exercise daily, early rising, the use of the 
cold or tepid bath, &c. These measures are highly advis- 
able and useful, whatever kind of medicine be employed. 
At the same time a dose of salt and water, for example, 
an ounce or two of common salt, dissolved in nearly half 
a pint of water, should be taken in the morning fasting, 
and repeated at the end of three or four days. This will 
generally act as a purgative, and will certainly bring 
away almost every kind of worm. This plan is applicable 
to the cases of children as well as to those of adults, and, 
from what I have before said, it will be perceived how 
necessary it is for them to be restricted in the use of sweet 
things, and be taught to make a free use of salt at almost 
every meal. As a purging portion for young children 
half an ounce of salt dissolved in a quarter of a pint of 
water will usually be found a sufficient quantity."

Measles. The eruption is usually preceded by a chil- 
lines and shivering, succeeded by heat, thirst, anxiety, 
pains in the head, back, and loins, heaviness and redness 
of the face and eyes, with an effusion of tears, swellinp^ 
of the eyelids, nausea, and sometimes a vomiting of bil- 
ious matter; and, added to these, there are hoarseness, 
dry cough, and a discharge of acrid matter from the 
nose. About the third or fourth day, small red spots 
appear in clusters about the face, neck, and breast; and 
in a day or two more the whole body is covered with 
them. On the fifth or sixth day the spots, from a vivid 
red, are changed to brown, and begin to dry away about 
the face; about the eighth or ninth day they disappear 
on the breast, and other parts of the body, with a mealy 
desquamation of the cuticle. Medical advice must always 
be obtained ; and the following instructions followed 
out: The patient should, besides, drink freely of good 
barley-water, and linseed tea, gently acidulated with 
lemon juice. A warm bath will also be of service, doing 
away with the necessity of bleeding. During the whole 
course of the complaint, the patient ought to be confined 
to his bed, and avoid any exposure to cold air, as it 
would probably interrupt the eruption; but great heat, 
and too heavy covering of bed clothes, must also be 
avoided. The degree of temperature must be regulated 
by the patient's feelings. A liquid and cooling diet 
should be adopted at the commencement of the measles, 
always taking care not to carry it so far as to produce 
debility. When the measles prevail epidemically, con- 
fine such children as nevsr had them to a vegetable diet, 
giving them a gentle opening medicine once or twice a 
week, as they will then be likely to have a mild form of 
the complaint. The greatest care is necessary in the 
progress to convalescence. 

Scarlet Fever. In the mild form of scarlet fever (or 
scarlatina), the disorder begins with languor, lassitude. 



DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 499 

confusion of ideas, chills and shiverings, alternated by- 
fits of heat. After a little, the thirst increases, the skin 
becomes dry, and there is anxiety, nausea and vomiting. 
On the second or third day, the scarlet efflorescences ap- 
pear on the skin; after three or four days they disappear, 
and are succeeded by a gentle perspiration; the fever 
then subsides, and the outer skin falls off in small scales. 
In malignant scarlet fever, the patient is not only seized 
with coldness and shivering, but with great languor, 
debility, and sickness, followed by heat, vomiting of 
bilious matter, great soreness of the throat, short and 
laborious breathing, and a quick, small, and depressed 
pulse. In the progress of the disease, a general redness 
pervades the face, body, and limbs, which appear some- 
what swollen. The eyes and nostrils are likewise red; 
and from the latter there is an acrid discharge. A ten- 
dency to delirium prevails. In the malignant form the 
symptoms undergo no change on the fir^t day; but on 
the following the pulse becomes small and irregular; the 
tongue, teeth, und lips are covered with a brown or 
black crustation. The breath is extremely fetid, the 
respiration laborious, the deglutition painful, the head 
becomes retracted, an acrid dit^charge flows from the 
nostrils, the tonsils and the adjoining parts are covered 
with dark sloughs, and deafness and delirium comes on. 
The rash is usually pale, and changes soon to a dark or 
livid red color. 

In its very mild form, and when unattended by 
any inflammation or ulceration, nothing further will 
be requisite than to keep the apartment clean and 
open, to follow a light diet, without animal food, to 
use acidulated liquors for drink, to take some gentle 
opening medicine, and to keep a hot bran poultice 
round the throat from the first symptom till the eighth 
or ninth day. In the more severe forms of the disease, 
administer an emetic on the first coming on of the 
fever, and send for the doctor. During convalescence, 



500 DOMESTIC MEDICINE. 

the greatest care is necessary against exposure to cold, 
even in the mildest attacks. These precautions are 
necessary until the process of desquamation (falling off 
of the cuticle) is completed, which is seldom less than 
about a fortnight. If the patient is exposed to cold 
during this period, internal congestion, as of the kid- 
neys, occurs, and dropsy supervenes. This is always 
a dangerous and intractable complication, and hence 
it should be known that the danger is not always over 
when the fever has subsided. 

Whooping Cough. This is a convulsive cough, in- 
terrupted by a full and sonorous inspiration, usually 
terminating by a vomiting or expectoration. The 
cough usually comes on with an oppression of breath- 
ing, some degree of thirst, a quick pulse, and other 
symptoms of fever; to which are succeeded hoarseness, 
cough, and a difficulty of respiration. These symptoms 
continue for about a fortnight or three weeks, when 
the cough becomes convulsive, and assumes the peculiar 
sound which is called a whoop. After the complaint 
has attained its height, it usually continues for some 
weeks, and then goes off gradually. In some cases 
it is, however, protracted for several months. The 
whooping, though very fatiguing, and subject to a re- 
turn of violence on any fresh exposure to cold, seldom 
proves dangerous, except when the patient is very 
young, or when it is accompanied with some compli- 
cation, such as bronchitis. It seldoms happens that a 
person has this disease more than once. 



LAW. 



ADVICE TO HIM THAT GOES TO LAW. 

Nine things are requisite: — A good deal of money, a 
good deal of patience, a good cause, a good attorney, 
good counsel, good evidence, a good jury, a good judge, 
and, lastly, good luck. Even with all these things a wise 
man should hesitate before "going to law." 

The object of the succeeding pages is to enable per- 
sons to find out for themselves how the law stands upon 
many of the common subjects of dispute. Where the 
course to be followed is not stated here, the reader may 
take it for granted that the subject presents difficulties it 
would be unwise to combat without legal advice.

BILLS OF EXCHANGE. 

A bill of exchange is a bond by virtue of which the 
acceptor promises to pay to the drawer or holder a cer- 
tain sura on a certain day, thus: 

^400. New York, ist Jan., 1882. 

Two months after date pay to the order of John Jones 
four hundred dollars, value received. 

James Brown. 
To Mr. Henry Robinson, 

200 Wall St., New York. 

Mr. Henry Robinson writes across the face of this the 
word "accepted," and the place where payable — either 
his bankers' or elsewhere — signs his name under that or 
below the word accepted and the bill is perfect. The 
bill when due must be presented for payment at the 
place where it is made payable; if no place is stated, but 
merely the word "accepted" and the acceptor's name 
written under that word, then it is payable at his place 
of business, as stated at the left-hand corner. 

Mr. John Jones, in presenting it or passing it away 
must sign his name also on the back of the bill, and every 
subsequent holder must do likewise. 

Every person who indorses a Bill of Exchange be- 
comes a surety, and undertakes that the bill shall be dis- 
charged when it becomes due. The acceptor of a bill is, 
however, absolutely and formally liable upon it, no mat- 
ter how many or what indorsements there may be upon 
it; and the drawer and indorser or indorsers are only 
collaterally and conditionally liable to the owner, if the 
acceptor make default. Every subsequent indorser is a 
surety for each prior indorser. But an indorser as such 
is not liable to the acceptor, and a subsequent indorser 
as such is not liable to a prior indorser. 



LA W. 503 

The Non-presentment of a Bill for payment on its be- 
coming due will not afford a defense to an action brought 
against its acceptor for the amount. Drawers' and in- 
dorsers' liability ceases if no notice of the dishonor of a 
bill be given by the holder at the time of its falling due, 
or within a reasonable period after; but the acceptor's lia- 
bility never ceases. A " reasonable period " in respect 
to unpaid bills has been held to be three days. 

If a Bill is Accepted and made Payable at a Banker's, 

and the acceptor can prove that he lodged funds at the 
banker's, at the proper time to pay it, the acceptor would 
be relieved if the holder failed to present it in due course, 
and the money were lost by the subsequent failure and 
stoppage of payment by the banker. 

If a bill is made payable at a certain place, the holder 
is not bound to present it for payment elsewhere, even 
though requested by the acceptor; and if it be dishonored, 
the holder may sue all the parties whose names are on 
the bill, even though funds were provided elsewhere to 
meet it. 

The loss of a Bill is not fatal to the recovery of the 
amount, provided an indemnity be given to the satis- 
faction of the court or judge, against the claims of any 
other person upon such bill. 

Foreign Bills of Exchange, or Promissory Notes, drawn 
in, but payable out of, the United States, should be drawn 
in sets of three or more. 

Accommodation Bills. These are bills for which there 
is no consideration. An indorsee of an Accommodation 
Bill, who has only paid part of the amount for which the 
bill was drawn, can only recover what he paid; but an in- 
dorsee who has given value for an Accommodation Bill, 
can recover from the acceptor, even though when the 
indorsee became holder, he was aware of the acceptor 



504 LAW. 

having received no value or consideration. If, however, 
the holder has no bona fide claim to the possession of 
the bill, he will have no better interest in it than that 
of the persons from whom he received it. 

Days of Grace. In the United States three days of 
grace are allowed on all bills, whether payable at a cer- 
tain specified time after date, or at a certain specified 
time after sight. Bills payable on demand are, however, 
immediatel}' payable on presentation, without any grace 
days. Bills not expressing ihe time of payment are con- 
sidered as payable on demand. 

The law of the place where the bill is made payable 
governs the allowance or non-allowance of the grace 
days, which vary in different countries. Thus, in Eng- 
land, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, it is three days; in 
the United States, three days; France, none (ten days 
were formerly allowed, but were abolished by the Code 
Napoleon); Berlin and Vienna, three days each; Amster- 
dam, Rotterdam, Antwerp, and Naples, none; and Brazil, 
fifteen days, &c. 

When a bill falls due on Sunday or other Holiday it is 
payable on the day previous. 

Days of Grace are counted exclusive of the day on 
which the bill would otherwise have fallen due — thus a 
bill dated March ist, and payable at six months after 
date, would be payable on September 4th following, un- 
less that day were Sunday, when it would be due on 
the 3d. 

Any alteration of the date of a Bill of Exchange, after ac- 
ceptance, — except it be authorized in writing by all whose 
names appear upon the bill, — whereby the payment 
would be accelerated, nullifies the bill; and even if in 
the hands of an innocent holder, no action can be 
brought upon it. Except against parties consenting to 
atiy material alteration in a bill, such alteration nullifies 
it. If, however, the acceptor writes the alteration in 



LAW. 505 

words before he signs his name, that will legalize the 
alteration. If the amount in writing in the body of a 
Bill differs from the amount in figures at the top left- 
hand corner, the former is held to be the correct 
amount. 

Promissory Notes differ from Bills of Exchange in 
being signed by one person instead of two. The usual 
form is: — 

$100. New York, 23d February, 1882. 

One month after date I promise to pay to Mr. James 
Smith, or order, one hundred dollars, for value received.

BILLS OF SALE. 

A Bill of Sale is an assignment of personal property 
— often given instead of a mortgage — as security for a 
debt or loan. 

To prevent frauds upon creditors, every Bill of Sale 
to be valid must be filed with the clerk of the county. If 
this be not complied with, the Bill will not avail to pro- 
tect goods against assignees in bankruptcy or any other 
creditors, 

The Preparation of Bills of Sale or mortgages need 
not necessarily be done by an attorney, though it is the 
safer course. 

Where two or more persons give a Joint Bill of Sale 
on property belonging to them as copartners, the deed 
may be executed by each at different times, the bill dat- 
ing from the time the first partner signed it. Bills of Sale 
are so frequently resorted to for the purpose of defeating 
just claims that they are viewed by the Law Courts 
with very general suspicion. In all cases the party in 
whose favor the bill is made, must be able to prove 
clearly the integrity and fairness of the transaction, and 
that valuable and adequate consideration was given. 

If the vendor continue in possession of the goods, it is 
22 



5o6 ZA TV. 

a presumption of fraud; therefore the party secured by 
the Bill of Sale should take possession, or be repre- 
sented on the premises by a person actually holding the 
document. 

In the case of an absolute Bill of Sale, unless there have 
been a substantial and bona fide change of possession 
of the goods — exclusive possession under the assign- 
ment, and not concurrent with the assignor, — an exe- 
cution creditor cannot be defeated by it, and it is consid- 
ered by the law to be fraudulent and void, as against 
all creditors. 

But, when the bill is on\y given by way of mortgage, and 
possession is conditional on default in payment of debt 
or loan, and postponed until such default occur, then 
fraudulent conduct is not implied. 

Though a sale or transfer at a very low price is not 
necessarily a fraud, yet when the consideration is wholly 
inadequate, that fact is an implication of fraud, and will 
cast suspicion upon the bill. 

If, prior to the making and execution of a Bill of Sale, 
there has taken place no proper valuation of the goods 
transferred, the law infers that the transfer was not in- 
tended to be real and bona fide. 

Copies of Bills of Sale or Mortgages must be filed anew 
every year, and unless this be done, the document be- 
comes worthless. 

Without proof of value and due consideration, the 
assignment by a person on the eve of his trial for a capi- 
tal offense, cannot be upheld. 

. MORTGAGES. 

A mortgage is a grant made by one person to another 
of certain lands, in consideration of money lent, to secure 
the punctual repayment of the money in installments, 
on a certain day, and the interest at such rate, and pay- 
able at such times as may be agreed. The mortgagor 



LA W. 507 

(the borrower) gives the mortgagee (the lender) power 
to sell the property on default of payment of any part 
of the principal or interest. 

The mortgagee has no further right to the estate or 
property than to secure himself the repayment of the 
money advanced. 

If there be any breach of condition — that is to say, de- 
fault in payment of either principal or interest at the 
proper time, — the mortgagee can commence an action for 
the sale of the mortgaged premises. 

This proceeding is called the '■^Foreclosure" of the 
mortgage. 

/// the case of a joint mortgage — that is, where two or more 
persons advance money, in either equal or unequal pro- 
portions — the debt and security for the debt will become, 
in the eyes of the lait', the property of the survivor or 
survivors of the mortgagees; but in equity there will be 
what is termed a " tenancy in common," that is, the sur- 
vi\'or or survivors becomes a trustee for the legal repre- 
sentative, or representatives, of his deceased copartner, 
or copartners, in the transaction. 

In the case of a vci7x.w purchasing an estate subject to ct 
mortgage — he having no contract or connection Avith the 
mortgagee — he does not render \i\mse\i perso7ially liable 
for the debt; and if in the event of the property being 
sold, the proceeds are not sufficient to pay out the mort- 
gagee, the estate only is liable, and not the other property 
of the man who bought the encumbered estate. 

When, however, there is "a new proviso for redemp- 
tion on payment," i. (?., when the purchaser of the mort- 
gaged estates enters into a covenant, to pay, with the 
mortgagee, he is he'd to have assicmed the debt personally, and 
any other property he may have is liable for the debt. 

A Mortgage of a Leasehold aXw^ij includes the good- 
will of the trade, if any, carried on in the premises; 
and also the fixtures. 

When More than One Mortgage is existing upon the 



5o8 LAW. 

same property the mortgage first recorded takes prefer- 
ence, but in such case consult a respectable attorney. 

THE LAW OP LA]^DLOED AND TEHA:^T. 

Letting and Hiring. In every case of hiring premises 
— whether house, land, apartments, warehouse, or any de- 
scription of premises — there should be a simple, but ex- 
plicit agreement tn wrUing, giving the date of the con- 
tract, the full names and addresses, and other means of 
identification of the contracting parties, and an accurate 
description of the property, with the amount of rent, time 
of payment, arrangement as to repairs, and term of no- 
tice required on quitting the premises. Such an agree- 
ment is binding on both parties. 

But if the Landlord lei the Apaj'tmejits to another tenant 
before the expiration of the notice-month he can only 
recover up to the time of such second letting. Leases are 
made for any length of time, but the period must be 
clearly stated. 

Repairs. Unless a landlord has agreed to be so, he is 
not liable for repairs; and where no agreement or stipula- 
tion has been made, the lessee or tenant is absolutely lia- 
ble for all necessary rej:)airs. Lf Premises are bur7it or 
blown down, the lessee or tenant must, if he covenant to 
keep the premises in repair, still do so; and if he agree to 
pay rent, he must still pay it, until the expiration of his 
regular and legal notice — if it be given. All L?jiprove- 
mejifs, Buildings, JSrectio7is, Landlord' s fixtures, Trees a7id 
Shrubs, must be left, unharmed, by the tenant at the ex- 
piry of his tenancy, even though he made, erected or 
planted them himself. 

A Tenant has Power to Assign or Underlet any part or 
the v/hole of the dwelling-house, or other premises, dur- 
ing his own term of tenancy, unless such underletting is 
stipulated against in his agreement with his landlord. 

Persons Hiring or Letting Furnished Apartments should^ 



LA W. 509 

each possess a copy of a list of the articles of furniture 
contained in the room or rooms so lei; such copy should 
be alTixed to or written on the agreement made between 
the parties. Lodgers having apartments on either the first 
or second floors of a house, have the right (unless it be 
otherwise agreed at the time of hiring), of the use of the 
water-closet, the door-bell, and the knocker. The lodger 
cannot, however, refuse to pay his rent, or deduct aiiy part 
of it, if the use of either be refused him; nor can he, if 
the use of the wash-house, cellar, and other hired part of 
the house be denied him. The only course is to pay the 
rent, and sue the landlord for breach of contract; but if 
the cojitract be not in writing, the lodger has no remedy. 

A Tenant or Lodger may leave a furnished house or 
furiiisJied apartments if he discover them to be infested 
with bugs or other noxious vermin, directly, and without 
paying any rent whatever; but he must do so immediately he 
discovers the fact of their presence, and be prepared to 
prove that the house was not lit to inhabit by reason of 
such infestation. By staying afterwards he admits the 
inhabitability of the house or apartments, and is liable 
both for rent and proper notice. A71 Innkeeper is respon- 
sible for goods stolen from lodgers' rooms, but a lodging- 
house keeper is not. 

In the Case of a Tenant Paying Taxes, such taxes being 
borne by the landlord, he must deduct the said payment 
from his next payment of rent, tendering the receipts for 
the said taxes, and the balance in cash. The tenant, if he 
neglect to deduct it then, cannot, without the landlord's 
consent, deduct it afterwards; but he can sue the land- 
lord on the receipts. 

Fixtures put up for the purpose of carrying 
on any trade or calling, may be removed by the ten- 
ant at the end of his tenancy, but he must repair all 
damage done either by them or in their removal. He 



510 LAW, 

may also remove gas-fittings, Venetian blinds, orna- 
mental cornices, ornamental chimney pieces, chimney 
glasses and pier glasses, tapestry, stoves, and other arti- 
cles put up by him for ornament or convenience, always 
remembering to leave the place uninjured by them. 

Trade Fixtures generally, unless it is specially stated 
to the contrary in the agreement, may be removed by the 
tenant if he put them up. 

LEASES. 

A tenant who takes a house on an agreement or lease 
of more than three years is liable for repairs. 

A Lease may be Assigned or Sold unless there is a special 
provision to the contrary. No Notice of Leaving is neces- 
sary on the termination of a lease, the tenant having 
simply to give up possession of the premises. 

Form of Agreement for a Lease of a House and Prem- 
ises. An agreement made and entered into this eighth 
day of January, 1881, between William Thompson, of 

, in the county of , of the one part, and 

George Williams, of , in the county of , of 

the other part. Whereby the said William Thompson 
agrees that he will by indenture to be executed on or be- 
fore the seventeenth day of September, next ensuing, 
demise and let to the said George Williams all that mes- 
suage, tenement, or dwelling-house, with the garden, out- 
buildings, and appurtenances thereunto belonging, situ- 
ated in the parish of , in the county of , 

now or until lately in the possession and occupation of 
Henry Brown. To hold the same to the said George

from the aforesaid seventeenth day of September, for 
and during the term of twenty-one years, at the yearly 
rental, payable quarterly, of % , clear of all deduc- 
tions except taxes, &c. And in the aforesaid lease there 
shall be contained covenants on the part of the said 



ZAIV. 511 

William Thompson, his executors, administrators, and 
assigns, for quiet enjoyment, and to allow out of the 
first two years' rent of the said premises, the sum of 

$ towards the repairs thereof. And also that he, 

the said William Thompson, will indemnify the said 
George Williams, his executors, administrator, and as- 
signs, against the payment of the ground-rent thereof 
during the said term of twenty-one years. And on the 
part of the said George Williams, liis executors, admin- 
istrators, and assigns, to pay the aforesaid yearly rental 

of $ . To keep in repair the said messuage and 

outbuildings, together with and including all doors, 
gates, fences, walls, rails, posts, &c., and leave and de- 
liver the same at the end or expiration of the said term 
of twenty-one years, in good repair (damage by fire only 
excepted). And the said lease shall contain all other 
usual and reasonable covenants as between landlord and 
tenant, and a proviso for re-entry on non-payment of 
rent. And the said George Williams hereby agrees to 
accept a lease on the terms and conditions hereinbefore 
set forth. And it is agreed that the costs of this agree- 
ment and the said lease, and a counterpart thereof, shall 
be borne equally by the said parties. As witness our 
hands, this eighth day of January, one thousand eight 
hundred and eighty-one.

An agreement drawn up in the preceding form and 
manner, altering the facts as may be necessary, may be 
prepared by any one; but the lease itself should, in all 
cai'es, be drawn up by a regular attorney. 

NOTICE TO aUIT. 

A notice to quit by the landlord to his tenant must be 
signed by the former, or by some person — as his agent — 



512 ■ ZAJV. 

duly authorized to give it. By the same rule the tenant 
giving his landlord notice to quit, must sign such notice. 
In both cases the notice should be served on the per- 
son to whom it is addressed, or his acknowledged and 
accredited agent. 

Service of Notice is also held good if left at the tenant's 
or landlord's house; in either of these cases,- however, 
the person leaving the notice should have an exact 
copy of it in his possession, and indorse upon such 
copy the name of the server, date of serving, and on 
whom, giving the name of the servant or other person 
receiving the notice from him. 

The Time of Notice is the Time of Letting, — i.e., a weekly 
letting can be ended by a weekly notice, a monthly let- 
ting by a monthly notice; and a quarterly letting by a 
quarterly notice. When, however, the letting is by the 
year, three months' notice, expiring at the period of the 
year at which the tenancy commenced, is sufficient. 

If Rent be at so much per Anmun, even if paid quarterly, 
three months' notice is necessary. 

A Notice to Quit must be given irrespective of sub-let- 
ting by the original tenant, which has not the effect of 
altering the terms of the tenancy. 

If a tenant leave without notice, and the landlord ac- 
cept rent from a new occupier, he thereby accepts him as 
his tenant, and releases the former one from all liability, 
except for any rent due; otherwise the former tenant will 
remain liable until his tenancy shall be legally deter- 
mined by a notice to quit. 

A Notice to Quit may legally be served at any time when 
reasonable access can be obtained to the person. 

A Misdescription of the premises in a notice to quit 
is not fatal, if the description be sufficiently exact as not 
to mislead the person on whom the notice has been 
served.

EJECTMENT. 

An action for ejectment may be brought by a landlord 
for non-payment of rent ; or, on the determination of a 
tenancy ; by a mortgagee ; and also in cases where the 
possession of real property is sought to be recovered. 

If a persoin be allowed to retain possession for twenty 
years of any house, land or other real property, without 
payment of rent or acknowledgment in writing to any 
person, such holder or possessor has an absolute title to 
the property against any claimant, and is enabled to de- 
feat an action to eject him. This does not of course ap- 
ply to leaseholds, copyholds, or any such contract. 

If a Mortgagee allow his mortgagor (that is, the person 
to whom he lent money) to remain in undisturbed pos- 
session of the estate mortgaged, without payment of 
principal or interest, or any part thereof, for twenty years, 



Si6 LAW. 

he (the mortgagee) will in most cases lose his interest 
in the estate, and be unable to force the occupier out by 
action of ejectment. 

By "undisturbed possession" is meant taking no 
steps to recover principal or interest, and receiving 
neither, either in whole or in part; the simple writing 
of a letter applying for tiie money would constitute an 
"attempt to recover," and would legalize the mort- 
gagee's claim. 

An action for Ejectment must he defended, otherwise — 
whatever Right or Title the owner or occupier may have, he 
will in the eyes of the law be considered as having failed 
to prove his claim. 

A person bringing an action of ejectment must conclu- 
sively prove his own title to the estate, and will not obtain a 
verdict because his opponent's title is not good. 

In the case of a landlord bringing an action of eject- 
ment against a tenant who has forfeited his right of pos- 
session, — by non-payment of rent, non-compliance with 
the terms of lease, or other sufficient cause, — a formal 
demand for the rent must first be made (if there be suffi- 
cient goods to satisfy the claim), at a convenient time be- 
fore sunset, on the last day on which the rent can, ac- 
cording to the terms of the agreement, be paid. The 
demand must be for \.\\q precise sxxxu. due. If the tenant do 
not then pay, an action to eject him can be sustained. 

When a writ of Ejectment cannot be served upon the Occu- 
pier, by reason of his absenting himself, or otherwise 
evading service, it shall be deemed sufficient to affix the 
writ to the outside of the main door of the house. 

FiaE INSURANCE. 

A policy of insurance against fire is a contract by 
which the insurer, in consideration of a certain premium 
received by him, either in a gross sum or by annual pay- 
ments, undertakes to indemnify the insured against all 



ZAJV. 517 

loss or damage he may sustain by fire, in his house, 
buildings, stock, goods, or mercliandise, during a limited 
period of time. 

A Policy is 7iot in its Nature Assignable, nor ca7i it be 
Transferred, without the express consent of the insurer; 
when, liowever, any person dies, his interest shall re- 
main in his executors or administrators, respectively, 
who succeed or become entitled to the property, pro- 
vided such representatives respectively procure their 
right to be indorsed on the policy. 

That a Policy may be Legal it is necessary that the per- 
son insured should have a bona fide interest in the 
property at the time the policy was made, and also when 
the fire occurs. Any trustee, mortgagee, reversioner, 
factor or agent, has sufficient interest in the goods under 
his custody to effect a policy of insurance, provided the 
nature of the property be distinctly specified at the time 
of executing such policy. 

The Insured can only Recover to the extent of his in- 
terest, but tile sum for which the premium is paid may 
with safety be oiie-third or one-fourth less then the full 
value of the property insured, because it seldom happens 
that the loss is total; and when the insurance is to the 
full value, the person rather gains than loses by a fire, 
which may excite suspicion, and occasion expensive and 
troublesome litigations. 

The risk cojnmences from the signing of the policy, un- 
less there be some other time specified. Policies of in- 
surance may be annual, or for a term of years, at an an- 
nual premium; and it is usual for the office by way of 
indulgence, to allow a few days after each year for the 
payment of the premium for the next year in succession. 

The Premises Insured must not be so altered as to no 
longer agree with the policy description of them : there- 
fore additional buildings added to the house, without 
notice to the assurers, would nullify the policy. 

A Policy is not rendered Null and Void by the simple 



5i8 LAW. 

alteration in the trade or use to which the insured prem- 
ises are put unless such alteration entails greater risk. 

Furtiiture, insured in one house, is not protected after 
removal to another, unless notice be given to the insurer, 
and the policy then altered accordingly. 

Conditions of liability. Most of the offices insert in 
their policies certain conditions of liability; for instance, 
they exempt themselves from payment of the sum 
insured in all cases in which fires have been occasioned 
by invasion by a foreign power, or any military power, or 
civil commotion. The printed proposals of the various 
offices contain the terms on which the contract is made, 
and the conditions upon which they agree to insure. 
These proposals must therefore be strictly complied 
with; and when any loss happens, the insured person 
must give notice im7nediately of the loss, giving as full and 
particular an account of the articles destroyed as pos- 
sible. 

LIFE mSURANCE. 

The value and importance of Life Insurance need 
not here be insisted upon, nor is it necessary to dwell 
upon the great care necessary in selecting an office. 
Having made a choice — and here we may remark, 
that, though the rates of insurance differ, and in some 
offices they appear high, there are often corresponding 
advantages given — the next course is to obtain a form 
from the office, which contains questions respecting 
age, habits, state of health, and other matters, all 
which questions nmst be answered fully and with 
scrupulous regard for truth, for if any mis-statement 
be made, even by accident, the policy may be vitiated ; 
and if the mis-statement be proved to be willful, the 
office can legally refuse to pay any claim, and all the 
sums contributed will have been lost. If an application 
be rejected on account of ill health, or a tendency to 
hereditary disease, offices are to be found which will 



LAW. 519 

insure unsound lives, at an increased charge propor- 
tioned to the extra risk they incur. 

To enable any Person to Ifisure the Life of Another, he 
must have some interest in the life, and the insurance 
must be made with the full consent of the other party, — • 
thus, a wife may insure the life of her husband, being 
dependent upon him for support, — and again, a creditor 
may insure the life of the debtor. There is no such thing 
as an Lndisputable Policy, for the law holds that fraud will 
vitiate any contract. Notice must be Given to the company 
insuring, when the person wishes to leave the country; 
failing such notice, the policy and all moneys paid may 
be forfeited, as some companies consider a sea voyage an 
extra risk, and all charge increased premiums in un- 
healthy climates. 

False Representation, either in answer to the printed in- 
quiries or to verbal questions, will even, if accidental, 
nullify the policy; it is, therefore, of the last importance 
that candor, truth, and exactness be rigidly observed in 
any transaction of this kind. 

WILLS. 

A Will is a disposition of property, which is made by 
a person, to take effect after his decease. Every person 
Capable of binding himself by a contract is capable of 
making a will. 

No Will is Valid, unless it be in writing, and signed at 
the foot by the testator, and signed by two witnesses in 
the testator's presence, and in presence of each other; 
and such witnesses must have both seen the testator sign 
his name, and be requested by him to sign as witnesses. 

A Will is Revoked by the subsequent marriage of the 
testator; by any subsequent will; by any writing proved 
to have been written by the testator, revoking or declar- 
ing any intention to revoke; by burning, or by tearing 
off the signature, either by the testator or by some other 



520 LA W. 

person in his presence, and by his request or order; by 
any codicil to the will revoking any part of it (a codicil 
is considered an amendment to the will, and revokes, or 
confirms parts or all of it). 

Form of a IVill. The following is the simplest form 
of will, being devised to one person: — 

This is the last will and testament of me, Richard 
Brown, of New York, in the County of JNew York, 
merchant. I give, devise, and bequeath all the real and 
personal estate of which I shall be possessed or entitled 
at the time of my decease unto my wife, Mary Brown {or 
son, or daughter or other person as the case jfiay be), abso- 
lutely, and I appoint my said wife {or as the case may be) 
sole executrix of this my will, and revoke all previous 
Wills by me at any time heretofore made. In witness 
whereof I hereunto set my hand this Second Day of De- 
cember in the year of our Lord One thousand Eight 
hundred and Eighty-one. Richard Brown. 

Signed by the said Richard Brown, the testator, in 
our presence, and who in our presence, and in the 
presence of each other at the same time, subscribe 
our names as witnesses, and at his request.

LAW OF MASTER AND SERVANT. 

In every hiring the contract should be in writing, in 
the form of a simple agreement, stating plainly what both 
parties bind themselves to do. The best possible agree- 
ment is a letter stating the terms, and an answer accept- 
ing them. 

Where no time is expressed, and there is no general 
custom or implication, or other means of ascertaining the 
probable intentions of the parties at the time of the hir- 



LAW. 521 

ing, then such hiring is held to be a general, or yearly- 
hiring. 

But any stipulation at the time of hiring whicli is not 
consistent with the theory of the yearly hiring will defeat 
such theory. 

In cases where the hiring is a yearly one, either so ex- 
pressed or so held after agreement, it cannot be ended, 
generally, by either party until the end of the year from 
the time of hiring. 

Therefore, — though if a servant wrongfully quit or is 
rightfully dismissed his master's service during the year 
he cannot recover, — a servant wrongfully dismissed has 
a claim upon his master for the full year's wages, or such 
portion as may be unpaid at the time. 

Domestic and menial servants generally are, however, 
subject to the well-known and established rule which 
allows either party to end the service by giving a month's 
notice to the other, or by paying a month's wages in lieu 
of such notice. The month's notice must be given on the 
day preceding (at latest) the day on which the servant is 
usually paid; or, if not paid monthly, tlien on the last 
day of one month, to leave at the end of the following 
month. If a servant be paid weekly, fortnightly, or 
monthly, or any other stated period, that usually deter- 
mines the length of notice to be given when there is no 
other agreement or stipulation to the contrary. 

Among the principal causes for which a master would 
be justified in discharging his servant without notice are 
— dishonesty, habitual intemperance, or negligence, gross 
moral misconduct, incompetence, or willful disobedience 
to lawful commands. If, after such dismissal, a servant 
refuse to go, he may be removed. 

If a servant be feloniously robbed of property belong- 
ing to his master, he is not, if he were commonly pru- 
dent, liable for the loss. But if he were grossly negli- 
gent he would be liable to an action for the value of the 
lost goods. On this point the law holds that "a servant 



522 LA W. 

is bound to take due and proper care of his master's 
property intrusted to him; but lie is not bound to pro- 
tect such property at all risks." 

When his service is ended, a servant may lawfully set 
up in business, and solicit custom from his late master's^ 
customers; but he may not do so while he is actually in 
his master's service. 

If a servant be improperly discharged before the ex- 
piry of the time for which he was hired, he may bring 
an action against his master for wrongful dismissal; 
which action should not be brought until the expiry of the 
time for which he agreed to serve. If the servant, how- 
ever, obtain another service before such time has expired, 
he can only recover of his former master down to the 
time of his entering upon the second service. 

A master is the only person who can bri ng an action for 
seduction. This is so because the law holds that the loss 
of service consequent upon his female servant's seduction 
is a real grievance, for which damages may be obtained. 
But it is not necessary that the servant should be a paid 
servant; a parent may bring the action if it be proved 
that his daughter performed any domestic service in the 
house. If, however, the daughter is in the actual service 
of another, the action must be brought by her master. 
The age or condition of the woman — whether maid, wife, 
or widow — is immaterial in an action of this kind. 

If a servant be performing his master's lawful orders, 
the latter is held liable for the effects of his servant's neg- 
lect or carelessness. But if the servant be acting without 
his master's knowledge, and have no precedent for his 
action, the master is held harmless. 

No servant is bound to obey unlawful orders, and if 
he do so it will be on his own responsibility; a master is 
bound to indemnify his servant from the consequences of 
anything done in obedience to his lawful orders; or if 
they were not lawful, but the servant believed they were. 

Though a master must not expose his servant to un- 



LAW. 523 

necessary risk, yet he is not answerable for injuries sus- 
tarned in the discharge of ordinary duties. Thus it is 
held that if a master provide proper tools or implements, 
the servant cannot compel his master to recompense him 
for injuries received, the implication being that the serv- 
ant was aware of these risks when he entered the serv- 
ice. 

A master or mistress is not legally obliged to give a 
character when dismissing him or her, unless the former 
agree to do so at the hiring. It is important, therefore, 
that the servant arrange with the master to receive a 
character on leaving his employ. 

A master must, in giving his late servant a charac- 
ter, say or write what is true of him, if the application be 
on the part of a bona fide inquirer who would engage 
such servant. The character given, even though it charged 
the servant with grave misconduct, would not render 
the master liable to an action, if the charges were true, but 
it would if they were not, and malice, or wish to do the 
servant harm, could be inferred. 

APPRENTICESHIB. 

The Indenture of AppreJiticeship need not be prepared 
by an attorney ; any one may make out the bond, but he 
would not be allowed to make a charge for so doing. The 
following is the usual form : — 

This indenture witnesseth, That , son of , in 

the county of , by and with the consent of the said 

, his father, testified by his sealing and delivering of 

these presents, doth put himself apprentice to , of 

, in the parish of , in the county of , to learn 

his art, and with him, after the manner of an apprentice, 

to serve from the day of , until the full end and 

term of years, from thence next following, to be 

fully complete and ended ; during which term, the said 



524 LA W. 

apprentice his said master faithfully shall or will serve, 
his secrets keep, his lawful commands everywhere gladly 
do. He shall do no damage to his master, nor see it 
done by others, but to his power shall let, or forthwith 
give notice to his said master of the same. The goods of 
his said master he shall not waste, nor the same without 
license of him, to any give or lend ; hurt to his said 
master, he shall not do, or cause or procure to be done ; 
he shall neither buy nor sell without his master's license, 
nor from the service of his said master, day or night 
absent himself during all the said term. And the said 

doth hereby promise and agree to teach and instruct, 

or cause to be taught and instructed in the best way and 

manner that he can the said apprentice, in the said , 

in all its branches, which he now useth. And for the 
true performance of all and every the said covenants and 
agreements, each of the said parties bindeth himself 
unto the other firmly by these presents. In witness 
whereof, the said parties to these presents have hereunto 

interchangeably set their hands and seals, this day 

of , in the year of our Lord , 

Sealed, &c. 

The indenture making an apprenticeship may be dis- 
solved by any of the following events : — The lapse of the 
time for which the apprentice was bound; the coming of 
the full age of tweniy-one ; the death of either master or 
apprentice; the bankruptcy of the master; on proof of 
willful misconduct on either side ; and by mutual con- 
sent of all the parties to the indenture. 

The Readiest Way to Cancel Indentures, in cases where 
the cancelmcnt is by mutual consent, is to cut off from 
the document the signatures of the contracting parties, 
to indorse upon the bond the date and particulars of the 
cause of dissolving (which memorandum or indorsement 
should be signed by all the parties interested), and then 
to hand to the apprentice his canceled indentures. 



LAW, 525 

Apprentices absenting themselves from their master's 
service without leave, may be compelled to return and 
serve out the absent time, or make such satisfaction for 
it, as shall be considered sufficient by the justice, — who, 
in default of return or other satisfaction, may commit 
the refractory apprentice to prison. Where, however, the 
apprentice has served seven years, he cannot be forced to 
serve any longer. 

Where the master becomes bankrupt (and the inden- 
tures thereby canceled) the apprentice by his friends may 
apply for a return of the premium (if any) paid. This 
application will be considered by the court, and if any 
portion be refunded it will come out of the estate. If a 
master misuse his apprentice in any way, the justices 
have power — should they deem the ill-treatment suffi- 
cient — to order the discharge of such apprentice from his 
indentures; and the premium, or any part of it, must be 
returned on their order, and it may be distrained for, 
and if that will not satisfy the claim, the master may be 
imprisoned for a term not exceeding two calendar 
months. 

An apprentice may legally refuse to work on Sunday. 

An apprentice is bound to remain in his master's em- 
play wherever he resides, unless there is a special stipu- 
lation to the contrary in the apprenticeship indentures. 

An apprentice is not released from his indentures if 
he bound himself to a firm, and one or more of the part- 
ners retired or died, provided the business was carried 
on by the remaining partner or partners. 

An apprentice is not bound to serve the widow of his 
late master; as the contract was a mere personal trust, it 
ends on the death of either master or apprentice. 

Neither is an apprentice bound to serve his late mas- 
ter's executors, nor can the latter transfer him, or other- 
wise control his actions. No portion of a premium paid 
with an apprentice can be recovered, should either the 
master or apprentice die before the expiry of the term. 



526 LAW. 

Though the whole of an apprentice's time belongs by 
law to his master, he cannot be compelled to work for 
an unreasonable time, or at unreasonable hours. There- 
fore the time of work must be governed by custom and 
precedent in the particular trade or business. Where, 
however, the indentures specially bind the apprentice to 
work longer hours than is customary, he must be bound 
by his indentures. 

A deed of apprenticeship is valid, though antedated. 
The dating back is an advantage to the apprentice, be- 
cause it acknowledges previous services. 

An apprentice can be assigned with his own consent, 
and he is then bound to serve his new master. 

NUISANCES. 

The following are nuisances: — 

Any premises in such a condition as to be injurious 
to health; any foul ditch, gutter, water-course, privy, 
urinal, cesspool, drain, or ashpit, so foul as to be a nuis- 
ance, or injurious to health; any animal so kept, or any 
accumulation or deposit, which is injurious to health. 

The way to set about having these nuisances removed 
is to complain to the Local Board of Health, who exam- 
ine into the case, and have power to procure the abate- 
ment or disallowance of the nuisance complained of. 

It is a nuisance to collect a crowd to the annoyance 
of a neighbor; or to make unusual or startling noises at 
night; or to pollute a running stream by throwing (or 
allowing to be thrown) rubbish or foul matter into it; or 
to let off fireworks, pistols, guns, or other explosives, or 
to burn fires in the street; or to permit the collection of 
offensive matter outside your house; or to place obstruc- 
tions on the foot-way; or to allow areas to remain open 
or unprotected, or partially so; or to expose for sale un- 
wholesome food of any description, &c., &c. 

In any of these cases the offender must make good 



LA W. 527 

any damage done or caused by his neglect or misconduct, 
and pay, on conviction, certain penalties. 

LIBEL. 

Any publication in writing, or in print, which im- 
putes dishonesty, fraud, or immorality, or in any way 
tends to injure the private character or public credit of 
a man, or attempts to make him look ludicrous or con- 
temptible, is a libel, and actionable, unless the accusa- 
tions are true, and can be proved to be true. 

A malicious libel is where there was no occasion or 
justification for the writing complained of, and where 
the intention was, inferentially, to annoy or degrade the 
libeled person, A libel is punishable by civil action, and 
also criminally by indictment. 

SLANDER. 

This may be merely words spoken hastily and with- 
out malice; and unless special hurt or damage can be 
proved to have arisen out of the slanderous words, an 
action will not, generally, lie. But if the words be com- 
mitted to writing, the offense becomes a libel, and is 
punishable. The law thus recognizes a wide distinction 
between libels and mere words spoken, or slanders; for 
while the former is a grave offense, and punishable both 
criminally and by civil action, the same words, or worse, 
if spoken would not be punishable at all, unless the com- 
plaining party could prove that they had injured him ia 
his business or private character.
