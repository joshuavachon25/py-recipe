FOREWORD 

"A good cool( can vary the flavors of food as a composer varies 
his orchestral colors and harmonies^ getting genuine artistic as ivelV 
as gastronomic pleasure therefrom."- — Henry T. Finch. 

OF THE many duties that fall to the housewife, none 
are of greater importance than the planning and 
preparation of the meals. Life is maintained 
through the intake of air, water and food. But food must 
be digested before it is of avail to the body. Cooking 
renders food more or less digestible according to the 
method used and its adaptability to that particular food. 

Until recent years, little attention has been paid to 
the scientific preparation and selection of foods. For 
many years men have been versed in the proper feeding of 
stock, but strange to say, it has only recently occurred to 
man that equally as good results come from the proper feed- 
ing of the human being as from the scientific care of animals. 

The medical profession as well as other scientific men 
are now turning their attention to dietetics to such an ex- 
tent that it is to be hoped that most of the chronic illnesses 
may soon be a thing of the past and that human life may 
be prolonged and health instead of disease become con- 
tagious. 

For some years, scientific men have been trying to de- 
termine both the amount of food and the proportion of 



FOREWORD 

food constituents, viz., protein, fat and carbohydrates, 
necessary to maintain a normal man in health. 

Various scientists have established dietary standards 
based upon observations of the dietetic habits of groups or 
classes of people. But we are indebted to Prof. R. H. 
Chittenden, dean of physiology, Tale University, for the 
most scientific study ever conducted along this line. 

As the result of his experiments, we now know that the 
health and efficiency of the organism is not only maintained 
but is increased by the use of a lesser quantity of food and 
a smaller proportion of protein than was formerly supposed 
necessary. Standards based upon Prof. Chittenden's ex- 
periments are said to be "low-protein." 

Housewives who have long been accustomed to provid- 
ing meat and other "high protein" dishes for their families 
are ofttimes at a loss to know how to prepare a well-bal- 
anced meal without these articles and at the same time 
serve a palatable and attractive one. 

We are indebted to Pawlow of Russia for demonstrating 
the relation between appetite and digestion. His experi- 
ments have shown that digestion is markedly affected by ap- 
petite, which in turn is stimulated by three senses, viz., 
sight, smell, and taste. 

Hence it is almost equally as important that food should 
be prepared appetizingly as that it should be weU cooked. 
Many "food reformers" and faddists have attempted to 
prepare wholesome foods but have neglected the almost 
equally important reqmrement — palatability. 

This combination of wholesomely prepared and palatable 



FOREWORD 

foods constitutes in a sense a New Cookery. It is the hope 
of the author that this little volume may be of serrice to 
many who may need a guide in the cookery which has for 
its object, efficiency of body and mind. 

The author wishes to express her indebtedness to Dr. 
and Mrs. J. H. Kellogg who first inspired her with a love 
for the study of foods and their scientific preparation and 
who have since been constant sources of help and encourage- 
ment. 

She would also acknowledge her indebtedness to Miss 
Clara B. Lambert, who for several years was associated with 
the author and has contributed to this volume both by 
helpful suggestions and by numerous recipes. 

To Mrs. Bstella F. Ritter and numerous other assistants, 
also to many friends, students, and several members of the 
staff of cooks at the Battle Creek Sanitarium, she is also 
grateful for contributed recipes or helpful suggestions.

The New Cookery 

CHAPTER I 

OOKING is the art of preparing foods for the 
nourishment of the body by means of dressing 
or the application of heat. Cooking includes 
the preparation of foods without heat. Fresh 
fruits, nuts, frozen dishes, salads, fruit 
beverages and some vegetables are prepared 
without the aid of heat. Dried cereals and most vege- 
tables as well as some fruits require the application of heat 
as a preparation for digestion; but we are continually 
learning through scientific research the necessity of includ- 
ing in the bill of fare a more liberal share of natural food- 
stuffs which have not been subjected to the chemical changes 
produced by a boiling or baking temperature. 

Heat is a result of combustion, a chemical process 
whereby oxygen is united with other substances. The term 
as usually applied means a rapid imion of oxygen with some 
combustible substance, whereby heat and light are produced, 
such as occurs when wood or coal is ignited. 

Oxygen is one of the eighty or ninety elements out of 
which all the material universe is made. It is an invisible 
gas in which substances burn readily but which of itself does 
not produce heat, although it is absolutely essential to com- 
bustion. It is the active constituent of the air, hence a 
draft — air — is necessary for heat production in a stove or 
range. 

A fuel is a substance which unites with oxygen to pro- 
duce heat. All fuels contain carbon in large quantities 



2 THE NEW COOKERY 

and hydrogen and oxygen in considerable quantities. The 
amount of heat produced by a fuel is dependent upon the 
proportion of these two elements. Carbon is the essential 
element in all of the solid and semi-solid fuels and is also 
a component part of the liquid and gaseous fuels. Char- 
coal and coke are almost pure carbon; anthracite coal is 
about ninety per cent carbon. Hydrogen forms an impor- 
tant part in all of the gaseous fuels and also enters into the 
composition of all the solid and semi-solid fuels with the 
exception of charcoal, coke and pure anthracite. 

TO BUILD A FIRE 

It is quite as important that the cook should understand 
the mechanism of her stove as that an engineer should 
understand his machine. Before undertaking to use the 
stove the covers should be removed, doors opened, and 
a thorough inspection made to discover where the dampers 
are located, how they operate, etc. The essential parts of 
a stove are, a fire-box, grate, ash-box, stove pipe, oven and 
dampers for drafts. The door below the fire-box is the 
opening for the admission of oxygen. There is also an 
oven damper, a damper in the stove pipe and a damper at 
the top of the fire-box opening into the fire. The greater 
the amount of oxygen admitted, the greater is the amount 
of heat produced, hence when starting a fire the oxygen 
draft or door below the fire-box is opened as weU as the 
damper m. the stove pipe, thus creating a direct draft. To 
quickly reduce the heat close the damper in the stove pipe, 
shut off the oxygen draft and open the check draft which 
is in front of the stove and just above the oxygen draft. 
It is also above the fire-box. For baking, close the oven 
damper which forces the heated air around the oven 
before it enters the pipe. The oven is a metal box sur- 



THE ART OF PEEPAEING POODS 6 

rounded by a space through which the heat travels. The 
metal is a good conductor and allows the heat to penetrate 
its walls, thus imparting it to the foods which it contains. 

The steps in building a fire are as follows : 

1 — Clean out the stove. 

2 — ^Brush ashes from the top of the oven. 

3 — Place the materials for making the fire. 

4 — ^Regulate the dampers. 

5 — Brush the stove and the hearth. 

6 — ^Blacken the stove if necessary. 

7 — Apply the match. 

8 — Polish the stove if blackened. 

9 — Eegulate the drafts. 

STRUCTURE OF THE GAS FLAME 

The gas flame consists of three distinct portions. The 
inner portion which is almost invisible consists of the un- 
burned gas which comes in a constant stream, due to the 
pressure of the gas system. Surrotmding this inner portion 
is a luminous section which consists of carbon particles 
heated to the point of luminosity by the ignited hydrogen. 
The outer portion of the flame forms an almost invisible 
sheath consisting of the burned particles of carbon and 
the hydrogen. The inner or dark portion gives absolutely 
no heat. The luminous portion supplies some heat, but the 
greater amount of heat is supplied by the outer, the al- 
most invisible section. When more gas is supplied than 
can be oxidized, the carbon particles of the gas are only 
partially oxidized, and hence produce a yellow flame rather 
than a blue one. This is due to too great a pressure or an 
insufficient amount of air which is necessary for the combus- 



4 THE NEW COOKERY 

tion. The gas flame must have oxygen as well as any other 
flame. This is admitted through a small opening called the 
mixer, which is placed a short distance from the flame. 
Indeed, if a sufficient amount of oxygen is admitted through 
the mixer, it is possible to oxidize all of the carbon particles 
so that the luminous portion is omitted entirely. This then 
produces the blue flame, so much desired for heating pur- 
poses. 

TO LIG-HT THE TOP BUKNER OF A GAS RANGE 

Light the match; turn the gas on full; apply the 
match and regulate the flame. If the gas bums yellow, turn 
it off at once. Turn on and allow the gas to flow a few 
seconds and relight. 

TO LIGHT OVEN BURNERS 

Open both doors of stove. Light match. Turn on mid- 
dle burner or lighter at side of stove and apply match 
quickly close to the stove. Turn on the two side burners. 
Turn off middle burner. Look in broiling oven to see if 
properly lighted. Close the oven door. Close the broiler 
door slowly. It is important to take the precaution of open- 
ing both oven doors before applying the match, as gas 
sometimes escapes into the oven, causing an explosion when 
the match is applied. 

TO REGULATE HEAT OF THE OVEN 

Turn the gas on full for five or six minutes, or until the 
oven reaches the desired temperature, then turn the burners 
partly off. Always allow at least ten minutes for regulating 
the temperature of the oven. 

The methods of cooking are boiling, stewing, steaming, 
broiling, baking, frying, sauteing, braising, frieasseeing and 
fireless cooking. 



THE ART OF PEEPARING FOODS O 

Boiling is cooking in water at a temperature of 212 de- 
grees Fahrenheit. This temperature is indicated by the 
bubbling which takes place as the steam and watery vapor 
are given off. The escape of steam means loss of heat. It is 
impossible by the ordinary methods of cooking to raise the 
temperature of water above 212 degrees Fahrenheit. An 
excess of heat escapes in the steam which is given off, hence 
it is not economical to "cook foods violently, as water in 
violent agitation conveys no more heat to the foods than 
that which is bubbling gently. 

Foods are said to simmer at 185 degrees F. 

Stewing is cooking in a small amount of water at a low 
temperature, 160 degrees to 180 degrees F., for a long time. 

Steaming is cooking in contact with steam at 212 degrees. 
This is usually accomplished by placing the food receptacle 
in a colander, which in turn is set over a vessel of boiling 
water. The colander is then covered to prevent the escape 
of the steam. Steamers are also used for the same purpose. 
Foods are also said to be steamed when cooked in a double 
boiler. This is also sometimes known as dry steaming. 
Foods cooked in the inner portion of a double boiler never 
boil, but may reach a temperature of 200° to 206° F. 

Broiling is cooking over or before a clear fire or glowing 
coals. Broiling may also be done under gas. The food to be 
broiled is usually placed on the broiler and laid near the 
coals. The object is to first sear the outside in order to 
prevent the escape of the flavor and juices, then a lower 
temperature is maintained to penetrate to the inner portion 
of the food. The food to be broiled must be turned fre- 
quently to prevent the escape of the juices. 

Pan Broiling is an adaptation of this method to modern 
methods of cooking. This is accomplished by placing the 
food over a hot griddle with only sufficient fat to prevent 
sticking. The food must be turned often as for broiling. 



6 THE NEW COOKERY 

Boasting is also cooking before a clear fire mucli the 
same way as for broiling. This method has given way al- 
most entirely to baking, though we still use this term when 
applied to certain articles cooked in the oven. 

Baking is cooking in the oven. Different temperatures 
are needed for the cooking of various kinds of foods. A 
slow oven is approximately from 275 degrees to 350 degrees 
Fahrenheit, a moderate oven 350 degrees to 400 degrees 
Fahrenheit, a quick oven 400 degrees to 475 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 

Frying is cooking by immersing in hot fat. The tem- 
peratures should vary according to the variety of food 
used. Foods prepared in this way are much less digestible 
than when prepared in almost any other way. This is due 
both to the effect upon the fat and the effect upon the food 
constituents. Fats subjected to the high temperatures for 
frying are somewhat decomposed and made less digestible. 
There is some uncertainty as to just what changes take 
place, but the probabilities are that it is broken down 
into the two component parts, a fatty acid and glycerine. 
Acrolein is also formed when the fat is overheated. 
The fumes which irritate the eyes and the nasal passages 
when standing near frying fat are due to the acrolein. 
Starches subjected to the heated fat are undoubtedly more 
or less saturated with it, thus delaying their digestion until 
the fat has been digested. Fats are attacked only by the 
bile and pancreatic juices, hence the starches are unduly 
delayed in their digestion when saturated with fat. Pro- 
tein is hardened and made less digestible by the high tem- 
peratures, hence foods cooked in frying fat are made less 
digestible both by the change which takes place in the fats 
and in the foods. 

Sauteing is cooking in a small quantity of fat. Foods 
prepared in this way are considered even less digestible than 



THE ART OF PEEPAEING FOODS 7 

when fried. This method is frequently called frying, 
though improperly so. 

Braising is a combination of stewing and baking. 

Fricasseeing is a combination of sauteing and stewing. 

Wireless Cooking is a combination of boiling and cooking 
by conservation of heat. This is accomplished by insulated 
receptacles, which are so constructed as to prevent the radia- 
tion of heat. Foods are first brought to the boiling point 
and then placed in the insulated receptacle. The remainder 
of the cooking is accomplished by the heat which is retained, 
because of the non-conducting substances surrounding the 
receptacle. 

HOW TO MEASURE • 

Exact proportions or correct measuring is as essential to 
good cooking as to the work of the chemist. Indeed the cook 
is dealing with chemical combinations as truly as is the 
pharmacist or chemist. 

The following articles are necessary for measuring : half 
pint measuring cup divided into fourths and thirds, a table- 
spoon and case knife. Exact measurements call for level 
measurements. 

The tablespoon and teaspoon should be the regulation 
size. Sets of measuring spoons may be bought at most hard- 
ware stores and at stores where kitchen furnishings are kept. 
Sixteen tablespoons make 1 cup. To measure a cupful, fill 
to a little more than the brim by placing materials into the 
cup with a spoon, never dragging the cup through dry ma- 
terials. With the cutting edge of the knife brush off all 
materials which are piled above the brim. Do not shake the 
cup to level the materials. For measuring liquids fill just 
to the brim. 

To measure a tablespoonful, fill the spoon rounding or 
heaping full and with the cutting edge of the knife brush 
off all that extends above the edge of the spoon. If a half 

(2) 



8 THE NEW COOKERY 

tablespoon is desired, divide the contents of the spoon 
lengthwise and push off one half. If a fourth is desired, 
divide the remaining half crosswise of the spoon and push 
ofiE the portion not desired. If one-eighth is desired, divide 
the remaiaing one-fourth crosswise and push o£E the un- 
desired portion. If one-third of a spoonful is desired, di- 
vide the contents of the spoon crosswise into thirds, pushing 
off the undesired portion. The teaspoon is measured in the 
same way. 

To measure spoonfuls of liquid dip the spoon into the 
liquid. 

To measure butter or other solid fats, pack solidly into 
the measure and level off with the knife the same as for dry 
materials. 

It may sometimes be necessary to vary the constituents 
somewhat owing to the variation in the quality of the ma- 
terials. Recipes in which flour plays an important part are 
necessarily only guides, as different qualities or varieties of 
flour require different amounts of liquid. A recipe in 
which eggs form a chief constituent may also be varied ac- 
cording to the size of the eggs. Materials which pack, such 
as flour, powdered sugar, com meal, etc., should be sifted or 
stirred before measuring. 

HOW TO COMBINE INGREDIENTS 

Pood materials are mixed by one of three methods; 
stirring, beating or folding. 

Stirring is accomplished by a rotary motion of the arm. 

Beating is a rapid rotary movement of the forearm by 
which the ingredients are turned over and over, the ladle or 
spoon touching the bottom of the utensil at the end of each 
stroke made by the hand. This movement is for the pur- 
pose of incorporating air. 



THE ART OF PREPARING POODS 9 

Folding is accomplished by means of a spoon or an egg 
whip. The spoon or whip is first put down vertically 
through the materials (this process is sometimes known as 
cutting), then is brought up again through the materials, 
freed by gently shaking and then put down again, the 
whole process being repeated several times, or until the 
materials are well blended. This method is used where it is 
desirable to prevent the escape of air previously incor- 
porated by beating. 



CHAPTEE II 

BEVERAGES 

A BEVERAGE is a flavored drink, the chief constituent of 
which is water. 

Since the body requires from four to five pints of water 
daily, a beverage is a wholesome article providing it contains 
no deleterious substances. 

Unfortunately our common beverages, tea, coffee and 
chocolate each contain a stimulant which affects both the 
nervous system and the heart. 

They also contain tannin, an astringent which retards di- 
gestion. Hence these beverages have no part in a whole- 
some dietary. 

Fruit juices in various combinations, cereal cofEees, 
Kaffir tea, sassafras tea, etc., give delightful flavors and 
form refreshing drinks. 

Milk preparations represent the more nourishing of the 
beverages. 

MINUTE BREW 

2 teaspoons ]\Iinute Brew 1 pint boiling water 

Pour the boiling water over the Minute Brew and serve 
at once with cream and sugar as desired. This recipe ap- 
plies to all soluble cereal coffees. The quantity may be 
varied to suit the taste. 

CEREAL COFFEE 
14 cup cereal coffee 1 pint water 

Tie the dry cereal coffee loosely in a cheese cloth bag or 
place in a percolater inside of a coffee pot. Boil for 20 
minutes and serve hot with cream and sugar as desired. 

10 



BEVERAGES 11 

KAFFIR TEA 

1 teaspoon KaiSr tea 1 cup water 

Place the dry tea in a small strainer and pour the boiling 
water over it. It should never be boiled. 

It is important that the water should be freshly boiled, 
as water which has been cooked for some time has a very 
insipid taste. Let stand a few seconds and pour. Serve 
with cream and sugar as desired or with a slice of lemon. 

SANITAS COCOA 

2 cups cream % cup Health Koko 
4 cups milk 2 cups water 

Mix the cocoa with % cup water. Cook until thick and 
smooth, then add the remaining liquids and let come to the 
scalding point. Milk may be substituted for the cream. 

YOGURT BUTTERMILK 

Heat one pint of skimmed milk to boiling and continue 
boiling for 5 to 10 minutes. Cover with a clean towel and 
cool to 110° to 115° F. Dissolve two to three Yogurt tablets 
in a little of the warm milk and add to the boiled milk. Set 
in a warm place (a little warmer than for bread), covered 
for 10 to 20 hours, or until it begins to coagulate. In the 
winter time it may be necessary to set in a pan of warm 
water, 110° to 115° F., and cover. Renew the water every 
hour or so. When coagulated, set in refrigerator. 

The next day sterilize another pint of skimmed milk and 
cool to 110° to 115° F. Then add % cup of the previous 
batch, first having beaten it with an egg beater to break up 
the curd. Set in a warm place 5 to 10 hours, or until 
coagulated, and put in the refrigerator. Beat just before 
serving. Repeat each day, using some of the previous day's 
batch as a starter. As the Yogurt grows older and more 



12 THE NEW COOKERY 

acid, use a little less of the starter. As it grows older it will 
also take less time to start it. Do not be discouraged if the 
first batch seems a failure. If it coagulates at all, it is al- 
right for a starter. It takes two or three days before a 
pleasant flavor is developed. 

The fireless cooker and the thermos bottle lend them- 
selves admirably to the making of yogurt. 

When the fireless cooker is used, it is important that the 
entire space in the cooking utensil should be filled. If the 
starter is not sufficient to fill the cooker pail, place it in a 
pudding dish and surround with warm water about the tem- 
perature of the milk. Let it stand 12 to 20 hours. Even 
though it should be somewhat wheyed, it is still valuable 
as a starter. The succeeding batches of milk wiU take much 
less time for the souring than the first one. 

"When using the thermos bottle, see that it is weU cleaned. 
Wash in hot soapsuds or some sal-soda dissolved in hot 
water. Fill with hot but not boiling water and let stand 
stoppered until ready to fill with the milk. Leave about 
one-half inch space between the milk and the stopper. Pre- 
pare just the same as described above, except that the milk 
should be cooled only to 120°. Place it in a thermos bottle 
and let stand 32 to 20 hours. Wide variations in the time 
must necessarily be given, as the age of the tablets affects 
the activity of the germs which bring about the souring of 
the milk. If the milk is not coagulated at the end of the 
minimum time given, recover the milk and let stand a few 
hours longer. The first batch or starter requires consider- 
able patience, but the succeeding batches are easily co- 
agulated. It is advisable to make a new starter from the 
tablets every two or three weeks. 

Kumyss, kefir and other sour milk preparations are 
made similarly, though specific directions usually come with 
the packages. Serve with one-fourth cream if desired. 



BEVERAGES 13 

ORANGE YOGURT 

For each glass of the beverage, use ^^ glass of yogurt 
buttermilk, the juice of one orange and one teaspoon of 
sugar. Stir the ingredients together and chill. If yogurt 
buttermilk is unobtainable, kumyss or clabbered milk beaten 
smooth with an egg-beater, or other sour milk preparations, 
will suffice. 

FRUIT BEVERAGE 

Juice of 3 oranges % to % cup of sugar 

Juice of 3 lemons 1 cup strawberry or other 

1 quart water fruit juice 

Extract the juice of the orange and the lemon with the 
driU; strain through a cheese cloth; add to it the sugar, 
water, and the other fruit juices ; set on ice to chill. The 
amount of sugar used must vary according to the amount of 
sugar used in the canned fruit juices. 

GOLDEN NECTAR 

11/2 cups orange juice 2/3 cup sugar 

ly^ cups pineapple juice % cup lemon juice 
1 to 2 cups water 

Strain the orange and the lemon juices, and add to the 
pineapple juice. (The canned pineapple is used in this 
recipe.) Then add the sugar and water. Stir and set on the 
ice until chilled. 

MINT JULEP 

2 cups water 6 mint sprigs 

% cup sugar 1/2 cup strawberry juice 

1 cup boiling water % cup raspberry juice 

Juice of 4 lemons 



14 THE NEW COOKERY 

Boil sugar and water 20 minutes, crush mint, and pour 
over it the one cup of boiling water. (If fresh mint is not 
obtainable, use two tablespoons of the dried spearmint.) 
Let it stand five to ten minutes, strain, and pour into the 
syrup. To this add the strawberry, raspberry and lemon 
juice. Serve cold. 

RASPBEREY NECTAR 
14 cup lemon juice 1% cups water 

4 tablespoons sugar 1 cup raspberry juice 

Make a lemonade of the lemon juice, sugar and water, 
then add the raspberry (red preferred) juice. Chill. 

FRUIT PUNCH 
2 cups strawberry juice 1 cup strong KafiSr tea 
Juice of 5 oranges 2 cups sugar 

Juice of 5 lemons 1 quart of water 

1 can grated pineapple 1 quart carbonated soda water 
Make a syrup by boiling the water and sugar together 
for 10 minutes. Prepare the tea by using 4 times the 
quantity of Kaffir tea called for in that recipe. Add the 
fruit juices, tea and the pineapple. Let stand for one-half 
hour or more, then strain first through a strainer and then 
through cheese cloth. Chill and add the carbonated water. 
ApoUinaris may be used, if more convenient. If desired a 
cup of Maraschino cherries may be added. Place a block 
of ice in the punch bowl and pour the chilled beverage over 
it. This quantity will serve 60 people. 

SPICED PUNCH 
Juice of 3 lemons 6 cloves 

Juice of 3 oranges 1 inch stick cinnamon 

1 cup sugar 3 drops essence of pepper- 

1 pint water mint. 

Preserved ginger 



BEVERAGES 15 

Prepare a syrup of the sugar, water, cloves, cinnamon 
and a piece of preserved ginger the size of a small egg. Let 
cool, then add the fruit juices and strain through three or 
four thicknesses of cheese cloth. Add the essence of pep- 
permint and let stand on ice for one hour or more. Pour 
over a block of ice in the punch bowl and garnish with mint 
leaves if desired. 



CHAPTEE III 

CEREALS 

CEREALS are seeds of certain of the grass family. They 
are very compact and are veritable storehouses of 
nourishment, having on an average about 85% nutritive 
value. 

On account of their compactness it is often advantageous 
to grind or crush them, thus also increasing the variety in 
cereal products. 

The cooking of cereals is for two purposes, viz., the 
softening of the cellulose and the changing of the starch 
from an insoluble to a soluble form. The latter is accom- 
plished in a comparatively short time, but the thorough 
softening of the cellulose ofttimes requires several hours' 
cooking, the time varying with the size of the grain or the 
fineness of the grinding. 

A double boiler is preferable to the sauce pan or kettle 
for the cooking, as it is a safeguard against burning and also 
cooks the grain without ebullition, which prevents the pas- 
tiness so often met with in mushes. 

A fireless cooker is ideal for the cooking of this class of 
foods. 

To obtain the best results, definite proportions of liquids 
and cereals must be used. 

The water •should be boiling when the cereal is intro- 
duced and should be allowed to boil five to ten minutes or 
until the grain is thickened or set. Then place in another 
vessel containing boiling water, or better still, use a double 
boiler.

"Whole or nearly whole grains should not be stirred while 
cooking. They may be lifted occasionally with the aid of a 
fork, care being taken not to crush the grains. 

Fortunately it is now possible to obtain on the market 
various breakfast cereals ready for serving, which are more 
thoroughly cooked than the housewife can possibly prepare. 

In some eases where cellulose plays an important part in 
the dietary, it is advantageous to serve the grain less thor- 
oughly cooked. 

BOILED EICB 

1 cup rice 3 quarts boiling water 

3 teaspoons salt 
Pick over the rice grains and wash thoroughly by pour- 
ing very hot water over it and rinsing in several cold waters. 
Add slowly to the boiling salted water. Boil actively for 
about 20 minutes or until the grains are tender. As soon 
as the grains are soft turn the rice into a coarse strainer or 
colander, and drain off the liquid ; then return to the kettle. 
Place in an open oven or on the back of the range uncovered 
and let it remain 5 minutes or until the kernels are dry and 
distinct. If necessary to stir the rice use a fork and lift 
the grains so as to prevent breaking the kernels. 

BOILED RICE (JAPANESE METHOD) 

1 cup rice 5 cups boiling water 

1% teaspoons salt 
Wash the rice thoroughly by pouring boiling water over 
it and rinsing in several pans of cold water. To the actively 
boiling water add the salt and the washed rice ; cover and 
set on the back of the stove where it will boil slowly for 15 
minutes, then place in the oven, still covered, another 15 
minutes. At the end of this time each grain should be soft 
and tender, yet whole and distinct.

CHAPTEE IV 

FERMENTED BREADS 

BEEAD is a cereal product which has been used almost 
from time immemorial. The first form was imdoubt- 
edly a flat cake made from pounded grain mixed with water. 

Later came the shortened cake and still later the fer- 
mented loaf. 

Bread is usually made from wheat, but rye or corn may 
be used, though they need to be mixed with wheat flour to 
give the best results. 

Bread flour- may be white, whole wheat or entire wheat 
and graham, according to the process of milling used. Gra- 
ham consists of the entire kernel and differs from the whole 
wheat in that it contains all of the bran. The whole wheat 
flour is made from wheat from which the outer part of the 
bran has been removed. White flour is made from that 
portion of the wheat kernel which lies beneath the bran. 

For most people the whole wheat and graham breads are 
more wholesome, as the bran is valuable for the bulk which 
it produces. 

Breads are of two classes, viz., the fermented and un- 
fermented. 

Fermented bread is made light by the action of the 
ferment yeast, a microscopic plant which grows and multi- 
plies very rapidly under favorable conditions. 

The conditions necessary for its growth are witMth, 
moisture and food. 

The yeast plant was originally a "wild" yeast such as 
that which accompanies almost every particle of dust and 

24 



FERMENTED BREADS 25 

which operates in the spoiling of fruits and other foods. 
Undoubtedly the first leavened bread was made from this 
variety of yeast. 

The growing of yeast for bread making has become of 
sufScient importance commercially that it is now cultivated 
in much the same way that other plants are grown for the 
market. Great care is taken not to allow the cultures to 
become contaminated. 

It is generally put upon the market in the form of dried 
cakes or of compressed cakes. 

The compressed cakes are moist and spoil quickly. They 
contain the yeast plant in an active growing condition, 
while the dried cakes contain the yeast chiefly in the form 
of spores and must be nursed back, as it were, into the 
growing state by supplying the conditions necessary for 
growth, namely the moisture, warmth and food, hence it 
is necessary when using the dried yeast cakes to soak them 
and start the bread in the form of sponge. 

Compressed yeast acts more quickly and can be made 
up into dough instead of the sponge. 

The yeast plant grows best at a temperature of about 
98° F., hence it is important that all the materials 
should be warmed. The flour may be warmed by setting in 
an open oven for a half hour or more and stirring occasion- 
ally. 

The food which yeast likes best is sugar produced from 
the starch of the flour by the action of the diastase, the 
natural ferment which digests starch in the plant world. 
The diastase begins to act when moisture and warmth are 
present. 

Brc.j,d is best made from spring wheat flour, as it con- 
tains more gluten than the winter wheat. The gluten gives 
firmness and elasticity to the loaf. 

"Wien the yeast feeds upon the sugar formed from the 



26 THE NEW COOKEET 

Starch, it breaks it down into carbon dioxide gas and alcohol. 
The carbon dioxide gas produces the lightness of the bread 
and is therefore desirable. The gluten of the flour 
envelops the bubbles of carbon dioxide, making a porous 
mass. The first kneading is for the purpose of distributing 
the yeast through the dough. The later kneadings are for 
the purpose of distributing the bubbles of carbon dioxide 
equally through the mass. The alcohol, being volatile, is 
driven off in the baking of the bread. 

The baking is chiefly for three purposes, first, the kill- 
ing of the yeast plant ; secondly, the changing of the starch 
from an insoluble to a soluble form; third, the expansion 
of the gas, carbon dioxide, thus increasing the lightness of 
the loaf. 

WHITE BREAD 

2 cups potato water or milk 2 teaspoons salt 

2 teaspoons sugar i/2 cake compressed yeast 

About 3 pints flour 14 cup warm water 

Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. To prepare 
the potato water, peel two medium sized potatoes and 
put to cook in one pint boiling water. When tender 
rub through a colander and add sufficient water to make 
two cups liquid. Cool the liquid to lukewarm, add the 
salt, sugar and the dissolved yeast. Warm the flour slightly 
in the oven and add gradually to the liquid. Stir in suf- 
ficient flour to knead well, taking care not to have a stif 
dough. Stand in a warm place and let rise about one and 
a half hours. When light, knead down and let rise again 
about an hour. Knead lightly and form into loaves. Let 
rise in the pan about three-fourths of an hour, or until light 
again. Then bake about forty-five minutes. When done 
remove from the pans and cool. This makes two loaves.

CHAPTER V 

UNFERMENTED BREADS 

UN FERMENTED BREADS are made light by the process of 
aeration, that is the incorporation of air or gas into the 
mixture by means of kneading and beating ; or by chemicals. 

The lightness of aerated breads depends upon the cold- 
ness of the materials, the dexterity with which the ingredi- 
ents are put together, the quality of the materials, the 
heat of the irons and ovens, and the filling of the irons. 
The gem irons are better for aerated products than tins. 
Since all gases expand when heated, it is necessary that 
the materials be as cold as possible. The materials should 
be put together quickly and lightly and must be beaten — 
not stirred. The ovens must be only moderately hot. The 
gem irons must be filled to the very brim, and must be 
warmed before filling. 

The chemicals used always consist of the combination 
of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and an acid. The 
acid may be cream of tartar, tartaric acid, an acid phos- 
phate, lactic acid of sour milk, hydrochloric acid, the acids 
of fruits and molasses, or alum compounds. Baking 
powders are always combinations of soda and an acid and 
are of three classes; namely, cream of tartar powder, acid 
phosphate powder, and alum powder. The alum powders 
are cheap powders and are unwholesome. The result of the 
combination of the soda with the acid is the formation of 
carbon dioxide gas and a salt, the kind of salt depending 
upon the acid used. For instance, soda and cream of tartar 



UNFERMENTED BREADS 35 

produce Rochelle salts, soda and an acid phosphate produce 
sodium neutral phosphate, while soda and hydrochloric acid 
produce sodium chloride, common table salt. 

On account of the salts produced as the result of the 
combination of chemicals in baking powders, they are not 
to be recommended to those seeking the purest and best in 
foods. 

The salt produced by the combination of soda and 
hydrochloric acid is undoubtedly the least objectionable of 
any of the salts produced, but great care must be exercised 
in the use of the hydrochloric acid, as uncombiaed it is a 
poison. On account of the degree of concentration, it is 
capable of removing the skin or mucus lining with which it 
comes in contact, hence its use must never be entrusted to 
ignorant or careless persons. It is very important that the 
measurements of both soda and hydrochloric acid shall be 
exact in order that they may be perfectly neutralized. It 
is advisable when using hydrochloric acid to have a minim 
glass, which can be purchased for a small sum at any drug- 
store. One perfectly level teaspoon of soda is neutralized 
by 80 minims of hydrochloric acid. The hydrochloric acid 
must be chemically pure (marked C. P.) and the concen- 
trated form. One teaspoon of soda and 80 minims of 
hydrochloric acid are equivalent to 4 level teaspoons of 
baking powder. 

The equivalent in baking powder is given in each recipe 
calling for soda and hydrochloric acid, as there may be oc- 
casions when the housewife will find it necessary to en- 
trust the preparation of the meals to inexperienced persons, 
but whenever possible it is recommended that the hydro- 
chloric acid and soda be used in place of baking powder. 

For most recipes % teaspoon soda and 40 minims hydro- 
chloric acid are sufficient to use with one cup of flour.

CHAPTER VII 

DAIRY PRODUCTS 

PASTEURIZED MILK 

THE following articles are necessary for the pasteuriza- 
tion of milk: Pail or deep kettle, rack such as is 
placed under meats in cooking, or a perforated pie tin, 
dairy thermometer. 

Place the rack or an inverted perforated pie tin in the 
bottom of the pail. Arrange the bottles of milk on the 
rack. Do not remove the caps from the bottles. With a 
towel wrung out of hot water cleanse the caps and mouths 
of the bottles. Make an opening in the cap of one of them 
large enough to insert a thermometer. Surround the bot- 
tles with cold water. Pill the pail sufiSciently full that the 
water will entirely surround the milk. Place the pail con- 
taining the bottles over the fire and bring quickly to a 
temperature of 145° to 150° P. as is indicated by the ther- 
mometer within the bottle of milk. As soon as this tem- 
perature is reached, remove the bottles to a table or shelf 
out of a draft, cover with a towel and let stand 10 to 20 
minutes. Then cool by placing in warm water and gradu- 
ally replacing with cold water. Set on ice and do not re- 
move the caps until the milk is needed. 

"STERILIZED" OR SWEET BUTTER 

The word sterilized is really a misnomer in this recipe, 
as the process is one of pasteurization rather than of sterili- 
zation. 

62 



DAIRY PEODUCTS 53 

Use only sweet cream. Pasteurize it the same as for pas- 
teurized milk. It may be more convenient to use a double^, 
boiler for this purpose. If so, bring the cream to a tem- 
perature of 145° to 150°, and proceed the same as for- 
pasteurization of milk. Cool the cream to about 50°. Chum 
the cream, keeping it at as nearly 50° as possible. Collect, 
the butter and work with a paddle, scalded and then chilled,, 
and press into a mold or a roll. Sweet butter is usually 
served without salt, though if preferred some salt may be- 
used. 

COTTAGE CHEESE 

Heat sour milk very slowly until the whey rises to the 
top ; pour it off, put the curd into a bag and let it drip for 
six hours without squeezing it. Put it into a bowl and 
break it fine with a wooden spoon. Season with salt and 
mix into a paste with a little cream or butter. Mold into 
balls and keep in a cold place. It is best when fresh. 

BUTTER BALLS 

Cut a pound of butter into 32 one-half ounce squares. 

Scald and soften the butter paddles with hot water. 
Scrub with brush and hot soap suds and chill in cold or ice 
water. Roll the butter between the paddles to form the 
balls. 



CHAPTEE VIII 

CREAM SOUPS 

SOUPS are served chiefly as an appetizer, though they may 
be made to convey considerable nourishment. 

As an appetizer they appeal through the senses of taste 
and smell. It is therefore important that they should be 
served hot, as hot foods give off aromas v^hich affect the 
nerves of smell. 

Soups may be divided into Cream Soups and Plain 
Soups or Soups without milk or cream. 

The cream soups are the more nourishing, though many 
of the plain soups are of a high nutritive value. 

Cream gives a very delicate flavor to cooked foods, but 
on account of its scarcity it is often not a convenient article. 

Milk and butter may be substituted for the cream in 
the proportion of 2 level tablespoons of butter and seven- 
eighths cup of milk for each cup of cream. When milk and 
butter are used as a substitute for cream in soups a little 
flour should be used for binding. 

"White Sauce is frequently used as a foundation for 
soups. The seasoning of soups is a verj' important part of 
the making of them. Seasoning may be said to be the art of 
the cook. A change in seasonings lends variety to otherwise 
plain soups. Onion, celery, bay leaf, thyme, summer savory, 
onion salt, celery salt, parsley, lemon rind and vegetable 
extracts such as Savora and Japanese Soy all add very 
much to the palatability of the soup. Usuallj'- not more than 
two or three of these seasonings may be used advantageously 
in one recipe. 



CEEAM SOUPS 55 

A crisp cereal preparation, such as a cracker, thin, 
crisp toast or croutons should be served with soup, thus 
insuring some mastication of the otherwise liquid food. 

CROUTONS 

Cut bread into- half-inch cubes. Toast in a moderate 
oven. 

BREAD STICKS 

Cut stale bread into pieces, three inches long and a half 
inch thick. Toast in a moderate oven. 

CREAM OP CELERY SOUP 

1 cup diced celery '% teaspoon salt 

1 pint water 1 pint White Sauce

one pint. To this mixture add one pint of the white sauce, 
made as follows: 

WHITE SAUCE 

4 tablespoons flour 2 cups milk 

4 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon salt 

Rub together the butter and the flour, adding gradually 
the hot, but not scalding, milk. Cook this white sauce in a

the strained tomato slowly. One-third cream instead of all 
milk may be used, and adds to the flavor. "When cream is 
used, two tablespoons of butter is all that is necessary. 

Condensed tomato may be used advantageously in this 
recipe, in which ease use 1^ cups condensed tomato and 
an equal quantity of water. It is not necessary to cook this 
before adding to white sauce except to bring it to the boil- 
ing point.

MEAT SUBSTITUTES AND 
ENTREES 

IN many homes, meat forms the chief part of the meal, 
hence housewives in planning a meatless dietary ex- 
claim, ' ' What shall we serve in place of meat ? ' ' 

The answer to this question involves a knowledge of 
the chemistry of foods. 

Lean meat is pre-eminently a protein food. It contains 
usually from 15% to 19% protein, a small amount of 
mineral matter and a large amount of water. 

Many other foods are also rich in this albuminous food 
constituent. Nuts contain on an average from 20 to 25% 
protein; legumes contain about 25% protein. Eggs, milk 
and cheese are also high in this constituent. The above 
named foods are the chief sources of protein and hence form 
the basis of so-called "meat substitutes." However, nature 
has not left man to his own resources in finding this im- 
l)ortant food principle, but has scattered it broadcast. It is 
found to "some extent in almost all natural food products. 
Science has discovered that we need much less of this con- 
stituent than was formerly supposed, so that the housewife 
need not concern herself particularly to supply sufScient 
protein, as one is likely to have more protein than is neces- 
sary rather than to have an insufficient supply. 

One meat substitute or a dish high in protein is quite 
sufficient for one meal, and if milk, eggs, cheese or nuts are 
used in the preparation of one or more dishes, a special meat 
substitute will not always be required. A lighter dish or

entree is often to be preferred for the main dish or piece

CHAPTER XII 

EGGS 

The egg is chiefly protein, though the egg yolk contaias 
considerable fat. The egg white is almost pure albumin 
diluted, of course, with water. 

The egg is valuable for its mineral salts, especially for 
the iron, phosphorus and lime. These mineral substances 
are found in the organic form in which they are more easily 
absorbed than in the inorganic form. 

The tendency of eggs toward decomposition and putre- 
faction leads many prominent physicians to withhold them 
from their patients. 

The digestibility of the egg depends upon the cooking. 
Egg white and egg yolk cook at different temperatures. 
Egg white begins to cook at 134° P. Egg yolk begins to 
cook at 122° F. The white is partly soluble in cold water. 
The best temperature for cooking is 160° to 180°. A 
higher temperature hardens the albumin. 

POACHED EGGS 

Heat the water to boiling; break the eggs, one at a 
time, into a dish; turn the heat off from under the water 
and drop the eggs in at once. Cover and let stand from 3 
to 5 minutes. 

SOFT BOILED EGGS 

First Method — ^AUow one cup of boiling water for each 
egg. Have the water boiling in a sauce pan. Place the 



112 THE NEW COOKERY 

eggs therein. Cover immediately and remove from the 
fire. Let stand on the back of the range or over the gas 
plate with the fire turned low for from 5 to 10 minutes, 
according to the degree of firmness desired. 

Second Method — Allow one cup of water to each egg. 
Put the eggs on in cold water and bring them slowly to the 
boiling point. Remove the eggs at once. 

HAED BOILED EGGS 

First Method — Allow one cup of water for each egg. 
Put the eggs to cook in cold water; allow them to come 
slowly to the boiling point, cover and turn off the heat. 
Let stand 20 to 30 minutes. 

Second Method — Pour boiling water over the eggs and 
let them stand on the back of the range 30 minutes. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS 

6 eggs 1/^ cup milk 

1 teaspoon salt 

Beat the eggs slightly, add the milk and salt ; turn into 
a double boiler and cook until thickened, stirring con- 
stantly. Serve at once. If desired, this may be served on 
toast. 

BAKED EGGS IN CREAM 

6 eggs 6 tablespoons cream 

salt 
Break the eggs into ramekin dishes or into a baking 
dish from which the eggs can be served. Sprinkle the eggs 
with salt and pour over them the cream. If a large dish is 
used, a little more cream will be needed. The cream should 
cover the eggs. Set the dish in hot water and place in a 
moderate oven. Bake slowly until a desired degree of hard- 



EGGS 113 

ness is reached. It will take about ten minutes to cook a 
medium hard egg.

EGGS IN CANAPES WITH CELERY SAUCE 

Prepare the canape by cutting slices of bread one inch 
thick. Trim the edges so as to leave oblong pieces about 
two inches by two and a half inches thick. Make a depres- 
sion in the center by removing some of the bread, leaving 
a margin of about one-third of an inch on all sides. Toast 
in a slow oven until nicely browned and crisp. Place a 
hard-boiled egg in each of the canapes. Serve with this 
any preferred sauce. The celery sauce combines nicely with 
the egg. 

SPANISH EGGS

CHAPTEE XIV 

VEGETABLES 

THE class of foods known as vegetables vary very greatly 
both in composition and as to structure. Every part 
of a plant including root, tuber, bulb, stem, leaf, seed and 
fruit is represented in this group. 

From the group is excluded the seeds of the grass family, 
or cereals, and the fruit of trees. 

Vegetables are characterized by a low nutritive value, 
though a few are comparatively high. With the exception 
of the legumes, which are sometimes given a special classi- 
fication on accoimt of their very high nutritive value and 
high protein content, potatoes are the most nutritive. 

Vegetables are also characterized by a large amount of 
cellulose and by their richness in alkaline mineral salts. 

The cellulose is desirable because it gives the necessary 
bulk. Miueral matter is necessary for maintaining the 
alkalinity of the blood and for the repair of the bony 
structures. 

It is important that vegetables should be prepared and 
cooked in such a way as to conserve all available food ma- 
terial and mineral salts. 

The portion of the vegetable next to the skin contains 
the greater quantity of mineral matter, protein and fat, 
hence all thin skinned vegetables such as new potatoes, car- 
rots and vegetable oysters should be scraped. Other vege- 
tables should be pared as thinly as possible. 

When the liquid in which vegetables are cooked is 
drained off, it carries with it much that is valuable. As far 

123 



124 THE NEW COOKEET 

as possible this should be saved and used as the foundation 
for soups or sauces. 

Vegetables should be cooked ovly until tender. Many 
vegetables develop a strong and unpleasant flavor and are 
rendered less easily digested by over cooking. This is 
especially true of cabbage, cauliflower, etc. When over- 
cooked they also take on a reddish hue. 

Strongly flavored vegetables, such as onions, cabbage, 
turnips, should be cooked uncovered. 

All vegetables should go over the fire in boiling water. 

Fresh succulent vegetables should always be put to cook 
in salted water. Old vegetables that have become somewhat 
tough should have the salt added a few minutes before the 
cooking is finished. 

Peas, beans and lentils should alwaj's be cooked in Un- 
salted water, as the salt combines with the legumin, a form 
of protein, and forms an insoluble compound, thus making 
them very difficult to cook. Soft water should be used if 
possible. 

Old vegetables may be made much more tender by im- 
mersing an hour or more in cold water. 

Asparagus, lettuce and other succulent vegetables may 
be refreshed by standing in cold water. 

TO BOIL POTATOES 

Wash and scrape the potatoes with a vegetable brush. 
Pare very thinly and place in a pan of cold water. Make 
all as nearly of the same size as possible. When all are 
pared, put them into a sauce pan of boiling water. Let them 
boil until soft when pierced with a fork. Then add a 
cup of cold water, which will check the cooking on the 
outside while the heat already in the potato will finish 



VEGETABLES 125 

the cooking of the center. This makes the potatoes 
evenly cooked througho'ut. When they again reach the 
boiling point, if the potatoes are sufficiently cooked, drain 
off the water, dust with salt, and allow the potatoes to re- 
main over a low flame for a moment or so, shaking occasion- 
ally to more perfectly dry them. 

If preferred, the salt may be added to the water before 
cooking. The seasoning is more evenly distributed when 
added at the beginning. 

TO BAKE POTATOES 

Wash and scrub the potatoes with a vegetable brush 
until perfectly clean, dry with a cloth and bake in a moder- 
ate oven until they feel soft when pressed with the fingers. 
It will take about three-quarters of an hour unless the po- 
tatoes are small. When done, take each potato in a towel in 
the hand and press gently without breaking the skin until 
the whole potato feels soft, then the skin may be ruptured 
slightly and the potatoes sent to the table at once. Never 
pierce the potato with a fork to see if it is done, as this 
allows the steam which forms within and which cooks the 
potato to escape. 

MASHED POTATOES 

1 quart rieed potatoes % cup hot. milk 

1 teaspoon salt * 1 tablespoon butter 

Boil the potatoes, drain and dry by shaking gently over 
a flame. Eice by forcing through a rieer or a colander or 
mash with a potato masher." Then add the seasonings and 
milk and beat until light. Serve with bits of butter dotted 
over the top or with white sauce.

CHAPTEE XV 

SALADS AND RELISHES 

SALADS are valuable because they introduce into the die- 
tary a bit of fresh or raw material in an attractive form. 
Some raw food such as fruits and tender vegetables should 
form a part of each day's dietary. 

A salad is usually named from the materials forming the 
body, such as Potato or Fruit Salad. By varying the com- 
binations of fruits or vegetables, and by dressings, a great 
variety may be had. 

The dressings may be varied by seasoning — celery salt, 
onion salt, sugar or by the addition of plain or whipped 
cream. 

Celery, lettuce and other vegetables should be as crisp 
as possible. To insure crispness, place in cold water a half 
hour or more before using. Drain and dry on clean towels, 
otherwise the water on the vegetable dilutes the dressing. 

FRUIT SALAD 

1 cup diced oranges 1 cup diced bananas 

1 cup diced apples 14 cup stoned cherries 

1 cup Golden Dressing 
To prepare the oranges peel, slice, and with a sharp 
knife cut each as nearly as possible into half-inch cubes. 
To prepare the apples peel and cut into half-inch cubes. 
The bananas should also be peeled, scraped and cut into 
half -inch cubes. Ripe or canned cherries may be used for 
the purpose. Mix. the fruits with the Gfolden Dressing- and 
serve in sherbet glasses or upon a lettuce leaf.

% cup lemon juice 2 to 3 tablespoons water 

1 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons sugar 

Break the eggs into the inner portion of a double boiler 
and beat until the yolk and white are well blended, but not 
until foamy. Add the lemon juice, water, salt, sugar, and 
lastly the oil or butter. Cook until the mixture begins to 
thicken, stirring all the time. Remove from the heat and 
cool at once. Should the dressing curdle, place in a pan of 



SALADS AND EELISHES 175 

cold water and beat vigorously with an egg beater. If the 
eggs are large 3 tablespoons water may be used; if small 
only 2. If a more acid dressing is desired, as for Potato

oil has been taken up. "When it begins to thicken, however, 
add the oil a little faster and dilute with a little of the 
lemon juice. The lemon juice may be added whenever it 
becomes too thick. The success of this dressing depends 
upon having the ingredients cold and upon adding the oil 
slowly enough that it may be thoroughly emulsified before 
more is added. If it curdles, take another egg yolk, beat it 
until well blended and gradually add the curdled dressing 
to it in the same manner as the oil is added to the first egg

CHAPTEE XVII 



FRUITS AND FRUIT DESSERTS 

Too much cannot be said in favor of the use of fruits. 
They should form a part of every day's dietary and if 
possible a part of every meal. 

Their nutriment consists chiefly of the natural fruit 
sugars which are ready for absorption, hence are at once 
refreshing and cooling. 

Their acids are cleansing. Their mineral salts are alka- 
line and are valuable for improving the condition of the 
blood. 

They are especially valuable as an appetizer, as they 
appeal through the three senses — sight, smeU. and taste. 

They appeal through the sense of sight because of their 
charm of color and beauty of contour; they appeal to 
the sense of smell because of the pleasant aroma ; they ap- 
peal to the sense of taste through the ethereal substances 
producing the flavors. 

When fresh fruit is not obtainable, dried fruit may be 
used advantageously. 

Having been deprived of its moisture, the method of 
preparation should be such as to gain it back, hence it 
should be soaked in cold water for several hours, or if possi- 
ble, over night. 

The time of soaking may be shortened somewhat by 
pouring boiling water over the washed fruit and letting it 
stand for a few hours. The cooking should be slow and 
gentle. 

183 



DESSERTS 

The dessert seems to satisfy a natural craving for 
something dainty and tasty with which to finish the meal. 

Fruits lend themselves particularly well to the making 
of desserts, as they are light and easily digested and appeal 
to the appetite through the senses of sight, smell and taste. 

Heavy desserts rich in sweets and fats should never ac- 
company an otherwise hearty meal. When such a dessert is 
served, a place should be reserved for it by making the 
rest of the meal correspondingly light. 

Fats inhibit the secretion of the hydrochloric acid of the 
gastric juice, hence when taken at the end of a heavy meal, 
have a tendency to retard digestion. 

Sweets stimulate the secretion of the hydrochloric acid, 
hence should be avoided by persons having a tendency to- 
ward hyperacidity. 

Cane sugar, including also beet sugar and maple sugar, 
should be used in moderation, as strong solutions of 
it have an irritating effect upon the alimentary tract. 
Many persons find it necessary to eliminate it entirely from 
the dietary. 

FEUIT MACEDOINE 

3 oranges 1 can sliced pineapple 

3 bananas Powdered sugar 

Lemon juice 

Peel the oranges deep enough into the flesh to remove all 
the white skin. Slice into half-inch slices, then cut into 
small cubes. Drain the juice from a pint can of pineapple 
and cut the slices into small triangular shaped pieces. 

Peel the banana and cut into half-inch cubes. Mix the 
fruits and put into stenuned sherbet glasses. Pour over 
each serving about a teaspoon of lemon juice, also a tea- 



DESSERTS 185 

spoon or more of powdered sugar. This makes a delight- 
ful "first course" for dinner or luncheon. 

FRUIT MACBDOINE NO. 2 

1 grape fruit 2 oranges 

Powdered sugar 

Cut the fruit in halves and remove the flesh of the fruit. 
Cut into small pieces. Serve ia stemmed sherbet glasses, 
using about four tablespoons of the mixture for a serv- 
ing. Sprinkle over the top, just before serving, some 
powdered sugar. This makes a very nice first course. 

GRAPE FRUIT COCKTAIL 

Peel a grape-fruit as you would an apple, taking off all 
the white skin. Remove the meat from each section and 
cut into small pieces. Keep on ice until thoroughly chilled. 
Place a large spoonful into a cocktail glass and pour over it 
a spoonful of chilled orange juice. Just before serving 
sprinkle over all a heaping teaspoon of powdered sugar and 
place a candied cherry on top. 

FRUIT COCKTAIL 

% pound Tokay grapes 1 cup diced apples 

1 cup diced pineapple % cup pineapple juice 

Ys cup lemon juice 

Wash the grapes, pick from the stem and remove the 
seeds. To remove the seeds, cut the grapes lengthwise into 
quarters. After removing the seeds, cut each quarter into 
half crosswise, making eight pieces of the grapes. Cut the 
pineapple into small cubes. The canned pineapple serves 
very nicely for this purpose, though fresh pineapple may be 



186 THE NEW COOKERY 

used instead. Peel the apples and cut into small cubes and 
mix immediately with the lemon juice to prevent discolora- 
tion. Add the pineapple juice and the other fruits. Let 
this stand on ice two or three hours until the flavors are 
well blended. Just before serving place the fruit in stemmed 
sherbet glasses and pack in ice in compote dishes. On 
top of the fruit pipe a rosette of whipped cream through the 
star-shaped pastry tube. The cream should be slightly 
sweetened and flavored with a little lemon or almond ex- 
tract. 

SE&MENTED ORANGES WITH WHIPPED CREAM 

Peel an orange deep enough to remove all the white por- 
tion. To do this, cut down into the flesh of the orange. 
With a sharp knife remove each section by cutting down 
between the skin which holds it. That is to say, cut the 
orange in such a way that the section can be removed, 
leaving all of the white portion. Arrange these sections in 
a serving dish, sprinkle lightly with sugar and serve with 
whipped cream. 

COCOANUT DATES 

1 dozen stoned dates 2 tablespoons shredded 

3 English walnuts cocoanut 

2 tablespoons icing 

Insert % of a walnut meat in the date. Dip in thin 
icing, and roll in shredded cocoanut.

PEACHES AND CREAJVI WITH RICE BISCUIT 

Select thoroughly ripened peaches or whole halves of 
canned fruit. Place a half peach on a toasted rice biscuit 
and serve immediately with whipped cream. 

STEWED PRUNES 

Wash 14 pound of prunes, soak them in 1 quart of cold 
water for several hours, cook slowly until tender in the 
water in which they were soaked. Add % cup sugar, 1 
tablespoon lemon juice for each 2 cups prunes. Cook 5 
miQutes. The sugar and lemon juice may be omitted if 
desired. 

BAKED BANANAS 

Remove the skins from the required number of bananas 
and scrape to remove all fuzzy portion next to the skin. 
Beat one egg and add two tablespoons of milk or water. 
Dip the bananas into the beaten egg, then into toasted bread 
crumbs. Place on an oiled pan and bake in a moderate oven 
thirty to forty minutes, or until perfectly tender. Baked 
bananas are a very wholesome dish, but raw bananas are 
sometimes troublesome unless very ripe. 

BAKED PEARS 

8 medium sized pears % cup brown sugar 

Butter 

Select firm and ripe pears, without blemish. Cut in 
halves lengthwise. Remove the core and sprinkle with 
brown sugar, using a tablespoonful for each pear. Dot each 
half with two or three small bits of butter. Bake until 
tender and nicely browned in a moderate oven. Serve with 
or without whipped cream. 



188 THE JSTEW COOKEKY 

BAKED APPLES 

6 medium sized apples 1 cup water 

1 lemon % cup sugar 

Wipe, core and pare the apples. Put apples in baking 
dish with a slice of lemon on top of each. Make a syrup of 
the sugar and water. Pour around the apples, cover and 
bake slowly until soft. Serve cold with cream, or with 1 
teaspoon jelly in the center of each apple. If desired the 
apples may also be flavored with cloves, by sticking four 
cloves in the side of each apple at an even distance apart. 

Sweet apples are always tough when cooked. The acid 
of the lemon helps to soften the cellulose of the apple. The 
skins of the apple break when baking, because the steam in 
the apple must escape, therefore it forces an opening in the 
thinnest part of the skin. A line cut around the center of 
the apple will prevent its breaking. Basting apples while 
cooking makes the skin tender. 

Steamed apples are served for baked apples in many of 
the best hotels and restaurants, as they retain their color 
and flavor much better than when baked. 



BAKED APPLES WITH MELTOSE DRESSING 

Select sweet apples of the same degree of hardness and 
remove the cores. Unless the skins are very tender, it is 
best to pare them. Water sufficient to cover the bottom of 
the baking dish should be added if the fruit is not juicy. 
Bake in a quick oven. Cover the first ten minutes, then 
remove the cover and finish baking. Serve with Meltose 
Dressing?.

CHAPTEE XVIII 

CUSTARDS and COLD DESSERTS 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR CUSTARDS 

Custards are of two kinds, namely : 

Stirred or so-called Boiled, and Set or Cup Custards, 
which are not stirred during the cooking. 

Soft or stirred custards are always cooked in a double 
boiler. 

General Directions — Heat the milk, as this shortens the 
time of cooking and lessens the liability to curdle. Beat 
the eggs slightly, sufficient only to blend the yolk and white. 
Thoroughly mix the sugar with the eggs, then pour on slowly 
the hot milk, stirring meanwhile. Strain and cook as 
directed. As soon as done remove from the heat imme- 
diately and put to cool in water or in a cold place. If a 
soft custard, stir until cooked, then cool and add the flavor- 
ing. Always serve cold. 

TESTS FOR BEING DONE 

First — Custard should bake firm, or if a soft custard 
until thick. 

Second — The froth of the milk disappears when done. 

Third — If a soft custard, it coats the sides of the sauce 
pan. 

Fourth — If a soft custard, the mixture masks the back

fectly, and pour the hot milk gradually into it. Strain 
again to remove small particles of the egg, pour into cus- 
tard cups, place in a pan of hot water and bake in a moder- 
ate oven, taking care not to cook too rapidly. "When cooked 
sufficiently, so that when pierced by a silver knife it does 
not adhere, it should be removed at once from the heat 
and allowed to cool. Serve cold.

times as much ice as salt for freezing; use four times as 
much ice as salt in packing. The ice and salt must be higher 
around the can than the mixture to be frozen is within the 
can. 

In freezing milk or cream mixtures the crank should be 
turned slowly and steadily; in freezing sherbet the crank 
should be turned rapidly and steadily; in freezing water 
ice or frozen fruit, turn the crank steadily five minutes; 
allow it to stand five minutes ; turn again five minutes and 
continue until freezing is completed. 

When mixture is frozen, remove ice and salt from

CHAPTEE XX 

PASTRY AND PIES 

BECAUSE of the large amomit of fat used in its prepara- 
tion, pastry rightly deserves the reputation it has 
gained of beiag a rich and ofttimes indigestible dessert. 

The heavy under-done lower crust is also an objection- 
able feature, but these faults may be obviated by the proper 
selection and manipulation of materials. 

"When practical, the under crust should be baked before 
filling. This applies to pies with a single crust and with 
a cooked filling such as lemon, cocoanut cream, etc. 

Pies with an under crust only and an uncooked filling 
may usually be partially cooked before filling. 

Pies made with two crusts may have the lower crust pro- 
tected by glazing it with slightly beaten egg white diluted 
with a tablespoon of water. It should then be placed in 
the oven for two or three minutes to harden the egg. This 
prevents soaking of the crust. 

Granola, a thoroughly cooked cereal, may be moistened 
with cream and pressed into shape for an under crust, where 
only a single crust is desired and a thickened filling is used. 

All materials should be as cold as possible. * 

Pastry or winter wheat flour is preferable. Butter and 
cream are undoubtedly the most wholesome fats. Nut meal, 
finely ground nuts, is also an excellent fat. 

The fat may be mixed with the flour by one of three 
methods, viz., by chopping the fat into the flour with a 
knife, by working it in with a spoon, pressing the ma- 
terials against the sides of the bowl; or by working it in 



PASTEY AND PIES 221 

with the finger tips. The first and second methods are pref- 
erable, as the heat from the hands warms the materials. 

Mix the materials by pouring the cold water or cream 
slowly into the flour and butter, mixing a small amount at a 
time. Then press these soft masses together, turn out upon 
a slightly floured board and roll lightly in one direction 
only, if possible. Do not roll back and forth or turn the 
dough over. Roll on one surface only. Manipulate the 
dough as little as possible, otherwise it will be tough. 

Fit dough closely to the pie tin and prick the bottom 
with a fork to prevent pufSng. A perforated pie tin in- 
sures a more thoroughly baked crust. 

GRANOLA CRUST 

% cup granola % cup cream 

Have ready all of the materials and the utensils before 
beginning to make this crust. Stir the cream into the 
Granola and turn immediately into the pie tin. With a 
spoon push the materials into place, shaping them to the 
pan. Do not wait for the Granola to take up the cream 
before beginning to shape it, otherwise it will be too dry 
to manipulate before it is finished. The Granola is a 
thoroughly cooked preparation, hence needs no further 
cooking. The filling may be placed into the shaped crust and 
baked 10 to 15 minutes in order to thoroughly heat all the 
materials. 

NUT MEAL PASTRY 

11/2 cups white flour % cup cream 

1 cup nut meal 1/4 teaspoon salt 

Mix the fiour, salt and nut meal together. Add. the 

cream gradually, forming the ingredients into small masses. 

Press these together. Roll out and bake the same as for 

plain pastry. 



222 THE NEW COOKEEY 

PLAIN PASTRT 

11/4 cups pastry flour % to % cup butter 

14 teaspoon salt % cup ice water 

All the materials must be as cool as possible. Sift the 
salt into the flour. Rub in the butter with a knife, spoon, or 
the tips of the fingers. Add the ice water a little at a 
time, making tiny soft masses. Then press these little 
masses together. Toss upon a floured board, and roll out 
with as little manipulation as possible. It should be rolled 
forward only, not back and forth, and on one side only. 

If two crusts are used, the lower one should be moistened 
around the edge with cold water, then a half -inch strip of 
pastry should be placed around the edge of the under crust. 
This strip should also be moistened, and the upper crust 
placed over the pie and pressed slightly around the edge. 

APPLE PIE 

Prepare Plain Pastry or Nut Meal Pastry. 

Wipe and cut tart apples into eighths; remove the 
cores and skins. Vary the amount of sugar according to the 
acidity of the apples, using 2 tablespoons or more for an 
apple. If the apples are not juicy, add from y2 tablespoon 
to 1 tablespoon water, according to the size of the apple. 
The apples may be flavored with lemon juice, cinnamon, 
or nutmeg, and should be covered with bits of butter. 

Bake until the apples are soft and the crust is brown.

CHAPTER XXI 



CAKES 

CAKES are of two kinds, viz., butter cakes and sponge 
cakes. 

The latter contain no shortening and may be made light 
by the incorporation of air through beating. Stiffly beaten 
egg white folded into the mixture is the chief means of in- 
corporating air. 

They are usually made light without the aid of chemicals. 
The lightness depends upon the expansion of the incor- 
porated air, as all gases expand one two-hundred seventy- 
third of their volume for each degree (Fahrenheit) of tem- 
perature through which it rises. 

For such cakes it is especially important that the ma- 
terials shall be cold and that they be put together as lightly 
as possible. 

The oven must be of an even temperature and some- 
what cooler than for butter cakes. 

Butter cakes are always made light by means of chemi- 
cals. The chemicals used are described in the chapter on 
Breads. 

The usual method of procedure for the mixing of butter 
cakes is as follows : Cream the butter by working it with a 
spoon until soft, add the sugar slowly, mixing thoroughly 
until of a creamy consistency, then add the beaten egg yolks 
(or whole eggs) and the hydrochloric acid. 

Sift the flour and soda together, add the milk and flour 
alternately. Lastly add the flavoring and the stiffly beaten 

230 



CAKES 231 

egg whites, unless whole egg is added to the butter mix- 
ture. 

Bake in a rather quick oven, the temperature varying 
with the size of the cake. If baked in layers, 12 to 15 
miautes will be sufScient. If baked in a loaf, thirty to sixty 
minutes or more may be required. 

SPONGE CAKE 

4 large or 5 small eggs % teaspoon salt 

1 cup sugar Grated rind of one half 

1 cup pastry flour lemon 

1 tablespoon lemon juice 

Sift the flour and the sugar separately four times. Sepa- 
rate the egg yolks from the egg whites. Place the egg whites 
on ice. Beat the egg yolks until light and lemon colored. 
Add the sugar, a little at a time, and beat until thick and 
creamy. Add the lemon juice and grated rind. Whip the 
whites until very stiff, adding the salt when half beaten. 
Fold the yolk mixture into the stiffly beaten whites, taking 
care not to stir but to fold the ingredients by a downward 
and upward movement. For this use the egg whip, first 
putting it down into the ingredients, then lifting it up 
through the materials, freeing it each time from the ma- 
terials by shaking gently. Repeat this process until the ma- 
terials are well blended, then fold in the flour in the same 
way. Care must be taken not to manipulate the materials 
too long, as this makes' the cake tough. Turn into an \m- 
buttered cake tin (preferably one with a removable bottom). 
Bake about thirty-five minutes in a moderately hot oven. 
Remove from the oven and turn upside down. Let stand an 
hour or more until the cake is thoroughly cold before cut- 
ting. The cake may then be iced if desired.

while. Add the lemon rind and the juice. Beat the egg 
white until stiff, and fold into the yolk mixture, then fold 
in the sifted flour and the chopped nuts. Turn into an un- 
buttered loaf tin and bake in a moderate oven 30 to 40 
minutes. Turn upside down in the pan until cool. If possi- 
ble, use a pan with a removable bottom. If this is not ob- 
tainable, flt a buttered paper in the bottom.

236 THE NEW COOKERY 

SMALL FANCY CAKES 

Bake the plain cake in flat tins. Cut cake into tiny ob- 
long squares, triangles, and half moons (usiag biscuit cutter 
for this), or any other desired shape. The cakes should be 
small to be dainty. After they are cut, they should be 
glazed and allowed to stand 24 hours before frosting. They 
are glazed to keep from crumbling. For the glazing, use one 
white of egg and one tablespoon powdered sugar. Beat 
the egg very slightly with a silver fork, then add sugar. 
Use a small brush for glazing. Be careful not to get crumbs 
in the egg. Glaze on all but one side, the side which has 
been the top of the cake, which has a good crust on it and 
will not crumble. This will be the bottom of the cake. 
Use a sharp knife for cuttiag cakes. Cut oil crust from the 
side of each cake before cutting in pieces. Cut all of one 
shape at one time, as the cake cuts to better advantage.

or the cake will crack in rolling. Bake quickly so as not to 
dry out or it will not roll. 

GOLD CAKE 

Yolks of 8 eggs 2^4 cups flour 

114 cups sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla 

2/3 cup butter 80 minims hydrochloric 

2/8 cup milk acid (C. P.)

2 cups flour 1 pound currants 
1/4 teaspoon mace y^ pound citron 

1 teaspoon nutmeg % pound candied lemon 

1/4 teaspoon cloves peel 

1/2 pound almonds 
Stem the raisins and wash by pouring boiling water over 
them. Drain and dry upon clean towels. Cut into quarters. 
Prepare the currants by placing in a colander and shaking 
flour over them. Rub them clean in the flour, then place in 
a pan of cold water and rinse thoroughly until the water is 
clean. Dry upon towels in a cool oven or in the sun. Cur- 
rants may be prepared several days before using if desired. 
Slice the citron very fine. If the citron is very hard it may 
be softened by steaming. Prepare the cake pan by lining 
with three thicknesses of paper cut to fit the pan. Butter 
the top layer. Measure the flour and remove enough of it to 
sprinkle over the raisins and currants. Mix the spices with

beaten egg yolks, lemon juice and grape juice. Fold in the 
stiffly beaten egg whites, the flour and the fruit except the 
citron. Place a layer of dough one-half inch thick in the 
pan. Spread evenly with the citron, then another layer of 
dough, another layer of citron, finishing with a layer of 
dough on top. This should fill the pan about two-thirds full. 
The cake does not rise much in baking. Bake for three hours 
in a moderate oven. If it browns too much on top, put a 
paper over it, or at the last put a small pan of water in the 
oven. Currant or other fruit jelly may be substituted in- 
stead of the grape juice. To keep the fruit cake, cover with 
boiled frosting. Wrap in paraffin paper and put away in a 
tin box. When the icing gets very dry, it may be moistened 
sill over with some of the liquid used in the cake. Spread 
it over the icing with a teaspoon. Let stand a little while 
and wrap in paraffin paper and put away as before. It 
may be kept a long time by doing this occasionally. A day 
before serving ornament it with the ornamental frosting.

the syrup threads when dropped from the end of a spoon 
or fork or until it forms a soft ball when dropped into cold 
water. Then pour the hot syrup gradually on the stiffly 
beaten egg whites, beating meanwhile, and continue beating 
until of the proper consistency to spread. Flavor and 
pour the frosting over the cake, using a silver knife to guide 
it over the sides of the cake. If the frosting becomes 
granular, add a few drops of boiling water.

thicken, then add the lemon juice. Continue to add sugar 
until the frosting will not run together when cut with a 
knife. Spread a thin layer of frosting on the cake, and 
when dry cover with a layer 1/4 inch thick. When firm, 
mark it for cutting. Add sugar more rapidly to the re- 
mainder of the frosting until it begins to harden on the

CHAPTER XXV 

CANNING and PRESERVING 

THE keeping of fruit from one season to another has been 
for many centuries an important duty of the house- 
wife. Within recent years, however, the housewife has 
been relieved from this duty somewhat by the canner, who 
supplies this food for the home in a very attractive way. 

Many a housewife finds it a matter of economy to "put 
up " her own fruit. By so doing, she is also able to add some 
features to meet the fancy of her own taste and that of her 
family. 

It should be remembered, however, that the greater part 
of the fruit should be put up with a small amoxmt of sugar, 
as excessive sweets are irritating to the alimentary tract 
and also tend to cloy the appetite. 

A few recipes are given in this chapter for preserves and 
jellies, but they should be used sparinglj' and only as oc- 
casional tidbits. 

TO CAN FRUIT 

There are three methods of preservLag fruit in sealed 
utensils. The success of each method is dependent upon the 
sterilization of both the fruit and the container. 

The method most commonly used is that of sterilizing the 
jars and fruit separately, which is accomplished by boiUng 
the jars and covers for ten to fifteen minutes. They should 
be put over the fire in cold water and allowed to come gradu- 
ally to the boiling point. Measuring cups, spoons. Imives 
"and funnel, if used, should, also be boiled with the jars. 

Test the jars before using by filling about half full with 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 261 

hot water, and adjust the rubber and cap. Screw on tightly 
and turn upside down for 10 minutes. If it leaks it must 
be rejected unless the cap can be adjusted. 

Sterilize the fruit by cooking in a preserving kettle, 
with or without sugar, and with or without water, until the 
fruit is tender. Small fruits usually require ten minutes 
cooking. Larger fruits a longer time in proportion to the 
size. 

When the fruit is cooked fill the sterilized jars to 
over-flowing with the fruit. A funnel is a convenient ar- 
rangement for filling the cans. Exclude the air by run- 
ning a sterilized knife around the inside of the jar. Dip 
the rubber into boiling water and adjust to the jar. New 
rubbers should be used each season. "Wipe the jar with a 
cloth wrung out of hot water. Place the sterilized cover on 
the can and screw down. Place on a board covered with a 
towel and allow to cool. The cans must not be placed in a 
draft. "When cooled it will be necessary to tighten the 
covers again before putting them away. 

The two other methods of canning fruit are known as 
the Oven method and the Water Bath method. 

OVEN METHOD 

Pack the fruit as closely as possible in clean jars. Pre- 
pare a syrup and pour over the fruit, taking care to allow 
the syrup to come in contact with the fruit before touching 
the sides of the jar. Pill to within an inch of the top of the 
jar. Place the cap on but do not screw it down. Have 
ready a shallow pan containing about an inch of hot water 
or a sheet of asbestos cut to fit the sides of the oven. Place 
the jars in the pan or on the asbestos on the lower shelf in 
the oven. The oven must be cold or cool. Increase the 
temperature of the oven gradually until the fruit begins to 
bubble, then decrease the heat but keep it at the point where 



262 THE NEW COOKEEY 

it will bubble but not violently. Too rapid cooking 
renders the fruit soft and mushy and causes a loss of the 
syrup due to overflowing. 

When done remove from the oven with a dry clean 
cloth and place on a board or on a dry cloth. Have ready 
some of the boiled syrup and fill the jar to over-flowing. 
Allow any bubbles which may form in the can to escape by 
running a sterilized knife or fork down around the sides 
of the jar. Dip a new rubber band in boiling water and 
adjust to the jar, then screw down the cap and allow the 
fruit to cool where it will not be exposed to a draft. 

Small fruits should be cooked only ten minutes from the 
time they begin to bubble. The larger fruits require from 
twenty to thirty minutes cooking. Most acid fruits may be 
put up in syrup, using equal quantities of sugar and water, 
though very acid fruits may require for palatability a syrup 
of two parts sugar to one of water. For the less acid fruits 
such as pears, blueberries, raspberries, peaches, etc., use 
one quart of sugar to two quarts of water. 

Fruits may be put up without sugar, in which case boil- 
ing water is used to fill the can instead of the syrup. 

For the small fruits allow a little more than a half 
pint of syrup to one quart of fruit. For the large fruits 
allow one pint of syrup to one quart of fruit. If less syrup 
to more fruit is desired the fruit should be cooked in the 
jars until tender, without the syrup, allowing ten minutes 
for small fruits and twenty to thirty minutes for the 
large fruits, from the time they begin to bubble. Then 
divide the contents of one jar of fruit between two other 
jars of equal size and fill with boiling syrup and seal%i the 
usual manner. 

When the Oven Method is used care must be taken to 
cook the fruit very slowly. Too hot an oven vnll break the 
jars. 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 263 

TO CAN FRUIT IN THE WATER BATH 

Prepare the fruit and syrup as for cooking in the oven. 
Fill clean jars and put the covers on loosely. Have a 
wooden rack in the bottom of a wash boiler. Put in enough 
warm water to come to about 4 inches above the rack. Place 
the filled jars in the boiler, but do not let them touch each 
other. Pack clean white cotton rags or perhaps better, 
cotton rope between the jars to prevent them from striking 
each other when the water begins to boil. 

Cover the boiler and let the fruit cook ten minutes from 
the time the water surrounding it begins to boil. 

Draw the boiler back and take off the cover. When 
the steam passes off take out one jar at a time and place 
in a pan of boiling water beside the boiler, fill up with boil- 
ing syrup and seal. Put the jars on a board and do 
not let cold air blow upon them. If screw covers are 
used, tighten them when the glass has cooled and con- 
tracted. 

TO CAN GRAPE JUICE 

Pick Concord grapes from the stem. Wash the grapes 
and heat them, stirring them all the time. When broken, 
pour into a jelly bag and allow the juice to drip from the 
grapes. Measure it and add one-quarter the amount of 
sugar. Cook the juice and sugar until they reach the boiling 
point. Pour into hot bottles, cork and seal immediately. 
Less sugar may be used. 

TO CAN APPLE JUICE 

Use the juice from selected apples, rejecting any rotten 
or wormy ones. Put them through a fruit press to extract 
the juice. Heat the juice to a temperiature of 160° to 170° 
F., then place the juice in sterilized bottles, seal and place 
in a water bath in a boiler, the water being at the tempera- 

(10) 



264 THE NEW COOKBRT 

ture of 160° to 170° P. Keep the apple juice at this 
temperature for three-fourths of an hour. Remove from 
the water and cool without a draft. Other fresh fruit juices 
may be put up in the same way. 

TO CAN PEACHES 

8 quarts peaches 3 quarts water 

1 quart sugar 

Put the sugar and water together and stir over the fire 
until the sugar is dissolved. When the syrup boils, skim it. 
Draw the kettle back where the syrup will keep hot, but 
do not boil. 

Pare the peaches, cut in halves, and remove the stones, 
unless you prefer to can the fruit whole. 

Put a layer of the prepared fruit into the preserving 
kettle and cover with some of the hot syrup. "When the 
fruit begins to boil, skim carefully. Boil gently for ten 
minutes. Then put in the jars and seal. If the fruit is not 
fully ripe, it may require a little longer time to cook. It 
should be so tender that it may be pierced easily with a 
silver fork. It is best to put only one layer of fruit in the 
preserving kettle. 

While this is cooking the fruit for the next batch may 
be prepared. 

TO CAN SLICED PEACHES 

1 quart sliced peaches 1 cup water 

1 cup sugar 
Clingstone peaches are to be preferred for this recipe. 
To prepare the peaches, dip in boiling water, remove the 
skins and slice. Prepare a syrup of the sugar and water, 
and when boiling, drop in the peaches. Cook about 20 
minutes, skimming frequently. Turn into the sterilized 
jars and proceed as for canned cherries. 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 265 

TO CAN PINEAPPLE 

Select ripe and firm pineapples of good flavor. This 
is usually determined by the aroma given off by the pine- 
apple. If it smells deliciously it is usually a good fruit. 
Pineapples which are devoid of aroma should be rejected. 
Remove the top and slice the pineapple into half-inch 
slices; then peel each slice, remove the eyes, quarter and 
cut out the core, or if preferred the pineapple may be 
cubed instead of quartered. Fill the jar with fruit, cover- 
ing it with the boiling syrup, using equal parts of sugar 
and water, and proceeding the same as for canned apricots, 
except that the pineapple must be allowed to cook from one 
to one and one-half hours, or until it becomes tender. This 
is indicated by the change in the color, the pineapple becom- 
ing more transparent. 

The pineapple may be cooked by the "Water Bath method 
if desired. 

TO CAN STRAWBERRIES 

To each pound of berries allow three-fourths of a pound 
of sugar, making a syrup of the sugar and water, in the 
proportion of one pound of sugar to one cup of water. 
Cook the syrup fifteen minutes. Fill glass jars with the 
berries and pour the hot syrup over them. Let stand 
fifteen minutes. "When the berries will have shrunk, then 
fill again with fresh berries; place the covers on, set the 
cans in shallow pans of hot water and bake slowly in the 
oven ten minutes. After they come to the boiling point care 
must be taken not to let them cook so rapidly that the 
juice overflows. They must cook only at the bubbling point. 
At the end of the ten minutes remove from the oven, put on 
the rubbers, fill the jars to overflowing with some of the 
syrup or boiled water, seal and set on a shelf on a dry 
towel out of a draft. 



266 THE NEW COOKERY 

TO CAN CHERRIES 

To each quart of pitted cherries (sour) allow one pound 
(2 cups) sugar and i/o pint of water. Make a syrup of the 
sugar and water and boil fifteen minutes. Add the cherries 
and cook ten minutes over a flame. Sterilize glass jars and 
caps by boiling fifteen to twenty minutes. Fill the jars to • 
overfiowing with the hot fruit. Wipe the jars with a cloth 
wrung out of hot water, adjust the rubber bands and 
screw down the cap. Set on a shelf or table out of a draft 
to cool. When cool, screw down the cap as tightly as 
possible. 

TO CAN CHERRIES WITH STONES 

Prepare the same as the above, using I14 quarts of 
cherries with stones to one cup of sugar and one-half pint 
of water. 

TO CAN CRABAPPLES 

1 pint of sugar 1 pint of water 

1% quarts of whole crabapples 
Select as nearly perfect crabapples as possible. Wash, 
wipe dry and remove the stems and blossom end. Prepare 
a syrup of the water and sugar and when boiling drop in 
the crabapples. Let cook slowly one-half hour or more, or 
until the crabapples are soft and tender. This quantity fills 
a quart jar. If the jar is not full with the juice add boiled 
water. 

TO CAN APRICOTS 

Select firm, ripe apricots. Place them in a wire frying 
basket and put in boiling water long enough to loosen the 
skins. Peel, halve, remove the seeds and pack in jars as 
closely as possible. Prepare a syrup, using one pint of 
sugar to one-half pint of water. Proceed as described in 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 267 

the Oven method, allowing the fruit to bubble slowly for 
twenty minutes. 

APPLE JELLY 

Wash, stem and wipe the apples. Eemove the stem and 
blossom end. Cut into quarters and put into the preserving 
kettle. Add cold water sufficient to come almost to the 
top of the apples or about 4 quarts of water to 8 quarts of 
apples. Cover and cook slowly until the apples are soft. 
Turn the apples into a jelly bag and drain, taking care not 
to squeeze the apples, as this makes the jelly cloudy. There 
should be about 3 quarts of juice to 8 quarts of apples and 
4 quarts of water. Boil 20 minutes and add three-fourths 
the quantity of heated sugar. To heat the sugar place in a 
granite dish, set in the oven, leaving the door ajar and stir. 
Boil 5 minutes, skim and turn into glasses. Place in a 
sunny window and let stand 24 hours. Cover with paraffine 
and a metal cover. Keep in a dry place. If apples are 
pared a much lighter jelly may be made. 

Apple jelly may be made at any time but winter apples 
are best and should be used when in their prime, that is, 
from autumn till December or January. When necessary 
to make apple jelly in the spring add the juice of 1 lemon 
to every pint of apple juice. 

Apple jelly may be flavored by placing a rose geranium 
leaf in the bottom of each of the glasses before pouring in 
the hot jelly. As soon as the leaf becomes slightly wilted 
remove the leaf from the hot liquid before it begins to 

jelly. 

A second extraction of juice may be made by adding 
sufficient water to cover and boiling about twenty minutes. 
Drain as above directed and boil rapidly till reduced to 
about the same consistency and strength as the first extrac- 
tion. Then add sugar and proceed the same as above 



268 THE NEW COOKERY 

directed. This makes a much better jelly than when the 
contents of the jelly bag are squeezed to make a second 
grade jelly. 

It is ofttimes possible to make a third and even a fourth 
extraction. But it is unwise to do this unless one tests these 
extractions for pectin, the jelly making principle. To do 
this, take equal quantities (about one tablespoon) of the 
cooked fruit juice and 95 per cent grain alcohol. Mix and 
cool. If pectin is present a jelly like mass is present which 
may be lifted with a spoon. It is well to test the first extrac- 
tion also in order to compare the results of the second and 
third extractions. 

QUINCE JELLY 

Wash and pare the fruit, removing the blossom end first, 
cut into quarters and remove the cores. To each gallon of 
quartered fruit add one-half gallon of water. Place over 
the fire, allowing it to come slowly to the boiling point. 
Cook slowly for about two hours, or until the fruit becomes 
soft. Turn into a jelly bag and allow the fruit to strain 
over night, without pressure. Measure the fruit juice. 
There should be one and one-half quarts of juice for each 
gallon of quartered fruit. If there is more water it should 
be cooked down to this quantity before adding the sugar. 
Add an equal quantity of sugar, stir until the sugar dis- 
solves, allowing to boil about ten minutes, and skimming 
occasionally. Pour the jelly into glasses which have been 
sterilized, and set in a window where the sun will strike it 
for twenty-four hours, then cover with parafBne, which may 
be obtained at any drug store for a few cents a pound. 
Place the paraffine in a small sauce-pan and melt over 
boiling water. Cover the jelly with the thickness of about 
a fourth of an inch of the paraffine. Cover the glass over 
with the tin lid or a waxed paper pasted over the top. 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 269 

CANDIED ORANGE PEEL 

Peel of 1 orange % cup sugar 

14, cup water in which the orange peel was cooked 
Wipe the orange and remove the peel in quarters. Re- 
move the superfluous white and cut into narrow strips. 
Cook in boiling water and cover until perfectly tender. 
Drain and make a syrup of the sugar and one-half 
cup of the water in which the peel was cooked. "When the 
sugar dissolves, add the orange rind and cook slowly until 
most of the water has evaporated. Drain the rind and roll 
the strips in coarse granulated sugar. 

PRESERVED PEACHES 

4 quarts halved peaches 2 quarts sugar 

1 quart water 

To peel the peaches, dip into boiling water and remove 
the skin. Halve and turn into a preserving kettle in which 
has been prepared a syrup of the water and sugar. Cook 
until the peaches are tender or about three-fourths of an 
hour. 

PRESERVED PEARS 

Take the fall fruit that is not perfect for canning and 
perhaps too ripe. Peel, core, cut in quarters. For each 
pound of fruit allow % pound granulated sugar and a very 
little water to dissolve the sugar. After the fruit begins 
to boil, stir constantly, as it is apt to burn. "When the fruit 
commences to darken and breaks easily it is done. Put in 
glasses or jars. "When cold, pour melted parafSne over the 
tops before sealing. 

STRAWBERRY PRESERVES 

Use equal quantities by weight, of berries and sugar. 
Make a syrup of sugar and one-half as much water. Boil 



270 THE NEW COOKERY 

moderately fifteen minutes. Add berries and cook about ten 
minutes or until berries are soft but not mushy. Seal in- 
glass jars. 

PEAE CHIPS 

8 pounds pears 1/4 pound canton ginger 

4 pounds sugar 4 lemons 

Wipe pears, remove stems, quarter and core; then cut 
in small pieces. Add sugar and ginger, and let stand over 
night. In the morning add lemon cut in small pieces, re- 
jecting the seeds, and cook slovrly 3 hours. Put in a stone 
jar. 

WATERMELON PRESERVES 

1 quart of sugar 2 quarts diced melon rind 

1 cup water 2 four-inch sticks cinnamon 

2 lemons 1 dozen cloves 

Use only the rind of the watermelon. Trim off the hard 
green part, also the red portion. Cut into cubes about three- 
fourths of an inch square. Prepare a syrup of the sugar 
and water. When boiling add the seasoning, including the 
thinly sliced lemon, next add the diced melon and let boil 
gently about two hours or until the melon is clear. 

The red portion may also be used but it should not be 
overripe and should be cooked separate from the rind. 

CRANBERRY JELLY 

1 quart cranberries 1 cup sugar 

1 to 2 cups water 

Pick over the cranberries. Remove the spoiled or im- 
perfect ones. Wash and add to the boiling water and let 
cook until they burst through their skins, then put through 
a colander. Add the sugar gradually, stirring until the' 
sugar is dissolved, then let boil without stirring eight or 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 271 

ten minutes or until it jellies. The jellying point can be 
. easily determined by dropping a little from the point of a 
spoon on a cold plate. If the drop stands up round and 
does not flatten it has been cooked sufficiently. Pour into 
molds or glasses which have been wet with cold water and 
set away to cool. The dark colored cranberries are usually 
drier and require more water than the lighter colored ones. 
They are also drier in the spring of the year. 

SPICED CRANBERRY JELLY 

1 quart cranberries 1 cup sugar 

IVs cups boiling water % teaspoon mace 

1 three-inch stick eiimamon % teaspoon^ salt 

Look the cranberries over carefully, wash and put to 
cook in one cup of boiling water with the cinnamon and 
mace. Let cook slowly until the berries burst. Rub through 
a colander, add the sugar and the remaining one-third cup 
water and the salt. Cook about six minutes or until a 
drop upon a cold platter will retain its shape. Turn into 
molds wet with cold water. When ready to serve, unmold 
upon the platter. 

ORANGE AND GRAPE FRUIT MARMALADE 

4 oranges 1 grape fruit 

2 lemons 4 pounds sugar 

4 cups water 
Wash, dry and halve the grape fruit, oranges and 
lemons ; extract the juice and the pulp by means of a lemon 
drill. Scrape out all the coarse white part of the skins; 
use the skins of all the fruit except that of one orange. 
Chop the peel in a meat chopper or slice very finely with a 
slicer. Add to the juices; measure and add an equal 
quantity of water. Let stand over night in a cool place. 



272 THE NEW COOKEBY 

In the morning boil with 4 pounds of sugar, until it jellies, 
which will take about an hour. Put in jars or glasses; 
cover with parafime and a metal cover. 

Two additional oranges may be substituted for the grape 
fruit if desired. 

STEAWBERRT JAM (English Style) 

Allow equal parts by weight of sugar and berries. Put 
a layer of berries in a preserving kettle, then a layer of 
sugar, and continue alternating berries and sugar until the 
kettle is a little more than half full. Do not try to cook 
too many at once. Let come slowly to the boiling point and 
continue boiling for 20 minutes or until they form a thick 
syrup. Put into jelly glasses or jars. Cover with paraffine. 

RED RASPBERRY JAM 

Prepare the same as for strawberry jam. One quart of 
raspberries weighs from fourteen to sixteen ounces. 

GREEN TOMATO PRESERVES 

2 quarts sliced green tomatoes 2 pints sugar 
1 lemon Water 

"Wash the tomatoes and slice unpeeled. Boil ia water 
until clear and tender, draia off water, add sugar and the 
lemon very thinly sliced. Cook slowly one hour, turn into 
a stone jar and let stand one week. Drain off the juice and 
boil it 10 minutes. Turn over the tomatoes and let stand 
one week. Drain off juice again and let come to the boiling 
point, then put in the cooked tomatoes and boil all together 
five minutes. Turn into jars and cover with paraffine. 

TO CAN TOMATOES 

Select firm, ripe tomatoes of a size to go through the 
mouth of the jar, dip into boiling water about five minutes. 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 273 

and remove the skin and place in jars. When the jars have 
been filled, add one teaspoon of salt and the boilihg 
water or tomato juice made as follows: 

Wash and slice ripe tomatoes and put over the fire and 
cook same as for stewed tomatoes. Cook about twenty 
minutes, add a teaspoon of salt to each quart of tomatoes, 
and put through a colander to remove skins and seeds. Fill 
the jars to within one inch of the top, reserving some of 
the juice or water with which, to fill the jar when finished 
cooking. Put in the oven on asbestos or in a shallow pan of 
water and bring slowly to the boiling point, then allow to 
cook very slowly for ten to fifteen minutes. Remove from 
the oven and fill the jar to overflowing, allowing the bubbles 
to escape. Adjust the rubber and screw on the top, which 
should be tightened when cold. Tomatoes canned in this 
way are delicious served whole or as a salad. 

TO CAN BEANS 

Prepare the beans the same as for the table by removing 
the strings with a paring knife, then cook in a saucepan 
until they begin to get tender. Then fill the jar as full as 
possible with the pods and add a teaspoon of salt to each 
quart. Fill the jar with boiled water, as the water in which 
the beans are cooked gives them a dirty color. Place in the 
oven and let boil slowly for one-half hour or more, or until 
the beans are perfectly tender. Seal as for beets. 

TO CAN CORN 

Select com as lately removed from the garden as possi- 
ble. The grains must be milky, and not hardened in the 
least. Cut the grains from the ear with a sharp knife, not 
too close, cutting off about half the grain, then pressing 
out the remaining juice from the hull, in this way avoiding 



274 THE NEW COOKERY 

the tough skins. Season the com with salt, a teaspoon 
to a quart, or more if desired, then pack in jars as full and 
as closely as possible. Adjust the rubber, place the cap on 
the jar and screw down loosely. Cook in a boiler as 
described above about one hour. Set aside, until the next 
day, when the corn should be reheated for another hour, 
likewise the third day. The object of the three cookings is 
to kill any bacteria which may be present, also the spores 
which are not killed by even a boiling temperature. The 
first day's cooking kills the bacteria but does not affect 
the spores which, however, germinate, or in other words 
become fulMedged bacteria in a few hours' time, due 
to the heat and moisture. Hence, after two days, the bac- 
teria which were previously spores are probably killed. The 
third day's cooking is to kill any spores which may have 
escaped germination the first day. 

TO CAN BEETS 

Select young, tender beets, wash and put to cook in a 
saucepan in boiling water and cook until tender enough to 
remove the skins, then place in jars and fill with water 
which has been colored as follows: 

Peel two or three raw beets, slice and cook in one quart 
of water about fifteen minutes, or until the water is of a 
beautiful shade of red. Do not overcook, as the water will 
become a brick color ; fill the jar with this liquid and place 
in the oven and cook ten to fifteen minutes after reaching 
the bubbling point. Seal the same as for other fruits or 
vegetables.

Kerneld Corn 

"The Corn Without Hulls" 

There is no food more appetizing, nour- 
ishing or more easily digested than the 
kernels or meat of fresh green corn. The 
contrary is true of the hulls, they are ab 
solutely indigestible. 

Our process which separates the hulls 
from the kernels or meat of the corn is 
covered by patent rights and we guarantee 
the quality and purity of 

Winorr Kerneld Corn 

to be the very best food that can be produced 
from fresh sugar corn. 

It is grown on fertile land surrounding 
our factory and it is hulled and packed the 
same day the ears are pulled from the stock 
which insures its freshness, flavor and purity.

sisting of concentrated juices of a variety of 
vegetable substances.

THE best cooking in the world 
owes its reputation primarily to 
the skilful combination of onion salt 
with other seasoning, but the many 
disadvantages of green onions are 
obvious. These may be eliminated 
by the use of NO SCO Onion Salt— a scienti- 
fic combination of the best properties of 
fresh green onions and crystal table salt. 

There is a place for NOSCO in your pantry 
right beside salt and pepper. You'll find a 
hundred uses for it. Get a shaker from your 
grocer today — but don't ask for just "onion 
salt"; say NOSCO — it makes a lot of difference.
