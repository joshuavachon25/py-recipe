PREFACE 



The enthusiasm with which the first edition of "The 
Vegetarian Cook Book" was received by the public, and 
the increasing demand for a more extended work on the 
same subject, have led to a careful revision of the book. 
This edition, like the former, is placed upon the market 
with the intention of supplying a need not met by the 
ordinary cook book. 

It is a recognized fact that the foundation for many 
of the ills of the human race is laid at the table through 
the eating of unwholesome food. Believing that preven- 
tion is better than cure, special attention has been given 
to the preparation of healthful as well as palatable dishes. 
True to this plan, and as suggested by the name of the 
book, all meat recipes have been omitted, the superiority 
of other foods being recognized. Nor are the advantages 
of a vegetarian diet any longer a matter of experiment. 
The prevalence of disease among animals is leading thou- 
sands of thinking men and women to discard flesh foods, 
and to turn to the more natural diet of nuts, grains, 
fruits, and vegetables. Special attention has been given 
in this book to the preparation of foods that will consti- 
tute appetizing and nutritious substitutes for meat dishes. 
An effort has also been made in all recipes to avoid such 
combinations of food elements as interfere with the pro- 
cesses of digestion. In fact, wholesome food, palatable, in

abundant variety, and with economy in the cost of prep- 
aration, may be said to be the message of the book. 

In revising the original work, many new recipes have 
been added, as well as several entire chapters intended to 
make the book of greater value for family use, and also 
for restaurant and sanitarium work. Accuracy in detail 
has been followed throughout in the preparation of recipes; 
and this second edition is submitted to the public with the 
firm belief that aU who give the book a fair trial will find 
a vegetarian diet both pleasing and healthful.

HYGIENE OF COOKING 



(^ 



GOOD COOKING 



=D 0= 



Good cooking is not the result of accident, a species of 
good luck, as it were. There is reason in every process; a 
law governing every chemical change. A course of med- 
ical lectures does not make a physician, nor will a collec- 
tion of choice recipes make a cook. There must be a knowl- 
edge of compounding, as well as of compiling; of baking, 
as well as of mixing; and above all, one must engage in 
the real doing. Theory alone will not suffice; but ex- 
perience, which practise only can give, is of the utmost 
importance. 

Mention will be made, under this head, of only those 
forms of cooking which enter into vegetarian cookery as 
usually understood. 

BOILING 

The term "boiling," as applied to cookery, means cook- 
ing in a boiling liquid. Many kinds of food need the ac- 
tion of water or other liquid, combined with heat, to cook 
them in the best manner; and boiling is one of the most 
common forms of cookery. When water becomes too hot 
to bear the hand in it with comfort, it has reached one hun- 
dred and fifty degrees, or the scalding point. When there 
is a gentle tremor or undulation on the surface, one hun- 

(9) 



10 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

dred and eighty degrees, or the simmering point, is reached. 
When there is quite a commotion on the surface of the 
water, and the bubbles breaking above it throw off steam 
or watery vapor, two hundred and twelve degrees, or the 
boiling point, is reached. After water reaches the boil- 
ing point, it becomes no hotter, no matter how violently 
it may boil. The excess of heat escapes in steam. This 
important fact is rarely understood by the average cook; 
and much fuel is often needlessly wasted because of the 
mistaken idea that rapidly boiling water cooks food more 
quickly. 

In all ordinary cooking, simmering is more effective 
than violent boiling. The temperature of the water may 
be slightly raised by covering the kettle. If sugar or salt, 
or anything to increase its density, is added to water, it 
takes longer for it to boil, but its boiling temperature is 
higher. This explains why boiling sirup and boiling salt 
water are hotter than boiling fresh water. Boiling effects 
partial destruction or removal of organic and mineral im- 
purities found in water; hence the importance of boiling 
the water where such impurities exist. Boiling also ex- 
pels all the air and the gases which give fresh water its 
sparkle and vitality; therefore the sooner water is used 
after it begins to boil, the more satisfactory will be the 
cooking. 

Fresh water should be used when the object is to extract 
the flavor, or soluble parts, as in soups and broths. Salt 
water should be used when it is desired to retain the flavor 
and soluble parts, as in most green vegetables. Cold water 
draws out the starch of vegetables. Boiling water bursts 



GOOD COOKING 11 

starch grains, and is absorbed by the swelling starch, and 
softens the cellulose in cereals and vegetables. 

MILK 

In cooking some kinds of food, milk is used instead of 
water. Milk being thicker than water, less of the steam 
escapes, and it becomes hot sooner than water, adheres to 
the pan, and burns easily. At its boiling temperature 
(214 degrees), the casein contained in the milk is slightly 
hardened, and its fat rendered more difficult of digestion. 
By heating milk in a double boiler, these dangers are 
avoided. The process is a form of steaming. The milk 
then reaches a temperature of only 196 degrees, and is 
called scalding milk. 

STEAMING 

The process of cooking food over boiling water is 
termed steaming. It is a very satisfactory and convenient 
method, without much loss of substance. It takes a longer 
time than some other ways of cooking, but requires less 
attention. There are two methods of cooking by steam: 
(1) In a steamer, which is a covered pan with perforated 
bottom. The steamer is placed over boiling water, and the 
steam carries the heat directly to the food. (2) By means 
of a double boiler. By this method the heat is conveyed 
from the boiling water, through the inner boiler, to the 
food. When cooking by steam, the water should boil 
steadily until the food is done. Watery vegetables are 
made drier by steaming, and flour mixtures develop a dif- 
ferent flavor from that which they have when baked. 



12 VEGETAEIAN COOK BOOK 

STEWING 

This is cooking in a small quantity of water at a low 
temperature for a long time, and is a form of boiling. 
The food loses less nutriment when stewed than when 
rapidly boiled. 

BAKING 

Cooking by means of dry heat, as in a close oven, is 
known as baking. The closely confined heat of the ovefl. 
develops flavors which are entirely different from those 
obtained by other forms of cooking. For many kinds of 
food the baking is as important as the mixing; and every 
cook should thoroughly understand how to regulate the 
oven. Nearly all flour mixtures, as bread, cakes, and 
many kinds of pudding, are more wholesome when baked 
than when cooked in any other way, 

BRAIZING 

This is a combination of stewing and baking. Meat cooked 
in a closely covered stew-pan, so that it retains its own 
flavor and the flavors of the vegetables and seasonings put 
with it, is braized. Dishes thus cooked are highly esteemed. 

BROILING 

Broiling, meaning *'to burn," is cooking directly over, 
or in front of, the clear fire, and is the hottest form of 
cooking. The intense heat, combined with the free action 
of the air, produces a fine flavor quite unlike that obtained 
in any other way. Pan broiling is broiling on a hot sur- 
face instead of over hot coals. 



SOUPS 



SOUPS 

Cream soups are seasonable at any time, using any vege- 
table in its season. Canned goods may be used when the 
fresh article is not obtainable. 

Vegetables that are too tough and old to cook in any 
other way, may be used in soups to advantage. If it can 
be afforded, a teaspoonful of whipped cream may be 
dropped into each plate, and will be found very delicious. 

By a puree is meant a soup thicker than a cream soup. 
If properly made, cream soups and purees are dainty, de- 
licious, and nourishing. 

Fruit soups are in favor during hot weather, for 
dinners and luncheons; they are very easily made, and 
are wholesome and refreshing. Any desired fruit juice 
may be thickened with corn-starch, sago, or arrowroot, and 
served with or without fruit, hot, or cold with cracked ice. 

KINDS OF SOUP 

Observing these proportions and following the foregoing 
directions, delicious cream soups are made of rice, squash, 
celery, peas, asparagus, cucumber, spinach, peanuts, po- 
tatoes, corn, lima beans, cauliflower, beets, tomatoes, salsify, 
chestnuts, mushrooms, onions, baked beans, lentils, maca- 
roni, spaghetti, watercress, string-beans, sago, tapioca, bar- 
ley, carrots, etc. All vegetables should be cooked very 
tender in boiling water. Add salt a short time before re- 
moving ; if added when the vegetables first start cooking, it 
tends to harden them, and they therefore require longer 
cooking. They may be added to the soup with or without 

(15) 



16 VEGETAEIAJSr COOK BOOK 

forcing through a colander. Rice and barley may be cooked 
in a stew-pan, but sago and tapioca should be cooked in a 
double boiler. If chestnuts are to be used, they should be 
boiled and mashed. Macaroni, spaghetti, and vermicelli 
should be broken the desired length before being put into 
the boiling water. String-beans should be minced before 
they are added to the soup. 

VEGETABLE STOCK 

Boil minced turnips, carrots, celery, and onions in 
enough water to make half the amount of stock required. 
When the vegetables are done, drain, and add an equal 
amount of rich bean broth, with a little brown flour, nut 
butter, celery salt, and just enough strained tomato to 
remove the sweet vegetable taste. This stock should be 
of the consistency of broth when done. Protose may be 
cooked with the vegetables if it can be afforded. The vege- 
tables should be put to cook in cold water, that the sub- 
stance and flavor may be well drawn out. 

FOUNDATION OF CREAM SOUPS 

Rub one heaping tablespoon of butter and two of sifted 
flour to a cream; melt in a saucepan over the fire, and 
add slowly four cups of milk, stirring constantly. "When 
it thickens, add salt, and whatever seasoning and in- 
gredients are desired to make the soup.

ing soup. 

NOODLES FOR SOUP 

Beat one egg till light, add a pinch of salt, and flour 
enough to make a stiff dough. Roll out very thin ; sprinkle 
with flour to keep from sticking. Then roll up into a 
scroll; and beginning at the end, slice into strips as 
thin as straws. After all are cut, mix them lightly to- 
gether; and to prevent their sticking together, keep them 
floured a little till you are ready to drop them into the

VEGETABLES 



VEGETABLES 

The term "vegetable," as here used, is applied to such 
plants (grains, nuts, and fruits excepted) as are culti- 
vated and used for food. They should be judiciously com- 
bined with nuts, fruits, and grains. Green vegetables 
are rich in potash salts and other minerals necessary to 
the system, and in such a form as to be easily assimilated. 

Starchy vegetables, as potatoes, supply energy and heat, 
and give necessary bulk to the food. Peas, beans, and 
lentils contain a large amount of proteid, used in building 
and repairing tissue, and are therefore used in place of 
meat. For weak stomachs they are more easily digested 
in the form of purees and soups, with the outer indigesti- 
ble covering removed. Vegetables should be fresh when 
used; for notwithstanding anything that may be said to 
the contrary, all vegetables, whether roots, leaves, or any 
other kind, begin to lose bulk and flavor as soon as re- 
moved from the ground. The kind that suffer least in this 
respect are beets, potatoes, carrots, etc. Those which are 
most easily affected are cabbage, lettuce, celery, asparagus, 
and others similar. 

Vegetables that have been touched with frost should be 
kept in a perfectly dark place for some days. The frost 
is thus drawn out slowly, and the vegetables are not so 
liable to rot.

98 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR VEGETABLES 

Fresh green vegetables should be cooked as soon as pos- 
sible after being gathered. Those containing sugar, as 
corn and peas, lose some of their sweetness by standing. 
Wash thoroughly in cold water, but unless wilted do not 
soak. It is better not to prepare fresh green vegetables 
until they are needed; but if they must be prepared some 
time before cooking, cover with cold water. 

Most vegetables should be put into fresh, rapidly boil- 
ing water, 'and if cooked in uncovered vessels, they wiU 
retain a better color, as high heat destroys their color. 
In no instance permit them to steep in the warm water, 
as this toughens them, and in some instances destroys both 
color and flavor. 

Salt hardens water, and also sets the color in vegetables. 
For peas and beans do not add salt to the water until they 
are nearly done, as they do not boil tender so readily in 
hard water. 

Corn should not be boiled in salt water, as the salt 
hardens the outer covering of the skin, and makes it tough. 
Cook the vegetables rapidly, till perfectly tender, but no 
longer. If vegetables are cooked too long, flavor, color, 
and appearance are all impaired. To judge when done, 
watch carefully, and test by piercing with a fork. The 
time required to cook a vegetable varies with its age and 
freshness ; therefore the time-tables given for cooking serve 
only as approximate guides. 

Delicate vegetables, as green peas, shelled beans, celery, 
etc, should be cooked in as little water as possible, toward 



VEGETABLES 99 

the last the water being allowed to boil away till there is 
just enough left to moisten. In this manner all the de- 
sirable soluble matter that may have been drawn out in 
cooking is saved. 

Strongly flavored vegetables, as cabbage, onions, etc., 
should be cooked in a generous quantity of water, and 
the water in which onions are cooked may be changed one 
or more times. 

The general rule for seasoning vegetables is as follows : 
To two cups small whole vegetables, or two cups of 
vegetables mashed or sliced, add a rounding teaspoonful 
of butter, and half a level teaspoonful of salt. To beans, 
peas, and squash, add one half teaspoonful of sugar. Add 
milk or the vegetable liquid when additional moisture is 
required. 

POTATOES 

Preeminent among vegetables stands the potato. 

The solid matter of potatoes consists largely of starch, 
with a small quantity of albumen and mineral salts. Po- 
tatoes also contain an acid juice, the greater portion of 
which lies near the skin. This bitter principle is set free 
by heat, passing into the water Avhen the potatoes are 
boiled, and escaping with the steam when they are baked. 

New potatoes may be compared to unripe fruit, as the 
starch grains are not fully matured. Potatoes are at their 
best in the fall, and they keep well during the Avinter. In 
the spring, when germination commences, the starch 
changes to dextrin or gum, rendering the potato more waxy 
when cooked: and the sugar then formed makes them 



100 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

sweeter. When potatoes are frozen, tlie same change takes 
place. 

In the spring, when potatoes are shriveled and gummy, 
soaking improves them, as the water absorbed dissolves the 
gam, and makes them less sticky. At other times, long 
soaking is undesirable. 

Soak about half an hour in the fall, one to three hours 
in winter and spring. Never serve potatoes, whether 
boiled or baked, in a closely covered dish, as they thus 
become sodden and clammy; but cover with a folded nap- 
kin, and allow the moisture to escape. They require about 
forty-five minutes to one hour to bake, if of a good size, 
and should be served promptly when done. 

BAKED POTATOES 

Potatoes are either baked in their jackets or peeled; 
in either case they should not be exposed to a fierce heat, 
as thereby a great deal of the vegetable is scorched and 
rendered uneatable. They should be frequently turned 
while baking, and kept from touching one another in the 
oven or dish. When pared, they should be baked in a dish, 
and oil of some kind added, to prevent their being burned. 

MASHED POTATOES 

Pare and boil or steam six or eight large potatoes. If 
boiled, drain when tender, and let set in the kettle for a 
few minutes, keeping them covered, shaking the kettle 
occasionally to prevent scorching. Mash with a wire po- 
tato masher, or if convenient, press through a colander; 



VEGETABLES 101 

add salt, a lump of butter, and sufficient hot milk to 
moisten thoroughly. Whip with the batter whip, or wooden 
spoon, until light and fluffy. Heap up on a plate, press a 
lump of butter into the top, and send to the table hot.

POTATOES A LA DELMONICO 

Cut the potatoes with a vegetable cutter into small balls 
about the size of marbles. Put them into stew-pan with 
plenty of butter and a good sprinkling of salt. Keep the 
stew-pan covered, and shake occasionally, until they are 
quite done, which will be in about an hour. 

POTATOES AU GRATIN 

Place in a greased granite pan a half-inch layer of 
mashed potatoes, sprinkle with bread crumbs, and cover 
with a layer of cottage cheese; sprinkle again with bread 
crumbs, cover with a liberal portion of thick cream, and 
bake until well browned. 

A good method of using up cold mashed potatoes, is to 
place them in a pan as directed above, cover with bread 
crumbs and cream, and bake until well set. 

STUFFED POTATOES 

Bake potatoes until done, cut in two with a sharp knife, 
remove the white portion with a spoon, add salt and cream, 
and mash well; refill, place the halves together, and wrap 
with tissue paper and twist the ends so as to hold the 
potato together tightly. The ends of the paper may be 
first cut in such a manner as to leave a fringe. Another 
way of serving them is to cut in two lengthwise, and pro- 
ceed as directed above, with this exception, that instead 
of placing the halves together, each half is meringued with 
the beaten white of egg, and set in the oven for a few min- 
utes before it is served. 



104 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

POTATO PATTIES 

Potato patties may be made from cold mashed potatoes, 
but such potatoes should be ground through a mill or 
forced through a colander before they are formed into 
shape. These may be rolled in fine bread crumbs, or egg 
and then bread crumbs, or may be browned in the oven 
without either. 

If made from fresh cooked potatoes (preferably 
steamed), mash well, adding salt and only a small por- 
tion of cream. When cool, add beaten eggs, form into 
shape, and proceed as suggested above. 

POTATO PUFFS 

Potatoes, medium size, 4. 

Eggs, 2.

an oiled granite pan, and bake in a quick oven. 

BROWNED POTATOES WITH EOAST 

Prepare filling as for Hamburg or mock turkey, and 
place in the center of a granite pan; put the peeled pota- 
toes on both sides of this, and add a thin brown gravy. 
Bake in a moderate oven, basting the potatoes occasionally 
with the gravy. Some cooks partially cook their potatoes 
before proceeding as suggested above.

Salt. 

Clean the beans, soak in cold water one hour, drain, add 
fresh water, season with salt and molasses, put into a cov- 
ered jar with plenty of water; bake overnight in a slow 
oven. When done, the beans should be whole, dry, and 
mealy, and of a rich brown color. This can only be ob- 
tained by baking the beans several hours in a slow oven. 
If desired, a little chopped protose may be added. 

PUEEE OF BEANS

if preferred, drain off the juice, salt to taste, and add 
some hot, rich milk, 

NEW LIMA BEANS 

Shell, wash, cook in hot water sufficient to cover, sea- 
son with cream and salt. 

GREEN PEAS 

Shell the peas, and cover with cold water ; skim off un- 
developed peas which rise to the top of the water, and 
drain; barely cover with boiling water, cook till tender, 
then add salt. When done, very little water should remain. 
Season to taste, with butter, and add more salt if needed. 
A little sugar is sometimes an improvement. 

When the peas are older, half a cup of milk or cream, 
with sufficient flour to thicken, is considered an improve- 
ment. A teaspoonful of finely minced parsley cooked with 
peas imparts to them a very delicious flavor. 

SPLIT PEAS 

Being free from the outside hull, split peas cook very 
quickly. Wash, and set to cook in hot water; boil care- 
fully, and watch closely that they do not stick ; season and 
serve. Split peas are usually used in soups and purees.

onions in plenty of cold water, and boil till tender. Sea- 
son with butter and salt, and serve. 

BOILED PEANUTS i^- 

Select fresh shelled peanuts. Place in a medium oven 
long enough to loosen the skin but not long enough to 
brown. Put in a cloth bag, and rub on a washboard; win- 
now out the chaff, discard all imperfect nuts, wash well in 
several warm waters, and soak overnight ; cook in the same 
water in which they are soaked, for from six to eight hours, 
or until tender. They may be partially cooked on the 
stove, and then be baked with tomato, as for beans, if 
desired. 

Passed through a fine colander and well salted, they 
make an excellent spread for bread. 

STEWED GREEN CORN 

Green corn, 3 cups. 

Butter. 

Salt. 

Milk, more or less, 1 cup. 

Sugar. 



112 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

Husk and clean as for boiling com. With a sharp knife 
cut off the top of the grain, being careful not to cut too 
close to the cob ; and with the back of the knife press out 
the remaining pulp. When cut in this way, the corn is 
much more juicy than when the grains are cut close to the 
cob. Place the milk in a granite saucepan, and when 
boiling, add the butter and corn; cook from ten to fifteen 
minutes, or until it loses its raw taste. Stir frequently, and 
season to taste, with salt and sugar. 

BOILED GREEN CORN 

Strip off the husk, remove the silk, put into fresh boil- 
ing water, and cook ten to twenty minutes. Cook only till 
done; for if boiled too long, the com hardens, and its 
flavor is impaired. If the corn is not very sweet, add one 
fourth cup of sugar to the water in which it is boiled. 
The addition of a small amount of milk or lemon juice to 
the water in which the com is boiled improves the color. 

NOVELTY BAKED CORN 

Strip the husks of the corn down so that all the silks 
can be removed. Cut out any imperfections. Wipe with 
a cloth, replace the husks, and wrap the ear with twine; 
place in a medium oven, and bake until tender. It may 
be found best to place a pan of water in the oven to add 
moisture. 

KORNLET 

Press corn that has been cut from the cob, or canned 
com, through a fine colander, or grind through a vegetable 
mill with a fine die; season and serve.

turn them into the saucepan with the tomatoes, and stir, 
allowing them time to get thoroughly done. 

CELERY 

Cut off all the roots and remove all the decayed and 
outside leaves. Wash thoroughly, being careful to remove 
all specks and blemishes. If the stalks are large, divide 
them lengthwise into two or three pieces. Place base down- 
ward in a celery glass, which should be nearly filled with 
cold water. 

STEWED CELERY 

Celery, tender stalks, 6. 
White sauce, 2 cups. 

Cut the celery into half-inch lengths, and cook in boil- 
ing salted water. When tender, drain, and pour over this

the juice of the lemon, and a little salt. Serve a spoon- 
ful of this sauce over each order of turnip. 

ASPARAGUS NO. 1 

Asparagus, like potatoes, contains a bitter alkaloid, 
which is drawn into the water in cooking, and often imparts 
to it a very unpleasant flavor. This may be remedied 
by parboiling the asparagus for four or five minutes. Then 
drain, add more hot water, and finish cooking. 

ASPARAGUS NO. 2 

Scrape the stalk ends of the asparagus, or break off 
the tough lower stalks as far as they will snap. Wash well, 
tie in bundles, and put into enough rapidly boiling salted 
water to cover. Allow a teaspoonful of salt to each quart 
of water. Cook uncovered from twenty to thirty minutes,

ONIONS 



Contrary to the opinion of many, the onion is not ob- 
jectionable as an article of food. Judiciously used, it fills 
as important a place in cooking as does salt or any other 
seasoning. 

BOILED ONIONS 

Onions. 
Cream. 
Flour. 

Select small onions, peel, wash, parboil, and cook until 
done. Salt, add cream, and thicken with flour. If there 
is too much liquid on the onions, drain off before adding 
cream. This liquid is desirable for flavoring soup.

from the root. If cut too close, the roots will bleed, and 
the color will be impaired. Wash and clean carefully with 
a brush, to remove all particles of dirt. They may be boiled 
or steamed. Young beets will cook in an hour; old beets 
require three or four hours, according to age and size. 
When done, put in cold water, rub off the skins, and they 
are ready for use. 

BEET GREENS

sauce of milk or cream, seasoned with butter, and slightly 
thickened with flour. Pour this over the chestnuts. Serve 
as a vegetable. 

STEWED GARBANZOS 

Garbanzos belong to the legume family, with peas, beans, 
etc. They have a meaty flavor distinct to themselves, and 
make a desirable change in one's dietary. They are no 
more expensive than lentils, and can be obtained by any 
purveyor. They do not cook soft when done, like other 
legumes, but should mash when pressed between the thumb 
and finger. Soak over night, wash well, and start to cook 
in cold water, cooking slowly until tender, which will re- 
quire four or five hours. 

ARTICHOKES 

There are two varieties, one known as the globe, flower,

SALADS 



SALADS 

All green vegetables that are dressed with acid, salt, 
and oil, and eaten raw, are included in the list of salads; 
and they should always be served crisp and cool. Wash 
salad greens carefully, allowing them to stand in cold or 
iced water until crisp. Drain, and wipe dry with a soft 
towel, taking care not to bruise the leaves. Keep in a cool 
place till serving time. If they are not thoroughly dried, 
the water will collect in the bottom of the dish, and ruin 
any dressing used. 

Remove a thick paring from cucumbers, and a thick 
slice from each end; cut into thin slices, or into half -inch 
dice, and keep in cold water to which salt and lemon juice 
have been added, until ready to serve; then drain thor- 
oughly. 

To make celery crisp, let it stand in cold water. 

Pare tomatoes, and keep in a cold place. Sprinkle with 
chopped ice at serving time. The list of vegetables suitable 
for salads is so long that the question of kind is wholly a 
matter of choice. Asparagus, peas, string-beans, beets, 
cauliflower, etc., are all well utilized in salads. Freshly 
cooked vegetables or left-overs may be used, but all cooked 
vegetables must be cold and perfectly tender. By deftly 
combining these left-overs with the favorite dressing, there 
is material for a delicious and economical salad, to which 
the somewhat aristocratic name ' ' macedoine salad ' ' may be 
given. This salad may consist of a few or many kinds of 
vegetables, any combination pleasing alike to the eye and 

(143)

the palate being permissible, and if care is taken in the 
arrangement, it may be made a very attractive dish. 

To the dressing of salads one must give utmost care 
and attention, as upon its excellence the success of the 
dishes principally depends. While rules for dressings are 
innumerable, there are, after all, only a few really good 
ones. The French dressing and the mayonnaise are most 
generally known, the former being the simplest and most 
commonly used of all dressings. And it is quite the fa- 
vorite for lettuce, cresses, chicory, and other vegetable 
salads. As the salad wilts if allowed to stand in the dress- 
ing, it should not be added till just at the moment of serv- 
ing, and it is for this reason that it is frequently made at 
the table. 

One of the most difficult things to prepare is a per- 
fect mayonnaise; but once the knack is acquired, failure 
afterwards is rare. One essential point is to have all the 
materials cold. Chill in the refrigerator both the bowl and 
oil an hour or more before using. In warm weather it is ad- 
visable during the mixing to set the bowl in a larger one of 
cracked ice. This dressing, if covered closely, will keep 
several days or longer in the ice-box. Keep in a cold place 
till wanted, as it liquefies as soon as mixed with other in- 
gredients. To tone down the taste of the oil, and thus make 
more delicate salads, one may add to the dressing, just 
before it is used, a little cream beaten stiff and dry. This 
dressing is used vsdth nut and fruit salads, and may be 
used with potatoes, tomatoes, celery, and other vegetables. 

Most cooked vegetables intended for salads are moistened 
with a French dressing and allowed to stand an hour or 



SALADS 145 

more, or until well seasoned, in a cold place. To this 
process the term "marinate" is applied. Just before serv- 
ing, pour off all the marinade that is not absorbed, and 
add the mayonnaise to the vegetables. A mistake frequently 
made in preparing salad dressing is that of using too 
much acid. The acid flavor should not predominate.

SALAD DRESSINGS 



11 



MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

Egg yolk, 1. 

Cooking or olive oil. 

Lemon juice. 

Salt. 

Sugar, 1 tablespoon. 

Into a saucer break the yolk of a fresh egg; put with 
it a large pinch of salt, and with a fork stir the yolk till 
it begins to stiffen. Gradually add to the yolk, a drop at 
a time, cooking oil or olive oil, stirring well after each 
drop is added. Continue this process till the mixture be- 
comes too stiff to stir, then thin it with lemon juice, and 
add more salt. The salt helps to stiffen it. Thicken again 
with oil in the same manner as before, and thin again 
with lemon juice. Continue this till the desired amount 
is made. When stiff enough to cut with a knife, add one 
tablespoonful of sugar. 

This will keep a number of days, if set on ice. Success 
in making it, depends upon the care with which the oil 
is added. At first add a drop at a time; and toward the 
last, two or three drops, and perhaps half a teaspoonful, 
at a time. 

To keep from curdling, put the lemon juice and oil 
on ice for fifteen minutes before using. Should the may- 
onnaise curdle while making, or afterward^ begin again 
with a clean, dry bowl and batter whip, using another egg 
yolk, and the curdled mayonnaise as though it were oil.

Cold water, 8 tablespoons. 



Rub the butter or the oil, and the salt, into the flour; 
add the water, stirring carefully with a fork. Lay a suf- 
ficient portion of this on a floured board, and roll out. 
Work the pie paste as little as possible. For tender pie 
crust, use spring wheat flour, as the gluten in the winter 
wheat flour makes it tough. This recipe will make paste 
enough for two double-crust pies. 

PIE SHELLS 

Cover a pie tin with good pie paste, press this into 
shape by setting another tin of the same size into it, trim, 
and bake between the tins. This keeps the crust in shape. 
Use the shells for lemon, prune, and other pies that do 
not require baking after the filling has been added.

Thin batters are about the consistency of thin cream. 
Thick batters are like cream. Still thicker batters, which 
may be poured in a continuous stream, are called pour 
batters. Any batter is a pour batter until it is made so 
stiff that it breaks or drops in the pouring, when it is called 
a drop batter. It will remain a batter until too stiff to be 
beaten, when it becomes a dough. 

Doughs, like batters, are of varying degrees of thick- 
ness, ranging from those just stiff enough to be handled, 
to those which may be rolled thin as paper. Generally 
speaking, one full measure of flour to one scant measure 
of liquid makes a pour batter; two full measures of flour 
make a drop batter ; and three full measures make a dough ; 
although, for various reasons, these proportions are subject 
to many modifications. 

If the ingredients in batters were simply mixed and 
cooked slowly, the resulting substances would be hard and 
compact, unfit for human digestion. Hence, to obviate 
this, and to make them light and porous, we must resort 
to other processes. This is accomplished by means of the 
expansion of incorporated air, by the generation of gas 
within the mixture, or by a combination of both methods, 
supplemented by quick cooking before the gas has a chance 
to escape. 

Air at seventy degrees expands to about three times its 
volume when exposed to the temperature of a hot oven. 
Consequently, as a mixture heats in cooking, incorporated 

(237) 



238 VEGETABIAN COOK BOOK 

air expands, giving the desired lightness. Air is incor- 
porated or enclosed in batters by beating the mixture thor- 
oughly, as in making whole wheat gems; by adding eggs 
to the beaten mixture, as in popovers; and by the gas ob- 
tained by the union of an acid with an alkaline carbonate, 
as in the use of baking powders. In batters made light by 
the admixture of air, one must exercise care in beating, in 
order actually to incorporate and retain the air. When eggs 
are added to the mixture, the glutinous consistency of the 
albumin they contain assists in retaining the entangled air. 

LIGHT BREAD 

In bread making it is necessary to have first-class yeast, 
the best of flour, pure water, a good oven, and any amount 
of good common sense. 

Variations must be made according to locality, climate, 
altitude, kind of flour, and other conditions. Experience 
is a necessary teacher in this as in any other work. The 
quickest and surest way to become proficient in the art 
is to place yourself under the tutorage of a good bread 
maker. 

To insure the best results, the temperature should be 
the same throughout the process; and this can only be 
determined by the use of a thermometer. Ten or fifteen 
cents will buy one which will record 120 degrees, which is 
sufficiently high, as the material should not be allowed to 
reach more than 85 degrees ordinarily. Some localities 
may require a higher temperature. 

An earthen bowl is better than tin or granite, as it is 
not so subject to change of temperature.

Of the many methods of making good bread, the fol- 
lowing has been chosen by the writer: â 

Break in pieces one half of a dry yeast cake. Some 
use a whole cake ; but it will be noticed that the bread has 
a strong yeasty taste, and the sponge is likely to fall be- 
fore morning, thus deteriorating in both taste and nutri- 
tion. Soak the yeast a few minutes in a little tepid water. 
Into a warmed mixing bowl put a pint of water at 95 
degrees. Add the soaked yeast cake, and beat in warm 
(not hot) flour until the batter is so stiff that it does not 
flatten readily. Beat until smooth, cover, and keep it warm 
overnight. A box of suitable size, bound about with sev- 
eral thicknesses of newspaper, and partly filled with hay, 
straw, or excelsior, makes a warm closet for bread sponge. 
By means of a kettle of hot water, warm bricks, or flat- 
irons, in the bottom of the box, the batter may be kept 
warm until morning, if no room in the house is warm 
enough. Cover the box with enough paper to insure suc- 
cess. The sponge will be light and warm in the morning, 
but should not be removed until the room in which the 
kneading is to be done is warmed to at least 90 degrees. 

Add a pint or more of warm water to the sponge, salt 
to taste, and add a spoonful of sugar. Have the flour, 
kneading board, and your hands warm. Proceed to make 
a stiff dough, and knead it until smooth, so it will clear 
the board without any sprinkling of flour. Return it to 
the warm bowl, and keep it warm until it has risen to 
twice its original size. If an extra fermentation is de- 
sired, it may be lightly worked down, and turned over 
to rise again. The more fermentation, the more the nutri- 



240 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

tion is lessened. When ready for tlie tins, have them oiled 
and warm. Very slightly knead and symmetrically form 
portions of dough half the size you wish your finished 
loaves to be, and continue to keep them warm. 

If the oven is hot enough to brown a spoonful of flour 
on its floor, it is ready for the bread. The bread should 
be carefully watched, and turned if necessary to insure 
even baking. Should any part of the loaf have a pale 
surface at the end of an hour, it may be removed from 
the tin, and be placed in contact with a hot part of the 
oven to brown. 

When thoroughly baked, lay the loaves on a cloth in 
front of an open window, and slightly oil the top of each. 
The bread should not be packed away until thoroughly 
cold. It should not be eaten hot, especially if butter is 
used with it. The hot bread forms into doughy pellets, 
which are difficult of digestion ; and the addition of butter, 
which melts and covers the food portions, hinders the ac- 
tion of the digestive juices upon them. 

ZWIEBACK 

Cut bread that is at least thirty-six hours old into 
rather thick slices, and dry it in a cooling oven, the sun- 
shine, or mnd. Put it in an oven of sufficient heat to 
brown it through and through. It is best eaten dry, but 
may be moistened and covered with fruit sauce, milk gravy, 
or any dressing desired. 

CROUTONS 
Cut sliced stale bread into cubes. Dry and toast to a 
nice brown, to use in soups.

by using a pie marker (a scalloped wooden or metal wheel 
about the size of a twenty-five cent piece attached to a 
short wooden handle ; a cut of this is represented elsewhere 
in this book) . If rolls are desired, have the dough of 
double thickness, cut in strips, about half an inch square, 
and roll with the hands until round. These are usually 
served about three inches long. Beaten biscuits are made 
by rolling the dough out in a large roll about one and one

CEREALS

Grains may be considered perfect food in themselves, 
as they contain all the food elements in nearly right pro- 
portions. Rice and corn are exceptions to this, the starch 
in the first and the protein in the latter being in excess. 

In cooking grains in the form of porridges, they should 
be introduced into rapidly boiling water, beating with a 
batter whip so that the grains may be thoroughly mixed 
with the water and be free from lumps. In cooking coarse 
grains, as cracked wheat, pearl barley, hominy, etc., keep 
them boiling, stirring occasionally until the grain does not 
sink to the bottom, but hangs suspended in the water. 
If the inner part of a double boiler has been used, it may 
then be set into the outer boiler, which should be placed 
on the range where the water will boil rapidly. Replenish 
the water in the outside boiler from time to time with 
boiling water. 

The cooking should be continuous; and the length of 
time varies according to the varying proportion of gluten 
in the grain. The larger the percentage of starch, the 
shorter the time required in cooking. Grains combine 
nicely with fruits, and may be cooked or served with either 
fruit or fruit juices. 

OATMEAL 

Oatmeal, 1 cup. 
Water, 1 quart. 

Put the water into a double boiler, place on the range,

Put the water into the inner part of a double boiler, 
place on the range, and when boiling add salt and farina. 
Let it boil for two or three minutes, stirring all the time. 
Then place in a double boiler, and cook one hour. If milk 
is used, it should first be simmered or scalded in a double 
boiler, and then placed on the range, and the milk will 
boil almost immediately. In this way the mihi will not be 
so liable to scorch as if it was put on the range at first. 
Thus rule will apply to all grains cooked with milk.

one level teaspoonful of concentrated lye. If wood ashes 
are at hand, lye made from them will answer the pur- 
pose as well; or baking soda may be used. More of the 
soda than of the lye is required. Cook vigorously until, if 
pressed between the thumb and finger, the hull will readily 
slip off. Immediately remove the corn into cold water. 
Eub thoroughly in several waters, that all the hulls may 
be removed. Let it stand overnight in plenty of water. 
Pour off most of the water, and rub the corn in the hands 
to remove any hulls remaining. Rinse, and put into cold 
water. Cook rather slowly until tender. Salt to taste. Do 
not serve until the salt has penetrated each kernel. If 
during the cooking more water is needed, let it be added 
hot. Corn thus prepared is excellent eaten plain, but the 
taste of the consumer will decide what he will use for sauce. 

FRUIT DRESSING FOR CEREALS 

Such fruit juices as strawberry, blackberry, grape, blue- 
berry, or pineapple, may be heated to boiling, thickened 
with corn-starch, and served as a substitute for milk or 
cream on flakes or other cereals. 



TOASTS 



TOASTS 

Toasts are uniformly and properly regarded as a break- 
fast dish, and when properly prepared are wholesome, 
nutritious, and appetizing, and far more conducive to 
health than the fried mushes and griddle cakes with which 
so many are prone to appease their appetites. 

Zwieback should be used as the foundation of all toasts, 
although ordinary toasted bread can be used. In toasting 
bread, do not expose it to such fierce heat that the bread 
will be burned or singed. Singed bread is not toasted 
bread. It should be toasted as far through as possible, 
and should be crisp and brittle, not hard. In using zwie- 
back for toast, it may be moistened with hot milk if for 
cream, gravy, or egg toast ; or with hot salted water if for 
fruit. In either case, the toast should be dipped quickly 
in and out again, so as not to absorb too much liquid and 
become mushy. Under this head a few kinds of toast 
will be given, inexpensive and otherwise. While it is not 
an exhaustive list, it will include sufficient to suggest others 
equally good.

Prepare eggs as for shirring, pour about one tablespoon- 
ful of rich cream over them, salt, set in oven, and bake 
as desired. Serve at once. 



DAIRY DISHES 



WHIPPED CREAM 

That satisfactory results may be obtained, the cream 
to be whipped must be quite rich. Cool the cream to a tem- 
perature of 64 degrees or less, and beat with a batter whip 
or a dover egg beater until of the desired consistency. This 
may be flavored and sweetened as desired. Care should be 
exercised not to beat too long, or the butter may begin to 
separate. 

COTTAGE CHEESE 

Cheese made from sour milk contains much of the 
protein element, and is preferable to the cheese of com- 
merce. 

Many fail signally in making this article, and lose its 
nutritive value, and also spoil its palatableness. The milk 
should be allowed to thicken, and then be skimmed be- 
fore any attempt is made to heat it. Heat it slowly â 
preferably in hot water or in a moderate oven. The milk 
should not be stirred while cooking, but an advantage is 
gained by passing a knife through it so as to cut it in 
squares, just as the curd begins to form. This helps to 
give uniformity of texture, which is more pleasing than 
to have some parts hard and others soft. 

A short method is to pour boiling water into the lob- 
bered milk, with gentle stirring, until the curd forms and 
separates from the watery whey. Rapid cooking is likely 
to cause lumps and a stringiness not altogether agreeable. 
As soon as well curded, it should be poured into a strong 

(287) 



288 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

but loose cloth to drain without pressure. Overnight is 
none too long for it to remain quiescent. It may then have 
added to it a portion of salt, and as much sweet cream or 
milk or sour cream as will be required to make it of the 
desired consistency. Should there be any lack of smooth- 
ness, the cheese will be vastly improved Ity passing through 
a colander or an ordinary meat mill. 

Various seasonings may be added, as minced onion, 
parsley, or other herbs, and the whole formed into balls or 
other shapes. 

Served with a garnish of lettuce or other green, it gives 
a pleasing variety. Used in place of common cheese with 
macaroni, it is more wholesome than that article. 

Sweet milk may be readily curded by the addition of 
lemon juice. One cup stirred into a gallon of warm milk 
will usually gather all the curd. If the whey is white and 
milky, add a little more juice, and more curd will form, 

BUTTEEMILK CHEESE 

Buttermilk, 2 quarts. 
Lemon juice, 2 tablespoons. 

Add the lemon juice to the buttermilk, and set in 
warm water, or in a warm place, until it wheys off. Then 
drain in a cloth, and proceed as for other cheese. 

STERILIZED MILK 

Milk is so liable to be infected with disease germs, that 
it is much the safest plan to sterilize it before using. Heat 



DAIRY DISHES 289 

the water in an outer boiler to the boiling point, and set 
into it the inner boiler containing the milk, and cook over 
a hot fire until the albumen rises to the top in the form of 
little bubbles. Remove, pour into shallow pans, and cool 
rapidly. If, when cool, it is poured from one dish to an- 
other for a few minutes, it will be likely to have less of 
the cooked taste. Some authorities favor cooking the milk 
for thirty minutes. Be that as it may, the milk should be 
heated, and cooled quickly. 

CONDENSED MILK 

Condensed milk is prepared by a vacuum process by 
which much of the water is removed by evaporation. Such 
milk is usually wholesome, as it has to be sterilized in the 
process of canning. It can be prepared for use by add- 
ing from one to five parts water. For some purposes it has 
an advantage over ordinary milk.

these, invert the others on the lettuce leaves, press together, 
and cut comerwise. 

NUT AND EGG SANDWICHES 

Prepare eggs as for scrambled eggs. While cooking, 
add an equal quantity of minced protose or nuttolene; 
cook until set and remove ; add celery salt and lemon juice 
to taste, spread on thin sliced bread, press slices together, 
and cut comerwise in four pieces. Arrange tastily on a 
smaU plate on which has been laid a crisp lettuce leaf.

NUT PREPARATIONS 



NUT BUTTER 

Nut butter can be easily made in the home; but nearly 
all the prepared nut foods on sale require expensive ma- 
chinery and a steam plant to produce, hence can not be 
made in the home. 

Peanuts and almonds are the nuts most suitable for 
making nut butter. The other varieties are difficult to 
blanch, and do not make good butter. The best variety 
of peanuts for making nut butter is the Spanish shelled. 
They are easily blanched. Removing the skins from the 
nuts after they are shelled is called blanching. Peanuts 
can not be blanched unless they have been thoroughly 
heated. 

To properly cook peanuts is the essential thing to pro- 
duce a healthful, palatable nut butter. This can be ac- 
complished if care is exercised. There are three ways of 
cooking them; namely, baking or roasting, boiling, and 
steaming. The baking process is the easiest way, but care 
should be used not to scorch them. Scorched or burned 
peanuts are unfit to use in any form. 

PROCESS NO. 1 'â¢ 

Put a layer of peanuts about one half inch deep into 
a dripping pan, and place on a perforated shelf in a mod- 
erate oven. Allow them to bake slowly for about one hour, 
until they are a light brown or straw-color. Shake the 
pan or stir the peanuts every few minutes. When the ker- 
nels begin to crack and pop, they brown very quickly, and 

should be watched closely. 

(309) 



310 VEGETAEIAN COOK BOOK 

A satisfactory way to cook the nuts is to fill a tight 
covered dish about two thirds full, place in the oven, and 
shake occasionally. Cooked this way, they are not so liable 
to bum, and they retain their flavor better. When they 
have cooked sufficiently, spread them out at once. When 
they have become quite cool, blanch. This can be done by 
rubbing them in the hands, or what is better, in a coarse 
bag, or with a piece of cloth with the ends folded together, 
forming a bag. Another good device is a screen made of 
coarse wire. Rub them until the skins are loose. The chaff 
can be removed by using a fan, or by pouring from one 
dish to another where the wind is blowing. Look the 
nuts over carefully, removing defective ones and foreign 
substances. 

Grrind when fresh cooked, as they do not make good 
butter when left a day or two after they are cooked. 

PROCESS NO. 2 

Thoroughly heat the nuts in an oven, but do not let 
them brown. Allow them to cool, then blanch as described 
in process No. 1. Boil them from three to four hours, until 
they are tender. Drain, spread out on tins, and thoroughly 
dry them; then grind them through a mill. 

ALMOND BUTTER 

Almond butter is more difficult to make than peanut 
butter, on account of the difficulty in removing the skins. 
Dry heat does not loosen the skins of almonds as it does 
those of peanuts. To blanch almonds, soak them in boiling 



NUT PREPAEATIONS 311 

water from two to five minutes ; then the skins become loose 
and can be pinched off by pressing on the nut with thumb 
and finger; the skins will crack and the kernel pop out. 
Dry the kernels in a slow oven until they become thor- 
oughly dry and crisp, taking care not to burn them. Then 
grind them through a loosely adjusted miU. Place on tins 
or on a cloth stretched over the stove, until perfectly dry. 
Then grind in the nut butter mill tightly adjusted. 

This makes excellent butter if the almonds are first-class. 

PEANUT MEAL Â£^ 

Heat the peanuts sufficiently to remove the skins, but 
do not brown them. Blanch and look over. Boil or steam 
them until tender, taking care to have them quite dry when 
done. Drain off aU the water possible, and put them 
through a colander. Put on tins suspended over the stove, 
or in a slow oven with the door open, taking care not to 
brown them. When perfectly dry and hard, grind through 
the mill loosely adjusted. If it is not fine enough, spread 
out to dry, and afterward pass through the mill again more 
tightly adjusted. If the mill is too tight it will grind the 
nuts into butter. A good plan is to rub the meal through a 
flour sieve. 

NUT BUTTER FOR THE TABLE l^ 

Put into a bowl one half the amount of butter required 
for the meal, and dilute with an equal quantity of water, 
adding a little at a time, beating it thoroughly with a fork 
until it is smooth and light. Enough water should be used 



312 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

to make the proper consistency to spread nicely. A wire 
whip or potato masher is an excellent utensil for mixing. 
A little salt can be added if desired. Nut butter does not 
keep long when mixed with water. 

NUT CREAM 

Peanut butter, 2 tablespoons. 
Hot water, 1 pint. 
Salt, 1 teaspoon. 

Add enough water to the peanut butter to emulsify it 
as for table use; then dilute with the remainder of water, 
add salt, set on the stove, and bring to a boil; it is then 
ready to serve. 

CRYSTALLIZED PEANUTS 

Peanuts, 1 quart. 
Egg, 1. 
Sugar. 

Use peanuts that have been baked enough that they 
will not have a raw taste. Beat the egg slightly with two 
tablespoonfuls of water, stir well into the peanuts, and let 
stand about ten minutes in a colander; then roll in sugar, 
and turn again into the colander, which should have rather 
large perforations ; rub out all loose sugar, spread on a pan, 
and dry slowly in a warm place. 



NUT PREPARATIONS 313 

SALTED PEANUTS 

Prepare as for crystallized peanuts, using salt instead 
of sugar. Care should be exercised not to leave too much 
salt on the nuts. If not for immediate use, place in fruit- 
jars, and screw on the covers tight. 

TO BLANCH ALMONDS 

Remove the hard shells, and let the kernels stand in 
boiling water until the red skins will slip off when pressed 
between the fingers. 



FRUITS AND THEIR PREPARATION 



FEUITS AND THEIR PREPARATION 

It is not the intent of this chapter to exhaust the con- 
sideration of the topic of fruit and its service, but to 
drop a few suggestions that wiU assist the reader in varying 
the bill of fare. Fruits are usually served first at break- 
fast and lunch, and last at dinner. 

Apples: plain; sauce; baked, and served with cream 
and sirup. 

Apricots: plain; sauce; sliced, and served with cream. 

Bananas : plain ; sliced or baked, and served with cream. 

Blackberries: plain; with cream; stewed. 

Cherries: plain; stewed. 

Currants, black, red, or white: plain; stewed; as salad. 
(See strawberry salad.) 

Date^: plain; puree; sometimes stewed. 

Figs : plain ; sliced with cream ; stewed ; steamed. 

Grapes: plain; stewed; salad. 

Grapefruit; cut in halves, and sprinkled with sugar; 
served plain. 

Green gage plums: plain; stewed. 

Huckleberries: plain; with cream. 

Melons â cantaloup, musk, and Spanish melons, and 
casabas: cut in suitable pieces, seeds removed, filled with 
broken ice, and served. 

Nectarines: plain; sliced with cream; stewed. 

Oranges: plain; sliced with powdered sugar. 

Peaches: plain; stewed; sliced with cream.

(317) 



318 VEGETABIAN COOK BOOK 

Plums: plain; stewed. 

Pineapples: fresh sliced; diced; grated; canned. 

Pomegranates : cut in sections and served plain ; seeded, 
crushed, and prepared as nectar. 

Prunes: fresh; stewed. 

Quinces: usually served as preserves, or stewed with 
apples. 

Easpberries, red and black : plain ; with cream ; stewed*. 

Strawberries: plain; with cream; salad; stewed. 

APPLE SAUCE 

Much time, effort, and material may be saved by the 
following method of stewing apples: Wash the fruit, re- 
move decayed portions, cut in quarters, and remove only 
a small portion of stem and blossom ends. No harm comes 
from cooking sound cores and skins. Pass through a fine 
colander, and sweeten. If they were cooked in very little 
water, the portion remaining in the colander may be moist- 
ened, and thus a trifle more of pulp be saved. 

MAPLE APPLES 

Apples, 4. 

Maple sirup, 1 cup. 

Water, 1 cup. 

Peel and slice the apples; mix the maple sirup and the 
water, and pour over the apples; bake under cover in a 
medium oven, until tender and dark brown. 



FRUITS AND THEIR PREPARATION 319 

GEAPE APPLES 

Pare and core tart apples, and boil in grape juice until 
tender; remove the apples, and boil down the juice to a 
thick sirup, and pour over the apples before serving. 

BAKED APPLE SAUCE 

Pare, quarter, and core tart apples ; place in a bean pot 
or deep granite kettle, add sugar and water, and cover; 
set on the stove until it comes to a boil, then place in a 
medium oven, and bake slowly until tender and dark red. 

BAKED APPLES 

Wash and core apples which are free from defects, 
place in a granite pan, sprinkle with sugar, add water, 
cover with an inverted pan, and bake in a slow oven. The 
amount of sugar and water and the length of time required 
for baking will depend upon the variety of apples. 

BAKED PEARS 

Select firm tart pears, cut in halves, remove cores, lay 
in granite pan, sprinkle with sugar, and cover with water; 
invert another pan over them, and bake in a slow oven 
until tender. Pears too green to be eaten raw, bake up 
very nicely this way. 

BAKED QUINCES 
Pare, core, and proceed as for baked apples. 



320 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

BAKED PEACHES 

Pare, remove stones, and bake as directed for pears. 
Cover with meringue, and brown. Serve with cream. 

STEWED PRUNES 

Cover prunes with warm water, and allow to soak for 
several hours. Rinse well in several waters, either lifting 
out of the water with the hands, or pouring prunes and 
water into a colander. If the water is simply poured off 
of the prunes, the dirt is liable to settle to the bottom 
of the kettle, and thus remain with the prunes. When 
well washed, place the prunes in a kettle with an abun- 
dance of cold water, and simmer slowly for several hours. 
If cooked too fast they will break up. 

PRUNE MARMALADE 

Remove the juice from stewed prunes, force out the 
seeds, and then press through a colander with medium- 
sized perforations. 

PRUNE WHIP 

Prune marmalade, 2 cups. 

Eggs, 2. 

Vanilla. 

Add the yolks to prune marmalade, flavor and sweeten 
to taste, stir well, then fold in the beaten whites of the 
eggs, reserving enough of the latter with which to gar- 
nish. Serve in glasses. 



FBUITS AND THEIR PREPAEATION 321 

MUSKMELONS WITH SLICED PEACHES 

Divide smaU muskmelons, remove seeds, and chill by 
filling with cracked ice; when cool, fill with sliced peaches, 
sprinkle with powdered sugar, and serve. 

SLICED ORANGES 

Peel, and remove all the white pulp, also the pulpy core ; 
reject a thin slice from each end; the remainder, when 
sliced thin, cover with sugar, and set in a cool place for 
an hour or so. Just before serving, sprinkle with pow- 
dered sugar. A little grape juice may be added if desired. 

PINEAPPLE 

Slice off the outside, dig out the eyes, and remove the 
core; slice thin, or break off with a fork; add sugar, and 
allow to stand at least two hours. 

BAKED BANANAS 

Peel, slice lengthwise, place in granite pan, sprinkle 
with sugar, add a little hot water, and bake in a medium 
hot oven until tender. They may also be baked in their 
skins. 

STEWED BERRIES 

Some make a mistake in stewing berries too long. Wash 
thoroughly, add sugar to taste, and but little water. 
21 



332 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

STEWED EAISINS 

Soak the raisins in warm water for a time, to remove 
all dirt that may have adhered to them; pour into a col- 
ander, and rinse well; cover with cold water, and stew 
until tender. The juice may be slightly thickened with 
corn-starch. 

TO KEEP LEMONS 

If it is desired to keep lemons fresh, place them in a 
vessel of cold water in a cool place, changing the water 
frequently. 

DRIED FRUIT 

When drying fruit, select that which is sound and not 
overripe; peel, slice, and lay on racks in the sun or in a 
very slow oven. Turn occasionally. When thoroughly 
dried, bring to as high a temperature as can be done with- 
out injury, and pack in tight boxes or paper sacks. If 
soaked several hours, it wiU require but little cooking. 

Many dried fruits are in the market, but they are 
open to at least two objections. They are usually sul- 
phured to improve their appearance, and are exposed to 
dust and flies, if to nothing worse. AU dried fruit should 
be washed before cooking. 

Fruit dried at home should be carefully protected from 
dust and flies, and be thoroughly heated before storing, 
that the eggs of insects may be destroyed. 



FRUITS AND FRUIT CANNING 



FRUITS AND FRUIT CANNING 

Many if not all ripened fruits may be eaten uncooked ; 
but since they do not continue through, the year, we wish 
to preserve them for use at such times as they can not be 
obtained fresh. This may be done in various ways. Fifty 
years ago there was the choice of only two common methods, 
â drying and making ' ' pound-f or-pound preserves. ' ' This 
latter method requires so much sugar that it should be 
ignored. 

In these times of improved methods, canning fruit 
is the most popular method of preservation; and it seems 
scarcely possible there can ever be any better, unless it 
were that access might be had to the fresh article the 
year round. 

Different methods are employed, according to kind of 
fruit, locality, etc. Frequently much more sugar is used 
than is necessary. Boiling the sugar with acid fruit, 
changes it to invert sugar, thus lessening its sweetening 
properties two and one half times. 

To overcome this and still have the fruit sweet enough 
to be palatable, make a sirup in one kettle, and cook the 
fruit in another, and combine them just as they are to be 
put into the jar; or, better still, put in some fruit, and 
then the required amount of sirup. A few movements of 
the jar will mix them. 

Always choose the best quality of fruit. It should be 
washed sufficiently to remove all sand and dust. Slow cook- 
ing is much better than rapid boiling, though the fruit 
should reach the boiling point just before canning. The 

(325) 



326 VEOETAKIAN COOK BOOK 

boiling temperature at sea level is 212 degrees ; bÂ¥it in high 
altitudes it is several degrees lower, hence greater care 
must be taken to keep the fruit from spoiling. One good 
way to do this is to re-cook it once or laore on as many- 
successive days. 

The amount of sugar necessary for palatabiUty does not 
materially aid in the keeping of the fruit. Sugar may be 
added a few hours before the meal, and thus can room is 
economized. Moreover, sugar is usually less expensive in 
winter than in the height of fruit canning season. Large 
jars are more economical than small ones, though a few of 
the latter are needed for the re-canning of what may be 
left from the large ones. 

A fruit funnel is a convenience, and granite is to be 
preferred. It is well to set the jar on a wet, folded cloth 
in a broad but shallow pan. In case of a "spill" or a 
cracking jar, there need be little waste. Be cautious about 
fragments of glass. 

There are steam cookers in which the jars filled with the 
fresh fruit may be placed, and the fruit gradually heated 
to a thoroughly cooked condition, when the sirup may be 
added, and any deficiency be supplied from another jar. 
A common wash-boiler, covered wash-tub, or two dish pans, 
one as a cover, answer the same purpose, if cloth be laid 
in the bottom and between the jars to prevent breakage. 
Not much water is required in these vessels, but it must 
be gradually heated after the jars of fruit have been 
placed in it. 

Be careful not to expose the hot jars to drafts. It is 
well to replenish the jars while in the water, seal them, 



FBUITS AND FRUIT CANNING 327 

and let them stand until partially cooled. The steaming 
or bailing may be done with the rubbers in place, and the 
covers lightly laid on. If old ones are used, they should 
be critically examined to determine whether they are well 
fitted to the work. Any uneven cover edges may be pressed 
to the jar by using something like a knife-handle, running 
it round and round. 

To make sure there is no leak, invert the jar of fruit 
on a clean dry shelf to remain until cold. If any juice 
exudes, attention should be given it. Should there be a 
foamy appearance, be sure there is a crack or other break 
somewhere; but do not be anxious about hubbies, for they 
are only "air," and that is sterilized if the work has been 
properly done. 

TOMATO CANNING 

Probably no fruit is more abundantly canned than 
tomatoes, and they supply a place not held by all fruits. 
Peeled, sliced, and canned in the ordinary way, they are 
excellent, and every household should have an abundant 
supply. Tomatoes in glass are much superior to those in 
tin cans. If tins must be used, the fruit should be removed 
from the can immediately on opening. Acids and tin do 
not make a favorable combination. 

Try this method of preserving tomatoes: Thoroughly 
wash, and remove all imperfections. Cut in two or three 
pieces, and cook, adding little or no water, until just soft 
enough to pass through a colander or sieve, which will re- 
tain the skins and seeds. Return to the stove, boil for a 



328 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

few minutes, and put in jars. Large bottles with well-fitted 
corks answer an excellent purpose if closed with sealing- 
wax. Occasionally the cork is drawn into a bottle. To 
prevent this, loop a strong but rather fine twine under the 
cork, and fasten over it and around the neck of the bottle. 
Have the cork cut off even with the bottle, and pour on 
the melted wax. The string will be an assistance in re- 
moving the cork when the bottle is to be opened. If one 
does not object to the use of tin, sirup cans may be filled, 
and closed much the same as a bottle. Tomatoes canned in 
this way are always ready for soups, gravies, toasts, and 
to be used in many other ways. 



ICES AND SHERBETS 



ICES AND SHERBETS 

These are mostly made from water, sugar, and the 
juice of fruit. When fresh fruit is not obtainable, juices 
or pulp wh^ch have been canned may be substituted. Fruit 
jellies may be dissolved in hot water and then frozen. As 
fruits vary in sweetness, it is advisable to test the mix- 
tures before all the sugar or sirup called for in the recipe 
is added. A mixture which seems sweet enough before 
freezing, will be found to be lacking in sweetness after 
freezing. If a rich fruit ice or sherbet is desired, the 
pure fruit juice may be used without the addition of any 
water. Sherbets are practically the same as fruit ice, only 
that gelatine, egg whites, or corn-starch have been added to 
give more body to the preparation. The texture of fruit 
ice is often more or less granular and icy, more like wet 
snow. The sherbets are often so much like the cream 
ices, that it is difficult to believe that there is no cream in 
them. 

If the sugar is boiled with the water, a finer grained ice 
will be the result. 

There are many freezers on the market, but the one 
having a double motion is the most satisfactory. To pre- 
pare the ice, one should provide one 's self with a grain sack 
and something with which to break the ice. A 2 x 4 about 
two and one half feet long, with one end prepared for a 
handle, is desirable. Or an iron pipe of the same length 
may be used. Place the ice in a sack, and hold the open 
end in the left hand while you strike with the bludg- 
eon in the right, occasionally turning the sack. When 

(331) 



332 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

sufficiently beaten, empty the ice into a tight box, pick out 
the pieces too large for use, and return them to the sack. 
Better results mil be obtained from finely crushed ice; if 
the pieces are too large, they are liable to dent the freezer. 

Mix the coarse salt with the crushed ice in the box, 
and from it pack the freezer. Authorities differ in refer- 
ence to the proportion of ice and salt to be used. Some 
say one of salt to three of ice ; others one of the former to 
seven of the latter. Too much salt causes the finished 
product to be coarse-grained. It is possible to freeze a 
batch of fruit ice with ice and salt left from a former 
freezing, although it may have become somewhat liquefied ; 
so do not think it necessary to refill the freezer because 
some water is seen with the ice and salt. Freezers which 
are properly constructed have an outlet for water just 
below the level of the top of the freezing can, and not in 
the bottom as some might suppose. 

Fine salt will accomplish the desired end, but the 
coarse is cheaper and better. 

Care should be exercised to keep the bearings, gear, 
and sockets of the freezer frequently oiled. 

If only a small batch of ice is to be frozen, the freezer 
need not be packed its full depth. 

When the mixture is frozen, remove the paddle, scrape 
off the ice, cover the can, place a cork in the hole in the 
cover, and throw over all the wet sack in which the ice 
was broken. Keep in a cool place until time to serve. 

To produce a soft, creamy texture, the freezer should be 
turned continually and rapidly until the mixture is hard. 

Always turn the freezer to the right. If turned to the 



lOES AND SHEEBETS 3&3 

left, the contents which lie nearest the outside of the 
freezing can will freeze and adhere to the side of the can, 
and thias prevent turning it in the right direction. Keep 
the paddle moving. If allowed to stand, the freezer will 
set, and make further turning impossible. Under such 
conditions, in an effort to turn the paddle, some part of 
the freezer may break. If for any reason the freezer does 
become set, do not bring too much strain to bear on it, but 
take out the can, and set in a kettle of hot water for ten 
seconds, and then repack, and it will be found that it 
will turn readily. 

These frozen preparations will be found much improved 
if allowed to stand for an hour or so after freezing. This 
is called curing. 

Fruit ice or sherbet can be made if no other utensils 
than a quart cup and a dover egg beater are at hand. Pack 
the cup in ice and salt as usual, and scrape from the sides 
and bottom occasionally with a knife. 

Fruit ices served with lady fingers, kisses, or cookies, 
directions for the preparation of which are given in axi- 
other chapter, make a very delicate and toothsome dessert 
for luncheon, and are very easily and quickly prepared 
when once the art is mastered. 

SIRUP FOR FRUIT ICE AND SHERBET 

Sugar, 1 cup. 
"Water, 4 cups. 

Place the water and sugar in a stew-pan, and bring to 
a boil ; as the scum rises, skim it off. When the fluid boils,

remove, strain, and cool. This sirup can be prepared m 
quantity and be bottled up ready for use. This same 
sirup may be served as a sauce for baked apples and other 
desserts. 

LEMiON SHERBET 

Lemons, 5. 
Sugar, 1 cup. 
Egg whites, 3. 
"Water, 1 quart. 

Add the sugar to the water, and bring to a boil. Re- 
move from the stove, cool, and add the lemon juice, and 
part of the grated rinds if desired. Pour into the freezer, 
and freeze until well coagulated. Then add the beaten 
egg whites, and finish freezing. 

STRAWBERRY SHERBET

Pick over and wash the berries, cover with the sugar, 
and mash well; allow to stand for an hour or so, then 
pass through a coarse colander; add the water, and force 
through a coarse cloth or fine wire strainer, until nothing 
but the seeds are left; put in the lemon juice and sirup, 
and freeze until well coagulated; then add the beaten egg 
whites.

Walnut meal, y^ cup. 

Prepare as for apple snow, adding the beaten ^^g 
whites and wabiut meal after the mixture has begun to 
freeze. The nut meal may be obtained by sifting chopped 
or ground nuts through a flour sieve.

PRUNE SHERBET 

Prune juice, 1 cup. 
Prune pulp, 1 cup. 
Sirup, 1 pint. 
Egg whites, 2. 

Stew prunes as for prune sauce; strain off the juice, 
and force the prunes through a fine colander. Whisk up 
the egg whites slightly with a little of the liquid, mix all 
together, and freeze. 

It will be noticed that a different procedure is adopted 
for adding the egg whites than in some of the other 
sherbets. This is not necessary, but is done to suggest an- 
other of the various methods that may be followed. 

PEACH SHERBET 

Peaches, stewed, 1 pint. 
Sirup, 1 pint. 
Egg whites, 2, 

Press stewed peaches, dried or fresh, through a fine 
sieve; add the sirup, and freeze, adding the beaten egg 
whites as for other sherbets. 

MRS. FULTON'S FAVORITE 

Lemon juice, % cup. 
Pineapple juice, 1 cup. 
Sirup, 1 quart. 
Eggs, 3. 

Beat the whole eggs, and pour over them the other in- 
gredients. Freeze as for other sherbets. 



ICES AND SHERBETS 337 

CORN-STARCH SHERBET 

Fruit juice, 1 quart. 
Corn-starch, 1 tablespoon. 

Heat tlie juice to boiling, and thicken with the corn- 
starch, braided with a little cold water. When cool, pour 
into the freezer, and freeze. 

This recipe is given to show how corn-starch may be 
substituted for egg whites or gelatine in giving body to 
the mixture. 

SHERBET IN CANTALOUPS 

Wash and divide small cantaloups, remove all seeds 
and imperfections, fill with crushed ice, and set aside to 
chill. When cold, remove the crushed ice, and fill with 
fruit sherbet, the flavor of which should combine well with 
that of the cantaloup. 

BANANA SHERBET 

Bananas, 5. 
Sirup, 3 cups. 

Egg whites, 2, 

Peel the bananas, and press through a fine colander: 
add the sirup, and beat well. Pour into freezer ; and when 
partially frozen, add the egg whites, and finish freezing. 

HONEY SHERBET 

Strained honey, 1 cup. 
Water, 1 quart. 
Egg whites, 2. 
2a 



338 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

Beat the water into the honey, and freeze, adding the 
egg whites in the usual way. 

COFFEE SHERBET 

Cereal coffee, 2 cups. 
Sirup, 2 cups. 
Eggs, 3. 

Prepare cereal coffee as for ordinary service, and cool. 
Add the sirup and the beaten yolks. Partially freeze, and 
add the beaten whites. This may be an agreeable change, 
although not a favorite. 

WATERMELON SHERBET 

Cut melon in small slices, remove the red portion, and 
proceed as for watermelon ice, adding five egg whites. 
Place the rinds in a pan, and cover well vsdth cracked ice. 
When ready to serve, fill the slices with the sherbet, build- 
ing up the original shape of the cut melon. Press into 
this a few of the seeds in such a manner as to make it ap- 
pear like the original. A piece of greased tin will be found 
serviceable in accomplishing this. Double the tin in the 
center; place on one half of it a portion of the sherbet; 
press the rind well up against it; then, while holding the 
rind with one hand, press down on the other half of the 
tin, forcing out all the sherbet that will not fit into the 
hollow of the rind. 



ICES AND SHERBETS 339 

FRUIT SHERBET WITH MAPLE SIRUP AND 
WALNUTS 

Some sherbets may be improved by serving them with 
a dressing of maple sirup and chopped walnuts. 

MALTED NUT AND MELTOSE SHERBET 

Malted nuts, 1 cup. 
Meltose, 1 cup. 
Water, 1 quart. 
Egg whites, 2. 

Add enough of the water to the malted nuts to make 
a smooth paste, dilute the meltose with a small portion of 
water, mix all together, and freeze. Add the beaten whites 
when nearly frozen. 

This recipe is given for the benefit of those who find it 
inconvenient to use cane sugar. For others it will be im- 
proved by the addition of some sirup. 

WATERMELON ICE 

Watermelon juice, 1 quart. 
Sugar, 1 cup. 

Cut the watermelon in such a manner that the edges 
of the halves are escalloped. Remove the pulp, fill the 
shells with cracked ice, and set aside to cool. Crush the 
pulp so that the juice will separate from it. Strain off 
such juice as separates from the pulp. Place the remain- 
der of the pulp in a strong cloth, and squeeze it until as 
much juice as possible has been removed. Add the sugar 



340 VEGETAEIAN COOK BOOK 

to the juice, and freeze. When ready to serve, remove the 
cracked ice from one of the shells, and fill with the frozen 
preparation. If a surprise is desired, invert the second 
half over the first. These can be securely fastened to- 
gether by toothpicks. 

OEANGE ICE 



Orange juice, 2 cups. 
Sirup, 2 cups. 
Lemon juice, y^ cup. 



Freeze as for other ice, and serve in the half shells which 
have been preserved when removing the juice. Another 
nice method is to remove a round plug from the stem end 
large enough to allow a teaspoon to be inserted; with the 
spoon remove the pulp and juice, strain and freeze the 
juice, and fill the shells with it. Return the plug, and 
serve with other fruit as a surprise. Bananas, muskmelons, 
or other fruit can be filled in the same manner. The shells 
should be chilled before filling, and should be left in a 
cool place until time to serve. 

GRAPEFRUIT ICE 

Grapefruit juice, 1 cup. 
Sirup, 2 cups. 

Divide the grapefruit; remove the center portion and 
seeds ; squeeze out the juice, and strain ; add the sirup, and 
freeze. 



ICES AND SHERBETS 341 

GRAPE ICE 

Much depends upon the strength and flavor of the 
juice used. If it is very rich, it may be thinned down with 
sirup or water ; if not too strong, it may be frozen as it is. 

PINEAPPLE ICE 

Pineapple pulp and juice, ^ can. 
Lemons, 4. 
Sirup, 1 quart. 

If sliced pineapple is used, it should be minced very 
fine. The juice alone is more desirable. Mix all the in- 
gredients, and freeze in the usual manner. 

APRICOT ICE 

Lemon ice mixture, 2 quarts. 
Apricots, stewed, 1 pint. 

Press the apricots through a colander, add to the other 
mixture, and proceed in the usual manner. 

GREEN GAGE ICE 

Lemon ice mixture, 2 quarts. 
Green gages, 1 quart. 

Proceed as for apricot ice. Add a small amount of 
spinach coloring. 



342 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

APPLE SNOW 

Apple sauce, strained, 2 cups. 

Sugar, % cup. 

"Water, 1 pint. 

Lemon juice, 2 tablespoons. 

Mix the sugar and water, bring to a boil, and add this 
sirup and the lemon juice to the apples; cool and freeze 
in the usual manner. More or less sugar may be required 
for various apples. 

MAPLE ICE 

Maple sirup, 2 cups. 
Water, 3 cups. 

Mix and freeze in the usual manner. Add two beaten 
egg whites if it is desired to make maple sherbet. 

PEANUT ICE 

Peanut butter, 2 tablespoons. 

Hot water, 1 quart. 

Salt. 

Sirup, 3 cups. 

Add salt and a small portion of the hot water to the 
nut butter, and mix as for table use. When smooth, dilute 
with the remainder of the hot water. Set on the stove, and 
bring to a boil ; then strain and cool, add sirup, and freeze. 

The addition of egg whites is of course an improvement. 
This recipe is not a general favorite, but may be enjoyed 
by some who are fond of nut butter. 



ICES AND SHERBETS 343 

YOGURT ICE 

Under some circumstances it may be found desirable to 
serve yogurt in the form of ice. This will not be found 
difficult. Simply pour the yogurt in the freezing can, and 
proceed as for other preparations. 



BEVERAGES 



CARAMEL CEREAL 

A Substitute for Coffee 

For each cup of the beverage required, use two table- 
spoonfuls of the cereal, and boil for ten to twenty minutes. 
Then remove to the side of the range, and let steep a few 
minutes. The strength and aroma of cereal coffee are de- 
veloped by long steeping. 

CHOCOLATE 

Sanitas 

To each two ounces of Sanitas chocolate, allow one 
cup of cold water. Let it stand until the chocolate is 
soft, place over the fire, and after it boils, cook one minute. 
Work it briskly with an egg beater, then serve at once, 
adding at the last moment a tablespoonful of whipped 
cream to each cup. 

It is considered an improvement by some to use two 
thirds chocolate and one third malted nuts. 

Other chocolate is not recommended, as it contains an 
injurious alkaloid, which in the Sanitas brand is removed 
by a special process. 

EGG-NOG 

Milk, 1/2 glass. 
Sugar, 1 teaspoon. 

(347) 



348 VEGETAEIAN COOK BOOK 

Beat tlie white of tlie egg stiff, and add the sugar; 
beat again, and add the yolk; beat, and add the milk. 
Flavor to suit, mix well, and garnish with a half spoonful 
of the white. 

Either part or all of the milk may be left out, and 
fruit juice added in its place. 

FEUIT NECTAE 

For every eight parts of other fruit juice used, add one 
part of lemon juice, and sweeten to taste. A combination 
of fruit juices, as grape, cherry, and raspberry, makes a 
very fine nectar. Always include the lemon juice. The 
nectar should be served ice cold. 

STRAWBERRY NECTAR 

Ripe strawberries, crushed, 4 cups. 
"Water, 4 cups. 
Lemon, sliced very thin, 1. 
Sugar, 2 cups. 

Mix all together, and let stand in a glass or earthen jar 
for two hours; strain through a coarse cloth, and keep on 
ice until served. 

MINT JULEP 

Sugar, 1 cup. 
Mint sprigs, 6. 
Strawberry juice, % cup. 
Juice of 4 lemons. 
Water, 1 pint. 
Boiling water, 1 cup. 
Raspberry juice, % cup. 
Ice. 



BEVERAGES 349 

Boil the sugar and water twenty minutes; crush the 
mint, and pour over it one cup of boiling water. Let 
stand five or ten minutes, strain, and pour into the sirup. 
To this add strawberry, raspberry, and lemon juices. Serve 
ice-cold. 

LEMONADE NO. 1 

The best lemonade is made from lemon sirup. Into the 
juice of twelve lemons grate the rind of six. Be careful 
to exclude all seeds and the inner white skin, as they 
impart a bitter taste. Let stand overnight. Make thick 
sirup of white sugar, and when cold strain the lemon juice 
into it. A tablespoonful added to a glass of water makes 
a perfect lemonade. 

LEMONADE NO. 2 

Three lemons to a pint of water make a strong lem- 
onade. Sweeten to taste. 



PINEAPPLE LEMONADE 

Lemon juice, % cup. 
Pineapple juice, 1 cup. 
Sugar, 1 cup. 
Water, 1 quart. 

Bring the water and sugar to a boil, cool, and add 
lemon and pineapple juices. Serve ice-cold. 



350 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

OEANGEADE 

Sugar, 1 cup. 
Water, 2 cups. 
Orange juice, 2 cups. 
Cracked ice. 

Boil sugar and water together ten minutes to make a 
sirup; then add the orange juice, and let it cool. When 
cold, pour into goblets half filled with cracked ice. 

APOLLINARIS LEMONADE 

Juice of 6 lemons. 

Rind of 4 lemons, sliced very thin. 

Sugar, 2 cups. 

Apollinaris water, ice-cold, ^ bottle. 

Cracked ice. 

Mix the lemon juice, rind of the lemons, and sugar to- 
gether, and add Apollinaris water. Serve in goblets of 
cracked ice.

KITCHEN UTENSILS 

No room in the house or institution requires more care 
and painstaking effort in the matter of furnishing than 
the kitchen. A large part of the health and comfort of 
the family depends upon the success of this all-important 
room. A good kitchen outfit is one of the foundation stones 
of good housekeeping. 

NUMBER OF UTENSILS 

The number of cooking utensils will depend upon the 
size of the household and the extent of work to be done. 
It is unwise to lay in a large stock of all possible articles 
just because there is a possibility of their being used at 
some time. The better plan is to secure the necessary 
articles first, and buy the others as occasion may demand. 
This list should not be curtailed for the sake of display in 
some other department where less depends upon the re- 
sult. It is true economy to buy the best quality and of 
simple construction. 

Kitchen utensils should have a smooth surface, and 
be light enough to handle well and heavy enough to be 
durable. They should be of such material as will not dis- 
color the food prepared in them and will stand a high 
temperature without becoming rough. They should be suf- 
ficiently solid not to absorb flavors and thus transmit them 
to other preparations.

360 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

GRANITE WARE 

For the preparation of cooked salad dressings, cooking 
of fruits, desserts, etc., granite ware is very desirable; 
but in many eases aluminum is displacing granite. 

TINWARE 

Such, articles as steamers, cake tins, strainers, graters, 
flour scoops, molds for puddings, measures, milk pans, dip- 
pers, cutters, flour sieves, funnels, salt shakers, dust-pans, 
bread tins, strainers, and boxes for meal and bread, cake, 
etc., can as well be of tin as of more expensive material. 

A tin pie pan will render good service for a time, but 
is liable to discolor the crust. For this and other reasons 
we recommend granite pie pans. It is not profitable to 
purchase tin teakettles if durability is considered. 

STEEL WARE 

Iron utensils can not be used for cooking fruit or any 
food substance containing acids, as they discolor the food 
and destroy the flavor. Steel ware, tho more expensive at 
first, is cheaper in the long run, both in the home and in 
institutions, because of its practicability and lasting quali- 
ties. Where the granite is chipped it is irreparable, while 
a steel kettle can be retrimmed at a small expense. 

WOOD 

The following articles made of wood are serviceable: 
molding boards, rolling-pins, spoons, potato mashers, chop- 



UTENSILS 361 

ping-bowls, paddles for stirring, rollers for towels, pie 
markers. 

GENERAL UTENSILS NEEDED IN THE KITCHEN 

Stone jars for butter, jugs, knives, egg beater, steel 
dish-cloth, tablespoons, iron spoons, lemon squeezer, cake 
turner, skimmer, can opener, ice pick, batter whips, steels, 
apple corer, scales, scrubbing and vegetable brushes, brooms, 
roll bakers, iron gem pans, toasters, saucepans, corkscrew, 
refrigerator. 

For mincing such foods as cold potatoes, beets, fruit, 
etc., choppers may be made by melting off the ends of small 
tin cans on top of a hot stove. A can should be selected 
that has been opened on the end not containing the inner 
circular piece of tin. After melting off the whole of the 
smooth end, the small round piece on the other end can 
be melted off without removing the whole end, if it is set on 
a red hot stove for a short time. While the can is still 
hot, run the back of a vegetable knife around the edge to 
remove the rough solder. Use this chopper on food in a 
flat pan to keep the food from spreading. 

Bread, pie, and cake tins should be placed in the oven 
before using the first time, and be heated until they are 
tarnished. This wiU give the food baked in them a better 
color. 

A vegetable mill is almost indispensable to a kitchen. 
This with its various dies may be used for grinding onions, 
nuts, stale bread, legumes, corn for cornlet, etc. 

Some of the articles shown in the accompanying illus- 
tration should be found in every kitchen. Experience has 



362 VEGETAEIAN COOK BOOK 

tauglit US that it is to tlie advantage of every cook to have a 
reasonable number of labor-saving devices at hand. 

A bakery brush such as is shown in the illustration is 
very handy for brushing up the flour from the molding 
board. 

The spatula has so many uses that a person who once 
finds out its value, will never be without one. 

The peel is very convenient for removing pies, gem 
pans, and such articles from the hot oven. 

For one of the uses of the pie marker, see Unfermented 
Rolls. 

For beating large quantities of eggs and many other 
things, the batter whip is indispensable. 

The pastry brush is used to brush the tops of two- 
crust pies. See Pastry Glazing. 

The cake tin shown in the illustration is desirable, be- 
cause the cake can be so easily removed. The same results, 
however, can be obtained by placing in the bottom of the 
tin an oiled piece of manila paper. 

The trough scraper is a convenient article for scra- 
ping the dough from the board or table, as well as clean- 
ing the trough. 

There are several varieties of flour sieves, but one sim- 
ilar to that shown in the cut is the most practical. It 
can be used to strain thin sauces and soups, as well as for 
flour. 

For family use the steamer here shown is very prac- 
tical, as it can be set over a pie tin with water in it, 
or over a large kettle. 

Double boilers of the shape shown in the cut are better 



UTENSILS 363 

than those with more flaring bottoms, because they take up 
less room on the stove. 

The sieve represented in the illustration is very service- 
able for removing dirt from such articles as beans, pea- 
nuts, etc. If the seedless raisins from which it is so dif- 
ficult to remove the stems, are placed in this, and vigor- 
ously rubbed, good results will be obtained. 

The milk-pan strainer is the right size to fit an eight 
quart double boiler; and having a flare bottom, it is very 
handy for straining soups, tomatoes, etc. 

The Chinese strainer is serviceable for such work as 
washing raw rice, and straining thin gravies, sauces, and 
soups. 

The metal batter bowl is not so likely to be broken, and 
for all-round purposes is more practical than the earthen 
ware. 

The vegetable mill shown in the accompanying illustra- 
tion can be so adjusted as to cut fine or coarse slices. It 
also has a device for pushing the vegetables to be cut, 
toward the cutting knives, so that there need be no danger 
of cutting the fingers. 

There are many varieties of food grinders. The one 
shown in the cut is a good one, having several dies. The 
kitchen equipment is not complete without it. 

The asbestos mat is especially convenient where one is 
cooking over gas or oil fires, or where one wishes some 
article to cook slowly. 

Gem pans similar to those here shown, are preferable 
to the ones having flat bottoms. 

A soapstone griddle will be found a great aid in pro- 



364 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

ducing desirable hot cakes or in broiling protose, nnttolene, 
and the like. Food preparations are not so liable to stick 
to such a griddle, therefore less oil need be used. 

A pan used for the preparation of omelets should not 
be used for anything else. 

Shir pans similar to the ones shown, are made for one 
or two eggs. The pan should not be too large, or the egg 
will spread out too thin. 

Three brushes are shown on the page of illustrations. 
The vegetable brush is convenient for washing celery, and 
other vegetables that are to be cooked with the skins on, 
such as potatoes for baking, new potatoes, beets, etc. The 
other brushes will be found useful in the washing of pots. 
The iron dish-cloth is also a desirable adjunct. 

By the assistance of the vegetable scoop, imitations of 
new potatoes may be scooped out of large old potatoes. 
These, cooked and served with canned peas in the early 
spring, are quite suggestive. With the use of this scoop, 
balls of jelly or gelatine may be prepared for garnishing 
salads and desserts. 

An ice pick similar to the one shown will be found to 
save time and money in cutting ice. 

A French knife is much more convenient for mincing 
vegetables and other foods than the kind that leaves no 
room for the hand between the handle and the cutting 
board. If one possesses two such knives, grasp the handles 
of both in the right hand, and place the palm of the left 
over the back of the blades to hold the points in position ; 
then with rapid up-and-down motions of the right hand, 



UTENSILS 365 

the mincing of parsley, celery, and other vegetables will 
be found to be very easy. 

No kitchen should be without its steel, and every cook 
should know how to use it. Much time is lost because of 
dull knives. 

A wire potato masher will enable the cook to prepare 
a much better article in a great deal less time than with a 
wooden one. 



FOOD TABLES 



FOOD TABLES 

In the accompanying tables of food values, published 
by Prof. W. 0. Atwater, Ph.D., in a bulletin of the United 
States Agricultural Department, the nutritive food ele- 
ments are classified under four heads: protein, or that 
which builds muscle and other tissue; fat and carbohy- 
drates, which supply heat and energy; and the ash, or 
mineral, which contains elements needed to repair bones 
and nerves. Gluten, found principally in wheat ; albumen, 
in eggs and meat; casein, in milk; fibrin, in flesh; and 
legumin, in legumes, are protein. Carbohydrates include 
starch and sugar. According to scientific research, it has 
been found that to nourish the body properly it must be 
supplied with about five times as much of the carbohy- 
drates as of the protein. 

This is a matter all should understand, for thus much 
inconvenience may be avoided.

aFruits contain a certain portion of inedible materials, as skin, seeds, etc., 
â¢which are properly classed as refuse. _ In some fruits, as oranges and prunes, 
the amount rejected in eating is practically the same as refuse. In others, as 
apples and pears, more or less of the edible materal is ordinarily rejected with 
the skin and seeds and other inedible portions. The edible material which is 
thus thrown away, and should properly be classed with the waste, is here 
classed with the refuse. The figures for refuse here given represent, as nearly 
as can be ascertained, the quantities ordinarily rejected. 

2)Milk and shell. 

cThe average of five analyses of cereal coffee grain is: Water 6:2, protein 
13.8, fat 8.4, carbohydrates 72.6, and ash 4.5 per cent. Only a portion of the 
nutrients, however, enter into the infusion. The average in the table repre- 
sents the available nutrients in the beverage. Infusions of genuine coffee and 
of tea like the above contain practically no nutrients. 



FOOD COMBINATIONS 



FOOD COMBINATIONS 

If one would obtain the best result from food, certain 
rules in regard to its combination should be observed. This 
instruction applies to all, but more particularly to the 
cook who has the framing of the bill of fare for the home. 
We recommend simplicity in diet, bringing in variety, not 
by having many kinds at one meal, but by varying from 
meal to meal. Therefore such foods as are placed on the 
table should be those that combine well. For example, a 
fruit dessert such as berry pie should not be served with 
a vegetable dinner. Squash or custard pie might be served 
in its place. If it is desired to serve a fruit dessert, such 
foods as rice, macaroni, and nut foods might accompany it. 
If a careful study is made of this phase of dietetics, much 
good will follow. Study the classifications given below. 

GOOD COMBINATIONS 

Grains and fruits. Grains and eggs. 

Milk and grains. Grains and vegetables. 

BAD COMBINATIONS 

Sugar and milk. Fruit and vegetables. 

Milk and meat. Fats with fruits or vegetables.

The following table of weights and measures may be 
helpful in case no scales are at hand: 

5 heaping tablespoons of flour 1 cupful. 

5 heaping tablespoons of sugar i^ cupful. 

2 rounding tablespoons of flour 1 ounce. 

I heaping tablespoon of sugar 1 ounce,

By practise one is enabled to guess quite accurately as 
to the amount of grain to be used with any given amount 
of water in the cooking of cereals. For the benefit of be- 
ginners and any who wish to be accurate, the following 
table is given. It is not our purpose to make this list an 
extensive one, as good judgment will tell one that various 
grains of the same nature, will require the same amount 
of water; for instance, rolled oats and rolled wheat.

The time required for cooking depends on tlie kind of 
cereal, and upon the method by which it is cooked. The 
first seven given in this list are more wholesome when 
cooked from three to five hours. The last four will cook 
properly in one half to one hour.

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS 



GENERAL SUGGESTIONS "'^ 

Add a little milk or lemon juice to the water in which 
corn is to be cooked. 

The addition of a small amount of sugar to field peas 
will improve them and make them almost like garden peas. 

Allow raisins to stand in boiling water for a few 
minutes if you wish to remove the stones. 

In baking potatoes, cut off one end, so that the steam 
will have an opportunity to escape. They will then come 
out more mealy and dry. A novel method is to cut off a 
narrow paring all around the potato. 

To keep celery, roll it in manila paper and then in a 
cloth. Keep in a dark, cool place. 

In baking custards and other preparations where it is 
desired to set one pan inside of another with water be- 
tween them, it will be found convenient to use an iron 
dish-cloth to separate the two pans. 

To remove the disagreeable odor of onion from the 
hands, rub them with freshly mixed mustard, and then 
rinse well. 

To prevent new enameled ware from cracking, grease 
the inside with butter before using. 

To make water bottles, vases, and the like look clear, 
add cut lemons to the water, and shake well. 

If by mistake eggs are boiled longer than intended, 
drop them in cold water, and allow to remain for half 
a minute. 

Wrap ice with paper or flannel sheet to keep from 
melting. 

(383) 



384 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

To preserve the freshness of a cake or batch of cookies, 
and to impart a delicate flavor, place an orange or a cut 
apple in the box with them. 

Fit your pie paste to the tin by using a chunk of bread 
dough instead of your hand. Bake your pie shells between 
two pie tins to keep from blistering. Don't put the filling 
in hot, or the crust will be tough. 

Grind dough for sticks in a vegetable mill instead of 
pounding or pulling it. Roll it out about one half inch 
thick, and mark it off with a pie marker. It saves time. 

Bake meringue in a slow oven and it will be thicker. 

GARNISHING 

Garnishing of dishes has a great deal to do with the 
appearance of a dinner table. Each dish should be suffi- 
ciently garnished, yet not done to excess. 

With a potato ball cutter, scoop out balls from gela- 
tine mold or jelly which is solid enough to hold its form. 
Use these in garnishing desserts or sweet entrees. 

The attractiveness of a roast is much enhanced if gar- 
nished with fresh mashed potatoes as it can be tastily done 
by forcing them through a pastry bag and tube. Mayon- 
naise or other salad dressings may be added to salads in 
the same way. Nut butter, when thick, may be dropped 
on the butter chips from a pastry tube in a very attractive 
manner. 



TABLE ETIQUETTE AND RULES 
FOR WAITERS 



26 



TABLE ETIQUETTE 

The refinement of an individual, and the nature of the 
home training, are nowhere more clearly revealed than 
at the table. Carelessness in regard to good table manners 
shows thoughtlessness for the feelings of others unfortu- 
nate enough to be dining at the same table, and will 
probably be looked upon as ignorance and lack of culture. 
For this reason good table etiquette should be insisted 
upon at the family table. This will insure good manners in 
the presence of guests or when entertained away from 
home. 

The following suggestions on table etiquette are of fun- 
damental importance, and will be found applicable to all 
occasions. 

GENERAL TABLE ETIQUETTE 

When giving a dinner, avoid crowding the table, as the 
serving can be done more effectively and with less annoy- 
ance to the guests where the chairs are not crowded to- 
gether. 

Guests should remain standing until the hostess seats 
herself. 

When a gentleman has accompanied a lady to the din- 
ing-room, he should see that she is first seated before taking 
his own place. 

Necessary introductions should be given before the 
guests are seated, and never afterward. 

The napkins should be unfolded below the level of the 

(387) 



388 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

table ; and in wiping the lips, should be used as inconspicu- 
ously as possible. 

A gentleman places bis half unfolded napkin over the 
left knee. It should never be tucked under the chin or 
in the waistcoat. 

Unless one is at home, the napkin should not be folded 
at the close of the meal. 

Seat yourself quietly at the table, without dragging the 
chair forward; and in rising do not push the chair back 
from the table before attempting to rise. 

Sit in an upright position at the table, without leaning 
back in the chair or forward against the table. 

Never sit with the elbows on the table nor extended from 
the body when eating. 

Keep your feet in front of the chair, and not twisted 
around its legs nor extended too far under the table. 

In eating, do not lean over the plate nor incline the head 
to meet every mouthful. Â«.â- ..Â»--â¢â ...w 

Keep the hands away from the face and the head, andy 
when possible avoid coughing. 

It is never good manners to read at the table when others 
are present. 

Do not toy with the fork, knife, spoons, or anything 
about your plate. 

In serving, do not heap the plates. 

Always serve ladies first. 

In passing the plate for more, always remove the knife 
and fork, and do not continue eating until the plate has 
been returned. 



TABLE ETIQUETTE 389 

In asking for anything at the table, address by name 
the one who can most conveniently serve you. 

When a plate is offered to you by the one serving; do 
not pass it to some one else unless asked to do so. 

Do not refuse to take the last piece on a plate, as there 
is supposed to be more. 

Should you observe that something is desired by another, 
do not hesitate to pass it, lifting the dish in doing so. 

Never lean forward across the table to reach for any- 
thing, nor reach in front of others. 

Never take so large a mouthful that you can not con- 
veniently speak. 

Chew the food with the mouth closed, and as quietly as 
possible. 

Eat slowly. Rapid eating is a violation of good manners, 
and the laws of health as well. 

The last bit of food in the mouth should be swallowed 
before leaving the table. 

Be careful not to soil the table-cloth. No waste matter 
should be laid on it. 

Salt should not be put on the table-cloth. 

If anything objectionable is found in the food, never 
betray the fact to others. 

Do not embarrass hostess or guests by appearing to 
notice accidents. 

Never speak about the exceUenee of your own food or 
dishes, nor offer apologies for them. 

Never urge a guest to eat food which he has declined. 

Never put toothpicks on the table, nor use them at the 
table. 



390 VEGETAEIAN COOK BOOK 

At a public dining-room, ladies as well as gentlemen al- 
ways rise from the table if another stops to speak to them. 

At a private table, never leave until all have finished. 

Ladies should pass out of the dining-room before the 
gentlemen. 

Knives and forks should be held so that the handles rest 
in the palms of the hands ; and in using a knife, the fore- 
finger rests on the upper part of the blade. 

When it is necessary to use both knife and fork, the 
knife is held in the right hand and the fork in the left. 
In this case the food should be carried to the mouth with 
the fork in the left hand. It is never proper to transfer 
the fork from one hand to the other, but it should be used 
with ease in either hand. 

Hold the fork in the right hand in courses where no 
knife is required. 

Never carry food to the mouth with the knife. 

Do not use the back of the fork to carry food to the 
mouth. 

Never substitute a spoon where the fork can be used. 

Do not entirely fill the spoon, nor overload the fork. 

Do not hold the handle of the spoon in the palm of the 
hand. 

Carry the food to the mouth with an inward movement 
of the hand. 

Hold the fork or spoon in a sidewise position when eat- 
ing, and not with the handle pointing toward the opposite 
side of the table. 

If the knife, fork, or spoon is accidentally dropped, in- 
stead of reaching for it, ask for another. 



TABLE ETIQUETTE 391 

When through using the knife and fork, lay them on 
the plate parallel to each other, the knife being on the 
right, with the sharp edge next to the fork, and the tines 
of the fork down. 

PROPER MANNER OF EATING VARIOUS FOODS 

Soup should be eaten from the side of the spoon, and 
without the noise of sipping. It should be dipped up with 
the side of the spoon toward the farther side of the plate. 
Never tip up the plate in eating. 

Thickening the soup with crumbs is bad form. 

In eating bouillon, the spoon is used until only a little 
liquid is left. This remaining portion may be drunk from 
the cup, which is lifted by one of its handles. 

Vegetables and made dishes are eaten with a fork. 

The spoon is used for soft desserts, cooked fruits, and 
fresh fruits served with cream. 

Remove bread from the plate with the fingers, and never 
with a fork. 

Do not cut the bread, but break it, and butter each piece 
as it is needed. To butter the bread, do not hold it in the 
hand, but lay it on the side of the plate. 

When drinking coffee or any beverage served in cups, 
remove the spoon before lifting the cup to the lips. 

Place the spoon in the saucer when not using it. 

When drinking, look into the cup or glass. 

Never blow into a cup or soup dish to cool its contents. 

Never drink from a saucer. 

Before drinking from a glass, always wipe the lips. 



392 VEGETAEIAN COOK BOOK 

Lift a goblet by the stem, and take bold of tumblers just 
below the center. 

Do not bend the head backward when drinking, nor tip 
the glass or cup too much. 

Apples, peaches, and all large fruits should be cut with 
a knife, and not eaten whole. 

Remove seeds from the mouth with the fingers, and lay 
them on the plate. 

Olives should be eaten with the fingers. 

Artichokes are eaten with the fingers. 

Ice-cream may be eaten with a spoon or ice-cream fork. 

Unstemmed strawberries are eaten with the fingers. 

Melons, if soft enough, may be eaten with a spoon. 

Pineapple may require the use of both knife and fork. 

GENERAL RULES FOR WAITERS 

This chapter has been prepared after years of experience 
in conducting public dining-rooms, and includes instruc- 
tions which will greatly aid in the training of inexperienced 
waiters and in reducing their work to a system. Each 
waiter should have access to the rules, and be required to 
become familiar with them. 

SETTING THE TABLE 

1. Place the table-cloth on the table evenly, being careful 
that the corners are at equal distances from the floor. 

2. See that the sugar bowls, salt shakes, oil cruets, etc., 
are clean and well filled. 

3. Place the silver, china, and napkins on the table in 
their proper places. 



TABLE ETIQUETTE 393 

RULES FOR SERVING 

1. Step to the left of a guest in taking an order. Main- 
tain a pleasant and polite attitude, and pay strict attention 
to the order given. 

2. Deliver the order exactly as called for, to avoid dis- 
satisfaction on the part of the guest; and be as prompt as 
possible. 

3. In filling orders, select hot dishes for hot foods, and 
cold dishes for cold foods. Place all cold foods on your tray 
first, so as to serve the hot foods as hot as possible. 

4. Always change an order that is not perfectly satis- 
factory. 

5. Report all serious complaints to the one in charge 
of the work. Never have any dispute with a guest. 

6. In serving, place dishes carefully on the table from 
the left side, removing them in the same manner, 

7. Coffee, milk, grape juice, or other beverages, and all 
liquid foods, should be served and removed from the right 
side. 

8. In handling a dish, grasp it by the edge with thumb 
and finger, but never place the hand over the dish in grasp- 
ing opposite edges. 

9. In placing drinking glasses on the table, or in remov- 
ing them for filling, do not place your fingers inside the 
glass, but grasp firmly on the outside. 

10. Always turn the handle of a cup toward the guest. 

11. Never put a spoon in the guest's soup or coffee. 

12. Remove soiled dishes from the table after each 
course. 



394 TBGBTARIAN COOK BOOK 

13. Always offer the finger-bowl after fruit and at the 
close of the meal, 

14. As soon as the guest has left the table, remove aU 
remaining soiled dishes, and brush crumbs from the table- 
cloth, being careful to keep them from falling into the chair 
or on the floor. 

PERSONAL SUGGESTIONS TO WAITERS 

1. Always be pleasant and courteous. 

2. Be constantly on the alert to supply every need of the 
guest, and so far as possible anticipate his desires. Es- 
pecially in sanitariums, where you are dealing with sick 
people, show them every consideration, and strive to please 
them. 

3. Train your mind to act quickly, use good judgment, 
and keep cool. 

4. Avoid a loud tone of voice in giving an order in the 
kitchen or pantry, or in speaking to any one in the dining- 
room. 

5. Be careful to give your order to the cook clearly and 
distinctly, so as to avoid delays that would come from a 
misunderstanding. 

6. Handle the dishes carefully, and so avoid all possi- 
bility of embarrassing accidents, 

7. In placing dishes on the table, do not push them 
against one another, but handle them with as little noise 
as possible. 

8. Give the same courteous and prompt attention to 
each guest. 



TABLE ETIQUETTE 395 

9. Do not engage in conversation with one another while 
on duty. 

10. Carry the tray on the left hand, and do not rest 
it on the backs of chairs while removing or placing dishes 
on the table. 

11. Personal cleanliness and neatness in appearance are 
essential to every waiter. 

DON'TS FOR WAITERS 

1. Don't make the guests call for everything they need, 
but keep your eyes open to anticipate them. 

2. Don't annoy guests by staring at them or standing so 
close as to interfere with their conversation. 

3. Don't dictate to guests. 

4. Don't offer to shake hands with guests, or visit fa- 
miliarly with them in the dining-room. 

5. Don't stand in ungraceful lounging attitudes against 
the wall or leaning on the backs of chairs. 

6. Don't refuse to help one another if doing so will give 
better service. 

7. Don't clean your finger nails, pick your teeth, nor 
scratch your head in the dining-room. 

8. Don't fish for tips. 

FAMILY DINNER WITHOUT SERVANTS 

The aim of every housekeeper should be to set a table 
that will be attractive in appearance, even though the food 
may be of the plainest. To this end everything to be used 
upon the table should be scrupulously clean â the cloth 



396 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

should be fresh and smoothly ironed, the dishes carefully 
washed and polished, and the silver bright. Neatness and 
order in arranging the table appointments are essential. 
Carelessness in these matters encourages carelessness in 
table manners. 

LAYING THE TABLE 

Cover the table with a silence cloth. This may be of 
felt or canton flannel, and serves as a protection to the 
polished table, improves the appearance of the table-cloth, 
adds to its wearing qualities, and deadens the sound made 
by setting down the dishes. 

Place the linen cloth over the silence cloth smoothly, 
and with its center exactly in the center of the table. As 
a matter of economy as well as appearance, a cloth of good 
quality will be found most satisfactory. 

A centerpiece of flowers or ferns is a desirable addition 
for all occasions, and may be tastefully arranged with almost 
endless variety. 

Place the desired number of service plates around the 
table in symmetrical order. The plates and silver should 
be laid about one inch from the edge of the table. 

Place the knife on the right of the plate, with the sharp 
edge turned toward it; and next to the knife the soup 
spoon, with the bowl up. 

On the left of the plate place the dinner fork, with the 
tines up. 

The forks and spoons for other courses are placed on 
the table as needed. 



TABLE ETIQXJETTE 397 

Place the folded napkin squarely on the table to the left 
of the fork. 

At the right of the plate and opposite the point of the 
knife, place the glass. 

Place the olives and salted almonds on the table on 
either side of the centerpiece and in line with it. 

THE SIDEBOARD 

After laying the table, see that the sideboard contains 
the fruit juice, and a pitcher of water in case it should be 
preferred, forks and spoons for later courses, and a bowl 
of cube sugar with the tongs. It should also contain finger- 
bowls, two thirds full of tepid water. These, with dessert- 
spoons, should be placed on doilies on the dessert plates. 

SIDE TABLE 

On the side table place tablespoons, a carving knife 
and fork, a tray covered with a doily, extra napkins and 
silver in case of emergencies, a crumb tray and scraper for 
removing crumbs, or a plate and napkin for that purpose. 

Plates for the hot courses should be kept M^arm, and 
those for salad and dessert should be chilled.

"He Buttle (reek Diet System" 



^This system, based upon the latest findings of scientific re- 
search in relation to human nutrition, and proven by a quarter 
of a century of experience at the Battle Creek Sanitarium, has 
restored many thousands of invalids to health, and enabled 
many thousands more to double their efficiency. It tells you 
â what to eat and hov/ to eat so as to live twice as long and 
twice as well. 

^ If you desire information about this unique system, cut out 
this paragraph, mail to us with your name cind address, and 
w^e w^ill send you our illustrated booklet, " Healthful Living," 
w^hich tells about our diet system and toothsome delicacies. 
The following foods compose only a small part of the Battle 
Creek Diet System. 

PROTOSE: A substitute for meat, and a most remarkable 
preparation in that it possesses all the food elements found in 
beefsteak, arranged in about the same proportion, with a total 
nutritive value much greater ; a surprise to the eater on account 
of its superior qualities of flavor, nourishment, and digestibility. 

KELLOGG'S CARAMEL CEREAL: The original Cereal 
Coffee, the first thing of its kind ever developed in Battle 
Creek. It has the endorsement of the Battle Creek Sanitarium, 
w^here it has been used for thirty years as a substitute for the 
real coffee. 

KELLOGG'S TOASTED RICE FLAKES: The universal 
cereal food made from rice. Rice is used by almost every 
nation under the sun, but never before has it been served in 
such an attractive form. 

If your grocer does not carry these in stock, write us, sending 
his name and address.

VEGETARIAN FOODS 

Used and endorsed by the leading Sanitariums and Health 
Institutions in the world. 

â ^(Bi* No soda, baking powder, alum, lard or other animal fats (ex- 
cepting butter and cream) used in the manufacture of our products. 

The following are a few of our leaders : 

MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

Nut Cero is a combination of nuts and grains scientifically prepared as a 
substitute for meat, as an article of diet. The high percentage of nutrition 
(49 calories to the ounce) makes NUT CERO equal to about I I -3 lbs. of 
the best lean beef in nutritive value. 

Its relative cheapness, its digestibility and entire absence of poisonous 
animal products make NUT CEI^O an ideal proteid food. 

NUT CERO is manufactured under medical supervision. 

CEREAL AND BREAKFAST FOODS 

Fruit N uts, a very palatable and nutritious granular breakfast food thoroughly 
cooked and ready to serve vi^ith cream or fruit juice. Especially adapted to 
the use of brain workers, and, being easily digested, meets the needs of in- 
valids and children. 

Wheat Flakes (Toasted) 

Wheat Flake Biscuit (Toasted) 

BREADS 

Zwieback â Twice baked bread No-Soda (White) Crackers 

Graham Crackers Fruit Crackers 

BEVERAGES 

Sanitarium Carainei Cereal, the leading coffee substitute on the 

market. While we advise against drinking at meals, to those who feel they 

must have something, we are pleased to offer CARAMEL CEREAL as 

being harmless as a beverage, yet meeting the desire for Mocha or Java. 

Malted Nut Meal â Very nutritious for invalids or children 

Unfermented Grape Juice â Two kinds â Zinfandel and Muscatel 

DIABETIC FOODS 

No. 1 Gluten Meal No. 2 Gluten Meal Sanitarium Meal
