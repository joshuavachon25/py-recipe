Ripe Old Age 

is only attained by preserving 
those faculties with which 
nature has endowed us. The 
smiling, contented, happy, 
bright eved old man will tell 
us that he owes the preserva-

care of his eyes in youth and 
middle age. There is nothing 
which a scientific optician can 
do that we will not do for you 
and your eyes. Eyes tested

STRAWBERRY JAM. 

Stem o-arden strawberries and lay them on a dish 
sprmkle them well with sunjar, and if possible let them stand 
nil ninht, so that the juice may l)e well extracted from the 
truit and the berries kept in better form ; to each pour d 
ot the fruit allow one and a half pounds oranulated su-rar 
put the su<rar in the preserving' kettle, pour' the juice on "the' 
su-i-ar and put it on the tire, stirrinn- till it boils : when 
clear put in the fruit and let it boil for twenty minutes 
then put in jars with bi-andied paper on top, and cover over 
with pasted paper: the (ixtra (piantity of sugar does not 
Miake the jam any sweeter, but the syrup is brighter and 
richer, and as sugar is cheaper than fruit the (luantity does 
not increase the cost of the jam.

HOW TO CODK SWEETBREADS 

Soak tl J sweetbreads in salt and water, chanain<; the 
water two or three tin)es, and then wash them wellln "plain 
fresh watrr ; plun<re them into boiling stock, and let them 
t.oil rapidly till done; place them on a drainer, and leave 
them to get cold ; then trim off all superfluous irristle and 
fat, and pass them throu^rh the mincing-machine together 
with some good thick slices of a well-flavoured cooked ham, 
for twelve cutlets you will require the grated rind of one 
lemon, the white and yolk of two eggs ivell beaten some 
treshly ground black pepper, salt to taste, and a couple of 
smallish onions chopped up fine; well mix with the band 
tor.n into carefully shaped cutlets, dip into well-beaten i^<r<y 
and then roll in tine bread crumbs; if this be done some 
hours betore the cutlets are wanted, they "will be much 
hrnier and better, and in the frving (which should be don.' 
in fresh lard or good oil), will assume a beautiful <rolden- 
l)rown colour. '"'
