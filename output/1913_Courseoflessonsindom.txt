INTRODUCTION 

Food is that which, when taken into the body, builds and 
repairs the tissues and furnishes heat and energy to the body. 

The chemical substances of which the body is composed are 
very similar to the composition of the foods which nourish it. 

From fifteen to twenty elements ?.re found in food and in 
the bodv, the most important of wiiioh are carbon, hydrogen, 
oxygen, nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, and sulphur. 

Food is classified according to its chemical composition into 
the following groups: Proteins, carbohydrates, fats and oils, 
and mineral matter. 

Food principle is the term applied to these classes into which 
foodstuffs are divided. 

Proteins 

Protien is that food principle that contains carbon, hydrogen, 
oxygen, and nitrogen. It is derived from animal and veget.i.ble 
sources, builds tissue and repairs waste, and yields a certain 
amount of heat and energy. Found ''n meat, fish, eggs, milk, 
peas, beans, and grains. 

CARBOHYDRATEi: 

Carbohvdratpc is that food principle that contains carbon, 
hydrogen, and oxvgen. It is derived from vegetable sources and 
yields heat and energy. 

Fats and Oils 

Fats and oils contain the same elements as carbohydrates 
but in different proportions. They also furnish heat and energy 
and constitute the fatiy tissues of the body. They are derived 
from animal and vegetable sources. • 



MiNi-KAi. Matter 

Mineral matter includes compounds of lime, sodium, iron, 
etc. It occurs in all articles of food, principally in fruits, meats, 
vegetables, and small amounts are found in cereals and grains. 
It is essential to life, is necessary in the blood, and aids digestion. 
The most common being sodium chloride which is taken into the 
body in the simple form of table salt. 



LESSON 1 
Cakf. of thf. Kitchen 

1 Work quietly. 

2 Work neatly, keep things picked up and unnecessary 
things out of the way. 

3 Do not allow wooden handles of knives, forks, etc., in hot 
water. 

4. Do not put the wheel of the dover egg beater in water, 
wipe It on the dish cloth and allow it to dry. 

5 Wipe sauce pans and dish pans on the dish cloth, not on 
dish towel. 

6 Wash dish cloth in hot water, rmse in cold water. Hang 
both dish cloth and dish towel on rack before leaving the room. 

7 Before leaving the room see that the stove and the top 
o!^ the desk, the soap and match dishes are clean. See that all 
articles are in the desk. Keep knives free from stain. If they 
are stained rub a little Sapolio on the dish cloth and rub them 
with that. Never rub knives or anything with the cake of Sapolio. 

Care of Refrigerator 

The waste pipe of the refrigerator or ice box should empty 
into a pan or into the open end of a properly trapped drain pipe; 
it should never be continuous with the drain pipe, such an ar- 
rangement making easy the passage of sewer gas into the refrig- 
erator. 

Keep the inside of the food chamber dry. See that no food 
remains in the refrigerator long enough to spoil. Empty the p?.n, 
if there is one. every day. 

Clean the refrigerator at least once a veek. Take out both 
food and ice. Wash shelves and racks with hot soap suds or with 
a sal-soda solution, and rinse with clear water. Dry them in the 
open air or by the fire. Wash inside walls the same way. Clean 
the grooves and corners with a skewer, and run a wire with a 
cloth wrapped around it down the waste pipe. Rinse the pipe 
with hot sal-soda solution. Wipe the refrigerator dry. 



Carf of thf Sink 

When dish washing is finished, wash every part of the sink 
with hot, soapy water. Wash above and around the sink. 

Flush the sink with boiling -.yater every day and about once 
a week with a strong solution of washing soda. 

Dish Washing 

Directions — 

1 Have the dishes scraped. 

2 Pile all articles of each kind together; plates by them- 

selves, the largest at the bottom; cups by themselves; 
silver articles together, and steel knives and forks to 
themselves. 

3 Use hot soapy water. 

Soaking Dishes — 

Cold water should be used for soaking dishes which have 
been used for milk, eggs, and starchy foods. Hot water 
for dishes used for sugar substances and for sticky, 
gummy substances like gelatine. Greasy dishes of all 
kinds, including knives, are more easily cleaned if 
first wiped with soft paper, which should be burned.

LESSON 2 

Cooking is the preparation of food by the application of heat. 

1 By direct application of heat, as broiling, toasting. 

2 By means of heated air, as: baking. 

3 By means of moisture, as: 

(a) Boiling water 

(b) Stewing, just below the boiling point. 

(c) Steaming, either with a steamer that comes into 
direct contact, or a double boiler with the metal between 
the steam and the food wnicli is known as dry steam. 

4 By means of heated fat, as: 

(a) Frying, immersed in fat. 

(b) Saute, frying by means of a small amount of fat.

LESSON 5 • 

STARCH 

Starch is a white glistening powder; it is largely distributed 
throughout the vegetable kingdom, being found most abundantly 
in cereals and potatoes. Being a force producer, and heat giver, 
it forms one of the most important foods. Alone it cannot sustain 
life, but it must be taken in combination with foods which build 
and repair tissue. 

Under the microscope starch is seen to consist of irregularly 
shaped granules. Starches from different plants differ from one 
another, granules of potato starch being larger than those of any 
other kind and somewhat like oyster shells in shape and markings, 
while rice starch granules are angular and very small.

LESSON 7 

CEREALS 

Cereals are cultivated grasses used for food. They rank 
first among vegetable foods. They include wheat, oat^, rye. 
barley, corn, and rice. 

From cereals many preparations are made. From rice is 
made rice flour; from oats, oatmeal, rolled oats, avena, Quaker 
oats, etc. From corn are made cornmcal, cornstarch, hominy; 
''rom wheat, flour, wheatlet. cracked wheat, etc. Rye is used 
for rye flakes, meal and flour; barley for flour and pearl barley; 
buckwheat for flour. 

They are composed largely of starch and a form of albumen 
called gluten. 

They contain but little water and hence a large amount of 
water must be added in the cooking. Raw starch is indigestible, 
so all foods containing starch should be thoroughly cooked.

LESSON 8 

SUGAR 

Sugar is a crystalline substance differing from starch by its 
sweet taste and its solubility in cold water. As a food its uses 
are the same as starch. All starch must be converted into su^ar 
before it can be assimilated. 

The principal kinds of sugar are: Cane sugar, or sucrose; 
milk sugar, or lactose; grape sugar, or glucose; and fruit sugar, 
or levulose. 

The kind we usually mean when we speak of sugar is made 
from the juice of the sugar cane. The sugar cane is a tropical 
plant, belonging to the family of grasses. It looks like corn, but 
grows sometimes twenty feet high. 

The sweet juice obtained by crushing the cane stalks between 
rollers is boiled to thick syrup in large copper vessels. As it 
slowly cools part of it separates into crystals. 

The liquid that will not crystalize is called molasses. After 
draining this off, raw sugar, a coarse, impure, brown product, is 
left. This raw sugar is mixed with hot water, treated with lime 
to neutralize any acid present, and then filtered through flannel, 
and then through charcoal. Next it is boiled in vacuum pans. 
These are covered vessels from which part of the air has been 
exhausted. Under this reduced pressure the sugar solution can 
be evaporated to a thick syrup without danger of burning it. 

Granulated sugar is obtained from this syrup by putting it 
into rapidly revolving cylinders which throw out the uncrystallized 
part of the syrup, leaving a mass of white crystals. 

When the syrup is run into molds to harden and then cut 
into cubes, it is called cut or block sugar. 

. Honey is the purest natural form of sugar. 

Beet sugar is made from the sugar beet.

' • LESSON 9 

BAKING POWDER 

Baking powder is composed of soda and cieam of tartar in 
definite, correct proportions, mixed with a small quantity of flour 
or cornstarch to keep action from taking place. If found to con- 
tain alum or ammonia it is impure. In using baking powder use 
two teaspoonfuls to each cup of flour when eggs are not used; to 
egg mixtures allow one and one-half teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder. 

Soda and cream of tartar or baking powder mixtures are 
made light by liberation of gas in the mixture; the gas in soda is 
set free by the acid in the cream of tartar. In order to accom- 
plish this, moisture and heat are both required. As soon as mois- 
iure is added to baking powder mixtures the gas (C02) will begin 
to escape. It fills the batter or dough with bubbles, making it rise 
higher and higher. As the gas expands the walls of the bubbles 
stretch and become thin. Just at this stage, if the oven is right, 
the heat sets the mixture and imprisons the gas. In too hot an 
oven a crust form.s before all the gas is set free; in too cool an 
oven the bubbles break and the gas escapes. 

Bicarbonate of soda is an alkaline substance and contains 
carbon dioxide. 

Cream of tartar is an acid substance. 

Acid and alkalme substances are opposite in their natures. 

Experiment I 
Put into a cup ' ^t soda and pour on it 'iC of boiling water. 

Experiment 2 

Put into a cup '_it of soda and pour on it '4C of boiling 
water. Add to this a little more than '4! of cream of tartar.

LESSON 10 

FLOUR MIXTURES 

Flour mixture is a term applied to those dishes composed of 
a definite amount of flour moistened by a given amount of liquid. 
In addition to this they usually contain a leaven and flavoring. 

Leavens — 

Baking powder 

Soda (acts on acid and forms carbon dioxide gas) 

Albumin in egg 

Flour mixtures fall roughly into two groups: Batters and 
doughs. 

A batter is any flour mixture that can be beaten. There are 
two kinds: Pour or thin batter. Drop or thick batter. 

A dough is any flour mixture that can be molded with the 
hands. There are two kinds: Soft and stiff.

4 Roll to ' .. inch thickness, cut with doughnut cutter, 
and fry in deep fat. 

Rules for Deep Fat Frying 

Great care must be taken that too much is not put into the 
fat at one time, not only because it lowers the temperature of the 

38 



fat, but because it causes it to bubble and go over the sides of the 
kettle. It is noi the fat that boils over but water which the fat 
has received from the food. 

All fried food on removal from the fat should be drained 
on brown paper. 

Rules for Testing Fat for Frying 

When the fat begins to smoke drop in an inch cube of bread 
from the soft part of the loaf, and if in 40 seconds it is a golden 
brown, the fat is then of the right temperature for frying any 
cooked mixture, as fish balls. 

Use the same test for uncooked mixtures allowing 1 min- 
ute for the bread to brown, as for doughnuts.

LESSON 13 



BREAD AND BREAD MAKING 

Bread is the most important article of food, and historv tells 
of its use thiousands of years before the Christian era. Many 
processes have been employed in making and baking; and as a 
lesult, from the first flat cake has come the perfect loaf. The 
study of bread making is of no slight importance, and deserves 
more attention Ihan it receives. 

Bread is made from flour of wheat, or other cereals, by ad- 
dition of salt, water, and a ferment. Wheat flour is best adapted 
to bread making, as it contains gluten in the right proportion to 
make the spongy loaf. \ 

The difference between bread and pastry flour may be 
readily determined. Take bread flour m the hand, close the hand 
tightly, then open, and the flour will not keep its shape; if allowed 
to pass through the fingers it will feel slightly granular. Take 
pastry flour in the hand, close the hand tightly, open and flour 
will be in shape, having the impression of the lines of the hand, 
and feel soft and velvety to the touch. 

Flour should always be sifted before measuring. 

Entire wheat flour differs from ordinary flour inasmuch as 
it contains all the gluten of the wheat, the outer husks of kernels 
only being removed, the remainder ground to different degrees 
of fineness and left unbolted. 

Gluten, the protein of wheat, is a gray, tough, elastic sub- 
stance, insoluble in water. On account of its great power of 
expansion, it holds the gas developed in bread dough by fermen- 
tation, which otherwise would escape. 

Yeast 

Yeast is a microscopic plant of fungous growth, and is the 
lowest form of vegetable life. It consists of spores, or germs, 
found floating in the air, and belongs to a family of which there 
are many species. These spores grow by budding and divi^-ion, 
and multiplying very rapidly under favorable conditions, and 
produce fermentation. 

Fermentation is the process by which, under influence of 
air, warmth, and moisture, and some ferment, sugar is changed 
into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The product of all fermentation 
is the same. Three kinds are considered: Alcoholic, acetic, 
and lactic. Where bread dough is allowed to ferment by addi- 
tion of yeast, the fermentation is alcoholic; where alcoholic fer- 
mentation continues too long, acetic fermentation sets in, which 

AO 



is a continuation of alcoholic. Lactic fermentation is fermenta- 
tion which takes place when milk sours. 

Liquid, dry, or compressed yeast may be used for raising 
bread. The compressed yeast cakes done up in tiijfoil have long 
proved satisfactory, and are now almost universally used, having 
replaced the home made liquid yeast. 

Never use a yeast cake unless perfectly fresh, which may be 
determined by its light color and absence of dark streaks. 

The yeast plant is killed at 212° F.; life is suspended, but not 
entirely destroyed at 32° F. The temperature best suited for its 
growth is from 65° to 75° F. The most favorable conditions for 
the growth of yeast are a warm, moist, sweet, nitrogenous soil. 
These must be especially considered in bread making. 

Bread Making 

Bread is made by mixing to a dough, flour, with a definite 
quantity of water, milk, or water and milk, salt, and a ferment 
Sugar is usually added to hasten fermentation. Dough is then 
kneaded that the ingredients may be thoroughly incorporated 
covered, and allowed to rise in a temperature of 65° to 75° F. 
until the doup;h has doubled its bulk. This change has been 
caused by the action of the ferment, which attacks some of 
the starch in the flour and changes it to sugar, and sugar in turn 
to alcohol and carbon dioxide, thus lightening the whole mass. 
Dough is then kneaded a second time to break the bubbles and 
distribute evenly the carbon dioxide. It is shaped in loaves, put 
in greased pans (they being half filled) covered, allowed to rise 
in a temperature same as for first rising, to double its bulk. If 
risen too Ions: it will be full of large holes; if not risen long 
enough it will be heavy and soggy. If pans containing loaves 
are put in too hot a place while rising, a heavy streak will be 
found near the bottom of the loaf. 

How TO Shape Loaves and Biscuits 

To shape bread dough in loaves, divide dough in parts, each 
part large enough for a loaf, knead until smooth, and if possible 
avoid seams in the under part of the loaf. 

To shape bread dough in biscuits, pull or cut off as many 
small pieces (having them of uniform size) as there are to be 
biscuits. Work in the hand until smooth, place in greased pan;- 
near together, brushed between with a iitfle melted butter, which 
will cause them to separate easily after baking. 

Biscuits may be shaped in a variety of ways, but they should 
always be small. 

Bread and bisciits are often brushed over with milk before 
baking, to make a darker crust. 

41 



Where bread is allowed to rise over night, a small piece oF 
yeast must be used; ' j yeast cake to one quart of liquid being 
sufficient. Bread mixed and baked during the day requires a 
larger quantity of yeast. 

Baking of Bread 

Bread is baked: ( 1 ) To kill ferment, (2) To make soluble 
the starch, (3) To drive off alcohol and carbon dioxide, and (4* 
To form a brown crust of pleasant flavor. Bread should be 
baked in a hot oven. If the oven be too hot the crust will brown 
quickly before the heat has reached the center, and prevent 
further rising; the loaf should continue rising for the first 15 
minutes of baking, when it should begin to brown, and continue 
browning for the next 20 minutes. The last 15 minutes it should 
finish baking, when the heat may be reduced. When bread is 
done it will not cling to the pan, and may be easily removed. 

Biscuits require more heat than loaf bread, should continue 
rising the first 5 minutes and begin to brown in 8 minutes. Ex- 
perience is the be^t guide for testing the temperature of the 
oven. 

Bread may be brushed over with melted butter just before 
taking from the oven if a more tender crust is desired. 

Care of Bread After Baking 

Remove loaves at once from the pans, and place side down 
on a wire bread or cake cooler. If a crisp crust is desired, allow 
bread to cool without covering; if a soft crust, cover with a 
towel during cooling. When cool put in a tin box or stone jar 
and cover closely. 

Bread tins or jars should be washed and scalded twice a 
week in winter, and every other day in summer; otherwise bread 
is apt to mould.

LESSON 19 



CAKES 

Cakes may be classified tinder two heads: Cakes without 
butter or sponge cakes; cakes with butter or cup cakes. Pow- 
dered sugar makes a fine grained cake. 

Use only the best material — fresh eggs, fine granulated 
sugar, good butter, pastry flour, and good baking powder. 

Use an earthen bowl and a wooden spoon for mixing cakes. 

Have all the materials ready for use (flour measured, eggs 
broken, etc.) before beginning to put them together. 

Take care not to make work for yourself by using more 
utensils than are necessary. 

Cover flour bin, sugar jar, baking powder can, etc., as soon 
as you have taken from them what you need. 

Baking Cakes 

Test the oven with a piece of white paper. If it turns a 
light yellow in five minutes it is ready for sponge cakes; if a 
dark yellow in five minutes it is ready for cup cakes. Cake 
should not be moved in the oven until it has risen its full height. 
When it feel^; firm to the touch, shrinks from the pan, and a 
straw inserted comes out clean, the cake is done. 

The time required for baking a cake should be divided into 
four periods: During the first period the cake should rise, but 
not brown; it should .continue to rise during the second period 
nnd should brown in spot^. In the third period it should become 
V light brown all over, rnd during the fourth period it should 
become a deeper brown and should shrink from the sides of 
the pan.

LESSON 20 

PASTRY 

All the materials must be as cold as possible. 

The shortening should not be cut too fine if a flaky crust is 
desired. 

The dough should be mixed with a knife and not touched 
with the hands. It should be rolled on one side, using but little 
flour. The dough is rolled thin and baked until brown. 

Meat and oyster pies should be made without an under crust. 
The crust should be cut in several pieces to allow the steam to 
escape. 

If an under crust is desired, this crust may be baked first and 
then filled. In this case the crust must be pricked all over with 
a fork, so that it may keep its shape. 

If two crusts are used, the lower one should be moistened 
around the edges with cold water, then a '2 inch strip of paste 
may be placed around the edge of the under crust. This strip 
should also be moistened, and the upper crust placed over the 
pie and pressed slightly around the edges. 

The paste may be made the day before using, then covered 
and placed on the ice. It will roll more easily if placed on the 
ice after mixing. 

Plain Paste 
Materials — 

1 i/c flour 
1 -.c lard

CONDIMENTS 

Condiments are not classed among fopds, but are known as 
food adjuncts. They are used to stimulate the appetite by adding 
flavor to food. Among the most nnportant are spices and flavor- 
ings. 

Black Pepper is ground peppercorns. Peppercorns are dried 
berries of a plant grown in the West Indies, and other eastern 
countries. 

White Prpper is made from the same berry, the outer husk 
being removed before grinding. 

Cayenne Pepper is the powdered pod of Capsicum, grown on 
The eastern coast of Africa and Zanzibar. 

Mustard is the ground seed of two species of the Bras.^ca. 
One species yields white mustard seed; the other, black mu'^tard 
seed. Both species are grown in Europe and America. 

Ginger is the pulverized root of a plant grown in Jamaica, 
China, and India. 

Cinnamon \^ the ground inner bark of a tree growM in 
Ceylon. 

Clo^'e is the ground Hower buds of a plant grown in Zanzibar 
?.nd the West Indies. 

Pimento (commonly called allspice) is the ground fruit of a 
plant grown in lamaica and the West Indies. 

Nutmeg is the kernel of the fruit of a plant grown in the 
Banda Islands. 

Vinegar is made from apple cider, malt, and wine, and is the 
product of fermentation. It is a great preservative, hence i^s use 
in making pickles, sauces, and other condiments. 

Capers are flower buds of a plant grown in the countries 
bordering the Mediterranean. They are preserved in vinegar, 
and bottled for transportation. 

Horseradish is the root of a plant native to Europe, but now 
grown in our own country. It is generally grated, mixed with 
vinegar, and bottled.

LESSON 21 

SOUPS 

Soups are divided into two classes. Those with stock and 
those without stock By stock is meant the soluble portions of 
meat and bone, together with soluble portions of vegetables 
extracted by long cooking, these are more or less solid when cold 
according to the gelatinous quality of the materials used. 

Soups with Stock 

1 Bouillon — made from lean beef, delicately seasoned and 
clear. 

2 Brown Soup Stock — made from beef, highly seasoned 
with vegetables, spices, and herbs. The color being increased by 
browning the meat before adding the liquid. 

3 White Soup Stock — made from chicken or veal, delicately 
seasoned. 

4 Consomme — usually made from two or three kinds of 
meat, highly seasoned with vegetables, spices, and herbs. Always 
served clear. 

5 Lamb Stock — delicately seasoned is served as mutton 
broth. 

Soups Without Stock 

Usually have for their basis white sauce. 

1 Cream Soups — made of vegetables or fish, with milk and 
a small amount of seasonings. Always thickened. 

2 Puree? — made from vegetables or fish, forced through a 
strainer and the pulp retained in the soup. 

3 Bisque — like purees, except the meat or vegetables are 
cut in dice and served in the soup. 

Note. — Binding. Purees will separate the liquor from the 
solid or vegetable pulp unless they are bound together. The 
term bind in soups means to thicken with flour and water rubbed 
<=mooth, or flour and butter. The starch combines the solid with 
the liquid and prevents the solid from sinking to the bottom.

Proteins build up tissue. Albuminoids are the only proteins 
that we can prove build tissue. Gelatinoids do not really do this. 
They dissolve when heated, and stimulate the secretion of the 
digestive juices. Extractives are the flavoring matter of the 
meat, and have no power to build tissue. They simply stimulate.

MEAT 

Meat is the name applied to the flesh of animals used for 
food. In the markets this name is applied only to the flesh of 
cattle, sheep, and hogs. That of mature animals being known 
as beef, mutton, and pork, respectively; that of calves as veal, 
and of lambs as lamb. Meats consist of muscular tissue or lean 
connective tissue, as tendons, gristles, etc., fatty tissue, blood 
vessels, nerves, bones, etc. 

The chief refuse in meat is bone. Bone contains some nu- 
triment and may be utilized in making soup. 

The nitrogenous compounds of meat are made up chiefly of 
albuminoids and gelatinoids. The albuminoids are so called 
because they resemble albumin or white of egg in their proper- 
ties, and the gelatinoid substances are so named because of their 
similarity to gelatine. 

Meat contains mineral matters which have value as food. 

After slaughtering, meats undergo marked changes in tex- 
ture. These changes may be grouped under three classes or 
stages. 

In the first stage, when meat is just slaughtered, the flesh is 
soft, juicy, and tender. In the next stage the flesh stiffens and 
the meat becomes hard and tough. In the third stage it becomes 
soft and tender and acquires added flavor. The softening is due 
to the formation of lactic acid, which acts upon the connective 
tissue. 

The flavor of meat depends upon the kinds and the amount 
of "nitrogenous extractives" which it contains. 

Meat is a protein food, therefore builds and repairs tissue. 
It also furnishes some heat and energy, but in such small quan- 
tities that it must be combined with such food as bread, potatoes, 
rice, e'c, in order to furnish the heat and energy required. Meat 
is digested in the stomach. 

The chief object in cooking meat is to loosen and soften the 
tissues, which facilitates digestion by exposing them more fully 
*-o the action of the digestive juices. Another important object 
is to kill the 7erms. Another object is to coagulate the albumin 
and blood so as to render the meat more acceptable to the sight, 
and the development and improvement of the natural flavors, 
which is often accomplished in part by the addition of condi- 
ments. 

If meat is placed in cold water, part of the organic salts, 
the soluble albumin, and the extractives or flavoring matter are 
dissolved out If the water is gradually heated more of the sol- 
uble material? are dissolved. At a temperaUire of about 134" F. 
the soluble albumin will begin to coagulate and at 160° F. the 
dissolved albumin will ri:^e as a brownish scum to the top and the 

75 



liquid will become clear Upon heating still higher the connec- 
tive tissues begin to be changed into gelatine and are partially 
dissolved out while the insoluble albuminoids are coagulated. 
The longer the action of the hot water continues, the tougher and 
more tasteless the meat becomes, but the better the broth. 

If a piece of meat is plunged into boiling water or very hot 
fat, the albumin on the entire surface of the meat is quickly 
coagulated, and the enveloping crust thus formed resists the dis- 
solving action of water and prevents the escape of the juices 
and flavoring matters. Thus cooked, the meat retains most of 
its flavoring matter and has the desired meaty taste. The result- 
ing broth is correspondingly poor. 

In broiling steak an intense heat should be applied in order 
to coagulate the album.in and stop the pores, and thus prevent 
the escape of the juices. In roasting the meat should be exoosed 
to an intense heat at first by olacing it in a hot oven. This is 
done to coagulate the albumin, and thus prevent the escape of 
the juices. For a large roast, after the albumin on the outside 
has been coagulated, the heat in the oven may be reduced and 
the roast basted every 15 minutes. The smaller the roast the 
hotter the oven should be to quickly coagulate the albumin on 
the outside and prevent the interior from drying up. 

.A.S soon as meat is brought into the house, take it out of' 
the wrapping paper, wipe it with a damn cloth, cut out any part 
discolored by a meat hook and set away in a cool place. 

The Beef Anmmai. 

The animal is divided into two parts cut along the backbone. 
Each part is called a side of beef. 

The second division is between the ribs and the loin, the 
ribs being left on the fore part, called respectivelv the fore and 
hind quarter.

or with the edge of a heavy plate. Saute quickly in a hot frying 
pan; then add water enough to cover it. Cover the frying pan 
very tightly so that the steam cannot escape and allow the meat 
to simmer for two hours, or until tender. One advantage of this 
dish is that ordinarily it is ready to serve when the meat is done, 
as the gravy is already thickened-

LESSON 29 



FISH 

As ordinarily used, the term fish includes, besides the fish 
proper, many other water animals, as oysters, clams, lobsters, 
crawfish, crabs, shrimps, turtle, and terrapin. 

Fish meat, with but few exceptions, is less stimulating and 
nourishinj^ than meat of other animals, but is usually easier of 
digestion. 

The muscles of fish have large fibers and little connective 
tissue. It is this which makes the fish break so easily. 

The flesh of fish containing little fat, and that mostly in the 
liver, is white. Fat is more abundant in the dark fleshed fish and 
is found throughout the body. 

To obtain from fish its greatest value and flavor, it should be 
eaten fresh and in season. 

Fish should be carefully cooked. If underdone, it is not 
eatable; if cooked too long, it loses its flavor and becomes dry. 
If it is to be cooked in water, a little lemon iuice or vinegar 
hardens the fish, thus helping to keep it whole. 

Fish is commonly boiled, steamed, broiled, baked, or may be 
combined with other materials in some made dish. In most cases 
fa^s and carbohx'drntes in the form of butter, flour or other ma- 
terial are added to fish when cooked and thus the deficiency in 
fuel incredients is made good. 

Broiled or steamed fish is often accompanied hv a sauce 
made from butter, eggs. etc. Baked fish is often filled with a 
dressing and mav also be accompanied hv a sauce. The dres'^ing 
being made of a bread, butter, e^c. contains fats and carbo- 
hydrates. 

Fish belongs to the protein foods and shouH he served wi'h 
such foods as bread, butter, ootatoes. .^reen vegetables, and fruit^> 
By adding materials in cooking and bv "^ervinw others with ^hf^ 
cooked pro-^uc^. the protein of the fish is supplemented by the 
necessary fats and carbohvdrates. 

Fish builds and repairs muscular tissues and is digested prin- 
cipally in the stomach. 

To Determine Freshness of Fish 

When fresh, the eye? are bright, the gills are red. the flesh 
firm and odorless. 

When fish comes from the market. \\ should be taken J'mm 
the paper at once. It should then be washed inside and out wi^h 
a cloth wet in cold salt water and dried with a clean cloth kept 
for the purpose. Do not allow fish to soak in water. Put it in 

81 



the refrigerator on the ice with the skin side down, but not in 
the same compartment with butter, milk, or other foods that 
absorb flavors. 

To Clean Fish 

1. Cut open along the under side full length, and remove 
the entrails. 

2. Remove scales by beginning at the tail and scraping 
toward the head, using a dull knife. 

3. Wash quickly inside and out. 

Boiled Fish 

1. Wrap fish in cheesecloth and drop in boiling water to 
which has been added the juice of one lemon, or IT vinegar. 

2. Time for cooking depends on the amount of surface ex- 
posed. Usually for medium size from 20 to 30 minutes. 

3. Drain well, remove from the cloth, garnish with parsley, 
lemon, or egg sauce. 

Note. — Vinegar coagulates the albumin and holds the fish in 
shape. 

Fish Balls 
Materials — 

Ic salt codfish 

1 heaping c potato 

2 eggs 

I jT butter 
pepper to taste 

Method — 

1 Wash fish in cold water. Pick in small pieces or cut 
with the scissors. 

2 Wash, pare, and cut potato in uniform size before 
measuring. 

3. Cook fish and potato in boiling water to cover until 

potatoes are soft. Drain through strainer, return to 

the kettle and mash thoroughly. 
4 Add butter, eggs well beaten, and pepper. Beat 

with a fork until light. 
.S Take up by spoonfuls, put in frying basket, fry one 

minute in deep fat. Drain on paper. Reheat fat 

after each frying. 

Salmon Croquettes 

Materials — 

Ic salmon, flaked ; ^ 

85 



Ic thick white sauce 
salt and paprika 
IT lemon juice 
IT chopped parsley 

Method — . 

1 Mix fish and sauce, add seasonings. Spread on a 
plate to cool. 

2 Form into croquettes, egg and crumb, fry in deep fat, 
drain, garnish with parsley. 

Note." -The mixture shaped in pyramids may be gar- 
nished with small paper frills made on toothpicks and 
inserted in the top. 

To Sh.'vpe Croquettes 

The most common way is to form a ball by rolling one 
rounded T of the mixture between the hands, then rolling on the 
board until desired length, and flattening the ends. 

May also be formed in pyramids or shaped in any fancy 
foirn.

LESSON 30 

FATS AND OILS 

Fats and oils are found in both the vegetable and animal 
kingdoms. 

Meats, milk, fish, and eggs are the principal sources of ani- 
mal fat. Among the animal fats cream and butter are of first 
importance on account of their easy assimilation. Other ex- 
amples are: The fat of meats, bone marrow, suet, lard, etc. 

Marrow is the soft fat formed in the cavities of bones, espe- 
cially the shin bones. 

Beef suet is the hard fat which lies near the kidneys and 
loins. It is freed from membranes and chopoed very fine and 
used as shortening in puddings, etc., to make them tender. It is 
also used mixed with lard for frying purposes. 

Lard is the semi-solid !^a*: obtained bv melting and straining 
the fat from various portions of the body of the hog. 

The principal animal oils are cod liver oil and oil found in 
the yolk of the egg. 

Combinations of different fats as, cottolene, oleomargerine. 
snowdrift, etc., are used. 

We know that fats and oils are alike greasy and that fat, by 
heating it, may be changed to oil. 

Some fats are soft and oily, others firm and hard. 

Fats are solid at ordinary temperature, while oils are liquid. 
To Try Out Fat 

Cut the fat into small pieces and put into a pan in the oven 
or on top of the stove, with enough cold water to cover it, and 
simmer for several hours. When the fat is mel^'ed and nearly 
free from water, strain it, pressing to remove all of the fat. 

* To Clarify Fat 

.Melt 1-he tried out fat. add to it a few slices of raw potato and 
heat- slowly u'Ttil it ceases to bubble. The potato absorbs some 
of the impurities; most of the rest sink to the bottom. Strain the 
fat through cheesecloth and let stand until solid. 

* Frying 

Frying is cooking in hot fat deep enough to cover the food, 
so that it may be crusted over at once; reheat the fat after each 
frying and do not fry in butter. 

Of common fats butter is the worst for frying, suet from 
beef, veal, m.utton, next better, drippings better still, and lard 
next. Olive oil is superior to any of these. 

88 



Before beginning to fry any article of food have a piece of 
brown paper cut to fit a dripping pan- When the article is fried, 
drain it and place it in the pan on the paper. The paper will 
absorb the fat. 

If too many things are put in the fat at the same time they 
will be badly fried, because the temperature of the fat will quickly 
fall below the point necessary to fry properly. 

For frying doughnuts and potatoes, fat should be hot enough 
to turn a piece of bread brown while you count 60. For fish balls 
and croquettes it should turn it brown while you count 40. All 
fried articles should be well drained and should not be piled on 
each other. 

To Egg and Crumb 

Roll the article to be fried in fine bread crumbs, then dip in 
egg slightly beaten with IT water, roll again in crumbs. If not 
perfectly coated, the article may crack. 

To Prepare Crumbs 

Dry pieces of bread in the oven, roll and sift, or put through 
the meat grinder and sift. Put into fruit jars to be ready for use. 



LESSON 31 

To Select a Chicken 

Buy a chicken with firm flesh, yellow skin and legs. If young 
it will have soft, smooth legs, and tender skin; the lower part of 
the breast bone will be cartilage, soft and pliable. An abund- 
ance of pin feathers always indicates a young bird, while the 
presence of long hairs denotes age. 

In a fowl the feet have become hard and dry, with coarse 
scales, and the cartilage at the end of the breast bone has ossi- 
fied. 

Poultry full grown have the best flavor and are good for 
masting, fricassee, and stewing. Older ones make good soup or 
may be served boiled. Soring chicken should be broiled or fried. 

To Clean and Dress Poultry 

1. Remove hair and down by holding bird over flame, con- 
stantly turning it. 

2 Draw out the pin feathers with a pointed knife. 

3. Cut through the skin around the leg 1 !< inches below 
the knee joint, taking care not to cut the tendons. Place leg at 

89 



this cut over the edge of a board and press downward to snap the 
bone. 

4. Take foot in right hand and pull off with the tendons. 

5. Make an incision through the skin below the breast bone 
just large enough to admit the hand. 

6. With hands remove the entrails, gizzard, heart, liver 
(giblets), being careful not to break the gall bladder. 

7. Introduce first two fingers under skin of neck and remove 
the windpipe. 

8. Remove the oil bag and wash by allowing cold water to 
run through it. 

9. Wipe fowl inside and out. 

To Clean Giblets 

1. Remove membrane with arteries and veins from the 
heart. 

2. Separate gal' bladder from the liver, cutting away 
everything of greenish color. 

3. Cut fat and membrane from gizzard. Make gash 
through thickest part of gizzard and cut to inner lining. Turn 
outer part inside out, thus removing the inner sack. 

To Truss a Fowl 

1. Draw thigh close to body and fasten ends of legs to tail. 

2. Cut a piece of skin from end of neck to cover ends of 
drumsticks.

LESSON 32 



MILK 

Cow's milk contains fat, albumin and another substance that 
is not coagulated by heat but is coagulated by vinegar. This sub- 
stance is casein, a tissue builder. Dissolved in the whey is a 
little milk sugar and mineral matter. 

Milk is seen to contain one or more of each kind of food 
stuffs, tissue building, heat giving, and strength giving, besides 
water and mineral matter- It is the natural food for all young 
mammalia during the period of their most rapid growth, for older 
people, however, it is not a well balanced food; 8 quarts daily 
would be required. 

The greatest benefit is obtained from milk when taken alone 
at regular intervals between meals or before retiring. It should 
be sipped. Drink it slowly. Hot milk is often given to produce 
sleep. 

When milk is taken rapidly it overpowers the digestion and 
makes the person very uncomfortable. The rennin in the 
stomach is a milk curdling ferment. If the milk is sipped, small 
curds are formed; if taken too rapidly, large, tough curds are 
formed, which are digested with difficulty. 

The value of food depends as much upon how it is taken as 
upon i's qualitv. 

Meat and milk should not be served at the same time, as they 
are both protein foods and would overtax the digestion. It is not 
v/ha*- we eat but what we digest that is true food. 

\X^hen milk is allowed to stand for a few hours, "-he globules 
of fat which h?ve been held in suspension throu?hou<: the liquor, 
rise to the too in the form of cream. 

Butter is ^he fat of milk separated bv churning. It forms an 
r'd'ni'"able fattv fond i'' tpken on bread or n'-her foods not heated. 

But«-er is a wholesome fat. when fresh and sweet and becomes 
the cause of serious intestinal trouble when heated. Avoid foods 
cooked in butter. 

.Milk should he coo'ed auickly. Milk allowed -o cool grad- 
ually will quickly sour. 

Souring of Milk 

The sour taste of milk is due to the presence of an acid. 
When milk is kept at the ordinary temperature more than a few 
hours, the sugar in it changes to lactic acid. This acid, like the 
acid in vinegar, coagulates the casein. 

The change from sugar to lactic acid is caused by certain bac- 
teria found floating in the air, which attack the lactose in the 

93 



milk, converting it into lactic acid; this in turn acts upon the 
casein (protein), and precipitates it. producing what is known as 
curd and whey. Whey contains water, salts, and some sugar. 

To Scald Milk 

Put the milk in the top of the double boiler having the water 
boiling in the under part. Cover and let stand over low fire until 
the milk around the edge has a beadlike appearance.

LESSON 33 

CHEESE 

Cheese is iiiade chiefly from the milk of cows, though that of 
goats is sometimes used in making certain kinds. Cheese may 
be made from whole milk, from milk to which cream has been 
added, or from skimmed milk. Cheese is the curd of milk sep- 
arated and pressed. The curd may be separated in two ways. 
The milk may be allowed to stand until it sours or a thick clabber 
is formed. It is then slightly heated, which separates the curd 
from the whey. 

In the ordinary sweet curd cheese, the curd is separated by 
the action of retmet. The curd is then pressed to remove the 
whey. After pressure, the curd is set aside and kept at a favor- 
able temperature to ripen, the time required varying from a short 
time to three or four years. New flavors are developed and the 
texture is altered during the ripening process. The ripening of 
cheese is due to the action of bacteria and moulds. 

Cheese made from unskimmed milk is one-half fat. 

Skimmed milk cheese is sometimes "filled" by having lard or 
other cheap fat added to it. Filled cheese is greasy when warm 
and does not keep well. 

Cheese is a protein or nitrogenous food. It contains much 
nourishment in small bulk —a concentrated food. As it is a pro- 
tein food it may take the place of meat and should be eaten in 
small quantities with such foods as bread, rice, macaroni, etc. 

One pound of cheese contains as much nourishment as two 
pounds of meat. It is digested in the stomach.

EGGS 

The es^gs of many birds, both wild and domestic, are used as 
food. Hen's e,c;gs are most conmion. althoui^h the eggs of ducks, 
geese, etc., are used. 

Other eggs besides those of birds are sometimes eaten, viz: 
Turtle eggs and the eggs of fish are calted and sold under the 
name of oaviare. 

In general the term eggs, when used in connection with food 
lojMCs. refers to the eggs of birds and domestic pouUrv. 

The eggs of domestic fowls are not highly colored; those of 
hens varv from a while to a more or less brown tone, the eggs 
from a particular breed being generally of the same color. 

The eggs of ducks are bluish white; those of geese are com- 
monly white; the eggs of the guinea fowl are light brown, more or 
less mottled with a deeper shade; the egg? of turkeys are usually 
speckled with a yellowish brown- Any special coloring of eggs 
of wild birds is explamed as a protective measure, which has been 
developed to render the eggs inconspicuous in theif normal sur- 
roundings nnd therefore less easilv found bv their enemies. 

The shell of an egg is porous and consists almost entirely of 
carbonate of lime 

A fertile egg contains an embrvo or germ and is at the same 
time a storehouse of material for the growth and development of 
the voung chick, until it has reached such a stage that life is 
possible outside the shel'. 

The embrvo is situated quite near the volk, which furnishes 
the nutritive material for its earlv development, the white being 
used later on. 

Since in all cases the egg is designed to furnish the sole 
source of material for grow^th and development of the young in- 
dividual for a considerable time, it is evident that it must contain 
all the elements required; that is. it must be a perfect food for the 
purpose intended. 

98 



It must contain protein, mineral matter and water, for these 
are absolutely necessary for the making of muscle, blood, bone, 
etc. It needs fat, for that is the most compact form in which 
heat giving material can be stored. Carbohydrates are present 
in such small quantities that the figures are not given. 

Milk and eggs are often spoken of as perfect foods. It is 
true that they contain al! the required elements but the elements 
are not in the right proportion for the sole nourishment of an 
ndult individual. 

The most important foodstuff m egg is albumin. Albumin 
IS a sticky substance found in both the white and yolk. The white 
is nearly pure albumin and water; the yolk contains fat in the 
form of oil. Eggs also contain a quantity of valuable mineral 
salts. One of the constituents of egg albumin is sulphur. 

Albumin is a tissue builder and contains nitrogen, the ele- 
ment essential to tissue building. 

The lack of carbohydrates in eggs explains the combination 
of eggs with food materials containing them, as flour, sugar, etc. 

When eggs, meat, fish, cheese, or other similar foods, rich in 
protein, are eaten bread, butter, potatoes, rice, etc., are usually 
served at the same time. 

The solidifying of albumin is called coagulation. 

The firm coagulation explains the use of egg white for clari- 
fying coffee, soup, or other liquids- The albumin which is mixed 
with the liquid before boiling, coagulates, and incloses the floating 
particles, leaving the liquid clear. 

How TO Tell a Fresh Egg 

A fresh egg has a thick, rough shell. 

1. Hold the egg between your eye and the light, if clear, it 
is fresh, if cloudy it is stale. 

2. Drop the egg into cold warer. If it sinks, it is fresh; 
if it floats, it is stale. 

3. Shake the egg. holding it near your ear. If its contents 
move, it i? somewhat stale; if they rattle, it is spoiled. 

Care of Eggs 

Wash the eggs with a damp cloth when they come into the 
house. Keep them in a cool dry place. 

If part of an egg has been used the remaining portion may 
be put in a cup and covered with a damp paper or cloth to prevent 
it^ drying. The shell may be saved to clear the coffee. It is 
the albumin that sticks to the shells, not the shells, that clear the 
coffee. 

The methods of serving eggs alone or in combination with 
other food materials are very numerous. Cooked in various ways 

99 



thev are a favorite animal food, taking the place of meat to a 
certain extent. They are also used in making cakes, muffins, 
curtards, etc., to improve their flavor and texture, and also to 
leaven them. 

The white of the egg consists of millions of tiny cells filled 
with a clear, colorless, sticky liquid known as albumin. The walls 
of these cells are exceedingly delicate membranes, which are rup- 
tured or broken when the egg is beaten, allowing the contents to 
escape. The beaten white incloses air in small bubbles which 
become distributed throughout the mass of dough in mixing. The 
he?t of cookmg expands the air and makes the walls of the 
bubbles firm, so that the porous structure is retained. Popovers 
is a familiar example of a mixture leavened with eggs.

Omelets 

1. Never use more than four eggs at one time. 

2. Let the guests wait for the omelet, not the omelet for 
the guests. 

There are two kinds of omelets: Foamy, creamy. 

A foamy omelet has the air beaten in so as to expand the 
omelet. 

A creamy omelet, moisture in the egg with a small amount of 
air inclosed in stirring, are all that are needed. 

Foamy Omelet 
Materials — 
4 eggs 

1 jt salt 

Few grains of pepper 
4T hot water 
IT butter 

Method — 

! Separat? the yolks from the whites. Beat yolks until 
thick and lemon colored. 

2 Add salt, pepper, and water. 

3 Beat whites until stiff, fold into the yolks until the 
latter is absorbed. 

4 Heat omelet pan. Melt butter in pan, spread it 
over sides and bottom. 

5 Pour egg mixture into pan, spread evenly. 

6 Cook slowly until a delicate brown on the under side. 

7 When well puffed, place pan in oven to dry, not 
brown, the top, with the oven door open- 

8 Fold and turn omelet on hot platter. 

Note.— Omelet is done when it does not adhere to the 
finger when pressed. 

To Fold and Turn an Omelet 

1. Hold pan in the left hand. With a case knife make two 
half-inch incisions opposite each other at right angles to the 
handle. 

101 



2. Place knife under part of omelet nearest the handle, tip 
pan to nearly a vertical position. 

3. By carefully coaxing the omelet with the knife it will fold 
and turn out without breaking.

top. Add a clash of paprika. 

Boiled Eggs 

Have ready a sauce pan containing boiling water. Care- 
fully put in with a spoon the number of eggs desired, covering 
them with water. It for "soft-boiled," remove pan to the back 
of the sto\e whe'-e the water will not boil, and allow to stand 6 
minutes. If for "hard-boiled," let boil slowly 30 to 45 minutes. 

In using hard-boiled eggs for making other dishes, when 
taken from the hot water they should be plunged into cold water 
to prevent, if possible, discoloration of yolks, and also that the 
shells may be removed more readily.

ning a silver knife through custard; if knife comes 
out clean, custard is done. 

3 During baking, care niiist be taken that water sur- 
rounding the mold does not boil, or the custard will 
separate- Always bear in mind that eggs and milk in 
combination must be cooked at a low temperature.

SALADS 

Salads are dainty and appetizing dishes prepared from meat, 
fish, vegetables, or fruit combined with fat in some form 3nd 
acid in some form. 

Usually used as a refreshing, appetizing dish to stimulate 
the appetite rather than to furnish nutrients for the body, 
although vegetables and fruit salads being especially rich in 
mineral salts and an abundance of water are of great value in 
the diet. 

Salad? are classified as to —

LESSON 39 

GELATINE 

Gelatine exists in the muscles, skin, cartilage, bone, tendon, 
ligament, or membrane of animals. In its raw state it is termed 
collagen- By boiling in water the collagen of connective tissue 
is dissolved and converted into gelatine. Collagen is a trans- 
parent, tasteless substance. 

After the selected parts of the calf have been subjected to 
their various treatments of baths and boiling, the product is run 
out on to screens where it soon form.s into what is known as 
sheet gelatine. This sheet gelatine may be of various thick- 
nesses. Where it is to be granulated it is made very thin. The 
sheets are irregular in shape. After the drying period, it is 
broken and then ground. Gelatine is insoluble in cold water, 
soluble in hot water. If boiled, gelatine will not solidify on 
cooling.

blows with the mallet. Remove all coarse pieces. 
.^ Empty can, adjust the dasher, fill three-fourths full 
of the mixture to be frozen. Place carefully in 
wooden tub in groove. Put on the cover, adjust the 
top, trying crank to see that it fits. 

IM' 



4 Allow 3 measures of ice to 1 of salt. Mix ice and 
salt in pan before putting it in the freezer. 

5 Pack Firmly around the can using the handle of the 
mallet to force it down. Ice should come a little 
above the mixture in the can. 

6 Turn crank slowly and steadily to expose as large a 
surface as possible to the ice and salt. When frozen 
to a mush turn more rapidly. 

7 After the mixture is frozen, draw off the water, re- 
move the dasher, and pack the cream solidly with a 
spoon. Put cork in opening of cover. 

8 Repack the freezer, using 4 measures of ice to 1 
of salt. Place carpet, newspaper, or burlap over the 
top and leave 3 or 4 hours to ripen.

LESSON 42 

TEA, COFFEE AND COCOA 

Tea 

Tea is made from the dried leaves of the tea plant. Tea is 
commonly classed as green and black. Both kinds come from the 
same shrub, but differ in age and method of curing. 

Green tea is made from young leaves, which are prepared 
quickly, soon after gathering. Black tea is from older leaves, 
which undergo longer preparation and different processes. 

There are two substances in tea, theine and tannin. Theine 
is a stimulating substance. Tannin is an astringent. The best 
brands of black tea are imported from India and Ceylon; the best 
green tea comes from China and Japan. 

Coffee 

The coffee tree is native to Abyssinia, but is now grown in 
all tropical countries. The seeds of berries of coffee trees con- 
stitute the coffee of commerce. Each berry contains two seeds. 
with the exception of the male berry, which is a single round seed. 
Brazil produces about two-thirds of the coffee used- Central 
America, Java, and Arabia are also coffee centers. The coffee 
best suited to average taste is in the proportion of two pa'ts Java 
to one part Mochn. Coffee, like tea, contains tannin, and its 
stimulating effect is due to caffeine and a volatile oil. The dif- 
ference in flavor and odor between coffee and tea is caused by 
the difference in the aromatic oils thev contain. 

Cocoa 

Cocoa and chocolate are both prepared from the seeds of the 
cocoa bean. Cocoa beans are dried and roasted to develop the 
flavor; the outer covering is then removed; this covering makes 
cocoa shells, while the beans are broken into cocoa nibs. The 
prepared cocoa is made from the nibs and much of the fat known 
as cocoa butter is pressed out. the cocoa being powdered and 
frequently mixed with other substances, as sugar and starch. All 
the fat is left in the chocolate. 

The stimulating substance in cocoa and chocolate is theo- 
bromine and is similar in its nature to theine and caffeine. 
Unlike tea and coffee, cocoa contains valuable food material. 
The cocoa bean is native of Mexico.

Tea 

Put one scant teaspoonful of lea in a granite or earthen 
teapot and pour over it Ic of freshly boih'ng water. Let steep in 
a warm place for 3 to 5 minutes, but never allow tea to boil.

of the coffee into a cup to free the spout of grounds. Return to 
the coffeepot and repeat, add 2T cold water to complete the pro- 
cess of clearing, and let stand in a warm place where it cannot 
boil for !0 minutes.

LESSON 43 

SANDWICHES 

In preparing bread for sandwiches, cut slices as thinly as 
possible, and remove the crusts. If butter is used, cream the 
butter before spreading. Spread half the slices with mixture to 
be used for filling, cover with remaining pieces, and cut in 
squares, oblongs, or triangles. If sandwiches are shaped with a 
round or fancy cutter, bread should be shaped before spreading, 
that there may be no waste of butter. Sandwiches which are 
prepared several hours before ^erving-time may be kept fresh 
and moi't by wrapping in a napkin wrung as dry as possible out 
Tf hot water, and keeping them in a coo! place. Bread for sand- 
wiches cuts better when a day old. 

Lettuce Sandwiches 

Put fresli, crisp lettuce leaves, washed and thoroughly dried, 
between thin slices of buttered bread, having a teaspoon of may- 
onnaise on each leaf. 

Egg Sandwiches 

Chop finely the whites of hard-boiled eggs; force yolks 
through a strainer. Mix whites and yolks with mayonnaise to 
moisten, season with salt and pepper. Spread mixture between 
thin slices of bread. 

Pimento Cheese Sandwiches 

Put 2rb of American cheese, 1 can of pimentoes, and ■ It) 
of nuts together through a food chopper. Pack in fruit jars until 
ready for use. When used, if not moist enough, add a little milk 
to make the consistency to spread. Spread mixture between 
thin slices of bread
