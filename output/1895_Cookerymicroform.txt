INTRODUCTION. 



^ 



INTRODUCTION. 



A jrreat deal of attention has of late been given to the 
su])ject of Cookery, yet there still exists a most woeful 
ignorance of this most important household art. 
When we realize how much the general well-being of 
man depends upon the food he eats, we cannot but be 
filled with amazement that in these days of high civili- 
zation and advanced science, such ignorance of the first 
necessity of life should still find a place. If it formed, 
as it should, a part of every girl's education to be 
thoroughly taught the principles and general ground- 
work of cookery, how much misery might be avoided ! 
The wife of the poor man would spend her small allow- 
ance to the best advantage in buying, not what at first 
sight seems cheap food, but that which really gives the 
most nourishment for the lowest sum— thus " Making 
the most out of the least," and by the intelligent pre- 
paration of it, avoid waste, and give her family food 
good for the body and pleasant to the eye ; while the 
rich wife would find her servants much more easy to 






1^ 



COOKERY. 



manage and direct, if she herself, possessed a practical 
knowledge of their work. 

IJrillat-Savarin says: — "But for life the universe 
were nothing, and all that has life requires nourish- 
ment." Civilized man requires that nourishment in an 
appetizing form, and though I by no means advocate 
the use of extravagant material or waste of time in over 
decoration, I do most strongly urge upon my pupils 
the advisability of great daintiness in the preparatioTi 
and appearance of their dishes. At the same time do 
not allow the true use of the food to be lost sight of, 
and by no means sacrifice the utility of a dish to its ap- 
pearance. 

There is not room in a work of this kind to go deep- 
ly into the needs of the body. While a little child can 
tell us that we live by means of the food we eat, and 
that without food we die, the question as to how that 
food is the means of life, opens up a vast field of 
knowledge. The body has frequently been compared 
to an engine. As heat and motion are given to the en- 
gine by the burning of fuel, so in the body by the burn- 
ing of food. In both cases the carbon and hydrogen 
are burnt by means of the oxygen in the air , which, in 
the case of the body, is taken into the lungs with every 
breath. 

Professor Church says : — " What happens in the 
body is briefly this. The greater part of the carbon 
and hydrogen in the dry matter of food, after under- 



INTRODUCTION. 



Pfoing certain changes, becomes quietly and steadily 
burnt in the body into carbonic acid gas and water. . 
. The force or energy laid up in the com- 
pounds thus burnt, is given out partly as heat which 
Keeps the temperature of the body up to blood heat, 
and partly in other forms, as that of mechanical motion. 
All the internal and external work of the body is thus 
done by the stored up energy of the food which is burnt 
or oxidized therein. This food, by digestion and assi- 
milation, becomes indeed first of all a part of the body, 
and then, but not until then, to any extent does it burn 
and give rise to heat and motion." 

So that it is not sufficient to eat a certain amount of 
food, regardless of its digestibility, for as we have seen, 
to be of use it must be such that the body can digest 
and assimilate. As an old proverb has it, '' It's not 
what a man eats that nourishes him, but what he di- 
gests." Such then is the true science of cookery — to 
give such food in right proportions and so prepared 
as to be readily digested and assimilated — while art 
teaches us at the same time to make a pleasure of 
necessity. ' 

Once the fundamental principles of food and the 
cooking of it are graceful, and " the reason why " of 
things understood, it is easy for any ordinarily intelli- 
gent person to enlarge upon her knowledge. If, for 
instance, she fully understands why a joint of meat is 
placed in boiling water, while meat for stock or broth

is put into cold, why a hard boiled egg is more di- 
gestible if boiled 20 minutes than 10, why a cake is 
lighter if the white of an egg is beaten separately from the 
yoi:-, and all such simple rules, she will prepare the 
food in an intelligent manner, and there will be fewer 
failures and less indigestion with all its attendant evils.

HINTS ON SOUP MAKING 



^\ 



HINTS ON SOUP MAKING. 



The efficiency of a; cook can almost always he ascer- 
tained hy her scnips. A cook who makes good soup 
may, as a rule, be trusted with the remainder of the 
(hnner. And yet it is by no means the most difficult 
branch of cookery. Perhaps that is the very cause of 
failure, so many people will not take the trouble to do 
any easy thing well. Such good results may be obtain- 
ed from such simple material, with the use of so few 
utensils and the expenditure of so little time, that it 
should really be' one of the first things to claim the at- 
tention of the housewife. 

It has been said that the English know but one soup 
— and that one to their own misfortune. However 
true this may once have been, it can hardly be said to 
be the case now, though in many cases the same old 
mistake is made from which this accusation arose, 
which is simply this — that stock is soup — put this at 
once and forever on one side and the English will 
make soup with any nation. Stock is but the founda- 
tion from which endless varieties of soups can be made. 
Who does not know, only too well, the thin greasy 
liquid in which float a few pieces of doubtful looking 
vegetables, that goes by the name of vegetable soup, 
and which is in reality nothing but stock in its simjile 
state. Good stock very likely, and that with a little 
trouble might be made into delicious soup.

It 



Then others, a Httle more advanced, spoil the stock 
itself by piling in all the seasoning^ they Can find, and 
with commendable but mistaken economy, everythinpf 
they have no other use for, into the same stock-pot 
from which all their soups are evolved, with the result 
that no matter what the soup is called, the flavor is one 
and the same. St(x:k should never be over-seasoned, 
either with spice or vegetables ; in fact, for the more 
delicate soups it is better not flavored at all. Cianic 
and fish, as a rule, should not be mixed into the ordi- 
nary stock, but will always make a pleasant change if 
used separately. Recipes for the different stock will 
be found in their right place. 

Tlie bones of a cooked joint should always be made 
use of in this way, or boiled up with water and vege- 
tables it will make a stock good enough for many 
soups and gravies, where a rich stock is not necessary 
— such as tomato, kidney, etc. 

In buying fresh meat, the most economical for brown 
stock is the shank of beef, and for white, the knuckle 
of veal. The meat and bone should be used to- 
gether and both cut up into small pieces, so as to ex- 
tract the juices as much as possible. For the same rea- 
son the water used should be cold, and brought as 
slowly as possible to the boil, and then only allowed 
to actually boil a few minutes, after which it must cook 
as slowly as possible. If put into boiling water, the 
pores of the meat are at once closed and the juices 
kept in. 

Soups may be divided into three chief divisions, 
clear, thick and purees. The difference between a thick 
soup and a puree, is that the first is thickened by the 
addition of a starchy matter, and a puree with the in^

fjrcdicnts of the soup itself IxMnp^ rubbed thnmgh a 
sieve or tanuuy. Tt will always be fnnnd that llie 
thickened soups re(|uire more seasoninjj than the mi- 
thickened, as the fat and starchy matter serve to deaden 
the punp^ency. 

Stocks and soups nuist on no account be allowed to 
remain standinp^ any lenpfth of time in metal pans, as 
the acids, fats, etc., act on the metal, which of course 
renders the soup most unwholesome. 

To remove the fat from stock, the easiest way is to 
allow it to become quite cold, as the fat rises to the top 
it will then be readily taken off. If necessary to re- 
move it while hot, take soft kitchen paper and draw 
small pieces lightly across the top until all the fat is 
removed. 

In warm weather the stock must be boiled up every 
day to prevent its spoiling; in winter, two or three times 
a week will answer the purpose. Never put it into the 
larder while steaming hot. In the first place the heat 
will raise the temperature of the larder, and the steam 
tends to spoil other things. 

In thickening soup with yolks of eggs, very great 
care nnist be taken that it does not boil after they are 
added or they will curdle. 

Cream is far better heated separately and added to 
the soup while hot. Where there is acid in the soup 
it must not be boiling when the cream is added or al- 
lowed to boil afterwards. 

In using wines to flavor, i wineglass is quite suffi- 
cient for I quart of soup, if more is used it will, mstead 
of harmonizing with the other flavors, drown them m 
its own.

FISH. 



Perhaps the most important thing about fish 
is that it should be perfectly fresh and sweet. Stale 
fish is l)oth disagreeable to the palate and most lui- 
wholesome. ' 

First, then, we will consider how a fresh fish may be 
distinguished from a stale one. The flesh should be 
firm, and the eyes and gills bright and clear. If the 
flesh is flabby and the scales rub off easily, the fish is 
stale. Then, of course, the odor of stale fish tells its 
own tale. Some fish keep fresh longer than others, 
salmon or turbot, for instance. 

All fish must be carefully cleaned, and all traces of 
its en I '"^e blood vessel down the backbone removed. 
A little S'Lit will assist this. Touch with the hands as 
'.Ktlc as i^ossible. Thorough cooking too, is necessary, 
ihungh man" cooks make the mistake of cooking fish 
too much, which both toughens it and destroys the 
flavor. Of course the time of cooking depends entirely 
upon the size and thickness of the fish. In cooking a 
large salmon or piece of cod, do not forget that the tail 
being tliinner than the middle, will not require so long. 
For this reason it is better to divide large fish and cook 
the head and shoulders and tail separately. When 
done, the flesh separates readily from the bone, and is 
[quite white and firm. A little salt and vinegar should 



32 



COOKERV. 



always be added to the water in which white fish is to 
be boiled. Salmon is better without the vinegar. 

In boiling, always place the fish on the strainer and 
plunge it into boiling water. Boil quickly one minute, 
then only simmer very slowly. 

Salmon and salmon trout are better placed in tepid 
water. When done, lift the strainer and drain for a 
moment, the) slip the fish on to a hot dish on which is 
a neatly arrai.^^ - hot napkin. 

Grilled fish, wiir well prepared, is excellent, and al- 
most any kind may be prepared in this way. 

Fish as a food is highly nitrogenous, and should 
therefore be eaten with a large proportion of starchy 
matter. ' 

Lemon is an excellent sauce to serve with fish, as it 
increases its value as a food. 

Of course the least oily fish, such as whiting, sole, 
flounders, etc., are the most easily digested, whilst the 
Crustacea (lobsters, crabs, etc.,) are the most indi- 
gestible. 

Oysters are more digestable when eaten raw, as 
much of the nitrogenous matter they contain is ren- 
dered tough and insoluble when cooked. 

BOILED COD FISH. 



A piece from the middle of the fish is best for boil- 
ing. It must be carefully washed, great care being 
taken to remove the vein down theJ backbone. Put in 
a pan with enough boiling water to cover, and a little 
salt and vinegar. The vinegar keeps the fish a good 
color. Cook slowly until sufficiently done, take it up 
and drain for a few minutes, then dish on a hot napkin

and oraniish with cut lemon, parsley, and, if Hkcd, fried 
oysters. Serve with white or other fish sauce. 

The time to boil will depend on the thickness of the 
fish. A moderate sized piece will take about twenty tc 
twenty-five minutes. It should be white and firm at 
the bone when done. Too long or rapid l3(Mling 
toughens fish. At the same time it must be sufficiently 
cooked to be digestible. When the skin begins to 
crack, it usually is an indication that the fish is ready. 

BOILED SALMON. 

Salmon is best placed in tepid w-ater, which, after the 
fish is put in, should be brought rather quickly to the 
boil, well skinnned, and then allowed only to simmer 
till the fish is done. A little salt but no vinegar should 
be put in the water. The time to cook the salmon de- 
IKMids entirely on the thickness. Eight to ten minutes 
for each pound will generally be found long enough 
for a thick, and six minutes for a thin one. 

Salmon requires longer boiling than most fisli. 
Serve on hot napkin. Garnish with fennel and cu- 
cumber. 

RAKED HALIBUT. 

Take a nice steak of halibut, well wash and dry it, 
sprinkle with flour, pepper and salt, i)lace on a greased 
pan and cover with 2 oz. of fat bacon cut in thin slices. 

Bake half-an-hour in a good oven, basting occasion- 
ally ; dish up garnished with little rolls of bacon, slices 
ot" lemon and small sprays of parsley, and pour round 
the gravy from the pan. 

Cod or other fish may be cooked in this way.

BOILED HALIBUT. 

For a piece of halibut weighing four pounds, put in 
enough boiHng water to cover, with a little salt and 
vinegar. Let the water reboil after the fish is added, 
then skim carefully and cook slowly about twenty-five 
minutes. ' 

Ser\'e on a hot napkin, garnished with cut lemon and 
parsley, and a good fish sauce in a boat. Anchovy, 
lobster, oyster or shrimp sauce are very good with 
halibut. ' 

HALIBUT CUTLETS. 

Cut some *^icc outlets about an inch thick from the 
fish. Wash in salt and water, and dry them in a 
towel. Sprinkle them with lemon juice, finely chopped 
parsley, salt, pepper and essence of anchovy. Allow 
them to stand one hour, then dip in egg and bread 
crumbs, and fry five minutes in hot fat. Serve with 
anchovy sauce.

basin and break one egg into it, add a little milk and 
mix the flour from the sides gradually into it, then add 
ihe other egg and more milk ; beat well, add seasoning 
and pour the batter over the fish ; bake in good oven

COOKERY. 



Fowls will require from half-an-hour to an hour and 
a (|uarter, according to age and size. They are best 
wrapped in buttered paper or cloth ; a few sprigs of 
parsley in the water is a great improvement; also a 
little lemon juice rubbed on the breast will render it a 
better color. 

BROILING. 

Meat to be broiled, is better after hanging a day or 
two ; it then mayi be sprinkled with pepper and salt, or 
allowed to lie an hour or two in oil and vinegar, or 
other marinade, after sprinkling. In any case, a very 
clear fire is necessary, charcoal being the best ; a good 
substitute may be made of wood, all the flames to be 
burned out and the clear ^mbers left. Failing this, of 
course the ordinary coal fire may be used, or gas. 
Make the broiler very hot, rub it over with a little fat, 
put on the meat and turn constantly; cook according 
to size, a beef steak of one pound will take about ten 
minutes, but the thickness of the meat must be taken 
into consideration. When done, rub over with a little 
butter, and serve at once. 



BRAISED MUTTON. 

I boned shoulder of mutton — 4 oz. bread crumbs — 2 oz. 

suet, or fat from the shoulder — rind of % a lemon 

I tablespoon chopped parsley — i egg — pepper and 

salt — a little thyme, or other herbs may be used — 

a little milk or stock. 

Chop the suet finely, mix it with the bread crumbs, 

add the lemon rind, parsley, etc., and moisten with the 

egg and milk. With this force-meat stuff the mutton,

ROAST WOODCOCK AND SNIPE. 

These birds are dressed in the same manner. They 
should be plucked with great care, as the skin is par- 
ticularly tender. The wings cut off at the first joint, the 
head and feet left on. Do not draw them. Press d\c 
legs to the side and pass the beak of the bird through 
them and the body. Brush over with butter or go(3d 
dripping, put a piece of slit bacon on the breast, and 
cook about fifteen minutes. Put toast under to catch 
the gravy. Dish on the toast, and garnish with fresh 
water- cress. 



ROAST HARE. 

A hare is better for hanging 7 or 8 days after it is 
skinned and cleaned. StufT with a good veal force- 
meat, and truss as follows : — 

First sew the skin together where it was cut, then cut 
through the sinews of the hind legs, press them towards 
the head, and draw the forelegs back, pass a skewer 
through the two legs, right through the body and the 
other two legs in the same way. Press the head back 
and pass a skewer through the top of the shoulder and

Cut the pipfcons in half and saute them in butter for 
five minutes., pour over the stock and cook slowly one 
hour. Roll the force into balls and add them, cook 
fifteen minutes lonj^^er, then ])lace the birds in a disli, 
with the balls of force, sliced 'eggs, stock and wine, 
cover with choux paste, using a forcing-bag and plain 
pipe for the purpose ; brush with whole beaten egg and 
bake in good oven about forty minutes. 

If the pie is to be served cold, the paste must be 
baked separately and put on just before serving. To 
do this, butter a pan sliglitly, and force the paste on to 
it in the shape of the dish to be used, but a little larger. 

STEWED PIGEONS. 

Cut 2 pigeons in half, sprinkle them with flour, pep-

fried croutons of bread. 

ROAST TURKEY. 

A turkey may be roasted without any force-meat 
whatever, or stuffed with sausage, veal force-meat or 
chestnuts. When force-meat is used it should be put 
in place of the crop. Little balls may also be made 
and used as a garnish. It should be basted very fre- 
quently whilst cooking, or it will be dry and tasteless. 

A small turkey will require about one hour and a-half 
to cook, while one weighing about 14 lbs. will take

Cut off the head, leaving the neck with the skin on 
the bird. Open the skin at the back of the neck and 
remove the crop. Then cut through the first joint of 
the wings, take the bone in the left hand and scrape off 
the flesh with the right, using a sharp knife for the 
purpose. Great care must be taken that the skn is not 
broken, while all flesh must be removed from the bone. 
The wing bones may be removed to the second or third 
joint, as desired, the small pinion is best left in so as to 
retain the shape. Now, having removed the bone of 
both wings, raise the flesh all round, lift the "merry 
thought," and take the flesh from under it, now take 
the flesh from the breast and back, this is easily done 
by keeping the knife close to the bone. In taking the 
skin from the top of the breast, cut a little of the gristle 
with it so as to insure not cutting the skin. Twist the 
legs so as to dislocate the first joint, then remove the 
flesh in the same way as the wings, but chop off the 
bone on the inner side one inch above the third joint, 
thus leaving the feet on the bird, continue down the 
body, cut through the joint of the " parson's nose," 
this is also left on the fowl. The whole carcase is now 
free. All that remains to be removed are the sinews 
from the breast and legs. Those in the breast are 
easily seen and can be cut out to remove them from the 
legs, cut round the skin about an inch below the joint, 
chop through the bone, then pull out the sinews, if they 
are found difficult to pull out all together, take them 
separately. The bird is now ready for the force. 
When this is in, truss for roasting or boiling and cook 
in any way desired. 

Several recipes are given for the force, also the 
cooking.

HiNTS ON CAKE MAKING. 





HINTS ON CAKE MAKING. 



Perhaps more in cake making than any other branch 
of cookery, it is essential to procure good materials. 
Poor flour, bad butter, and worse still, stale eggs, will 
spoil a cake made with the utmost care. 

First, then, see that your materials are good, and re- 
member, among other things, that good beef dripping 
will always give a more satisfactory result than bad 
butter. Lard, used alone, is not advisable in many 
cases, for cake making, though, mixed in equal quanti- 
ties with butter, answers very well in' the plainer cakes. 
Castor, or flint sugar, as it is sometimes called, is by 
far the best for all light cakes, such as sponge and layer 
cakes, while brown sugar may be used with advantage 
in any fruit cake where the flour and butter are rubbed 
together. When the butter is creamed, castor sugar 
will be found best. 

Xo\v, a few hints as to preparing the materials, cur- 
rants and sultanas should be washed in cold water, and 
thoroughly dried before using. The best way to do 
this is to put them into a colander and let water run 
through them for a few minutes, rubbing them occa- 
sionally with the hands, then allow them to drain, turn 
them on to an old cloth and take the ends and shake 
them in it. After tl: s, pick them and spread out to dry. 
When quite dry, pui „.vay in a jar ready for use. It 



220 



COOKERY. 



this is (lone when the p-occrics conic in, the fruit is 
always ready when wanted, and much time is saved. 
In any case, it is a bad ])lan to wash them just before 
usini^. as, beini^^ damp, they will in all probability sink 
t the bottom of the cake, and also tend to make ir 
he.Ti . If for any reas(jn it cannot be avoided, sprinkle 
them • idi flour before using". 

If salt butter is used, it should first be washed in cold 
water. In doing- this, keej) the butter in one piece, and 
press it well with the hand in the w^ater, so as to wash it 
all through with as little waste as possible. Put it in 
a towel and ])ress the moisture; out of it. 

In creaming butter and sugar tog^ether, the better 
way is to first cream the butter alone, then add the 
sugar, and cream again until it takes a white creamy 
appearance. A wooden spoon is the best thing to use 
for tliis jntrpose. On no account melt the butter when 
\()ur reci])e says cream it. 

In using eggs, always break them separately into a 
cup, so as to be sure that all are g^ood. 

An egg- that has no odour may generally be used, 
though it look cloudy. 

A pinch of salt added to the whites of eggs, helps 
tliem to froth more (juickly. 

It is a good ]:)lan always to prepare the tins before 
mixing the cake, as many cakes need to go into the 
oven at once. The best way to do this, is with a brush 
dipped in melted fat. 

h'or any kind of sponge cake, the tins, after buttering, 
should be sprinkled with flour and sugar mixed to- 
getlier in e(|ual (|uantities. Vov all rich cakes, the tins 
should first be buttered, then lined with buttered paper. 

leaking powder should be put in with the last quan-

Irush 

to- 
itins 
iper. 
Ltaii- 



tity of floitr, in mixtures where the butter and sugar 
are creamed ; where the butter and flour are rubbed to- 
};etlier, it is best added after the butter is rubbed in, and 
liefore the moisture is added. When the whites of egg 
are whipped to a stifif froth, less bal\ing powder is 
necessary. 

And now we come to the oven, a very important 
factor in the making of cakes. In fact, the first thing 
ihat should be thought of, for without a good oven of 
the right heat, all the labor of mixing, beating and 
whisking will be lost, and the cage a melancholy failure. 
(J)ne rule to' remember is this — the richer the cake, the 
longer it takes lo cook — consequently the oven must 
bo cooler, or the outside will be burnt and the inside 
underdone. For a large, rich mixture, put into rather 
a warm oven for the first half-hour, then cool down for 
remainder of time. Sponge and layer cakes need a mo- 
derate, steady oven. For most scones and hot cakes, 
the oven should be hot. 

An easy test to tell when all spongy cakes are suffi- 
ciently cooked, is to put the finger on the centre; if it 
feels spongy and springs into place where the finger 
touched it, it is ready. , 

Short-bread, ginger biscuits, and such cakes as 
Shrewsbury, should be cooked in rather a cool oven, 
they should be crisp all thnnigh, and nnist (jn no ac-' 
count be allowed to become too dark a brown, or the

HINTS ON SALAD MAKING. 



f, (!' 



There is little so tempting^ to eye and palate on a hot 
summer day, as a well-prepared salad, its *' cool green- 
ness " will often coax a failing appetite. Rut to make 
a salad successfully, several things must be kept in mind. 
iMrst of all, be sure the vegetables used are young 
and freshly gathered. When possible, it is best to cu't 
them in the early morning, or evening, as when cut in 
the heat, they wither quickly, and are then neither so 
pleasant or so good as a food. 

Do not allow them to remain long in water, but at 
the same time see they are quite crisp. If necessary to 
keep them for a day, or longer, put only the roots in 
water, until a litde time before using. 

All green salads require great care in washing, if the 
leaves are crushed and broken it entirely spoils their.. 
Wash in plenty of cold water, taking the leaves apart 
carefully, then '^rain on a sieve or colander, and finish 
drying by tossing lightly in a towel, for it is important 
to have the leaves dry, or the dressing will not mix 
well with them, but run with the water to the bottom 
of the dish. 

There is a Spanish proverb which savs " four persons 
are required to make a salad." A spendthrift to throw 
in the oil, a miser to throw in the vinegar, a lawyer to 
administer the seasoning, and a madman to stir the

whole toj^etluT. \W tli.'it as it may. rciiR'nibor in iiiix- 
inp^ oil and vincj^ar, at least as much as^ain oil as vine- 
gar should he taken. Thoujjfh many people still object 
to the use of oil. it really renders the salad more di- 
.qestihle and useful as a food. 

Almost all kinds of vemetahles may he utilized in this 
way. Amonfi^ the hest are tomatoes, all kinds of letUue 
and cress. aspara.i,ais, peas, heans. onions, beets, ^-auli- 
flower, celery, cucumber, radishes and parsley. To- 
matoes and celery are particularly useful, and lettuce 
is uiore or less the foundation of all .salads. 

Hard boiled ej^j;s are an improvement to many 
salads, both in appearance and taste, a little aspic jelly, 
too, may be used with good effect. There is no better 
way of using u]) cold boiled salmon, or, in fact, any kind 
of fish, than making it into a salad. Those people who 
are fortunate enough to grow their own salad, can 
with very little trouble keep up a constant supi)ly for 
the greater i)art of the year, and can tiuis, at a few min- 
utes' notice, procure a dish " lit to put before a king."

" When meat is to be pickled, it should either be put

to become tender. ' 

Ik'fore it is put into the brine, the kernels and pipes 
s!u)uld be removed, and the meat wiped with a dr\ 
cloth. It is an excellent plan to rub a little dried and 
warmed salt into the meat, and leave it until the next 
day. tlien drain it well from the slime and blood which 
will have llowed from it. then put it in the brine, which 
()Ut(ht to cover it entirely. The meat should be turned 
and rubbed every day."' It is better to cover the pan in 
which the meat is pickled.

salt may be used in place of the connnon salt, it will 
render the meat more tender. 

The saltjietre is used to make the meat a good cohjr, 
if too nnich is used it toughens the meat, and also de- 
stroys the flavor.

SANDWICHES. 



■ii. 



There is p^rcat art in preparing a sandwicli, even the 
common, everyday ham or beef sandwich, calls for 
skill. The bread must be just the right age and cut 
to a nicety, the meat sliced to a wafer-like thickness, 
and the seasoning handled with care. Then when all 
is put together, they should be fimily pressed so that 
the whole will keep together. The variety of sand- 
wiches that can be made is endless. All kinds of meat 
and fish can be used, then eggs and salad will be found 
useful. Little rolled sandwiches are particularly dainty. 
As a rule, brown bread will be found the best to use 
with fish. For instance, salmon and brown bread sand- 
wiches are delicious. A recipe for these will* be found 
below.

TO CLARII'V FAT. 



Cut up any scraps of fat, cooked or uncooked, such 
as the trinuuings from mutton cutlets, fat from a cold 
joint of meat, pieces of suet, etc. 

Remove all skin and flesh, put the pieces into a sauce- 
pan, cover with cold water, and stir over the fire until 
hoilinjT^; skim thoroup^hly, then allow it to boil with the 
lid ofT the saucepan, until all the water has evaporated 
and nothing is left of the pieces of fat but dry brown 
bits. Cool a little, then strain through a fine strainer, 
and ])ut away for use. 

This fat may be used for frying, or in place of drip- 
ping and suet. All the moisture being boiled out of it, 
it will keep almost any length oi time if put in a cool, 
dry place. It should be strained every time after fry- 
ing, and may then be used again and again. 

TO FRY IX DEEP FAT. 

i'ut enough fat in a deep pan to cover whatever is to 
l)e fried. Wait until the white smoke rises before C(Mii- 
mencing to fry. This shows the tat is the right heat, 
and will give that pretty golden brown color and plea- 
sant crispness to whatever is put into it. 

If the article fried needs longer cooking than it re- 
(juires to color, take the fat the same at first, and when 
brown enough, cool it down at once and cook ft)r time 
required. 

Fried articles should always be drained on paper be- 
fore serving.

USE OF THE CHAFING-DISH.

J 



THE USE OF THE CHAFING-DISH 



The cliafin.q-dish is so simple in operation that any- 
one possessinjL^ a very Hmited knowledge of cookery 
can use it with perfect success. Alcohol or methylated 
si)irits may be used. A little ])ractice will soon show 
how mucli is needed in the lamp for a g^iven time. 
The lamp should be closed as soon as done with. 

Some (hslics, such as oysters on toast, and those of 
like nature, are best cooked with the double pan, the 
under pan being filled with water. But when a greater 
heat is needed, as in frying meat, and so on, the whole 
heat can be used, and it is better to use the single pan 
only. 

It is perfectly wonderful how nuich may be done 
with this useful little utensil, with so little time an»l 
trouble. 

Fluid beef and meat extract will be found most use- 
ful in making sauce and gravy, as no stock is then ne- 
cessary, and a rich gravy can be made in a few 
moments. 

]\Iany other recipes in this book besides those speci- 
ally set apart for the chafing-dish, may be used. Lob- 
ster a la Nuremburg, for instance, is an excellent disli 
for the purpose: in fact, almost all dishes prepared in 
a saute pan may l)e used in the chafing-dish ; of course, 
those (juickly done are preferable. On the other hand, 
all the chafing-dish recipes may be used for an ordi- 
nary saute or fryingpan.

HINTS ON FEEDING THE S 



SICK. 



HINTS ON FEEDING THE SICK. 



Important at all times, in cases of sickness the food 
we eat becomes a matter of the very greatest import- 
ance. It has been said, " The diet of the invalid is as 
imiK)rtant as his medicine, and sometimes more so." 

The nature and preparation of food should most 
certainly form part of every nurse's traininji^, and as 
few women do not, at some time in their lives, take the 
place of a trained nurse, it would be well if all our j^irls 
were tauj^^ht at least a few principles of caring and cook- 
ing for the sick. 

The old belief that beef tea. jelly, arrowroot and port 
wine, almost filled all the patient's needs, is gradually 
passing away. These are all good enough in their 
way but none of them must be depended upon to sui)ply 
all the nourishment recjuired. 

There is nothing like eggs and milk ; cream, also, is 
very valuable, and even cheese, given in the right was', 
may be used in many cases. Wiien it can be digested 
it of course is highly nourishing. Oatmeal, too, is a 
good food. ]>ut the digestion of each patient must be 
taken into consideration. What is food to one. mav 
l)e almost poison to another. Florence Nightingale 
says : — " The main question is what the patient's stom- 
ach can derive nourishment from, and of this the pa- 
tient's stomach is the sole judge. Chemistry cannot 




:il2 



COOKKRV 



1(1! this. riie patient's stoniacli must be its own 
clioinist. 'i'hc diet which will keep the healthy man 
healthy, will kill the sick one." 

( )ne rule will almost always hold good, that is, do 
not make the food too sweet ; very few sick people care 
for nuich su^q-ar. Then do not take to(.> large a 
(piantity at once to the patient, a small portion daintily 
served will often coax the failing appetite, while a large 
l>lateful, clumsily put together, will disgust them. 
Never leave any food whatever in the sick-room, and 
in cases of infection, see that any food left by the patient 
is at once destroyed ; the best way is to burn it ; on no 
account give it to any other person. 

Ho not ask the patient what he would like for his 
next meal. Most likely he would wish for something 
(|uite impossible for him to have, and, if not, the wish 
has often passed away before it can be procured. As 
far as ])racticable, let each meal be a little surprise. If 
the same dish nuist be given again and again, at least 
try to make a change in its appearance, and. if possible, 
its flavor. 

Of course, in feeding the sick, one of the most im- 
portant things to keep in mind is, that the greatest 
amount of nutriment must be got into the smallest 
(juantity. And. perhaps the most important of all— 
obev tlie doctor's orders,

TO CLEAN l^AKING PANS. 

If tlic pans become black witli use, it is best to put 
them in a larp^e i)ot, covered witli strong soda and 
water, and allow them to boil for an hour or so. Then 
take out and rinse in clean, hot water, and polish with 
whiting. Tins treated in this way will not take a 
good polish, but if washed well in soda and water every 
time they are used, it will not be necessary. 

TO CLEAN PASTRY BOARDS, ETC. 

rirst wash the board with a flannel and hot water. 
Then rub up and down with sapolio, and scrub well, 
following the grain of the wood, this cleans it quicker 
and does not make the wood rough. Rinse well, so 
as to leave no grit. Dry with a clean cloth, and, if pos- 
sible, put in the air until quite dry. 

Washed in this way, the boards will be beautifully 
white. Xo soda must be used, or the boards will be 
a bad color. 

These rules apply to all wot)den utensils. 



OMELETTE PANS. 

Tt is most important that an omelette pan should be 
perfectly clean. Tt should not be used for any other 
purpose. Clean according to directions given for other 
pans. Then, if there is any doubt as to its being fla- 
. nred with anything, make it hot, and rub over with a 
little fat, and rub it all off again with clean paper, 
then use.

Directions for Brewing. — Place the dry Tea in 
tea-pot which has been previously warmed, and pour in 
water which has just come to boiling point. (Water which 
has been boiled before or kept boiling for some time will 
spoil the tea.) After 7 minutes' l)rewing, pour off for use. 

Quantity must be according to taste ; })ut RAM 
LAL'S being much stronger than ordinary teas, fully 
one-third less will suffice. We find, to suit the popular 
taste, that 3 teaspoonfuls of RAM LAL'S will brew 
sufficient for six persons of most delicious tea.

jePNWN'^ FIi^ID BEEF 

supplies the essential elements of PRIME BEEF in the best 
form for easy assimilation by the stomach, and hence this 
valuable food is used the world over in all cases of debility 
and weakness. 

IT STRENGTHENS. 

This is the distinguishing trait that gives it pre-emi- 
nence over Beef Extracts which only stimulate. 

Put up in 2, 4, 8 and 16 oz. tins. 

JOHNSTON'S FLUID BEEF 

with Hypophosphites. 

(BRAND STAMINAL) 

This excellent preparation combines the virtues of 
PRIME BEEF and the Tonic Hypophosphites, and is 
therefore 

A FOOD AND A TONIC. 

Put up in 2, 4, 8 and 16 oz. bottles. 

No kitchen is perfectly equipped unless supplied with 
these preparations. They are invaluable for enriching Soups 
and Gravies, as well as for making quickly, strengthening 
Beef Tea.
