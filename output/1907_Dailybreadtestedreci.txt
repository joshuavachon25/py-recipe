THE WAIL OF AN OLD-TIMER. 



We used to have old-fashioned things like hominy and greens. 
We used to have just common soup made out of pork and beans. 
But now it's bouillon, consomme, and things made from a book. 
And Pot au Feu and Julienne, since my daughter's learned to cook. 
We used to have a piece of beef — just ordinary meat. 
And pickled pig's feet, spare ribs, too, and other things to eat; 
While now it's fillet and ragout, and leg of mutton braised. 
And macoroni au gratin, and sheep's head Hollandaised. 
The good old things have passed away, in silent sad retreat; 
We've lots of high-falutin' things, but nothing much to eat. 
And whild I never say a word, and always pleasant look, 
You bet I've had dyspepsia since my daughter's learned to cook.

Skim milk is heavier than whole milk, and cream is Ughter than either, 
while pure milk is 3 per cent, heavier than water. 

The following table of proportions is also valuable. Use 

One teaspoonful soda to 1 cupful molasses. 

One teaspoonful soda to 1 pint sour milk. 

Three teaspoonfuls baking powder to 1 quart flour. 

One-half cupful of yeast or one-fourth cake compressed yeast to 1 pint 
liquid. 

One teaspoonful extract to 1 loaf plain cake. 

One teaspoonful salt to 2 quarts flour. 

One teaspoonful salt to 1 quart soup. 

One scant cupful of liquid to 3 full cupfuls of flour for bread. 

One scant cupful of liquid to 2 full cupfuls of flour for muffins. 

One scant cupful of hquid to 1 full cupful of flour for batters. 

One quart of water to each pound of meat and bone for soup stock. 

"Butter the size of an egg" is a very indefinite mode of measurement, 
and a more satisfactory way of expressing the same amount is to say "a heap- 
ing tablespoonful," or one-quarter of a cupful. 

A tablespoonful of melted butter means a tablespoonful of butter after 
melting, while a tablespoonful of butter melted, means a tablespoonful 
measured before melting. 

Sugar, salt, flour, soda, spices and mustard especially, should always be 
sifted or stirred up hghtly before measuring, as when packed they are com- 
pressed to much less than their rightful bulk for measuring. 

An even or scant teaspoonful means a spoon filled hghtly and leveled 
with a knife to the surface of the spoon, while a heaping spoonful means all 
the spoon will hold of any sifted material. In using solids, especially butter 
or lard, a knife should be employed to deftly even off the superfluous amoxint. 

An "even" cupful of anything means a cup full to the brim, so full that 
only the steadiest hand can carry it without spilhng. A "brimming" cupful, 
as its name indicates, is a cup running over. A scant cupful lacks a quarter 
or half inch of reachmg the top of the measure, while a solid cupful is some- 
thing packed as firmly as is possible. 



BREAD, ROLLS. ETC. 



"Here is bread which strengthens man's heart and is therefore 
called the staff of life." — Mathew Henry. 



YEAST. 



Boil 2 large potatoes with plenty of water; when done

MEATS 



"I cannot eat but little meat, my stomach is not good." 

— Bishop Still. 



A BEEF RUMP ROAST. 

Take 5 or 6 pounds of the upper cut of the rump (the 
only bone in it is a thin blade running nearly through it) . If 
the roast seems too large for the family dinner table, take a 
sharp knife and cut from it a slice two-thirds of an inch thick. 
I consider this the best steak in the beef. Put the roast in a 
pot with not more than a pint of boiling water. It must cook 
from three to three and one-half hours over a steady fire. 
Turn occasionally and add more boiling water as needed and 
only enough to keep from scorching. An hour before serving 
add pepper and a tablespoon of salt dissolved in a little hot 
water. One-half cup vinegar or the juice of half a lemon is 
a very great improvement. When done and the water all 
cooked away set the pot on top of stove and turn the meat to 
brown it. Make gravy as for roast meat. — Mrs. O. W. Kelly. 

BEEF TONGUE. 

When difficult to obtain a variety of meats try a nice 
large beef tongue well scrubbed and boiled very tender. Skin 
and throw back in the liquor when done. Boil down to about

gravy 2 hard boiled eggs chopped. Pour over the tongue 
and serve very hot. — Mrs. Jack Waite.

BEEFSTEAK BROILED IN A SKILLET. 

Procure a prime porter house or T-bone steak cut one 
and one-half inches thick. Carefully trim out the bone and 
cut off some of the fat. Cut through the outside edges to 
keep from curling up. Have a clear roaring hot fire and the 
skillet very, very hot. If desired, a piece of the fat may be 
rubbed over the pan to prevent sticking. Now put in your 
steak. Let it sear thoroughly over on one side, then turn 
it and sear the other side. Keep the heat just the same all 
the time, for if it cools at all, the juice will run from the meat. 
Cook it about ten minutes, turning two or three times. If 
desired well done, cook longer, but to be properly done, it 
should be pink in the middle. Just before serving, season 
with salt and pepper and put little pieces of butter on top. — 
Mrs. G. J. Wiedeman.

From time to time baste turkey with the gravy in the pan, 
rub over with larding-mop and dredge again with flour. As 
it browns, turn from side to side, and last of all brown the 
breast. When done, it should be a rich dark brown all over 
and when a fork is stuck deep into it no red juice should 
run. Remove to hot dish. If the gravy is not thick enough 
add a teaspoon of flour creamed smooth with some of the 
grease skimmed from the gravy. If, while cooking, the gravy 
boils away too much more water should be added. When the 
turkey is done there should be about a pint of gravy. The 
giblets, boiled till tender and finely chopped, may be added 
to gravy if you like. — Mrs. Donald Fowler.

pieces. Stems should be removed from the mushrooms, but 
when white cind tender may be cooked also. Melt in skillet 
a half cup of butter. Put in the mushrooms and let cook 
without a cover until the liquid which cooks out of them is 
entirely boiled away and the mushrooms are beginning to 
brown. Stir constantly now until well browned, then sift 
over them 2 heaping tablespoons of flour, stirring till the flour 
is browned when one and one-half cups of milk should be 
stirred in gradually and allowed to boil to the thickness of 
chicken gravy. The butter will furnish sufficient salt. About 
thirty minutes is required for preparing mushrooms in this 
way. — Mrs. A. Pfaus.

drippings in your frying pan; stick 4 or 5 cloves into a medium 
sized onion and brown. Wash and drain i teacup of rice and 
brown slightly in hot fat with onion, stirring constantly. Pour

shape if not stirred. — Mrs. Mary Weistaner. 

POTATO NOODLES. 

Grate cold boiled potatoes, add one-half cup sweet milk, 
I beaten egg, season with salt to suit, flour to make stiff. Take 
enough dough the size of a walnut, mould with the hands on 
the baking board until it is rolled out about a finger length 
and about as thick; use flour enough to keep from sticking. 
Cook about twenty minutes in boiling water with a little salt 
in it. Skim out on a platter and keep hot; brown small pieces 
of bread in hot butter, put over the noodles. Beat 3 eggs 
and throw over all while hot, this will cook the eggs, suffi- 
ciently. Excellent. — Mrs. A. D. Myers.

one-half teacups flour, or a little more, and a saltspoon of 
salt until you have quite a stiff dough. Flour your pastry 
board well, lay the dough upon it and roll out until the sheet 
is as thin as paper. Fold this sheet over and over, just as you 
would roll a jelly roll and then with a sharp knife cut off 
strips of the dougli about one-eighth of an inch wide. Shake 
these out and they will unroll. Lay them lightly on a tray 
or platter to dry. Boil for fifteen minutes in salted boiling 
water. Serve with crustades or bread crumbs browned in

SALADS 



"We are such stuff as dreams are made of.' 



When mixing an ordinary French dressing it is better to 
stir the salt and pepper and other seasonings into the vinegar, 
instead of into the oil. If the salt is mixed with the oil, as 
is so often the case, it will not melt and will make the salad 
gritty. 

A plain lettuce salad is improved if a small bit of onion 
is added. A French cook would rub the salad bowl with a 
bit of garlic or toss a single clove of garlic in his lettuce before 
sending to the table. A teaspoonful of tarragon or chives 
also makes a delicious addition.

ICE CREAM 



"Enoughl Enough! what is Enough? a little more!" 



As to ice creams, nothing is so easily prepared as a parfait 
or mousse, since these are not put into the freezer, but into a 
pail packed in ice and salt. The simplest is merely whipped 
cream, sweetened and flavored, with or without a border of 
lady fingers around the edge. Another is called angel par- 
fait, and is made by cooking a cup of sugar with a cup of water 
till it threads; this is slowly beaten into the stiff whites of 3 
eggs, and this in turn, when cold, into a pint of whipped cream, 
flavored. This is something like the mousse which is made 
by dissolving a tablespoonful of gelatine in a quarter of a cup 
of water, adding a small cup of sugar, a pinch of salt, and 
strain slowly into a pint of whipped and flavored cream. 
All these must stand in ice and salt for five hours. 

ICE CREAM. 

One quart of cream, 2 cups of sugar, 2 tablespoons of 
vanilla or any flavoring. Place half the cream and sugar 
together, put in a farina kettle, stir continually and bring to

of the cream and the flavoring, sugar and freeze. One quart 
of cream wiU more than double in bulk when frozen. — Mrs. 
Lottie Maxwell. 

CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM.

and beaten whites of eggs. Little lemon or vaniUa flavor. —

When it begins to set add a quart of rich cream, half of it well 
whipped. When well frozen put a layer in bottom of each 
mould. Then pack moulds in ice and make white ice cream:

172 DAILY BREAD 



2 eggs and tablespoon vanilla. When frozen add layer to 
chocolate and pack again. Now make pink icecream:. Add 
tablespoon fruit coloring to frozen white ice cream and stir 
thoroughly. Now add pink layer to brown and white in moulds 
and pack moulds in ice again. Will be ready to use in three 
hours. Will make about i gallon. Instead of white ice cream 
I sometimes use pineapple ice: One can pineapple, fill can 
with water, juice 3 lemons, 2 cups sugar, whites 2 eggs. In- 
stead of pink ice cream I sometimes use sti-awberry ice : Mash 
I quart of strawberries, add half pint sugar and juice of 2 lem-

cool. Mix this with strawberries. Turn into freezer and stir

one hour — stirring from time to time. Freeze. This makes 
an excellent ice by using i and one-half pints of water instead 
of I and one-half quarts and adding when partly frozen the 
beaten whites of 2 eggs. Can also be used with currants, 
cherries, etc. When making preserves in the summer any 
superfluous syrup from the fruit may be bottled and put in 
a dark place and serves well in preparing ices, sherbets and 
creams. — Mrs. A. W. Warr.

DIET FOR THE SICK 



Surroundings and the circumstances under which food is 
taken often have much to do with the comfort of the sick one; 
the odor of cooking and the noise of the preparation should 
be kept as far from the sick room as possible. Do not ask 
the invalid each time beforehand what she would like to eat, 
but serve what you know is wholesome and nourishing in a 
dainty and tempting manner; it is often the unexpected which 
pleases most. There are times when the invalid may seem 
too ill to notice details, when, perhaps, she is only too ill to 
speak of them. A fastidious or nervous person may have 
the desire for food completely destroyed by a little too much, 
or a suspicion of grease on the broth. Untasted food, dishes 
that have been used, cups or glasses, ought not to be left 
standing about the sick room. Never serve milk, egg^, butter 
or fish if there is the least suspicion of their absolute freshness. 

In order to have all food served to an invalid as tempt- 
ing as possible, the linen, china, glass and silver should be the 
very nicest and prettiest in the house. A bright, fresh flower 
laid on the folded napkin; the chop or piece of steak orna- 
mented with parsley; the hot food served very hot, and the 
cold articles very cold — will do much in pleasing the delicate, 
sensitive taste of an invalid. 

Have all cups and saucers hot when used for toast, tea, 
coffee, etc. Hot-water plates are very convenient, but when 
they cannot be procured, put the food you wish to keep hot 
over a bowl of boiling water, and cover the plate with a hot 
saucer, fold a napkin around the baked potato, and, though 
you carry your tray from the basement to the top of the house, 
it will reach the sick-room nice and hot. Never fill a bowl 
so full that it will spill its contents over into the saucer or on 
the linen. Have aU fruit cold, especially oranges and grapes.

BEEF TEA MADE QUICKLY. 

One-half pound raw meat cut in small pieces. Put on 
pan and stir over fire until seared aU over. Then put in fruit 
press and squeeze out all juice. Add little salt. — Mrs. F. E. 
Wright. 

BEEF TEA. 

Broth made of beef is a very agreeable form of liquid 
diet, but it is less nutritious than when made from chicken or 
mutton. Cut up a pound of beef from the round into pieces 
the size of dice. Put into a covered jar, with 2 pints of cold 
water and a pinch or two of salt. Let the beef soak in the 
water, stirring occasionally, for two hours; then put it on the 
range, and heat it gradually uritil the red color disappears. 
Be very careful that it does not reach the boiling point. Skim, 
off all grease, and serve hot with a little very brown toast. 

BEEF TEA WITH OATMEAL. 

This forms a very nutritious gruel. Take 2 tablespoonfuls 
of cooked oatmeal and 2 of cold water, and mix them thor- 
oughly; then add i pint of good beef tea which has been 
brought to the boiling-point. Boil together for five minutes 
and strain through a fine sieve. 

INDIAN-MEAL GRUEL. 

Indian meal is very digestible and nutritious. To l pint

Let it stand until cold. Flavor if required. 

BOILED LEMONADE. 

Take the juice of I large lemon, and strain it into a jar; 
add about one-third of the rind cut very thin and 4 or 5 pieces 
of lump sugar. Pour over this 1 pint of boiling water, and 
let it stand for 2 hours covered closely. Strain and serve 
cold. 

EGG LEMONADE. 

This is a very pleasant way of serving the raw white of 
an egg to an invalid. To the white of i egg add i tablespoon- 
ful of powdered sugar, juice of i lemon, and i glass of water. 
Beat thoroughly, and serve nice and cold. 

■J EGGNOG. X 

One egg beaten separately, I teaspoonful of white sugar, 
I tablespoonful of sherry or brandy, one-half glass of milk, ice.

little of the milk, and 4 or 5 small pieces of ice; beat the mix- 
ture well together, add the brandy and the rest of the rrulk 
and the beaten white of the egg, with the exception of i tea- 
spoonful with which to ornament the top. This should make

To one-half cvip of flaxseed add i quart of boiling water. 
Boil one-half hour, and let it stand twenty minutes on the 
back of the range. Strain, sweeten to taste, and add a little 
lemon juice. 

TOAST. 

Toast is a digestible form of food for the invalid either 
dry or buttered. Milk-toast is also a verj' nutritious combi- 
nation. Invalids wiU often take milk in the form of milk- 
toast who would be unwilling to take it in any other way. 

DRY TOAST. 

Baker's bread is always best for toast. The slices should 
be cut very even, and about one-half inch thick. Place it in 
the oven for a few minutes, then toast over a bright, clear 
fire until nice and brown on both sides; be sure that it is 
evenly browned. Remo.ve the crusts so as to have the slices 
shapely, cut them triangular, diamond shape, or in long, 
narrow strips. 

BUTTERED TOAST. 

Toast the bread in the same way as for dry toast; spread 
it as soon as toasted, with a little butter. Never let large 
pieces of butter soak into the toast. 

MILK-TOAST. 

For I slice of toast heat three-fourths of a cup of milk 
to the ■ boiling point, add a little salt and a small piece of 
butter. Thicken the milk with one-half teaspoonful of corn- 
starch; stir well, and boil for five minutes. Place the toast 
in a hot dish, and pour the milk over it. Serve hot.

PANADA. 

Toast 6 milk-crackers; butter, and sprinkle a little salt 
over each one, and place them in a soup-plate. Pour care- 
fully at-one side of the dish as much as it will hold of hot water. 
When the crackers are soaked through place another plate 
over the crackers, and by tipping the two plates together 
pour off all the water. Slip the crackers on to a hot plate, 
and pour over them a little sweet cream; set in the oven for a 
motuent, and serve. 

VEAL BROTH. 

To I pound of knuckle of veal add i pint of water, a little 
salt; boil slowly for two hours but do not reduce the quantity 
of the broth; strain, cool, and skim off fat. This may be 
thickened, and its nutritive value increased by adding a little 
barley or rice. 

OYSTER BROTH. 

Oysters or clams when fresh, eaten raw or properly cooked, 
are an excellent food for invalids. To i pint of white stock 
add I cupful of oysters; bring to a boil, season with a little 
pepper and salt, and serve with hot crackers. This is very 
nice for those who object to milk. 



SCRAPED BEEF. 

Scraped beef is often recomxaended for invalids suffering 
from chronic gastritis, typhoid convalescents, and others. 
It is best when made from tender beefsteak broiled for a few 
minutes over a bright, clear fire. Rare roast -beef or mutton 
chop may also be used. Scrape with the edge of a spoon 
until the space scraped has no meat on the surface but only 
the white fibre; cut this off with a sharp knife, exposing another 
fresh surface. The pulp may be passed through a sieve, al- 
though this is not absolutely necessary. Season it and 
spread it on thin shces of bread and butter; or it may be made 
into little cakes and browned slightly. 



264 DAILY BREAD 



MUTTON BROTH. 

. Mutton broth is very wholesome and suitable for the 
invalid; it is often given in typhoid and other fevers. Take 
I pound of mutton from the neck, wash thoroughljr, add i 
pint of cold water and a little salt, and I teaspoonful of barley. 
Boil slowly for two hours, or until the meat is ready to fall 
from the bones. Strain out all the meat, etc., cool and skin 
off the fat. 

CHICKEN BROTH. 

This is a nutritious form of liquid diet. It is best when 
made from an old fowl. Wash and clean thoroughly, dissect 
joints, and chop all into small pieces. Put it on the range 
in cold water, i quart to a pound of fowl; let it heat slowly, 
then boil gently until the meat is -ready to fall from the bones; 
strain, skim and add rice; boil once more for half an hour. 
Season to taste and serve hot with toasted or hot crackers. 

OYSTER BROTH WITH MILK. 

Put equal quantities of oyster juice and milk on the range 
in separate vessels; when the juice comes to a boil, skim, and 
slightly thicken, then pour in the milk boiling hot, and add the 
oysters one by one. Let them remain on the range until the 
edges ruffle. 

OATMEAL GRUEL. 

Oatmeal when properly prepared is very nutritious. 
For most people, however, especially those with delicate 
digestive powers, oatmeal should be so thoroughly cooked 
that while hot it can be easily poured, and on cooling it should 
form a soft jelly. Oatmeal gruel is prepared by taking 2 
large tablespoonfuls of well-cooked oatmeal, adding i cupful 
of boiling water with a little salt, slowly stirring all the time, 
then adding I cupful of good, rich milk. Let all boil for ten 
minutes, and strain through a fine wire sieve. If you have 
no cooked oatmeal put one-half cup raw oatmeal into a double 
boiler, with 2 cupfuls of boiling water, and cook for three hours.

ALLOWANCE OF SUPPLIES FOR AN

In inviting guests it is safe to calculate that out of one 
hundred and fifty, but two-thirds of the number will be pres- 
ent. Allow I quart of oysters to every 3 persons present, 

5 chickens (or what is better, a 10 pound turkey, boiled) and 
15 heads of celery are enough for chicken salad for 50 guests. 
One hundred and thirty sandwiches for a hundred people and 

6 to 10 quarts of lemon jelly for each hundred. For a com- 
pany of 20, allow 3 chickens for salad, a gallon of ice cream 
and 4 dozen rolls. 

One can of deviled crab will serve about 7. One can of 
shrimp, with celery, 5, no more; i and three-quarter pounds of

one-half (quarts for 30 persons, and I pound of coffee, which 
will make 5 or 6 quarts, for 25 persons. 

In purchasing beef for beef essence or tea for an invalid, 
have it cut from the top of the round or middle of the rump, 
as these contain the most and best flavored juice. 

Don't use an egg until it has been laid ten hours, as the

ples is in a pan, using a baking powder can for a chopper. 

TO KEEP EGGS.. 

Put bran in oven till perfectly dry. Put a little fresh 
lard in the palm of the hand and rub each egg all over with 
it. Then pack in layers in little kegs or wooden boxes, first 
a layer of bran, then a layer of eggs, little end down and avoid 
letting them touch each other. So on till box is filled, having 
bran last. Keep covered and in a cool place. — Mrs. Jane 
Ketcham. 

In case of sickness you may replenish the fire without 
disturbing a sleeping or nervous patient. Put a couple of 
shovels full of coal in several thicknesses of paper. Gather 
the comers together and carefully lay on the fire. 

Put vegetables for soup through the food chopper — it is 
quicker and easier than slicing.

Try putting a thimble on the end of the rod wHen you 
run it through the hem of your sash curtains. 

To remove iron-rust: Stir salt into lemon juice, thor- 
oughly wet stain and put in sun. May require two applica- 
tions. 

When preparing celery for the table, dry and pulverize 
the unbleached stalks, leaves and the roots for seasoning soups, 
etc. I think you will like it better than celery salt. 

Save your left-over sweet pickle vinegar and use it in 
your mince meat. 

One level teaspoon of soda and 2 of cream tartar equal 
2 rounded teaspoons of baking powder. 

To remove grass stains, grease in lard, let lie over night 
and next morning wash out easily in luke warm water and 
soap. Goods with sticky fly paper on, sponge with wood alcohol. 
Also if not bad, take heavy manilla brown paper and a warm 
iron. 

Make a three cornered pad from several thicknesses of 
old blanket or table padding, cover with a man's old pocket 
handkerchief, (which can be easily removed and washed), 
sew a loop of tape to one corner, and hang it to ironing bpard. 
This will be found convenient to slip under the embroidered 
monograms on table linen or any bit of hand embroidery on 
garments, and they look so much better when ironed over a 
heavy pad. 

We prepare for fire in this way: Take twenty pounds of 
nitrate of ammonia, place in twenty gallons of salt water,' 
dissolve the salt and then it is ready to bottle in thin glass 
bottles holding a quart. They must be well corked and 
sealed. They are fine hand grenades. They should be thrown 
in the edge of the fire with force enovigh to break the bottle, 
and let the gases escape to put the fire out. 

Never re-heat mushrooms or dishes containing them, as 
after they have become cold they are apt to develop injurious 
properities and become a dangerous food; therefore, consume 
what mushrooms you cook at once, or throw them away. 

A little salt and vinegar mixed together is splendid for 
cleansing the inside of water bottles, etc.

If citron becomes too hard to cut let it stand a few minu- 
tes in boiling water, then wipe dry with a cloth. 

There is nothing nicer to keep a cook stove clean than 
old newspapers. A stove blackened once a week and then 
rubbed each morning with newspapers will look clean and 
bright all the week. 

Use soda, a small quantity in sour cream or milk, and 
then use baking powder in the flour and there will be no trou- 
ble in having one's cooking spoiled with too much soda. 

To remove paint from window glass, wet the glass and 
lay a coin flat upon it and rub around. This will remove all 
specks of paint. Care should be taken to use a smooth coin, 
otherwse the glass may be scratched. 

To remove paint from cloth, wet with kerosene oil or 
rub lard on the spot before washing. 

Instead of rolling dry bre&d for crumbs grind it in your 
meat chopper and save work. 

Also use it for grating horseradish and save tears. 

Butter slightly the edge of the cream pitcher to prevent 
the cream from dripping on the tablecloth. 

If you prefer to bake your paste first for lemon pies, fill it 
with a soft mass of tissue paper and see how nicely it will keep 
its shape. Remove paper when nearly baked. Or, better 
stiQ, bake the crust on the outside of the tin after being well 
pricked with a fork. 

Pull up in the fall a big bunch of parsley, wash carefully 
and hang back of stove until leaves are dry and you will have 
parsley for soups and sauces all winter. 

If you happen to bum your cake, rub off the burned part 
with a coarse grater. 

KEROSENE OIL. 

A few drops added to the boiled starch will make iron- 
ing easier. 

Dip the fingers in the oil and rub the throat to give relief 
from sore throat. 

Saturate a cloth in the oil and rub the rollers to clean a 
clothes wringer quickly. 



DAILY BREAD 273 



A few drops added to the water with which windows are 
to be washed, will save time and labor. 

To keep sinks and wash basins clean, wet a small cloth in 
kerosene and rub over, then wash with soap and water. This 
also applies to bath tubs, or zinc covered tables. 

Use gasoline in the following manner to clean goods: 
Put boiling water into a large pan, set the basin containing 
the gasoline into this and by warming the gasoline it will be 
much more agreeable to use and will clean better. If possible 
dip the article to be cleaned into the gasoline as if washing 
with water, using soap in connection for soiled spots, otherwise 
moisten a cloth with it and rub the spots, but in this case do 
not pour it out of the bottle, as it evaporates very quickly. 
It is best to work out of doors, for it carmot be used near an 
open fire or light without danger of an explosion. When a 
ring remains around a spot cleaned with gasoline, it can be 
removed by steaming same over teakettle. 

Before placing a dish on the fire rub it with lard or grease 
so that the soot will wash off easily. 

If your Oxford shoes slip up and down at the heel, glue 
a piece of velvet in the heel of the shoe, about two inches by 
three and a half, and you will discover no more holes in your 
hose from the slipping shoe wear. 

Rub the inside of ticks which are used for feathers with 
beeswax and they cannot work out* 

To quickly remove ink stains from any fabric, place the 
stain over steam and apply salt and lemon juice. The stain, 
whether old or new, will be removed almost immediately. 

When stitching thin sUks, chiffon, muslin, or any other 
material which easily puckers in the stitching, place a strip of 
heavy paper under the seam and you will have a perfectly 
smooth seam. The needle cuts the paper, so that it readily 
pulls away from the stitching. 

To remove blood from cloth, make a paste of starch with 
cold water, apply and place in the sun and when dry it will 
rub off. If there is any particle of color left, repeat.

If jeUy to be used on cakes or tarts is first beaten it will 
spread much easier. 

To gather on a sewing machine, loosen the tension and 
lengthen the stitch. Then stitch, and you can then draw the 
upper thread and adjust the gathers as needed.
