PREFACE 

While many things contribute to health, — sleep, fresh 
air, and exercise, for instance, — the foremost considera- 
tion is food. This is recognized to-day as never before, 
and those who regard their own welfare and desire to 
give their children the best possible equipment for the 
stress of modern life are asking how to choose food 
wisely. So many kinds of food are displayed in our 
markets, and so many placards offer warning or advice 
about what to eat, that a guidebook to good nutrition 
would seem quite essential for the twentieth century 
family. The purpose of the author has been to provide 
such a little book for the numerous housewives who pre- 
pare something like a thousand meals a year for their 
families and who wish to know how the science of 
nutrition can be made to function most successfully in 
their daily lives. 

Much literature has been published in regard to food 
and diet, but it is not a simple matter to collect and 
organize it for one's own use in the midst of all the 
cares of a household. In the present volume separate 
chapters are devoted to the special food needs of the 
different members of a typical family group — babies, 
growing children, adult men and women, aged persons — 
after which some space is devoted to a consideration of 
the food problems related to the family group as a whole. 



VI PREFACE 

Among the latter are such points as the construction of 
daily menus on a rational basis, the wise expenditure of 
money for food, and reasonable control of the amount 
and kinds of food consumed. Since it is an unfortunate 
fact that the housewife is often called upon to feed the 
sick, a chapter upon this topic has been included. There 
has been no attempt to make this comprehensive or 
detailed, because the sick should be fed under a phy- 
sician's guidance. The writer believes, however, that 
the home feeding of the sick will be more successful if 
intelligently done, and that a few printed suggestions 
will be helpful in carrying out the physician's orders. 

Detailed calculations of the amount of food to be 
consumed each day are neither necessary nor practicable 
in the home, but some information in regard to the rela- 
tive nutritive value of food materials is a great help in 
keeping the diet well balanced. For the sake of those 
who wish to study this phase of feeding, illustrative 
dietaries have been placed in each chapter, and in 
the Appendix tables given for quick estimation of 
the food values of a number of familiar kinds of food. 
These are expressed in terms of ordinary household 
measures (cups, tablespoons, teaspoons) and are as 
accurate as possible with such units of measurement 
applied to materials tending to vary considerably in 
their composition. The housewife does not need to do 
careful weighing so much as to train her eye to judge 
approximate food values, for which measures are usually 
sufficient, though weights are of course more accurate. 
The " dietary recipes " have been given because recipes 
vary so much that the name of a dish does not always 



PREFACE va 

give a clue to its exact composition. Often several 
recipes for the same type of dish have been given, to 
show how the food value will vary with changes in the 
ingredients. 

The author wishes to acknowledge with thanks the 
valuable advice and criticism given by Professor Henry 
C. Sherman of Columbia University and the assistance 
of Miss Esther Swartz in the preparation of the manu- 
script.

FEEDING THE FAMILY 

CHAPTER I 
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 

Introduction 

" What shall we have for dinner? " This is the con- 
stant cry of the housewife, who often feels that house- 
keeping would be relieved of one of its greatest bugbears 
if some one else would undertake the planning of the meals. 
And yet this is a burden not so easily shifted from her 
shoulders. Menus may be written for her, but they 
seldom fulfill her requirements exactly as they stand. 
The foods designated are not in the market, or the 
family does not Hke them, or there are leftovers to be 
disposed of, and the problem remains unsolved. In 
fact, the one who is intrusted with the feeding of the 
family has a responsibility not lightly escaped. Of 
the three necessities of Hfe which the home must pro- 
vide, — food, clothing, and shelter, — food is the most 
important. Without it, life is impossible. With scanty 
provision of it, growth is stunted and energy fails. 
With abundance, one may stuff the furnace until the 
fires of life are dulled by sheer surplus of good fuel. By 
indiscreet choice, precious days of life may be lost on 



2 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

account of headache or other acute, though minor, ills, 
and by continued bad feeding the way paved for serious 
impairment of health. For food most people spend the 
largest part of their incomes. What a pity if they buy 
sickness instead of health ! 

While it is true indeed that " the life is more than 
meat," it is equally true that there is no life of the 
spirit without sustenance for the body. The welfare 
of the family, both physical and spiritual, is largely 
in the hands of the one who provides the " three meals 
a day " which often seem so appalling in their inevi- 
tabiUty. The only way of relief is through mastery 
of the principles which underlie the daily choice of 
meals. "What shall we have for dinner?" does not 
imply choice between nothing and something, as under 
the precarious conditions of primitive Ufe or the equally 
uncertain chances of extreme poverty. It indicates 
rather bewilderment amidst a wealth of materials for 
man's delectation such as the world has never seen 
before. If only half a dozen foods were available, the 
matter would be quickly settled. The question is apt 
to mean. What new foods can be found to delight the 
palate or charm the eye of those who are never really 
hungry ? Eating is a social custom as well as a physio- 
logical necessity, and the hostess, even at a table of- 
two, is disturbed, votes her dinner a failure and her 
efforts wasted if her partner does not partake freely. 
What she may really need is more skill in divining 
his physiological requirements, rather than in preparing 
dainty dishes to pamper his appetite. 



THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 3 

Many traditions have grown up about foods, preju- 
dices against this and that, rooted in ancient tribal or 
religious taboos, or the results of misinterpreted experi- 
ences ; thus some men have called meat, the sign of the 
chase, the means of producing warlike qualities in human 
beings, attributing to meat eating "all evil passions 
and all vain behef — the germs of misery, death, dis- 
ease, and crime," and others have devoted their best 
energies to convincing the world that "an exclusively 
farinaceous and fruit diet is best adapted to the develop- 
ment and improvement of all powers of body, mind, and 
soul." The occult powers of the moon are no greater 
than the reputed magic of all sorts of foods. Many a 
little girl has patiently eaten dry bread crusts to make 
her hair curl; many a man counted on meat to make 
strong muscles or fish to develop his brain power ! 

In the light of modern scientific research these tradi- 
tions give way to exact knowledge of what food does for 
the body and how it does it. By patient steps, through 
Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood; 
Priestly and Scheele's discovery of oxygen; Lavoisier's 
brilliant insight into the relation between the intake of 
oxygen into the body in respiration, the output of car- 
bon dioxide from the lungs, and the evolution of heat 
and work in the body ; Liebig's study of the composition 
of foods and body materials; Pettenkofer and Voit's 
demonstration of the possibility of measuring the heat 
given off and work done by the body; and Rubner's 
accurate researches estabUshing definite relationship 
between food consumption and body activity, — through 



4 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

the work of these and other able investigators, we have 
come to the realization that nutrition is science rather 
than a bundle of old wives' rules ; that foods, though so 
numerous and so varied in form, can be reduced to rather 
simple terms ; that the amount required by a man for a 
day's work can be determined with amazing accuracy; 
and that even the factors which govern so obscure an 
impulse as the power to grow can be analyzed and a 
young animal made to grow or stunted at will by the 
control of its food. 

Scientists in many laboratories are studying the laws 
which govern nutrition, and as they progress in knowl- 
edge the housewife is given new standards by which to 
choose the food for the family, and greatly increased 
ability to secure physical welfare for the group in her 
care. She is also reUeved of old and fooKsh fears about 
the baleful influence of this or that particular food, and 
turns a deaf ear to alarmists and faddists, who by juggling 
with technical terms often put good foods into disrepute. 
Meals of many kinds are found to be good and sim- 
plicity may be cultivated without fear of malnutrition. 

The Body a Working Machine 

In considering the part which food plays in human 
life, the most important conception which modern science 
has given us is that of the body as a working machine, 
whose output we can measure as accurately as that of 
any steam, gasoHne, or electric engine. Unlike other 
machines, this living one must work to exist. Man is 
to be compared to a clock, going all the time, rather 



THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 5 

than to an automobile engine, working only at intervals. 
When lying asleep or perfectly quiet, the heart is doing 
its work, which, counted for a whole day, will amount 
to as much as lifting an average man some 2500 feet 
into the air; the chest is moving in respiration; the 
muscles are under tension ready for any sudden call to 
further work ; the digestive tract is busy, caring for the 
last meal, or if that is gone, possibly by vigorous move- 
ment calling Hke OUver Twist for ' ' more. " Every move- 
ment, voluntary or involuntary, even to winking an eye, 
is work in the mechanical sense; and exercise which 
brings many muscles into play, whether in digging a 
ditch or playing football, sweeping a room or flitting 
over a tennis court, adds to the energy expended in 
proportion to its severity. 

Fuel for the Human Machine 

In order to have energy to spend as outlined above, 
we must first acquire it. But how? The earth's great 
bank of energy is the sun ; its currency is light and heat. 
These man cannot "cash in" directly. They have to 
go through a great clearing house, the plant world, 
before they become available for the human economy. 
Plant cells transmute light and heat into chemical energy 
and bind this with elements from the air and soil to 
make three great classes of energy-bearing substances, 
which man can use for his activities, known as protein, 
fat, and carbohydrate. These are the "fuels" which 
supply energy for the human machine. This energy of 
food may be converted into useful work — inside the 



6 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

body in keeping up the life processes, outside in per- 
forming all sorts of muscular movement — and also into 
heat to maintain body temperature. In fact, heat is a 
by-product of all bodily activities, which is turned to 
good account in keeping warm. If not enough is obtain- 
able in this way, the transformation of more energy into 
heat can be brought about by doing more work (shiver- 
ing, clapping the hands, stamping about, running, etc.) ; 
or if this is not done, by the automatic response of in- 
ternal processes to the stimulus of cold, increasing the 
rate at which body fuel is burned. Since the three fuel 
foodstuffs are so essential to man's well-being, it be- 
hooves us to inquire how they may be obtained. 

Sources of Body Fuel 

The three substances which serve as body fuel, pro- 
tein, fat, and carbohydrate, are found variously distributed 
in all kinds of vegetable food. From the juice of the 
beet and sugar cane we refine a pure carbohydrate, 
sugar, which is also found in the juice of sweet fruits and 
vegetables, such as oranges, grapes, apples, corn, peas, 
etc. From wheat, oats, corn, and other grains, potato 
tubers, manioc roots (tapioca), we secure another form 
of pure carbohydrate, starch, which is also found in lesser 
amounts in many kinds of fruit and vegetables, as 
bananas, peas, beans, nuts (especially chestnuts). 

From olives, cottonseed, peanuts, cocoa beans, and 
other seeds we can obtain pure fat, which we find plenti- 
ful in nuts, but only in small amounts in other kinds of 
vegetable food. 



THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 7 

The vegetable foods which have the largest amounts 
of protein are the legumes, — peas, beans, lentils, and pea- 
nuts. Nuts such as almonds, filberts, walnuts, pecans, 
have also a considerable store. Next in importance come 
the cereals, with oats, wheat, and corn heading the Ust. 
Other vegetable foods contribute comparatively small 
amounts of this sort of fuel. 

Plant foods may be called the original source of human 
energy. But animals, eating the plants, may work over 
the protein, fat, and carbohydrate of their plant food in 
their internal laboratories, the living cells, and produce 
animal protein from the vegetable protein, animal fat 
from the vegetable carbohydrate or fat, and animal car- 
bohydrates from any one of these three, but especially 
from the carbohydrates. These new forms, elaborated 
in the animal body, also serve man for fuel. In animal 
food as he eats it there is little carbohydrate, except in 
milk, though scallops, oysters, and clams are perhaps 
worthy of mention. Fat is found more or less inti- 
mately associated with lean in all kinds of meat, 
about the leanest animal food being codfish. Milk 
is often prized most for its fat, in the form of cream 
or butter, and bacon also offers fat in a very acceptable 
form. 

Strictly lean meat affords fuel in the form of protein, 
whatever the animal from which it is derived. From 
bones we get gelatin, also pure protein, though not in 
all respects equivalent to that of meat. Milk and eggs 
are particularly valuable for their protein content. 
Cheese consists chiefly of the protein from milk, with 



8

or without the fat according to variety. Egg white has 
all its fuel in the form of protein, while the yolk has it 
partly as protein and partly as fat.^ 

Measurement of the Fuel Value of Food 

Food materials differ greatly in the amount of pro- 
tein, fat, and carbohydrate which they may con- 
tain. Some, as has been noted, have only one kind of 

I

fuel, some two, and some all three, and these in varying 
proportions. It is, nevertheless, a comparatively simple 
matter to find out how much energy (or working power) 
a given kind of food is capable of yielding in the body. 

^ For further information on the kind and relative amounts of protein, 
fat, and carbohydrate in diflferent food materials, the reader is referred 
to Tables I, II, and III, of the Appendix, to Sherman's Food Products, 
Rose's Laboratory Handbook for Dietetics, or to Chemical Composition 
oj American Food Materials, Bulletin 28, Office of Experiment Stations, 
U. S. Dept. of Agriculture. 



THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 9 

The chemical processes by which energy is liberated are 
of the same nature as burning outside the body. If we 
take some kind of food, then, as a lump of sugar, and 
burn it under such conditions as to make the process 
complete and to measure all the heat generated, we can 
express this heat in terms of a standard unit of measure- 
ment, called the Calorie.^ A special piece of apparatus 
is used in food laboratories which fulfills all the require- 
ments for measuring the fuel value of food ; it is called 
a calorimeter. The food is burned in an atmosphere of 
pure oxygen in a gas-tight chamber or ''bomb," and the 
heat is taken up in water surrounding the bomb, the 
change in temperature of the water showing the amount 
of heat liberated. 

In reckoning the fuel value of food, we have to consider 
whether it will be burned as completely in the body as 
in the calorimeter and one of the tasks of the nutrition 
laboratories has been to discover the losses due to im- 
perfect utilization of food materials. From hundreds of 
digestion experiments we have learned how to correct 
the calorimeter returns for the healthy person on a mixed 
diet and can say in general that an ounce of pure carbo- 
hydrate or pure protein will yield 113 Calories to the 
body; an ounce of fat, 255 Calories. 

But, as we have seen,^ most of our foods are mixtures 
of these substances in varying proportions, and almost 
always we find associated with the energy-yielding sub-

grade or I pound of water 4° Fahrenheit.

stances water and salts, very valuable in the diet for 
other reasons, but not sources of energy; also plant 
fiber or cellulose, a form of carbohydrate which the body 
cannot use for fuel but which makes valuable ballast 
for the digestive tract. We may say, then, that the 
more water and cellulose a given food contains the lower 
its fuel value for a given weight will be. Thus the fuel 
value of pure sugar is 1814 Calories per pound ; that of 
grape juice, which as regards fuel is practically a dilute 
solution of sugar, is only 454 Calories per pound ; while 
that of tomatoes, which are largely water and cellulose, 
is but 103 Calories per pound. Pure proteins and car- 
bohydrates have the same fuel value per pound in the 
body, but pure fat has two and one-fourth times as high 
an energy value; hence the more fat a food contains, 
the higher its energy value in proportion to its weight. 

Some differences in fuel values of various foods, 
when compared by weight, are brought out in the fol- 
lowing tables, in which the foods are grouped according 
to the foodstuff which predominates in them :

From such, tables it is easy to see that we could scarcely 
depend upon celery or lettuce for our daily fuel supply, 
as it would be hard to eat even a single pound in one day 
and a man would require over 25 pounds. It is also evi- 
dent that some foods are cheaper fuel than others, bread at 
6f cents a pound being nearly 20 times as cheap fuel as 
oysters at 2 5 cents a pound. In everyday life, however, we

do not eat foods by the pound, but by the serving. When 
we sit down to the table and the host serves the meat, we 
should like to be able to tell how much energy he is pass- 
ing us. When the dessert comes in, we should need men- 
tal agility indeed to translate pounds of eggs, flour, sugar, 
and cream into ice cream and cake. A better unit for this 
purpose is the amount of food required to yield 100 Calo- 
ries, which corresponds quite closely to the ordinary serv- 
ing of a number of foods. The following table shows how 
convenient a unit this is for practical purposes.^

Measurement of the Fuel Requirements of the Body 

Food is fuel for the human machine, but how shall 
we know how much to supply? Ordinarily we trust to 
appetite, and ati unperverted appetite is a very useful 
guide to rational eating. If an adult year in and year 
out maintains a uniform normal weight, we may assume 
that his food supply is adjusted to his needs. If a child 
makes healthy, steady gains in weight throughout the 
period of growth, a study of the food which he con- 
sumes will give us a good clue as to his actual needs. 
But all adults do not maintain normal weight; some 
are too thin and many are too fat; all children do not 
make normal gains in weight; appetite is too great or 
too Uttle or too pampered ; and we need accurate meas- 
urement by scientific methods of the real fuel needs of 
the body to serve as a check on appetite or as a guide 
when appetite fails. Before it was realized that the 
energy in food must be proportioned to the body's 
energy expenditure, it was the custom to feed invalids 
very largely on beef tea and other broths with Uttle fuel 
value. No matter how quietly they lay in bed, the 
internal work of their bodies had to go on, which means 
that fuel was still being burned ; only in this case little 
of it came from food, and most of it from stores of fat 
held in the body for just such emergencies, and some of 
it from the proteins of the body itself, such as the pro- 
teins of muscle. Now it is clearly understood that a 
man lying quietly in bed throughout the twenty-four 
hours of the day burns at least twelve Calories for every 



if. <■ 



THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 15 

pound of body weight, which means for an average man 
a daily total of from 1600 to 1800 Calories. So far as 
conditions permit, care is taken to see that the energy 
supply comes from food, rather than that the body be 
permitted to burn itself up, A general starving policy 
for the sick is as obsolete as blood-letting. 

The most satisfactory way to study any person's fuel 
requirements is to measure directly the amount of energy 
given off from his body hour by hour in the forms of 
work and heat. To do this, a closed chamber with walls 
impervious to heat is required, and devices for supplying 
fresh air and food, so that the person may remain within 
for some time. Such a device is called a respiration 
calorimeter. In its present state of perfection (the result 
of many years of experimentation) it is very elaborate 
and expensive to build and operate; hence the whole 
number in the world is not large. The illustration oppo- 
site shows the double-walled chamber (containing in this 
case a baby's bed) and some of the pipes for the ven- 
tilating system, which includes measurement and analysis 
of the air as it enters and leaves the calorimeter. In 
such a chamber a person may remain under normal con- 
ditions while his energy output is measured during sleep, 
awake but lying quietly, sitting up at rest, reading, writ- 
ing, riding a bicycle, or doing anything which the size of 
the chamber permits. 

The energy expenditures of men, women, and children 
have been studied in this way, and no matter what pre- 
conceived notions a person may have had about his own 
food requirements, the calorimeter measures his actual 



l6 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

energy expenditure, which there is no way to meet ex- 
cept by food. Hundreds of observations show that 
men under the same conditions of age, weight, and occu- 
pation expend practically the same amount of energy. 
This is further verified by studies of food consumption 
of men of the same class, doing the same kind of 
work, in different parts of the world, as the table below 
strikingly illustrates.^ 

Farmers in Connecticut 3410 Calories 

Farmers in Vermont 3635 Calories 

Farmers in New York 3785 Calories 

Farmers in Mexico 3435 Calories 

Farmers in Italy 3565 Calories 

Farmers in Finland 3474 Calories 

Average 3551 Calories 

As far as energy requirement is concerned, nutrition 
is an exact science ; a definite amount of work calls for 
a definite amount of energy in the form of food. The 
only reason why we are not forced to stop working as 
soon as food is withheld is that we are able to carry 
stores of fat (and a little carbohydrate) as reserve fuel, 
and also to draw if necessary on our own body protein. 
So men have fasted thirty and forty days ; but the body 
becomes more and more impoverished, and when the 
reserves are exhausted there must come fuel in the form 
of food, or all work stops and death is the result. On 
the other hand, if more fuel is supplied than can be 
used, the fires do not burn the brighter, but the surplus 
is stored up for emergencies and we say the person is

getting fat. In later chapters the fuel requirements of 
the different members of the family will be discussed in 
detail. 

The Body a Builder of its Own Tissues 

The body is not only an active, working machine, 
spending energy in the form of work and heat, and de- 
manding that the expenditure be made good by fresh 
suppHes of fuel in the form of food ; it is also a busy 
contractor, sending goods hither and yon along a net- 
work of traffic lines, to add to parts already built, or to 
replace or repair parts lost through ordinary wear and 
tear or through accident. The materials handled are of 
various kinds, made up from 16 or 17 different 
elements, among which may be mentioned carbon, 
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, iron, 
calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, chlorine, and 
iodine. By means of these substances a seven-pound 
baby grows until he becomes a man weighing perhaps 
200 pounds; and the man, though daily losing small 
portions as the price of his very existence, may still 
maintain a uniform weight through many years of adult 
life, by taking in enough to replace what has been lost. 
The relative amounts of these different elements in the 
adult body is shown in the following table : 

Average Elementary Composition of the Human Body^ 

Oxygen, about 65.0 per cent 

Carbon, about 18.0 per cent 

Hydrogen, about lo.o per cent 

Nitrogen 3.0 per cent

How Food Supplies the Material for Body Building 

The fuel foods all contain carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen, so that no special attention need be paid to 
these elements. Protein food has an absolute monopoly 
of the nitrogen supply for the body, and so occupies a 
distinguished place in the human economy, for nitrogen 
enters into the construction of body proteins, which are 
essential to the hfe of every cell and constitute the most 
prominent part of muscle tissue. A child cannot grow 
and form strong muscles without it ; a full-grown adult 
cannot keep in health without it, for throughout Hfe the 
cells discard small amounts of nitrogen hour by hour, as 
a waste product of their internal life ; furthermore, some 
old cells die, are disintegrated and their nitrogen thrown 
out, so that altogether there is a certain daily loss which 
must be made good by protein food. Hence in choosing 
the day's fuel we cannot confine ourselves to carbohydrate 
and fat, but must include some protein. The proportion 
of fuel best taken in this form will be discussed in con- 
nection with the food requirements of the different indi- 
viduals in the family group. 



THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 19 

Protein is a term standing for a large number of re- 
lated substances, all made by the chemical union of 
simpler substances containing nitrogen, called amino 
acids. There are 17 of these entering into the 
structure of common proteins, and, as has been aptly 
suggested, these are used like the letters of the alphabet 
to build up different kinds of protein. It is estimated 
that these 17 units may be joined together to make 
350 million times a million different combinations, 
using only a single representative of each. Hence we 
have milk, meat, fish, egg, cereal, and vegetable proteins, 
all built from the same "building stones," or the same 
"letters of the protein alphabet," containing therefore 
all the essentials for constructing different kinds of body 
protein, as circumstances may require. Such proteins 
are called "complete." There are certain proteins, 
such as gelatin and some kinds found in vegetable foods, 
in which important amino acids are lacking. If these 
"incomplete" proteins were used as the sole kind of 
protein in the diet of children they could not grow, 
because some of the constituents for building body pro- 
tein would be lacking. It would be like taking the word 
legume apart and trying to make the word muscle. We 
should have a superfluous g and e, but no s nor c, and 
be forced to break up another word, such as casein, to 
get the extra letters. The effect of incomplete proteins 
has been most interestingly shown in the feeding of young 
rats. When given milk food or a mixed diet they grew 
up in the normal way, but on a diet in which the only 
protein food was a single kind of incomplete protein 



20 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

called gliadin, separated for the purpose from all the 
other proteins of the wheat kernel, they seemed perfectly 
well but could not grow ; as long as they were kept on the 
gliadin diet they remained dwarfs, but as soon as fed 
with the milk food or mixed diet they began to grow 
again. In one experiment a rat fed the gUadin diet 
weighed, when 140 days old, just what it should have 
weighed when 36 days old ! 

Fortunately, most protein foods contain a goodly 
assortment of amino acids, and on an ordinary mixed 
diet, in which milk, eggs, meat, fish, and various vege- 
tables rich in protein are used, an adult need have little 
concern as to the particular kind of protein which he is 
taking. If he confines himself to vegetable food, in 
which incomplete proteins are more frequent, there is 
more danger of lack of sufficient amounts of some amino 
acid, and the combination with such a diet of some milk, 
cheese, or other food known to be rich in "complete" 
proteins is wise. In the diet of growing children this 
is a matter of more importance, and emphasis must be 
laid on the best proteins for growth, as will be brought 
out in the chapters on feeding of children. Protein in the 
food is measured according to its weight, usually in 
grams,^ according to its fuel value, in Calories, or accord- 
ing to the amount of nitrogen which it contains. The 
following table shows these protein and nitrogen values 
for a number of foods rich in protein : 

^ One gram equals about j^ of a pound.

Sulphur is supplied in the form of protein food, and 
if the nitrogen requirement is met the sulphur need give 
no concern. 

Phosphorus is equally important with nitrogen, 
though required in smaller amounts. It forms a part 
of every active cell of the body and, along with calcium, 
helps to give rigidity to the bones. It is not limited like 
nitrogen and sulphur to the protein of food, but is found

Iron is another element essential to body structure. 
It enters into the composition of the red corpuscles of 
the blood (essential to the conveyance of oxygen to the 
cells and hence to the burning of the fuel foods) and also 
is an element in the structure of all active cells, so play- 
ing a part in secretion and growth. While not needed 
in very large amounts, it is so important that the new- 
born child is not left to the chances of getting it in his 
food, but comes into the world with a special supply to 
tide him over the first few months while he is getting 
adjusted to the outer world. It is found in a variety of 
foods, among the most valuable being egg yolks and 
green vegetables, especially spinach.

Without calcium strong bones and teeth are impossible, 
since it, in combination with phosphorus, is the chief 
mineral element of these tissues. By far the most valu- 
able food for calcium is milk, 100 Calories of milk yield- 
ing as much as could be got from about 2400 Calories of 
white bread and meat. Considerable calcium can be ob- 
tained from the grains if the outer coats are included, but 
very little from cereal preparations made without them, as 
a comparison of whole wheat and white flour will show.

The other elements which go to make up the body 
structure are not only required in comparatively small 
amounts, but are practically certain to be provided if the 
diet contains the range of foods which will include the 
four already mentioned. Hence for practical purposes 
they may be dismissed without further discussion.

his movements at will. He makes us realize what fine 
coordination of nerves and muscles ordinary people 
enjoy. Now the body is composed of many units, each 
with activities of its own, but subservient to the welfare 
of the whole; there are glands, like the pancreas and 
the thyroid, which play a wonderful part in this coordi- 
nation. If the pancreas becomes seriously deranged, 
the body loses the power to burn carbohydrate and this 
most valuable of fuel foods is lost to the economy; if 
the thyroid gets excessively active, the body may burn 
fuel faster than it can be supplied, and the victim grows 
emaciated. 

So, too, the chemical elements which make up the 
body substance must be nicely balanced or trouble 
ensues. The blood maintains its neutrality, the heart 
its regular beat, nerves and muscles their ready response 
to every impulse, largely through the presence of phos- 
phorus, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium in 
suitable amounts in the tissues and fluids. Water helps 
to regulate the concentration of the mineral elements, 
to make possible the transportation of materials to the 
tissues by holding them in solution in the body fluids, 
and to faciUtate the removal of waste through the kidney 
drainage system. The elements which enter into food 
in other forms than protein, fat, carbohydrate, and 
water are conveniently grouped together as ash constit- 
uents, because they constitute the part left behind as 
ash when food materials are burned. They are some- 
times styled "salts" or "mineral matter." 

Besides the fuel foodstuffs, water, and ash constituents, 



THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 27 

there are substances existing in minute quantities in 
some foods and not in others which exercise a profound 
influence upon nutrition. These have only recently 
been studied at all, and their exact nature is still a 
matter of investigation. They are spoken of as '^ vita- 
mines" or "accessory food substances." Young white 
rats fed a diet of strictly pure protein, fat, carbohydrate, 
and ash constituents in suitable proportions, will not 
grow. If, however, certain natural food fats, such as 
butter, or beef fat, be substituted for the highly refined 
fat, an improvement is very quickly noted. So, too, 
persons hving almost exclusively on polished rice develop 
a disease called beriberi, which can be cured by feeding 
the unpolished rice, or by substituting beans for a small 
part of the rice. The United States stamped beriberi 
out of the ranks of the Phihppine scouts within three 
years by such simple changes in their army ration. 
Furthermore, individuals restricted to a diet of dried 
and cooked rations, especially if Limited in variety, run 
the risk of developing scurvy, which is readily cured by 
the addition of such fresh foods as oranges, lemons, limes, 
potatoes, and cabbage. Babies fed exclusively on cooked 
milk or dried prepared foods run a similar risk, and 
should have some fresh food, such as milk or orange 
juice, included in the diet if it rrust consist largely of the 
cooked or dried material. 

Under ordinary conditions there is comparatively little 
danger of scurvy or beriberi, since many foods contain 
vitamines and few people confine themselves strictly to 
cooked and dried foods. But it is well to know of the 



28 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

possible results of a too restricted ration and to include 
some fresh food in the diet, such as uncooked fruits and 
vegetables or unpasteurized milk, as well as to see that 
there is some variety in the kinds of food from time to 
time, so that all the elements contributing to good 
nutrition may be represented. 



CHAPTER II 

THE CARE OF THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 

The first requirement for good nutrition is an adequate 
supply of fuel for all body activities. This must be ac- 
companied by or include those substances which serve to 
build up the organism and maintain it in repair, con- 
stituting a so-called "balanced diet." Many selections 
of food will theoretically accompUsh these results, but 
not all of them are equally successful in practice. It is 
possible to make a balanced ration from two or three 
foods, if carefully selected, and eat these to the exclusion 
of all others. One may take the whole day's supply of 
protein in the form of cottage cheese, or of beans ; may 
divide the total day's food in two meals or six ; serve 
molasses on meat, as truly a combination of protein and 
carbohydrate as bread and meat. But we must ask 
whether these practices represent the highest art in caring 
for the human machine. It makes a great deal of 
difference in an engine whether the coal for the day 
is put in all at once or at intervals, whether in large 
lumps or fine dust. We may lose valuable fuel through 
imperfect combustion if the fires are choked. Coal may 
fall through the grate and be lost with the ashes if not of 
suitable size. The walls of the fixe chamber may be 

39 



3© FEEDING THE FAMILY 

burned out by bad packing preventing circulation of air. 
So in the case of the human furnace a great deal depends 
upon the way in which the fuel is introduced. 

We gather food materials from the four quarters of the 
globe, prepare them in factory and kitchen for the table, 
aud yet when the products come to the table they are 
mostly crude material so far as the body is concerned. 
Food must be subjected to many processes in that long 
and tortuous tract which we call the alimentary canal 
before it can enter upon its real functions in the living 
cells where energy is liberated and new material built. 
And the way it behaves in that canal is of great import 
for good nutrition. If it irritates the sensitive walls of 
stomach or intestines, the whole body is depressed, and 
the cells may be unable to make use of good material 
when finally brought to them. If it is crowded along 
too fast, with no time allowed between meals for rest of 
the digestive organs, a strike may be inaugurated against 
such bad working conditions and the poor body left to 
starve in the midst of plenty. 

Before discussing in detail, therefore, the food needs 
of individual members of the family, it will be worth while 
to give some attention to those principles in the choice 
and manner of taking food which in general tend to con- 
serve or promote good digestion and are more or less 
applicable to all. The final purposes in digestion are 
(i) to bring all foods into fluid form, (2) to separate all 
proteins into their amino acid fragments, (3) to divide 
all fats into two components (fatty acids and glycerol), 
soluble in the digestive fluids, and (4) to divide all car- 



THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 31 

bohydrates into their component parts (simple sugars). 
In such simple forms foods pass into the blood stream 
and thence to the tissues. 

The processes by which these objects are attained are 
partly mechanical and partly chemical. They begin 
when food is taken into the mouth and continue in orderly 
fashion until the products indicated above pass through 
the intestinal walls into the blood and lymph, and the 
waste material is eliminated in the feces. 

The Part of the Mouth in Good Digestion 

On guard at the beginning of the alimentary tract 
stands the mouth, whose first duty is to grind up coarse 
foods and soften or possibly dissolve them. Fluid foods 
reheve the mouth of this duty and are therefore selected 
when the teeth are missing or when for some other 
reason chewing is not likely to be well done. Fine minc- 
ing will to a large extent accomplish the same purpose ; 
so beef is sometimes scraped free of all tough fibers, 
vegetables and hard-cooked eggs put through a fine 
sieve when great ease of digestion is desired. On the 
other hand, when chewing is possible, similar fineness 
and softness may be attained by giving foods which 
must be chewed in order to swallow them, such as crisp 
toast, zwiebach, and hard crackers, which tend to break 
up in fine pieces and are not only softened but actually 
dissolved by the saUva, which has the power of acting 
chemically upon carbohydrate material. The agents in 
the aUmentary tract which spUt up proteins, fats, and 
carbohydrates into the fragments which can pass through 



32 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

the intestinal walls (amino acids, fatty acids and glycerol, 
and simple sugars) are technically called enzymes. 
They have been likened to keys, each fitting a single 
kind of lock, and setting free a simpler substance, as if 
one had a nest of boxes and a key to each by which the 
next smaller could be released. Thus in the saliva of 
the mouth we find an enzyme called ptyalin. It will 
unlock a starch unit, producing what we may call a 
"double sugar "1 (maltose); this in turn must be un- 
locked by another enzyme which will set free from it a 
simple sugar, — the kind which the blood can take to the 
muscles to burn for fuel. By means of nicely adjusted se- 
ries of enzymes the body is kept from being overwhelmed 
with the kind of material which it is trying to use. 
If we take at one time a large quantity of glucose, 
especially when the stomach contains no food which 
might help to dilute it, we are liable to irritation of the 
stomach and possibly of the small intestines, although 
glucose is a simple sugar and requires only to pass into 
the blood to be available to the body. This trouble is 
simply due to the fact that the body has too much of it 
to take care of at once. If it is greatly diluted with 
water before taking, it will cause no trouble ; or if taken 
in small enough quantities to be diluted by the saUva, 
or mixed with other foods so that it is thoroughly diluted 
by them. When starch is taken, it is gradually changed 
to sugar, and this is one great reason why it is better to 
have most of our carbohydrate food in the form of 
starch rather than of sugar. But starch needs to be 

* Techiucally known as a disaccharid. 



THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 33 

cooked so that the enzymes can readily attack it 
and large masses of starchy food broken up so that the 
digestive juices can reach every particle. Foods which 
become pasty in the mouth, such as hot breads of many 
kinds, soggy potatoes, or unripe, raw bananas, tend to 
slip down the throat in lumpy masses little affected 
by the saliva and hard for the other juices to penetrate. 
This is another reason why baked potatoes, baked ban- 
anas, and hard, dry bread-stuffs are better for steady 
diet than the pasty foods just mentioned. Pure starches, 
like cornstarch and tapioca, may be cooked rather 
quickly, but cereal foods, especially such forms as break- 
fast preparations of oats, corn, barley, and wheat, have 
their starch grains sealed within pockets of cellulose, 
which the body enzymes cannot soften and which are 
not usually well broken by chewing. Hence without 
long, slow cooking to loosen up these cellulose walls, 
much of the starch will fail to digest. 

Besides helping to grind and soften all hard, coarse 
food and to digest carbohydrate, chewing is one of the 
signals to the stomach to prepare for its duty. The ali- 
mentary canal is operated like a complex railway sys- 
tem. Signals are sent ahead and the way prepared for 
the oncoming load. Hence, while we cannot add to or 
take away from the energy which a food may contain 
by the care with which we chew it, we can make it 
easier for the rest of the digestive work to be carried on 
smoothly. We may thus save ourselves from some of 
the dangers of "indigestion," which often seems to be 
the chief topic when people discuss their food. 



34 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

The Part of the Stomach in Good Digestion 

The stomach is the great reservoir into which food 
from the mouth quietly settles. The receiving end holds 
it in such a way that the gastric juice penetrates it 
slowly ; and the digestion of starchy food, begun in the 
mouth if the food has been thoroughly chewed and mixed 
with saliva, may continue here for some time, till contact 
with the acid gastric juice stops the action of the 
saUvary enzyme and ends one chapter in the story of 
digestion. 

A good flow of healthy gastric juice depends upon 
many factors. Regularity in time of meals is one. 
Habit is a powerful force in digestion as elsewhere, and 
the habit of responding to food at regular times and 
those only will do much to keep the stomach healthy. 
Most people are exceedingly careless in this respect, 
and good food is often blamed for bad results, when the 
broken schedule was really what upset the system. 

Efficient mastication has already been mentioned as 
a factor in putting the stomach in good humor to receive 
food, and in sending the food down in such shape that 
it can be taken care of with ease. The pleasurable sen- 
sations from the sight, smell, and taste of food not only 
"make the mouth water," but the stomach also. Some 
foods stimulate a flow of gastric juice aside from any 
pleasant sensations they may produce, and are of great 
value when appetite fails or when for some other reason 
the stomach's responses to food in general are weak. 
Water is such a substance and can be taken a few minutes 



THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 35 

before or at the beginning of a meal with positive stimu- 
lating effect. The most efficient gastric stimulants are 
those substances which give flavor to meats ; hence the 
advantage of meat early in the meal when it is served, 
and the value of beginning a meal with soups contain- 
ing the extracts of meat, such as bouillon, consomme, 
and other kinds with meat stock as the foundation, 
when the stomach responses are feeble. Herein lies the 
chief value of beef broth for invalids ; but, since beef 
broth itseK has little if any fuel value, it should be 
accompanied by some " real food," which it will help to 
digest. 

The general nervous state of the person is very quickly 
reflected in the stomach. "Laugh and grow fat" is a 
wise saw. Attention to the appearance of food on the 
table and other devices which tend to put the pro- 
spective eater in a happy frame of mind are worth while 
from this point of view. Excitement, worry, anger, chill, 
fatigue, all tend to retard the digestive processes and the 
greatest skill in the choice of easily digested food may 
be of no avail while these unfavorable states persist. 
If food must be taken under such conditions, it is best 
taken in some warm, rather dilute fluid form, such as 
soup, cocoa, malted milk, gruel, or a raw egg beaten up 
in milk. Next best is some very dry food which has to 
be moistened and softened in the mouth and reaches 
the stomach nearly fluid, such as toast crisp throughout, 
which may be accompanied by some finely minced, 
lightly cooked lean meat. 

Concentrated foods of various kinds are apt to prove 



36 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

irritating, especially to a sensitive stomach. Among 
such foods are cheese, candy, nuts, strongly acid fruits. 
These should be used in small amounts at a time, and in 
combination with bland foods which will dilute them, 
— crackers, bread or macaroni with cheese, candy 
only at the end of a meal (never on an empty stomach, 
as concentrated sugar is particularly irritating), nuts in 
small quantities along with other food less rich in fat 
and less concentrated, acid fruits very much diluted, as 
in lemonade or cherry tapioca. 

The rate, and hence often the comfort, of digestion is 
further influenced by the proportions of protein, fat, 
and carbohydrate eaten. Water passes through the 
stomach very quickly. Carbohydrates tend to pass out 
faster than proteins and proteins faster than fats. Mix- 
tures of protein and carbohydrate go faster than proteins 
alone, but more slowly than carbohydrates. Mixtures 
of fat and protein, on the other hand, go more slowly 
than either alone. This retarding effect of fat is an 
advantage or disadvantage according to circumstances. 
The healthy empty stomach tends to contract rhythm 
mically, with more or less insistence, producing the 
"pangs of hunger." Its possessor, therefore, may find 
himself very uncomfortable between meals, complaining 
that his food does not "stay by him." He does not 
need a diet that relieves the stomach, but rather one 
which tends to require some time for digestion, and this 
can be accomplished by the use of more fat. Such a 
person can eat pork and beans, sausage, suet pudding, 
mince pie, and the like without discomfort, especially if 



THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 37 

leading an out-of-door life. A less vigorous person 
would find such foods delaying digestion unduly ; hence 
they are usually, and very properly, considered hard to 
digest. The same is true of other foods where a con- 
siderable amount of fat is intimately mixed with proteins 
or even with carbohydrates, such as fat meats, rich sauces, 
pastries, cakes. A good cook is not always the safest 
provider of the family food because of her tendency to 
load up all kinds of dishes with cream and butter. The 
taking of fat is less likely to be overdone if it is served by 
itself as butter for bread, or as thin cream for beverages 
and cereals, than when it is used Hberally in the kitchen. 
Most people can eat large amounts of carbohydrate 
food with ease. Thus bread, in which eight-tenths of 
the Calories are in the form of carbohydrate, is the 
"staff of life." But there are persons in whose stomachs 
carbohydrates tend to ferment very easily, usually be- 
cause of bad mastication, little gastric acid, or poor mus- 
cular activity of the stomach. These need to eat less 
carbohydrate food than others and to rely more upon 
protein and simple forms of fat for fuel. As already 
pointed out, sugars ferment more readily and are Uable 
to be more irritating than starchy foods, so that good 
results are often obtained merely by ruling out sugars 
and very sweet foods. At other times foods containing 
much cellulose, such as green vegetables, must be 
excluded because the cellulose tends to retard carbohy- 
drate digestion, unless it is removed through a strainer. 
Usually it is wise to enforce good mastication by the 
use of hard, dry breadstuffs. 



38 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Good stomach digestion depends, in general, upon 
keeping the whole body in good condition by breathing 
fresh pure air, taking suitable exercise, cultivating cheer- 
ful mental habits ; observing regular mealtimes, and 
refraining from food at all other times; avoiding 
food when greatly overwrought or exhausted, or lim- 
iting it to simple, warm, fluid foods; masticating 
thoroughly so that food never goes down in large lumps ; 
paying some regard to the retarding effect of fat on 
digestion; and avoiding large amounts of very con- 
centrated or irritating foods. 

Good Digestion in the Small Intestine 

Into the small intestine by spurts from the stomach 
comes material in various stages of digestion, mostly 
fluid, with small particles of insoluble or still undissolved 
substances floating in it. Here are enzymes greater in 
number and more powerful in action than anywhere else 
in the alimentary canal. The acid gastric juice sends a 
call to the pancreas through a special " chemical messen- 
ger" and out pours a fluid with enzymes for starch, pro- 
tein, and fat. From the walls of the intestine itself 
numbers of tiny glands supply a secretion containing 
enzymes for breaking up the last combinations, setting 
free amino acids from the larger protein fragments left 
by the other enzymes, and also dividing all the remain- 
ing double sugars into simple sugars. The bile flows into 
the intestine and makes conditions more favorable for 
these changes, especially helping in the digestion of fat. 

In the small intestine we find two systems of move- 



THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 39 

ments. By one the food is very thoroughly mixed with 
the digestive juices containing the enzymes, and brought 
into contact with the tiny fingerlike projections on the 
intestinal walls which absorb the digested materials and 
start them on their journey to the tissues that need them. 
By the other, the material is moved along from part to 
part, meeting fresh surfaces for absorption, and leaving 
less and less to be pushed into the large intestine. 

Good health in the small intestine is very quickly 
affected by conditions in the stomach. Hence it is for- 
tunate that the stomach is very sensitive to bad feeding 
and gives us warning of what we may be doing to the 
more important intestinal tube. Any nervous disturb- 
ance affecting the stomach is likely to be shared sym- 
pathetically by its neighbor. Anger, fear, and other 
painful emotions tend to stop digestion in all parts. 
Bacteria of various kinds thrive in the small intestine, 
and when food is not digested at the normal rate, are 
likely to seize it and devote it to their own nourishment. 
Thus carbohydrates tend to ferment, producing trouble- 
some gases and irritating acids ; and proteins to undergo 
putrefaction, with the formation of products which are 
more harmful than those formed by carbohydrates, 
producing, when absorbed into the system, the con- 
dition called "auto-intoxication." Fermentation can be 
lessened by limiting carbohydrate food, and putrefaction 
reduced by limiting protein food ; the dangers of both 
can be avoided in part by care in mastication and choice 
of the form in which the food is taken, and in part by 
stimulating normal peristalsis in the intestine — the 



40 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

movement which carries the food downward into the 
large intestine. This will be discussed in detail after a 
few words in regard to the large intestine. 

Good Digestion in the Large Intestine 

The large intestine serves in great measure as a recep- 
tacle in which the last portions of digested material may 
be sorted out from the waste which is to be eliminated 
as of no further use to the body. No digestive enzymes 
are furnished in its fluids; no such vigorous mixing of 
food and digestive juices occurs as in the small intestine, 
though a slow backward movement in the part adjacent 
to the small intestine forces the material in this part 
back and forth to insure absorption of all that is useful. 
At intervals a vigorous downward push forces the waste 
onward and finally out of the body altogether. 

It is very important that these movements of large 
and small intestine, conveying material along the tract, 
be normal. If they are too rapid, digestion is left in- 
complete and the body loses valuable food material, as 
in diarrhea. If they are too slow, waste accumulates, 
mechanically irritating to the intestinal walls and to 
adjacent parts; bacteria prey upon the retained ma- 
terial, and ample opportunity is afforded for the absorp- 
tion of any poisons which they may produce, thus laying 
the foundations for bad complexions, headaches, sensa- 
tions of fatigue, irritation of the appendix, and other 
unpleasant conditions. 

The peristaltic movement of the large intestine tends 
to be hindered by many of the habits of civilized life. 



THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 41 

In the first place, the abdominal muscles are likely to 
have less exercise and hence to be less vigorous, partlji 
because of less general physical activity and partly be- 
cause of more confining dress, particularly for women. 
In the second place, food is likely to be too highly refined. 
Some bulk is necessary for intestinal muscles to exer- 
cise against, and this is obtainable only by taking some 
indigestible material as part of the diet. Animals get 
ballast in the form of sand, or bones, or the woody parts 
of plants, and many of the natural foods of man contain 
considerable woody fiber, seeds, and other forms of 
cellulose. But by our modern milling processes we 
remove the bran from grains; in our market gardens 
we force vegetables so that their fiber is very deh- 
cate ; we discard seeds and rind of fruits, and thus make 
possible a diet almost free from ballast. 

Furthermore, modern transportation makes possible 
a very free choice of food. We are not dependent on a 
problematic catch of game or fish for meat ; we can have 
it every day and three times a day so long as we have 
money to buy it. Therefore we may unconsciously 
eliminate from the dietary or relegate to an insignificant 
place foods which have chemically a stimulating in- 
fluence upon the movements of the intestines, such as 
most fruits and acid vegetables. 

Finally, habit plays a large part in normal intestinal 
movement, as in other digestive processes. If the normal 
warning is disregarded, it soon becomes ineffective and 
recalling it becomes increasingly difficult. The greatest 
stimulus to intestinal movement comes immediately 



42 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

after taking food into the stomach and particularly after 
breakfast. Thus the omission of breakfast, common 
with some persons, may mean the loss of a much needed 
impulse. 

From these various causes, constipation is one of the 
recognized ills of modern life. One has only to notice 
advertisements of drugs in street cars and on billboards 
to realize this. But the taking of drugs is a poor sub- 
stitute for the normal control of the alimentary tract 
by diet, and is to be countenanced only when more 
hygienic measures fail. 

Diet for Constipation 

In endeavors to remedy or avoid constipation through 
diet, we may choose then : 

(i) Foods rich in cellulose, such as celery, cabbage, 
string beans, dried beans and lentils with their hulls, as- 
paragus, lettuce, spinach, onions, raisins, figs, prunes, and 
other fruits eaten with their skins, cereals from which the 
bran has not been removed, such as rolled or cut oats 
and wheat. When still more ballast is required, bran 
itself can be used in various ways, the pleasantest being 
as bran bread, muffins, or crackers. Another plant 
product which serves the same purpose is agar-agar 
or " vegetable gelatin." This is eaten simply cut into 
small pieces, along with or instead of some breakfast 
food, or it can be obtained in the form of wafers. It 
may also be made into biscuits ; boiled in water, flavored 
and cooled, it makes an edible jelly.^ Successful results 

^ One-fourth ounce of agar-agar will solidify one quart of liquid. 



THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 43 

from the use of such foods depend largely upon taking 
a sufficient quantity and constantly including them 
in the diet. 

(2) Foods yielding vegetable acids, such as lemons, 
oranges, tomatoes, rhubarb, apples, cider, and other 
fruits and fruit juices (except blackberries, which are 
constipating). The acids are mild stimulants to intes- 
tinal movement and most people find fruit pleasant to 
take. The desired results are often gained by taking 
fruit or fruit juice the first thing in the morning. For 
persons of sensitive stomach, very mild fruit should be 
selected, or fruit juice diluted with water. Hot lemon- 
ade, prunes, or figs may be tried at bed time, if they do 
not cause discomfort. Liberal serving of fruit at meals 
has much to recommend it as a means of counteracting 
constipation. 

(3) Foods producing slight gas formation, such as 
honey, molasses, spinach, onions, cauliflower, and some 
others. These tend to ferment slightly; the gas gene- 
rated breaks up hard masses in the intestine and also 
acts as a slight stimulant to movement. Carbonated 
waters may bring about the same result through the gas 
with which they are charged. Honey and molasses are 
best taken with coarse breads. They must not be used 
too freely or they will disturb digestion. The vegetables 
may be effectively served as salads with an olive oil dress- 
ing, or simply cooked and seasoned with salt and butter. 

(4) A lubricant. For people whose digestion of fat is 
rather imperfect, fat in liberal quantities is often laxa- 
tive and such may be benefited by a tablespoonful or 



44 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

two of olive oil before breakfast and the last thing at 
night. For most people, however, the lubricatiiig effect 
is lost through digestion of the fat and can only be secured 
by taking an indigestible mineral oil. Such substances 
do not actually stimulate intestinal movement, and only 
aid in the elimination of waste by making it softer and 
allowing it to pass along the tract more readily. If 
movement is very sluggish, the oil may slip through 
without carrying feces with it, in which case foods of the 
two types indicated above must also be used, or recourse 
had to drugs which specifically stimulate peristalsis, 
under the guidance of a physician. 

A large volume of water, two glasses or more, if taken 
on an empty stomach, will sometimes start intestinal 
peristalsis, but since water tends to be absorbed before it 
reaches the large intestine its action is rather uncertain, 
differing greatly with individuals. However, the drink- 
ing of water freely is desirable, as it helps to flush out the 
system and carry waste products off through the kidneys.

CHAPTER III 
FOOD FOR THE ADULl' MAN 

A HUMAN being requires about twenty-five years to 
complete his growth. During this time he adds to his 
stature, gains in weight, and changes in physiological 
and mental habits. Then he enters upon a period, last- 
ing perhaps from a quarter to a third of a century, during 
which his body may maintain a fairly constant weight, 
and no marked changes occur in the nature of any of his 
body processes. He is now the fully built "working 
machine" and his first food requirement is adequate fuel 
for his varied activities. 

Some of the general principles governing choice of fuel 
have already been discussed in Chapter II. We are now 
concerned with the amount of fuel which will maintain 
the best working conditions. Underfeeding will weaken 
the body by causing it to draw upon its own substance 
for fuel ; overfeeding will result in the storage of an 
overload of fat, interfering with normal muscle action 
and making unnecessary weight to carry, or else it will 
tax the digestive and excretory systems to the point of 
injury. Ideal conditions exist when a man carries a 
normal weight for his height, and his daily intake of food 
corresponds closely to his daily expenditure of energy. 

46 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT MAN 47 

Energy Requirements of the Adult Man 

THE SEDENTARY MAN 

Studies of healthy adult men lying at rest in a respira- 
tion calorimeter/ after fifteen hours without food, show 
that in the work of maintaining their internal body 
processes (circulation, respiration, muscle tension, etc.) 
they expend about 0.45 Calories per pound per hour; 
that is, a man weighing 154 pounds and lying quietly in 
bed without food for twenty-four hours would draw upon 
the tissues of his body for fuel to the extent of about 
1665 Calories. From this fundamental or ' ' basal ' ' require- 
ment there is no escape while normal life processes go 
on. If food be taken to make good this loss, the in- 
fluence of food itself (often called the "work of diges- 
tion") must be taken into account in making up the 
balance. This will add about 10 per cent to the total 
heat production, so that his expenditure will be about 
one-half Calorie per pound per hour, or 1850 Calories 
for the whole day. Every movement of hand or 
foot, all the muscular work involved in raising and 
keeping the body in a sitting or standing position, or 
in performing the varied activities of daily life, wiU 
make definite increases in the energy output, all of 
which have been carefully measured in scientific labo- 
ratories. 

Sitting quietly in a chair, with only the movements 
usually incident to sedentary living, such as changes of 
posture, movements in reading, writing, or talking, wiU

make the total fuel cost per hour about three-fifths of a 
Calorie per pound. Hence a man of average weight, 
spending eight hours in bed and sixteen hours in a chair, 
will need a daily total food supply of approximately 
2 1 GO Calories. 

Standing involves more energy than sitting, raising 
the energy expenditure to about three-fourths of a 
Calorie per pound per hour, while walking on a level 
road at a rate of some three miles an hour, or other light 
exercise incident to ordinary Hfe, calls for about one 
Calorie per pound per hour. The day's energy require- 
ment of a man of sedentary habits may then be esti- 
mated as follows :

Studies of food requirements of sedentary men of 
various occupations, as, for instance, writers, draughts- 
men, teachers, bookkeepers, shoemakers, tailors, phy- 
sicians, and others who sit at their desks or watch ma- 
chinery show that they tend to require from 2200 to 
2800 Calories per day, as they vary somewhat in weight 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT MAN 49 

and activity. It is possible to supply this amount of 
fuel in the form of cereals, beans, pork, bread and 
butterine, with hot coffee and milk, for from 10 to 
15 cents a day, or from two-fifths to one-half a cent per 
100 Calories.^ Reference to Table IV, showing costs 
per 100 Calories of some common foods, will make it 
clear, however, that the range of foods which can be 
used in a dietary costing less than three-quarters of a 
cent per 100 Calories is quite hmited. Men prefer a 
more varied diet and it is easier to secure all the elements 
for good nutrition, including good digestion, if it is pos- 
sible to spend somewhat more for food. The following 
food plan is suggested as a working basis for the selection 
of the diet of a sedentary man, when the money allow- 
ance is liberal. The cost estimate is based on New 
York City prices, and in many regions, where meats, 
milk, fresh fruits, and vegetables are cheaper, the food 
could be obtained for less. Such a plan will give a diet 
adequate in all respects and sufficiently easy of digestion 
for the ordinary sedentary person. 

The dietaries worked out from this food plan (pp. 52, 
53) show in detail how the following of such a scheme 
will insure a well-balanced ration.^ 

* The average for such men is often taken as 2500 Calories per day, and 
a very interesting publication by Gephart and Lusk on the "Analysis 
and Cost of Ready to Serve Foods," as found in Childs' Restaurants in 
New York City, gives the cost of 2500 Calories in foods arranged in order 
of their increasing price. This includes the cost of preparation, service, 
and business profits, while the estimates in this book are merely for raw 
food materials, prepared and eaten with the minimum of waste. 

^ Many of the recipes used in the menu in this and following dietaries 
are given in the Apf>endix, Table III.

THE MUSCULARLY ACTIVE MAN 

Muscular activity greatly increases an individual's 
total energy requirement. The sedentary occupations 
demand little more food than would be needed if the 
person were sitting at rest, though it would be better 
for sedentary persons to take some vigorous exercise 
each day for the sake of their general health and increase 
their food intake accordingly. This is particularly true 
of brain workers and all whose work involves nervous 
rather than muscular tension. 

Muscular work is usually graded as "light," "moder- 
ate," "active," or "severe," light exercise being such as 
that incident to sedentary occupations and not much 
more vigorous than walking at a moderate pace along a 
level road, and requiring about one Calorie per pound of 
body weight per hour. "Moderate" exercise is typical 
of occupations which involve active use of some parts of

the body while sitting, standing, or walking, as in the 
case of carpenters, mail carriers, house workers, and 
others. Such exercise means an expenditure of from 
one and one-fourth to one and one-half Calories per 
pound per hour during working hours, and a daily total 
for men of average size in such occupations of from 2700 
to 3000 Calories. 

"Active" exercise is sufficiently great to develop 
muscular strength, as in farmers, masons, and black- 
smiths, and requires during active working hours an 
expenditure of from one and three-fourths to two 
Calories per pound per hour, or approximately 3500 
Calories per day. "Severe" exercise indicates very 
heavy muscular work, such as that done by lumber- 
men, excavators, and stevedores, and calls for fuel 
equal to as much as three Calories per pound per 
hour during work, so that the total day's food require- 
ment for such men often reaches 4000 and may reach 
6000 Calories. 

The changes in energy requirement due to differences 
in activity may be summarized as follows :

A day's food plan for a man doing severe work is 
given below. Such work usually insures good appetite 
and digestion, if the work be done under generally 
hygienic conditions. Hence more foods rich in fat, such 
as fried cereal foods, sausage, pork and beans, suet 
pudding, and pie, may be taken without detriment. 
These have the advantage, too, of raising the total fuel 
value of the diet without greatly increasing the volume 
of food to be consumed.

S8 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Thin and Fat Men 

THIN MEN 

In case men are extremely thin or fat, some variation 
from the general rule of feeding according to age and 
weight is necessary. Thin men usually have more muscle 
in proportion to weight than fat men, and they also have 
more surface exposed, both of which facts increase their 
need for fuel somewhat. A store of body fat is de- 
sirable as reserve fuel for emergencies, as evidence 
of a well-nourished body which is more resistant to 
disease, and as protection against jars and bruises. 
This reserve can only be gained by taking food in excess 
of daily fuel needs. Tables showing what normal men 
of different ages and height should weigh may be con- 
sulted with profit and are for convenience included in 
the Appendix. Since food is the only source of body 
substance, persistent overfeeding is the only way to 
gain in weight. Change of climate, outdoor living, and 
other devices which increase appetite are aids in taking 
sufficient food, but much can be accompUshed under 
ordinary living conditions by conscious effort to take 
more fuel. Simple foods which do not upset digestion 
are best. Liberal use of butter, cream and bacon, and 
the taking of from one to two tablespoons of olive oil 
after each meal, are practical ways of increasing the fuel 
value of the diet. Vegetables can be served with cream 
sauces, or as salads with mayonnaise, French, or cream 
dressings; milk enriched with cream, cocoa and choco- 
late made with milk, or tea and coffee with cream 
and sugar liberally used are comparatively easy to 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT MAN 



59 



take. Custards and creams of various kinds are valu- 
able means of adding to the fuel value of the meal. 
Meat is best used in moderation.

6o FEEDING THE FAMILY 

FAT MEN 

A fat man requires less fuel in proportion to his weight 
than an ordinary man. Fat represents "dead weight." 
The actual amount of muscle may be no more (even less) 
than in another man who tips the scales at a lower figure. 
As men grow older they tend to less and less muscular 
exertion and yet their appetites often continue keen, so 
that they keep up eating habits formed in more active 
years, with the result that they steadily take in more 
fuel than they use up, and gradually increase in weight. 
Too much fat is a disadvantage, as it is apt to interfere 
with the healthy play of the muscles, causing them to 
deteriorate, and laying the foundation for troubles with 
the heart. Excessively fat people also seem predisposed 
toward gout and obesity. It is usually much easier to 
keep the weight from becoming excessive than to reduce 
fat after it has been stored. Hence it should be borne 
in mind that persistent gain in weight in a healthy per- 
son means that he has been overeating and he should 
make consistent efforts to lower his food intake. In- 
creasing exercise will help to burn off fat, but is likely 
to stimulate the appetite, so that accurate measurement 
and systematic Umitation of the fuel value of the diet is 
necessary. 

Foods very high in fuel value, i.e., fats and dishes 
containing much fat, should be avoided and bulky foods 
of low fuel value used to satisfy the eager appetite. 
Even then considerable self-denial is usually necessary to 
achieve success. Clear soups should take the place of

Green vegetables of all kinds, raw or plainly cooked, 
such as cabbage, celery, lettuce, spinach, asparagus, 
cauliflower, can be freely eaten. Bread, cereals, pota- 
toes, and other starchy foods should be taken in small 
quantities and can often be omitted. Fresh fruits 
should be substituted for puddings, cakes, and pies. 
Lean meats, simply cooked, may be used liberally if 
plenty of green vegetables be also included in the diet. 

Building Material for the Adult Man 

When a steam engine transforms the energy of coal 
into useful work, about nine-tenths of the total amount 
of energy present in the fuel will be unavoidably con- 
verted into heat and dissipated into the surrounding 
atmosphere, and only one-tenth actually transformed 
into useful work. In the finest motors the skill of the 
designer has succeeded in reducing this inevitable loss 
of potential working power to about seven- tenths. Man 
is a much more efficient machine than the ordinary 
engine, being able to convert up to a third of his energy 
into muscular activity when well trained to his work 
(very commonly as much as one-fifth) and also utilizing 
the heat which is a by-product of his activities to keep 
up his body temperature. Man can also do his work 
with comparatively little wear and tear on the body 
itself, provided he treats it with the same care that 
would be given to any other high grade machine — 
supplies fuel in suitable forms and amounts, keeps within 
the limits of its work capacity, and sees that it is well oiled 
(furnished with regulating materials) and clear of waste. 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT MAN 63 

Nevertheless, as we have seen in Chapter I, it is a 
law of life that some old material shall constantly be 
replaced by new, and we must take into account a daily 
loss from the body of substances entering into its inti- 
mate structure or serving to modify and control its 
processes, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and cal- 
cium. We must find out how the diet is to compensate 
for such depletions. 

THE PROTEIN OR NITROGEN REQUIREMENT 

During much of the nineteenth century biological 
chemistry was dominated by the ideas of the great 
organic chemist, Liebig. He thought muscular work 
to be performed at the expense of the muscle itself, and 
taught that the only way to maintain muscular strength 
was to eat protein food, and especially that as much like 
the body protein as possible, namely, meat. But near 
the middle of the century this idea was subjected to 
scientific investigation, and convincing, though crude, 
proof adduced to show that a man doing a day's work 
without protein food would by no means burn enough 
of his body protein to account for the work done ; in 
fact, would burn scarcely more than if he had not been 
working at all. It became apparent, therefore, that fats 
and carbohydrates were the main source of muscular 
energy, a fact fully demonstrated before the opening 
of the twentieth century. 

If a diet be ample in fuel, chiefly as carbohydrate and 
fat, the loss of protein for each individual in health 
proceeds quite uniformly, whether his life be active or 



64 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

quiet. Muscles do not "break down" in exercise; 
rather they tend to "build up," or increase in size and 
strength, and thus to store protein in their own struc- 
ture rather than to use up what they have. Accord- 
ingly, the actual requirement for protein in the diet is 
comparatively independent of the amount of physical 
exertion, and remains fairly constant whether the indi- 
vidual be leading the sedentary Ufe of an office or the 
strenuous life of outdoor work on the farm or in the 
lumber camp. The requirement for fuel, on the other 
hand, will vary tremendously with the kind and amount 
of work, as previously shown. 

The fact that protein food is both a fuel and a build- 
ing material makes its place in the diet confusing. 
When burned for fuel, the nitrogen in its constitution is 
gotten rid of as speedily as possible, beginning to appear 
in the urine within an hour or two after a meal, and the 
non-nitrogenous fragments then burn like carbohydrate 
or fat. When protein is used for building material, the 
nitrogen is retained in the body to help form new body 
protein. There is, however, no provision for storing a 
surplus against a rainy day. What is not needed is 
excreted and that for future use must come from future 
food. It is possible to take the whole day's fuel in the 
form of protein food, lean beef, for instance. A man 
requiring 3000 Calories would have to eat nearly five 
pounds and would get eight or nine times as much pro- 
tein as actually needed to keep up his body protein. 
Since protein food is expensive, this would be uneco- 
nomical, if not harmful. By substituting carbohydrate 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT MAN 6$ 

or fat and carbohydrate, as potatoes, bread, butter, and 
the like, for part of the protein, a much more satisfac- 
tory diet can be arranged. 

In scientific laboratories detailed experiments have 
been made to try to establish the ideal proportion of 
protein in the diet, and with plenty of fuel it is found 
that the protein will be used very economically. At the 
same time, protein is good fuel itself, and there is no 
reason for restricting one's intake to the minimum, 
under ordinary circumstances. For a man of average 
weight, from two to two and one-half protein Calories 
per pound of body weight will adequately protect the 
body against protein starvation and leave some surplus 
to be burned as fuel. 

Where strict economy must be practiced, it is well to 
remember that adequate fuel is the first requisite for 
good nutrition, and the use of protein simply for fuel is 
extravagant. On the other hand, many protein foods 
are easy to digest, and when economic conditions do not 
forbid may be used more freely. There are hmits, how- 
ever, beyond which it does not seem wise to go. When 
a very large proportion of the day's fuel is protein 
material there is produced in the body a kind of stimu- 
lation which results in an increased production of body 
heat. This is of no advantage so far as we know, except 
when a person is exposed to cold, and can utilize this 
heat to maintain his body temperature instead of gener- 
ating more by shivering or more active muscular activity. 
In extremely cold climates or in severe winter weather 
in temperate regions, a liberal supply of protein in the 



66 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

diet may promote physical comfort. On the other hand, 
in hot weather, especially with much humidity, dissipa- 
tion of heat which the body is inevitably generating 
becomes difficult, and an extra supply of heat arising 
from a large amount of protein in the diet simply in- 
creases the difficulty of keeping comfortable, and may 
be a real menace to health. Furthermore, individuals 
differ in the ease with which they get rid of the surplus 
nitrogen. Sometimes large amounts of protein food, 
especially meats, tend to increase intestinal putrefaction 
and bring on a whole train of unfavorable symptoms; 
sometimes the kidneys' powers are overtaxed, and cer- 
tain forms of nitrogen tend to accumulate in the body 
to its disadvantage. For such reasons, a moderate 
supply of protein, covering fully the needs for nitrogen, 
but not serving as the chief source of fuel, will produce 
the best results. 

It is often convenient to express this in terms of the 
total day's fuel. An allowance of two Calories per 
pound for a man of average weight means about 300 
Calories per day. If his total energy requirement is 
3000 Calories, this means approximately 10 per cent of 
his fuel in the form of protein; if the total is 2500 
Calories, 12 per cent in the form of protein. Two and 
one-half Calories per pound for a man consuming 3000 
Calories would mean about 15 per cent of his fuel as 
protein. A higher proportion results in more loss of 
heat from the stimulating power of protein, so that in 
general the body needs seem best met by supplying from 
10 to 15 per cent of the total fuel in the form of protein, 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT MAN 67 

except when a man is in bed, in which case care should 
be taken that he has at least two protein Calories per 
pound. By reference to the dietaries already given ^ it 
will be seen that the protein supply falls within the limits 
suggested here. 

Liebig's notion that meat is a peculiar source of body 
strength having caught the popular fancy, and agreeing 
well with the food preferences of many, it has been 
slow in giving way to newer conceptions of the place of 
protein in nutrition, and many spend money in main- 
taining a traditionally high amount of meat in the diet 
who might be using their money to better advantage 
and perhaps securing better health. The regard in 
which meat is held is probably largely due to its pecuUar 
texture and to certain substances found in its juices 
which give it a pronounced and agreeable flavor and 
exert a stimulating effect upon appetite and digestion. 
Meat agrees with the lazy eater who bolts his food, 
because it does not require mixing with saUva, being 
dissolved by the gastric juice of the stomach even if 
swallowed in comparatively large pieces. 

As regards satisfying real body needs, meat proteins 
are by no means superior to all others. In fact, the 
proteins provided by nature for building body protein, 
as in the growth of the young, are found in milk and 
eggs. The value of milk as a source of protein for growth 
has already been pointed out. Meat has certain dis- 
advantages as the sole or chief protein food of the diet. 
Associated more or less intimately with the protein of 

* See pages 52, 53, 57, 59, and 61. 



68 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

meat we find certain substances called "purins," to 
which, in part, the flavor is due. These purins are not 
nutritious, but are gradually transformed in the body- 
to uric acid, to be carried off as waste in the urine. Per- 
sons inclined to gout have difficulty in getting rid of 
uric acid, and the more meat they eat the more uric acid 
tends to accumulate in the system, circulating in the 
blood and depositing in the joints. If protein is taken 
in moderation and chiefly from eggs, milk, cheese, bread, 
and nuts, which contain no purins, dangers of this diffi- 
culty may be avoided. Meat proteins are also particu- 
larly liable to intestinal putrefaction, while milk not only 
is less liable to this kind of decomposition, but actually 
helps to decrease the number of putrefactive bacteria in 
the intestines. For persons of indoor sedentary life a 
very Hberal use of meat is certainly undesirable. Even 
athletes, for whom meat was once thought especially 
necessary, have demonstrated the possibility of reducing 
their daily consumption to one-sixth the amount which 
the training table previously provided, with an actual 
increase in their capacity for endurance. Aside from 
questions of health the economic advantages of some 
other protein foods over meat are easily demonstrated. 

By reference to the table on page 21 Mt will be seen 
that 100 Calories of lean round of beef will yield 54.5 
protein Calories. Six portions will, therefore, supply 
327 protein Calories, enough protein for an average-sized 
man for a day. But these 600 Calories will cost 24 
cents (with beef at 28 cents a pound in the market) and 
^ Protein in loo-Calorie portions. 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT MAN 69 

if his fuel requirement is 3000 Calories, 2400 must still 
be bought to make up the day's total. If milk be selected, 
it will take 17 portions, costing 22.6 cents (with milk at 
9 cents per quart), but leaving only 1300 Calories to be 
obtained from other sources. If eggs are chosen, 9 por- 
tions will be required, costing 22.5 cents (with eggs at 
25 cents a dozen), but requiring only 2100 Calories to 
supplement those from protein. Milk and eggs are not 
only adequate substitutes for meat, but they carry in 
addition valuable ash constituents which would have 
to be added to the meat ration to make it equally valu- 
able with either of the other two. The housewife who 
provides a somewhat varied diet, ample in fuel value, 
including milk and eggs, need not feel that she is depriv- 
ing her family of any essential if she furnishes a very 
small amount of meat or none at all. One-fourth of a 
pound a day as an average for each adult man will 
provide approximately one-third of his protein require- 
ment; bread, cereals, fruit and green vegetables will 
furnish another third ; and the remainder can be obtained 
with little difficulty from a glass of milk, an egg, some 
cheese, beans, or nuts. 

THE ASH REQUIREMENT 

Attention has already been called in Chapter I^ to 
the importance of the ash constituents of food — how 
they enter into the structure of the skeleton and the soft 
tissues, and take a prominent part in the maintenance of 
life and health through the regulation of body processes. 
* See pages 21-25. 



70 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

The results of ash starvation would not be manifested 
so quickly as those of deprivation of water, fuel, or pro- 
tein (nitrogen) because the amounts lost daily are small 
and in an adult the reserves in the body are compara- 
tively great. Nevertheless, the ash supply is worthy of 
consideration in any food. Studies of what men actually 
do eat reveal that the elements most likely to be taken 
in too small amounts for a good daily balance are phos- 
phorus, calcium, and iron. A comparison of a reason- 
able supply of these elements for an adult with the 
amounts furnished by several combinations of food other- 
wise very excellent will show how ash-bearing foods 
might be neglected (i and 2 below), and how introducing 
a single change will improve such food combinations 
(3 and 4 below). The quantities per day beUeved to be 
adequate for an average healthy man are as follows : 

Phosphoric acid 2.75 grams 

Calcium oxide 0.70 gram 

Iron 0.015 gram 

(i) A ration of lean meat, white bread, and butter 
would be ample in protein and total fuel, but conspicu- 
ously deficient in calcium.

In the probability of satisfying the ash requirement 
lies one advantage of a mixed diet. If some foods 
known to be rich in iron, calcium, and phosphorus are 
included each day, one may rest assured that the ash 
constituents will be adequately provided for, without 
detailed calculations Uke those on pages 70 and 7 1 . Milk 
is the most valuable source of calcium ; a single 100 
Calories will supply one-third of the day's requirement. 
Other valuable sources are indicated in the table on 
page 24} One portion of milk will also supply one-ninth 
of the day's phosphorus requirement. Eggs (especially 
the yolk), cereals from whole grains, lean meat, dried peas 
and beans, are desirable for their phosphorus content. 
(See table, page 22).^ With the exception of milk, 
the foods just named and fruits and green vegetables are 
rich sources of iron. (See table, page 23).^ A large 
serving of spinach will of itself supply one-third of the 
day's iron requirement. 

With a little knowledge, it is not necessary to have 
elaborate cookery or many kinds of food to keep a man 
well nourished. As indicated above, so simple a ration 
as milk and graham bread will furnish all the essentials 
of a well-balanced diet, provided some or all of the milk 
is uncooked, to secure those "accessory food sub- 
stances," ^ which in milk are affected unfavorably by 
high temperature. The amount of waste to make

ballast for the intestines is not very large; it could be 
increased by the addition of fresh fruit, such as apples 
or oranges, or of some green vegetable like radishes or 
onions. The bread-butter-beef -milk diet is not quite 
so ideal from the point of view of counteracting consti- 
pation, and needs even more the addition of some coarse 
material. Changes in the kind of bread (or use of equiv- 
alent fuel in the form of cereals and potatoes) and in 
the kind of meat and fruit will give that variety which 
maintains good appetite. Warm food usually adds to 
the ease with which a meal is digested, and often to its 
relish. Any one trying to live on a rather monotonous 
diet finds that soup, tea or coffee, "help one to eat 
bread." Whether tea and coffee add to the food value 
of the diet or not depends chiefly upon how much milk 
(or cream) and sugar are taken in them. 



CHAPTER IV 
FOOD FOR THE ADULT WOMAN 

Energy Requirement 

However much civilization may tend to empha- 
size certain physiological and psychological differences 
between men and women, when we come to study 
their essential food needs we find that the laws of 
energy exchange are practically the same for both sexes. 
Respiration, circulation, digestion, and muscular ten- 
sion, — all forms of internal body work, — demand their 
daily quota of fuel; the larger the body, the more 
fuel required to run it; the more external work done 
by the human machine, the more fuel demanded for 
this purpose. 

In actual comparisons between hving men and women, 
we recognize that men as a class are larger and heavier 
than women ; they also tend to have a higher muscular 
development and to carry on more severe muscular 
work ; wherefore the common notion that men as a rule 
eat more than women is true. But when we compare 
men and women of the same height and weight, lying 
at rest so that differences in external activity are ex- 

74 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT WOMAN 



75 



eluded, we find them requiring about the same number 
of Calories, the differences being no greater than between 
athletically developed and ordinary men, or between 
tall and muscular men as compared with short and fat 
men. Women as a class tend to have more body fat in 
proportion to their weight, which reduces the amount 
of active working muscle. If a man and a woman do 
the same kind and amount of work, the expenditure of 
energy to accomplish the task will be as great for the 
woman as for the man. We shall not fall into any 
serious error then in appl3dng to women the same 
table already used for calculating the fuel requirements 
of men.

The daily requirement for the average woman in some of

Women's appetites tend to be more fickle than men's, 
perhaps partly due to the fact that in the past they have 
not had very high ideals of health and have not made 
themselves lead such lives as to produce good steady 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT WOMAN 77 

appetites. They have stayed too much indoors, taken too 
little systematic exercise, and been confined too closely to 
one environment, to get that nervous and muscular poise 
which brings good tone to the alimentary tract and hence 
a healthy appetite. With the general improvement in the 
health of women, which is already remarked by careful 
observers, we are getting far from the "ladylike" notion 
of Janice Meredith and her kind that it would be a dis- 
grace to let a man see one really relish food, and are rec- 
ognizing the inevitable connection between the machine 
and its source of energy. Eating is primarily a duty ; na- 
ture has graciously made it also a physiological and social 
pleasure for most people ; but whether she has or not, the 
duty remains, and science steps in to guide when the 
palate fails as a monitor of health. For women perhaps 
more than for men is appetite apt to be perverted and a 
knowledge of food values of constant practical use. 

The following food plans and dietaries are suggestive 
of ways of supplying suitable fuel for active and seden- 
tary women.

FOOD FOR THE ADLXT WOMAN 83 

Thin and Fat Women 

FAT WOMEN 

To eat out of proportion to one's need, either on the 
side of meagerness or superfluity, is culpable. Tables 
of normal weight for age and height should be consulted 
and effort made to maintain an approximately normal 
weight.^ If ordinary eating habits result in this, as they 
should, we may rest assured that the diet is satisfactory 
as to quantity of fuel ; if not, some attention should be 
given to the matter. The tendency to take on extra 
fat is apparently greater in women than men, and should 
be especially watched if hereditary. The only sure and 
healthful way to prevent it is to be abstemious in food. 
A pound of body fat means the storage of some 4000 
Calories. The time to adjust the diet is when the tend- 
ency to store fat begins to appear. Once a great excess 
has accumulated, the problem of its removal without 
harm becomes more complicated ; and extensive "reduc- 
ing" should be carried on only under the supervision of a 
physician who can regulate the rate of fat loss according 
to the general health. But in the early stages of grow- 
ing fat, careful weighing of food or " counting the Calo- 
ries" will prove effectual and safe, but must be per- 
sisted in, perhaps throughout life. Suggestions in re- 
gard to the choice of food have already been given 
in Chapter III, but a dietary whose total fuel value 
is more likely to meet a woman's requirements is given 
below.

FOOD FOR THE ADULT WOMAN 85 

TBIN WOMEN 

Women of nervous temperament are apt to be too 
thin. They expend much energy in heightened mus- 
cular tension, and nervous disturbances quickly react on 
the alimentary tract, making it difficult to take or digest 
sufficient food. Only an intelligent persistence in taking 
regularly a supply of food in excess of immediate needs 
will result in a gain of weight. The removal, as far as 
possible, of nervous excitement or irritation and avoid- 
ance of great muscular exertion, limiting exercise to the 
hghter forms, are great helps in adjusting the balance 
between intake and outgo of energy. Food must be 
taken regardless of appetite, and often also regardless 
of minor digestive disturbances, for these do not neces- 
sarily signify that food is not going to be utilized finally. 
At the same time it is wise to choose food which can be 
taken without repugnance and which will digest with 
the greatest ease. Fluid foods are most easily taken 
when appetite fails, and make practical additions to the 
usual diet. Milk, which is so valuable a food, can be 
taken in many forms : hot, cold, with added cream 
or milk sugar, or both ; in cocoa and chocolate ; in sher- 
bets and ice creams ; as buttermilk, zoolak or kumiss ; 
so that it is one of the easiest foods to add to the diet. 
Fruit juices from sweet fruits, or with their fuel value 
artificially increased by the addition of milk sugar, make 
agreeable and nutritious beverages.^ Raw eggs are 
easily swallowed and give a good return for the effort 

^ See Lactose Lemonade, Table III, Appendix, p. 360. 



86 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

made, whether taken plain or modified by being beaten 
up with milk, cream, or fruit juice. A little study of 
food values should make it possible to find acceptable 
ways of increasing the fuel intake. Three glasses of 
milk, added to the regular diet, will mean an increase of 
500 or more Calories; an extra pat of butter taken at 
each meal will add 300 Calories. From one to three 
tablespoons of olive oil may be taken after each meal, 
increasing the fuel intake from 300 to 900 Calories. 
Very often the easiest way to increase the food intake 
is by one or two additional meals, e.g., mid-morning and 
mid-afternoon lunches, or a morning lunch and a glass 
of milk or other nourishing beverage just before going 
to bed. This is especially true for women whose work 
is exhausting, so that they come to their regular meals 
"too tired to eat." It is hard to fatten an overworked 
person, but even a slight surplus over immediate needs, 
if persistently taken, will in time have its favorable effect 
on the general health and especially on the nervous 
system. To get the best results, considerable increases 
in the food intake should be maintained, with just 
enough exercise to promote a good appetite. One ex- 
ample of a fattening diet has already been given;* 
another, approximating a little more closely the average 
requirement of a woman, is presented on the next page. 

The Protein and Ash Requirement 

Just as the laws which control energy requirement 
operate in the same way for women as for men, so the

requirements for protein and ash differ little for the two 
sexes under ordinary conditions. A woman requiring 
eight-tenths as much fuel as a man will probably need 
eight-tenths as much calcium and phosphorus and from 
two to two and one-half protein Calories per pound. 
She will probably need more iron because of the extra 
loss of this element in menstruation. Hence it is wise 
to see that the iron-bearing foods are supplied liberally. 
Fortunately salads of green vegetables and fruits are well 
Uked by most women and constitute an easy way of 
introducing iron into the diet.^ 

Food for the Prospective Mother 

Traditions in regard to food have a strong hold on 
the imagination in connection with those periods during 
which the unborn child or nursing infant derives its 
sustenance directly from its mother. Stuffing when 
food needs are not greatly increased, attributing mys- 
terious influences to specific food materials, and supply- 
ing inadequate fuel when food needs are really very much 
increased are common errors due to lack of knowledge 
of the fate and function of foods. 

It is reassuring for the prospective mother to remem- 
ber that all food is broken down in the chemical processes 
of digestion and reorganized in the body according to 
its needs. Meat helps to build muscle, not because it is 
already in that form, but because when digested it 
3delds amino acids (page 19) which the body can recom- 

^ See discussion of phosphorous, calcium, and iron contents of foods, 
pages 21-25. 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT WOMAN 89 

bine into its own kinds of protein ; the proteins of milk 
and eggs, and many of the proteins of vegetables will 
yield exactly the same kind of amino acids and hence 
serve equally well for constructing new muscle. Nature 
tries to promote normal development of the offspring 
even under adverse conditions; if materials for the 
growth of the baby are lacking in the food they will be 
drawn as far as possible from the mother's body. Thus 
if the diet be deficient in calcium and phosphorus for 
bone formation the mother's bones and teeth are Ukely 
to be the first to suffer loss, though, of course, a great 
scarcity is eventually likely to affect the baby. 

For the most part, the same kinds of food which are 
well adapted to the mother under ordinary conditions 
will serve for the mother and child. Simple dishes, 
prepared from easily digested foods, should be adhered 
to for the sake of good digestion, without which any food 
will fail of its purpose. When the digestive tract is 
particularly irritable, considerable care must be exer- 
cised in this respect, bearing in mind that fatigue, anx- 
iety, and constipation may be large factors in indiges- 
tion. The majority of mothers suffer in the early 
stages of gestation from nutritional disturbances fa- 
miliarly spoken of as "morning sickness." The cause 
of the nausea and vomiting at this time is not in the 
stomach itself, but is due to the fact that the connec- 
tion between the mother and the embryo through the 
placenta is not yet perfectly estabUshed, and a mild 
form of poisoning results from substances produced in 
the process of placenta formation getting into the general 



90 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

circulation. The disappearance of the morning sick- 
ness is an indication that the connection between mother 
and child which secures nourishment for the embryo 
from the mother's blood has been fully established, and 
from this time on the mother's appetite should steadily 
improve. Any special food requirements on the part 
of the developing child before the end of the fourth 
month of gestation have been shown to be practically 
negligible. Beginning with the fifth month, growth is 
increasingly rapid up to the time of birth, but the actual 
amount of building material needed day by day is not 
very large, nor even in the last weeks will the energy 
demands be increased more than 20 per cent, or one- 
fifth of the mother's usual daily supply. A woman 
of sedentary habits will then need from 2400 to 2800 
Calories per day, while a woman who is usually active 
will probably be somewhat less so, and is seldom likely 
to require over 3cxx3 Calories. The increased require- 
ments for building material will be best met by the 
liberal use of milk and eggs, supplemented by fruit and 
green vegetables. Frequent small meals are often util- 
ized to better advantage than a few large meals in the last 
two or three months ; in fact, most of the suggestions 
which have already been given in regard to a fattening diet 
will be helpful in adjusting the food intake at this time. 

The day's diet should include : 

I. A cereal made from the whole grain, as rolled or 
cracked oats or wheat, wheatena, barley, puffed wheat ; 
these to be served as breakfast cereals thoroughly cooked, 
or in simple puddings. 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT WOMAN 91 

2. Milk, from a pint to a quart or more per day. 
This may be used as a beverage with meals, or between 
meals, or employed in making cocoa, custards, and other 
dishes. Sweet milk may be replaced by buttermilk, zoo- 
lak, malted milk, kumiss, etc., according to preference. 

3. Fruit, as oranges, apples, prunes, raisins, figs, 
dates, or other easily digested kinds, fresh or dried, 
cooked or raw. Fruit juices may be substituted for the 
whole fruit, especially where digestion is disturbed. 

4. A green vegetable, as spinach, peas, beans, lettuce, 
celery, cabbage, onions, etc. These may be served as 
salads, buttered, creamed, or in soups. When cooked, 
the cooking water should be used if possible, because it 
contains a large part of the ash constituents. Pea and 
spinach soups made with milk are often useful when 
digestion is poor. 

5. Meat, fish, or some substitute such as eggs or 
cheese, once a day. 

6. Butter, olive oil, bacon, peanut butter, or oleo- 
margarine in moderate quantities to add to the fuel 
value of the diet. For the sake of ease of digestion, 
these are best used in their simplest form, on bread, with 
potatoes, rice and the like, rather than in the making of 
rich sauces and gravies. The food plan already given 
for a sedentary woman can easily be modified to yield 
2700 to 2800 Calories by adding a pint of milk, a couple 
of eggs, two small tablespoons of butter, and a piece 
of sweet chocolate. The food plan and dietary for an 
active woman will be suitable when digestion is good, 
and the fuel value can be easily increased by the use of

desirable increases in building material.

Food for the Nursing Mother 

It has been shown by calorimetric experiments that 
the total energy requirement of mother and child just 
after birth is almost exactly the same as the total re- 
quirement just before birth. But the normal healthy 
baby grows rapidly and makes increasing demands upon 
his food supply. A baby a month old will take, on the 
average, two and one-third ounces of mother's milk per 
day for each pound of body weight, a twelve-pound child 
thus receiving about 28 ounces of milk in twenty-four 
hours. Since an ounce of mother's milk yields on the 
average 20 Calories, the total day's fuel supply for such 



94 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

a child will be 560 Calories. But making milk is hard 
work ; it is believed that about two Calories of extra food 
are necessary to produce one of milk, so that the above 
daily milk supply will demand an addition of some 11 20 
Calories to the mother's ordinary energy intake, or in 
general we may make the following estimates of the 
increased requirement: 

Additional fuel requirements for nursing a baby 

First 3 months . . 90 Calories per pound of infant's weight 

Second 3 months . 85 Calories per pound of infant's weight 

Third 3 months . . 80 Calories per pound of infant's weight 

Fourth 3 months . 70 Calories per pound of infant's weight 

This means that a woman of average weight and 
sedentary occupation will require while nursing a baby 
as much food as a laboring man doing moderately heavy 
muscular work, i.e., 3000 to 3500 Calories per day; 
while a woman at the same time employed in moder- 
ately active physical labor will need as much as a man 
doing severe muscular work, or from 3500 to 40CK) 
Calories per day. 

Not only is there this marked increase in the energy 
requirement, but the construction of milk demands 
extra quantities of such important materials as protein, 
calcium, phosphorus, and even iron. Studies with cows 
show that the efficiency of milk protein for the produc- 
tion of a new milk supply is about 60 per cent. Such 
data indicate that the mixed diet ought to supply at 
least two protein Calories for each one withdrawn in the 
mother's milk, and milk itself must be considered one 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT WOMAN 95 

of the most desirable foods for milk production. On 
this basis, from three to four protein Calories should be 
allowed for every ounce of milk produced. 

For a woman supplying 28 ounces of milk per day, 
there should be an increase over the average consump- 
tion of 17 per cent in iron, 20 per cent in phosphoric 
acid, and 76 per cent in calcium oxide. In other words, 
the most marked increase as regards ash is in the calcium 
requirement. This again is most easily met by milk, 
and also most economically, considering that milk sup- 
plies at the same time efficiently used protein. Two 
hundred Calories of milk in addition to the ordinary 
mixed diet will cover the extra requirement for calcium 
and phosphorus for 28 ounces of human milk, while 50 
Calories of lean beef, 10 of spinach, or one egg yolk will 
meet the additional need for iron. This shows that with 
a little care in the selection of foods there need be no 
danger of shortage of these important elements. 

The general plan of diet suggested for the prospective 
mother^ may be followed by the nursing mother and 
the dietaries for thin men and women ^ will be sug- 
gestive as to how to keep up the fuel value of the 
diet. Since foods are broken down in the digestive 
tract and made over in the body, it is absurd to 
think that particular foods have specific effects upon 
the character of the milk. Any wholesome diet, ample 
in fuel and building materials, is suitable for good 
milk production. At the same time it must be borne 
in mind that the mammary glands are very sensitive to 
' See page 90. * See pp. 59 and 87. 



96 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

nervous influences, and disturbances of digestion react 
very unfavorably upon the milk-secreting mechanism. 
Therefore any food which is known to disagree with the 
mother, or whose effect is doubtful, should be refrained 
from. And since the increased demands for food make 
the work of the digestive tract extraordinarily great, 
there is more danger than usual of an upset, and the diet 
should be correspondingly simpler and easier of diges- 
tion. Excitement, worry, fatigue, chill, constipation, 
all react quickly and unfavorably upon the milk secre- 
tion, and must be carefully guarded against. Successful 
nursing demands a quiet, contented life, in which food 
is carefully chosen, and exercise, fresh air, and mental 
diversion are provided in due moderation. For the 
few months which are so critical in the life of the baby, 
less important interests must be set aside, even those of 
other members of the family who can better afford a 
little neglect. 

A very simple, inexpensive dietary, adapted to the 
fuel requirements of the nursing mother also engaged in 
physical labor, from one of the menus on page 92, is 
given below. 

In addition to regular meals, a glass or bowl of hot 
milk, malted milk, gruel or eggnog taken just before 
nursing the baby in mid-morning or mid-afternoon is 
often beneficial.

CHAPTER V 

FOOD FOR THE BABY 

Happy the baby who enjoys his inalienable right to 
Nature's food supply — his own mother's milk ! His 
chances of a long and healthy hfe are immensely greater 
than those of the poor child who has to be artificially 
fed. In case of misfortune depriving him of his natural 
food supply, the best substitute is the milk of some other 
healthy woman with a baby of approximately the same 
age, but unfortunately this kind of substitute is not 
readily commanded by the average family, and the 
faithful cow has usually to be relied upon when the 
normal supply is cut off. That such a substitute is far 
from ideal, statistics make perfectly clear. A study of 
nearly 50,000 babies born alive in Berlin in 1890 showed 
that about one-fourth of these were dead at the end of 
the first year, of whom one in two was bottle-fed and 
only one in 13 breast-fed. That the baby not only has 
a better chance of surviving the perilous first year, but 
of growing to manhood as well, was made evident in a 
hygiene exhibition recently held in Dresden, in which it 
was shown that in 24 families with 109 children, all 
breast-fed, not one was dead at the end of five years ; 
while in 33 families in which the babies were all bottle-

FOOD FOR THE BABY 99 

fed one or more had been lost in each family in the same 
period. In another group of 79 families, in which 85 of 
the children were breast-fed and 109 bottle-fed, all the 
breast-fed children were alive at the end of eleven years, 
while more than half (57 %) of the bottle-fed babies 
were dead. In a study recently made in New York City 
of the relative danger to babies of dirt, flies, and artificial 
feeding, it was quite evident that artificial feeding was, of 
the three, the worst enemy to baby life. Such evidence 
makes clear the importance of a mother's making every 
effort to start the baby right and give him a fair chance 
to live and thrive. Every month of breast feeding is to 
be regarded as so much gain for the baby. If the milk 
supply is insufficient, it may be necessary to give addi- 
tional food, but this does not justify the discarding of the 
natural food so far as it is available. Only when it fails 
entirely, or there is some serious disturbance of the 
mother's health which makes nursing unwise, or when 
there is persistent failure on the part of the baby to 
digest the milk, should artificial feeding be adopted as 
the sole means of sustenance. 

Good breast feeding cannot be done carelessly, how- 
ever. The mother must take the best possible care of 
herself, eating wholesome food in sufficient amounts, as 
outlined in Chapter IV; leading a regular, hygienic, 
peaceful life as far as she is able, in order to maintain a 
full and uniform milk supply. She must keep in mind 
that upon her rests the responsibility for the healthy 
development of her baby ; must avoid indigestible food, 
or food that spoils her appetite so as to prevent suffi- 



lOO FEEDING THE FAMILY 

dent quantities of food being taken ; must have regulai 
hours for meals and rest; get fresh air and exercise, 
but avoid fatigue and overwork; keep her mind 
pleasurably occupied while avoiding excitement; and, 
finally, she must feed the baby according to a definite 
schedule. 

A healthy baby grows fast. During the first six 
months he should double his birth weight, and by the 
end of the year triple it. He must not only digest food 
for this rapid body building, but he must have energy 
for the daily maintenance of his internal and external 
body activities besides, the result being that he has to 
take care of much more food in proportion to his weight 
than an adult does, and any upset in digestion is a very 
serious matter. Hence, anything in the mother's life 
which might disturb her steady production of whole- 
some milk must be avoided, and anything in the baby's 
life which might cause indigestion. He must have 
plenty of sleep and be allowed to lie quietly by himself 
when awake, have plenty of fresh air to breathe and 
clothing which will give him a chance to exercise his 
arms and legs freely, so that he need not get all of his 
exercise by crying. Above all, he must get his meals 
regularly. With definite hours for feeding, the quality 
of the milk is more uniform, and the baby's alimentary 
tract responds better to the food. The stomach needs 
an interval of rest between meals, and the secretions of 
the alimentary tract are strongly influenced by habit, 
pouring out more freely under the stimulus of regular 
feeding. The appetite is less fickle, too, when meals 



FOOD FOR THE BABY 



lOI 



come at definite times. "Meals by the clock" is one 
of the first rules of successful feeding. 

What the schedule shall be depends somewhat upon 
circumstances. Probably the best practice' up to the 
time a child is three months old is to feed every three 
hours through the day and once at night — seven feed- 
ings in the twenty-four hours ; e.g. at six and nine a.m., 
noon, three, six, and nine p.m., and midnight. After 
the child is three months old no night feeding need be 
given imless the baby wakens. From the fourth to the 
sixth month there may be six feedings, three and one- 
half hours apart; six and nine-thirty a.m., one, four- 
thirty, and eleven- thirty p.m., and after that five feed- 
ings ; six and ten a.m., two, six, and ten p.m.

If the baby is delicate, shorter intervals between 
feedings are sometimes prescribed, but never less than 
two hours ; if very sturdy, four-hour intervals are some- 
times adopted at the very start. Such schedules should 
be arranged under tbe advice of a competent physician. 
Strict observance of the schedule determined upon is 
more important than the exact interval between feedings 



102 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

or the number of feedings in the day, but in generai 
long intervals promote good digestion better than do 
short ones. 

If the baby frets between meals he should be given 
cool (not cold) boiled water from a bottle or spoon — 
nothing else. Pacifiers are to be strictly avoided. They 
spoil the shape of the mouth and are bad carriers of 
germs; the constant sucking is undesirable for many 
reasons and swallowing air causes gastric discomfort. 

After meals the baby should be placed upright and 
patted very gently for a moment or two to bring up 
the "gas" (generally air) which he may have swallowed, 
then laid in his crib to rest quietly and soon go to sleep. 
His chief business in life is to grow. He is not to be 
considered a source of entertainment, nor should efforts 
be made to amuse him. The healthy baby when awake 
will play quietly by himself and not get over-excited nor 
exhausted. 

The Energy Requirements of the Baby 

The baby requires fuel for his life processes just as an 
adult does, but these processes are more rapid in the 
child than in the adult, so that even when lying quietly 
he needs more fuel in proportion to his weight than he 
will require later in Ufe. From calorimetric studies it 
has been found that babies asleep in bed beside their 
mothers, who were awake, give off nearly two and one- 
half times as many Calories per pound as the mothers. 
An allowance of from 30 to 35 Calories per pound is 
necessary merely to keep a baby alive. 



FOOD FOR THE BABY 103 

Babies cannot lie quietly all the time, however. If 
they are to grow and acquire strong muscles they 
must have exercise, which they get by crying, kicking, 
pounding with their fists, and other movements. This 
means work, requiring a further supply of energy. A 
five-months-old baby has been shown to double his 
energy expenditure by the effort of crying. Active 
children really work as hard as any adult manual 
laborer. 

Furthermore, a baby is constantly storing food ma- 
terials in his body in the process of growth. Every 
day as much as 12 to 15 per cent of the Calories 
represented in his food may be used in this way. 
All the energy demands of the baby — (i) for the main- 
tenance of life processes, more rapid than in the adult, 
(2) for muscular activity, often great, and (3) for stor- 
age in growth — make the infant's total energy require- 
ment during the first three months of his life about 50 
Calories per pound per day. As he grows older, the 
requirement for internal activities becomes gradually 
less in proportion to body weight, the rate of growth 
falls, and therefore the total requirement for the second 
three months is about 45 Calories per pound per day; 
for the third three months about 40 Calories per pound 
per day, and for the last three months of the first year 
about 35 Calories per pound per day. 

In the case of the breast-fed baby, we judge the feed- 
ing to be successful when he makes steady gains in 
weight, averaging about eight ounces a week in the early 
months, and falling gradually to about four ounces a 



I04 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

week; and when by quiet sleep, absence of fretfulness, 
and other signs of health he shows that his diet agrees 
with him. 

Artificial Feeding 

Unfortunately there will always be some babies de- 
prived more or less completely of their natural food. 
Mothers with the best of intentions sometimes fail to 
produce milk, or furnish an inadequate supply, and other 
causes may rob the baby of his birthright. For such 
children a substitute for the natural food must be pro- 
vided. Nothing can take the place of milk for this pur- 
pose, even though it be milk from another species of 
animal, such as the cow. Milk contains everything 
needed for growth, and while the proportions of building 
materials vary with the natural rate of growth of the 
species, — milk for the puppy that doubles its weight in 
nine days having more protein and ash per quart than 
milk for the calf that doubles its weight in 47 days, and 
this in turn having more building materials per quart 
than milk for the human baby that doubles his weight 
in 180 days, — the main point is that these substances 
are present in forms which the human child can use 
better than any others, provided he can be made to 
digest the strange food. 

The ordinary problem in artificial feeding is, there- 
fore, one of adapting cow's milk to the digestive tract 
of the baby and at the same time providing, as far as 
possible, a normal supply of fuel and building material. 
There are many special devices by which these objects 



FOOD FOR THE BABY 



105 



can be attained, and the wise physician adopts the one 
which seems best suited to the individual case. For 
home use, when there is no expert to direct the feeding, 
the simplest plan is to take rich, well-mixed, whole 
milk, containing from four to five per cent of fat, and 
prepare it according to the following scheme : ^ 



Scheme for Whole Milk Feeding During the First Year 
ist day I to 2 ounces of water every 4 hours. 

2d to 4th days 3 ounces of milk, 7 ounces of water, 2 teaspoon- 
fuls of milk sugar,'^ divided into 7 feedings. 

5th to 7th days 4 ounces of milk, 8 ounces of water, 3 teaspoon- 
fuls of milk sugar, divided into 7 feedings.

of 3d month water, and if tablespoonfuls of milk sugar, 

increase the milk by § oimce every four days ; 
the water by | ounce every eight days ; the 
milk sugar by ^ tablespoonful every 2 weeks. 
Thus on the i6th day give 6 ounces of milk, 
105 ounces of water, 2 tablespoonfuls of milk 
sugar, divided into 7 feedings ; on the 20th 
day increase the milk to 6| ounces, using

the milk by 5 ounce every 6 days, reduce the 
water by 5 ovmce every 2 weeks, using 4^ table- 
spoonfuls of milk sugar per day. 
If the food does not digest readily, barley 

water may be used instead of the plain water. 

It is made by cooking ^ tablespoonful of barley 

flour in the water for 20 minutes and cooUng 

before adding to the milk. 

Beginning of 7th At the end of the 6th month the baby will be 
month to end receiving about 24 ounces of milk, 12 ounces 
of Qth month of water, and 4^ tablespoonfuls of mUk sugar 
daily, divided into 5 feedings. Now increase 
the milk by J ounce every week, reduce the 
water by 5 ounce every 2 weeks, and reduce 
the milk sugar to 3 tablespoonfuls per day. 
Midway between two of the morning feedings 
give from i to 2 tablespoonfuls of strained 
orange juice. This helps to keep the bowels 
in good condition and serves as a safeguard 
against scurvy when pasteurized milk is fed 
exclusively. If barley flour has not been used 
earUer, it may be advantageously introduced 
during this period, cooking ij tablespoonfuls 
of the flour with the water for the day, and 
gradually increasing to 3 tablespoonfuls. 

Beginning of At the end of the 9th month the child will be 

loth month receiving about 30 ounces of milk, 8 ounces 

to end of of water cooked with 3 tablespoonfuls of bar- 

12th month ley flour, 3 tablespoonftds of milk sugar, given 

in 5 feedings, and from i to 2 tablespoonfuls 

of orange juice between two morning meals. 

Now increase the milk i ounce per month, 

decrease the milk sugar i tablespoonful per 

month, and add barley gruel made with 3 

tablespoonfuls of barley flour cooked in 8 



FOOD FOR THE BABY 107 

ounces of water. Continue the use of the 
orange juice, which may be increased to 3 
tablespoonfuls if the bowels are not loose. 
After one feeding, the soft yolk of an egg may 
be fed warm, with a spoon, or a small piece of 
stale bread crust be given to chew. No other 
foods should be given during the first year. 

If the baby is much above average weight he may 
require a little more food than that provided in the pre- 
ceding plan. For the first eight months he should average 
one and one-half ounces of milk for every pound of body 
weight per day, and from then till the end of the first 
year from one and one-third to one and one-fourth ounces 
per pound per day. This insures adequate protein for 
body building. 

Dilution with water is the simplest means of making 
milk easier of digestion, but this brings down the fuel 
value of the food as taken by the baby, whose capacity 
is limited by the size of his stomach and the ne- 
cessity for time between meals to digest his food. Since 
cow's milk is richer in protein in proportion to fat 
and carbohydrate than human milk, some of the fuel 
value can be regained by the addition of milk sugar 
throughout the nursing period, and after the first 
two or three months by barley or other cereal gruel, 
without increasing the difficulty of digestion. In fact, 
the use of barley water in the first three months is 
primarily to make digestion easier. The suggested 
schedule, outlined above, will supply fuel per day as 
follows : 



io8 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

At the end of the first month .... 30 Calories per pound 

At the end of the third month .... 41 Calories per pound 

At the end of the sixth month .... 43 Calories per pound 

At the end of the ninth month .... 40 Calories per pound 

The addition of orange juice, barley flour, and egg 
yolk will raise the fuel value from the sixth month to 
the end of the nursing period to about 45 Calories per 
pound. 

Comparing these figures with the baby's actual energy 
requirements,^ it is noticeable at once that the food 
supply during the first month is far below what a normal 
baby gets when taking mother's milk, and is barely 
enough to supply his daily needs for energy, with little 
or no surplus for gain in weight. But it is absolutely 
essential that the baby digest his food if it is to do him 
any good, and it is unwise to overtax his stomach while 
he is getting used to the artificial food. Hence we must 
increase the strength of the feedings gradually and try 
to make up later for these early deficiencies. After the 
first two weeks if digestion is good, the fuel value might 
be raised by increasing the milk one-half ounce every three 
instead of every four days up to the end of the third 
month, after which the energy supply is adequate for 
normal growth. Very rapid increase in weight is to be 
regarded as a doubtful good, especially on artificial 
food; small, steady gains are less likely to be followed 
by nutritional disturbance later. 

Another way of raising the fuel value of diluted whole 
milk is by increasing the proportion of fat. Healthy

babies are very successfully fed by starting with milk 
which is richer than the whole cow's milk. A quart 
bottle of milk is allowed to stand five or more hours for 
the cream to rise, and then the richer milk from the top 
is removed ounce by ounce by means of a Chapin dipper, 
the required quantity thoroughly mixed, diluted as 
desired, and milk sugar or malt food added. This is 
known as the Top Milk Method. A series of progressive 
formulas, illustrating the use of this method, is given

At the end of the 6th month .... 45 Calories per pound 

At the end of the 9th month .... 43 Calories per pound 

For the remainder of the first year the feedings will 
follow the directions already given on page 106. 

No scheme of feeding can be followed slavishly. 
Babies show individuahty in their capacity for food as 
in other respects; frail babies cannot be advanced to 
stronger food and larger quantities as fast as hardy 
ones. When in doubt, go slowly. Overfeeding is as 
harmful as underfeeding — so far as the digestive 
system is concerned, it is likely to be more so. When 
signs of indigestion appear, it is well to reduce the 
strength of the food temporarily. The two types of 
feeding schedule given illustrate the general principles 
of all successful artificial feeding : 

Regular meal times ; 

Gradual increases in strength and amount of food ; 
Giving less than the full energy requirement at first, and maJdng 
up the deficiency later ; 



112 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Supplementing the iron in the milk by egg yolk (and orange juice) 

as the normal time of weaning approaches ; 
Giving orange juice to prevent constipation and possible scurvy ; 
Using barley flour made into gruel to promote ease of digestion, 

primarily in the early months; to add also to the food value 

of the diet in the later months. 

Care of the Baby's Food 

Only clean milk should be bought. Fresh milk is 
best when one can be sure that every precaution has 
been taken to keep it clean and cold and free from harm- 
ful or excessive bacteria. Nature provides fresh sterile 
milk for the young; if they are deprived of this, it is 
their right to have the best obtainable substitute. 
"Laboratory" and "certified" milk are guaranteed to 
be wholesome. In the country, one should know the 
conditions under which the milk is produced, and buy 
only that which is clean and kept cold from the time of 
milking. Pasteurized milk must be used when there is 
danger of contamination, but pasteurized milk has 
changed somewhat by heating and if used exclusively 
should be supplemented as early as possible by orange 
juice, as a precaution against scurvy. Sometimes it is 
necessary to use boiled milk, to avoid all possible danger 
of bacterial poisoning, but if its use is long continued, 
it is even more important that some uncooked food be 
added to the diet. 

All milk must be protected from contamination at 
home ; kept in a cold place and covered. Food for the 
baby should be made up for one day at a time, each meal 
put into a clean feeding bottle (washed with hot soda 



FOOD FOR THE BABY 113 

water and boiled in clear water for twenty minutes), 
stoppered and kept cold till used. Just before feeding 
it can be warmed in hot water. Any food left over 
should be thrown away. A thermos bottle should 
never be used to keep the milk warm. Germs are Hkely 
to grow in the milk under such conditions and it may 
make the baby sick. Nipples must be thoroughly 
scrubbed inside with soda water after use, and kept in a 
covered bowl of borax water, ready for use. 

If there is the least doubt about the quality of the 
milk, it should be pasteurized at home. The feeding 
bottles can be set in a wire rack and this in a deep sauce- 
pan, full of cold water. When the water boils, the pan 
is to be removed from the stove, but the bottles left 
standing in the hot water twenty minutes, after which 
they should be cooled as rapidly as possible with cold 
water and placed on ice. 

Use of Proprietary Infant Foods 

In spite of all one may say about the value of clean, 
fresh cow's milk, properly prepared, for the baby, the 
mother's faith is often shaken by glowing advertisements 
of patent infant foods and she is tempted by their con- 
venience to give credence to their flaunted virtues. In 
composition they differ widely, some of them consisting 
of dried milk mixed with a certain amount of sugar, or 
dextrin and maltose, to be used with water without 
cooking; others consisting of dried milk mixed with 
sugar and baked wheat flour, to be used with water but 
requiring cooking ; and a large group made chiefly from 



114 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

wheat or barley flour, sometimes simply baked and 
sometimes more or less completely changed into dextrin 
and maltose; none of these last should be used as a 
steady diet without the addition of milk. 

It becomes evident at once that such foods cannot be 
used intelligently without information as to their com- 
position. It is impossible to make the necessary adap- 
tation of food to the growth of the individual baby 
simply by following directions on the label of a box of 
food. Those not requiring the addition of milk are to 
be criticized because they deprive the baby of fresh 
food, and because they often contain but little fat and 
ash, while they have a very high percentage of carbo- 
hydrate. This means that the baby may have his fuel 
needs met without getting proper building material ; the 
result is an increase in weight, often beyond the normal, 
as a result of the high carbohydrate feeding. The body 
stores water and fat instead of building muscle and bone, 
looks fat but succumbs quickly in case of illness, losing 
weight with great rapidity ; and is liable to trouble from 
soft or brittle bones, which have to bear too much 
weight for their strength. 

The foods designed to be used with milk serve the 
same useful purpose as plain barley or other cereal 
flour made into gruel, provided sufiicient quantities of 
milk are used. Those which are dextrinized are conven- 
ient because they go into solution readily, but barley 
can be easily dextrinized at home with any reliable 
preparation of diastase, and usually at much less 
expense. 



FOOD FOR THE BABY 115 

Food after Weaning 

K the baby has had the good fortune to be nursed 
by his mother, the problems of preparing other food for 
him are delayed normally until about the ninth month, 
and if the mother is strong and well and the baby thriv- 
ing, even to the twelfth month. Nursing after the end 
of the first year is seldom desirable unless to avoid wean- 
ing in hot weather. The quality of the milk is apt to 
deteriorate, and the baby begins to need iron in larger 
quantities than furnished in milk. He comes into the 
world with a special store of this precious material of 
growth — three times as much being found in his body 
in proportion to his weight as in the full-grown adult. 
But by the end of the first year, having tripled his original 
weight, and having received only a very small daily 
supply of iron in his milk, he needs to have this diet 
supplemented by such easily digested iron-bearing foods 
as yolk of egg and orange juice. The period from the 
ninth to the fifteenth month may be regarded as one of 
transition from mother's milk to other food. The best 
substitute with which to begin is cow's milk. This will 
not tax the baby's digestive tract as severely as it would 
have in the very early months of his Hfe; still, it is a 
strange food, and care must be taken to make it easy 
of digestion. For this reason it should be diluted, pref- 
erably with barley gruel, and following the directions 
for artificial feeding of a baby one or two months younger 
(page 106). If possible, weaning should be done gradu- 
ally, giving at first one feeding from a bottle in place of 



ii6 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

a nursing, and increasing the number of bottle feedings 
until the baby is entirely weaned at eleven or twelve 
months. This means less shock to his digestive system 
than if his food be suddenly changed entirely. When 
the baby digests the diluted milk well, the amount of 
gruel can be gradually decreased and a tablespoonful or 
two of strained cereal be given with a spoon twice a day. 
Most children can digest plain whole milk by the end 
of the first year if weaning has begun in the ninth or 
tenth month. If at all possible, weaning in the 
summer time should be avoided, as change of food 
is likely to cause some digestive disturbance which will 
be increased by the hot weather, and market milk in hot 
weather is seldom in quite so good condition as in cold. 
As soon after the eight or ninth month as the baby be- 
comes accustomed to taking cow's milk, he should be 
given from one to three tablespoonfuls of strained fruit 
juice once a day unless he has trouble with loose bowels. 
By the time he is ten months old he may have a soft 
egg yolk to give him iron, and a small piece of stale bread 
crust or zwiebach to chew, immediately after his milk 
feeding. 

At the end of the fijst year, whether a baby be breast 
or bottle fed, he should have reached the point where he 
drinks plain warm cow's milk from a bottle,^ taking 
about one quart a day, one to three tablespoonfuls of 
strained, mild fruit juice once a day, the yolk of an egg 

1 The bottle is preferable to the cup, because the child will drink more 
slowly and the mother can tell more accurately just how much he has 
taken. 



I 



FOOD FOR THE BABY 117 

about once a day, two or three tablespoonfuls of 
thoroughly cooked, strained cereal daily (given at one 
or two meals), and a piece of stale bread, crisp toast or 
zwiebach to chew at least once a day. The milk pro- 
vides the great bulk of his food. The fruit juice is partly 
to keep his bowels in order, partly to help in accustom- 
ing him to other foods besides milk, and partly to give 
him more iron than the milk affords. The cereal jelly 
serves as a good introduction to other foods which have 
to be eaten with a spoon, and also helps to keep a good 
proportion between the protein and the other fuel foods 
(fat and carbohydrate) in the diet. Cow's milk alone 
has too high a proportion of protein to be quite ideal for 
the slow-growing human child, although perfectly suited 
to the quick-growing calf. Toast or other forms of dry, 
hard bread give exercise to the jaws and help to develop 
good teeth later, while serving as a means of teaching 
the important habit of mastication. Nothing else is 
needed to keep the baby healthy and no risk of upset- 
ting his digestive tract should be run by adding other 
foods. Because a baby is not made violently ill by meat, 
tea, coffee, sweet crackers, and what not, it does not 
follow that he has not been injured. Even the perver- 
sion of his appetite, so that he does not desire the foods 
which are best for him, is a serious matter, though the 
results are not immediately apparent. 

The child's chief business in life in his early years is 
to grow strong and develop good habits. This appUes 
not only to eating, but to sleeping also. Regular hours, 
regular supplies of carefully chosen food, and plenty of 



Ii8 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

fresh air mean not only the development of sturdy legs 
and rosy cheeks, but of a strong digestive tract able to 
stand the inevitable strains of later life. Good growth 
of muscles and nerves in this part of the body cannot be 
seen directly, but they count tremendously when the 
whole life is in review. One year of good feeding at the 
beginning of Ufe is more important than ten after forty, 
and a baby's needs are not to be judged by an adult's 
incUnations. Feeding must be a matter of principle and 
not of impulse, and the reward will be partly in the 
present — much more in the future. 




A Quart of Milk a Day 



CHAPTER VI 

FOOD FOR THE TWO-YEAR-OLD CHILD 

The feeding of the baby during the first nine or ten 
months of its life is so important for its welfare that 
nature does not willingly entrust it to anyone but her- 
self. The sensitive, rapidly-growing digestive tract is 
confined to a single food material, ideally adapted to its 
needs. By the end of the year the digestive apparatus is 
ready for new tasks; teeth demand material for chew- 
ing, the body store of iron is used up, the mother's milk 
deteriorates, and there is every indication of readiness 
for more kinds of food in the diet. But we must not 
assume that the year-old child is ready for the diet of 
an adult. Statistics from cities where the mothers 
generally nurse their babies show that the mortality 
rises at the end of the first year, when the diet changes. 
The still delicate digestive tract is given tasks far too 
great for it; as if a year-old child were asked to chop 
down a tree or run a race ! The fundamental principle 
in child feeding is to develop the digestive powers gradually. 
The woes of the "second summer" and "teething" are 
very largely the result of an unwise choice of diet. To 
boast that a fifteen-months-old baby "eats everything" 
is not a tribute to its precocity, but to the ignorance or 

X19 



120 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

culpable negligence of its mother. With a carefully regu- 
lated diet, the second year is less perilous than the first. 

Feeding during the Second Year 

At the end of the first year the main part of the diet 
is cow's milk to the amount of nearly a quart a day. It 
should remain the chief staple throughout the second 
year, from three cups to a quart being given daily. 
Scientific study of milk has year by year emphasized its 
value as a food for growth ; its proteins contain nitrogen 
in ideal forms for cell and muscle building ; its fat carries 
some constituent essential to growth; its supplies of 
calcium and phosphorus are ample for bone construc- 
tion; its iron compounds although present in small 
amount are of high value ; its supply of other building 
and regulating ash constituents is liberal; and its ease 
of digestion insures utilization of these valuable elements. 
To cut down the supply of milk after the period of in- 
fancy is a great mistake; even chickens grow larger 
and healthier when milk is made a part of their diet. 
The same care to have it clean and fresh should be taken 
as in the first year. 

During the first two or three months of the second 
year, cereals in the form of gruel may still be added to 
the milk, up to about one-third of its volume. But if 
whole milk can be digested readily, it is time to give 
the cereal food separately in the form of a "jelly." 
This is made by cooking rolled oats, wheat, or other 
cereal very thoroughly (four to six hours), as for ordi- 
nary breakfast food, and then putting it through a fine 



FOOD FOR THE TWO-YEAR-OLD CHILD 121 

strainer. From one-half an ounce to an ounce of dry 
cereal cooked in this way can be given in a day, in one 
or two meals. After two or three months of strained 
cereals, the finer varieties, such as farina and wheatena, 
may be given unstrained ; and, subsequently, any thor- 
oughly cooked cereal may be fed without straining. Thus 
the principle of gradually training the digestive tract to 
take care of solid food and of food containing some in- 
digestible material (cellulose) is carried out. Preference 
should be given to cereals made from the whole grain on 
account of their richer supply of ash. Oatmeal seems to 
be one of the most valuable cereals for growth, and, unless 
there is a tendency to looseness of the bowels, it can well 
be used three or four times a week at least. These 
cereal foods should be carefully seasoned with a very 
little salt, and served with milk or thin cream, but no 
sugar. 

The use of the yolk of one egg daily, for the sake of 
its iron and phosphorus, should be continued. Once in 
a while the whole egg may be given for a change, but 
for children of this age who are getting a quart of milk 
a day the white is superfluous, as it tends to make the 
protein content of the diet very high. 

Every day some fruit juice or strained pulp should be 
given. Orange juice remains the staple, but gradually 
other kinds mild in flavor may be tried, as prune juice 
or pulp, cooked apple juice or pulp (from stewed or 
baked apples), pineapple or fresh peach juice carefully 
strained. Not more than two or three tablespoonfuls 
should be given at one time. If a new kind is being 



122 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

tried, only half the usual quantity should be given, 
diluted with half as much water. The best time to give 
the fruit is between two morning meals. Fruit is im- 
portant because it helps to counteract constipation and 
adds ash for growth. 

Before the middle of the second year the habit of 
taking some stale dry bread, zwiebach, or thoroughly 
dry toast can usually be established. The exact time 
depends on the state of development of the teeth, as the 
main purpose of this addition to the diet is to foster the 
habit of mastication, so important to the easy digestion 
of solid foods, which are to constitute a large part of 
the diet later on. If this principle is kept in mind about 
the breadstuffs, most questions in regard to suitable 
kinds will be answered. Those that offer no resist- 
ance to the teeth and jaws will be excluded. 

After the middle of the second year one green vege- 
table should be included in the diet every day. In the 
form of a dilute and thoroughly cooked soup, strained 
and mixed with milk, it is sometimes given by the end 
of the first year. But it is well to remember that the 
behavior of a new food in the alimentary tract is always 
problematical and it is unwise to experiment with more 
than one at a time. So in these early months of the 
second year, when new fruits and new cereals are being 
tried, one need not be in great haste to add vegetables. 
In any case, the amount given at first must be small 
(from one to three teaspoonfuls) ; it can be gradually 
increased as the child grows accustomed to it. The 
vegetable chosen must be mild in flavor and strained 



FOOD FOR THE TWO-YEAR-OLD CHILD 123 

after cooking. Green vegetables are introduced for the 
sake of their ash constituents and care must be taken 
that these are not thrown away in cooking. Spinach 
is richer in iron than any other vegetable, and is the 
ideal one to add first. Green peas, asparagus tips, young 
beets and carrots (if thoroughly softened in cooking) 
are practical to strain and are usually well digested by 
children. The vegetable pulp (or pulp and juice) may 
simply be salted, or a little cream may be added. Often 
they are most acceptable when made into soup with 
milk, a little flour being used for thickening. 

To recapitulate, the foods from which the two-year- 
old's dietary should be built up are the following : 

Milk (the chief article in the diet) ; 

Well-cooked cereals (at first strained, later unstrained) ; 

Fruit juice or pulp (two or three kinds, small amounts) ; 

Yolk of egg (not over one a day) ; 

Vegetable pulp or juice (a few kinds, given especially 
in the second half of the year) ; 

Stale bread or its equivalent (for training in masti- 
cation). 

These foods, in suitable amounts and at prope times, 
will supply everything essential to good nutrition during 
the second year. Greater variety is not only unneces- 
sary, but positively harmful; partly because it tempts 
the child to discard milk, and partly because of dangers 
of indigestion. Milk should remain the staple food for 
some years to come, if the child is to build firm, thick 
bones instead of spongy, thin-walled ones, and real 
muscle instead of a padding of fat and water to cover 



124 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

them; and a great variety of food, especially if highly 
flavored, is almost certain to result in a refusal of the milk. 

Just as the alimentary tract is gradually trained to 
solid foods, so it must be gradually trained to variety in 
diet. One of the commonest mistakes in feeding in the 
second year is to give too many kinds of food. The older 
members of the family must rigidly refrain from offering 
''tastes'* of their food, or in any way suggesting the 
thought of the child eating the food provided for adults. 
It is very important for him to learn early that adults' and 
children's food are not the same, any more than their 
clothing. What mother would put French-heeled slippers 
on an eigh teen-months-old baby ? Yet the same mother 
will offer her Uttle child a twenty-five-year-old's food, quite 
content with the fact that he swallows it. If he is sub- 
sequently fretful and restless — that is "bad temper" ! 

While personal traits develop early, and manifest 
likes and disUkes have to be met as best one can, it is a 
foolish notion that any whim should be allowed to con- 
trol the selection of food. What if a person disliked all 
foods containing protein? Should he be permitted to 
die of nitrogen starvation ? Food needs of the body are 
governed by scientific laws, and the more the mind is 
trained to recognize and respect these laws, the simpler 
the feeding problem becomes. The adult who is re- 
sponsible for the welfare of the child is the authority as 
to what he shall eat, and not the baby who is as yet 
but a Uttle animal with no knowledge of his own needs. 
The early inculcation of good eating habits is one of the 
most fundamental things in his training. He may, like 



FOOD FOR THE TWO-YEAR-OLD CHILD 125 

Darwin, become world famous in spite of forty-three 
years of dyspepsia, but what might not Darwin have 
accomplished if he had been able to work a whole day 
at a time, instead of only half a day ! People who offer 
to children, for whose feeding they are not responsible, 
anything to eat without express permission are vandals, 
guilty of a greater outrage than if they should tear or 
ruin their clothes. An attack of indigestion has far- 
reaching consequences in a little child ; it may retard the 
healthy development of the digestive tract itself; it 
may help to stunt growth in general; or it may so 
lower the resistance of the body to bacteria that harm- 
ful organisms gain a foothold and acute illness results. 
It pays to take the best of care in the feeding of little 
children; to give them the few simple foods that are 
best for them in an atmosphere which promotes content- 
ment with them, to prepare these with care, so that 
appetite and digestion may be fostered, and to serve 
them with unfailing regularity. When children run 
about and play actively, they need to be guarded against 
eating when exhausted or excited, and also against any 
interference with their hours for rest and sleep. 

During the second year there should be four meals a 
day; the first not earlier than 6 a.m., nor later than 
7 : 30 ; the second at 9, 10, or 10 : 30, depending on tlie 
hour for the first ; the third at i, 2, or 2 : 30 p.m. ; and 
the fourth at 5, 5 : 30, or 6 p.m. Care should be taken 
to offer water between meals. Thirstiness is often mis- 
taken for hunger. The food plan given below illus- 
trates the arrangement of a schedule for meals, and the 



126 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

dietary worked out on this plan is suited to the food 
needs of the average child of eighteen months. 

The average weight of a normal child one year old is 
from 20 to 21 pounds ; of a child two years old, 29 to 30 
pounds. Weighings should be made at frequent inter- 
vals, just as in the first year, as one test of the child's 
progress. An allowance of about 40 Calories per pound 
will cover the energy needs of the second year. Four 
protein Calories per pound will meet his need for nitrogen, 
and the selection of foods indicated will afiford an 
abundance of ash constituents.

CHAPTER VII 

FOOD FOR CHILDREN THREE AND FOUR 
YEARS OLD 

Adhering to the principle of gradual increase in the 
complexity of the diet, there will be no striking changes in 
the character of the food during this period. As children 
grow older they take an increasing interest in the appear- 
ance and flavor of food, and enjoy occasional changes in 
the form in which it is served, and even in the dishes used. 

Milk is still the basis of the diet; one quart a day 
being a suitable amount for most children. Some of the 
cream from the top of the bottle may be removed and 
used for the cereal, and a portion of the remaining milk 
used in making a vegetable soup; another portion for 
some very simple dessert, as junket, plain baked or 
boiled custard, cornstarch or gelatin blancmange, bread, 
tapioca, rice, or other cereal pudding (without raisins). 
Such a dessert can now be served once a day. The rest 
of the milk will usually be drunk (slightly warmed) ; 
but, again, part of it may be used for supper in a dish 
of bread and milk ; one of milk toast ; or with rice or 
some other cereal taking up milk readily (such as crisp 
com flakes). In this way adaptations can be made to 
the tastes of individual children without any real change 
in the character of the diet. Milk is milk whethei: 

125 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN THREE AND FOUR 129 

drunk from a cup or eaten with a spoon as rice pudding 
or delicate pink junket.^ 

One whole egg per day can now be used, though the 
yolk is still the important part from the point of view 
of the child's body needs. It may be served as a dish 
by itself at the mid-day meal, in any way in which it 
is kept soft — "boiled," poached, coddled, or shirred; in 
an omelet or cooked with milk as creamy egg, egg tim- 
bale, etc. ; but never hardened by high temperatures or 
coated with fat as in frying. Often it will be incor- 
porated into the dessert ; and sometimes instead of the 
cooked desserts children relish an "egg pudding," which 
is really an eggnog, the egg beaten up in milk and 
moderately sweetened. 

A well-cooked cereal should appear in the menu at 
least once a day. Straining being no longer necessary, 
the choice is practically unlimited, though cereals from 
the whole grains (especially oatmeal) should have the 
preference. The most important point is thoroughness of 
cooking, so that the cellulose is softened in the highest 
degree, and the flavor of the grain is developed. The 
fireless cooker is a valuable aid in the preparation of 
cereals, but care must be observed to maintain a cooking 
temperature long enough to accomplish the purpose. 
Cut oats and cornmeal in particular need more than one 
night's cooking to develop their best texture and flavor. 
And since these bland dishes are a very important part 

^ Excellent suggestions in the way of menus and recipes for young 
children may be found in " Food for Young Children," Farmers' Bul- 
letin No. 717, U. S. Department of Agriculture. 



13© FEEDING THE FAMILY 

of the little child's diet, too much emphasis cannot be 
laid upon care in their preparation. 

A cereal of different character from that usually 
served for breakfast can often be made the main dish 
for supper, rice, cornmeal, and occasionally cornflakes 
lending themselves well to this purpose. Milk or cream 
may be used freely with the cereal foods, but no sugar ; 
this should be reserved for desserts and not put on plain 
foods like cereals and bread, because sugar blunts the 
appetite so that less is likely to be eaten and children 
are apt to tire of them sooner. 

Some form of dry, rather hard bread can now be in- 
cluded in at least two meals a day, and for the sake of 
tooth and Jaw development should never be neglected. 
Most crackers are too easily softened to serv^e the pur- 
pose well, and tend to cling to the teeth, though hard, 
whole wheat crackers may be given now and then for 
variety. As long as milk is the staple in the diet, and 
eggs and fruit and vegetables can be given daily, it is 
immaterial whether the bread be white or brown. Wlien 
there is danger of lack of iron, whole wheat preparations 
should be used. 

Fruit should be given at least once a day. If digestion 
is feeble, only the fruit juices previously allowed and in 
about the same quantity (one to three tablespoonfuls) 
should be given. If the child is sturdy, mild fruits of 
delicate texture, thoroughly cooked, such as baked apples 
(pulp only), apple sauce, stewed Bartlett pears, baked or 
steamed banana, may be gradually introduced into the 
diet. All of these should be cooked with little or no 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN THREE AND FOUR 131 

sugar and only two to four tablespoonfuls given at one 
time, according to the age and the strength of the child. 

A green vegetable of mild flavor and delicate texture 
should be made a regular part of the diet, given once a 
day; it may be mashed or finely chopped instead of 
sifted, as earlier. String beans, squash, and stewed 
celery are good additions to the former Ust. Raw vege- 
tables should not be used, nor cooked ones of strong 
flavor or coarse texture. Where great economy is 
necessary, dried peas and beans may be used in soups. 
As with cereals, care in cooking is necessary to make 
green vegetables wholesome and attractive, and since 
in later life these become more and more a source of the 
indispensable ash constituents, pains should be taken 
to teach children to like them. At this period, how- 
ever, they only supplement milk, eggs, and fruit, and 
it is often better to be content if the child tastes a vege- 
table than to have a pitched battle over eating a larger 
amount. New foods are often unpopular simply because 
of their strangeness; with familiarity, the impression 
always being given that they are desirable, one can in 
time overcome many seeming aversions. 

Extra fuel can be provided by the addition of baked 
potato, which in general should be introduced as soon as 
the types of food already mentioned in suitable amounts 
do not give the full quota of energy for the day. Butter 
may also be used in moderate amounts on the bread. 

No other foods are needed to keep a normal child in 
healthy condition up to the beginning of the fifth year. 
The great temptation is to enlarge the range of foods 



132 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

too fast, and to feed the little children ac the family 
table too soon. If they must be served there, they 
should be taught to pay no regard whatever to the food 
eaten by the other members of the family. The best 
meal schedules generally insure their being fed by them- 
selves, however, which is more satisfactory in all re- 
spects; they are not tempted to cry for things they 
should not have; adults are not tempted to give them 
"tastes"; and exclusive attention can be given to their 
manner of eating, which is also important if they are to 
become civilized members of society. 

The average weight of healthy children for the third 
and fourth years is in round numbers 35 and 37^ pounds 
respectively. An allowance of from 37 to 40 Calories 
per pound will cover the energy needs of these years, 
and tliree or four protein Calories per pound will meet 
the nitrogen requirement. The food intake of individual 
children will vary considerably from any standard be- 
cause the rate of growth differs much and so does the 
muscular activity. Quite early, little boys exhibit a 
higher degree of muscular tension than little girls, so 
that even if they seem to play in much the same way 
the boy may give evidence of a larger amount of energy 
expended by a more pronounced demand for food. 
Throughout the growing period, the best way to meet 
this situation is to supply food equal to the standards 
developed by the study of many children, to watch 
weight and appetite, and to guard against possible under- 
feeding by supplying as extra fuel as much plain bread, 
milk, and cereals as the child desires. If he is really in 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN THREE AND FOUR 133 

need of food, he will eat plain bread ; if not, such food will 
not tempt him to overeat merely to please the palate. 
In no case should food be offered except at mealtime, but 
water should be given now and then between meals. 

The food plan and dietary given below illustrate the 
practical working out of the principles discussed above.

CHAPTER VIII 

FOOD FOR CHILDREN FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS 

OLD 

One day the writer sat in a restaurant for luncheon 
beside a little girl apparently about six years old. She 
was just finishing a plate of hot griddle cakes and a 
double portion of syrup, and her mother was pouring 
half of her cup of coffee into a cup for the child. As the 
meal was finished and they rose to depart, the mother 
remarked to a friend accompanying them that she was 
taking the little girl to see a doctor — "she had seemed 
languid lately." Poor child! With such a luncheon 
even a robust adult might feel "languid." Unfortu- 
nately the retribution for dietetic sins comes slowly and 
insidiously, as a rule, instead of swiftly and strikingly, 
and the connection between an abused stomach and 
"bad nerves" or "temper," or other manifestations of a 
physical constitution below par is not impressed, if it is 
even suspected. One of the interesting developments 
of the babies' health contests which have been held with 
such success in the past few years is the chagrin of 
parents who dreamed they were bringing normal if not 
prize babies to the examining experts and were startled 
into new vigilance by discovering that they did not 

I3S 



136 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

even know what a normal child really is. And one oi 
the most encouraging features of such contests is that, 
with knowledge of how a baby ought to be cared for 
put into practice, the babies low of grade one year have 
been able to capture prizes a second year. All through 
childhood weighing should be done at frequent intervals 
and tables of weight and height of normal children con- 
sulted. (See Appendix, pp. 431-433.) Due regard should 
also be given to such other evidences of good health as 
sound sleep, reasonable appetite, absence of peevish- 
ness, firm flesh, and rosy skin. And while fresh air, 
wholesome exercise, and plenty of rest must always be 
counted as factors in good nutrition, suitable food re- 
mains the most fundamental thing in the physical 
progress of the child. 

Feeding during the fifth, sixth, and seventh years 
differs Uttle from that for the fourth year, except in the 
increasing quantity required to meet the needs of the 
larger child. All the kinds of nutritive material essen- 
tial to growth have already been introduced into the 
dietary — milk, eggs, cereals, fruit, green vegetables, 
stale bread ; supplemented by butter, cream, potatoes, 
and, in certain dishes, a little sugar for extra fuel. All 
food should still be served as simply as possible. Much 
of the quart of milk which ought to be the foundation 
of the diet can be drunk ; the rest used in simple soups, 
desserts, or plain cream sauces for vegetables. For 
variety, especially on cold days, the appearance of milk 
as a beverage may be changed by heating with a little 
malted milk; by cooking with just enough cocoa to 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN FIVE TO SEVEN 137 

give color and jlavor ; or by coloring with a cereal coffee. 
The addition of a spoonful of whipped cream to one of 
these modified forms may glorify it into a very special 
treat for some birthday or holiday. No tea, coffee, or 
strong cocoa should ever be given to children. A wel- 
come addition to the simple desserts during this period 
will be various homemade frozen dishes, such as milk 
sherbets and plain ice cream. These should not be 
served oftener than once a week, being too sweet for 
staple desserts; and in very moderate quantities on 
account of their coldness. Unless one is absolutely cer- 
tain of the quaUty, ice cream purchased outside the home 
should not be given to young children. Very often it is 
made under unsanitary conditions, or kept unduly long, 
and is badly contaminated by bacteria. Icecreams 
made from thick cream are too rich for little children. 
The frozen dish should be regarded chiefly as another 
means of making milk acceptable in the dietary by a 
simple change in its form. Lemon or orange milk 
sherbet, cocoa or junket ice cream, or a plain frozen 
custard of milk and eggs are the most suitable to choose. 
Cereals should still be served without sugar, but with 
plenty of milk. The warm cooked cereal should always 
be the staple breakfast dish, oatmeal being given the 
preference. The ready-to-eat cereals should be reserved 
for supper or for especially hot days in summer; eaten 
dry and crisp instead of bread, they make a suitable 
lunch if the child is hungry in the middle of the after- 
noon; he is not likely to fail to chew such fare or to 
overeat of it. 



138 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Raw fruits, except in the form of juice, should be in- 
troduced into the diet cautiously. Perfectly ripe pears, 
peaches, and grapes, free from skins and seeds, are the 
best to experiment with, but for the most part the fruit 
should be cooked, and especially any given for supper. 
Dried fruits, such as apples, peaches, and prunes, are 
very valuable, especially when the cost must be limited. 
They all need long, slow cooking and Kttle or no added 
sugar. Dates may be stewed in a little water and put 
through a sieve to remove the coarse outer skin, then 
flavored with a little sugar and lemon juice. Bananas 
should always be cooked for young children, baked in 
their skins or steamed in a covered vessel in a very little 
water. They do not require sugar. Preserves of all 
kinds and very sweet canned fruits must be avoided. 

Green vegetables should still be cooked, and mashed 
or sifted because they are likely to be poorly masticated. 
The addition of a plain cream sauce now and then will 
give variety to the menu and add to the fuel value of 
the vegetable dish. Potatoes should always be mealy. 
Baking is the most desirable method of cooking, but 
after the fifth year, plain boiled and mashed potatoes 
are not objectionable. Fried ones must never be offered. 

The temptation to add hot breads, biscuits, rolls, 
griddle cakes, and the like must be steadily resisted. 
Only bread stale enough or hard enough to offer exer- 
cise in mastication should be given. Breadsticks, crisp 
to the center, or sippets, made by toasting narrow strips 
of bread in the oven, will be welcome for variety. 

Butter, cream, and bacon fat in moderation are valu- 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN FIVE TO SEVEN 139 

able in the child's diet. But the butter should be spread 
on bread rather than used in cooking ; cream should be 
thin and used preferably over cereals, toast, and simple 
desserts. Bacon fat may be added to baked potatoes or 
spread on bread. 

Occasionally a small serving of plain cookies, stale 
sponge cake, graham, whole wheat, or other crackers 
may be given at the end of the meal. 

With milk freely supplied and an average of one egg 
a day, there is no call for the introduction of meat into 
the diet until after a child is seven years old, and, on 
the other hand, there are several good reasons for with- 
holding it during these early years. In the first place, 
as has been already shown in Chapter II, meat is 
of aU protein foods most liable to putrefaction in the 
intestine ; and experiments indicate that the younger the 
child the more speedily these products of putrefaction 
develop when meat is fed. A somewhat analogous case 
among animals is often cited. Adult cats thrive on a 
rich meat diet, while kittens fed largely on meat are 
liable to convulsions. So children of three show more 
signs of putrefaction when meat is made a part of their 
diet than do children of six ; and these in turn are more 
liable to it than children of eight. Since milk feeding 
will cause the signs of putrefaction to disappear and meat 
protein is no better for growth than milk protein, the ad- 
vantage is decidedly with the milk rather than the meat. 

Another reason for withholding meat is that it 
naturally tends to displace milk on account of its higher 
flavor, and meat is much poorer in ash constituents than 



140 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

milk, being totally deficient in calcium, of which milk 
is the most important source. A third reason is that 
the stimulating extractives in meat, which may be quite 
useful to a jaded adult, should not be used to whip up 
the sensitive growing organism, which when healthy is 
far better off without stimulants of any kind. The two 
chief advantages of meat are that it requires mastica- 
tion and exercises the chewing apparatus and that it is 
a useful source of iron. But, as already shown, dry 
bread makes excellent chewing material, with none of 
the disadvantages of meat; and eggs and green vege- 
tables will supply iron in forms believed to be more 
useful to the child, aside from the fact that the intestinal 
putrefaction of meat seriously interferes with the utili- 
zation of its iron. Excepting the point in regard to 
mastication, what is true of meat is true of beef juice. 
Its use is best restricted to babies who for some reason 
cannot have an adequate supply of milk, egg yolk, and 
fruit juice, or who are sick enough to need a stimulant. 
Meat broths are of course merely stimulating, and their 
only possible virtue in the ordinary child's dietary is to 
induce the eating of cereals or vegetables which may be 
cooked in them, and this can usually be accomplished in 
some other way. They almost inevitably Umit the 
amount of milk taken, and therefore should be reserved 
tiU the child is older, his need of materials for growth less 
pronounced, and his total capacity for food greater. 

The average weight of normal children for the fifth, 
sixth, and seventh years and the energy requirement per 
pound of body weight per day is, in roimd numbers :

It seems advisable in these years of comparatively 
rapid growth to allow from three to four protein Calories 
per pound per day, though probably somewhat in excess 
of the actual requirement. 

The same scrupulous care in regard to regularity of 
meals must be continued. Usually breakfast will now be 
given at 7 or 7 : 30 ; a very simple lunch at 10 or 10 : 30 ; 
a substantial dinner at i or i : 30 ; and a plain supper at 
5 : 30 or 6. During this period many children begin 
going to school, and the meal schedules must be ad- 
justed to the school schedule. Especial care needs to 
be taken that breakfast be provided in time to be eaten 
without haste or fear of being late to school. And no 
child should be permitted to go to school without break- 
fast. The pangs of an empty stomach will cause him 
to feel fagged out long before the noon meal, which is 
often the next one. He will then be likely either to be 
over-hungry and eat hurriedly to the upset of his diges- 
tion, or to have lost the feeling of hunger and refuse a 
rational meal. In any case, considering the amount of 
fuel a child must take to keep his machinery going and to 
have a surplus for growth, he cannot afford to miss break- 
fast with the hope of making good the loss later in the 
day. Numerous studies of school children show that no 



142 FEEDING THE FAMILY , 

breakfast and malnutrition are commonly found together. 
The young child is fortunate if his school provides a mid- 
morning lunch, to take the place of the one which he has 
formerly enjoyed at home. This should be of the simplest 
character ; a slice of bread and butter, a glass of milk and 
a cracker, or a bowl of cereal and niiik being quite suffi- 
cient. Such good results have followed the introduction of 
these school lunches — gains in weight, improved general 
health, and better school behavior — that they are now a 
part of the regular school program in many places, and 
mothers may find that they can render useful public ser- 
vice in extending the practice where it is not in vogue.^ 
When there is no opportunity for a morning lunch, 
the dinner must be served earUer in the day — prefer- 
ably at noon — and then a light lunch may be given 
in the afternoon, similar to that suggested for morning, 
at 3 or 3 : 30. During the first school years the child 
has many new conditions to meet, such as the excite- 
ment of going away from home and mingling with a 
large number of persons, and the change to a schedule 
involving hours of confinement, and no extra strain 
should be put upon him in the way of caring for diffi- 
cult food. He needs more than ever to be safeguarded 
against unsuitable food, or food at unsuitable times, to 
which his school companions and surroundings may 
tempt him, and against eating when exhausted or greatly 
excited by his work or play. Regularity, simplicity, 
and serenity are good dietetic watchwords ; good health

CHAPTER rX 

FOOD FOR CHILDREN EIGHT TO TWELVE 
YEARS OLD 

By the time most children are eight years old they are 
estabHshed in the school-going habit. Some of the 
problems of nutrition which arise when they first change 
from a life of comparative freedom and of much time 
out of doors to one of restraint and too often, alas, 
of little fresh air, have been mentioned in the pre- 
ceding chapter. The years when the rate of growth is 
most rapid and the digestive tract most sensitive now 
are past, and errors in diet are followed by less swift 
retribution, so that there is a temptation to relax the 
vigilant care of the child's food and leave him to his own 
devices. But this is a great mistake. The period of 
physical development in a human being covers nearly a 
quarter of a century, and the seven-year-old child has 
climbed less than a third of the hill of growth, as the 
diagram below plainly shows. We attend to his cloth- 
ing and shelter — how much more important to see that 
he has proper food ! 

During the school years no such reserve of fuel is 
carried in the tissues as we find in the case of adults. 
A grown man can go three or four days without food and

phasis cannot be put upon the importance of establish- 
ing a regular meal schedule and of forbidding food at all 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN EIGHT TO TWELVE 147 

other times. Irregularity is one of the commonest 
errors in child feeding. 

According to the principle already laid down, the 
comparatively simple diet of the seventh year is to be 
gradually extended. Only a few well-chosen dishes 
need be offered at any one meal, but a tendency to 
choose a single dish for a meal and refuse everything 
else should be discouraged. In adult life a well-balanced 
diet demands more kinds of food than in childhood, 
when such a variety of elements is supplied by milk 
alone, and it is a great advantage to have been so trained 
as to be able to take these in all sorts of forms. Most 
adults eat in groups and pronounced individual likes and 
disUkes have great economic and social, if not always 
physiological, disadvantages. Half the problems of the 
food provider arise, not from the difficulty of securing 
wholesome food to make a well-balanced ration, but 
from the necessity of remembering that Mr. Jones will 
not touch fish, Mrs. Smith never eats cabbage, and Mr. 
Brown must always have apple pie for supper ! Youth 
is the time to cultivate respect for all natural foods as a 
means to physical and mental efficiency, and not merely 
as ticklers of the palate. Disparaging remarks about 
wholesome food should never be permitted, for it must 
always be borne in mind that eating has psychological 
as well as physiological aspects, and children are quick 
to catch the notions of those with whom they associate. 
If mother plainly turns up her nose at milk and cereals 
and bread and butter, how can she expect the children 
to relish them? Most food aversions are acquired in 



148 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

early life when the sensibilities are keenest. An acci- 
dent at the table with humiliating consequences, an un- 
pleasant association of a food with illness, a comparison 
with something disagreeable, may cause repugnance 
lasting for years. Such aversions, once acquired, call 
for patience and tact and may never be completely 
overcome. It is a part of the feeding problem of 
childhood to prevent such misfortunes. Table con- 
versation should deal with topics other than food, 
and when disturbances arise at the table eating 
should be stopped until tranquillity is restored. Food 
taken in grief or anger has a poor chance of fulfil- 
ling its proper mission. If a child refuses a food 
really essential to his welfare, hunger will often do more 
to reestablish his taste for it than commands or threats. 
New dishes or appeals to the imagination are often 
helpful in holding children to their proper diet. A glass 
measuring cup for milk has often inspired interest in the 
quantity drunk. One mother set her two httle children 
to running " Calorie races" when they were below normal 
weight, with decided improvement in the quantity of 
food taken. It is worth while to take thought as to 
how to keep children's attitude toward their food rational. 

Feeding from the Eighth to the Twelfth Year 

A quart of milk, continued as the basis of the diet, 
will give reUef from much concern as to whether it is 
well-balanced or not. Cooked cereals for breakfast 
should be given the preference, the ready-to-eat varie- 
ties being reserved for occasional use because the warm, 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN EIGHT TO TWELVE 149 

full-flavored porridge is less likely to be tired of. By 
the eighth year, raw fruits can be used more freely, only 
the strongly acid ones being forbidden. For the even- 
ing meal preference should be given to cooked fruits, 
moderately sweetened. Jelhes may be spread lightly on 
bread now and then, but preserves should be withheld 
entirely. Dates, figs, and raisins are valuable additions 
to the diet now. Dates and figs should be thoroughly 
washed and drained, after which they may be heated in 
an oven to dry and steriHze them, then cooled and packed 
in jars for future use. Figs are best stewed in a little 
water and require no sugar. With cream, they make an 
acceptable dessert. Raisins should always be cooked. 
They may be simply stewed and served as a sauce, or 
used to vary the flavor of other fruits, especially of dried 
peaches and apricots, added to bread, rice, and other 
cereal puddings, or baked in raisin bread. Their high 
fuel value, rich ash content,^ and sweet flavor make them 
very valuable in children's dietaries. Dates are often 
used to vary the appearance of the breakfast cereal, 
being cut up and stirred in a few minutes before serving. 
They can also be used in puddings and bread like raisins, 
and make a popular sandwich fiUing. 

The child may now be expected to eat any mild, 
thoroughly cooked, green vegetable, and one should be 
provided, if possible, every day. Raw vegetables should 
not be made a regular part of the diet before the tenth 
or the twelfth year. Pains should be taken to cook 

* The significance of the ash constituents of food was discussed in 
Chapter I. 



I50 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

vegetables so as to develop their best flavor, much of 
their unpopularity being due to bad cooking. Chil- 
dren's sense of taste is keen in the early school years. 

By the time a child is eight or nine years old, meat 
may be introduced into the diet. It should not be 
allowed to displace milk, but used to supplement it. 
Lean beef, mutton, lamb, chicken, lean fish, such as 
halibut and cod, or oysters are most suitable for this 
period. Fat meats or meats cooked in fat or served 
with rich gravies or sauces should be avoided, as too 
difficult of digestion. Only a small portion (not over 
an ounce) should be allowed and that not oftener than 
once a day. 

Children are generally fond of sweets, but these should 
never be given between meals. Not only candy, but 
the delectables of the soda fountain and ice cream parlor, 
are entirely out of place except at the end of a regular 
meal. Sugar is a valuable fuel food, but with its high 
flavor and rapid diffusibility it is Hkely to satisfy the 
appetite before body needs are really met, if given at 
the beginning of a meal ; and it is not only Hkely to dis- 
turb the normal appetite, but seriously to upset diges- 
tion if taken between meals; while in large quantities 
at any time it irritates the stomach and displaces foods 
which serve for building material as well as fuel. Candy 
is too concentrated to be an ideal food, but if greatly 
desired a very small amount may be given at the end 
of a meal, when it will be diluted by the other food and 
do no particular harm. Only plain candies made from 
pure ingredients should ever be allowed. Rich confec-

Always Hungry 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN EIGHT TO TWELVE 151 

tions from chocolate and nuts are too dilSicult of diges- 
tion. Plain sweet chocolate is a good substitute for 
candy and so are the sweet fresh and dried fruits. Gin- 
gerbread and plain cookies also satisfy the taste for 
sweets, and ice creams and ices can be used more and 
more for the same purpose. 

Nuts are not easy to masticate, and on account of 
their high fat content are rather slow of digestion. 
Hence they do not enter into the dietary of little children, 
and cannot be freely permitted even during this period. 
When ground to a paste, however, the first objection is 
removed and peanut and other nut butters are an accept- 
able addition at this time. No fried food, pastries, tea 
or coffee, rich sauces, or meat salads with mayonnaise 
dressing should ever be permitted. 

Three regular meals a day will now suffice for many 
children, but if breakfast is light or the child is very 
hungry between meals, a simple mid-morning or mid- 
afternoon luncheon may still be provided. It should 
not be given if it interferes with zest for the regular 
meals, and it should never be sweet, so as to tempt the 
child to eat when not really hungry. Dry bread, 
crackers, or milk are best. Mild fresh fruits are allow- 
able if the child is well and strong. Dinner should be 
served at noon rather than at night, to insure early and 
peaceful slumber. Many children have to take the 
noon meal at school, however; in the country because 
they live too far away to go home at noon ; in the city 
among the poor because the mother goes away to work 
and there is no one to prepare a noon meal, or among 



152 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

the well-to-do because the single school session often 
extends beyond what should be the dinner hour. The 
luncheon of the school child, therefore, deserves special 
consideration. Where the school authorities give it no 
attention, the children usually take their food from home. 
In this case they lose the advantage of warm food in 
promoting easy and rapid digestion, and their minds are 
not so clear for the afternoon work. They are also 
more Ukely to bolt their food when not eating at a table 
with other people. If then a lunch box must be carried 
from home, special thought should be given to the selec- 
tion of food, so tliat it may be suitable in kind and 
amount, and appetizing when the box is opened. Three 
or four kinds of food are quite enough to provide at a 
time, for at best the busy housewife usually finds her 
wits taxed to furnish wholesome lunches with much 
variety. 

PLAN FOR THE SCHOOL LUNCH BOX 

I. Sandwiches are the great staple, easily portable 
and generally Uked. The bread should never be less 
than twenty-four hours old, lightly buttered and filled 
with finely chopped boiled eggs carefully but mildly 
seasoned ; a nut paste, such as peanut butter, preferably 
softened by working in a little milk or cream ; a dried 
fruit paste, made of chopped dates, figs or raisins, or a 
mixture of these. For the older children, chopped meat, 
cheese of various kinds, and jellies are also desirable. 
Sandwiches of raisin or date bread without other filling 
than butter will help to give variety. 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN EIGHT TO TWELVE 153 

2. Fruit is appetizing and carries well. Its succulent 
qualities make it especially acceptable with the rather 
dry sandwich. Not only fresh ripe fruit, but also apple 
sauce, stewed raisins, figs, pears, peaches, etc., can often 
be carried by a little forethought in securing small jars 
with tight-fitting covers. Paper cups designed for jelly 
with close-fitting tops are practicable for this purpose. 
Tomatoes are juicy enough to take the place of fruit for 
the older children. 

3. A sweet of some kind should be included, such as 
plain cookies of various sorts, gingerbread or sponge 
cake, baked custard, a piece of sweet chocolate or a few 
dates rolled in sugar. 

4. Some fluid to drink with the meal aids digestion 
and should always be taken. Water will serve, of course, 
but milk will add to the food value and so will fruit 
juices, if they can be carried. 

Plenty of waxed paper to wrap the different kinds of 
food and keep them from flavoring each other should 
be kept on hand ; this is one of the big secrets of a tasty 
lunch box. 

At its best, however, the lunch box must be regarded 
as a makeshift. A regular school luncheon, shared by 
teachers and pupils, has tremendous advantages. If 
only one hot dish — perhaps soup or cocoa — can be 
provided at school to supplement what the children 
bring from home, it draws the pupils together socially, 
so that the meal is taken in a more orderly fashion, and 
experience in dozens of rural schools shows that it results 
in improved physical condition of the pupils. When 



154 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

they leave home early in the morning, travel a consider- 
able distance in the cold, and return only in time for 
supper, the cold food carried in their boxes would often 
be really insufficient for their body needs, even if it were 
in the best form. Recent studies of rural conditions 
have shown that country children tend more than city 
children to be below par physically ; and this is certainly 
not because country Ufe does not offer opportunity for 
good development, but because country dwellers often 
fail to realize that they must take advantage of the fresh 
air and wholesome food which are theirs to command. 
The realization of what good feeding means for physical 
and mental development results not only in careful 
provision of food for the meals at home, but cooperation 
with school authorities in securing protection from bad 
feeding at the noon hour. 

In many of our large cities and industrial centers the 
elementary school luncheon has long since passed the 
experimental stage and is regarded as a valuable part 
of the school training as well as a safeguard for the 
health of the child. Very often the pioneer work has 
been done by women's clubs or philanthropic organiza- 
tions which have assumed the task of demonstrating to 
school authorities the practicability and value of such 
feeding. The expensive machinery of education is 
wasted when it operates on a mind listless from hunger 
or befogged by indigestible food. Whether the cause be 
poverty, ignorance, or carelessness, the child is the 
sufferer, and the painstaking work of the school lunch 
supervisors to secure wholesome and adequate noon 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN EIGHT TO TWELVE 155 

meals for the school children at a minimum cost not 
only brings immediate benefit to the children, but exerts 
a widespread influence upon homes and parents, as the 
children carry to them reports of these concrete lessons 
in the science of proper selection, preparation, and 
hygiene of food. 

The school luncheon must be simple, easily served, 
and economical. It may consist of a hot dish, with some 
form of bread, and a choice of about two sweet dishes ; 
milk or cocoa should always be obtainable. A week's 
menu as actually served by the School Lunch Committee 
of the Home and School League in Philadelphia is given 
below :

156 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

At 1 1 : 45 in each of the seventeen schools squads of picked pupils 
set up the portable tables in preparation for serving the lunch. 
The children come from their classrooms, form lines, usually in the 
interior play yards, and as they pass a given point take up a tray, 
spoon, and whatever other utensils are necessary. The line goes by 
the large containers of soup, which is dispensed in half -pint portions 
to the children. The rule has been to have each child purchase 
first a half-pint bowl of soup, after which he may purchase any 
of the other items prepared for that day. After buying the soup 
the chUd passes along the table on which the other foods are dis- 
played, choosing those which appeal to him. 

Behind these tables the picked pupils, in white gloves and 
aprons, and, in the case of the girls, caps, hand to the children the 
desired articles. At the end of the Une the associate manager 
stands to receive as many pennies as there are items of food on each 
chUd's tray. The child carries his lunch to one of the tables which 
have been set for that purpose, where the food is eaten. 

After finishing the meal, the child takes the tray and soiled 
dishes to a designated place, where any remaining food is scraped 
into a pail and the bowls, trays, and utensils are neatly placed in 
piles ready to be washed. This affords an opportunity for a lesson 
in practical domestic science.

If the noon meal is served at home, it may be somewhat 
more elaborate, provided the child has time to eat it in a 
leisurely fashion. When he has to hurry back to school 
this fact must be taken into account, and no extra tax 
put on his digestive powers. The food plan given be- 
low will show the general type of food to be chosen.^

Lunches," Fanners' Bulletin No. 712, U. S. Department of Agriculture. 



158 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

If a warm, substantial dinner is served at noon, the 
evening meal may be comparatively simple, especially 
through the tenth year, as also indicated in the food 
plan below. Children of eleven and twelve will relish 
a dinner about as substantial as the noon meal, though 
they will be perfectly nourished with the simpler supper. 
If the noon meal has been a cold or light lunch, then 
the dinner as outlined should be given at night. In any 
case, the evening meal should be served by six o'clock, 
so as not to interfere with an early bedtime. For the 
normal body weight of children during this period, the 
reader is advised to consult the tables giving weight in 
relation to height in the Appendix. A healthy child of 
eight years may be anywhere from 45 to 51 inches in 
height and weigh from 45 to 59 pounds, and in later 
years even more individual variation is possible. The 
energy requirement will vary, not only with the body 
weight, but with the degree of physical activity, and 
boys with their higher muscular tension and tendency to 
vigorous sport will usually demand somewhat more 
food than girls of corresponding size ; hence an absolute 
standard cannot be set. The following figures, however, 
deduced from the observations of many persons on the 
food needs of school children, will serve as a general 
guide as to suitable amounts of food to provide.

CHAPTER X 
FOOD IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH 

With the introduction of meat and raw vegetables into 
the diet in the preceding period, the range of food ma- 
terials available for the child is practically the same as 
for the adult. In other words, any wholesome natural 
food may now be made a part of the dietary, in right 
amounts, at the right time, and in easily digestible form. 
Emphasis should still be placed on foods carrying sub- 
stances for growth, such as milk, eggs, cereals, fruits, 
and vegetables. During adolescence development is 
again in some respects very rapid ; boys grow suddenly 
tall and have the task of covering their long body frames 
with muscle; gifls grow less fast, usually, but must 
meet demands for more blood, and take on the supply 
of muscle and fat which gives them the contours of 
womanhood. Inadequate and unsuitable food at this 
time hinders normal development just as truly as in 
infancy, and many a healthy child fails to make the 
strong man or women of which he gave promise because 
of malnutrition in these critical times. Careful training 
from birth will, of course, help a great deal in tiding 
over the adolescent years, but in the storm and stress of 
the period certain vagaries of appetite may develop, 

163 



FOOD IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH 163 

such as the desire on the part of girls to avoid all plain 
food and Hve on sweets or other highly flavored food; 
the insistent craving for food on the part of boys, that 
leads to the consumption of unduly large quantities at 
one time, — so that wise guidance in feeding is still essen- 
tial. In addition to keeping out of the menu dishes 
which are decidedly difficult of digestion, or limiting 
them to occasional use under the most favorable cir- 
cumstances for taking care of them, there should be such 
supervision of the food eaten that a very one-sided or 
insufficient diet is impossible. 

The drinking of milk should be encouraged, and tea 
and coffee absolutely forbidden. Cocoa or cereal coffee 
in which milk and not water is the foundation fluid 
provide an acceptable warm drink for breakfast or 
supper. Cereals for breakfast are perhaps accepted 
more unquestioningly by boys with their keener appe- 
tites than by girls, but their use by both should be per- 
sistently encouraged. The addition of dates or of 
chopped nuts often increases their attractiveness. For 
girls of small appetite, toast made from whole wheat or 
graham bread, served with hot milk or cream, may take 
the place of the porridge. Fruit, fortunately, is usually 
well liked, and while this may be an expensive item in the 
diet, it is too important a source of body building and 
regulating material to be neglected. People who will 
buy porterhouse steak and lamb chops for themselves 
should not begrudge money for fresh fruit in the diet of 
their children. Those who must economize closely will 
have to depend more upon dried and less upon fresh 



1 64 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

fruit, except as the latter can be obtained cheaply in 
the height of the season. In the country, of course, 
fruit may be canned and so saved for use when out of 
season. The vegetables which serve the same purpose 
as fruit should be used as freely as possible, especially 
in the dietary of growing girls who need a rich supply 
of iron. Salads are usually popular if daintily prepared, 
and become a very useful part of the high school girl's 
menu. They should consist of crisp fresh or cooked 
vegetables, fresh fruit, or eggs, served with a simple 
cream or oil dressing without high seasoning. Strong 
condiments have no place in the dietary of youth, and 
rich salads of meat or fish with a heavy load of mayon- 
naise dressing are a severe tax even on the sturdy adult 
stomach. 

Meat should be provided in moderate amounts, two 
to four ounces a day. This is a part of good education 
for adult life as well as a wise provision for this particu- 
lar period. As an addition to the protein content of the 
diet, cheese may now be used in such dishes as cheese 
fondue, macaroni or hominy baked with cheese, com- 
binations of rice, cheese, and tomatoes, or as a filling 
for sandwiches. These are good meat substitutes, and 
much less expensive than meat. 

A variety of breadstuffs will increase the attractive- 
ness of the menu and help to keep up the fuel value of 
the diet without great expense. The use of different 
kinds of flour ; the incorporation into the loaf not only 
of the raisins and dates already mentioned, but now of 
nuts, especially walnuts or filberts; the sprinkling of 



FOOD IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH 165 

cinnamon and sugar over the top of the loaf, — are some 
of the ways of varying this staple food. Warm breads 
of all kinds should be used sparingly, if at all. When 
provided, they should be so baked as to have plenty of 
crust and little soft center, and served for breakfast or 
luncheon rather than the evening meal. Rolls made 
from raised dough should be baked with a crisp crust 
and served cold or reheated on the second day. Small 
graham or cornmeal mufiins, or cornbread or mufl&n 
batter baked in a thin sheet, are permissible occasionally, 
and so is Boston brown bread if served cold. Griddle- 
cakes, waffles, and baking powder biscuit should not 
appear in the dietary of the child under fourteen and 
very seldom after that. The habit of eating syrups on 
hot breads should not be fostered. The temptation to 
use them to excess is difficult to control, and the appetite 
for more wholesome food is vitiated. In no case should 
a hot bread constitute the main dish at a meal. On 
those rare occasions when waffles or griddlecakes are 
provided, they should follow a cereal or some other plain 
substantial dish. This insures a smaller consumption 
of the indigestible food and protects the body by that 
much. 

Bread and cereal puddings, custards, and blancmanges 
are still the most desirable forms of dessert, since they 
combine high food value with ease of digestion. They 
are particularly useful in the dietary of boys whose 
demand for food is so great as to tax their stomach capac- 
ity severely. It is possible to overstrain the stomach 
muscles by too great distention and thus lay the foun- 



1 66 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

dation for gastric trouble when the nervous strains oi 
middle life begin to be felt. For hearty boys a fairly 
concentrated diet is therefore desirable, and large 
volumes of fluid should not be permitted with meals. 
Desserts like baked Indian meal or poor man's pudding, 
where milk is concentrated with the cereal in baking, 
are ideal for growing boys. Pastry should be used very 
sparingly. Custard or prune pie, having but one crust 
and conveying valuable milk, eggs, and fruit, with the 
minimum of pie crust, are examples of the best kinds 
of pie. Cake should be served as a dessert and should 
never be rich. Cookies, sponge or plain cup cake are 
the best types. These can be varied by chocolate, nuts, 
or raisins very easily. 

Regularity of meals becomes increasingly difficult to 
secure, but needs to be emphasized as much as ever. 
Three regular meals a day should be sufficient, but for 
the rapidly growing child of keen appetite it is often 
wise to provide access to some very plain food, such as 
bread or crackers, between meals. Girls, especially of 
high school age, frequently wish to omit breakfast, 
but they should not be permitted to go to school with- 
out any food. "Nerves" are often the direct result of 
undernutrition, and in this period the welfare of the 
woman's nervous system is largely determined. Many 
high school children do not go home for the noon meal. 
In fact, the custom of providing meals at school began 
in America with the high school, and most city schools 
have lunch rooms. Sometimes these are let by contract 
and there is no skilled supervision of the food supply. 



FOOD IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH 167 

But with the spread of the carefully supervised elemen- 
tary school luncheon attention has been directed to the 
real needs of the high school youth and the opportunities 
for education in good eating habits. An interesting 
attempt to help the pupil to choose wisely is shown in 
the Menu Bulletin of the Julia Richman High School in 
New York City.^

" The result of the educational work done here is clearly demonstrated 
in the change of demand for food. The first few days of the service, 
the candy and pastry tables were the chief points of purchase, more than 
half the receipts coming from that source. About 30 bowls of soup 
were sold and 15 to 20 other hot dishes. Within four weeks from the 
commencement of the service we were selling an average of 80 to 90 
bowls of soup and 40 to 60 other hot dishes." 

The high school luncheon will usually offer a greater 
variety of foods than the elementary school meal, but 
these should always be presented with the fact in mind 
that the young people are going back to brain work, 
and heavy dishes are out of place. The daily menu list 
may well include such dishes as the following : 

1. Soup, as tomato, green pea, split pea, white and black bean. 

2. Two or three hot dishes, as spaghetti with tomato sauce, 
mashed potatoes with green peas, baked beans, corn pudding, 
a stew with vegetables or a hot roast beef sandwich. 

3. Salads, as potato, egg, fruit, or green vegetable. 

4. Sandwiches, one or two varieties each day. 

5. Fruit, as apples, bananas, stewed fruits of various kinds. 

6. Milk and cocoa. 

7. Plain cake or sweet wafers offered only in combination with 
milk or other plain food. 

8. Ice cream, charlotte russe, simple baked pudding, sweet 
chocolate.

The evening meal needs to be more substantial than 
for the younger children. In the city this will be the 
time for the regular dinner; in the country it is more 
likely to be supper. Here we must guard against ex- 
tremes — too heavy a meal on the one hand and too 
light on the other. Supper should include one substan- 
tial warm dish as a rule. This may be a thick soup, as 
suggested for the younger children, macaroni and cheese, 
a stew or chowder, or a loaf of beans or lentils with a 
cream or tomato sauce. This with plenty of bread and 
butter, some stewed fruit and cookies, or a wholesome 
pudding, and milk to drink, will make a sufficiently 
nourishing repast. Suggestions for dinner are given on 
the food plan below. 

The energy requirements of this period are approxi- 
mately :

Calories. Very often by this time the full height will 
have been attained and the parents are surprised at 
the large consumption of food, thinking that growth has 
ceased. But growth is not merely a question of height. 
As already said, it involves laying on of muscle and fat, 



lyo FEEDING THE FAMILY 

development of internal organs and a vigorous nervous 
system, and these demand food. Furthermore, muscular 
activity, especially out of doors, is a great aid in muscle 
and nerve development, and the extra fuel required to 
support this activity should never be begrudged young 
people. For five or ten years after full height is reached 
their food consumption will be considerably higher 
than that of adults of the same size. As long as they 
confine themselves to simple, nourishing foods they are 
not likely to overeat. Sometimes their expenditures in 
growth and activity exceed their assimilative powers. 
Especially is this true of those who grow very tall 
with great rapidity and indulge freely in active sports 
and dancing. To leave a balance in favor of the body 
it may be for a time necessary to curtail the activity 
somewhat — to insist on longer hours for rest and less 
violent exercise until substantial gains in weight and 
other signs of physical welfare show that the energy 
demands are not greater than the energy supply.

174 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Food for Boys and Girls from the Seventeenth to the 
Twenty-fifth Year 

"A little thought, a little self-control, and then forget 
that there is such a thing as digestion." 

By the end of the sixteenth year good habits in eating 
ought to be well established and the digestive system 
should be strong enough to care for all reasonably whole- 
some food, if offered at suitable times. The food require- 
ments of the next few years depend very largely upon 
the nature of the youth's occupation. Up to this time 
the majority have been held in school by choice or law, 
but now some engage in vigorous muscular labor, some go 
into sedentary trades, and some continue to go to school. 
Nearly all continue to increase in body weight, and many 
in height, for four or five years, if not longer. The pro- 
cesses initiated, sometimes with such vigor, in the period of 
adolescence are now more slowly completed. Muscle is 
added, internal organs perfect their structure, the nervous 
system grows stronger, and that fine working machine — 
the adult man or woman — comes upon the scene. 

The influence of active and sedentary life upon the 
choice of food has already been discussed in the chap- 
ters dealing with the adult man and woman. The 
active youth engaged in outdoor labor can thrive on the 
simple rations of pork and beans, cabbage and potatoes, 
corn bread and apple pie, provided they are sufficient 
in amounts to cover his fuel needs. Outdoor life and 
fresh air are sauce to his appetite and tonic to his diges- 
tion. On the other hand, the young bank clerk, sitting 



FOOD IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH 175 

in a hot, close room, with no more exercise than a short 
walk or two, would find his brain utterly befogged by 
such a diet because conditions are not favorable for 
digesting it. He must have the simple fare of the 
sedentary man, in quantities not exceeding his daily 
needs, and daintily prepared, since his living conditions 
do not foster keen appetite. Girls at sedentary occu- 
pations are more liable to suffer from the blunting effect on 
appetite than boys, and are tempted to eat foods of high 
flavor, like pickles and candy, with Uttle regard to their 
after-effects. But the simple, nourishing food already 
suggested for sixteen-year-old girls and sedentary women 
indicates the type of diet which they should have. 

Young people entering the commercial world are fre- 
quently confronted with the luncheon problem. If they 
take food from home, there must be careful selection, 
just as in the case of the school child, and a warm bever- 
age should be added if possible. More and more are 
factories and other commerical concerns realizing the 
relationship between good feeding and efficiency in their 
employees, and establishing their own lunch rooms, with 
experts in charge to provide good food at a moderate 
price. Very often, however, the boy or girl must 
patronize some pubUc restaurant, and here we have as 
yet Uttle guarantee as to quality of food and no guid- 
ance as to what to choose. Those lunch rooms which 
provide plain, clean food under sanitary conditions, but 
without expensive frills in the way of table decoration 
and service, are doing a real service to the young man 
and woman of small means forced to lunch away from 



176 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

home.^ But the individual must still decide for himself 
what shall constitute his meal. A serving of wheat 
cakes and maple syrup will give approximately the same 
fuel value as one of milk crackers and milk, but the latter 
is much less Uable to cause digestive disturbances and 
is richer in building material for the still growing organ- 
ism. Similarly, a serving of baked macaroni and cheese, 
with its accompanying bread and butter, as the main 
part of the luncheon would be preferable to one of mince 
pie, though the cost of fuel value may be the same.^ 

Most young people need from 750 to 1000 Calories 
for luncheon, the exact amount depending, of course, 
upon many factors — the kind of breakfast, the size and 
activity of the individual, and so forth. But even when 
growth has slowed down to these last stages, the welfare 
of the young person is usually promoted by three regu- 
lar meals, each fairly substantial. Some examples of 
simple luncheons in which the cost of the food materials 
at retail is about one cent per 100 Calories are given below.

For the college youth the feeding problem is one of 
adaptation to a life partly active and partly sedentary, 
with some allowance of surplus for growth throughout 
most if not all of the four years. Within the period 
from the eighteenth to the twenty-third year most 
young people complete their college education, and this 
is the time when they should be laying the final stones 
in that foundation of physical health and strength which

is to make their active working years most effective. 
It is not always realized that these are years for storing 
capital physically as well as mentally. Too often young 
people are released from the safe-guarding routine of 
home life and left to their own devices as regards food 
in the college community, when their eating ought to 
be carefully supervised. The existence of the train- 
ing table shows some recognition of the fact that un- 
wholesome Uving and physical fitness are incompatible, 
and what we need is to extend this idea in a modi- 
fied form to every student in college — to make every 
college table a training table for high physical resistance 
in future years. Many institutions have their own 
dining halls, where the food can be properly prepared 
and served ; small excuse for these if it is not adequate 
for the students' needs ! And yet, all too often, 
the selection is left to some one with no real knowl- 
edge of the principles of good feeding, whose work 
is judged by the size of the bills and not at all by the 
well-being of the young people. With trained dietitians 
available, this is no longer excusable. On the other 
hand, college students do not need expensive and 
elaborate fare ; and even the expert college dietitian is 
likely to suffer many and severe criticisms from the 
members of her group, because of the different standards 
of living which they bring with them, the bad eating 
habits which they may have acquired in their own 
homes, and the utter separation in their minds of the 
price which they pay for board from the kind of fare 
that a given sum of money will buy. At one time 



i8o FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Mrs. Richards made an investigation of a college dining 
hall in the University of Chicago where there were com- 
plaints of the food. The students were asked to make 
out some bills of fare which would please them, and it 
was found that to give them what they wished would 
cost about $io per week, whereas they were paying $3.50! 
It is only by education and establishing confidence in 
the dietitian that such problems can be satisfactorily 
met. 

Schools which do not provide dining halls of their 
own have a responsibility for the kind of eating houses 
patronized by their students, and should at least be 
able to warn against those which are unsanitary. Young 
people of limited means are in danger, if left to them- 
selves, of economizing on food to the detriment of their 
health, and will naturally pick out those restaurants 
where they can seemingly get the most food for the least 
money. This is perfectly legitimate till we come to the 
type of eating house which buys adulterated, spoiled, 
or otherwise inferior food and skimps on dishwashing, 
refrigerator cleaning, and other necessary sanitary pre- 
cautions, in order to sell at a low price. From such the 
college student needs to be strictly guarded. For- 
tunately the habit of "boarding oneself," which was 
fairly common half a century ago, is not so prevalent 
to-day, and students in general are probably better fed. 
This is as it should be, for it is a sad thing to see a young 
man or woman of promise break down at thirty-five or 
forty, unable to stand the strain of existence because of 
malnutrition in the critical years of development. With 



FOOD IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOXTTH i8i 

proper nutrition and rational division of work, rest, and 
play, the college student should emerge from his four- 
year course stronger physically as well as mentally. To 
achieve this is a part of his education. 

Specifically, the college youth needs an ample diet of 
plain food, fairly rich in building materials and "ballast." 
During periods of more intense study the food should 
be specially easy of digestion, without being too concen- 
trated. Such fare as already outlined for the boy and 
girl of sixteen should in the main be provided. In the 
institution, one of the great dangers is monotonous 
routine. A weekly program is made out and followed 
month after month. This is never advisable, as variety 
seems to be essential to the appetite of the human being, 
and the custom is most disastrous for the brain worker, 
whose less keen appetite makes him more sensitive to 
monotony. There should be variation from week to 
week, as well as from day to day, and still more marked 
variation with the seasons. Milk should be served 
freely as a beverage, and will often be found to cut 
down the amount of more expensive food. At any rate, 
it is food which the young people should be encouraged 
to take, and may be the means of providing individuals 
with high food requirements with a full quota of nourish- 
ment when the following of the conventional menu 
would scarcely satisfy them. 

Fruits and vegetables are sometimes conspicuously 
lacking in the dietaries for students, partly on account 
of expense and partly on account of a failure to appre- 
ciate their value, both on the part of the students and 



1 82 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

the dining-room managers. Nothing interferes with 
clear thinking more than constipation, and the seden- 
tary student on a diet chiefly composed of meat and 
potatoes, eggs, milk, and white bread, is particularly 
liable to this malady. Those who have young people 
to care for should insist on a food allowance Uberal 
enough to include plenty of fruit and vegetables, and as 
a part of their education the young people should be en- 
couraged to eat them. If they have been carefully 
trained in eating from their early years, this will be com- 
paratively easy, but there will be some who need con- 
stant encouragement to teach them rational eating 
habits. 

Advantage may be taken of holidays and other times 
when physical and outdoor activity is increased to vary 
the menu by the introduction of some foods which are 
too slow of digestion for the person at brain work. If 
afternoons are given over to athletics and little study is 
done early in the evening, baked beans and brown bread 
will make an acceptable supper. On a cold Saturday, 
after hours out of doors, mince pie or suet pudding will 
be a satisfying dessert. But no student should be set 
to his evening task on a meal of hot biscuits and honey 
or molasses. To satisfy his youthful needs for energy 
he will have to eat more of them than will be good for 
his digestion. A thick soup, and a cereal pudding with 
fruit, along with plenty of bread and butter, will fulfill 
his requirements much better. 

The food of growing children and youth is relatively 
more expensive than that for adults, because of their 



FOOD IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH 183 

higher expenditure of energy in proportion to size and 
the greater need for building materials, which are more 
costly than simple fuel. While we insist on economy in 
the use of food materials, it must be a wise economy 
which avoids waste, but recognizes the necessity of an 
adequate food supply, even through the college years. 
If rigid economy must be practiced, let it be as far -as 
possible on the seasoned adult who can best bear it, 
and not upon developing young people whose right it is 
not only to be well born, but also well reared. 

Twenty-five years serve to round out the period of 
growth. Then follows a span of a quarter of a century 
or more which constitutes the period of adult life, whose 
food needs have been discussed in chapters III and IV. 
After fifty one must consider the modifications for old 
age, which are treated in the next chapter. 



CHAPTER XI 
FOOD AFTER FIFTY 

Old age is a physiological condition rather than an 
accumulation of years. Some men are older at fifty 
than others at eighty. After the first quarter of a cen- 
tury, roughly the period of growth, tliere follows a second 
quarter of a century, possibly a third, in which the body 
tends to maintain a fairly constant weight, sometimes 
not varying more than a few pounds in twenty-five or 
thirty years. With the fuel intake regulated to the 
muscular activities of the individual, and the load of 
work adapted to the capacity of the human machine, we 
have ideal conditions for constant productivity for years, 
provided the stoking of the furnace is sensibly attended 
to. "Overwork" in the active adult period is in most 
cases the mask behind which dwell sins against nutrition 
and other simple laws of hygiene. Poisons due to con- 
stipation and intestinal putrefaction insidiously under- 
mine the body resistance and may be the real cause of 
the wreck which follows a severe strain. The normal 
healthy bod}^ is wonderfully elastic, and admirably re- 
pays reasonable care. 

Though a man may not be "old" at fifty — may stiU 
be vigorous in mind and body — it is likely that his 

184 



FOOD AFTER FIFTY 185 

muscular activity has decreased from what it was at 
thirty. He is more content to watch a ball game than 
to participate in it ; he takes his game of tennis more as 
a duty than as a means of working off surplus animal 
spirits; he walks where formerly he might have run 
and too often rides when he might walk. This tendency 
to lessened muscular activity is accompanied by a gradual 
slowing up of the internal processes demanding fuel for 
their maintenance and, so, with advancing years the 
need for food diminishes. Appetite, however, may be 
as keen as ever; the eating habits acquired in more 
active years arfe unconsciously followed ; or the increase 
of wealth results in the setting of a more luxurious table, 
and the palate leads far from the path of necessity — 
often into danger. The tendency to increase in weight 
is a sure indication that the fuel intake is greater than 
the energy expenditure. Watching the scales and observ- 
ing whether one is growing more than 10 to 15 per cent 
heavier than the normal weight for his height (see Tables 
V and VI, Appendix, pp. 429 and 430) is the best way for 
one to discover whether or not his food intake should be 
cut down. If the diet has been up to this time a well- 
balanced one, with meat in moderation, fruit and vege- 
tables freely used, and few rich foods, condiments, or 
stimulants, reduction is a matter of quantity chiefly. 
Eating smaller portions of the foods served and chewing 
them thoroughly so as to appease the appetite without 
excess, at the same time drinking water freely so as to 
facilitate the elimination of waste, should keep the body 
in good condition. It must be remembered, too, that 



i86 



FEEDING THE FAMILY 



if alcoholic beverages are drunk, the alcohol, besides 
its stimulating and other pecuUar effects, has a high fuel 
value ^ and must be counted in the day's food supply. 

Up to the age of sixty reductions in food are necessitated 
chiefly by lessened external muscular activity, and 
excess of food is stored as body fat. These phenomena 
cannot be considered as particularly characteristic of 
"old age" as a physiological condition. In the truly 
aged, there is a decided retardation of the internal proc- 
esses, and caring for excess food becomes more difficult. 
There is a tendency to lose rather than to gain body 
weight, as the following figures show :

It is roughly estimated that the decrease in food re- 
quirement due to old age, from the total fuel which would 
be required by an adult of the same degree of activity, is 
about 10 per cent between the ages of sixty and seventy ; 
about 20 per cent between seventy and eighty ; and about 
30 per cent after that. In other words a man who at

thirty requires per day 2000 Calories simply sitting at 
rest, will require under the same circumstances only 
about i8cx) at seventy and only 1600 at eighty. The 
ordinary activities of a man of thirty may raise his energy 
output to 3500 Calories per day, but few men of eighty 
could do sufficient muscular work to transform so much 
additional fuel. Their lives are likely to be decidedly 
sedentary; hence 1600 to 1800 Calories will probably 
closely approximate their total daily expenditure, though 
no absolute rule can be laid down. In general, there 
is safety in abstemiousness ; dangers of excess are greater 
than dangers of undernutrition. 

One of the difficulties in true old age is loss of the 
power of mastication. When the teeth become useless, 
it is necessary to provide food which does not require 
chewing, or digestion will be interfered with. Instead 
of the steaks and roasts which furnish much protein in 
middle life, we must substitute milk and soft-cooked 
eggs; finely scraped or minced meats, or easily flaked 
fish. If the gums cannot effect the mastication of 
breadstuffs, fermentation is Kkely to result. The sub- 
stitution of thoroughly crisp toast or zwiebach, softened 
in milk, tea, coffee, soup, and the like, usually gives 
good results, the change in texture making the food break 
up readily into small pieces and the slight chemical 
change (principally conversion of starch to the more 
readily digested dextrin) being also advantageous. Very 
thoroughly cooked cereals and baked potatoes are other 
useful sources of carbohydrate food. If sugars can be 
taken without fermentation, they are valuable. Many 



1 88 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

old people are fond of sweets and can eat considerable 
amounts to advantage. 

On account of the slowing of digestive processes, and 
the tendency for the digestive juices to flow less readily, 
fats should be used rather sparingly. Rich sauces, 
cakes and puddings, pastries, and fried foods should be 
discarded. Cream, bacon, butter, and olive oil, all 
forms which can be very simply used, with bread, cereals, 
and the like, are much to be preferred, and then in modera- 
tion. Stimulants to gastric secretion may very properly 
be used to aid digestion in the aged. Warm food is 
desirable for the same reason. Instead, then, of a glass 
of cold water before a meal to start the gastric juice, a 
warm beverage such as tea or coffee or a clear soup of 
some kind will be advisable. Unless there is difficulty 
in the elimination of uric acid, the potent influence of 
meat extracts as gastric stimulants may be exerted in 
the form of beef and other kinds of broth. 

With the lowering of metaboHsm characteristic of senil- 
ity, coupled with sedentary living, there is more difficulty 
in keeping the body comfortably warm, and more care 
must be taken to conserve the heat naturally generated. 
This is another reason for giving warm rather than cold 
food. Even between meals a hot drink of broth, tea, or 
coffee will often prove most acceptable instead of plain 
water, and will counteract the tendency to drink too Uttle 
which interferes with free eHmination of waste products. 

With constructive processes at a standstill, or destruc- 
tive actually in ascendance, the need for building ma- 
terials is reduced to a minimum. As long as life persists 



FOOD AFTER FIFTY Z89 

there is necessarily some exchange of materials in the 
processes of cell activity, and none of the elements 
already seen to be essential to a well-balanced dietary 
can be entirely dispensed with. But the total amount 
required is less than ever before. In the case of pro- 
tein, there is usually more danger of difficulty in getting 
rid of a surplus than in the more active years, so that a 
very moderate supply is best. An allowance in the day's 
diet of one and one-half protein Calories per pound should 
fully protect the body against nitrogen deficiency. Milk, 
gelatin, and cereal proteins — forms which do not readily 
undergo putrefaction — are more desirable than meat. 

How freely fruits and green vegetables may be used 
depends much upon the individual. If mastication is 
possible and fermentation does not develop, they may 
make up a considerable part of the dietary. But with 
decreased powers of caring for them, they must be given 
in such ways as one would give them to little children, 
i.e., fruits as juice or stewed pulp of mild varieties; 
vegetables well-cooked and mashed or put through a 
sieve and served as puree or soup. 

Many old people sleep better with some form of 
nourishment late in the evening or when they waken in 
the night. Hot milk, plain or modified with a cereal 
gruel or warm water, hot malted milk, or hot bouillon 
with one or two crackers may be given at such a time. 
If the person wakes early in the morning, food is often 
desired before the regular breakfast. Sometimes a few 
plain crackers may be left by the bedside, some choice 
ripe fruit, fruit juice, or a glass of milk. 



IQO FEEDING THE FAMILY 

By such additions to the menu, it is likely to come 
about that the number of meals is increased in extreme 
old age to five or six instead of three a day. In many 
ways the diet gradually approximates that fed to chil- 
dren in the first five or six years — fruit juices, well- 
cooked cereals, milk, eggs, strained vegetables, and 
cereal puddings making a large part of the ration, witli 
simple meals coming at frequent intervals. The em- 
phasis on building materials is less, and hot and stimu- 
lating foods not permissible in early life are usually a 
part of the aged person's menu. Moderation and sim- 
plicity are the passwords to health.

CHAPTER XII 
FOOD FOR THE FAMH^Y GROUP: MENUS 

Diversity of age ! Diversity of need ! Diversity of 
taste ! How shall the individual requirements set forth 
in the preceding chapters be harmonized so that one 
table may serve all? How shall one pair of hands, if 
need be, prepare the food required? And how may 
there be time and energy left for house and clothes and 
for that "higher Ufe" of the family to which food, cloth- 
ing, and shelter are after all only the means? Our 
grandmothers have brought up families without any 
knowledge of food requirements save tradition — why 
not do likewise; spend what we can, take what the 
market affords, and trust in Providence for the results? 
Alas, science has at least made us aware that "mys- 
terious dispensations of Providence" which robbed 
families of health and strength could have been averted 
by a Uttle knowledge and care; that bad feeding kills 
more babies than any other kind of negligence; "that 
man's efficiency in this world, if not his happiness in 
the next, is mainly due to the precautions he takes to 
use suitable food and to avoid dangerous combinations." 
To-day the profession of housewife demands knowledge 
of the needs of each member of her group and ability 

194 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 195 

to supply them under all sorts of circumstances. 
"Happy is he who sits down to the dinner provided for 
him without thought of what he must leave out, with 
a mind free for social pleasure, secure in the skill and 
knowledge of his cook." Happier still the children 
brought up under a watchful eye that understands the 
laws of health and holds them in the highest regard. 
They will repay patient mastery of the A B C's of nutri- 
tion a hundred fold. And some of the rewards will be 
immediate. One grandmother remarked the other day : 
"The modern way of bringing up does seem to make good 
babies." Nutrition as a science is not very old, but it 
has begun to illumine the page of tradition ; and mastery 
of its principles will enable us to proceed with confi- 
dence instead of uncertainty. We have to cope to-day 
with many new conditions upon which tradition throws 
no light. Package goods, ready-to-eat foods, hothouse 
products, strange wares from the ends of the earth — 
we must learn in these to recognize the old familiar food- 
stuffs (or to note their absence) and adapt ourselves to 
the new order. Then when we find that a new food 
product at $4 a pound contains the same nutritive sub- 
stances as milk at four cents a pound, we shall be able 
to choose intelligently between them. Knowing that 
milk and egg yolk, which are no trouble to prepare, are 
better for little children than beef juice, shall we not 
save ourselves labor and often expense? Realizing that 
the energy value of a food is the same whether served 
simply or elaborately, shall we not be better able to 
decide how much elaboration is worth while? 



196 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

"I shouldn't mind housekeeping if it were not for 
planning the meals" — how often have we heard this? 
There is a sort of inevitableness about meals which 
makes them seem truly awful at times. A hungry- 
family and nothing on the table is terrible to contem- 
plate. But routine (drudgery if you will) loses much of 
its depressing power when our work gains significance. 
To see the children rosy, the family accounts free from 
doctor's bills, and an atmosphere of serenity in the 
home are surely compensations for time and thought 
given to family meals. 

The Construction of the Menu 

There is a steady demand for menus, and they are 
always suggestive. But they seldom fit the case exactly. 
They depend on times and seasons, localities and pocket- 
books, community customs and individual notions, as 
well as the states of health and size of families and ages 
of their members. Hence menus cannot be made whole- 
sale and slavishly followed. The examples which have 
been given in this book in discussing the food of the 
different types which one may find in a family group 
are designed to illustrate principles and may be greatly 
modified without any sacrifice of nutritive value. A 
meal may be reduced to a single kind of food material 
or it may contain many kinds of food and many dishes. 
If there is only one kind of food used, the menu is no 
problem. So the baby, each of whose meals is alike, 
is not the one the mother has in mind when she worries 
about "planning meals." Nor are normal young chil- 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 197 

dren up to at least four or five years of age much cause 
of concern on this account; their food is limited in 
variety and their meals vary little from day to day. It 
is when the choice of food materials becomes practically 
unlimited, when selecting for the older children and 
adults, that the menu looms large in her mind, and from 
this point of view it will be first discussed. 

Types of Meal Plans 

One great help in the daily task is the standardization 
of the meals to be served at different times in the day. 
This will have to be determined for each family group 
according to its food needs. If the adults are all seden- 
tary, and have ample noon meals, breakfast may be 
very light: fruit, some kind of breadstuff, as toast or 
roUs, and a beverage, as coffee, cocoa, or milk. Or it 
may be light: fruit, cereal, breadstuff, beverage. If, 
however, the workers take little food at midday, it may 
be wise to increase it to medium: fruit, cereal, eggs or 
meat, breadstuff, beverage. If the workers are engaged 
actively in muscular pursuits, and their total intake for 
the day must be high, the breakfast may be medium or 
heavy: fruit, cereal, eggs or meat, one other hot dish, 
breadstuff, beverage. For the mixed family group, where 
the adults are not very active muscularly, the ''light" 
breakfast is the most convenient t)rpe, as it provides 
at the same time the essentials of the children's break- 
fast. For one j>erson demanding more variety, an egg 
or serving of bacon can be added without much extra 
labor. On the other hand, the sedentary person eating 



198 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

in a group of active muscular workers can pass by the 
extra dishes and confine himself to the "light" or 
"medium" breakfast, the "heavy" type being quite 
unsuited to his needs. 

Similarly, various plans present themselves for lun- 
cheon and dinner, or for dinner and supper, as the case 
may be. 

As a general rule, digestion is better served by having 
at least one hot dish at a meal. This may be a beverage, 
and luncheon consist of a beverage and sandwiches. 
Thus peanut butter sandwiches and cocoa are perfectly 
practical for a luncheon 3delding 700 to 8cx) Calories 
per capita. Or the hot dish may be a soup, and again 
sandwiches used to supplement it. Or the hot dish may 
be a chowder, macaroni and cheese, some creamed dish 
on toast, and the like, served with bread and butter and 
a beverage. These simple types of luncheon are suited 
to the sedentary worker, but can be made more pleasing 
to the palate by the addition of a simple dessert — stewed 
or fresh fruit, charlotte russe, blancmange. Another 
type of luncheon, still suitable for the sedentary, con- 
sists of soup, some other hot dish, such as mentioned 
above, bread and butter and dessert, to which a beverage 
may or may not be added. This can be easily varied by 
substituting a salad for the hot dish — giving a t3^e of 
luncheon especially attractive to sedentary women. 
For the active worker, especially if engaged out of doors, 
for whom food must be Uberally provided, one or two 
hot dishes, a substantial dessert (as pie) and a hot 
beverage, with bread and butter, will give as satisfac- 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 199 

tory results as a greater variety, if the dishes are high 
in fuel value. More formal luncheons resemble dinners 
in type. 

A very simple dinner will consist of two hot dishes 
(as meat and a vegetable), which may be combined and 
served as one at times, bread and butter, and a dessert, 
with or without any beverage but water. The addition 
of another vegetable will make this more pleasing and 
almost always better balanced. Where it does not in- 
volve too much labor, dinner is very happily begun with 
soup. As already said, this stimulates gastric secretion, 
the warmth is refreshing, and one is in better condition 
to enjoy the rest of the dinner with the edge taken off 
hunger without blunting the appetite. A soup, three 
hot dishes, a salad, dessert, and beverage, with bread 
and butter, make a meal elaborate enough for any 
family. In fact, one of the reasons for difficulty in 
menu making is the tendency to put too many dishes 
into one meal. We may apply to foods as well as to 
house furnishings William Morris's dictum, "Nothing 
is beautiful which is not also useful." An added dish 
should serve a real purpose in a meal, artistic or physio- 
logical. A green vegetable is a desirable part of any 
dinner menu, but two green vegetables offer no enhance- 
ment to each other and rarely add anything to the effect 
not already accomplished by one, while physiologically 
they serve the same purpose and one might just as well 
eat two servings of one as one serving of each of two 
kinds. Every dupUcation of this kind makes it so much 
the more difficult to provide the sauce of variety for the 



200 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

next time. Potatoes, macaroni and rice are essentially 
equivalents in the menu, carbohydrate foods of mild 
flavor and of the same color and general texture ; hence 
they should be served one at a time and made to give 
variety to three days — never all, nor even two of them, 
at one meal. The same is true of any group of foods 
Uke sweet potatoes, cooked bananas, parsnips, and car- 
rots — all sweet carbohydrate foods so similar that they 
are both nutritively and artistically food equivalents, 
and where one values esthetic effects to be used one 
at a time. In this matter of food equivalents, minor 
adjustment to individual preferences can often be made 
through the use of leftovers. If macaroni is the starchy 
dish to-day and John prefers rice, which was served 
yesterday, a leftover portion may be given to him ; he 
will be as well fed as if he ate the macaroni, and the cook 
will be relieved of the odd portion. 

Often the dessert furnishes the most energy of any 
single dish, amounting to as much as 300 or 400 Calories. 
When the first part of the meal is not very high in fuel 
value, this is all very well; but when "heavy" desserts 
are not needed to bring up the total fuel value of the 
meal, a salad or fruit will leave a pleasant impression 
upon the diners, at the same time relieving the cook of 
work and making the meal better balanced. 

Food Combinations from the Scientific Standpoint 

"What foods go well together?" Many housewives 
seem to think that there are laws on this point as un- 
alterable as those of the Medes and Persians. As a

matter of fact, the answer depends very much upon 
whether one is an Englishman or an Esquimaux, a 
Bostonian or a Bengali. Reverend S. Hall Young, re- 
counting his experiences with John Muir in Alaska, tells 
what dif&culty they had, when they were entertained 
by the Indians, to keep their food from being drenched 
with a sauce of seal oil — a special delicacy to their 
hosts, which tasted very disagreeable to them. A 
Chinaman does not put sugar on his rice nor in his tea, 
but what American housewife would omit to offer sugar 
with both, unless she were serving rice as a "vegetable" 
— a habit too little in vogue? 

The study of food combinations is like the old defini- 
tion of arithmetic, "both a science and an art." As a 
science it relates chiefly to the promotion of digestibility 
and the representation of the different food elements in 
the diet. It has been pointed out in Chapter II that 
digestion is more likely to be satisfactory for the adult 
when the meal is not limited to a single food material. 
Thus bread and milk is to b^ preferred to milk alone. 
A meal composed mainly of carbohydrate material 
leaves the stomach too quickly to suit ordinary meal 
schedules, and so does one entirely fluid. A meal of fat 
alone would offer a staggering proposition to an ordinary 
appetite, and if eaten would digest slowly, giving no zest 
for another meal soon. A meal of protein alone might 
have some advantages in an Arctic climate, since it 
would stimulate heat production and help to give feel- 
ings of warmth, but this would be most disadvantageous 
in warmer regions. Altogether, man finds himself 



202 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

better off with proteins, fats, and carbohydrates repre- 
sented in each meal, the carbohydrates where available 
(i.e., in all but extremely cold cHmates) predominating. 
To see that these three foodstuffs are represented in 
good proportions in each meal is what is usually meant 
by serving a "balanced" meal. We should go a step 
further and see that some foods furnishing iron, phos- 
phorus, and calcium and some giving "ballast" in the 
form of cellulose are also included, and that the fuel 
value of the meal is approximately the same each day; 
or, in other words, that we do not have a feast and upset 
our digestions by overeating to-day, and have a famine 
to-morrow, but stoke the furnace regularly, according 
to its needs. Herein lies the advantage of knowing the 
relative fuel value of different foods and different dishes. 
It will keep us from serving to-day a cream soup, a fat 
meat, sweet potatoes (perhaps glazed, with increase in 
fuel value), a vegetable with HoUandaise sauce, a salad 
with mayonnaise dressing, and ice cream with a choco- 
late sauce — all dishes very high in fuel ; and to-morrow 
a bouillon, a lean fish, riced potatoes, sliced tomatoes 
without dressing, and fruit for dessert — a meal which 
may have only half the fuel value of the first one — 
unless we have good reason for making such a change.^ 
Foods which are known to be difficult of digestion 
should not be massed in the same day, or more partic- 
ularly, in the same meal. Even though the family 
enjoys griddle cakes, pork chops, fried potatoes, and plum 

^ By means of the tables in the Appendix, a rough check can easily 
be kept on the fuel value of a meal, without any detailed computation. 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 203 

pudding, do not provide them all on the same day, but 
spread them over four days in combination with other 
foods easier to digest. Thus, we might have cantaloupe, 
grape nuts, and griddle cakes for breakfast one day; 
tomato soup, cold roast beef, fried potatoes, apple float 
and cookies for luncheon another day ; and pork chops, 
mashed potatoes, string beans, orange salad, and caramel 
custard for dinner another day, thus giving the enjoy- 
ment of these more difficult foods under circumstances 
favorable to their digestion, and making it possible, 
where there are children, to provide for them without 
an entirely different menu ; for of course these dishes, so 
hard to digest, would be withheld from children entirely. 
Dishes which contain large amounts of fat and protein 
are always slow of digestion and should be eaten with 
simple carbohydrate food. Thus, chicken salad with 
mayonnaise dressing, eaten with bread and butter (the 
butter in moderation), may make an acceptable luncheon, 
but if we add a cup of rich chocolate with whipped 
cream, the chances of a good appetite for dinner are 
decreased, and unless the person is active and out of 
doors, the effect is apt to be bad in the long run, if a 
headache does not immediately follow. Foods which 
are fried in small pieces, so as to be well loaded with 
fat, are to be used sparingly and in combination with 
those having little or no fat. Thus, fried potatoes "go 
with" lean meat like beef or mutton, and not with fat 
pork or bacon. Foods fried in large pieces are not 
necessarily loaded with fat, but their texture is often 
objectionable. This is the case with fritters, hot dough- 



204 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

nuts, and the like. They form pasty masses like other 
hot breads, and should not be used in the same meal 
with such breads, pastry, or rich cake. 

Concentrated foods should be served with something 
which will serve to dilute them. Thus cheese, a con- 
centrated protein food, is served with crackers, or com- 
bined with a white sauce and served on toast ; or mixed 
with macaroni, rice, hominy, bread, etc., in various 
dishes. Eaten in this way, it loses its reputation for 
being indigestible. Butter, a concentrated fat food, is 
eaten with bread or potatoes; foods mildly sweetened 
with sugar are more wholesome than rich preserves, 
cake, or candy. Small portions of many foods can be 
well borne where larger ones would do harm, because 
they are diluted by the rest of the meal. 

Foods which stimulate digestive juices should precede 
those which are negative or tend to retard the flow. 
Thus, soup precedes other foods; meat is also served 
near the beginning of the meal. 

Foods which promote appetite are placed early in the 
meal, as fresh fruit for breakfast. Sweets, which dull 
appetite, should be reserved till the last. 

Some people are sensitive to certain combinations 
which others eat with ease. This can be explained only 
by some peculiarity of the individual. Impressions that 
certain combinations do not agree are often based on 
very Uttle evidence ; but if repeated and unprejudiced 
experiments give always the same result, the trouble- 
some combination should, of course, be avoided by that 
person. Sometimes the trouble comes from putting 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 205 

together too concentrated foods. Acids taken with 
sweet milk tend to make the milk form hard curds in 
the stomach, which of course interferes with digestion. 

Catsups, pickles, and highly spiced or very sweet 
foods of all sorts are irritating to the delicate walls of 
the alimentary tract and should be used sparingly by 
the robust, never by invalids, children, or any of deli- 
cate digestion. 

Food Combinations from the Esthetic Standpoint 

A balanced meal does not necessarily mean an artistic 
one. Graham bread and milk will sustain a man for 
months, but most people would find it uninteresting in a 
few days and actually palling on the appetite in a week 
or two. The human being exhibits two psychological 
tendencies in his diet — one, to stand by the old favor- 
ites ; the other, to demand variety from day to day. A 
very radical change in diet is apt to upset digestion. 
Foreigners suffer from the strange food in, a new coun- 
try as much as from lack of other familiar associations. 
Some one has said that accUmatization is largely a 
matter of getting used to the food, and certainly this is 
an important part. So we find a diet made up of cer- 
tain staples, like bread and butter and potatoes, wel- 
comed daily, along with variables of all sorts, which 
aelp to keep up the appetite as well as to insure the 
presence of the different food elements required by the 
body. The menu maker needs to steer a medium course ; 
to recognize this love of variety and yet not to cater to 
It to an urmecessary extent. A well-balanced diet, even 



2o6 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

if monotonous, will be more satisfying in the long run 
than an ill-balanced one. The first thing to see to, 
then, as already indicated, is that the different food 
elements are represented each day in some form. Then 
attention may be turned to that variety which comes 
from differences in form, color, flavor, and texture of 
foods, so prized by the expert in gastronomies. The 
aim of the artist is to arrange a meal not only whole- 
some, but a joy to all the senses. So long as beauty is 
a part of life, and the spirit more than meat, the house- 
wife will take pride in assembling her family about a 
board which deUghts the eye and "makes the mouth 
water." Her great care must be, if this spirit is strong 
in her, to see that she does not sacrifice real body wel- 
fare to the eye and the palate. 

Not all have a natural gift for making happy food 
combinations, and many have little opportunity to study 
the achievements of others. A visit to a good hotel, 
restaurant, or tea room, with careful study of the table 
d'hote menus, wiU often furnish new ideas for the home 
table. So to exchange meals with a neighbor and to 
compare notes on menus is interesting and instructive. 
Most home magazines furnish menus, and these may 
well be kept as an aid when one's own ingenuity fails. 
But there are a few working principles which may at 
least keep one from committing great gastronomic 
blunders, and really help in securing a well-balanced 
diet from day to day. 

In the first place, take the day as a unit in planning 
rather than the single meal ; or, better still, plan for the 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 207 

week or the month ; at least remember that there should 
be some variation from week to week and month to 
month. In the country, the natural procession of the 
seasons helps to secure this wider variety. In the city, 
where hothouse products or those from other districts 
press close on the heels of those from near-by territory, 
season is more apt to be lost sight of. But here one 
should learn to use the maximum amount for the year 
in the height of a given food's season. We may, for 
instance, serve cantaloupe in New York from April to 
November, but it is better for artistic as well as economic 
reasons to limit our freest use of the melon to August 
and September, when it is Ukely to be at its best. 

Impressions carry over strongly from one meal to the 
next and from one day to the next. So, with the excep- 
tion of certain staples (usually mild in character), such 
as bread, butter, milk, and the like, try to avoid serving 
any food in the same form twice in the same day, and, 
better still, avoid repeating it the same day in any form. 
When storage facilities are poor and perishable food has 
to be used up quickly, of course such a rule cannot be 
rigidly adhered to. And in the country, where a crop 
Uke strawberries must be enjoyed to the full in its short 
season, the effect of variety is gotten chiefly by varying 
the form in which the food is served. Thus, we may 
have plain, unhulled berries surrounding a mound of 
sugar for breakfast, a berry float, or sherbet for dinner, 
and get a very different impression from the dishes. 
So the country housewife welcomes the little book of 
Apples in One Hundred Ways and others of its kind. 



2o8 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

whereas the city housekeeper, who has perhaps ten or 
fifteen kinds of fruit at her command at one time, may 
get her variety simply by changing the species, and is 
less concerned with different ways of preparing each 
kind. In fact, she is foolish to spend time in making 
elaborate dishes when she can get her variety so largely 
by careful marketing. 

Another good rule is to avoid serving a food which 
gives its pronounced character to a dish twice in the 
same meal, even in different forms. How often we see 
tomato soup, tomato catsup, and tomato salad on the 
same dinner table! Or find soup, meat, and salad 
flavored with onions, and perhaps onions served as a 
vegetable also. Care should be taken in cookery to 
develop the natural flavor of each kind of food, and to 
add extra flavors sparingly, so that they may be fully 
enjoyed when they are used. 

Serving meals in courses helps to heighten artistic 
effect, and is often easier than getting everything on the 
table at once. Courses should contrast with one an- 
other ; a bland one, then a more highly flavored one ; 
a hot one and then a cold one ; a fluid one and then a 
soHd one. The last course should have a pleasant after- 
taste. This is especially emphasized in a formal meal 
like dinner. Some people prefer a sweet dessert, others 
cheese, still others coffee or fruit. 

Individual courses may consist of one or more dishes. 
In general, the larger the number of courses, the simpler 
each one should be. A meal may consist of a single 
course and still be artistic in effect, exhibiting contrasts 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 209 

and harmonies within itself. Broiled steak, potato balls, 
watercress, bread and butter, coffee, and fruit not only- 
make a satisfying meal, but show contrasts of form, as 
between the potato balls and the steak; of color, em- 
phasized by the cress and the fruit; of texture, part 
being good to chew, part soft, part crisp, and part 
succulent. On the other hand, a meal composed of 
cheese fondue, sweet potatoes, creamed carrots, baked 
bananas, and bread and butter would be equally good 
from the nutritive point of view, but would weary the 
eye by sameness of color and the palate by sameness of 
texture and, to some extent, of flavor. Many popular 
combinations offer sharp contrasts in texture — crackers 
and cheese, tea and toast, ice cream and cake ; in fact, 
this kind of contrast seems to play almost as important 
a part in creating a pleasing effect as good combinations 
of flavor. Of the latter, there are many familiar ex- 
amples; cranberry or other acid fruit sauce with fowl 
and game, mint or peas with lamb, apples with pork, 
tomatoes with cheese or beef. But it is a mistake to 
adhere too closely to conventional combinations. Goose- 
berries are quite as pleasing with chicken as are cran- 
berries ; apples are good with beef, and many combina- 
tions may be devised which give pleasing effects and 
make the often used foods seem ''different." One secret 
in the happy use of leftovers is to place them in entirely 
different surroundings from those in which they were 
first served ; in another meal, perhaps, or at least with 
other kinds of food. Thus, macaroni served creamed 
with roast beef for dinner, if not all used, may be made 



2IO FEEDING THE FAMILY 

into croquettes and served for luncheon with a cheese 
sauce. Allowing a considerable interval of time between 
repetitions of the same dish is another help in creating 
a sense of novelty. If possible, keep to-day's leftovers 
till day after to-morrow ; repeat a favorite food once in 
ten days or two weeks, instead of regularly every week. 
Even changing the dish in which the food is served will 
often have an evident effect on the appetites of the family. 
Mrs. Richards, in one of her numerous "dietary sur- 
veys," found the girls of a certain school refusing en 
masse a dessert served in a large baking dish. It was 
put away till the next day, turned out in a fine mold, 
and the girls not only ate it, but demanded more ! A 
consideration of the menu — the selection and service 
of foods in a meal — is worth while because it will help 
the housewife to make her family eat the foods which 
they ought to have. Skill in cookery and genius in 
food combination are only means to this end. The ideal 
meal is a simple one — whether of one or several courses 
— in which the different types of food are harmoniously 
represented, but not repeated, and in which food acces- 
sories, such as pickles, spices, preserves, and the Uke, 
are little needed because the foods themselves are well 
cooked and each contributes its own characteristic 
flavor, texture, form, and color to the making of a well- 
blended whole. 

Stunmer and Winter Menus 

Spells of hot weather have always been accounted 
disastrous to babies. The well-organized infant welfare 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 211 

work of some of our larger cities has taken account of 
the fact that more babies die in July and August than 
in other months of the year and makes preparation for 
a regular summer campaign for the purpose of remedy- 
ing this sad condition. While its activities include all 
kinds of hygienic measures — cleanliness, protection 
from flies, suitable clothing, etc. — the matter which 
receives most attention, as most important, is that of 
food. With this properly supplied, illness and death 
both decrease strikingly. 

In the case of older children and adults, hot weather 
does not work such havoc, but it does render every one 
more susceptible to nutritional disturbances and it is 
well to recognize this in planning the family meals. 
Sudden and extreme changes in the weather are especially 
trying and often go unsuspected as the cause of digestive 
difficulties. When the temperature suddenly drops 
after a few days of intense heat (especially with high 
humidity), one often notes in the newspapers that several 
prominent men have been stricken about the same time 
with acute indigestion, and remarks on the coincidence, 
especially if a number of one's own acquaintances are 
having the same experience. It is quite hkely that 
the weather is at least in part to blame, and one should 
be particularly cautious about dietary indiscretions and 
chill when the thermometer is falling rapidly in the 
summer time. 

Before the days of canning and cold storage it was 
often quite difficult to have much variety in the winter 
diet, especially towards spring, when the supply of home 



212 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

preserved fruits and vegetables began to give out. Salt 
meats and potatoes many times formed the bulk of the 
ration, and undoubtedly some of the ash constituents 
were not very well represented, the value of milk as a 
supplement to such a diet being quite unrealized. So it 
came about that a low nutritional state was expected 
with the warm days of spring, and dosing with "treacle 
and sulphur" was not limited to Mrs. Squeers of Dothe- 
boys' Hall. To-day, with our vastly improved facili- 
ties for a rational diet throughout the year, fruits and 
green vegetables, canned if not actually fresh, take the 
place of "blood medicines," and one may expect to be as 
healthy in the spring as at any other time of year. 

But warm days do bring a muscular relaxation which 
reacts on the digestive tract as well as the rest of the 
body, and it needs to have its task lightened somewhat, 
if we do not wish to run the risk of an upset. While 
increases in atmospheric temperature do not affect the 
activities which go on internally, the amount of energy 
transformed in muscular work is apt to be more or less 
unconsciously reduced, and it is well to diminish the 
energy intake somewhat. Even if muscular work goes 
on as in cold weather, there is apt to be a lessened mus- 
cular tension in sleep, or when resting, and even if there 
were not, it would be wise to eat a little less for a few 
days till the body had adapted itself to the weather. 
With lessened amount of food there should go care to 
choose those things which are most likely to prove easy 
of digestion — simple dishes and not too many kinds in 
any one meal. Foods rich in fat, which, as we have 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 213 

seen, is of all the foodstuffs the most likely to retard 
digestion, should be withheld — pastries, cakes, sauces, 
and gravies. Hot breads, particularly with syrups or 
honey, are especially liable to fermentation at such a 
time. Protein foods, which, as already pointed out, 
most deserve the term *' heating foods," should be used 
in moderation. The diet should consist of a very 
moderate allowance of lean meat, or its equivalent in 
eggs, cheese, milk, or other meat substitute ; vegetables 
very simply cooked, as baked potatoes, boiled onions; 
or served as crisp salads dressed with French dressing, 
cream dressing (cream and vinegar), or merely a little 
vinegar and seasonings; fruits, cooked when there is 
any doubt as to perfect ripeness or in the person any 
tendency for them to disagree, and eaten in moderation. 
Cold desserts, of gelatin, cornstarch, tapioca, or frozen 
milk or fruit juices, are not only easy of digestion, but 
refreshing. If taken slowly at the end of a meal, frozen 
dishes will not chill the stomach unduly. This is much 
better than icing the stomach at the soda fountain 
between meals. If it is impossible to resist its tempta- 
tions, it is much better to take a plain soda or phosphate, 
lemonade, iced tea, or grape juice, than to indulge in 
ice cream sodas or sundaes. In any case, care should 
be taken not to drink cold beverages rapidly when warm. 
The shock to the nerves of the stomach is never good, 
and may be very severe. 

Since the body goes on generating heat at the same 
rate internally whether the weather be hot or warm, 
the problem of physical comfort in the summer time is 



214 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

one of getting rid of the heat generated. Any physical 
activity, of course, increases the amount to be dissipated 
into the surrounding atmosphere. We may facilitate 
this heat loss by Hghter clothing, by fanning, by cooling 
baths, or by inducing perspiration if conditions are favor- 
able for its speedy evaporation. This is the reason hot 
beverages prove cooling to some. On days when the 
humidity is high this method will not work. The warm 
beverage will only add to the total discomfort. Cold 
beverages will take body heat to warm them in the 
stomach and will carry away body heat when their water 
is eUminated, and therefore they are very valuable if 
not taken too cold or too fast. 

Another factor in nutrition in warm weather is the 
fact that bacteria flourish at an amazing rate, and extra 
care must be taken to guard against spoiled food. Even 
in the refrigerator there is not always safety. Many 
ice boxes are so poorly constructed that their temperature 
rises with that of the surrounding air, and food is poorly 
protected. Especial care should be taken of protein 
foods, such as meat and milk. 

In planning a menu for a hot day, it must be remem- 
bered that eating habits cannot be radically changed on 
short notice, without danger of a digestive upset. It is 
not well to give a person accustomed to hot food entirely 
cold meals. One hot dish can be provided without much 
di£&culty — a beverage if nothing else. The following

menus :

In cold weather any excess of food beyond immediate 
needs is apt to be taken care of with greater ease than 
in summer, and energy requirements often are sJightly 
higher, as cold stimulates to higher muscular tension and 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 217 

greater physical activity. This does not apply, of course, 
to one who lives in hot, close rooms at summer tempera- 
ture during the winter months. Most people get enough 
stimulus from the cold to have a little better appetite 
and a little higher food requirement in winter than in 
summer. But the most marked difference is usually in 
digestive power. Dishes may safely appear in the 
winter menu which would be out of place in warm 
weather. Buckwheat cakes, sausage, doughnuts, baked 
beans, and mince pie are commonly recognized as winter 
foods, though it is well to remember that even then 
they have little place in the dietary of sedentary per- 
sons. The man who goes to work out of doors on an 
icy morning will find a breakfast of fried mush and 
sausage well suited to his needs. He can digest fat 
meats and other kinds of food rich in fat without any 
trouble. A liberal supply of protein will help to give 
him a feeling of warmth, and the conditions of outdoor 
life usually insure him against harm from an excess of 
nitrogenous waste products, though in special cases an 
excess of meat may cause trouble. Esquimaux thrive 
on a diet in which protein may contribute 40 per cent 
of the total energy value of the diet, and turn the heating 
properties of the protein to good account in the severe 
cold, whereas in a warmer climate such high protein 
would be at least a waste of good fuel, if not actually 
harmful. But the sedentary person needs at all times 
to be careful neither to overtax his digestive system nor 
to overeat, and children must be protected in winter as 
well as summer against rich and heavy food.

CHAPTER XIII 

FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: COST OF 

FOOD 

It is comparatively easy to plan attractive menus if 
one does not have to count the cost of materials nor of 
the labor required in preparation and service, though, 
of course, it can never be done without some time 
and thought. With plenty of money, the great danger 
is in the line of over-elaboration, which is not only 
inartistic, but tempts to overeating and waste of food. 
It is better to gratify one's esthetic taste by excellence 
of quality in food and service than by a multiplicity of 
dishes. Especially to be shunned are dishes made over- 
rich with cream and butter, which are not only expensive 
but upset digestion. 

For most people, cost is a large factor in the feeding 
problem; from one-half to one-fourth of the family 
income has to be devoted to buying food, and the smaller 
the income the larger the percentage which must be so 
spent. Fortunately there is no vital connection between 
nutritive value and cost. Nutritious and expensive are 
not synonymous; in fact, some of the most nutritious 
foods are the cheapest. Cost alone is, therefore, a poor 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP : COST OF FOOD 221 

guide for the housewife in determining what she will 
feed her family. She needs to know some of the factors 
which influence the cost of food in order to make wise 
selection, especially if she has to try continually to 
make one doUar do the work of two. 

Factors in the Market Cost of Food 

One of the factors in the cost of food is the amount of 
labor and price of material required to produce it. A 
potato is cheap, and one will produce several dozen 
with very little work on the part of the planter. Hence 
potatoes rank as cheap food. Fish, which forage for 
themselves and have only to be caught and brought to 
market, make cheap meat. Under pioneer conditions 
meat is, in general, cheap, since it comes from wild 
animals. But when grain has to be raised to feed cattle 
for beef, the cost of the animal's food and care makes 
meat dear. In this country we have just recently felt 
the effect of the passing of the great western grazing 
fields in the increased cost of beef, and our present 
hope of keeping this kind of food within reach of our 
pocketbooks lies in the utilization of the vast plains of 
South America, where food for the animals may still be 
had for nothing. Meat from Argentine cannot, how- 
ever, be as cheap as that caught near one's own door, 
because of the cost of transportation. 

Cost of transportation played a small part in domestic 
economy before the days of express or fast freight and 
refrigerator cars. But to-day we bring together in one 
market apples from Oregon, melons from California, 



222 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

olive oil from Spain — food products from almost every 
quarter of the globe — and the expense of this trans- 
portation must be added to the original cost of produc- 
tion. The cost of foods out of season is very largely 
due to their having been brought from a distance. 

With the best of facilities for transportation, many 
foods deteriorate in transit, and any percentage of loss 
must also be added to their cost. So perishability be- 
comes another factor to be reckoned with. If a carload 
of peaches goes to market, and half of them spoil before 
they reach the retail buyer, she will have to pay twice 
as much for what she gets as she would if they had all 
kept perfectly. Cereal products, dried foods of various 
kinds, potatoes, onions, and other foods which keep very 
well, are always cheap as compared with strawberries, 
raspberries, lettuce, and the like, which require careful 
handling and will not keep long under the most favor- 
able conditions. With the development of cold storage, 
perishability is not so great a factor as formerly, but we 
still have to add the storage charge, and to take into 
account the fact that foods taken out of cold storage 
deteriorate with extra speed, so that the cost cannot 
be as low as for fresh goods delivered to a near-by 
market. 

Canning reduces the loss due to perishability and 
makes transportation of food products simpler, but one 
must pay for the labor involved in the process as well 
as the materials, so that canned goods are to be ranked 
as intermediate in price between dried foods and fresh 
ones, at least under city conditions. 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: COST OF FOOD 223 

The way in which goods are put up for the market 
will afifect the cost. Package goods are more expensive 
than the same material in bulk; small packages cost 
more in proportion than large ones; fancy wrappers 
often bring a fancy price. Elegant shops and immediate 
delivery add materially to the original cost. The extra 
charge for package goods is often worth paying, because 
greater cleanliness is assured, and sealing keeps the 
material in better condition, to say nothing of the greater 
ease of storage at home. A small package is a better 
investment than a large one, if part of the large one 
would spoil before it could be used up. But these things 
should be realized by the purchaser. Twenty-five cents 
invested in two jars of peanut butter, one costing 15 
cents, the other 10, will yield 10 ounces of food, while a 
single 25 cent jar will contain 12 ounces, so that one 
saves over four cents (a gain of 20 per cent) on the larger 
purchase. Each housekeeper must decide for herself 
where the danger of loss and inconvenience of storage 
counterbalances the gain from large quantity bujdng, 
but the tendency in cities is to buy in unnecessarily 
small quantities, not only because storage space is 
precious, but because it is so easy to replenish one's 
larder quickly. In the country, where space is available, 
there may be the opposite danger of buying in such 
large quantities that the food either deteriorates before 
it is used up, or a great deal of extra care must be given 
to keep it in proper condition. 

Many foods bring high prices because of the esthetic 
appeal which they make to the consumer. Size and 



224 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

shape, color, flavor, and texture all play their parts in 
this appeal. Tender beef is preferred to tough, and, 
since a comparatively small part of each creature is 
tender, the law of supply and demand sends up the 
price. Large red apples are more attractive than small 
green ones, though the latter may actually have a better 
flavor. OUve oil is preferred to cottonseed on account 
of the difference in flavor, though the nutritive value is 
the same. In some markets white eggs are preferred 
to brown. It is hard to separate this idea of esthetic 
appeal from nutritive value. We are all inclined to 
think the foods which we like are good for us, and ap- 
pearance and flavor attract or repel very quickly; but 
so far as real nourishment goes, these things are second- 
ary, and the household provider must be able to dis- 
criminate between real nutritive value and other factors, 
in order to spend her money to the best advantage. 
Just as the finest-looking food of a given kind may not 
give the best return in nutritive value for the money 
spent, the cheapest form of the same goods may be an 
equally bad investment. A peck of apples so small and 
gnarled that more than the average amount of waste is 
produced in paring and coring may be dearer than larger 
ones at a Kttle higher price. A pound of prunes in 
which there is Httle flesh and much skin and stone may 
be bought for five or six cents, but will be satisfactory 
neither as regards nutritive value nor flavor; one will 
get a better return on one's money by spending for this 
fruit at least eight or lo, preferably 12, cents a pound. 
A piece of corned beef at 18 cents a pound may have 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP : COST OF FOOD 225 

so much bone and fat that the lean cooked meat will 
have cost fully 50 cents per pound, while a rump roast 
of beef at 25 cents a pound will yield lean cooked meat 
costing only 35 cents per pound. Unless the fat of the 
corned beef is eaten, it will not be as economical a 
purchase as the rump, though the first cost is less and 
the total number of Calories per pound is greater. Fat 
meat is never profitable unless the fat is used for food. 

Market Cost and Fuel Value 

One cannot say, then, that either the dearest or 
cheapest in food is the best to buy. The first cost gives 
no direct clue to the real part which a food will play in 
the domestic economy, and different conditions of Hving 
must determine what it is wise to buy. 

If our food allowance is liberal and the fuel require- 
ments of our family low, we may indulge more freely in 
food materials for the sake of their esthetic appeal. 
But if we are trying to make every cent go as far as it 
will toward supplying actual nourishment, we must 
think, not only in terms of market conditions, but of 
nutritive value. As Professor Graham Lusk has so 
often earnestly pointed out, it would be a great ad- 
vantage to the purchaser if the manufacturers of all 
kinds of package goods would not only indicate the 
nature of the contents (as they are now required by 
law to do), but also say, "This package contains — 
Calories of which — are protein." The housewife, 
looking along the cereal shelf, would then see something 
like this:

The most casual inspection of the above shows that 
of all these cereal products rolled oats gives the best 
return for the money. Even taking into account that 
it requires long, slow cooking, it is cheaper than one of 
the cheapest ready-to-eat cereals — cornflakes. It may 
be perfectly legitimate to serve puffed wheat now and 
then, but it should be with full consciousness that one 
is paying about three-fourths for a special mode of 
preparation and one-fourth for actual fuel value. 

In canned goods there is a great amount of difference in 
fuel value, even with the same kind of food, owing to dif- 
ferences in the amount of water used to fill up the can and 
in the amount of sugar in sweetened products. At pres- 
ent the only way for the housewife to protect herself is 
to make her own observations on the amount of "solids" 
which she gets for her money, the richness of the syrup, 
etc., and buy those brands which give the best values.*

The discrepancy between nutritive value and cost is 
nowhere better seen than in a comparison of milk with 
other high protein foods. A quart of milk yielding 
675 Calories and costing, let us say, nine cents, is the 
equivalent in fuel value of about one pound of lean round 
steak, costing over 20 cents, or of nine eggs, which 
would be cheap at 18 cents. Even more striking is 
the case of oysters. A quart of solid oysters is equiva- 
lent in fuel to one quart of milk, but wiU cost from 
seven to eight times as much as milk at nine cents per 
quart. 

In the restaurant, a menu card indicating the fuel 
value of the different dishes would help the patron to 
choose his meal with better regard to his food needs 
and the state of his pocketbook. In the interesting and 
valuable study of 350 portions of food as sold to guests 
in Child s' Restaurants in New York City already re- 
ferred to (see page 176), the authors make the following 
summary of their investigations.^ Dishes are classified 
in the ordinary fashion as pastry, meats, soups, etc., 
and the first column of figures in the table gives the 
mean nutritional value for five cents for each class of 
dish. The succeeding columns state the particular 
dishes within the class which represent the maximum 
and minimum of fuel value for that group.

In the first case, a man would get four-fifths of an

These comparisons include, of course, cost of labor 
and service, and therefore differ from those which the 
housewife makes in purchasing raw materials, but they 
serve to show that cost offers no true criterion as to 
nutritive value. 



230 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

For ordinary purposes of comparison, the loo-Calorie 
portion serves as a most convenient unit, and in the Appen- 
dix will be found tables (see pp. 332 and 355) classifying 
practically all the foods used in the dietaries in this book, 
or regarded as common household staples. These give 
only the cost of food materials; they do not include 
charges for fuel and labor. Good food cannot be bought 
for nothing. There are to-day very few kinds which cost 
less than one-third of a cent per 100 Calories. These are 
mostly cereal products, such as cornmeal, rolled oats, 
hominy, and flour; fats, such as cottonseed oil, suet, 
lard, and lard substitutes; sugar, molasses, and corn 
sjnnip; and dried peas. A somewhat longer list may 
be had for half a cent per 100 Calories, including pearl 
barley and flaked wheat, dried beans, bread, and salt 
pork, while for from two-thirds to three-quarters of a 
cent we may extend our list to cornstarch, cornflakes^ 
plain crackers, butter at 24 cents per pound, or oleo- 
margarine, lentils, macaroni, rice, tapioca, and dates. 
It will be observed that all of these foods belong to the 
non-perishable, easily transported class; meat, milk, 
eggs, fresh fruits, and vegetables are not included. For 
one cent per 100 Calories we may add bacon, olive oil, 
cabbage, carrots, potatoes, peanuts, dried apples and 
prunes, and milk at six cents per quart. In the coun- 
try, where fruits and vegetables are comparatively 
cheap, it will be possible to have a greater variety of 
food materials than this without going beyond one cent 
per 100 Calories, but in the city fresh fruits and vege- 
tables will range from two cents per 100 Calories for 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP : COST OF FOOD 231 

apples, onions, and cabbage, to 20 or 30 cents for 
asparagus, celery, and choice melons. Most meats ex- 
ceed two cents per 100 Calories and choice cuts exceed 
four cents per 100 Calories. It is by study of these 
relative values and judicious combinations of the inex- 
pensive with the more costly foods that the housewife 
controls her expenditure and yet provides ''meals that 
shall be at once gratifying, satisfying, and fundamentally 
right." 

Cost of Other Nutritive Factors 

Feeding a family on a small income is no mean task. 
It demands intelligence and much thought, knowledge 
both of food values and human needs. One cannot 
become a finished mistress of the art in a week or a year, 
but the reward of patient study comes, not only in the 
saving which may be effected in the cost of hving, but 
also in the increased happiness and efl&ciency of the 
well-nourished family and the personal satisfaction of 
ceasing to grope blindly (which is drudgery) and acquir- 
ing a conscious power over one's environment, which 
makes even the difficult task interesting and joyous. 

So far the discussion of cost has dealt with food chiefly 
in relation to fuel value. But we cannot rest content 
with learning which foods give us the most Calories for 
our money. We must consider the price which we shall 
pay for building material — protein, iron, calcium, phos- 
phorus,^ etc. ; and for base-forming and other regulat- 
ing factors in the diet. Sugar and oatmeal have the 

1 See pages 21-25. 



232 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

same fuel value per pound (1800 Calories) and can be 
bought for the same price. On the basis of Calories they 
are, therefore, equivalent. But a pound of sugar yields 
nothing but fuel, while a pound of oatmeal will furnish 
300 of its Calories in the form of protein, and will also 
yield over half a gram of calcium oxide, or nearly the 
whole day's requirement for a man; nearly four grams 
of phosphoric acid, which gives a good margin of safety 
above his daily need; and 16 one-thousandths of a 
gram of iron, which is a very liberal day's supply. We 
shall realize what a very cheap food oatmeal is as com- 
pared with sugar (which seems at first equally cheap) 
if we stop to consider what we shall have to pay to get 
from other foods the protein and ash constituents which 
the sugar lacks. Suppose we buy 300 protein Calories 
in the form of lean round steak : they will cost us 23.4 
cents, estimating the market cost of the meat as 28 
cents per pound. In buying 300 protein Calories from 
oatmeal for five cents we got 1500 additional Calories; 
from the meat for our 23 cents we shall get only 250, 
which is small compensation for the difference in cost. 
From the beef we shall also get about one-tenth as much 
calcium as from the oatmeal, less than one-third as 
much phosphorus, and about five-sixths as much iron. 
Hence, we shall have to go on spending more money 
to make up these missing amounts, and will begin 
to inquire how we can get the rest of them most 
cheaply. 

We shall find that the cheapest source of calcium is 
milk, and, as milk is also rich in protein and phosphorus, 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP : COST OF FOOD 233 

it will be interesting to see with what economy we can 
substitute milk for beef altogether. To secure 300 pro- 
tein Calories we shall require about two and one-third 
quarts of milk, costing, at nine cents per quart, 20.7 
cents. Since 300 protein Calories from beef cost 23.4 
cents, we have saved 2.7 cents, or 11.5 per cent, on our 
investment for protein. At the same time we shall 
find that we have obtained over 1200 Calories in addi- 
tion to our protein Calories Xnearly as many as from the 
oatmeal) as against a surplus of 250 Calories from the 
meat ; 68 times as much calcium oxide, and over three 
times as much phosphoric acid. The only lack will be 
iron, of which we get about half as much as from the 
meat, but here again the milk has the advantage that 
its iron is in a specially available form and more likely 
to be completely utilized than that of meat. Granting 
that we must buy some food to supply the rest of the 
iron, the milk will be cheaper than the meat, to supple- 
ment which we shall need to purchase calcium, phos- 
phorus, and iron, and probably Calories too.^ 

Protein foods are, as a rule, a more expensive item in

the dietary than carbohydrates and fats. This is partly 
because we like them in delicate, perishable, and highly 
flavored forms, such as meat, fish, and shell fish. From 
the nutritive point of view, eggs, cheese, and milk are 
interchangeable with them, and can usually be substi- 
tuted with real economy. The grains and breadstuffs 
can also be depended upon to a considerable extent, 
having about the same proportion of protein to total 
fuel value that we aim to have in a well-balanced diet,

i.e., 10 to 15 per cent of their Calories in the form of 
protein. The dried legumes — beans, peas, lentils, 
peanuts — are always cheap sources of protein. We 
must bear in mind, of course, that proteins differ some- 
what in their nutritive properties, and that milk and 
eggs have a fuller quota of the proteins which promote 
growth than the cereals and legumes, so that we should 
not depend exclusively upon the latter in feeding chil- 
dren, nor, if we can afford to do otherwise, even in feed- 
ing adults. The table on page 234 shows the cost of the 
amounts of different food materials which will yield 100 
protein Calories, and serves as a rough measure of the 
relative economy of these foods as sources of protein. 

It is worth while to compare in a similar fashion some 
of the foods which are the best sources of the different 
ash constituents, especially calcium, phosphorus, and 
iron. In the three tables following the foods are arranged 
in order of the amount of money required to purchase 
enough of any one to yield a quantity of the element 
under consideration sufficient to meet an adult man's 
daily requirement. 

From an inspection of these tables it is easy to see 
that some foods are cheap from all points of view ; thus, 
dried beans, costing half a cent per 100 Calories for fuel, 
are also the cheapest food for protein and for iron, next 
to the cheapest for phosphorus, and included in the 
cheapest 10 for calcium. Milk is a fairly economical 
source of fuel, protein, and phosphorus, exceptionally 
cheap for calcium, and dear only for iron, a condition 
compensated again in part by the fact that its iron is

This is particularly noticeable when we compare it with

some of the green vegetables, which in general are expen- 
sive sources of fuel and protein. String beans afford 
noticeably cheap calcium, iron, and phosphorus; and 
spinach and lettuce compare very favorably with other 
foods as sources of iron. Eggs are hardly to be regarded 
as cheap from any point of view, if we compare them 
with peas, beans, and cereals. But if we compare them 
with other perishable protein food, like meat, it is evi- 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP : COST OF FOOD 239 

dent that when they do not exceed 25 cents per dozen 
they may be regarded as a substitute for the cheaper 
cuts of meat, and when they cost as much as 36 cents 
per dozen they are, by the balancing of counts, cheaper 
than porterhouse steak and other expensive kinds of 
meat. We have also to bear in mind here that the pro- 
tein, iron, and phosphorus in eggs are considered un- 
usually available to the body, so that their use may be 
justified, even if they have strong rivals in the economic 
field. 

The market price of fresh fruits varies so greatly that 
no attempt has been made to include them in these 
tables. They are negligible as regards protein, but are 
useful sources of the ash constituents, though as a rule 
more expensive than the green vegetables which have 
been chosen for illustration. They are especially valu- 
able in the diet for their pleasing flavors and for their 
tendency to counteract acidity in the blood or other 
body fluids. A food hke oatmeal, cheap as a source of 
fuel, protein, calcium, phosphorus, and iron, cannot be 
used as the sole article of diet, because its tendency is 
to create an acid condition in the body, the alkalinity 
of its ash not being sufficient to neutralize the acids 
formed from its proteins. So with oatmeal we need 
a fruit or a vegetable to supply this needed alkali in 
the best way. The same is true of other cereals, of eggs, 
meat, and other high protein foods, with the exception 
of milk. It must also be borne in mind that fruits 
are exceedingly useful in counteracting constipation 
and intestinal putrefaction. In the well-balanced diet,

therefore, fruits and vegetables have a real place, 
aside from their fuel and iron value, and at least as 
much money should be spent for them as for meat, 
eggs, and fish. 



CHAPTER XIV 

FOOD FOR THE FAMH^Y GROUP: FOOD 
PLANS AND DIETARIES 

A SIMPLE, well-balanced menu provided from day to 
day for a family group of healthy persons with reason- 
able appetites ought to go a long ways toward insuring 
the continuance of health, and we have in experience 
abundant evidence that it will do so. The suggestions 
which have been made in the preceding chapters in 
regard to the special needs of persons of different ages 
and occupations can be in the main carried out without 
detailed calculations of quantities consumed or of food 
values obtained. But, since the fundamental basis of 
nutrition is in the last analysis a quantitative matter, 
the housewife has a surer grasp on the situation if she 
can now and then make a study of the amounts of nutri- 
tive material which her group is actually consuming. 
She will in this way find out whether there is a tendency 
toward over- or under-consumption, or toward a one- 
sided diet, and can modify her table accordingly. She 
can also discover, if she will, whether she is getting a 
good return for the money invested in her table supplies. 

It is proposed, therefore, in this chapter, to describe a 
s 241 



242 



FEEDING THE FAMILY 



simple way of planning family dietaries and to give 
some illustrations of what can be done with different 
sums of money towards securing nourishing fare. 

Planning a Family Dietary 

Since energy is the fundamental requirement in nutri- 
tion, we must have at the outset some idea of the fuel 
needs of our family group. Let us take for illustration 
a family consisting of a professional man, a woman 
doing all but the heaviest household tasks, a baby one 
year old, a boy three years old, two girls, six and nine, 
a boy of twelve, and a grandmother of ninety. From 
the data in preceding chapters we may estimate the 
requirements of the group as follows (assuming average 
body weights) :

' Allowing 10 to IS per cent of total fuel in the form of protein, which 
will be sufficient to cover all nitrogen requirements. 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 243 

Thus we find the total fuel requirement of our group 
is about 14,000 Calories. In the typical family, consist- 
ing of father, mother, and three children under fifteen, 
where the man's occupation is sedentary, the energy 
requirement usually ranges from 8500 to 10,000 Calories 
per day, depending upon the ages of the children. In 
a family of the same size, where the father is doing 
manual labor and often the mother also, the requirement 
will range from 12,000 to 14,000 Calories as a rule. The 
exact fuel intake will fluctuate somewhat from day to 
day, of course, with minor changes in the degree of 
activity of different members of the family, so all the 
housewife need aim to do is to keep the fuel supply 
fairly constant, without trying to make exact calcula- 
tions. A little care will prevent a feast of Calories one 
day and a famine the next. 

Essentials in the Family Dietary 

As a working basis in building up the family dietary, 
it is a good plan to make first a list of the food materials 
which need to be included in the day's rations, no matter 
what the particular menu. For the group which we are 
using by way of illustration there should be provided : 

MUk for all the children — one quart apiece if possible 
Fruit juice for the one-year-old 
One kind of fruit for the others 

Cereal for all the children — preferably for all the family 
A mild green vegetable for the three- and six-year-olds 
One kind of green vegetable for all the others except the baby 
Eggs for at least the three younger children and some protein dish 
(meat or a meat substitute) for the rest 



244 



FEEDING THE FAMILY 



To this Kst may be added those staples which are likely 
to appear in every day's menu, such as bread and 
butter. 

An estimate can quickly be made of the fuel that will 
be supplied by these essentials of the diet.

Planning the Menu 

Keeping in mind the fact that we are going to in- 
clude the above in the day's menu, we may next decide 
on the dishes which are to be served for some particular 
day. Usually the dinner will be planned first, as the 
most formal and substantial meal, and the meat dish 
taken as the key note. Suppose, then, we are to have 
baked fish, as halibut. This gives us a characteristic 
protein food, but not in a highly flavored form. We 
may, therefore, have a soup and salad of pronounced 
flavor, and develop the following menu of simple, whole- 
some dishes of which most of the family may partake, 
thus saving the labor of preparing special dishes for the 
very young and the very old. 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 245 

Dinner 

Consomme 

Baked halibut, egg sauce 

Potatoes on the half shell 

String beans, buttered 

Bread and butter 

Tomato salad, French dressing 

Apple snow with boiled custard 

Lady fingers 

This will serve for the father, the mother, and the 
two older children as it stands, and for the grandmother 
with the omission of the egg sauce, salad, and lady 
fingers, and a serving of the custard part of the apple 
float for her dessert. Her bread should be toasted or 
zwiebach be used. If this dinner be served at night, 
the younger children will have a simple supper before- 
hand; the baby at 5.30 and the three- and six-year-olds 
at the same time or just afterwards. It is always an 
advantage to serve the young children at a separate 
table, at least for all but one meal. Usually their meal 
hours do not coincide with those of the older members 
of the family, and if they do come to the adult table 
they need the undivided attention of some one to super- 
vise their eating. If that person is the mother, she does 
not have a chance to eat her own meal satisfactorily, 
and often goes undernourished. The children at their 
own table are less distracted by foods which they may 
not share, and more care can be given to their table 
manners, — a very important part of their education, 
for eating habits once formed are hard to break, and 



246 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

good ones are a valuable hygienic and sodal asset for 
every child. 

The character of the luncheon will depend largely 
upon the breakfast and the occupations of the different 
members of the family. In the city, some are Ukely to 
be away from home at midday, and luncheon is a less 
formal meal than where all gather together at noontime. 

Having planned the dinner, it is best to decide on the 
breakfast next. Assuming that a medium weight break- 
fast suits this family best, we might have 

Breakfast 

Oranges 

Wheatena with cream 

Puffy omelet with bacon 

Toast 

Coffee for adults 

Milk for children 

Before this is served, the baby will have had a cup of 
warm milk at six o'clock, and the three-year-old will have 
his breakfast just before the family breakfast (7 a.m.), 
or, if the hours for the two coincide, he may take his 
with the rest — orange juice, wheatena with top milk, 
toast, and milk to drink. After breakfast the baby will 
have one or two tablespoons of orange juice (8 a.m.) 
and at ten o'clock both these youngest children will have 
their lunch : strained oatmeal jelly with top milk and 
milk to drink, — or milk modified with cereal gruel, — for 
the baby, a glass of milk and a piece of stale bread 
or hard cracker for the three-year-old. It is to be hoped 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 247 

that the six-year-old will have a glass of milk and a 
cracker in the middle of the morning at school. 

Assuming that luncheon will be served for all the 
family except the two youngest, a suitable menu to fit 
the day's scheme would be : 

Luncheon 

Creamed chicken on toast 

Baked bananas 

Boston brown bread and butter 

Rice pudding 

Tea for adults 

Milk for children 

This luncheon will need no modification for the six- 
year-old except that the cream sauce only from the 
creamed chicken will be served on her toast. 

After the family luncheon the baby will have another 
meal (2 p.m.), consisting of milk, egg yolk, and possibly 
a little stale bread to chew; the three-year-old will at 
the same time have a soft-cooked egg, some toast, some 
strained vegetable or some of the baked banana served 
in the regular luncheon, rice pudding, and milk to drink. 

In the evening, before the family dinner, the three 
youngest will have their suppers : the baby, milk and 
cereal jelly, or milk modified with a cereal gruel; the 
three-year-old, cereal and milk, bread and butter, a 
little of the custard which is served with the apple snow 
for the family dinner, and milk to drink ; the six-year- 
old, cereal and milk, bread and butter, apple snow, lady 
fingers, and milk to drink. It would be an easy matter 



248 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

to arrange for baked potatoes for these two children's 
suppers, since potatoes on the half shell form part of the 
family dinner. 

Late in the evening (10 p.m.), the baby may require a 
bottle of warm milk, and the grandmother will enjoy a 
hot, nutritious beverage (such as hot milk, plain or 
flavored) and a cracker; but these meals entail little 
work by way of preparation. 

It is possible, therefore, by choosing simple, easily 
digested foods for the general menu (which are good for 
everybody), to provide for the special needs of the chil- 
dren without much extra cooking, even if meals must be 
served at a good many times during the day. 

Calculation of the Family Dietary 

Having now estimated the quantitative needs of our 
family for protein and fuel, and planned a menu designed 
to give everybody something suitable to eat, our next 
aim is to find out how nearly this will fulfill the theo- 
retical requirements. We must make a list of the 
amounts to be served and then, by reference to the 
tables in the Appendix, especially those of loo-Calorie 
portions (Table I), and those giving food values in 
terms of common measures (Table II), we can very 
quickly estimate fuel values for the day. The dietary 
is given in detail below :

252 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Comparing our totals with the estimated day's re- 
quirements, we find that we have almost our full quota 
of fuel, and a very hberal supply of protein, much of 
which is from milk, so that we know it will satisfy the 
protein needs of the growing children in the best possi- 
ble way. The adults will get their protein largely from 
the halibut, chicken, and eggs, supplemented by milk, 
cereals, and bread. Checking oJff the list of essentials 
for the diet (see page 243) we find that we have used a 
little over six quarts of milk, nearly 600 Calories of 
cereal in the form of oatmeal and wheatena ; have sup- 
plied five eggs and one yolk in addition to those used in 
the egg sauce, apple snow, custard, and lady fingers; 
over 900 Calories in the form of fruit; 226 in green 
vegetables (string beans, tomatoes, lettuce, pea pulp) ; 
fully 1500 each in butter and bread; and a Httle more 
than 1000 in the halibut, eggs, and chicken. Hence, we 
have a good representation of the different kinds of food 
stuffs, so that without calculation we can safely say that 
the ash constituents are properly supplied, and the diet- 
ary shows that protein and total fuel are fully adequate. 

Thus, by following a simple general plan, and using our 
knowledge of food values to help in arranging an attrac- 
tive menu, we can get a good family dietary without great 
difficulty, if we do not have to count cost too closely. 

Cost of the Family Dietary 

The dietary just planned will probably cost from 
$2,50 to $2.85 per day, or from one and three-fourths 
to two cents per 100 Calories, depending upon the local- 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 253 

ity, provided milk costs nine cents per quart and eggs 
about three cents apiece. With milk, at six or seven 
cents per quart and eggs not over two and one-half cents 
apiece, fruit and vegetables correspondingly cheap, it 
would be possible to purchase such food for one and one- 
half cents per 100 Calories, but hardly for less. It must 
be remembered that in these estimates nothing is allowed 
for kitchen or table waste, beyond the unavoidable losses 
in paring vegetables, discarding meat bones, etc. If 
the cook spoils food in the kitchen, or leaves it in the 
cooking utensils through careless heating or bad scrap- 
ing ; if she is not careful to save every bit of edible food 
which comes back from the dining room, the food bills 
will go up, even though the family has no more to eat. 
Scientifically speaking, bread crumbs have the same food 
value as freshly cut slices of bread, bits of meat on bones 
are as nutritious as handsome roasts, sour milk as valu- 
able as sweet. Every Calorie thrown away either de- 
prives the family of nutriment which it needs or adds 
to the total cost of its food supply. At the table there 
is often much carelessness about leaving food on indi- 
vidual plates, breaking bread or rolls and eating only a 
small portion, and otherwise performing a kind of "dog 
in the manger" act, refusing to eat and spoiling the food 
for others. Careful supervision of the serving will help 
to prevent this, and children should be early trained 
to a sense of responsibility about the waste of food. In 
public places, where strangers are fed, it is not possible 
to gauge accurately their probable consumption and 
serve accordingly ; consequently the table wa^te is often 



254 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

great, but at the home table, where individual require- 
ments can easily be studied, there is little excuse for 
table waste. 

A food budget of $2.50 per day means $900 a year 
for this item of family expenditure alone. To justify 
such an outlay, an income of at least three times this 
amount would be required, if the family is to have cloth- 
ing and shelter at all commensurate in quality with the 
food, and opportunity to satisfy its "higher" or intel- 
lectual and spiritual needs, such as education for the 
children, books, travel, jnusic, entertainments, gifts to 
church and charity, and other good things which require 
money.^ 

Reducing the Cost of the Dietary 

The majority of families do not have incomes of 
$3000 or more a year ; most housewives must spend less 
than one and three-fourths to two cents per 100 Calories 
on their food in order to ha^^e money for decent clothing 
and shelter and any "higher Ufe" at all. Yet these fami- 
lies have need of being well nourished and wish to enjoy 
some of the esthetic pleasure of a well-set table. Sup- 
pose, for instance, that we wish to reduce the cost of the 
foregoing dietary to between one and one-fourth and 
one and one-half cents per 100 Calories, making a 
total cost of from $1.75 to $2.10 per day. In our first 

1 It is usually estimated that, with an income of $2000 to $4000, 25 
per cent will be spent for food, but the family under consideration here is 
larger than that taken as " typical," the latter including only five persons 
— two adults and three children under fourteen years of age. A more 
liberal proportion for food would be Justifiable in the present case. 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 255 

dietary we have used a liberal supply of fresh fruit 
and vegetables, and as these are expensive items when 
considered as sources of fuel, we may cut down the 
amount somewhat, using only one kind of fresh fruit 
and one fresh vegetable in a single day, or we may 
substitute canned or dried fruit for the fresh. While 
the milk seems to occupy a large place, its value and 
economy has already been demonstrated, and as long 
as the average cost of the dietary is over one cent per 
100 Calories it can be used freely to advantage. Eggs 
are usually expensive, and can be omitted for breakfast, 
in the sauce for the fish, and the dessert, and cookies 
substituted for the lady fingers. Chicken is an expen- 
sive form of meat and, while not much is used, the cost 
could be lowered by substituting dried beef, without 
changing the form of the menu. The fish used in the 
dinner is usually not very dear and may be retained. 
The consomme adds Uttle food value and, unless made 
of material not valuable for other purposes, can be 
omitted. Keeping in mind the essentials first laid out 
for this dietary (see page 243) and these possible changes, 
we may plan a second menu at lower cost/ an illustration 
of which is given below.

will be helpful in this connection. See pp. 426-429.

The above dietary calculation makes it evident that 
the changes in the menu have not materially affected 
the fuel value of the diet ; all the items listed as essential 
to the family welfare (see page 243) have been included, 
so that a sufficient supply of ash constituents is assured, 
and the calculations also show that there has been no 
decrease in the amount of protein, though it is high 
enough that some reduction would not have been objec- 
tionable. The reason it remains high in spite of the 
fact that seven eggs used in the first dietary have been 
left out of the second — thus decreasing the cost con- 
siderably — is that a quart more milk has been used 



26o FEEDING THE FAMILY 

and the creamed dried beef yields more protein than the 
creamed chicken, so that the final result is quite as satis- 
factory as if the seven eggs had been used. The changes 
suggested in the fruit and vegetables may not always 
mean much saving ; all depends upon season and locahty 
and general market conditions. But cabbage is usually 
one of the cheapest vegetables, while fresh tomatoes are 
often rather dear; fine, large oranges are always more 
expensive than medium-sized ones, and the reduction in 
the number of fruits used in the dietary, by the omis- 
sion of the apples, is also in the nature of an economy, 
since fruits are always a relatively expensive source of 
energy. The chocolate blancmange served with top 
milk gives nearly twice the fuel value of the apple snow 
and boiled custard, but costs less than one cent per loo 
Calories, while the other dessert will cost about one and 
one-half cents per loo Calories. If these modifications 
of the first menu do not mean the most effective cost 
reduction under all circumstances, they will at least 
show how one may go about the reduction of the cost of 
food, once a general working plan has been thought out. 
Dietaries costing one and one-half to two cents per 
lOO Calories are comparatively easy to plan ; milk may 
be used freely, and a variety of fruits and vegetables 
can be obtained, fresh or canned, with dried ones occa- 
sionally for variety. Meats of choice cuts can be pro- 
vided in moderation, the more expensive kinds being 
offset by the introduction of a meat substitute or some 
specially cheap cut now and then. Dietaries costing 
from one to one and one-half cents per loo Calories 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 261 

must be given more thought in order to keep them well 
balanced. Milk becomes a more important item, tak- 
ing the place, to some extent, of other protein and ash- 
bearing foods, especially expensive meats and fresh 
fruits and vegetables. Eggs must be used very little, 
except for the young children, and butter confined chiefly 
to table use and those dishes in which its flavor really 
counts. In others, cheaper forms of fat may be sub- 
stituted. 

Dietaries Costing One Cent per 100 Calories or Less 

If now we wish to reduce the cost of food to one cent 
or less per 100 Calories, distinct emphasis will have to 
be placed on the non-perishable, staple foods, such as 
cereals and dried fruits and vegetables, which in the 
main cost from one-third of a cent to one cent per 100 
Calories, and very sparing use will have to be made of 
meats and fresh or canned fruits and vegetables. In 
the family group under consideration, the children re- 
quire over half the total fuel proposed as a standard. 
Their food, as already pointed out in the chapters 
especially devoted to their requirements, cannot be 
provided as cheaply as that for healthy adults, because 
of their greater need of the relatively expensive building 
materials — protein and ash. When the cost of food is 
as high as it is in New York City, it is difficult to provide 
an ideal dietary for children for less than one cent per 
ICO Calories. Milk at eight or nine cents per quart 
can no longer be used freely, but with care one quart a 
day per child can be provided as long as the average 



262 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

cost of the dietary is not under three-quarters of a cent 
per ICO Calories. Sometimes economy can be efifected 
by buying two grades of milk, the better reserved for the 
little children and for table use, the less expensive used 
in cookery. Condensed milk may also be used in cookery 
or for the adults, and this is usually cheaper than fresh 
milk at nine cents a quart. When the dietary costs less 
than three-quarters of a cent per loo Calories, a quart 
of milk per day can be furnished only to the children 
under seven or eight years of age, and not more than a 
pint for each of the others. Cheap substitutes for the 
rest of the milk are soups made from dried beans, peas, 
lentils, or peanut butter for young children, and these 
legumes cooked in other ways for older children and 
adults. Cereals from whole grains can also be used to 
advantage to supplement the milk. The purchase of 
butter is seldom wise when the dietary is to cost less 
than one cent per loo Calories. Oleomargarine is equally 
valuable as fuel, and when fresh is sweet and clean and 
good — much better than inferior butter, which lacks 
the fine texture and flavor which we pay for in high- 
priced butter. Still cheaper fats than oleomargarine 
can be used in cookery, such as the lard substitutes 
made from cottonseed oil, suet, carefully tried out beef 
fat, and salt fat pork. Cottonseed oil is equal in fuel 
to oHve oil and costs much less. 

Dried fruits and vegetables must be very largely sub- 
stituted for fresh. Bananas are usually cheap, and at 
certain seasons so are apples and oranges. Other fresh 
fruits must be purchased with care and only when their 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 263 

cost is at its very lowest. Bananas may be regarded 
as a staple fresh fruit, high in fuel value, low in price, 
and easy to prepare. They are often cheapest when 
at their best, i.e., when the skins have darkened and the 
fruit is soft, though still firm. Digestive difiiculties 
usually arise from eating them too green or too fast. 
As they ripen, considerable starch is changed to sugar, 
so they have a higher flavor as well as greater digesti- 
bility when fully ripened. Baking the ripe banana in 
the skin, if properly done, produces a more succulent 
food of fine flavor. They must be quickly baked till 
soft and the juice begins to flow, but no longer, or the 
juice all oozes out and they become tough and dark and 
lose much of their flavor. Bananas baked before the 
skins darken will never be as palatable as the fully 
ripened ones, though they are more digestible than if 
eaten raw. Unripe bananas are best baked without the 
skins and basted with a syrup. These may be used as a 
dessert, while those baked in the skins may take the 
place of a vegetable in the menu. Bananas can be 
mashed and stewed with a httle water, flavored with 
lemon juice and sugar, making a palatable sauce. The 
many and varied uses of apples are too well known to 
require comment. It is upon the dried fruits, however, 
that emphasis is to be placed in economical dietaries. 
Dates, raisins, prunes, peaches, figs, apricots, and 
apples may usually be obtained for less than one and 
one-half cents per 100 Calories (dates for less than one 
cent), and their uses are many and varied. Dates, figs, 
raisins, and apples will make bread crumbs or flour and 



264 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

cheap fat acceptable in the form of steamed puddings or 
plain cake. Raisins make a good sauce when stewed 
tender in a little water; their own store of sugar will 
make it sufficiently sweet. These stewed raisins may 
be used over rice or cornstarch blancmange as a change 
from milk. Dates may also be cooked soft in a little 
water, then put through a coarse sieve, making a palat- 
able marmalade without added sugar. The addition of 
a little sugar and lemon juice will make a richer sauce, 
however. Dates make an excellent filling for sand- 
wiches ; or chopped dates, figs, and raisins may be com- 
bined. Dates may be served with breakfast cereals, 
being especially good with wheat preparations. Raisin 
or date bread will be appreciated by children. The 
fruit, cut in small pieces, is added to the dough when 
kneading for the pan. 

Stewed figs, served in their own juice or with milk or 
cream, make a pleasing dessert. Prunes are often badly 
cooked and not as highly esteemed as they might be. 
Long, slow cooking in plenty of water to cover them well 
is necessary to make them soft and juicy, no sugar being 
added during the process. When done, they should be 
moderately sweetened and allowed to stand at least 
twenty-four hours before serving. They will then be 
plump and well seasoned to the center. Prunes of the 
cheapest grades are often Kttle but skin and stone, and 
even careful cooking will not make them attractive. 
Hence it pays to buy prunes of good quality. The addi- 
tion of a few slices of lemon while cooking gives a pleasant 
change of flavor. Prunes keep well, and there are many 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 265 

uses for them. Prune whip or prune souffle, made of 
sifted prune pulp and whites of eggs, is an attractive and 
wholesome dessert. The juice may be stiffened with 
gelatin and served as prune jelly. Prunes and brown 
bread may be baked with milk and eggs like a plain 
bread pudding. A prune pie may be made with two 
crusts and a filling of prune pulp thickened with a little 
cornstarch. Variety can be given to the menu by com- 
binations of the more inexpensive fruits. Dried peaches 
stewed with raisins, prunes stewed with apricots, dates 
baked with dried apples in a pie, are all attractive 
combinations. 

Besides the dried legumes (peas, beans, lentils), the 
cheapest vegetables are usually potatoes, cabbage, onions, 
carrots, turnips, and parsnips. Wliile tomatoes are 
expensive as fuel, they have almost as great value for 
flavor as onions. Man demands a diet of pronounced 
and varied flavor; bread, cereals, beans, potatoes, and 
the like are too bland to be wholly satisfjdng. The 
secret of making an acceptable dietary at a low cost is 
to develop the characteristic flavor of the mild foods 
as far as possible (usually by long, slow cooking) and 
to include in the day's ration some of the highly flavored 
foods. Tea and coffee are most useful for flavor, but 
they lack the ash constituents and fuel value which 
the fruits and vegetables also contribute, and hence 
should not be exclusively depended upon. Too often 
children as well as adults make a breakfast of nothing 
but bread and coffee. Cereal and milk would be much 
more wholesome and "staying." 



266 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Meat is too expensive a source of protein to be de- 
pended upon for this foodstuff. It is to be regarded 
rather as a source of flavor and of fat. A little salt pork, 
bacon or ham will cause a large dish of baked beans 
to be relished ; creamed salt fish or dried beef will make 
bread (toast) or potatoes more acceptable ; a small p>or- 
tion of beef or mutton will give character to a stew of 
vegetables and dumplings, or to the pastry and gravy 
which yield most of the fuel in a meat pie. 

Aside from milk, the best sources of protein will be 
the legumes, including peanuts, especially in the form 
of peanut butter, and the less expensive kinds of cheese, 
including cottage cheese. Besides the ordinary baked 
beans and bean soup, many attractive dishes can be 
made from the sifted pulp of well-cooked beans of differ- 
ent kinds. It may be molded around a center of sea- 
soned bread crumbs and baked in a loaf to be served with 
a brown or tomato sauce ; or, again, a casserole may 
be lined with bean pulp, the center filled with corned 
beef hash, a cover of pulp laid over it, and the dish 
baked and served with a sauce. Lentils cooked and 
ground in a food chopper may be made into an excellent 
loaf with chopped peanuts or chopped beef. 

Cheese is valuable for its flavor as well as its food 
value. The United States Department of Agriculture 
has published a bulletin giving many recipes for this 
useful and economical food.^ It will give flavor to such 
bland foods as rice, macaroni, bread, and hominy in a 
variety of ways, not fully appreciated by many house- 

* Cheese and Us economical uses in the diet. Farmers' Bulletin, 487. 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 267 

wives. It can be successfully combined with lentils, 
nuts, potatoes, or tomatoes, adding to their food value 
and giving an agreeable change from the ordinary ways 
of preparing these foods. 

Family Dietaries at the Lowest Cost 

If we try to plan a dietary for our family requiring 
about 14,000 Calories at a cost of less than one cent per 
100 Calories, we shall find that we cannot afford much 
more than five quarts of milk if we have to pay seven or 
more cents per quart for it ; this will give a quart apiece 
for each of the three younger children, a pint apiece for 
each of the older ones, and a pint for the adults. By 
using butter less freely than in the other dietaries, we 
may be able to provide it here, but to reduce the cost 
to three-quarters of a cent per 100 Calories it will be 
necessary to pay no more than 24 cents per pound — 
the usual city cost of oleomargarine, which may be sub- 
stituted for all the butter. To compensate for the re- 
duction in the amount of butter, some increase in the 
amount of bread, breakfast cereal, and sugar has been 
made. Prune pulp has been substituted for orange 
juice for breakfast for the little children, and bananas 
for oranges for the rest. Cereal coffee to which an equal 
volume of hot milk is added will give the older children 
a wholesome beverage and a cup of this may be more 
satisfying, though not more nutritious, than a half cup 
of milk would be. Eggs cannot be used every day, 
even for the young children, when the cost of the dietary 
must be less than one cent per 100 Calories, Therefore

a rice pudding without eggs has been chosen and cookies 
with very high fuel value in proportion to the number of 
eggs used. Oatmeal cookies fulfil this condition, though 
oatmeal wafers would be still cheaper, since they can be 
made without any eggs at all. 

A meat substitute for luncheon — macaroni and 
cheese — instead of creamed dried beef, and the use 
of salt fish for dinner instead of fresh will effect further 
economy. A rearrangement of Menu II, following 
these ideas, is given below :

Worked out in detail for the family, as shown in the die- 
tary below, this menu fulfills the requirements quite as 
well as either of the more expensive ones. Some changes 
in the little children's meals will be noted, as well as those 
for the older children and adults, such as the substitution 
of prune pulp for breakfast, the use of some of the macaroni 
without the cheese for the three-year-old's dinner, split pea 
instead of green pea puree, and apple sauce for apricots.

Requirement of family 



The protein in the first two exceeds all demands of 
necessity, but not far enough to make it objectionable 
unless it be from the point of expense. In the third, 
reduction in the amount of milk and eggs brings the 
protein within desirable limits, and, since it it derived 
quite largely from milk, especially for the children, there 
can be no question of its being ample for all body needs. 
In fact, it is evident that in this last dietary we have 
not reached the lowest cost at which it is possible to 
maintain our family, though we have reached the lowest 
point at which it can be done easily with prices as high 
as those of New York City. In any further reduction 
especial care will have to be taken to keep the protein 
and ash constituents adequate, as these are expensive 
items in any dietary. It becomes increasingly difficult 
to provide variety of diet. Cereal products, dried beans 
and peas, a few staple fresh vegetables, such as potatoes, 
onions, cabbage, and tomatoes in limited quantities, 
dried fruits, and one or two fresh ones, as apples and 
bananas, very fat meats, such as fat beef plate and fat 
salt pork, and a limited amount of milk must be the 
chief reliance of the housewife. The temptation is 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 273 

often great to use large quantities of sugar and syrup 
or molasses rather than cereals, because of the high 
flavor and the fact that these require no cooking. But 
the ash constituents of the grains and legumes assume 
greater importance when fruits, vegetables, and milk 
must be limited, and it is worth while to try to make 
acceptable as much oatmeal, barley, buckwheat, whole 
wheat preparations, beans, peas, and the Uke as one 
possibly can, these being also good sources of protein. 
The needs of the children cannot be ideally met when the 
dietary falls to two-thirds of a cent per 100 Calories, ex- 
cept in districts where milk and fruit and vegetables are 
very cheap. With a limited number of foods to choose 
from, the day's menu will be very simple, variety being 
obtained by changes from day to day rather than by a 
number of different dishes in one meal. The following 
menu and dietary illustrate what can be done for about 
two-thirds of a cent per 100 Calories, allowing one quart 
of milk for each of the two youngest children, a pint 
for each of the others and one pint for the adults — 
four quarts in all.

FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 277 

Dried apples have been substituted for fresh fruit for 
breakfast, and stewed raisins for stewed apricots, corn- 
meal for farina, samp for macaroni, oleomargarine for 
butter, oatmeal wafers without eggs for oatmeal cookies, 
date pudding with brown sugar sauce for rice pudding with 
milk and sugar. Thus the cost has been reduced without 
any material change in the amount of fuel or of the ash 
constituents. Beef has been substituted for fish for din- 
ner because it has more fat and also gives more flavor. 

The children whose supply of milk has been limited 
have been given warm beverages (cereal coffee and 
cocoa) to make their small allowance of milk more 
attractive. The sugar and cocoa also contribute to 
the total fuel value of their dietary. Other modifi- 
cations or additions to the menu are indicated in the 
dietary. The sausage put in for breakfast for the father 
and the mother adds to the flavor of that meal, making the 
commeal mush and bread more acceptable ; the fat is a 
cheaper source of fuel than oleomargarine, and the protein 
makes up for some of that lost by cutting down the milk. 
Instead of using the fat on the bread, one might fry the 
commeal mush for the adults in it for a change, and serve 
this with syrup, leaving more milk for the children. 

Some changes in the children's meals have been made, 
either for economy, or to save extra cooking, or to supply 
a more digestible food than that provided in the meals 
for the older members of the family. Oatmeal is used 
instead of commeal for the three-year-old's breakfast, 
as better suited to his digestive powers. Prune pulp 
has been retained for the baby for the same reason. No 



278 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

change has been made in the morning lunches except a 
decrease in the amount of milk and an increase in the 
number of crackers for the six-year-old child. The egg 
has been omitted from the baby's two o'clock meal for 
the sake of economy. An egg yolk should be given a 
couple of times a week, even if it cannot be afforded 
every day. Baked potato and more oleomargarine 
take the place of the macaroni with egg for the three- 
year-old. This change decreases the amount of pro- 
tein, but with the full allowance of milk this is of no 
particular importance. The use of whole wheat bread 
to compensate for some of the iron lost by not using 
eggs for these two young children would be advisable. 

If the dietary must be kept under a cost of two-thirds 
of a cent per 100 Calories, not more than three quarts of 
milk can usually be allowed, and, if possible, one of 
these should be bought for six cents a quart, this milk 
to be cooked in all cases. The two quarts of good grade 
must be reserved for the two youngest children, and the 
other distributed as the menu demands. Some menus 
which will supply a balanced ration under these condi- 
tions are given below. 

Menus for Very Low-Priced Family Dietaries 
(allowing three quarts of milk per day) 

I. Breakfast:

Luncheon or Supper: 
Pork and beans — bean soup for young children

Hashed browned potatoes 

Bread 

Oleomargarine 

Tea for adults 

Milk for youngest children 

Dried apple and date pie with cheese, for father, mother, and 

oldest child 
Dried apple sauce for others 

The breakfast and morning lunches for the children 
will be practically the same in all these menus, follow- 
ing the plan in Dietary IV.^ The afternoon lunches 
will follow the family luncheon as closely as possible. 
In the menu above, part of the beans are put through 
a sieve and made into soup for the two o'clock dinner 
of the little ones. Baked potato and baked apple 
or stewed prunes may be used for the three-year-old, 
as in Dietary IV. ^ 

The half past five meal for the baby will not change 
with changes in the menu for the rest of the group. 
Other suggestions for the three-year-old will be found in 
the chapter on feeding young children (pages 128-134). 

^ Pjyje 274. 2 Page 275. 



28o FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Lentil soup with bread may here take the place of cream 
toast, and cornmeal mush, if cooked all day, may be 
substituted for the rice pudding. Little change can be 
made in the night lunches. 

Since the meals for the two youngest and the supper 
for the six-year-old cannot follow the regular family 
menu, and are very simple, no attempt has been made 
to describe them in detail, but suggestive notes with 
each menu will indicate ways of adapting these to the 
children, thus saving extra labor. 

II. Breakfast: 

Hominy with milk and sugar 

^ , . , , , . . i f or adults and oldest child 



Baking powder biscuit

Cofifee for adults 

Apple sauce, prune pulp, or orange juice for two youngest 

Luncheon or Supper:

Dinner:

FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 281 

This menu can be quite easily adapted to the chil- 
dren's needs. Their breakfasts will be like those in 
Dietary IV,^ except that hominy may be substituted 
for oatmeal if hominy grits be used. Vegetable soup 
put through a sieve will serve for the two o'clock 
dinner of the three-year-old, and bread and peanut 
butter take the place of the baked potato ; stewed dried 
peaches that of the baked apple. The family evening 
meal is not suited to the requirements of the young 
children. For their half past five supper, some such 
plan as outlined in Dietary IV ^ had best be followed. 

III. Breakfast: 

Farina with milk and sugar 

Graham gems baked in a thin sheet 

Brown sugar syrup 

Cereal coflfee for all but two yoimgest children 

Milk for two youngest children 

Luncheon or Supper: 
SpUt pea soup 
Bread 

Oleomargarine 
SUced bananas with sugar 
Gingerbread 

Dinner: 

Lentil-meat loaf 
Tomato sauce 
Mashed potatoes 
Scalloped dried apples 
Cocoa for children 
Tea for adults 

* Page 274. * Page 276. 



282 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Baking the gems in a thin sheet will make them suit- 
able for all but the two youngest children. The syrup 
should be given very sparingly, if at all, to the children. 
The split pea soup can be used for the three-year-old's 
dinner and the six-year-old's supper. Gingerbread and 
scalloped apples may also be served for the latter's 
supper. 

IV. Breakfast:

Dinner:

Oleomargarine 

Dried peach pudding 

Part of the baked beans can be put through a 
sieve and made into soup for the three-year-old's din- 
ner and the six-year-old's supper. Junket can easily 
be made for dessert for the children's half past five 
supper. 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 283 

V. Breakfast: 

Flaked wheat with milk and sugar 
Buckwheat cakes with corn syrup 
Coffee for adults

Dinner:

Potato soup may be made for the three-year-old *s 
luncheon, and the six-year-old's supper. For the latter, 
thoroughly toasted coffee bread will also be acceptable. 
All except the baby may have the apricot tapioca, but 
it should be served with milk instead of sauce for the 
three- and six-year-old children. 

VI. Breakfast: 

Oatmeal mush with milk and sugar 
Combread baked in a thin sheet 
Oleomargarine 
Coffee for adults 
Cereal coffee for children 



284 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Luncheon or Supper : 

Corn chowder with croutons 
Rye bread and oleomargarine 
Stewed prunes 
Tea for adults 

Dinner: 

Baked split peas with bacon 
Cabbage and potato salad 
Molasses cake 
Cocoa 

Some of the corn chowder can be put through a sieve 
and some of the baked split peas made into a puree 
for the three-year-old's dinner and supper. Rice molded 
and served with prunes would make a good dessert for 
the young children. 



CHAPTER XV 

FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 

A DISCUSSION of the problems of feeding a family 
would be incomplete without some reference to the care 
of the sick and convalescent. Few famihes are so for- 
timate as to escape illness entirely. Good feeding is 
one of the greatest factors in maintaining health, but it 
must be supported by other conditions fostering nutri- 
tion, such as sanitary and cheerful surroundings, free- 
dom from chill, exhaustion, overwork, or worry. A well- 
fed person is much better able to resist the attacks of 
harmful bacteria than an undernourished one, but if 
their number is very great on account of impure water 
or food, they may overwhelm his strong defenses. Thus 
the best care to set a well-balanced table may fail to 
maintain health if the housewife works without the help 
of the community in securing a sanitary environment. 
Personal infringements on the laws of health, other 
than those in regard to food, undermine the resistance 
of the body to disease ; fatigue, and chill, often, for in- 
stance, pave the way to colds and indigestion, which 
in their turn lower resistance still more. Then a stray 
germ which would be promptly destroyed if the person 
were in vigorous health, may find a favorable soil in 

285 



286 FEEDING THE Fx\MILY 

which to flourish. So, in one way and another, illness 
may enter the home where food is dispensed with intelli- 
gent care, and special adaptations of the diet to the 
needs of the patient have to be considered. 

When the case is serious enough to demand the care 
of a physician, he will give advice concerning the diet, 
and his directions should be implicitly obeyed. It 
requires knowledge and experience to diagnose disease 
and prescribe suitable food, and no book can take the 
place of the skillful doctor. In sickness, even more 
than in health, every person is a law unto himself and 
all rules must be modified according to the requirements 
of the individual. This can be done successfully only 
by one who is able to judge accurately the patient's true 
condition. 

The physician's advice is, however, often very general, 
especially where the diet is not a prominent factor in 
the treatment, and the home nurse is frequently at a loss 
to know how to carry out his instructions to the best 
advantage. She must obey the doctor, please the patient 
and not over-strain the family pocket book, and some- 
times the three seem quite irreconcilable. Moreover, 
many minor disturbances for which no physician is called 
require some modification of the ordinary family diet. 
The better the general principles of feeding are understood, 
the more successfully such emergencies can be met, 
especially if this knowledge is supplemented by some 
acquaintance with the lines of dietetic treatment which 
have proven most successful in practice. 

At the outset one must free one's mind from any 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 287 

notion that any particular food is a specific for any dis- 
ease. As has aheady been pointed out, there are in 
health many choices of food, whether for fuel, building, 
or regulating materials. So in sickness, though the 
range of choice may be more limited, some flexibility is 
usually possible. There is no magic diet for any dis- 
ease. Even in the well-known case of diabetes, where 
the power to utilize carbohydrates is reduced to a low 
plane or lost, the avoidance of certain articles of food, 
while it may be important, is by no means the only 
feature of the diet. The aim of this chapter is to point 
out a few dietetic procedures which conform to the 
general principles involved and which have been shown 
by experience to be "safe and sane." For more detailed 
suggestions and other modes of treatment, the reader 
must consult the specialist in nutrition or refer to the 
writings of experts in the treatment of any particular 
disease.^ 

Energy Requirements in Sickness 

In sickness, as in health, the internal work of the 
body goes on at the rate of about two-fifths of a Calorie 
per pound per hour during sleep and about three-fifths of 
a Calorie per pound per hour during waking hours spent 
in bed. Seldom is the expenditure of energy less in sick- 
ness than under the same conditions of activity in health, 
and it may be more, particularly in cases of fever. In the 
first few days of illness, fasting or taking of very little 

* Much practical information about feeding in disease is to be found 
in Diet in Health and Disease by Friedenwald and RuhrSh. 



288 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

food does no harm and has the advantage of giving the 
digestive tract a chance to rest. But the energy for 
body work must still be supplied, so it is drawn from the 
reserves of the body itself at the rate of about one-half 
a Calorie per pound per hour for the 24-hour day, if the 
patient is lying quietly in bed ; in other words, a man 
of average weight, confined to his bed, will need about 
1850 Calories per day. How long it will be wise to 
depend upon the body to furnish its own fuel wholly or 
in part depends upon circumstances. In disturbances 
of short duration, such as attacks of acute indigestion, 
it is quite safe to fast one to three days, or until the cause 
of disturbance is removed. Nature will quickly bring 
the digestive tract back to normal, so that in a few 
days a simple diet ample for all body needs can safely 
be taken. But in disease which is likely to run a 
long course and draw severely upon body tissues, food 
for fuel must be suppHed as nearly as possible in accord- 
ance with energy expenditure, to save the patient from 
being very much weakened and having to undergo a 
long period of convalescence to regain what he has lost. 

Fluid Diet 

When for any reason the person is below par phys- 
ically, care must be taken to provide a diet easy of 
digestion. Some of the ways in which this may be done 
have already been considered in Chapter II. Since all 
food must eventually be reduced to fluid form for ab- 
sorption, a Uquid diet is usually regarded as the type 
easiest to digest, and is often prescribed by the physician. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 289 

By this he means a diet which includes : (i) broths and 
clear soups of various kinds; (2) beef juice and tea; 
(3) cereal gruels ; (4) milk, either plain or modified in 
such a way as to make it more digestible, more nutri- 
tious, or more attractive to the patient ; (5) raw eggs in 
combination with water, milk, fruit juices, cocoa, or 
other fluid ; (6) cream soups of various kinds. 

Broths and clear soups and beef tea have little or no 
fuel value, from a pint to a quart being required to yield 
100 Calories. Their chief virtues are that they are 
agreeable to taste, comforting when hot or refreshing 
when cold, and when they contain meat extracts (as 
they usually do) stimulating to the flow of the gastric 
juice. Broths can be made the carriers of extra nutri- 
ment by the addition of eggs, by thickening with cereal 
flours, such as barley or rice flour, or by combination 
with ordinary cereal gruels. 

Beef juice, made by pressing the juice from slightly 
warmed beef or from finely chopped beef which with a 
little added water has been kept at a temperature of 150° 
F. for two hours (to draw out the juice) has a fuel value 
of about 100 Calories per pint. It is an expensive fuel, 
since a pound of lean meat yields only about four ounces 
(§ cup) of juice, or about 25 Calories. It ranks with 
eggs and milk as an easily digested protein food, but it 
is not as attractive in flavor as beef broth or beef tea, 
and is served only in small quantities. 

Cereal gruels are useful in many cases in which the 
appetite is poor or the digestive and assimilative powers 
very weak. They are neither stimulating nor irritating 



290 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

and are rapidly digested and absorbed. When made 
from cereal flours, one ounce (4 level tablespoonfuls) to 
the quart, they have a fuel value of from 70 to 90 Calories 
per quart. They may be made as thick as two ounces 
to the quart, doubling their fuel value (140 to 180 Calories 
per quart). If the cereal gruel is dextrinized,^ thus 
rendering it more fluid, as high as six ounces may be 
used per quart, the fuel value then ranging between 400 
and 600 Calories per quart, according to the kind of 
cereal flour used. It is evident that a man could not 
drink enough thin cereal gruel to furnish a day's quota 
of energy, and of a thick gruel dextrinized he would 
have to drink three or four quarts. The virtue Hes in 
allaying hunger and thirst and furnishing a Httle bland, 
easily digested food. Like broths, gruels may be en- 
riched by the addition of eggs, cream, or milk. 

Milk is one of the most valuable foods for the sick- 
room. It is for most people easy of digestion in its 
natural state, if taken slowly, and can be made still 
more digestible in various ways. As already pointed out 
many times, it contains all kinds of material required 
by the body, and may be considered as *'a diet" in itseK. 
Its usefulness can often be increased (i) by changing 
its flavor, which is not always agreeable, especially to 
adults, (2) by altering the relative proportions of protein, 
fat, and carbohydrate, or (3) by combining it with some- 



^ Cereal gruels are dextrinized by adding to the cooked gruel, when 
cooled to about 100° F., a small amount of a commercial preparation of 
malt diastase. This causes the thick gruel to liquefy rapidly by changing 
the starch into dextrins and malt sugar. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 291 

thing which prevents the formation of large or hard 
curds in the stomach. The general principles of milk 
modification have already been discussed in Chapter V. 
They are applicable in all cases where digestion and 
assimilation are concerned, as well as in the feeding of 
infants. Just how milk shall be prepared depends upon 
the individual to be fed. "Some like it hot, some like 
it cold," and a few like it warm from the cow. Those 
who find its sweetness unpleasant often enjoy the mild 
acid flavor of buttermilk and zoolak or the faint tang 
of fermented milk (kumiss). Coffee, tea, or cocoa 
may be added for their flavor; malted milk not only 
changes the taste but adds to the fuel value and ease 
of digestion. With malted milk a number of different 
flavors are possible. For example, it may be served 
hot, slightly salted, or cold with a little fruit juice and 
sugar. Cereal gruels are added to milk chiefly to make 
it easier to digest. Raw eggs add to its food value and 
the eggnog may be flavored in a variety of ways — with 
vanilla, nutmeg, coffee, beef broth, or pineapple juice. 
Since whole milk has a fuel value of about 675 Calories 
per quart, it follows that three quarts of milk will cover 
the energy requirement of the average man in bed, 
unless his disease is one demanding an extraordinary 
amount of fuel. Two and one-half quarts of milk plus 
two eggs will yield the same amount of energy in a little 
less bulky form. By the addition of some cream the 
volume may be reduced still further with ease. 

What arc known as "albuminized" beverages are in 
reality combinations of white of egg (a kind of protein 



292 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

called albumin) with various fluids, such as milk, broth, 
orange, lemon, pineapple, or grape juice, or even water 
alone to make a soothing drink of some nutritive value, 
to be taken when the irritability of the digestive tract is 
particularly great. The white of one egg has an aver- 
age fuel value of 13 or 14 Calories. One white com- 
bined with half a cup of milk results in a drink yielding 
nearly 100 Calories. One white plus the juice of one 
medium sized orange and a teaspoonful of sugar will 
supply from 55 to 60 Calories.^ 

More nourishment is gained, of course, by introduc- 
ing the yolk as well as the white of the egg. An eggnog 
made with one egg, three-fourths of a cup of milk, 
three-fourths of a tablespoonful of sugar, and one table- 
spoonful of brandy will yield about 230 Calories ; others 
will yield from 125 to 200 Calories. All of these present 
the egg in agreeable fluid forms which can be adapted to 
the palate of the most fastidious. Indeed, the chief 
reliance for nourishment in fluid diet, it will be perceived, 
is upon milk and eggs. Even cream soups generally 
owe their food value largely to milk and are to be re- 
garded as among the devices for making milk acceptable. 
Several illustrations of the nutritive value of cream 
soups will be found among the Dietary Recipes of Table 
III, in the Appendix. 

If a fluid diet is to be maintained but for a short 
time (a few days), no attempt is usually made to meet 
the full energy requirement of the patient. The diet 

^ Recipes for various foods for invalids with their fuel value stated may 
be found in Pattee's Practical Dietetics. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 293 

reKeves sensations of hunger and thirst, and the dilute 
food has a better chance of digestion than more concen- 
trated would have, for, when one is not taking any 
exercise, body processes are apt to be sluggish. The 
fluid diet should be administered in small amounts at 
frequent intervals. A Hquid meal leaves the stomach 
quickly and enters the circulation quickly. If meals are 
too far apart, less food is given than the patient can 
advantageously take. If too large amounts are given 
at once, too much work is thrust upon the enfeebled 
system. An illustration of a typical fluid diet, showing 
amounts and time of meals, is given below. It will 
yield from 800 to 900 Calories. 

A Typical Menu for a Fluid Diet

When a fluid diet is to be given over a considerable 
period of time, running into weeks, more attention must 
be paid to its fuel value. To keep the food dilute and 
administer over 1000 Calories per day, meals may have 
to occur every two hours throughout the twenty-four.

Soft or Semi-Solid Diet 

The so-called soft or semi-solid diet represents an 
intermediate step between fluid diet and a very simple, 
wholesome, mixed diet, the latter often designated 
in hospitals as light or convalescent diet. Soft diet is 
generally more acceptable to the patient than a wholly 
fluid diet, and has the advantage of less bulk in propor- 
tion to fuel value. The foods most commonly included 
are any of the fluid foods mentioned in the preceding 
section and, in addition, a considerable variety of simple 
dishes, such as toast softened with water, milk, or broth ; 
custards, baked, steamed or "boiled"; whips, souffles, 

^ See page 305.

junkets, blancmange, gelatin jellies, ice creams, ices, 
and sherbets. Meats, fish, and green vegetables are 
omitted. The following menu will give some idea of 
what foods are permissible. It will yield from 2000 to 
2200 Calories.

Light or Convalescent Diet 

The treatment of convalescence depends, of course, 
upon the nature of the disease. The severity and dura- 
tion of the attack, the strength of the patient, and the 
nature of the diet during the acute stage are all factors 
to take into account in directing the diet during recovery; 
and no rule will exactly fit every case. But we may 



296 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

assume that the digestive tract will participate in the 
weakness of the rest of the body, even when not itself 
the seat of disturbance, and regard special attention to 
the diet as essential to rapid and complete restoration 
to health. If a fluid diet has been given, it will be fol- 
lowed by a semi-fluid one, and this in turn by one more 
like the patient's ordinary diet, but free from any foods 
which might overtax the system. When no special 
directions are given, except to take a "light" diet, it is 
permissible to provide a fairly Hberal food supply, allow- 
ing some surplus over daily energy requirements to 
replenish depleted cells and restore lost weight, but see- 
ing to it that the extra amount is not so great as to upset 
digestion at any time. For adults an allowance of from 
2200 to 2500 Calories per day is usually sufficient, since 
convalescents are not indulging in active exercise. Aside 
from such regulations as the physician may prescribe, 
the main point is to limit the diet strictly to foods that 
are not likely to disturb digestion, and to see that build- 
ing materials are generously represented. Some of the 
ways of adapting food to digestive difficulties have been 
discussed in Chapter II, and many of the suggestions 
made in regard to selection of food for children (Chap- 
ters VI-IX) can be applied to the convalescent. It is 
well to keep in mind also the following points : 

1. The diet should be simple — only a few kinds of food at a 
time and those plainly but very carefuUy cooked and seasoned. 

2. Meals should be served with strict regularity ; a half hour of 
waiting may destroy aU desire for food. 

3. The appetite should be tempted by the appearance of the 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 297 

tray — attractive dishes neatly arranged, no food slopped over, 
hot dishes hot and cold dishes cold when they reach the patient, 
a pleasant surprise in the shape of a pretty garnish, a flower or a 
new dish. 

The following outline shows the type of food which should be 
chosen. 

General Plan for Convalescent Diet 

Breakfast : Coffee or tea with mUk and a little sugar 

Diluted fruit juice or cooked fruit, such as pears, 

prunes, apples 
A thoroughly cooked cereal (cooked 3 to 8 hours and 

strained if necessary) with thin cream and a little 

sugar 
A soft-cooked egg 
Dry toast — butter to spread it served separately 

Dinner: Meat broth or soup (rice, barley, potato, pea, as- 
paragus) 

Roast or broiled lean beef, chicken, mutton, lamb, 
or fish 

Potatoes baked, boiled, or mashed, or macaroni or 
rice 

Toast, stale bread, or plain crackers and butter 

A simple custard, ice cream, junket, cereal pudding, 
gelatin jelly, or mild stewed fruit 

Milk, to be flavored as desired 

Supper: Milk, served as soup, milk toast, or beverage, as 
preferred 
An omelet, souffle, or small chop 
Toast or stale bread and butter 
Stewed or baked fruit (prunes, apples, pears, bananas) 

If lunches are required between these meals, an eggnog, a glass 
of milk and a cracker, a cup of broth and a slice of toast, are safe 
to choose. 



298 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Diet in Minor Illness 

There are many times when diets of the types indi- 
cated above (fluid, semi-solid, and light or convalescent) 
may be profitably followed. On occasions of strain, 
nervous or otherwise, the digestive functions are likely 
to be depressed, and if given their usual amount of work 
to do may rebel and precipitate a fit of acute indiges- 
tion. If, however, the diet is made hghter for a few 
days, they will regain their normal state with no mishaps. 
A light meal is always in order when one is weary ; pass- 
ing quickly into the circulation, it helps to relieve the 
sense of fatigue. Nutritious soups are excellent for this 
purpose ; so are milk toast, bread, rice, or other cereals 
with milk, especially if the milk or the cereal is taken hot. 

Colds and influenza are often contracted because of 
weariness or exhaustion, and frequently accompanied by 
constipation. At first a light laxative diet of low fuel 
value is best — hot lemonade or orangeade, broths or 
gruels with crisp toast, baked potatoes, mild stewed 
fruits and vegetables being the chief articles of diet. 
This should be followed in a few days by one of full fuel 
value, and as soon as the cold seems to be "broken" by 
one of a little higher value than usual, to aid the body 
in complete recovery. For additional fuel at such times, 
fats such as butter, cream, bacon, olive and cod-liver 
oil, seem especially desirable, with liberal use of milk, 
eggs, and fruit. This " full feeding " should be continued 
until all traces of the cold are gone. It will do much to 
aid in quick recovery, and without it a cold may hang 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 299 

on a long time and even be the beginning of more serious 
troubles, such as chronic catarrh, bronchitis, pneu- 
monia, or even tuberculosis. 

Acute Indigestion 

During an attack of acute indigestion it is best to 
refrain from food, or to take only broth, tea, white of 
egg, or modified milk, for a day or two, until the irritated 
digestive tract has partially recovered, then to take a 
semi-solid diet, followed by a light diet, as outlined pre- 
viously^. Sugars, which are irritating to the lining 
of the stomach and likely also to ferment, should be 
avoided. Fruit and vegetables must be introduced 
again cautiously. Baked potatoes, baked apples, and 
prunes are safest to begin with. Bread should be 
oven-dried or toasted crisp. Eggs, lean roast or broiled 
meat and fish, oysters, buttermilk, butter, cream, and 
bacon are all desirable. Under-feeding for a few days is 
better than over-feeding in this case. Only small quanti- 
ties should be taken at one time. The following menu 
illustrates what may well be taken as soon as compara- 
tive comfort has been secured by rest and lighter feeding.

Intestinal Putrefaction 

The control of intestinal putrefaction depends largely 
upon the diet. As indicated in Chapter 11,^ protein 
food should be Umited and the kind carefully considered. 
Meat proteins are very readily attacked by putrefactive 
bacteria and should be avoided. Milk protein is most 
satisfactory, and one may choose not only the various 
beverages, but also cottage and other cheeses as meat 
substitutes. Vegetable proteins may also be used, as 
those in cereals and bread, peas, and beans. Not more 
than two protein Calories per pound of body weight 
should be taken per day by an adult. A Hberal use of 
green vegetables and fruits not only helps to carry off 
putrefactive products from the intestine, so that they 
will not be absorbed to circulate in the body and do 
harm, but these foods by their tendency to ferment a 
Httle actually hinder the action of the putrefactive bac- 
teria. Constipation is very Ukely to be associated with 

^ See page 39. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 301 

putrefaction, and most of the measures used to combat 
it ^ may be tried when it is associated with putrefaction. 
Persistence is essential to success in the treatment of 
intestinal disturbances. One needs the patience of Job 
and grim determination not to backslide. The follow- 
ing suggestions may be helpful in planning a diet.

Food in Fevers 

In the early stages of fever, digestion is often much 
disturbed — sometimes to such a degree that no food 

^ See page 42. 



302 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

at all can be retained. No food should be given which 
cannot be readily digested and absorbed, for undigested 
food will do more harm than good. A liberal supply of 
Uquid is important to relieve thirst and help in eHmina- 
tion of waste products, but when the digestive tract is 
very irritable even fluids will have to be given in small 
quantities at a time, though at frequent intervals. For 
a few days after the first onset of fever, the beverages, 
aside from water, may be only slightly nutritive, being 
confined principally to cereal waters (very thin gruels), 
diluted fruit juices (lemonade, orangeade, etc.), whey, and 
broth. 

But the energy output in fever is higher than when 
the body is free from fever. The raised temperature 
may increase the energy expenditure as much as one- 
tourth. Thus a bedridden man with fever, instead of 
requiring from 1800 to 2200 Calories per day, will need 
from 22CX) to 2800 to keep from burning up his body 
tissues for fuel — or about the same amount as he 
would require if doing moderate muscular work in health. 
In some diseases characterized by fever even this extra 
allowance is not enough to maintain the patient's body 
weight. In typhoid fever, for instance, the bacteria 
responsible for the disease cause a great wasting of body 
substance, which can be prevented only by feeding a 
diet of very much higher fuel value than the patient 
would need if he were simply lying in bed free from 
fever.^ 

The administration of food in fever calls for the exer-

FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 303 

cise of skill and good judgment in deciding how far the 
patient's energy needs can be met when the alimentary 
tract is very sensitive and indigestion may be worse 
tlian under-feeding, and in selecting the food which can 
be taken most successfully. A fluid diet is safest and 
easiest to give, as a rule. Meals may be served at inter- 
vals of one and one-half to two hours. Milk is an ideal 
fever food, if modified to suit the digestive state of the 
patient. Whole cow's milk is so high in protein that it 
will make a better balanced diet if something contain- 
ing httle or no protein is combined with it — cream or 
milk sugar or both, or some cereal gruel or proprietary 
infants' food prepared from cereal flours, malted or 
otherwise. The different devices for modifying milk for 
infants are apphcable here, but more attention should be 
paid to flavor for the adult, lest he tire of its monotony. 
The aftertaste of milk is disagreeable to many, especially 
when the mouth is parched with fever, and this can be 
avoided by carefully cleansing the mouth with water, plain 
or sUghtly acidified with lemon juice, immediately after 
each feeding. The outline of a fluid diet of high fuel 
value, on page 294, may be used in fever as soon as the 
digestive tract will tolerate it — usually in a few days. 

Diet in Typhoid Fever 

Typhoid fever furnishes a striking example of a dis- 
ease in which diet is one of the most important factors in 
treatment. The very life of the patient depends upon 
absolute obedience to physician and nurse in regard to 
every mouthful that the patient receives. A single 



304 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

indiscretion in diet may prove fatal, and no one but a 
person expert in reading the signs of the patient's con- 
dition (often entirely unperceived by the inexperienced 
and untrained person) should venture to prescribe the 
diet. Since, however, the home nurse has the respon- 
sibility of preparing the food ordered by the doctor, she 
will be able to cooperate more easily and cheerfully if 
she understands the general principles of the dietetic 
treatment of the disease, and it is only with the thought 
of giving her this background that the following sugges- 
tions are made. 

As in other cases of fever, there is an increase in the 
energy expended, due to the influence of the heightened 
temperature. There is an added expenditure due to 
the wasting of body substance brought about by the 
bacteria which cause the disease. These bacteria enter 
the system by way of the mouth, usually in contami- 
nated food or water. A typhoid patient is always the 
victim of somebody's carelessness. Proper safeguard- 
ing of the water and milk supply in a community, with 
prompt isolation of any typhoid subject who may appear, 
will practically eliminate the disease. Typhoid bacteria 
find a congenial soil in the large intestine and fl,ourish 
there at the expense of the intestinal wall, causing ulcers 
and giving off poisons which are absorbed and circulate 
in the blood to poison the whole body. On account of 
the intestinal ulcers, the diet must not cause irritation 
or undue distension of the intestinal walls. This is one 
reason why the food must be very easy to digest and 
absolutely free from all indigestible substances, such as 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 305 

cellulose, seeds, or even large undigested food fragments. 
In the early stages, the digestion may be greatly dis- 
turbed and little food of any kind can be given. But 
typhoid runs a long course (four to six weeks) and these 
first symptoms subside more or less completely in a com- 
paratively short time, after which digestion may con- 
stantly improve. The power of the body to absorb and 
utilize food is not much impaired, so that once digestion 
is good the increased energy demands can be nearly,' if 
not fully met, and the great wasting once thought inevi- 
table prevented. There are cases on record in which the 
patients have actually gained weight while the disease 
was in progress. If such feeding is possible, the dangers 
of exhaustion and slow convalescence are much lessened. 
For the early stages, then, it is likely that a fluid diet 
will be adhered to very strictly, one consisting prin- 
cipally of modified milk being most generally employed. 
The amount and nutritive value will depend upon the 
condition of the patient, the best success being generally 
obtained with from 1000 to 3000 Calories per day. The 
following are good examples of the modified milk diets.

A typhoid patient is not always limited to a fluid diet, 
though solid foods must be given cautiously and intro- 
duced gradually. The foods from which the diet should 
be chosen are : 

1. Milk in various forms 

2. Broths — beef, veal, chicken, mutton 

3 . Soups — potato, pea, bean, carefully strained and thickened 

with flour. MUk, cream, and egg may be used 

4. Gruels — always strained 

5. Eggs, raw or soft-cooked 

6. Cream and butter 

7. Custards, ice creams and sherbets, blancmanges, and gelatin 

jellies. MUk sugar used for sweetening wiU increase the

8. Toast 

9. Breakfast cereals, thoroughly cooked and strained 

10. Rice, baked and mashed potatoes 

11. Apple sauce, orange juice and grape juice 

Such a diet is adapted to the early stages of conva- 
lescence, when not prescribed during the fever. A 
dietary which illustrates the high feeding on a very 
simple, easily digested, mixed diet, free from anything 
likely to cause intestinal irritation or other disturbance, 
is here quoted.^

Diet in Tuberculosis 

When the tubercle bacillus gains a foothold in the 
human body, it not only proceeds to destroy the organ 
upon which it encamps, — lungs, kidney, or whatever 
it may be — but it produces poisons which permeate 
the whole system, causing fever, loss of appetite, and 
other bad conditions which result in the wasting so 
familiar in this dread disease. There is no drug which 
will kill or drive out the germ : the body must elaborate 
its own weapons of defense, and the object of treatment 
is to build the person up so that resistance to the disease 
will become great enough to bring about a cure. Every- 
thing which will help to promote good nutrition must be 
emphasized — all the fresh air obtainable, carefully 
regulated rest and exercise, and good food in abundance. 
As in typhoid fever, the amount and kind of food is of 
great importance. But in tuberculosis the appetite is 
apt to be poor and fitful and is no guide whatever as to 
how much the patient should eat. Often he must con- 
tinue eating when he does not want food at all. But 
this does not mean that he should be indiscriminately 
"stuffed." The best dieting is that which keeps his 
digestive tract in as good condition as possible and yet 
brings about a gain in weight, until he attains the highest 



3IO FEEDING THE FAMILY 

weight which he is known to have had before contracting 
the disease. Fattening beyond this point seems unde- 
sirable. The amount necessary to produce a satis- 
factory gain in weight will vary with the individual, but 
the best rule which seems to have been evolved by stu- 
dents of the problem is to add one-third more to the diet 
which would be normal for the same person, with the 
lame degree of activity (usually at rest), but without 
tuberculosis. Thus, taking the average requirement for 
a man at rest as 2000 Calories, the provision for the 
same person when tubercular would be about 27CX) 
Calories. Much care must be taken in the selection and 
preparation of food, to see that it is easy of digestion, 
and the amount of food to be eaten must be carefully 
measured. 

As to kind of food, the tubercular patient seems to 
profit by Uberal protein and fat, but indiscriminate stuff- 
ing with these may defeat its own end. An allowance of 
about one- third more prqtein than what would be a liberal 
provision in a non-tubercular diet seems advisable. A 
man in health is abundantly supplied when he has 400 
protein Calories per day: the tubercular man should, 
accordingly, have about 530 protein Calories per day. 
Since the protein is needed to reconstruct wasted tissues, 
the kinds best for growth should have preference — milk 
and eggs particularly — though other protein food can 
also be used to advantage, if prepared in ways easy of 
digestion.^ Fat by its high fuel value helps to keep the 
bulk of the day's diet within practical limits — a great

consideration when the appetite is feeble. Butter, cream,

FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 313 

A tempting diet of high fuel value, with a generous 
proportion (15 to 20 per cent) in the form of protein, is 
likely to be expensive. Cream, butter, eggs, choice meats, 
and dainty cookery and service are beyond the reach 
of many tubercular patients. That tuberculosis can, 
however, be cured on foods which are within the reach 
of the ordinary purse has been demonstrated at the 
Loomis Sanitorium in this country and at those in Eng- 
land under the supervision of the well-known authori- 
ties, Bardswell and Chapman. The day's dietary given 
on page 311, moderate in cost, is based on the day's 
menu served at the Loomis Sanatorium.^ 

Diets even less expensive are those of Bardswell and 
Chapman. The following modification of their plan, 
adapted to American conditions, is a very satisfactory 
basis for low-priced diets.^ 

A Plan fob. Low-priced Tuberculosis Diets 

Breakfast : Large dish of oatmeal, milk and sugar, 2 oz. of bacon 
or smoked fish, 2 slices of bread and oleomargarine 

10 A.M. 3 slices of bread and oleomargarine with prune or 

date marmalade prepared at home 

Luncheon : 8 oz. of soup from one of the dried vegetables (vary 
by making part milk), 2 slices of bread and cheese, 
glass of milk 

Dinner : Plate of meat stew, slice of bread and oleomargarine, 
dish of well-cooked vegetables, 8 oz. of rice or 
tapioca pudding made with milk, glass of milk

Diet in Diabetes 

The regulation of the diet is the most important con- 
sideration in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The 
most striking symptom of the disease is an impaired 
power of utihzing carbohydrates. These ordinarily cir- 
culate in the blood as sugar and are burned by the 
muscles for fuel or stored in muscles and liver. In the 
diabetic the sugar in the blood cannot be burned and 
accumulates in the blood until a certain point is reached, 
when it passes into the urine. Not every one who ex- 
cretes sugar is a diabetic, but the appearance of sugar in 
the urine should be regarded with suspicion and the 
state of health thoroughly investigated, for the sooner 
this disease is treated the better the chance of arresting 
its progress and keeping the patient in comparatively 
good health and comfort. The presence of excessive 
sugar in the blood lowers resistance to bacterial infec- 
tion and invites numerous compUcations, besides hasten- 
ing the progress of the disease itself — that is, the dis- 
turbance of the sugar-burning power of the body. 
Middle-aged and elderly people ought to have their 
urine tested once a year as a precautionary measure. 

While certain general principles in regard to diet for 
diabetes can be laid down, each patient presents an 
individual problem which must be studied, not only at 
the beginning of the treatment, but throughout the course 
of the disease. The power to burn sugar perfectly, once 
lost, is never completely regained ; the diet must always 
be carefully prescribed and changed from time to time 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 315 

according to the development of the disease. If the 
loss of sugar-burning power is very great, it is likely to 
be accompanied by other signs of a disturbed state of 
nutrition, particularly the appearance of certain acids 
in the urine indicative of a condition called acidosis. 
Dietetic treatment must be directed to the control of

acidosis, as well as to the elimination of sugar from the 
urine. 

The first step is fasting ^ till the urine is sugar free, 
then beginning with small amounts of carbohydrate, 
preferably in the form of green vegetables, and gradually 

^ For details see Allen, Treaiment of Diabetes, Boston Medical and 
Surgical Journal, 1915, Vol. 173, p. 241. 



3i6 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

increasing till the person's " tolerance " or sugar-burning 
capacity is learned. This is important because any 
excess over what the tissues can utilize acts as a poison 
and causes the ability to burn carbohydrates to diminish, 
the organs concerned in the process being weakened by 
the strain of tr3dng to care for more than they are able. 
The treatment which follows aims to increase this toler- 
ance by supplying the patient with sufficient nourishment 
without overtaxing the powers of sugar-burning. The 
patient should be provided with scales measuring grams 
for weighing food, and written instructions as to the 
exact amounts of different foods to be eaten. The 
matter is too critical to be left to the crude measure- 
ments of the eye. 

When a certain course is to be pursued for some time, 
— perhaps several months, — a general plan for the diet 
and a table of " carbohydrate equivalents," by means of 
which the menu can be varied, is most conveniently 
followed. Whoever has charge of the feeding of a dia- 
betic patient should learn from the physician exactly how 
much protein, fat, and carbohydrate is to be given, and 
how to estimate the amount of each food to be eaten. 
Such tables as those below ^ give a good general outline 
of the foods available. 

A Scheme for Planning Diabetic Diets 

" Tables A and B are made up of foods that are nearly carbo- 
hydrate-free and from these lists this sort of dietary may be con- 
structed according to the patient's preferences. These foods 
(Tables A and B), may be used without restriction of quantity 
imless there is a necessity of limiting the amount of protein con- 
^ N. B. Foster, American Journal of Medical Sciences, February, 1911. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 317 

sumed. In Tables C and D the foods all contain carbohydrate. 
These tables are to be used only when the carbohydrate tolerance 
of the patient is known, and then the total amount of starch- 
containing food should be kept well below the tolerance limit (by 
at least 10 grams of bread). For example, if 60 grams of white 
bread is assimilated without inducing glycosuria,^ then not more 
than 50 grams in equivalents should be allowed. Further, foods 
like potatoes and fruits should be separately tested with each 
patient in order to determine whether there is any peculiarity of 
reaction toward them respecting sugar excretion. 

" The order and number of meals requires consideration also ; 
four or five meals are better than three ; a second breakfast and 
afternoon tea may be interpolated. Half of the daily allowance 
of bread should be taken at the mid-day meal, and it is better 
that at least a third of the daily bread allowance be used as 
equivalents — vegetables and fruits. 

"Table A 

"Fresh Meats: All muscle parts of beef, veal, pork, lamb, 
mutton, domestic and wUd fowl, either roasted, boiled, or broiled, 
in their juices, with butter, or with mayonnaise made without 
flour, either hot or cold. 

" Various Organs of Animals : Tongue, heart, brains, sweet- 
breads, kidneys, marrow, calves' liver, liver of game or poultry 
(pate de fois gras) up to 100 grams in weight, weighed after being 
prepared. 

"Preserved Meat: Smoked meat, dried meat, smoked or 
pickled tongue, ham or bacon, corned beef, sausage (containing no 
bread). Be sure that no flour is used in preparing pickled meats. 

" Meat Peptones of all kinds, jellies, or aspics prepared from 
calves' feet, or pure gelatin ; nutrose, tropon, plasmon, wheat gluten, 
etc.

before the fish is eaten. All sauces that contain no flour are 
allowed ; those that contain butter and lemon are the best. 

" Preserved Fish : Dried, salted, and smoked, such as haddock 
cod, herring, mackerel, flounder, sturgeon, eels, salmon, etc.

Making a diabetic diet acceptable depends not only 
upon ability to regulate the kind and amount of food, 
but upon skill in cookery, and 
the amount of money available 
for food. Since carbohydrates 
constitute the largest part of an 
ordinary diet, their withdrawal 
changes eating habits materially, 
and people find it difficult to do 
without the familiar bread, 
potatoes, cereals, sugars, and 
fruits. Furthermore, the carbo- 
hydrate foods are relatively the 
cheapest part of the diet, so that 
a diabetic diet will always cost 
more than a mixed diet of the 
same general character. 

The large amount of fat is 
likely to prove disagreeable un- 
less introduced with care into the 
menu. Most books on invalid 
cookery give recipes for diabetic 

diets.^ These are very helpful because the cook is de- 
prived of her ordinary thickening agents, such as flour,

also of sugar and milk, and special devices are necessary to 
make acceptable dishes. The best fats are butter, cream, 
cream cheese, olive oil, bacon fat, meat fats of other 
kinds, bone marrow, fat and highly flavored fish (as 
canned sardines, salmon, mackerel, and whitefish). 
Green vegetables are the best fat carriers. Melted 
butter may be poured over those served hot and olive 
oil or cream dressing over salads. A small potato? 
according to Miss Farmer, may take up one-half its 
weight in butter, or one-fourth its weight in heavy cream. 
Potatoes, however, are not always permissible, while 
green vegetables such as lettuce and cabbage are. Cream 
can be used in place of milk in many dishes. In others, 
cream diluted with water, to which raw white of egg is 
added, will make a satisfactory milk substitute. As a 
rule, the best success in feeding comes from judicious 
use of the ordinary foods in correct amounts. Special 
diabetic foods on the market are expensive and not 
always reliable. They should not be used without 
knowledge of their exact composition.^ The more the 
carbohydrate is removed, the greater the cost. On 
account of the restrictions in breadstuff s, muflGins, wafers, 
and so forth, made with almond, soy bean, casoid,^ or 
pure gluten flour are useful occasionally for the sake of 
variety, even for mild cases, and are a help when the 
carbohydrate is very greatly restricted. 

^ The composition of many diabetic foods may be found in a bulletin 
by Mendel and Street, Diabetic Foods, published by the Connecticut 
Agricultural Experiment Station, New Haven, Conn. 

* The manufacturers of casoid flour publish a cookbook with some 
excellent recipes for the use of this carbohydrate-free flour. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 323 

Saccharine may be used for sweetening in place of 
sugar. It has no food value, but is intensely sweet 
having 500 times the sweetness of cane sugar. The taste 
remains in the mouth much longer than that of sugar, 
and if much is used a bitter taste develops. It should, 
therefore, be used as Httle as possible to get the best 
results in the long run. 

There is always danger of mild diabetes becoming 
severe ; the only way to prevent this is by eternal vigi- 
lance in regard to diet, and careful living, without 
physical overwork or nervous strain. Even when the 
patient is tempted by long periods of continued well- 
being to disregard his dietetic limitations, he should be 
prevented from doing so. A diabetic patient should 
not have charge of his own diet. The unhappy feeling 
of restriction will be less and the temptation to overstep 
the boundaries diminished if some one else plans and 
prepares the meals. 

In severe diabetes protein is restricted as well as car- 
bohydrate, and the body must depend mainly on fat 
for fuel. Under such circumstances the fat-burning 
power also becomes weakened, and the general disturb- 
ance of metabolism is evidenced by acidosis. The 
treatment then must attempt to correct both sugar 
and acid excretion. No one diet will serve this pur- 
pose. Treatment can be best carried on in hospital 
or sanitarium — at any rate, under constant guidance of 
a physician. 

One device for resting the impaired functions and 
reducing sugar in the blood is to prescribe "green" or 



324

"vegetable" days, when little food of any kind is taken. 
The following will serve as an illustration of this type 
of diet. 

Green Days^ 

Breakfast : i egg, boiled or poached 
Cupful of black coffee 

Dinner : Spinach, with hard-boiled egg 
Bacon, 15 gm. (^ oz.) 
Salad with 15 gm. (| oz.) of oil 
White wine, 5 1. (4 oz.), or whisky or bi aidy, 30 c.c. 
(i oz.) 

Cup of beef-tea or chicken broth 



4 : 30 P.M 
Supper : 



I egg, scrambled with tomato and a little butter

Cabbage, cauliflower, sauerkraut, string-beans, or

White wine, 1 1. (4 oz.), or whisky or brandy, 30 c.c. 

(i oz.) 



In the home treatment of diabetes the problem of 
following the doctor's orders is often difficult because of 
expense. Carbohydrate foods are the cheapest class; 
the more they are excluded, the greater the cost of the 
diet. Some suggestions for low-priced diets are given 
below. 

They will not cost over two cents per 100 Cal- 
ories, and neither will the cost be raised much by the 
addition of a little more carbohydrate food when this is 
permitted.

Diet in Gout 

Gout is a disease of the overfed rather than the under- 
nourished. Luxurious living, with its constant tempta- 
tion to overeat, especially of protein foods, and to avoid 
exercise, often brings its penalty in the form of acute or 
chronic gout. Indulgence in alcoholic beverages, es- 
pecially as an accompaniment to a sumptuous repast, 
increases a man's chances of acquiring the disease. 
Sometimes he suffers for the sins of his ancestors, the 
tendency to the disease being said to be transmissible. 
There are usually disturbances of the digestive system 
— gastric indigestion, intestinal putrefaction, and con- 
stipation — but the most constant symptom is an excess 
of uric acid in the blood, indicating a faulty elimination 
of this substance. Uric acid is formed in the body, but 
in health it is excreted in the urine, so that the amount 
in circulation in the blood is very small. In gout this 
acid accumulates in the blood and is eliminated with 
difficulty. The following are to be avoided : (i) all 
foods which disturb digestion ; (2) all foods which tend 
to induce intestinal putrefaction and constipation; 
(3) all excess of total fuel and of protein food ; and (4) all 
foods which by their composition tend to increase the 
amount of uric acid which the body has to get rid of. 
Uric acid belongs to a group of closely related substances 
called purins. These are found in flesh foods of all kinds 
and in some vegetable foods. The purins other than 
uric acid in these foods are mostly converted into uric 
acid in the body. Hence, if elimination is faulty, they 



328 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

raise the amount of uric acid in the blood, a condition 
considered very unfavorable in cases of gout, though the 
relation of this substance to the disease is not fully 
understood. The taking of alcoholic beverages also 
tends to hinder uric acid elimination, and these should 
be excluded in gout. 

The treatment is largely dietetic and the diet should 
be adapted to the needs of the patient by the physician. 
Some information, however, as to the purin content of 
foods will be helpful in carrying out his orders. Milk, 
eggs, cheese, nuts, gelatin, fruits, sugars, breadstuffs 
made with white flour, cornstarch, tapioca, farina, rice, 
potatoes and other root vegetables, most green vege- 
tables (spinach and asparagus excepted), and all kinds 
of fat are practically purin-free. 

Sweetbreads, kidney, liver, sardines, and anchovies 
are very rich in purins and should be entirely avoided. 
Beef, veal, mutton, pork, chicken, turkey, goose and 
other kinds of game, fish with the exception of cod, are 
fairly high in purin content, and should be sparingly if 
at all indulged in. Boiling meat will remove some of the 
purins ; hence boiled meats are sometimes allowed where 
roasted or broiled ones are not. Among vegetable foods, 
spinach, asparagus, peas, and beans are richest in purins, 
though none of these contains as much as meat. A die- 
tary indicating the type of food best adapted to use in 
gout is given below.

TABLE I 

ioo-Calohie Portions of Foods as We Eat Them 

Introductory Note 

Most of these foods have been measured and weighed 
in the author's laboratory, some of them many times. 
Nevertheless, standardization of measures and weights 
is exceedingly difficult, and these tables make no claim 
to strict mathematical accuracy. They are presented 
with the hope of enabUng the housewife who does not 
wish the burden of weighing and making calculations 
— or the persons who cannot go behind the scenes, i.e. 
into the kitchen — to get quickly some fair conception 
of the relative value of various foods as they appear on 
the table. The data on uncooked single food materials 
have been taken largely from the author's Laboratory 
Handbook for Dietetics, based on the Analyses of Ameri- 
can Food Materials, published as Bulletin 28, Office of 
Experiment Stations, U. S. Department of Agriculture, 
from which latter source have also been taken some 
analyses of cooked foods.

APPENDIX 349 

TABLE II 

Food Valxjes in Terms of Common Measures 

Introductory Note 

This table is designed to supplement Table I, as an 
aid in the estimation of the food value of various dishes 
made in the kitchen. It consists of information as to 
the food value of materials which the cook is accustomed 
to using by measure and generally uncooked. In har- 
mony with modern culinary practice, level measurements 
have been employed throughout. By this means we 
secure greater exactness and uniformity in the quantity 
meant by a half-pint cupful, a tablespoonful, or a tea- 
spoonful. Even thus, the quantities obtained by meas- 
urement are rather variable. Foods which pack down 
easily, such as flour or chopped fruits, give a cupful 
whose weight will vary a great deal, while other foods, 
like butter and granulated sugar, give a cupful of much 
more constant weight. Similarly, a tablespoonful of 
sugar is a fairly constant quantity, while a tablespoonful 
of molasses, cream, or ohve oil, weighs more or less 
according to the viscosity of the material or one's inter- 
pretation of a level tablespoonful of a liquid which can 
actually be heaped up to some extent on the spoon. 

It is believed that the weights given in the table are 
fair averages, but the difficulties inherent in producing 
such a table must be borne in mind. To get a quantity 
exactly corresponding to the food values stated for any 
measurement, the food must actually be weighed. And, 
strictly speaking, weights in ounces are too crude for the 



350 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

purpose. The gram (28.35 grams equal i ounce) is the 
unit upon which the calculation of Calories is based.^ 
This is a unit too small to have much significance in the 
kitchen, but it is mentioned here to explain any dis- 
crepancies which seem to occur between the weights and 
food values as given in the table. Anyone wishing accu- 
rate data on food values by weight can find them else- 
where.2 

With this table, in conjunction with Table I, any- 
one can estimate the food values of a given recipe, if it 
is not to be found in Table III. For example, suppose 
one makes a cake by the following recipe : 

3 eggs I tbsp. butter 

I cup sugar i cup flour 

5 tbsp. milk 2 tsp. baking powder 
J tsp. salt 

Referring to the table for the total fuel value of each 
ingredient, 

3 eggs = 3 X 70 Calories =210 Calories 

I cup sugar = i X 840 Calories = 840 Calories 
J tbsp. milk = ^ X 14 Calories = 7 Calories 
I tbsp. butter = i x 109 Calories = 109 Calories 

I cup flour = I X 395 Calories = 395 Calories 

Total for recipe 1561 Calories 

The salt has no fuel value, and the small amount con- 
tributed by starch in baking powder may be disregarded. 

* I gram of protein jrields 4 Calories. 
I gram of fat yields 9 Calories. 

I gram of carbohydrate yields 4 Calories.

APPENDIX 355 

TABLE m 

Dietary Recipes 
Introductory Note 
Since a great deal of variation in food value is pos- 
sible in the same dish, according to the recipe used, it 
has seemed desirable to indicate the ingredients of the 
dishes whose food values in terms of loo-Calorie portions 
have been given in Table I. Here are included almost 
all the combinations of food materials used in prepara- 
tion of the dietaries given throughout the book, as well 
as a number of other dishes with which any cook is hkely 
to be familiar. The ingredients of each recipe have 
been measured and weighed separately, their food values 
calculated on these weights, and then added together to 
give the food value of the whole recipe. Each dish has 
then been cooked and when ready to eat measured 
and weighed. From the weight and total Calories of the 
cooked product the loo-Calorie portion has in each case 
been estimated, then weighed out and measured as 
accurately as possible with ordinary kitchen equipment, 
i.e. half-pint cups divided into quarters and thirds, 
tablespoons and teaspoons, supplemented by an ordinary 
foot rule. From the scientific point of view such a 
method is very crude. No two people measuring flour 
for a cake will get exactly the same weight. Then, too, 
the finished cake will vary in weight according to these 
differences in weight of ingredients and also according 
to the size and shape of the pan, the intensity of the 
oven heat, and the length of time of baking. Further- 
more, it is not possible to measure the cubical contents 



356 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

exactly with a ruler, as few cakes are perfectly flat on 
top. Moreover, a sample cut from the soft center may 
weigh the same as one from a hardened corner, but the 
measurements will not agree exactly. For such reasons, 
data on cooked food materials, unless prepared by the 
methods of the chemical laboratory instead of the kitchen, 
must be regarded as approximate rather than absolutely 
accurate. To the housewife, intent on learning to esti- 
mate food values for the general welfare of her family, 
these discrepancies are of no moment. A variation of 
a few Calories in a day's dietary has no particular sig- 
nificance. What she needs to know is the approximate 
food value of any dish which she is preparing. She 
can then estimate the food value of each individual serv- 
ing without difficulty. This is why the food values for 
the whole recipe have been stated. Moreover, if any- 
one will take the trouble to measure a loo-Calorie por- 
tion, she will find it possible to remember this well 
enough to judge of the food value of any portion served. 
For example, icx? Calories of mince pie require a sector one 
inch on the outer circumference ; a 9-inch pie is about 28 
inches in circumference, and hence will yield about 2800 
Calories ; if each serving is three inches on the outer edge, 
it will contain 300 Calories — if four inches, 400 Calories, 
etc. Such estimates are perfectly practical for home use. 
In the collection which follows, the recipes are drawn 
from many sources — standard cookbooks or contri- 
butions from students in the author's laboratory — and 
it is believed that they represent the common way of 
making most of the dishes, though a few have been 



APPENDIX 357 

specially arranged for economy's sake. In the latter case, 
the more usual way has sometimes been given in a second 
recipe. No attempt has been made to keep them uni- 
form for any particular number of servings. The aim 
has been merely to indicate proportions of ingredients, 
so that the housewife can compare these recipes with her 
own and where they are alike multiply or divide the 
values of each according to the size of her family. As 
this book is not intended as a substitute for a cookbook, 
the kind and quantity of seasonings have not been given, 
these having no appreciable fuel value.

PREFACE 

While many things contribute to health, — sleep, fresh 
air, and exercise, for instance, — the foremost considera- 
tion is food. This is recognized to-day as never before, 
and those who regard their own welfare and desire to 
give their children the best possible equipment for the 
stress of modern life are asking how to choose food 
wisely. So many kinds of food are displayed in our 
markets, and so many placards offer warning or advice 
about what to eat, that a guidebook to good nutrition 
would seem quite essential for the twentieth century 
family. The purpose of the author has been to provide 
such a little book for the numerous housewives who pre- 
pare something like a thousand meals a year for their 
families and who wish to know how the science of 
nutrition can be made to function most successfully in 
their daily lives. 

Much literature has been published in regard to food 
and diet, but it is not a simple matter to collect and 
organize it for one's own use in the midst of all the 
cares of a household. In the present volume separate 
chapters are devoted to the special food needs of the 
different members of a typical family group — babies, 
growing children, adult men and women, aged persons — 
after which some space is devoted to a consideration of 
the food problems related to the family group as a whole. 



vi PREFACE 

Among the latter are such points as the construction of 
daily menus on a rational basis, the wise expenditure of 
money for food, and reasonable control of the amount 
and kinds of food consumed. Since it is an unfortunate 
fact that the housewife is often called upon to feed the 
sick, a chapter upon this topic has been included. There 
has been no attempt to make this comprehensive or 
detailed, because the sick should be fed under a phy- 
sician's guidance. The writer believes, however, that 
the home feeding of the sick will be more successful if 
intelligently done, and that a few printed suggestions 
will be helpful in carrying out the physician's orders. 

Detailed calculations of the amount of food to be 
consumed each day are neither necessary nor practicable 
in the home, but some information in regard to the rela- 
tive nutritive value of food materials is a great help in 
keeping the diet well balanced. For the sake of those 
who wish to study this phase of feeding", illustrative 
dietaries have been placed in each chapter, and in 
the Appendix tables given for quick estimation of 
the food values of a number of familiar kinds of food. 
These are expressed in terms of ordinary household 
measures (cups, tablespoons, teaspoons) and are as 
accurate as possible with such units of measurement 
applied to materials tending to vary considerably in 
their composition. The housewife does not need to do 
careful weighing so much as to train her eye to judge 
approximate food values, for which measures are usually 
sufficient, though weights are of course more accurate. 
The " dietary recipes " have been given because recipes 
vary so much that the name of a dish does not always 



PREFACE vii 

give a clue to its exact composition. Often several 
recipes for the same type of dish have been given, to 
show how the food value will vary with changes in the 
ingredients. 

The author wishes to acknowledge with thanks the 
valuable advice and criticism given by Professor Henry 
C. Sherman of Columbia University and the assistance 
of Miss Esther Swartz in the preparation of the manu- 
script.

FEEDING THE FAMILY 

CHAPTER I 
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 

Introduction 

" What shall we have for dinner? " This is the con- 
stant cry of the housewife, who often feels that house- 
keeping would be relieved of one of its greatest bugbears 
if some one else would undertake the planning of the meals. 
And yet this is a burden not so easily shifted from her 
shoulders. Menus may be written for her, but they 
seldom fulfill her requirements exactly as they stand. 
The foods designated are not in the market, or the 
family does not like them, or there are leftovers to be 
disposed of, and the problem remains unsolved. In 
fact, the one who is intrusted with the feeding of the 
family has a responsibility not lightly escaped. Of 
the three necessities of life which the home must pro- 
vide, — food, clothing, and shelter, — food is the most 
important. Without it, life is impossible. With scanty 
provision of it, growth is stunted and energy fails. 
With abundance, one may stuff the furnace until the 
fires of life are dulled by sheer surplus of good fuel. By 
indiscreet choice, precious days of life may be lost on 



2 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

account of headache or other acute, though minor, ills, 
and by continued bad feeding the way paved for serious 
impairment of health. For food most people spend the 
largest part of their incomes. What a pity if they buy 
sickness instead of health ! 

While it is true indeed that " the life is more than 
meat," it is equally true that there is no life of the 
spirit without sustenance for the body. The welfare 
of the family, both physical and spiritual, is largely 
in the hands of the one who provides the " three meals 
a day " which often seem so appalling in their inevi- 
tability. The only way of relief is through mastery 
of the principles which underlie the daily choice of 
meals. " What shall we have for dinner?" does not 
imply choice between nothing and something, as under 
the precarious conditions of primitive life or the equally 
uncertain chances of extreme poverty. It indicates 
rather bewilderment amidst a wealth of materials for 
man's delectation such as the world has never seen 
before. If only half a dozen foods were available, the 
matter would be quickly settled. The question is apt 
to mean, What new foods can be found to delight the 
palate or charm the eye of those who are never really 
hungry ? Eating is a social custom as well as a physio- 
logical necessity, and the hostess, even at a table of 
two, is disturbed, votes her dinner a failure and her 
efforts wasted if her partner does not partake freely. 
What she may really need is more skill in divining 
his physiological requirements, rather than in preparing 
dainty dishes to pamper his appetite. 



THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 3 

Many traditions have grown up about foods, preju- 
dices against this and that, rooted in ancient tribal or 
religious taboos, or the results of misinterpreted experi- 
ences ; thus some men have called meat, the sign of the 
chase, the means of producing warlike qualities in human 
beings, attributing to meat eating "all evil passions 
and all vain belief — the germs of misery, death, dis- 
ease, and crime,' ' and others have devoted their best 
energies to convincing the world that "an exclusively 
farinaceous and fruit diet is best adapted to the develop- 
ment and improvement of all powers of body, mind, and 
soul." The occult powers of the moon are no greater 
than the reputed magic of all sorts of foods. Many a 
little girl has patiently eaten dry bread crusts to make 
her hair curl; many a man counted on meat to make 
strong muscles or fish to develop his brain power ! 

In the light of modern scientific research these tradi- 
tions give way to exact knowledge of what food does for 
the body and how it does it. By patient steps, through 
Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood; 
Priestly and Scheele's discovery of oxygen; Lavoisier's 
brilliant insight into the relation between the intake of 
oxygen into the body in respiration, the output of car- 
bon dioxide from the lungs, and the evolution of heat 
and work in the body ; Liebig's study of the composition 
of foods and body materials; Pettenkofer and Voit's 
demonstration of the possibility of measuring the heat 
given off and work done by the body; and Rubner's 
accurate researches establishing definite relationship 
between food consumption and body activity, — through 



4 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

the work of these and other able investigators, we have 
come to the realization that nutrition is science rather 
than a bundle of old wives' rules ; that foods, though so 
numerous and so varied in form, can be reduced to rather 
simple terms ; that the amount required by a man for a 
day's work can be determined with amazing accuracy; 
and that even the factors which govern so obscure an 
impulse as the power to grow can be analyzed and a 
young animal made to grow or stunted at will by the 
control of its food. 

Scientists in many laboratories are studying the laws 
which govern nutrition, and as they progress in knowl- 
edge the housewife is given new standards by which to 
choose the food for the family, and greatly increased 
ability to secure physical welfare for the group in her 
care. She is also relieved of old and foolish fears about 
the baleful influence of this or that particular food, and 
turns a deaf ear to alarmists and faddists, who by juggling 
with technical terms often put good foods into disrepute. 
Meals of many kinds are found to be good and sim- 
plicity may be cultivated without fear of malnutrition. 

The Body a Working Machine 

In considering the part which food plays in human 
life, the most important conception which modern science 
has given us is that of the body as a working machine, 
whose output we can measure as accurately as that of 
any steam, gasoline, or electric engine. Unlike other 
machines, this living one must work to exist. Man is 
to be compared to a clock, going all the time, rather 



THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 5 

than to an automobile engine, working only at intervals. 
When lying asleep or perfectly quiet, the heart is doing 
its work, which, counted for a whole day, will amount 
to as much as lifting an average man some 2500 feet 
into the air; the chest is moving in respiration; the 
muscles are under tension ready for any sudden call to 
further work ; the digestive tract is busy, caring for the 
last meal, or if that is gone, possibly by vigorous move- 
ment calling like Oliver Twist for " more." Every move- 
ment, voluntary or involuntary, even to winking an eye, 
is work in the mechanical sense; and exercise which 
brings many muscles into play, whether in digging a 
ditch or playing football, sweeping a room or flitting 
over a tennis court, adds to the energy expended in 
proportion to its severity. 

Fuel for the Human Machine 
In order to have energy to spend as outlined above, 
we must first acquire it. But how? The earth's great 
bank of energy is the sun ; its currency is light and heat. 
These man cannot "cash in" directly. They have to 
go through a great clearing house, the plant world, 
before they become available for the human economy. 
Plant cells transmute light and heat into chemical energy 
and bind this with elements from the air and soil to 
make three great classes of energy-bearing substances, 
which man can use for his activities, known as protein, 
fat, and carbohydrate. These are the "fuels" which 
supply energy for the human machine. This energy of 
food may be converted into useful work — inside the 



6 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

body in keeping up the life processes, outside in per- 
forming all sorts of muscular movement — and also into 
heat to maintain body temperature. In fact, heat is a 
by-product of all bodily activities, which is turned to 
good account in keeping warm. If not enough is obtain- 
able in this way, the transformation of more energy into 
heat can be brought about by doing more work (shiver- 
ing, clapping the hands, stamping about, running, etc.) ; 
or if this is not done, by the automatic response of in- 
ternal processes to the stimulus of cold, increasing the 
rate at which body fuel is burned. Since the three fuel 
foodstuffs are so essential to man's well-being, it be- 
hooves us to inquire how they may be obtained. 

Sources of Body Fuel 

The three substances which serve as body fuel, pro- 
tein, fat, and carbohydrate, are found variously distributed 
in all kinds of vegetable food. From the juice of the 
beet and sugar cane we refine a pure carbohydrate, 
sugar, which is also found in the juice of sweet fruits and 
vegetables, such as oranges, grapes, apples, corn, peas, 
etc. From wheat, oats, corn, and other grains, potato 
tubers, manioc roots (tapioca), we secure another form 
of pure carbohydrate, starch, which is also found in lesser 
amounts in many kinds of fruit and vegetables, as 
bananas, peas, beans, nuts (especially chestnuts). 

From olives, cottonseed, peanuts, cocoa beans, and 
other seeds we can obtain pure fat, which we find plenti- 
ful in nuts, but only in small amounts in other kinds of 
vegetable food. 



THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 7 

The vegetable foods which have the largest amounts 
of protein are the legumes, — peas, beans, lentils, and pea- 
nuts. Nuts such as almonds, filberts, walnuts, pecans, 
have also a considerable store. Next in importance come 
the cereals, with oats, wheat, and corn heading the list. 
Other vegetable foods contribute comparatively small 
amounts of this sort of fuel. 

Plant foods may be called the original source of human 
energy. But animals, eating the plants, may work over 
the protein, fat, and carbohydrate of their plant food in 
their internal laboratories, the living cells, and produce 
animal protein from the vegetable protein, animal fat 
from the vegetable carbohydrate or fat, and animal car- 
bohydrates from any one of these three, but especially 
from the carbohydrates. These new forms, elaborated 
in the animal body, also serve man for fuel. In animal 
food as he eats it there is little carbohydrate, except in 
milk, though scallops, oysters, and clams are perhaps 
worthy of mention. Fat is found more or less inti- 
mately associated with lean in all kinds of meat, 
about the leanest animal food being codfish. Milk 
is often prized most for its fat, in the form of cream 
or butter, and bacon also offers fat in a very acceptable 
form. 

Strictly lean meat affords fuel in the form of protein, 
whatever the animal from which it is derived. From 
bones we get gelatin, also pure protein, though not in 
all respects equivalent to that of meat. Milk and eggs 
are particularly valuable for their protein content. 
Cheese consists chiefly of the protein from milk, with 



8 



FEEDING THE FAMILY 



or without the fat according to variety. Egg white has 
all its fuel in the form of protein, while the yolk has it 
partly as protein and partly as fat. 1 

Measurement of the Fuel Value of Food 

Food materials differ greatly in the amount of pro- 
tein, fat, and carbohydrate which they may con- 
tain. Some, as has been noted, have only one kind of 
I

fuel, some two, and some all three, and these in varying 
proportions. It is, nevertheless, a comparatively simple 
matter to find out how much energy (or working power) 
a given kind of food is capable of yielding in the body. 

1 For further information on the kind and relative amounts of protein, 
fat, and carbohydrate in different food materials, the reader is referred 
to Tables I, II, and III, of the Appendix, to Sherman's Food Products, 
Rose's Laboratory Handbook for Dietetics, or to Chemical Composition 
of American Food Materials, Bulletin 28, Office of Experiment Stations, 
U. S. Dept. of Agriculture. 



THE_ SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 9 

The chemical processes by which energy is liberated are 
of the same nature as burning outside the body. If we 
take some kind of food, then, as a lump of sugar, and 
burn it under such conditions as to make the process 
complete and to measure all the heat generated, we can 
express this heat in terms of a standard unit of measure- 
ment, called the Calorie. 1 A special piece of apparatus 
is used in food laboratories which fulfills all the require- 
ments for measuring the fuel value of food ; it is called 
a calorimeter. The food is burned in an atmosphere of 
pure oxygen in a gas-tight chamber or "bomb," and the 
heat is taken up in water surrounding the bomb, the 
change in temperature of the water showing the amount 
of heat liberated. 

In reckoning the fuel value of food, we have to consider 
whether it will be burned as completely in the body as 
in the calorimeter and one of the tasks of the nutrition 
laboratories has been to discover the losses due to im- 
perfect utilization of food materials. From hundreds of 
digestion experiments we have learned how to correct 
the calorimeter returns for the healthy person on a mixed 
diet and can say in general that an ounce of pure carbo- 
hydrate or pure protein will yield 113 Calories to the 
body; an ounce of fat, 255 Calories. 

But, as we have seen, 2 most of our foods are mixtures 
of these substances in varying proportions, and almost 
always we find associated with the energy-yielding sub-

grade or 1 pound of water 4 Fahrenheit.

stances water and salts, very valuable in the diet for 
other reasons, but not sources of energy; also plant 
fiber or cellulose, a form of carbohydrate which the body 
cannot use for fuel but which makes valuable ballast 
for the digestive tract. We may say, then, that the 
more water and cellulose a given food contains the lower 
its fuel value for a given weight will be. Thus the fuel 
value of pure sugar is 1814 Calories per pound; that of 
grape juice, which as regards fuel is practically a dilute 
solution of sugar, is only 454 Calories per pound ; while 
that of tomatoes, which are largely water and cellulose, 
is but 103 Calories per pound. Pure proteins and car- 
bohydrates have the same fuel value per pound in the 
body, but pure fat has two and one-fourth times as high 
an energy value; hence the more fat a food contains, 
the higher its energy value in proportion to its weight. 

Some differences in fuel values of various foods, 
when compared by weight, are brought out in the fol- 
lowing tables, in which the foods are grouped according 
to the foodstuff which predominates in them :

From such tables it is easy to see that we could scarcely 
depend upon celery or lettuce for our daily fuel supply, 
as it would be hard to eat even a single pound in one day 
and a man would require over 25 pounds. It is also evi- 
dent that some foods are cheaper fuel than others, bread at 
6| cents a pound being nearly 20 times as cheap fuel as 
oysters at 2 5 cents a pound. In everyday life, however, we 



THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 13 

do not eat foods by the pound, but by the serving. When 
we sit down to the table and the host serves the meat, we 
should like to be able to tell how much energy he is pass- 
ing us. When the dessert comes in, we should need men- 
tal agility indeed to translate pounds of eggs, flour, sugar, 
and cream into ice cream and cake. A better unit for this 
purpose is the amount of food required to yield 100 Calo- 
ries, which corresponds quite closely to the ordinary serv- 
ing of a number of foods. The following table shows how 
convenient a unit this is for practical purposes. 1

Measurement of the Fuel Requirements of the Body 

Food is fuel for the human machine, but how shall 
we know how much to supply? Ordinarily we trust to 
appetite, and an unperverted appetite is a very useful 
guide to rational eating. If an adult year in and year 
out maintains a uniform normal weight, we may assume 
that his food supply is adjusted to his needs. If a child 
makes healthy, steady gains in weight throughout the 
period of growth, a study of the food which he con- 
sumes will give us a good clue as to his actual needs. 
But all adults do not maintain normal weight; some 
are too thin and many are too fat ; all children do not 
make normal gains in weight; appetite is too great or 
too little or too pampered ; and we need accurate meas- 
urement by scientific methods of the real fuel needs of 
the body to serve as a check on appetite or as a guide 
when appetite fails. Before it was realized that the 
energy in food must be proportioned to the body's 
energy expenditure, it was the custom to feed invalids 
very largely on beef tea and other broths with little fuel 
value. No matter how quietly they lay in bed, the 
internal work of their bodies had to go on, which means 
that fuel was still being burned ; only in this case little 
of it came from food, and most of it from stores of fat 
held in the body for just such emergencies, and some of 
it from the proteins of the body itself, such as the pro- 
teins of muscle. Now it is clearly understood that a 
man lying quietly in bed throughout the twenty-four 
hours of the day burns at least twelve Calories for every 



THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 15 

pound of body weight, which means for an average man 
a daily total of from 1600 to 1800 Calories. So far as 
conditions permit, care is taken to see that the energy 
supply comes from food, rather than that the body be 
permitted to burn itself up. A general starving policy 
for the sick is as obsolete as blood-letting. 

The most satisfactory way to study any person's fuel 
requirements is to measure directly the amount of energy 
given off from his body hour by hour in the forms of 
work and heat. To do this, a closed chamber with walls 
impervious to heat is required, and devices for supplying 
fresh air and food, so that the person may remain within 
for some time. Such a device is called a respiration 
calorimeter. In its present state of perfection (the result 
of many years of experimentation) it is very elaborate 
and expensive to build and operate; hence the whole 
number in the world is not large. The illustration oppo- 
site shows the double-walled chamber (containing in this 
case a baby's bed) and some of the pipes for the ven- 
tilating system, which includes measurement and analysis 
of the air as it enters and leaves the calorimeter. In 
such a chamber a person may remain under normal con- 
ditions while his energy output is measured during sleep,* 
awake but lying quietly, sitting up at rest, reading, writ- 
ing, riding a bicycle, or doing anything which the size of 
the chamber permits. 

The energy expenditures of men, women, and children 
have been studied in this way, and no matter what pre- 
conceived notions a person may have had about his own 
food requirements, the calorimeter measures his actual 



1 6 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

energy expenditure, which there is no way to meet ex- 
cept by food. Hundreds of observations show that 
men under the same conditions of age, weight, and occu- 
pation expend practically the same amount of energy. 
This is further verified by studies of food consumption 
of men of the same class, doing the same kind of 
work, in different parts of the world, as the table below 
strikingly illustrates. 1 

Farmers in Connecticut 3410 Calories 

Farmers in Vermont 3635 Calories 

Farmers in New York 3785 Calories 

Farmers in Mexico 3435 Calories 

Farmers in Italy 3565 Calories 

Farmers in Finland 3474 Calories 

Average 3551 Calories 

As far as energy requirement is concerned, nutrition 
is an exact science ; a definite amount of work calls for 
a definite amount of energy in the form of food. The 
only reason why we are not forced to stop working as 
soon as food is withheld is that we are able to carry 
stores of fat (and a little carbohydrate) as reserve fuel, 
and also to draw if necessary on our own body protein. 
So men have fasted thirty and forty days ; but the body 
becomes more and more impoverished, and when the 
reserves are exhausted there must come fuel in the form 
of food, or all work stops and death is the result. On 
the other hand, if more fuel is supplied than can be 
used, the fires do not burn the brighter, but the surplus 
is stored up for emergencies and we say the person is

getting fat. In later chapters the fuel requirements of 
the different members of the family will be discussed in 
detail. 

The Body a Builder of its Own Tissues 
The body is not only an active, working machine, 
spending energy in the form of work and heat, and de- 
manding that the expenditure be made good by fresh 
supplies of fuel in the form of food ; it is also a busy 
contractor, sending goods hither and yon along a net- 
work of traffic lines, to add to parts already built, or to 
replace or repair parts lost through ordinary wear and 
tear or through accident. The materials handled are of 
various kinds, made up from 16 or 17 different 
elements, among which may be mentioned carbon, 
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, iron, 
calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, chlorine, and 
iodine. By means of these substances a seven-pound 
baby grows until he becomes a man weighing perhaps 
200 pounds; and the man, though daily losing small 
portions as the price of his very existence, may still 
maintain a uniform weight through many years of adult 
life, by taking in enough to replace what has been lost. 
The relative amounts of these different elements in the 
adult body is shown in the following table : 

Average Elementary Composition of the Human Body 1 

Oxygen, about 65.0 per cent 

Carbon, about 18.0 per cent 

Hydrogen, about 10.0 per cent 

Nitrogen 3.0 per cent

How Food Supplies the Material for Body Building 

The fuel foods all contain carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen, so that no special attention need be paid to 
these elements. Protein food has an absolute monopoly 
of the nitrogen supply for the body, and so occupies a 
distinguished place in the human economy, for nitrogen 
enters into the construction of body proteins, which are 
essential to the life of every cell and constitute the most 
prominent part of muscle tissue. A child cannot grow 
and form strong muscles without it ; a full-grown adult 
cannot keep in health without it, for throughout life the 
cells discard small amounts of nitrogen hour by hour, as 
a waste product of their internal life ; furthermore, some 
old cells die, are disintegrated and their nitrogen thrown 
out, so that altogether there is a certain daily loss which 
must be made good by protein food. Hence in choosing 
the day's fuel we cannot confine ourselves to carbohydrate 
and fat, but must include some protein. The proportion 
of fuel best taken in this form will be discussed in con- 
nection with the food requirements of the different indi- 
viduals in the family group. 



THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 19 

Protein is a term standing for a large number of re- 
lated substances, all made by the chemical union of 
simpler substances containing nitrogen, called amino 
acids. There are 17 of these entering into the 
structure of common proteins, and, as has been aptly 
suggested, these are used like the letters of the alphabet 
to build up different kinds of protein. It is estimated 
that these 17 units may be joined together to make 
350 million times a million different combinations, 
using only a single representative of each. Hence we 
have milk, meat, fish, egg, cereal, and vegetable proteins, 
all built from the same " building stones," or the same 
" letters of the protein alphabet," containing therefore 
all the essentials for constructing different kinds of body 
protein, as circumstances may require. Such proteins 
are called " complete." There are certain proteins, 
such as gelatin and some kinds found in vegetable foods, 
in which important amino acids are lacking. If these 
" incomplete" proteins were used as the sole kind of 
protein in the diet of children they could not grow, 
because some of the constituents for building body pro- 
tein would be lacking. It would be like taking the word 
legume apart and trying to make the word muscle. We 
should have a superfluous g and e, but no 5 nor c, and 
be forced to break up another word, such as casein, to 
get the extra letters. The effect of incomplete proteins 
has been most interestingly shown in the feeding of young 
rats. When given milk food or a mixed diet they grew 
up in the normal way, but on a diet in which the only 
protein food was a single kind of incomplete protein 



20 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

called gliadin, separated for the purpose from all the 
other proteins of the wheat kernel, they seemed perfectly- 
well but could not grow ; as long as they were kept on the 
gliadin diet they remained dwarfs, but as soon as fed 
with the milk food or mixed diet they began to grow 
again. In one experiment a rat fed the gliadin diet 
weighed, when 140 days old, just what it should have 
weighed when 36 days old ! 

Fortunately, most protein foods contain a goodly 
assortment of amino acids, and on an ordinary mixed 
diet, in which milk, eggs, meat, fish, and various vege- 
tables rich in protein are used, an adult need have little 
concern as to the particular kind of protein which he is 
taking. If he confines himself to vegetable food, in 
which incomplete proteins are more frequent, there is 
more danger of lack of sufficient amounts of some amino 
acid, and the combination with such a diet of some milk, 
cheese, or other food known to be rich in " complete " 
proteins is wise. In the diet of growing children this 
is a matter of more importance, and emphasis must be 
laid on the best proteins for growth, as will be brought 
out in the chapters on feeding of children. Protein in the 
food is measured according to its weight, usually in 
grams, 1 according to its fuel value, in Calories, or accord- 
ing to the amount of nitrogen which it contains. The 
following table shows these protein and nitrogen values 
for a number of foods rich in protein :

Sulphur is supplied in the form of protein food, and 
if the nitrogen requirement is met the sulphur need give 
no concern. 

Phosphorus is equally important with nitrogen, 
though required in smaller amounts. It forms a part 
of every active cell of the body and, along with calcium, 
helps to give rigidity to the bones. It is not limited like 
nitrogen and sulphur to the protein of food, but is found

Iron is another element essential to body structure. 
It enters into the composition of the red corpuscles of 
the blood (essential to the conveyance of oxygen to the 
cells and hence to the burning of the fuel foods) and also 
is an element in the structure of all active cells, so play- 
ing a part in secretion and growth. While not needed 
in very large amounts, it is so important that the new- 
born child is not left to the chances of getting it in his 
food, but comes into the world with a special supply to 
tide him over the first few months while he is getting 
adjusted to the outer world. It is found in a variety of 
foods, among the most valuable being egg yolks and 
green vegetables, especially spinach.

Without calcium strong bones and teeth are impossible, 
since it, in combination with phosphorus, is the chief 
mineral element of these tissues. By far the most valu- 
able food for calcium is milk, 100 Calories of milk yield- 
ing as much as could be got from about 2400 Calories of 
white bread and meat. Considerable calcium can be ob- 
tained from the grains if the outer coats are included, but 
very little from cereal preparations made without them, as

The other elements which go to make up the body 
structure are not only required in comparatively small 
amounts, but are practically certain to be provided if the 
diet contains the range of foods which will include the 
four already mentioned. Hence for practical purposes 
they may be dismissed without further discussion. 

Balance Wheels for the Human Machine 

A man with locomotor ataxia is a pitiable sight. He 
can move about, but he has lost the power to control 



26 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

his movements at will. He makes us realize what fine 
coordination of nerves and muscles ordinary people 
enjoy. Now the body is composed of many units, each 
with activities of its own, but subservient to the welfare 
of the whole; there are glands, like the pancreas and 
the thyroid, which play a wonderful part in this coordi- 
nation. If the pancreas becomes seriously deranged, 
the body loses the power to burn carbohydrate and this 
most valuable of fuel foods is lost to the economy; if 
the thyroid gets excessively active, the body may burn 
fuel faster than it can be supplied, and the victim grows 
emaciated. 

So, too, the chemical elements which make up the 
body substance must be nicely balanced or trouble 
ensues. The blood maintains its neutrality, the heart 
its regular beat, nerves and muscles their ready response 
to every impulse, largely through the presence of phos- 
phorus, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium in 
suitable amounts in the tissues and fluids. Water helps 
to regulate the concentration of the mineral elements, 
to make possible the transportation of materials to the 
tissues by holding them in solution in the body fluids, 
and to facilitate the removal of waste through the kidney 
drainage system. The elements which enter into food 
in other forms than protein, fat, carbohydrate, and 
water are conveniently grouped together as ash constit- 
uents, because they constitute the part left behind as 
ash when food materials are burned. They are some- 
times styled " salts" or ''mineral matter." 

Besides the fuel foodstuffs, water, and ash constituents, 



THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD 27 

there are substances existing in minute quantities in 
some foods and not in others which exercise a profound 
influence upon nutrition. These have only recently 
been studied at all, and their exact nature is still a 
matter of investigation. They are spoken of as " vita- 
mines" or ''accessory food substances." Young white 
rats fed a diet of strictly pure protein, fat, carbohydrate, 
and ash constituents in suitable proportions, will not 
grow. If, however, certain natural food fats, such as 
butter, or beef fat, be substituted for the highly refined 
fat, an improvement is very quickly noted. So, too, 
persons living almost exclusively on polished rice develop 
a disease called beriberi, which can be cured by feeding 
the unpolished rice, or by substituting beans for a small 
part of the rice. The United States stamped beriberi 
out of the ranks of the Philippine scouts within three 
years by such simple changes in their army ration. 
Furthermore, individuals restricted to a diet of dried 
and cooked rations, especially if limited in variety, run 
the risk of developing scurvy, which is readily cured by 
the addition of such fresh foods as oranges, lemons, limes, 
potatoes, and cabbage. Babies fed exclusively on cooked 
milk or dried prepared foods run a similar risk, and 
should have some fresh food, such as milk or orange 
juice, included in the diet if it must consist largely of the 
cooked or dried material. 

Under ordinary conditions there is comparatively little 
danger of scurvy or beriberi, since many foods contain 
vitamines and few people confine themselves strictly to 
cooked and dried foods. But it is well to know of the 



28 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

possible results of a too restricted ration and to include 
some fresh food in the diet, such as uncooked fruits and 
vegetables or unpasteurized milk, as well as to see that 
there is some variety in the kinds of food from time to 
time, so that all the elements contributing to good 
nutrition may be represented. 



CHAPTER II 

THE CARE OF THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 

The first requirement for good nutrition is an adequate 
supply of fuel for all body activities. This must be ac- 
companied by or include those substances which serve to 
build up the organism and maintain it in repair, con- 
stituting a so-called " balanced diet." Many selections 
of food will theoretically accomplish these results, but 
not all of them are equally successful in practice. It is 
possible to make a balanced ration from two or three 
foods, if carefully selected, and eat these to the exclusion 
of all others. One may take the whole day's supply of 
protein in the form of cottage cheese, or of beans ; may 
divide the total day's food in two meals or six ; serve 
molasses on meat, as truly a combination of protein and 
carbohydrate as bread and meat. But we must ask 
whether these practices represent the highest art in caring 
for the human machine. It makes a great deal of 
difference in an engine whether the coal for the day 
is put in all at once or at intervals, whether in large 
lumps or fine dust. We may lose valuable fuel through 
imperfect combustion if the fires are choked. Coal may 
fall through the grate and be lost with the ashes if not of 
suitable size. The walls of the fire chamber may be 

29 



SO FEEDING THE FAMILY 

burned out by bad packing preventing circulation of air. 
So in the case of the human furnace a great deal depends 
upon the way in which the fuel is introduced. 

We gather food materials from the four quarters of the 
globe, prepare them in factory and kitchen for the table, 
and yet when the products come to the table they are 
mostly crude material so far as the body is concerned. 
Food must be subjected to many processes in that long 
and tortuous tract which we call the alimentary canal 
before it can enter upon its real functions in the living 
cells where energy is liberated and new material built. 
And the way it behaves in that canal is of great import 
for good nutrition. If it irritates the sensitive walls of 
stomach or intestines, the whole body is depressed, and 
the cells may be unable to make use of good material 
when finally brought to them. If it is crowded along 
too fast, with no time allowed between meals for rest of 
the digestive organs, a strike may be inaugurated against 
such bad working conditions and the poor body left to 
starve in the midst of plenty. 

Before discussing in detail, therefore, the food needs 
of individual members of the family, it will be worth while 
to give some attention to those principles in the choice 
and manner of taking food which in general tend to con- 
serve or promote good digestion and are more or less 
applicable to all. The final purposes in digestion are 
(i) to bring all foods into fluid form, (2) to separate all 
proteins into their amino acid fragments, (3) to divide 
all fats into two components (fatty acids and glycerol), 
soluble in the digestive fluids, and (4) to divide all car- 



THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 31 

bohydrates into their component parts (simple sugars). 
In such simple forms foods pass into the blood stream 
and thence to the tissues. 

The processes by which these objects are attained are 
partly mechanical and partly chemical. They begin 
when food is taken into the mouth and continue in orderly 
fashion until the products indicated above pass through 
the intestinal walls into the blood and lymph, and the 
waste material is eliminated in the feces. 

The Part of the Mouth in Good Digestion 

On guard at the beginning of the alimentary tract 
stands the mouth, whose first duty is to grind up coarse 
foods and soften or possibly dissolve them. Fluid foods 
relieve the mouth of this duty and are therefore selected 
when the teeth are missing or when for some other 
reason chewing is not likely to be well done. Fine minc- 
ing will to a large extent accomplish the same purpose ; 
so beef is sometimes scraped free of all tough fibers, 
vegetables and hard-cooked eggs put through a fine 
sieve when great ease of digestion is desired. On the 
other hand, when chewing is possible, similar fineness 
and softness may be attained by giving foods which 
must be chewed in order to swallow them, such as crisp 
toast, zwiebach, and hard crackers, which tend to break 
up in fine pieces and are not only softened but actually 
dissolved by the saliva, which has the power of acting 
chemically upon carbohydrate material. The agents in 
the alimentary tract which split up proteins, fats, and 
carbohydrates into the fragments which can pass through 



32 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

the intestinal walls (amino acids, fatty acids and glycerol, 
and simple sugars) are technically called enzymes. 
They have been likened to keys, each fitting a single 
kind of lock, and setting free a simpler substance, as if 
one had a nest of boxes and a key to each by which the 
next smaller could be released. Thus in the saliva of 
the mouth we find an enzyme called ptyalin. It will 
unlock a starch unit, producing what we may call a 
"double sugar" 1 (maltose); this in turn must be un- 
locked by another enzyme which will set free from it a 
simple sugar, — the kind which the blood can take to the 
muscles to burn for fuel. By means of nicely adjusted se- 
ries of enzymes the body is kept from being overwhelmed 
with the kind of material which it is trying to use. 
If we take at one time a large quantity of glucose, 
especially when the stomach contains no food which 
might help to dilute it, we are liable to irritation of the 
stomach and possibly of the small intestines, although 
glucose is a simple sugar and requires only to pass into 
the blood to be available to the body. This trouble is 
simply due to the fact that the body has too much of it 
to take care of at once. If it is greatly diluted with 
water before taking, it will cause no trouble ; or if taken 
in small enough quantities to be diluted by the saliva, 
or mixed with other foods so that it is thoroughly diluted 
by them. When starch is taken, it is gradually changed 
to sugar, and this is one great reason why it is better to 
have most of our carbohydrate food in the form of 
starch rather than of sugar. But starch needs to be 
1 Technically known as a disaccharid. 



THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 33 

cooked so that the enzymes can readily attack it 
and large masses of starchy food broken up so that the 
digestive juices can reach every particle. Foods which 
become pasty in the mouth, such as hot breads of many 
kinds, soggy potatoes, or unripe, raw bananas, tend to 
slip down the throat in lumpy masses little affected 
by the saliva and hard for the other juices to penetrate. 
This is another reason why baked potatoes, baked ban- 
anas, and hard, dry bread-stuffs are better for steady 
diet than the pasty foods just mentioned. Pure starches, 
like cornstarch and tapioca, may be cooked rather 
quickly, but cereal foods, especially such forms as break- 
fast preparations of oats, corn, barley, and wheat, have 
their starch grains sealed within pockets of cellulose, 
which the body enzymes cannot soften and which are 
not usually well broken by chewing. Hence without 
long, slow cooking to loosen up these cellulose walls, 
much of the starch will fail to digest. 

Besides helping to grind and soften all hard, coarse 
food and to digest carbohydrate, chewing is one of the 
signals to the stomach to prepare for its duty. The ali- 
mentary canal is operated like a complex railway sys- 
tem. Signals are sent ahead and the way prepared for 
the oncoming load. Hence, while we cannot add to or 
take away from the energy which a food may contain 
by the care with which we chew it, we can make it 
easier for the rest of the digestive work to be carried on 
smoothly. We may thus save ourselves from some of 
the dangers of " indigestion," which often seems to be 
the chief topic when people discuss their food. 



34 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

The Part of the Stomach in Good Digestion 

The stomach is the great reservoir into which food 
from the mouth quietly settles. The receiving end holds 
it in such a way that the gastric juice penetrates it 
slowly ; and the digestion of starchy food, begun in the 
mouth if the food has been thoroughly chewed and mixed 
with saliva, may continue here for some time, till contact 
with the acid gastric juice stops the action of the 
salivary enzyme and ends one chapter in the story of 
digestion. 

A good flow of healthy gastric juice depends upon 
many factors. Regularity in time of meals is one. 
Habit is a powerful force in digestion as elsewhere, and 
the habit of responding to food at regular times and 
those only will do much to keep the stomach healthy. 
Most people are exceedingly careless in this respect, 
and good food is often blamed for bad results, when the 
broken schedule was really what upset the system. 

Efficient mastication has already been mentioned as 
a factor in putting the stomach in good humor to receive 
food, and in sending the food down in such shape that 
it can be taken care of with ease. The pleasurable sen- 
sations from the sight, smell, and taste of food not only 
"make the mouth water," but the stomach also. Some 
foods stimulate a flow of gastric juice aside from any 
pleasant sensations they may produce, and are of great 
value when appetite fails or when for some other reason 
the stomach's responses to food in general are weak. 
Water is such a substance and can be taken a few minutes 



THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 35 

before or at the beginning of a meal with positive stimu- 
lating effect. The most efficient gastric stimulants are 
those substances which give flavor to meats ; hence the 
advantage of meat early in the meal when it is served, 
and the value of beginning a meal with soups contain- 
ing the extracts of meat, such as bouillon, consomme, 
and other kinds with meat stock as the foundation, 
when the stomach responses are feeble. Herein lies the 
chief value of beef broth for invalids ; but, since beef 
broth itself has little if any fuel value, it should be 
accompanied by some " real food," which it will help to 
digest. 

The general nervous state of the person is very quickly 
reflected in the stomach. "Laugh and grow fat" is a 
wise saw. Attention to the appearance of food on the 
table and other devices which tend to put the pro- 
spective eater in a happy frame of mind are worth while 
from this point of view. Excitement, worry, anger, chill, 
fatigue, all tend to retard the digestive processes and the 
greatest skill in the choice of easily digested food may 
be of no avail while these unfavorable states persist. 
If food must be taken under such conditions, it is best 
taken in some warm, rather dilute fluid form, such as 
soup, cocoa, malted milk, gruel, or a raw egg beaten up 
in milk. Next best is some very dry food which has to 
be moistened and softened in the mouth and reaches 
the stomach nearly fluid, such as toast crisp throughout, 
which may be accompanied by some finely minced, 
lightly cooked lean meat. 

Concentrated foods of various kinds are apt to prove 



36 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

irritating, especially to a sensitive stomach. Among 
such foods are cheese, candy, nuts, strongly acid fruits. 
These should be used in small amounts at a time, and in 
combination with bland foods which will dilute them, 
— crackers, bread or macaroni with cheese, candy 
only at the end of a meal (never on an empty stomach, 
as concentrated sugar is particularly irritating), nuts in 
small quantities along with other food less rich in fat 
and less concentrated, acid fruits very much diluted, as 
in lemonade or cherry tapioca. 

The rate, and hence often the comfort, of digestion is 
further influenced by the proportions of protein, fat, 
and carbohydrate eaten. Water passes through the 
stomach very quickly. Carbohydrates tend to pass out 
faster than proteins and proteins faster than fats. Mix- 
tures of protein and carbohydrate go faster than proteins 
alone, but more slowly than carbohydrates. Mixtures 
of fat and protein, on the other hand, go more slowly 
than either alone. This retarding effect of fat is an 
advantage or disadvantage according to circumstances. 
The healthy empty stomach tends to contract rhyth- 
mically, with more or less insistence, producing the 
" pangs of hunger." Its possessor, therefore, may find 
himself very uncomfortable between meals, complaining 
that his food does not "stay by him." He does not 
need a diet that relieves the stomach, but rather one 
which tends to require some time for digestion, and this 
can be accomplished by the use of more fat. Such a 
person can eat pork and beans, sausage, suet pudding, 
mince pie, and the like without discomfort, especially if 



THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 37 

leading an out-of-door life. A less vigorous person 
would find such foods delaying digestion unduly ; hence 
they are usually, and very properly, considered hard to 
digest. The same is true of other foods where a con- 
siderable amount of fat is intimately mixed with proteins 
or even with carbohydrates, such as fat meats, rich sauces, 
pastries, cakes. A good cook is not always the safest 
provider of the family food because of her tendency to 
load up all kinds of dishes with cream and butter. The 
taking of fat is less likely to be overdone if it is served by 
itself as butter for bread, or as thin cream for beverages 
and cereals, than when it is used liberally in the kitchen. 
Most people can eat large amounts of carbohydrate 
food with ease. Thus bread, in which eight- tenths of 
the Calories are in the form of carbohydrate, is the 
"staff of life." But there are persons in whose stomachs 
carbohydrates tend to ferment very easily, usually be- 
cause of bad mastication, little gastric acid, or poor mus- 
cular activity of the stomach. These need to eat less 
carbohydrate food than others and to rely more upon 
protein and simple forms of fat for fuel. As already 
pointed out, sugars ferment more readily and are liable 
to be more irritating than starchy foods, so that good 
results are often obtained merely by ruling out sugars 
and very sweet foods. At other times foods containing 
much cellulose, such as green vegetables, must be 
excluded because the cellulose tends to retard carbohy- 
drate digestion, unless it is removed through a strainer. 
Usually it is wise to enforce good mastication by the 
use of hard, dry breadstuff's. 



38 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Good stomach digestion depends, in general, upon 
keeping the whole body in good condition by breathing 
fresh pure air, taking suitable exercise, cultivating cheer- 
ful mental habits; observing regular mealtimes, and 
refraining from food at all other times ; avoiding 
food when greatly overwrought or exhausted, or lim- 
iting it to simple, warm, fluid foods; masticating 
thoroughly so that food never goes down in large lumps ; 
paying some regard to the retarding effect of fat on 
digestion; and avoiding large amounts of very con- 
centrated or irritating foods. 

Good Digestion in the Small Intestine 

Into the small intestine by spurts from the stomach 
comes material in various stages of digestion, mostly 
fluid, with small particles of insoluble or still undissolved 
substances floating in it. Here are enzymes greater in 
number and more powerful in action than anywhere else 
in the alimentary canal. The acid gastric juice sends a 
call to the pancreas through a special " chemical messen- 
ger " and out pours a fluid with enzymes for starch, pro- 
tein, and fat. From the walls of the intestine itself 
numbers of tiny glands supply a secretion containing 
enzymes for breaking up the last combinations, setting 
free amino acids from the larger protein fragments left 
by the other enzymes, and also dividing all the remain- 
ing double sugars into simple sugars. The bile flows into 
the intestine and makes conditions more favorable for 
these changes, especially helping in the digestion of fat. 

In the small intestine we find two systems of move- 



THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 39 

merits. By one the food is very thoroughly mixed with 
the digestive juices containing the enzymes, and brought 
into contact with the tiny fingerlike projections on the 
intestinal walls which absorb the digested materials and 
start them on their journey to the tissues that need them. 
By the other, the material is moved along from part to 
part, meeting fresh surfaces for absorption, and leaving 
less and less to be pushed into the large intestine. 

Good health in the small intestine is very quickly 
affected by conditions in the stomach. Hence it is for- 
tunate that the stomach is very sensitive to bad feeding 
and gives us warning of what we may be doing to the 
more important intestinal tube. Any nervous disturb- 
ance affecting the stomach is likely to be shared sym- 
pathetically by its neighbor. Anger, fear, and other 
painful emotions tend to stop digestion in all parts. 
Bacteria of various kinds thrive in the small intestine, 
and when food is not digested at the normal rate, are 
likely to seize it and devote it to their own nourishment. 
Thus carbohydrates tend to ferment, producing trouble- 
some gases and irritating acids ; and proteins to undergo 
putrefaction, with the formation of products which are 
more harmful than those formed by carbohydrates, 
producing, when absorbed into the system, the con- 
dition called " auto-intoxication. " Fermentation can be 
lessened by limiting carbohydrate food, and putrefaction 
reduced by limiting protein food ; the dangers of both 
can be avoided in part by care in mastication and choice 
of the form in which the food is taken, and in part by 
stimulating normal peristalsis in the intestine — the 



4 o FEEDING THE FAMILY 

movement which carries the food downward into the 
large intestine. This will be discussed in detail after a 
few words in regard to the large intestine. 

Good Digestion in the Large Intestine 

The large intestine serves in great measure as a recep- 
tacle in which the last portions of digested material may 
be sorted out from the waste which is to be eliminated 
as of no further use to the body. No digestive enzymes 
are furnished in its fluids ; no such vigorous mixing of 
food and digestive juices occurs as in the small intestine, 
though a slow backward movement in the part adjacent 
to the small intestine forces the material in this part 
back and forth to insure absorption of all that is useful. 
At intervals a vigorous downward push forces the waste 
onward and finally out of the body altogether. 

It is very important that these movements of large 
and small intestine, conveying material along the tract, 
be normal. If they are too rapid, digestion is left in- 
complete and the body loses valuable food material, as 
in diarrhea. If they are too slow, waste accumulates, 
mechanically irritating to the intestinal walls and to 
adjacent parts; bacteria prey upon the retained ma- 
terial, and ample opportunity is afforded for the absorp- 
tion of any poisons which they may produce, thus laying 
the foundations for bad complexions, headaches, sensa- 
tions of fatigue, irritation of the appendix, and other 
unpleasant conditions. 

The peristaltic movement of the large intestine tends 
to be hindered by many of the habits of civilized life. 



THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 41 

In the first place, the abdominal muscles are likely to 
have less exercise and hence to be less vigorous, partly 
because of less general physical activity and partly be- 
cause of more confining dress, particularly for women. 
In the second place, food is likely to be too highly refined. 
Some bulk is necessary for intestinal muscles to exer- 
cise against, and this is obtainable only by taking some 
indigestible material as part of the diet. Animals get 
ballast in the form of sand, or bones, or the woody parts 
of plants, and many of the natural foods of man contain 
considerable woody fiber, seeds, and other forms of 
cellulose. But by our modern milling processes we 
remove the bran from grains; in our market gardens 
we force vegetables so that their fiber is very deli- 
cate ; we discard seeds and rind of fruits, and thus make 
possible a diet almost free from ballast. 

Furthermore, modern transportation makes possible 
a very free choice of food. We are not dependent on a 
problematic catch of game or fish for meat ; we can have 
it every day and three times a day so long as we have 
money to buy it. Therefore we may unconsciously 
eliminate from the dietary or relegate to an insignificant 
place foods which have chemically a stimulating in- 
fluence upon the movements of the intestines, such as 
most fruits and acid vegetables. 

Finally, habit plays a large part in normal intestinal 
movement, as in other digestive processes. If the normal 
warning is disregarded, it soon becomes ineffective and 
recalling it becomes increasingly difficult. The greatest 
stimulus to intestinal movement comes immediately 



42 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

after taking food into the stomach and particularly after 
breakfast. Thus the omission of breakfast, common 
with some persons, may mean the loss of a much needed 
impulse. 

From these various causes, constipation is one of the 
recognized ills of modern life. One has only to notice 
advertisements of drugs in street cars and on billboards 
to realize this. But the taking of drugs is a poor sub- 
stitute for the normal control of the alimentary tract 
by diet, and is to be countenanced only when more 
hygienic measures fail. 

Diet for Constipation 

In endeavors to remedy or avoid constipation through 
diet, we may choose then : 

(i) Foods rich in cellulose, such as celery, cabbage, 
string beans, dried beans and lentils with their hulls, as- 
paragus, lettuce, spinach, onions, raisins, figs, prunes, and 
other fruits eaten with their skins, cereals from which the 
bran has not been removed, such as rolled or cut oats 
and wheat. When still more ballast is required, bran 
itself can be used in various ways, the pleasantest being 
as bran bread, muffins, or crackers. Another plant 
product which serves the same purpose is agar-agar 
or " vegetable gelatin." This is eaten simply cut into 
small pieces, along with or instead of some breakfast 
food, or it can be obtained in the form of wafers. It 
may also be made into biscuits ; boiled in water, flavored 
and cooled, it makes an edible jelly. 1 Successful results 

1 One-fourth ounce of agar-agar will solidify one quart of liquid. 



THE DIGESTIVE MECHANISM 43 

from the use of such foods depend largely upon taking 
a sufficient quantity and constantly including them 
in the diet. 

(2) Foods yielding vegetable acids, such as lemons, 
oranges, tomatoes, rhubarb, apples, cider, and other 
fruits and fruit juices (except blackberries, which are 
constipating). The acids are mild stimulants to intes- 
tinal movement and most people find fruit pleasant to 
take. The desired results are often gained by taking 
fruit or fruit juice the first thing in the morning. For 
persons of sensitive stomach, very mild fruit should be 
selected, or fruit juice diluted with water. Hot lemon- 
ade, prunes, or figs may be tried at bed time, if they do 
not cause discomfort. Liberal serving of fruit at meals 
has much to recommend it as a means of counteracting 
constipation. 

(3) Foods producing slight gas formation, such as 
honey, molasses, spinach, onions, cauliflower, and some 
others. These tend to ferment slightly; the gas gene- 
rated breaks up hard masses in the intestine and also 
acts as a slight stimulant to movement. Carbonated 
waters may bring about the same result through the gas 
with which they are charged. Honey and molasses are 
best taken with coarse breads. They must not be used 
too freely or they will disturb digestion. The vegetables 
may be effectively served as salads with an olive oil dress- 
ing, or simply cooked and seasoned with salt and butter. 

(4) A lubricant. For people whose digestion of fat is 
rather imperfect, fat in liberal quantities is often laxa- 
tive and such may be benefited by a tablespoonful or 



44 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

two of olive oil before breakfast and the last thing at 
night. For most people, however, the lubricating effect 
is lost through digestion of the fat and can only be secured 
by taking an indigestible mineral oil. Such substances 
do not actually stimulate intestinal movement, and only 
aid in the elimination of waste by making it softer and 
allowing it to pass along the tract more readily. If 
movement is very sluggish, the oil may slip through 
without carrying feces with it, in which case foods of the 
two types indicated above must also be used, or recourse 
had to drugs which specifically stimulate peristalsis, 
under the guidance of a physician. 

A large volume of water, two glasses or more, if taken 
on an empty stomach, will sometimes start intestinal 
peristalsis, but since water tends to be absorbed before it 
reaches the large intestine its action is rather uncertain, 
differing greatly with individuals. However, the drink- 
ing of water freely is desirable, as it helps to flush out the 
system and carry waste products off through the kidneys.

CHAPTER III 
FOOD FOR THE ADULT MAN 

A human being requires about twenty-five years to 
complete his growth. During this time he adds to his 
stature, gains in weight, and changes in physiological 
and mental habits. Then he enters upon a period, last- 
ing perhaps from a quarter to a third of a century, during 
which his body may maintain a fairly constant weight, 
and no marked changes occur in the nature of any of his 
body processes. He is now the fully built " working 
machine " and his first food requirement is adequate fuel 
for his varied activities. 

Some of the general principles governing choice of fuel 
have already been discussed in Chapter II. We are now 
concerned with the amount of fuel which will maintain 
the best working conditions. Underfeeding will weaken 
the body by causing it to draw upon its own substance 
for fuel ; overfeeding will result in the storage of an 
overload of fat, interfering with normal muscle action 
and making unnecessary weight to carry, or else it will 
tax the digestive and excretory systems to the point of 
injury. Ideal conditions exist when a man carries a 
normal weight for his height, and his daily intake of food 
corresponds closely to his daily expenditure of energy.

FOOD FOR THE ADULT MAN 47 

Energy Requirements of the Adult Man 

THE SEDENTARY MAN 

Studies of healthy adult men lying at rest in a respira- 
tion calorimeter, 1 after fifteen hours without food, show 
that in the work of maintaining their internal body 
processes (circulation, respiration, muscle tension, etc.) 
they expend about 0.45 Calories per pound per hour; 
that is, a man weighing 154 pounds and lying quietly in 
bed without food for twenty-four hours would draw upon 
the tissues of his body for fuel to the extent of about 
1665 Calories. From this fundamental or "basal" require- 
ment there is no escape while normal life processes go 
on. If food be taken to make good this loss, the in- 
fluence of food itself (often called the "work of diges- 
tion") must be taken into account in making up the 
balance. This will add about 10 per cent to the total 
heat production, so that his expenditure will be about 
one-half Calorie per pound per hour, or 1850 Calories 
for the whole day. Every movement of hand or 
foot, all the muscular work involved in raising and 
keeping the body in a sitting or standing position, or 
in performing the varied activities of daily life, will 
make definite increases in the energy output, all of 
which have been carefully measured in scientific labo- 
ratories. 

Sitting quietly in a chair, with only the movements 
usually incident to sedentary living, such as changes of 
posture, movements in reading, writing, or talking, will 

1 See page 15. 



48 



FEEDING THE FAMILY 



make the total fuel cost per hour about three-fifths of a 
Calorie per pound. Hence a man of average weight, 
spending eight hours in bed and sixteen hours in a chair, 
will need a daily total food supply of approximately 
2100 Calories. 

Standing involves more energy than sitting, raising 
the energy expenditure to about three-fourths of a 
Calorie per pound per hour, while walking on a level 
road at a rate of some three miles an hour, or other light 
exercise incident to ordinary life, calls for about one 
Calorie per pound per hour. The day's energy require- 
ment of a man of sedentary habits may then be esti- 
mated as follows :

Studies of food requirements of sedentary men of 
various occupations, as, for instance, writers, draughts- 
men, teachers, bookkeepers, shoemakers, tailors, phy- 
sicians, and others who sit at their desks or watch ma- 
chinery show that they tend to require from 2200 to 
2800 Calories per day, as they vary somewhat in weight 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT MAN 49 

and activity. It is possible to supply this amount of 
fuel in the form of cereals, beans, pork, bread and 
butterine, with hot coffee and milk, for from 10 to 
15 cents a day, or from two-fifths to one-half a cent per 
100 Calories. 1 Reference to Table IV, showing costs 
per 100 Calories of some common foods, will make it 
clear, however, that the range of foods which can be 
used in a dietary costing less than three-quarters of a 
cent per 100 Calories is quite limited. Men prefer a 
more varied diet and it is easier to secure all the elements 
for good nutrition, including good digestion, if it is pos- 
sible to spend somewhat more for food. The following 
food plan is suggested as a working basis for the selection 
of the diet of a sedentary man, when the money allow- 
ance is liberal. The cost estimate is based on New 
York City prices, and in many regions, where meats, 
milk, fresh fruits, and vegetables are cheaper, the food 
could be obtained for less. Such a plan will give a diet 
adequate in all respects and sufficiently easy of digestion 
for the ordinary sedentary person. 

The dietaries worked out from this food plan (pp. 52, 
53) show in detail how the following of such a scheme 
will insure a well-balanced ration. 2 

1 The average for such men is often taken as 2500 Calories per day, and 
a very interesting publication by Gephart and Lusk on the "Analysis 
and Cost of Ready to Serve Foods," as found in Childs' Restaurants in 
New York City, gives the cost of 2500 Calories in foods arranged in order 
of their increasing price. This includes the cost of preparation, service, 
and business profits, while the estimates in this book are merely for raw 
food materials, prepared and eaten with the minimum of waste. 

2 Many of the recipes used in the menu in this and following dietaries 
are given in the Appendix, Table III.

THE MUSCULARLY ACTIVE MAN 

Muscular activity greatly increases an individual's 
total energy requirement. The sedentary occupations 
demand little more food than would be needed if the 
person were sitting at rest, though it would be better 
for sedentary persons to take some vigorous exercise 
each day for the sake of their general health and increase 
their food intake accordingly. This is particularly true 
of brain workers and all whose work involves nervous 
rather than muscular tension. 

Muscular work is usually graded as " light," " moder- 
ate," " active," or "severe," light exercise being such as 
that incident to sedentary occupations and not much 
more vigorous than walking at a moderate pace along a 
level road, and requiring about one Calorie per pound of 
body weight per hour. "Moderate" exercise is typical 
of occupations which involve active use of some parts of

the body while sitting, standing, or walking, as in the 
case of carpenters, mail carriers, house workers, and 
others. Such exercise means an expenditure of from 
one and one-fourth to one and one-half Calories per 
pound per hour during working hours, and a daily total 
for men of average size in such occupations of from 2700 
to 3000 Calories. 

" Active " exercise is sufficiently great to develop 
muscular strength, as in farmers, masons, and black- 
smiths, and requires during active working hours an 
expenditure of from one and three-fourths to two 
Calories per pound per hour, or approximately 3500 
Calories per day. " Severe'' exercise indicates very 
heavy muscular work, such as that done by lumber- 
men, excavators, and stevedores, and calls for fuel 
equal to as much as three Calories per pound per 
hour during work, so that the total day's food require- 
ment for such men often reaches 4000 and may reach 
6000 Calories. 

The changes in energy requirement due to differences 
in activity may be summarized as follows :

as fried cereal foods, sausage, pork and beans, suet 
pudding, and pie, may be taken without detriment. 
These have the advantage, too, of raising the total fuel 
value of the diet without greatly increasing the volume

Thin and Fat Men 

THIN MEN 

In case men are extremely thin or fat, some variation 
from the general rule of feeding according to age and 
weight is necessary. Thin men usually have more muscle 
in proportion to weight than fat men, and they also have 
more surface exposed, both of which facts increase their 
need for fuel somewhat. A store of body fat is de- 
sirable as reserve fuel for emergencies, as evidence 
of a well-nourished body which is more resistant to 
disease, and as protection against jars and bruises, 
This reserve can only be gained by taking food in excess 
of daily fuel needs. Tables showing what normal men 
of different ages and height should weigh may be con- 
sulted with profit and are for convenience included in 
the Appendix. Since food is the only source of body 
substance, persistent overfeeding is the only way to 
gain in weight. Change of climate, outdoor living, and 
other devices which increase appetite are aids in taking 
sufficient food, but much can be accomplished under 
ordinary living conditions by conscious effort to take 
more fuel. Simple foods which do not upset digestion 
are best. Liberal use of butter, cream and bacon, and 
the taking of from one to two tablespoons of olive oil 
after each meal, are practical ways of increasing the fuel 
value of the diet. Vegetables can be served with cream 
sauces, or as salads with mayonnaise, French, or cream 
dressings ; milk enriched with cream, cocoa and choco- 
late made with milk, or tea and coffee with cream 
and sugar liberally used are comparatively easy to 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT MAN 



59 



take. Custards and creams of various kinds are valu- 
able means of adding to the fuel value of the meal. 
Meat is best used in moderation.

FAT MEN 

A fat man requires less fuel in proportion to his weight 
than an ordinary man. Fat represents "dead weight." 
The actual amount of muscle may be no more (even less) 
than in another man who tips the scales at a lower figure. 
As men grow older they tend to less and less muscular 
exertion and yet their appetites often continue keen, so 
that they keep up eating habits formed in more active 
years, with the result that they steadily take in more 
fuel than they use up, and gradually increase in weight. 
Too much fat is a disadvantage, as it is apt to interfere 
with the healthy play of the muscles, causing them to 
deteriorate, and laying the foundation for troubles with 
the heart. Excessively fat people also seem predisposed 
toward gout and obesity. It is usually much easier to 
keep the weight from becoming excessive than to reduce 
fat after it has been stored. Hence it should be borne 
in mind that persistent gain in weight in a healthy per- 
son means that he has been overeating and he should 
make consistent efforts to lower his food intake. In- 
creasing exercise will help to burn off fat, but is likely 
to stimulate the appetite, so that accurate measurement 
and systematic limitation of the fuel value of the diet is 
necessary. 

Foods very high in fuel value, i.e., fats and dishes 
containing much fat, should be avoided and bulky foods 
of low fuel value used to satisfy the eager appetite. 
Even then considerable self-denial is usually necessary to 
achieve success. Clear soups should take the place of

Green vegetables of all kinds, raw or plainly cooked, 
such as cabbage, celery, lettuce, spinach, asparagus, 
cauliflower, can be freely eaten. Bread, cereals, pota- 
toes, and other starchy foods should be taken in small 
quantities and can often be omitted. Fresh fruits 
should be substituted for puddings, cakes, and pies. 
Lean meats, simply cooked, may be used liberally if 
plenty of green vegetables be also included in the diet. 

Building Material for the Adult Man 

When a steam engine transforms the energy of coal 
into useful work, about nine-tenths of the total amount 
of energy present in the fuel will be unavoidably con- 
verted into heat and dissipated into the surrounding 
atmosphere, and only one-tenth actually transformed 
into useful work. In the finest motors the skill of the 
designer has succeeded in reducing this inevitable loss 
of potential working power to about seven-tenths. Man 
is a much more efficient machine than the ordinary 
engine, being able to convert up to a third of his energy 
into muscular activity when well trained to his work 
(very commonly as much as one-fifth) and also utilizing 
the heat which is a by-product of his activities to keep 
up his body temperature. Man can also do his work 
with comparatively little wear and tear on the body 
itself, provided he treats it with the same care that 
would be given to any other high grade machine — 
supplies fuel in suitable forms and amounts, keeps within 
the limits of its work capacity, and sees that it is well oiled 
(furnished with regulating materials) and clear of waste. 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT MAN 63 

Nevertheless, as we have seen in Chapter I, it is a 
law of life that some old material shall constantly be 
replaced by new, and we must take into account a daily 
loss from the body of substances entering into its inti- 
mate structure or serving to modify and control its 
processes, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and cal- 
cium. We must find out how the diet is to compensate 
for such depletions. 

THE PROTEIN OR NITROGEN REQUIREMENT 

During much of the nineteenth century biological 
chemistry was dominated by the ideas of the great 
organic chemist, Liebig. He thought muscular work 
to be performed at the expense of the muscle itself, and 
taught that the only way to maintain muscular strength 
was to eat protein food, and especially that as much like 
the body protein as possible, namely, meat. But near 
the middle of the century this idea was subjected to 
scientific investigation, and convincing, though crude, 
proof adduced to show that a man doing a day's work 
without protein food would by no means burn enough 
of his body protein to account for the work done ; in 
fact, would burn scarcely more than if he had not been 
working at all. It became apparent, therefore, that fats 
and carbohydrates were the main source of muscular 
energy, a fact fully demonstrated before the opening 
of the twentieth century. 

If a diet be ample in fuel, chiefly as carbohydrate and 
fat, the loss of protein for each individual in health 
proceeds quite uniformly, whether his life be active or 



64 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

quiet. Muscles do not " break down" in exercise; 
rather they tend to "build up," or increase in size and 
strength, and thus to store protein in their own struc- 
ture rather than to use up what they have. Accord- 
ingly, the actual requirement for protein in the diet is 
comparatively independent of the amount of physical 
exertion, and remains fairly constant whether the indi- 
vidual be leading the sedentary life of an office or the 
strenuous life of outdoor work on the farm or in the 
lumber camp. The requirement for fuel, on the other 
hand, will vary tremendously with the kind and amount 
of work, as previously shown. 

The fact that protein food is both a fuel and a build- 
ing material makes its place in the diet confusing. 
When burned for fuel, the nitrogen in its constitution is 
gotten rid of as speedily as possible, beginning to appear 
in the urine within an hour or two after a meal, and the 
non-nitrogenous fragments then burn like carbohydrate 
or fat. When protein is used for building material, the 
nitrogen is retained in the body to help form new body 
protein. There is, however, no provision for storing a 
surplus against a rainy day. What is not needed is 
excreted and that for future use must come from future 
food. It is possible to take the whole day's fuel in the 
form of protein food, lean beef, for instance. A man 
requiring 3000 Calories would have to eat nearly five 
pounds and would get eight or nine times as much pro- 
tein as actually needed to keep up his body protein. 
Since protein food is expensive, this would be uneco- 
nomical, if not harmful. By substituting carbohydrate 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT MAN 65 

or fat and carbohydrate, as potatoes, bread, butter, and 
the like, for part of the protein, a much more satisfac- 
tory diet can be arranged. 

In scientific laboratories detailed experiments have 
been made to try to establish the ideal proportion of 
protein in the diet, and with plenty of fuel it is found 
that the protein will be used very economically. At the 
same time, protein is good fuel itself, and there is no 
reason for restricting one's intake to the minimum, 
under ordinary circumstances. For a man of average 
weight, from two to two and one-half protein Calories 
per pound of body weight will adequately protect the 
body against protein starvation and leave some surplus 
to be burned as fuel. 

Where strict economy must be practiced, it is well to 
remember that adequate fuel is the first requisite for 
good nutrition, and the use of protein simply for fuel is 
extravagant. On the other hand, many protein foods 
are easy to digest, and when economic conditions do not 
forbid may be used more freely. There are limits, how- 
ever, beyond which it does not seem wise to go. When 
a very large proportion of the day's fuel is protein 
material there is produced in the body a kind of stimu- 
lation which results in an increased production of body 
heat. This is of no advantage so far as we know, except 
when a person is exposed to cold, and can utilize this 
heat to maintain his body temperature instead of gener- 
ating more by shivering or more active muscular activity. 
In extremely cold climates or in severe winter weather 
in temperate regions, a liberal supply of protein in the 



66 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

diet may promote physical comfort. On the other hand, 
in hot weather, especially with much humidity, dissipa- 
tion of heat which the body is inevitably generating 
becomes difficult, and an extra supply of heat arising 
from a large amount of protein in the diet simply in- 
creases the difficulty of keeping comfortable, and may 
be a real menace to health. Furthermore, individuals 
differ in the ease with which they get rid of the surplus 
nitrogen. Sometimes large amounts of protein food, 
especially meats, tend to increase intestinal putrefaction 
and bring on a whole train of unfavorable symptoms; 
sometimes the kidneys' powers are overtaxed, and cer- 
tain forms of nitrogen tend to accumulate in the body 
to its disadvantage. For such reasons, a moderate 
supply of protein, covering fully the needs for nitrogen, 
but not serving as the chief source of fuel, will produce 
the best results. 

It is often convenient to express this in terms of the 
total day's fuel. An allowance of two Calories per 
pound for a man of average weight means about 300 
Calories per day. If his total energy requirement is 
3000 Calories, this means approximately 10 per cent of 
his fuel in the form of protein; if the total is 2500 
Calories, 12 per cent in the form of protein. Two and 
one-half Calories per pound for a man consuming 3000 
Calories would mean about 15 per cent of his fuel as 
protein. A higher proportion results in more loss of 
heat from the stimulating power of protein, so that in 
general the body needs seem best met by supplying from 
10 to 15 per cent of the total fuel in the form of protein, 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT MAN 67 

except when a man is in bed, in which case care should 
be taken that he has at least two protein Calories per 
pound. By reference to the dietaries already given * it 
will be seen that the protein supply falls within the limits 
suggested here. 

Liebig's notion that meat is a peculiar source of body 
strength having caught the popular fancy, and agreeing 
well with the food preferences of many, it has been 
slow in giving way to newer conceptions of the place of 
protein in nutrition, and many spend money in main- 
taining a traditionally high amount of meat in the diet 
who might be using their money to better advantage 
and perhaps securing better health. The regard in 
which meat is held is probably largely due to its peculiar 
texture and to certain substances found in its juices 
which give it a pronounced and agreeable flavor and 
exert a stimulating effect upon appetite and digestion. 
Meat agrees with the lazy eater who bolts his food, 
because it does not require mixing with saliva, being 
dissolved by the gastric juice of the stomach even if 
swallowed in comparatively large pieces. 

As regards satisfying real body needs, meat proteins 
are by no means superior to all others. In fact, the 
proteins provided by nature for building body protein, 
as in the growth of the young, are found in milk and 
eggs. The value of milk as a source of protein for growth 
has already been pointed out. Meat has certain dis- 
advantages as the sole or chief protein food of the diet. 
Associated more or less intimately with the protein of 
1 See pages 52, 53, 57, 59, and 61. 



68 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

meat we find certain substances called "purins," to 
which, in part, the flavor is due. These purins are not 
nutritious, but are gradually transformed in the body 
to uric acid, to be carried off as waste in the urine. Per- 
sons inclined to gout have difficulty in getting rid of 
uric acid, and the more meat they eat the more uric acid 
tends to accumulate in the system, circulating in the 
blood and depositing in the joints. If protein is taken 
in moderation and chiefly from eggs, milk, cheese, bread, 
and nuts, which contain no purins, dangers of this diffi- 
culty may be avoided. Meat proteins are also particu- 
larly liable to intestinal putrefaction, while milk not only 
is less liable to this kind of decomposition, but actually 
helps to decrease the number of putrefactive bacteria in 
the intestines. For persons of indoor sedentary life a 
very liberal use of meat is certainly undesirable. Even 
athletes, for whom meat was once thought especially 
necessary, have demonstrated the possibility of reducing 
their daily consumption to one-sixth the amount which 
the training table previously provided, with an actual 
increase in their capacity for endurance. Aside from 
questions of health the economic advantages of some 
other protein foods over meat are easily demonstrated. 

By reference to the table on page 21 * it will be seen 
that 100 Calories of lean round of beef will yield 54.5 
protein Calories. Six portions will, therefore, supply 
327 protein Calories, enough protein for an average-sized 
man for a day. But these 600 Calories will cost 24 
cents (with beef at 28 cents a pound in the market) and 

1 Protein in 100- Calorie portions. 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT MAN 69 

if his fuel requirement is 3000 Calories, 2400 must still 
be bought to make up the day's total. If milk be selected, 
it will take 17 portions, costing 22.6 cents (with milk at 
9 cents per quart), but leaving only 1300 Calories to be 
obtained from other sources. If eggs are chosen, 9 por- 
tions will be required, costing 22.5 cents (with eggs at 
25 cents a dozen), but requiring only 2100 Calories to 
supplement those from protein. Milk and eggs are not 
only adequate substitutes for meat, but they carry in 
addition valuable ash constituents which would have 
to be added to the meat ration to make it equally valu- 
able with either of the other two. The housewife who 
provides a somewhat varied diet, ample in fuel value, 
including milk and eggs, need not feel that she is depriv- 
ing her family of any essential if she furnishes a very 
small amount of meat or none at all. One-fourth of a 
pound a day as an average for each adult man will 
provide approximately one-third of his protein require- 
ment; bread, cereals, fruit and green vegetables will 
furnish another third ; and the remainder can be obtained 
with little difficulty from a glass of milk, an egg, some 
cheese, beans, or nuts. 

THE ASH REQUIREMENT 

Attention has already been called in Chapter 1 1 to 
the importance of the ash constituents of food — how 
they enter into the structure of the skeleton and the soft 
tissues, and take a prominent part in the maintenance of 
life and health through the regulation of body processes. 
1 See pages 21-25.

FEEDING THE FAMILY 



The results of ash starvation would not be manifested 
so quickly as those of deprivation of water, fuel, or pro- 
tein (nitrogen) because the amounts lost daily are small 
and in an adult the reserves in the body are compara- 
tively great. Nevertheless, the ash supply is worthy of 
consideration in any food. Studies of what men actually 
do eat reveal that the elements most likely to be taken 
in too small amounts for a good daily balance are phos- 
phorus, calcium, and iron. A comparison of a reason- 
able supply of these elements for an adult with the 
amounts furnished by several combinations of food other- 
wise very excellent will show how ash-bearing foods 
might be neglected (i and 2 below), and how introducing 
a single change will improve such food combinations 
(3 and 4 below). The quantities per day believed to be 
adequate for an average healthy man are as follows : 

Phosphoric acid 2.75 grams 

Calcium oxide 0.70 gram 

Iron 0.015 gram 

(1) A ration of lean meat, white bread, and butter 
would be ample in protein and total fuel, but conspicu- 
ously deficient in calcium.

In the probability of satisfying the ash requirement 
lies one advantage of a mixed diet. If some foods 
known to be rich in iron, calcium, and phosphorus are 
included each day, one may rest assured that the ash 
constituents will be adequately provided for, without 
detailed calculations like those on pages 70 and 71. Milk 
is the most valuable source of calcium ; a single 100 
Calories will supply one-third of the day's requirement. 
Other valuable sources are indicated in the table on 
page 24. 1 One portion of milk will also supply one-ninth 
of the day's phosphorus requirement. Eggs (especially 
the yolk), cereals from whole grains, lean meat, dried peas 
and beans, are desirable for their phosphorus content. 
(See table, page 2 2). 2 With the exception of milk, 
the foods just named and fruits and green vegetables are 
rich sources of iron. (See table, page 23). 3 A large 
serving of spinach will of itself supply one-third of the 
day's iron requirement. 

With a little knowledge, it is not necessary to have 
elaborate cookery or many kinds of food to keep a man 
well nourished. As indicated above, so simple a ration 
as milk and graham bread will furnish all the essentials 
of a well-balanced diet, provided some or all of the milk 
is uncooked, to secure those " accessory food sub- 
stances," 4 which in milk are affected unfavorably by 
high temperature. The amount of waste to make

ballast for the intestines is not very large; it could be 
increased by the addition of fresh fruit, such as apples 
or oranges, or of some green vegetable like radishes or 
onions. The bread-butter-beef-milk diet is not quite 
so ideal from the point of view of counteracting consti- 
pation, and needs even more the addition of some coarse 
material. Changes in the kind of bread (or use of equiv- 
alent fuel in the form of cereals and potatoes) and in 
the kind of meat and fruit will give that variety which 
maintains good appetite. Warm food usually adds to 
the ease with which a meal is digested, and often to its 
relish. Any one trying to live on a rather monotonous 
diet finds that soup, tea or coffee, "help one to eat 
bread. " Whether tea and coffee add to the food value 
of the diet or not depends chiefly upon how much milk 
(or cream) and sugar are taken in them. 



CHAPTER IV 
FOOD FOR THE ADULT WOMAN 

Energy Requirement 

However much civilization may tend to empha- 
size certain physiological and psychological differences 
between men and women, when we come to study 
their essential food needs we find that the laws of 
energy exchange are practically the same for both sexes. 
Respiration, circulation, digestion, and muscular ten- 
sion, — all forms of internal body work, — demand their 
daily quota of fuel; the larger the body, the more 
fuel required to run it; the more external work done 
by the human machine, the more fuel demanded for 
this purpose. 

In actual comparisons between living men and women, 
we recognize that men as a class are larger and heavier 
than women ; they also tend to have a higher muscular 
development and to carry on more severe muscular 
work ; wherefore the common notion that men as a rule . 
eat more than women is true. But when we compare 
men and women of the same height and weight, lying 
at rest so that differences in external activity are ex- 

74 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT WOMAN 



75 



eluded, we find them requiring about the same number 
of Calories, the differences being no greater than between 
athletically developed and ordinary men, or between 
tall and muscular men as compared with short and fat 
men. Women as a class tend to have more body fat in 
proportion to their weight, which reduces the amount 
of active working muscle. If a man and a woman do 
the same kind and amount of work, the expenditure of 
energy to accomplish the task will be as great for the 
woman as for the man. We shall not fall into any 
serious error then in applying to women the same 
table already used for calculating the fuel requirements 
of men.

The daily requirement for the average woman in some of

Women's appetites tend to be more fickle than men's, 
perhaps partly due to the fact that in the past they have 
not had very high ideals of health and have not made 
themselves lead such lives as to produce good steady 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT WOMAN 77 

appetites. They have stayed too much indoors, taken too 
little systematic exercise, and been confined too closely to 
one environment, to get that nervous and muscular poise 
which brings good tone to the alimentary tract and hence 
a healthy appetite. With the general improvement in the 
health of women, which is already remarked by careful 
observers, we are getting far from the " ladylike" notion 
of Janice Meredith and her kind that it would be a dis- 
grace to let a man see one really relish food, and are rec- 
ognizing the inevitable connection between the machine 
and its source of energy. Eating is primarily a duty ; na- 
ture has graciously made it also a physiological and social 
pleasure for most people ; but whether she has or not, the 
duty remains, and science steps in to guide when the 
palate fails as a monitor of health. For women perhaps 
more than for men is appetite apt to be perverted and a 
knowledge of food values of constant practical use. 

The following food plans and dietaries are suggestive

FOOD FOR THE ADULT WOMAN 83 

Thin and Fat Women 

FAT WOMEN 

To eat out of proportion to one's need, either on the 
side of meagerness or superfluity, is culpable. Tables 
of normal weight for age and height should be consulted 
and effort made to maintain an approximately normal 
weight. 1 If ordinary eating habits result in this, as they 
should, we may rest assured that the diet is satisfactory 
as to quantity of fuel ; if not, some attention should be 
given to the matter. The tendency to take on extra 
fat is apparently greater in women than men, and should 
be especially watched if hereditary. The only sure and 
healthful way to prevent it is to be abstemious in food. 
A pound of body fat means the storage of some 4000 
Calories. The time to adjust the diet is when the tend- 
ency to store fat begins to appear. Once a great excess 
has accumulated, the problem of its removal without 
harm becomes more complicated ; and extensive " reduc- 
ing" should be carried on only under the supervision of a 
physician who can regulate the rate of fat loss according 
to the general health. But in the early stages of grow- 
ing fat, careful weighing of food or " counting the Calo- 
ries" will prove effectual and safe, but must be per- 
sisted in, perhaps throughout life. Suggestions in re- 
gard to the choice of food have already been given 
in Chapter III, but a dietary whose total fuel value 
is more likely to meet a woman's requirements is given 
below.

FOOD FOR THE ADULT WOMAN 85 

THIN WOMEN 

Women of nervous temperament are apt to be too 
thin. They expend much energy in heightened mus- 
cular tension, and nervous disturbances quickly react on 
the alimentary tract, making it difficult to take or digest 
sufficient food. Only an intelligent persistence in taking 
regularly a supply of food in excess of immediate needs 
will result in a gain of weight. The removal, as far as 
possible, of nervous excitement or irritation and avoid- 
ance of great muscular exertion, limiting exercise to the 
lighter forms, are great helps in adjusting the balance 
between intake and outgo of energy. Food must be 
taken regardless of appetite, and often also regardless 
of minor digestive disturbances, for these do not neces- 
sarily signify that food is not going to be utilized finally. 
At the same time it is wise to choose food which can be 
taken without repugnance and which will digest with 
the greatest ease. Fluid foods are most easily taken 
when appetite fails, and make practical additions to the 
usual diet. Milk, which is so valuable a food, can be 
taken in many forms : hot, cold, with added cream 
or milk sugar, or both ; in cocoa and chocolate ; in sher- 
bets and ice creams ; as buttermilk, zoolak or kumiss ; 
so that it is one of the easiest foods to add to the diet. 
Fruit juices from sweet fruits, or with their fuel value 
artificially increased by the addition of milk sugar, make 
agreeable and nutritious beverages. 1 Raw eggs are 
easily swallowed and give a good return for the effort

86 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

made, whether taken plain or modified by being beaten 
up with milk, cream, or fruit juice. A little study of 
food values should make it possible to find acceptable 
ways of increasing the fuel intake. Three glasses of 
milk, added to the regular diet, will mean an increase of 
500 or more Calories; an extra pat of butter taken at 
each meal will add 300 Calories. From one to three 
tablespoons of olive oil may be taken after each meal, 
increasing the fuel intake from 300 to 900 Calories. 
Very often the easiest way to increase the food intake 
is by one or two additional meals, e.g., mid-morning and 
mid-afternoon lunches, or a morning lunch and a glass 
of milk or other nourishing beverage just before going 
to bed. This is especially true for women whose work 
is exhausting, so that they come to their regular meals 
"too tired to eat." It is hard to fatten an overworked 
person, but even a slight surplus over immediate needs, 
if persistently taken, will in time have its favorable effect 
on the general health and especially on the nervous 
system. To get the best results, considerable increases 
in the food intake should be maintained, with just 
enough exercise to promote a good appetite. One ex- 
ample of a fattening diet has already been given ; * 
another, approximating a little more closely the average 
requirement of a woman, is presented on the next page. 

The Protein and Ash Requirement 

Just as the laws which control energy requirement 
operate in the same way for women as for men, so the

requirements for protein and ash differ little for the two 
sexes under ordinary conditions. A woman requiring 
eight-tenths as much fuel as a man will probably need 
eight-tenths as much calcium and phosphorus and from 
two to two and one-half protein Calories per pound. 
She will probably need more iron because of the extra 
loss of this element in menstruation. Hence it is wise 
to see that the iron-bearing foods are supplied liberally. 
Fortunately salads of green vegetables and fruits are well 
liked by most women and constitute an easy way of 
introducing iron into the diet. 1 

Food for the Prospective Mother 

Traditions in regard to food have a strong hold on 
the imagination in connection with those periods during 
which the unborn child or nursing infant derives its 
sustenance directly from its mother. Stuffing when 
food needs are not greatly increased, attributing mys- 
terious influences to specific food materials, and supply- 
ing inadequate fuel when food needs are really very much 
increased are common errors due to lack of knowledge 
of the fate and function of foods. 

It is reassuring for the prospective mother to remem- 
ber that all food is broken down in the chemical processes 
of digestion and reorganized in the body according to 
its needs. Meat helps to build muscle, not because it is 
already in that form, but because when digested it 
yields amino acids (page 19) which the body can recom- 

1 See discussion of phosphorous, calcium, and iron contents of foods, 
pages 21-25. 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT WOMAN 89 

bine into its own kinds of protein ; the proteins of milk 
and eggs, and many of the proteins of vegetables will 
yield exactly the same kind of amino acids and hence 
serve equally well for constructing new muscle. Nature 
tries to promote normal development of the offspring 
even under adverse conditions; if materials for the 
growth of the baby are lacking in the food they will be 
drawn as far as possible from the mother's body. Thus 
if the diet be deficient in calcium and phosphorus for 
bone formation the mother's bones and teeth are likely 
to be the first to suffer loss, though, of course, a great 
scarcity is eventually likely to affect the baby. 

For the most part, the same kinds of food which are 
well adapted to the mother under ordinary conditions 
will serve for the mother and child. Simple dishes, 
prepared from easily digested foods, should be adhered 
to for the sake of good digestion, without which any food 
will fail of its purpose. When the digestive tract is 
particularly irritable, considerable care must be exer- 
cised in this respect, bearing in mind that fatigue, anx- 
iety, and constipation may be large factors in indiges- 
tion. The majority of mothers suffer in the early 
stages of gestation from nutritional disturbances fa- 
miliarly spoken of as " morning sickness." The cause 
of the nausea and vomiting at this time is not in the 
stomach itself, but is due to the fact that the connec- 
tion between the mother and the embryo through the 
placenta is not yet perfectly established, and a mild 
form of poisoning results from substances produced in 
the process of placenta formation getting into the general 



90 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

circulation. The disappearance of the morning sick- 
ness is an indication that the connection between mother 
and child which secures nourishment for the embryo 
from the mother's blood has been fully established, and 
from this time on the mother's appetite should steadily 
improve. Any special food requirements on the part 
of the developing child before the end of the fourth 
month of gestation have been shown to be practically 
negligible. Beginning with the fifth month, growth is 
increasingly rapid up to the time of birth, but the actual 
amount of building material needed day by day is not 
very large, nor even in the last weeks will the energy 
demands be increased more than 20 per cent, or one- 
fifth of the mother's usual daily supply. A woman 
of sedentary habits will then need from 2400 to 2800 
Calories per day, while a woman who is usually active 
will probably be somewhat less so, and is seldom likely 
to require over 3000 Calories. The increased require- 
ments for building material will be best met by the 
liberal use of milk and eggs, supplemented by fruit and 
green vegetables. Frequent small meals are often util- 
ized to better advantage than a few large meals in the last 
two or three months ; in fact, most of the suggestions 
which have already been given in regard to a fattening diet 
will be helpful in adjusting the food intake at this time. 

The day's diet should include : 

1. A cereal made from the whole grain, as rolled or 
cracked oats or wheat, wheatena, barley, puffed wheat ; 
these to be served as breakfast cereals thoroughly cooked, 
or in simple puddings. 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT WOMAN 91 

2. Milk, from a pint to a quart or more per day. 
This may be used as a beverage with meals, or between 
meals, or employed in making cocoa, custards, and other 
dishes. Sweet milk may be replaced by buttermilk, zoo- 
lak, malted milk, kumiss, etc., according to preference. 

3. Fruit, as oranges, apples, prunes, raisins, figs, 
dates, or other easily digested kinds, fresh or dried, 
cooked or raw. Fruit juices may be substituted for the 
whole fruit, especially where digestion is disturbed. 

4. A green vegetable, as spinach, peas, beans, lettuce, 
celery, cabbage, onions, etc. These may be served as 
salads, buttered, creamed, or in soups. When cooked, 
the cooking water should be used if possible, because it 
contains a large part of the ash constituents. Pea and 
spinach soups made with milk are often useful when 
digestion is poor. 

5. Meat, fish, or some substitute such as eggs or 
cheese, once a day. 

6. Butter, olive oil, bacon, peanut butter, or oleo- 
margarine in moderate quantities to add to the fuel 
value of the diet. For the sake of ease of digestion, 
these are best used in their simplest form, on bread, with 
potatoes, rice and the like, rather than in the making of 
rich sauces and gravies. The food plan already given 
for a sedentary woman can easily be modified to yield 
2700 to 2800 Calories by adding a pint of milk, a couple 
of eggs, two small tablespoons of butter, and a piece 
of sweet chocolate. The food plan and dietary for an 
active woman will be suitable when digestion is good,

Food for the Nursing Mother 

It has been shown by calorimetric experiments that 
the total energy requirement of mother and child just 
after birth is almost exactly the same as the total re- 
quirement just before birth. But the normal healthy 
baby grows rapidly and makes increasing demands upon 
his food supply. A baby a month old will take, on the 
average, two and one-third ounces of mothers milk per 
day for each pound of body weight, a twelve-pound child 
thus receiving about 28 ounces of milk in twenty-four 
hours. Since an ounce of mother's milk yields on the 
average 20 Calories, the total day's fuel supply for such 



94 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

a child will be 560 Calories. But making milk is hard 
work ; it is believed that about two Calories of extra food 
are necessary to produce one of milk, so that the 'above 
daily milk supply will demand an addition of some 1 1 20 
Calories to the mother's ordinary energy intake, or in 
general we may make the following estimates of the 
increased requirement : 

Additional fuel requirements for nursing a baby 

First 3 months . . 90 Calories per pound of infant's weight 

Second 3 months . 85 Calories per pound of infant's weight 

Third 3 months . . 80 Calories per pound of infant's weight 

Fourth 3 months . 70 Calories per pound of infant's weight 

This means that a woman of average weight and 
sedentary occupation will require while nursing a baby 
as much food as a laboring man doing moderately heavy 
muscular work, i.e., 3000 to 3500 Calories per day; 
while a woman at the same time employed in moder- 
ately active physical labor will need as much as a man 
doing severe muscular work, or from 3500 to 4000 
Calories per day. 

Not only is there this marked increase in the energy 
requirement, but the construction of milk demands 
extra quantities of such important materials as protein, 
calcium, phosphorus, and even iron. Studies with cows 
show that the efficiency of milk protein for the produc- 
tion of a new milk supply is about 60 per cent. Such 
data indicate that the mixed diet ought to supply at 
least two protein Calories for each one withdrawn in the 
mother's milk, and milk itself must be considered one 



FOOD FOR THE ADULT WOMAN 95 

of the most desirable foods for milk production. On 
this basis, from three to four protein Calories should be 
allowed for every ounce of milk produced. 

For a woman supplying 28 ounces of milk per day, 
there should be an increase over the average consump- 
tion of 17 per cent in iron, 20 per cent in phosphoric 
acid, and 76 per cent in calcium oxide. In other words, 
the most marked increase as regards ash is in the calcium 
requirement. This again is most easily met by milk, 
and also most economically, considering that milk sup- 
plies at the same time efficiently used protein. Two 
hundred Calories of milk in addition to the ordinary 
mixed diet will cover the extra requirement for calcium 
and phosphorus for 28 ounces of human milk, while 50 
Calories of lean beef, 10 of spinach, or one egg yolk will 
meet the additional need for iron. This shows that with 
a little care in the selection of foods there need be no 
danger of shortage of these important elements. 

The general plan of diet suggested for the prospective 
mother 1 may be followed by the nursing mother and 
the dietaries for thin men and women 2 will be sug- 
gestive as to how to keep up the fuel value of the 
diet. Since foods are broken down in the digestive 
tract and made over in the body, it is absurd to 
think that particular foods have specific effects upon 
the character of the milk. Any wholesome diet, ample 
in fuel and building materials, is suitable for good 
milk production. At the same time it must be borne 
in mind that the mammary glands are very sensitive to 
1 See page 90. 2 See pp. 59 and 87. 



g6 feeding the family 

nervous influences, and disturbances of digestion react 
very unfavorably upon the milk-secreting mechanism. 
Therefore any food which is known to disagree with the 
mother, or whose effect is doubtful, should be refrained 
from. And since the increased demands for food make 
the work of the digestive tract extraordinarily great, 
there is more danger than usual of an upset, and the diet 
should be correspondingly simpler and easier of diges- 
tion. Excitement, worry, fatigue, chill, constipation, 
all react quickly and unfavorably upon the milk secre- 
tion, and must be carefully guarded against. Successful 
nursing demands a quiet, contented life, in which food 
is carefully chosen, and exercise, fresh air, and mental 
diversion are provided in due moderation. For the 
few months which are so critical in the life of the baby, 
less important interests must be set aside, even those of 
other members of the family who can better afford a 
little neglect. 

A very simple, inexpensive dietary, adapted to the 
fuel requirements of the nursing mother also engaged in 
physical labor, from one of the menus on page 92, is 
given below. 

In addition to regular meals, a glass or bowl of hot 
milk, malted milk, gruel or eggnog taken just before 
nursing the baby in mid-morning or mid-afternoon is 
often beneficial.

CHAPTER V 

FOOD FOR THE BABY 

Happy the baby who enjoys his inalienable right to 
Nature's food supply — his own mother's milk ! His 
chances of a long and healthy life are immensely greater 
than those of the poor child who has to be artificially 
fed. In case of misfortune depriving him of his natural 
food supply, the best substitute is the milk of some other 
healthy woman with a baby of approximately the same 
age, but unfortunately this kind of substitute is not 
readily commanded by the average family, and the 
faithful cow has usually to be relied upon when the 
normal supply is cut off. That such a substitute is far 
from ideal, statistics make perfectly clear. A study of 
nearly 50,000 babies born alive in Berlin in 1890 showed 
that about one-fourth of these were dead at the end of 
the first year, of whom one in two was bottle-fed and 
only one in 13 breast-fed. That the baby not only has 
a better chance of surviving the perilous first year, but 
of growing to manhood as well, was made evident in a 
hygiene exhibition recently held in Dresden, in which it 
was shown that in 24 families with 109 children, all 
breast-fed, not one was dead at the end of five years ; 
while in 33 families in which the babies were all bottle-

FOOD FOR THE BABY 99 

fed one or more had been lost in each family in the same 
period. In another group of 79 families, in which 85 of 
the children were breast-fed and 109 bottle-fed, all the 
breast-fed children were alive at the end of eleven years, 
while more than half (57 %) of the bottle-fed babies 
were dead. In a study recently made in New York City 
of the relative danger to babies of dirt, flies, and artificial 
feeding, it was quite evident that artificial feeding was, of 
the three, the worst enemy to baby life. Such evidence 
makes clear the importance of a mother's making every 
effort to start the baby right and give him a fair chance 
to live and thrive. Every month of breast feeding is to 
be regarded as so much gain for the baby. If the milk 
supply is insufficient, it may be necessary to give addi- 
tional food, but this does not justify the discarding of the 
natural food so far as it is available. Only when it fails 
entirely, or there is some serious disturbance of the 
mother's health which makes nursing unwise, or when 
there is persistent failure on the part of the baby to 
digest the milk, should artificial feeding be adopted as 
the sole means of sustenance. 

Good breast feeding cannot be done carelessly, how- 
ever. The mother must take the best possible care of 
herself, eating wholesome food in sufficient amounts, as 
outlined in Chapter IV; leading a regular, hygienic, 
peaceful life as far as she is able, in order to maintain a 
full and uniform milk supply. She must keep in mind 
that upon her rests the responsibility for the healthy 
development of her baby ; must avoid indigestible food, 
or food that spoils her appetite so as to prevent suffi- 



ioo FEEDING THE FAMILY 

dent quantities of food being taken ; must have regular 
hours for meals and rest; get fresh air and exercise, 
but avoid fatigue and overwork; keep her mind 
pleasurably occupied while avoiding excitement; and, 
finally, she must feed the baby according to a definite 
schedule. 

A healthy baby grows fast. During the first six 
months he should double his birth weight, and by the 
end of the year triple it. He must not only digest food 
for this rapid body building, but he must have energy 
for the daily maintenance of his internal and external 
body activities besides, the result being that he has to 
take care of much more food in proportion to his weight 
than an adult does, and any upset in digestion is a very 
serious matter. Hence, anything in the mother's life 
which might disturb her steady production of whole- 
some milk must be avoided, and anything in the baby's 
life which might cause indigestion. He must have 
plenty of sleep and be allowed to He quietly by himself 
when awake, have plenty of fresh air to breathe and 
clothing which will give him a chance to exercise his 
arms and legs freely, so that he need not get all of his 
exercise by crying. Above all, he must get his meals 
regularly. With definite hours for feeding, the quality 
of the milk is more uniform, and the baby's alimentary 
tract responds better to the food. The stomach needs 
an interval of rest between meals, and the secretions of 
the alimentary tract are strongly influenced by habit, 
pouring out more freely under the stimulus of regular 
feeding. The appetite is less fickle, too, when meals 



FOOD FOR THE BABY 



IOI 



come at definite times. " Meals by the clock " is one 
of the first rules of successful feeding. 

What the schedule shall be depends somewhat upon 
circumstances. Probably the best practice up to the 
time a child is three months old is to feed every three 
hours through the day and once at night — seven feed- 
ings in the twenty-four hours ; e.g. at six and nine a.m., 
noon, three, six, and nine p.m., and midnight. After 
the child is three months old no night feeding need be 
given unless the baby wakens. From the fourth to the 
sixth month there may be six feedings, three and one- 
half hours apart; six and nine- thirty a.m., one, four- 
thirty, and eleven- thirty p.m., and after that five feed- 
ings; six and ten a.m., two, six, and ten p.m.

If the baby is delicate, shorter intervals between 
•feedings are sometimes prescribed, but never less than 
two hours ; if very sturdy, four-hour intervals are some- 
times adopted at the very start. Such schedules should 
be arranged under the advice of a competent physician. 
Strict observance of the schedule determined upon is 
more important than the exact interval between feedings 



102 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

or the number of feedings in the day, but in general 
long intervals promote good digestion better than do 
short ones. 

If the baby frets between meals he should be given 
cool (not cold) boiled water from a bottle or spoon — 
nothing else. Pacifiers are to be strictly avoided. They 
spoil the shape of the mouth and are bad carriers of 
germs; the constant sucking is undesirable for many 
reasons and swallowing air causes gastric discomfort. 

After meals the baby should be placed upright and 
patted very gently for a moment or two to bring up 
the "gas" (generally air) which he may have swallowed, 
then laid in his crib to rest quietly and soon go to sleep. 
His chief business in life is to grow. He is not to be 
considered a source of entertainment, nor should efforts 
be made to amuse him. The healthy baby when awake 
will play quietly by himself and not get over-excited nor 
exhausted. 

The Energy Requirements of the Baby 

The baby requires fuel for his life processes just as an 
adult does, but these processes are more rapid in the 
child than in the adult, so that even when lying quietly 
he needs more fuel in proportion to his weight than he 
will require later in life. From calorimetric studies it 
has been found that babies asleep in bed beside their 
mothers, who were awake, give off nearly two and one- 
half times as many Calories per pound as the mothers. 
An allowance of from 30 to 35 Calories per pound is 
necessary merely to keep a baby alive. 



FOOD FOR THE BABY 103 

Babies cannot lie quietly all the time, however. If 
they are to grow and acquire strong muscles they 
must have exercise, which they get by crying, kicking, 
pounding with their fists, and other movements. This 
means work, requiring a further supply of energy. A 
five-months-old baby has been shown to double his 
energy expenditure by the effort of crying. Active 
children really work as hard as any adult manual 
laborer. 

Furthermore, a baby is constantly storing food ma- 
terials in his body in the process of growth. Every 
day as much as 12 to 15 per cent of the Calories 
represented in his food may be used in this way. 
All the energy demands of the baby — (1) for the main- 
tenance of life processes, more rapid than in the adult, 
(2) for muscular activity, often great, and (3) for stor- 
age in growth — make the infant's total energy require- 
ment during the first three months of his life about 50 
Calories per pound per day. As he grows older, the 
requirement for internal activities becomes gradually 
less in proportion to body weight, the rate of growth 
falls, and therefore the total requirement for the second 
three months is about 45 Calories per pound per day; 
for the third three months about 40 Calories per pound 
per day, and for the last three months of the first year 
about 35 Calories per pound per day. 

In the case of the breast-fed baby, we judge the feed- 
ing to be successful when he makes steady gains in 
weight, averaging about eight ounces a week in the early 
months, and falling gradually to about four ounces a 



104 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

week ; and when by quiet sleep, absence of fretfulness, 
and other signs of health he shows that his diet agrees 
with him. 

Artificial Feeding 

Unfortunately there will always be some babies de- 
prived more or less completely of their natural food. 
Mothers with the best of intentions sometimes fail to 
produce milk, or furnish an inadequate supply, and other 
causes may rob the baby of his birthright. For such 
children a substitute for the natural food must be pro- 
vided. Nothing can take the place of milk for this pur- 
pose, even though it be milk from another species of 
animal, such as the cow. Milk contains everything 
needed for growth, and while the proportions of building 
materials vary with the natural rate of growth of the 
species, — milk for the puppy that doubles its weight in 
nine days having more protein and ash per quart than 
milk for the calf that doubles its weight in 47 days, and 
this in turn having more building materials per quart 
than milk for the human baby that doubles his weight 
in 180 days, — the main point is that these substances 
are present in forms which the human child can use 
better than any others, provided he can be made to 
digest the strange food. 

The ordinary problem in artificial feeding is, there- 
fore, one of adapting cow's milk to the digestive tract 
of the baby and at the same time providing, as far as 
possible, a normal supply of fuel and building material. 
There are many special devices by which these objects 



FOOD FOR THE BABY 



105 



can be attained, and the wise physician adopts the one 
which seems best suited to the individual case. For 
home use, when there is no expert to direct the feeding, 
the simplest plan is to take rich, well-mixed, whole 
milk, containing from four to rive per cent of fat, and 
prepare it according to the following scheme : x 



Scheme for Whole Milk Feeding During the First Year 
1 st day 1 to 2 ounces of water every 4 hours. 

2d to 4th days 3 ounces of milk, 7 ounces of water, 2 teaspoon- 
fuls of milk sugar, 2 divided into 7 feedings. 

5th to 7th days 4 ounces of milk, 8 ounces of water, 3 teaspoon- 
fuls of milk sugar, divided into 7 feedings. 

8th day to end Beginning with 5 ounces of milk, 10 ounces of 
of 3d month water, and if tablespoonfuls of milk sugar, 

increase the milk by f ounce every four days ; 
the water by \ ounce every eight days ; the 
milk sugar by \ tablespoonful every 2 weeks. 
Thus on the 16th day give 6 ounces of milk, 
\o\ ounces of water, 2 tablespoonfuls of milk 
sugar, divided into 7 feedings ; on the 20th 
day increase the milk to t\ ounces, using 
1 of ounces of water and 2 tablespoonfuls of 
milk sugar as before.

the milk by | ounce every 6 days, reduce the 
water by § ounce every 2 weeks, using 4% table- 
spoonfuls of milk sugar per day. 
If the food does not digest readily, barley 
water may be used instead of the plain water. 
It is made by cooking ^ tablespoonful of barley 
flour in the water for 20 minutes and cooling 
before adding to the milk. 

Beginning of 7th At the end of the 6th month the baby will be 
month to end receiving about 24 ounces of milk, 12 ounces 
of 9th month of water, and 4^ tablespoonfuls of milk sugar 
daily, divided into 5 feedings. Now increase 
the milk by \ ounce every week, reduce the 
water by \ ounce every 2 weeks, and reduce 
the milk sugar to 3 tablespoonfuls per day. 
Midway between two of the morning feedings 
give from 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls of strained 
orange juice. This helps to keep the bowels 
in good condition and serves as a safeguard 
against scurvy when pasteurized milk is fed 
exclusively. If barley flour has not been used 
earlier, it may be advantageously introduced 
during this period, cooking 1^ tablespoonfuls 
of the flour with the water for the day, and 
gradually increasing to 3 tablespoonfuls. 

Beginning of At the end of the 9th month the child will be 

10th month receiving about 30 ounces of milk, 8 ounces 

to end of of water cooked with 3 tablespoonfuls of bar- 

12th month ley flour, 3 tablespoonfuls of milk sugar, given 

in 5 feedings, and from 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls 

of orange juice between two morning meals. 

Now increase the milk 1 ounce per month, 

decrease the milk sugar 1 tablespoonful per 

month, and add barley gruel made with 3 

tablespoonfuls of barley flour cooked in 8 



FOOD FOR THE BABY 107 

ounces of water. Continue the use of the 
orange juice, which may be increased to 3 
tablespoonfuls if the bowels are not loose. 
After one feeding, the soft yolk of an egg- may 
be fed warm, with a spoon, or a small piece of 
stale bread crust be given to chew. No other 
foods should be given during the first year. 

If the baby is much above average weight he may 
require a little more food than that provided in the pre- 
ceding plan. For the first eight months he should average 
one and one-half ounces of milk for every pound of body 
weight per day, and from then till the end of the first 
year from one and one-third to one and one-fourth ounces 
per pound per day. This insures adequate protein for 
body building. 

Dilution with water is the simplest means of making 
milk easier of digestion, but this brings down the fuel 
value of the food as taken by the baby, whose capacity 
is limited by the size of his stomach and the ne- 
cessity for time between meals to digest his food. Since 
cow's milk is richer in protein in proportion to fat 
and carbohydrate than human milk, some of the fuel 
value can be regained by the addition of milk sugar 
throughout the nursing period, and after the first 
two or three months by barley or other cereal gruel, 
without increasing the difficulty of digestion. In fact, 
the use of barley water in the first three months is 
primarily to make digestion easier. The suggested 
schedule, outlined above, will supply fuel per day as 
follows : 



io8 FEEDING THE FAMILY 



At the end of the first month 
At the end of the third month 
At the end of the sixth month 
At the end of the ninth month 



30 Calories per pound 
41 Calories per pound 
43 Calories per pound 
40 Calories per pound 



The addition of orange juice, barley flour, and egg 
yolk will raise the fuel value from the sixth month to 
the end of the nursing period to about 45 Calories per 
pound. 

Comparing these figures with the baby's actual energy 
requirements, 1 it is noticeable at once that the food 
supply during the first month is far below what a normal 
baby gets when taking mother's milk, and is barely 
enough to supply his daily needs for energy, with little 
or no surplus for gain in weight. But it is absolutely 
essential that the baby digest his food if it is to do him 
any good, and it is unwise to overtax his stomach while 
he is getting used to the artificial food. Hence we must 
increase the strength of the feedings gradually and try 
to make up later for these early deficiencies. After the 
first two weeks if digestion is good, the fuel value might 
be raised by increasing the milk one-half ounce every three 
instead of every four days up to the end of the third 
month, after which the energy supply is adequate for 
normal growth. Very rapid increase in weight is to be 
regarded as a doubtful good, especially on artificial 
food; small, steady gains are less likely to be followed 
by nutritional disturbance later. 

Another way of raising the fuel value of diluted whole 
milk is by increasing the proportion of fat. Healthy

babies are very successfully fed by starting with milk 
which is richer than the whole cow's milk. A quart 
bottle of milk is allowed to stand five or more hours for 
the cream to rise, and then the richer milk from the top 
is removed ounce by ounce by means of a Chapin dipper, 
the required quantity thoroughly mixed, diluted as 
desired, and milk sugar or malt food added. This is 
known as the Top Milk Method. A series of progressive 
formulas, illustrating the use of this method, is given 
below.

At the end of the 9th month .... 43 Calories per pound 

For the remainder of the first year the feedings will 
follow the directions already given on page 106. 

No scheme of feeding can be followed slavishly. 
Babies show individuality in their capacity for food as 
in other respects; frail babies cannot be advanced to 
stronger food and larger quantities as fast as hardy 
ones. When in doubt, go slowly. Overfeeding is as 
harmful as underfeeding — so far as the digestive 
system is concerned, it is likely to be more so. When 
signs of indigestion appear, it is well to reduce the 
strength of the food temporarily. The two types of 
feeding schedule given illustrate the general principles 
of all successful artificial feeding : 

Regular meal times ; 

Gradual increases in strength and amount of food ; 
Giving less than the full energy requirement at first, and making 
up the deficiency later ; 



112 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Supplementing the iron in the milk by egg yolk (and orange juice) 

as the normal time of weaning approaches ; 
Giving orange juice to prevent constipation and possible scurvy ; 
Using barley flour made into gruel to promote ease of digestion, 

primarily in the early months; to add also to the food value 

of the diet in the later months. 

Care of the Baby's Food 

Only clean milk should be bought. Fresh milk is 
best when one can be sure that every precaution has 
been taken to keep it clean and cold and free from harm- 
ful or excessive bacteria. Nature provides fresh sterile 
milk for the young; if they are deprived of this, it is 
their right to have the best obtainable substitute. 
"Laboratory'' and " certified" milk are guaranteed to 
be wholesome. In the country, one should know the 
conditions under which the milk is produced, and buy 
only that which is clean and kept cold from the time of 
milking. Pasteurized milk must be used when there is 
danger of contamination, but pasteurized milk has 
changed somewhat by heating and if used exclusively 
should be supplemented as early as possible by orange 
juice, as a precaution against scurvy. Sometimes it is 
necessary to use boiled milk, to avoid all possible danger 
of bacterial poisoning, but if its use is long continued, 
it is even more important that some uncooked food be 
added to the diet. 

All milk must be protected from contamination at 
home ; kept in a cold place and covered. Food for the 
baby should be made up for one day at a time, each meal 
put into a clean feeding bottle (washed with hot soda 



FOOD FOR THE BABY 113 

water and boiled in clear water for twenty minutes), 
stoppered and kept cold till used. Just before feeding 
it can be warmed in hot water. Any food left over 
should be thrown away. A thermos bottle should 
never be used to keep the milk warm. Germs are likely 
to grow in the milk under such conditions and it may 
make the baby sick. Nipples must be thoroughly 
scrubbed inside with soda water after use, and kept in a 
covered bowl of borax water, ready for use. 

If there is the least doubt about the quality of the 
milk, it should be pasteurized at home. The feeding 
bottles can be set in a wire rack and this in a deep sauce- 
pan, full of cold water. When the water boils, the pan 
is to be removed from the stove, but the bottles left 
standing in the hot water twenty minutes, after which 
they should be cooled as rapidly as possible with cold 
water and placed on ice. 

Use of Proprietary Infant Foods 

In spite of all one may say about the value of clean, 
fresh cow's milk, properly prepared, for the baby, the 
mother's faith is often shaken by glowing advertisements 
of patent infant foods and she is tempted by their con- 
venience to give credence to their flaunted virtues. In 
composition they differ widely, some of them consisting 
of dried milk mixed with a certain amount of sugar, or 
dextrin and maltose, to be used with water without 
cooking; others consisting of dried milk mixed with 
sugar and baked wheat flour, to be used with water but 
requiring cooking ; and a large group made chiefly from 



H4 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

wheat or barley flour, sometimes simply baked and 
sometimes more or less completely changed into dextrin 
and maltose; none of these last should be used as a 
steady diet without the addition of milk. 

It becomes evident at once that such foods cannot be 
used intelligently without information as to their com- 
position. It is impossible to make the necessary adap- 
tation of food to the growth of the individual baby 
simply by following directions on the label of a box of 
food. Those not requiring the addition of milk are to 
be criticized because they deprive the baby of fresh 
food, and because they often contain but little fat and 
ash, while they have a very high percentage of carbo- 
hydrate. This means that the baby may have his fuel 
needs met without getting proper building material ; the 
result is an increase in weight, often beyond the normal, 
as a result of the high carbohydrate feeding. The body 
stores water and fat instead of building muscle and bone, 
looks fat but succumbs quickly in case of illness, losing 
weight with great rapidity ; and is liable to trouble from 
soft or brittle bones, which have to bear too much 
weight for their strength. 

The foods designed to be used with milk serve the 
same useful purpose as plain barley or other cereal 
flour made into gruel, provided sufficient quantities of 
milk are used. Those which are dextrinized are conven- 
ient because they go into solution readily, but barley 
can be easily dextrinized at home with any reliable 
preparation of diastase, and usually at much less 
expense. 



FOOD FOR THE BABY 115 

Food after Weaning 

If the baby has had the good fortune to be nursed 
by his mother, the problems of preparing other food for 
him are delayed normally until about the ninth month, 
and if the mother is strong and well and the baby thriv- 
ing, even to the twelfth month. Nursing after the end 
of the first year is seldom desirable unless to avoid wean- 
ing in hot weather. The quality of the milk is apt to 
deteriorate, and the baby begins to need iron in larger 
quantities than furnished in milk. He comes into the 
world with a special store of this precious material of 
growth — three times as much being found in his body 
in proportion to his weight as in the full-grown adult. 
But by the end of the first year, having tripled his original 
weight, and having received only a very small daily 
supply of iron in his milk, he needs to have this diet 
supplemented by such easily digested iron-bearing foods 
as yolk of egg and orange juice. The period from the 
ninth to the fifteenth month may be regarded as one of 
transition from mother's milk to other food. The best 
substitute with which to begin is cow's milk. This will 
not tax the baby's digestive tract as severely as it would 
have in the very early months of his life ; still, it is a 
strange food, and care must be taken to make it easy 
of digestion. For this reason it should be diluted, pref- 
erably with barley gruel, and following the directions 
for artificial feeding of a baby one or two months younger 
(page 106). If possible, weaning should be done gradu- 
ally, giving at first one feeding from a bottle in place of 



Ii6 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

a nursing, and increasing the number of bottle feedings 
until the baby is entirely weaned at eleven or twelve 
months. This means less shock to his digestive system 
than if his food be suddenly changed entirely. When 
the baby digests the diluted milk well, the amount of 
gruel can be gradually decreased and a tablespoonful or 
two of strained cereal be given with a spoon twice a day. 
Most children can digest plain whole milk by the end 
of the first year if weaning has begun in the ninth or 
tenth month. If at all possible, weaning in the 
summer time should be avoided, as change of food 
is likely to cause some digestive disturbance which will 
be increased by the hot weather, and market milk in hot 
weather is seldom in quite so good condition as in cold. 
As soon after the eight or ninth month as the baby be- 
comes accustomed to taking cow's milk, he should be 
given from one to three tablespoonfuls of strained fruit 
juice once a day unless he has trouble with loose bowels. 
By the time he is ten months old he may have a soft 
egg yolk to give him iron, and a small piece of stale bread 
crust or zwiebach to chew, immediately after his milk 
feeding. 

At the end of the first year, whether a baby be breast 
or bottle fed, he should have reached the point where he 
drinks plain warm cow's milk from a bottle, 1 taking 
about one quart a day, one to three tablespoonfuls of 
strained, mild fruit juice once a day, the yolk of an egg 

1 The bottle is preferable to the cup, because the child will drink more 
slowly and the mother can tell more accurately just how much he has 
taken. 



FOOD FOR THE BABY 117 

about once a day, two or three tablespoonfuls of 
thoroughly cooked, strained cereal daily (given at one 
or two meals), and a piece of stale bread, crisp toast or 
zwiebach to chew at least once a day. , The milk pro- 
vides the great bulk of his food. The fruit juice is partly 
to keep his bowels in order, partly to help in accustom- 
ing him to other foods besides milk, and partly to give 
him more iron than the milk affords. The cereal jelly 
serves as a good introduction to other foods which have 
to be eaten with a spoon, and also helps to keep a good 
proportion between the protein and the other fuel foods 
(fat and carbohydrate) in the diet. Cow's milk alone 
has too high a proportion of protein to be quite ideal for 
the slow-growing human child, although perfectly suited 
to the quick-growing calf. Toast or other forms of dry, 
hard bread give exercise to the jaws and help to develop 
good teeth later, while serving as a means of teaching 
the important habit of mastication. Nothing else is 
needed to keep the baby healthy and no risk of upset- 
ting his digestive tract should be run by adding other 
foods. Because a baby is not made violently ill by meat, 
tea, coffee, sweet crackers, and what not, it does not 
follow that he has not been injured. Even the perver- 
sion of his appetite, so that he does not desire the foods 
which are best for him, is a serious matter, though the 
results are not immediately apparent. 

The child's chief business in life in his early years is 
to grow strong and develop good habits. This applies 
not only to eating, but to sleeping also. Regular hours, 
regular supplies of carefully chosen food, and plenty of 



n8 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

fresh air mean not only the development of sturdy legs 
and rosy cheeks, but of a strong digestive tract able to 
stand the inevitable strains of later life. Good growth 
of muscles and nerves in this part of the body cannot be 
seen directly, but they count tremendously when the 
whole life is in review. One year of good feeding at the 
beginning of life is more important than ten after forty, 
and a baby's needs are not to be judged by an adult's 
inclinations. Feeding must be a matter of principle and 
not of impulse, and the reward will be partly in the 
present — much more in the future. 




A Quart of Milk a Day 



CHAPTER VI 

FOOD FOR THE TWO-YEAR-OLD CHILD 

The feeding of the baby during the first nine or ten 
months of its life is so important for its welfare that 
nature does not willingly entrust it to anyone but her- 
self. The sensitive, rapidly-growing digestive tract is 
confined to a single food material, ideally adapted to its 
needs. By the end of the year the digestive apparatus is 
ready for new tasks ; teeth demand material for chew- 
ing, the body store of iron is used up, the mother's milk 
deteriorates, and there is every indication of readiness 
for more kinds of food in the diet. But we must not 
assume that the year-old child is ready for the diet of 
an adult. Statistics from cities where the mothers 
generally nurse their babies show that the mortality 
rises at the end of the first year, when the diet changes. 
The still delicate digestive tract is given tasks far too 
great for it; as if a year-old child were asked to chop 
down a tree or run a race ! The fundamental principle 
in child feeding is to develop the digestive powers gradually. 
The woes of the " second summer" and "teething" are 
very largely the result of an unwise choice of diet. To 
boast that a fifteen-months-old baby "eats everything" 
is not a tribute to its precocity, but to the ignorance or 

119 



120 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

culpable negligence of its mother. With a carefully regu- 
lated diet, the second year is less perilous than the first. 

Feeding during the Second Year 

At the end of the first year the main part of the diet 
is cow's milk to the amount of nearly a quart a day. It 
should remain the chief staple throughout the second 
year, from three cups to a quart being given daily. 
Scientific study of milk has year by year emphasized its 
value as a food for growth ; its proteins contain nitrogen 
in ideal forms for cell and muscle building ; its fat carries 
some constituent essential to growth; its supplies of 
calcium and phosphorus are ample for bone construc- 
tion; its iron compounds although present in small 
amount are of high value ; its supply of other building 
and regulating ash constituents is liberal; and its ease 
of digestion insures utilization of these valuable elements. 
To cut down the supply of milk after the period of in- 
fancy is a great mistake; even chickens grow larger 
and healthier when milk is made a part of their diet. 
The same care to have it clean and fresh should be taken 
as in the first year. 

During the first two or three months of the second 
year, cereals in the form of gruel may still be added to 
the milk, up to about one-third of its volume. But if 
whole milk can be digested readily, it is time to give 
the cereal food separately in the form of a "jelly." 
This is made by cooking rolled oats, wheat, or other 
cereal very thoroughly (four to six hours), as for ordi- 
nary breakfast food, and then putting it through a fine 



FOOD FOR THE TWO-YEAR-OLD CHILD 121 

strainer. From one-half an ounce to an ounce of dry 
cereal cooked in this way can be given in a day, in one 
or two meals. After two or three months of strained 
cereals, the finer varieties, such as farina and wheatena, 
may be given unstrained ; and, subsequently, any thor- 
oughly cooked cereal may be fed without straining. Thus 
the principle of gradually training the digestive tract to 
take care of solid food and of food containing some in- 
digestible material (cellulose) is carried out. Preference 
should be given to cereals made from the whole grain on 
account of their richer supply of ash. Oatmeal seems to 
be one of the most valuable cereals for growth, and, unless 
there is a tendency to looseness of the bowels, it can well 
be used three or four times a week at least. These 
cereal foods should be carefully seasoned with a very 
little salt, and served with milk or thin cream, but no 
sugar. 

The use of the yolk of one egg daily, for the sake of 
its iron and phosphorus, should be continued. Once in 
a while the whole egg may be given for a change, but 
for children of this age who are getting a quart of milk 
a day the white is superfluous, as it tends to make the 
protein content of the diet very high. 

Every day some fruit juice or strained pulp should be 
given. Orange juice remains the staple, but gradually 
other kinds mild in flavor may be tried, as prune juice 
or pulp, cooked apple juice or pulp (from stewed or 
baked apples), pineapple or fresh peach juice carefully 
strained. Not more than two or three tablespoonfuls 
should be given at one time. If a new kind is being 



122 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

tried, only half the usual quantity should be given, 
diluted with half as much water. The best time to give 
the fruit is between two morning meals. Fruit is im- 
portant because it helps to counteract constipation and 
adds ash for growth. 

Before the middle of the second year the habit of 
taking some stale dry bread, zwiebach, or thoroughly 
dry toast can usually be established. The exact time 
depends on the state of development of the teeth, as the 
main purpose of this addition to the diet is to foster the 
habit of mastication, so important to the easy digestion 
of solid foods, which are to constitute a large part of 
the diet later on. If this principle is kept in mind about 
the breadstuff's, most questions in regard to suitable 
kinds will be answered. Those that offer no resist- 
ance to the teeth and jaws will be excluded. 

After the middle of the second year one green vege- 
table should be included in the diet every day. In the 
form of a dilute and thoroughly cooked soup, strained 
and mixed with milk, it is sometimes given by the end 
of the first year. But it is well to remember that the 
behavior of a new food in the alimentary tract is always 
problematical and it is unwise to experiment with more 
than one at a time. So in these early months of the 
second year, when new fruits and new cereals are being 
tried, one need not be in great haste to add vegetables. 
In any case, the amount given at first must be small 
(from one to three teaspoonfuls) ; it can be gradually 
increased as the child grows accustomed to it. The 
vegetable chosen must be mild in flavor and strained 



FOOD FOR THE TWO-YEAR-OLD CHILD 123 

after cooking. Green vegetables are introduced for the 
sake of their ash constituents and care must be taken 
that these are not thrown away in cooking. Spinach 
is richer in iron than any other vegetable, and is the 
ideal one to add first. Green peas, asparagus tips, young 
beets and carrots (if thoroughly softened in cooking) 
are practical to strain and are usually well digested by 
children. The vegetable pulp (or pulp .and juice) may 
simply be salted, or a little cream may be added. Often 
they are most acceptable when made into soup with 
milk, a little flour being used for thickening. 

To recapitulate, the foods from which the two-year- 
old's dietary should be built up are the following : 

Milk (the chief article in the diet) ; 

Well-cooked cereals (at first strained, later unstrained) ; 

Fruit juice or pulp (two or three kinds, small amounts) ; 

Yolk of egg (not over one a day) ; 

Vegetable pulp or juice (a few kinds, given especially 
in the second half of the year) ; 

Stale bread or its equivalent (for training in masti- 
cation). 

These foods, in suitable amounts and at proper times, 
will supply everything essential to good nutrition during 
the second year. Greater variety is not only unneces- 
sary, but positively harmful; partly because it tempts 
the child to discard milk, and partly because of dangers 
of indigestion. Milk should remain the staple food for 
some years to come, if the child is to build firm, thick 
bones instead of spongy, thin-walled ones, and real 
muscle instead of a padding of fat and water to cover 



124 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

them ; and a great variety of food, especially if highly 
flavored, is almost certain to result in a refusal of the milk. 

Just as the alimentary tract is gradually trained to 
solid foods, so it must be gradually trained to variety in 
diet. One of the commonest mistakes in feeding in the 
second year is to give too many kinds of food. The older 
members of the family must rigidly refrain from offering 
"tastes" of their food, or in any way suggesting the 
thought of the child eating the food provided for adults. 
It is very important for him to learn early that adults' and 
children's food are not the same, any more than their 
clothing. What mother would put French-heeled slippers 
on an eigh teen-months-old baby ? Yet the same mother 
will offer her little child a twenty-five-year-old's food, quite 
content with the fact that he swallows it. If he is sub- 
sequently fretful and restless — that is "bad temper"! 

While personal traits develop early, and manifest 
likes and dislikes have to be met as best one can, it is a 
foolish notion that any whim should be allowed to con- 
trol the selection of food. What if a person disliked all 
foods containing protein? Should he be permitted to 
die of nitrogen starvation? Food needs of the body are 
governed by scientific laws, and the more the mind is 
trained to recognize and respect these laws, the simpler 
the feeding problem becomes. The adult who is re- 
sponsible for the welfare of the child is the authority as 
to what he shall eat, and not the baby who is as yet 
but a little animal with no knowledge of his own needs. 
The early inculcation of good eating habits is one of the 
most fundamental things in his training. He may, like 



FOOD FOR THE TWO-YEAR-OLD CHILD 125 

Darwin, become world famous in spite of forty- three 
years of dyspepsia, but what might not Darwin have 
accomplished if he had been able to work a whole day 
at a time, instead of only half a day ! People who offer 
to children, for whose feeding they are not responsible, 
anything to eat without express permission are vandals, 
guilty of a greater outrage than if they should tear or 
ruin their clothes. An attack of indigestion has far- 
reaching consequences in a little child ; it may retard the 
healthy development of the digestive tract itself; it 
may help to stunt growth in general; or it may so 
lower the resistance of the body to bacteria that harm- 
ful organisms gain a foothold and acute illness results. 
It pays to take the best of care in the feeding of little 
children; to give them the few simple foods that are 
best for them in an atmosphere which promotes content- 
ment with them, to prepare these with care, so that 
appetite and digestion may be fostered, and to serve 
them with unfailing regularity. When children run 
about and play actively, they need to be guarded against 
eating when exhausted or excited, and also against any 
interference with their hours for rest and sleep. 

During the second year there should be four meals a 
day; the first not earlier than 6 a.m., nor later than 
7 : 30 ; the second at 9, 10, or 10 : 30, depending on the 
hour for the first; the third at 1, 2, or 2 : 30 p.m. ; and 
the fourth at 5, 5 : 30, or 6 p.m. Care should be taken 
to offer water between meals. Thirstiness is often mis- 
taken for hunger. The food plan given below illus- 
trates the arrangement of a schedule for meals, and the 



126 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

dietary worked out on this plan is suited to the food 
needs of the average child of eighteen months. 

The average weight of a normal child one year old is 
from 20 to 21 pounds ; of a child two years old, 29 to 30 
pounds. Weighings should be made at frequent inter- 
vals, just as in the first year, as one test of the child's 
progress. An allowance of about 40 Calories per pound 
will cover the energy needs of the second year. Four 
protein Calories per pound will meet his need for nitrogen, 
and the selection of foods indicated will afford an 
abundance of ash constituents.

CHAPTER VII 

FOOD FOR CHILDREN THREE AND FOUR 
YEARS OLD 

Adhering to the principle of gradual increase in the 
complexity of the diet, there will be no striking changes in 
the character of the food during this period. As children 
grow older they take an increasing interest in the appear- 
ance and flavor of food, and enjoy occasional changes in 
the form in which it is served, and even in the dishes used. 

Milk is still the basis of the diet; one quart a day 
being a suitable amount for most children. Some of the 
cream from the top of the bottle may be removed and 
used for the cereal, and a portion of the remaining milk 
used in making a vegetable soup; another portion for 
some very simple dessert, as junket, plain baked or 
boiled custard, cornstarch or gelatin blancmange, bread, 
tapioca, rice, or other cereal pudding (without raisins). 
Such a dessert can now be served once a day. The rest 
of the milk will usually be drunk (slightly warmed) ; 
but, again, part of it may be used for supper in a dish 
of bread and milk ; one of milk toast ; or with rice or 
some other cereal taking up milk readily (such as crisp 
corn flakes). In this way adaptations can be made to 
the tastes of individual children without any real change 
in the character of the diet. Milk is milk whether 

128 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN THREE AND FOUR 129 

drunk from a cup or eaten with a spoon as rice pudding 
or delicate pink junket. 1 

One whole egg per day can now be used, though the 
yolk is still the important part from the point of view 
of the child's body needs. It may be served as a dish 
by itself at the mid-day meal, in any way in which it 
is kept soft — " boiled,' ' poached, coddled, or shirred ; in 
an omelet or cooked with milk as creamy egg, egg tim- 
bale, etc. ; but never hardened by high temperatures or 
coated with fat as in frying. Often it will be incor- 
porated into the dessert ; and sometimes instead of the 
cooked desserts children relish an "egg pudding," which 
is really an eggnog, the egg beaten up in milk and 
moderately sweetened. 

A well-cooked cereal should appear in the menu at 
least once a day. Straining being no longer necessary, 
the choice is practically unlimited, though cereals from 
the whole grains (especially oatmeal) should have the 
preference. The most important point is thoroughness of 
cooking, so that the cellulose is softened in the highest 
degree, and the flavor of the grain is developed. The 
fireless cooker is a valuable aid in the preparation of 
cereals, but care must be observed to maintain a cooking 
temperature long enough to accomplish the purpose. 
Cut oats and cornmeal in particular need more than one 
night's cooking to develop their best texture and flavor. 
And since these bland dishes are a very important part

letin No. 717, U. S. Department of Agriculture. 



130 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

of the little child's diet, too much emphasis cannot be 
laid upon care in their preparation. 

A cereal of different character from that usually- 
served for breakfast can often be made the main dish 
for supper, rice, cornmeal, and occasionally cornflakes 
lending themselves well to this purpose. Milk or cream 
may be used freely with the cereal foods, but no sugar ; 
this should be reserved for desserts and not put on plain 
foods like cereals and bread, because sugar blunts the 
appetite so that less is likely to be eaten and children 
are apt to tire of them sooner. 

Some form of dry, rather hard bread can now be in- 
cluded in at least two meals a day, and for the sake of 
tooth and jaw development should never be neglected. 
Most crackers are too easily softened to serve the pur- 
pose well, and tend to cling to the teeth, though hard, 
whole wheat crackers may be given now and then for 
variety. As long as milk is the staple in the diet, and 
eggs and fruit and vegetables can be given daily, it is 
immaterial whether the bread be white or brown. When 
there is danger of lack of iron, whole wheat preparations 
should be used. 

Fruit should be given at least once a day. If digestion 
is feeble, only the fruit juices previously allowed and in 
about the same quantity (one to three tablespoonfuls) 
should be given. If the child is sturdy, mild fruits of 
delicate texture, thoroughly cooked, such as baked apples 
(pulp only), apple sauce, stewed Bartlett pears, baked or 
steamed banana, may be gradually introduced into the 
diet. All of these should be cooked with little or no 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN THREE AND FOUR 131 

sugar and only two to four tablespoonfuls given at one 
time, according to the age and the strength of the child. 

A green vegetable of mild flavor and delicate texture 
should be made a regular part of the diet, given once a 
day; it may be mashed or finely chopped instead of 
sifted, as earlier. String beans, squash, and stewed 
celery are good additions to the former list. Raw vege- 
tables should not be used, nor cooked ones of strong 
flavor or coarse texture. Where great economy is 
necessary, dried peas and beans may be used in soups. 
As with cereals, care in cooking is necessary to make 
green vegetables wholesome and attractive, and since 
in later life these become more and more a source of the 
indispensable ash constituents, pains should be taken 
to teach children to like them. At this period, how- 
ever, they only supplement milk, eggs, and fruit, and 
it is often better to be content if the child tastes a vege- 
table than to have a pitched battle over eating a larger 
amount. New foods are often unpopular simply because 
of their strangeness ; with familiarity, the impression 
always being given that they are desirable, one can in 
time overcome many seeming aversions. 

Extra fuel can be provided by the addition of baked 
potato, which in general should be introduced as soon as 
the types of food already mentioned in suitable amounts 
do not give the full quota of energy for the day. Butter 
may also be used in moderate amounts on the bread. 

No other foods are needed to keep a normal child in 
healthy condition up to the beginning of the fifth year. 
The great temptation is to enlarge the range of foods 



132 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

too fast, and to feed the little children at the family 
table too soon. If they must be served there, they 
should be taught to pay no regard whatever to the food 
eaten by the other members of the family. The best 
meal schedules generally insure their being fed by them- 
selves, however, which is more satisfactory in all re- 
spects; they are not tempted to cry for things they 
should not have ; adults are not tempted to give them 
" tastes" ; and exclusive attention can be given to their 
manner of eating, which is also important if they are to 
become civilized members of society. 

The average weight of healthy children for the third 
and fourth years is in round numbers 35 and 37I pounds 
respectively. An allowance of from 37 to 40 Calories 
per pound will cover the energy needs of these years, 
and three or four protein Calories per pound will meet 
the nitrogen requirement. The food intake of individual 
children will vary considerably from any standard be- 
cause the rate of growth differs much and so does the 
muscular activity. Quite early, little boys exhibit a 
higher degree of muscular tension than little girls, so 
that even if they seem to play in much the same way 
the boy may give evidence of a larger amount of energy 
expended by a more pronounced demand for food. 
Throughout the growing period, the best way to meet 
this situation is to supply food equal to the standards 
developed by the study of many children, to watch 
weight and appetite, and to guard against possible under- 
feeding by supplying as extra fuel as much plain bread, 
milk, and cereals as the child desires. If he is really in 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN THREE AND FOUR 133 

need of food, he will eat plain bread ; if not, such food will 
not tempt him to overeat merely to please the palate. 
In no case should food be offered except at mealtime, but 
water should be given now and then between meals. 

The food plan and dietary given below illustrate the 
practical working out of the principles discussed above.

CHAPTER VIII 

FOOD FOR CHILDREN FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS 

OLD 

One day the writer sat in a restaurant for luncheon 
beside a little girl apparently about six years old. She 
was just finishing a plate of hot griddle cakes and a 
double portion of syrup, and her mother was pouring 
half of her cup of coffee into a cup for the child. As the 
meal was finished and they rose to depart, the mother 
remarked to a friend accompanying them that she was 
taking the little girl to see a doctor — "she had seemed 
languid lately." Poor child! With such a luncheon 
even a robust adult might feel "languid." Unfortu- 
nately the retribution for dietetic sins comes slowly and 
insidiously, as a rule, instead of swiftly and strikingly, 
and the connection between an abused stomach and 
"bad nerves" or "temper," or other manifestations of a 
physical constitution below par is not impressed, if it is 
even suspected. One of the interesting developments 
of the babies' health contests which have been held with 
such success in the past few years is the chagrin of 
parents who dreamed they were bringing normal if not 
prize babies to the examining experts and were startled 
into new vigilance by discovering that they did not 

135 



136 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

even know what a normal child really is. And one of 
the most encouraging features of such contests is that, 
with knowledge of how a baby ought to be cared for 
put into practice, the babies low of grade one year have 
been able to capture prizes a second year. All through 
childhood weighing should be done at frequent intervals 
and tables of weight and height of normal children con- 
sulted. (See Appendix, pp. 431-433.) Due regard should 
also be given to such other evidences of good health as 
sound sleep, reasonable appetite, absence of peevish- 
ness, firm flesh, and rosy skin. And while fresh air, 
wholesome exercise, and plenty of rest must always be 
counted as factors in good nutrition, suitable food re- 
mains the most fundamental thing in the physical 
progress of the child. 

Feeding during the fifth, sixth, and seventh years 
differs little from that for the fourth year, except in the 
increasing quantity required to meet the needs of the 
larger child. All the kinds of nutritive material essen- 
tial to growth have already been introduced into the 
dietary — milk, eggs, cereals, fruit, green vegetables, 
stale bread ; supplemented by butter, cream, potatoes, 
and, in certain dishes, a little sugar for extra fuel. All 
food should still be served as simply as possible. Much 
of the quart of milk which ought to be the foundation 
of the diet can be drunk ; the rest used in simple soups, 
desserts, or plain cream sauces for vegetables. For 
variety, especially on cold days, the appearance of milk 
as a beverage may be changed by heating with a little 
malted milk; by cooking with just enough cocoa to 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN FIVE TO SEVEN 137 

give color and flavor ; or by coloring with a cereal coffee. 
The addition of a spoonful of whipped cream to one of 
these modified forms may glorify it into a very special 
treat for some birthday or holiday. No tea, coffee, or 
strong cocoa should ever be given to children. A wel- 
come addition to the simple desserts during this period 
will be various homemade frozen dishes, such as milk 
sherbets and plain ice cream. These should not be 
served oftener than once a week, being too sweet for 
staple desserts; and in very moderate quantities on 
account of their coldness. Unless one is absolutely cer- 
tain of the quality, ice cream purchased outside the home 
should not be given to young children. Very often it is 
made under unsanitary conditions, or kept unduly long, 
and is badly contaminated by bacteria. Icecreams 
made from thick cream are too rich for little children. 
The frozen dish should be regarded chiefly as another 
means of making milk acceptable in the dietary by a 
simple change in its form. Lemon or orange milk 
sherbet, cocoa or junket ice cream, or a plain frozen 
custard of milk and eggs are the most suitable to choose. 
Cereals should still be served without sugar, but with 
plenty of milk. The warm cooked cereal should always 
be the staple breakfast dish, oatmeal being given the 
preference. The ready-to-eat cereals should be reserved 
for supper or for especially hot days in summer ; eaten 
dry and crisp instead of bread, they make a suitable 
lunch if the child is hungry in the middle of the after- 
noon; he is not likely to fail to chew such fare or to 
overeat of it. 



138 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Raw fruits, except in the form of juice, should be in- 
troduced into the diet cautiously. Perfectly ripe pears, 
peaches, and grapes, free from skins and seeds, are the 
best to experiment with, but for the most part the fruit 
should be cooked, and especially any given for supper. 
Dried fruits, such as apples, peaches, and prunes, are 
very valuable, especially when the cost must be limited. 
They all need long, slow cooking and little or no added 
sugar. Dates may be stewed in a little water and put 
through a sieve to remove the coarse outer skin, then 
flavored with a little sugar and lemon juice. Bananas 
should always be cooked for young children, baked in 
their skins or steamed in a covered vessel in a very little 
water. They do not require sugar. Preserves of all 
kinds and very sweet canned fruits must be avoided. 

Green vegetables should still be cooked, and mashed 
or sifted because they are likely to be poorly masticated. 
The addition of a plain cream sauce now and then will 
give variety to the menu and add to the fuel value of 
the vegetable dish. Potatoes should always be mealy. 
Baking is the most desirable method of cooking, but 
after the fifth year, plain boiled and mashed potatoes 
are not objectionable. Fried ones must never be offered. 

The temptation to add hot breads, biscuits, rolls, 
griddle cakes, and the like must be steadily resisted. 
Only bread stale enough or hard enough to offer exer- 
cise in mastication should be given. Breadsticks, crisp 
to the center, or sippets, made by toasting narrow strips 
of bread in the oven, will be welcome for variety. 

Butter, cream, and bacon fat in moderation are valu- 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN FIVE TO SEVEN 139 

able in the child's diet. But the butter should be spread 
on bread rather than used in cooking ; cream should be 
thin and used preferably over cereals, toast, and simple 
desserts. Bacon fat may be added to baked potatoes or 
spread on bread. 

Occasionally a small serving of plain cookies, stale 
sponge cake, graham, whole wheat, or other crackers 
may be given at the end of the meal. 

With milk freely supplied and an average of one egg 
a day, there is no call for the introduction of meat into 
the diet until after a child is seven years old, and, on 
the other hand, there are several good reasons for with- 
holding it during these early years. In the first place, 
as has been already shown in Chapter II, meat is 
of all protein foods most liable to putrefaction in the 
intestine ; and experiments indicate that the younger the 
child the more speedily these products of putrefaction 
develop when meat is fed. A somewhat analogous case 
among animals is often cited. Adult cats thrive on a 
rich meat diet, while kittens fed largely on meat are 
liable to convulsions. So children of three show more 
signs of putrefaction when meat is made a part of their 
diet than do children of six ; and these in turn are more 
liable to it than children of eight. Since milk feeding 
will cause the signs of putrefaction to disappear and meat 
protein is no better for growth than milk protein, the ad- 
vantage is decidedly with the milk rather than the meat. 

Another reason for withholding meat is that it 
naturally tends to displace milk on account of its higher 
flavor, and meat is much poorer in ash constituents than 



140 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

milk, being totally deficient in calcium, of which milk 
is the most important source. A third reason is that 
the stimulating extractives in meat, which may be quite 
useful to a jaded adult, should not be used to whip up 
the sensitive growing organism, which when healthy is 
far better off without stimulants of any kind. The two 
chief advantages of meat are that it requires mastica- 
tion and exercises the chewing apparatus and that it is 
a useful source of iron. But, as already shown, dry 
bread makes excellent chewing material, with none of 
the disadvantages of meat; and eggs and green vege- 
tables will supply iron in forms believed to be more 
useful to the child, aside from the fact that the intestinal 
putrefaction of meat seriously interferes with the utili- 
zation of its iron. Excepting the point in regard to 
mastication, what is true of meat is true of beef juice. 
Its use is best restricted to babies who for some reason 
cannot have an adequate supply of milk, egg yolk, and 
fruit juice, or who are sick enough to need a stimulant. 
Meat broths are of course merely stimulating, and their 
only possible virtue in the ordinary child's dietary is to 
induce the eating of cereals or vegetables which may be 
cooked in them, and this can usually be accomplished in 
some other way. They almost inevitably limit the 
amount of milk taken, and therefore should be reserved 
till the child is older, his need of materials for growth less 
pronounced, and his total capacity for food greater. 

The average weight of normal children for the fifth, 
sixth, and seventh years and the energy requirement per 
pound of body weight per day is, in round numbers :

It seems advisable in these years of comparatively 
rapid growth to allow from three to four protein Calories 
per pound per day, though probably somewhat in excess 
of the actual requirement. 

The same scrupulous care in regard to regularity of 
meals must be continued. Usually breakfast will now be 
given at 7 or 7 : 30 ; a very simple lunch at 10 or 10 : 30 ; 
a substantial dinner at 1 or 1 : 30 ; and a plain supper at 
5 : 30 or 6. During this period many children begin 
going to school, and the meal schedules must be ad- 
justed to the school schedule. Especial care needs to 
be taken that breakfast be provided in time to be eaten 
without haste or fear of being late to school. And no 
child should be permitted to go to school without break- 
fast. The pangs of an empty stomach will cause him 
to feel fagged out long before the noon meal, which is 
often the next one. He will then be likely either to be 
over-hungry and eat hurriedly to the upset of his diges- 
tion, or to have lost the feeling of hunger and refuse a 
rational meal. In any case, considering the amount of 
fuel a child must take to keep his machinery going and to 
have a surplus for growth, he cannot afford to miss break- 
fast with the hope of making good the loss later in the 
day. Numerous studies of school children show that no 



i 4 2 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

breakfast and malnutrition are commonly found together. 
The young child is fortunate if his school provides a mid- 
morning lunch, to take the place of the one which he has 
formerly enjoyed at home. This should be of the simplest 
character ; a slice of bread and butter, a glass of milk and 
a cracker, or a bowl of cereal and milk being quite suffi- 
cient. Such good results have followed the introduction of 
these school lunches — gains in weight, improved general 
health, and better school behavior — that they are now a 
part of the regular school program in many places, and 
mothers may find that they can render useful public ser- 
vice in extending the practice where it is not in vogue. 1 
When there is no opportunity for a morning lunch, 
the dinner must be served earlier in the day — prefer- 
ably at noon — and then a light lunch may be given 
in the afternoon, similar to that suggested for morning, 
at 3 or 3 : 30. During the first school years the child 
has many new conditions to meet, such as the excite- 
ment of going away from home and mingling with a 
large number of persons, and the change to a schedule 
involving hours of confinement, and no extra strain 
should be put upon him in the way of caring for diffi- 
cult food. He needs more than ever to be safeguarded 
against unsuitable food, or food at unsuitable times, to 
which his school companions and surroundings may 
tempt him, and against eating when exhausted or greatly 
excited by his work or play. Regularity, simplicity, 
and serenity are good dietetic watchwords ; good health

CHAPTER IX 

FOOD FOR CHILDREN EIGHT TO TWELVE 
YEARS OLD 

By the time most children are eight years old they are 
established in the school-going habit. Some of the 
problems of nutrition which arise when they first change 
from a life of comparative freedom and of much time 
out of doors to one of restraint and too often, alas, 
of little fresh air, have been mentioned in the pre- 
ceding chapter. The years when the rate of growth is 
most rapid and the digestive tract most sensitive now 
are past, and errors in diet are followed by less swift 
retribution, so that there is a temptation to relax the 
vigilant care of the child's food and leave him to his own 
devices. But this is a great mistake. The period of 
physical development in a human being covers nearly a 
quarter of a century, and the seven-year-old child has 
climbed less than a third of the hill of growth, as the 
diagram below plainly shows. We attend to his cloth- 
ing and shelter — how much more important to see that 
he has proper food ! 

During the school years no such reserve of fuel is 
carried in the, tissues as we find in the case of adults. 
A grown man can go three or four days without food and

growing child needs his proper amount of food at proper 
intervals every day, or he runs the risk of malnutrition

other times. Irregularity is one of the commonest 
errors in child feeding. 

According to the principle already laid down, the 
comparatively simple diet of the seventh year is to be 
gradually extended. Only a few well-chosen dishes 
need be offered at any one meal, but a tendency to 
choose a single dish for a meal and refuse everything 
else should be discouraged. In adult life a well-balanced 
diet demands more kinds of food than in childhood, 
when such a variety of elements is supplied by milk 
alone, and it is a great advantage to have been so trained 
as to be able to take these in all sorts of forms. Most 
adults eat in groups and pronounced individual likes and 
dislikes have great economic and social, if not always 
physiological, disadvantages. Half the problems^of the 
food provider arise, not from the difficulty of securing 
wholesome food to make a well-balanced ration, but 
from the necessity of remembering that Mr. Jones will 
not touch fish, Mrs. Smith never eats cabbage, and Mr. 
Brown must always have apple pie for supper ! Youth 
is the time to cultivate respect for all natural foods as a 
means to physical and mental efficiency, and not merely 
as ticklers of the palate. Disparaging remarks about 
wholesome food should never be permitted, for it must 
always be borne in mind that eating has psychological 
as well as physiological aspects, and children are quick 
to catch the notions of those with whom they associate. 
If mother plainly turns up her nose at milk and cereals 
and bread and butter, how can she expect the children 
to relish them? Most food aversions are acquired in 



148 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

early life when the sensibilities are keenest. An acci- 
dent at the table with humiliating consequences, an un- 
pleasant association of a food with illness, a comparison 
with something disagreeable, may cause repugnance 
lasting for years. Such aversions, once acquired, call 
for patience and tact and may never be completely 
overcome. It is a part of the feeding problem of 
childhood to prevent such misfortunes. Table con- 
versation should deal with topics other than food, 
and when disturbances arise at the table eating 
should be stopped until tranquillity is restored. Food 
taken in grief or anger has a poor chance of fulfil- 
ling its proper mission. If a child refuses a food 
really essential to his welfare, hunger will often do more 
to reestablish his taste for it than commands or threats. 
New dishes or appeals to the imagination are often 
helpful in holding children to their proper diet. A glass 
measuring cup for milk has often inspired interest in the 
quantity drunk. One mother set her two little children 
to running " Calorie races" when they were below normal 
weight, with decided improvement in the quantity of 
food taken. It is worth while to take thought as to 
how to keep children's attitude toward their food rational. 

Feeding from the Eighth to the Twelfth Year 

A quart of milk, continued as the basis of the diet, 
will give relief from much concern as to whether it is 
well-balanced or not. Cooked cereals for breakfast 
should be given the preference, the ready-to-eat varie- 
ties being reserved for occasional use because the warm, 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN EIGHT TO TWELVE 149 

full-flavored porridge is less likely to be tired of. By 
the eighth year, raw fruits can be used more freely, only 
the strongly acid ones being forbidden. For the even- 
ing meal preference should be given to cooked fruits, 
moderately sweetened. Jellies may be spread lightly on 
bread now and then, but preserves should be withheld 
entirely. Dates, figs, and raisins are valuable additions 
to the diet now. Dates and figs should be thoroughly 
washed and drained, after which they may be heated in 
an oven to dry and sterilize them, then cooled and packed 
in jars for future use. Figs are best stewed in a little 
water and require no sugar. With cream, they make an 
acceptable dessert. Raisins should always be cooked. 
They may be simply stewed and served as a sauce, or 
used to vary the flavor of other fruits, especially of dried 
peaches and apricots, added to bread, rice, and other 
cereal puddings, or baked in raisin bread. Their high 
fuel value, rich ash content, 1 and sweet flavor make them 
very valuable in children's dietaries. Dates are often 
used to vary the appearance of the breakfast cereal, 
being cut up and stirred in a few minutes before serving. 
They can also be used in puddings and bread like raisins, 
and make a popular sandwich filling. 

The child may now be expected to eat any mild, 
thoroughly cooked, green vegetable, and one should be 
provided, if possible, every day. Raw vegetables should 
not be made a regular part of the diet before the tenth 
or the twelfth year. Pains should be taken to cook 

1 The significance of the ash constituents of food was discussed in 
Chapter I. 



1 5 o FEEDING THE FAMILY 

vegetables so as to develop their best flavor, much of 
their unpopularity being due to bad cooking. Chil- 
dren's sense of taste is keen in the early school years. 

By the time a child is eight or nine years old, meat 
may be introduced into the diet. It should not be 
allowed to displace milk, but used to supplement it. 
Lean beef, mutton, lamb, chicken, lean fish, such as 
halibut and cod, or oysters are most suitable for this 
period. Fat meats or meats cooked in fat or served 
with rich gravies or sauces should be avoided, as too 
difficult of digestion. Only a small portion (not over 
an ounce) should be allowed and that not oftener than 
once a day. 

Children are generally fond of sweets, but these should 
never be given between meals. Not only candy, but 
the delectables of the soda fountain and ice cream parlor, 
are entirely out of place except at the end of a regular 
meal. Sugar is a valuable fuel food, but with its high 
flavor and rapid diffusibility it is likely to satisfy the 
appetite before body needs are really met, if given at 
the beginning of a meal ; and it is not only likely to dis- 
turb the normal appetite, but seriously to upset diges- 
tion if taken between meals; while in large quantities 
at any time it irritates the stomach and displaces foods 
which serve for building material as well as fuel. Candy 
is too concentrated to be an ideal food, but if greatly 
desired a very small amount may be given at the end 
of a meal, when it will be diluted by the other food and 
do no particular harm. Only plain candies made from 
pure ingredients should ever be allowed. Rich confec- 




Always Hungry 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN EIGHT TO TWELVE 151 

tions from chocolate and nuts are too difficult of diges- 
tion. Plain sweet chocolate is a good substitute for 
candy and so are the sweet fresh and dried fruits. Gin- 
gerbread and plain cookies also satisfy the taste for 
sweets, and ice creams and ices can be used more and 
more for the same purpose. 

Nuts are not easy to masticate, and on account of 
their high fat content are rather slow of digestion. 
Hence they do not enter into the dietary of little children, 
and cannot be freely permitted even during this period. 
When ground to a paste, however, the first objection is 
removed and peanut and other nut butters are an accept- 
able addition at this time. No fried food, pastries, tea 
or coffee, rich sauces, or meat salads with mayonnaise 
dressing should ever be permitted. 

Three regular meals a day will now suffice for many 
children, but if breakfast is light or the child is very 
hungry between meals, a simple mid-morning or mid- 
afternoon luncheon may still be provided. It should 
not be given if it interferes with zest for the regular 
meals, and it should never be sweet, so as to tempt the 
child to eat when not really hungry. Dry bread, 
crackers, or milk are best. Mild fresh fruits are allow- 
able if the child is well and strong. Dinner should be 
served at noon rather than at night, to insure early and 
peaceful slumber. Many children have to take the 
noon meal at school, however; in the country because 
they live too far away to go home at noon ; in the city 
among the poor because the mother goes away to work 
and there is no one to prepare a noon meal, or among 



152 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

the well-to-do because the single school session often 
extends beyond what should be the dinner hour. The 
luncheon of the school child, therefore, deserves special 
consideration. Where the school authorities give it no 
attention, the children usually take their food from home. 
In this case they lose the advantage of warm food in 
promoting easy and rapid digestion, and their minds are 
not so clear for the afternoon work. They are also 
more likely to bolt their food when not eating at a table 
with other people. If then a lunch box must be carried 
from home, special thought should be given to the selec- 
tion of food, so that it may be suitable in kind and 
amount, and appetizing when the box is opened. Three 
or four kinds of food are quite enough to provide at a 
time, for at best the busy housewife usually finds her 
wits taxed to furnish wholesome lunches with much 
variety. 

PLAN FOR THE SCHOOL LUNCH BOX 

i. Sandwiches are the great staple, easily portable 
and generally liked. The bread should never be less 
than twenty-four hours old, lightly buttered and filled 
with finely chopped boiled eggs carefully but mildly 
seasoned ; a nut paste, such as peanut butter, preferably 
softened by working in a little milk or cream ; a dried i 
fruit paste, made of chopped dates, figs or raisins, or a 
mixture of these. For the older children, chopped meat, 
cheese of various kinds, and jellies are also desirable. 
Sandwiches of raisin or date bread without other filling 
than butter will help to give variety. 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN EIGHT TO TWELVE 153 

2. Fruit is appetizing and carries well. Its succulent 
qualities make it especially acceptable with the rather 
dry sandwich. Not only fresh ripe fruit, but also apple 
sauce, stewed raisins, figs, pears, peaches, etc., can often 
be carried by a little forethought in securing small jars 
with tight-fitting covers. Paper cups designed for jelly 
with close-fitting tops are practicable for this purpose. 
Tomatoes are juicy enough to take the place of fruit for 
the older children. 

3. A sweet of some kind should be included, such as 
plain cookies of various sorts, gingerbread or sponge 
cake, baked custard, a piece of sweet chocolate or a few 
dates rolled in sugar. 

4. Some fluid to drink with the meal aids digestion 
and should always be taken. Water will serve, of course, 
but milk will add to the food value and so will fruit 
juices, if they can be carried. 

Plenty of waxed paper to wrap the different kinds of 
food and keep them from flavoring each other should 
be kept on hand ; this is one of the big secrets of a tasty 
lunch box. 

At its best, however, the lunch box must be regarded 
as a makeshift. A regular school luncheon, shared by 
teachers ar^d pupils, has tremendous advantages. If 
only one hot dish — perhaps soup or cocoa — can be 
provided at school to supplement what the children 
bring from home, it draws the pupils together socially, 
so that the meal is taken in a more orderly fashion, and 
experience in dozens of rural schools shows that it results 
in improved physical condition of the pupils. When 



154 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

they leave home early in the morning, travel a consider- 
able distance in the cold, and return only in time for 
supper, the cold food carried in their boxes would often 
be really insufficient for their body needs, even if it were 
in the best form. Recent studies of rural conditions 
have shown that country children tend more than city 
children to be below par physically ; and this is certainly 
not because country life does not offer opportunity for 
good development, but because country dwellers often 
fail to realize that they must take advantage of the fresh 
air and wholesome food which are theirs to command. 
The realization of what good feeding means for physical 
and mental development results not only in careful 
provision of food for the meals at home, but cooperation 
with school authorities in securing protection from bad 
feeding at the noon hour. 

In many of our large cities and industrial centers the 
elementary school luncheon has long since passed the 
experimental stage and is regarded as a valuable part 
of the school training as well as a safeguard for the 
health of the child. Very often the pioneer work has 
been done by women's clubs or philanthropic organiza- 
tions which have assumed the task of demonstrating to 
school authorities the practicability and value of such 
feeding. The expensive machinery of education is 
wasted when it operates on a mind listless from hunger 
or befogged by indigestible food. Whether the cause be 
poverty, ignorance, or carelessness, the child is the 
sufferer, and the painstaking work of the school lunch 
supervisors to secure wholesome and adequate noon 



FOOD FOR CHILDREN EIGHT TO TWELVE 155 

meals for the school children at a minimum cost not 
only brings immediate benefit to the children, but exerts 
a widespread influence upon homes and parents, as the 
children carry to them reports of these concrete lessons 
in the science of proper selection, preparation, and 
hygiene of food. 

The school luncheon must be simple, easily served, 
and economical. It may consist of a hot dish, with some 
form of bread, and a choice of about two sweet dishes ; 
milk or cocoa should always be obtainable. A week's 
menu as actually served by the School Lunch Committee 
of the Home and School League in Philadelphia is given 
below :

FEEDING THE FAMILY 



At 1 1 : 45 in each of the seventeen schools squads of picked pupils 
set up the portable tables in preparation for serving the lunch. 
The children come from their classrooms, form lines, usually in the 
interior play yards, and as they pass a given point take up a tray, 
spoon, and whatever other utensils are necessary. The line goes by 
the large containers of soup, which is dispensed in half -pint portions 
to the children. The rule has been to have each child purchase 
first a half-pint bowl of soup, after which he may purchase any 
of the other items prepared for that day. After buying the soup 
the child passes along the table on which the other foods are dis- 
played, choosing those which appeal to him. 

Behind these tables the picked pupils, in white gloves and 
aprons, and, in the case of the girls, caps, hand to the children the 
desired articles. At the end of the line the associate manager 
stands to receive as many pennies as there are items of food on each 
child's tray. The child carries his lunch to one of the tables which 
have been set for that purpose, where the food is eaten. 

After finishing the meal, the child takes the tray and soiled 
dishes to a designated place, where any remaining food is scraped 
into a pail and the bowls, trays, and utensils are neatly placed in 
piles ready to be washed. This affords an opportunity for a lesson 
in practical domestic science.

values which the children receive for their money : *

If the noon meal is served at home, it may be somewhat 
more elaborate, provided the child has time to eat it in a 
leisurely fashion. When he has to hurry back to school 
this fact must be taken into account, and no extra tax 
put on his digestive powers. The food plan given be- 
low will show the general type of food to be chosen. 1

158 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

If a warm, substantial dinner is served at noon, the 
evening meal may be comparatively simple, especially 
through the tenth year, as also indicated in the food 
plan below. Children of eleven and twelve will relish 
a dinner about as substantial as the noon meal, though 
they will be perfectly nourished with the simpler supper. 
If the noon meal has been a cold or light lunch, then 
the dinner as outlined should be given at night. In any 
case, the evening meal should be served by six o'clock, 
so as not to interfere with an early bedtime. For the 
normal body weight of children during this period, the 
reader is advised to consult the tables giving weight in 
relation to height in the Appendix. A healthy child of 
eight years may be anywhere from 45 to 51 inches in 
height and weigh from 45 to 59 pounds, and in later 
years even more individual variation is possible. The 
energy requirement will vary, not only with the body 
weight, but with the degree of physical activity, and 
boys with their higher muscular tension and tendency to 
vigorous sport will usually demand somewhat more 
food than girls of corresponding size ; hence an absolute 
standard cannot be set. The following figures, however, 
deduced from the observations of many persons on the 
food needs of school children, will serve as a general 
guide as to suitable amounts of food to provide.

CHAPTER X 
FOOD IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH 

With the introduction of meat and raw vegetables into 
the diet in the preceding period, the range of food ma- 
terials available for the child is practically the same as 
for the adult. In other words, any wholesome natural 
food may now be made a part of the dietary, in right 
amounts, at the right time, and in easily digestible form. 
Emphasis should still be placed on foods carrying sub- 
stances for growth, such as milk, eggs, cereals, fruits, 
and vegetables. During adolescence development is 
again in some respects very rapid ; boys grow suddenly 
tall and have the task of covering their long body frames 
with muscle; girls grow less fast, usually, but must 
meet demands for more blood, and take on the supply 
of muscle and fat which gives them the contours of 
womanhood. Inadequate and unsuitable food at this 
time hinders normal development just as truly as in 
infancy, and many a healthy child fails to make the 
strong man or women of which he gave promise because 
of malnutrition in these critical times. Careful training 
from birth will, of course, help a great deal in tiding 
over the adolescent years, but in the storm and stress of 
the period certain vagaries of appetite may develop, 

162 



FOOD IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH 163 

such as the desire on the part of girls to avoid all plain 
food and live on sweets or other highly flavored food; 
the insistent craving for food on the part of boys, that 
leads to the consumption of unduly large quantities at 
one time, — so that wise guidance in feeding is still essen- 
tial. In addition to keeping out of the menu dishes 
which are decidedly difficult of digestion, or limiting 
them to occasional use under the most favorable cir- 
cumstances for taking care of them, there should be such 
supervision of the food eaten that a very one-sided or 
insufficient diet is impossible. 

The drinking of milk should be encouraged, and tea 
and coffee absolutely forbidden. Cocoa or cereal coffee 
in which milk and not water is the foundation fluid 
provide an acceptable warm drink for breakfast or 
supper. Cereals for breakfast are perhaps accepted 
more unquestioningly by boys with their keener appe- 
tites than by girls, but their use by both should be per- 
sistently encouraged. The addition of dates or of 
chopped nuts often increases their attractiveness. For 
girls of small appetite, toast made from whole wheat or 
graham bread, served with hot milk or cream, may take 
the place of the porridge. Fruit, fortunately, is usually 
well liked, and while this may be an expensive item in the 
diet, it is too important a source of body building and 
regulating material to be neglected. People who will 
buy porterhouse steak and lamb chops for themselves 
should not begrudge money for fresh fruit in the diet of 
their children. Those who must economize closely will 
have to depend more upon dried and less upon fresh 



1 64 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

fruit, except as the latter can be obtained cheaply in 
the height of the season. In the country, of course, 
fruit may be canned and so saved for use when out of 
season. The vegetables which serve the same purpose 
as fruit should be used as freely as possible, especially 
in the dietary of growing girls who need a rich supply 
of iron. Salads are usually popular if daintily prepared, 
and become a very useful part of the high school girPs 
menu. They should consist of crisp fresh or cooked 
vegetables, fresh fruit, or eggs, served with a simple 
cream or oil dressing without high seasoning. Strong 
condiments have no place in the dietary of youth, and 
rich salads of meat or fish with a heavy load of mayon- 
naise dressing are a severe tax even on the sturdy adult 
stomach. 

Meat should be provided in moderate amounts, two 
to four ounces a day. This is a part of good education 
for adult life as well as a wise provision for this particu- 
lar period. As an addition to the protein content of the 
diet, cheese may now be used in such dishes as cheese 
fondue, macaroni or hominy baked with cheese, com- 
binations of rice, cheese, and tomatoes, or as a filling 
for sandwiches. These are good meat substitutes, and 
much less expensive than meat. 

A variety of breadstuff's will increase the attractive- 
ness of the menu and help to keep up the fuel value of 
the diet without great expense. The use of different 
kinds of flour ; the incorporation into the loaf not only 
of the raisins and dates already mentioned, but now of 
nuts, especially walnuts or filberts; the sprinkling of 



FOOD IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH 165 

cinnamon and sugar over the top of the loaf, — are some 
of the ways of varying this staple food. Warm breads 
of all kinds should be used sparingly, if at all. When 
provided, they should be so baked as to have plenty of 
crust and little soft center, and served for breakfast or 
luncheon rather than the evening meal. Rolls made 
from raised dough should be baked with a crisp crust 
and served cold or reheated on the second day. Small 
graham or cornmeal muffins, or cornbread or muffin 
batter baked in a thin sheet, are permissible occasionally, 
and so is Boston brown bread if served cold. Griddle- 
cakes, waffles, and baking powder biscuit should not 
appear in the dietary of the child under fourteen and 
very seldom after that. The habit of eating syrups on 
hot breads should not be fostered. The temptation to 
use them to excess is difficult to control, and the appetite 
for more wholesome food is vitiated. In no case should 
a hot bread constitute the main dish at a meal. On 
those rare occasions when waffles or griddlecakes are 
provided, they should follow a cereal or some other plain 
substantial dish. This insures a smaller consumption 
of the indigestible food and protects the body by that 
much. 

Bread and cereal puddings, custards, and blancmanges 
are still the most desirable forms of dessert, since they 
combine high food value with ease of digestion. They 
are particularly useful in the dietary of boys whose 
demand for food is so great as to tax their stomach capac- 
ity severely. It is possible to overstrain the stomach 
muscles by too great distention and thus lay the foun- 



1 66 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

dation for gastric trouble when the nervous strains of 
middle life begin to be felt. For hearty boys a fairly 
concentrated diet is therefore desirable, and large 
volumes of fluid should not be permitted with meals. 
Desserts like baked Indian meal or poor man's pudding, 
where milk is concentrated with the cereal in baking, 
are ideal for growing boys. Pastry should be used very 
sparingly. Custard or prune pie, having but one crust 
and conveying valuable milk, eggs, and fruit, with the 
minimum of pie crust, are examples of the best kinds 
of pie. Cake should be served as a dessert and should 
never be rich. Cookies, sponge or plain cup cake are 
the best types. These can be varied by chocolate, nuts, 
or raisins very easily. 

Regularity of meals becomes increasingly difficult to 
secure, but needs to be emphasized as much as ever. 
Three regular meals a day should be sufficient, but for 
the rapidly growing child of keen appetite it is often 
wise to provide access to some very plain food, such as 
bread or crackers, between meals. Girls, especially of 
high school age, frequently wish to omit breakfast, 
but they should not be permitted to go to school with- 
out any food. " Nerves" are often the direct result of 
undernutrition, and in this period the welfare of the 
woman's nervous system is largely I termined. Many 
high school children do not go home fc T he noon meal. 
In fact, the custom of providing meals at school began 
in America with the high school, and most city schools 
have lunch rooms. Sometimes these are let by contract 
and there is no skilled supervision of the food supply.

But with the spread of the carefully supervised elemen- 
tary school luncheon attention has been directed to the 
real needs of the high school youth and the opportunities 
for education in good eating habits. An interesting 
attempt to help the pupil to choose wisely is shown in 
the Menu Bulletin of the Julia Richman High School in 
New York City. 1

" The result of the educational work done here is clearly demonstrated 
in the change of demand for food. The first few days of the service, 
the candy and pastry tables were the chief points of purchase, more than 
half the receipts coming from that source. About 30 bowls of soup 
were sold and 15 to 20 other hot dishes. Within four weeks from the 
commencement of the service we were selling an average of 80 to 90 
bowls of soup and 40 to 60 other hot dishes." 

The high school luncheon will usually offer a greater 
variety of foods than the elementary school meal, but 
these should always be presented with the fact in mind 
that the young people are going back to brain work, 
and heavy dishes are out of place. The daily menu list 
may well include such dishes as the following : 

1. Soup, as tomato, green pea, split pea, white and black bean. 

2. Two or three hot dishes, as spaghetti with tomato sauce, 
mashed potatoes with green peas, baked beans, corn pudding, 
a stew with vegetables or a hot roast beef sandwich. 

3. Salads, as potato, egg, fruit, or green vegetable. 

4. Sandwiches, one or two varieties each day. 

5. Fruit, as apples, bananas, stewed fruits of various kinds. 

6. Milk and cocoa. 

7. Plain cake or sweet wafers offered only in combination with 
milk or other plain food. 

8. Ice cream, charlotte russe, simple baked pudding, sweet 
chocolate.

The evening meal needs to be more substantial than 
for the younger children. In the city this will be the 
time for the regular dinner ; in the country it is more 
likely to be supper. Here we must guard against ex- 
tremes — too heavy a meal on the one hand and too 
light on the other. Supper should include one substan- 
tial warm dish as a rule. This may be a thick soup, as 
suggested for the younger children, macaroni and cheese, 
a stew or chowder, or a loaf of beans or lentils with a 
cream or tomato sauce. This with plenty of bread and 
butter, some stewed fruit and cookies, or a wholesome 
pudding, and milk to drink, will make a sufficiently 
nourishing repast. Suggestions for dinner are given on 
the food plan below. 

The energy requirements of this period are approxi- 
mately :

This means that the total daily requirement for girls 
from fourteen to seventeen will be from 2200 to 2600 
Calories ; for boys of the same age from 2500 to 3000 
Calories. Very often by this time the full height will 
have been attained and the parents are surprised at 
the large consumption of food, thinking that growth has 
ceased. But growth is not merely a question of height. 
As already said, it involves laying on of muscle and fat, 



170 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

development of internal organs and a vigorous nervous 
system, and these demand food. Furthermore, muscular 
activity, especially out of doors, is a great aid in muscle 
and nerve development, and the extra fuel required to 
support this activity should never be begrudged young 
people. For five or ten years after full height is reached 
their food consumption will be considerably higher 
than that of adults of the same size. As long as they 
confine themselves to simple, nourishing foods they are 
not likely to overeat. Sometimes their expenditures in 
growth and activity exceed their assimilative powers. 
Especially is this true of those who grow very tall 
with great rapidity and indulge freely in active sports 
and dancing. To leave a balance in favor of the body 
it may be for a time necessary to curtail the activity 
somewhat — to insist on longer hours for rest and less 
violent exercise until substantial gains in weight and 
other signs of physical welfare show that the energy 
demands are not greater than the energy supply.

174 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Food for Boys and Girls from the Seventeenth to the 
Twenty-fifth Year 

"A little thought, a little self-control, and then forget 
that there is such a thing as digestion." 

By the end of the sixteenth year good habits in eating 
ought to be well established and the digestive system 
should be strong enough to care for all reasonably whole- 
some food, if offered at suitable times. The food require- 
ments of the next few years depend very largely upon 
the nature of the youths occupation. Up to this time 
the majority have been held in school by choice or law, 
but now some engage in vigorous muscular labor, some go 
into sedentary trades, and some continue to go to school. 
Nearly all continue to increase in body weight, and many 
in height, for four or five years, if not longer. The pro- 
cesses initiated, sometimes with such vigor, in the period of 
adolescence are now more slowly completed. Muscle is 
added, internal organs perfect their structure, the nervous 
system grows stronger, and that fine working machine — 
the adult man or woman — comes upon the scene. 

The influence of active and sedentary life upon the 
choice of food has already been discussed in the chap- 
ters dealing with the adult man and woman. The 
active youth engaged in outdoor labor can thrive on the 
simple rations of pork and beans, cabbage and potatoes, 
corn bread and apple pie, provided they are sufficient 
in amounts to cover his fuel needs. Outdoor life and 
fresh air are sauce to his appetite and tonic to his diges- 
tion. On the other hand, the young bank clerk, sitting 



FOOD IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH 175 

in a hot, close room, with no more exercise than a short 
walk or two, would find his brain utterly befogged by 
such a diet because conditions are not favorable for 
digesting it. He must have the simple fare of the 
sedentary man, in quantities not exceeding his daily 
needs, and daintily prepared, since his living conditions 
do not foster keen appetite. Girls at sedentary occu- 
pations are more liable to suffer from the blunting effect on 
appetite than boys, and are tempted to eat foods of high 
flavor, like pickles and candy, with little regard to their 
after-effects. But the simple, nourishing food already 
suggested for sixteen-year-old girls and sedentary women 
indicates the type of diet which they should have. 

Young people entering the commercial world are fre- 
quently confronted with the luncheon problem. If they 
take food from home, there must be careful selection, 
just as in the case of the school child, and a warm bever- 
age should be added if possible. More and more are 
factories and other commerical concerns realizing the 
relationship between good feeding and efficiency in their 
employees, and establishing their own lunch rooms, with 
experts in charge to provide good food at a moderate 
price. Very often, however, the boy or girl must 
patronize some public restaurant, and here we have as 
yet little guarantee as to quality of food and no guid- 
ance as to what to choose. Those lunch rooms which 
provide plain, clean food under sanitary conditions, but 
without expensive frills in the way of table decoration 
and service, are doing a real service to the young man 
and woman of small means forced to lunch away from 



176 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

home. 1 But the individual must still decide for himself 
what shall constitute his meal. A serving of wheat 
cakes and maple syrup will give approximately the same 
fuel value as one of milk crackers and milk, but the latter 
is much less liable to cause digestive disturbances and 
is richer in building material for the still growing organ- 
ism. Similarly, a serving of baked macaroni and cheese, 
with its accompanying bread and butter, as the main 
part of the luncheon would be preferable to one of mince 
pie, though the cost of fuel value may be the same. 2 

Most young people need from 750 to 1000 Calories 
for luncheon, the exact amount depending, of course, 
upon many factors — the kind of breakfast, the size and 
activity of the individual, and so forth. But even when 
growth has slowed down to these last stages, the welfare 
of the young person is usually promoted by three regu- 
lar meals, each fairly substantial. Some examples of 
simple luncheons in which the cost of the food materials 
at retail is about one cent per 100 Calories are given below.

For the college youth the feeding problem is one of 
adaptation to a life partly active and partly sedentary, 
with some allowance of surplus for growth throughout 
most if not all of the four years. Within the period 
from the eighteenth to the twenty-third year most 
young people complete their college education, and this 
is the time when they should be laying the final stones 
in that foundation of physical health and strength which 



FOOD IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH 179 

is to make their active, working years most effective. 
It is not always realized that these are years for storing 
capital physically as well as mentally. Too often young 
people are released from the safe-guarding routine of 
home life and left to their own devices as regards food 
in the college community, when their eating ought to 
be carefully supervised. The existence of the train- 
ing table shows some recognition of the fact that un- 
wholesome living and physical fitness are incompatible, 
and what we need is to extend this idea in a modi- 
fied form to every student in college — to make every 
college table a training table for high physical resistance 
in future years. Many institutions have their own 
dining halls, where the food can be properly prepared 
and served ; small excuse for these if it is not adequate 
for the students' needs ! And yet, all too often, 
the selection is left to some one with no real knowl- 
edge of the principles of good feeding, whose work 
is judged by the size of the bills and not at all by the 
well-being of the young people. With trained dietitians 
available, this is no longer excusable. On the other 
hand, college students do not need expensive and 
elaborate fare ; and even the expert college dietitian is 
likely to suffer many and severe criticisms from the 
members of her group, because of the different standards 
of living which they bring with them, the bad eating 
habits which they may have acquired in their own 
homes, and the utter separation in their minds of the 
price which they pay for board from the kind of fare 
that a given sum of money will buy. At one time 



180 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Mrs. Richards made an investigation of a college dining 
hall in the University of Chicago where there were com- 
plaints of the food. The students were asked to make 
out some bills of fare which would please them, and it 
was found that to give them what they wished would 
cost about $10 per week, whereas they were paying $3.50! 
It is only by education and establishing confidence in 
the dietitian that such problems can be satisfactorily 
met. 

Schools which do not provide dining halls of their 
own have a responsibility for the kind of eating houses 
patronized by their students, and should at least be 
able to warn against those which are unsanitary. Young 
people of limited means are in danger, if left to them- 
selves, of economizing on food to the detriment of their 
health, and will naturally pick out those restaurants 
where they can seemingly get the most food for the least 
money. This is perfectly legitimate till we come to the 
type of eating house which buys adulterated, spoiled, 
or otherwise inferior food and skimps on dishwashing, 
refrigerator cleaning, and other necessary sanitary pre- 
cautions, in order to sell at a low price. From such the 
college student needs to be strictly guarded. For- 
tunately the habit of " boarding oneself, " which was 
fairly common half a century ago, is not so prevalent 
to-day, and students in general are probably better fed. 
This is as it should be ; for it is a sad thing to see a young 
man or woman of promise break down at thirty-five or 
forty, unable to stand the strain of existence because of 
malnutrition in the critical years of development. With 



FOOD IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH 181 

proper nutrition and rational division of work, rest, and 
play, the college student should emerge from his four- 
year course stronger physically as well as mentally. To 
achieve this is a part of his education. 

Specifically, the college youth needs an ample diet of 
plain food, fairly rich in building materials and "ballast." 
During periods of more intense study the food should 
be specially easy of digestion, without being too concen- 
trated. Such fare as already outlined for the boy and 
girl of sixteen should in the main be provided. In the 
institution, one of the great dangers is monotonous 
routine. A weekly program is made out and followed 
month after month. This is never advisable, as variety 
seems to be essential to the appetite of the human being, 
and the custom is most disastrous for the brain worker, 
whose less keen appetite makes him more sensitive to 
monotony. There should be variation from week to 
week, as well as from day to day, and still more marked 
variation with the seasons. Milk should be served 
freely as a beverage, and will often be found to cut 
down the amount of more expensive food. At any rate, 
it is food which the young people should be encouraged 
to take, and may be the means of providing individuals 
with high food requirements with a full quota of nourish- 
ment when the following of the conventional menu 
would scarcely satisfy them. 

Fruits and vegetables are sometimes conspicuously 
lacking in the dietaries for students, partly on account 
of expense and partly on account of a failure to appre- 
ciate their value, both on the part of the students and 



182 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

the dining-room managers. Nothing interferes with 
clear thinking more than constipation, and the seden- 
tary student on a diet chiefly composed of meat and 
potatoes, eggs, milk, and white bread, is particularly 
liable to this malady. Those who have young people 
to care for should insist on a food allowance liberal 
enough to include plenty of fruit and vegetables, and as 
a part of their education the young people should be en- 
couraged to eat them. If they have been carefully 
trained in eating from their early years, this will be com- 
paratively easy, but there will be some who need con- 
stant encouragement to teach them rational eating 
habits. 

Advantage may be taken of holidays and other times 
when physical and outdoor activity is increased to vary 
the menu by the introduction of some foods which are 
too slow of digestion for the person at brain work. If 
afternoons are given over to athletics and little study is 
done early in the evening, baked beans and brown bread 
will make an acceptable supper. On a cold Saturday, 
after hours out of doors, mince pie or suet pudding will 
be a satisfying dessert. But no student should be set 
to his evening task on a meal of hot biscuits and honey 
or molasses. To satisfy his youthful needs for energy 
he will have to eat more of them than will be good for 
his digestion. A thick soup, and a cereal pudding with 
fruit, along with plenty of bread and butter, will fulfill 
his requirements much better. 

The food of growing children and youth is relatively 
more expensive than that for adults, because of their 



FOOD IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH 183 

higher expenditure of energy in proportion to size and 
the greater need for building materials, which are more 
costly than simple fuel. While we insist on economy in 
the use of food materials, it must be a wise economy 
which avoids waste, but recognizes the necessity of an 
adequate food supply, even through the college years. 
If rigid economy must be practiced, let it be as far as 
possible on the seasoned adult who can best bear it, 
and not upon developing young people whose right it is 
not only to be well born, but also well reared. 

Twenty-five years serve to round out the period of 
growth. Then follows a span of a quarter of a century 
or more which constitutes the period of adult life, whose 
food needs have been discussed in chapters III and IV. 
After fifty one must consider the modifications for old 
age, which are treated in the next chapter. 



CHAPTER XI 
FOOD AFTER FIFTY 

Old age is a physiological condition rather than an 
accumulation of years. Some men are older at fifty 
than others at eighty. After the first quarter of a cen- 
tury, roughly the period of growth, there follows a second 
quarter of a century, possibly a third, in which the body 
tends to maintain a fairly constant weight, sometimes 
not varying more than a few pounds in twenty-five or 
thirty years. With the fuel intake regulated to the 
muscular activities of the individual, and the load of 
work adapted to the capacity of the human machine, we 
have ideal conditions for constant productivity for years, 
provided the stoking of the furnace is sensibly attended 
to. "Overwork" in the active adult period is in most 
cases the mask behind which dwell sins against nutrition 
and other simple laws of hygiene. Poisons due to con- 
stipation and intestinal putrefaction insidiously under- 
mine the body resistance and may be the real cause of 
the wreck which follows a severe strain. The normal 
healthy body is wonderfully elastic, and admirably re- 
pays reasonable care. 

Though a man may not be "old" at fifty — may still 
be vigorous in mind and body — it is likely that his 

184 



FOOD AFTER FIFTY 185 

muscular activity has decreased from what it was at 
thirty. He is more content to watch a ball game than 
to participate in it ; he takes his game of tennis more as 
a duty than as a means of working off surplus animal 
spirits; he walks where formerly he might have run 
and too often rides when he might walk. This tendency 
to lessened muscular activity is accompanied by a gradual 
slowing up of the internal processes demanding fuel for 
their maintenance and, so, with advancing years the 
need for food diminishes. Appetite, however, may be 
as keen as ever; the eating habits acquired in more 
active years are unconsciously followed ; or the increase 
of wealth results in the setting of a more luxurious table, 
and the palate leads far from the path of necessity — 
often into danger. The tendency to increase in weight 
is a sure indication that the fuel intake is greater than 
the energy expenditure. Watching the scales and observ- 
ing whether one is growing more than 10 to 15 per cent 
heavier than the normal weight for his height (see Tables 
V and VI, Appendix, pp. 429 and 430) is the best way for 
one to discover whether or not his food intake should be 
cut down. If the diet has been up to this time a well- 
balanced one, with meat in moderation, fruit and vege- 
tables freely used, and few rich foods, condiments, or 
stimulants, reduction is a matter of quantity chiefly. 
Eating smaller portions of the foods served and chewing 
them thoroughly so as to appease the appetite without 
excess, at the same time drinking water freely so as to 
facilitate the elimination of waste, should keep the body 
in good condition. It must be remembered, too, that 



i86 



FEEDING THE FAMILY 



if alcoholic beverages are drunk, the alcohol, besides 
its stimulating and other peculiar effects, has a high fuel 
value x and must be counted in the day's food supply. 

Up to the age of sixty reductions in food are necessitated 
chiefly by lessened external muscular activity, and 
excess of food is stored as body fat. These phenomena 
cannot be considered as particularly characteristic of 
"old age" as a physiological condition. In the truly 
aged, there is a decided retardation of the internal proc- 
esses, and caring for excess food becomes more difficult. 
There is a tendency to lose rather than to gain body 
weight, as the following figures show :

It is roughly estimated that the decrease in food re- 
quirement due to old age, from the total fuel which would 
be required by an adult of the same degree of activity, is 
about 10 per cent between the ages of sixty and seventy ; 
about 20 per cent between seventy and eighty ; and about 
30 per cent after that. In other words a man who at

ment of Agriculture (calculated to pounds). 



FOOD AFTER FIFTY 187 

thirty requires per day 2000 Calories simply sitting at 
rest, will require under the same circumstances only 
about 1800 at seventy and only 1600 at eighty. The 
ordinary activities of a man of thirty may raise his energy 
output to 3500 Calories per day, but few men of eighty 
could do sufficient muscular work to transform so much 
additional fuel. Their lives are likely to be decidedly 
sedentary; hence 1600 to 1800 Calories will probably 
closely approximate their total daily expenditure, though 
no absolute rule can be laid down. In general, there 
is safety in abstemiousness ; dangers of excess are greater 
than dangers of undernutrition. 

One of the difficulties in true old age is loss of the 
power of mastication. When the teeth become useless, 
it is necessary to provide food which does not require 
chewing, or digestion will be interfered with. Instead 
of the steaks and roasts which furnish much protein in 
middle life, we must substitute milk and soft-cooked 
eggs; finely scraped or minced meats, or easily flaked 
fish. If the gums cannot effect the mastication of 
breadstuffs, fermentation is likely to result. The sub- 
stitution of thoroughly crisp toast or zwiebach, softened 
in milk, tea, coffee, soup, and the like, usually gives 
good results, the change in texture making the food break 
up readily into small pieces and the slight chemical 
change (principally conversion of starch to the more 
readily digested dextrin) being also advantageous. Very 
thoroughly cooked cereals and baked potatoes are other 
useful sources of carbohydrate food. If sugars can be 
taken without fermentation, they are valuable. Many 



1 88 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

old people are fond of sweets and can eat considerable 
amounts to advantage. 

On account of the slowing of digestive processes, and 
the tendency for the digestive juices to flow less readily, 
fats should be used rather sparingly. Rich sauces, 
cakes and puddings, pastries, and fried foods should be 
discarded. Cream, bacon, butter, and olive oil, all 
forms which can be very simply used, with bread, cereals, 
and the like, are much to be preferred, and then in modera- 
tion. Stimulants to gastric secretion may very properly 
be used to aid digestion in the aged. Warm food is 
desirable for the same reason. Instead, then, of a glass 
of cold water before a meal to start the gastric juice, a 
warm beverage such as tea or coffee or a clear soup of 
some kind will be advisable. Unless there is difficulty 
in the elimination of uric acid, the potent influence of 
meat extracts as gastric stimulants may be exerted in 
the form of beef and other kinds of broth. 

With the lowering of metabolism characteristic of senil- 
ity, coupled with sedentary living, there is more difficulty 
in keeping the body comfortably warm, and more care 
must be taken to conserve the heat naturally generated. 
This is another reason for giving warm rather than cold 
food. Even between meals a hot drink of broth, tea, or 
coffee will often prove most acceptable instead of plain 
water, and will counteract the tendency to drink too little 
which interferes with free elimination of waste products. 

With constructive processes at a standstill, or destruc- 
tive actually in ascendance, the need for building ma- 
terials is reduced to a minimum. As long as life persists 



FOOD AFTER FIFTY 189 

there is necessarily some exchange of materials in the 
processes of cell activity, and none of the elements 
already seen to be essential to a well-balanced dietary 
can be entirely dispensed with. But the total amount 
required is less than ever before. In the case of pro- 
tein, there is usually more danger of difficulty in getting 
rid of a surplus than in the more active years, so that a 
very moderate supply is best. An allowance in the day's 
diet of one and one-half protein Calories per pound should 
fully protect the body against nitrogen deficiency. Milk, 
gelatin, and cereal proteins — forms which do not readily 
undergo putrefaction — are more desirable than meat. 

How freely fruits and green vegetables may be used 
depends much upon the individual. If mastication is 
possible and fermentation does not develop, they may 
make up a considerable part of the dietary. But with 
decreased powers of caring for them, they must be given 
in such ways as one would give them to little children, 
i.e., fruits as, juice or stewed pulp of mild varieties; 
vegetables well-cooked and mashed or put through a 
sieve and served as puree or soup. 

Many old people sleep better with some form of 
nourishment late in the evening or when they waken in 
the night. Hot milk, plain or modified with a cereal 
gruel or warm water, hot malted milk, or hot bouillon 
with one or two crackers may be given at such a time. 
If the person wakes early in the morning, food is often 
desired before the regular breakfast. Sometimes a few 
plain crackers may be left by the bedside, some choice 
ripe fruit, fruit juice, or a glass of milk. 



iqo FEEDING THE FAMILY 

By such additions to the menu, it is likely to come 
about that the number of meals is increased in extreme 
old age to five or six instead of three a day. In many 
ways the diet gradually approximates that fed to chil- 
dren in the first five or six years — fruit juices, well- 
cooked cereals, milk, eggs, strained vegetables, and 
cereal puddings making a large part of the ration, with 
simple meals coming at frequent intervals. The em- 
phasis on building materials is less, and hot and stimu- 
lating foods not permissible in early life are usually a 
part of the aged person's menu. Moderation and sim- 
plicity are the passwords to health.

CHAPTER XII 
FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 

Diversity of age ! Diversity of need ! Diversity of 
taste ! How shall the individual requirements set forth 
in the preceding chapters be harmonized so that one 
table may serve all? How shall one pair of hands, if 
need be, prepare the food required? And how may 
there be time and energy left for house and clothes and 
for that " higher life'' of the family to which food, cloth- 
ing, and shelter are after all only the means? Our 
grandmothers have brought up families without any 
knowledge of food requirements save tradition — why 
not do likewise ; spend what we can, take what the 
market affords, and trust in Providence for the results? 
Alas, science has at least made us aware that " mys- 
terious dispensations of Providence" which robbed 
families of health and strength could have been averted 
by a little knowledge and care; that bad feeding kills 
more babies than any other kind of negligence; "that 
man's efficiency in this world, if not his happiness in 
the next, is mainly due to the precautions he takes to 
use suitable food and to avoid dangerous combinations. ,, 
To-day the profession of housewife demands knowledge 
of the needs of each member of her group and ability 

194 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 195 

to supply them under all sorts of circumstances. 
" Happy is he who sits down to the dinner provided for 
him without thought of what he must leave out, with 
a mind free for social pleasure, secure in the skill and 
knowledge of his cook." Happier still the children 
brought up under a watchful eye that understands the 
laws of health and holds them in the highest regard. 
They will repay patient mastery of the A B C's of nutri- 
tion a hundred fold. And some of the rewards will be 
immediate. One grandmother remarked the other day : 
"The modern way of bringing up does seem to make good 
babies." Nutrition as a science is not very old, but it 
has begun to illumine the page of tradition ; and mastery 
of its principles will enable us to proceed with confi- 
dence instead of uncertainty. We have to cope to-day 
with many new conditions upon which tradition throws 
no light. Package goods, ready-to-eat foods, hothouse 
products, strange wares from the ends of the earth — 
we must learn in these to recognize the old familiar food- 
stuffs (or to note their absence) and adapt ourselves to 
the new order. Then when we find that a new food 
product at $4 a pound contains the same nutritive sub- 
stances as milk at four cents a pound, we shall be able 
to choose intelligently between them. Knowing that 
milk and egg yolk, which are no trouble to prepare, are 
better for little children than beef juice, shall we not 
save ourselves labor and often expense ? Realizing that 
the energy value of a food is the same whether served 
simply or elaborately, shall we not be better able to 
decide how much elaboration is worth while? 



196 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

"I shouldn't mind housekeeping if it were not for 
planning the meals " — how often have we heard this! 
There is a sort of inevitableness about meals which 
makes them seem truly awful at times. A hungry- 
family and nothing on the table is terrible to contem- 
plate. But routine (drudgery if you will) loses much of 
its depressing power when our work gains significance. 
To see the children rosy, the family accounts free from 
doctor's bills, and an atmosphere of serenity in the 
home are surely compensations for time and thought 
given to family meals. 

The Construction of the Menu 

There is a steady demand for menus, and they are 
always suggestive. But they seldom fit the case exactly. 
They depend on times and seasons, localities and pocket- 
books, community customs and individual notions, as 
well as the states of health and size of families and ages 
of their members. Hence menus cannot be made whole- 
sale and slavishly followed. The examples which have 
been given in this book in discussing the food of the 
different types which one may find in a family group 
are designed to illustrate principles and may be greatly 
modified without any sacrifice of nutritive value. A 
meal may be reduced to a single kind of food material 
or it may contain many kinds of food and many dishes. 
If there is only one kind of food used, the menu is no 
problem. So the baby, each of whose meals is alike, 
is not the one the mother has in mind when she worries 
about " planning meals." Nor are normal young chil- 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 197 

dren up to at least four or five years of age much cause 
of concern on this account; their food is limited in 
variety and their meals vary little from day to day. It 
is when the choice of food materials becomes practically 
unlimited, when selecting for the older children and 
adults, that the menu looms large in her mind, and from 
this point of view it will be first discussed. 

Types of Meal Plans 

One great help in the daily task is the standardization 
of the meals to be served at different times in the day. 
This will have to be determined for each family group 
according to its food needs. If the adults are all seden- 
tary, and have ample noon meals, breakfast may be 
very light: fruit, some kind of breadstuff, as toast or 
rolls, and a beverage, as coffee, cocoa, or milk. Or it 
may be light: fruit, cereal, breadstuff, beverage. If, 
however, the workers take little food at midday, it may 
be wise to increase it to medium: fruit, cereal, eggs or 
meat, breadstuff, beverage. If the workers are engaged 
actively in muscular pursuits, and their total intake for 
the day must be high, the breakfast may be medium or 
heavy: fruit, cereal, eggs or meat, one other hot dish, 
breadstuff, beverage. For the mixed family group, where 
the adults are not very active muscularly, the " light " 
breakfast is the most convenient type, as it provides 
at the same time the essentials of the children's break- 
fast. For one person demanding more variety, an egg 
or serving of bacon can be added without much extra 
labor. On the other hand, the sedentary person eating 



198 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

in a group of active muscular workers can pass by the 
extra dishes and confine himself to the " light " or 
" medium" breakfast, the " heavy" type being quite 
unsuited to his needs. 

Similarly, various plans present themselves for lun- 
cheon and dinner, or for dinner and supper, as the case 
may be. 

As a general rule, digestion is better served by having 
at least one hot dish at a meal. This may be a beverage, 
and luncheon consist of a beverage and sandwiches. 
Thus peanut butter sandwiches and cocoa are perfectly 
practical for a luncheon yielding 700 to 800 Calories 
per capita. Or the hot dish may be a soup, and again 
sandwiches used to supplement it. Or the hot dish may 
be a chowder, macaroni and cheese, some creamed dish 
on toast, and the like, served with bread and butter and 
a beverage. These simple types of luncheon are suited 
to the sedentary worker, but can be made more pleasing 
to the palate by the addition of a simple dessert — stewed 
or fresh fruit, charlotte russe, blancmange. Another 
type of luncheon, still suitable for the sedentary, con- 
sists of soup, some other hot dish, such as mentioned 
above, bread and butter and dessert, to which a beverage 
may or may not be added. This can be easily varied by 
substituting a salad for the hot dish — giving a type of 
luncheon especially attractive to sedentary women. 
For the active worker, especially if engaged out of doors, 
for whom food must be liberally provided, one or two 
hot dishes, a substantial dessert (as pie) and a hot 
beverage, with bread and butter, will give as satisfac- 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 199 

tory results as a greater variety, if the dishes are high 
in fuel value. More formal luncheons resemble dinners 
in type. 

A very simple dinner will consist of two hot dishes 
(as meat and a vegetable), which may be combined and 
served as one at times, bread and butter, and a dessert, 
with or without any beverage but water. The addition 
of another vegetable will make this more pleasing and 
almost always better balanced. Where it does not in- 
volve too much labor, dinner is very happily begun with 
soup. As already said, this stimulates gastric secretion, 
the warmth is refreshing, and one is in better condition 
to enjoy the rest of the dinner with the edge taken off 
hunger without blunting the appetite. A soup, three 
hot dishes, a salad, dessert, and beverage, with bread 
and butter, make a meal elaborate enough for any 
family. In fact, one of the reasons for difficulty in 
menu making is the tendency to put too many dishes 
into one meal. We may apply to foods as well as to 
house furnishings William Morris's dictum, "Nothing 
is beautiful which is not also useful." An added dish 
should serve a real purpose in a meal, artistic or physio- 
logical. A green vegetable is a desirable part of any 
dinner menu, but two green vegetables offer no enhance- 
ment to each other and rarely add anything to the effect 
not already accomplished by one, while physiologically 
they serve the same purpose and one might just as well 
eat two servings of one as one serving of each of two 
kinds. Every duplication of this kind makes it so much 
the more difficult to provide the sauce of variety for the 



200 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

next time. Potatoes, macaroni and rice are essentially 
equivalents in the menu, carbohydrate foods of mild 
flavor and of the same color and general texture ; hence 
they should be served one at a time and made to give 
variety to three days — never all, nor even two of them, 
at one meal. The same is true of any group of foods 
like sweet potatoes, cooked bananas, parsnips, and car- 
rots — all sweet carbohydrate foods so similar that they 
are both nutritively and artistically food equivalents, 
and where one values esthetic effects to be used one 
at a time. In this matter of food equivalents, minor 
adjustment to individual preferences can often be made 
through the use of leftovers. If macaroni is the starchy 
dish to-day and John prefers rice, which was served 
yesterday, a leftover portion may be given to him ; he 
will be as well fed as if he ate the macaroni, and the cook 
will be relieved of the odd. portion. 

Often the dessert furnishes the most energy of any 
single dish, amounting to as much as 300 or 400 Calories. 
When the first part of the meal is not very high in fuel 
value, this is all very well; but when " heavy" desserts 
are not needed to bring up the total fuel value of the 
meal, a salad or fruit will leave a pleasant impression 
upon the diners, at the same time relieving the cook of 
work and making the meal better balanced. 

Food Combinations from the Scientific Standpoint 

"What foods go well together?" Many housewives 
seem to think that there are laws on this point as un- 
alterable as those of the Medes and Persians. As a

matter of fact, the answer depends very much upon 
whether one is an Englishman or an Esquimaux, a 
Bostonian or a Bengali. Reverend S. Hall Young, re- 
counting his experiences with John Muir in Alaska, tells 
what difficulty they had, when they were entertained 
by the Indians, to keep their food from being drenched 
with a sauce of seal oil — a special delicacy to their 
hosts, which tasted very disagreeable to them. A 
Chinaman does not put sugar on his rice nor in his tea, 
but what American housewife would omit to offer sugar 
with both, unless she were serving rice as a " vegetable'* 
— a habit too little in vogue? 

The study of food combinations is like the old defini- 
tion of arithmetic, "both a science and an art." As a 
science it relates chiefly to the promotion of digestibility 
and the representation of the different food elements in 
the diet. It has been pointed out in Chapter II that 
digestion is more likely to be satisfactory for the adult 
when the meal is not limited to a single food material. 
Thus bread and milk is to be preferred to milk alone. 
A meal composed mainly of carbohydrate material 
leaves the stomach too quickly to suit ordinary meal 
schedules, and so does one entirely fluid. A meal of fat 
alone would offer a staggering proposition to an ordinary 
appetite, and if eaten would digest slowly, giving no zest 
for another meal soon. A meal of protein alone might 
have some advantages in an Arctic climate, since it 
would stimulate heat production and help to give feel- 
ings of warmth, but this would be most disadvantageous 
in warmer regions. Altogether, man finds himself 



202 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

better off with proteins, fats, and carbohydrates repre- 
sented in each meal, the carbohydrates where available 
(i.e., in all but extremely cold climates) predominating. 
To see that these three foodstuffs are represented in 
good proportions in each meal is what is usually meant 
by serving a "balanced" meal. We should go a step 
further and see that some foods furnishing iron, phos- 
phorus, and calcium and some giving " ballast" in the 
form of cellulose are also included, and that the fuel 
value of the meal is approximately the same each day ; 
or, in other words, that we do not have a feast and upset 
our digestions by overeating to-day, and have a famine 
to-morrow, but stoke the furnace regularly, according 
to its needs. Herein lies the advantage of knowing the 
relative fuel value of different foods and different dishes. 
It will keep us from serving to-day a cream soup, a fat 
meat, sweet potatoes (perhaps glazed, with increase in 
fuel value), a vegetable with Hollandaise sauce, a salad 
with mayonnaise dressing, and ice cream with a choco- 
late sauce — all dishes very high in fuel ; and to-morrow 
a bouillon, a lean fish, riced potatoes, sliced tomatoes 
without dressing, and fruit for dessert — a meal which 
may have only half the fuel value of the first one — 
unless we have good reason for making such a change. 1 
Foods which are known to be difficult of digestion 
should not be massed in the same day, or more partic- 
ularly, in the same meal. Even though the family 
enjoys griddle cakes, pork chops, fried potatoes, and plum 

1 By means of the tables in the Appendix, a rough check can easily 
be kept on the fuel value of a meal, without any detailed computation. 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 203 

pudding, do not provide them all on the same day, but 
spread them over four days in combination with other 
foods easier to digest. Thus, we might have cantaloupe, 
grape nuts, and griddle cakes for breakfast one day; 
tomato soup, cold roast beef, fried potatoes, apple float 
and cookies for luncheon another day ; and pork chops, 
mashed potatoes, string beans, orange salad, and caramel 
custard for dinner another day, thus giving the enjoy- 
ment of these more difficult foods under circumstances 
favorable to their digestion, and making it possible, 
where there are children, to provide for them without 
an entirely different menu ; for of course these dishes, so 
hard to digest, would be withheld from children entirely. 
Dishes which contain large amounts of fat and protein 
are always slow of digestion and should be eaten with 
simple carbohydrate food. Thus, chicken salad with 
mayonnaise dressing, eaten with bread and butter (the 
butter in moderation), may make an acceptable luncheon, 
but if we add a cup of rich chocolate with whipped 
cream, the chances of a good appetite for dinner are 
decreased, and unless the person is active and out of 
doors, the effect is apt to be bad in the long run, if a 
headache does not immediately follow. Foods which 
are fried in small pieces, so as to be well loaded with 
fat, are to be used sparingly and in combination with 
those having little or no fat. Thus, fried potatoes "go 
with" lean meat like beef or mutton, and not with fat 
pork or bacon. Foods fried in large pieces are not 
necessarily loaded with fat, but their texture is often 
objectionable. This is the case with fritters, hot dough- 



204 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

nuts, and the like. They form pasty masses like other 
hot breads, and should not be used in the same meal 
with such breads, pastry, or rich cake. 

Concentrated foods should be served with something 
which will serv^e to dilute them. Thus cheese, a con- 
centrated protein food, is served with crackers, or com- 
bined with a white sauce and served on toast ; or mixed 
with macaroni, rice, hominy, bread, etc., lV various 
dishes. Eaten in this way, it loses ics tion for 

being indigestible. Butter, a concentrated food, is 
eaten with bread or potatoes; foods mildly sweetened 
with sugar are more wholesome than rich preserves, 
cake, or candy. Small portions of many foods can be 
well borne where larger ones would do harm, because 
they are diluted by the rest of the meal. 

Foods which stimulate digestive juices should precede 
those which are negative or tend to retard the flow. 
Thus, soup precedes other foods; meat is also served 
near the beginning of the meal. 

Foods which promote appetite are placed early in the 
meal, as fresh fruit for breakfast. Sweets, which dull 
appetite, should be reserved till the last. 

Some people are sensitive to certain combinations 
which others eat with ease. This can be explained only 
by some peculiarity of the individual. Impressions that 
certain combinations do not agree are often based on 
very little evidence ; but if repeated and unprejudiced 
experiments give always the same result, the trouble- 
some combination should, of course, be avoided by that 
person. Sometimes the trouble comes from putting 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 205 

together too concentrated foods. Acids taken with 
sweet milk tend to make the milk form hard curds in 
the stomach, which of course interferes with digestion. 

Catsups, pickles, and highly spiced 'or very sweet 
foods of all sorts are irritating to the delicate walls of 
the alimentary tract and should be used sparingly by 
the robust, never by invalids, children, or any of deli- 
cate dige ' : ^n. 

Food Jibinations from the Esthetic Standpoint 

A balanced meal does not necessarily mean an artistic 
one. Graham bread and milk will sustain a man for 
months, but most people would find it uninteresting in a 
few days and actually palling on the appetite in a week 
or two. The human being exhibits two psychological 
tendencies in his diet — one, to stand by the old favor- 
ites ; the other, to demand variety from day to day. A 
very radical change in diet is apt to upset digestion. 
Foreigners suffer from the strange food in a new coun- 
try as much as from lack of other familiar associations. 
Some one has said that acclimatization is largely a 
matter of getting used to the food, and certainly this is 
an important part. So we find a diet made up of cer- 
tain staples, like bread and butter and potatoes, wel- 
comed daily, along with variables of all sorts, which 
help to keep up the appetite as well as to insure the 
presence of the different food elements required by the 
body. The menu maker needs to steer a medium course ; 
to recognize this love of variety and yet not to cater to 
it to an unnecessary extent. A well-balanced diet, even 



206 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

if monotonous, will be more satisfying in the long run 
than an ill-balanced one. The first thing to see to, 
then, as already indicated, is that the different food 
elements are represented each day in some form. Then 
attention may be turned to that variety which comes 
from differences in form, color, flavor, and texture of 
foods, so prized by the expert in gastronomies. The 
aim of the artist is to arrange a meal not only whole- 
some, but a joy to all the senses. So long as beauty is 
a part of life, and the spirit more than meat, the house- 
wife will take pride in assembling her family about a 
board which delights the eye and " makes the mouth 
water." Her great care must be, if this spirit is strong 
in her, to see that she does not sacrifice real body wel- 
fare to the eye and the palate. 

Not all have a natural gift for making happy food 
combinations, and many have little opportunity to study 
the achievements of others. A visit to a good hotel, 
restaurant, or tea room, with careful study of the table 
d'hote menus, will often furnish new ideas for the home 
table. So to exchange meals with a neighbor and to 
compare notes on menus is interesting and instructive. 
Most home magazines furnish menus, and these may 
well be kept as an aid when one's own ingenuity fails. 
But there are a few working principles which may at 
least keep one from committing great gastronomic 
blunders, and really help in securing a well-balanced 
diet from day to day. 

In the first place, take the day as a unit in planning 
rather than the single meal ; or, better still, plan for the 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 207 

week or the month ; at least remember that there should 
be some variation from week to week and month to 
month. In the country, the natural procession of the 
seasons helps to secure this wider variety. In the city, 
where hothouse products or those from other districts 
press close on the heels of those from near-by territory, 
season is more apt to be lost sight of. But here one 
should learn to use the maximum amount for the year 
in the height of a given food's season. We may, for 
instance, serve cantaloupe in New York from April to 
November, but it is better for artistic as well as economic 
reasons to limit our freest use of the melon to August 
and September, when it is likely to be at its best. 

Impressions carry over strongly from one meal to the 
next and from one day to the next. So, with the excep- 
tion of certain staples (usually mild in character), such 
as bread, butter, milk, and the like, try to avoid serving 
any food in the same form twice in the same day, and, 
better still, avoid repeating it the same day in any form. 
When storage facilities are poor and perishable food has 
to be used up quickly, of course such a rule cannot be 
rigidly adhered to. And in the country, where a crop 
like strawberries must be enjoyed to the full in its short 
season, the effect of variety is gotten chiefly by varying 
the form in which the food is served. Thus, we may 
have plain, unhulled berries surrounding a mound of 
sugar for breakfast, a berry float, or sherbet for dinner, 
and get a very different impression from the dishes. 
So the country housewife welcomes the little book of 
Apples in One Hundred Ways and others of its kind, 



208 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

whereas the city housekeeper, who has perhaps ten or 
fifteen kinds of fruit at her command at one time, may 
get her variety simply by changing the species, and is 
less concerned with different ways of preparing each 
kind. In fact, she is foolish to spend time in making 
elaborate dishes when she can get her variety so largely 
by careful marketing. 

Another good rule is to avoid serving a food which 
gives its pronounced character to a dish twice in the 
same meal, even in different forms. How often we see 
tomato soup, tomato catsup, and tomato salad on the 
same dinner table ! Or find soup, meat, and salad 
flavored with onions, and perhaps onions served as a 
vegetable also. Care should be taken in cookery to 
develop the natural flavor of each kind of food, and to 
add extra flavors sparingly, so that they may be fully 
enjoyed when they are used. 

Serving meals in courses helps to heighten artistic 
effect, and is often easier than getting everything on the 
table at once. Courses should contrast with one an- 
other ; a bland one, then a more highly flavored one ; 
a hot one and then a cold one ; a fluid one and then a 
solid one. The last course should have a pleasant after- 
taste. This is especially emphasized in a formal meal 
like dinner. Some people prefer a sweet dessert, others 
cheese, still others coffee or fruit. 

Individual courses may consist of one or more dishes. 
In general, the larger the number of courses, the simpler 
each one should be. A meal may consist of a single 
course and still be artistic in effect, exhibiting contrasts 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 209 

and harmonies within itself. Broiled steak, potato balls, 
watercress, bread and butter, coffee, and fruit not only 
make a satisfying meal, but show contrasts of form, as 
between the potato balls and the steak; of color, em- 
phasized by the cress and the fruit; of texture, part 
being good to chew, part soft, part crisp, and part 
succulent. On the other hand, a meal composed of 
cheese fondue, sweet potatoes, creamed carrots, baked 
bananas, and bread and butter would be equally good 
from the nutritive point of view, but would weary the 
eye by sameness of color and the palate by sameness of 
texture and, to some extent, of flavor. Many popular 
combinations offer sharp contrasts in texture — crackers 
and cheese, tea and toast, ice cream and cake ; in fact, 
this kind of contrast seems to play almost as important 
a part in creating a pleasing effect as good combinations 
of flavor. Of the latter, there are many familiar ex- 
amples; cranberry or other acid fruit sauce with fowl 
and game, mint or peas with lamb, apples with pork, 
tomatoes with cheese or beef. But it is a mistake to 
adhere too closely to conventional combinations. Goose- 
berries are quite as pleasing with chicken as are cran- 
berries ; apples are good with beef, and many combina- 
tions may be devised which give pleasing effects and 
make the often used foods seem " different.'' One secret 
in the happy use of leftovers is to place them in entirely 
different surroundings from those in which they were 
first served ; in another meal, perhaps, or at least with 
other kinds of food. Thus, macaroni served creamed 
with roast beef for dinner, if not all used, may be made 



210 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

into croquettes and served for luncheon with a cheese 
sauce. Allowing a considerable interval of time between 
repetitions of the same dish is another help in creating 
a sense of novelty. If possible, keep to-day's leftovers 
till day after to-morrow ; repeat a favorite food once in 
ten days or two weeks, instead of regularly every week. 
Even changing the dish in which the food is served will 
often have an evident effect on the appetites of the family. 
Mrs. Richards, in one of her numerous " dietary sur- 
veys," found the girls of a certain school refusing en 
masse a dessert served in a large baking dish. It was 
put away till the next day, turned out in a fine mold, 
and the girls not only ate it, but demanded more! A 
consideration of the menu — the selection and service 
of foods in a meal — is worth while because it will help 
the housewife to make her family eat the foods which 
they ought to have. Skill in cookery and genius in 
food combination are only means to this end. The ideal 
meal is a simple one — whether of one or several courses 
— in which the different types of food are harmoniously 
represented, but not repeated, and in which food acces- 
sories, such as pickles, spices, preserves, and the like, 
are little needed because the foods themselves are well 
cooked and each contributes its own characteristic 
flavor, texture, form, and color to the making of a well- 
blended whole. 

Summer and Winter Menus 

Spells of hot weather have always been accounted 
disastrous to babies. The well-organized infant welfare 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 211 

work of some of our larger cities has taken account of 
the fact that more babies die in July and August than 
in other months of the year and makes preparation for 
a regular summer campaign for the purpose of remedy- 
ing this sad condition. While its activities include all 
kinds of hygienic measures — cleanliness, protection 
from flies, suitable clothing, etc. — the matter which 
receives most attention, as most important, is that of 
food. With this properly supplied, illness and death 
both decrease strikingly. 

In the case of older children and adults, hot weather 
does not work such havoc, but it does render every one 
more susceptible to nutritional disturbances and it is 
well to recognize this in planning the family meals. 
Sudden and extreme changes in the weather are especially 
trying and often go unsuspected as the cause of digestive 
difficulties. When the temperature suddenly drops 
after a few days of intense heat (especially with high 
humidity), one often notes in the newspapers that several 
prominent men have been stricken about the same time 
with acute indigestion, and remarks on the coincidence, 
especially if a number of one's own acquaintances are 
having the same experience. It is quite likely that 
the weather is at least in part to blame, and one should 
be particularly cautious about dietary indiscretions and 
chill when the thermometer is falling rapidly in the 
summer time. 

Before the days of canning and cold storage it was 
often quite difficult to have much variety in the winter 
diet, especially towards spring, when the supply of home 



212 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

preserved fruits and vegetables began to give out. Salt 
meats and potatoes many times formed the bulk of the 
ration, and undoubtedly some of the ash constituents 
were not very well represented, the value of milk as a 
supplement to such a diet being quite unrealized. So it 
came about that a low nutritional state was expected 
with the warm days of spring, and dosing with " treacle 
and sulphur" was not limited to Mrs. Squeers of Dothe- 
boys' Hall. To-day, with our vastly improved facili- 
ties for a rational diet throughout the year, fruits and 
green vegetables, canned if not actually fresh, take the 
place of " blood medicines," and one may expect to be as 
healthy in the spring as at any other time of year. 

But warm days do bring a muscular relaxation which 
reacts on the digestive tract as well as the rest of the 
body, and it needs to have its task lightened somewhat, 
if we do not wish to run the risk of an upset. While 
increases in atmospheric temperature do not affect the 
activities which go on internally, the amount of energy 
transformed in muscular work is apt to be more or less 
unconsciously reduced, and it is well to diminish the 
energy intake somewhat. Even if muscular work goes 
on as in cold weather, there is apt to be a lessened mus- 
cular tension in sleep, or when resting, and even if there 
were not, it would be wise to eat a little less for a few 
days till the body had adapted itself to the weather. 
With lessened amount of food there should go care to 
choose those things which are most likely to prove easy 
of digestion — simple dishes and not too many kinds in 
any one meal. Foods rich in fat, which, as we have 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 213 

seen, is of all the foodstuffs the most likely to retard 
digestion, should be withheld — pastries, cakes, sauces, 
and gravies. Hot breads, particularly with syrups or 
honey, are especially liable to fermentation at such a 
time. Protein foods, which, as already pointed out, 
most deserve the term "heating foods," should be used 
in moderation. The diet should consist of a very 
moderate allowance of lean meat, or its equivalent in 
eggs, cheese, milk, or other meat substitute ; vegetables 
very simply cooked, as baked potatoes, boiled onions; 
or served as crisp salads dressed with French dressing, 
cream dressing (cream and vinegar), or merely a little 
vinegar and seasonings ; fruits, cooked when there is 
any doubt as to perfect ripeness or in the person any 
tendency for them to disagree, and eaten in moderation. 
Cold desserts, of gelatin, cornstarch, tapioca, or frozen 
milk or fruit juices, are not only easy of digestion, but 
refreshing. If taken slowly at the end of a meal, frozen 
dishes will not chill the stomach unduly. This is much 
better than icing the stomach at the soda fountain 
between meals. If it is impossible to resist its tempta- 
tions, it is much better to take a plain soda or phosphate, 
lemonade, iced tea, or grape juice, than to indulge in 
ice cream sodas or sundaes. In any case, care should 
be taken not to drink cold beverages rapidly when warm. 
The shock to the nerves of the stomach is never good, 
and may be very severe. 

Since the body goes on generating heat at the same 
rate internally whether the weather be hot or warm, 
the problem of physical comfort in the summer time is 



214 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

one of getting rid of the heat generated. Any physical 
activity, of course, increases the amount to be dissipated 
into the surrounding atmosphere. We may facilitate 
this heat loss by lighter clothing, by fanning, by cooling 
baths, or by inducing perspiration if conditions are favor- 
able for its speedy evaporation. This is the reason hot 
beverages prove cooling to some. On days when the 
humidity is high this method will not work. The warm 
beverage will only add to the total discomfort. Cold 
beverages will take body heat to warm them in the 
stomach and will carry away body heat when their water 
is eliminated, and therefore they are very valuable if 
not taken too cold or too fast. 

Another factor in nutrition in warm weather is the 
fact that bacteria flourish at an amazing rate, and extra 
care must be taken to guard against spoiled food. Even 
in the refrigerator there is not always safety. Many 
ice boxes are so poorly constructed that their temperature 
rises with that of the surrounding air, and food is poorly 
protected. Especial care should be taken of protein 
foods, such as meat and milk. 

In planning a menu for a hot day, it must be remem- 
bered that eating habits cannot be radically changed on 
short notice, without danger of a digestive upset. It is 
not well to give a person accustomed to hot food entirely 
cold meals. One hot dish can be provided without much 
difficulty — a beverage if nothing else. The following

In cold weather any excess of food beyond immediate 
needs is apt to be taken care of with greater ease than 
in summer, and energy requirements often are slightly 
higher, as cold stimulates to higher muscular tension and 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: MENUS 217 

greater physical activity. This does not apply, of course, 
to one who lives in hot, close rooms at summer tempera- 
ture during the winter months. Most people get enough 
stimulus from the cold to have a little better appetite 
and a little higher food requirement in winter than in 
summer. But the most marked difference is usually in 
digestive power. Dishes may safely appear in the 
winter menu which would be out of place in warm 
weather. Buckwheat cakes, sausage, doughnuts, baked 
beans, and mince pie are commonly recognized as winter 
foods, though it is well to remember that even then 
they have little place in the dietary of sedentary per- 
sons. The man who goes to work out of doors on an 
icy morning will find a breakfast of fried mush and 
sausage well suited to his needs. He can digest fat 
meats and other kinds of food rich in fat without any 
trouble. A liberal supply of protein will help to give 
him a feeling of warmth, and the conditions of outdoor 
life usually insure him against harm from an excess of 
nitrogenous waste products, though in special cases an 
excess of meat may cause trouble. Esquimaux thrive 
on a diet in which protein may contribute 40 per cent 
of the total energy value of the diet, and turn the heating 
properties of the protein to good account in the severe 
cold, whereas in a warmer climate such high protein 
would be at least a waste of good fuel, if not actually 
harmful. But the sedentary person needs at all times 
to be careful neither to overtax his digestive system nor 
to overeat, and children must be protected in winter as 
well as summer against rich and heavy food.

CHAPTER XIII 

FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: COST OF 

FOOD 

It is comparatively easy to plan attractive menus if 
one does not have to count the cost of materials nor of 
the labor required in preparation and service, though, 
of course, it can never be done without some time 
and thought. With plenty of money, the great danger 
is in the line of over-elaboration, which is not only 
inartistic, but tempts to . overeating and waste of food. 
It is better to gratify one's esthetic taste by excellence 
of quality in food and service than by a multiplicity of 
dishes. Especially to be shunned are dishes made over- 
rich with cream and butter, which are not only expensive 
but upset digestion. 

For most people, cost is a large factor in the feeding 
problem; from one-half to one-fourth of the family 
income has to be devoted to buying food, and the smaller 
the income the larger the percentage which must be so 
spent. Fortunately there is no vital connection between 
nutritive value and cost. Nutritious and expensive are 
not synonymous; in fact, some of the most nutritious 
foods are the cheapest. Cost alone is, therefore, a poor 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP : COST OF FOOD 221 

guide for the housewife in determining what she will 
feed her family. She needs to know some of the factors 
which influence the cost of food in order to make wise 
selection, especially if she has to try continually to 
make one dollar do the work of two. 

Factors in the Market Cost of Food 

One of the factors in the cost of food is the amount of 
labor and price of material required to produce it. A 
potato is cheap, and one will produce several dozen 
with very little work on the part of the planter. Hence 
potatoes rank as cheap food Fish, which forage for 
themselves and have only to be caught and brought to 
market, make cheap meat. Under pioneer conditions 
meat is, in general, cheap, since it comes from wild 
animals. But when grain has to be raised to feed cattle 
for beef, the cost of the animal's food and care makes 
meat dear. In this country we have just recently felt 
the effect of the passing of the great western grazing 
fields in the increased cost of beef, and our present 
hope of keeping this kind of food within reach of our 
pocketbooks lies in the utilization of the vast plains of 
South America, where food for the animals may still be 
had for nothing. Meat from Argentine cannot, how- 
ever, be as cheap as that caught near one's own door, 
because of the cost of transportation. 

Cost of transportation played a small part in domestic 
economy before the days of express or fast freight and 
refrigerator cars. But to-day we bring together in one 
market apples from Oregon, melons from California, 



222 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

olive oil from Spain — food products from almost every 
quarter of the globe — and the expense of this trans- 
portation must be added to the original cost of produc- 
tion. The cost of foods out of season is very largely 
due to their having been brought from a distance. 

With the best of facilities for transportation, many 
foods deteriorate in transit, and any percentage of loss 
must also be added to their cost. So perishability be- 
comes another factor to be reckoned with. If a carload 
of peaches goes to market, and half of them spoil before 
they reach the retail buyer, she will have to pay twice 
as much for what she gets as she would if they had all 
kept perfectly. Cereal products, dried foods of various 
kinds, potatoes, onions, and other foods which keep very 
well, are always cheap as compared with strawberries, 
raspberries, lettuce, and the like, which require careful 
handling and will not keep long under the most favor- 
able conditions. With the development of cold storage, 
perishability is not so great a factor as formerly, but we 
still have to add the storage charge, and to take into 
account the fact that foods taken out of cold storage 
deteriorate with extra speed, so that the cost cannot 
be as low as for fresh goods delivered to a near-by 
market. 

Canning reduces the loss due to perishability and 
makes transportation of food products simpler, but one 
must pay for the labor involved in the process as well 
as the materials, so that canned goods are to be ranked 
as intermediate in price between dried foods and fresh 
ones, at least under city conditions. 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: COST OF FOOD 223 

The way in which goods are put up for the market 
will affect the cost. Package goods are more expensive 
than the same material in bulk; small packages cost 
more in proportion than large ones; fancy wrappers 
often bring a fancy price. Elegant shops and immediate 
delivery add materially to the original cost. The extra 
charge for package goods is often worth paying, because 
greater cleanliness is assured, and sealing keeps the 
material in better condition, to say nothing of the greater 
ease of storage at home. A small package is a better 
investment than a large one, if part of the large one 
would spoil before it could be used up. But these things 
should be realized by the purchaser. Twenty-five cents 
invested in two jars of peanut butter, one costing 15 
cents, the other 10, will yield 10 ounces of food, while a 
single 25 cent jar will contain 12 ounces, so that one 
saves over four cents (a gain of 20 per cent) on the larger 
purchase. Each housekeeper must decide for herself 
where the danger of loss and inconvenience of storage 
counterbalances the gain from large quantity buying, 
but the tendency in cities is to buy in unnecessarily 
small quantities, not only because storage space is 
precious, but because it is so easy to replenish one's 
larder quickly. In the country, where space is available, 
there may be the opposite danger of buying in such 
large quantities that the food either deteriorates before 
it is used up, or a great deal of extra care must be given 
to keep it in proper condition. 

Many foods bring high prices because of the esthetic 
appeal which they make to the consumer. Size and 



224 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

shape, color, flavor, and texture all play their parts in 
this appeal. Tender beef is preferred to tough, and, 
since a comparatively small part of each creature is 
tender, the law of supply and demand sends up the 
price. Large red apples are more attractive than small 
green ones, though the latter may actually have a better 
flavor. Olive oil is preferred to cottonseed on account 
of the difference in flavor, though the nutritive value is 
the same. In some markets white eggs are preferred 
to brown. It is hard to separate this idea of esthetic 
appeal from nutritive value. We are all inclined to 
think the foods which we like are good for us, and ap- 
pearance and flavor attract or repel very quickly; but 
so far as real nourishment goes, these things are second- 
ary, and the household provider must be able to dis- 
criminate between real nutritive value and other factors, 
in order to spend her money to the best advantage. 
Just as the finest-looking food of a given kind may not 
give the best return in nutritive value for the money 
spent, the cheapest form of the same goods may be an 
equally bad investment. A peck of apples so small and 
gnarled that more than the average amount of waste is 
produced in paring and coring may be dearer than larger 
ones at a little higher price. A pound of prunes in 
which there is little flesh and much skin and stone may 
be bought for five or six cents, but will be satisfactory 
neither as regards nutritive value nor flavor ; one will 
get a better return on one's money by spending for this 
fruit at least eight or 10, preferably 12, cents a pound. 
A piece of corned beef at 18 cents a pound may have 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP : COST OF FOOD 225 

so much bone and fat that the lean cooked meat will 
have cost fully 50 cents per pound, while a rump roast 
of beef at 25 cents a pound will yield lean cooked meat 
costing only 35 cents per pound. Unless the fat of the 
corned beef is eaten, it will not be as economical a 
purchase as the rump, though the first cost is less and 
the total number of Calories per pound is greater. Fat 
meat is never profitable unless the fat is used for food. 

Market Cost and Fuel Value 

One cannot say, then, that either the dearest or 
cheapest in food is the best to buy. The first cost gives 
no direct clue to the real part which a food will play in 
the domestic economy, and different conditions of living 
must determine what it is wise to buy. 

If our food allowance is liberal and the fuel require- 
ments of our family low, we may indulge more freely in 
food materials for the sake of their esthetic appeal. 
But if we are trying to make every cent go as far as it 
will toward supplying actual nourishment, we must 
think, not only in terms of market conditions, but of 
nutritive value. As Professor Graham Lusk has so 
often earnestly pointed out, it would be a great ad- 
vantage to the purchaser if the manufacturers of all 
kinds of package goods would not only, indicate the 
nature of the contents (as they are now required by 
law to do), but also say, "This package contains — 
Calories of which — are protein." The housewife, 
looking along the cereal shelf, would then see something 
like this :

The most casual inspection of the above shows that 
of all these cereal products rolled oats gives the best 
return for the money. Even taking into account that 
it requires long, slow cooking, it is cheaper than one of 
the cheapest ready-to-eat cereals — cornflakes. It may 
be perfectly legitimate to serve puffed wheat now and 
then, but it should be with full consciousness that one 
is paying about three-fourths for a special mode of 
preparation and one-fourth for actual fuel value. 

In canned goods there is a great amount of difference in 
fuel value, even with the same kind of food, owing to dif- 
ferences in the amount of water used to fill up the can and 
in the amount of sugar in sweetened products. At pres- 
ent the only way for the housewife to protect herself is 
to make her own observations on the amount of "solids" 
which she gets for her money, the richness of the syrup, 
etc., and buy those brands which give the best values. 1

FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP : COST OF FOOD 227 

The discrepancy between nutritive value and cost is 
nowhere better seen than in a comparison of milk with 
other high protein foods. A quart of milk yielding 
675 Calories and costing, let us say, nine cents, is the 
equivalent in fuel value of about one pound of lean round 
steak, costing over 20 cents, or of nine eggs, which 
would be cheap at 18 cents. Even more striking is 
the case of oysters. A quart of solid oysters is equiva- 
lent in fuel to one quart of milk, but will cost from 
seven to eight times as much as milk at nine cents per 
quart. 

In the restaurant, a menu card indicating the fuel 
value of the different dishes would help the patron to 
choose his meal with better regard to his food needs 
and the state of his pocketbook. In the interesting and 
valuable study of 350 portions of food as sold to guests 
in Child s' Restaurants in New York City already re- 
ferred to (see page 176), the authors make the following 
summary of their investigations. 1 Dishes are classified 
in the ordinary fashion as pastry, meats, soups, etc., 
and the first column of figures in the table gives the 
mean nutritional value for five cents for each class of 
dish. The succeeding columns state the particular 
dishes within the class which represent the maximum 
and minimum of fuel value for that group.

According to the above, 15 cents invested in a 
luncheon of beef stew, lamb croquettes and mashed 
potatoes, baked apple and cream, would give the fol- 
lowing return : 

Beef stew 251.0 Calories for five cents 

Lamb croquettes and mashed

Baked apple and cream . . . 196.0 Calories for five cents 

738.4 Calories for 15 cents 

On the other hand, selecting corresponding foods from 
those lowest of their class in fuel value, our 15 cents 
would only give about one-sixth as much fuel for the 
money spent :

In the first case, a man would get four-fifths of an 
ordinary day's ration for 40 cents, while in the second 
case he would get only about one-sixth. 

These comparisons include, of course, cost of labor 
and service, and therefore differ from those which the 
housewife makes in purchasing raw materials, but they 
serve to show that cost offers no true criterion as to 
nutritive value. 



230 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

For ordinary purposes of comparison, the ioo-Calorie 
portion serves as a most convenient unit, and in the Appen- 
dix will be found tables (see pp. 332 and 355) classifying 
practically all the foods used in the dietaries in this book, 
or regarded as common household staples. These give 
only the cost of food materials; they do not include 
charges for fuel and labor. Good food cannot be bought 
for nothing. There are to-day very few kinds which cost 
less than one-third of a cent per 100 Calories. These are 
mostly cereal products, such as cornmeal, rolled oats, 
hominy, and flour; fats, such as cottonseed oil, suet, 
lard, and lard substitutes; sugar, molasses, and corn 
syrup; and dried peas. A somewhat longer list may 
be had for half a cent per 100 Calories, including pearl 
barley and flaked wheat, dried beans, bread, and salt 
pork, while for from two-thirds to three-quarters of a 
cent we may extend our list to cornstarch, cornflakes, 
plain crackers, butter at 24 cents per pound, or oleo- 
margarine, lentils, macaroni, rice, tapioca, and dates. 
It will be observed that all of these foods belong to the 
non-perishable, easily transported class; meat, milk, 
eggs, fresh fruits, and vegetables are not included. For 
one cent per 100 Calories we may add bacon, olive oil, 
cabbage, carrots, potatoes, peanuts, dried apples and 
prunes, and milk at six cents per quart. In the coun- 
try, where fruits and vegetables are comparatively 
cheap, it will be possible to have a greater variety of 
food materials than this without going beyond one cent 
per 100 Calories, but in the city fresh fruits and vege- 
tables will range from two cents per 100 Calories for 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: COST OF FOOD 231 

apples, onions, and cabbage, to 20 or 30 cents for 
asparagus, celery, and choice melons. Most meats ex- 
ceed two cents per 100 Calories and choice cuts exceed 
four cents per 100 Calories. It is by study of these 
relative values and judicious combinations of the inex- 
pensive with the more costly foods that the housewife 
controls her expenditure and yet provides " meals that 
shall be at once gratifying, satisfying, and fundamentally 
right." 

Cost of Other Nutritive Factors 

Feeding a family on a small income is no mean task. 
It demands intelligence and much thought, knowledge 
both of food values and human needs. One cannot 
become a finished mistress of the art in a week or a year, 
but the reward of patient study comes, not only in the 
saving which may be effected in the cost of living, but 
also in the increased happiness and efficiency of the 
well-nourished family and the personal satisfaction of 
ceasing to grope blindly (which is drudgery) and acquir- 
ing a conscious power over one's environment, which 
makes even the difficult task interesting and joyous. 

So far the discussion of cost has dealt with food chiefly 
in relation to fuel value. But we cannot rest content 
with learning which foods give us the most Calories for 
our money. We must consider the price which we shall 
pay for building material — protein, iron, calcium, phos- 
phorus, 1 etc. ; and for base-forming and other regulat- 
ing factors in the diet. Sugar and oatmeal have the 

1 See pages 21-25. 



2^2 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

same fuel value per pound (1800 Calories) and can be 
bought for the same price. On the basis of Calories they 
are, therefore, equivalent. But a pound of sugar yields 
nothing but fuel, while a pound of oatmeal will furnish 
300 of its Calories in the form of protein, and will also 
yield over half a gram of calcium oxide, or nearly the 
whole day's requirement for a man; nearly four grams 
of phosphoric acid, which gives a good margin of safety 
above his daily need; and 16 one- thousandths of a 
gram of iron, which is a very liberal day's supply. We 
shall realize what a very cheap food oatmeal is as com- 
pared with sugar (which seems at first equally cheap) 
if we stop to consider what we shall have to pay to get 
from other foods the protein and ash constituents which 
the sugar lacks. Suppose we buy 300 protein Calories 
in the form of lean round steak : they will cost us 23.4 
cents, estimating the market cost of the meat as 28 
cents per pound. In buying 300 protein Calories from 
oatmeal for five cents we got 1500 additional Calories; 
from the meat for our 23 cents we shall get only 250, 
which is small compensation for the difference in cost. 
From the beef we shall also get about one-tenth as much 
calcium as from the oatmeal, less than one-third as 
much phosphorus, and about five-sixths as much iron. 
Hence, we shall have to go on spending more money 
to make up these missing amounts, and will begin 
to inquire how we can get the rest of them most 
cheaply. 

We shall find that the cheapest source of calcium is 
milk, and, as milk is also rich in protein and phosphorus, 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP S COST OF FOOD 233 

it will be interesting to see with what economy we can 
substitute milk for beef altogether. To secure 300 pro- 
tein Calories we shall require about two and one-third 
quarts of milk, costing, at nine cents per quart, 20.7 
cents. Since 300 protein Calories from beef cost 23.4 
cents, we have saved 2.7 cents, or 11. 5 per cent, on our 
investment for protein. At the same time we shall 
find that we have obtained over 1200 Calories in addi- 
tion to our protein Calories (nearly as many as from the 
oatmeal) as against a surplus of 250 Calories from the 
meat ; 68 times as much calcium oxide, and over three 
times as much phosphoric acid. The only lack will be 
iron, of which we get about half as much as from the 
meat, but here again the milk has the advantage that 
its iron is in a specially available form and more likely 
to be completely utilized than that of meat. Granting 
that we must buy some food to supply the rest of the 
iron, the milk will be cheaper than the meat, to supple- 
ment which we shall need to purchase calcium, phos- 
phorus, and iron, and probably Calories too. 1

the dietary than carbohydrates and fats. This is partly 
because we like them in delicate, perishable, and highly 
flavored forms, such as meat, fish, and shell fish. From 
the nutritive point of view, eggs, cheese, and milk are 
interchangeable with them, and can usually be substi- 
tuted with real economy. The grains and breadstuff's 
can also be depended upon to a considerable extent, 
having about the same proportion of protein to total 
fuel value that we aim to have in a well-balanced diet,

i.e., 10 to 15 per cent of their Calories in the form of 
protein. The dried legumes — beans, peas, lentils, 
peanuts — are always cheap sources of protein. We 
must bear in mind, of course, that proteins differ some- 
what in their nutritive properties, and that milk and 
eggs have a fuller quota of the proteins which promote 
growth than the cereals and legumes, so that we should 
not depend exclusively upon the latter in feeding chil- 
dren, nor, if we can afford to do otherwise, even in feed- 
ing adults. The table on page 234 shows the cost of the 
amounts of different food materials which will yield 100 
protein Calories, and serves as a rough measure of the 
relative economy of these foods as sources of protein. 

It is worth while to compare in a similar fashion some 
of the foods which are the best sources of the different 
ash constituents, especially calcium, phosphorus, and 
iron. In the three tables following the foods are arranged 
in order of the amount of money required to purchase 
enough of any one to yield a quantity of the element 
under consideration sufficient to meet an adult man's 
daily requirement. 

From an inspection of these tables it is easy to see 
that some foods are cheap from all points of view ; thus, 
dried beans, costing half a cent per 100 Calories for fuel, 
are also the cheapest food for protein and for iron, next 
to the cheapest for phosphorus, and included in the 
cheapest 10 for calcium. Milk is a fairly economical 
source of fuel, protein, and phosphorus, exceptionally 
cheap for calcium, and dear only for iron, a condition 
compensated again in part by the fact that its iron is

some of the green vegetables, which in general are expen- 
sive sources of fuel and protein. String beans afford 
noticeably cheap calcium, iron, and phosphorus; and 
spinach and lettuce compare very favorably with other 
foods as sources of iron. Eggs are hardly to be regarded 
as cheap from any point of view, if we compare them 
with peas, beans, and cereals. But if we compare them 
with other perishable protein food, like meat, it is evi- 



FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP : COST OF FOOD 239 

dent that when they do not exceed 25 cents per dozen 
they may be regarded as a substitute for the cheaper 
cuts of meat, and when they cost as much as 36 cents 
per dozen they are, by the balancing of counts, cheaper 
than porterhouse steak and other expensive kinds of 
meat. We have also to bear in mind here that the pro- 
tein, iron, and phosphorus in eggs are considered un- 
usually available to the body, so that their use may be 
justified, even if they have strong rivals in the economic 
field. 

The market price of fresh fruits varies so greatly that 
no attempt has been made to include them in these 
tables. They are negligible as regards protein, but are 
useful sources of the ash constituents, though as a rule 
more expensive than the green vegetables which have 
been chosen for illustration. They are especially valu- 
able in the diet for their pleasing flavors and for their 
tendency to counteract acidity in the blood or other 
body fluids. A food like oatmeal, cheap as a source of 
fuel, protein, calcium, phosphorus, and iron, cannot be 
used as the sole article of diet, because its tendency is 
to create an acid condition in the body, the alkalinity 
of its ash not being sufficient to neutralize the acids 
formed from its proteins. So with oatmeal we need 
a fruit or a vegetable to supply this needed alkali in 
the best way. The same is true of other cereals, of eggs, 
meat, and other high protein foods, with the exception 
of milk. It must also be borne in mind that fruits 
are exceedingly useful in counteracting constipation 
and intestinal putrefaction. In the well-balanced diet, 



240 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

therefore, fruits and vegetables have a real place, 
aside from their fuel and iron value, and at least as 
much money should be spent for them as for meat, 
eggs, and fish. 



CHAPTER XIV 

FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP: FOOD 
PLANS AND DIETARIES 

A simple, well-balanced menu provided from day to 
day for a family group of healthy persons with reason- 
able appetites ought to go a long ways toward insuring 
the continuance of health, and we have in experience 
abundant evidence that it will do so. The suggestions 
which have been made in the preceding chapters in 
regard to the special needs of persons of different ages 
and occupations can be in the main carried out without 
detailed calculations of quantities consumed or of food 
values obtained. But, since the fundamental basis of 
nutrition is in the last analysis a quantitative matter, 
the housewife has a surer grasp on the situation if she 
can now and then make a study of the amounts of nutri- 
tive material which her group is actually consuming. 
She will in this way find out whether there is a tendency 
toward over- or under-consumption, or toward a one- 
sided diet, and can modify her table accordingly. She 
can also discover, if she will, whether she is getting a 
good return for the money invested in her table supplies. 

It is proposed, therefore, in this chapter, to describe a 
r 241 



242 



FEEDING THE FAMILY 



simple way of planning family dietaries and to give 
some illustrations of what can be done with different 
sums of money towards securing nourishing fare. 

Planning a Family Dietary 

Since energy is the fundamental requirement in nutri- 
tion, we must have at the outset some idea of the fuel 
needs of our family group. Let us take for illustration 
a family consisting of a professional man, a woman 
doing all but the heaviest household tasks, a baby one 
year old, a boy three years old, two girls, six and nine, 
a boy of twelve, and a grandmother of ninety. From 
the data in preceding chapters we may estimate the 
requirements of the group as follows (assuming average 
body weights) :

1 Allowing 10 to 15 per cent of total fuel in the form of protein, which 
will be sufficient to cover all nitrogen requirements. 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 243 

Thus we find the total fuel requirement of our group 
is about 14,000 Calories. In the typical family, consist- 
ing of father, mother, and three children under fifteen, 
where the man's occupation is sedentary, the energy 
requirement usually ranges from 8500 to 10,000 Calories 
per day, depending upon the ages of the children. In 
a family of the same size, where the father is doing 
manual labor and often the mother also, the requirement 
will range from 12,000 to 14,000 Calories as a rule. The 
exact fuel intake will fluctuate somewhat from day to 
day, of course, with minor changes in the degree of 
activity of different members of the family, so all the 
housewife need aim to do is to keep the fuel supply 
fairly constant, without trying to make exact calcula- 
tions. A little care will prevent a feast of Calories one 
day and a famine the next. 

Essentials in the Family Dietary 

As a working basis in building up the family dietary, 
it is a good plan to make first a list of the food materials 
which need to be included in the day's rations, no matter 
what the particular menu. For the group which we are 
using by way of illustration there should be provided : 

Milk for all the children — one quart apiece if possible 
Fruit juice for the one-year-old 
One kind of fruit for the others 

Cereal for all the children — preferably for all the family 
A mild green vegetable for the three- and six-year-olds 
One kind of green vegetable for all the others except the baby 
Eggs for at least the three younger children and some protein dish 
(meat or a meat substitute) for the rest 



244 



FEEDING THE FAMILY 



To this list may be added those staples which are likely 
to appear in every day's menu, such as bread and 
butter. 

An estimate can quickly be made of the fuel that will 
be supplied by these essentials of the diet. 



Milk (5 quarts for children, 1 for adults) 

Cereal for all

Planning the Menu 

Keeping in mind the fact that we are going to in- 
clude the above in the day's menu, we may next decide 
on the dishes which are to be served for some particular 
day. Usually the dinner will be planned first, as the 
most formal and substantial meal, and the meat dish 
taken as the key note. Suppose, then, we are to have 
baked fish, as halibut. This gives us a characteristic 
protein food, but not in a highly flavored form. We 
may, therefore, have a soup and salad of pronounced 
flavor, and develop the following menu of simple, whole- 
some dishes of which most of the family may partake, 
thus saving the labor of preparing special dishes for the 
very young and the very old. 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 245 

Dinner 

Consomme 

Baked halibut, egg sauce 

Potatoes on the half shell 

String beans, buttered 

Bread and butter 

Tomato salad, French dressing 

Apple snow with boiled custard 

Lady fingers 

This will serve for the father, the mother, and the 
two older children as it stands, and for the grandmother 
with the omission of the egg sauce, salad, and lady 
fingers, and a serving of the custard part of the apple 
float for her dessert. Her bread should be toasted or 
zwiebach be used. If this dinner be served at night, 
the younger children will have a simple supper before- 
hand; the baby at 5.30 and the three- and six-year-olds 
at the same time or just afterwards. It is always an 
advantage to serve the young children at a separate 
table, at least for all but one meal. Usually their meal 
hours do not coincide with those of the older members 
of the family, and if they do come to the adult table 
they need the undivided attention of some one to super- 
vise their eating. If that person is the mother, she does 
not have a chance to eat her own meal satisfactorily, 
and often goes undernourished. The children at their 
own table are less distracted by foods which they may 
not share, and more care can be given to their table 
manners, — a very important part of their education, 
for eating habits once formed are hard to break, and

Before this is served, the bab^> o'n.Vtave had a cup of 
warm milk at six o'clock, and the thrc^; a-old will have 
his breakfast just before the family breakfast (7 a.m.), 
or, if the hours for the two coincide, he may take his 
with the rest — orange juice, wheatena with top milk, 
toast, and milk to drink. After breakfast the baby will 
have one or two tablespoons of orange juice (8 a.m.) 
and at ten o'clock both these youngest children will have 
their lunch : strained oatmeal jelly with top milk and 
milk to drink, — or milk modified with cereal gruel, — for 
the baby, a glass of milk and a piece of stale bread 
or hard cracker for the three-year-old. It is to be hoped 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 247 

that the six-year-old will hav jj^ $s of milk and a 
cracker in the middle of the morning at school. 

Assuming that luncheon will b .^rved for all the

a little stale bre"^ t Jiew; the three-year-old will at 
the same time;. .»v x -v a soft-cooked egg, some toast, some 
strained vegetable or some of the baked banana served 
in the regular luncheon, rice pudding, and milk to drink. 

In the evening, before the family dinner, the three 
youngest will have their suppers : the baby, milk and 
cereal jelly, or milk modified with a cereal gruel; the 
three-year-old, cereal and milk, bread and butter, a 
little of the custard which is served with the apple snow 
for the family dinner, and milk to drink ; the six-year- 
old, cereal and milk, bread and butter, apple snow, lady 
fingers, and milk to drink. It would be an easy matter 



248 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

to arrange for baked potatoes for these two children's 
suppers, since potatoes on the half shell form part of the 
family dinner. 

Late in the evening (10 p.m.), the baby may require a 
bottle of warm milk, and the grandmother will enjoy a 
hot, nutritious beverage (such as hot milk, plain or 
flavored) and a cracker; but these meals entail little 
work by way of preparation. 

It is possible, therefore, by choosing simple, easily 
digested foods for the general menu (which are good for 
everybody), to provide for the special needs of the chil- 
dren without much extra cooking, even if meals must be 
served at a good many times during the day. 

Calculation of the Family Dietary 

Having now estimated the quantitative needs of our 
family for protein and fuel, and planned a menu designed 
to give everybody something suitable to eat, our next 
aim is to find out how nearly this will fulfill the theo- 
retical requirements. We must make a list of the 
amounts to be served and then, by reference to the 
tables in the Appendix, especially those of ioo-Calorie 
portions (Table I), and those giving food values in 
terms of common measures (Table II), we can very 
quickly estimate fuel values for the day. The dietary 
is given in detail below :

252 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Comparing our totals with the estimated day's re- 
quirements, we find that we have almost our full quota 
of fuel, and a very liberal supply of protein, much of 
which is from milk, so that we know it will satisfy the 
protein needs of the growing children in the best possi- 
ble way. The adults will get their protein largely from 
the halibut, chicken, and eggs, supplemented by milk, 
cereals, and bread. Checking off the list of essentials 
for the diet (see page 243) we find that we have used a 
little over six quarts of milk, nearly 600 Calories of 
cereal in the form of oatmeal and wheatena ; have sup- 
plied five eggs and one yolk in addition to those used in 
the egg sauce, apple snow, custard, and lady fingers; 
over 900 Calories in the form of fruit; 226 in green 
vegetables (string beans, tomatoes, lettuce, pea pulp) ; 
fully 1500 each in butter and bread; and a little more 
than 1000 in the halibut, eggs, and chicken. Hence, we 
have a good representation of the different kinds of food 
stuffs, so that without calculation we can safely say that 
the ash constituents are properly supplied, and the diet- 
ary shows that protein and total fuel are fully adequate. 

Thus, by following a simple general plan, and using our 
knowledge of food values to help in arranging an attrac- 
tive menu, we can get a good family dietary without great 
difficulty, if we do not have to count cost too closely. 

Cost of the Family Dietary 

The dietary just planned will probably cost from 
$2.50 to $2.85 per day, or from one and three-fourths 
to two cents per 100 Calories, depending upon the local- 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 253 

ity, provided milk costs nine cents per quart and eggs 
about three cents apiece. With milk at six or seven 
cents per quart and eggs not over two and one-half cents 
apiece, fruit and vegetables correspondingly cheap, it 
would be possible to purchase such food for one and one- 
half cents per 100 Calories, but hardly for less. It must 
be remembered that in these estimates nothing is allowed 
for kitchen or table waste, beyond the unavoidable losses 
in paring vegetables, discarding meat bones, etc. If 
the cook spoils food in the kitchen, or leaves it in the 
cooking utensils through careless heating or bad scrap- 
ing ; if she is not careful to save every bit of edible food 
which comes back from the dining room, the food bills 
will go up, even though the family has no more to eat. 
Scientifically speaking, bread crumbs have the same food 
value as freshly cut slices of bread, bits of meat on bones 
are as nutritious as handsome roasts, sour milk as valu- 
able as sweet. Every Calorie thrown away either de- 
prives the family of nutriment which it needs or adds 
to the total cost of its food supply. At the table there 
is often much carelessness about leaving food on indi- 
vidual plates, breaking bread or rolls and eating only a 
small portion, and otherwise performing a kind of "dog 
in the manger" act, refusing to eat and spoiling the food 
for others. Careful supervision of the serving will help 
to prevent this, and children should be early trained 
to a sense of responsibility about the waste of food. In 
public places, where strangers are fed, it is not possible 
to gauge accurately their probable consumption and 
serve accordingly ; consequently the table waste is often 



254 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

great, but at the home table, where individual require- 
ments can easily be studied, there is little excuse for 
table waste. 

A food budget of $2.50 per day means $900 a year 
for this item of family expenditure alone. To justify 
such an outlay, an income of at least three times this 
amount would be required, if the family is to have cloth- 
ing and shelter at all commensurate in quality with the 
food, and opportunity to satisfy its " higher " or intel- 
lectual and spiritual needs, such as education for the 
children, books, travel, music, entertainments, gifts to 
church and charity, and other good things which require 
money. 1 

Reducing the Cost of the Dietary 

The majority of families do not have incomes of 
$3000 or more a year ; most housewives must spend less 
than one and three-fourths to two cents per 100 Calories 
on their food in order to have money for decent clothing 
and shelter and any "higher life" at all. Yet these fami- 
lies have need of being well nourished and wish to enjoy 
some of the esthetic pleasure of a well-set table. Sup- 
pose, for instance, that we wish to reduce the cost of the 
foregoing dietary to between one and one-fourth and 
one and one -half cents per 100 Calories, making a 
total cost of from $1.75 to $2.10 per day. In our first 

1 It is usually estimated that, with an income of $2000 to $4000, 25 
per cent will be spent for food, but the family under consideration here is 
larger than that taken as "typical," the latter including only five persons 
— two adults and three children under fourteen years of age. A more 
liberal proportion for food would be justifiable in the present case. 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 255 

dietary we have used a liberal supply of fresh fruit 
and vegetables, and as these are expensive items when 
considered as sources of fuel, we may cut down the 
amount somewhat, using only one kind of fresh fruit 
and one fresh vegetable in a single day, or we may 
substitute canned or dried fruit for the fresh. While 
the milk seems to occupy a large place, its value and 
economy has already been demonstrated, and as long 
as the average cost of the dietary is over one cent per 
100 Calories it can be used freely to advantage. Eggs 
are usually expensive, and can be omitted for breakfast, 
in the sauce for the fish, and the dessert, and cookies 
substituted for the lady fingers. Chicken is an expen- 
sive form of meat and, while not much is used, the cost 
could be lowered by substituting dried beef, without 
changing the form of the menu. The fish used in the 
dinner is usually not very dear and may be retained. 
The consomme adds little food value and, unless made 
of material not valuable for other purposes, can be 
omitted. Keeping in mind the essentials first laid out 
for this dietary (see page 243) and these possible changes, 
we may plan a second menu at lower cost, 1 an illustration 
of which is given below. 

1 The table in the Appendix showing groups of foods at different price 
will be helpful in this connection. See pp. 426-429.

The above dietary calculation makes it evident that 
the changes in the menu have not materially affected 
the fuel value of the diet ; all the items listed as essential 
to the family welfare (see page 243) have been included, 
so that a sufficient supply of ash constituents is assured, 
and the calculations also show that there has been no 
decrease in the amount of protein, though it is high 
enough that some reduction would not have been objec- 
tionable. The reason it remains high in spite of the 
fact that seven eggs used in the first dietary have been 
left out of the second — thus decreasing the cost con- 
siderably — is that a quart more milk has been used 



2 6o FEEDING THE FAMILY 

and the creamed dried beef yields more protein than the 
creamed chicken, so that the final result is quite as satis- 
factory as if the seven eggs had been used. The changes 
suggested in the fruit and vegetables may not always 
mean much saving ; all depends upon season and locality 
and general market conditions. But cabbage is usually 
one of the cheapest vegetables, while fresh tomatoes are 
often rather dear; fine, large oranges are always more 
expensive than medium-sized ones, and the reduction in 
the number of fruits used in the dietary, by the omis- 
sion of the apples, is also in the nature of an economy, 
since fruits are always a relatively expensive source of 
energy. The chocolate blancmange served with top 
milk gives nearly twice the fuel value of the apple snow 
and boiled custard, but costs less than one cent per ioo 
Calories, while the other dessert will cost about one and 
one-half cents per ioo Calories. If these modifications 
of the first menu do not mean the most effective cost 
reduction under all circumstances, they will at least 
show how one may go about the reduction of the cost of 
food, once a general working plan has been thought out. 
Dietaries costing one and one-half to two cents per 
ioo Calories are comparatively easy to plan ; milk may 
be used freely, and a variety of fruits and vegetables 
can be obtained, fresh or canned, with dried ones occa- 
sionally for variety. Meats of choice cuts can be pro- 
vided in moderation, the more expensive kinds being 
offset by the introduction of a meat substitute or some 
specially cheap cut now and then. Dietaries costing 
from one to one and one-half cents per ioo Calories 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 261 

must be given more thought in order to keep them well 
balanced. Milk becomes a more important item, tak- 
ing the place, to some extent, of other protein and ash- 
bearing foods, especially expensive meats and fresh 
fruits and vegetables. Eggs must be used very little, 
except for the young children, and butter confined chiefly 
to table use and those dishes in which its flavor really 
counts. In others, cheaper forms of fat may be sub- 
stituted. 

Dietaries Costing One Cent per 100 Calories or Less 

If now we wish to reduce the cost of food to one cent 
or less per 100 Calories, distinct emphasis will have to 
be placed on the non-perishable, staple foods, such as 
cereals and dried fruits and vegetables, which in the 
main cost from one- third of a cent to one cent per 100 
Calories, and very sparing use will have to be made of 
meats and fresh or canned fruits and vegetables. In 
the family group under consideration, the children re- 
quire over half the total fuel proposed as a standard. 
Their food, as already pointed out in the chapters 
especially devoted to their requirements, cannot be 
provided as cheaply as that for healthy adults, because 
of their greater need of the relatively expensive building 
materials — protein and ash. When the cost of food is 
as high as it is in New York City, it is difficult to provide 
an ideal dietary for children for less than one cent per 
100 Calories. Milk at eight or nine cents per quart 
can no longer be used freely, but with care one quart a 
day per child can be provided as long as the average 



262 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

cost of the dietary is not under three-quarters of a cent 
per ioo Calories. Sometimes economy can be effected 
by buying two grades of milk, the better reserved for the 
little children and for table use, the less expensive used 
in cookery. Condensed milk may also be used in cookery 
or for the adults, and this is usually cheaper than fresh 
milk at nine cents a quart. When the dietary costs less 
than three-quarters of a cent per ioo Calories, a quart 
of milk per day can be furnished only to the children 
under seven or eight years of age, and not more than a 
pint for each of the others. Cheap substitutes for the 
rest of the milk are soups made from dried beans, peas, 
lentils, or peanut butter for young children, and these 
legumes cooked in other ways for older children and 
adults. Cereals from whole grains can also be used to 
advantage to supplement the milk. The purchase of 
butter is seldom wise when the dietary is to cost less 
than one cent per ioo Calories. Oleomargarine is equally 
valuable as fuel, and when fresh is sweet and clean and 
good — much better than inferior butter, which lacks 
the fine texture and flavor which we pay for in high- 
priced butter. Still cheaper fats than oleomargarine 
can be used in cookery, such as the lard substitutes 
made from cottonseed oil, suet, carefully tried out beef 
fat, and salt fat pork. Cottonseed oil is equal in fuel 
to olive oil and costs much less. 

Dried fruits and vegetables must be very largely sub- 
stituted for fresh. Bananas are usually cheap, and at 
certain seasons so are apples and oranges. Other fresh 
fruits must be purchased with care and only when their 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 263 

cost is at its very lowest. Bananas may be regarded 
as a staple fresh fruit, high in fuel value, low in price, 
and easy to prepare. They are often cheapest when 
at their best, i.e., when the skins have darkened and the 
fruit is soft, though still firm. Digestive difficulties 
usually arise from eating them too green or too fast. 
As they ripen, considerable starch is changed to sugar, 
so they have a higher flavor as well as greater digesti- 
bility when fully ripened. Baking the ripe banana in 
the skin, if properly done, produces a more succulent 
food of fine flavor. They must be quickly baked till 
soft and the juice begins to flow, but no longer, or the 
juice all oozes out and they become tough and dark and 
lose much of their flavor. Bananas baked before the 
skins darken will never be as palatable as the fully 
ripened ones, though they are more digestible than if 
eaten raw. Unripe bananas are best baked without the 
skins and basted with a syrup. These may be used as a 
dessert, while those baked in the skins may take the 
place of a vegetable in the menu. Bananas can be 
mashed and stewed with a little water, flavored with 
lemon juice and sugar, making a palatable sauce. The 
many and varied uses of apples are too well known to 
require comment. It is upon the dried fruits, however, 
that emphasis is to be placed in economical dietaries. 
Dates, raisins, prunes, peaches, figs, apricots, and 
apples may usually be obtained for less than one and 
one-half cents per 100 Calories (dates for less than one 
cent), and their uses are many and varied. Dates, figs, 
raisins, and apples will make bread crumbs or flour and 



264 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

cheap fat acceptable in the form of steamed puddings or 
plain cake. Raisins make a good sauce when stewed 
tender in a little water; their own store of sugar will 
make it sufficiently sweet. These stewed raisins may 
be used over rice or cornstarch blancmange as a change 
from milk. Dates may also be cooked soft in a little 
water, then put through a coarse sieve, making a palat- 
able marmalade without added sugar. The addition of 
a little sugar and lemon juice will make a richer sauce, 
however. Dates make an excellent filling for sand- 
wiches ; or chopped dates, figs, and raisins may be com- 
bined. Dates may be served with breakfast cereals, 
being especially good with wheat preparations. Raisin 
or date bread will be appreciated by children. The 
fruit, cut in small pieces, is added to the dough when 
kneading for the pan. 

Stewed figs, served in their own juice or with milk or 
cream, make a pleasing dessert. Prunes are often badly 
cooked and not as highly esteemed as they might be. 
Long, slow cooking in plenty of water to cover them well 
is necessary to make them soft and juicy, no sugar being 
added during the process. When done, they should be 
moderately sweetened and allowed to stand at least 
twenty-four hours before serving. They will then be 
plump and well seasoned to the center. Prunes of the 
cheapest grades are often little but skin and stone, and 
even careful cooking will not make them attractive. 
Hence it pays to buy prunes of good quality. The addi- 
tion of a few slices of lemon while cooking gives a pleasant 
change of flavor. Prunes keep well, and there are many 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 265 

uses for them. Prune whip or prune souffle, made of 
sifted prune pulp and whites of eggs, is an attractive and 
wholesome dessert. The juice may be stiffened with 
gelatin and served as prune jelly. Prunes and brown 
bread may be baked with milk and eggs like a plain 
bread pudding. A prune pie may be made with two 
crusts and a filling of prune pulp thickened with a little 
cornstarch. Variety can be given to the menu by com- 
binations of the more inexpensive fruits. Dried peaches 
stewed with raisins, prunes stewed with apricots, dates 
baked with dried apples in a pie, are all attractive 
combinations. 

Besides the dried legumes (peas, beans, lentils), the 
cheapest vegetables are usually potatoes, cabbage, onions, 
carrots, turnips, and parsnips. While tomatoes are 
expensive as fuel, they have almost as great value for 
flavor as onions. Man demands a diet of pronounced 
and varied flavor; bread, cereals, beans, potatoes, and 
the like are too bland to be wholly satisfying. The 
secret of making an acceptable dietary at a low cost is 
to develop the characteristic flavor of the mild foods 
as far as possible (usually by long, slow cooking) and 
to include in the day's ration some of the highly flavored 
foods. Tea and coffee are most useful for flavor, but 
they lack the ash constituents and fuel value which 
the fruits and vegetables also contribute, and hence 
should not be exclusively depended upon. Too often 
children as well as adults make a breakfast of nothing 
but bread and coffee. Cereal and milk would be much 
more wholesome and " staying." 



266 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Meat is too expensive a source of protein to be de- 
pended upon for this foodstuff. It is to be regarded 
rather as a source of flavor and of fat. A little salt pork, 
bacon or ham will cause a large dish of baked beans 
to be relished ; creamed salt fish or dried beef will make 
bread (toast) or potatoes more acceptable ; a small por- 
tion of beef or mutton will give character to a stew of 
vegetables and dumplings, or to the pastry and gravy 
which yield most of the fuel in a meat pie. 

Aside from milk, the best sources of protein will be 
the legumes, including peanuts, especially in the form 
of peanut butter, and the less expensive kinds of cheese, 
including cottage cheese. Besides the ordinary baked 
beans and bean soup, many attractive dishes can be 
made from the sifted pulp of well-cooked beans of differ- 
ent kinds. It may be molded around a center of sea- 
soned bread crumbs and baked in a loaf to be served with 
a brown or tomato sauce ; or, again, a casserole may 
be lined with bean pulp, the center filled with corned 
beef hash, a cover of pulp laid over it, and the dish 
baked and served with a sauce. Lentils cooked and 
ground in a food chopper may be made into an excellent 
loaf with chopped peanuts or chopped beef. 

Cheese is valuable for its flavor as well as its food 
value. The United States Department of Agriculture 
has published a bulletin giving many recipes for this 
useful and economical food. 1 It will give flavor to such 
bland foods as rice, macaroni, bread, and hominy in a 
variety of ways, not fully appreciated by many house- 

1 Cheese and its economical uses in the diet. Farmers' Bulletin, 487.

wives. It can be successfully combined with lentils, 
nuts, potatoes, or tomatoes, adding to their food value 
and giving an agreeable change from the ordinary ways 
of preparing these foods. 

Family Dietaries at the Lowest Cost 

If we try to plan a dietary for our family requiring 
about 14,000 Calories at a cost of less than one cent per 
100 Calories, we shall find that we cannot afford much 
more than five quarts of milk if we have to pay seven or 
more cents per quart for it ; this will give a quart apiece 
for each of the three younger children, a pint apiece for 
each of the older ones, and a pint for the adults. By 
using butter less freely than in the other dietaries, we 
may be able to provide it here, but to reduce the cost 
to three-quarters of a cent per 100 Calories it will be 
necessary to pay no more than 24 cents per pound — 
the usual city cost of oleomargarine, which may be sub- 
stituted for all the butter. To compensate for the re- 
duction in the amount of butter, some increase in the 
amount of bread, breakfast cereal, and sugar has been 
made. Prune pulp has been substituted for orange 
juice for breakfast for the little children, and bananas 
for oranges for the rest. Cereal coffee to which an equal 
volume of hot milk is added will give the older children 
a wholesome beverage and a cup of this may be more 
satisfying, though not more nutritious, than a half cup 
of milk would be. Eggs cannot be used every day, 
even for the young children, when the cost of the dietary 
must be less than one cent per 100 Calories. Therefore 



268 



FEEDING THE FAMILY 



a rice pudding without eggs has been chosen and cookies 
with very high fuel value in proportion to the number of 
eggs used. Oatmeal cookies fulfil this condition, though 
oatmeal wafers would be still cheaper, since they can be 
made without any eggs at all. 

A meat substitute for luncheon — macaroni and 
cheese — instead of creamed dried beef, and the use 
of salt fish for dinner instead of fresh will effect further 
economy. A rearrangement of Menu II, following 
these ideas, is given below :

Worked out in detail for the family, as shown in the die- 
tary below, this menu fulfills the requirements quite as 
well as either of the more expensive ones. Some changes 
in the little children's meals will be noted, as well as those 
for the older children and adults, such as the substitution 
of prune pulp for breakfast, the use of some of the macaroni 
without the cheese for the three-year-old's dinner, split pea 
instead of green pea puree, and apple sauce for apricots.

Requirement of family 



The protein in the first two exceeds all demands of 
necessity, but not far enough to make it objectionable 
unless it be from the point of expense. In the third, 
reduction in the amount of milk and eggs brings the 
protein within desirable limits, and, since it it derived 
quite largely from milk, especially for the children, there 
can be no question of its being ample for all body needs. 
In fact, it is evident that in this last dietary we have 
not reached the lowest cost at which it is possible to 
maintain our family, though we have reached the lowest 
point at which it can be done easily with prices as high 
as those of New York City. In any further reduction 
especial care will have to be taken to keep the protein 
and ash constituents adequate, as these are expensive 
items in any dietary. It becomes increasingly difficult 
to provide variety of diet. Cereal products, dried beans 
and peas, a few staple fresh vegetables, such as potatoes, 
onions, cabbage, and tomatoes in limited quantities, 
dried fruits, and one or two fresh ones, as apples and 
bananas, very fat meats, such as fat beef plate and fat 
salt pork, and a limited amount of milk must be the 
chief reliance of the housewife. The temptation is 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 273 

often great to use large quantities of sugar and syrup 
or molasses rather than cereals, because of the high 
flavor and the fact that these require no cooking. But 
the ash constituents of the grains and legumes assume 
greater importance when fruits, vegetables, and milk 
must be limited, and it is worth while to try to make 
acceptable as much oatmeal, barley, buckwheat, whole 
wheat preparations, beans, peas, and the like as one 
possibly can, these being also good sources of protein. 
The needs of the children cannot be ideally met when the 
dietary falls to two-thirds of a cent per 100 Calories, ex- 
cept in districts where milk and fruit and vegetables are 
very cheap. With a limited number of foods to choose 
from, the day's menu will be very simple, variety being 
obtained by changes from day to day rather than by a 
number of different dishes in one meal. The following 
menu and dietary illustrate what can be done for about 
two-thirds of a cent per 100 Calories, allowing one quart 
of milk for each of the two youngest children, a pint 
for each of the others and one pint for the adults — 
four quarts in all.

FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 277 

Dried apples have been substituted for fresh fruit for 
breakfast, and stewed raisins for stewed apricots, corn- 
meal for farina, samp for macaroni, oleomargarine for 
butter, oatmeal wafers without eggs for oatmeal cookies, 
date pudding with brown sugar sauce for rice pudding with 
milk and sugar. Thus the cost has been reduced without 
any material change in the amount of fuel or of the ash 
constituents. Beef has been substituted for fish for din- 
ner because it has more fat and also gives more flavor. 

The children whose supply of milk has been limited 
have been given warm beverages (cereal coffee and 
cocoa) to make their small allowance of milk more 
attractive. The sugar and cocoa also contribute to 
the total fuel value of their dietary. Other modifi- 
cations or additions to the menu are indicated in the 
dietary. The sausage put in for breakfast for the father 
and the mother adds to the flavor of that meal, making the 
cornmeal mush and bread more acceptable ; the fat is a 
cheaper source of fuel than oleomargarine, and the protein 
makes up for some of that lost by cutting down the milk. 
Instead of using the fat on the bread, one might fry the 
cornmeal mush for the adults in it for a change, and serve 
this with syrup, leaving more milk for the children. 

Some changes in the children's meals have been made, 
either for economy, or to save extra cooking, or to supply 
a more digestible food than that provided in the meals 
for the older members of the family. Oatmeal is used 
instead of cornmeal for the three-year-old's breakfast, 
as better suited to his digestive powers. Prune pulp 
has been retained for the baby for the same reason. No 



278 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

change has been made in the morning lunches except a 
decrease in the amount of milk and an increase in the 
number of crackers for the six-year-old child. The egg 
has been omitted from the baby's two o'clock meal for 
the sake of economy. An egg yolk should be given a 
couple of times a week, even if it cannot be afforded 
every day. Baked potato and more oleomargarine 
take the place of the macaroni with egg for the three- 
year-old. This change decreases the amount of pro- 
tein, but with the full allowance of milk this is of no 
particular importance. The use of whole wheat bread 
to compensate for some of the iron lost by not using 
eggs for these two young children would be advisable. 

If the dietary must be kept under a cost of two-thirds 
of a cent per 100 Calories, not more than three quarts of 
milk can usually be allowed, and, if possible, one of 
these should be bought for six cents a quart, this milk 
to be cooked in all cases. The two quarts of good grade 
must be reserved for the two youngest children, and the 
other distributed as the menu demands. Some menus 
which will supply a balanced ration under these condi- 
tions are given below. 

Menus for Very Low-Priced Family Dietaries 
(allowing three quarts of milk per day) 

I. Breakfast: 

. ' J fried and served with corn syrup for adults 
1 steamed and served with milk for children 
Bread 

Oleomargarine 
Coffee for adults 
Apple sauce or date pulp for 3 -year-old ; orange juice for baby 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 279 

Luncheon or Supper: 

Pork and beans — bean soup for young children 

Bread 

Oleomargarine 

Tea with milk and sugar for adults 

Milk for youngest children 

Cereal coffee or cocoa for older children 

Dinner: , 

Lentil soup 

Hashed browned potatoes 
Bread 

Oleomargarine 
Tea for adults 
Milk for youngest children . 
Dried apple and date pie with cheese, for father, mother, and 

oldest child 
Dried apple sauce for others 

The breakfast and morning lunches for the children 
will be practically the same in all these menus, follow- 
ing the plan in Dietary IV. 1 The afternoon lunches 
will follow the family luncheon as closely as possible. 
In the menu above, part of the beans are put through 
a sieve and made into soup for the two o'clock dinner 
of the little ones. Baked potato and baked apple 
or stewed prunes may be used for the three-year-old, 
as in Dietary IV. 2 

The half past five meal for the baby will not change 
with changes in the menu for the rest of the group. 
Other suggestions for the three-year-old will be found in 
the chapter on feeding young children (pages 128-134). 

*Page 274. 2 Page 275. 



2 8o FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Lentil soup with bread may here take the place of cream 
toast, and cornmeal mush, if cooked all day, may be 
substituted for the rice pudding. Little change can be 
made in the night lunches. 

Since the meals for the two youngest and the supper 
for the six-year-old cannot follow the regular family 
menu, and are very simple, no attempt has been made 
to describe them in detail, but suggestive notes with 
each menu will indicate ways of adapting these to the 
children, thus saving extra labor. 

II. Breakfast: 

Hominy with milk and sugar 

Fried potatoes 1 for ^^ and oMest chad 

Baking powder biscuit J 

Toast and milk for other children 

Coffee for adults 

Apple sauce, prune pulp, or orange juice for two youngest 

Luncheon or Supper: 

Vegetable soup with croutons 

Whole wheat bread 

Peanut butter 

Stewed dried peaches with raisins 

Dinner : 

Pork sausage baked with parsnips 

Baked potatoes 

Bread 

Oleomargarine 

Steamed cranberry pudding 

Everyday sauce, 1 flavored with nutmeg 

1 Water, cornstarch, sugar, and oleomargarine. 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 281 

This menu can be quite easily adapted to the chil- 
dren's needs. Their breakfasts will be like those in 
Dietary IV, 1 except that hominy may be substituted 
for oatmeal if hominy grits be used. Vegetable soup 
put through a sieve will serve for the two o'clock 
dinner of the three-year-old, and bread and peanut 
butter take the place of the baked potato ; stewed dried 
peaches that of the baked apple. The family evening 
meal is not suited to the requirements of the young 
children. For their half past five supper, some such 
plan as outlined in Dietary IV 2 had best be followed. 

III. Breakfast : 

Farina with milk and sugar 

Graham gems baked in a thin sheet 

Brown sugar syrup 

Cereal coffee for all but two youngest children 

Milk for two youngest children 

Luncheon or Supper: 
Split pea soup 
Bread 

Oleomargarine 
Sliced bananas with sugar 
Gingerbread 

Dinner : 

Lentil-meat loaf 
Tomato sauce 
Mashed potatoes 
Scalloped dried apples 
Cocoa for children 
Tea for adults 

1 Page 274. 2 Page 276. 



282 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Baking the gems in a thin sheet will make them suit- 
able for all but the two youngest children. The syrup 
should be given very sparingly, if at all, to the children. 
The split pea soup can be used for the three-year-old's 
dinner and the six-year-old's supper. Gingerbread and 
scalloped apples may also be served for the latter 's 
supper. 

IV. Breakfast:

Corned beef hash

Tapioca-Indian meal pudding with raisins 
Milk for children

Dinner :

Baked potatoes 
Rye bread 
Oleomargarine 
Dried peach pudding 

Part of the baked beans can be put through a 
sieve and made into soup for the three-year-old's din- 
ner and the six-year-old's supper. Junket can easily 
be made for dessert for the children's half past five 
supper. 



FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES 283 

V. Breakfast: 

Flaked wheat with milk and sugar 
Buckwheat cakes with corn syrup 
Coffee for adults 
Cocoa for children 

Luncheon or Supper: 

Escalloped potatoes with cheese 

German coffee bread 

Oleomargarine 

Apricot tapioca with caramel sauce 

Tea for adults 

Cereal coffee for children 

Dinner :

Potato soup may be made for the three-year-old's 
luncheon, and the six-year-old's supper. For the latter, 
thoroughly toasted coffee bread will also be acceptable. 
All except the baby may have the apricot tapioca, but 
it should be served with milk instead of sauce for the 
three- and six-year-old children. 

VI. Breakfast: 

Oatmeal mush with milk and sugar 
Cornbread baked in a thin sheet 
Oleomargarine 
Coffee for adults 
Cereal coffee for children 



284 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Luncheon or Supper: 

Corn chowder with croutons 
Rye bread and oleomargarine 
Stewed prunes 
Tea for adults 

Dinner: 

Baked split peas with bacon 
Cabbage and potato salad 
Molasses cake 
Cocoa 

Some of the corn chowder can be put through a sieve 
and some of the baked split peas made into a puree 
for the three-year-old's dinner and supper. Rice molded 
and served with prunes would make a good dessert for 
the young children. 



CHAPTER XV 
FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 

A discussion of the problems of feeding a family 
would be incomplete without some reference to the care 
of the sick and convalescent. Few families are so for- 
tunate as to escape illness entirely. Good feeding is 
one of the greatest factors in maintaining health, but it 
must be supported by other conditions fostering nutri- 
tion, such as sanitary and cheerful surroundings, free- 
dom from chill, exhaustion, overwork, or worry. A well- 
fed person is much better able to resist the attacks of 
harmful bacteria than an undernourished one, but if 
their number is very great on account of impure water 
or food, they may overwhelm his strong defenses. Thus 
the best care to set a well-balanced table may fail to 
maintain health if the housewife works without the help 
of the community in securing a sanitary environment. 
Personal infringements on the laws of health, other 
than those in regard to food, undermine the resistance 
of the body to disease ; fatigue, and chill, often, for in- 
stance, pave the way to colds and indigestion, which 
in their turn lower resistance still more. Then a stray 
germ which would be promptly destroyed if the person 
were in vigorous health, may find a favorable soil in 

28s 



286 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

which to flourish. So, in one way and another, illness 
may enter the home where food is dispensed with intelli- 
gent care, and special adaptations of the diet to the 
needs of the patient have to be considered. 

When the case is serious enough to demand the care 
of a physician, he will give advice concerning the diet, 
and his directions should be implicitly obeyed. It 
requires knowledge and experience to diagnose disease 
and prescribe suitable food, and no book can take the 
place of the skillful doctor. In sickness, even more 
than in health, every person is a law unto himself and 
all rules must be modified according to the requirements 
of the individual. This can be done successfully only 
by one who is able to judge accurately the patient's true 
condition. 

The physician's advice is, however, often very general, 
especially where the diet is not a prominent factor in 
the treatment, and the home nurse is frequently at a loss 
to know how to carry out his instructions to the best 
advantage. She must obey the doctor, please the patient 
and not over-strain the family pocket book, and some- 
times the three seem quite irreconcilable. Moreover, 
many minor disturbances for which no physician is called 
require some modification of the ordinary family diet. 
The better the general principles of feeding are understood, 
the more successfully such emergencies can be met, 
especially if this knowledge is supplemented by some 
acquaintance with the lines of dietetic treatment which 
have proven most successful in practice. 

At the outset one must free one's mind from any 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 287 

notion that any particular food is a specific for any dis- 
ease. As has already been pointed out, there are in 
health many choices of food, whether for fuel, building, 
or regulating materials. So in sickness, though the 
range of choice may be more limited, some flexibility is 
usually possible. There is no magic diet for any dis- 
ease. Even in the well-known case of diabetes, where 
the power to utilize carbohydrates is reduced to a low 
plane or lost, the avoidance of certain articles of food, 
while it may be important, is by no means the only 
feature of the diet. The aim of this chapter is to point 
out a few dietetic procedures which conform to the 
general principles involved and which have been shown 
by experience to be "safe and sane." For more detailed 
suggestions and other modes of treatment, the reader 
must consult the specialist in nutrition or refer to the 
writings of experts in the treatment of any particular 
disease. 1 

Energy Requirements in Sickness 

In sickness, as in health, the internal work of the 
body goes on at the rate of about two-fifths of a Calorie 
per pound per hour during sleep and about three-fifths of 
a Calorie per pound per hour during waking hours spent 
in bed. Seldom is the expenditure of energy less in sick- 
ness than under the same conditions of activity in health, 
and it may be more, particularly in cases of fever. In the 
first few days of illness, fasting or taking of very little 

1 Much practical information about feeding in disease is to be found 
in Diet in Health and Disease by Friedenwald and Ruhrah. 



288 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

food does no harm and has the advantage of giving the 
digestive tract a chance to rest. But the energy for 
body work must still be supplied, so it is drawn from the 
reserves of the body itself at the rate of about one-half 
a Calorie per pound per hour for the 24-hour day, if the 
patient is lying quietly in bed ; in other words, a man 
of average weight, confined to his bed, will need about 
1850 Calories per day. How long it will be wise to 
depend upon the body to furnish its own fuel wholly or 
in part depends upon circumstances. In disturbances 
of short duration, such as attacks of acute indigestion, 
it is quite safe to fast one to three days, or until the cause 
of disturbance is removed. Nature will quickly bring 
the digestive tract back to normal, so that in a few 
days a simple diet ample for all body needs can safely 
be taken. But in disease which is likely to run a 
long course and draw severely upon body tissues, food 
for fuel must be supplied as nearly as possible in accord- 
ance with energy expenditure, to save the patient from 
being very much weakened and having to undergo a 
long period of convalescence to regain what he has lost. 

Fluid Diet 

When for any reason the person is below par phys- 
ically, care must be taken to provide a diet easy of 
digestion. Some of the ways in which this may be done 
have already been considered in Chapter II. Since all 
food must eventually be reduced to fluid form for ab- 
sorption, a liquid diet is usually regarded as the type 
easiest to digest, and is often prescribed by the physician. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 289 

By this he means a diet which includes : (1) broths and 
clear soups of various kinds; (2) beef juice and tea; 
(3) cereal gruels; (4) milk, either plain or modified in 
such a way as to make it more digestible, more nutri- 
tious, or more attractive to the patient ; (5) raw eggs in 
combination with water, milk, fruit juices, cocoa, or 
other fluid ; (6) cream soups of various kinds. 

Broths and clear soups and beef tea have little or no 
fuel value, from a pint to a quart being required to yield 
100 Calories. Their chief virtues are that they are 
agreeable to taste, comforting when hot or refreshing 
when cold, and when they contain meat extracts (as 
they usually do) stimulating to the flow of the gastric 
juice. Broths can be made the carriers of extra nutri- 
ment by the addition of eggs, by thickening with cereal 
flours, such as barley or rice flour, or by combination 
with ordinary cereal gruels. 

Beef juice, made by pressing the juice from slightly 
warmed beef or from finely chopped beef which with a 
little added water has been kept at a temperature of 150 
F. for two hours (to draw out the juice) has a fuel value 
of about 100 Calories per pint. It is an expensive fuel, 
since a pound of lean meat yields only about four ounces 
(| cup) of juice, or about 25 Calories. It ranks with 
eggs and milk as an easily digested protein food, but it 
is not as attractive in flavor as beef broth or beef tea, 
and is served only in small quantities. 

Cereal gruels are useful in many cases in which the 
appetite is poor or the digestive and assimilative powers 
very weak. They are neither stimulating nor irritating 



290 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

and are rapidly digested and absorbed. When made 
from cereal flours, one ounce (4 level tablespoonfuls) to 
the quart, they have a fuel value of from 70 to 90 Calories 
per quart. They may be made as thick as two ounces 
to the quart, doubling their fuel value (140 to 180 Calories 
per quart). If the cereal gruel is dextrinized, 1 thus 
rendering it more fluid, as high as six ounces may be 
used per quart, the fuel value then ranging between 400 
and 600 Calories per quart, according to the kind of 
cereal flour used. It is evident that a man could not 
drink enough thin cereal gruel to furnish a day's quota 
of energy, and of a thick gruel dextrinized he would 
have to drink three or four quarts. The virtue lies in 
allaying hunger and thirst and furnishing a little bland, 
easily digested food. Like broths, gruels may be en- 
riched by the addition of eggs, cream, or milk. 

Milk is one of the most valuable foods for the sick- 
room. It is for most people easy of digestion in its 
natural state, if taken slowly, and can be made still 
more digestible in various ways. As already pointed out 
many times, it contains all kinds of material required 
by the body, and may be considered as "a diet" in itself. 
Its usefulness can often be increased (1) by changing 
its flavor, which is not always agreeable, especially to 
adults, (2) by altering the relative proportions of protein, 
fat, and carbohydrate, or (3) by combining it with some- 



1 Cereal gruels are dextrinized by adding to the cooked gruel, when 
cooled to about ioo° F., a small amount of a commercial preparation of 
malt diastase. This causes the thick gruel to liquefy rapidly by changing 
the starch into dextrins and malt sugar. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 291 

thing which prevents the formation of large or hard 
curds in the stomach. The general principles of milk 
modification have already been discussed in Chapter V. 
They* are applicable in all cases where digestion and 
assimilation are concerned, as well as in the feeding of 
infants. Just how milk shall be prepared depends upon 
the individual to be fed. "Some like it hot, some like 
it cold," and a few like it warm from the cow. Those 
who find its sweetness unpleasant often enjoy the mild 
acid flavor of buttermilk and zoolak or the faint tang 
of fermented milk (kumiss). Coffee, tea, or cocoa 
may be added for their flavor; malted milk not only 
changes the taste but adds to the fuel value and ease 
of digestion. With malted milk a number of different 
flavors are possible. For example, it may be served 
hot, slightly salted, or cold with a little fruit juice and 
sugar. Cereal gruels are added to milk chiefly to make 
it easier to digest. Raw eggs add to its food value and 
the eggnog may be flavored in a variety of ways — with 
vanilla, nutmeg, coffee, beef broth, or pineapple juice. 
Since whole milk has a fuel value of about 675 Calories 
per quart, it follows that three quarts of milk will cover 
the energy requirement of the average man in bed, 
unless his disease is one demanding an extraordinary 
amount of fuel. Two and one-half quarts of milk plus 
two eggs will yield the same amount of energy in a little 
less bulky form. By the addition of some cream the 
volume may be reduced still further with ease. 

What are known as " albuminized " beverages are in 
reality combinations of white of egg (a kind of protein 



292 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

called albumin) with various fluids, such as milk, broth, 
orange, lemon, pineapple, or grape juice, or even water 
alone to make a soothing drink of some nutritive value, 
to be taken when the irritability of the digestive tract is 
particularly great. The white of one egg has an aver- 
age fuel value of 13 or 14 Calories. One white com- 
bined with half a cup of milk results in a drink yielding 
nearly 100 Calories. One white plus the juice of one 
medium sized orange and a teaspoonful of sugar will 
supply from 55 to 60 Calories. 1 

More nourishment is gained, of course, by introduc- 
ing the yolk as well as the white of the egg. An eggnog 
made with one egg, three-fourths of a cup of milk, 
three-fourths of a tablespoonful of sugar, and one table- 
spoonful of brandy will yield about 230 Calories ; others 
will yield from 125 to 200 Calories. All of these present 
the egg in agreeable fluid forms which can be adapted to 
the palate of the most fastidious. Indeed, the chief 
reliance for nourishment in fluid diet, it will be perceived, 
is upon milk and eggs. Even cream soups generally 
owe their food value largely to milk and are to be re- 
garded as among the devices for making milk acceptable. 
Several illustrations of the nutritive value of cream 
soups will be found among the Dietary Recipes of Table 
III, in the Appendix. 

If a fluid diet is to be maintained but for a short 
time (a few days), no attempt is usually made to meet 
the full energy requirement of the patient. The diet

relieves sensations of hunger and thirst, and the dilute 
food has a better chance of digestion than more concen- 
trated would have, for, when one is not taking any 
exercise, body processes are apt to be sluggish. The 
fluid diet should be administered in small amounts at 
frequent intervals. A liquid meal leaves the stomach 
quickly and enters the circulation quickly. If meals are 
too far apart, less food is given than the patient can 
advantageously take. If too large amounts are given 
at once, too much work is thrust upon the enfeebled 
system. An illustration of a typical fluid diet, showing 
amounts and time of meals, is given below. It will 
yield from 800 to 900 Calories. 

A Typical Menu for a Fluid Diet 

1 cup coffee with \ cup milk 

Albuminized lemonade; 2 tbsp. lemon juice, 2 tbsp. 

sugar, egg white, 1 cup water 
1 cup broth 

1 cup gruel made with milk 
Albuminized lemonade (as above) 
1 cup tea with \ cup milk 
1 cup broth 

1 cup gruel made with milk 
1 cup broth 

When a fluid diet is to be given over a considerable 
period of time, running into weeks, more attention must 
be paid to its fuel value. To keep the food dilute and 
administer over 1000 Calories per day, meals may have 
to occur every two hours throughout the twenty-four.

be found in the discussion of typhoid fever. 1 A simple 
illustration of a more varied menu, to yield about 1800 
Calories, is given below. Such a menu is adapted to 
convalescence or other cases of weakness, where diges- 
tion is not greatly impaired. 

7 a.m. i cup milk 

9 a.m. 1 cup milk flavored with coffee essence 
1 1 a.m. Albuminized orange juice ; | cup orange juice, 2 tsp. sugar, 

white of one egg, \ cup water

Soft or Semi-Solid Diet 

The so-called soft or semi-solid diet represents an 
intermediate step between fluid diet and a very simple, 
wholesome, mixed diet, the latter often designated 
in hospitals as light or convalescent diet. Soft diet is 
generally more acceptable to the patient than a wholly 
fluid diet, and has the advantage of less bulk in propor- 
tion to fuel value. The foods most commonly included 
are any of the fluid foods mentioned in the preceding 
section and, in addition, a considerable variety of simple 
dishes, such as toast softened with water, milk, or broth ; 
custards, baked, steamed or " boiled"; whips, souffles, 

1 See page 305. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 295 

junkets, blancmange, gelatin jellies, ice creams, ices, 
and sherbets. Meats, fish, and green vegetables are 
omitted. The following menu will give some idea of 
what foods are permissible. It will yield from 2000 to 
2200 Calories. 

A Typical Menu for a Soft or Semi-solid Diet 
7 a.m. 1 cup hot milk (may be flavored with tea or coffee) 

9 : 30 a.m. \ cup grape or pineapple juice 

1 cup thick farina gruel served with rich milk 
1 thin slice toast with butter 

1 2 m. 1 cup beef broth with the white of 1 egg 

1 thin slice toast with butter 

2 : 30 p.m. § cup chicken souffle 
\ thin slice toast 
\ cup lemon jelly with 1 tbsp. whipped cream 

5 p.m. 1 cup milk flavored with tea or cocoa 

\ thin slice toast 

7 : 30 p.m. \ cup bouillon 
1 -egg omelet 
\ cup cocoa or caramel junket 

10 p.m. 1 cup gruel or malted milk (made with milk) 

1 thin slice toast 

Light or Convalescent Diet 

The treatment of convalescence depends, of course, 
upon the nature of the disease. The severity and dura- 
tion of the attack, the strength of the patient, and the 
nature of the diet during the acute stage are all factors 
to take into account in directing the diet during recovery, 
and no rule will exactly fit every case. But we may 



296 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

assume that the digestive tract will participate in the 
weakness of the rest of the body, even when not itself 
the seat of disturbance, and regard special attention to 
the diet as essential to rapid and complete restoration 
to health. If a fluid diet has been given, it will be fol- 
lowed by a semi-fluid one, and this in turn by one more 
like the patient's ordinary diet, but free from any foods 
which might overtax the system. When no special 
directions are given, except to take a " light" diet, it is 
permissible to provide a fairly liberal food supply, allow- 
ing some surplus over daily energy requirements to 
replenish depleted cells and restore lost weight, but see- 
ing to it that the extra amount is not so great as to upset 
digestion at any time. For adults an allowance of from 
2200 to 2500 Calories per day is usually sufficient, since 
convalescents are not indulging in active exercise. Aside 
from such regulations as the physician may prescribe, 
the main point is to limit the diet strictly to foods that 
are not likely to disturb digestion, and to see that build- 
ing materials are generously represented. Some of the 
ways of adapting food to digestive difficulties have been 
discussed in Chapter II, and many of the suggestions 
made in regard to selection of food for children (Chap- 
ters VI-IX) can be applied to the convalescent. It is 
well to keep in mind also the following points : 

1. The diet should be simple — only a few kinds of food at a 
time and those plainly but very carefully cooked and seasoned. 

2. Meals should be served with strict regularity ; a half hour of 
waiting may destroy all desire for food. 

3. The appetite should be tempted by the appearance of the 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 297 

tray — attractive dishes neatly arranged, no food slopped over, 
hot dishes hot and cold dishes cold when they reach the patient, 
a pleasant surprise in the shape of a pretty garnish, a flower or a 
new dish. 

The following outline shows the type of food which should be 
chosen. 

General Plan for Convalescent Diet 

Breakfast : Coffee or tea with milk and a little sugar 

Diluted fruit juice or cooked fruit, such as pears, 

prunes, apples 
A thoroughly cooked cereal (cooked 3 to 8 hours and 

strained if necessary) with thin cream and a little 

sugar 
A soft-cooked egg 
Dry toast — butter to spread it served separately 

Dinner: Meat broth or soup (rice, barley, potato, pea, as- 
paragus) 

Roast or broiled lean beef, chicken, mutton, lamb, 
or fish 

Potatoes baked, boiled, or mashed, or macaroni or 
rice 

Toast, stale bread, or plain crackers and butter 

A simple custard, ice cream, junket, cereal pudding, 
gelatin jelly, or mild stewed fruit 

Milk, to be flavored as desired 

Supper: Milk, served as soup, milk toast, or beverage, as 
preferred 
An omelet, souffle, or small chop 
Toast or stale bread and butter 
Stewed or baked fruit (prunes, apples, pears, bananas) 



If lunches are required between these meals, an eggnog, a glass 
of milk and a cracker, a cup of broth and a slice of toast, are safe 
to choose. 



2 g8 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

Diet in Minor Illness 

There are many times when diets of the types indi- 
cated above (fluid, semi-solid, and light or convalescent) 
may be profitably followed. On occasions of strain, 
nervous or otherwise, the digestive functions are likely 
to be depressed, and if given their usual amount of work 
to do may rebel and precipitate a fit of acute indiges- 
tion. If, however, the diet is made lighter for a few 
days, they will regain their normal state with no mishaps. 
A light meal is always in order when one is weary ; pass- 
ing quickly into the circulation, it helps to relieve the 
sense of fatigue. Nutritious soups are excellent for this 
purpose ; so are milk toast, bread, rice, or other cereals 
with milk, especially if the milk or the cereal is taken hot. 

Colds and influenza are often contracted because of 
weariness or exhaustion, and frequently accompanied by 
constipation. At first a light laxative diet of low fuel 
value is best — hot lemonade or orangeade, broths or 
gruels with crisp toast, baked potatoes, mild stewed 
fruits and vegetables being the chief articles of diet. 
This should be followed in a few days by one of full fuel 
value, and as soon as the cold seems to be " broken " by 
one of a little higher value than usual, to aid the body 
in complete recovery. For additional fuel at such times, 
fats such as butter, cream, bacon, olive and cod-liver 
oil, seem especially desirable, with liberal use of milk, 
eggs, and fruit. This " full feeding " should be continued 
until all traces of the cold are gone. It will do much to 
aid in quick recovery, and without it a cold may hang 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 299 

on a long time and even be the beginning of more serious 
troubles, such as chronic catarrh, bronchitis, pneu- 
monia, or even tuberculosis. 

Acute Indigestion 

During an attack of acute indigestion it is best to 
refrain from food, or to take only broth, tea, white of 
egg, or modified milk, for a day or two, until the irritated 
digestive tract has partially recovered, then to take a 
semi-solid diet, followed by a light diet, as outlined pre- 
viously 1 . Sugars, which are irritating 'to the lining 
of, the stomach and likely also to ferment, should be 
avoided. Fruit and vegetables must be introduced 
again cautiously. Baked potatoes, baked apples, and 
prunes are safest to begin with. Bread should be 
oven-dried or toasted crisp. Eggs, lean roast or broiled 
meat and fish, oysters, buttermilk, butter, cream, and 
bacon are all desirable. Under-feeding for a few days is 
better than over-feeding in this case. Only small quanti- 
ties should be taken at one time. The following menu 
illustrates what may well be taken as soon as compara- 
tive comfort has been secured by rest and lighter feeding.

Intestinal Putrefaction 

The control of intestinal putrefaction depends largely 
upon the diet. As indicated in Chapter II, 1 protein 
food should be limited and the kind carefully considered. 
Meat proteins are very readily attacked by putrefactive 
bacteria and should be avoided. Milk protein is most 
satisfactory, and one may choose not only the various 
beverages, but also cottage and other cheeses as meat 
substitutes. Vegetable proteins may also be used, as 
those in cereals and bread, peas, and beans. Not more 
than two protein Calories per pound of body weight 
should be taken per day by an adult. A liberal use of 
green vegetables and fruits not only helps to carry off 
putrefactive products from the intestine, so that they 
will not be absorbed to circulate in the body and do 
harm, but these foods by their tendency to ferment a 
little actually hinder the action of the putrefactive bac- 
teria. Constipation is very likely to be associated with 

1 See page 39. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 301 

putrefaction, and most of the measures used to combat 
it x may be tried when it is associated with putrefaction. 
Persistence is essential to success in the treatment of 
intestinal disturbances. One needs the patience of Job 
and grim determination not to backslide. The follow- 
ing suggestions may be helpful in planning a diet.

Putrefaction

Breakfast : Thoroughly cooked cereal, with cream 
Dry, crisp toast and butter 
Fresh or stewed fruit

Food in Fevers 

In the early stages of fever, digestion is often much 
disturbed — sometimes to such a degree that no food 

1 See page 42. 



3 02 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

at all can be retained. No food should be given which 
cannot be readily digested and absorbed, for undigested 
food will do more harm than good. A liberal supply of 
liquid is important to relieve thirst and help in elimina- 
tion of waste products, but when the digestive tract is 
very irritable even fluids will have to be given in small 
quantities at a time, though at frequent intervals. For 
a few days after the first onset of fever, the beverages, 
aside from water, may be only slightly nutritive, being 
confined principally to cereal waters (very thin gruels), 
diluted fruit juices (lemonade, orangeade, etc.), whey, and 
broth. 

But the energy output in fever is higher than when 
the body is free from fever. The raised temperature 
may increase the energy expenditure as much as one- 
fourth. Thus a bedridden man with fever, instead of 
requiring from 1800 to 2200 Calories per day, will need 
from 2200 to 2800 to keep from burning up his body 
tissues for fuel — or about the same amount as he 
would require if doing moderate muscular work in health. 
In some diseases characterized by fever even this extra 
allowance is not enough to maintain the patient's body 
weight. In typhoid fever, for instance, the bacteria 
responsible for the disease cause a great wasting of body 
substance, which can be prevented only by feeding a 
diet of very much higher fuel value than the patient 
would need if he were simply lying in bed free from 
fever. 1 

The administration of food in fever calls for the exer- 
1 See discussion of " Diet in Typhoid Fever." 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 303 

cise of skill and good judgment in deciding how far the 
patient's energy needs can be met when the 'alimentary 
tract is very sensitive and indigestion may be worse 
than under-feeding, and in selecting the food which can 
be taken most successfully. A fluid diet is safest and 
easiest to give, as a rule. Meals may be served at inter- 
vals of one and one-half to two hours. Milk is an ideal 
fever food, if modified to suit the digestive state of the 
patient. Whole cow's milk is so high in protein that it 
will make a better balanced diet if something contain- 
ing little or no protein is combined with it — cream or 
milk sugar or both, or some cereal gruel or proprietary 
infants' food prepared from cereal flours, malted or 
otherwise. The different devices for modifying milk for 
infants are applicable here, but more attention should be 
paid to flavor for the adult, lest he tire of its monotony. 
The aftertaste of milk is disagreeable to many, especially 
when the mouth is parched with fever, and this can be 
avoided by carefully cleansing the mouth with water, plain 
or slightly acidified with lemon juice, immediately after 
each feeding. The outline of a fluid diet of high fuel 
value, on page 294, may be used in fever as soon as the 
digestive tract will tolerate it — usually in a few days. 

Diet in Typhoid Fever 

Typhoid fever furnishes a striking example of a dis- 
ease in which diet is one of the most important factors in 
treatment. The very life of the patient depends upon 
absolute obedience to physician and nurse in regard to 
every mouthful that the patient receives. A single 



304 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

indiscretion in diet may prove fatal, and no one but a 
person expert in reading the signs of the patient's con- 
dition (often entirely unperceived by the inexperienced 
and untrained person) should venture to prescribe the 
diet. Since, however, the home nurse has the respon- 
sibility of preparing the food ordered by the doctor, she 
will be able to cooperate more easily and cheerfully if 
she understands the general principles of the dietetic 
treatment of the disease, and it is only with the thought 
of giving her this background that the following sugges- 
tions are made. 

As in other cases of fever, there is an increase in the 
energy expended, due to the influence of the heightened 
temperature. There is an added expenditure due to 
the wasting of body substance brought about by the 
bacteria which cause the disease. These bacteria enter 
the system by way of the mouth, usually in contami- 
nated food or water. A typhoid patient is always the 
victim of somebody's carelessness. Proper safeguard- 
ing of the water and milk supply in a community, with 
prompt isolation of any typhoid subject who may appear, 
will practically eliminate the disease. Typhoid bacteria 
find a congenial soil in the large intestine and flourish 
there at the expense of the intestinal wall, causing ulcers 
and giving off poisons which are absorbed and circulate 
in the blood to poison the whole body. On account of 
the intestinal ulcers, the diet must not cause irritation 
or undue distension of the intestinal walls. This is one 
reason why the food must be very easy to digest and 
absolutely free from all indigestible substances, such as 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 305 

cellulose, seeds, or even large undigested food fragments. 
In the early stages, the digestion may be greatly dis- 
turbed and little food of any kind can be given. But 
typhoid runs a long course (four to six weeks) and these 
first symptoms subside more or less completely in a com- 
paratively short time, after which digestion may con- 
stantly improve. The power of the body to absorb and 
utilize food is not much impaired, so that once digestion 
is good the increased energy demands can be nearly, if 
not fully met, and the great wasting once thought inevi- 
table prevented. There are cases on record in which the 
patients have actually gained weight while the disease 
was in progress. If such feeding is possible, the dangers 
of exhaustion and slow convalescence are much lessened. 
For the early stages, then, it is likely that a fluid diet 
will be adhered to very strictly, one consisting prin- 
cipally of modified milk being most generally employed. 
The amount and nutritive value will depend upon the 
condition of the patient, the best success being generally 
obtained with from 1000 to 3000 Calories per day. The 
following are good examples of the modified milk diets.

A typhoid patient is not always limited to a fluid diet, 
though solid foods must be given cautiously and intro- 
duced gradually. The foods from which the diet should 
be chosen are : 

1. Milk in various forms 

2. Broths — beef, veal, chicken, mutton 

3. Soups — potato, pea, bean, carefully strained and thickened 

with flour. Milk, cream, and egg may be used 

4. Gruels — always strained 

5. Eggs, raw or soft-cooked 

6. Cream and butter 

7. Custards, ice creams and sherbets, blancmanges, and gelatin 

jellies. Milk sugar used for sweetening will increase the 
fuel value 

8. Toast 

9. Breakfast cereals, thoroughly cooked and strained 

10. Rice, baked and mashed potatoes 

11. Apple sauce, orange juice and grape juice 

Such a diet is adapted to the early stages of conva- 
lescence, when not prescribed during the fever. A 
dietary which illustrates the high feeding on a very 
simple, easily digested, mixed diet, free from anything 
likely to cause intestinal irritation or other disturbance, 
is here quoted. 1

Diet in Tuberculosis 

When the tubercle bacillus gains a foothold in the 
human body, it not only proceeds to destroy the organ 
upon which it encamps, — lungs, kidney, or whatever 
it may be — but it produces poisons which permeate 
the whole system, causing fever, loss of appetite, and 
other bad conditions which result in the wasting so 
familiar in this dread disease. There is no drug which 
will kill or drive out the germ : the body must elaborate 
its own weapons of defense, and the object of treatment 
is to build the person up so that resistance to the disease 
will become great enough to bring about a cure. Every- 
thing which will help to promote good nutrition must be 
emphasized — all the fresh air obtainable, carefully 
regulated rest and exercise, and good food in abundance. 
As in typhoid fever, the amount and kind of food is of 
great importance. But in tuberculosis the appetite is 
apt to be poor and fitful and is no guide whatever as to 
how much the patient should eat. Often he must con- 
tinue eating when he does not want food at all. But 
this does not mean that he should be indiscriminately 
" stuffed." The best dieting is that which keeps his 
digestive tract in as good condition as possible and yet 
brings about a gain in weight, until he attains the highest 



310 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

weight which he is known to have had before contracting 
the disease. Fattening beyond this point seems unde- 
sirable. The amount necessary to produce a satis- 
factory gain in weight will vary with the individual, but 
the best rule which seems to have been evolved by stu- 
dents of the problem is to add one-third more to the diet 
which would be normal for the same person, with the 
same degree of activity (usually at rest), but without 
tuberculosis. Thus, taking the average requirement for 
a man at rest as 2000 Calories, the provision for the 
same person when tubercular would be about 2700 
Calories. Much care must be taken in the selection and 
preparation of food, to see that it is easy of digestion, 
and the amount of food to be eaten must be carefully 
measured. 

As to kind of food, the tubercular patient seems to 
profit by liberal protein and fat, but indiscriminate stuff- 
ing with these may defeat its own end. An allowance of 
about one- third more protein than what would be a liberal 
provision in a non-tubercular diet seems advisable. A 
man in health is abundantly supplied when he has 400 
protein Calories per day : the tubercular man should, 
accordingly, have about 530 protein Calories per day. 
Since the protein is needed to reconstruct wasted tissues, 
the kinds best for growth should have preference — milk 
and eggs particularly — though other protein food can 
also be used to advantage, if prepared in ways easy of 
digestion. 1 Fat by its high fuel value helps to keep the 
bulk of the day's diet within practical limits — a great

consideration when the appetite is feeble. Butter, cream, 
olive oil, cod-liver oil, bacon, oleomargarine, suet, and 
beef drippings can all be successfully used.

FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 313 

A tempting diet of high fuel value, with a generous 
proportion (15 to 20 per cent) in the form of protein, is 
likely to be expensive. Cream, butter, eggs, choice meats, 
and dainty cookery and service are beyond the reach 
of many tubercular patients. That tuberculosis can, 
however, be cured on foods which are within the reach 
of the ordinary purse has been demonstrated at the 
Loomis Sanitorium in this country and at those in Eng- 
land under the supervision of the well-known authori- 
ties, Bardswell and Chapman. The day's dietary given 
on page 311, moderate in cost, is based on the day's 
menu served at the Loomis Sanatorium. 1 

Diets even less expensive are those of Bardswell and 
Chapman. The following modification of their plan, 
adapted to American conditions, is a very satisfactory 
basis for low-priced diets. 2 

A Plan for Low-priced Tuberculosis Diets 

Breakfast : Large dish of oatmeal, milk and sugar, 2 oz. of bacon 
or smoked fish, 2 slices of bread and oleomargarine 

10 a.m. 3 slices of bread and oleomargarine with prune or 

date marmalade prepared at home 

Luncheon : 8 oz. of soup from one of the dried vegetables (vary 
by making part milk), 2 slices of bread and cheese, 
glass of milk 

Dinner : Plate of meat stew, slice of bread and oleomargarine, 
dish of well-cooked vegetables, 8 oz. of rice or 
tapioca pudding made with milk, glass of milk

Diet in Diabetes 

The regulation of the diet is the most important con- 
sideration in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The 
most striking symptom of the disease is an impaired 
power of utilizing carbohydrates. These ordinarily cir- 
culate in the blood as sugar and are burned by the 
muscles for fuel or stored in muscles and liver. In the 
diabetic the sugar in the blood cannot be burned and 
accumulates in the blood until a certain point is reached, 
when it passes into the urine. Not every one who ex- 
cretes sugar is a diabetic, but the appearance of sugar in 
the urine should be regarded with suspicion and the 
state of health thoroughly investigated, for the sooner 
this disease is treated the better the chance of arresting 
its progress and keeping the patient in comparatively 
good health and comfort. The presence of excessive 
sugar in the blood lowers resistance to bacterial infec- 
tion and invites numerous complications, besides hasten- 
ing the progress of the disease itself — that is, the dis- 
turbance of the sugar-burning power of the body. 
Middle-aged and elderly people ought to have their 
urine tested once a year as a precautionary measure. 

While certain general principles in regard to diet for 
diabetes can be laid down, each patient presents an 
individual problem which must be studied, not only at 
the beginning of the treatment, but throughout the course 
of the disease. The power to burn sugar perfectly, once 
lost, is never completely regained ; the diet must always 
be carefully prescribed and changed from time to time 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 315 

according to the development of the disease. If the 
loss of sugar-burning power is very great, it is likely to 
be accompanied by other signs of a disturbed state of 
nutrition, particularly the appearance of certain acids 
in the urine indicative of a condition called acidosis. 
Dietetic treatment must be directed to the control of

acidosis, as well as to the elimination of sugar from the 
urine. 

The first step is fasting 1 till the urine is sugar free, 
then beginning with small amounts of carbohydrate, 
preferably in the form of green vegetables, and gradually 

1 For details see Allen, Treatment of Diabetes, Boston Medical and 
Surgical Journal, 1915, Vol. 173, p. 241. 



31 6 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

increasing till the person's " tolerance " or sugar-burning 
capacity is learned. This is important because any- 
excess over what the tissues can utilize acts as a poison 
and causes the ability to burn carbohydrates to diminish, 
the organs concerned in the process being weakened by 
the strain of trying to care for more than they are able. 
The treatment which follows aims to increase this toler- 
ance by supplying the patient with sufficient nourishment 
without overtaxing the powers of sugar-burning. The 
patient should be provided with scales measuring grams 
for weighing food, and written instructions as to the 
exact amounts of different foods to be eaten. The 
matter is too critical to be left to the crude measure- 
ments of the eye. 

When a certain course is to be pursued for some time, 
— perhaps several months, — a general plan for the diet 
and a table of " carbohydrate equivalents," by means of 
which the menu can be varied, is most conveniently 
followed. Whoever has charge of the feeding of a dia- 
betic patient should learn from the physician exactly how 
much protein, fat, and carbohydrate is to be given, and 
how to estimate the amount of each food to be eaten. 
Such tables as those below 1 give a good general outline 
of the foods available. 

A Scheme for Planning Diabetic Diets 

" Tables A and B are made up of foods that are nearly carbo- 
hydrate-free and from these lists this sort of dietary may be con- 
structed according to the patient's preferences. These foods 
(Tables A and B), may be used without restriction of quantity 
unless there is a necessity of limiting the amount of protein con- 
1 N. B. Foster, American Journal of Medical Sciences, February, 1911. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 317 

sumed. In Tables C and D the foods all contain carbohydrate. 
These tables are to be used only when the carbohydrate tolerance 
of the patient is known, and then the total amount of starch- 
containing food should be kept well below the tolerance limit (by 
at least 10 grams of bread). For example, if 60 grams of white 
bread is assimilated without inducing glycosuria, 1 then not more 
than 50 grams in equivalents should be allowed. Further, foods 
like potatoes and fruits should be separately tested with each 
patient in order to determine whether there is any peculiarity of 
reaction toward them respecting sugar excretion. 

" The order and number of meals requires consideration also ; 
four or five meals are better than three ; a second breakfast and 
afternoon tea may be interpolated. Half of the daily allowance 
of bread should be taken at the mid-day meal, and it is better 
that at least a third of the daily bread allowance be used as 
equivalents — vegetables and fruits. 

"Table A 

"Fresh Meats: All muscle parts of beef, veal, pork, lamb, 
mutton, domestic and wild fowl, either roasted, boiled, or broiled, 
in their juices, with butter, or with mayonnaise made without 
flour, either hot or cold. 

" Various Organs of Animals : Tongue, heart, brains, sweet- 
breads, kidneys, marrow, calves' liver, liver of game or poultry 
(pate de fois gras) up to 100 grams in weight, weighed after being 
prepared. 

"Preserved Meat: Smoked meat, dried meat, smoked or 
pickled tongue, ham or bacon, corned beef, sausage (containing no 
bread). Be sure that no flour is used in preparing pickled meats. 

" Meat Peptones of all kinds, jellies, or aspics prepared from 
calves' feet, or pure gelatin ; nutrose, tropon, plastnon, wheat gluten, 
etc. 

" Fresh Fish : All fresh fish boiled, fried, or broiled. If the

fish is fried in bread crumbs and eggs the crust should be removed 
before the fish is eaten. All sauces that contain no flour are 
allowed ; those that contain butter and lemon are the best. 

" Preserved Fish : Dried, salted, and smoked, such as haddock 
cod, herring, mackerel, flounder, sturgeon, eels, salmon, etc. 
Pickled herrings, sardines in oil, mackerel in oil, anchovy, tunny- 
fish, etc. 

" Fish Products : Caviare, cod-liver oil. 

" Shellfish and Crustacea : Oysters, clams, and other shell- 
fish, lobsters, crabs, crawfish, shrimps, turtle, etc.

"Foods Rich in Fats: Dairy products — cream, butter, yolks 
of eggs, cheese. 

" Animal Fats — bone marrow, fat of edible meats, lard, tallow 
(used in cooking), cod-liver oil, oleomargarine. Vegetable Fats 
— olive oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, peanut butter, nut butter. 

" Vegetables containing a slight amount of carbohydrate (less 
than 4 per cent). These may be taken in normal quantities unless 
otherwise directed : asparagus, beet greens, Brussels sprouts, 
cabbage, celery, chard, cucumbers, endive, lettuce, sauerkraut,

"Table D 

" This table consists of a list of food materials which are not 
entirely free of sugars. They are allowed in quantities stated 
unless the patient is on a " carbohydrate-free " diet, when they must 
be avoided. 

" Vegetables (cooked without flour or sweetening) : Dried peas 
and beans, either whole or in puree, turnips, carrots, salsify, green 
peas, lima beans, kidney beans, 2 tablespoonfuls. 

" Fresh Fruit : Apples, pears, apricots, peaches, 50 grams. 
Raspberries, strawberries, red currants, 1 large tablespoonful. 
Blackberries, 2 tablespoonfuls. 

" Stewed Fruit (with saccharine or crystallose) : Plums, apples, 
pears, apricots, peaches, sour cherries, prunes, 1 heaped teaspoonful. 
Raspberries, gooseberries, red currants, 2 heaped tablespoonfuls. 

"Dried Fruit: Plums, apricots, peaches, apples, prunes, 2 
heaped tablespoonfuls. 

"Levulose Chocolate (Stollwerck's), up to 15 grams. 

" Cocoa (without sugar), up to 12 grams. 

"How to Make Use of Table C 

"The food is divided into two parts: (1) That which is free 
from carbohydrates, the principal fare, Tables A and B ; and (2) 
that which contains carbohydrates, the secondary fare, Tables C 
and D. For instance, the equivalent of 75 grams of wheat bread 
are allowed in courses from Table C. 

Breakfast : Principal fare, medium strong coffee or tea, cold 
meat, 1 egg and butter ; secondary fare, 50 grams of oatcakes, the 
equivalent of which = 20 grams of wheat bread. 

Second Breakfast : Two eggs in any form. 

Dinner (midday meal) : Principal fare, broth with egg, meat 
with green vegetables or salad (Table B), cheese, and butter. 
Secondary fare, 50 grams of potatoes ( = 20 grams of wheat 
bread), 60 grams of strawberries ( = 10 grams of wheat bread). 

Afternoon Meal : Tea, coffee, or consomme, with casoid cakes.

Making a diabetic diet acceptable depends not only 
upon ability to regulate the kind and amount of food, 
but upon skill in cookery, and 
the amount of money available 
for food. Since carbohydrates 
constitute the largest part of an 
ordinary diet, their withdrawal 
changes eating habits materially, 
and people find it difficult to do 
without the familiar bread, 
potatoes, cereals, sugars, and 
fruits. Furthermore, the carbo- 
hydrate foods are relatively the 
cheapest part of the diet, so that 
a diabetic diet will always cost 
more than a mixed diet of the 
same general character. 

The large amount of fat is 
likely to prove disagreeable un- 
less introduced with care into the 
menu. Most books on invalid 
cookery give recipes for diabetic 

diets. 1 These are very helpful because the cook is de- 
prived of her ordinary thickening agents, such as flour,

also of sugar and milk, and special devices are necessary to 
make acceptable dishes. The best fats are butter, cream, 
cream cheese, olive oil, bacon fat, meat fats of other 
kinds, bone marrow, fat and highly flavored fish (as 
canned sardines, salmon, mackerel, and whitensh). 
Green vegetables are the best fat carriers. Melted 
butter may be poured over those served hot and olive 
oil or cream dressing over salads. A small potato? 
according to Miss Farmer, may take up one-half its 
weight in butter, or one-fourth its weight in heavy cream. 
Potatoes, however, are not always permissible, while 
green vegetables such as lettuce and cabbage are. Cream 
can be used in place of milk in many dishes. In others, 
cream diluted with water, to which raw white of egg is 
added, will make a satisfactory milk substitute. As a 
rule, the best success in feeding comes from judicious 
use of the ordinary foods in correct amounts. Special 
diabetic foods on the market are expensive and not 
always reliable. They should not be used without 
knowledge of their exact composition. 1 The more the 
carbohydrate is removed, the greater the cost. On 
account of the restrictions in breadstuffs, muffins, wafers, 
and so forth, made with almond, soy bean, casoid, 2 or 
pure gluten flour are useful occasionally for the sake of 
variety, even for mild cases, and are a help when the 
carbohydrate is very greatly restricted. 

1 The composition of many diabetic foods may be found in a bulletin 
by Mendel and Street, Diabetic Foods, published by the Connecticut 
Agricultural Experiment Station, New Haven, Conn. 

2 The manufacturers of casoid flour publish a cookbook with some 
excellent recipes for the use of this carbohydrate-free flour. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 323 

Saccharine may be used for sweetening in place of 
sugar. It has no food value, but is intensely sweet, 
having 500 times the sweetness of cane sugar. The taste 
remains in the mouth much longer than that of sugar, 
and if much is used a bitter taste develops. It should, 
therefore, be used as little as possible to get the best 
results in the long run. 

There is always danger of mild diabetes becoming 
severe ; the only way to prevent this is by eternal vigi- 
lance in regard to diet, and careful living, without 
physical overwork or nervous strain. Even when the 
patient is tempted by long periods of continued well- 
being to disregard his dietetic limitations, he should be 
prevented from doing so. A diabetic patient should 
not have charge of his own diet. The unhappy feeling 
of restriction will be less and the temptation to overstep 
the boundaries diminished if some one else plans and 
prepares the meals. 

In severe diabetes protein is restricted as well as car- 
bohydrate, and the body must depend mainly on fat 
for fuel. Under such circumstances the fat-burning 
power also becomes weakened, and the general disturb- 
ance of metabolism is evidenced by acidosis. The 
treatment then must attempt to correct both sugar 
and acid excretion. No one diet will serve this pur- 
pose. Treatment can be best carried on in hospital 
or sanitarium — at any rate, under constant guidance of 
a physician. 

One device for resting the impaired functions and 
reducing sugar in the blood is to prescribe "green" or

" vegetable" days, when little food of any kind is taken. 
The following will serve as an illustration of this type 
of diet. 

Green Days 1 

Breakfast : i egg, boiled or poached 
Cupful of black coffee 

Dinner : Spinach, with hard-boiled egg 
Bacon, 15 gm. (i oz.) 
Salad with 15 gm. (| oz.) of oil 
White wine, £ 1. (4 oz.), or whisky or brandy, 30 c.c. 
(1 oz.) 

Cup of beef-tea or chicken broth 



4 : 30 p.m. 
Supper : 



1 egg, scrambled with tomato and a little butter 

Bacon, 15 gm. (f oz.) 

Cabbage, cauliflower, sauerkraut, string-beans, or 

asparagus 
White wine, 1 1. (4 oz.), or whisky or brandy, 30 c.c. 

(1 oz.) 



In the home treatment of diabetes the problem of 
following the doctor's orders is often difficult because of 
expense. Carbohydrate foods are the cheapest class; 
the more they are excluded, the greater the cost of the 
diet. Some suggestions for low-priced diets are given 
below. 

They will not cost over two cents per 100 Cal- 
ories, and neither will the cost be raised much by the 
addition of a little more carbohydrate food when this is 
permitted.

Diet in Gout 

Gout is a disease of the overfed rather than the under- 
nourished. Luxurious living, with its constant tempta- 
tion to overeat, especially of protein foods, and to avoid 
exercise, often brings its penalty in the form of acute or 
chronic gout. Indulgence in alcoholic beverages, es- 
pecially as an accompaniment to a sumptuous repast, 
increases a man's chances of acquiring the disease. 
Sometimes he suffers for the sins of his ancestors, the 
tendency to the disease being said to be transmissible. 
There are usually disturbances of the digestive system 
— gastric indigestion, intestinal putrefaction, and con- 
stipation — but the most constant symptom is an excess 
of uric acid in the blood, indicating a faulty elimination 
of this substance. Uric acid is formed in the body, but 
in health it is excreted in the urine, so that the amount 
in circulation in the blood is very small. In gout this 
acid accumulates in the blood and is eliminated with 
difficulty. The following are to be avoided: (1) all 
foods which disturb digestion ; (2) all foods which tend 
to induce intestinal putrefaction and constipation; 
(3) all excess of total fuel and of protein food ; and (4) all 
foods which by their composition tend to increase the 
amount of uric acid which the body has to get rid of. 
Uric acid belongs to a group of closely related substances 
called purins. These are found in flesh foods of all kinds 
and in some vegetable foods. The purins other than 
uric acid in these foods are mostly converted into uric 
acid in the body. Hence, if eHmination is faulty, they 



328 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

raise the amount of uric acid in the blood, a condition 
considered very unfavorable in cases of gout, though the 
relation of this substance to the disease is not fully 
understood. The taking of alcoholic beverages also 
tends to hinder uric acid elimination, and these should 
be excluded in gout. 

The treatment is largely dietetic and the diet should 
be adapted to the needs of the patient by the physician. 
Some information, however, as to the purin content of 
foods will be helpful in carrying out his orders. Milk, 
eggs, cheese, nuts, gelatin, fruits, sugars, breadstuffs 
made with white flour, cornstarch, tapioca, farina, rice, 
potatoes and other root vegetables, most green vege- 
tables (spinach and asparagus excepted), and all kinds 
of fat are practically purin-free. 

Sweetbreads, kidney, liver, sardines, and anchovies 
are very rich in purins and should be entirely avoided. 
Beef, veal, mutton, pork, chicken, turkey, goose and 
other kinds of game, fish with the exception of cod, are 
fairly high in purin content, and should be sparingly if 
at all indulged in. Boiling meat will remove some of the 
purins ; hence boiled meats are sometimes allowed where 
roasted or broiled ones are not. Among vegetable foods, 
spinach, asparagus, peas, and beans are richest in purins, 
though none of these contains as much as meat. A die- 
tary indicating the type of food best adapted to use in 
gout is given below.

TABLE I 

ioo-Calorie Portions of Foods as We Eat Them 

Introductory Note 

Most of these foods have been measured and weighed 
in the author's laboratory, some of them many times. 
Nevertheless, standardization of measures and weights 
is exceedingly difficult, and these tables make no claim 
to strict mathematical accuracy. They are presented 
with the hope of enabling the housewife who does not 
wish the burden of weighing and making calculations 
— or the persons who cannot go behind the scenes, i.e. 
into the kitchen — to get quickly some fair conception 
of the relative value of various foods as they appear on 
the table. The data on uncooked single food materials 
have been taken largely from the author's Laboratory 
Handbook for Dietetics, based on the Analyses of Ameri- 
can Food Materials, published as Bulletin 28, Office of 
Experiment Stations, U. S. Department of Agriculture, 
from which latter source have also been taken some 
analyses of cooked foods.

APPENDIX 349 

TABLE II 

Food Values in Terms of Common Measures 
Introductory Note 

This table is designed to supplement Table I, as an 
aid in the estimation of the food value of various dishes 
made in the kitchen. It consists of information as to 
the food value of materials which the cook is accustomed 
to using by measure and generally uncooked. In har- 
mony with modern culinary practice, level measurements 
have been employed throughout. By this means we 
secure greater exactness and uniformity in the quantity 
meant by a half-pint cupful, a tablespoonful, or a tea- 
spoonful. Even thus, the quantities obtained by meas- 
urement are rather variable. Foods which pack down 
easily, such as flour or chopped fruits, give a cupful 
whose weight will vary a great deal, while other foods, 
like butter and granulated sugar, give a cupful of , much 
more constant weight. Similarly, a tablespoonful of 
sugar is a fairly constant quantity, while a tablespoonful 
of molasses, cream, or olive oil, weighs more or less 
according to the viscosity of the material or one's inter- 
pretation of a level tablespoonful of a liquid which can 
actually be heaped up to some extent on the spoon. 

It is believed that the weights given in the table are 
fair averages, but the difficulties inherent in producing 
such a table must be borne in mind. To get a quantity 
exactly corresponding to the food values stated for any 
measurement, the food must actually be weighed. And, 
strictly speaking, weights in ounces are too crude for the 



350 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

purpose. The gram (28.35 grams equal 1 ounce) is the 
unit upon which the calculation of Calories is based. 1 
This is a unit too small to have much significance in the 
kitchen, but it is mentioned here to explain any dis- 
crepancies which seem to occur between the weights and 
food values as given in the table. Anyone wishing accu- 
rate data on food values by weight can find them else- 
where. 2 

With this table, in conjunction with Table I, any- 
one can estimate the food values of a given recipe, if it 
is not to be found in Table III. For example, suppose 
one makes a cake by the following recipe : 

3 eggs 1 tbsp. butter 

1 cup sugar 1 cup flour 

I tbsp. milk 2 tsp. baking powder 
\ tsp. salt 

Referring to the table for the total fuel value of each 
ingredient, 

3 eggs = 3 X 70 Calories =210 Calories 

1 cup sugar = 1 X 840 Calories = 840 Calories 
f tbsp. milk = ^ x 14 Calories = 7 Calories 
1 tbsp. butter =1x109 Calories =109 Calories 
1 cup flour = 1 X 395 Calories = 395 Calories 
Total for recipe 1561 Calories 

The salt has no fuel value, and the small amount con- 
tributed by starch in baking powder may be disregarded. 

1 1 gram of protein yields 4 Calories. 
1 gram of fat yields 9 Calories. 

1 gram of carbohydrate yields 4 Calories.

APPENDIX 355 

TABLE III 
Dietary Recipes 
Introductory Note 
Since a great deal of variation in food value is pos- 
sible in the same dish, according to the recipe used, it 
has seemed desirable to indicate the ingredients of the 
dishes whose food values in terms of ioo-Calorie portions 
have been given in Table I. Here are included almost 
all the combinations of food materials used in prepara- 
tion of the dietaries given throughout the book, as well 
as a number of other dishes with which any cook is likely 
to be familiar. The ingredients of each recipe have 
been measured and weighed separately, their food values 
calculated on these weights, and then added together to 
give the food value of the whole recipe. Each dish has 
then been cooked and when ready to eat measured 
and weighed. From the weight and total Calories of the 
cooked product the ioo-Calorie portion has in each case 
been estimated, then weighed out and measured as 
accurately as possible with ordinary kitchen equipment, 
i.e. half-pint cups divided into quarters and thirds, 
tablespoons and teaspoons, supplemented by an ordinary 
foot rule. From the scientific point of view such a 
method is very crude. No two people measuring flour 
for a cake will get exactly the same weight. Then, too, 
the finished cake will vary in weight according to these 
differences in weight of ingredients and also according 
to the size and shape of the pan, the intensity of the 
oven heat, and the length of time of baking. Further- 
more, it is not possible to measure the cubical contents 



356 FEEDING THE FAMILY 

exactly with a ruler, as few cakes are perfectly flat on 
top. Moreover, a sample cut from the soft center may 
weigh the same as one from a hardened corner, but the 
measurements will not agree exactly. For such reasons, 
data on cooked food materials, unless prepared by the 
methods of the chemical laboratory instead of the kitchen, 
must be regarded as approximate rather than absolutely 
accurate. To the housewife, intent on learning to esti- 
mate food values for the general welfare of her family, 
these discrepancies are of no moment. A variation of 
a few Calories in a day's dietary has no particular sig- 
nificance. What she needs to know is the approximate 
food value of any dish which she is preparing. She 
can then estimate the food value of each individual serv- 
ing without difficulty. This is why the food values for 
the whole recipe have been stated. Moreover, if any- 
one will take the trouble to measure a ioo-Calorie por- 
tion, she will find it possible to remember this well 
enough to judge of the food value of any portion served. 
For example, ioo Calories of mince pie require a sector one 
inch on the outer circumference ; a 9-inch pie is about 28 
inches in circumference, and hence will yield about 2800 
Calories ; if each serving is three inches on the outer edge, 
it will contain 300 Calories — if four inches, 400 Calories, 
etc. Such estimates are perfectly practical for home use. 
In the collection which follows, the recipes are drawn 
from many sources — standard cookbooks or contri- 
butions from students in the author's laboratory — and 
it is believed that they represent the common way of 
making most of the dishes, though a few have been 



APPENDIX 357 

specially arranged for economy's sake. In the latter case, 
the more usual way has sometimes been given in a second 
recipe. No attempt has been made to keep them uni- 
form for any particular number of servings. The aim 
has been merely to indicate proportions of ingredients, 
so that the housewife can compare these recipes with her 
own and where they are alike multiply or divide the 
values of each according to the size of her family. As 
this book is not intended as a substitute for a cookbook, 
the kind and quantity of seasonings have not been given, 
these having no appreciable fuel value.

A Laboratory Hand-book for Dietetics 

By MARY SWARTZ ROSE, Ph.D. 

Assistant Professor, Department of Nutrition, Teachers College, Columbia University 

Cloth, 8vo, $1.10 

Investigations into the quantitative requirements of the human body have progressed so 
far as to make dietetics to a certain extent an exact science, and to emphasize the importance 
of a quantitative study of food materials. This little book explains the problems involved in 
the calculation of food values and food requirements, and the construction of dietaries, and 
furnishes reference tables which will minimize the labor involved in such work without limiting 
dietary study to a few food materials 

Only brief statements of the conditions affecting food requirements have been made, the 
reader being referred to general textbooks on the subject of nutrition for fuller information, 
but such data have been included as seem most useful in determining the amount of food for 
any normal individual under varying conditions of age and activity.

Milk and Its Products 



By HENRY H. WING 

Professor of Dairy Husbandry in Cornell University 

New Revised Edition, with new illustrations, cloth, i2mo, $1.50 

The revolution in dairy practice, brought about by the introduction of the 
centrifugal cream separator and the Babcock test for fat, by a more definite 
knowledge regarding the various fermentations that so greatly influence milk, 
and the manufacture of its products, have demanded the publication of a book 
that shall give to the dairyman, and particularly to the dairy student, in simple, 
concise form, the principles underlying modern dairy practice. Such has been 
Professor Wing's purpose in this work. This is not a new edition of the au- 
thor's very successful volume published under the same title many years ago; 
it is, in reality, an entirely new book, having been wholly reset and enlarged by 
the addition of new matter, both text and illustrations. The author's aim has 
been at all times to give the present state of knowledge as supported by the 
weight of evidence and the opinions of those whose authority is highest.

Chemistry of Food and Nutrition 



By HENRY C. SHERMAN, Ph.D. 

Professor in Columbia University 



Cloth, i2mo, viii + 355 Pages, $1.50 



The purpose of this volume is to present the principles 
of the chemistry of food and nutrition with special refer- 
ence to the food requirements of man and the considera- 
tions which should underlie our judgment of the nutritive 
values of food. The food is here considered chiefly in its 
nutritive relations. 



" A compact compendium of information based upon the 
most recent researches." — The Nation. 

" It is a real pleasure to call attention to Dr. Sherman's 
work, which is excellent. . . . Not too long, nor too tech- 
nical." — Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin. 

" A veritable treasure to the student of dietetics." — ■

The New Public Health 

By HIBBERT WINSLOW HILL 

Of the Institute of Public Health, London, Ontario, Canada 

Cloth, i2mo, $1.25 

Dr. Hill has analyzed the revolutionary changes that have 
taken place in the public attitude toward the public health, 
and studied the problem of the public apathy to constructive 
sanitation. His new book is a survey of the field, tracing 
first the differences between the old attitude and the new, 
and second, pointing out the actual achievements in public 
and individual defense against infection and contagion. 
The book discusses in detail the work of the Public Health 
Engineer, Statistician, and Laboratory, particularly in refer- 
ence to the public health of the future, and describes the 
administration and application of the principles and methods 
which research has discovered and developed in recent years. 
Tuberculosis, scarlet fever, and venereal diseases receive 
especially full treatment. 

The book is optimistic, constructive, and enthusiastic ; it 
gives at once a sound working knowledge of what has been 
done and a practical program for procedure in the future ; it 
is authoritative and founded on long actual experience. 

"The way is clear, what remains is to follow it; the 
method is known, what remains is to carry it out ; the thing 
we, as a race, for centuries have prayed for, can be done; 
all that remains is to do it. Each generation of Americans 
pays now for infectious diseases ten billion dollars at the 
least, and has the diseases, too. Why not pay one-tenth this 
sum and rid ourselves of them forever ?
