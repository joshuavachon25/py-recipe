FOREWORD. 



In offering this book to the pubHc, the cook book committee 
is divided between two impulses — the first, to apologize for its 
temerity in offering a cook book compiled and edited for the most 
part by amateurs and which, if advanced sales are an indication, 
will be passed in review by housewives from coast to coast; and 
second (much the stronger we fear) a feeling that we have done 
our very best and are willing to be judged according to the standard 
of the very best cook books. 

For six months this committee composed of some of the most 
prominent women of the state, has labored almost unceasingly to 
present to other women who honor their profession as housewives 
the recipes which thousands consider to be their choicest. Each 
of these recipes has been thoroughly tested by the contributor, and 
after reaching us has been censored by the Home Economics Direc- 
tor, Miss Mary Means of the Girls' High School Faculty. We re- 
gret deeply that space could not be found for every one of the 
delicious recipes sent us, but the necessity for having, as nearly 
as possible, an evenly balanced book, and one in which every 
direction is clearly stated, and with no duplicates, caused many to 
be eliminated by the censor. Some recipes will be found in other 
places in the book, where they seemed more necessary. 

The fact that this cook book is published by the Home Econo- 
mics Department of our club renders it necessary for it to conform 
to the rules for service inaugurated by this Department for its 
members. Accordingly the wording of each recipe has been given 
more plainly than is customary in most cook books, so it will form 
not only an excellent hand book for our own members, but may 
be easily used by those hitherto entirely unfamilar with cooking 

Altho this volume specializes in typical Southern recipes, 
it also contains many choice tid-bits from other sections owing 
to the cosmopolitan character of the Woman's Club membership, 
which numbers many residents formerly from other parts of the 
United States. 

In omitting special menus, which in our experience rarely can 
be used exactly as printed, we have substituted instead the order, 
of recipes naturally followed during the day, leaving the house- 
wife the liberty of choice. 

Chairmen for our chapter have been selected because of es- 
•pecial fitness for the work. Each has taken the greatest pride in 
the collection of recipes and their arrangement. They should not, 
however, be held responsible for any omission of recipes, as that 
necessarily had to be decided by the censor and the editors. 

It was not required that recipes contributed should be ab- 
solutely original, as so few really can be, but that they should have 
been in use by the contributor or some close friend for some time. 



In view of the fact that all money from the sale of this book 
goes towards the building fund of our wonderful new auditorium — 
that temple of unselfish service— we ask that our club members 
deal lovingly with this book, that each purchase at least one for her- 
self or a friend, that each encourage its sale in every way possible 
and that all criticisms, for or against, be given to the editors to the 
end that the next edition may benefit thereby. 

Even before this goes to press hundreds of dollars have been 
sent together with addresses to our Sales-Chairman, Mrs. Alonzo 
Richardson, 682 West Peachtree St., Atlanta, Ga. The cook books 
are two dollars each and out of town orders should be accompanied 
by ten cents (10c) postage. 

In conclusion we thank most heartily those who have in any 
way contributed to the success of the cook book and if, as we hope, 
it becomes part of the necessary kitchen equipment in thousands 
of homes we will feel we have not labored in vain.

CHAPTER I. 



THE SECRET OF KITCHEN HAPPINESS. 
Mrs. Newton C. Wing, Chairman Home Economics. 



House-work may be made either a delight or drudgery, accord- 
ing to the mental attitude which accompanies it. It is impossible, 
naturally, to love one's house-work, if one does not have the proper 
equipment and if one's house, especially the kitchen, is not properly 
arranged, ventilated and lighted. 

We realize that few houses are built which follow any scientific 
arrangement as to the kitchen. Speed the day when the architect 
and the experienced house wife will together plan all kitchens. In 
building a new house, the housewife should insist on having the 
kitchen built as she desires, always considering, of course that it 
harmonizes with the general architectural plans of the house. 

Even if a house wife employs servants, she can not secure that 
servant's contentment or best efforts, unless she saves her time and 
strength by labor-saving methods. 



MORE EFFICIENCY MAY BE SECURED 

I. By having a small kitchen, (but not crowded). 

II. By covering walls with washable materials such as tile, 
enamel, or any good washable paint. 

III. By covering the floor with linoleum, one with dark back- 
ground being preferred. Wax well after laying. 

IV. By grouping certain apparatus and utensils, according to 
their use. Common sense shows that many steps are avoided if: 

First — The sink, with its two large drain boards, one on each 



side, is placed next to the dining room or pantry. Ideal arrange- 
ment consists in having a dish-window opening directly between the 
dish-closet and the sink. This should be large enough to allow the 
passage of the wire dish drainer filled with dishes. Soiled dishes 
are placed on right hand drain board, where they are picked up by 
the dish-washer's right hand, scrubbed under running water, by 
brush held in left hand, and then placed in dish pan. When pan is 
full, place one tablespoon of washing powder over dishes (this is 
enough to cut grease, but does not make water soapy) , fill pan with 
very hot water. With dishmop tilt plates until easily grasped by 
left hand, rub with dish mop, and place in dish drainer at left. Very 
much hotter water may be used than in the old fashioned way of 
using a dishcloth, — the hot water filling the two-fold purpose of 
cleaning the dishes and making them dry more easily. When 
drainer is full, pass thru dish-window or carry to dish-closet. This 
leaves room for washing cooking dishes and by the time these are 
done the china dishes are dry and sparkling and may be put away 
in the china closet without wiping. This is much more sanitary 
than the old way of wiping with dish towel, which is never perfectly 
dry and clean except for the first dish. Towels of best linen 
toweling should of course be used for glasses and silver. Sinks and 
tables are generally built too low. Housewives should msist on 
having sinks built, so that, without stooping, one may touch the 
inside floor of the sink with the flat of the hand. The same holds 
good with the tables (note the height of kitchen cabinet table). 
For the average person, the height of sinks, etc., should be 36 inches. 

Second — The stove should be next to dining room door on the 
other side from the sink to facilitate serving. Thus a tea wagon 
can be used both to take food directly from the stove to the dining 
room table and also to bring soiled dishes from the table to the sink. 

Third — Grouped on opposite side from the stove, should be 
the kitchen cabinet, and working table with store closet near. If 
table is on casters, it can be rolled over near table or sink when 
needed. 

Fourth — If the kitchen is sufficiently large there should be 
a rest corner with a desk and bookcase above for working on 
kitchen accounts and for keeping cook books thus utilizing the 
spare minutes which often occur in the kitchen while meals are 
cooking. 



CHAPTER II. 



NECESSARY KITCHEN EQUIPMENT. 

Two factors cause much loss of time in most kitchens : the 
first arises from the use of old worn-out tools, and the second be- 
cause of an insufficient supply of utensils adapted to certain uses. 

Kitchen equipment should always be kept near the place in 
the kitchen where it is to be used. In most homes the kitchen 
cabinet becomes the receptacle for most of the articles used in the 
preparation of the meals and therefore will be treated first in this 
article. Keep in mind that the utensils used most often should be 
kept where most accessible, i. e., in top drawers, while other seldom 
used articles may be packed away. As various kitchen cabinets 
have different spaces, the following arrangement is merely sugges- 
tive. 



THE KITCHEN CABINET SHOULD CONTAIN 

All spices, baking powder (Royal), salt, pepper, tea, coffee, 
sugar, soda, flour, corn-starch, cocoa, chocolate, Worcestershire 
Sauce, catsup, canned salad dressing (for seasoning), flavoring ex- 
tracts, crackers, canned soups, pimentos, and other canned products 
for an emergency meal.

CHAPTER III. 

BUDGETING YOUR TIME. 

Introduction by Mrs. B. M. Boykin — President Atlanta Woman's 
Club. 

In these very busy days when every woman is working, as 
she thinks, to her greatest capacity and then does not always gel 
through, suppose she stops and takes stock. — She will find that she 
could have done much more and been less tired if only she had 
mapped out her day and stuck to her schedule, but she lets every- 
thing hinder her. 

While starting out to buy her groceries somebody called and 
talked so long over the 'phone she was late. Consequently, after 
marketing she was late to her engagement and so on. Let us learn 
to shorten unnecessary conversation, be prompt for each engage- 
ment, conduct our daily lives with the same efficiency which is 
used by business men. A place for everything, everything in its 
place — a time for everything and everything on time ; — leaves plenty 
of opportunity for healthful recreation and, at the same time, a 
consciousness of carrying one's program of work satisfactorily. 

The war helped every woman toward economy. Let us carry 
on now in saving our strength and getting better results from our 
time. 



THE WORKING SCHEDULE IN A HOME ECONOMICS HOUSE- 
HOLD. 

While the following schedule may not fit every one's domestic 
arrangements, yet it may serve as a help to other women in planning 
their work whether done by themselves or by servants. 

This has been found invaluable in training a new servant. 



GENERAL OUTLINE OF WORK. 
Everyday Do The Following 

6:45 to 9:00 — Prepare breakfast and serve: While family is 
eating, have servant sweep front porch and steps ; afterward clear 
table, wash dishes, wipe off kitchen table, kitchen cabinet, stove, 
shelves, etc. Shine all aluminum dishes used for the meal and polish 
oooking utensils. Nothing should be left lying about in the kitchen 
or butler's pantry. Sweep kitchen, butler's pantry and eating porch 
(dining room). Should be thru by about nine. 



GENERAL OUTLINE OF WORK 13 

10 to 10 :30 — All downstairs should be in order : floors swept 
or floor mopped, lavatory cleaned, etc. 

10:30 to 11:00 — Bath room cleaned — Any special job if there 
is time. 

11:30 to 12:00— Prepare lunch. 

AFTERNOON. 

1 :00 to 2 :00 — Do dishes and put kitchen and dining room in 
order. 

2:00' to 4:00 — Any special work assigned for that day (see list 
later) . 

4:00 to 5:00 — Rest or recreation (this always applies to the 
cook). 

5:00 to 7:30 — Prepare dinner, wash dishes and put dining 
room and kitchen in order. 

SPECIAL WORK. 

Leave all special work to time provided in outline. This con- 
sists in cleaning silver, washing windows, straightening up closets, 
drawers, etc., cleaning brass door knobs, mirrors, china closet", 
glass doors and any metals. 

SPECIAL TASKS FOR EACH DAY. 

Monday — Wash anything in the laundry bag which is too delicate 
to send to the washwoman. Cook allowed to wash her own 
things also at this time. 

Tuesday — Do any ironing — clean eating porch, (or dining room). 

Wednesday — Clean kitchen and butler's pantry thoroughly, wash- 
ing all wood work — inside of store closet, outside of boiler, 
scrub floors, clean kitchen cabinet inside and out and the 
stove. See that all utensils are clean. 

Thursday — Follow morning schedule and clean refrigerator also, 

Thursday Afternoon — Half holiday, (applies to the house wife too. 

If acting as cook, she deserves a dinner out) . 
Friday — Clean all upstairs. 
Saturday — Clean all downstairs except kitchen, etc. Bake. 

Sunday Morning— After breakfast see that house is straightened up. 
prepare dinner, and supper which is set away in refrigerator.

QUEEN SWEET POTATO. 

Recipes compiled by Mrs. J. E. Hays, State President Federa- 
ted Women's Clubs. 

A lowly sweet potato am I, 
Tho, you may call me "a poor man's pie," — 
For I'm good to eat without sugar or salt. 
Many are my virtues and I haven't a fault. 

The Sweet Potato, a native of the South, is capable of being 
served in more tempting ways than any other product of the soil — 
it is a vegetable that may be used as a breakfast dish, an entree 
or a dessert, made tempting with very little embellishment. 

Truly a "poor man's pie," given by a generous Maker! It 
contains all the necessary elements, and is easily digested. Geor- 
gians should sing the praises of Queen Sweet Potato, as California 
does the raisin and Ireland the "spud." 

ROAST OPOSSUM, AND SWEET POTATOES 
1 Opossum. 1 dozen sweet potatoes. 

Salt. Black pepper. 

Dress and place opossum (whole) in large pan with one and 
one-half gallons cold water; boil until tender. Drain and place in 
covered roaster — Surround with sweet potatoes (which have pre- 
viously been peeled and boiled). Season with salt and pepper to 
taste. 

Put roaster in oven until both potatoes and possum are crisp 
and brown.

Puree — Vegetables, fish, meats, etc., cooked till tender, then passed 
through a sieve. 

Saute — Cooked brown in a shallow pan, with little fat. 

Fry — Cooked brown in deep fat. 

Souffle — Savory or sweet. Puffed up and made light by well- 
beaten eggs. 



ECONOMY IN GAS. 
Every house-wife may save time and money by observing the 
following: 

I. Have the gas man regulate the flame, so that it will burn 
blue. 

II. Don't use the large burners for small utensils. 

III. After foods come to a boil, use the burner for simmering. 

IV. Always turn off the gas, before removing vessels from 
the stove. 

V. Don't allow burners to become clogged with grease. 

VI. A large steamer may be used for cooking several foods 
at once. 

VII. Make use of fireless cooker and pressure cooker. 

VIII. Triplet kettles, and double folding omelet pans may be 
used for cooking two or more things at once. 

IX. When baking or cooking a meal, cook several things at 
once. A whole dinner may be prepared in the oven by having a 
roast, etc., and baked potatoes, vegetables en casserole, and a baked 
dessert. 

X. Although the heat should be turned on an oven (both 
burners) five or ten minutes before using — in most cases one 
burner may be turned off or both burners turned lower, after food 
is placed within. 

XL Every good cook should have a chemical thermometer to 
test oven heat, and this is more easily done when the stove has a 
glass front as opening the oven door causes a drop in temperature. 
There is no such thing as "luck" in cooking. If the conditions are 
controlled by the house-wife as they should be, the results will al- 
ways be the same. ^

COOKING BY RULE. 

Measure! Whether by cup or spoon the only sure way to secure 
success is by accurate measurement. 

All measures should be lerel and only standard vessels used. 
Only an experienced house-keeper repeating her own recipes, can 
measure by eye, or by weight of an object in her hand. 

It is necessary to have in every kitchen a set of measures 
(quart, pint and half -pint; graduated measures divided into 
quarters, halves and thirds are best). For liquids a glass cup

divided and marked on the outside in iA-V2-% and 1 cup, one side 

of the cup ; while on the other is marked 1/3, 2/3 and 1 cup, Avill 

eliminate guess work. 

A set of accurate scales is an absolute necessity in the kitchen 
A set of aluminum measuring spoons are necessary. They 

measure 1 tbls., 1 t-spoon, 1/2 t-spoon and l^ t-spoon.

BREAKFASTS. 

FRUITS IN SEASON. 
Norman Sharp — Chairman City Market. 



Most essential from the standpoint of hygiene is the inclusion 
of fruit in the daily diet, and this in Atlanta is a simple matter, for 
farmers supplying Atlanta's Municipal Curb Market furnish a con- 
tinuous rotation of fruits during the entire year. 

Beginning with the early spring the strawberry is the first 
and one of the most delightful fruits. Strawberries are 
usually served with cream and sugar and are delightful appetizers, 
with which to begin the breakfast menu. Following the straw- 
berry come the no less popular raspberry and blackberry which 
are served with cream and sugar as the first course. The dew- 
berry, a species of blackberry, is popular also. Cherries served 
on individual platters with the stems on make an attractive break- 
fast dish. 

The Georgia peach, famous the world over is well adapted foi 
a breakfast fruit. An attractive breakfast is served with whole 
peeled peaches on individual platters, in the center of which is a 
sugar bowl surrounded with peeled peaches and garnished with 
green peach leaves. 

Then comes the cantaloupe and honey-dew melon, which may 
be served in many artistic and attractive ways — peeled, halved and 
served with crushed ice is one of the most practical methods of 
serving cantaloupe as a breakfast fruit. Some enjoy iced water- 
melon also, a fruit for which Georgia is famous. Figs peeled and 
served whole with cream and sugar constitute a delicious breakfast 
course. Later come the plum and grape, which are served most 
attractively in a large fruit bowl, which graces the center of the 
breakfast table and is passed and served from individually. Scup- 



BREAKFAST 37 

pernongs, a light green, and muscadines, a purple brown, are thick 
skinned and resemble grapes. 

For the fall and winter breakfast the apple reigns supreme and 
may be prepared in a variety of appetizing ways. Perhaps the most 
popular is the baked apple. Apple sauce is another favorite 
Southern breakfast course. To prepare, peel apples, quarter 
and stew until tender with a few slices of lemon ; after which rub 
through colander with spices, sweeten to taste and serve cold with 
or without cream. 

During the winter months Georgia calls on her sister state, 
Florida, for grapefruit and oranges, which may be served in many 
ways and are used extensively for breakfast menus. 



BREAKFAST CEREALS, 

Mrs. J. A. Carlisle, Chairman Cook Book. 

Of the many varieties of cereals, all are lacking in fats, so they 
are more nutritious if butter or cream and sugar are served with 
the cooked cereals (only cream and sugar with the uncooked) . Most 
cooked cereals are very indigestible if cooked less than one hour. 
When preparing the evening meal, cook cereal in a double boiler 
for an hour or more, then place (covered) on back of stove. Next 
morning add boiling water to lower boiler and upper boiler if cereal 
is too thick. Cook 10 to 15 minutes and serve. 

Rolled or Quaker Oats should be put to cook in boiling salted 
water,proportions 1 t-spoon of salt to 1 qt. of water, and will cook 
quicker if soaked over night in cold water. To keep out insects, 
when cereals are opened contents should be placed in glass fruit 
jars with lids screwed on tightly. 

OATMEAL— ROLLED OR QUAKER OATS. 
1 cup oats or oatmeal. 3 cups boiling water. 

1/2 t-spoon salt, 
'stir oats and salt gradually in boiling water. If cooked ovei 
direct heat, cook slowly, (stirring occasionally) about 40 minutes 
or cook in double boiler one to two hours. May be placed in fire- 
less cooker over night. 

CREAM OF WHEAT. 
1/2 cup cream of wheat. 21/2 cups water. 

1/2 t-spoon salt. 

Add salt to boiling water, stir in cream of wheat and continue 
stirring a few moments to prevent lumping. Cook slowly over 
direct heat 20 minutes or more, or in double boiler one hour or 
more. Can be placed in tireless cooker three or four hours. Serve 
with cream and sugar. 



38 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 



FINE HOMINY OR GRITS— SOUTHERN. 
Grits, like corn meal, absorb a great deal of water in cooking. 
Cook as other cereals or leave in fireless cooker over night. May 
be eaten with butter or gravy. Pack while warm in one-pound 
baking powder cans, cool, turn out and cut in slices, dip in flour, 
saute in bacon drippings a golden brown. Serve bacon crisp on 
hominy slices for breakfast. 

STEAMED RICE. 
1 cup rice. 3 cups water. 

1 t-spoon salt. 

Wash rice and pour slowly in water boiling briskly. Add salt 
and cook until grains are tender, drain in colander, serve with sugai 
and cream, raisins may be added. Rice should be cooked in double 
boiler. 

BAKED SHREDDED WHEAT. 

Shredded wheat is delicious, when divided into two parts by a 
sharp knife, each part being buttered, placed in the oven and 
heated till crisp. It tastes very much like pop-corn, and may be 
eaten as a sandwich or with milk and sugar. 

Mrs. Newton C. Wing.

(mashed). 
Combine above ingredients together well, let rise in warm place 
three hours. This mixture will keep in ice box several days and is 
used as one would use buttermilk to make biscuit. When ready to 
make rolls, break one egg in bowl, beating slightly, add one cup of 
this yeast mixture (dipping from bottom of bowl) 3 tbls. melted 
fat, 1 tbls. sugar (less if preferred) 1 t-spoon salt, enough flour to 
knead a little but not too stiff, roll out, cut with large size biscuit 
cutter, turn edges together, with dot of butter between making 
pocket book rolls. Let rise 2 hours, bake in moderately quick oven. 
This amount will serve six people. Double or triple the quantity for 
more, but never use more than two eggs. This will also make very 
good bread and rolls.

TRY THIS METHOD OF "PREPARING TOAST". 

Cut bread one half inch thick (or thickness desired) and put 
under flame in gas oven to brown slightly. (Browning process 
should be done quickly; be careful not to scorch.) Remove bread 
put a light spread of butter on one or both sides, return to oven un- 
til a golden brown. This is a little trouble, but toast is crisp and de- 
licious.

CROQUETTES AND EGG DISHES. 

Mrs. Lee Hagan, Chairman. 

Eggs cooked at a low temperature (poached) are more quickly 
digested than eggs cooked at a high temperature (fried). Always 
buy yard or guaranteed eggs as these are cheaper in the end. Eggs 
may be served as a substitute for meat as they have similar food 
value.

pour all into frying pan when it is very hot, reducing the heat as 
soon as it is in. Keep it from sti<!king to the sides, with a silver 
knife, occasionally tilting pan slightly so that liquid parts will run 
underneath and cook. Fold one part over on the other while it is 
still soft, turn out on hot platter, garnish and serve. The trick of 



54 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 

an omelet is to have just the right amount of grease, or else it will 
stick if too little is used or be watery if too much. Bread may be 
omitted, if a smaller omelet is desired, and more milk may be used.

butter substitute, putting half in each side of omelet pan. When 
bubbling hot, pour in an equal amount on each side, of the eggs, 
beaten ; the tomatoes, in which have been soaked the small pieces 
of bread for several minutes and salt and pepper to taste. A? 
soon as the mixture is in it requires less heat. With a silver knife, 
keep it from sticking to the sides and also tilt pan slightly, to allow 
the more liquid parts to get underneath. While still soft, turn one 
half of the omelet over on top of the other half, then turn out on hot 
platter and garnish with parsley ; serve.

LUNCHEONS AND SUPPERS 
SALADS. 

Mrs. Norman Pool, Chairman. 

All salad ingredients should be chilled and all salads should be 
served very cold — Green and fruit salads with French or cooked 
dressings are less fattening than meat and eggs or cheese salads 
with mayonnaise. The beaten white of egg added to mayonnaise 
makes it thicker but holds it longer and gives more mayonnaise. To 
marinate foods let stand in oil, vinegar, salt and pepper.

''The merry chafing-dish bring forth, 

Place in a lump of butter 
Of quality and best renown, 

And at expense don't mutter. 

Of mushrooms now, take teacups two, 

Cut fine, and gently simmer ; 
Ten minutes just about will do — 

Don't scorch, or you're a sinner. 

Of strained tomatoes use a cup, 

A quarter one of cheese ; 
Stir constantly with no let up ; 

Add pepper, if you please. 

Two eggs you next must briskly beat, 

And smoothly make all leaven ; 
Pour over toast — then quickly eat 

And dream you are in Heaven !"

CAKES, FILLINGS, ICINGS AND COOKIES. 

Mrs. Henry A. Manning, Chairman. 

CAKES. 

There are two classes of cake — the sponge and the butter cake. 
The first is less fattening and best for children. All our cakes are 
variations made on the true sponge or on the cup cake recipes. Cakes 
have much food value, which should be remembered in planning a 
meal. 

M. P. Means.

ANGEL CAKE. 

12 egg whites. 10 oz. flour. 

Generous pinch of salt. 4 oz. granulated sugar. 

2 level t-spoons cream of tartar. 1 t-spoon vanilla. 

Have everything ready before breaking the eggs, and proceed 
rapidly. Have eggs thoroughly chilled and avoid having even small 
particles of the yolk of the egg in the whites. Weigh sugar and 
flour, sifting each on a separate piece of paper. Beat eggs, after 
adding salt, till large bubbles disappear ; sift in cream of tartar un- 
til eggs are dry and stiff. (If beaten too long the cake will be dry 
and tough) . Fold in (not beat in) the sugar and then the flour by 



104 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 

sifting a little in at a time. Light the oven and then add vanilla. 
Put in an ungreased aluminum pan and place in oven, about three 
or four inches from the floor of the oven. Reduce gas until it 
looks like rows of beads and let it stay that way for thirty minutes. 
Then increase heat until the gas is nearly full. In 15 minutes more, 
the cake should be a pretty brown all over. As gas pressure and 
sizes of ovens vary, each person must learn by experience just when 
the cake is done, but 45 minutes is the average time. As soon as 
taken out of the oven the cake should be turned up side down and 
left till thoroughly cold. By running a knift around the sides and 
then knocking the sides of the pan on the edge of the kitchen table, 
the cake can be gotten out of the pan in perfect condition. Dust 
powdered sugar over the top or ice the cake according to taste. By 
using a carving knife and dampening it often, the slices may be kept 
even and light. If you press hard on the knife, you will have a 
ragged slice. 

Mrs. R. L. Turman 
ANGEL FOOD CAKE. 

12 egg whites. II/2 cup sugar. 

1/4 t-spoon salt. 1 scant cup flour. 

1 t-spoon cream of tartar. 1 t-spoon vanilla. 

Place the whites in deep bowl, sprinkle in the salt and beal 
with dover egg beater until entirely stiff. Stir in cream of tartar 
This helps the whites to remain stiff. Next, thordughly beat in 
sugar with egg beater or open spoon. Measure a scant cup of flour, 
sift three times and remeasure, filling the cup by gently laying in 
the flour by spoonfuls. This is to insure having a scant and light 
cup of flour. Then fold the flour into the cake mixture, about a 
third at a time. The flour should not be beaten in. Add vanilla 
and pour mixture into an ungreased tin with a funnel center. The 
oven should be quite warm, but not hot, when cake is put in. Let 
heat be moderate throughout the baking, which may be from forty 
to sixty minutes.

ROLLED WAFERS. 

14 cup butter, 7/8 cup bread flour (Capitola). 

14 cup powdered sugar. 1/2 t-spoon vanilla. 

14 cup milk. 

Cream the butter, add sugar gradually, and milk drop by drop ;

long-bladed knife on a buttered inverted dripping pan. Crease in 
3 in. squares, and bake in a slow oven until delicately browned. 
Place pan on back of range, cut squares apart with a sharp knife, 
and roll while warm in tubular or cornucopia shape. If squares 
become too brittle to roll, place in oven to soften. If rolled tubular 
shape, tie in bunches with narrow ribbon. These are very attrac- 
tive, and may be served with sherbet, ice cream, or chocolate. If 
rolled cornucopia shape, they may be filled with whipped cream 
just before sending to table. Colored wafers may be made from 
this mixture by adding leaf green or fruit red. If colored green, 
flavor with 14 t-spoon almond and % t-spoon vanilla. If colored 
pink, flavor with rose. Colored wafers must be baked in a very 
slow oven and turned frequently, otherwise they will not be of uni- 
form color that is desired.

mixture is perfectly smooth. Confectioners at first use the hand, 
afterwards a palette knife which is not only of use for mixing but 
for keeping board clean. Shape, using a pastry bag and tube, on a 
tin sheet covered with buttered paper, 1/2 inch apart; or drop mix- 
ture from tip of spoon in small piles. Macaroon mixture is stiff 
enough to hold its shape, but in baking spreads. Bake 15 or 20 min-

After removing from oven, invert paper, and wet with a cloth 
wrung out of cold water, when macaroons will easily slip off.

CHAPTER X. 

DINNERS. 

SOUPS. 

Mrs. J. M. Manry, Chairman, 

We begin a meal with soup to start the flow of the digestive 
juices. The clear soups have very little food value. All soups 
should be started with cold water, heating slowly, and never allowed 
to cook above the simmering point. 

Mary P. Means. 

CREAM OF ONION SOUP. 

Salt. White pepper. 

2 cups onions. 1 cup milk. 

1 cup of cold water. 2 tbls. flour. 

Place 2 cups of thinly sliced onions in sauce pan and add 1 cup 
of cold water. Cook until soft and then rub thru a fine sieve. 
Measure and return to sauce pan, and add 1 cup of milk for every 
cup of onion puree and 2 level tbls. flour to every cup of milk. Stir 
to dissolve flour then bring to a boil and cook slowly for 5 mins. 
Season, using salt and white pepper. Serve, then add 1 tbl. of but- 
ter to every qt. of cream soup. Croutons or toasted strips of bread 
make a delicious accompaniment to the cream soup. (See receipe) 
for croutons. 

Method Of Preparing Croutons. 

Cut slices of bread into one-inch blocks, and place on a baking 
sheet and bake until golden brown. Place in a tin box or jar and 
seal. When ready to use just reheat to crisp and then serve. Stale 
bread may be used for this purpose.

LOBSTER. 

Lobster to be edible should be perfectly fresh. One of the 
tests of freshness is to draw back the tail ; if it springs into position 
again, it is safe to think the fish good. 

The time of boiling varies with the size of the lobster and in 
different localities. In Boston and other places on the Massachu- 
setts coast, the time is fifteen or twenty minutes for large lobsters 
and ten for small. 

The usual way is to plunge them into a pot with enough boiling 
water in the bottom to create a steam without boiling dry. Cover 
tightly. There are few ways of cooking lobster in which it should 
be more than thoroughly heated, as much cooking toughens it and 
destroys the fine delicate flavor. 

Mrs. R. T. Cresse, 

Boston, Mass. 
STEWED LOBSTER. 

1 tbls. butter. 14 lemon.

salt to taste cayenne and lemon juice. Make a sauce of 1 tbls. of 
flour 1/2 cup of water and 1 tbls. of butter. Add the seasoned lobster 
and simmer five minutes — serve.

POULTRY. 

Mrs. C. E. Cresse, Chairman. 

To dress poultry. After the bird is picked, singe hairs over a 
flame. Cut off head, draw out pin feathers. Then cut thru skin 
around joint of leg and draw out tendons, by holding upper leg in 
left hand and slipping a skewer under each cendcn and pulling it 
from the flesh. Break joint and leg can be removed with the tough 
tendons. Cut through skin carefully below breastbone and with 
the hand loosen and remove organs. The crop may be removed 
from the other end of bird, with wir.dpipe. Wash bird out with 
water, or soda and water, being careful to remove all bits of lung. 

ROAST TURKEY. 

(Chestnut Dressing) . 



1 turkey (10 to 14 lb.) 


Sage. 


1 loaf dry bread. 


1 lb. of chestnuts, 


2 tbls. butter. 


1 cup celery. 


1 small onion. 


1 egg. 


1 apple. 


Parsley. 



Select a plump turkey, draw and wash thoroughly. Make 
stuffing of bread, season with salt, pepper, butter, sage. Add 
onion and celery chopped fine, and the chestnuts hulled and scalded, 
to take off the inner coating, add the well beaten egg, and enough 
hot water to moisten. Place apple in the crop — the juice tends to 
keep the turkey moist and the blending of the different savors, gives 
a delicious flavor. It must not be pasty, therefore use chopping 
knife or large mixing knife to work ingredients together. Do 
not allow to brown much the first hour. Time required 3 hours. 
Oysters may be substituted for chestnuts.

GAME. 

VENISON. 

Roast venison is best to be thoroughly larded, using half a 
pound of pork to a leg or saddle weighing eight to ten pounds. Cut 
the flanks from saddle and trim the haunch to good shape. 

Roast according to general directions, basting at the end of 
the first five minutes, and every fifteen minutes after. It is very 
nice to use claret instead of the dripping of the pan. An hour and 
a quarter will cook it very rare. For most people an hour and three 
quarters will be none too much. Make a good gravy from the drip- 
pings in the pan, adding stock made from bits trimmed away before 
roasting. 

Currant jelly is usually served with it, but barberry, or wild 
plum jelly is equally as good. Mrs. Beulah Bates. 

VENISON STEAKS. 
Venison steaks are prepared and served like beef steaks, cut- 
ting them only about three quarters of an inch thick. Slices of cold 
roast venison are extremely nice when reheated in brown or curry 
sauce. Mrs. Anice Carlton.

xMEATS. 

Mrs. J. M. Manry, Chairman. 

To obtain a tender roast, a steak, or chops, meat should be 
cooked at a low temperature after the first few minutes, in a cov- 
ered roaster — this saves the flavor, does away with basting, and 
gives a tender dish. Water should never be added to the tender cuts 
while cooking, if cooked in this way.

VEGETABLES. 

Mrs, Ernest Covington, Chairman. 

Some vegetables should be cooked a long time, such as carrots, 
beets, parsnips, etc., but vegetables like cauliflower and cabbage re- 
quire only short cooking. Cabbage should never be boiled longer 
than 25 minutes. All vegetables should be put on in boiling salted 
water. Vegetables are more easily digested when served hot with 
butter, sauces, or meat, than when served cold with vinegar.

Greens should be tender and fresh. If wilted, soak in cold 
water 1 hour. Wash well one peck, or desired amount, cutting off 
small roots. Put greens in large uncovered boiler, filling two-thirds 
full of boiling water. If greens are old enough to have large stems 
to leaves, these should be removed and discarded. This boiling takes 
away the bitter taste, which so many find objectionable. Drain 
greens, add small pieces of sliced salt pork, cook in 1 qt, boiling 
water for II/2 hours more, (Time in cooking depends on how 
young and tender greens are). Water may be added as it boils 
away. Water should be evaporated by time greens are ready to 

serve,

DAINTY DESSERTS. 

Mrs. J. B. Dinwiddie, Chairman. 

Frozen desserts prolong the digestion of a meal, as does a sweet 
taste, and so are used to finish a meal. There is little food value in 
water ices, gelatine deserts or cold beverages outside of this fact — 
pies, ice-creams, puddings, and custards are rich in food value which 
should be remembered in planning a meal.

THRIFT CHAPTER. 



Recipes Compiled by Mrs. E. B. Havis, Jr. 
Co-Chair. Sudie Heard Memorial Com. 

IN MEMORIAM, SUDIE HEARD, CHAIRMAN. 

It is eminently fitting that this chapter of this book should be 
prefaced by a few words concerning one who during the war period 
stood for Thrift in its every phase. Mrs. Heard talked thrift ; she 
worked for thrift; she lived thrift, because it was the duty of the 
moment ; it was the call of her Government to her patriotism. She 
answered this call as she did every other call to duty, with every 
fibre of her whole being. She never did anything in a half hearted 
way. 

When the cook book was planned, her ready response to the sug- 
gestion of a Thrift Chapter, and her acceptance of the responsibility 
of such a chapter, gave encouragement to those in charge, but the 
call to "Come up Higher" came to her, and like a tired little child 
she lay down to rest, secure in the thought that in the very love and 
co-operative spirit her example had engendered, those who loved 
her would carry on her work to completion. 

It is in this spirit, the desire to go on with her work, as nearly 
as possible in her way, in loving memory of Mrs. Heard, her co- 
workers present this Chapter.

CHAPTER XIII. 

ATLANTA PIONEER CHAPTER. 

Mrs. Lollie Belle Wylie — Chairman. 



The Atlanta Woman's Pioneer Society is an organization of 
women residing in Atlanta since the city was a little place called 
Terminus, in 1847, later Marthasville, (for Miss Martha 
Lumpkin), and later Atlanta, named by Joseph Thompson, a civil 
engineer, and Colonel Richard Peters. The name is a coined one, 
and was probably suggested by the Atlantic ocean, Atlanta being in 
a way the feminine for Atlantic. 

In February, 1909, Mrs. Joseph H. Morgan called together the 
women who were residents of Terminus, Marthasville and Atlanta, 
from 1847 to 1870. Fifty prominent women met and organized into 
the "Atlanta Woman's Pioneer Society." There are about 90 mem- 
bers. 

The organization has for its purpose the renewing and perpet- 
uation of early friendships, and the preservation of historical facts 
and reminiscences of early Atlanta. 

Atlanta Woman's Pioneer Society was the first to establish a 
permanent Memorial Service for its members and this is an annual 
event with the organization. It is held the first Wednesday in 
April. An annual picnic is a feature of the social life of the society. 
The picnics assemble both pioneer men and women. 

Mrs. Joseph H. Morgan is the founder of the society and its 
president for life. The members are home makers, mothers and 
wives aft«r the old fashion. They are not politicians, and though 
the members belong to modern organizations for women and take 
part in church, civic and social life, as individuals, they do no work

in the Pioneer Society but meet and talk over old times when pota- 
toes were not bought by the pound, or eggs sold by the twos and 
threes. They have seen their tables literally groan under the weight 
of southern dishes, and the following recipes have been contributed 
by several of the members.

The Home Economics Department wishes to acknowledge its 
indebtedness to Mrs. John McDougald of Atlanta and Mrs. Lamar 
Rucker of Athens, daughters of Mrs. Nellie Peters Black, for the 
recipes which head the Pioneer Chapter. 

Mrs. Black was known to all the Southland as a Pioneer in 
thought and in deed. President, as she was, of the Georgia State 
Federation of Women's Clubs, she utilized to the utmost the oppor- 
tunity presented for making acquaintance with all of the women in 
the state, and particularly the women in the remote farming dis- 
tricts, To them she carried the message of service to Georgia and 
to the world — she taught them and their husbands the new idea of 
diversified farming. She was among the first in Georgia to see the 
handwriting on the wall which doomed the "one-crop" idea, that of 
cotton,- and through her precepts and powerful example, she taught 
them that Georgia could raise her own food stuffs. Owner of large 
plantations herself and familiar with every detail in their manage- 
ment, a splendid housewife and mother, she taught not only by pre- 
cept but through experience. The recipes given below have been 
shared by Mrs. Black with many Georgia housewives, and we hope 
through the Cook Book, will help many more. — (The Editors.) 

GRAPE NUT JAM. 

3 pts. grape pulp. 1 lb. nuts in shell. 

3 lbs. sugar. 1 lb. seedless raisins. 

Pop the pulp from grapes, cook until tender, save half of the 
skins, cut in half with scissors and cook in separate vessel until ten- 
der, with enough water to cover them. Cook pulp until seeds come 
out then rub through colander, then add skins, nuts, raisins and 
sugar. Cook until it jellies. Put in jelly glasses and seal with wax. 

HOT STUFF OR CHILI SAUCE. . 

1/2 peck onions. 2 qts. vinegar. 

1/2 peck green bell peppers. 1 cup brown sugar. 

1/2 peck green hot peppers. 1 tbls. salt. 

1 peck ripe tomatoes. 1 oz. celery seed. 

Peel tomatoes after scalding in hot water, then cut up. Grind 
other ingredients in meat grinder, put all together and cook an hour 
or more until mellow and brown looking. Delicious with roast beef.

MIXED YELLOW PICKLE ("Miss Nellies" PICKLE). 
2 qts. cabbages. . . i gallon water. 

2 qts. green tomatoes. 2 cups salt. 

2 qts. onions. i cup mustard. 

3 red bell peppers. 2 tbls. tumeric. 
3 hot peppers. i cup flour. 

8 green bell peppers. 4 cups sugar. 

3 heads celery. 2 tbls. celery seed. 

2 qts. cucumbers. % cup Wesson oil. 

2 qts. vinegar. 2 tbls. mustard seed. 

Chop vegetables fine or put through coarse meat grinder, cover 
with salt and water for 24 hours. Drain and dry with towel. Mix 
dry ingredients with vinegar making paste and gradually adding 
the 2 quarts, mixing well. Boil, stirring to prevent burning, until 
thick. Add vegetables, boil a few moments. Add the Wessons oil 
when cool. 

GRAPE JUICE. 

Wash and cover the quantity of grapes to be used, with water. 
Cook well. Strain through jelly bag. To each quart of juice after 
it is strained, add one cup of sugar. Then to each gallon of juice 
add one quart of water. Let this boil 15 to 20 minutes. Put while 
boiling hot, in warm bottles, cork well and seal with paraffin. The 
Concord grapes so rich in meat and flavor make the best grape 
juice. This makes an excellent substitute for the wine we formerly 
had to offer a guest when calling, and comes ''within the law."

CHAPTER XIV. 

FAMOUS CREOLE DISHES. 

Mrs. Marie Hubert, Chairman. 



FOREPIECE. 

Creole cookery — magic words! So often a misnomer, being 
used for concoctions a Creole would never recognize. Within this 
chapter, on the contrary, will be found, an intimate glimpse into a 
genuine Creole kitchen. Mrs. Marie Hubert, herself a Creole, of 
distinguished ancestry, and a famous cuisiniere, contributes recipes 
which have been in her family for generations, and many of which 
have been priceless. The Atlanta Woman's Club, and our cook book 
readers, owe Mrs. Hubert much. 

The Editors. 

FISH A LA CREOLE. 
"Nature has blessed New Orleans with a greater abundance 
and variety of fish, both salt and fresh water kinds, than any other 
place in the country and the epicurean Creole has taken advantage 
of this munificence by devising strange and wonderful combina- 
tions, that are at once the delight and despair of the visitor." 

NEW ORLEANS OYSTER LOAF. 
2 doz. large oysters. 1 loaf stale bread. 

2 eggs. Salt and pepper. 

Corn meal. Kettle full of boiling fat. 

Split the loaf lengthwise, and toast the inner sides, butter gen- 
erously and put away to keep hot. Drain the oysters, salt and pep- 
per and dip into the eggs, which have been beaten until light; then 
into sifted cornmeal. Place in wire frying basket and immerse in 
boiling fat. When they are a golden brown in color, remove from 



212 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 



the fat, and place between the halves of toasted and buttered bread. 
Serve at once. Pickles, catsup and horseradish are usually served 
at the same time. 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

The same rule may be followed for fried oysters as that given 
for New Orleans Oyster Loaf, with the exception that the oysters 
after being fried are placed on a serving dish, and garnished v/ith 
sliced pickles, lemon slices, and triangles of toast. 

RECIPE FOR MAKING CUBION. 
A Great New Orleans Recipe. 
2 tbls. lard. 6 tomatoes. ^ 

6 green sweet peppers, (sliced) 3 large onions. 

Smother above ingredients in lard ; when cooked, add 5 lbs. red 
or any other good fish. Add salt, black and cayenne pepper to taste. 
Cover tightly and cook for about twenty minutes ; then it will be 
ready to serve. 

GREEN PEPPERS STUFFED WITH SHRIMP 

1 lb. fresh lake shrimp or Bay loaf. 

1 cup canned shrimp. Salt and pepper. 

6 slices toasted bread. 6 large green peppers, (seeds 

1 onion. removed). 

2 cloves of garlic. 1 green pepper (minced). 
1/2 cup olive oil or drippings. 

Brown the onions and garlic in hot fat, add three cups of hot 
water, the toast, which should have been soaked in water, then 
squeezed dry, the minced green pepper, the shrimp, bay-leaf, salt 
and pepper. Let the mixture cook down until thick, stirring from 
the bottom as it browns. Remove from the fire ,and fill the peppers, 
from which the seeds should have been removed. Fill a baking pan 
about one-third full of hot water, lay the stuffed peppers in this, and 
bake forty five minutes in a hot oven. 

CRAB SALAD. 

1/2 doz, crabs. 1 bunch celery. 

Put crabs in boiling water, and boil 20 minutes with plenty of 
salt and red pepper, when cool, pick out meat. The crab meat is 
sweet and the flavor must not be destroyed by too much seasoning. 
Mix crab meat, celery and 1/2 pt. mayonnaise and you will have a 
delicious salad. 

TARTAR SAUCE FOR FISH AND CRABS. 

Make a tartar sauce of mayonnaise with a few sprigs of pars- 
ley and pickles chopped fine, a few capers and some onion juice to 
taste. Delicious when served with tenderloin trout, soft shelled 
crabs or any fish where tartar sauce is required. 

SHRIMP AND TOMATO SALAD. 
1 lb. fresh shrimp or 1 small green pepper (minced). 



FAMOUS CREOLE DISHES 213 



1 cup canned shrimp. Lettuce leaves. 

6 large firm tomatoes. Mayonnaise. 

1 stalk heart celery, (chopped) 

With a small spoon, scoop out the center of the tomatoes. The 
flesh may be set aside for soup or stews. Cut the shrimp in small 
pieces. A small onion is an addition. Bind together with a little 
mayonnaise, fill the tomatoes and set on ice. Serve on lettuce leaf 
and garnish with nasturtiums and top with a spoonful of mayon- 
naise. 

GUMBO A LA CREOLE. 

As one advertiser has it, this is the soup that made New Orleans 
famous. It is a great fast day soup, as it is so substantial that it con- 
stitutes a whole meal in itself, when served with the dry boiled rice 
that invariably accompanies it. The beef brisket is usually sliced 
and served with mustard or horseradish, as the meat course that 
follows when used other than a fast day meal. 

6 crabs (boiled and cleaned). Large onion and garlic minced. 

1 lb. lake shrimp (boiled and 2 t-spoons file. 

cleaned). 1 qt. okra (sliced). 

1 lb. beef brisket (if desired). Salt, pepper, bay leaf. 

1 lb. canned tomatoes. 

Brown the onions and garlic in beef drippings or butter. Then 
add okra and cook until that is brown, then add the shrimp and 
brown that. Put into a soup pot and cover with two quarts hot 
water. Salt and pepper the brisket, dredge with flour and brown on 
both sides in a little fat. Add this to the soup, also the tomatoes, 
crabs, the claws and bodies of which should be broken ; add season- 
ing last, cover pot and allow to simmer 2 hours. When ready to 
serve, place some of the crabs in each soup plate with a serving of 
gumbo ; a tbls. of boiled rice is served with each helping at the table. 
The crabs are eaten with the fingers. 

BOILED RICE A LA CREOLE. 

2 cups head rice. 2 qts. salted boiling water. 
Wash rice, stir into boiling water little at a time so as not to 

disturb the boiling; boil hard for 20 minutes, remove, place in col- 
ander and blanch with cold water, drain, put in pot, cover tightly 
and set on back of stove and allow to steam for 20 minutes or more. 
Each flake of rice should stand separate. 

VEAL DAUBE GLACE A LA CREOLE. 
"Much Used In Ante-Bellum Days." 

3 lb. shoulder of veal. 1 large can tomatoes. 

2 tbls. granulated gelatine. 1 large onion (minced. 

Bay leaf. Garlic as desired. 

Have shoulder boned, rolled and tied instead of skewered. Salt 
and pepper, dredge with flour and brown in hot fat. Remove from 
pan and brown the onions and garlic in the fat, add gelatine, toma- 
toes, 2 quarts hot water and seasoning. Return veal to vessel, cover 



214 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 



closely and simmer until very tender, then remove very carefully to 
avoid breaking and place in a mold. Pour over enough stock to 
cover veal, allow to cool, then place on ice. When ready to serve dip 
mold an instant in boiling water, turn out on platter in which it is 
to be served. Slice and garnish with parsley.

2 large egg plants. 1 large onion. 

■ 6 slices toasted bread. Several cloves of garlic minced. 

V2 cup olive oil or butter. Bay leaf, salt and cayenne. 

Cut egg plant lengthwise and scoop out inside without break- 
ing the skin. Boil skin and all until tender, then remove skins to 
buttered baking dish and fill with the following mixture. Fry 
onion and garlic a dark brown in the fat, add egg plant pulp, the 
toasted bread (broken into bits) salt, cayenne and bay leaf. Let 
simmer until thick and brown, stirring from the bottom constantly. 

EGG BREAD AS MADE IN THE SOUTH. 
2 cups white corn meal. 14 cup lard or butter melted. 

2 eggs. Buttermilk to make stiff batter. 

1 tbls. soda in 2 tbls. hot water. 1 t-spoon salt. 

1 tbls. sugar. 1 cup buttermilk. 

Beat eggs until light, add buttermilk, salt, sugar and melted

in a little hot water and stir thoroughly in the above mixture, (add- 
ing a little more milk if batter is not right consistency) . Pour into 
well greased hot pan ; cook in moderate oven until top is a golden 
brown. Do not have batter more than one-half inch thick in pan be- 
fore baking. Cut in squares, split and butter generously ; eat hot. 

NEW ORLEANS PRALINES. 

2 cups powdered sugar. 1/2 cup of cream. 

1 cup maple syrup. 2 cups pecan meats (whole). 

Boil sugar, cream and syrup together until mixture forms soft 
ball tested in cold water. Beat until smooth and creamy, then stir

Hubert's mayonnaise and freeze as you would ice cream. Serve on 
fancy ferns. 



CHAPTER XV. 

SCIENTIFIC CANNING. 
State Agricultural College. 

By Miss Mary Cresswell, State Director Home Economics, 
Mrs. Bessie Stanley Wood, Assistant State Agent. 

A healthful diet demands the use of fruits and vegetables 
every day in the year. Of these the most necessary for health, as 
wellas the most neglected, are the green vegetables which appear 
on many tables only during a brief season. Their use can be made 
possible during the entire year and the health and prosperity of the 
home greatly increased by canning the surplus products, which 
would otherwise be wasted. 

For home use, glass jars are more economical because they can 
be used many times, and with care will last for years. New rubbers 
must be used each year, and it pays to get the best quality of red 
rubbers. 

When screw cap jars are used, new caps are usually essential 
for success. The best type of jar for home use is one with so-called 
"lightning" seal, having glass lid and wire clamp. This lid is not 
only more sanitary, but can be used as long as the jar lasts. For in- 
termittent processing the lightning seal jars are suitable, because 
the lifting of the wire clamp each day during processing insures 
that the jar will not be broken by expansion and the rubber not 
worn by the unscrewing of the cap. 

TYPES OF CANNERS. 
In choosing a canner the kind and amount of canning to be 
done should be considered. The least expensive of the commercial 
outfits is the small hot-water canner. Some of the advantages are 
that it is easily handled by inexperienced people and it is also pref- 
erable to other canners for processing fruits and tomatoes. The 
texture, flavor and color of the finished products so processed at 
boiling temperature are superior to those which have been canned 
at higher temperature. 

Hot Water Canner, 
An outfit which can be placed on the kitchen stove, is the sim- 
plest form of hot-water canner. Blanching trays, a false bottom, 
tongs for handling hot jars are also included in these outfits. There 
are several types of portable canners on the market at very reason- 
able prices. 

Steam Pressure Canner, 
Another type of canning outfit is one which is constructed of 
strong material and provided with a closely fitting lid. When in 



216 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 

operation it is possible to hold steam under pressure and obtain a 
correspondingly high temperature, but since the canner is made of 
heavy material a greater degree of heat is required to bring the 
temperature up quickly. This canner has a steam gauge and ther- 
mometer attached to the lid and these register the temperature and 
the corresponding number of pounds of pressure. Much time, la- 
bor and fuel can be saved by using a steam pressure canner. 

Preparation of Vegetables. 
In securing a fine quality, much depends upon having the vege- 
tables or fruit absolutely fresh, crisp and clean, and kept cool. Have 
all surroundings and utensils spotlessly clean, and carry on all steps 
from beginning to end of any lot of canning as rapidly as possible. 
A good slogan is "one hour from the field to the can". First have 
cans and lids thoroughly washed and scalded. Sort and grade fruit, 
discarding all defective ones, and use together those of same size. 
Use only uniformly well ripened products. In canning, the flavor is 
retained only when young, tender, quickly grown vegetables are 
used, 

STEPS TAKEN IN CANNING IN GLASS. 

1. Sorting and grading fruit or vegetables, washing, peeling, 
etc. 

2. Scalding, peeling and, coring (for tomatoes). Put into trays 
and lower into boiling water for one minute. Remove at once to 
prevent cooking. Plunge into cold water to make the fruit firm, 
and peel promptly. In tomato peeling use a slender pointed knife 
to cut out the core and be careful not to cut into the seed cells. Keep 
the tomatoes whole when possible. 

3. Blanching consists of plunging the vegetables or fruit into 
boiling water for a short time. Use a wire basket or cheese cloth 
square for this. The blanch gives a more thorough cleaning, re- 
moves the strong odor and flavor from certain kinds of vegetables, 
improves the texture and gives a clearer liquor. It also shrinks the 
fruit or vegetable and makes it more flexible. A full pack is then 
more easily made. The time required for blanching varies with the 
state of maturity. Beans should be blanched until tender enough 
to bend without breaking. Peaches will pack better if blanched for 
an instant in water below boiling (about 180 degrees F.), lowering 
peaches into it for fifteen seconds. The same blanch will make the 
hard varities of pears pack better and give them a more transpar- 
ent appearance; and used for cherries will prevent splitting and 
cracking. Spraying fruit with cold water after blanching will make 
it firmer. Frequently it is well to put the vegetables into cold water 
for an instant after blanching to make more crisp. In blanching 
asparagus, tie a few stalks into each bundle, lower bundles into 
water, tips up, blanching the lower ends one or two minutes before 
immersing the tips. Blanch the tips only two or three minutes. 

4. Packing. After selecting fruit or vegetables for uniformity 
in ripeness and size and after blanching, it should be arranged with 



SCIENTIFIC CANNING 217 



reference to symmetry and the best use of the space with the jar. 
In placing the fruit or vegetables in a jar, a thin, slender, flexible 
paddle made out of cane is useful. This paddle is also used to take 
out bubbles of air by running it down the side of the jar to touch 
these bubbles after the liquor has been added to the pack. 

5. Adjustment' Before placing the cap be sure that the rub- 
ber is flattened in its groove, without the presence of any seed or 
particle of the fruit. When a screw top jar is used, screw the cap 
evenly about half way. When a glass top jar with wire clamp is 
used, place lid on evenly and raise both clamps up, the upper one 
fastened to hold the lid in place. With an hermetic jar, fasten the 
cap on the jar evenly with the clamp. The last jar is self-sealing as 
it cools. The clamp must not be removed until the jar is entirely 
cold. 

6. Processing. Place the jars in a water bath on a rack 
(wooden one best) to avoid breaking. Have water the same tem- 
perature as the contents, letting it come to within two inches of the 
top of jars. Have a tight cover for the vessel to keep in the steam. 
Do not count time until the water begins to boil; keep it boiling 
steadily for the time required. Seal the jars airtight promptly at 
end of processing and remove them from the bath, being careful 
not to allow a cold draft to strike them. In intermittent process- 
ing, raise the clamp of each jar at the beginning of each process- 
ing to allow for expansion. Seal at close of each processing. The 
hermetic jar is not a suitable one for intermittent processing. 

7. Label and store products in a cool, dry, dark place. 

SYRUPS. 

In the instructions for canning fruits, syrups of appropriate 
density for standard products are indicated. These are made of 
varying densities, as indicated by a Balling saccharometer. Each 
syrup indicated by number represents the degrees from 10 to 50 de- 
grees. No. 1 syrup is of 10 degrees density. No. 2 of 20 degrees 
density, and so on. 

To make these syrups, boil sugar and water together in the pro- 
portion given below until sugar is dissolved. Strain all impurities 
out of the syrup before using : 

Syrup No, 1 use 14 oz. to 1 gal. water. 
Syrup No. 2 use 1 lb. 14 oz. to 1 gal. water. 
Syrup No. 3 use 3 lb. 9 oz. to 1 gal. water. 
Syrup No. 4 use 5 lb. 8 oz. to 1 gal. water. 
Syrup No. 5 use 6 lb. 13 oz. to 1 gal. water. 



PRESERVING. 

A preserve is the product resulting when fruits are cooked 
in syrup until clear and transparent. When properly made the 



218 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 



fruit in the preserve keeps its form, is plump, tender, clear and of 
good color; the surrounding syrup is also clear and of proper den- 
sity. 

In making preserves, the object is to have the fruit permeated 
with the syrup. It is well known that if two liquids of different 
densities be brought into contact with each oher, they tend to mix 
or diffuse until they equalize each other and become of equal density. 
This diffusion takes place through the cell walls of fruit or vege- 
tables as readily as if they were not present between the fruit juice 
and the denser liquid syrup. When fruit is placed at once in a very 
heavy syrup, the difference in density between the two liquids is so 
great that the syrup absorbs the fruit juice so rapidly that the fruit 
shrinks and becomes shriveled and toughened. The syrup can then 
enter the fruit with great difficulty. In order to prevent this 
shrinking it is necessary to put fruit at first in thin syrup and in- 
crease its density slowly enough for diffusion to take place and the 
fruit be permeated with the syrup. This is done by boiling the fruit 
in syrup or by alternately cooking and allowing the product to stand 
immersed in the syrup, the density of the syrup being increased by 
evaporation or by substituting a heavier syrup for the lighter one 
after each period of standing. If at any time the fruit shrivels or 
wrinkles, the syrup should be made less dense by the addition of 
water. If this process be carried on gradually enough the fruit 
may be completely saturated with sugar (as is the case with crys- 
talized products) without shrinking. 

JAMS AND MARMALADES. 

In making jam the whole fruit is used, but prepared in such a 
way as to give a mixture alike throughout, not having the fruit re- 
main whole and the syrup clear as in preserves. The small fruits 
are ordinarily used for jams, while larger ones are sliced and made 
into marmalades in which the product is not smooth in consistency, 
but has the fruit appearing in small pieces throughout the mixture. 
GRAPE MARMALADE. 

Select grapes about one-half of which are under-ripe rather 
than entirely ripe. Wash and stem the fruit. Separate the pulp 
from the skins. Cook pulps for 10 minutes and press through a 
sieve or colander to remove seeds. Add % cup water to each quart 
of skins and boil until tender. Then put the pulp and skins together 
and measure. For every quart of the mixture, use 1 pound of sugar. 
Bring the fruit to a boil, add the sugar, cook, stirring frequently un- 
til it will give the jelly test or reaches 222 Fahrenheit. Pour into 
sterilized jars and process as for jam and preserves. 

SPICED GRAPES. 

Soften hulls and pulps and combine as for canned grapes. For 
every 5 pounds fresh fruit, use 2-1/2 pounds sugar, 2 ounces ground 
cinnamon, 1-1/2 ounces cloves, 1 cup vinegar. Boil over slow fire 
for one hour. Put into sterilized jars and process pints at simmer- 
ing for 30 minutes.

Cut all, except nuts, into small pieces and cook until thick and 
transparent, about 1 hour. Add nuts five minutes before remov- 
ing from stove. Pack into sterilized jars and process pint jars at 
simmering 30 minutes. 

GRAPE MINCE MEAT. 
Pulp grapes and add 1 cup water to each quart pulps. Boil un- 
til tender and eliminate seed. Run hulls through meat chopper, us- 
ing coarsest plate, and cook until soft. Mix pulp, juice and hulls. 
To each quart of mixture add pulp 1 lemon, ground white rind of 
lemon, 2 cups sugar, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 2 tsp. nutmeg. Boil until 
smooth, thick consistency and it flakes from spoon. Put into ster- 
ilized jars and simmer pints 30 minutes. To a pint of this mince 
meat, add 1 pint chopped apple for making pies. 

GRAPE KETCHUP. 

4 lbs. grapes, 2 tbsp. cinnamon, 1 tbsp. cloves, 1 tbsp. allspice, 
1 cup vinegar, 1 tbsp. salt, 2 lbs sugar, a little cayenne if desired. 

Stew the grapes until soft and remove seeds. Use whole spices 
and tie in a bag to prevent darkening the product. Add the spices, 
sugar, salt and vinegar and simmer for 15 minutes. Put into steril- 
ized bottles and seal. 

PEACH JAM. 

2-1/4 lbs. peaches cut in small pieces, 1 lb. sugar, 1/2 cup juice, 
tsp. bark cinnamon, 5 allspices berries, 1 cracked peach seed, 10 
whole cloves, 1 sprig mace, 1 inch ginger root. Tie spice in cheese 
cloth bag. 

APPLES shrink more in canning than most fruits and for this 
reason should be blanched for one minute. Plunge them into cold 
bath, then pack. Cover with No. 1 syrup. Process quart jars 10 to 
12 minutes. Exhaust No. 3 cans two minutes and process eight 
minutes at boiling temperature (212 Fahrenheit). 

For DEWBERRIES, BLACKBERRIES and RASPBERRIES, 
practically the same methods of canning may be used. The condi- 
tion of the fruit will have much to do with the quality of the product. 
The berries should be gathered in shallow trays or baskets and not 
in deep vessels which allow them to be bruised and crushed. They 
should be uniformly ripe, sound and as large as possible. It is nec- 
essary to can all varieties of berries in glass or else to put them in 
enamel lined cans, because if canned in ordinary tin cans, the berries 
will lose color and flavor very quickly, and be unfit for use for sale. 

The flavor of canned berries will be finer if sugar is used in 
canning. It is best to make this into a syrup. The use of berry 



220 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 

juice instead of water in this syrup will give a richer color and 
flavor. For fine berries, use a syrup of 30 degrees density (about 
3-1/2 lbs. sugar to- one gal. juice or water). 

After the berries have been carefully sorted and lightly 
washed by placing in colander and pouring water over them instead 
of putting into a pan of water, pack as closely as possible without 
crushing. This can be done by putting a few berries in the jar, 
pressing them gently into place and proceeding layer by layer, than 
by nearly filling the jar loosely and then trying to press them down. 

Fill jars full of fruit, and cover with cooled syrup. Fit rubber, 
and then the lid, loosely on glass jar and process pints six minutes, 
quarts 12 minutes, counting the time after boiling begins. 

CHERRIES keep their flavor and color with difficulty in tin, 
even in enamel lined cans. For this reason glass is preferable. When 
canned whole they should be blanched to prevent splitting and then 
dropped into a cool syrup to plump. For sour cherries use No. 4 
syrup ; for sweet ones No. 3. Process quart 25 minutes. 

FIGS for canning should be sound and firm. They may be 
treated with the soda bath as for preserving (see p. 36), cooked in 
the syrup from 40 to 60 minutes, then cooled and packed in No. 3 
syrup and processed for 30 minutes in quart jars. 

Before preparing PEACHES make fruit Syrup No. 3 or 4 (see 
table), allowing about one cup water for each quart jar or No. 3 
can. Put in one cracked peach pit for every quart of syrup. Boil 
for five minutes and strain. 

Sort the fruit, using firm, sound, uniform peaches for canning, 
and putting aside the soft broken ones for jam. Peeling may be 
done by placing the peaches in a wire basket or cheese cloth square 
and immersing in boiling water about one minute, until skins slip 
easily. Remove, plunge for a minute into cold water and slip off 
the skins. Cut into halves, remove seeds and immerse in the hot 
syrup. Allow to stand in the syrup until thoroughly cold. Pack at 
once, placing halves in overlapping layers, the concave surface of 
each half being downward and the blossom end facing glass. Fill 
each jar with syrup and paddle carefully to remove air bubbles. 
Process quart 20 minutes and half gallon, 35 minutes. 

Firm, perfect peaches may be lye peeled, but if very ripe the 
fruit is made too soft by this process. Have ready a boiling lye so- 
lution (4 tbsp. concentrated lye to one gal. water). Immerse the 
peaches in it for about 20 to 30 seconds. Lift them out and drop 
into clear boiling water for a like period. Then put through two 
cold water baths and in the second rub off all remaining skin. Keep 
the lye hot and abandon it for a fresh solution as soon as it turns 
dark. 

Select PEARS ripe but not soft. Peel, blanch, put in cold soda 
bath (1 tsp. soda to 1 gal. water), drain and pack rapidly. When 



SCIENTIFIC CANNING 221 



packed whole, leave stems on and place each layer stems up, letting 
the second row fill the spaces between the two stems and repeat. 
Pack pears in No. 3 syrup and process quarts 30 minutes. 

Select sound uniform PLUMS, prick with needle to prevent 
bursting. Pack as firmly as possible without crushing, in No. 4 
syrup and process quarts for 15 minutes. 

Use GRAPES sound but not dead ripe. Weigh and pulp. 
Heat pulp over a slow fire until soft, then run through a colander to 
get rid of seeds. Add 1 cup water to each quart hulls and cook 
slowly until tender. Combine hulls and pulps and add 1 pound sugar 
for each 6 pounds fresh fruit. Boil 5 minutes. Put into sterilized 
jars and process pint jars at simmering 30 minutes. 

It is of the greatest importance that ASPARAGUS for canning 
be fresh and tender. Select tips of uniform size and maturity, and 
wash them. Cut in right length for cans ; scrape off tough outer skin 
and tie in bundles. Blanch by immersing the lower ends part way in 
boiling water for two minutes. Then immerse the entire tips for 
one to two minutes longer. Plunge into cold wa' er, then pack neatly 
having the tips up. Fill jars with brine (4 oz. salt to 1 gal. water) 
and process intermittently, one hour daily for three days. 

The Refugee is a good variety. STRING BEANS should 
be tender and fresh. When the beans within the pod have grown 
to any size canning is more difficult and the product of poorer qual- 
ity from a commercial standpoint. For canning only well sorted, 
small, tender beans should be used. String the beans and cut them 
into two-inch lengths, cutting diagonally or "on the bias" giving a 
pretty product. In glass they may be canned whole, packed log 
cabin fashion in square jars. Blanch three to eight minutes and 
plunge into cold water for an instant. Drain well and pack quickly, 
cover with brine (2-1/2 oz. salt to 1 gal, water), process intermit- 
tently, or if very young, tender beans are used, process for two con- 
secutive hours. 

Lima, or Butter Beans, are treated as string beans, blanching 
2 to 5 minutes. Always process intermittently. Add sugar and salt 
mixture as for corn. 

The best variety of BEET for canning is the Detroit. From a 
standpoint of quality, only young tender beets should be canned. 
Sort, putting uniform sizes together. Boil until three-fourths done, 
peel, pack in layers of three or four, fitting the second layer into the 
spaces left by the first layer and repeat. Cover with clear hot water. 
Process quart jars 1 to 2 hours. Do not allow cold water to touch 
the beets after they have been cooked. 

CARROTS — Proceed the same as for beets, processing one 
hour. 



222 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 



Only the Spanish varieties of SWEET PEPPER, known as pi- 
mentos are suitable for canning. The fruit of these peppers has very 
thick meat, tough skin and is comparatively smooth and free from 
ridges. Peppers should be ripe, sound and free from bruises. Pre- 
pare for peeling by placing peppers in a hot oven for 6 to 8 minutes. 
Peel, cut out stem, remove seeds and pack dry in flattened layers. No 
water is used in the preparation of these peppers; the processing 
brings out a thick liquor which almost covers them in the can. In 
glass a good package is a 10 ounce tumbler-shaped jar with her- 
metic cap. Process this jar 25 minutes and pint jars 30 minutes. 

SOUP MIXTURE. 

Any desired mixture of vegetables may be packed for home use. 
For the standard club product use 1/2 tomato pulp, 1/4 corn, or tiny 
lima beans and 1/4 okra, with seasoning of salt, sugar, pepper and 
slice of onion for each can. Heat the tomatoes, put through a sieve 
to remove seeds and cook down to about the consistency of ketchup. 
Measure, add the corn or beans and okra and seasoning. Cook to- 
gether for 10 minutes, then pack in No. 2 cans or glass jars. Ex- 
haust 5 minutes and process 1 hour continuously or intermittently. 
With tomatoes not red enough add 1 c. pimento to each gallon of 
pulp. This also adds flavor. 

Peel TOMATOES so as to keep as nearly whole as possible. Cut 
out the core with a slender pointed knife without cutting into the 
seed cells. Pack only red ripe, sound tomatoes whole or in large 
pieces. Put 2 teaspoonfuls of the sugar and salt mixture in each 
quart jar. Process quart jars 25 to 30 minutes. 

In glass for home use whole tomatoes may be packed and sur- 
rounded with cooked tomato juice, giving when opened, a sauce 
for soups and whole tomatoes for salads or other use. 



CHAPTER XVI. 

SCHOOL AND BUSINESS LUNCHES. 

Mrs. S. R. Dull. 

This day and time we keep well by proper eating, so every 
home maker, should be informed about food stuffs. It is an old 
subject, but always new, and as long as the world stands will be 
needed. Get away from medicines and learn how to prepare meals 
and lunches which will keep. the family well. Does it pay? Your 
pay is rosy cheeked children, a well and happy family. 

First, it is important to know something about the person for 
whom the lunch is being made, whether he is lean or fat, old or 
young, whether outdoor worker or inside. The man or woman who 
sits all day requires less and a different kind of lunch from the one 
who does not. The strong, fat, romping child would need a differ- 
ent lunch from the thin child who does not romp. The playing of 
children means to them what work does to the grown-ups and grow- 
ing children require a good deal of food to build the body. 

It is necessary for those carrying lunches to co-operate with the 
one who prepares them by eating all kinds of food, and thus keep 
the body well. Some folks pamper their appetites, eating just 
what they like, never getting a balanced meal, and then wonder why 
they have so many ailments. They do not stop to think that it could 
be improper eating. Some of their digestive organs are never exer- 
cised, while others are over-taxed. 

We used to think we should have a balanced meal each time, 
but now many of our good, specialists say if we get it in the three 
meals of the day it is just as well. This last method is easiest for 
the housewife. Consequently, you could fix for some a lunch en- 
tirely of fruit. Have cereals, milk, bread and butter for breakfast, 
and meat, vegetables, salads and desserts for dinner. If you prefer, 
there can be a more general mixture in all meals — the person and 
occasion would determine this. 

For fixing lunches, the first thing needed is the proper tools 
with which to work: a good sharp knife, waxed or white paper, 
rubber bands and the lunch box, which should contain a teaspoon, 
jelly glass with top, or the equivalent, a drinking cup and if soup or 
milk is ever carried, a small thermos bottle. 

Next, the bread is considered — whether you are to make at 
home or buy, what kinds, white, whole wheat, graham or biscuit; 
brown or nut bread, too, occasionally. Since sandwiches are the 
most convenient way of carrying lunches, the bread is an important 
part and the sandwiches we will put in two classes, meat or salad, 



224 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 



and sweet. The first kind is made of meat, eggs, cheese or nuts. 
If the person does not require much meat, a small portion chopped 
and shredded can be spread more evenly. Have your butter soft, so 
it can be readily spread — you cannot spread hard butter and to melt 
it gives an entirely different taste. 

For grown folks and large children, a slice of pickle or mayon- 
naise may be added to the meat ; in this case you can leave out these 
made of salad. Sandwiches of lean meat, eggs, cheese, fish (sar- 
dines) , or nuts is protein food and for building and re-building the 
body. The lunch is apt to have more of this particular food, so the 
lunch maker should see that cereals and all vegetables, particularly 
green or leaf ones, are given in the meals eaten at home. Vegetables 
and cereals give energy and heat and are just as important. 

The sweet sandwiches made of jam, jelly, cottage cheese, rai- 
sins, nuts, fresh and dried fruit, give more heat and energy, as well 
as some minerals and some protein. Fat meat, butter, mayonnaise 
(oil) and nuts give still more and supply the fats for the body. You 
can readily see it is important to vary the lunch. 

The breakfasts in many homes have become rather scant and I 
wonder if it is wise. The school teacher says "NO", that the child 
who does not have a good, substantial breakfast a7id time to eat it 
is the one who becomes restless, tired and cannot study well and 
often is not the bright child. 

From the above list, many lunches may be formed. A few 
additional lunch suggestions follow : 

SCHOOL CHILD'S LUNCH. 
1 meat sandwich. 6 nuts, cracked, picked and 

1 jam or jelly sandwich. wrapped in waxed paper. 

1 apple or orange. 1 slice of cake or cookies. 

2 or 3 pieces of candy or sweet 

chocolate. 

BUSINESS MAN'S LUNCH. 
2 meat sandwiches. 1 jam or sweet sandwich or 

1 cheese sandwich. 1 fruit tart or pie. 

THE BUSINESS WOMAN. 
2 meat sandwiches. 

1 tasty or salad sandwich which contains pickle, celery or 
something pertaining to a salad mixture. Something sweet— stuffed 
dates, candy, slice of cake, sweet sandwiches (sliced pineapple with 
mayonnaise). 

The drink to be carried or bought. 

Mrs. Henrietta Stanley Dull. 
(Mrs. S. R. Dull.) 



CHAPTER XVII. 

FIRELESS COOKERY. 

Mrs. J. B. Rowe. Chairman. 

The average housewife desires efficiency in the home. The 
duty of nourishing the family, which heretofore has required, not 
only thought and work in preparing the meals but much time has 
been minimized by tireless cookery, the principle of which is sim- 
plicity itself. 

In the tireless there is little evaporation. Food retains its 
full weight, flavor and nutriment; does not overcook, burn or 
dry out. It needs no turning, stirring or basting, and may remain 
in the cooker hours after it is cooked, and still be hot and delicious. 

The saving in fuel is about SO^c. The heat used to cook the 
food is stored up in radiators or stones, which may be heated by 
any kind of fuel, and require only a few minutes to heat sufficiently, 
to cook thoroughly any kind of food, that by the old method re- 
quired hours of continuous fire. After the food is placed in the 
cooker, the cooker is sealed and no more thought given it until time 
to serve, eliminating heat from the stove, confusion in the kitchen, 
and constant watching. 

SELECTION OF COOKER. 
Care should be taken in selecting because it lasts a life time and 
the best is found to be the most economical. The following consid- 
erations are essential to obtain the best results. 

SELECT A COOKER 

A. With a steam valve in the lid. 

B. That is lined with seamless aluminum, and is metal outside 
so that it may be thoroughly washed and not contain odors of food, 
from one cooking to the next. 

C. That has a thermometer and table of rules for heating, 
radiators and a book on instructions. 

It is advisable to buy the stand on which to set the cooker thus 
making it a convenient height, and avoiding any chance of rust on 
the bottom of the cooker. 

DIFFERENT WAYS FOOD MAY BE COOKED. 

Foods may be roasted, baked, steamed, stewed, boiled, fried 
and broiled in the tireless. The baked variety includes pies, pas- 
tries, cakes and puddings. Fruit may be canned by the fireless 
method. 

Since the fireless retains cold just as well as heat, delicious tid- 
bits may be frozen in it. Ice cream may be made early in the 
morning in a freezer, and packed in the fireless in the regular 



226 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 

way (taking just the can containing the cream, placing it in 
one compartment of the cooker, and packing around it three parts 
of ice to one of salt) . Seal the cooker and it will stay hard from 
eight to ten hours. 

Foods are prepared in the usual way, using the same recipe 
as for a regular stove, and then placed in cooker. 

The difference in cooking such as baking or boiling is in the 
number of radiators used and difference in degrees of tempera- 
ture. 

A rule will be found in the instruction book governing each. 
The cooking time is about the same as on the regular stove. 

THE THINGS TO KNOW ARE : 

A. Right temperature of radiators. 

B. When to use one or two radiators. 

C. When to use and when not to use covers of utensils. 

D. When to use water with the food and right amount to use. 

E. How to place the radiators close enough to the food to have 
the proper heat contact. 

F. How to clear utensils, steam valve, and radiators. 

Fireless cooking is done by fixed rule, and if the food is pro- 
perly placed in the cooker, the radiators heated to the proper tern- 
perature and placed correctly, the fireless left unopened until 
cooking is complete, it will be impossible to have anything but good 
results. 

The instruction book with each cooker teaches these rules. The 
fireless method is so simple and economical, that every house wife 
should teach her servant to use it. 

Owing to limited space only recipes will be given for each kind 
of food, which differs in treatment in the cooker. Other recipes 
will be found in regular recipe chapters. 

CEREALS. OAT MEAL. 
Time — over night. Place oat meal in double boiler of fireless. 

BOILED RICE. 
« Heat one radiator to 450 degrees, and place rice, cold and raw 
on radiator in cooker for one hour or longer. 

SOUPS. SOUP STOCK. 
4 lbs. soup meat and bone. 2V2 Qts. water. 

1 onion. 1 carrot. 

1 tbls. salt. Vi t-spoon pepper. 

1 stalk celery. 1/2 bay leaf. 

1 turnip. 

Bring the entire mixture to a boiling point and allow to simmer 
ten minutes. Place in cooker for eight hours or over night. Re- 
move and skim fat from top before using. Use one radiator. 



FIRELESS COOKERY 227 

TOMATO SOUP. 
Boil 5 minutes and place in cooker for 2 hours. Use 1 radiator. 

GREEN OR SNAP BEANS (Southern Style). 
String beans, leaving whole; place three strips of bacon or 
salt pork in bottom of pail, then beans on top. Remove to cooker 
three to four hours, using one hot radiator, 450 to 500 degrees. 

BAKED MACARONI WITH CHEESE. 
1 hour in fireless, between 2 radiators — heated 450 degrees. 

MEATS— ROAST BEEF. 

The best shaped roast to prepare for cooking by fireless is a 
rolled roast from five to eight pounds. Prepare in the usual way 
for oven. Then put roast in the largest vessel and raise tempera- 
ture of the two radiators to highest possible point; then place the 
vessel in the large compartment and allow it to remain twenty 
minutes for each pound, or fifteen minutes per pound if desired 
rare. 

Never use water when roasting beef. The fireless process 
is the most satisfactory method of all for cooking meat; enough 
juice from the meat is developed during the cooking to make the 
best gravy ever served. During the cooker method this juice acts 
as a self baster. 

ROAST LAMB. 

Select a small leg of lamb and cut off the shank, and season 
well in the usual way. Place in the largest vessel and use both 
Prepare gravy in usual style. Use two radiators heated 500 de- 
radiators. Allow thirty minutes or more for each pound of meat, 
grees. 

VEAL LOAF. 
Three hours. Use two radiators. Heat 475 degrees. 

ROAST CHICKEN. 
The time necessary for roasting a chicken depends on the age 
of the bird. II/2 hours is sufficiently long for a young chicken 
but an older one should be roasted two hours, and a very tough 
chicken three hours. Old chickens will turn out as tender and 
savory as spring chickens. Prepare chicken by usual method for 
oven. It will not be necessary to heat the chicken to brown before 
it has been placed in the fireless. If both radiators are made hot 
the chicken when roasted will turn out very nice and brown. The 
chicken therefore can be placed cold in the vessel and placed at once 
in the cooker for roasting. It is not necessary to open the cooker 
for basting as the hot steam prevents burning. Heat 500 degrees. 

ESCALLOPED POTATOES. 
Peel and slice one quart raw potatoes, place in kettle one 
layer of potatoes and small pieces of butter, salt and pepper, and 



228 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 



slice one small onion until required quantity is prepared. Pour 
one pint of scalding milk over this, sprinkle with bread crumbs and 
place in the fireless. Use two radiators heated 450 degrees and 
bake 21/2 hours. 

APPLE PIE. 

Place in the fireless, using two radiators heated 450 degrees 
for about 40 minutes. Any fruit pies can be baked like this. 

PUMPKIN PIE. 

Line pan with pie pastry — using 1 crust only. 
2 eggs well beaten. 2 cups milk. 

% cup sugar. IVo cups pumpkin. 

Salt to taste, season with nutmeg, cinnamon and a little ginger. 
Add a little melted butter. Bake in the fireless 30 minutes. Use 
two radiators heated 450 degrees. When cold cover with whipped 
cream, seasoned to taste with vanilla and sugar. 




CHAPTER XVIIL 



DISCOVERIES. 

Mrs. Frank J. Graham, Chairman. 

The old saying "'Tis the little things in life that count" has in- 
spired us to give you this chapter of little things that have counted 
in the lives of others. It is our sincere wish that "Discoveries" may 
prove of use to the possessors of the Atlanta Woman's Club Cook 
Book. 

REFRIGERATORS — To keep refrigerators pure, wash out 
twice a week with sal-soda and cold water. 

Mrs. R. M. Striplin. 

MERINGUE — If meringue or any egg mixture is cooked in 
oven too hot, it invariably falls. Cook in moderate oven or leave 
oven door open. 

Mrs. W. B. Price-Smith. 

FISH — will scale much easier if dipped into boiling water. 

Mrs. Porter King. 

IODINE — may be removed from any fabric by soaking the 
article in lime water. 

Mrs. Alonzo Richardson. 

SILVER — To clean easily, put pieces into a large pan of 
boiling water, into which you have put a small amount of Ivory 
soap flakes. When tarnish has disappeared, rinse in hot water and 
dry thoroughly. 

Mrs. M. H. Stevens. 

SHERBET— In making fruit sherbet, add a pinch of salt. 
Sherbet will have more body and taste better. 

Ida Crossett. 



230 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 



GILT FRAMES — When gilt frames are new, go over with a 
coat of colorless varnish. All specks can then be washed off with 
water without injuring. 

Mrs. W. F. Melton. 

CLEANING FLUID FOR BLANKETS. 
2 bars ivory soap (grated). 1 gal water. 

6 tbls. powdered borax. 

Mix above ingredients thoroughly, place on fire and dissolve. 
When cold add 6 or 8 tbls. household ammonia. Make this mixture 
the day before planning to use. This forms a white jelly which, 
when used in the proportion of a cup of mixture to several gallons of 
water, cleanses perfectly. 

TO SET COLORS. 
1 tbls. alcohol. 1/2 gal. water. 

1 tbls. turpentine. 1/2 cup salt. 

Soak goods over night to retain color. Fold cloth carefully and 
place in tub, pouring over the above mixture. The next morning 
take out, but do not wring. Stretch on line and pin with clothes 
pins. Cloth thus treated needs pressing. If goods should be shrunk, 
heat the mixture before pouring over. 

Mrs. Hugh Willet. 

PUNCH — When making punch, put large silver spoon in bot- 
tom of bowl, add ice. In this way there is no danger of breaking 
bowl. Put silver teaspoon in jelly glass. You can fill slowly with 
no danger of breaking glass. 

Mrs. J. A. Carlisle. 

CURDLING — In serving acid fruits, put a large piece of ice 
in dish with fruit; then pour cream over all. The cream will not 
curdle. 

Mrs. Lee Hagan. 

MINT — Fresh mint and parsley placed in air-tight fruit jars 
will keep in good condition for a number of days. 

Mrs. Beaumont Davison. 

RECIPE HOLDER — Paste an envelope in your cook book for 
new recipes. 

Miss Cobble Vaughn. 

TO LOOSEN FRUIT SKINS— To quickly peel ripe tomatoes— 
and peaches, immerse for a moment in boiling water, which will 
loosen the skin. 

Mrs. Chas, Evans. 

TO BEAT EGGS— In beating eggs separately add pinch of salt 
to whites. They beat more quickly in this way. Then add a little 
of the beaten whites to the yolks as the yolks beat up nicer. 



DISCOVERIES 231 



TO PRESERVE EGGS— use one part Silicate of Soda, (liquid 
glass) to ten parts of water which has been boiled and cooled. Put 
fresh, clean eggs in an earthen or glass vessel and cover with a 
weight to keep them submerged in liquid. Wash off before using. 

These will keep indefinitely and are good for all cooking pur- 
poses, with the exception of boiling and poaching. 

Do not wash eggs first, as it removes the natural coating. 

Mrs. C. E. Cresse. 

CORN and batter breads should be made with fresh buttermilk. 
Biscuits are better when made with buttermilk a little acid. 

TO SWEETEN MILK— Add a little sweet milk to buttermilk 
which has become sour. It will be quite fresh again. Taste it and 
use own judgment in regard to amount to add. 

SCORCH — In boiling, if contents become scorched, immediately 
remove vessel from fire and set in pan of cold water. In a few min- 
utes the scorched taste will have disappeared. Put food in another 
vessel, discarding the scorched part, reheat and serve. 

Mrs. J. A. Carlisle. 

INSECTS IN VEGETABLES— Before using vegetables that 
form heads such as lettuce, cabbage, cauliflower, wash thoroughly, 
cover with cold water; adding a little vinegar. Let stand for 30 
minutes or longer. Any insects hidden within will immediately 
crawl out. Also, your vegetables become crisp and fresh from 
being in the cold w^ater. 

Mrs. W. F. Wimberly. 

TO SEAL JELLY — Put paraffine in jelly glasses and pour in 
your hot jelly. When cold, the jelly will be covered and sealed 
without any trouble. 

TO OPEN A COCOANUT— bore hole in eye and empty milk. 
Put in hot oven and the heat will crack the shell, so that meat can 
be removed easily. 

RELISH — Chopped onion and parsley added to any dumplings 
greatly improves their taste. 

POTATOES — Parboil potatoes before putting in soup. 

Mrs. G. B. Denman. 

INK STAINS — Salt on fresh ink stains will help to remove 
them. 

TO WHIP CREAM— When whipping cream, add the white of 
one egg to each cupful of cream. It will be firmer and double in 
quantity. Whip egg and cream separately, put together and then 
whip a little more. 

Mrs. R. M. Striphn. 



232 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 



SUGAR SAVING — To save sugar in cooking acid fruits, add 
a pinch of soda when cooking. If this is done, it will be necessary 
to use about one-half as much sugar. 

PIN FEATHERS— To pick out the pin feathers of a fowl, use 
a small pair of tweezers. 

CUT GLASS — When washing cut glass, add a little borax to 
the suds and rinse in water with a few drops of bluing. 

Mrs. J. B. Rowe. 

INSECTS — The best remedy for ants is cayenne pepper spread 
on shelves. Moths will avoid clothes sprinkled with turpentine. 

Mrs. Newton C. Wing. 

POTATOES — May be baked more quickly by putting them in 
boiling water, for a few minutes, before putting them into the oven. 

Mrs. George S. Obear, Jr. 

DRY SALT — A little corn starch in the salt cellar will keep 
the salt dry. 

Mrs. Clarence Bemis. 

USE A HAIRPIN— To keep the outlets of bowls, bath tubs or 
laundry tubs clean, use a buttonhook, or wire hairpin straightened 
out, and then hooked at the end. 

WATER CURE — If onions are peeled under cold water, it 
does away with the odor and does not cause the eyes to smart. 

ICING — To prevent icing from running, lightly dust cake 
with corn starch. 

SCORCH STAINS — may be removed immediately with dry 
starch and then sponging off. Repeat if necessary. 

TAR — Every Mother of small children will be glad to know 
that tar may be removed from clothing by rubbing with kerosene 
or turpentine. 

NO STARCH — Do not put cotton articles that contain starch 
away for the winter, as the starch will cause them to rot. 

SHELVES — Varnishing or enameling shelves or the inside of 
drawers, looks better, and they can be kept cleaner, than by use of 
paper. 

Mrs. Newton C. Wing. 

DUST — Left over tea leaves kept moist in a cup and sprinkled 
on a floor to be swept, will prevent any dust. 

IRON RUST — To remove iron rust from white material, wet 
the goods with lemon juice, rub on salt and put in sunshine. 

Mrs. J. L. Minson. 



DISCOVERIES 233 



GRAVY Keep a pot of beef extract on hand to use for soup 

on quick notice, or for gravy. If for soup, cook vegetables in clear 
water, strain and add one or more teaspoonsful of the extract. 

BROOMS — Always buy a new broom before the old one is 
worn out,' so that the old one may be used for rough work. 

Mrs. Charles E. Myers. 

DUST— Use a paint brush to remove dust from the cracks 

and carving on furniture. 

Mrs. E. G. Foreacre. 

ODORS — After peeling onions rub salt or a raw potato on 
hands and you will find that the onion odor will disappear. 

CURDLED MAYONNAISE— When mayonnaise curdles the 
quickest way to bring it back is to take a teaspoonful of cold water, 
mix in a generous pinch of corn starch stir smooth and beat slowly 
into the curdled mayonnaise. 

Mrs. Roger Winter. 

WHEN FRYING— Add a little salt to the fat, when frying 
croquets or doughnuts and it will not spatter on the stove. 

GASOLINE — The ring sometimes left in clothes, when cleaned 
with gasoline, may be removed by steaming over a teakettle. 

MEALY POTATOES— Baked potatoes will cook mealy if the 
ends are nipped off before putting in the oven. 

Mrs. John Carlson. 

SCORCHING— A pan of salt in the oven, under the baking, 
will prevent scorching. 

GELATINE — When unmolding a gelatine dessert, first pour 
cold water over the dish on which you wish to unmold it, shaking 
off as much as possible. If the mold fails to fall into the proper 
place, it is an easy matter to slide it into position. 

Mrs. W. Frank Daub. 

IRONING BOARDS— may be protected from dust by taking 
long paper bags of desired width, cutting bottom from bags, and 
pasting together to required length. Slip over board when not in 
use. 

Lucy Parker. 

COLORING — To color successfully and daintily chiffon, veiling 
artificial flowers, feathers, wings, straw hat braid, etc., take a small 
amount of tube oil paint, which artists use, thin with gasoline, ac- 
cording to whether you wish to darken the shade with more paint, 
or lighten with more gasoline. If the worker is careful, the color 
will be even and permanent. Select a bright, windy day for the 
work ; do the dipping by an open door, and see that each part dries 



234 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 



at the same time. Be careful to leave no undissolved particles of 
paint in the gasoline ; this is easy and satisfactory, giving pastel 
shades that can be acquired in few other w^ays. 

Mrs. D. F. Stevenson. 

MERINGUE — A pinch of baking powder added to meringue 
will keep same from falling. 

A way to test meringue : when brown touch lightly with fin- 
gers and if no imprint is left same is done. 

Mrs. J. M. Manry. 

REFRIGERATOR DRIPPINGS— are splendid for watering 
box plants, being rich in ammonia. Let stand in sun and warm up 
before using. 

Mrs. Frank L. Stanton.

CHAPTER XIX. 



HOME GARDENS. 

Mrs. H. G. Hastings, Chairman. 

Landscape gardening has been in practice since 3000 B. C. as 
shown in records on an Egyptian tomb. The best of the earlier 
gardens were those of the Romans, which combined the ideas of the 
Egyptians, Persians and Greeks. 

In England the idea of gardening has been developed to a large 
degree. The Elizabethen gardens became more decorative and had 
more relation to the architecture of the house. 

One of Queen Elizabeth's chief policies was frugality and her 
reign was marked by increased resources. At that time the vege- 
table gardens were separated from the formal gardens and were 
screened from the more public views of the place. 

Landscape architects are especially trained men for laying 
out of grounds and when possible should be consulted, but, where 
the places are not large enough to warrant this, much pleasure in 
planning and carrying out one's ideas is found. 

It is necessary to have a complete plan, regardless of whether 
the work is all done at once or year by year. One owner planted, 
the first year, his trees, his foundation planting in front, and 
shrubbery to screen objectionable features ; the second year, all cor- 
ner plantings ; the third season, foundation planting completed and 
evergreens added; the fourth season, herbaceous perennials and 
architectural features completed the plans. In informal planting, 
the general mass of the borders follows the lot lines, paralleling 
them on the outside edge, with curved lines of planting on the inside 
edge. Where accents are needed to emphasize division of lot into 
various areas, the border line swells in width, and a corresponding 
height in plants is called for. The planting should follow the gen- 
eral outline of the house, so it would seem that the out-door living 
rooms are a part of the house itself, introducing variation in form, 



HOME GARDENS 237 



height and color. The front lawn area should be kept open up to the 
house. 

Foundation planting around the house must harmonize in coloi 
with house and grounds, accenting corners, openings and views 
with shrubs of varying height. Vines are used to relieve expanse 
of house walls, furnish privacy for porches, arbors and pergolas. 
They are helpful in covering banks and unsightly effects. Ever- 
greens are especially rich for planting about the house — mixed with 
deciduous plants whose flowers, twigs or fruits make a pleasing 
contrast with lower values of the evergreens — and produces a 
cheerful effect the year around. 

Roses of garden type, including Tea Roses, Hybrid Teas and 
Hybrid Perpetuals, should be restricted to gardens. The Rugosa 
Rose is available for border planting. 

Flowers may be planted in borders to serve as*the fore ground 
or "facers" to shrubs along paths or massed in beds of formal de- 
sign, if they are kept well back from the centers of open spaces. 
Bulbous plants, such as Narcissus or Daffodils, are effectively 
planted in colonies similar to those formed by wild flowers planted 
by nature. They can be left to themselves as the tops soon disappear 
and the lawn is not injured. 

Annuals are best confined to garden beds or borders and are 
valuable for cut flowers and continuous bloom. 

The best guarantee for success is : choosing plants of known 
hardiness : nursery grown plants with well developed masses of fi- 
brous roots from a dependable nurseryman ; planting with an under- 
standing of the requirements of the plants and shrubs for healthy 
growth, such as their needs of watering, cultivation, mulching or 
fertilizing. Flower seed planting should follow packet or seed cat- 
alog directions. 

WHAT AND WHEN TO PLANT FOR TABLE USE. 

While many high-sounding adjectives are used in a few seed 
catalogs, responsible seedsmen illustrate by actual photographic re- 
productions. Descriptions and cultural directions are dependable 
and it is well for every person who plants a garden, flower bed or 
window box to have and follow closely the catalog of thoroughly re- 
liable seedsmen. 

General planting tables are fine and being quickly decipher- 
able are quite handy to keep as a reference and reminder. For such 
a purpose in this short space is given a list of vegetables that do wel/ 
and are in common use in the latitude of Atlanta. For cultural di- 
rections, follow the simple directions printed on the packets or pack- 
ages of seeds you buy or that you will find in the seed catalogue. 
The making of garden and flower beds is a simple matter and will 
repay us greatly for all the time we may spend on their care. Let 
us grow our own vegetables and flowers. The fresh home grown 
vegetables are much more delicious than any we can buy at the 
stores and the flowers make a real home of even the simplest cottage.

CHAPTER XX. 



RECIPES FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS. 

The following recipes are of such an unusual nature it 
seems best not to classify them in any particular chapter. Other 
casserole dishes have been placed in chapters, where they seemed to 
belong, being classified according to their chief ingredient. Many 
of the following will be found useful for children's parties. 

The Editors. 



ITALIAN SPAGHETTI. 

(Original Recipe.) 
Each item of the following should be multiplied by the num- 
ber of persons partaking. 
1/2 lb- medium-caliber Spaghet- V4. of a "bloom" of garlic. 

ti. 1/^ tin tomato-paste (Italian 

1/4 lb. butter. brand). 

1 medium-sized onion. 14 Parmisan or Roman cheese. 

Mince onions and fry in butter till brown. Then add in follow- 
ing rotation at 2 minutes intervals: (1) tomato paste properly di- 
luted in little water, (2) garlic finely minced, (3) 1 large spoon 
grated cheese per person, saving balance for serving time. During 
above proceeding, start cooking spaghetti in boiling water. Time 
for cooking runs usually as long as time for frying of sauce. Strain 
spaghetti very carefully and mix it with sauce. Serve hot. Sprin- 
kle individual helpings with remaining cheese.

Cook beef in boiling water slowly S-V^ hrs. or until tender. Re- 
move meat, put cabbage, turnips, and carrots into liquor, and boil 
1/4 hr. Add potatoes and cook 1/2 hr. longer. Cook beets separately. 
Serve beef on large platter surrounded by vegetables. Use pickled 
beets if preferred. 

Mrs. Katherine Cummings. 
I " Tewksbury, Mass. 

HUNGARIAN GOULASH. 

1/2 dozen onions. 1 red pepper. 

1 pound round steak. 1 green pepper, 

2 cups raw potatoes (diced). 3 tomatoes.

DOLLY CAKES IN CAPS. 
Bake any reliable cake mixture in round patty or muffin pans, 
and cover the tops with white icing. With a fine, new, paint brush 
dipped in melted chocolate, indicate eyes, nose and mouth. Much 
variety can be secured by slanting the eyes, turning the corners of 
the mouths up or down, etc. Cut circles of white tissue paper 
larger than the cakes, pink the edges, and run a white ribbon or 
thread around each, one inch from the edge. Set the cakes each in a 
cap, and tie the ribbon. Grownup children will enjoy these as much 
as the little ones.

CHAPTER XXI. 

OUR ADVERTISING FAMILY. 

By Mrs. Newton C. Wing 
Chairman Home Economics Dept. 

After a careful investigation of the following firms, the Home 
Economics Department of the Atlanta Woman's Club takes great 
pleasure in inviting them to be advertisers in the Cookbook. One 
firm only of its kind has been selected with the purpose in mind 
always, of having the advertiser one in whom our readers could 
have entire confidence, and in this way avoid time spent in making 
investigations themselves. We regard this as one of the most 
important features of this work, and hope sincerely that our read- 
ers will show their appreciation of our efforts by liberally patroniz- 
ing these firms. Be sure to read their advertisements which fol- 
low this Advertising Chapter, 



THE CALORIC FURNACE CO. belongs most properly in the 

Cookbook, even if it has nothing to do with food, for common sense 
tells us that we must first be warm and comfortable, else how can 
we enjoy eating? The Home Economics Department welcomes it 
gladly therefore both because it makes home cozier, and because 
it is so economical. 

THE FRIGIDAIRE— Just think, a refrigerator never damp! 
Never to have to watch out for the Ice-man's coming, to see that 
tickets or change are ready, or that we have been given correct 
weight — and then finally, perhaps to clean up after muddy feet. 
All these things are unnecessary with the Frigidaire. For several 
months we studied this delightful electrical contrivance at close 
range, the Frigidaire Company being kind enough to install it in 
our model kitchen at the Club House for that purpose, and we rec- 
ommend it most heartily. 

ROYAL BAKING POWDER— The Cookbook editors feel that 
a commendation of Royal needs must be superfluous, so long has 
it been the standard of excellence. Confirming this belief, the only 
baking powder mentioned in our recipe^ is the Royal. A new 
feature introduced by this firm is their selection of a consulting 
household specialist, who will be glad to answer all questions con- 
cerning household problems addressed to the Educational Depart- 
ment, Royal Baking Powder Company. 



246 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 



OPTICIANS, A. K. HAWKES & CO. We would really not 
need to say anything more about A. K. Hawkes & Co. than to re- 
mind our readers that this sterling Atlanta firm has been in busi- 
ness over fifty years in our city. That fact certainly speaks for 
itself, but we can't resist the opportunity to tell you also that it's 
a reliable place to get one's eyes tested and fitted ; that they have 
the latest thing in cameras and photographic methods, and that we 
fell in love with an oven thermometer we saw there, which every 
one who reads our chapters on baking will want to purchase. 

JESSUP & ANTRIM— ICE CREAM MANUFACTURERS.— 
This firm has been a member of our Woman's Club "family" for 
some time, having supplied delicious ice-cream for practically all 
the big aflfairs held at the club house and also at the Children's 
Play Room, established by our Home Economic Department down- 
town, to care for children while the mothers shop. We have found 
this firm to be thoroughly dependable in the things that count — 
their cream is uniformly good, their deliveries are always on time, 
and they are kindness itself in filling rush or emergency orders. 

THE WHITE PROVISION COMPANY— The story which our 
beloved Henry W. Grady told of the poor "one gallus" fellow from 
Georgia who, when it came time to die, found that the South fur- 
nished him nothing but the hole in the ground in which to be 
buried — that everything else for the funeral had to be imported 
from the North seems a far cry from the prosperous times of pres- 
ent Southland. The time is here, when Georgia cannot only furnish 
us the necessary elements of a funeral, but what is more important 
— can provide the necessities of life. 

A pioneer who has helped to bring about this happy change is 
Mr. W. H. White, Jr., President of the White Provision Company. 
By stimulating the livestock industry in Georgia, by building a mod- 
ern packing house in Atlanta, establishing the home of the famous 
CORNFIELD BRAND HAMS AND BACON, he has earned the 
admiration and gratitude, not only of all true Georgians, but of 
good Americans everywhere, for he is helping to develop his own 
part of the country, without harming any other part which surely 
is the duty of all citizens. 

McCRARY — PHOTOGRAPHER — This Department takes 
great pleasure in recommending the McCrary Studios, for artistic 
portraits, and for sensible prices. Even during the period of the 
late war, these prices did not take upward trend, with which we 
became so unpleasantly familiar, in so many cases of necessities 
and luxuries. We find in the McCrary Studios pleasant atmosphere, 
of genial welcome and artistic accomplishment. 



OUR ADVERTISING FAMILY 247 



THE HOWARD THEATRE— Built with the artistry inspired 
by years of foreign travel on the part of Mr. Troup Howard, this 
wonder-place satisfies the artistic longing of the most cultured, and 
raises the standard of others who have grown accustomed perhaps 
to consider the tawdry finery purchased by money alone — the cri- 
terion. Even without its wonderful moving pictures, it would be 
soul-satisfying to rest in the luxurious seats breathing in the har- 
mony of color and music. After a year of its charm, it still holds 
us spell-bound, and thankful that such things can be. 

WISE DRUG COMPANY. After leaving the Howard, we 
find it the most natural thing in the world to turn to the left into 
the beautiful home of the Wise Drug Co. and get one of their de- 
licious orange drinks. Aside from the hospitality dispensed at 
the soda-fountain, we are assured of all the necessities to be found 
in a good drug store. When added to this is a satisfaction pro- 
duced by the elegance and simplicity which marks this in common 
with the Howard Theatre, we find — it easy to form a Wise habit. 

THE DAFFODIL TEA ROOM AND RESTAURANT— Con- 
tinuing down Pryor street, about a block from the Howard, we 
find one of the coziest places to eat. Accomplishing the usually 
impossible feat of providing delicious individual cooking on a large 
scale, the Daffodil has become the rendezvous for all who like an 
atmosphere of home. Here every day, friends meet friends, and 
one has the feeling of hospitality offered in a delightful personal 
manner by the owner, Mrs. J. E. McRee, and her assistants. 

JOY'S FLOWER SHOP— There may be a flower shop with a 
prettier name but we doubt it, for to all women joy and flowers 
are synonymous. Our acquaintance with this florist, where the 
Woman's Club Hospital Committee purchase its many floral gifts, 
and which numbers among its clientele many other club members, 
assures this firm of our hearty co-operation. 

M. MILLER'S PECANS— Pronounced "pecawns", "pecons" or 
"pecans" according to the section in which you live, does not af- 
fect the thinness of the shell the delicate flavor, nor the food value 
of the delicious pecans grown by J. R. and J. B. Miller, Pecan Nur- 
serymen of Baconton, Ga. We strongly recommend readers of 
this book to order direct from Baconton — "the Home of the Pecan" 
and then use them in our cake and salad recipes, 

ATLANTA NATIONAL BANK— The modern housewife or 
professional woman whether she "budgets" or uses a salary eco- 
nomically, finds an indispensable adjunct to be a good bank. After 
several years' acquaintance with the Atlanta National, we recom- 
mend it as a place where women will receive special consideration 
and the fact that it is especially near the shopping district, adds 
to the convenience.

BLOCK BISCUIT AND CRACKER COMPANY is an Atlanta 
firm acquiring- national prominence owing to the excellence of its 
wares. This firm has given an elaborate demonstration of its 
products at a general meeting of our Home Economics Department, 
and we endorse it most heartily. A visitor to its large factories is 
immediately impressed by the hygienic conditions under wKich 
these dainty cakes and crackers are made. 

L. W. ROGERS GROCERY CO. enjoys the friendship and ap- 
pi*eciation of Atlanta housewives to the fullest extent. This firm 
made it possible, during the difficult war period, for a great many 
of us to furnish our tables with the necessaries of life at a price 
which was not prohibitive. Continuing this policy during peace 
times, makes the "Rogers Habit" part of the daily life of ninety per 
cent of Atlanta housewives. 

KING HARDWARE— Seems to have everything that anbody 
could wish to equip a home, both inside and outside. Through 
this store, our Department purchased many hundred dollars worth 
of equipment to furnish our model club kitchen, and we are prom- 
ised by the management that the articles mentioned in our chaptf'r 
on KITCHEN EQUIPMENT will be on hand, when the Cookbook 
readers ask for them. 

SOUTHERN DECORATING CO. A trip through this store 
makes one want to give a party every day in the year, for such 
fascinating things as are to be seen ! Dainty favors for tea par- 
ties, funny favors for children's parties (old or young), and ma- 
terials to decorate the walls of immense halls, or large areas — for 
auto parades, or at any time when the spirit moves us to "dress 
up". Entertainers at the many social functions of the Woman's 
Club and elsewhere, will find a delightful variety of table decora- 
tions. 

GEORGIA RAILWAY & POWER COMPANY.— Doesn't that 
seem like a big subject to handle in one little paragraph? Visions 
of elemental powers harnessed and brought into subjection are 
more understandable, however, when we think of them in terms 
of cooking, baking, and in the evening, the cheery reading lamp. 
Furnished in such abundance, and with no eflfort on our part we 
are apt to take such luxuries as a matter of course, without paus- 
ing to think of the arduous labor that makes them possible. Let 
us give thought, now and then, to the time and effort which have 
made these comforts ours, and let us do our part, in conservation 
and co-operation. Our readers will find our chapter on gas economy 
very useful in this connection.

ATLANTA MILLING COMPANY. — Two very important 
events will happen simultaneously in Atlanta — the production of 
this Cookbook and the introduction of a brand new pastry flour 
called 'Tride of Atlanta". We are glad to recommend its use in 
our cake recipes ; and as Irwin Cobb says, "Say it with flours". A 
long time has been spent in making ready for the market this 
pastry flour, inspired by the desire to call only the very best — 
"PRIDE OF ATLANTA". As all good cooks know a fine pastry 
flour is absolutely necessary for the making of fine pastries, so 
we are glad to be among the first to sponsor this brand. 

JEWEL FURNITURE POLISH— The invention of an Atlanta 
woman, this polish abundantly proves the theory that home prod- 
ucts may be as good or sometimes better than those for which we 
go far afield. This polish has been thoroughly tested by the Depart- 
ment, and we heartily recommend it. 

In presenting it to our readers of the fair sex, we wish to add 
this word of caution — "Be sure that Hubby has one for his own 
use, or you will find that he has borrowed it to polish his car, as 
it is equally effective for that." 

BINDERS GIFT SHOP AND PICTURE FRAMERY is just 
the place to get those new pictures for which you have been longing, 
as a splendid assortment may be found there, and at unusually rea- 
sonable prices. Almost everybody has prints on hand to be framed. 
Why not take them into Binders on Pryor Street, just below the 
Daffodil, and get them framed, and while there, look at the attrac- 
tive things in the gift shop. 

SOUTHERN COTTON OIL CO.— We feel honored to welcome 
into our Home Economics family the advertisement for Wessons Oil 
and Snowdrift. The development of these products serves to ex- 
emplify the wonderful progress in Southern industry, which has 
been made in the last few decades. We can imagine no home com- 
plete without both these necessary adjuncts, and recommend them 
for all of our recipes calling for shortening, frying, or any cooking. 

AMERICAN BAKERIES CORPORATION— Merita Bread is 
fast making friends on its merits, for its really home made bread, 
and priced so reasonably, too. Its just the thing to put in the school 
lunch, and when everything's ready, what could be more convenient 
than to wrap the whole lunch in the sanitary oiled paper which has 
served to keep the bread so sweet and moist. 

JOHNSON-DALLIS COMPANY.— The very surest proof 
that this firm is very popular with this Department, lies in the fact 
that, after a search of months for a firm that suited exactly the 



250 ATLANTA WOMAN'S CLUB COOK BOOK 



very high requirements for the production of this Cookbook, we at 
last selected Johnson-Dallis Co., and we are sure that; you will agree 
with us after reading our book and seeing the high quality of work- 
manship. 

BUICK MOTOR CO.— For the person who wants a car of 
which its owner will never need be apologetic — which will take its 
place among the most expensive cars, yet be within reach of those 
in only comfortable circumstances ; which is luxurious to ride in, 
yet economical in the amount of gasoline needed ; easy for a woman 
to drive, yet tough enough to stand long, hard trips — we recommend 
the Buick, They say that when a better car is made, they will make 
it and we believe them, for we have tested them ourselves, covering 
a period of ten years, 

ELLA SMITH DOLL CO.— In selecting our Cookbook adver- 
tisers, we were not thinking particularly of singling out women- 
Is it a coincidence, or a sign of the times, that three of our new 
"family" are inventors and originators of things unique? This 
ALABAMA INDESTRUCTIBLE DOLL was born in a womans 
love for her own children. Made first for them, the demand spread 
like wildfire, until now it seems as if the whole world wants this 
darling doll, that can withstand the punishment, to which, unwit- 
tingly, its little mothers and daddies submit it. 




Children Will Wake Up Early 

You know how they hop out of bed before the house is warm and play 
around while dressing! Colds and sickness are too often the result. 

At best, grates and stoves keep only part of the house fairly warm. 
Then there is the ever present danger of your children being burned in 
your absence — a fate that overtakes many little ones every winter. 

With a Caloric circulating warm, pure air to every nook and corner, 
your children may get up as early as they please and play around to their 
hearts' content. Then they run through a warm hall to the dining room 
and eat their breakfast in comfort. 

Over ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND families 
— three hundred of them in Atlanta — testify to the comfort, convenience, 
economy, healthfulness and genuine all round goodness of the

Founded in 1870, our store has for 

over fifty years been identified with the 
gro\vth of Atlanta, and we feel justified 
in the belief that it has wielded a strong 
influence in the affairs of the comnnunity. 

Our effort to add to the comfort

them the best optical service, careful and 
pains-taking effort, long experience and 
modern science afford, has its reward in 
the great number of people who are our

"Hawhes Glasses," and whose children, 
when they need glasses, come to our store. 

And just as Atlanta has improved 

year by year, so, too, have we striven to

for increasing our usefulness and to con- 
tinue to merit your fullest confidence.

How to Cut Down Your Gas Bill 

T HAS BEEN demonstrated that more than 
11% of the gas fuel supply is wasted. A 
large portion of this waste is directly due to 
improper methods in the use of gas equipment. 

Waste can be reduced to the vanishing point, 
service can be vastly improved, and gas bills can be 
diminished by a proper observance of a few rules 
governing the use of this fuel. 




All gas range burners should 
burn with a clear, blue flame. 
If they do not, the consumer 
should call up the gas company 
(Ivy 4400). 

Do not light the top burners 
until the food is ready to put 



When the water in the vessel 
has come to the boiling point, 
reduce the flame by turning the 
gas valve handle. 

Never let the flame lap up 
around the vessel. Turn down 
the valve. 

When the burner is not in 
use, turn it out. It is very easy 
to light again. We recommend 
the use of some handy lighter, 
such as the round file Safety 
Lighter, which is always ready 
for use. 

Try oven cooking, that is, 
cooking the whole meal in the 
oven at one time. It is the eco- 
nomical way of cooking. 



If Your Gas Bill Seems 
High 

Note on your bill the 
dates covered by the meter 
readings; take the average 
cost per day, and it will as- 
tonish you how nearly the 
same this average cost will 
be each month. The differ- 
ence in your gas bills usu- 
ally covers a few days' dif- 
ference between the meter 
readings — or different con- 
ditions of consumption — 
there is no difference in the 
price of gas. 



In case of any trouble with your gas, telephone Ivy 
4400 and ask for the Gas Service Department.

JEWEL POLISH 

Cleans as it Polishes 

JEWEL FURNITURE, FLOOR and AUTOMOBILE POLISH is 
different from ordinary polishes. It restores the surface to its orig- 
inal brilliancy, brings out the grain of the wood, leaves a perfectly 
dry surface, and goes twice as far as other polishes. 

It is more than a polish, removing ink, grease, grime or dirt on 
which other polish has no effect. Absolutely harmless, and without 
an equal for cleaning ivory furniture and white wood-work. 



Look for this Trade-IUark.
