Chops all kinds of Meat, raw or cooked, 
and all kinds of Fruits, Vegetables, Crackers, 
Bread, Cheese, Nuts, etc., into clean-cut, 
uniform pieces — fine or coarse as wanted — 
without mashinf^, squeezing", tearing or 
rinding and with great rapidity. 



ii 



They do away with the chopping knife 
and bowl entirely, doing the work in one- 
tenth of the time and producing an abso- 
lutely uniform product. 

They are labor-saving, time-saving, and 
food-saving machines and are an invaluable 
help in the kitchen. They are not compli- 
cated and no special directions for using are 
needed ; there are few parts so that they can- 
not get out of order — they are easy to 
take apart, easy to put together, easy to 
adjust, easy to use, can be cleaned quickly 
and with less trouble than a chopping bowl.

No. 1— Soup Btoc!!. 

The material for the stock is usually at hand in the shape of 
a few bits of brown fat, the gristle and stringy pieces left from 
the carefully trimmed pieces of meat, and in the bones from 
which the meat has been taken. Bones and gristh^ of them- 
selves do not add vahie to the soup stock, but the nx-at juice 
formerly cooked into these and which a process of slow cook- 
ing releases, is what is sought for. These give a flavor which 
may be heightened and modified to suit the taste by the addi- 
tion of a few bits of raw meat that may be at hand (the 
trimmings from chops, the flank ends of steak, etc.) and 
certain vegetables and herbs, either uncooked or sauted in hot 
fat. Tlie ])roportions are : Water to cover the ingredients 
and a tablespoonful of coarse chopped vegetables of several 
kinds to a (|uart of Wqxud ; seeds, as celery, a piece of bay leaf, 
a red pepper pod, horseradish root and nnishroon pearings are 
added at discretion. After sinunering two hoius or more the 
liquid is drained off, and wlien time allows, cooled and freed 
from fat, when it is ready for use.
