PREFACE 

The Little Dinners of Paris are world- 
famous. No one can have sojourned 
in the fascinating capital in its normal 
days without having come under their 
spell. To Parisien and visitor alike 
they are accounted among the uniquely 
characteristic features of the city's 
routine life. 

Much of the interest that attaches to 
them is, of course, due to local atmos- 
phere, to the associations that surround 
the quaint restaurants, half hidden in 
unexpected nooks and by-ways, to the 
fact that old Jacques "waits" in his 
shirtsleeves or that Grosse Marie serves 
you with a smile as expansive as her 
own proportions, or that it is Justin or 
Frangois or "Old Monsoor," with his 
eternal grouch, who glides about the 
zinc counter. 

But there is also magic in the arrange- 
ment of the menus, in the combinations 



vi PREFACE 

of food, in the very names of the con- 
fections and in the little Gallic touches 
that, simple though they are, transform 
commonplace dishes into gastronomic 
delights. 

There is inspiration in the art that 
enters into the production of a French 
dinner, in the perfect balance of every 
item from hors d'oeuvre to cafe noir, 
in the ways with seasoning that work 
miracles with left-overs and preserve 
the daily routine of three meals a day 
from the deadly monotony of the 
American regime, in the garnishings 
that glorify the most insignificant con- 
coctions into objects of appetising 
beauty and in the sauces that elevate 
indifferent dishes into the realm of 
creations and enable a French cook to 
turn out a dinner fit for capricious 
young gods from what an American 
cook wastes in preparing one. 

The very economy of the French is 
an art, and there is art in their economy. 
It is true that their dishes, as we have 
known them in this country, are expen- 



PREFACE vii 

sive, even extravagant, but that is be- 
cause they have been for the most part 
the creations of high-priced chefs. They 
who have made eating an avocation 
know that it is not necessary to dine 
expensively in order to dine well.

THE BUGBEAR OF AMERICAN 
COOKERY MONOTONY 

It is as strange as it is true that with 
the supplies that have lately proved 
sufficient to feed a world to draw upon 
the chief trouble with American cookery 
is its monotony. The American cook 
has a wider variety of foods at his com- 
mand than any other in the world, yet 
in the average home how rarely is it 
that the palate is surprised with a flavor 
that didn't have its turn on the cor- 
responding day last week or tickled 
with a sauce that is in itself an inspira- 
tion and a delight, not a mere "gravy," 
liable to harden into lumps of grease 
when it cools. 

Most of this is simply the result of 
blindly following tradition. Daughter 
has accepted mother's precepts, regard- 
ing them even as the law of the Medes 
and the Persians, "which altereth not," 



2 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

and if it were not that increased prices 
and, lately, at least, "food regulations," 
have veritably compelled her toward a 
more wholesome simplicity, the United 
States would probably be what it was 
called half a generation ago, "a nation 
of dyspeptics." And we were a nation 
of dyspeptics because the great Ameri- 
can mother of the latter end of the 
Nineteenth Century, in spite of all her 
unequaled qualities in every other 
direction, and in spite of all the enco- 
miums she received in resounding prose 
or ecstatic verse for her prowess in the 
kitchen, was from the points of view of 
health, economy and wisdom the worst 
cook in the world. 

With prices as they are the American 
housewife cannot afford to use butter 
and eggs and flour with the prodigality 
that was a habit with her mother, but so 
limited is the average woman's knowl- 
edge of cookery that these restrictions 
merely mean more monotony than ever. 
It is partly to demonstrate that this 
state of things is unnecessary and that 



TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 3 

true food economy is not at all syn- 
onymous with "going without" that 
this book has been compiled. 

It is upon variety that the French 
cook confidently relies to make each dish 
of each meal not just something to eat 
because her family must have food, not 
merely a sop to the Cerberus-gnawings 
of hunger, but a delight to the eye, to 
the palate, to the stomach truly a 
consummation devoutly to be wished 
for the American home table, and just 
as possible to attain as it is possible to 
procure from the grocer or the nearest 
pharmacist the ingredients by which 
these wonders are wrought. 

But the average American woman 
doesn't look beyond her own kitchen 
and her own traditional row of spice 
boxes for her flavorings. She has her 
"kitchen set," which ordinarily com- 
prises a row of little receptacles labeled 
"pepper," "salt," "cloves," "allspice," 
"ginger," "cinnamon," "nutmeg," and 
possibly one or two other spices or con- 
diments rarely more. With these and 



4 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

a bottle each of lemon extract and 
vanilla, she is satisfied that she is fully 
equipped as far as flavoring possibili- 
ties are concerned. 

If she has laid in a box of sage and one 
of mixed dressing with, perhaps, some 
paprika and thyme, she views her fore- 
sigh tedness with much complacency. 
She is supplied with savories. 

Then she goes right on sighing, "Oh, 
for a new meat, instead of the same old 
round of mutton, pork, beef and fish; 
fish, beef, mutton and pork," disclaim- 
ing utterly any responsibility for the 
monotony that is undermining the 
family health and temper and, quite 
possibly, its morals. 

That is where the American house- 
wife makes her primary and most im- 
portant mistake. The French, on the 
other hand, know that there are, liter- 
ally, hundreds of ways to vary every 
dish, however ordinary it may be in its 
primary state. That is their secret of 
success: unfailing variety coupled with 
economy. 



TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 5 

However, this is not to claim that the 
American palate would take kindly to 
all the French cooks' little delicacies, 
or that it could be cultivated to that 
degree that makes a Frenchman regard 
a perfectly balanced meal even as an 
inspired poem. 

Probably Americans, as a class, could 
never be induced to eat some of the 
little birds the mauviettes, the alouettes, 
the sparrows baked in a pie, that so 
delight the Frenchman. Also, it is a 
question whether snails, even if it were 
possible to obtain the superior Bur- 
gundian, fat and juicy and cooked even 
as our own Oscar used to prepare them 
for certain Waldorf guests, would ever 
appeal to the American taste, as even 
the common hedgerow sort of snail 
does to the average Frenchman. 

It is not that the French dinners of 
Monte Carlo are necessarily so superior 
to American shore dinners, or that the 
little dinners of Paris are so infinitely 
to be preferred to those, say, of certain 
places in New Orleans, or that the 



6 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

coppery-tasting oysters of Havre are 
to be compared with those of our own 
Baltimore. There is no more to be 
said, probably, for the woodcock pate's 
of old Montreuil, or the rillettes of Tours, 
or the little pots of custard one gets at 
the foreign Montpelier, or the vol-au- 
vent, which is the pride and boast of 
the cities of Provence, than there is for 
grandmother's cookies such as have 
put Camden, Maine, on the map, or 
Lady Baltimore cakes, or the chicken 
pies one goes to northern New Hamp- 
shire to find in their glory, or the tur- 
keys that, as much as the Green Moun- 
tains, make Vermont's fame. 

Still, there is no question but that 
the American palate would benefit much 
by being cultivated, not only in the 
interests of economy, but also with a 
view to the increase of gastronomic 
pleasure, for a taste attuned to many 
variations is as an ear sensitive to the 
nuances of sweet sounds or an eye 
trained to perceive delicate tones and 
tints. It is really a matter for regret 



TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 7 

that we, as a people, have not been as 
willing to learn from the French the 
art of cooking and eating as we have 
been to acquire from them knowledge 
of the art of dress. Until we widen our 
horizon sufficiently to do this, we have 
not even begun to develop all our food 
resources or to understand the first 
principles of true food economy which 
is not at all synonymous with "going 
without." 



FLAVOR, HANDMAID OF VARIETY 

It is because he has a multitude of 
seasonings at his command and knows 
how to use them that the French cook 
is enabled not only to send to the table 
an infinite variety of dishes, but, at 
the same time, to practice economies 
that were otherwise impossible. The 
American buys an expensive cut of 
meat and, as is right in such a case, 
treats it as plainly and simply as possi- 
ble. The Frenchman buys meat of a 
much lower quality, but so embellishes 
it that when it comes to the table it is 
superior, or, at least, equal to that which 
costs much more. 

It may be objected that this is no 
real economy, because by the time the 
French cook has sauced and spiced his 
cheap cut in order to make it palatable, 
the cost is as great, if not greater than 
it would have been had he paid more 
9 



10 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

for his meat in the first place. This 
would be true enough according to the 
average American's method of proced- 
ure. But it is to be remembered that 
the French cook has already in his 
kitchen the cooking vinegars, the spices, 
the dried herbs, the extracts, that in 
very small amounts a dash or a few 
leaves are used at a time; also, that 
in a great number of cases, gravies and 
sauces are made from the by-products 
of the main dishes those by-products 
that in the American kitchen usually 
go down the sink-drain or into the gar- 
bage pail. 

Take a peep into the typical French 
cupboard. There you will find from 
twenty-five to thirty liquid seasonings 
such as anchovy extract, tobasco sauce, 
meat extracts, mushroom catsup, to- 
mato paste, chutney, various vinegars, 
Worchestershire and many another flav- 
oring designed to give a tang and a 
eest even to the most unpromising dish, 
if used aright. There you will find, 
too, fifty or more dry seasonings, includ- 



TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 11 

ing anise, basil, saffron, savoury, clove 
or garlic, cassia buds, bay leaf, ginger 
root, pepper-corns, marjoram, mint, 
thyme, capers and so on. 

Herein lie the "secrets" of French 
cookery which are, in truth, not secrets 
at all, but merely the application of 
common sense to the cuisine. The 
French have never allowed their taste 
to be restricted by prejudice, so they 
hail a new flavor with delight rather 
than registering an instinctive dislike 
because it is not familiar. With a 
little applied education, Americans can 
bring the charm of the French table 
to their own homes rather than when 
they are, as they say, tired of the 
same old round of "eats," seeking out 
a nondescript table d'hote restaurant 
and eagerly consuming what is set 
before them, grateful for a change. 

But don't harden your heart against 
French cookery merely because you 
have sampled it, as you fondly think, 
at one or another of the "red-inkeries" 
of New York or any other city. For 



12 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS ^ 

the most part the "French" restaurants 
of the land are in reality not French 
at all, but Italian for the most part, 
and whatever Gallic flavor the remain- 
der ever possessed has well-nigh : van- 
ished. There may be exceptions but, 
if there are, their patrons carefully 
guard the secret. 

But to return to our subject: It is 
the French cook's knowledge of the 
subtleties, the nuances of seasoning 
that stands him in good stead. The 
American woman who has essayed to 
use some spice or savory unfamiliar to 
her and has turned out a dish which her 
family has declared "tasted like medi- 
cine" is, naturally enough, discouraged 
from wandering after that particular 
strange god again. The truth is that 
she has overdone the seasoning. She 
doesn't want to be parsimonious, which 
is just what the French cook is with 
his flavors, only he, more scientifically, 
calls it using good judgment. If he 
uses garlic in a salad, it doesn't neces- 
sarily follow that the entire household 



TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 13 

must take on the atmosphere of an 
Italian barber shop, for he uses garlic 
or onion, not to give their flavor to a 
dish, but to bring out the flavors of the 
vegetables with which they are used. 

Vanilla and lemon have an almost 
universal appeal to the palate, and 
knowing this, the American cook, like 
the generation before her, has always 
seasoned her rice puddings, for instance, 
with one or the other, just as her apple 
sauce has invariably been flavored with 
lemon or nutmeg, her bread pudding 
with vanilla, and so all along her re- 
stricted line. 

The French cook holds no brief 
against vanilla, and sometimes he flavors 
his rice pudding with it, but he so 
guides matters that the very sight or 
mention of rice pudding does not bring 
the thought of vanilla to the mind, for 
with him it may be flavored with 
pistache or rose or have a. geranium leaf 
baked in it, giving a delightful, in- 
describable flavor. An ordinary bread 
pudding becomes veritably a queen of 



14 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

puddings as, indeed, it is called, merely 
by having a layer of jam through its 
center and a simple icing spread over 
the top. Ordinary pea soup exhib- 
its chameleon-like possibilities merely 
through the addition of a little celery- 
root, a dash of curry or the admixture 
of a few spoonfuls of minced spinach, 
and tomato soup has for most an appeal 
that even this favorite of soups never 
had before when just the right amount 
of thyme is added while it simmers, 
along with, perhaps a bayleaf . 

In the recipes appended to the little 
dinners in this book a great many of the 
French cooks' materials ar- 1 methods 
of procedure are set forth. But if the 
ordinarily experimental American house- 
wife has the flavorings on hand, she 
will doubtless herself contrive many an 
alluring dish of her own. Variety is 
said to be the spice of life. However 
that may be, the spices and their 
friends, the herbs, certainly make for 
variety in that important function of 
life, the dinner table. 



TRUE TRAILS TOWARD ECONOMY 

In the first place, no trail toward 
economy in conducting the cuisine of a 
household lies through the delicatessen 
store or the "fancy" grocery. It is an 
unflattering comment on the spirit of 
thrift of American housewives that the 
delicatessen store has settled down to 
such a flourishing existence, particu- 
larly in Eastern cities. Any woman 
who possesses a stove and a kitchen 
of her own should be ashamed to admit 
the laziness that more than a semi- 
occasional visit to these "delicate eat- 
ing" places predicates. There are few 
things to be had in them that she 
shouldn't be able to make better at 
home and at a cost that is but a fraction 
of what she has to pay for the usually 
inferior, impersonal messes that come 
ready-made. 

If the housewife has read some of the 
very excellent instructions that were 

15 



16 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

printed to help her conduct her house- 
hold adequately amid the necessary 
limitations of wartime, she already 
knows that there is absolutely no ex- 
cuse for ever throwing away a crust or 
crumb of bread. As for that, neither is 
there any excuse for ever disposing of 
what is left of the morn ng cereal except 
to the advantage of some later made 
dish, or of consigning meat scraps or 
bits of fat or even bones to the garbage 
pail. It is not only that, in the interests 
of economy, she should use them; it 
is rather that if she is a good cook she 
will be very glad to have them to use. 

Stale bread and breadcrumbs are 
the bases of a score of the most delicious 
puddings on the French cook's card; 
cooked cereal is one of the best thicken- 
ings for soups and gravies, as well as 
being far more wholesome than flour for 
this purpose; meat scraps, trimmings 
and bones should go into the stock pot. 
When a soup made of these is served 
as the introductory course at dinner 
it will be found that the family will be 



TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 17 

fully satisfied with much less meat, and 
it is in the lessening dependence of 
Americans on meat that will make for 
the greatest item in economy. 

A French cook of parts would tear 
his hair if he could see how fats and 
drippings from meats are thrown away 
in many an American kitchen. They 
are poured into the sink till the drain 
pipes clog and, to complete the little 
serial of extravagance, the plumber has 
to be called. The French cook knows 
that this is the finest grease for frying in 
the world and that its use would save 
many a pound of butter. He strains 
it all carefully and keeps the different 
sorts in labelled jars or crocks. He 
knows by experience what particular 
fats give the best flavors to certain 
things, and he knows that vegetables, 
fish, eggs, pancakes and what not are 
far better fried in these natural fats. 
Who that ever ate an egg fried in bacon 
drippings will ever want one cooked in 
butter, even at a dollar a pound! 

One will not find the delicatessen 



18 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

flourishing in France one will not 
find it at all and the fancy grocery, 
above mentioned, is another pitfall for 
the American housewife. She likes the 
sight of food done up in fancy contain- 
ers, in glass, perhaps, and buys them, 
not realizing that she is paying a large 
price for perfectly unnecessary and 
totally unnourishing "pretties." If she 
is fearful of the handling some loose 
food stuffs may be subjected to in the 
stores, why does she not practice the 
most practical economy, go to the 
fountain-head of supplies in the city, 
the large market, and buy in quantity, 
so far as she can? A few ounces of 
bacon, already sliced, and sealed in a 
glass dish are, indeed, appetising even 
in their raw state, while a side of bacon 
is not, unless looked upon through the 
eyes of imagination, yet the latter 
method of purchasing this commodity 
is two or three hundred per cent cheaper, 
and when it arrives at the breakfast 
table it will be found every bit as ap- 
pealing to a happy morning appetite. 



TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 19 

Any consideration of economy in the 
cuisine must include the meat problem. 
Meat is the most expensive item on the 
menu and the true solution of the ques- 
tion is not only to conserve all the uses 
of it but to eat much less. That would 
make not only for economy, but for 
better health as well. 

It has been estimated that 186 pounds 
of dressed meat is or was prior to the 
war the yearly average of consump- 
tion for every American; the English- 
man being a good second with his 120 
pounds, while the Frenchman remained 
perfectly contented and healthy with 
79 pounds, the Italian with 72 pounds, 
and the Swiss, anything but a nation of 
invalids, managed very well on 60 
pounds per person. 

This is no plea for vegetarianism, 
though it may be said in passing for the 
benefit of those who think that good red 
blood and hardy muscle are to be ob- 
tained only by absorbing the red blood 
and muscle of the beasts of the field, 
that there is as much, if not more, of 



20 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

this building power in the beans, the 
peas, the lentils that we regard too often 
as mere secondary foods. 

Most of all the American should take 
advantage of the great stores of fish 
which are equally as nourishing as meat 
and may easily be made as appetising 
with simple sauces that French cookery 
will teach us. Fish are cheap; at least, 
many neglected kinds are; they are easy 
to cook and they are one of the best 
foods in the world. 



THE APPEAL TO THE EYE 

No one, least of all the French cook, 
calculates to feast the eye at the expense 
of the sense of taste, yet it is his 
experience after long years that good 
digestion is much more likely to wait 
upon the appetite that has been stirred 
to a preliminary enthusiasm by the 
attractive appearance of a dish. So 
they serve little fritters of vegetables, 
dabs of jelly, slices of hard boiled eggs, 
pickles, parsley, cress and nasturtiums 
with meats, put sprigs of fresh green 
in their gravies, decorate desserts with 
nut-meats, flowers and fruits, and in so 
doing add a bit to the gayety of the 
table, satisfied that the trifling extra 
expense, time and energy incurred is 
more than compensated for in the 
pleasure the results afford. A fair trial 
of this pleasant idiosyncrasy of the 
French is convincing that the appear- 

21 



22 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

ance of a dish has more bearing on the 
relish of a meal than we over here have 
fully realized. 

They are particular, however, to be 
consistent in the use of garnishings. 
Flowers and fruits are reserved for 
sweet dishes, except in the case of nas- 
turtiums, which they regard as much a 
vegetable as a flower and use freely with 
meats. 

A stew or a creamed dish is merely a 
more or less indifferent something to eat 
when it is dished up any old way and 
set upon the table. But if it is heaped 
daintily on a pretty platter, surrounded 
by a ring of brown mashed potato, its 
sides decorated by dainty shapes of 
toasted bread, perhaps buttered and 
sprinkled with minced parsley, it has 
become something to awaken the slum- 
bering or indifferent appetite and at 
practically no extra expense of time or 
money. 

If the yolks of two hard boiled eggs 
are minced and mixed with part of the 
raw white of one, the paste then formed 



TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 23 

into balls like marbles and dropped 
into boiling water, one has little yellow 
spheres to lend an enlivening color note 
to clear soups. Two or three of these 
dropped into each plate just before 
serving makes a pleasing change from 
the usual croutons. 

Sprigs of fresh chickory make the 
daintiest of garnishes for cold meats, 
and a few of the tender green stalks 
will add to the appearance of practically 
any salad. As for water-cress and 
pepper-grass and, of course, parsley, 
minced and otherwise, no French chef 
would think of preparing a meal without 
a plentiful supply of them on hand. 

It isn't essential that every dish 
should be turned into an elaborate 
work of art, as if it were to be entered 
at the annual exhibition of the Societe 
des Chefs de Cuisine, but neither is 
there any reason, even with modest 
means at command, for giving cause for 
that old slogan of the great American 
dinner table: "It tastes better than it 
looks." 



SAUCES, SIMPLE AND OTHERWISE 

Brillat-Savarin, who would be remem- 
bered as a wit had he not been even 
more brilliant as a chef, paid his respects 
to the English by saying they were a 
nation of a hundred religions and only 
one sauce. Being a true Frenchman he 
believed a reversal of the numbers 
better for the soul. It is certainly 
better for the appetite. 

To be sure the proper mental sauce 
for a good dinner is wit, and the best 
physical one, hunger, but as we all of 
us have more or less of an Epicurean 
strain in us and do not eat solely to 
satisfy bodily needs, it is well that the 
American cook who essays to bring 
variety to her board should have some 
knowledge of those Gallic creations, the 
sauces, by which she is enabled to trans- 
form plain dishes into seemingly pre- 
25 



26 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

tentious ones, even though she never 
attain that sauce that Balzac knew, 
"in which a mother might unsuspect- 
ingly eat her own child." 

In the first place every French chef 
keeps three kinds of what he calls roux 
on hand, ready for making meat and 
fish sauces. These are made by cooking 
together eight ounces of butter and 
nine ounces of flour. That intended for 
use with brown meats is stirred together 
till it becomes a medium brown in shade; 
white roux is cooked only sufficiently 
to banish the raw taste and not allowed 
to color, while pale roux is kept over the 
fire just long enough to attain a deep 
cream color. These are mixed with 
milk, soup stock, water or gravy as 
the case may be when a sauce for fish, 
meat or vegetables is needed. 

For instance, to make Sauce a la 
Creme, for use with white entries, take 
two tablespoonfuls of the white roux 
in a saucepan with a cup of milk and a 
tablespoonful each of finely chopped 
parsley, shallots and chives. Boil fif- 



TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 27 

teen minutes, pass through a colander 
into another saucepan, add a small 
lump of butter, more finely chopped 
parsley and salt and pepper. Mix well 
with a wooden spoon and it is ready for 
the table. 

To make a favorite Sauce Piquante, 
cut two onions into slices, also a carrot 
and two shallots and put into a sauce- 
pan with a scant tablespoonful of but- 
ter. While heating over a moderate 
fire, add a sprig of thyme, a tablespoon- 
ful of minced parsley, a bayleaf and two 
or three cloves. When the onions are 
golden brown add a tablespoonful of 
flour, a little plain stock and a table- 
spoonful of vinegar. Boil again, pass 
through a sieve and season with salt 
and pepper. 

A simple sauce is that Maitre <T Hotel, 
which is rarely made at home though so 
generally liked. Put a lump of butter 
into a small saucepan over a moderate 
fire and add to it chopped parsely and 
chives, or parsley alone. Season with 
salt and pepper and a little lemon juice 



28 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

and while it is sizzling pour over the 
hot steak or fish. 

Sauce d'Anchois, than which there 
isn't anything better with baked fish, 
is also easy to make. Take three or 
four anchovies and mash them up well 
with two tablespoonfuls of butter. Now 
make about a pint of brown sauce with 
brown roux and milk, and stir the 
anchovy butter into it. Just before 
taking from the fire add the juice of 
half a lemon or more, according to taste. 

Sauce Bearnaise was a favorite of 
Henry of Navarre, and it is excellent 
with steaks, chops and, particularly, 
roast beef. To make it beat the yolks 
of three or four eggs in a saucepan, add 
a tablespoonful of butter and a little 
salt. Stir over a slow fire till the eggs 
begin to thicken, then remove and stir 
in two more tablespoonfuls of butter, 
stirring till the butter is dissolved. 
Season with chopped fine herbs and 
parsley and pour in a teaspoonful of 
French vinegar. 

In many parts of France they have 



TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 29 

a favorite dressing for boiled fish called 
Sauce Ravigote. To make it mix half a 
pint of stock in a saucepan with a small 
amount of white wine or cider, then 
chop fine herbs such as chervil, tarra- 
gon, chives and parsley, or whatever 
other herbs are in season, to the amount 
of about three tablespoonfuls, and mix 
with the stock, adding salt and pepper. 
Stew gently for about twenty minutes, 
then blend a tablespoonful each of 
flour and butter, stir into the sauce and 
continue to stir till thick. Just before 
serving squeeze in the juice of half a 
lemon. 

The word "Ravigote" means, literally, 
"pick me up," and it is applied to 
minced tarragon, chervil, chives and 
parsley, the herbs being kept separate 
and served with salad on four little 
saucers. Ravigote butter, made by 
kneading butter with the four herbs 
and adding pepper, salt and lemon 
juice, spread between thin slices of 
bread, makes delicious sandwiches. 

To make the very generally liked

Sauce Blanquette, which is used to raise 
cold meats to the dignity of a fricassee, 
take about four ounces of pale roux, 
thin slightly with boiling water added 
by degrees, then put in a bunch of sweet 
herbs, cooked button mushrooms and 
small onions and pepper and salt to 
taste. Put in whatever cold meat you 
have, cook till it is well heated and 
serve. 

The following is called Sauce d'Havre, 
and through the use of it it will be 
discovered that the taste of curry is an 
agreeable one in many another case 
than in connection with the veal and 
rice arrangement to which most Ameri- 
can cooks restrict it. Peel and slice 
four onions and two apples and place 
in a stewpan with four ounces of butter, 
six peppercorns, a sprig of thyme, two 
bayleaves and a blade of mace. When 
the onions have become slightly brown 
over the moderate fire, stir in a mixture 
of two tablespoonfuls of flour and the 
same amount of curry powder, shortly 
afterward adding six gills of white stock 



TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 31 

and half a pint of white sauce. Season 
with salt and half a teaspoonful of moist 
sugar, boil for a quarter of an hour, 
adding more white stock if necessary, 
and stirring constantly. Put through 
a strainer into another saucepan, boil 
up again, skim, and use when required. 
Fricasseed chicken takes on a new 
glory when it is prepared with Sauce 
Lyons. This is made by stirring grad- 
ually three well-beaten eggs into half a 
pint of plain white sauce, then placing 
the mixture in a jar and standing in 
boiling water till the sauce thickens. 
Just prior to pouring over the chicken 
add the strained juice of half a lemon.

LET US EAT FISH 

A FAMOUS FRENCH LUNCHEON 
A L'AMERICAINE 

Only in the Latin countries has fish 
as an edible ever been fully appreciated 
and, as is the case with most other things 
gastronomic, it is in France that the 
food possibilities of the denizens of the 
water have been brought nearest per- 
fection. 

Over here we have always seemed to 
regard fish as useful chiefly for stocking 
aquariums or for furnishing sport for 
the vacationist, along with golf, tennis 
and bowling. True, we have become 
rather well acquainted with certain 
sea foods, the oysters, Blue Points and 
Cape Cods ; we have a nodding acquaint- 
ance with some of the clam clan, espe- 
cially the Rhode Island branch, and the 
Little Necks, the blue bloods of the 
family, And, of course, we are familiar 

109 



110 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

with the crustaceans, the lobsters and 
the crabs. 

And we know, too, certain succulent 
sea delicacies that come to us from Palm 
Beach shores and California and Oregon 
regions, tuna and halibut, bluefish and 
salmon as it comes to us variously pre- 
pared for the table. In short, we Ameri- 
cans are fairly friendly with a number 
of the aristocrats of the water, but on 
analyzing the situation we come to 
realize that as for knowing the "finny 
tribe" as a whole well enough to get 
complete gastronomic joy out of the 
situation, it remains that it is only the 
French people who are so blessed. 

Time and the hour and the high price 
of meat, however, render it advisable, 
even absolutely necessary, that we work 
all our resources instead of only a part 
of them, to economize whenever and 
wherever we can, and the waters in our 
midst and around us are surely one of 
the most important resources not already 
worked to the limit. 

Therefore, let us eat fish but first 



TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 111 

let us learn of the French about fish, 
even as we have learned of them con- 
cerning other foods, or as we have 
learned fashions, for, verily, the turning 
out of a proper fish dish for the table 
has ever been regarded by the French 
as no less an art than the creation of a 
beautiful frock in one of their ateliers. 
Moreover, their ways with fish are so 
broadly inclusive that one may make 
up an entire menu from one end to the 
other, with only a cup of coffee needed 
as a final fillip to make a perfect meal 
and all of fish. 

By way of furnishing inspiration to 
our own appetites, herewith is a sug- 
gestion for a fish luncheon, a favorite 
menu of France, which its wealth and 
fashion delighted to have set before it 
in those good old days before the war. 
Substitutes are given for any fish not 
indigenous to American waters; other- 
wise it is just as it would be served at one 
of the Riviera restaurants, with the 
exception, of course, that on the 
Riviera or at any of the noted marine 



112 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

restaurants, the visitor himself was per- 
mitted to select the fish for each course 
from among the different specimens 
swimming in the reserves, altogether 
unconscious of impending fate. 

No French restauranteur worthy the 
name ever kept dead fish in stock, for 
nothing deteriorates so quickly. There 
is rarely over here the natural reserve 
that the Riviera takes as a matter of 
course, although there is, in some res- 
taurants, the tank of running water in 
which the fish are kept in condition till 
required. 



AN ALL FISH LUNCHEON 

MENU 

Hors d'CEuvres. Little Necks or Blue Points. 

(At Monte Carlo one would be served Clovisses.) 

Lobster with Sauce Piquante. 

(A substitute for the French langouste, which is 
similar to a giant lobster minus the two long 
nippers. Or there might be served abroad for 
this course a little gelatinous fellow called supion, 
or sea-hedgehog, or perhaps nonnots, smaller and 
more delicate than our own whitefish.) 

French Sardines Grilled, or Shad Planked. 

(Shad is a most satisfactory substitute for the 
French restauranteur's delight loup de mer.) 

Flounder, Sauce Meuniere, or Shrimps. 

(In Dieppe sole and certain crevettes are both 
specialties and are served at this juncture, but 
little sole is being received here and our own 
flounder answers requirements admirably . Shrimps, 
too, will please an American palate fully as well as 
the crevettes. 

Bouillabaisse. 

(This, for which we have no nearer synonym than 
fish stew, which is a libel, is the piece de resistance 
of the luncheon. It is probably the most famous 
fish dish of France.) 

Salade de Poisson with Aioli. 

(Aioli is a Mediterranean mayonnaise and "the 
dressing," the French say, "is the soul of the 
salad." 

113 



114 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

It will be noted that there is no 
dessert given with the above menu, 
but the repast may be gracefully topped 
off with crackers and cheese and cafe 
noir. Tea is never served with fish, as 
the tannin is said to render fish par- 
ticularly indigestible. 



TO PREPARE THE LUNCHEON 

The French disdain the pepper, horse- 
radish and tomato mixtures with which 
we are wont to dress raw oysters, pre- 
ferring to get the full coppery taste 
peculiar to their home product, but the 
American oyster, even these artists of 
the culinary department agree, re- 
quires a dressing to bring out the flavor. 
As for the clovisse, which is, by the way, 
first cousin to our clam, it is eaten from 
the shell, each clovisse being opened 
immediately before being disposed of. 

Lobster as here served to take the 
place of the French langouste, tastes 
much like deviled lobster. The sauce 
piquante is made as follows: Into a 
saucepan put a tablespoonful of finely 
chopped onion with a little salt, grated 
nutmeg, black pepper and an ounce of 
butter. When this melts and blends 
add a little chopped red pepper along 

115 



116 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

with three tablespoonfuls of vinegar 
and a teaspoonful of mustard. Stir 
together well, then mix in half an ounce 
of flour and half a pint of fish stock. 
Simmer for half an hour, skimming 
occasionally and, finally add a chopped 
pickled gherkin. 

Sauce Meuniere, served with the sole, 
or, in this case with the flounder, is 
made by adding a few shrimps and mus- 
sels, minced, to a pint of white wine in a 
saucepan, along with a cupful of minced 
mushrooms, a teaspoonful of butter, 
salt and pepper and three or four cloves. 
Simmer for twenty minutes and pour 
over the fish just before serving. 

Salade de Poisson, Aioli, is made by tak- 
ing any cold fish, say salmon, with this 
menu. It is flaked and marinaded in 
oil and vinegar seasoned well with pep- 
per and salt. Allow to remain for an 
hour or so, then remove and arrange 
compactly in a salad bowl. The aioli, 
the Mediterranean delicacy with which 
it is served, is made by whipping two 
eggs, four teaspoonfuls of olive oil, a 



TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 117 

half teaspoonful of French mustard 
and a half cupful of cream together 
till stiff, in a bowl rubbed with garlic. 
Heap this on the center of the fish. 

As for the Bouillabaisse, it is like our 
own Welsh Rabbit in so far as hardly 
any two persons make it alike. Here 
are two recipes which gastronomic au- 
thorities have accorded the meed of 
highest praise: 

No. l. : Cut into pieces and remove 
the bones from three pounds of fish; 
say one pound each of cod, halibut and 
bluefish, though any fish of like nature 
will do. To these add the cooked meat 
of one lobster or two crabs, and six 
shrimps and put all into a casserole in 
half a pint or more of olive oil to cook, 
adding one lemon, sliced, two tomatoes, 
one onion, one sliced carrot, a bunch of 
saffron, a bunch of parsley, a bayleaf 
and a clove of garlic or have the 
casserole rubbed with the garlic. Cook 
for ten minutes, stirring frequently, 
then add one cup of soup stock and a 
glass of wine or cider. Cook for fifteen 



118 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

minutes longer, remove to a hot bowl, 
line the casserole with slices of toast, 
and pour back the bouillabaisse. Serve 
at once. 

No. 2. Place the pieces of fish to 
any desired amount in a large saucepan, 
add two or three sliced onions, one or 
two sliced carrots, three shallots, two 
cloves of garlic, a bunch of thyme and 
parsley, three or four cloves, two bay- 
leaves, half a teaspoonful of capsicum, 
a wine-glass of olive oil and salt and 
pepper to taste. Pour over the above 
mixture two quarts of water and boil 
gently for half an hour, the pan covered. 
Drain and lay on a hot dish. Then mix 
a teaspoonful of saffron in the liquid, 
pass through a strainer into a soup 
tureen. Serve the soup with the fish 
and a plate of croutons of fried bread or 
sippets of toast. 



FISH A LA MARSEILLES 

The French have another fish dish 
which, like bouillabaisse, is practically 
a meal in itself and which in these 
days should be better known to the 
American table. It is a specialty in the 
vicinity of Marseilles and made there, 
of course, with fish peculiar to the home 
waters, but M. Auguste Gay, Chef of 
the Yale Club, New York, who, inci- 
dentally, has probably given more atten- 
tion to the adaptation of French cook- 
ery to American requirements than any 
other chef, is authority for the state- 
ment that the following recipe produces 
an almost perfect substitute for the 
French dish: 

Chop into fine bits a small sweet 
Chile pepper and toss it about in a 
saucepan over the fire with a third of a 
cupful of olive oil or butter. When hot 
add a cupful of okra and the same 

119 



120 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

amount of stewed fresh or canned toma- 
toes. Cook fifteen minutes and add a 
full cupful of cooked fresh fish cod, 
haddock, etc., and a half cupful of 
flaked salt fish, mackerel, for instance. 
Cover and cook for twenty minutes 
longer and serve with water crackers. 



GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 

One secret of the French cook's 
superiority to the American in preparing 
fish is that the former has almost a con- 
genital knowledge of his subject. To 
him all fish is not just fish. He dif- 
ferentiates sharply as to species, tem- 
pering his treatment to varied require- 
ments. 

Roughly, there are two classes of fish: 
those which have dark flesh or flesh 
with a pinkish tone which is streaked 
with fat, and those which have white, 
firm flesh and are the more digestible. 
Best known in the first class are shad, 
butterfish, bluefish, salmon, mackerel 
and sturgeon, and in the second, cod, 
halibut, flounder, trout, rock and sea 
bass, pompano, weakfish and perch. 

One matter-of-course rule is that no 
fish of whatever kind shall be allowed 
to enter the kitchen unless it is per- 

1121 



122 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

fectly fresh. To be sure of this see that 
the gills are bright and shining and the 
flesh firm, not readily separating from 
the bones. That settled, you have an 
almost endless choice of ways of cook- 
ing. 

Fish may be boiled, broiled, fried, 
baked, planked, creamed, steamed, 
cooked en casserole, jellied or pickled, 
but of all these ways none produces 
quite the universally satisfactory re- 
sults with a sizable fish that planking 
does, and planking is not more difficult 
or expensive than other methods. 

All that is required in the way of 
accoutrements is a half -inch-thick hard- 
wood board which is heated in advance 
in the oven when planked fish is to 
figure on the menu. Then having thor- 
oughly cleaned the fish, removed its 
head and tail, split it up the back half 
through the bone so that it will open out 
flat, brush it with butter and season 
with pepper and salt, place it skin-side 
down on the board. 

Put it in the oven and when it is 



TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 123 

done, which can be easily ascertained 
by lifting a bit of the flesh, you, being 
American, may garnish the board with 
mashed and seasoned potatoes, set the 
board back in the oven till the potatoes 
are browned and serve. The French, on 
taking the cooked fish from the oven, 
merely brush it with a little oil or melted 
butter, squeeze some lemon juice over, 
sprinkle a few bits of parsley about, 
and send the fish thus to the table. 

Small fish, such as perch, smelts, etc., 
are best fried in deep fat or its substi- 
tute, first being dipped in egg and rolled 
in fine cracker or breadcrumbs, then 
served with a Sauce Mousseline, mashed 
potatoes or boiled new ones, and a crisp 
salad. 

This Sauce Mousseline is made by 
beating two eggs in a saucepan, adding 
a cupful of top milk, butter the size of 
a walnut and pepper and salt, then stir- 
ring over the fire till it begins to thicken. 
When of the proper consistency, add a 
tablespoonful of lemon juice and it is 
ready for the table. 



124 TWENTY-FOUR FRENCH DINNERS 

A tart sauce for boiled fish that is 
much favored in the south of France 
but which, if it has ever crossed the 
water, has kept its arrival very quiet, 
is quite simply made and will be much 
liked as a decided change. To make it 
dissolve a tablespoonful of powdered 
mustard in a half cupful of fish stock 
and add two tablespoonfuls of white 
wine vinegar by preference, though 
other vinegar will do. Let this come to 
a boil, add two or three slices of lemon 
and boil a few minutes longer. Take 
from the fire and add two eggs that have 
been beaten with a teaspoonful of water. 
Season with salt and pepper and heat 
again but do not allow to boil.
