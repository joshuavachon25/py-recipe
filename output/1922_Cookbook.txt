taste. 

SMOTHERED EGGS— Take the required number of hard 
boiled eggs, one for each person to be served, mix some 
mashed potatoes with half its bulk of finely chopped meat 
of any kind, and bind with beaten eggs ; divide this into as 
many parts as people to be served, and roll each portion 
around a hard boiled egg after removing shell, of course ; 
lay in well greased pan and add gravy, if there is any left, 
if not, tomato dressing, and bake twenty minutes in hot 
oven or until brown.

mences to boil, acid one teaspoonful of soda; stir often 
and cook slowly till done. If it gets too dry before done, 
add a little more water. When clone, put a tablespoon 
of grease in skillet, if too dry add a little more water; 
mash as much of your hominy as you need for a meal, salt 
and pepper to taste and fry. Put the balance in refrig- 
erator for future use. You cannot tell this from the old- 
fashioned lye hominy.

saucer by itself. Beat the whites to a stiff froth, put 
some on every piece of toast and drop one yolk down in 
the middle of the whites on toast, sprinkle each with salt, 
put a pea of butter on each yolk, set dish on stove till 
whites are slightly browned, arrange around dish with

strips, using same sheer as for lattice potatoes; soak in 
cold water fifteen minutes, drain and dry between towels. 
Line a fine strainer of four inch diameter having a wire 
handle, with potatoes, place a similar strainer having a 
two and one-half inch diameter in larger strainer, thus 
holding potatoes in nest shapes. Fry in deep fat taking 



care that the fat does not reach too high a temperature 
at first. Keep the small strainer in place during frying 
with a long handled spoon. Carefully remove nests from 
strainer, drain on brown paper and sprinkle with salt. 
Fill with small fillets of fried fish.

an inch thick, sprinkle one-half with grated cheese to 
which has been added a few grains of salt and cayenne 
pepper. Fold, press edges firmly together, fold again, 
pat and roll out one-fourth inch thick. Sprinkle with 
cheese and proceed as before. Repeat twice; cut in strips 
five inches long and one-fourth wide. Bake eight min- 
utes in a hot oven. Cheese straws are piled log cabin 
style and served with cheese or salad course. 

HAM SOUFFLE — Two tablespoons butter, two flour, one 
and one-half cups sweet milk, three eggs, tablespoon chili 
sauce, one tablespoon grated cheese, one cup ground ham, 
salt and cayenne pepper to season. Melt the butter and

ually pour into flour mixture, stirring constantly until it 
thickens. Remove from the fire and add the beaten 
yolks of eggs, chili sauce, cheese and seasoning. Set aside 
to cool and when cold stir in ham and fold in the stiffly 
beaten whites of eggs. Pour into a well buttered and hot 
baking dish. Bake in a moderately hot oven until firm in 
the center. Garnish with parsley or water cress and 
serve immediately. 

CHEESE SOUFFLE— Make a white sauce using two table- 
spoons fat, three tablespoons flour, one-half teaspoon salt, 
speck of cayenne and one-half cup of milk. Add one-half 
cup grated cheese. Fold in the beaten yolks of three 
eggs, then fold in the beaten whites. Pour into a greased 
baking dish that will fit the cooker rack. Regulate heat 
till testing paper browns in forty-five seconds. Bake 
forty minutes.

SPANISH OMELET— Put two tablespoonsful oil into a 
frying pan and fry in it. a tablespoon of chopped green 
peppers, one of onion and one of chopped olives, add three 
good sized tomatoes ad stew gently until the sauce is 
rich and thick. Beat six eggs until light, season with salt 
and pepper and turn into the omelet pan. When the ome- 
let is well settled and about done pour sauce in the middle 
and fold over, or place the sauce around the omelet. Green 
peas added make a nice garnish. 

POTAOTO OMELET WITH BACON STRIPS— Fry several 
thin slices of bacon, take four cups boiled Irish potatoes, 
one cup of sweet milk, salt and pepper to taste, one table-

stove, cook well about three-quarters of an hour. 

SWEET PEACH PICKLE— Seven pounds of fruit, three 
and a half pounds sugar, one quart of vinegar ; stick three 
cloves in each peach; put on vinegar and sugar; when 
very hot, drop in fruit ; when tender, put in jars. 

CABBAGE PICKLE — Put cabbage in brine for a week, then 
take out ; put in weak vinegar to take out salt ; let remain 
in vinegar twenty-four hours ; it is then ready for the 
pickle, w r hich is made in the following manner: To one 
gallon of vinegar, put two pounds of sugar, three ounces

PRESERVES, JELLIES AND 
CANNED FRUITS 



FIG PRESERVES— Take figs not quite ripe enough to eat, 
don't peel or pull stems off, put them in a bucket of cold 
water and pour one-half teacup of lime in water and stir 
up; let the figs stand in this water one hour (this keeps 
them from mashing up) , then rinse them in another buck- 
et of pure water ; then weigh them ; put three-quarters of 
a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit; let boil until 
syrup is pretty thick. When you first put the figs and 
sugar on to cook, pour just enough water over it to keep 
from burning. 

PEAR PRESERVES— Take pears, peel, quarter and re- 
move all core ; measure three-quarters pound sugar to one 
pound of fruit ; put sugar over fruit and let stand all 
night; next morning cook until syrup is thick; put in a 
sliced lemon if preferred. 

STRAWBERRY PRESERVES— To every quart of berries, 
use one quart of sugar; boil each quart of berries and 
sugar in a pan to itself ; boil hard for twenty minutes and 
then seal in a tight jar while hot. Fix each quart of ber- 
ries and sugar this way. You will find it easier and better 
than the old way of boiling them all together at once. 

PLUM PRESERVES— Take one pound of sugar to each 
pound of plums and cook until done. 

MUSCADINE PRESERVES— Wash the muscadines; sepa- 
rate the hulls and pulp and boil the hulls until tender in 
barely enough water to cover them; boil the pulps in a 
little water and mash through a sifter to extract seed, 
add pulp to hulls, then add one pound of sugar to one of 
fruit; boil steadily thirty minutes or until well done. 

—85— 



BLACKBERRY JAM— Take berries, wash and put three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar to one pound of fruit; boil 
until thick; put a little water over fruit to start cooking. 

WILD PLUM JELLY— Take wild plums, wash and put in 
kettle to boil, cover with water; boil until mushy; take 
off; cool and strain through a thin domestic bag; take a 
cup of sugar and a cup of juice until it is all measured; 
let boil till it will jelly when cooled in a saucer; keep try- 
ing it until done, pour into jelly glasses while hot. By 
recooking for a short time, the plums may be used to get 
more juice and more jelly made from them, almost as 
much as from the first squeezing. 

CANNED PEACHES— Take peaches, peel and quarter 
them off the seed; weigh and put one-quarter pound of 
sugar to one pound of fruit ; let stand all night with sugar 
over it; next morning, boil until you can stick a straw 
through them, put in jars while hot and seal. Be sure 
your rubbers are on air tight. 

BRANDIED PEACHES— Put the peaches in boiling water 
for a few minutes so the skin will peel off easily ; make a 
syrup of one-half pound of sugar to one-half cup of water 
to each pound of peaches; skim as skum rises in boiling; 
then put in peaches and boil gently till tender, and no 
longer. Take them out carefully and fill jars ; remove the 
syrup from fire and add to it half pint of brandy to every 
pound of peaches. The peaches should be two-thirds ripe. 

CRANBERRY JELLY— Pick and wash the cranberries 
thoroughly, put on to cook with enough water to cover, 
let boil until tender then add sugar enough to sweeten 
to taste, cook until it will jelly in a saucer when cooled, 
take off, rub through a sifter into a bowl, when cool slice 
and serve with fowl or other meats.

THE ART OF DRYING 

AND CANNING 



The cold pack method of canning is so simple and the in- 
structions so easily followed that the women of the coun- 
try are taking up the work by the thousands, says the 
National Emergency Food Garden Commission. 
In the cold pack method these are the steps taken : 

1. — Select sound vegetables and fruits. If possible can 
them the same day they are picked. Wash, clean and 
prepare them. 

2. — Have ready on the stove, can or pail of boiling water. 

3. — Place the vegetables or fruits in cheesecloth or in some 
other porous receptacle — a wire basket is excellent — 
for dipping and blanching them in boiling water. 

4. — Put them whole into the boiling water. After the 
water begins to boil begin to count the blanching 
time. 

5. — The blanching time varies from one to 20 minutes, ac- 
cording to the vegetable or fruit. When the blanch- 
ing is complete remove the vegetables or fruits from 
the boiling water and plunge them a number of 
times into cold water, to harden the pulp and check 
the flow of coloring matter. Do not allow to stand 
in cold water. 

6. — The containers should be thoroughly clean. It is not 
necessary to sterilize them in steam or boiling water 
before filling them, for the reason that in the cold 
pack process both the insides of containers and the 
contents are sterilized. The jars should be heated 
before the cold product is put in them. 

—87— 



7. — Pack the product into the containers, leaving about a 

quarter of an inch of space at the top. 
8. — With vegetables add one level teaspoon of salt to 
each quart container and fill with boiling water. 
With fruits use syrups. 
9. — With glass jars always use a new rubber. Test the 
rubber by stretching or turning inside out. Fit on 
the rubber and put the lid in place. If the container 
has a screw, twist it up as hard as possible, but use 
only the thumb and little finger in tightening it. This 
makes it possible for steam generated within to 
escape and prevents breakage. If a glass top jar is 
used snap the top bail only, leaving the lower bail 
loose during sterilization. Tin cans should be com- 
pletely sealed. 

10. — Place the filled and capped containers on the rack in 
the sterilizer. If the home-made or commercial hot 
water bath outfit is used some authorities insist that 
enough water should be in the boiler to come at least 
one inch above the tops of the containers, and that 
the water, in boiling out, should never be allowed to 
drop to the level of these tops. Begin to count pro- 
cessing time when the water begins to boil. 

11. — At the end of the sterilizing period remove the con- 
tainers from the sterilizer. Fasten covers on tightly 
at once, tip each container over to test for leakage, 
and store. Be sure that no draught is allowed to 
blow on glass jars, as it may cause breakage. 

12. — If jars are to be stored where there is strong light 
wrap them in paper, preferable brown, as light will 
fade the color of products canned in glass jars, and 
sometimes deteriorate the food value. 

Vegetables are blanched before being put up for three pur- 
poses — to eliminate objectionable acids, to set coloring 
matter and to make texture firm for sterilization. 

The object of the cold dip is to separate the skin and harden 
the pulp, to set color bodies and to render packing easier. 

—88— 



These recipes are recommended by the U. S. government. 

TOMATOES — Grade according to ripeness, size and equali- 
ty. Scald to loosen the skins. Dip in cold water and re- 
move the skin. Pack whole. Fill with tomatoes only and 
add one level teaspoonful salt to each quart. Place the 
rubber and partly seal. Sterilize 22 minutes in the hot 
water bath. Remove the jars, tighten the covers, test 
the joints and invert to cool. 

CARROTS, PARSNIPS, SWEET POTATOES, ETC.— Scald 
from one to five minutes in boiling water. Plunge in cold 
water. Remove skins, pack whole or sliced, add boiling 
water and one level teaspoons salt to each quart. Place 
rubber and top, then partly tighten. Leave one and one- 
half hours in hot water bath. 

EGG PLANT — Scald five minutes in boiling salty water ; 
plunge in cold water; remove skin. Slice crosswise and 
pack ; add boiling water and one level teaspoonful salt for 
to each pint. Place rubber and top, then partly tighten. 
Leave one hour in hot water bath. Remove jars, tighten 
covers and invert to cool. 

SWEET CORN — On the Cob — Blanch in boiling water 10 to 
15 minutes, according to ripeness, size and freshness; 
plunge in cold water. Pack, alternating buts and tips; 
add just a little boiling water and one level teaspoonful 
of salt to each quart. Place rubber and top and partly 
tighten. Sterilize one and a half hours in water-seal out- 
fit. Remove jars, tighten covers, invert and cool. (Heat 
up for table use in steamer, not in water.) 

SWEET CORN — Off the Cob — Same as the foregoing reci- 
pe, except cut from ear after blanching. Pack and fill 
jars with boiling water, adding one level teaspoon salt to 
each pint. Proceed as before. 

PEAS, BEANS, OKRA, ETC.— Blanch five to 10 minutes in 
boiling water; plunge in cold water. Pack and add boiling 
water and one level teaspoonful salt to each pint. Place 
rubber and top, then partly tighten top. Process one and 
one-half hours in hot water bath. 

—89— 



BEETS, TURNIPS, ETC.— Blanch one to 10 minutes in boil- 
ing water ; plunge in cold water, remove skins. Slice and 
pack ; add boiling water and one level teaspoonf ul salt for 
each pint. Place rubber and top and partly tighten. Pro- 
cess one and one-half hours in hot water bath. Remove 
jars, tighten covers and invert to cool. 

GREENS — (Spinach, Dandelions, Mustard, Beet Tops, Swiss 
Chard) — Blanch in boiling water 10 to 20 minutes, plunge 
in cold water. Cut ready for table use. Season with 
slice of bacon for each pint. Pack, add hot water and a 
little salt to each quart. Place rubber and top and partly 
tighten. Process 90 minutes in hot water bath. Remove, 
tighten covers and invert to cool. It is always advisable 
to process the greens a short time before packing in or- 
der to reduce the bulk or make possible a full pack. 

Great results are expected from the dehydrating processes, 
which have been much improved and are being made use 
of more extensively this year than ever before. One of 
the kind which may be used in private houses is in daily 
operation at the depot in Hicksville, L. I. Here on three 
days of the week garden and farm products are preserved 
under comteptent instructors and will be stored and sold 
under the direction of the Long Island Food Battalion. On 
the other three week days the kitchen is open to women 
of the district who wish to preserve their own fruit and 
vegetables. 

All kinds of vegetables may be dried. They must be 
washed and, those that require it, peeled and sliced. Mod- 
ern drying is not the tedious process that it was in other 
times. Small quantities can be sufficiently dried in from 
two to four hours, according to the degree of succulence. 
They not only retain their flavor but much of their color, 
and when put in water to soak for cooking have all the 
value of fresh vegetables. Not only is there a great sav- 
ing in money in preserving fruits and vegetables in this 
way, but they require less room for storage and will keep 
almost indefinitely.

ENGLISH TOFFEE CANDY— Three cups dark brown su- 
gar, one can condensed milk (Dime Brand) butter, size 
of an egg ; mix sugar, milk and butter ; place on fire and 
stir constantly and let the sugar melt thoroughly ; cook 
till it threads or hardens in cold water; beat thoroughly 
and add one cup of pecans or walnuts ; pour on dish and 
cut in squares. This needs no flavoring.

on a tin and cut in squares. 

MARSHMALLOW CANDY— Dissolve one box Knox gela- 
tine in one brimming cup of lukewarm water for one 
hour; soak four cups sugar in one and one-third cups of 
water and cook like icing. When done, pour syrup over

the surface covered with powdered sugar; cut in squares 
and roll in powdered sugar. Put on plates to dry. 

PEANUT CRISP — Take two cups of granulated sugar and 
one cup of peanuts, chopped slightly. Put sugar, without

it the same thickness as for fudge. Tried once, this is a 
prime favorite. 

OLD FASHIONED BUTTER SCOTCH— Two cups brown 
sugar, one-half cup butter, four tablespoons molasses, two 
of water, two of vinegar. Put into a porcelain kettle ; stir

en very stiff, and then beat the candy mixture with them ; 
stir in nuts and flavor with vanilla, and beat until it be- 
gins to stiffen ; pour into buttered dish and cut in squares. 

CREAM WALNUTS— Dissolve one pound of powdered 
sugar in half cup of water ; boil five minutes and cool

FONDANT — Two cups of granulated sugar, one of water, 
and a scant quarter of a teaspoon of cream of tartar. 
Never stir after putting on fire. When it begins to look 
syrupy, stir a few drops in a saucer, if it creams, the 
candy is done ; pour out and stir until cool enough to work 
with hands ; the more it is worked the creamier it gets. 

CANDIED POP CORN^-Put into an iron kettle, one table- 
spoon of butter, three tablespoons of water, one cup of 
white sugar; boil until ready to candy; then throw in 
three quarts of nicely popped corn ; stir briskly till candy

until it is cooled a little and you have each grain separate 
crystalized with sugar, taking care that corn does not 
burn. Nuts of any kind prepared in this way are good. 

CARAMEL CANDY — Take two cups of sugar and one cup 
sweet milk ; put in vessel with teaspoon of butter and let 
cook slowly. Put one cup of sugar in at same time in a 
skillet and let brown, stir constantly until it all dissolves; 
then pour the brown sugar into the other and stir until 
all of the lumps dissolve. Have a cup of pecans cut up.

is done. Take up, flavor with vanilla, and beat pecans 
into mixture. Pour on dish and cut into squares.

LIGHT DIET FOR 
THE HICK 



HYGENIC EGG — Butter an ordinary glass, fill with the 
white of one egg beaten light, put yolk on the top and 
season with a little butter, salt and pepper and put glass 
into a covered vessel of steaming water until cooked. 

PANNADA — Take dry bread and toast and cut in small 
squares, add sugar and nutmeg to taste, cover with hot 
water and serve. 

LEMON ALBUMEN— Take the juice of half o lemon, white 
of one egg, add sugar to taste, put all together in a jar 
and shake well; add a small glass of water and strain. 

BOILED FLOUR FOR SUMMER COMPLAINT IN CHIL- 
DREN OR FOR INVALIDS— Put a pint of flour in a 
clean sack or pudding bag, tie and place in pot of boiling 
water, boil eight hours ; when done peel off the outer layer 
and you will have a hard white lump of flour, milk thick- 
ened with some of this flour grated makes a good gruel, 
can be sweetened or salted to taste. Can be eaten in 
small pieces as one would eat candy, and is excellent in 
bowel trouble. 

SURE CURE FOR FLUX— Get the root of the common 
blackberry vine, scrape off the bark, place root in water 
and steep as in making tea, drink freely ; it will also cure 
summer complaint in teething children and is harmless. 

WHEN BOILING MILK— If pans in which milk, custards, 
or salad dressing are to be boiled are first wiped out with a 
cloth greased with lard they will neither stick nor scorch.

HOUSEHOLD HINTS 



TO EXTRACT A SPLINTER— Take a wide-mouthed bottle 
and almost fill with hot water, then place the part with the 
splinter over the mouth of bottle and press lightly; the 
suction will draw the flesh from the splinter and the 
splinter may be easily removed. This also heals the sore- 
ness of the wound. 

TO REMOVE INK SPOTS FROM WHITE GOODS— Dip in 
kerosene oil and rub with ordinary laundry soap, at the 
end of half an hour wash with soap and water. 

HOME-MADE FLOOR FINISH— To keep my hard wood 
and varnished floors in good condition, I take equal parts 
of linseed oil and coal oil, heat and rub floors. They will 
look like new. This makes a finish for any floor if 
brushed on while boiling hot. 

TO CLEAN RUGS— Rugs of a light color may be made to 
look almost like new in the following way: Beat thor- 
oughly and, after the dust has settled, spread over the 
rug, a paste of corn meal and gasoline. Rub in with a 
clean stiff scrubbing brush. Let remain until thorough- 
ly dry, then sweep meal out with stiff whisk broom, and 
let remain in open air until all odor of gasoline escapes. 

FOR PALMS AND FERN&— A tablespoon of castor oil 
poured on the ground around the roots of palms and ferns 
once a month will give them a rapid growth and make 
them look fresh and green. 

FOR THE MACHINE— To keep oil from dripping on sewing 
after oiling, fasten a bit of absorbent cotton to the needle 
or just above the needle. 

TO CLEAN WHITE KID GLOVES— Dip cloth in gasoline 
and then in prepared chalk, and rub the soiled places on 
the gloves. Repeat until they are thoroughly clean and 
you will never again use the old method of putting them 
on the hands and dipping them in the fluid.

KITCHEN HINTS 



TO MAKE STEAK TENDER— To transform a tough piece 
of beefsteak into a nutritious and tender one, by a method 
employed in many of the first-lass hotels and restau- 
rants, proceed as follows : Put three tablespoons of vine- 
gar into a deep platter ; add one of olive oil ; lay steak in 
it for several hours before it is to be used, turning every 
hour. If for breakfast, it should be fixed the night be- 
fore, steak should be cooked without wiping it and season- 
ing with butter, pepper and salt and garnished with sliced 
lemon. 

FOR JUICY PIE FILLING— A straw, such as is used at 
soda fountains, cut in two and stood upright in the pie 
when baking will allow the steam to escape and prevent 
the juice from running over the edge. 

BREAKING EGGS — Dip saucer into cold water, before 
breaking eggs into it, to pour into water to poach and the 
yolk will not break so easily. 

TO TENDER MEAT— Tough meat may be made tender by 
placing in vinegar water for a few minutes. 

TO REMOVE ODOR— Biscuit dough, tied in a clean cloth, 
dropped in boiling cabbage, will do away with all unpleas- 
ant odor. 

TO MAKE PIES BROWN— Take a cloth and wipe the top 
off with a little sweet milk. 

TO IMPROVE ICING — Use one-third teaspoon of cream of 
tartar. 

—96— 



TO KEEP CAKE FROM FALLING — If you will slam a pan 
up and down several times, after pouring your cake dough 
into it, the cake wont fall when you turn it in the 
stove. 

TO KEEP OUT RED ANTS— Place a small quantity of 
green sage in the pantry shelves. 

REMEMBER — Slamming the door of the oven makes the 
cake fall. 

TO REMOVE INK STAINS— Rub the stain with ripe to- 
matoes. 

TO KEEP LEMON — Cover with cold water, changing every 
week. 

TO KEEP FRUIT OR OTHER CAKE— A ripe apple placed 
in the cake box will keep it moist and prevent drying out, 
and retain its freshness. 

FOR BURNT FRUITS OR VEGETABLES— When fruit or 
vegetables burn, set vessel in pan of cold water and re- 
move cover ; after a few minutes empty contents into an- 
other vessel taking care not to disturb burnt part. No 
burnt taste will remain.

MECHANICAL TOY PARTY 

The invitation said : "Bring your favorite mechanical 
toy to my house on Saturday evening." This was planned 
and carried out by a lad of ten. Well, it was wonderful, the 
motley array of toys assembled with their owners on a broad 
porch of a surburban home one day last week. There were 
spiders, beetles, bugs of all kinds, kicking mules, a train 
of cars, boats that sped across the ocean, forts that blew up 
at the right minute, soldiers that went through the man- 
ual of arms and of course automobiles that went like the real 
ones, and also stopped, and refused to go like real ones. One 
young hopeful had borrowed his sister's Paris dolls that 
lisped her name and said "Mama" and "Papa" like any well 
bred child. After the merits of toys had been shown and 
discussed the hostess appeared with a luncheon that de- 
lighted the boys. There were hard boiled eggs, a fruit sal- 
ad, sandwiches, crackers and a pink bowl of lemonade to 
which they were given free access. A party like this is ab- 
solutely no trouble as far as entertaining is concerned, for 
each guest supplies his own as well as for the others too.

TO DISTRIBUTE CHRISTMAS GIFTS 

A novel way to distribute Christmas gifts is to make 
a huge turkey red stocking, cotton or white drilling. Run 
a wire in the top of the hem to keep it open, and suspend 
from a hook in the ceiling by a large red ribbon. Decorate 
a ladder with ribbon and holly or Christmas green and stand 
by the stocking. Hang it up a few days before Christmas 
and drop packages in. Light packages or letters may be 
pinned on the outside. At breakfast table on Christmas 
morning draw lots for the honor of unloading the stocking. 



INDIAN MEAL FOR THANKSGIVING NIGHT 

If anyone desires a novelty to which to ask a family of 
intimate friends, try this on Thanksgiving. Issue your in- 
vitation on Indian paper or birch wood paper, asking the 
guests to come to the Indian Meal. Serve the following 
menu and have a wigwam for the table centerpiece, with 
birch bark canoes to hold salted peanuts or popcorn. 

Corn Mush or Hasty Pudding With Milk 

Succotash Bean Soup 

Brown Bread or Indian Meal Corn Bread (Johnny Cake) 

Indian Pudding 

If the guests will come in Indian costume so much the 
better. After supper have a bead stringing contest. Use 
the bright colored beads that come for kindergarten use. 



THE GLAD THANKSGIVING TIME 

In preparing for Thanksgiving one naturally thinks 
first of the dinner, but after that happy repast is over and 
conversation lags there must be something to do, so I am 
going to tell you about a pumpkin party that would be nice 
for the evening if you want to ask some children to help 
celebrate. You may call it a "pumpkin party," for somehow 

—100— 



we always associate this gorgeous yellow vegetable with 
Thanksgiving time. So we'll have — 

"Pumpkins large and pumpkins small, 
Pumpkins short and pumpkins tall, 
Pumpkins yellow and pumpkins green, 
Pumpkins dull and those with sheen." 
Use one cut in half, lengthwise for the centerpiece (just 
half.) Fill it with apples, bananas, red grapes and white 
grapes, purple ones, too, if you can get them. Around the 
top stick Christmas tree candle holders and fill with small 
white candles. When lit the effect is lovely, and as pretty 
a centerpiece as you can imagine. Yellow crepe paper may 
be fashioned into adorable pumpkins for holding salted nuts, 
and the light may be shaded with paper pumpkin bloss- 
oms. Have a huge paper pumpkin for a "Jack Horner" pie, 
with yellow ribbons, one for each child. For favors you may 
use popcorn put up like ears of corn in green oiled paper with 
green paper corn leaves. For this informal occasion I would 
suggest using the pretty "Thanksgiving" paper napkins, 
and if you do not mind extra trouble each child may have a 
yellow crepe paper pumpkin cap to wear. Serve very simple 
"eats" consisting of cold turkey sandwiches, cocoa, popcorn, 
molasses candy and wee pumpkin tarts with a spoonful of 
ice cream on top. 



A HOLIDAY PARTY 

Here is how a holiday party was given once upon a time 
not so very long ago. It was a white affair, with quantities 
of silver decorations, which were lovely. The invitations 
were on heavy white paper ornamented with wreaths in sil- 
ver tinsel and holly wreaths tied with red ribbon and silver 
guaze. The combination was lovely. The lamps were chad- 
ed with white and silver and the candle shades for the table 
were of white and silver. 

The first game was a pretty one; a large wreath of 
frosted holly leaves was suspended by silver cords; in the 
center was a cluster of silvered sleigh bells. Each guest was 

—101— . 



handed three white rubber balls and allowed three throws 
at the bells. If any throw made the bells jingle a prize of a 
silver paper box of silver wrapped bon-bons w r as awarded. 
Guests Blindfolded 

Then a silver-leaved wreath was laid flat upon the table 
containing a number of white candies. The guests were 
blindfolded and the one who succeeded in blowing out the 
largest number of candles at one blow was given a pretty 
box tied with silver cord which said "For a Blower," and 
was found to contain a handkerchief. In this game the 
prizes were the same for the boy and the girl. 

The dining room table was a thing of beauty; it was 
first covered with cotton, sprinkled with quantities of dia- 
mond dust, the edge of the table outlined with silver leaves, 
and the same leaves surrounded the plates. A small gift 
tree was in the center, trimmed entirely in white and silver, 
with red electric lights. Just imagine how pretty it all 
looked. The place cards were frosted silver and white bells 
and were hung from the tumblers by silver-paper birds. A 
large white cake with red candles was cut with ceremony 
and favors of silver were found inside for the guests. 



AN ANNOUNCEMENT PARTY 

This was given in the evening, and both men and wom- 
en were asked. There were about 20 guests, all good friends, 
so the affair was not at all stiff. The hostess passed cards 
tied with true-lover's knots of blue with little blueprints 
(snapshots) of the happy pair at the top. Below the word 
"Matrimony" was printed in blue and gold letters. The 
game was to see how many words (proper names barred) 
could be made in half-hour. 

Every one was surprised at the announcement, which 
was told without any other explanation, and the couple were 
overwhelmed with congratulations. 

At the conclusion of the word contest a basket was 
passed containing tiny bells, wee slippers, two rings, two 
hearts, envelopes containing a love message, etc. Thus 

—102— 



partners were found by matching these love tokens. Then 
to the music of Lohengrin's wedding march, they went to 
the dining room, where this dainty repast was served: 
Creamed chicken in heart-shaped patties, hot biscuits, also 
heart-shaped; ambrosia, and pink-iced heart cakes; 
"Lover's delight" nectar was served in tall glasses. This 
was merely grape juice with plenty of cracked ice. 



A HAPPINESS LUNCHEON 

For a recent bride a Bluebird Luncheon was given by 
her maid of honor and attended by her most intimate girl 
friends. 

The usual white table linen was dispensed with and one 
of the blue and white Japanese cloths used. The design 
was one of bluebirds skimming across the white ground. 
The napkins matched the cloth, and blue white dishes were 
used. The centerpiece was a cut glass bowl filled with bride 
roses and bachelor-buttons. From the chandeiier overhead 
were suspended bluebirds by invisible threads, so that they 
fluttered gracefully over the bowl of flowers. These the 
hostess made by drawing the birds on cardboard, painting 
them in the proper tints, and cutting them out. The same 
birds formed the place cards and were poised on the edge 
of the water glasses, bearing in their bills the names 
of the guests. 

There was no attempt, of course, to carry out the decor- 
ative idea in the menu ; but with the coffee each guest gave 
a "happiness toast" to the bride-to-be. These had been pre- 
pared beforehand at the request of the hostess, who had 
sent to each girl a bluebird decorated card on which her 
toast was to be written and brought to the luncheon. Many 
of the toasts were original, but some were quotations from 
the play "The Bluebird." 

In the afternoon, games were played and the prizes 
were bits of jewelry in the popular bluebird design, the 
guest favor being a quaint silver necklace with pendant of 
an enameled bluebird, from all the girls.

APPENDIX 



BOUILLON — Take four pounds of lean beef and cut in 
small pieces and boil in four quarts of water, let cook 
slowly for four or five hours until reduced to two quarts. 
Remove from fire and let cool with meat in the liquor. 
Then squeeze all moisture from meat and let stand all 
night. Next morning skim off all grease and place upon 
the fire. Whip the white of an egg to a stiff froth and 
stir in the boiling liquid, so as to collect all impurities. 
After boiling a few minutes remove skim and strain. 
Season with salt and pepper, serve hot with a slice or 
little block of lemon. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES— One solid cup of meat chopped 
fine, season with one-half teaspoon of salt, one half tea- 
spoon celery salt, one salt spoon of pepper and a speck 
of cayenne, a few drops of onion juice, one tablespoon 
lemon juice, one teaspoon chopped parsley. Mix with a 
thick sauce made with two tablespoonfuls of butter, two 
of flour, one cup of milk. Spread on plate and let cool, 
shape and roll in cracker meal and egg and fry. This 
makes about twelve. It is better to make one day and 
fry the next. 

BAKED BASS OR TROUT— Take one nice trout or bass, 
weighing about four pounds, dress and place on ice for a 
short time, remove from ice and place in long pan, rub 
with salt and a small quantity of black pepper,, pour just 
enough water over the fish to keep it from burning, and 
add about one heaping tablespoon of Crisco, set in stove 
and let cook for about 30 minutes, have ready a dressing 
made from two cups bread crumbs, one tablespoon but- 
ter, small onion chopped fine, just enough to slightly 
taste, two pieces of celery, also chopped fine or celery 

—104— 



seed may be used, black pepper, and salt to season, one 
dozen small fresh oysters and mix with the water from 
where the fish is cooked, fill fish with this dressing and 
also place around fish in the pan, return to stove add 
more hot water if needed, and bake until done, but not 
fall to pieces. Serve on platter that has been heated, 
garnish with sliced lemon. The liquor from this makes 
all sauce necessary for gravy, as the dressing thickens it 
to a creamy gravy. 

Be sure in dressing fish to bake to leave the head on 
but remove eyes and gills. This is an attractive dish 
and also one very much relished. 

FRIED LAKE TROUT— SOUTHERN STYLE— Take fresh

into the boiling fat, keep hot and when brown on one 
side turn and repeat this until the fish is done but do 
not allow to cook till hard. Serve while hot with sliced 
lemon. Large trout have to be sliced in halves before 
cooking but the small ones are fine cooked whole. 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS— Take amount of oysters, put a 
layer in pan, then a layer of rolled crackers, butter and 
milk, pepper and salt until pan is full then run in stove 
and brown, cook about half hour.

mustard, 1 pound sugar, 1-3 cup salt, 1 qt. of white vine- 
gar, 1 tablespoon tumeric; cook until light brown color 
then add ten ears of tender corn, cut and scraped, and 
cook a little longer, this will make nine quarts. If more 
is wanted double recipe. 

SWEET POTATOES WITH MARSHMALLOWS— Boil 

whole potatoes until done, then peel and mash, add sweet 
milk, a pinch of salt, a tablespoon of butter, sugar 
enough to sweeten to taste, a little nutmeg or cinnamon.

up together, about one and one-half cups sugar or sweet- 
en to taste, one spoon butter, three heaping tablespoons 
of sifted flour, set on stove and stir constantly until
