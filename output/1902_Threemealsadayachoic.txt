FIRST WORDS. 



\ I /he science of cookery may very properly be 
q) I (9 classed among the fine arts, and certainly it 
is by no means the least among them ; for, 
in the nature of events, a practical knowledge of 
scientific cooking touches more intimately our homes 
and home comforts, and influences the masses of 
the people as no other art, however lofty in its con- 
ception, or elevating in its results, may hope to do. 
The culinary art may truthfully be said to pave and 
prepare the foundation of all sesthetical arts ; for, as 
a man is inevitably what he eats, so the characteris- 
tics of the cookery presented to his palate, are almost 
invariably reproduced in his life and works. 

" Good Cookery," says a contemporaneous writer, 
" is the foundation of good digestion ; and good di- 
gestion is the foundation and first factor in sound 
thinking. The grain and wheat springing green, 
and ripening under favoring sunshine and showers, 
produce not only a certain portion of food for the 
stomach, but also a certain amount of mental energy,

from wWcli result thouglits, clogged and bound, or 
free and soaring, according to the foi'm that food has 
taken." Hence the responsibility of the cook, who 
sees in her work not only food for the body, but in- 
spiration for the mind, becomes weighty and far- 
reaching in its possibilities. Proper care and at- 
tention, however, will be found necessary in order 
to secure the best results from a given amount 
of raw material; neither will the moments thus 
spent be tijne wasted ; for, according to an eminent 
physician, "every young housewife who loves her 
household, and every young maiden who hopes to 
have a household to preside over, should study the 
best works on culinary subjects, just as they study 
grammar, arithmetic, geography, and other elemen- 
tary branches of education in the schools." 

That this theory is gradually making its way 
into the minds of the people, is evidenced by the 
schools of cookery and books devoted to this science 
that are springing into existence on every hand ; and 
not without reason, for a new cook-book is needed 
very much in the same manner that a new fashion 
magazine is required from time to time. 

Every day newer, more healthful, more delightful 
dishes are invented for the delectation of the palate, 
and more economical methods are continually being 
sought out for their concoction, so that the posses-

sion of one cook-book in a iouseliold should not be 
urged as a reason why another work on the culinary 
art should not be purchased also. 

Kconomy and pleasure alike demand chat we 
should acquire the easiest and most skillful methods 
of steering the domestic ship safely and smoothly 
on its way. System is the pivot upon which all 
good housekeeping turns. A careful study of the 
" Household Department ." of this book, the " Laun- 
•dry, House Cleaning, Papering " and kindred arts, 
will gfive the unskilled beginner a clear conception of 
the practical details of home duties as accomplished 
bytheir own hands, or superintended in an assist- 
ant. 

In the " Cooking Department " no pains have been 
spared to collect from every sourqe recipes combining 
healthfulness with palatableness, and daintiness with 
economy. The extravagant cuisine of the wealthiest 
homes has been catered for, while the more moderate, 
households, and the small economies appertaining 
thereto, have all been consulted: friends far and 
near, east, west, north and south, notable housekeep- 
ers, and skilled in every department of housewifery, 
have contributed their mite to the general whole, 
with the result now before you. 

The " Bills of Fare " herewith given will meet al- 
most every occasion that may arise, while the " Bti-

for almost any imaginable emergency will be found 
so complete, that a novice need not fear to attempt

The " Dainty Desserts," the " Summer Desserts," 
the " Hasty Desserts," the preparation and serving 
of "Fresh Fruits," the different methods of pre-

many other departments, are recommended to the 
reader's notice. 

And last, but by no means least, the " Toilet De- 
partment '' is brought prominently before the ladies. 
It is a lamentable fact, as remarked by a recent 
writer on "Beauty," that " the women of to-day pre- 
serve their youth longer than they do their beauty." 
That they may study this department closely, prac- 
tice its teachings faithfully, and that their beauty 
may outlive their youth, is the fervent wish of

MRAT8 IN GENB.RAIi. 

«V^ BEF. — To be a good judge of meats is essential to safe and 
1*^ successful markeljing. Beef is in most general favor and 
*^-^ takes natural precedence in the list. 

Good beef, if young, will be of a bright red color, fine grained, 
firm to the touch. The fat a clear straw color, and a little of it 
through the muscles, giving the meat a marbled appearance. The 
suet should be dry and crumbly, and of a darker shade than the f^t> 
In old beef both flesh and fat will be darker, much coarser in fiber, 
and decidedly dry compared with young beef. 

If the beef is of a pale dull color and flabby, it is not well 
matured ; if very dark colored and coarse-grained with Seep yellow 
fat it will be found tough and tasteless; and if it bears greenish 
tints, and feels slippery on the surface it is already stale and un- 
fit for use. 

Meat to be tender, should be eaten when first killed, as the 
muscles are relaxed then. After a short time they stiffen, when the 
flesh wUl be proportionately hard. Afterward they again relax 
when the flesh will be found as at first, tender and juicy, , 

If kept long the meat should be carefully wiped as often as 
moisture gathers. 

Each side of beef is divided into two parts, the fore and hind- 
quarters, and these again into the various cuts. The hindqu'arter 
contains loin, rump, round, fillet or tenderloin, leg and flank; the 
loins include the tenderloins, a small part of which runs back 
into the rump. ' The loin is cut usually into steaks and roasts. 
The flank is useless save for corning, as a "plate-piece," that is, one 
from which the bones can be removed after boiling and the whole

lO THREE MEALS A DAY. 

pressed. Bib roasts are next best to sirloin, the first five ribs 
being considered the choicest cut. The ribs can be removed and 
used in making soup-stock and the meat rolled and skewered se- 
curely, for convenience in carving. If the roast is rolled at the 
meat market, have the bones sent home, to be used in making soup. 
Steaks are in most demand. Sirloin is best liked, as it includes a 
portion of the tenderloin; the third cut of the round is the best 
and juiciest steak. Trim off every superfluous bit of bone or 
gristle and add to the soup-stock. 

Among other parts, the shank is used for a soup bone; the 
round may be taken for braised beef or pot roast; the flank for 
soup or stew; hock for soup; the rump to roast or boU. 

Mntton- — Good mutton is one of the most nutritious and easily 
digested meats in use, and particularly adapted to invalids, but, 
on account of the superabundance of fat, by no means the most 
economical. In choosing mutton particular attention should be 
paid to the appearance of the fat. In the best it should look white 
and clear, and the lean will be firm, dark-red, and juicy. '• 

Mutton requires long keeping, even more than beef. After a 
few days hanging in a cool place in summer, and much longer in 
winter, it will be found that the "cold air has entirely removed the 
"woolly" taste and rendered the meat itself tender. 

The saddle and shoulder of mutton are the most desirable for 
roasting. A saddle of mutton is simply the two loins joined. 
The leg, unless very tender, is better for boiling and may be cooked 
when quite fresh. Chops are cut from the loin or ribs. The 
flank and breast are best for stews or broth. Mutton is at its best 
from August to the Holidays. 

Lamb. — Lamb is in season from May to September. It is 
cut very much like mutton. The bones are slightly reddish in 
color, and the fat is firm and white. 

Veal. — Veal, though a favorite meat, requires great discrimina- 
tion in its selection, the question as to its wholesomeness being a 
disputed point. Very thorough cooking is required to fit it for 
the table and even then it is far less digestible than beef or mutton. 
Nevertheless, from mock turtle soup, down through the bill of fare, 
to calves' foot jelly, veal furnishes the material for many daintv 
'■'"has. It is in season from A-pril to September. 



MARKETING. II 

Good veal should have a firm, white fat, and lean with a pinkish 
tinge. If too white, the calf has been bled, and this detracts from 
the flavor. If too yeung the meat will have a bluish tinge, and be 
soft and flabby to the touch. 

Younger than four weeks, veal is unfit for food. The loin of 
veal is best for roasting; the leg furnishes fillets and cutlets; the 
knuckle makes a good white soup. The fillet is simply a solid 
piece of meat from the upper part of the leg, and can be roasted 
plain, or stuffed and roasted. The breast answers for stews or 
soups. The sweet-breads are especially delicate, and should al- 
ways be chosen in preference to those of the grown animal. Sweet- 
breads are white, fat-looking pieces, or glands found near the heart 
of the animal. The head makes a delicious mock turtle soup. The 
tongue is excellent pickled; the brains may be served in epicurean 
ways ; the liver is the best of all animal livers, as are the kidneys. 

Pork. — Fresh pork should be firm with clear white skin, pale 
red lean, and pure white fat. If the fat is tinged with yellow and 
inclined to be soft and flabby, the pork is inferior in «[ua!ity. 
Spare ribs form the favorite roasting piece, the loin coming next 
in the popular estimation. Chops and steaks may be cut from 
either loin or ribs. The hams and shoulders are smoked, the other 
portions are usually pickled, and the trimmings utilized as sausage 
meat. The head is most desirable in the form of head cheese 
though it is sometimes pickled; the feet, under the guise of souse, 
are the daintiest and most digestible portion of the ani^^al. 

GAMR. 

Venison. — This meat is in season throughout the year. It 
requires less care in curing than other meats. Venison is usually 
kept several days before cooking. The time, however, varies with 
the season and climate. If slightly tainted before using, the proc- 
ess of putrefaction may be checked by a free use of freshly 
powdered charcoal. Black pepper is useful to protect from flies ; 
dust thoroughly with it, and wipe off any moisture that may gather 
while hanging. 

When venison is yoraig, the fat is clear and white, and of 
considerable thickness, whik the lean should be a dark red. The

cats are abont the same as mutton. A saddle of veniaon is a 
favorite roast, loin or haunch cgming next. 

Hares and Rabbits.— The marks of a young hare are smooth, 
sharp claws, ears that tear readily and a narrow cleft in the lip. 
With the exception of this last the same tests will apply to the 
choice of rabbits. They should be kept some time before cooking, 
especially hares. 

POUIaTRY. 

Turkeys. — Turkeys from ten to twelve pounds weight are 
most desirable. If young the leg is smooth and black, a rough and 
reddish look indicating age. The meat should be firm, and the 
end of the breast bone easily bent. 

Chickens may be chosen by the same tests, remembering that 
a young fowl wiU have smooth legs and comb. 

Geese when young, have bills and feet yellow in color, 
changing to red as they advance in age. Another test is the 
brittleness of the windpipe. If this breaks easily between the 
finger and thumb the bird is young, if it rolls it is not to be 
trusted. 

Dncks. — Have supple feet, otherwise the same tests should 
be applied to them as to fowls. Of the many varieties of wild 
duck the canvas-back is the finest and most expensive, the mallard 
and red-head coming next. 

Pigeons must be selected by the condition of the feet; if stiff 
and dry they show age, while if pliable the bird is young. Tame 
pigeons are larger than wild and much more tender and juicy. 
They make their appearance in October. They should be eaten 
fresh, as keeping spoils them. 

Squabs.— Are the young of the tame pigeon, and are delicate 
and delicious. 

Prairie Chickens can be found in market from September 
to April. 

Partridges when young, have yellow legs and dark-colored 
bill. 

Wood Cock are in season from July to November and always 
excessively high in pried. 

plovers should be fat aoid hare pliable feet. ' 



MARKETING. I3 

It must be remembered that the odor abont all wild birds is 
a peculiar,' "gamey" one, in nowise resembling that of tainted 
medt. Bits of fresh charcoal will help to sweeten the inside of 
all game. 

FISH. 

Fresh Fish. — One test can be applied to all varieties. If 
fresh the eyes should be full, the body fuU.with firm thick flesh, 
the fins stiif, and the skin and scales bright. Small fish coming 
under the head of "pan-fish" are best fried or broiled. The large 
varieties are boiled or baked. Fish in a prime condition, if' held 
in the hand horizontally will remain rigid; any drooping of the 
tail shows it not quite right. , 

Cod is in season the whole year. The flesh should be firm 
and white. 

Salmon sliould have firm red flesh and gills. When fresh it 
is in season from April to July. It is very rich in oil. Fresh 
salmon is really improved by keeping a day or two. 

White Fish is to be had almost throughout the year. It is 
very white and delicate. 

Mackerel and Herring are oily and nutritious. 

Tnrbot should be thick and firm with the underside a yellow- 
ish white. 

Halibnt if too large, is coarse and dry. About seventy-five 
poiinds is a good weight. The flesh of a fresh hahbut should be 
purely white. 

Fresh Water Fish may be chosen by the same testa. 

shriaIa pish. 

Lobsters. — Are best in May and June. If fresh the elasticity 
of the tail will be a marked featxure. If boiled remember that 
good ones are very heavy for. the size, and that medium-siz^d ones 
are the best flavored. 

Crabs must be judged by weight ; if good the joints will be ^tiff 
and the odor agreeable. Ejres dull and sunken betray staleness. 

Oysters. — The small varieties have most flavor and make 
better stews and soup ; for frying, large ones are more convenient. 
Many people keep live oysters, in soitnecool place, the cellar floor

being nsually chosen for this purpose. Sprinkle them thoroughly, 
night and momiag, with meal and water, which is thought to flavor 
and fatten them at the same time. 

RGGS. 

Eggs are tested by holding them toward the light. If tiny 
spots present themselves it is not newly laid. If a large spot 
appears, the egg is bad, and should never be used. The yolk of an 
egg is the most nutritious part; the white of an old egg is compact 
and difficult to digest. Hen's eggs are considered the best; turkey 
eggs not quite so mild; goose eggs large and well flavored; duck 
eggs are, perhaps, richei: and stronger in taste than any other. 

SUNDRIES. 
Flour improves with age.and costs much less bought by the 
barrel. Whole spice, of every variety, is as necessary as ground. 
A. bottle of Halford sauce or mushroom catsup will last years for 
flavoring gravies. The store-room should, if possible, contain 
mustard, pepper, rice, tapioca, maccaroni, vinegar, coffee, tea, sugar, 
ehooolate^ pearl barley, etc. 




G^^TijqG. 



o^^^lHE carving knife should be light, of meditun size, with a fine 
■ C\ edge. Skill is required in its management far more than 
, ^«-«' strength, and to facilitate this, it is well to have the joints 
of the bones of the larger roasts divided before leaving the meat 
market. Thin sUces may then be easily cut. 

Ji the whole of the meat belonging to each bone should be too 
thick, a small slice may be taken off between every two bones. 

The seat of the carver shotdd be somewhat elevated for the sake 
of convenience and ease of manner. If the carver's seat be low, it 
ifi more graceful to rise to the feet while carvinf?, 

FOWIaS. 

Place fowls on the platter, breast up. 

In carving, as the legs are always bent inward and tucked into 
the body, the skewers or cords by which they are confined should 
be removed before serving. 

Some good carvers prefer laying the fowl on their own plate, 
and placing the joints, as they are cut, upon the dish. 

In taking off the wing the joint only should be divided by 
the knife, for by lifting up the pinion of the wing with the fork, and 
drawing it toward the leg, the muscles will easily separate. Next, 
' slip your knife between the leg and body, cut to the bone, and 
with the fork turn the leg back and the joint will give way. The 
neck bones are taken off by putting in the knife and pressing it 
under the long hard part of the bone ; then lift the neek bone and 
break it o£f from the part fastened to the breast. Afterward cui 
slices from both sides of the breast. The back, as least de^able 
of all, is usually left in the dish, though the two sides may be taken 
oS. Be sure to serve dressing to each guest, and if the fowl has 
been trussed with liver and gizzard serve one of these with each

wing. The leg shduld be dmded in two joints for eonTenieiiCft in 
serving. 

Turkey.— This requires first, that the breast should be carved; 
after this proceed in the same manner as with a fowl, except that 
the legs and wings being larger, are divided at the lower joint. 
The drumstick, if very hard and dry, is left upon the -platter. 

To carve the breast, begin cutting close to the bone. Each 
Slice should carry with it a portion of the dressing, or forcemeat 
that fills the body. 

Goose.— The breast and legs of a goose afford the finest pieces. 
Dismember the legs and wings. Next cut under the merry-thotigh1« 
remove it and slice from the breast, giving a portion of dressing 
with each slice. 

Ducks. — Carve in the same manner. Always remember, how- 
ever, that the joints of water-fowl spread and go farther back than 
those of land fowls. 

Partridges, Pheasants and Grouse.— To be carved in ihe 

same manner as fowls. 

Pigeons, Quail, Woodcock and Snipe.— These game birds 
are merely split down the back, and one half given to each guest. 

I PORK. 

Roast Pig. — A roast pig is divided before being placed on the 
table, and is sometimes garnished with the head and e&ys. Th^s 
custom is distasteful to many people, and is more honoretl in the 
breach than the observance. Separate a shoulder from one side, 
then a leg. Dismember the opposite side in the same manner. 
Then divide and serve the ribs, which are frequently considered th*! 
choicest part. 

Ham may be carved in several ways. First, by cutting long, 
thin, delicate slices through the thick fat in the center down to the 
bone. Second, by running the point of the knife in the circle of 
the middle and cutting thin round slices. Last, and most econom- 
icaJ, by b^puming at the knuckle, and slicing upward. 

TONGUEl. 

Tongue should be carved as thin as a wafar, its delicacy 
depending greatly on this* Gut <^rnnowise in round slices.

A Sii'loinof beef should be placed on the dish with the tender- 
loin underneath. Ihin cut slices should be taken from the side 
next the carver, then turn over the roast and carve the tenderloin. 
A portion of both should be served.

serve this dish with a fish trowel. The middle part is usually con- 
sidered best. Give a portion of the roe or liver to each person. 

In serving a guest with gravies, do not pour over the meat or 
fish, but on one side the plate.

• OUP, nourishing but simple, should form the first course at 
every dinner table. In its fluid form the aliment is ready 
almost immediately to enter the system, and exhaustion and 
irritability disappear like magic after partaking of a plate of warm, 
nutritious soup. 

This department, then, has been prepared with the end in 
•view of simplifying and popularizing what in nearly every country, 
save our own, is a national dish. 

Necessarily, however, this division of the book, in order to 
be complete, must contain many hints for elaborate soups, but the 
busy housewife will find far more in accord with a limited purse 
and overburdened hands. In many instances, too, it will be found 
that the name is more elaborate than the really simple nature of 
the soup will justify. For instance, the appellations^ consumme 
and puree, applied so often to soups, whUe scarcely translatable into 
equivalent English terms, are as follows:— (7onso!?tme — a rich, clear 
soup, colored or not. Puree, a pulp of meat, or vegetables pressed 
through a sieve and added to a soup until it has the smooth con- 
sistency of gravy. Other soups, where the beans or vegetables are 
added whole, may be called " plain" for the sake of distinction. 

SOUP STOCK. 

To ensure a variety of appetizing soups it will be found advis- 
able to keep a supply of soup-stock to be used as the foundation 
for any required soup. 

Stock is prepared by extracting the juices from meat by slow 
boiling, after which various ingredients maybe added to give char- 
acter to the soup. 

To 4 pounds lean beef (inferior parts answer every purpose), 
add 4 quarts of water. Have the meat cut from the bone in solid 



SOUP, 19 

pieces for after use; crack the bones, wash the meat if absolutely 
iiecessary (too much washing injures the flavor), and put all 
together in the soup kettle without salt. Let the water come to 
the boiling point, skim, set back and let simmer gently five hours. 
Keep closely covered and skim frequently. Eapid boUing hardens 
the fiber of the meat and the savory flavor escapes with the steam. 
Add a little pepper, strain into a stone jar and when cool remove 
every particle of fat. Never use tin or iron utensils for putting 
away soup-stock, but strain through a sieve, gauze wire strainer or 
a napkin laid in a colander, into an earthenware vessel or jar. A 
porcelain-lined kettle, with a closely fittting lid is preferable for all 
soups. More than one variety • of meat adds to the flavor of the 
stock-broth. Mutton and beef, or a kiiuckle of veal may be ad- 
vantageously combined. Veal alone makes the colorless stock used 
for the more elaborate soups, to which calves' feet, or even tough 
fowl will be found to give an added consistency, without height- 
ening the color. 

The soup will be clear as possible, and, seasonings and vege- 
tables having been omitted, the fat can be clarified for use by melt- 
ing over the fire until all water is extracted, when it may be poured 
into a jar kept for the purpose. Fat prepared in this manner will 
be better for almost all cooking purposes than lard. 

This stock will keep many days in cold ;«yeather, and from it 
can be made many varieties of soup. It wiU be found serviceable, 
also in the preparation of gravies and stews. If desirable to have 
the stock richer let the simmering process continue more than five 
hours. 

To prepare soup from this stock, cut off a slice of - the oleai 
jelly in the stock jar, add water, heat, season and serve as a plain 
broth. Additioaal ingredients, such as rice, barley, tapioca oi 
vegetables, may be cooked before being added. Too much boiling 
injures the flavor of the stock. 

The "true inwardness" of soup-stock, however, will never be

fragments of the refrigerator for this purpose. Trimmings from

of fowls, the thin ends of raw porter-house steak, anything

beer, daintily put away and are free from the suspicion of musti- 
ness. 

Weigh the pieces and add quart for pound of cold water — 
always cold, because cold draws out the juices of tlie meat, and 
hCd seals them up. Simmer four hours, skimming frequently. 
Strain into the soup jar. When cold remove fat and use as di- 
rected for first soup stock. 

An excellent soup for a small family can be made from the bones 
and trimmings of steaks and roasts that are often cut and thrown 
away by the butcher. If soup is accidentally over-salted this may 
be remedied by a teaspoonful of vinegar and the same amount of 
sugar. 

SOUP PLaAVORIMG. 

Curry Powder. — Mix l ounce of ginger, 1 ounce of mustard, 
1 ounce of pepper, 3 ounces of coriander seed, 3 ounces of tumeric, 
^ ounce of Cayenne pepper, ^ ounce cardamons, | ounce cummin 
seed, J ounce of cinnamon. Have these ingredients well powdered; 
sift together and keep in a tightly-corked bottle. A sprinkling of 
this will be found a great improvement to soups and some stews 
and gravies. 

Soup Herb Spirit. — Take equal parts of thyme, sweet marjo- 
ram, sweet basil, summer savory, parsley and celery seed, gathered 
in their prime ; fill a wide-mouthed bottle loosely with the fresh 
leaves; fill with good vinegar and cork closely. In three or four 
days pour the^vinegar into another bottle and cork. This, for those 
who like a variety of herbs in soup, will be very convenient and far 
nicer for use than the same herbs in a pulverized state, though 
these can be used in the form of a powder. 

Parsley or celery, can be dried in a slow oven, the stems of 
parsley picked out and the leaves bottled closely for use— the stalks 
and roo|;s of celery grated and bottled. A small bunch of the 
fresh parsley or two tablespoohfuls of the dry will sir**' 5 for four 
quarts of soup. 

Rolled Oatmeal is nearly, if not quite, as nice iu soup as 
rice, 

Walnut, mushroom tind tomato catsups, celery and other, 
vinegars will be found in their especial departments, and may be 
added to suit the taste of inclividuals. 



SOUP. 21 

Gumbo Filee, or Fela, is prepared from sassafras leaves dried 
and powdered. (The addition of a few pulverized bay leaves is an 
improvement.) This gumbo for Gumbo Eilee is indispensable. 
A tablespoonful is often an addition to the commoner broths. 

" Bay leaf for flavoring," says one epicure, "is among soups 
and meats what the vaniUa is among the sweets. Skillful use of 
this gives an unmistakable flavor of French cookery to domestic 
viands. " One large bay leaf wiU flavor two gallons of soup, and 
only a small piece is wanted for a family dinner. 

Celery Seed can be used for soups where the celery stalks 
are not at hand. 

SOUP GOLaORIKG. 

Brandy Colored. — A tablespoonful of burnt sugar dissolved 
in a little water will make a clear soup the color of brandy or very 
strong tea. To make this caramel for coloring, burn in a dry 
saucepan over the fire, stirring constantly until scorched. 

Brown. — This may be obtained by enriching the soup-stock 
with a piece of veal or veal bones roasted brown, and using 
browned flour for thickening. This will give a rich color. The 
flour may be browned in a dry saucepan over the fire, stirring 
quickly until a deep shade is obtained. 

Green. — Bruised spinach, the green leaves of celery, or 
pounded green peas will give a green color to spup. 

Red. — Eipe tomatoes ; or, lobster coral, wiU color soup red. 

White. — Cream may be added, use white vegetables with rice 
or pearl barley. A teaspoonful of com starch for thickening does 
not injure the clearness. 

To Clarify. — Soup may be still farther clarified by removing 
fat from stock and boiling slowly with the whites of one or two 
eggs, according to the quantity of broth. The egg and the sedi- 
ment wjll rise and may be carefully gkimmed from the top. 

SOUF» PILaLaING. 

Quenelles or Egg Balls.— The yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, 
half as much boiled potato, while hot; 1 teaspoonful of chopped 
parsley; Cayenne and salt to taste; the yolk of 1 egg raw. M^sh

all together, make in balls size of cherries, flouring the hands. 
Put in the soup just before taking from the fire. 

Crontons or Fried Crusts.— Cut cold bread in any shape 
desired — dice, squares, leaves or circles; fry light brown in melted 
butter; one minute will sufiBce. One or two at a time can be fried 
in the smallest deep saucepan, and but little butter wiU be re- 
quired. (Hot lard may be used or any other hotl fat.) Drain 
them on paper. The hotter the fat the less danger of their soak- 
ing grease. These may also be used for garnishing. 

Forcemeat Balls, No. 1.— Half a calf's tongue, or same 
amount of cold veal; ^ as much fine bread crumbs; 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter; 1 raw egg; seasoning of sweet herbs; pepper, 
salt and a dash of curry powder. Mince the meat fine, add the 
other ingredients, make up in small balls about the size of half an 
egg, flouring the hands slightly. Flour, fry brown in hot fat, and 
put in the soup. 

Forcemeat Balls, No. 2.— Chop any kind of cold meat or 
fowl fine; add a little butter or a bit of raw salt pork minced; 
season well with salt and pepper; a pinch of curry powder is an 
improvement. Mix together with an egg; form into balls; flour 
and fry brown ; put them in the soup just before serving. Either 
of these Forcemeat BaUs can be used for garnishing meats or fish ; 
or, when fried, make an attractive entree or side dish. 

Egg Dumplings, No. 1. — 1 heaping cup of flour; 2 yolks, 
or, 1 whole egg; 4 tablespoonfuls of water. Put the flour in a 
bowl; mix the egg with the water and salt, stir into the flour, 
tnaking a stiff dough. EoU rather thin, cut with a cake cutter; 
drop into either water, gravy or soup. Keep the lid on and boil 
ten minutes. 

E^ Dumplings, No. 2.— 1 pint of milk; 2 eggs well beaten; 
a pinch of salt and flour enough to make a batter thick as pound 
cake. Drop them by spoonfuls into soup. Cook five minutes, 
remove to a dish, put bits of butter and pepper over and serve 
with the meat. They can be cooked in boiling water and served 
with cold meat in the same manner. 

Dumplings for Soup. — 1 quart of flour; 2 teaspoonfils of 
cream tartar, 1 of soda; pinch of salt; mUk sufficient to wet the 
flour. Drop by spoonfuls >to '^ ' " oup, and boil half an hour. 



SOUP. 23 

German Soup Ealls. — 1 heaping teaspoonful fresh butter; 2 
eggs well beaten ; salt, nutmeg or ginger; cracker crumbs sufficient 
to form balls. 

Noodles. —Take 1 egg and a pinch of salt; use all the 
flour that this will take up. Boll thinly as possible and dry, then 
roll XTp and slice off in narrow strips. Drop into ' boiling soup 
fifteen minutes before serving. Chicken with noodles makes a 
pice (?Vi^, For noodles as a side dish, see page 25. 

MRRT SOUPS.-VkaIv. 

TtiOck Turtle Soup. — One calf's head, cleaned aceordiijg to 
directions given below; hock of a ham or a few slices of bacon; 
1 calf's brain; 3 onions, a turnip and a potato; 2 calf's feet; 1 
lemon, Cayenne pepper, mace, sweet marjoram and parsley for sea- 
soning; soup herb spirit or powder can be used instead of the 
above herbs. Put the head and other meat into one gallon of 
water, or enough to cover well. The ham or bacon will flavor the 
soup, at the same time supplying sufficient salt. Boil slowly four 
hours, skimming carefully until no more scum will rise. Eemove 
the head and set away until next day, when the fat may be skimmed 
off, and the smaller pieces of meat removed from the bones, cut 
3 ito dice and thrown in to, the kettle, reserving the more present- 
able parts of the head for a dainty side dish. (See below.) Chop 
the brains, cut the vegetables in thin slices, and add all to the soup, 
together with the seasoning. Thicken with two tablespoonfuls of 
browned flour. Stew gently for 1 hour. Squeeze in the juice of 
half a lemon when it boils up; skim, if necessary. Add Force- 
jneat Balls, No. 1, made of the veal, and Quenelles (see page 22), 
"VVhcn quite done add half a lemon sliced thin. Let it boil up once 
and serve immediately. 

To Clean Calf s Head and Feet.— Drop the head and feet 
into a tub of scalding, not boiling water, with a little lye or sal- 
soda in it to loosen the hair. Stir them about and then scrape 
with a sharp knife. This methed is far better than 'to remove the 
gelatinous skin. The hoofs may be heated in the coals and pryed off.

and salt, roll in beaten egg, then in powdered cracker, and fry in 
hot dripping. 

Consomme with Custards. — Boil 2 shanks of veal in 1 
gallon of water. While boiling add the usual vegetables, turnip, 
oarrot, onion and seasoning, together with a stalk of celery, half 
a' bay leaf, a teaspoonful of bruised pepper-corns and 1 of thyme 
and sweet marjoram. These seasonings, of course, can be altered to 
suit the taste. When done strain through a napkin into another 
vessel; clarify (see page 21), remove every particle of fat, and color 
with a teaspoonful of caramel or dissolved burnt sugar (see page 21). 
Or let the soup stock cool in a jar, remove the fat and pour it off 
without disturbing the sediment and heat; coloring as before. 

CusTAEDs FOB THE Soup. — Stir the raw yolks of four eggs 
with a spoonful or two of the Consomme, pour in a buttered dish 
and steam ten minutes. Cut the custard in diamonds or squares 
and drop three or four in each soup plate before serving. Or egg 
dumplings (see page 22) may be boiled in the soup a few minutes 
before serving and make an admirable substitute. The veal shanks 
may be made into veal loaf or veal cheese. 

Veal Soup — Plain. — A leg of veal, after the cutlets have 
been all removed, will make a soup nearly as good as calf's head. 
Boil it with a cup two-thirds full of rice (a small piece of salt 
pork improves the flavor for many), season with salt and pepper, 
parsley and celery are an improvement. Forcemeat Balls, No. 2 
(see page 22), made of the chopped veal and raw salt pork maybe 
added before serving. The veal should be taken up before the 
soup is seasoned. Just before the soup is served put in a couple 
of slices of toast. The shoulder of veal also makes a good 
soup. 

Veal Soup with Tapioca.— Three pounds of neck or scrag of 
veal, the bones broken and the meat cut small; 1 turnip, 1 onion, 
J cup pearl tapioca, 2 Uades of mace, 2 teaspoonfuls of salt and 
^ spoonful of pepper, 2 teaspoonfuls of celery essence or, 1 stalk 
of green celery, 3 quarts of cold water. Put over the meat and as 
soon as the water boils skim carefully. Then add the vegetables, 
salt and pepper. Meanwhile soak the tapioca in one small cup of 
milk. To make the soup extra nice, strain, skim ofE every particle 
cif fat and return to the fire bef one adding the tapioca. Stir this 



SOUP. 25 

until it dissolves in the hot soup. Simmer half an hour, add the 
celery essence and serve. 

Beef 8onp> — l pound of beef, 2 quarts of water, 1 cup of rice 
or pearl barley. Put in a soup pot. Boil slowly for two hours. 
In another vessel have a good soup hope, together with 1 onion, 
1 potato, J- carrot, 1 turnip and a little parsley. BoU with the 
meat. When ready to serve strain the soup off the bones and 
vegetables into the other vessel. Take 2 eggs, beat well in the, 
sotp tureen, stir the soup and add gradually, and the eggs will not 
curdle. This will be found a good as well as a cheap soup. 

Noodle Soup. — Put soup-bone in a kettle half full of water. 

Bait and let boil. Pare and slice 2 small potatoes, 1 turnip, 1 

onion, 1 parsnip, and add to the soup. Season with pepper and a

1 pound of bone, 2J quarts of water, 1 ounce of salt, 2 carrots, 2 
onions, 2 cloves, 3 leeks, ^ head of celery, 1 turnip, ^ parsnip. 
Simmer. Strain and serve clear. 

Bouillon (Beef Tea). — Bouillon is served now almost as a 
necessity for the first course at tea or evening parties. Serve in 
large coffee cups, or tea cups, with saucers and teaspoons. Some- 
times in Summer it is iced, otherwise serve hot. By some' the 
saucer is omitted. This, with fancy sandwiches, is often sufiScieiit 
refreshment for an informal evening party. One can of Liebig's 
extract of beef, mixed with 3 quarts boiling water and salted to 
taste, is the easiest method. Let it boil up, pepper slightly, and 
the soup is ready for use. Or, on the tnoming of the day before the ■' 
party, boil 4 pounds of the lean, cheap parts of beef, and proceed, 
as directed for making soup stock. When wanted remove ihe fat, 
season to taste, heat and serve as above.

turnips or heads of cauliflowers and rub or mash fine. Pound the 
meat fine and rub through a sieve to a powder, and return meat 
and cauliflower to the soup, together with 2 eggs beaten into | pint 
of milk. Let this reach the boiling point (but not boil), and serve 
hot. 

White Habbit Soup. — 2 rabbits, disjointed, 1 heaid celery, a 
little chopped parsley, a minced onion. Put these into 3 quarts of 
water, and boil gently until tender. Take out the best pieces of 
rabbit for a separate dish. Separate the rest of the meat from the 
bones, replace the bones in the kettle and boil an hour; strain the 
liquid in which they have boiled and let it cool. Eub the meat 
fine with the yolks of 3 hard-boiled eggs, and a few bread or 
cracker crumbs ; put through a sieve and add to the soup ; add 
salt and pepper to taste; let it simmer fifteen minutes, thickening

of flour, rubbed smooth in a teacup of milk. Season with salt, 
pepper and parsley or celery; add slice of bread just before the 
soup is served. If too rich, skim before adding the compound. 
Serve the chicken (which may or may not have been stuffed before 
boiling) with a gravy made from the soup and thickened slightly 
with flour, to which the chopped giblets may be added. 

Chicken Bean Soup. — Cut up tlie chicken, and put in as 
much water as is wanted for your soup. Soak 1 teacup of beans 
over night. Next morning cook them in a separate vessel. Put 
a lump of soda the size of a pea in the water, and when the beans 
are tender, drain them ca,refully and put them to btfil with the 
chicken. Season with salt and pepper and boil slowly until done.

furnished by okra; of the latter, by a preparation of dried sassafras 
leaves, with a small quantity of pulverized bay leaves. 

An excellent way to utilize the remains of cold roasted chicken, 
turkey, game and other meats is in preparations or the gumbos. 
Oysters, crabs or shrimps may be added, and green com, tomatoes, 
etc. Below we give several methods of compounding this dish. 
The gumbos occupy the medium ground between stews and soups. 

Southern Gumbo Soup.--l large chicken, li pints of green 
okra pods, three pints of water, 1 small teaspoonful of pepper 
and 2 of salt; cut the chicken in small pieces, roU in flour and fry 
brown in a little lard or butter. Take out the chicken, add the 
gumbo (sliced okra pods) and brown that. There should be 
about one table-spoonful of fat in the pan; add to this a heaping 
table-spoonful of flour and stir until brown ; then add three pints 
of water slowly, stirring until smooth. Put in the meat of the 
chicken and simmer slowly for two hours. Serve with boiled rice. 

OnmlbO Filee.— Cut up and season the chicken, meat or 
game to make the soup ; fry to a light brown with 1 onion cut fine, 
add boiling water in proportion to the meat. 2 pounds of 
meat or chicken, with ^ pound of ham or bacon will flavor a 
gallon of soup, which, when boiled down will malce gumbo for 
six persons. When the bpiling water is added to the meat let it 
simmer two hours. To this amount add one tablespoonful of the 
Jilee, or, if okTa is used, take 1 quart of the sliced pods. 

Oysters wUl be found a great improvement. Scald and clarify 
their liquid; season to taste; pour into the soup and let boil fifteen 
minutes; add the oysters last and let it boil up once. Green corn 
and tomatoes are agreeable additions. Gumbo is always served 
with plain boiled rice. Never strain it. (See rule given for Gumbo 
FUee page 21). 

PISH. 

Oyster Soup, No. 1. — To l quart of oysters with their juice 
put 2 quarts of cold water, 1 pint of mUk, 1 heaping teaspoonful 
of salt, and let them boil one minute. Skim out the oysters, add 
half a teacup of crackers rolled fine, half a teacup of butter and a 
little pepper; let this boil up and pour over the oysters. It is some- 



SOUP. 29 

times better to heat tlie milk separately, not pouring together until 
both milk and water are boiling hot; this will prevent curdling i 
the milk is at aU doubtful. 

For persons preferring the oysters without milk the same 
method may be followed, adding water in place of milk, and using 
a larger quantity of butter. Walnut catsup (see page 126), or 
plain vinegar may be added by those who like it. 

Oyster Soup, No. 2. — 6 dozen oysters, 2 quarts of white 
stock, 1 cup of cream or rich milk, 2 tablespoonfuls of butter, 1| 
tablespoonfuls of flour, salt, Cayenne and black pepper to taste. 
Scald the oysters in their own liquor, then skim them out; add 
the stock to the oyster liquid carefully strained and simmer for half 
an hour. Add the seasoning, and mace if used, bring it to a boil 
again ; add the thickening of butter and flour, rubbed smooth ; 
simmer five minutes ; have the cream heated in a separate vessel 
and pour it in. boiling hot and turn at once over the oysters. Serve 
with sliced lemon and oyster crackers. 

(For Stews see Shell Pish.) 

Clam Soup. — 50 clams, hard or spft, boiled in a quart of 
water one hour. Take out and chop fine. Add to the clam broth 
1 qtiart of hot milk, ^ teaspoonful of pepper and 1 of salt. It 
will be necessary to taste, as some clams require less salt- than ' 
others. Eub 1 teaspoonful of butter to 1 of cream, with 2 of flour ; 
add the broth until it pours easily, and mix with the milk and 
chopped clams ; boiling all together for five minutes. The soup 
may be strained if the clams are disliked. Serve with toasted 
crackers. 

Lobster Soup. — 1 whole lobster, 2 pounds in weight, or 1 
can preserved. 1 quan of milk, 1 pint of boiling water, 2 table- 
spoonfuls butter, 1^ teaspoonfuls salt, 2 tablespoonfuls com starch, 
^ teaspoonful of mace, if liked, some Cayenne pepper. Put the 
milk over to heat, (a double boiler is nicest, or a; stew pan set in 
boiling water). Dissolve the corn starch in a little cold water, and 
add to the boiling milk. If the lobster is fresh, pick the meat from 
the shell and cut in bits, place in a pint of water and boil five 
minutes, adding the butter and seasoning. Tiuu tiiio ialj tab

to it a quart of boiling milk and 4 tablespoonfuls of butter cut in 
bits and rolled in flour. Stir in the beaten yolks of 4 eggs, boil 
quickly and serve while hot. The ham maybe omitted, and the 
soup seasoned with salt. Other small fish may be cooked in the 
same manner. 

Meat Vegetable Soup. — Boil a knuckle of veal, or a shank of 
beef in sufficient water to cover it, salt and skim carefully. Let it 
eook slowly between two and three hours, add hot water if neces- 
sary for sufficient quantity of soup. Shred or chop fine ^ a small 
head of cabbage, 2 potatoes sliced thin, 1 turnip out in dice, 1 
onion sliced, 1 carrot chopped fine, and 1 head of celery sliced. 
All or any of these may be used. In the proper season the soup 
may be greatly improved by the addition of from 8 to 6 ears of 
green corn cut fio;ii the cob, or a can of corn, (the canned com

many. Boil one hour, skim occasionally. Add the vegetables cut 
in small squares, the onion sliced; boil an hour longer, thinning 
with hot water if necessary. Place small slices of stale bread in 
the tureen, pour the soup over and serve. 

Potato Soup (with milk. A Farmer's Dish)— Take good 
sound potatoes, peel and cut in pieces small enough to be eaten 
with a spoon. Soak in cold water, or rinse well. Boil in su£S.cient

good sized piece of beef, the cheaper portions will answer, cover 
with cold water, skimming at intervals. In the meantime have 1 
quart of beans previously soaked over night, put these also in cold 
water to which 1 large half teaspoonful of soda has been added, 
let them boil until they commence to soften, and then skim from 
the soda water into the boiling soup. When nearly done mix J pint 
of com meal smooth with cold water and stir in, adding 2 red- 
pepper pods, season with salt to taste. Serve with soda crackers. 
This dish improves with age, and should be made in cold weather. 
Keep plenty of boiling 'water on the stove to supply the loss by 
, boiling. ^ When done it should be the consistency of ordinary 
bean-soup. 

Bean Soup (without meat.) — A simple and delicious soup 
may be made by soaking one pint of beans over night. In the 
morning parboil in soda water as above. Cook in 3 quarts of 
water until very soft and broken. Season slightly with salt, pepper 
and a generous piece of butter. Serve with crackers. 

Bean and Corn Soup. — 1 pound of lean beef, cut in small 
pieces; ^ pound of salt pork; 1 quart of dried beans soaked over

night; 1 onion sliced, 1 teaspoonful of celery salt, 1 of pepper, 2 of 
salt, a little parsley, 1 tablespoonful of butter, 1 tablespoonful of 
sugar, 1 can of com, or the same amount of green com; 5 quarts of 
water. Put everything in the water but the com, and boil slowly 
for two hours. One hour before using, stew the com slowly in a 
separate sauce-pan adding' the butter and a little salt. Strain the 
soup through a colander rubbing the beans to a pulp. Place again 
over the fire and add the com; boil all together a minute and 
serve with ^toasted crackers. This soup may be made without 
straining. 

Tomato and Bean Soap. — Make bean soup according to the 
above recipe, substituting in place of the com a can of tomatoes, or 
the same amount of fresh tomatoes. Half an hour before using 
put the tomatoes over with 1 cup of boihng water and the season- 
ing and stew to a pulp, rub them through a sieve and add to the 
soup. Put crontons (see page 22) in the tureen and pour the soup 
over them. 

Tomj>.to Sonp (with milk.) — 2 large cups of tomatoes chopped 
fine, boU in 1 quart of water, for twenty minutes, add a bit of soda 
as large as a pea, stir, turn in 1 pint of sweet mUk, season with 
salt and pepper, also a good sized piece of butter. Thicken with three 
Boston crackers rolled fine, let boU up and serve. 

Tomato Sonp (without milk.) — 12 fresh tomatoes, or 1 large 
can; 1 quart boiling water, 1 onion, 1 carrot, J turnip, stalk of 
celery, or parsley. Cut all fine and boU one hour. Season with an 
even tablespoonful each of salt and sugar. As the water boils 
away add more that the quantity,.,may remain the same; mix a 
tablespoonful of butter with 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of flour 
and add hot soup until it will pour easily. Turn into the soup; 
boU all together for five minutes. 

Pea Soup (with meat — cheap and excellent) — A marrow bone, 
er the bones of cold roast beef. 2 or 3 pints of split peas, accord- 
ing to required thickness ; 2 carrots, 2 turnips, 3 onions, 1 stalk 
of celery, thyme or parsley, whole black pepper. Break the bones 
and put them in the kettle with 4 quarts of cold water. Add 
the peas, previously soaked over night in warm water, and the 
sliced vegetables. Let them boil for two hours stirring frequently

to prevertt burning. When the peas are soft and broken tne soup 
may be taken off, if wished, and put through a sieve into another 
kettle, stir until the pulp is thoroughly mixed with the soup, salt to 
the taste. A slice of ham may be added to soup if the flavor is 
liked. Serve with toasted bread cut in squares or crontons (see 
page 22). Green peas for soup need no soaking. Peas require 
care in cooking as they become tough and hard if overdone. 

Vegetable Ham Bone Soup. — Should the ham be a little 
strong, boil the ham bone, which should have a little meat with it, 
in plenty of water for five or more minutes ; then pour it off and 
add enough fresh water to freely cover it. This should be cooked 
gently, tasted and seasoned. Cut a potato fine and boil with it. 
Other potatoes can be added, cut into pieces, before the soup is 
done. Just before serving, pour in enoiigh milk to make it palata- 
ble, and thicken to taste. The soup should be free from fat. The 
water in which whole hams are cooked, if the ham is sweet, can 
also be used for soup. All the fat should be removed and vegeta- 
bles, seasoning and thickening added to taste. 

The water in which salted beef and cabbage are boiled is often 
used for soup when the beef is not very salt. 

Prepare in precisely the same manner as for Ham Bone Soup. 
One egg beaten, stirred stiff with flour, and dropped into the soup 
in bits is an improvement. 

Cream Vegetable Soup.— 

2 turnips, cut in dice. 

3 onions, sliced. 

4 potatoes, chopped. 

1 pint of cabbage, shredded. 

6 ears of corn, cut from the ear. 

Or equal amount of canned corn may be used. 
Cover the ingredients with water, and stew until quite tender. 
Then turn in boiling water sufficient for the amount of soup de- 
flired. Do this twenty minutes before serving Add: 

1 pint of milk, thickened with 

1 tablespoonful floor. 

1 tablespoonful butter. 

2 eggs, well beatea.

PRRSH, 8AL.T AND SHRUIa. 

BISH for the table should be selected with care. Follow the 
rules given in the chapter devoted to Mabketing. 
Fish should be dressed as soon as possible after they 
are caught, washed thoroughly in cold water, and salt rubbed on 
the inside. This will remove any earthy or muddy flavor. If tc 
be broiled sprinkle pepper on the inside, as salt will prevent their 
browning nicely. The flesh of fish is apt to become flabby il 
soaked in water too long. 

Fish freshly caught are always improved by keeping until the 
next day before cooking. If procured in the market they should 
be used the day they are purchased. 

Fbesh Mackebei. become stale in a very short time after being 
caught. 

Blue Fish spoil sooner than any other fish. 

Fish EoE or eggs, should be carefully preserved and cooked 
with -the fish. 

Frozen Fish should be put in cold water to draw out the frost. 

ViNEGAK is better to preserve fish than salt. Cover the fish 
with it. 

Fish to be boiled should be either sewed or tied up carefully 
in thin muslin, or cooked in a regular fish kettle, otherwise it will 
be almost impossible to serve without brea,king. 

Laed is usually preferable to butter in frying fish. Some use 
lard and butter in equal quantities. 

Fish can be improved in flavor by rubbing with vmegjar, or 
adding J cup of vinegar to the water in whiph they are boUed. 

Codfish, or other dry salt fish can be easily shredd«d by 
using a steel fork.

Fish, when prepared for the table should never be laid double, 
if it can be avoided, as the steam from the under layer makes the 
upper layer so soft as to break easily when being served. Fish 
should be served alone immediately after soup with potatoes. Care 
and punctuality are necessary in cooking fish. To be underdone 
or overdone is equally injurious to the viand; alT?.^- serve as soon 
as cooked.

FRB.SH FISH. 

Boiling Fish. — All fresh fish, except salmon, should be placed 
in salted cold water for boiling. If placed in boUing water the 
outside would eook much sooner than the inside. A little vinegt: r 
added to the water in which fish is boiled, improves the fl;i- 
vor. Put the fish in the kettle with the backbone down. To 
eight or ten pounds of fish put half a small tea cup of salt. Boil 
the fish gently until you can draw out one of the fins easily. Mont 
varieties of fish will be well done in twenty or thirty minutes, some 
in less time. Drawn butter, with hard boiled eggs sliced. Liv€r 
Sauee, or if preferred Milk Sauce. 

Saace. — Drawn butter, with hard boiled egg sliced. Liver 
Sauee or Milk Sauce. See Sauces for directions. 

Broiling Fish. — When a fish is broiled the bars of the grid- 
iron should be rubbed over with a little butter and the inside of the 
fish pu+- toward the fire. Eemove the backbone by running a knif( 
under it. Do not turn until the fish is almost cooked, then buttei 
the outside, and turn it over. Fish should be broiled slowly. 
The flakes will begin to separate when the fish is done. Season 
before, serving. A wire hinge broiler is the best. 

Frying Fish.— Fish for frying, after being cleaned and 
washed should be rolled in a doth to absorb the moisture. Cut in 
neat pieces, dip in beaten eggs aad roU in flour or corn-meal. For 
every 5 or 6 pounds of fish fry a few shoes of salt pork to the gra- 
vy ttaue, obi^i-iac^ it ».\-^Ma>ii!t3j, judd lard ojr iy»tt«,iw:i.. WiK:eh isa

may be used, but that from the pork gives a better flavor. Brown 
the fish quickly, then cover the pan and setback to steam and cook 
through. 

Plain Gravy. — Remove the fish, rub 2 or 3 teaspopnfuls ot 
flour smooth in a little water, and stir into the fat the fish was 
fried in. Add butter, pepper and salt. If desired, flavor with 
catsup or lemon juice. Pour the gravy around the fish, or serve 
separately. 

To iJako Fisll. — Do not remove head or tail. Stuff. Bew 
or wind a string around the fish. Lay pieces of sliced pork across 
top. Sprinkle with water, pepper, salt and br,ead crumbs. Pour, 
hot water into pan. Baste often while baking. Serve with drawn 
butter sauce. If not frequently basted the fish will be too dry. 

Bread StaffiBg for Fisb.— 

2 cups of bread crumbs. 
1 small cup of minced suet. 
1 small cup of warm water. 
1 egg beaten. 

Season with salt, pepper and thyme or savory. Mix together. 
This stufiing will do for any fish. 

Baked Blue Fish.— Scale and cleanse the fish. Dry with a 
clean cloth, and fill the inside with the above stuffing. Sew up 
and put in a baking pan with a slice of pickled pork, a bit of onion, 
salt and dripping or butter. Pour in enough water to prevent 
bu; 'ting. Bake half or three quarters of an hour, basting frequent- 
ly. Eemove the fish carefully to a platter. Pour enough water in 
the pan for gravy. Season with pepper. 

Bass, Piko and Fickerei. — These large fish are suitable for 
baking. Cleanse and fill with stuffing. Sew the fish up, spread 
thickly with butter, dredge with flour, fry a good sized slice of 
pickled pork quite brown. Add one cup of boiling water, lay the 
fish in this and hake one hour; baste, frequently. Eemove the fish 
when done, add browned flour and butter to the gravy, cook a few 
minutes, then pour around the fish. Garnish with thin slices of 
lemon and sprigs of parsley. Fish may be baked without the 
pork, by using hot dripping or butter.

the shape, an^ boil according to rule given for boiling fish. "When 
done, serve with a sauce and sliced egg, or egg sauce. 

Mackinaw Trout Baked.— Before baking this fish remove 
the head and tail. In your careful preparations put dripping in a 
baking pan, sprinkle with salt, add |- cup of water and a spoonful 
or 2 of vinegar, or, i lemon sliced. Bake the fish half an hour, 
basting frequently. ,The fish by this time is nicely browned; re- 
move it to a platter; pour hot water into the pan, thicken slightly. 
Add lemon juice to taste, and pour under the fish. 

Baked White Fish. — After dressing, split the fish down the 
back and remove the backbone. Wipe the fish and dip in beaten 
egg. This may be applied with a feather. EoU in flour and then 
in egg again. Lay it in a baking pan that has been previously 
heated, add dripping or butter, and bake carefully in a moderate 
oven for 20 minutes. Baste often. If the fish is properly cooked, 
not scorched, it wiU be of a rich yellow-brown. Serve with hot 
fish-sauce. 

Pickerel may be baked in the same way and served with 
green peas. 

Salmon Collared. — Split such a part of the fish as may be 
sufficient to make a handsome roll. Wash and wipe ; mix salt, 
mace and allspice, in a quantity to season very high, rub it inside 
and out. EoU tight and bind in shape with a strip of thin muslin 
and put it, with bay leaves, pepper and salt, into a mixture of two 
thirds water and one third vijiegar, sufficient in quantity to cover 
the roll. Cover closely and simmer until done. Serve cold. 
Boiled fennel makes a pretty garnish, and is preferred by many. 

Boiled Salmon. — Families purchasing a fresh salmon should 
pa.rboU the portion not required for the day's cousumption and lay. 
it aside in the liquor. Boil it in this liquor when wanted. By 
this means the curd will be set and the fish will be equally good as 
at first. The custom of serving up rich sauces is unknown in 
countries where salmon most abound. A little lemon juice, or 
white wine vinegar added to melted butter, being quite sufficient. 

To. Broil. — Cut the salmon in thick slices, dry on a oleafl 
towel, roll in flour and broil carefully. Garnish with boiled fen- 
nel and parsley. Boil the fennel in bunches. 



FISH. 39 

Salmon Steak and Potatoes.— Dredge th^ steak with jjepper 
and salt some time before cooking, brush with melted butter, (this 
may be done with a feather), and broil ten minutes, same as a 
beefsteak. Heat the platter. Have new potatoes ready boiled, 
cut them in quarters and lay a double border around the steak. 
Melt a bit of fresh butter and pour over it hot, also the juice of ^ 
lemon. Garnish the potatoes with sprigs of parsley. 

Salmon Salmi. — Separate the fish in flakes, using either cold, 
boiled or^canned. Add to it an equal amount of lettuce, shredded. 
In winter the heart of a white cabbage may be substituted. Mis 
well and pour over it the following dressing: 

1 egg beaten light; 

2 teaspoonfuls sugar; 

3 tablespoonfuls vinegar; 

1 teaspoonful salt, a dash of pepper; 

2 tablespoonfuls salad oil or melted butter. 

, If preferred, nonpareil or some other cooked sauce may oe used 

Boiled Red Snapper.— This fish is common in the Gulf of 
Mexico and is one of the most delicious for. table use that the wa- 
ters of the sea afford. 

To boil, take a medium sized fish, cleanse and wash' in cold 
water, tie tightly in a clean cloth, cover well with hot water, to . 
which, for a fish of from 5 to 8 pounds, add^ cup of vinegar and a 
handful of salt; boil for forty -five minutes, or until the flesh comes 
readily from the bones. Serve hot with sauce as follows : 1 pint 
of water thickened with flour, let boil until clear; add salt to sea- 
son, a little pepper, 1 tablespoonful of butter, and 2 hard boiled 
eggs sliced. 

Baked Bed Snapper. — Cleanse the fish, and in removing the 
entrails make no longer cut than is necessary. Stuff the fish with 
dressing as follows : Take sufficient stale bread to fill the cavity in 
the head and body, soften with cold water; take 2 tablespoonfuls 
of lard in a sauce-pan, mince a medium sized onion and cook . 
brown in the lard; add to the softened bread. Mix well and season 
with pepper, salt and sweet herbs. Put enough water in the pan 
to prevent scorching and dredge the fish slightly with flour. Serve 
hot. This dressing wiU answer for other fish. \ 



40 THREE MEALS A T)A\ 

Red Snapper and other fish may be baked with a can cf to- 
matoes poured over them in the pan, with very good result. 

Fresh Mackerel.— This fish may be broiled carefulJy, but- 
tering the fish and the bars of the gridiron, or it may be sewed 
closely in a thin cloth and boiled in salted water, if a fish kettle is 
not at hand. Twenty minutes is sufficient for a common sized 
fish. It is always a delicate dish. 

Fillets of Halibut.— 

8 pounds of halibut. 
^ cup of butter. 
1 lemon. 
3 hardTboiled eggs. 

After skinning the fish, bone carefully, cut in slices half an 
inch thick. Cut these into strips three inches long and two wide. 
-Squeeze the juice from the lemon and sprinkle on the strips liber- 
ally. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the whole with a large 
dish and set away for half an hour. Melt the butter, dip the strips 
in it. EoU ihem up and pin each piece with a wooden toothpick; 
dip in the butter once more and place in a baking tin. Dredge 
thickly with flour and bake twenty minutes in a hot oven. Grate 
the yolks of the eggs through a sieve and cut the whites into rings. 
When the fish is done spread the Uttle rolls upon a hot dishj 
remove the skewers, and pour white sauce into the dish. Sprinkle 
the grated yolks over the fish and use the whites, cut in rings, for 
a garnish. Other large fish can be served in the same manner. 

Flaked Fish. — Take half a pound of cold cooked fish nicely 
faked. Make a sauce as follows : Dredge some flour into |- cup 
or hot water placed in a stew pan; add butter the size of an egg, 
1 dessert spoonful each of mixed mustard and anchovy or pepper 
sauce, 1 cupful of cream or rich milk ; put in the flaked fish, heat 
well and serve ; or pour in a' buttered dish, cover thickly with 
breadcrumbs and brown the top in the oven. A desirable way of 
using fragments of fish. 

Boil«d Cod. — Allow fifteen minutes to the pound in boiling. 
Sew the fish in thin muslin unless you have a regular fish boiler. 
Cover with cold water salted; add 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar. 
This will make the fish more flaky. The boiling must be a gentle

simmer, anything more rapid breaking the fish. Use e^g or oyster 
sauce. 

rish Chowder (Daniel Webster's).— Take a cod weighing 10 
or 12 pounds. (Cod is better than haddock.) Have it well cleaned 
by the fishmonger, leaving the skin on. Cut it into slices 
an inch and a half thick, preserving the head, which is the best 
part for chowder. Take a pound and a half of clean, fat salt pork 
and cut it into thin slices. Gut 16 or 18 potatoes into thin 
slices. Take a very large pot, put the pork into the bottom of it 
and fry out all the fat; add to it 3 pints of water. Then put in a 
layer of fish so as to cover as much of the surface of the pot as 
possible. Then a layer of potatoes. Then sift over it 2 table- 
spoonfuls of salt and 1 teaspoonful of pepper and a little flour; 
then the pork, cut in strips ; then another layer of fish and what 
potatoes there may be left. Fill the pot with water until it covers 
the whole. Place it over a good fire and let the phowder boil 
twenty-five minutes. Then have ready 1 quart of boiling milk and 
12 or 14 hard crackers split. Put these all in and let it boil five 
minutes longer. Your chowder will then be ready for the table; 
and an excellent one it will be, if you follow the directions 
implicitly. 

P. S. — A couple of onions may be added where persons have 
a taste for the vegetable. 

Fish Chowder — No. 2. — Fry in a pot some pieces of fat 
pork well seasoned with pepper. When done remove the pork and 
put in 2 onions sliced. Then some fresh cod cut in pieces, or any 
other fresh fish, a layer of Irish potatoes shced, another layer of 
the fish, finish with the remainder of the potatoes. Season eaen 
layer highly with pepper and salt. Pour over this 1 pint of water. 
Let stew half an hour, then add 1 pint of boiling mUk previously 
thickened with flour. Let this boil up and serve hot. 

Fried Eels. — Eels can be found in market ready skinned for 
cooking. Split them lengthwise and remove the bone. Cut the 
strips into three incK lengths; dredge with salt and pepper; dip 
each piece in egg and^then in cracker meal. When the lard is hot, 
drop them in and fry about five minutes- Garnish with parsley 
and serve with potatoes. 



42 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Broiled Eels.— Eels, if very large, are best split open, cut in 
short pieces, seasoned with salt and pepper, and left standing sev- 
eral hours, after which they may be carefully broiled. Butter the 
bars of the gridiron to prevent scorching. 

Baked Eels.— Eels are very tempting, cut in small strips and 
laid in a deep dish with bits of salt pork. Season with salt and 
pepper. Cover well with breadcrumbs and bake half an hour. 

Baked Halibut.— Lay the fish in strong salt and water. 
Wipe dry, score the top, lay in a dripping pan with a cup of Tjoiling 
water poured over it. Allow twelve minutes to a pound for baking. 
Have ready 2 tablespoonfuls of butter dissolved in hot water, 
mingled with the juice of a lemon, and baste often with this mix- 
ture. When a fork penetrates easily, take up, and add to the gravy 
1 teaspoonful of Worcester sauce or catsup, and 1 tablespoonful of 
butter rubbed in 2 tablespoonfuls of browned flour. If too thick 
mix with boiling water. 

Potted Halibut. — Mince cold halibut, removing the bones, 
rub smooth with a wooden spoon. To each cupful of the fish add 
1 teaspoonful melted butter, 1 teaspoonful of lemon juice or vine- 
gar, and a dash of Cayenne. Put the mixture in a dish and 
set in a saucepan of boiling water. (A double boiler is very 
convenient for this purpose.) Heat the fish thoroughly through. 
When nearly cold pack in tumblers, cups or small jars, and cover 
the top with clarified butter (see page 77), or suet, which should be 
poured on warm, but not hot. This is very nice, and will keep 10 
or 12 days in a cool place. To use remove the butter, take out the 
required quantity and slice; if any remain, re-melt the butter or 
suet and pour it back. 

Potted Codfish.- Prepared in the same way as halibut, 
chicken, tongue, ham and mutton, may all be prepared in this 
manner also. 

Broiled Shad.— After dressing remove the backbone, also 
head, tail and fins. Baste on both sides with butter and broil." 
Moisten with butter while broiling. Ten minutes wiU cook a 
moderate-sized fish; fifteen minutes a large one. Season with salt. 
Place on a hot platter and garnish with Saratoga potatoes. For 
sauce, Maitre d'Hotel Butter.

Fish Forcemeat Balls. — Take a little uncooked fish, what- 
ever variety is to be served. Chop it fine with J as much raw salt 
pork. Mix it with a beaten egg, a few bread crumbs, and season ■ 
the whole with pepper, salt, mace and nutmeg. A little catsup 
may be added; flour the hands and make it into small balls, and 
fry in hot dripping to a delicate brown. Serve with fish. 
' Sour Baked Fish (German Style).— Dress the fish nicely. 
Take 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1 tablespopnful butter, 1 onion sliced. 
Mix together and brown in the butter, stirring all the time. Sea- 
son with 1 slice of lemon, 3 bay leaves, salt and pepper to taste. 
Add 1 teaeupful of vinegar weakened with ^ water. Lay the fish 
in the pan , turning it in the dressing. If forcemeat is used, the 
following German preparation will be found excellent. 

Dressing for Baked Fish. — Take stale bread or biscuit equal 
in quantity to a small loaf. Cut in slices, soak in cold water until 
thoroughly moistened. Press dry with the hands. Mix this with 
1 large onion chopped fine, and 5 eggs well beaten. Season with ' 
^ nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful butter, salt and pepper to taste. Stuff 
the fish with this, sew up and bake, basting with the abpve mix- 
ture. 

Potted Fish.— Cut a fish in conveniently sized pieces, rub 
salt on each side, place them in an earthenware crock, sprinkling 
in pepper whole, and other whole spices, allspice, cloves, mace, 
betw;een each layer and cover with good cider vinegar. ' '\Vhen the 
jar is nearly full, tie a paper over and cover this with an earthen- 
ware cover. Bake in a moderate oven between three and four 
hours. This is delicious and will keep two or three weeks, in a cool 
place.

Salt Codfish. — Cover the necessary quantity of fish with cold 
water, and soak over night, a tablespoonful of vinegar may be 
added to the water. In the morning pour off this water and put 
over the fire with fresh water; bring this to the boiling point and 
remove to the back of the stove and let it simmer, not boil, bntil 
noon. Serve on a hot platter, garnish with sliced beets and par- 
ley, or sliced hard-boiled eggs. Spread the fish libera,lly with but-.

ter. Use drawn butter and sprinkle plentifully with blaek pepper; 
or, pour egg sauce over the fish, if preferred. 

Another way : Soak and cook the fish as above, seasoning 
with butter and pepper in the same manner. Just before serving 
pour over all a teacupful of sweet cream. Parsnips are very nice 
to send up with salt cod. 

Fned Salt Cod Fish.— Freshen thoroughly as before, and 
fry daintily in sweet butter. 

Codfish Balls.— Shred cold boiled codfish very fine, add to it 
an equal quantity, (or even more), of mashed potatoes. Moisten 
with 1 beaten egg, or 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of sweet milk. Season 
with pepper and a little butter. Make small flat cakes, flour and 
fry brown in hot dripping or lard. A more delicate dish is made 
by dipping the balls in beaten egg, then in bread crumbs and drop 
in boiling lard fry lite fritters or croquettes. This is a more health- 
ful method as less lard is absorbed. Some cooks add a dash of 
sage or thyme to the seasoning. This is a very nice breakfast 
dish. 

Codfish Stew. — Shred the fish and put to freshen in cold 
water on the back of the stove. Toward the last let the water 
reach boiling point, turn off and pour over the fish boiling milk 
well seasoned with salt pepper and butter. To 1 cupful of the 
shredded fish, 1 quart of milk will be required. Thicken slightly 
with flour. It wiU be found an improvemerit to stir in a well 
beaten egg at the last moment. 

Codfish on Toast. — Prepare the codfish as above (egg exaept- 
ed). Soften dry toast in boiling water, butter, place in a dish an,d 
pour the codfish and milk over it. 

Codfish and Cheese. — Freshen a piece of salt cod over night; 
■shell ready pick to pieces and stir into it 1 cup of milk, boiled 
with 2 tablespoonfuls of cornstarch and 1 tablespoonf ul of butter 
Let it boil and when the fish is thoroughly heated pour the whole 
into a buttered baking dish. Grat« cheese thickly over the top 
and brown in the oven.

and potir over it -|- citp of sweet cream, roll a piece of butter, size of 
an egg, in flour and add to the cream. Let it boil. Serve at once. 
White-fish may be prepared in the same day. 

Fried Salt MackereL-^Soak as directed, drain and place in 
a frying pan with butter. Simmer over a slow fire until well 
heated, when it will be ready to serve. 

Broiled Salt Mackerel.— Freshen over night as direetrd, 
drain it carefully or well in a dry cloth. Butter the bars of tiiC 
gridiron to prevent sticking, and, broil the fish, laying it on tJie 
. broiler, inside down. Turn for an instant before taking up. Serve 
on a hot platter with a liberal supply of butter. Garnish with, 
lemons sliced. 

Baked Salt Mackerel. — Freshen as before, drain, pour boil-_ 
ing water over the fish, let stand a few moments, then turn off, and 
put the fish in a long tin, well buttered. Put over it J cup of sweet 
cream, (rich milk with a little butter will do), pepper and put in a 
hot oven; let it brown slightly and serve, adding more cream if 
more gravy is needed. 

White Pish. — Place in plenty of cold water over night, or 
still better, in a pan of sour milk. Scald slightly when ready for 
cooking, lay on a well-buttered plate with bits of butter over the 
fish, and put it into the oven till the butter melts, after which it is 
ready for use. 

Smoked Salmon. — Soak smoked salmon in. warm water five 
or six hours. When ready to cook place in cold water and bring 
to a boil. When cooked, flake nicely. Have ready 3 hard-boilrd 
eggs chopped, and put with the fish in |- pint of thin cream (ricii 
milk can be used), add two tablespoonfuls of butter rubbed witli a 
teaspoonful of flour; skim and stir the mixture until boiling iiot, 
serve in a plain dish, or make a wall of mashed potatoes around 
the platter to be used and pour into it the fish thus prepared. 

Gamied Salmon Pickled. — Cut the salmon in pieces and 
place in a hot piekle prepared as follows: 1 quart of vinegar (if

Seal the jars securely and set ia a dark place. 

Canned Salmon. — Arrange the fish in as large pieces as pos- 
sible upon the platter, carefully picking out the bones. Ga ^isli 
with lemon and parsley. 

' Deviled Salmon. — This dish may be prepared from eithei 
canned or cold boiled salmon. Arrange fish in neat flakes and 
pour over it the following dressing. This dressing may be used 
for lettuce alone. Dressing — Yolks of 3 hard-boiled eggs, 1 table- 
spoonful of salad oil or melted butter, rub with the eggs to a 
smooth paste; add 2 teaspoonfuls each of sugar and mustard, salt 
and Cayenne to taste, add a little vinegar. Arrange lettuce leaves 
around the plate, pour the dressing over the fish, and garnish with 
the whites of the eggs cut in rings. 

Canned Salmon with Drawn Butter. — 1 can salmon, 1 cup 
drawn butter (see Sauces). Shred the salmon carefully, removing 
the bones. Season with a little pepper. Mix with the drawn 
butter and add the juice of ^ lemon, or 4 teaspoonfuls of good 
vinegar; pour into a buttered pudding dish. Cover ^ inch deep 
with fine breadcrumbs, cover and bake fifteen minutes, then 
uncover and let it brown. This dish may be made with cold 
boiled salmon. Sliced lemon may be served with this. 
Fish Scallop.— 

^ pint cold boiled salt fish. 

^ pint cold mashed potatoes. 

2 boiled onions chopped. 

J teaspoonful pepper. 
Eemove the bones, mince the fish, and season with the pepper. 
Put a layer of the fish in the bottom of a buttered dish. Then

Oysters should be carefully chosen; large, extra and fi.nu- 
fleshed bivalves are as necessary for stews as for fries or roastsj 

Oysters should never be plunged in hot water to increase 
their size, as this can only be done at a great loss in flavor. 

Oysters in the shell raay be kept a fortnight at the very least 
by spreading them upon the cellar floor with the rounding part of 
the shell down and sprinkling them well with salt and Indian meal. 
Cover them with 2 or 3 folds of blanket or old carpeting, and keep 
this well , saturated with cold water. Eepeat the sprinkling with 
meal and salt every day, and see that the covering is thorouglJy 
wet. Oysters kept in this manner will be found in a most satis- 
factory condition. 

Oyster Fritters; see Fritters. Oyster Salad; see Salads. 
Oyster Soup and Oyster Croquettes; also under their especial 
headings. 

Oyster Stew. — Strain the liquid from 1 quart of oysters. 
' Place this with the meats over the fire. Eemove the oysters as 
soon as they begin to boil; add to the liquor 1 pint of hot cream 
(milk will do, but is noit nearly as good), salt, pepper, mace (if 
agreeable) to suit. Skim well; add 2 tablespoonfuls of butter, 
and pour over the oysters. Serve hot with toast or crackers. 

Oysters Stewed with Celery.— Put 1 pint of strong clear 
beef soup-stock in a large stew-pan. Instead of milk use sweet 
cream. Of this cream add 1 pint to the broth in the stew-pan. 
Also 4 tablespoonfuls of the best table butter, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 
1 of white pepper, 1 of ground mace, and 1 of celery extract. If 
celery can be had in the stalk, chop up fine and use instead. No 
more delicate or healthful flavor can be added to any soup, stew or 
broth than this. While this is cooking dredge in finely powdered 
cracker dust and a little of the best corn-starch flour, until thick- 
ened to your taste. Have ready in a hot tureen 50 of the best

oysters parooiled in their own juice. Pour over these the sauce 
compounded as above and serve immediately. 

Fried Oysters.— Take fine, large oysters, drain thoroughly 
upon a soft napkin. Beat lightly 3 fresh eggs, with an equal buli 
of the richest swoet cream . Pulverize the heart of the best white 
breal, pasa the crumbs through a sieve and season slightly with 
salt and white pepper. Dip the oysters one by one in the egg and 
cream mixture, then roll them carefully and thoroughly in the 
breadcrumbs. Lay aside in a cool place, upon a towel, for half 
an hour. Pry in plenty of hot sweet butter, or, better still, the 
best quality of olive oil. No one trying this will ever age in make ~ 
use of. lard for this purpose. Pry to a rich brown. Remove the 
oysters with a skimmer, drain thoroughly and serve on a snow- 
white napkin, garnished with parsley and lemon. The quantity o* 
cream given wiU answer for 1 quart of oysters. 

Fried Oysters, No. 2. — Take the largest and best'oysters, 
drain on a folded napkin, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and let 
remain for twenty minutes. Eoll them one by one in pulverized 
cracker crumbs, then dip in beaten eggs. Season again, and roll 
once more in the cracker meal. Drop in a boihng mixture of lard 
and butter, and remove as soon as browned. Serve with some 
acid sauce. Garnish as above. 

Oysters may also be drained, dipped in seasoned corn meal 
and fried in lard. The oyster liquor may be utilized by stirring 
into a batter, with some of the seasoned com meal and dropped 
by spoonfuls into the hot lard to fry as mock oysters. 

Broiled Oysters. — Seleet the oysters carefully, dry on a nap- 
kin. Take a double wire gridiron, rub thoroughly with the best 
butter. Spread the oysters carefully on one side of the gridiron and 
fold the other down upon them. Have a clear fire, (a little charcoal 
kept in the house wiU enable one always to secure a clear bed of 
coals). Broil quickly, not burning, first on one side and then the 
other, turning but once. Melt a little sweet butter, season it 
slightly with salt and Cayenne pepper. Serve the oysters with 
this. Garnish the dish with olives and parsley, and serve instantly. 
Oysters on Toast — Select a dozen fresh plump oysters. 
Have ready delicately browned toast moistened in hot cream and 



FISH. 49 

well buttered. Put the oysters with their own liquor in a stew- 
pan; season with a little black pepper, J blade of mace, and J tea- 
cup of rich cream. Let this boU until the oysters swell. Eemove 
and place upon the hot toast enriching with bits of fresh butter. 
Rub 1 teaspoonful of butter and 1 teaspoonful of flour together, 
stir this into the boiling oyster liquor. Then pour it over thetoast 
and oysters, which must be kept very hot. For a larger quantity, 
1 quart of oysters and their liquor to one pint of cream or rich 
milk. 

Oysters on Toast. — (Without Milk). — Strain the oyster li- 
quor, rinse the bits of shell from the oysters, turn the liquor back 
upon them, and put in a stew-pan, set them where they will boil up. 
Salt, pepper and butter to your taste. Have ready nicely- browned 
toast, previously moistened in boiling water and well buttered. 
Arrange this in a dish and pour over it the boiling oysters, and 
serve at once. If this gravy is too rich, add a httle water to the 
oyster liquor. Serve walnut catsup or vinegar with them. 

Scalloped Oysters. — Butter an oyster scallop or pudding 
dish. Put in a layer of breadcrumbs with bits of butter, then a 
layer of oysters, season with pepper and salt. Eepeat this until the 
dish is full, leaving a layer of crumbs with bits of butter on the 
top. Mix the oyster liquor with half its bulk in milk or sweet 
cream, a beaten egg added to this will be found an improvement. 
Pour this over the top. Bake twenty minutes. When done, if 
not sufficiently browned, heat a shovel very hot and hold over the 
top until it is a rich brown, or uncover the dish and brown in the 
oven. 

Oyster Shell Scallops may be prepared in the same way aad 
instead of placing in one large dish bake in the shell of the oys- 
ters themselves, taking the round half. The use of the shells 
seems to impart a richer flavor to the oysters. Place the shells in 
a dripping pan, propping them where necessary. Wash them 
thoroughly before using and eat directly from the shell. A clash 
of powdered sweet marjoram improves this dish. 

, Scalloped Oysters with Hard-Boil ed Eggs.— Chop six hard- 
boiled eggs fine. Add these to 1 pint of breadcrumbs. Season 
with ^ teaspoonful of salt and ^ teasp ocmful of white pepper and

mace. Put a layer of this mixture in the bottom of a well but- ■ 
tered pudding dish, then a layer of the best oysters, alternating 
until the dish is full, arranging for a layer of crumbs on the top. 
Take 2 large tablespoonfuls of the best butter. Place bits of but- 
ter over the top. Pour in a little of the oyster liquor and bake in 
a quick oven twenty or thirty minutes. Serve hot. 

Roast Oysters. — Select the desired quantity of oysters. Wash 
t^e shells carefully, arrange them in a dripping pan with the round 
side down. Put them in a hot oven for twenty minutes. The 
shells will be found slightly parted. Remove the round side, and 
siirve on a garnished platter with a bit of butter on each one, a 
dash of Cayenne pepper, and a few drops of lemon juice. Serve 
instantly. 

Steamed Oysters. — Wash shell oysters and lay them in a 
steamer with the upper shell down. Put the steamer over a kettle 
of boiling water. Cover and steam twenty minutes. If at the end 
of this time the shells are open, remove at once and serve on the 
half shell with a pinch of salt and a bit of good butter. Eat as hot 
as possible. 

Oysters Panned. — Put a sufficient quantity of very fine oys- 
ters in a pan together with their own juice. Add one tablespoon- 
ful of the best butter, a little black pepper and a pinch of salt. 
Sprinkle a quantity of fine cracker crumbs over the top. Place 
over a quick fire. When the oysters begin to swell they axe done. 
Serve instantly. 

Fricasseed Oysters.— 

1 quart of oysters. 
I cup of butter. 
1 cup of cream. 

1 egg, well beaten. 

2 tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley. 
Pepper and salt to taste. 

Parboil the oysters in their own liquor, remove from the fiit 
and skim the oysters into a hot +ureen. Put the cream,Jbutter and 
seasoning on the stove, stirring constantly until it thickens, and 
then add the beaten egg. Poiir the mixture over the oysters. 
Cover thickly with breadcrumbs and place in a quick oven to

brown. This fricassee is often served without the final breading 
and baking, in which manner it will be found less troublesome and 
very nice. 

Oyster Pie.— Line a deep dish with nice paste, dredge the 
crust with flour, pour in 1 pint of oysters. Season well wilih but- 
ter, salt and pepper, sprinkling flour over all. Pour on a little of 
the oyster liquor. Cover with a crust. Two hard-boiled eggs 
jchopped coarsely and mixed with the oysters, will be found a de- 
'sirable addition. The eggs and the flour may be omitted and a 
cup of cracker crumbs used instead. ^ teaspoonful of mace is liked 
by some. 

Oyster and Salmon Pie. — Drain the liquid from a can of 
salmon and a can of oysters. Carefully remove aU bits of bones 
or shells. Place the salmon and oysters in a buttered pudding 
dish, in alternaie layers. Season each layer with pepper, salt and 
bits of butter and dredge lightly with flour. Strain thp liquor from 
the oysters and fish, and pour into the dish. Cover the whole 
with a rich pastry crust. Bake in a moderate oven. 

Oyster Patties. — Make tart shells in small patty-pans as for 
fruit tarts, and fill with oysters prepared as follows: Take 1 quart 
of oysters, place in a large baking' dish with butter, pepper and salt 
to taste. Bake until the oysters curl. In the meantime put in a 
saucepan 1 pint of milk. When this scalds, add 1 large teaspoon- 
ful of corn starch moistened with cold milk; let boil, season with 
salt and a tablespoonful of butter. A dash of cayenne improves 
the flavor. The gravy should be quite thick. To this mixture add 
the oysters, but do not let them boil. Spread a napkin over a 
platter. A colored one is pretty. Fill the patty shells and serve 
at once. These patties may be changed by filling the patty-pans 
with raw paste, pouring in the above mixture, covering the top of 
each one thickly with fine bread crumbs, dotting it with bits of 
butter, and baking in the oven until th^ crust is done. Serve in 
the sam^ manner. Milk may be omitted in this last way and the 
oyster liquor simply seasoned highly with salt, pepper and butter, 
thickened with corn stanch, scalded and poured over the oysters, 
and the patties filled as before.

Oyster Omelet.— 

15 oysters. 

4 eggs. 

4 tablespoonfuls of milk. 
Let the oysters boil up once in 2 spoonfuls of milk, seasoned 
with butter and slightly thickened with flour. Beat the eggs with the 
milk that remains, add a pinch of salt. Place a spoonful of melted 
hutter ia a frying-pan, before it is very hot pour the omelet in and let 
it cook slowly. When partly done, loosen the edges with a knife and 
place the oysters in the center of the omelet. Turn the edges to- 
gether to form a half circle. Slip on a dish, smooth side up; gar- 
nish with parsley and lemon. This dish will serve two or three 
persons. 

Oyster Omelet, No. 3.— 

6 large fresh oysters chopped. 



2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

1 tablespoonful of rich soup-stoek. 

Pepper and salt to taste. 
Sprinkle J teaspoonful of salt over the chopped oysters and 
let them stand half an hour in their own liquor. Beat the 
eggs separately, the yolks to a smooth paste, the whites to a 
stiff froth. Add the stock to the yolk, pepper and salt to the 
taste, and then stir the whites in lightly. Put the butter in 
a hot frying-pan, when this is boiling hot, pour in the eggs and 
add the oysters. Do not stir, but with a broad bladed knife, lift, 
as the egg thickens the omelet from the pan to prevent its scorch- 
ing. In six minutes it will be done. Place a hot dish bottom up- 
ward over the omelet and dexterously turn the pan over so that 
the brown side of the omelet may be brought uppermost. Delicious. 
Pickled Oysters.— Drain off the liquor from IQO oysters, 
rinse them, and add to them 1 tablespoonful of salt ajad 1 teaeup- 
ful of vinegar. Let them simmer over the fire ten minutes, skim- 
ming carefully. Then take out the oysters and put to their own 
liquor a tablespoonful of whole black pepper and 1 teaspoonful ef 
mace and cloves. Let it boU five minutes, skim and pour over the 
oysters. 



FISH. 53 

Mock Oysters. — Chicken, veal or turkey can be chopped, 
enough broth or milk added to moisten well, seasoned and prepared 

as stock to use in place of oysters. 

Clam Feittebs. (See Feittebs). 
Clam Soup. (See Soup). 

Clams on Toast- 
Wash the clams and put them in a kettle with just enough 
■pater to prevent scorching. Heat them until the sheila open. 
Remove the clams, being careful to save the liquor, and heat them 
in part of the liquor seasoned with salt, pepper and butter. If 
too strong, put in half as much cream or rich milk. Toast bread 
carefully, moisten in the remainder of the clam liquor, previously 
heated and slightly seasoned for the purpose ; butter liberally and 
pour the clams over this. Before the milk is added it wUl be ne- 
cessary to boil them gently for a half or three quarters of an hour. 
Clam Stew may be prepared in the same manner, using aU of 
the clam liquor and some water. Thicken sUghtly and use a good- 
ly quantity of butter. 
Clam Chowder. — 

1 quart of clams with juiee. 
3 potatoes, sliced. 

2 onions, sliced. 

2 tablespoonfuls pork, chopped fine. 

^ pound of butter. 

Salt, pepper and mace to suit. 

1 teaspoonful of celery seed. 
Pour on boiling water to cover. Boil three hours, add 1 
quart of milk, boil one hour, put in 4 large crackers, powdered. 
Sliced lemon may be served with this. Some chop the clams fine. 
Reviled Clams in the Shell. — To 50 clams chopped fine, 
take two tomatoes, 1 onion chopped, a little parsley, salt and pep- 
per to taste, 1 teacupful of bread-crumbs and enough of the clam 
liquor to moisten the ingredients. Wash the shells carefully, and 
fill with the mixture, rounding slightly. Put a lump of butter in 
each and arrange the shells in a dripping-pan, cover the top of 
each- with crumbs and bake until browned. 

Broiled Clams.— ^Very large long clams may be removed

from the shell, dipped in flour and fried on a well-greased grid- 
iron. 

Fried Clams. — The largest clams may be rolled in bread 
crumbs and fried in fresh hot lard. 

Hot Crab. — Pick the meat out of the crab, clear the shell 
from the head. Put the meat with a little salt, pepper and nut- 
meg and butter, a few bread-crumbs and a little vinegar into the 
shell again Place in the, oven, let it heat through, remove and 
brown by holding a hot shovel over it. 

Lobster Croquettes. (See Croquettes). 

For Lobster Salad (See Salads). 

Lobsters Boiled. — To choose lobster see hints on marketing. 
Put the lobster in boiling water head first, let it boil from half to 
three quarters of an hour according to its size. For every 4 pounds 
of lobster add ^ teacupful of salt to the water. When done and 
cool, crack the shell, break off the claws and remove the meat care- 
fully to the dish upon which it is to be served, extracting all the,' 
blue veins. Serve warm with a sauce, or cold as a relish. 

Lobster Belish. — Take a cold boiled lobster, heat over a 
moderate fire. Prepare a sauce of equal parts of water and vine- 
gar seasoned well with pepper, salt and butter, pour this over the 
lobster, let it boil up and serve immediately. 

Lobster Curry. — ^Lobsters, chickens and pigeons are excellent 
for curries. Fry a slice of pork brown in a sauce-pan, take up 
and add the cooked lobster, picked up nicely. Let it brown, put in 
a little boiling water, (if to be a chicken curry, take the soup in- 
stead). Add 1 teaspoonful of curry powder, and the fried pork, let 
it stew a few minutes. Mix 1 teacupful of boiled rice (hot), with 1 
teaspoonful of curry powder, and turn over the curry. 

Scalloped Lobsters. — Chop the boUed lobster meat fine, sea- 
son highly with pepper, salt, butter and cutsup, put in 1 table- 
spoonful of vinegar, moisten stiU further with milk; heat the mix- 
ture and bake in a buttered dish with bread-crumbs sprinkled over 
the top. 



SEE Marketing -with regard to game. Bead also the direo- 
tions for the preparation of feathered game and the hints 
on Meats. 

Game at some seasons of the year is as cheap %s other meat, 
is easily digested and healthful, hence desirable. 

Game Birds. — Use as little water as possible in dressing game 
birds. It would be well if they could be dressed without wash- 
ing. Draw them; wipe carefully with a dry cloth. 

Veaison should be only wiped. 

Game (the four-footed variety) — ^with beef and mutton, are all 
better a little rare than well done, but this must be regulated ac- 
cording to the taste. There can be no arbitrary rule. 

Game should never be kept any longer than beef or fowl. 
While both of these are better if kept a short time, it is only 
the most pronounced epicures that insist upon the condition termed 
"high." 

Labding, when it can be used to an advantage, renders such 
dry game as venison, grouse, quail and partridge more palatable. 
A sauce also should be served with them. Ducks are so rich that 
this is hardly necessary. 

Cueeant Jelly, melted, is preferred by many as the most ap- 
propriate sauce for venison. It is also used for mutton. 

The teems, "larding" and "basting" will be found explained in 
" Hints on Meats." i 

Haunch or Saddle of Tenison— To Roast.— Wash the 
surface with lukewarm vinegar and water (it should have hung at 
least a week in a cool place) and ^ub with butter to soften it. 
Cover with greased paper tied on ; over this a paste of flour

and water, rolled out at least one-half inch thick, may be spread,, 
and the whole covered with another greased paper fastened se- 
curely. Fifteen minutes to the pound is the ,rule followed ' where 
it is preferred rare. More time is required, according to the size, 
to ha-ie it well done. Pour a pint of boiling water around the 
meat and cover with another dripping-pan. The oven should be 
hot. After the first hour, baste thoroughly at short intervals, re- 
covering the pan after each time. Hu,lf an hour before dinner 
uncover the pan, remove the papers and paste, return to the oven, 
and baste with melted butter and a little lemon juice; dredge flour 
over the whole and let it brown. Eepeat the basting with butter 
two or three times during the half -hour, and take up on a heated 
dish. The plates should be heated also, as venison cools easily. 
Serve with currant jelly and the following sauce. 

Jelly Sauce for Yenlsoii.— Strain the gravy into the pan- 
there should be at least 1 pint. Thicken with 1 tablespoonful of 
browned flour; add 2 tablespoonfuls of currant jelly; 1 table- 
spoonful of lemon juice, if convenient; J teaspoonful of salt; ^ 
teaspoonful pepper. The neck or shoulder of venison may be 
roasted without paper or flour paste. 

Larded TeaisOJi.— This is a very nice dish to serve the day 
after the roast venison. Take whatever may be left of the haunch; 
trim nicely in shape (if it was quite rare the day before so much the 
better now.) Make incisions in the venison and proceed to lard it 
with small strips of fat salt pork. Put in a dripping-pan, pour over 
it the remaining gravy from the day before, using, if none remain, 
a cup of boiling water in which a spoonful of butter has been dis- 
solved, cover the pan and bake one hour in a good oven. "While 
baking, take the trimmings of the haunch, cover with cold water 
and boil down one-half, adding J an onion, and to ^ pint add 1 
tablespoonful of jelly (currant), 1 tablespoonful of tomato caisup. 
Salt and pepper to taste, thicken with browned flour, and bastfe the 
meat with this two or three times. Serve on r. heated dish ; tlie 
gravy should be placed in a separate dish. 

Tenison Pie or Pasty. —Inferior cuts may be used for the 
pasty. Cut the meat in pieces, fat and lean together. Cover the 
bottom and sides of a deep baking dish with a thick rich paste, put 



GAME. 59 

in the meat seasoning with pepper and salt. Prepare a gravy by 
'istewing the bones (well broken) and all the trimmings frorn the 
meat in water enough to cover until the juices are extracted. Strain, 
thicken slightly with flour, season with pepper and salt; pour this 
into the pie. Dot the lop with bits of butter roU9d in flour and 
cover the whole with a crust rolled thick. Leave an opening for 
the escape of steam. Some cooks add elaborate decorations of 
leaves and flowers cut from the paste. It should bake two hours, 
or more if very large. 

Venison Steaks. — Heat the gridiron well, butter the bars and 

, lay on the steaks, which should be cut from the neck or haunch. 

Broil thoroughly ; venison requires more cooking than beef — saving 

all of the gravy possible. Serve with currant jelly laid on each 

piece. Heat the plates. 

Venison steaks may be fried also, and served with a very little 
melted butter and jelly. Two tablespoonfuls of currant jelly 
melted with butter the size of a walnut, is a very nice sauce. 

Venison Stew. — The most inferior cuts will answer. Out the 
meat to cook in small pieces; cover with water and boil two hours, 
adding more boiling water, if ' necessary. Season; thicken the 
gravy with browned flour and serve. 

Venison Hash. — Cut the meat in small pieces. To the gravy 
left from the day before add sufficient boiling water to cover the 
quantity of meat; season With pepper, salt, a few bits of butter 
rolled in flour; put in the sliced meat, let it boil up; stir in a 
couple of tablespoonfuls of currant jelly and serve. 

Venison Rib Boast. — Have the bones removed from 2 or 3 
ribs of venison, roll in a thin sHce of salt pork, tie tightly in 
shape, season, dredge with flour and roast. Serve with spiced cur- 
rants or gooseberry catsup. 

Babbit Boasted. — Skin, clean, lay in salt water while pre- 
paring the following dressing: Mince a slice of fat salt pork and 
mix with sufficient moistened bread- crumbs to fill the cavity, season- 
ing it with pepper, salt and thyme. Some add a little minced onion. 
Stuff the rabbit with this, sew up closely. Cover with thin slices of 
salt pork, bound on with cords or fastened with skewers. Poiir a 
cup of water in the pan and bake an hour, basting frequently, ad-

ding a little lemon juice or vinegar to the drippings. Dredge with 
flour; brown and remove from the oven. Serve on a hot platter, re- 
moving the slices of pork and garnishing the edge of the platter 
with them. Thicken the strained gravy with browned flour and 
season with butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice or a little 
vinegar, pepper and salt to taste. Let it boil up, then serve. If 
pork is not used in roasting, rub the rabbit with butter well before 
putting in the oven, and pour, melted butter over it when served, 
garnishing with sliced lemons and greens. 

Babbit Fried. — Skin, disjoint and wipe the rabbit perfectly 
dry. Fry the same as chicken^ parboiling imless perfectly tender. 
They may be dipped in flour before frying. 

Babbit Pie. — ^Make same as Chicken Pie. (See directions.) 

Babbit Stew. — Prepare same as venison ; boiling until tender 
and serving in the same fashion. Some like a little minced onion 
added to the gravy. Add also a little butter to the gravy if 
necessary. 

Babbits Fricasseed. — Disjoint and put in a stew-pan, sea- 
soning with Cayenne pepper, chopped parsley and a little salt. 
Cover with a pint of hot water and stew slowly. When nearly 
done add some bits of butter rolled in flour. Before removing 
from the fire pour in half a small teacup of thin cream or rich 
. milk. Serve the meat in a hot dish ; pour the gravy over it. 

Squirrel Pot-Pie. — Skin, clean and cut up two squirrels "and 
make the pot-pie after any favored rule for chicken pot-pie. 
,(See Poultry.) ' 

Squirrels— Fricasseed, Stewed or Fried.— Prepare squir- 
rels for these dishes by the rules given for Babbits. Serve with 
currant jam or jelly. 

Opossum Fried.— Dress carefully, parboil, season with salt 
and red pepper. Take up and slice in rather thin slices, dip in 
a batter and fry in lard or opossum fat until done. 

Batter. — 1 egg, 1 cup milk or water, pinch of salt and a 
pinch of soda, flour to make a thin batter. Any of this batter 
that is left may be fried with the meat; serve together. 

Opossum Boasted. — To roast opossum parboil, season with 
salt and pepper, chop the liver fitie, to which add bread-crumbs, J 



GAME. 59 

onion minced, a little parsley; moisten with water and use as force- 
meat. While roasting pour a little hot 'water in with the drippings 
and baste frequently. Serve with gooseberry catsup or spiced cher- 
ries and a gravy made by thinning the liquor in the-pan with boil- 
ing water, if necessary, and thickening with browned flour. Some 
prefer apple sauce to serve with opossum, and it may be gar- 
nished with fried apples in circular slices, or served whole with, a 
roast apple in the mouth, if so liked. The apple stuffing given 
for ducks is very nice to use. For the apple sauce see Poultry. 

Woodchucks or Raccoons. — Either of these animals are 
roasted usually and can be prepared in the same manner as 
opossum, not forgetting to parboil first. The stuffing can be 
omitted, but it is nicer with forcemeat. 

Pemmican. — Venison, buffalo andb6ef, are the meats most in 
favor for the manufacture of pemmican. Carefully separate the lean 
from the fat and dry the lean in the sun. This is called "jerked beef." 
It is cut in thin slices before drying. When dry it is pounded or 
minced and mixed with melted fat and sometimes dried fruit and 
compressed into bags. It contains much nutriineht and is much 
in use by travelers on the plains. Explorers around Hudson Bay 
prepare pemmican by adding sugar to the melted fat and by stir- 
ring in with the meat a goodly quantity of wild berries or cherries. 
This serves instead of jelly. It can be pressed in jars also. It is 
'eaten uncooked, or it may be served like sausage, or prepared in 
the form of a stew. It is very palatable and nutritious. 

Frog on Toast. — The hindquarters or saddle of the frog^ ia 
used for food. After dressing, let it lie in cold water until wanted. 
When ready to cook, first roll in flour, then dip in beaten egg, 
then in rolled crackers and fry six or eight minutes in hot lard. 
Out large square slices of buttered toast across diagonally, arrange 
them down the middle of a large dish with a saddle on each piece, 
and decorate each side of the dish with sliced lemons and parsley.

first like chickens for broiling, then cut in halves, wash and wipe 
dry. Eub each piece with pepper and salt and roll in flour and 
fry slightly in melted butter. Arrange them in a deep baking 
dish, pour in the broth or water and stew in the oven until tender. 
Then season the liquor and thicken slightly, if necessary; cover 
with a good pie crust and bake twenty minutes, leaving an opening 
in the crust for the escape of steam. The crust should be kept 
well out of the liquor while baking. An inverted cup set in the 
emter of the dish will support it. 

Mallard Duck- — Singe, draw, wipe out and stuff. Tie the 
wings and legs down to the side with twine and bake in a hot oven 
from thirty to forty minutes. If the oven is cool it draws the 
juices out too much. It may be allowed to cool somewhat toward 
the last. Baste frequently with fat from the pan. Make force- 
meat as follows : 

1 quart of bread-crumbs. 

1 tablespoonful minced onions. 

1 teaspoonful each of pepper, salt and sage. 

legg- 

1^ enp of warm water. 

2 tablespoonfuls sausage dripping, or butter. 

Mix these ingredients, moistening with the egg and water. It 
will absorb enough gravy in baking to render it moist. 

Pigeons Boasted.— Dress and stuff with bread-crumbs sea- 
soned with butter, salt and a little mace, adding 3 oysters to each 
bird; sew up and baste frequently with melted butter; roast i 
hour carefully. Some prefer the apple stufl&ng. Pigeons to be 
roasted should be tender. Lay them on the dish in a row. 

Pigeons Stewed. — Dress and stuff as above or use a turkey 
dressing; put them in a stew-pan with the breast down; turn in 
more than enough water to cover them; when stewed nearly 
tender put in | cup of butter to every 12 pigeons ; thicken the 
Cravy with 2 or 3 teaspoonfuls of browned flour rubbed smooth in 
a little cold water. If wished brown, take up when tender and fry 
brown in pork dripping. Arrange on a platter and pour the 
gravy over. 

Pigeon Pie. — Prepare the pigeons, cut in 4 pieces and par- 



GAME. 61 

boil; line a baking dish with rich paste and fill in with -the 
pigeons, mixing with bits of bacon or salt pork; season with a 
little parsley and enrich with butter cut in bits; dredge with flour 
and pour in the water they were parboiled in. Cover with the 
paste, leaving an opening for the escape of steam. Bake one hour. 

Qaail on Toast. — Dress carefully, removing the feathers with- 
out scalding. Split down the back, put in salt water for a time, 
then dry, butter carefully, season with pepper and salt and broU on 
a gridiron, turning frequently. When done butter well and serve 
on hot buttered toast, a quail, breast up, on each slice. Serve oEi 
a hot dish. Garnish with currant jelly. 

Quail Pie. — Prepare and cook same as Pigeon Pie. Some 
cooks leave the quail whole and stuff. Use the same stuffing as 
for Eoasted Pigeons. Slices of hard-boiled egg may be added. 

Woodcock Broiled. — Dress, spht down the back and broil op 
a well-buttered gridiron, cooking slowly until" a delicate brown; 
season with salt, pepper and butter. Serve with buttered toast, J 
a bird on each slice. 

Woodcock Baked or Boasted. — Prepare as for Iroiling and 
roast in the oven, basting with butter, or draw and stuff with well 
seasoned bread-crumbs mixed with melted butter and beaten egg. 

Prairie Chickens Baked or Boasted.— Prepare the same as 
I'cr Eoasted Pigeons, omitting the oysters from the stuffing and 
adding chopped parsley and summer savory. Moisten the dressing 
'.vith melted butter and pour a very little water in the dripping-pan; 
b tste with melted butter; cook one hour unless the bird is very 
tough. They may be split open down the back and baked without 
stuffing, same as woodcoek. 

Partridge Pie. — Make the same as Pigeon Pie. Loosen the 
joints, but do not dismember. If desired the top-crust may be 
ornamented same as Venison Pasty. 

Plover and Sn^te. — Dress, wipe carefully, season and lay 
each bird on a slice of toast (buttered). Arrange them in a drip- 
ping-pan, dredge with flour, put in the oven and roast briskly 
thirty minutes, basting frequently with melted butter. Serve. A 
brown gravy is best with this. 

Beed Birds, Bail Birds and Ortolans.— Stuff and roast

same as Pigeons, or broil and serve on toast same as Quail or 
Woodoook. Ten minutes is sufficient to cook them usually. 

Boast Wild Duck. — Parboil with an onion in each to remove 
the fishy fiavor. Use a carrot unless there is to be onion in the 
dressing. Stuff with any of thq dressings used for tame ducks and 
roast until tender, basting at first with melted batter and then with 
the gravy in the pan. Weaken the pan gravy with boiling water, 
thicken with browned flour and stir in 1 tablespoonf ul of currant 
jeUy. Serve separately. 

Soast Wild Turkey. — ^Dress carefully. Make forcemeat of 
bread-crumbs mixed with finely chopped salt pork and seasoned 
with salt, pepper, parsley and 1 tablespoonful of butter melted. 
Iiloisten the whole with milk. Sew up and roast, basting with 
latter and water at first, then with the pan-gravy; at last baste a 
f ;w times with melted butter on account of the dryness of the 
meat. Dredge with flour, let it brown and serve. Weaken the 
pan gravy with hot water, thicken with browned flour and giblets 
(previously boiled). Garnish the edge of platter with link sausage 
roasted in the pan or tiny fried sausages the size of a dollar, alterna- 
ting with parsley. Serve cranberry jelly with it. 

Game Pie. — This may be made of one variety of bird or a 
mixture of grouse, pheasants, quail and partridges. Dress the 
birdsi and cut in pieces. Trim off the necks, lower ribs, etc. 
Put the giblets in 1^ pints of water for 6 birds; let them stew; 
make a good puff paste, line a deep baking dish with this; make a 
forcemeat same as for Wild Turkey. Add to it the chopped gib- 
lets; lay some thin slices of salt pork in the bottom of the dish, 
then a layer of the birds; fill the pie in this manner. Pour in 
the gravy from the giblets while hot, cover with the upper crust, 
which should be i inch thick with an opening for the escape of 
Dtfeam. For a large pie bake three hours; cover with a heavy 
paper if it browns too fast. 

Terrapin. — ^Put the terrapin in boiling water; when perfectly 
lifeless take out and remove the outer skin and nails. Boil in 
salted water until perfectly tender. Then remove shells, sandbag 
and gal^. Cut the meat in small pieces and put in a sauoe-pjui 
(save ail the juices) with butter, pepper (red and black) sali and

the hard-boiled yolk of an egg rubbed smooth. Let it boil up, 
stir in 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of cream and a few bread-crumbs and 
serve on toast. 

Stewed Hare. — Cut in pieces, put in a saucepan, barely cov- 
ering with soup stock or clear broth. Add to this 1 large onion, ' 
chopped, a few blades of ,mace, 1 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce 
and the juice of half a lemon. Season with salt and pepper, cover 
closely and let stew two hours ; if necessary add a little more broth 
before removing from the fire. Arrange the meat in a soup tureen; 
thicken the sauce with a teaspoonful of butter rolled in' browned 
flour; pour into the dish through a sieve. 

Broiled Birds. — SmaU birds are exceedingly nice to broil. 
Pigeons,' partridges and other birds of a like size h^veVa more de- 
licious flavor when prepared in this manner. 1 

Dress; divide the birds in half ; butter the gridiron (a double 
wire gridiron is best) and broil carefully,, so that both sides are a 
delicate brown. Watch that they do not burn. Place on a hot plat- 
ter, put a bit of sweet butter on each piece and serve at once. 
Serve with buttered dry toast. 

Smothered Birds.— Prepare as for broiling. Put in boiling 
water for ten minutes. Eemoye, arrange in a baking-pan and 
season highly with pepper and salt, putting a lump of butter on 
each bird. Pour in the pan a little water, to which has been added 
enough vinegar to give it a shghtly sour taste. Dredge the whole 
slightly with flour; cover with another pan and bake until done.

BOWLS are better if killed the daj before using; and dining 
the winter months, keeping a longer time is an improve- 
ment. 

All kinds of poultry and meat can be oooked quicker by add- 
ing to the water, in which they are boiled, a little- vinegar, or 
piece of lemon; a piece of soda (baking) the size of a pea 
will answer the same purpose. A tainted fowl will loose the bad 
taste, or odor, if cooked in this manner; if not used too freely no 
taste will be acquired. One tablespoonful of vinegar will usually 
prove sufficient. 

A FOWL to be stewed should be dropped in cold water; this 
extracts the juices and renders the' gravy richer. To be boiled 
whole and preserve the juices, it should be put in boiling water. 

A LUMP of charcoal put inside a dressed fowl wUl preserve it 
fresh. Packers would do well to remember this. 

Half a tea oup of riee boiled with chickens makes them look 
white. 

A LITTLE SALT POKE boiled with chickens improv«8 the flavor 
for many. If pork is used no salt is required. 

The giblets of a fowl are the neck, pinions, gizzard, heart and 
liver; to this list some cooks add the head and feet. 

Lard rubbed over a fowl that is prepared for roasting, or thin 
shees of fat pork laid on the upper part, will prevent burning. 

CmcKENs only should be scalded; other fowls and game should 
be picked dry until the feathers are removed except the down. 
Pour boiling water over them ; this wiU swell the fowl when the 
down can be rubbed ofi. Eolling up first in a piece of old blanket 
for ten minutes will help somewhat. The hair may be singed with 
a burning paper.

To TRUSS a fowl is simply to tie or skewer the legs and wings 
down-to the body for convenience in roasting. ^ 

Hen tueiceys should always be used for boiling as the flesh is 
whiter and more delicate. 

To Dress and Cut up Poultry. — After picking and singe- 
ing make an incision at the lower part of the breast bone. Cut off 
the oil bag and remove the entrails, carefully preserving the gib- 
lets. Eemove the gall bag from the liver with great care. Make 
an incision through the thick part and first lining of the gizzard, 
peeling off the fleshy part. Clean the heart and throw all into 
slightly salted water. Cut off the feet at the first joint, cut a slit 
in the neck and take out the wind-pipe and crop ; then wash the 
fowl carefully inside, rinsing in salt water is desirable. 

To cut up a chicken or other fowl after drawing, cut off the 
wings and legs at the joint that unites them to the body. Separate 
the joints of the legs and wings. Extend the iilcision at the lower 
part of the breast bone, then with the left hand hold the breast of 
the chicken, and with the right bend back the rump until the joint 
in the back separates. Cut the piece clear and put in water. 
Separate the back and breast, cutting downward toward the head 
and taking off the breast with the "merry thought" or "wish- 
bone." Cut the neck free from the^ back. The breast may be 
•livided through the center, and each side cut in two or more pieces 
according to the size of the fowl, 

How to Bone Fowls.— Singe and pick a fat young turkey. 
This is the easiest fowl to bone. Then cut through the skin the 
whole length of the back with a sharp-pointed knife. Go on cut- 
ting the meat from the bone on both sides until the hip and wing 
joints are reached. Chop through these, dividing the legs and 
wings from the body. Continue cutting close to the breast bone, 
pulling out the back bone as soon as it is free. Take out the 
entrails, reserving the giblets. On the ridge of the breast bone 
cut carefully to avoid breaking the skin, even leaving a bit of the 
edge of the bone. Afterward bone the first joint of the wihgs and , 
legs, removing the rest. Tuck the meat of these into the body, 
which, when stuffed, must be well rounded. Wash and dry on a 
towel. Spread out flat, outside down and fill with an ordinary

dressing of bre&d-orumbs, together with the chopped giblets; add- 
ing a little cbopped celery. Season with salt, pepper and marjoram, 
or any other swteet herb. Mix with a little melted butter. Draw 
the two sides together and sew with twine, filling out carefully as 
you close the body. A boned fowl is sometimes roasted, but tbe 
better way is to fasten securely in a pudding cloth and boil 2 or 3 
hours in salted broth, to which the bones and rejected joints of 
fowl have been added. Let it cool in this liquor. Kemove and 
press beneath a weight. To serve, take off the cloth, pull out the 
threads and slice carefully. Currant or other jelly cut in squares 
may be put on each slice. 

Boned Fowls with Forcemeat.— Proceed with the chicken 
or turkey as above, making forciemeat that will equal about f of the 
fowl in weight. 

Lean veal is used for the body of the forcemeat; chop fine and 
season with i pound of fat salt pork. Add 1 cupful of bread- 
crumbs, season with pepper and salt and mix with well-beaten eggs 
in the proportion of 1 raw egg to 1 pound of the dressing. Moist- 
en still farther with 1 cupful of broth, (water may be substituted). 
■ Stufi, sew up and boil in the salted broth as before. Cool and 
press as above, slice thinly and arrange on a platter, ornamenting 
each slice with variously colored jellies. 

For a very extra occasion this forcemeat may be composed of 
the meat of 2 chickens for an ordinary sized turkey. Boil the 
chickens. Separate the dark and light meat carefully. Chop both. 
Combine the white ineat with the bread, egg and other ingredients 
as above. Lay the turkey upon the table, skinside down as be- 
fore. Strew half of the dark mincemeat over, then half the white 
forcemeat. Then the rest of the dark m6at, finishing with the re- 
maining white forcemeat. Do up the turkey as directed in the 
preceding rules. When pressed and cooled the slices will be in 
colored layers, thus making a very delicate and ornamental dish. 
Garnish the outer edges of the platter with colored jellies. 

Roast Turkey.— New England Fashion.— Pick, singe to 
free from pin feathers, draw, (see directions), wash and dry. After 
tips dip the turkey two seconds into boiling water, and then two 
seconds into ice water; this makes it very plump in appear-

ance. Gut the neck off close to Hhe \odLy, leave the skin longer, 
draw over and tie, skewer the legs close to the sides after removing 
the first joint. Easten the wings to the sides in the same manner,, 
first ciltting away the pinions (or first joints). Put the giblets to 
boil in a quart of waterj^ Allow one and one fourth hours to. roast a 
turkey weighing 10 pounds. If at all tough boil an hour or more 
before roasting. Some "cooks parboil evert a young turkey before 
bakings A little water ^will, be needed;in the pan. Baste with salt 
and water once, then cover with lumps of butter, and afterward 
baste with the drippings. Some cobkg prefer to lay slices of ba- 
con or fat pork over J^he fowl, fastening them down with small 
skewers. When nearly done, dredge with flour and baste with 
melt'ed butter. Stuff with the following forcemeat. 

Forcemeat for Turkey. — 

3 pints of bread crumbs. 

J pound pf salt pork, chopped. 

Butter size of an egg. 

Salt, pepper, sweet marjoram, savory, or sage. 

2 eggs, well beaten. 

A little chopped celery is an improvement; the eggs may be 
omitted and melted butter used to moisture the dressing. Mix 
thoroughly before using.. Sew up. 

Oyster Dressing. — Oyster sauce is very nice served with the 
fowl, cranberries, also as a matter of course; rich mashed potatoes 
are sometimes used as a dressing. 

Giblet Gravy for Turkey. — Having boiled the giblets, in a 
quart cf water until tender, strain the broth into the dripping- 
pan, having removed the turkey. Take the liver, mash fine and 
return to the gravy, chop heart and gizzE).rd very fine and 
add ; thicken with browned flour, stir and season well. BoU five 
minutes. 

When the turkey is rather small for a dinner, it can be deli- 
ciously pieced out by a few strings of sausage inturned and roasted 
with it. This is called in England, "the alderraan in chains." 

Link sausage makes a very suitable garnish for turkey. ' Pars- 
ley or curled lettuce may be interspersed around the e4ge of the 
platter.

Tnrkey Dressed with Oysters.— ^or a 10 pound tnrkey 

2 pints of bread crumbs. 

^ teacupful of butter, cwt in bits. 

3 tablespoonfuls of hot ^vater. 

1 teaspoonful of powdered thyme. 

Pepper and salt to taste. 

1 quart of oysters, well drained. 

Mix these ingredients thoroughly, except the oysters. Rub 
the turkey well, inside and out, with salt and pepper, then fill with 
a spoonful of the dressing, a few oysters, then dressing, alternat- 
ing with the oysters until stuflFed. Strain the oyster liquor and 
ase to baste the turkey. Cook the giblets in the pan with a very 
httle water and chop them fine. Add sufficient water and browned 
flour for thickening. A fowl of this size will require three hours 
in a moderate oven. Garnish as for roast turkey. Serve with 
Drahberry sauce and vegetables. 

Boiled Turkey.— A turkey for boihng should be prepared as 
for roasting, stufied and carefully tied in a cloth. This will ensure 
the whiteness of the meat. Boiling a cup of rice with it has some- 
Ihing the same effect. A pound of salt pork cooked with it im- 
proves the flavor somewhat. Season the broth rather highly will) 
salt, pepper and sweet maijoram, skim well while boiling. Oystei 
sauce or drawn butter may be served with it. A very nice broth 
may be made of the liquor the turkey is boiled in. Let it remain 
until the next day, remove the fat and serve plain, or prepare after 
some recipe for chicken soup. The turkey should be boiled slowly 
and for a young fowl of about 9 pounds, one hour and a half is 
sufficient. 

Turkey Scallop. — A delicious scallop can be made from the 
fragments of coldS turkey, by chopping fine and placing a layer oi 
bread-crumbs in the bottom of a buttered pudding, dish, tiien a 
layer of turkey, adding any cold dressing that may be left. Have 
ready 3 or 4 hard-boiled eggs, slice and add a few slices to each 
layer of the turkey. Alternate the layers of meat and crumbs, 
adding bits of butter and seasoning to each, and arrange that the 
last layer be of crumbs. Dot bits of butter over the topi Thic

Sliced egg will improve the appearance of the dish. 

Hoast Chicken. — Prepare and stuff the same as for roast tur- 
key- 

EcO'id Chickeo. — Prepare the same as boiled turkey. 

CMcken Fricassee.— Cut the fowl up according to direc- 
tions. "Wash in salt water. Place in cold water enough to cover. 
Stew until the meat is very tender, and the liqour nearly boii.-:d 
out. For 2 chickens, ^ pound of salt pork, cut in thin strips 
Vidll be found an improvement. Bub flour smooth ia cold mill:, 
add this to 1 cupful of milk,^ pour into the gravy, let it boil three 
or four minutes. Season to suit and serve. The milk may be 
omitted, and a sufficient quantity of the liquor that the fowl is 
boiled in, can be left and seasoned and thickened to pour over the 
chicken. When nearly done make and bake the following : 1 pint 
of flour,'! teaspoonful each of salt and good baking powder, and 
1 spoonful of dripping. Eub these ingredients well together and 
stir up with milk or water to a consistency to roll out thin. Cross 
It off in four inch squares with a knife and bake half an hour to a 
good. color. When done break it up in the squares marked (it 
should never be cut while hot), split open the pieces and lay them, 
crust down, on a platter; on this put the chicken. 

Chicken Scallop. — This dish offers the best means of serving 
an old and tough fowl. Disjoint the fowl and boil slowly, until 
perfectly tender. Eemove and cut the meat from the bones in 
small pieces. Take 1 cupful of tha broth, thicken slightly with 
flour, add a tablespoonful of butter, season with salt, pepper and 
chopped parsley, and stir in 1 well-beaten egg. Butter a -pudding 
dish, cover the bottom with a quantity of bread-crumbs^ add the

pepper and a little Cayenne; dredge in a litlile flour, and cover well 
with cold water ; stew over a slow fire three quarters of an hour. Line 
the sides of a deep baking dish with a nice crust. Lay the chicken in 
the dish, removing the largest bones. Pour in half the gravy, 
dredge lightly with flour, and add a few bits of butter. Roll but 
the upper crust, cover carefully, being sure to leave an opening in 
the top. Bake in a quick oven about an hour. Before sending to 
table pour in the remainder of the hot gravy. 

This pie is equally good made of cold chicken. Put the meat 
in layers, dredging flour and seasoning over each. Pour in some 
of the broth or gravy in which the fowl was cooked. Line the dish 
with paste and cover as before. Add bits of butter before putting 
on the crust. 

Chicken Pie with Oysters. — Prepare the pie as above, using 
a rich paste, adding raw oysters to each layer of chicken. Pour 
over all the chicken gravy or broth, dredge with flour, dot liberally 
with butter, add a little of the strained oyster liquor, cover, and 
bake one hour. For a plain pie use a nice biscuit dough. 

Chicken Corn Pie.— Dress, wash and joint a fowl as , for 
chicken pie. Stew and season in the same manner. Take the 
kernels from 12 ears of sweet corn, put a layer of it in a pan; then 
a layer of chicken, alternate thus until air is used; season each 
layer with pepper, salt and bits of butter. Let the last layer be of 
corn. Lastly, pour on the broth or gravy in which the fowl was 
cooked. Bake thirty or forty minutes. 

Chicken Pot Pie. — Cut up the chicken as for chicken pie, 
put it in a kettle, cover it with water, add a little salt, and 
boil until done; have ready a light biscuit dough, cut in squares, 
lay it on top of the chicken, cover tightly and boil thirty minutes 
without lifting the cover or allowing the boiling to cease. Lay 
the chicken in a deep dish, removing the largest bones. Cover 
with the crust, season and thiokeh the gravy and pour over it.' 

Pot Pie Crast.— 

1 teacupful of flour. 

1 teaspoonful of baking powder. 

^ teaspoonful pf salt. 

Mix with sweet milk to a soft batter that will readily drop 



POULTRY. 71 

from the spoon. Butter a pudding dish or a basin, poiir it in and 
steam one hour. When done, break apart mth a fork and pour 
the gravy over it on a platter. If a larger quantity is required, 
double the amount and cook twice as long. Pot-pie made in this 
manner is perfectly wholesome. This rule is applicable to veal, 
venison 6r other pot-pies. 

Cold biscuit may be utilized as po.t pie. Heat and soften 
thoroughly in the hot broth, arrange on a platter with the chicken, 
or any other variety of meat that may be used, and pour the gravy 
over all. These have the merit of being always light and digesti- 
ble. 

Potato Pot-Pie Crust. — Boil 8 or 9 small potatoes ; peel and 
mash fine. Mix with a piece of butter the size of a hen's egg. 1 
teaspoonful of salt, 1 cupful of sweet milk, and flour enough to 
roll out; roll, cut in cakes and put over the meat. Let boil stead- 
ily thirty minutes without removing the cover. 

Chicken Stew with Dumplings. — Cut up the fowl according 
to directions. Put over to stew in enough cold water to cover; three 
hours will be required for a toiigh fowl. While stewing, throw in 
a tablespoonful of chopped onion, a small piece of pickled pork 
cut fine, 1 teaspoonful of salt, ^ teaspoonful of pepper and a cup- 
ful of milk. Thicken with 2 tablespoonfuls of flour rubbed in 
water. 

Have the egg dumplings made according to rule with Soups. 

Indian Stew. — Cut up and stew a fowl half-done, then add 
a cup of raw rice, a slice of ham chopped fine, pepper and salt. 
Let all cook together until the rice swells and absorbs all the 
gravy of the stewed chicken. Do not allow it to get hard or dry. 
Serve in a deep dish. 

This dish may be made of many kinds of meat. Veal is very 
nice cooked in this way. 

Baked Chicken.— -Split a dressed chicken down the back; 
put it in, a baking-pan, chicken inside down ; cover with strips of salt 
pork, pepper, salt and bake. It will be found delicious and juicy. 

Dish up; pour off the fat from the pan gravy; add a cup of 
milk and let it boil up, when the gravy will be found seasoned and 
thickened for use.

Broiled Chiekeni — Have a hot bed of coals and a well but- 
tered gridiron, not too near the fire. Split a dressed chicken down 
the backbone and lay it out as flat as possible. Season lightly 
with salt and pepper and broil slowly. Lay a heavy plate with a 
weight upon it, if necessary, to keep the chicken close to the 
gridiron. When nearly done, turn and brown the other side, but- 
tering the upper side. 

It takes one-half hour to broil a chicken properly — sometimes 
longer. It should be liberally seasoned and buttered. 

A young chicken cooked in a hot pan in the oven, without 
water or basting of any kind, cannot be distinguished from 
broiling. Mutton chops are also very nice cooked in the same 
way. 

Fried Chicken. — Joint young chickens, put in cold water. 
When ready to cook remove from the water, dredge with flour and 
fry in hot lard a nice brown. Use butter if preferred. A gravy 
can be made in the pan by pouring either a cup of milk or water 
in the pan, thicken, season, let boil up and serve separately. 

Pickled Chicken. — Boil four chickens until tender enough 
for meat to fall from bones, put meat in a stone jar and pour over 
it 3 pints of cold, good cider vinegar and 1^ pints of the water in 
which the chickens were boiled; add spices if preferred, and it 
will be ready for use in two days. This is a popular Sunday even- 
ing dish ; it is good for luncheon at any time. 

Chicken Fatties. — Line small patty-pans with a good puff 
paste. Bake in a brisk oven. Stir minced chicken into a good 
white sauce ; heat through, fill the shells and set in an oven to 
brown very slightly before serving. The meat of other fowls and 
veal may be prepared in the same manner. 

Chicken Cheese. — Boil two chickens till tender. Take out 
all the bones and chop the meat fine ; season to taste with salt, 
pepper and butter; pour in enoughs of the liquor they were boiled 
in to moisten it. Mold it in any shape you choose, and when cold 
turn out and slice. Excellent lunch for traveling. 

Foe Chicken SalaD; — See Salads. 

lioast Ducks. — Pick and draw a pair of ducks; wash as 
slightly as possible.

Boil the giblets tender, pour off the fat from the pan gravy, 
thicken with 1 tablespoonful of browned flour; add the chopped 
giblets and salt and pepper to taste. Parboiling before roasting 
wiU remove the strong taste of ducks. Thin slices of salt pork 
may be fastened over the breast bone while roasting. 

Boned Dncks. — Ducks can be boned and filled in the same 
manner as turkey or chicken. See directions in this chfi,pter. A 
chopped onion-, however, must be added to the other ingredients. 

When boiled ducks are used for forcemeat the effect will not 
be as good, for the meat is entirely dark. 

This may be in a measure obviated by the use of stock jellies^ 
Jhop a cupful of this and spread over the forcemeat just before 
tying up. This will give a mottled appearance to the filling. 

Boned ducks may be served whole, decorated with stock jelly 
cut in various forms, or sliced, by placing a square or jelly on each 
piece. Greens for the edge of the platter. 

Stock Jelly for Meats.— Dissolve one ounce of sheet gela- 
tine in a quart of soup stock. Season with salt, white pepper, 
parsley or celery and the juice of one lemon. Let cool, remove 
the fat, clarify according to recipe and strain through a napkin. 
Color in different tints, with burnt sugar, beet juice, etc. 

This jeUy can be used in various ways with boned turkey. 
Melted and poured over cold meats it is very nice. 

Apple Stuffing.— 

1 pint of tart apple sauce. 
1 teacupful of bread-crumbs. 
A littles sage, salt and pepper. 
Mix and use to stuff roist duck, goose and some kinds of game. 



74 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Boiled Duck. — Prepare like boiled turkey. This is a very 
nice dish, ajid is preferred by many to roast duck as a more del- 
icate dish. The broth can be kept until next day, skimmed and 
a very nice soup made. 

^oast Goose, — Dress carefully, truss and parboil for an hour 
or two to remove some of the strong flavor. There are many 
■ways of stuffing. The apple stuffing may be used, or one com- 
monly depended upon is made as follows : 

Two moderate-sized onions, boiled rapidly ten minutes; chop 
finely, mince sage the quantity of half the onion ; add powdered 
bread twice as much as onion, or two cupf uls ; pepper and salt it, 
introduce a little Cayenne, and bind together with a beaten egg, 
adding a tablespoonful of hot water. Do not stuff closely, but. 
leave room for the dressing to swell. If there should be too much 
onion to suit the taste, add another cup of bread-crumbs to the 
stuffing. Secure the openings carefully, that none of the season- 
ing may escape. Eoast an hour and three-quarters in a quick 
oven ; baste very frequently. Fasten paper over the breast at first 
to prevent scorching. There should be at least two oupfuls of 
water in the dripping-pan. 

To make a rich brown gravy, pour off the fat from the pan 
gravy, add sufficieut water, thicken with browned flour, season and 
let it boil. 

Previous to serving a flavoring may be made if desired: 
1 dessert -spoonful of prepared mustard. 
^ teaspoonful of Cayenne, same of salt. 

Mix with 2 wine-glassfuls of the gravy and the juice of haL a 
lemon. Make hot, remove the threads from the fowl, and pour 
the flavoring into the opening for forcemeat. 

Serve with hot apple sauce. A giblet gravy may be made, as 
for turkey, if preferred to the above. 

App'e Sauce for Meats.— Pare and slice good tart apples, 
cover and stew one-half hour in water about level with the apples. 
Throw in a little butter. Beat fine at the last. Use no sugar. 

Potato Forcemeat. — Mash potatoes, with cream oi 
rich milk. Season highly with butter, Cayenne and salt; mix 
in a teacnpful of bread-crumbs to give body to the dressing. Use 



POULTRY, 75 

this for geese or ducks. The bread-crumbs are sometimes 
omitted. 

Sour Roast Dack, (German Style).— Dress the diick nicely. 
Soak twenty-four hours in vinegar. Take 1 tablespoonful butter, 
put in the pan and brown. Stuff the duck, put it in the pan, dredge 
freely with flour, baste often with the butter, salt to taste. 
SouB Sauce foe Eoast Duck. — 

1 tablespoonful butter. 

1 tablespoonful flour. 

1 onion sliced ; cook both in the butter until brown. 

J teacupful vinegar, 2 bay leaves. 

1 teacupful cream or milk. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 

Flavor with a bit of lemon peel. 
Let it boil up in the pan; send to table with the duck. 
Chicken Stew, (Creole Style),— 

8 pullets. 

6 green pepper pods. 

1 onion. 

1 slice of boiled ham. 

1 quart of toma,toes, fresh or canned. 

1 quart of peas, stewed. 
Joint the chickens and stew them together with the peppers, 
ham and onion in eiiough water to cover them until the meat faUs 
from the bones. Remove the chicken to a large dish and keep 
hot. Strain the brbth, put the tomatoes in the liquor and stew 
down thick, season with salt. Add the peas while hot. Pour the 
stewed tomato over the chicken, then the peas. 

Chicken or Turkey Cutlets. — Out slices from the breast of 
a cold fowl (cold veal or any other white meat may be used), dip 
in beaten egg and then in cracker dust, fry to a nice brown in 
melted butter or beef dripping. Gut slices of stale bread in quar- 
ters, dip quickly in hot water, then in the beaten egg, dust with 
the crackers and fry the same as the meat. Send to the table on 
the same or separate dishes as preferred. Garnish the mpat with 
bits of parsley. A nice dish for breakfast or luncheon. 



MEM^^. 



■fT\ jf^^TS. — Where meat is tough add a little vinegar or a 
I P piece of lemon to the water in which it is boiled. This 
,iJLi^ -vyili result in a shortening of time and a saving of fuel, 
while the meat wUl be rendered more easy of digestion. Also any 
slight taint, that may be about the meat, will be entirely removed 
by this process. * 

To MAKE a steak tender rub it over with a small quantity of 
baking soda the day before using. Wash off next morning and 
cook in any way desired. This process will answer for fowls, legs 
of mutton, etc. 

Meat. — If a little tainted sprinkle charcoal over it, or boil it 
with a lump of -':arcoal in the water. This will make it quite 
fresh again. Game especially can be sweetened by lumps of char- 
coal placed in the interior. Dressed fowls the same. 

To DGH meat or fowl is made more tender by putting a pinch 
of baking soda in the water used for boiling. 

Salt poke for frying can be very much improved by slicing 
for use and freshening over night in sweet milk, or milk and water 
can be used half and half. 

Smoked meat may be kept by rubbing molasses over the fleshy 
part and then cover thickly with black pepper. This way cannot 
be excelled. Hams may be kept in the same manner. 

Feozen meat can be thawed by putting in cold water until the 
frost is drawn out. This should be done just before required lor 
ut.e. ■ 

In slicing ham rub the cut side with cornmeal. It will 
in.itlier dry nor taint and the meal can be easily rubbed off. 

TuE STEAM from a pan of water in the oven will prevent mea',=

from scorching, A pod of red pepper put in the water/where meat 
is boiling will prevent the odor from filling the house. 

Tin covers made to fit the baking-pan and high enough to 
admit the roast are very desirable. Meat is much nicer roasted iu 
this way. 

Salt meat should be put over in cold water. 

Meat for soup should be put in cold water, heated gradually 
and boiled slowly. Do not skim for beef tea. 

Meat for boihng or stewing should he plunged into boiling 
salted water and boiled ten minutes. Take it out and add fresh 
water; boil slowly, as fast boiling hardens meat. 

Stewing meat is an economical method, as it does not reqjiire 
much fire, and coarse and cheap meats cooked in this way with or 
without vegetables may be made tender and nutritious. 

Teems used in cookery : 

Braidng —That is, slow roasting in a closely covered pan will 
subdue the obstinate fiber and retain all the juices of the meat. 
Fans come expressly for this purpose, but any ordinary deep pan 
with a cover can be used instead. 

Larding. — By this it is meant to cover the roast either of meat 
or fowl with strips of fat salt pork fastened on with wooden 
skewers. This is resorted to to prevent scorching, and also to 
flavor. In larding, however, we sometimes puncture the meat 
with numerous incisions through which narrow strips of pork aie 
to be drawn or pushed. 

Basting. — Simply dip the water or juices in the roasting-pan 
ov^r the meat. Do this frequently, using a large spoon for thsj 
operation. 

Dredging. — Sprinkle with flour, salt or spice. 

Breading an article is simply rolling it in bread-crumbs, cracker 
dust, flour or cornmeal preparatory to frying. It is usual to dip 
the article to be breaded in beaten egg, or egg and water. Batter 
is sometimes used or a cream sauce, while if the article contains 
eggs, such as croquettes, the dipping may be omitted and simple 
rolling in crumbs substituted. 

Claeifying Fat foe Peying. — The fat that is skimmed from 
gravies, soups or taken from roast meat always contains water and 



78 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

cannot be used for frying until this is removed. Melt slowly in a 
hot sauce-pan. Boil gently and pour off carefully. If wished 
especially clear straining through a cloth may be resorted to with 
good effect. 

Hot plates should be brought to the table with all varieties 
of meat, but more especially with mutton, as the fat of this is go 
quick to harden. Never heat them on the range or in the oven, 
thereby cracMng and ruining the glazing. Put the plates required 
in a large pan and cover with boiling water. When ready to 
serve the dinner wipe the plates quickly and place on the table. 

Seasoning for meats should be added when the meats are al- 
most cooked, as salt draws"^ out the juices of the meat. 

Gaknishes foe Meats. — To garnish a dish is simply to orna- 
ment it. See Department of Garnishes. 

Bread Balls. — Break the bread in small pieces; moisten 
with milk or a little water; season with salt, pepper and nutmeg; 
adding a little fine sage or parsley, and a small piece of butter. 
Mix and form in small cakes or balls. Boast with beef or chicken, 
or try with steak. 

Dressing with Boast Beef— Tery Nice.— Make a plain 
dressing, as for turkey or chicken, and bake in the pan with the 
beef. This is liked by many better than Yorkshire pudding. If 
the baking pan has no cover Spread the dressing over the top of the 
meat as well. This will keep the meat moist. 

Meat that is baking too fast may be covered with a buttered 
paper. 

Corn Beef should be put over to cook in cold water, and not 
be taken out of the kettle until cold. This wUl prevent its being 
dry. 

' Gravies for Roasts.— These should be thickened with 
browned flour. Uncooked flour is unpleasant to the eye and raw 
to the taste. Brown quite a quantity of flour at a time and keep 
handy in a glass jar or tin box closely covered. 

BRRP. 
Boast Beef.— Allow one-quarter of an hour for each pound 
of meat. This old and reliable rule may be varied to suit the dif- 



MEATS. 79 

ferent tastes; twenty minutes to the pound will secure a well-done 
roast. To have the meat full of gravy when cut, heat the pan and 
put in a very hot oven; add no liquor until after the outside of the 
roast has seared over, thus retaining the juice. A piece of from 
7 to 10 pounds is -very good size for a family of six persons. 
Dredge with flour; after the first quarter hour pour in a cupful of 
water; for a 7 pound roast sprinkle on 1 teaspoonful each of salt 
and pepper. Baste often; before the roast is done dredge once 
more with flour. When done pour in sufficiefit water for gravy, 
skim off most of the fat, and thicken slightly with flonr. Jelly 
may be served with it. Half an hour before the meat is done, add 
to the pan beneath the roast a Yorkshire pudding. 
Yorkshire Pudding. — 

1 cupful of sifted flour. 

1 pint of milk. 

2 well-beaten eggs. 

Salt and a pinch of baking powder, 

A pint of water may be used instead of milk/ in which case 1 
tablespoonful of dripping may be added. Mix this batter smoothly, 
adding the eggs last. Instead of pouring the batter into the pan 
with roast, it will be found an easier method at times to bake the 
pudding separately in a broad shallow pan for twenty minutes, 
cutting in squares and serving with the meat on top, and the gravy 
separately. 

Fillet of Beef Roasted.— The fillet is the underside of the 
loin. Eemove all superfluous fat. Take out tl^e bones, trim and 
lard the top with slices of fat salt pork ; skewer ; put in a pan in 
the bottom of which are small bits of' pork,and beef suet. Dredge 
with salt and pepper. Bake in a hot oven for one-and-a-half 
hours. After the first fifteen minutes add 1 cup of boiling water. 
Baste often. Garnish with colored jelly. 

Delicious Roast Meat. — Heat the baking pan hot. Then 
put in the roast and let it brown well. Turn over and sear the 
side thoroughly; this method retains the juices in the meat, then 
put in the oven and bake until done, basting as necessary. The 
inside will be pink and juicy. 

Rib Roast — Stmffed. — Bemove the bones from the roast, 



8o THREE MEALS A DAY 

flatten the meat and pepper it well. Make a rich dressing, mois- 
ten with egg. Pour the dressing into a hot frying , pan with a 
little melted lard, stir until thickened. Spread over the meat. 
EoU, tie and bake. Good to press and slice cold. 

Broiled Steak. — ^A clear bed of coals is the first requisite for 
broiling, and this may be secured by sprinkling a handful of char- 
coal over the fire. Should it burn too much a little salt will extin- 
guish the flames and make the fire clear. Butter the girdiron well 
to prevent sticking. Sear first one side of the steak and then the 
other to retain the juices, then cook by frequent turnings, which 
process will require about ten minutes, fifteen for well done. Never 
put a fork into the lean part of broiling steak as this allows the 
escape of the gravy. Salt draws out the juices, therefore should 
never be used until the article is removed from the broiler. A 
teaspoonful of lemon juice, mixed with a tablespoonful of melted 
butter, and sprinkled from time to time over the broiUng steak 
will give, according to one expert in such matters, a very flue 
flavor. 

Fried Steak. — See first that the pan, and the dripping or 
butter to be used, are thoroughly hot. Prepare the steak as for 
broiling. Bear quickly on both sides and turn often until done 
never piercing the lean, and thus allowing the juices to escape. 
Salt when done. Serve on a hot platter with bits of butter over 
the steak and a slight sprinkle of pepper. Garnish with water 
cresses, parsley or Saratoga potatoes. 

Beefsteak a la Maitre d'Hotel.— A sirloin steak broiled with 
a piece of maitre d'hotel butter melting upon it and the dish is 
complete. 

Maitre d'Hotel Butter.— Fresh butter, pepper, salt and 
lemon juice mixed with scalded chopped parsley; serve the steak 
with this butter either upon or under the meat where it melts. 
Garnish with potato baUs. 

Round Steak.— (With cream) — Pound or score well; cook 
like fried steak in its own fat. Serve on a hot platter. Pour half 
a cup of sweet cream into the pan, let it boil up and turn over the 
steak. Veal steak may be served in the same manner. Another 
way is to cook the steak and pour sufficient water into the pan for 



MEATS. 8 1 

gravy, thicken with flour, browned flour is nicer, add. butter if ne- 
cessary, season and remove the meat to the platter. 

Beefsteak with Oyster Sauce. — An agreeable change may 
be made, one that is suitable for any steak by adding a portion oi 
oyster juice to the above brown gravy, thus givirig the English 
oyster-sauce. Pour this over the steak, and garnish with cut lem- 
ons. Baked potatoes should be served with steak. 

Beefsteak Smothered in Onions. — Take a juicy beefsteak 
broil or fry nicely. Have ready 6 onions sliced and fried in but- 
ter, salt them slightly and let fry a light brown. When the steak 
is done and ready to serve, put several lumps of butter upon it, 
pour 2 tablespoonfuls of boiling waiter over it., Cover with the hot 
onions, and serve at once. 

Beefsteak for the Old.— Take coarse, lean beef, with a small 
quantity of suet. Eun through a sausage cutter or chop very fine, 
add pepper and salt, make into cakes | of an inch thick and fry in 
butter or suet, as you would beefsteak. /This dish is not only 
cheap, but nearly as good as the choicest cut. To rnake nicer, roll 
in cracker-crumbs and beaten egg before frying. Serve with mashed 
potatoes. 

Beefsteak Pndding. — Make a crust with flour, finely chopped 
suet and warm water, salting slightly. Line a pudding dish or 
basin with this. Cut in bits a tender steak and fill into the 
basin, seasoning each layer with salt and pepper, and, if liked, 
a little chopped onion. A very little chopped bacon added, will 
improve the flavor. Cover with a layer of the same crust, and put 
thp basin, tightly covered, in a steamer and steam untU suffi- 
ciently done, one or two hours, according to size. When dished, 
open the top a little and put in a small lump of butter. 

Braised Beef. — A cut from the round is suitable,' or a still 
cheaper cut from the shoulder may be used. About 6 pounds is a 
good weight. Tie it carefully with twine and brown on both sides 
in a braising pan in which there has been fried three or f qur slices 
of Jfat salt pork; dripping may be used instead. Dredge the meat 
well with flour. When it begins to brown, sprinkle over it 1 tea; 
spoonful of pepper and 2 of salt. When well browned on both ' 
sides add 1 quart of water, put ij in the oven and roast slowly for 



82 THKfiE MEALS A DAY. 

four hours. Baste often. Eemove from the pan and serve; thick- 
en the gravy in the pan with flour rubbed smooth in cold water. 
Let it boil up and serve separately. 

Mock Duck. — Take a round steak, bone it, make a dressing as 
for turkey. Spread this over the steak, roll up and tie, roast half 
an hour. 

Beef Cheese. — Boil beef of any kind, the shank is good, un- 
til the bones fall out, carefully reject aU bits of gristle or other- 
inedible substances; chop fine, season with/salt, pepper, a dash of 
Cayenne and parsley, or such other herbs as may be preferred. 
Moisten with some of the liquor, adding a tablespoonful or two of 
vinegar, if desired. Press in a pan with a plate and heavy weight 
on top. 

Very tough and cheap pieces of meat may be made dehcious 
by this method; slice thin when cold. The platter may be gar- 
nished with parsley. 

Beef Heart StuiFed. — Boil the heart three houi's, leaving 
only enough water at the end for gravy. Make a dressing of bread- 
crumbs, melted butter, pepper and salt, using sage and chopped 
onions also. When the heart is tender, cut out a portion of the 
middle and fill the cavity with this dressing. Put the heart in a 
pan in the oven with the liquor it was boiled in, season with salt 
and pepper and bake about twenty minutes. Chop the piece of 
heart fine, stir into the liquor in the pan and thicken slightly with 
browned flour. This makes a rich gravy to be served separately. 

This dish is also very nice served cold without gravy. Slice 
thin and garnish the platter with lemon sliced, or parsley. Pickled 
string beans are a pretty garnish. 

Some cooks soak the heart over night in a weak brine. 

Dressing for Beef Heart. — A more elaborate dressing may 
be made as follows : 

2 cups of bread-crumbs. 
^ cup of chopped pork. 
J of a lemon peel, grated. 

Thyme and other herbs and a dash of lemon juice to flavor. 
This dressing may be used for roast turkey, etc. This is delicious 
served cold.

Irish Stew.— 'Chop corned beef and salt pork fine — | beef 
and J pork, making the proper proportions. Put them in a stew- 
pan with 6 whole peppercorns, 2 blades of mace, 1 teaspoonful of 
celery seeds and what sweet herbs are liked- Cover with water 
and stew very gently for an hour; then add 1 chopped potato,^ 
turnip, ^ carrot also chopped, 1 sliced onion and 2 tablespoonfuls 
of vinegar to flavor. Thicken with flour, or boil J cupful of rice, 
putting it in at the same time with the vegetables. Put toasted 
bread cut in dice, or freshly baked biscuits, broken small, in the 
tureen ; pour the stew over this and serve hot. 

Baked Beef Stew. — Cut some beef in thin slices, pound it 
as for a pie, season well with pepper, salt, butter and some 
onion chopped fine; dredge with flour, put in a pudding-dish, fill 
the dish with sliced potatoes; add water, bake an hour or more, 
according to the size of the dish. Some sweet herbs may be 
added in place of the onions, if preferred. 

Spiced Beef Boll. — Take 6 pounds of beef flank. Mix to- 
gether thoroughly: 

8 tablespoonfuls of salt. 

2 tablespoonfuls of brown sugar. 

1, teaspoonful of pepper. 

1 saltspoonfnl each of cloves and allspice. 

Eub this over the meat and then sprinkle well with J teacup - 
ful of cider vinegar. 

Eoll up tightly and tie closely with twine, or bandage with 
thin muslin. Let it stand twenty-four hours in a cool place, then 
put in a saucepan and barely cover with boiling water" and stew 
gently for fom- hours. Then dish, removing the strings, and 
thicken the gravy, which will have boiled down to a small quan- 
tity, with 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, accor^ng to the amount, 
rubbed smooth in cold water; let it boil up and serve separately. 

This is good cold, sliced, or it may be hashed, adding the re- 
mainder of the gravy. 

Boiled Flank, Stuffed.— -Take a piece of flank, 6 or 8 inches 
wide, and as long as it will cut; sprinkle it with salt and let stand 
twenty-four hours. Then prepare stuffing as for chicken or tur- 
key; spread this over it and roll up very tight; tie up in a> cloth

and boil six hours. When taken up lay between two boards, to 
drain, and put a weight upon it until cold. It will then cut in 
very ornardental slices. To be eaten cold. 

Beef a la Mode.— The round of beef is best to prepare a la 
mode; bone it. For 5 pounds of beef, soak a pound of bread in 
cold water until soft; drain the water off thoroughly, mash the 
bread, chop up the marrow from the bone of the beef; ^ teaspoon - 
ful of salt, the same quantity of pepper; mace and nutmeg to 
the taste. These last may be omitted and parsley used instead. 1 
tablespooiful of flour; mix well together with two eggs well 
beaten. FiU with this seasoning the place from which the bone 
was taken, and cut gashes in the beef and fill likewise. Tie firmly 
with tapes to keep in form. It is a good plan to prepare it the 
day before and keep in a cool place. 

Cover the bottom of a stewpan with slices of salt pork or 
bacon; lay the beef upon these and cover the top with more slices 
of pork skewered on. ■ Pour in 1 quart of water, cover closelyand 
let bake six hours, or more if the round is 'Very large. 

A braising-pan is nice for this ; a small kettle that will go in 
the oven, or a deep pan that can be covered, will answer. 

An hour before the meat is done remove the pork from the 
top and spread any dressing that may be left over the beef. . 

Dish the meat, aiid, keeping it hot while preparing the gravy, 
serve the sliced bacon on the same platter. 

Skim the fat carefully from the liquor in the pan, add boiling 
water if there is not a sufficient quantity; thicken with brown 
flour, season to the taste. Walnut catsup is good. Let it boU 
up and pour over the meat, serving at once. This is a-^licious 
sliced cold; the gravy may be served separately at dinne- B-ert

, Stewed Kidneys.— 'Parboil fifteen minutes, covering with 
cold water, seasoned with salt and red pepper — first cutting off the 
fat; skim the water as often as necessary. Take out, cut in 
mouthfuls, strain the liquor, return them to it, adding 1 head of 
chopped celery, 2 onions chopped, 12 potatoes sliced, and a piece 
of butter rolled in flour. Season with pepper and stew slowly un- 
til the meat and vegetables are tender. This may be made without 
' the potatoes, when less watet will be needed. Thicken with flour. 
To make the stew brown, fry the kidneys in a little butter before 
stewing. •• , 

Beef Tongue, Boiled. — Wash the tongue carefully and soak 
twenty-four hours, changing the water at least once. Put it over 
to cook in cold water and boil from four to six hours, according to 
the size. The skin should always be removed as soon as taken 
from, the pot. It may be served hot with sprigs of parsley over 
the root. If to be eaten cold, cut off the root, put a weight upon 
the tongue, and slice very thinly, garnishing with parsley or curjed 
lettuce leaves. 

If the tongue is neither corned nor smoked, but perfectly fresh, 
the soaking maybe omitted and the tongue boiled in slightly salted 
water, always remembering to put it over to boil 'in cold water. 

Deviled Tongue. — Take boiled beef tongue, chop very fine, 
season well with black and red pepper and dry mustard; add a 
couple of tablespoonfuls of vinegar to moisten, press solid and 
slice thin. , " Deviled " means " very hot " or very highly sea- 
soned. 

Pickled Tripe. — Tripe procured at a meat market is pre- 
pared for pickling or drying. Cut in squares an" inch or more each 
way, first drying in a towel, and pour boiling vinegar over them 
highly spiced with pepper-corn and mace. Add a little salt. This 
will keep some time. 

Fried Tripe. — Cut in pieces, dry carefully, roU in flour and 
fry in plenty of butter and lard mixed. Fry to a light brown. 
Some cooks serve this with a gravy- made in the pan.

It is now fit for broiling, frying or pickling. Tripe is usually in 
the market ready prepared. 

Fried Liver. — Cut in slices half an inch thick, parboil, peel 
the edges, dip in salted flour and fry brown in hot lard, or fi-y 
some breakfast bacon in the pan first and cook the liver after- 
ward. Butter or beef suet may be used for frying. Serve the 
bacon, if used, with the liver 

Beef Liver Stewed. — Prepare the liver as above, fry brown 
with some slices of salt pork — 4 or 5. Then take it and cut in 
strips, together with the pork. Put it back in the pan with 1 cup 
of water, a piece of butter rolled in flour and pepper to suit. Stew 
two minutes and serve hot. 

Boiled Com Beef. — Take a piece of corned beef — a flank 
piece. Make a dressing as for chicken or turkey. Spread over 
the beef, roll tightly and tie. Fold in a thin cloth. Boil until 
tender. Take up, drain and press under a weight, slice cold, 
garnish with small cucumber pickles. 

Dried Beef with Eggs. — Cut some dried beef in thin 
shavings. Put them in a frying-pan, and nearly fill it with hot 
water. Set it on the fire and let it boU up once, and pour off. 
Put with the beef, butter the size of a hen's egg to half a pound 
of meat. Add a little pepper and let it fry a few moments over a 
quick fire; then break 3 or more eggs into it. Stir them together 
until the eggs are done; turn on a dish and serve; or fry the 
jbeef as above with a little wheat flour dredged over. Fry eggs and 
serve with it same as ham. 

Potted Beef, Ham, Chicken, etc. — Chop cold roast or 
boiled beef very fine. Veal, fowl, etc., may be used instead. Kub 
with each" teacup of the meat 1 teaspoonful melted butter and 
season with pepper, salt and mace. A slice of cold bam chopped 
with it improves the flavor. Put in a double boiler, or in a dish 
set in a sauce-pan of boiling water until the meat is heated 
through. When nearly cold pack in small jars and cover the top 
with warm, not hot, butter or melted suet. It wiU keep ten days. 
Slice cold, melt the suet or butter and pour over again when part 
is used out.

Veal Boast. — The loin of veal is the best part for roasting, 
though the breast and rack are very good for the same purpose, as 
is the fillet also. Salt, pepper and rub with butter. Put in a pan 
with a cupful of water, adding a little butter unless the meat is 
quite fat. Let the heat of the oven be gradual at the beginning. 
Ba^te frequently. About twenty-five minutes to the pound is 
necessary. Before the meat is done dredge with flour. Brown 
slightly. Remove most of the fat from the pan gravy, turn in 
sufficient hot water, thicken slightly with browned flour, let it 
boil up and send the gravy to the table separately. If the kidney 
be roasted with the loin serve each one, if possible, with a piece. 
See that the roast is cooked through. 

Baked Fillet of Veal. — The fillet is the under part of the 
loin. Bone it and fill the plape with the following dressing: Soak 
a sufficient quantity of bread in cold water, squeeze dry; season 
this highly with pepper, salt and thyme or parsley ; add 1 table- 
spoonful of melted butter and mix with 2 well-beaten eggs. Sew 
the aperture together. Make gashes over the top of the veal and 
fill with more of the dressing. Put in the baking-pan with about 
a pint of water and pour the remainder of the dressing over the 
upper part of the meat. Pour hours at least will be required to 
cook this roast sufficiently. Eemove from the fire, skim the gravy, 
thicken slightly with flour rubbed smooth in a littlp water. Add 
a small piece of butter and a dash of catsup. Serve separately. 
Garnish the roast with jelly. One nice method of serving jelly 
with meats is for the carver to place a spoonful of jelly on each 
slice of meat as he serves it. Mint sauce is very nice to serve 
with veal. 

Stuffed Breast of Veal. — The breast or brisket of veal is a 
low priced cut. Take the entire "plate," as it is called, have the 
bones removed at the market and sent home with the roast for the 
soup kettle. Make s bread stuffing as for Turkey or FiUefc of Veal. 
Spread this over the broad piece of veal, roll up and tie firmly. 
Put this roll into a baking-pan with a Uttle water and salt. Cover

piBg. Make the usual gravy in the pan. (See above.) Garnish 
according to taste. 

Teal Pot-Pie. — Boil the veal until tender. Season with salt, 
pepper and butter. Thicken the gravy, first adding hot water, if 
necessary, that there may be a sufficient quantity. Make a biscuij 
dough, roll thick and cover the meat. Make an opening for the 
steam to escape. Boil rapidly for half an hour after putting on 
the crust, keeping the kettle tightly covered. 

Veal Pie. — Cut the veal in small pieces, boil one hour, sea- 
son with salt pepper and a small piece of butter; make a crust 
with sour milk, saleratus and a little lard, flour sufficient to roll 
out. Line the sides only of a tin basin or pudding dish with this 
crust. Put the meat in, fill up the dish as full of gravy as it can 
be handled, dredge well with flour and cover it over with the crust. 
Make several openings for the escape of steam. If preferred a 
cream-tartar or baking powder crust may be used. 

Veal Stew. — Cut the veal in pieces, and put it over in about 
3 pints of water; add pepper and salt, onion chopped fine. Let it 
stew one hour and add a few potatoes shced. The potatoes can 
be left out. Make a biscuit dough, roll out, cut vsith a biscuit cut- 
ter and drop in the kettle. Stew half an hour longer and serve. 
The biscuit may be baked, broken open hot and laid crust down 
on the platter, and the stew poured over them. This is ' more 
healthful than boiled. 

Calf's Head Boiled. — Clean the head nicely. See directions 
for mock-turtle soup. Soak it in salt and water to blanch it. 
Take out the eyes, remove the tongue, and salt the brains to 
make a httle side dish. Boil the head until tender. Then rub with 
butter, sprinkle over with salt, pepper and finely powdered sweet 
herbs, dredge with flour or finely powdered bread-crumbs, set in a 
hot oven and squeeze the juice of a lemon over it; this gives it a fine 
flavor. Sometimes a little of the liquor used in boiling is substi- 
tuted for basting. Eoast to a fine brown, put on a hot platter and 
keep warm. 

Take a sufficient amount of the liquor for gravy, add a piece 
of butter the size of a hen's egg, thicken with browned flour, let it 
boil up with a small lemon out in thin slices, (the lemon may be

omitted, but is usually liked). Serve the gravy separately. Garnish 
the head with forcemeat balls or slices of lemon. 

For preparing the brains some cooks however, tie them in a 
cloth and boil with the head until done, and chop and add to the 
gravy, omitting the lemoh. The liquor the head is boiled in 
should be left until the next, day, skimmed and made, into a soup, 
either seasoned plain, or seasoned turtle fashion. 

CalPs Head Baked. — Clean and prepare as above. Divide 
it; rub over with butter, put in a baking pan with 1 quart of water. 
Cover it with a dressing made of bread soaked soft ; a little Gutter, , 
1 egg, and seasoned with salt, pepper and powdered mace; if liked, 
parsley may be used. Slice the brains and lay in the pan with the 
head. Garnish as above. Bake in a quick oven. 

Fried Teal Cutlets. — Take slices of veal 1 inch thick cut from 
the loin, rub with salt and pepper. Make a batter with ^ pint of 
milk, 1 egg beaten to a froth and flour enough to thicken, add a 
pinch of soda. Pry the veal brown, dip into the batter, put it 
back into the fat or butter and fry brown once more. If there is 
any batter left, drop it in large spoonfuls into the fat; fry brown 
and use to garnish the platter, serving one with each cutlet. 
Thicken the gravy with browned flour, first adding sufficient water, 
or sitoiply dip the half-cooked cutlet in beaten egg and then roll in 
cracker-crumbs and fry slowly until brown on each side. Some 
cooks omit the first frying, but it will be found better as it pre- 
vents the tendency to rawness. Garnish with sliced lemon. 

Broiled Veal Cutlets. — Salt and pepper, dip in melted but- 
ter, place upon the gridiron over a clear fire, baste with melted 
butter, turning three or four times. Melted butter sauce. 

Veal Loafi— (Without egg).— 

1 cupful of cold cooked veal, minced. 
1 cupful of raw veal, minced. 
;| cupful of raw fat bacon or pork. 
Salt, pepper and a pinch of powdered bay leaf. 
Mix; make up in a little loaf and bake Ijalf an hour. Slice 
for use either hot or cold. When cold meat is used entirely; egg 
is necessary to moisten the ingredients. The use of part uncooked 
meat does away with this, and the loaf is firmer to slice.

Veal Loaf, No. 2.— 

2 cupfuls of cold minced veal. 



cupful bread-crumbs soaked in milk. 



1 egg, well beaten.

hour. If baked, add 2 tablespoonfuls of milk. Serve cold, sliced 
neatly. 

Veal Marble. — Boil a beef tongue the day before it is to be 
used, and a like number of pounds of lean veal. Grind first one, 
then the other, in a sausage cutter, keeping them in separate ves- 
sels. If you have no machine, chop very fine. Season the tongue 
with pepper, powdered sweet herbs, parsley, etc., and a teaspoon- 
ful of made mustard; the veal in like rnanner, with the addition of 
salt. Pack in cups, bowls or jars, which have been well buttered. 
Press very hard as you go on, smooth the top and cover with melt- 
ed butter. When this cools, close tightly as possible and keep in 
a cool dry place. Turn out whole, or cut in slices for tea. It is a 
savory relish, garnished with parsley or the blanched tops of cele- 
jy. Ground ham can be used instead of tongue, or the white 
meat of fowk for veal. Pack in alternate layers. 

Potted Veal. — Boil the veal until tender, a common cut will 
iinswer. Season with salt and Cayenne pepper to taste. Take up, 
pick to pieces, take out all the bones, return to the kettle, and for 
each pound of meat stir in rapidly 3 well-beaten eggs; keep stir- 
ring until all is well mixed and cooked. Put in a dish. When 
jrllied, slice cold for tea or lunch. Garnish with parsley and 
blanched celery tops ; or make like Beef Loaf. 

VealJelly. — Boil shanks of veal until ready to drop froni 
the bones. Chop and season to taste. Cut hard-boiled eggs in 
three or four slices. Put first a layer of the finely chopped meat, 
then a layer of eggs, until the dish is full, having meat last. Put 
nnder a weight and leave until perfectly cold. Slice for luncheon 
or cornpany tea. 

Spiced Veal — Nice Relish. —

1 teaspoonful of pepper. 

1 lemon grated. 

Mold in the form of a loaf of bread. Cover with 1 rolled 
cracker, and baste with a teacup of hot water and melted butter 
(two tablespoonfuls of the butter.) Bake three hours, basting 
often to keep it moist. Bake the day before it is required for use. 
Slice very thin and garnish with sliced lemon and blanched celery 
tops. This will keep some time in a cool place, and can be sliced 
for use as desired. 

Pillau of Veal. — Boil a piece of lean veal until tender. Take 
up and cut into strips 8 er 4 inches long, return to the kettle with 
the liquor it was boiled in, and add 1 teaeupful of rice to every 3 
pounds of veal. Put in a piece of butter the size of an egg. 
Season it with salt, pepper and parsley, if. liked. Stew gently 
Until the rice is tender, and the water almost evaporated. A little 
curry powder in this converts it into a dish of curry. 

Calf's Feet — Fried. — Boil untU tender. Eemove the large 
bones, split, dredge with flour, season with salt, pepper and pow- 
dered parsley, and fry brown in butter or dripping. If a gravy is 
desired, pour a little water into the pan they were fried in, thicken 
with flour and season with salt, pepper and mace. Squeeze in a 
little lemon juice. Or .they may be boiled tender with a calf's 
bead and split in two and used to garnish the head. 

Buy those that have been singed, not skinned, as skinning 
results in a loss of all the gelatinous matter. 

Ciilfs Brains — Plain. — Soak the brains in salt water, 
remove the skin, Wash free from blood, then boil tender. Serve 
with salt, pepper and melted butter. 

Caifs Brains — Fried. — Wash as directed above, wipe dry,

j;on with salt, pepper and a little butter. Butter a pudding dish 
and fill with alternate layers of bread-crumbs and brains, having 
crumbs for the top layer. Pour in J cup of water and bake three- 
quarters of an hour. 

Larded Liver — ^Calf's. — Take a piece of liver and about J as 
much salt pork. Cut the bacon into strips about the size of a 
pencil. Make holes with a narrow knife, or a steel, and push the 
strips of pork through. The more the better. Let the larding be 
done so that the slices can be cut across it after cooking. Bake 
half an hour or more, according to size, in a pan with a little, 
dripping, with a greased paper laid over the top to keep it moist. 
Serve in shoes. 

Fricassee of Calf's Liver. — 2 pbunds of liver cut into strips 
more than half an inch thick, and a finger long, 2 young onions, 
or 1 small ripe one minced, ^ cup of gravy or soup-stock. ■ Dredge 
the sliced liver with flour and fry to a light brown quickly ; turning 
often. Mince the onions, adding a little parsley, and heat them in 
the gravy in a saucepan. Put in the fried liver, and stew all 
gently for fifteen minutes. Pour in 1 tablqspoonful of lemon juice 
and serve the liver with the gravy poured over it. 

Tried Sweet-breads. — Wash the sweet-breads carefully. Trim 
oS the fat and boil one hour. Season the water with salt and' a 
dash of vinegar. This may, be "done the day before. When quite 
cold split each lengthwise. Pepper and salt them, dip in beaten 
egg, and roll in pracker crumbs. Fry a nice brown. Garnish with 
lemon cut in quarters.

MUTTON AND IaAMB. 

Roast Mutton. — Mutton for roasting should have some but- 
ter rubbed over it and be dredged with salt and pepper. Put a 
little water in the baking-pan and a lump pf butter; baste fre- 
quently. The bony side should be turned toward the fire first and 
roasted. Allow one-quarter of' an hour to each pound of meat. 

Mint sauce is nice to serve with roast mutton, or melted cur- 
rant jelly. 

Stuffed Leg of Mutton. — Make a dressing of soaked, bread, 
seasoned with salt, parsley and pepper. Mix with 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter and a couple of beaten eggs. Cut deep 
gashes in the leg and fill with this dressing. Put in a dripping- 
pan; pour 1 pint of water and a lump of butter around ity and 
baste frequently. Bone the leg if possible, and fill the opening 
left with the dressing. Garnish with i celery tops, green and 
blanched together. Chopped salt pork may be added to the dress- 
ing in proportion of one-third of pork to two-thirds of bread and 
the eggs and butter omitted. 

Currant jelly and mashed turnips should be served with it. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton. — Put over in boiling water, allow- 
ing twenty pinutes to the pound. Salt the water in the propor- 
tion of 1 teaspoonful to the quart. If to be eaten cold, cool in 
the water to make the meat juicy. A boiled leg of mutton may be 
stuffed as above and boiled in a cloth. This is very nice cold. 
Boiling in a cloth gives mutton a whiter and more delicate appear- 
ance. Garnish with sliced lemon and parsley or curled lettuce. 

Mutton Stew. — Take 2 pounds of mutton, cut into small 
pieces, not over 1 inch square. Cover with 1 quart of cold Water, 
skim carefully and keep the 'ffater at the same level as it boUs 
away by adding hot water as needed. To 2 pounds of meat add 
2 large onions cut fine, 6 medium-sized potatoes, IJ teaspbonfuls 
of salt and J t^spoonful oi pepper. Cover and stew for two 
hours ; 1 small turnip sliced is an aiddition. Thicken the gravy 
with 1 tablespoonful of flour rubbed in cold water and fr^U five 
minutes longer. Serve hot. 

Bilked Mutton Cutlet. — Trim carefully. Melt a spoonful of 



94 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

butter and put a little on each cutlet; in a few minutes dip each 
one in beaten egg and then in cracker crumbs. Lay them in a 
dripping-pan and bake in a hot oven one-half hour, basting two or 
three times with a little butter and water. Boil the gravy down 
to a cupful, thicken with browned flour and season with a table- 
spoonful of tomato catsup, ^ of a teaspoonful of pepper, ^ tea- 
spoonful of salt, strain the gravy over the cutlets and serve hot. 

Mntton Chops. — Chops ought to be sawed, not cut. They 
should be 1 inch or 1;^ inches thick. The gridiron should be hot, 
clean and well buttered, before the chops are put on; slant it so 
that the iat may trickle away. Season with salt; turn without 
putting a fork into the chop; turn often.. They should be nicely 
browned and served with mushroom catsup and mashed potatoes. 

Mntton, Stewed with Green Peas. — Cut a breast of mut- 
ton in small pieces and fry brown in butter or dripping; season 
with salt and pepper; cover with water and let boil a few minutes, 
skimming carefully, taking as much of the fat as possible. Then 
add 1 quart of green peas, shelled; boil half an hour and then 
thicken the gravy with flour rubbed smooth in milk or cream. 

Boast Lamb. — The fore and hind quarters are good roasting 
pieces. Dredge with flour, sprinkle salt, pepper and bits of but- 
ter over the meat; baste it frequently with butter and water, a 
tablespoonf ul of butter to a teacupf ul of water. These pieces maj 
be stuffed also hke a fillet of veal (See page 87). Lamb must be 
well done; bake twenty minutes to the pound. Mint sauce is the 
conventional dressing for roast lamb, but the following cream 
sauce will be liked. 

Ckeam Sauce pok Lamb ^Pour off the clear fat from the 

baking-pan after the meat is removed. Add a cup of milk. Let 
it cook a few minutes ; add flour and butter; season sufficiently. 
The juice of half a lemon and a sprinkling of chopped parsley will 
add to the flavor. Serve the lamb with green peas. 

Shoulder of Lamb, Grilled. — The shoulder of lamb is good 
roasted plain, but is better cooked in the following manner: 

Score it in checkers, an inch each way, brush over ■with melted 
butter, then the beaten yolk of an egg, and dip in bread-crumbs; 
dredge with salt, pepper and powdered sweet herbs; roast until i 



MEATS. 95 

light brown. Make a plain gravy in tlie pan, though the follow- 
ing sauce is better: 

Sauoe.! — Take ^ pint of the liquor or gravy, add to it the 
same quantity of water, set over the fire, and when it boils, 
thicken with a little flour rubbed smooth in water, and season with 
a tablespoonful of tomato catsup, the juice and grated rind of 1 
lemon, and salt and pepper to the taste. 

Lambs' Tongues. — Lay in salt and water over night, then 
boil until yon can thrust a broom straw through them. Skin and 
pack in an earthen dish. Boil whole mace, cloves, pepper and 
cinnamon in cider vinegar and pour over until they are covered. 

Laiab Chops. — Trim carefully, lay in a little melted butter 
for an hour, turning several times ; then broil on a greased grid- 
iron, taking care they do not drip; butter, pepper and salt each 
one, lay in a circle on a plate and serve. Garnish with parsley. 
Another way is to lay each chop on half a slice of buttered toast 
and serve. 

Lamb Stew. — The head, feet and heart of a lamb, carefully 
cleaned, make a very good stew. BoU until tender, cut the meat 
from the head, cut up the heart and split the feet in two. Put the 
whole into a pan with a pint of the liquor they were boiled in, to- 
gether with a little butter, pepper, salt and J teaoupful of tomato 
catsup. Thicken slightly with flour. Stew the whole five min- 
utes. Pepper-grass or parsley will do for garnishing. r 

Leg of Lamb Boiled. — Boil in a cloth to make it white. Cut 
the loin in steaks, dip in egg, roll in bread-crumbs, fry a nice 
brown and place, around the dish. Garnish with fried parsley. 
Spinach or green peas should be served with it. 

PORK. 

Roast Pork. — Put over in a hot pan with about 2 cupfuls of 
water in the bottom. Score the skin in either strips or diamonds. 
Eub with salt, pepper and finely powdered sage. Eoast until thor- 
oughly done; time, twenty-five minutes to the pound. Baste with 
melted butter often. If a loin roast, make deep gashes between 
the ribs and £11 with a bread dressing flavored with sage and 
minced onion. (See Poultry.) If a leg roast, make deep incisions 



-g6 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

in the meat at the large end and fill firmly with the same dressing. 
Pour off the fat from the pan gravy, add sufficient water, thicken 
with browned flour, add the juice of half a lemon. Serve apple 
sauce with it. Spiced gooseberries or currant jelly are nice also. 
Mashed potatoes and mashed turnips are the vegetables served 
with roast pork. Parsnips are also suitable. 

Roast Spare Rib. — Trim carefully, season, place in a pan 
with a little water. Baste first with melted butter, then frequently 
with the dripping. Dredge with flour wlien partly done and baste 
finally with melted butter, the spare-rib roast being very dry. 
Make gravy as for Koast Pork. Serve with apple sauce and vege- 
tables as above. A bread-crumb dressing as above is sometimes 
spread over the spare-rib and roasted with it. 

Roast Pig. -^A pig for roasting should be small and fat, 
dressed carefully the day before. Prepare a dressing of bread- 
crumbs seasoned with salt, pepper and sweet herbs. Add a little 
butter to moisten with and a tablespoonful of hot water. Stuff 
and sew neatly. Eub butter on the outside to prevent blistering. 
Put a little water in the pan'. Eoast from two and a half to three 
hours. Baste with butter at the last. Bake a crisp brown. Cut 
off the first joint of the feet, chop them up together with the liver 
and heart, boil them tender, season with pepper, salt and sage. 
Roll bits of butter in flour, take some of the dripping from the 
pan and add to it. ,Thicken what is necessary and send to the 
table in a gravy-boat. A potato dressing with the addition of 
sage is sometimes used. Cut the head off, split the pig in halves 
and lay on the platter with dressing under it. The head and ears 
are sometimes used as decoration, but as this is displeasing to 
some tastes it is best to omit them. Garnish with parsley and 
blanched celery tops. Serve celery and fried apples with it. In 
In the south, where roast pig is a favorite dish, it is customary 
to stand the pig whole upon the platter with an apple, orange 
or ear of corn in its mouth. Garnish with roasted link sau- 
sage. 

Boiled Uam. — Soak a ham for twenty-four hours. Put over 
to boil for four or five hours in cold water. When done so that a 
lork penetrates easily, draw off the -skin. Strew rasped bread over 



MEAfS. 97 

it. Sprinkle thickly with sugar and bake one hour. This draws 
out part of the fat, and imparts a delicious flavor. 

If the ham is to be glazed omit the bread-crumbs in roaisting. 
Brush over with the yolk of a well-beaten egg. Dredge half an 
inch thick with powdered cracker, and cover with sweetened cream. 
Remove to the oven long enough to brown. Garnish with parsley. 

If to be simply boiled allow the ham to become cool in the 
water it was boiled in. In this way the juices are retained, thus 
preventing the dryness so common ia cold ham. A 15-pound ham 
requires boiling five hours. Cut writing paper in a fringe and 
twist around the shank bone before serving. 

The choicest parts of a ham are to be used for slicing. The 
remainder can be hashed for ham omelettes, ham toast, etc., for 
which see the appropriate departments. 

Pigs' Feet — To Clean. — Put the feet in cold water over 
night, then with a moderately sharp knife scrape until aU the parts 
are clean ^nd white. Hold the lower end in hot water for a minute 
or two, the hoofs can then' be twisted off by hand^ Singe, and 
they are ready to boil for souse or head cheese. The ears may be 
cleaned at the same time. Soak them for a number of days in salt 
water. , 

To Cook. — Boil them tender; be careful to keep the skin 
whole. Thiefy will need cooking three or four hours. They may 
then b^ used for pickling or split for broiling or frying. 

Soused Pigs' Feet. — Take pigs' feet and ears that have been 
boiled until tender. To half a dozen feet take 1 pint of vinegar, 1 
tablespoonful of salt, a little allspice, mace, and a few cloves and 
peppers. Put them in a jar and pour the spiced vinegar over 
boiling hot. Cover closely. They will be ready for use in 2 or 3 
days and will keep all winter. Soused feet may be eaten cold, or 
theymay be split in two, dipped in flour andfried brown in hot lard. 

Pressed Pigs' Feet. — ^Boil pigs' feet until the meat falls 
from the bones. Pick over carefully, separate into @mall pieces. 
Season highly with salt and pepper. Pack closely in jars. Pour 
in enough, of the liquor the feet were boiled in to moisten the 
meat. Put a heavy weight over until cold. Delicious sliced for 
lunch.

Pork Chops with Apples.— Put the chops in the frying pan, 
seasoning by sprinkling pepper, salt and a little sage over it. Pry 
sliced apples in the gravy, adding butter if there is not enough fat. 
Brown the apples and lay them over the chops. 

Toad in the Hole. — Roll half a pound of sausage into six 
Aalls; place these in a greased baking dish. Make a batter of 2 
eggs, 2 heaped up tablespoonfuls of flour and J pint of sweet milk. 
Pour this over the sausage, place in a moderately hot oven, bake 1 
hour. Serve with pork gravy and boiled or baked potatoes. _ a 
nice little dinner for two. 

Pressed Pig's Head — Spiced.— Have the head well cleaned. 
Boil imtU the meat will almost drop from the bones. Take up 
when cool. Cut the meat in inch bits. Heat it in a little of the 
liquor it was boiled in, and season highly with salt, pepper, cloves, 
nutmeg and cinnamon. Put in a jar and press with a plate with 
heavy weight, or pour into a strong bag. Put a heavy weight upon 
it, and let it remain till perfectly cold. Serve in thin slices. 

Ham Toast. — Chop cold boiled ham very fine, using but little 
of the fat, and prepare as follows: 

1 pint of chopped ham. 

2 eggs well-beaten. 

J- teacupful of sweet cream or nsilk. 

A little pepper, salt and ^ teaspoonful of dry mustard. 

Heat this mixture thoroughly. When boiling hot spread over 

slices of toasted bread dipped in hot salted water and well buttered. 

A very nice relish. Plain soft toast may have grated ham spread 

over it ^ inch thick. 

Pork Pie. — ^Boil tenderloin or backbone until done. Chop 
fine. Season with pepper, salt, sage and summer savory. Line a 
deep pudding dish with a rich crust, fiU with the meat, put in by 
layers and dredge each layer with flour. Pour in f cup of water 
(the flour is to thicken the gravy). Put on the upper crust making 
an opening for the escape of steam. Bake,

savory and parsley. Sage may be used instead of summer savory. 
Boil tlie meat until the bones slip out. Chop fine, mixing the 
spices thoroughly with the meat. Put the meat in deep dishes. 
Pour over what little liquor may remain. Press down with plates 
upon which heavy weights have been placed, and let stand until 
the meat is set. Take off when cold whatever fat may have 
pressed out, and turn the cheese over on plates. It will be clear 
and smooth as jelly. Instead of beef a knuckle of veal may be 
used. Some cooks use heart and part of a liver in place of the 
beef. 

Salt Pork Fried in Batter. — ^Freshen the pork by soaking 
over night in sweet skim milk. When ready for use dip in a bat- 
ter made of — 

1 egg. 

1 cup sweet milk. 

Flour to make a batter thick as for griddle cakes. 

Fry brown in lard or pork,gravy. 

Broiled Salt Pork. — Slice the pork and broil over a hot bed 
of coals, turning frequently. Have ready a bowl of c®ld wate; 
and at each turning dip the slices in the water. This will fresher 
the pork sufficiently, and at the same time give a certain crispness 
The last time omit the water and let the pork brown slightly 
Serve on a platter with bits of butter, or drawn butter poured 
around the meat. 

Mam Omelet. — Chop bits of cold ham finely. Season with 
butter, pepper and salt. Beat two or three eggs and stir with them 
over a good fire. Pieeesof beef may be used in the same fashion. 
In either case the dish is excellent. 

Bologna Sausage.— 

3 pounds of beef (lean). 

3 pounds of veal. 

3 pounds salt pork, bacon or ham. 

3 pounds of fresh pork. 

4 teaspoonfuls of black pepper. 

1 teaspoonful each of maee and Cayraine. 
10 teaspoonfuls of sage or summer savory. 
Powder before using. 



lOO THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Chop ihe meat very fine. Have well-cleaned beef intestines; 
fill, tie, prick and boil one hour gently. Dry in straw or smoke the 
same as hams. Keep in a cool, dry place. Slice for tea or lunch. 
If wished, either the veal or beef may be omitted, varying the 
spices to suit the diminished quantity. 

A variation of the above consists in packing the chopped and 
prepared meat in muslin cases nine or ten inches long, and about four 
wide. Tie securely and leave in a ham pickle for five days; then 
smoke eight days. Hang in a cool, dark place. 

Sausage. — 

50 pounds finely chopped pork. 

12 ounces salt. 

4 ounces ground black pepper. 

4 ounces sage or summer savory. 

2 ounces saltpetre. 
1^ pounds of fat meat to 3 pounds of lean is in excellent 
proportion for sausage. The sausage is better to be one-half beef. 
Mix well, pack in pans and cover thickly with warm lard; loosen 
this when necessary and then, press carefully back. The prepared 
sausage meat may be stuffed into prepared intestines or muslin 
bags. (See Bologna Sausage.) A little flour mixed with the meat 
tends to prevent the fat running out when cooked. ' 

Beef Sausage. — In summer very good sausage may be made 
,>f raw beef with a little salt pork. Season as above, omitting the 
saltpetre. Of course this should be made in small quantities. 

Iiard — To Eender. — Cut the fat in small pieces, either the 
leaf or the side pork. Put in 1 pint of water to a No. 8 kettle full 
of lard. Simmer slowly, stirring frequently and watching that it 
does not bum. When the scraps are just beginning to get brittle 
and brown add a tablespoonful of fine salt to a quart of the lard, 
and the lard will keep perfectly sweet for any length of time. By 
knowing the size of the kettle used it will be easy to estimate the 
quantity of sa,lt required. The salt does no possible harm to any 
kind of ceokery, and makes the lard whiter and harder. Let it 
cook slowly for a short time after adding the salt. Strain through 
a coarse cloth, always squeezing the last drops into a separate jar 
for common uses. Di^the cloth ia boiling water now and then to

free from grease. Earthenware should be used for holding tlie 
lard and several small vessels are preferable to a single large one, 
as preventing the necessity of disturbing the entire quantity each 
time. The jars may be covered mth bladders or cloths dipped in 



Lard— To Sweeten. — Eut the tainted lard in a kettle and 
cut salt pork in thin slices, ^ pound of pork to a gallon of 
melted lard. Add 2 spoonfuls of salt and cook until the pork ' is 
crisp. Remove the slices of pork, turn the lard into a jar, and it 
will be found perfectly sweet. The use of salt, however, will pre- 
vent all such trouble. Some housewives substitute sliced Irish 
potatoes, raw; the pork will be found preferable. 

To Prepare Sansage for Summer. — Grind and season as 
for present use. Make into cakes and fry until the water is thor- 
oughly out. Then turn all into a jar, packing the cakes carefully,. 
Let stand until cold, then melt fresh lard and pour over it until 
the lard is 2 inches above the meat. The lard taken from the j ir 
must be heated and poured back, thus keeping air from the re- 
maining sausage. This is a rare dish. The surplus lard in, the 
jar is better for frying chicken, mush, etc., than aiiy other. This 
will keep a long time. 

CURING MB.AT8. 

Brine or Pickle for Beef, Ham^ Shoulder or Mutton.- 

50 pounds of meat. 

3 gallons of water. 

7^ pounds Turk Island salt. 

1 quart molasses. 

1|- pounds brown sugaf. 

1| ounces saltpetre. 

1 ounce baking soda. 
Bring to a boil, skim and let cool. The pickle can be used as 
long as fresh and sweet. 

A piece of beef remaining in this a few days makes the finest 
corn beef. If it remains in several weeks, it should be soaked over 
rdght before using. A round of beef put in this pickle for 4 weeks, 
and then dried slowly in a cool place, maJkes superior dried beef. 



I02 THREE MEALS A DAY. • 

A handful each of mace and cloves thrown into the brine will 
improve the flavor of the meat. If it is desired to give the meat 
a red color, nearly six times as much saltpetre must be used. 

Pork should never be put in pickle until 2 days after IdUing, 
and during this time it should be lightly sprinkled with powdered 
saltpetre, which wiU remove all surface blood and make the meat 
Bweet and dean. Three months will pickle it to perfection, though 
it may be smoked sooner. In packing pork cover the bottom of 
the barrel with coarse salt, then lay on it first the hams with the 
outside down, sprinkling them well on the flesh side with fine salt, 
then put in the shoulders; in the same way above these the side 
pieces. 

The fire for smoking meat should never be allowed to spring 
into a blaze. Heat will start the fat of the meat and damage it, 
BiBfore warm weather brings flies, the meat should be taken down, 
each piece rubbed over with pepper and molasses and hung up 
again. Continue smoking, and repeat this operation 2 or 3 times, 
and there will be no trouble with insects. 

. To Restore Pork. — In warm weather, the briue on pork 
frequently becomes sour, and the pork tainted. Pour ofE the brine, 
boil'it, skim it well, then pour it back again upon the meat, boiling 
hct. This will restore it, even where it was much injured. 

To Cure Hams. — 

1 ounce saltpetre to each ham. 

1 pint of pure molasses to 1 pound of saltpetre. 

^ pound of salt to each pint of molasses. 

Heat the mixture almost to the boiling point, and while hot 
rub into the meat well, especially around the bones. Let the 
hams lie one week, then place in a strong salt brine three weeks. 
Eemove, soak eight hours in fresh water, hang and dry two weeks. 
Smoke three to five days, according to size. Then wrap in strong 
tar paper and tie close. !Next tie in cotton cloth bags. Separate 
the paper from the cloth by stuffing in shavings or. sr^dust. Hang 
near the roof.

Mmsm ^ G^e^METTis,^ 



4 ;*"»-' EFT-OVERB" are h necessary part of all comlortafele, not 
I I to mention abundant housekeeping. To utili^ze tkese in 
«'' *■ an appetizing, and at the same time economical way, is 
one of the accomplishments of all good house-wives. 

And, indeed, the dainty dishes, the curries, the smllops, the 
ragouts and the hashes that may be satisfactorily prepared by a 
skilled hand from such materials will be approved by the most 
critical epicure. 

But since the same preparations may,' through inexperience, 
become unwholesome and unpalatable mysteries, too much atten,;- 
tion cannot be paid to the simple and explicit rules given here for 
the preparation of these important compounds. 

Beef Bissoles. — Chop and season cold roast beef; season 
with salt, pepper and tomato catsup or a little prepared mustard. 
Make some plain pastry, roll very thin, and cut into pieces 4 
inches square; inclose in each, some of the prepared beef, and 
fold one edge of the paste over like a turnover ; drop in hot lard 
and fry like doughnuts to a very light brown. 

The paste can scarcely be rolled too thin. A delicious break- 
fast or side-dish. Eoast mutton, veal and even pork can be served 
in like manner. 

Hash with Eggs. — Chop the remnants of cold boiled mut- 
ton or veal very fine ; heat in a very little of the broth, adding 
pepper, salt and butter; toast slices of bread amd spread this hash 
upon them. Break eggs into boiling water; when cooked lay one 
over the hash upon each slice of toast. This is very nice. 

Spanish Hash.— 

1 cup finely chopped cold meat. 
1 cup raw tomatoes, cut in bits. 
1 common sized onion, chopped. 

(103) 



I04 THREE MEAtS A DAY. 

Season with salt, finely chopped red pepper pods, and butter 
if the meat is quite lean. Cook until the tomatoes are done. If 
too thin, thicken with breaa or cracker crumbs. 

Hashed Beef.— Take 2 pounds of cold cooked beef, free 
from sinew and bone, and chop well. Peel and chop 2 onions, 
put in the frying-pan with 2 tablespoonfuls of butter. When he- 
ginning to color lightly add the beef, a little salt, pepper, nutmeg 
if liked, and a pinch of thyme. Place over the fire and stir ten 
minutes, moistening with a little boiling water. Just before 
serving sprinkle 'with a little powdered or chopped parsley. 

Meat and Potato Hash.— Cold com beef is considered best 
for this, but other meats answer as well; indeed, a' mixture of two 
or more kinds adds to the flavor. Chop the meat fine, carefully 
removing superfluous bits of gristle and sinew. Use half as much 
meat as of boiled potatoes. Put a little boiling water in a sauce-pan, 
together with a good- sized piece of butter. Season the chopped 
meat and potatoes, and put in the saucepan. Let this cook well, 
stirring occasionally. It will adhere to the pan slightly when 
done, and should be neither watery nor dry. For many the hash 
is improved by the addition of a finely chopped onion. Hash 
may be served very tastefully for breakfast by spreading an inch 
or more in thickness upon slices of buttered toast. Mustard should 
be served with it. Hash is very nice moistened with mOk instead 
of water. 

Mutton Hashed. — Cut the cold mutton in small pieces; if 
underdone, so much the better; season well. Boil the bones and 
rough trimmings of the meat in sufficient water to cover them ; 
strain the gravy into a stewpan, add the mutton and any .cold veg- 
etables that may be on handj carrots, turnips and potatoes sliced, 
and a little minced onion. Let simmer and finally boil up once 
before serving. Tomatoes are nice to use. Other meats may be 
served in the same manner. 

Meat Scrapie. — Boil the meat until it falls from the bones. 
Use any kind. Hog's head, liver, heart and feet, are very good used 
together. The cheaper parts of beef may be utUized also. Remove 
aU the bones. Chop fine. Season well with salt and pepper and 
any sweet herbs liked. Skim and strain the liquor it was cooked 



HASH. 105 

in. Eeturn the meat and let it boil up, then thicken to the con- 
sistency of musih with corn-meal. Dip-^i^^t-in a pan or deep dish. 
Slice when cold and fry brown like mush'. Nice, cold or hot, for 
a breakfast dish or for lunch. If a quantity is made, it can be 
preserved by pouring melted lard over the top. 

A nice way of using cold mea,t is to chop fine and stir into a 
kettle of corn-meal mush. Slice this simpler scrapie and fry as 
abov^. 

Meat Omelet. — Chop fine, add pepper and salt with a little 
water. Set over the fire and let it simmer, not boil, ten or fifteen 
minutes, then break 2 or 3 eggs in it, stirring all till the eggs are 
cooked. Proportion the eggs to the quantity of mea,t. Different 
kinds of meat may be used together. 

Meat Scallop. — Chop the cold meat fine, either one er 
more kinds just as it happens. Season with salt and a littk 
Cayenne. Mix with a few bread-crumbs. Pill the pudding dish. 
Moisten with broth or milk. Cover with a thick layer of mashed 
potatoes. Dust cracker or bread-crumbs over this and bake ^ hour, 
browning the top. Corn beef is very nice prepared in this way. 

Bechaiilfe of Cold Meat.— 

1 large cupful of cold chopped meat, any vasiet]^ 

1^ cupfuls of raw potatoes„ehopped. 

1 small onion, minced fine. 

Dessert spoonful of butter. 

1 teaspoonful of salt, ^ as much pepper. 

Parsley. 

Simmer the meat fifteen minutes in water enough to cover. 
Then add the onion, potatoes and seasoning. Cook half an hour 
longer, then add the butter and parsley. The potatoes should 
furnish the needed thickening, but a little flour may be added. / 

Cold Meats. — Cold meats may be naade very inviting by slic- 
ing thinly, arranging upon the platter and garnishing with parsley 
or cress around the edge and between the slices. 

Deyiled Beef. — Take slices of cold roast beef, if underdone, 
so much the better. Broil over hot coals. Season highly with 
pepper. Serve with a small lump of butter on each piece'. 

Beefsteak Pie. — Cut cold beefsteak or any other cold beef 



Io6 THREB MEAtS A OAY. 

in small pieces. Peel and slice an equal amount of raw potatoes. 
Take a deep dish, put in a layer of potatoes, then one of meat, 
and so on until the dish is filled. Season as you would chicken pie. 
Pour in a cup of boiling water. Milk is very nice to use. Cover 
with plain crust and bake one hour. A crust of richly seasoned' 
mashed potatoes may be used instead. 

Tomato Meat Pie. — Cover the bottom of a pudding dish 
with bread-crumbs, then a layer of cold roast mutton chopped fine, 
then a layer of tomatoes sliced, repeat as before, having the last 
layer crumbs. Season each layer highly. A dash of Cayenne is 
an improvement, and bits of butter with each layer of crumbs. 
Bake until browned. Serve hot. Very nice. 

Hotch Fotch. — Equal parts of cold boiled meat, cold boiled 
potatoes chopped, and stale bread. Mix well and enclose in a 
crust as for chicken pie. Moisten with milk, or boiling water, or 
broth. Bake ^ hour. A crust of mashed potatoes spread over, 
or simply a thick layer of bread-crumbs dotted with bits of butter, 
may be used instead of pastry. 

Ragout of Cold Yeal. — Cut boiled or roasted veal in nice 
slices. Flour and fry in butter till a light brown. Take up and 
turn a little hot water into the butter they were fried in. Mix 
a little flour or water together and stir into the gravy. Season 
with salt, pepper and lemon juice, or catsup. Slice in an onion 
if desired. Put in the meat and stew until very hot. Serve. 

Deviled Ham. — Pry slices of cold boiled ham. Keep wann 
while stirring into the gravy 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, mixed 
with 1 teaspoonful of mustard, 1 teaspoonful of sugar, ^ teaspoon- 
ful of catsup. Let this boil up once, and pour over the ham. 

Beef Balls. — Mince cold roast beef (rare cooked is better). 
Add 2 cups of mashed potatoes to 1 of minced beef, yolk of 1 egg, 
2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of sweet milk. Form into flat cakes. Dredge 
with flour and fry until nicely browned in hot beef dripping. 
Garnish with parsley. A very little minced onion is an addition. 
Instead of frying they may be browned in a hot oven fifteen 
minutes. 

Minced Ham with Eggs.— Mix | a pound of cracker-crumbs 
with an equal quantity of finely-minced lean boiled ham. Moisten 



HASH. 107 

this mixture mih a little hot water in which a small piece of butter 
is dissolved. Put the mixture in a baking dish. Make depressions 
in it. Place in each the yolk and white of 1 egg. Bake a delicate 
brown. Any other meat hash may be served in the same way. ' 
Minced Veal.— 

1^ cups rich milk. 

1 tablespoonful cornstarch. 

1 tablespoonful of butter creamed with the cornstarch. 

1 teaspoonful minced parsley. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 
Heat the milk to scalding and pour over the cornstarch and 
butter, stirring smoothly. Turn this over 2 cupfuls of minced 
cold veal (lean). Let it boil up once and pour over slices of but- 
tered toast. This dressing may be used in the same way for cold 
fowl. 

Beef Fricasseed. — Cut cold roast beef in small pieces. Put 
in a stewpan with a good-sized piece of butter, some finely-minced 
onion, a little water with salt and curry powder (see Soups) to 
taste. Simmer fifteen minutes and serve hot with a ring of boiled 
rice surrounding it. Omit the curry powder and chop a small 
onion with it instead if preferred. 

GROQURTTRS. 

Croquettes may be fried in almost any kind of sweet drip- 
ping. Always remember the fat should be hot, the croquette well- 
breaded, and the whole fried quickly and neatly so that no sus- 
picion of grease may remain. 

If the croquette has been mixed with egg, simple breading or 
rolling in bread or cracker crumbs will be sufficient, otherwise dip 
first in egg and then in crumbs. 

Stale beead should be cut in slices, dried in the oven, crushed 
with a rolling pin and put away in a jar. It will be much better 
for frying oysters, croquettes, cutlets or thickening soups than 
cracker dust. 

Ckoqxjettes are to be fried in a quantity of fat in the same 
manner as doughnuts. 

Fat that is boiling will not penetrate anything, and cooks to 



Io8 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

perfection, forming an almost instantaneous crust over the article 
that effectually prevents the absorption of any grease. For dough- 
nuts, croquettes, etc., follow the same rule. 

Ckoquettes should be served on a folded napkin laid on a 
plate. Direct contact with a plate renders them heavy. 

Croquettes of Calves' Brains.— 
1 cupful of bread-crumbs. 
Butter the size of an egg. 
Yolk of 1 egg. 

1 tablespoonf ul of chopped parsley. 
1 tablespoonf ul of vinegar or a little lemon juice. 
Salt, pepper and a little nutmeg. 

Simmer the brains (about ^ pound) in salted water for twenty 
minutes. Put them in cold water and peel off the dark outer 
membrane. (This is better done the day before.) Chop them up 
and mash with all the other ingredients. Make up in rolls or flat 
cakes. Dip first in beaten egg, then in crumbs and fry. Cook 
them well. Serve with cream sauce. Drain in a hot colander. 
Serve hot or cold. Garnish with parsley or cress. The sauce can 
be omitted. 

Chicken Croquettes.-^ About ^ as much fine bread-crumbs 
as meat; 1 egg beaten light to each cupful of minced meat; gravy 
enough to moisten; pepper, salt and chopped parsley to taste. 
Mix into a paste. Make into rolls or balls, roll in fine cracker 
dust and fry in nice dripping or a mixture of half lard and half 
butter. Drain in a hot colander or lay on a folded towel or brown 
paper. Garnish with parsley. Veal and other meats may be made 
in the same way. ' ' 

Fish Croquettes. — Any cold fish boiled, baked or fried from 
which aU fat, bones and skin have been removed, chopped fine; ^ 
as much mashed potato rubbed to a, cream with a little butter. 
Mix thoroughly, make in balls, dip in beaten egg, roll in cradier 
or bread-dust and fry as before directed. Serve with pickles. 
Walnuts (pickled) are nice. 

Shad Koe Croquettes. — Make same as above. 

Lobster Croquettes.— 

1 fine lobster well boiled or 1 can of lobster. . 



HASH. 109 



2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter. 
1 teacupful of bread-crumbs. 
Salt and Cayenne pepper to taste . 
Chop the lobster meat fine, add bread-crumbs, the seasoning 
and Uie butter. Mix with the yolk of 1 egg. Make into oblong 
croquettes. Beat the remainder of the eggs and dip the croquettes 
first in them and then in bread-crumbs and fry to a light brown. ; 
Drain off fat by laying upon a hot clean paper before dishing. 
Ham Croquettes.,— 

1 cup ham, minced. 

2 cupf uls potatoes. 

1 cup bread-crumbs. 
1 teaspoonful butter. 
1 egg. 
' Mix; make into flat round cakes, roll in bread-crumbs and fry 
in hot fat. 

Potato Croquettes. — Make same as Potato Balls. Serve 
with fish. Cold mashed potatoes may be used. 

Rice Croquettes. — Make same as Eice Fritters. See Fritters. 

Sweet-bread Croquettes. — Bon 2 pair of sweet-breads in 
salted water a few minutes ; cut up ; cut also |- can of mushrooms 
into dice; if fresh ones are used, parboil; add IJ tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter and 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, let cook together; then 
add 1 gill of cream or soup- stock. When hot, stir in the cut 
sweet-breads and mushrooms; when heated through add the beaten 
yolks of 2 eggs; allow them to set without boiling. When cold, 
form in rolls or balls ; dip in egg, then in cracker crumbs, and fry 
in boiling lard or dripping. Garnish with curled lettuce or pars- 
ley. A very nice dish for parties. 

Veal Croquettes. — To 1 pint of chopped cold veal (beef may 
be used) add ^ pint of cream, or rich milk may be used; to this 
quantity put 1 tablespoonful butter creamed with one tablespoon- 
ful flour. Put all save the meat over the fire to thicken; season 
it to taste, and pour over the meat; mix thoroughly and form into 
shape; roll in bread or cracker crumbs and fry brown, or, if pre- 
ferred, bake. 



no THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Oyster Croquettes.— 

1 quart of oysters, minoed. 
-1 cup of cream or milk, 

1 tablespoonful of butter rubbed in 

4 tablespoonf uls of com starch. 

Pepper and salt to taste. 
Heat the cream (a double boiler is best for such things); when 
it boils, add the butter and com starch, stirring constantly, 
when perfectly smooth add the oysters and seasoning. Cook five 
minutes; when cold roll into croquettes. When perfectly firm dip 
in beaten egg, roU in cracker crumbs and fry in boUing fat. Gar- 
nish with sliced lemons. Oyster croquettes may be made same as 
Lobster Croquettes. 

Green Com Croquettes. — See Green Com Oysters, or Green 
Corn Griddle Cakes (vegetable). Canned com may be used; chop 
fine. 

Breakfast Relish. — Slice the cold roast beef thinly. Make 
a gravy with seasoning as follows : 

3 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

1 tablespoonful walnut or tomato catsup. 

1 tablespoonful of vinegar. 

1 teaspoonful currant jelly. 

1 teaspoonful made mustard. 
Put meat and all in a saucepan, cover and set in a kettle of 
water; steam half an hour, keeping the water in the outer v«ssel 
boiling all the time. Very nice, especially if the beef is uT \ei- 
done beforehand. 





eGGS may be packed and preseryed in several ways. 
Brine for Eggs.— 
1 pint of slaked lime. 

1 pint of salt. 

2 ounces cream-tartar. 
4 gallons of water. 

Dip the eggs in melted tallow and cover with this brine. This 
tule is sufficient for 200 eggs. Pack them with small end down. 

Packing Eggs.— Dip in warm linseed oil. Dry and pack in a 
eool place. Pack in old oats, new ones will heat and spoil the 
eggs. Kegs or wooden boxes may be used. Set them upon sticks 
that there may be a free circulation of air. Begin about August 1 
to pack the freshly-gathered eggs, Using Lfcose packed first when 
any are needed. 

A COATING of sweet oil and beeswax, 2 parts of oil to 1 of 
beeswax, is highly recommended. 

In breaking eggs, break them separately over a cup to be sure 
they are perfect. 

Egg shells may be used to settle coffee. 

Theee minutes will boil eggs very soft. Five minutes will 
cook aU hard except the yolk. New-laid eggs need one-half 
minute longer. Eight or ten minutes will boil perfectly hard for 
slicing. 

Eggs dropped in a dish of cold water will lie upon the side if 
fresh. 

Eggs broken in water may be prevented from "sticking" to 
the pan by keeping the pan in motion nntil nearly cooked. 

There is no more wholesonae article of food than eggs prop- 
erly prepared, and it is impossible not to consider a raw egg far more 



112 THREE MEAI,S A DAY. 

indigestible than a cooked one. A large proportion ot albumen is 
the most important single element pf food in their composition. 

Smothered Eggs. — Pnt not quite as much hot butter and 
lard, or ham dripping in a pan as for frying eggs in the ordinary 
way. Break the eggs to be used on a plate, and when the fat is hot 
slip them into the frying pan evenly, not on one side, or the grease 
will slip out from under and they wUl stick to the pan. Sprinkle 
with pepper and salt. Pour over them a teacupful of boiUng 
water. Cover quickly with a closely fitting lid. Let them steam 
four or five minutes, or more, according to the degree of hardness 
required* They wiU be found nicely whitened over the top like 
eggs th?|.t have been dropped in boiling water, and much more 
palatable than those poached without fat. 

Poached Eggs. — To 3 pints of water add 1 tablespoonful of 
vinegar, and ^ teaspoonful salt. Use a shallow saucepan with muffin 
rings laid on the bottom. Break one egg into each ring, as this 
keeps the shape of the egg. Poach from three to five minutes. 
Take up carefully and serve on delicately toasted shces of bread 
that have been dipped in hot water and buttered. The vinegar and 
gait sets the whites of the egg quickly. Instead of toast, the eggs 
may be served carefully on a platter. Sprinkle with salt and 
pepper and dot with bits of butter. The water should be boihng. 

soar Eggs — German Style. — 1 tablespoonful butter, 1 
tablespoonful flour stirred into the butter in a hot saucepan until 
well browned, J- teacup vinegar filled up with water. Salt and 
pepper to taste. Pour into the browned fllour and let boil up. 
Break the eggs in, one at a time, until the pan is full. Baste the 
top with this gravy until the eggs are cooked, either hard or soft, 
according to the taste. 

Egg Ericassee.— Slice the requisite number of hard-boiled 
eggs. Pile lightly in a dish and pour over them the following 
gravy or sauce. 

1 tablespoonful of flour. 

1 tablespoonful of butter rubbed smoothly; in one 
pint of water. 

Season to taste. Milk may be used instead of water to the 
great improvement of the dish. 



EGGS. 113 

Pickled Eggs— Spiced.— Take as many hard-boiled eggs as 
will fill a small jar. When cold remove the shells and pack closely. 
Scald some of the best vinegar with pepper, allspice, olovos and 
stick cinnamon, whole. Pour this boiling hot over the eggs, leaving 
the spice in. Be sure that the eggs are completely covered with 
the vinegar. Fasten up the jar for a month, sealing if necessary 
they will then be ready for use. At any time after being opened, 
if they should not be sufficiently sharp, renew the vinegar. Serve 
with cold meat. 

Pickled Eggs. Plain. — Boil hard, remove the shell and 
cover with boiling hot vinegar. Let it stand twelve hours, and 
they are ready for use. Some cut the eggs in halves lengthwise. 
Nice for picnics, lunch, etc. 

Deviled Eggs. — Eemove the shells from hard-boiled eggs; 
cut about ^ from the small end of each. Take out the yolks, mash 
with the pieces of whites and season highly with salt, pepper, mus- 
tard, a tablespoonful of melted butter, (salad oil if preferred) and a 
httle vinegar. Mix thoroughly and fill into the cavities left by the 
yolks. FiU it all in, heaping each egg up well. Set each one on 
a lettuce leaf, and stand close together On a pretty flat dish. Very 
ornamental for lunch or evening party. Gut off a slice from the 
whites that they may stand firmly. 

Egg-Baskets. — Boil eggs hard, shell and cut neatly in half. 
Remove the yolks and rub them to a paste with melted butter, 
pepper and salt. Chop v6ry fine the meat of cold fowl, ham, dried 
beef or veal, and mix with the egg paste. Out off a slice from the 
hollow white to make them stand, fill with the paste, arrange close 
together on a flat dish and pour over them a gravy heated boiling 
hot, or cream sauce. If to be served with cold meats, omit the 
gravy and garnish with parsley. Nice for lunch or parties. 

Egg Toast. — Beat 4 eggs thoroughly, put 2 tablespoonfuls 
butter into a saucepan, when melted pour in the eggs. Stir con- 
stantly, adding a little salt. When thoroughly hot spread on slices 
of buttered toast. Serve at once. 

Shirred Eggs.— 
6 eggs. 
S tablespoonfuls of gravy,ehicken, turkey er reast beef. 



114 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

1 teaspoonful of butter. 

4 or 5 slices of fried toast. 

1 heaping tablespoonful grated cheese. 
Melt the butter. When hot break into this the eggs, stir in 
the gravy, eheese and seasoning. Stir quickly from the bottom, 
until the whole is a soii; yellow mass. Have ready in the dish 
slices of fried toast. Heap the shirred eggs upon this, and serve 
before it hardens. 

Scalloped Eggs.— 

6 eggs. 

5 spoonfuls minced ham, (other cold meat may be 

used). 
1 spoonful chopped parsley. 
I spoonful minced onion. 
3 spoonfuls cream. 
1 spoonful mqlted butter. 

J cupful bread-crumbs, moistened ydth milk and a 
spoonful melted butter. 
Line the bottom of a small deep dish, well buttered, with the 
soaked bread-crumbs, put upon these a layer of the ham with the 
onions and parsley. Set in the oven covered until smoking hot. 
Beat the eggs thoroughly, stir in the cream and 1 spoonful of 
melted butter, pour over the ham ; put the dish uncovered back 
into the oven and bake until the eggs are done. 

Scrambled Eggs.— Beat the eggs thoroughly, adding 1 table- 
spoonful of sweet milk for each egg. Season with pepper and salt 
and melt 1 teaspoonful of butter in a frying pan. Turn the eggs 
in, stir constantly until a light yellow mass. Serve quickly. 

Baked Eggs. — Break the eggs carefully into a buttered dish, 
sprinkle with pepper and salt, put a bit of butter on each and bake 
until the whites are well set. The eggs may be broken separately 
into g^n irons, seasoned as above and baked. 

Ham and Eggs Fried.— Fry the ham nicely, break the eggs 
carefully into the gravy. Baste the eggs with the dripping, using 
a spoon, until the yolka are eeared. When suiEcieniily cooked ar- 
lange on a platter \nth the bam and serve.

a cupful of cream or milk slightly thickened with cornstarch, and 
a teaspoonful of sugar; simmer a few minutes. Then lay in 6 or 
8 hard-boiled eggs cut in halves or quarters. Heat through, not 
boiling. Cocoa milk instead of cream improves the dish. Serve 
with rice.

be always bright and smooth and thus prevent any trouble in turn- 
ing out. 

Omelet — Plain. — 4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten sepa- 
rately, 2 tablespoonfuls of milk; 1 teaspoonful cornstarch. Dissolve 
the cornstarch in the milk, season with pepper and salt. Turn

like a plain one. Put over a slower fire, as it scorches easily. 
Loosen from the bottom and sides of the pan occasionally with a 
knife. Turn upon a hot dish, sift with powdered sugar and serve 
immediately, as it falls quickly. For an omelet mixed in this 
manner ten minutes will suffice to cook nicely. This makes a

SAUCES are done -when they boil from the side of the pan. 
Olive Oil should always be added to a salad dressing be- 
fore the vinegar is used, to prevent curdling; then add tiie 
vinegar, stirring constantly. 

Melted Butter, not hot, may be substituted for salad or olive 
oil. 

A "Wooden Spoon, or fork is best to stir salads, and a wooden 
paddle, or even a stick, is better for gravies or sauces than a metal 
spoon. 

Keep a stalk of parsley growing all winter with the other 
house plants. A sprig from it now and then will be found very 
convenient for seasoning soups and gravies. 

The most common sweet herbs used in flavoring are thyme, 
mint, sweet marjoram, summer savory and sage. To prepare 
these, as well as parsley for winter use see Soups. 

BtJTTER, and sauces containing eggs, should never boil, but 
simply come up to a cream. 

Pkuit used for catsups should be perfect. Cook in porcelain 
kettles; bottle in glass or stone jars. Never use tin. 

Salads may be garnished with the whites of hard-boiled eggs 
cut in rings and laid each on a small lettuce leaf arranged on the 
edge of the dish, or hard-boiled eggs may be simply sliced and 
placed around the dish. 

Celery may be fringed by sticking several needles into a cork 
and ooKiibing the celery with this, or it may be split up with a sharp 
knife. Cut the celery in pieces two inches long., Throw in cold 
water to curl.

an hour or two. 

Lettuce. — Arrange fresh crisp lettuce leaves in a deep dish. 
Slice hard-boiled eggs ove(r the top. Serve with vinegar, sugar and 
a pinch of salt.

Water Cress Salad. — Wash and pick over the cress, shake 
off the moisture and serve. At table pick the twigs apart and 
season with sugar, pepper, salt, vinegar and oil. This, with 
crackers and cheese, is sufficient for one course. A window garden 
of cress kept growing through the winter will be found very useful 
for salads and garnishes. 

Hot Lettuce Salad. — j cup sour cream, fill the cup with 
vinegar, 1 egg well beaten; turn all into a frying pan with a little 
melted butter, or dripping, and a pinch of salt. Have the lettuce

tizingand artistic effect of the whole table; though it is 
never wipe to carry the art of garnishing or decorating any 
dish to an extreme. 

HoLLANDAisE POTATOES fof instance, while very tasteful would 
be a useless waste of time and labor for any but state occasions. 

The simple spray of green that is in reach of all, will add a 
charm to the plainest repast. 

A List of the garnitures most commonly used is given below.

the iish itself. Curled lettuce may be arranged in clusters around 
the edge of the platter with spaces between, or with sliced lemons 
or beets. 

Feied Oysters may be arranged in a double row around the 
edge of the platter and two or three served with fish. 

Sheep-Soreel is pretty and appropriate. Fennel (garden) is

Table decorations require study. They are only an improve- 
ment when appropriate. A few slices of lemon, or rings of the_ 
whites of boiled eggs, a bit of cress, celery or thyme, are an appe- 
tizing addition to the yiands of a neat and weU-arranged tablfe. 
However, they are not indispensable and may at all times be 
omitted.

fiOTATOES for baking should be pricked before putting in the 
oven to allow the escape of steam, and thus prevent burst- 
ing. 

Vegetables of all kinds are better for being kept in cold water 
a short time after being prepared for cooking. This is especially 
nice for cabbage, cauliflower and pared potatoes. 

Catiliflowek should be tied up in a piece of white mosquito 
netting, to preserve its shape while boiling. 

Canned Vegetables are safer to be opened and turned into a 
strainer before cooking. Pour a cup of cold water over them and 
let drain thoroughly. Do this at least an hour before cooking al- 
lowing the air to have free access to them. Even with tomatoes 
this is necessary as it completely removes the juices that may have 
caught some corrosive quality from the can itself. Canned peas, 
corn, beans and asparagus should always be prepared in this way. 

Onions may be peeled without the slightest annoyance, by 
holding them under water while handling and slicing. 

Dkied Cokn should be soaked over night. 

Vegetables are usually put in boiling water, unless expressly 
stated otherwise. 

Pekfeotlt fresh vegetables nieed boiling less time than those 
that have been kept. 

Cold sliced potatoes are better for sprinkling a tablespoonful 
of flour over them while frying. 

Fried Cabbage is better if a little flour is stirred in five min- 
utes before serving. 

Old and Pooe Potatoes are greatly improved by paring and 
soaking them in cold water for several hours previous to boiling. 
Good potatoes should be cooked without peeling.

Watbk, Potatoes should have a piece of lime as large as a 
hen's egg pv(t in the kettle, however watery the potatoes may 
have been when the water is poured off the potatoes will be per- 
fectly dry and mealy. 

CABBAfflE may have its disagreeable odor, while boiling, entire- 
ly done away with by tying a lump of charcoal in cloth and drop- 
ping in the kettle with it. 

Greens boiling may have the odor absorbed by tying a piece 
of bread the size of an egg in cloth and dropping in the kettle. 

■ Asparagus if very tender may be tied in bunches and set up in 
water, leaving the tops above to be cooked by steam; in this way 
they will not boil to pieces. 

Goon Potatoes when cut will show a light cream color, and a 
white froth will be the result of rubbing the cut surfaces together. 
Eeject that variety where drops of water appear. Select those of 
uniform size to cook together. 

Baked Potatoes if wanted in a hurry may be partially boiled, 
then baked. 

Cooking Vegetables too long ruins the flavor, and it is usual- 
ly better not to have too much water left to pour off. 

Potatoes sliced in each kettle full of doughnuts will keep the 
odor from penetrating the house, and the lard from burning. 

Cabbage may be kept sweet and good for winter by making a 
brine strong enough to hold up an egg; then cut the heads of cab- 
bage in halves and put in the brine. Press down. 

Vegetables that are strong can be made much milder by ty- 
ing a bit of bread in a clean doth and boiling with them. 

Serving Vegetables. — These should be cooked with care that 
their flavor may be preserved. 

Baked Potatoes, or those boiled in the skin should have a 
large folded napkin laid in the dish, the comers turned over them, 
to keep them from becoming soggy. A smaller fringed napkin 
should line the dish containing Saratoga potatoes for the same 
pui-pose. 

Mashed Potatoes should be rounded up and dotted with black 
pepper. 

A LiTTLF minced parsley is pretty strewn over stewed potatoeB. 



148 THRE^ MEALS A DAY. 

Silver vegetable dishes will be found very desirable as aside 
from the danger of breakage attendant on china, a silTer dish 
well heated will keep food hot for a much longer time. 

POXATOB.S. 

Steamed Potatoes.— Take good potatoes and steam with the 
skins on, ped by tbe aid of knife and fork, place in a tureen or 
platter, spread butter over them freely, sprinkle with salt and 
p^per. Set in the oven to melt the butter. Very nice but much 
better if a cup of sweet cream is turned over them just before serv- 
ing. 

Mashed Potatoes. — Peel, boil, drain and mash fine, season 
with salt. Butter and milk or cream are good additions, but vig- 
orous pounding with the addition of a little hot water will make an 
extra dish. The secret of mashing potatoes is to have aU the 
utensils hot as possible. 

Mashed Potatoes, (II). — Boil 8 medium sized potatoes, mash 
fine with potato masher, then add a cup of hot mUk in which a 
tablespoonful of butter has been melted, 1 teaspoonful of salt and 
^ teaspoonful of white pepper, beat up with a fork or spoon until 
perfectly light and smooth, at least five minutes, turn into a dish 
and serve. A wooden spoon is best. 

Boiled Potatoes. — Peel carefully, removing all black specks, 
and lay in cold water an hour before using. Put over boiling wa- 
ter allowing 1 teaspoonful of salt to each quart. Boil steadily. 
When done, drain off the water, cover with a clean cloth and dry 
at the back of the stove about ten minutes, shaking the saucepan 
two or three times. This method will ensure dryness. Bermuda 
potatoes may be cooked as above, leaving the peeling on. Peel 
and serve whole. 

Potato Snow. — ^Boil potatoes as directed above. Mash and 
prepare according to Mashed Potatoes 11. Eub through a heated 
colander into a deep dish that it may fall lightly and in good shape. 
Put in the oven a few minutes till heated and serve very hot. 

Potato Balte Baked. — Boil and mash as before, and form 
immediatdy into baUs the size of an egg. Butt^ a dripping-paa 



VEGETABLES. 14-9 

(a sheet of tin is better). Brush over the balls with the yolk of' 
an egg, and brown quickly in a hot oven for five or ten minutes. 
Slip off with a knife on a hot platter and serve at once. 

Potatoes Saked in Milk— Dutch Style.— Cut enough pota- 
toes in thick slices to half fill a deep dish or two quart pan. Drop 
in butter the size of an egg cut into bits', a teaspoonful of salt and 
a tablespoonful of parsley. FUl the pan up with mUk and bake 
two hours. The mUk remaining in the pan should be thick as 
cream and the potato a light brown on top. 

Scalloped Potatoes. — Prepare as for potatoes baked in 
mUk, and cover the top with a thick layer of bread-crumbs with 
bits of butter. Turn in 1 cup of rich milk. Cover and bake 2 
hours, removing the cover and browning. 

Stuffed Potatoes. — Mince some cold meat very fine and season 
to taste. Choose large potatoes of one size, peel and core, taking 
eare not to core them through. Fill them with the minced meat 
and put them in a dish to bake with a cup of water and a little 
nice dripping. If the potatoes are large they will require an hour 
to bake; if small, half that time will be sufficient. Baste occa- 
sionally. _ , 

Saratoga Potatoes.— Slice the potatoes very thin into cold 
water. 6 good sized potatoes will answer for a family of four. A 
knife will 'not answer very well, and a potato sheer can be pur- 
chased at any hardware store for 25 cents. Drain the p'otatoes thor- 
oughly in a colander on a napkin. Drop into boiling lard to fry a 
few at a time. When first thrown in th^y sink, when done they 
rise. After this it is only a question of how much color when they 
should be taken out. Drain and serve on a folded napkin, sprink- 
ling over them a httle salt. A little chopped parsley is thought by 
many an addition. Sprinkle lightly over the dish. Very nice cold, 
or for lunches, etc. A large quantity can be made at once, and 
they may be warmed if desired. 

German Potato Dumplings.— 

12 raw potatoes pared and grated. 
4 cooked potatoes grated. 
1 cupful boiling milk. 
1 heaped cupful of float- 



150 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Drain the water off the raw potatoes, add the cooked ones atid 
scald with the boiUng milk. Out a slice of baker's bread in 
squares and brown in a little butter. Stir them into the batter. 
Add a teaspoonful of salt and the butter. 

Shape large dumplings (keeping the hands well floured), and 
drop them into a kettle of boiling salted water. Oook half an hour. 
Break one open with a fork, if dry in the center they are ready for 
the table. Drain in a colander and serve hot. 

Potatoes Hollandaise. — Peel raw potatoes and scoop out of 
them as many little round balls as possible, using an iron vegetable 
cutter. Simmer until done in slightly salted water. Arrange on 
a plate without breaking. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and 
border the plate Hghtly with sprigs of the same. Serve with fish. 
Very nice also to use as a garnish for fish and meats. The white 
potatoes (in balls) may be alternated with the same sized balls, 
cut in the same manner from beets and carrots and boiled, not too 
soft, in slightly salted water, each in a separate saucepan, on 
account of coloring. Very pretty, but very troublesome. 

Tossed Potatoes. — Boil some potatoes in the skin. Peel 
quickly. Cut in small pieces. Toss them over the fire in a mix- 
ture of cream or rich milk, butter in bits, rolled in flour, pepper 
and salt until they are thoroughly hot and covered with the gravy. 

Fried Potatoes — Raw. — Fry nice salt pork, take from the 
pan, tmin out most of the gravy, have raw potatoes pared and

instead). A Uttle hot water. Cover. Turn occasionally to prevent 
burning. Brown nicely and serve hot. 

BroWH Potatoes. — Boil and peel some large potatoes three- 
quarters of an hour before the roast beef is taken from the oven. 
Skim the fat from the gravy. Dredge the potatoes with flour, and 
put in with the meat. Baste often with the gravy and bake until 
brown. 

Potato Stew (Raw) . — Lay 3 slices salt pork, fat and lean, in 
the stew kettle and let fry. Pour off part of the fat if too much. 
Slice an onion and fry with the pork. When it browns put in the 
potatoes sliced, not too thin, and hot water, not quite enough to 
cover. When nearly done set on the top of the stove to simmer.

ihe lemon that gives it this high-sounding title. 

Princess Potatoes.— Slice cold mashed potatoes into strips 2 
inches long, 1 inch wide and J inch thick. Have in one saucer a 
tablespoonful of melted butter, and in another a beaten egg. Dip 
the strips first in the butter then in the egg. With a knife lay them 
in a buttered tin and cook in a hot oven for twelve minutes. Serve 
at once. 

Buttered Sweet Potatoes.— Butter a pudding dish. Boil 

the potatoes. Peel and slice lengthwise. Butter the slices liber- 
ally. Put in the dish and bake in a hot oven until lightly browned. 
Some cooks sptiiikle sugar and cinnamon between the layers. Dot 
the top layer with bits of butter. 

Potato Balls— Fried. — Work into a cupful of cold mashed 
.potatoes a teaspoonful of melted butter. When the mixture .s 
'white and light add the beaten yolk of 1 egg and season to taste, 
Make into balls, flouring the hands. Eoll thickly in flour and fry 
in plenty of nice hot dripping. Take up with a spoon, or a fotir- 
tined fork, and pile on a hqt dish.

pressing them well down with a spoon. Do not stir, but let them 
become nicely browned on the under side, which will take about 
fifteen minutes. Place a dish over the pan and turn over quickly, 
leaving the nicely browned side of the potato uppermost. 

Potato Pnifs.— 

2 cups cold mashed potatoes ; stir in 
2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter. 
2 well-beaten eggs. 
1 cup of cream or mUk. 

Pour into a deep dish and bake in a quick oven, or nicer to

brush over with the yolk of egg and bake a light brown in the 
oven. Serve on a platter. Nice to send in with fish. A delicious 
dish. 

Sweet Potatoes Browned.— Boil, peel while hot, cut in 
halves or leave whole and put in the oven. After five or ten min- 
utes baste with a teaspoonful of melted butter. This will make 
them brown faster. Serve very hot. Cold potatoes may be used. 

Baked Sweet Potatoes. — Bake on the grating of the oven. 
When half done pierce through with a fork to let the steam out. 
They will be dry and mealy. 

Lyounaise Potatoes. — 6 potatoes parboiled. Cut in dice or 
slice; ^ onion chopped and fried in e. hot buttered fryiug-pan. 
When browned a little add the potatoes, season and put in 1 tea- 
spoonful chopped parsley. Serve dry and hot, 

QRRE.N CORN. 

Boiled Green Com. — Get short, f uU ears of com ; trim ofi 
all the husks, leaving only the last inside leaves. Have a kettle 
of boiling water with a small teaspoonful of salt to each quart. 
If very tender twenty minutes fast boiling wiU cook it properly. 
When done, drain off all the water, remove the husks, lay a nap- 
kin on a large dish, place the corn on this. Turn the corners of 
the napkin over it and serve with salt and cold butter. 

Stewed Green Corn. — Cut from the cob and stew one-fourth

hour in boiling water. Pour this partly off and cover witB sweet 
milk. Stew until tender. , Season with bits, of butter rolled in 
flour, salt and pepper. Let it boil up well and serve hot. 

Succotash. — Twice as much corn as beans. Lima beans are 
very nice, string beans also. Stew them together until tender, 
letting the water be nearly boiled away when they are done. 
Season with butter, pepper and salt. Some add a cup of sweet 
milk. 

Baked Green Corn. — 12 ears of corn, split and cut from the 
ear. Put in a baking dish, season with salt, pepper, a little sugar, 
1 tablespoonf ul butter, and enough milk to cover. Bake one-half 
hour. 

Winter Succotash. — Soak 1 pint of dried sweet com and 1 
pint of white beans over night. In the morning cook separately 
until partly done, adding a pinch of soda to aid in softening the 
beans. Skim the beans from the sodawater, put in with the corn, 
adding what boiling water will be necessary to finish cooking. 
Season with butter and salt. 
Corn Oysters.— 

1 pint of sweet corn cut from the cob. 

^ teacup sweet cream or riqh milk. 

1 well-beaten egg, 

J teaspobnful salt, ^ teaspoonful pepper. 

1 small teacup flour. 
Mix well. Pry like oysters in hot dripping. Have the fat in 
the pan about two inches deep and smoking hot. Hold the spoon 
close to the fat so that the shape of the oysters may be good . 
Omitting the egg will give quite a difierent flavor. A coarse grater 
may be used to remove the com from the cob. 
Green Com Griddle Cakes.— 

l2 ears of corn, grated. 

4 eggs. 

1 cup of sweet milk or cream. 

1 cup flour. 

3 tablespoonf uls of butter if milk is used.

154 THREE MEAI^S A DAY, 

Cora Chowder.— 

12 ears of corn cut from the cob. 

2 slices of salt pork fried brown in the kettle. 

1 large onion simmered in the fat. (This may be 
omitted if disagreeable to the taste.) 
Boil the corn in two quarts of water one-half hour. Add 

6 potatoes sliced. 

1 quart sweet milk. 

A few crackers crumbed. 
Season to the taste and boil until the potatoes are done. If 
oaimed corn is used allow it to get only well heated. 
Kentucky Com Puddina;.— 

1 pint grated corn or ^ can. 

1 tablespoonful butter. 

J teaspoonful salt. 

^ teaspoonful pepper. 

1 egg. 

1 cupful milk. 
If canned corn is used mash a little. Warm the butter and 
stir through the corn. Beat the egg in with the milk. The yolks 
of three eggs may be used in place of one whole egg. Bake in a 
pan until done. This is used as a vegetable. 

Canning Corn. — Gut the corn from the cob. Boil in suffi- 
cient water until well done. Dissolve 1^ ounces of tartaric acid ia 
I pint boiling water. While cooking add 2 tablespoonfuls of the 
tartaric solution to each quart of corn, and can. When wanted for 
eating pour off the water, cover with fresh, adding ^ teaspoonful 
soda to a quart can. Let stand a few minutes, pour off the water, 
add a little clear, cook sufficiently. Season to taste,- adding milk 
or cream, butter, pepper and salt. 

Fnttii^ Down Corn. — Pack 1 quart of com cut from the 
ear in a jar. Strew over this a handful of salt, then another quart 
and salt, until the jar is full. Qover and set in a cool place. This 
will keep a year. Gather the corn when soft and milky. Freshen 
and cook slowly. When seasoning add a little sugar to give the 
natural taste. In freshening drop the com into boiling water and 



VEGETABLES. 1 55 

instantly sMm out. This sets the milk and it may then be put 
through as many waters as necessary. 

Green Ck)m aad Tomatoes Canned. — Take com (cut from 

the ear) and tomatoes, half and half. Oook the corn until almost 
done, then add the tomatoes and oook until softened, and can, at 
once. A very good dish. 

Drying Com.— Cut the corn from the cob and dry in the 
oven, spreading about 1 inch thick in the pan. Stir often to pre- 
vent scorching. If the corn is old, cut the top of the grains off 
and scrape, first down toward the point and then the other way. 
Corn that is too old for roasting ears may be used in this way. 
This is a far better way than cooking the corn before cutting from 
the ear. 

To cook, simmer very gently for an hour or more, first soak- 
ing over night and through the inorning. Add butter, a little 
sugar, salt and cream, or rich milk if liked. 

If milk is used, cut the butter in bits and roll in flour to sup- 
ply a little thickening. 

Hulled Corn or Lye Hominy. — Make a stoong lye. Take 
3 quarts of wood ashes, put in a kettle and cover with 6 quarts 
of water. Let this boil five minutes, skimming several times. 
Eemove from the fire and settle by pouring in a little cold water. 
Put 3 quarts of dry shelled corn in a kettle and strain the lye over 
it. Cook until the hull comes off; skim out and rinse well in sev- 
eral waters, rubbing with the hands until every imperfeetioiLr is 
removed. Churning vigorously in plenty of fresh water is prefer- 
able as saving the hands. Put into a clean kettle and boil until 
soft with plenty of water. Salt and eat with milk, butter and 
pepper, or fry. (Use any kind of a butter chum for cleansing the 
com.) 

Hnlled Com (II). — Take 2 tablespoonfuls of soda to 1 quart 
of corn, with water enough to cover it; let soak over night. Boil 
in the morning until the bulls come off, adding more water if nec- 
essary. Wash and chum in several waters to remove the hulls. 
Season with salt and cook soft in water. Serve with milk and 
sugar, or fry. 

Homiuy.— Soak a cupful of small hominy for two hours in 



156 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

eold water to cover it ; drain ; put over the fire (a double boiler is 
best), with a quart of warm ■water slightly salted, and boil for 
one-half hour. Drain, add a cupful of hot mUk, boil ten or fifteen 
minutes, and serve as a vegetable with meats, or with cream and 
sugar for a dessert. 

Hominy, Fried. — What is left of hominy from dinner may 
be pressed smoothly in a pudding-dish and the next morning sli9ed 
and fried in butter for a breakfa'^t dish. 

TOMATOR8. 

Stewed Tomatoes. — Pour scalding water on ripe tomatoes 
and let them remain in it two minutes. Peel and slice them and 
put in a stewpan with a little salt and butter and let stew for one- 
half hour. At the end of this time either thicken with bread or 
cracker crumbs, or pour over buttered toast. Cayenne pepper is 
better with tomatoes; ^ cupful of sweet cream or milk may be 
added if liked. 

Baked Staffed Tomatoes. — Take rather large regularly shaped 
fruit, cut a small slice from the blossom end and scrape out all the 
soft part. Mix this with stale bread-crumbs, butter, pepper and 
salt, some parsley and a little chopped onion. Fill the tomatoes 
carefully; set them in a dish with a little butter in it. Let them 
bake three-quarters of an hour in a moderately hot oven, watch- 
ing that they do not bum or become dry. 

Broiled Tomatoes. — Select firm ripe tomatoes, cut in thick 
slices and broil on a well greased gridiron over a clear fire, turn- 
ing. A double wire broiling iron is almost a necessity. Arrange 
the slices on a heated plate and pour over them melted butter sea- 
soned with' salt and Cayenne. Serve immediately. 

Deviled Tomatoes.— 

1 pint of thickly sliced tomatoes. 

1 yolk of egg, hard-boUed. 

2 tablespoonfuls melted butter. 
1^ tablespoonfuls of vinegar. 

1 raw egg, whipped light. 

1 teaspoonful powdered sugar. 

Salt, mustard and pepper. 



VEGETABLES. ' I57 

Rub the boiled yolk with the butter and seasoning; add the 
vinegar boiling hot; beat light. Stir in the beaten egg until the 
mixture thickens. Set the dish in hot water. Broil the sliced 
tomatoes as per directions given above. Lay the slices on a hot 
dish and pour the hot sauce over them. 

Scalloped Tomatoes. — Peel and slice the fruit, put in a 
pudding-dish with alternate layers of cracker or bread-crumbs, 
sprinkling salt, pepper and bits of butter on each layer, finishing 
with crumbs. 

Bake three-quarters of an hour and serve in the same dish. 
If the tomatoes are very juicy, bake with the dish covered; when 
partly done remove cover and brown the top. Green tomatoes 
may be scalloped in the same manner. Peel first, baking a full 
hour. A little chopped onion may be sprinkled between the layers. 

Fried Green Tomatoes. — Take large green tomatoes and 
cut in slices J inch thick, rejecting the first and last slice ; roU 
them in flour and slowly fry brown in plenty of butte.T. Sprinkle 
pepper and salt over them. Some like a little sugar ; serve on a 
hot dish. Nice for an entree or garnish for meats. 

The dish resembles egg-plant. Scald the sliced tomatoes i?i 
salt water before frying. 

Fried Green Tomatoes and Onions. — Slice onions and 
green tomatoes, scald the tomatoes in salt water; then fry together 
in butter or dripping, stirring well. Season with salt and pepper. 
A. teaspoonful of water may be added if necessary. 

ASPARAGUS. 

Asparagus on Toast. — Choose green stalks of asparagus, 
the largest are best; cut off the white tough part, lay in cold Tfratea 
for an hour. Tie in small bunches, putting the heads all one way. 
Cook one-half hour in boiling salted water. Toast as many thii) 
slices of bread as there are bunches of asparagus. Dip for aii in' 
stant in the asparagus water, then butter freely. ' Lay a bunch 6i 
asparagus on each slice} pepper lightly and dot with bits of buttet. 
Drawn butter may be poured over it instead. 

YinegSbr may be served with asparagus. If milk or cream is 
eaayeutieut pour the wat^ from the asparagus and pour iu as macb 



158 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

ef this as is required. Drop in a bit of butter, a pinch of salt, Ueat 
het and pour over the toast. 

Stewed Asparagus. — Prepare as above, cutting in half-inch 
bits. Oook in salted water, using a porcelain or earthenware dish. 
Drain off part of the water, pepper lightly and add a goodly lump 
of butter Serve hot. The water may be entirely drained away and 
a BufBcient quantity of milk or cream added, seasoning with but- 
ter and pepper, heating to the boiling point. 

A pinch of soda in the water for b&iling makes asparagus 
tender. 

MUSHROOMS. 

To Test. — The upper part and the stalks of good mushrooms 
are white; as they increase in size the under part gradually opens 
and shows a fringe surface of a fine salmon color, which, as the 
mushroom gains in size, turns a dark brown. The upper sur- 
face parts easily from the edge and middle and has a pleasant 
smell. If a little salt be sprinkled on the under side of a mush- 
room, and it should turn yellow, reject it at once as poisonous; if 
black they are wholesome. 

Stewed Mushrooms. — Trim and rub clean with a flannel 
dipped in salt; to J pint of large button [mushrooms put 2 table- 
spoonfuls of butter in a pan; melt; put in the mushrooms, ^ tea- 
spoonfnl of salt, ^ as much pepper and 1 blade of mace pounded; 
stew till the mushrooms are tender, then serve on a very hot dish. 

Mushroom Flaps Broiled. — Clean the mushrooms by wiping 
them with a piece of flannel dipped in salt. Cut off a portion of 
the stalk and peel the tops; broil them over a clear fire; 
turn them and arrange on a hot dish > put a small piece of but- 
ter on each mushroom, season with pepper and salt and squeeze 
over them a few drops of lemon juice; place the dish before the 
fire; when the butter is melted serve vety qujokly. Modwately 
sized flaps are better than buttons for breiliBg; ike lafeter are for 
stewing. 

Baked Mushrooms. — Flatten &iLi peel, and lay in a pie tin 
with a piece of butter on each one ; pepper and salt lightly and 



VEGETABLES. 159 

bake twenty minutes in a moderate oven. Heap ligh,tly on a hot 
dish and pour the gravy over all. 

Fried Mushrooms with Beefsteak.— Cut ofE the stem, 
peel the top of the mushroom, rinse in cold water and fry in a, 
little butter, covering the bottom, of the pan. They will yield coU' 
siderable gravy. Cook three or four minutes, place them over the 
top of hot broiled steak with the gravy. 

saiaBify or vrortabl^r 

OYST^RR. 

Any time after the root is fully grown, prepare by scraping, 
and immediately drop in cold water to prevent turning black. , Cut 
in J inch slices and boil in sufficient water to cover. Thirty min- 
utes will be enough. Then add a cupful of cream or milk with a 
tablespoonful of flour stirred in smoothly. Do not turn off the 
water; season highly with pepper, butter and salt, and serve as 
other oysters. A small piece of codfish boiled with it is some- 
times considered an improvement. Or parboil and dip the slices 
in egg and then in bread-crumbs and fry in butter. 

PRAS AND BRAN©. 
€lreen Peas, Fresh or Canned. — 1 peck wiU answer for a 

family of four or five. SheU them, but do not wash, as this injures 
the flavor. Put them in boiling salted water; add a teaspoonful of 
white sugar and cook one-half hour. Drain ; pepper and salt 
lightly, and stir in ^ teaspoonful salt, and serve hot. 

In opening Canned Peas observe the directions given at the be- 
ginning of this chapter. If no juice, barely cover with cold water. 
Add a teaspoonful of sugar to a quart can and ^ teaspoonful of 
salt. Add a tablespoonful of butter and send them to the table in 
the liquor. 

Peas may be stewed and when the water is very nearly ab- 
sorbed turn in cream or mUk sufficient for' the required amount of 
liquid. Let it boil up and season to taste with butter, pepper and 
salt. One-half teaspoonful of white sugar may be added or faoU 
the pods in the water first. 



l6o THREE MEALS A DAY. 

String Beans.— Wash, string and cut the beans in pieces. 
Put over to cook in boUing water, adding J ted,spoonM of baking 
soda to a quart of beans. Let boil ten or fifteen minutes, then 
skim into clear boiling water; salt and boil untU tender. Season 
with i cup of cream or milk, butter and pepper. They may be 
boiled with a piece of meat and the cream omitted. 

Pork and Beans. — Soak 3 cups of beans over night. Boil 
in the morning, adding a teaspoonful of saleratus to the water. 
When the beans begin to break skfan them into a baking dish. In 
the center put a half pound of pork with the upper surface weU 
scored. Then cover the beans with boiling water and bake three 
hours in a hot oven. A large onion boiled with them and re- 
moved before baking improves the flavor for some. 

Stewed Beans. — Proceed as for Baked Beans, skimming 
from the saleratus water into clear boiliag water and stew gently 
several hours; season liberally with salt, butter and a little Cay- 
enne pepper, a little onion if desired. 

Boston Baked Beans. — Soak 1 quart of beans over night. 
In the morning parboil in soda water, skim into the bean pot; add 
^ pound of salt pork, 3 tablespoonfuls of molasses, 1 teaspoonful 
of salt. Put in the oven and bake slowly, keeping the beans' 
covered with boiling water and adding fresh whenever needed. If 
it is convenient keep in a warm oven all night and serve for Sun- 
day breakfast and dinner. The beans should be quite dry when 
served. 

Lima Beans. — Boil in as little water as possible and when 
tender drain into a colander and season with butter, pepper and 
salt. The water they are boiled in should be slightly salted. 
Cream or milk may be added to the seasoning if desired. 

Dried Lima Beans. — Soak over night in soft water. In the 
morning pour this off and add boiling water, salted in the propor- 
tion of 1 teaspoonful to a quart. Boil two hours moderately, drain, 
season with 1 tablespoonful of butter, J teaspoonful of black pep- 
per, ^ teaspoonful of salt and serve hot. 

Fried Okra. — Out in slices, rinse in cold watra:, dip in flour 
and fry brown in salted butter or laid. 

GHmtoo.— Creole Style. — ^Take equal quantities of young, 



VEGETABLES. l6l 

tender okra chopped fine, ripe tomatoes peeled and sliced ; 1 onion 
sliced, a small lump of butter, a little salt and pepper. Put tlie 
whole in a stew-pan' with a tablespoonful of water, and stew until 
tender. 

Stewed Okra. — Slice young, tender pods in rounds. Boil 
twenty minutes in salted water. Drain and season with butter 
and pepper. This may be poured over buttered toast if desired. 
A half cup of hot cream or very rich mUk is an addition. 

Stewed Celery. — Scrape and wash the celery. Cut in inch 
lengths and cook twenty minutes in boiling salted water. Drain, 
pour in a cup of milk, let boil and add 1 tablespoonful of butter 
rolled in flour, pepper and salt, and stew gently a few minutes ; or, 
tie in bunches like asparagus, boil, season and serve on buttered 
toast. 

GABBAQR. 

BoUed Cabbage. — Trim the outside leaves off, cut in quar- 
ters, or in round slices. Put in a kettle of boihng water with a 
teaspoonful of salt, cover and let the cabbage boil lively for half an 
hour. When the stalks are tender, take it up, press to free it from 
water, put pepper and butter over it and serve hot; or the pepper 
and butter may be omitted and vinegar alone served with it. 

Another nice way is to press the cabbage free from water, 
chop fine and season liberally with pepper and butter, serving the 
same as mashed turnips. Some cooks boU cabbage with a small 
piece of oom-beef in the water. 

Cabbage a la Creme.— BoU a cabbage, cut fine, in two cup- 
fuls of milk . "When done add a tablespoonful of butter rolled in 
flour and season with pepper and salt. 

Fried Cabbage.— Fry ham or bacon. Pour ofi part of the 
fat. Remove the meat and put in the cabbage previously cut fine. 
Pour in a little water. Season with pepper and salt. Cook slowly. 
Vinegar may be served with it. Butter may be used in place of 
ham. 

Saner Eraat — Slice good solid heads of c^abbage fine. Put 
down in large jars. Sprinkle salt very lightly between the layers. 
Pack very closely. Too much salt will stop the fermenting process.

Some housewives add a half gallon of vinegar to a barrel, or a 
quart to a large jar full. Put a porcelain cover over the top with a 
heavy weight. Eemove this every few days and rinse with cold 
water to remove the scum. Put ia a warm place for at least four 
weeks. After the fermentation is compiote remove to a cold place. 

Cooking Sauer Krant. — Cook in boiling water one hour. This 
may then be fried in butter or ham grayv, or the kraut may be 
boiled with a piece of salt pork. 

Cauliflower Boiled. — Place a cauliflower head in well salted 
water. Tie in a piece of coarse white netting to prevent breaking. 
Boil until tender. Eemove the netting and serve in a deep dish, 
pouring over it a cupful of drawn butter. Epicures consider the 
addition of the juice of ^ a lemon a great improvement. Cauli- 
flower is whiter and nicer boiled with equal parts of milk and 
water. 

Cauliflower a La Creme. — Prepare and boil as above. Drain 
and pour over it a cupful of milk or cream. Let it boil and season 
with a tablespoonful of butter, rolled in flour with a little pepper. 
Cauliflower is also nice browned in butter after boiling. "^ 

TURNIPS AND BRRTS. 

Turnips Stewed. — Peel, slice, chop and cook in boihng salted 
water until tender. Drain and season with pepper. To 2 quarts 
of turnip add 1 pint of cream or rich milk. Mix 1 tablespoonful 
of flour and 1 tablespoonful of butter; simmer altogether ten 
minutes. Serve hot. Some use a beaten egg in the milk, and 
some use sour cream, adding the egg and a dash of vinegar. 

Turnips Mashed. — Peel, slice and soak in cold water. BoU 
until quite tender in salted water. Drain and mash with butter. 
Much of the flavor and sugEir of the root is lost in thi^ way. To 
prevent this boil the root whole without peeling. It will take twice 
as long. When quite tender peel and prepare as above. Add a 
little cream or milk while mashing. 

Carrots. — Wash and scrape. Leave in cold water half an 
hour. Boil until tender in salted water. Chop or mash flue, sea- 
soning with butter, pepper and a few teaspoonfula of eream oi 
milk. 



VBG^TABLES. 1 63 

Carrots Stewed. — Prepare to boil by cutting lengthwise. 
Slice thin. When done put in a saucepan 2 tablespoonfuls of 
butter and 1 cupful milk. Season with pepper. Some like a dash 
of Cayenne. Add very little sugar and stew half an hour. 

Beets. — Wash carefully, neither cutting nor scraping that 
juiee and color may be preserved. Boil until tender. In summer 
{his will takf an hour, in winter at least three hours. SHce hot 
and season with plenty of butter, pepper, salt and a little vinegar, 
and serve. Slice some up for pickles and put in cold spiced 
vinegar, or plain vinegar. The tops, and the young beets thinned 
out, make excellent greens. 

Tonng Beets. — Boil and shce. Pour over them the follow- 
ing sauce : 

1 teaoupful vinegar. 
1 teaspoonful butter. 
1 teaspoonful sugar. 

Let it boil up and turn over the beets. Serve hot. Young 
beets are very nice sliced hot and served with cream or rich mUk, 
seasoned with butter, pepper and salt. Let it boil up and pour 
over the beets. 

Parsnips Stewed. — Wash, pare and split in two, or if large, 
cut in slices. Neither carrots or parsnips should be boiled, whole, 
as the outside is done too much before the inside is tender. Boil 
until soft in just water enough to keep from burning. Then stir 
in sweet milk. Dredge in a little flour. Add a goodly lump of 
butter. Season with pepper and salt, and let simmer fifteen 
minutes.: Some cooks serve parsnips with a simple white sauce. 

Parsnips Browned.^ — Pare, cut in pieces lengthwise and 
steam an hour. Then bake in a hot oven with a little salt and 
meat dripping until brown; baste occasionally with the dripping. 
Drain and serve. Cold boiled parsnips sliced may be baked in tne 
same way, or they may be dipped in flour and fried in butter, turn- 
ing when one side is brown, or dip in a fritter batter, and fry in 
butter or dripping. , 

Cacumbers Stewed. — Cucumbers that are just too old for 
piekhng or serving raw are at their prime for cooking, and cap be 
served in innumerable ways, being, in fact, one of oar most useful

vegetables. And they are far more wholesome cooked than in the 
raw state. Cat the cucumbers in slices ^ an inch thick. Put them 
in a sauce pan, just covering with hot water, and let boil until ten- 
der. Drain and cover with a pint of cream or rich milk. Add a 
teaspoonful of butter. Season with salt and white pepper. Let 
boU five minutes, shaking the saucepan. Serve hot. This dish is 
dehcate as asparagus. 

encumber Toast.— Pare and shce lengthwise in cuts ^ inch 
thick. Einse in cold water. Dip each slice in flour and fry 
briskly in butter or meat gravy until a light brown. Have the 
toast buttered and moistened slightly. Lay a slice of cucumber 
between two slices of toast and serve instantly as hot as possible. 
The fried cucumber may be served without the toast if wished. 

Fried Egg Plant. — Slice the egg plant without paring, into 
6 or 6 pieces, omitting, the end parings. Boil in salted water five 
minutes to extract the strong taste. Drain. Dip each slice in 
beaten egg, and then in bread-crumbs. Fry a light brown on both 
sides in butter or dripping. 

Egg Plant with Batter. — Prepare and boil as above. Drain 
and dip each shce in fritter batter, and fry in hot lard. Drain 
before serving. 

Scalloped Egg Plant. — Boil the egg plant until tender. 
Bemove the skin ; mash fine ; mix with an equal quantity of bread 
or cracker-crumbs. Put in a buttered baking dish. Season with 
pepper, salt and butter. Sprinkle crumbs over the top and bake 
one-half hour. This makes a delightful and digestible dish. 

Stewed Onions. — In peehng onions be careful not to cut the 
top and bottom too closely or the onion will not keep whole. Boil 
in salted water with a little milk until tender. Drain and put 
in a white sauce to simmer for ten minutes ; or, a cup of milk or 
cream boiling hot. Season with butter, pepper and salt. Turn 
over the onions and serve, or serve whole with butter, pepper and 
salt. 

Fried Onions. — Peel and slice. Fry in butter or meat gravy. 
Season with pepper and salt, and serve hot. 

Snmmer Squash.— This vegetable should always be steamed, 
as the object is to get it dry as possible to admit of using cream ia

the seasoning. Cut in pieces it will cook in one-half hour. Mash, 
season and place for a few minutes on the back of the stove. 
Serve. , 

Winter or Hubbard Squash. — This squash is better baked 
than steamed or boiled. To steam, pare the squash, take out the 
seeds and cut in strips. Put in the steamer and cook until soft. 
Place in a deep dish and mash, adding for each quart of, squash 1 
tablespoonful of butter, 1 teaspoonful of salt, and J teaspoonful of 
pepper. If baked, it can be prepared in the same manner, or 
may be served in the shell. It may also be baked in the pan with 
roast beef, basting with the gravy. 

Spinach. — Put in a covered saucepan with a little water. Boil 
twenty minutes and drain. Chop. Eeturn to the fire and season 
with butter, pepper and salt. Cover with slices of hard-boiled 
eggs and serve hot. 

Greens. — ^Young beets are perhaps the most delicious greens. 
Scrape the roots and boil with the leaves. Mustard, turnip tops, 
dandelions, cowslips, red-root, cabbage iSprouts, pigweed, etc., etc., 
are all suitable for this purpose. Prepare carefully; put into boil- 
ing salted water. Drain and press; season with pepper and but- 
ter; serve with sliced hard-boiled egg and plain, spieed, or horse- 
radish vinegar. Greens may be boiled with ham or salt pork. 

Plain boiled greens are nice fried a few minutes with salt, 
pepper and butter. 

Artichokes. — Wash and let lie two or three hours in cold 
water; put in boiling salted water and boil steadily two or three 
hours; add water when necessary; when tender, drain and serve 
with melted butter. 

Baked Klce. — 

1 small cupful of rice. 
1 quart of milk. 
1 teaspoonful of salt. 

1 tablespoonful of butter, to be used in bntteiiug the 
pudding-dish. 

Wash the rice in two waters and put into the dish; add the 
milk and salt and bake in a slow oven two hours. It must swell 
and be a firm mass. If it browns too fast cover till nearly done

and serve very hot. 2 large spoonfuls of grated cheese are some' 
times added. Serve as a vegetable. 

Rice, Southern Manner.— Prepare the rice for cooking, 
allow 1 quart of water to 1 cupful of rice; salt a little and when 
boiling put in the rice. Boil twenty minutes, drain closely, set the 
kettle back over the bed of coals and steam fifteen minutes with 
the lid off. When done every kernel will be found perfect and 
tender. 

Rice is very nice cooked in this manner instead of steaming. 
Add a cupful of milk and let cook an hour or more. 

Macaroni, Bailed. — Break the macaroni into inch lengths 
stew two minutes, or until tender. Drain, put in a pudding-dish, 
cover with mUk; season with butter, pepper and salt and bake 
one-half hour. A couple of tablespoonf uls of grated cheese may 
be added. 

Macaroni with Cheese. — 1 pint of Italian macaroni broken 
in inch pieces ; drop in 1 quart of boiling water, to which an even 
teaspoonfnl of salt has been added. Boil twenty minutes and 
drain ; pour over it enough milk to cover and cook until tender. 
Butter a pudding-dish, cover the bottom with grated cheese; add 
layers of macaroni, then of cheese until sufficient; cover the last 
layer of cheese with bread-crumbs. Bake in a quick oven fifteen 
minutes. If the toy ^ not brown heat a shovel red hot and 
brown. 

Boiled Dinner. — The corned beef should be put over early 
in the day. Put in cold water, allowing room for the numerous 
vegetables., If salt pork is used it will not need to boil so long. 
Cut a medium-sized cabbage in quarters. White beets are nice to 
use for boiled dinner. Do not break the skin in washing. Put 
the beets in ,by 9 o'clock, that they may be tender; and if the car- 
rots are large they must be added with the beets. Later, add 
parsnips and cabbage, peeled turnips cut in pieces, and peeled po- 
tatoes about one-half hour before the dinner is to be served. Boil 
a red pepper pod with the whole. Peel the beets; dish up the 
vegtables and meat in separate dishes for convenience in carv- 
ing. Serve with spiced or horse-radish vinegax.

aOOD flour and pure yeast are an absolute necessity in making 
good bread. Bread is well termed the staff of life^ In 
order to make good bread (to know how to do this is an 
accomplishment of which any lady may be proud) requires atten- 
tion from the time it is begun until it is baked. , The sponge 
(flour, yeast, water or milk mixed together) should always be kept 
warm and at an even temperature. A wood or earthen trough is 
best. 

In the first molding of bread all the flour shovdd be put in, 
and the most kneading given. 

Water used in making bread should not be too hot. If the 
temperature be too high the loaf will be coarse, porous, light. 

One cup of yeast means wet yeast.. If dry is used the cup 
must be filled with water. 

Brush the tops of the loaves with butter before putting in the 
oven. This will keep the crust moist. 

Baibed biscuit should be rubbed with butter before putting in 
the tin that they may separate smoothly when baked and leave no 
jagged edges. 

Test the oven by putting in a tablespoonful of flour on an old 
tin. If this browns in one minute the oven is at right heat. Keep 
the heat steady and as it lessens toward the end of the baking set 
in the rolls or biscuit. After they have risen put on more heat 
and bake. 

Flour should be kept in a cool dry place and should always 
be sifted before using. If sifted by the quantity so much the bet- 
ter. Some sift baking powder with it at the rate of two heaping 
tablespoonfuls to a quart of ^our. Set apart in a close covered 
pail to be ready for use.

Self-eising floue is very convenient, also creamery buttered 
flour. This last requires neither salt, shortening nor baking 
powder and is to be recommended. If prepared at home add to each 
quart of flour one teaspoonful of soda and two teaspoonfuls of 
cream tartar. Sift together three times. This will be found a 
great convenience. 

Gkaham flour should be bought in small quantities. It spoils 
by long keeping. 

Dough for bread should be rather soft; for baking pow.ler 
biscuits, as soft as they can be handled. 

Deep tins are better for bread, as the loaves are not so apt to 
spread in rising. 

Soda oe baking powder biscuit, bread and cake can be miwle 
almost as nice as fresh by plunging an instant into cold wftter, 
then placing in a hot oven ten or fifteen minutes. To be ©^d 
immediately. 

Crackers grown soft from keeping may be heated throu^ ]a 
the oven to make crisp and fresh. 

Heat the breadrknife before slicing a warm loaf of breat<S )r 
cake and the slices will be smooth and even. 

L«DiAN MEAii is considered by some cooks a serviceable aidify'm 
to wheat flour in making pastry, bread or pudding. Us(»d in 
small quantities the paste will be found lighter and shorter;! A 
little less than one-fourth meal will be found about the coM«ct 
proportions, though still less can be used. 

Good management in cutting bread for the table will prevent 
the accumulation of stale bits. Once accumulated, however, they 
may be utilized in various ways. Toast, hard or soft, is alTays 
nice, while the smaller bits may be browned and dried in the OTen, 
powdered and kept in a glass jar for breading croquettes, oysters, 
etc., instead of cracker-crumbs. 

A ouf OP FLouK always means a full cup dipped up Ksfore 
sifting. 

Brown bread that has grown stale makes delicious milk tt^ist. 
Prepare same as wheat bread for toast. Brown biscuit cai be 
utilized in the same way. 

Bread must be smoothly cut, then piled on a little doyl^ v

Japanese paper mat laid in the plate. The same course should be 
pursued with cheese and with crackers. 

Hop Yeast. — Six or seven common-sized potatoes grated. 
litir a heaping tatlespoonful of flour with the grated potato. Put 
1 cup of hops in 2 quarts of boiling water. Let boil half an hour, 
strain and pour over the grated potatoes, adding a large handful of 
salt and one of sugar. Stir well and let boil ten minutes. Let it 
stand until cool enough, not' to scald, and add a coffee cup full -of 
good yeast. Set by the stove until light. Keep afterward in a 
cool, dry place. 

An easier way is to boil the potatoes in hop water, mash them 
and add to them salt and sugar. If yeast is at all doubtful stir 
in a little saleratus before using it. If it does not foam well it is 
too stale. 

Potato Teast — Peel and grate 3 large potatoes. Pour on 1 
quart of boiling water and cook clear, adding l cupful salt and | 
cupful of sugar. Let it cool and put in 1 cupful of soft yeast or 
1 cake of dried yeast. Use one teacupf ul of this yeast for four or 
five loaves of bread, and renew while there is enough of the old 
yeast left to start the new. In starting new always clean the yeast 
jug thoroughly. 

Teast Cakes. — To 1 quart of cold water add a large handful 
of hops. Let boil half an hour, then strain it into | cupful of 
Wheat flour. When lukewarm add 3 cakes of yeast that have been 
soaked in warm water. Set in a warm place until light, then 
thicken with corn-meal until stiff enough to roll' out. Cut in 
three-inch cakes. Dry in the shade in windy weather. When 
dry tie in a bag and keep in a cool dry place. Tarn them often 
while drying to keep from souring. They may be dried by the 
stove if necesEsary. When wanted for use soak a cake in lukewarm 
water. This should be enough for three loaves of bread. These 
cakes will keep five or six months and are especially convenient in 
the summer when common yeast is apt to ferment. 

Baking Powder.— 

10 ounces of corn-starch. 

9 ounces bi-carbonate of soda. 

7 ounces tartaric acid. 



170 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

FoTrder, sift several times, spread on a bread'board and 
stand in the sun; sift again. When thoroughly dry put up in 
tight jars or cans. 

Tartaric acid is to be used in preference to cream of tartar as 
being a purer article, and as only halt the quantity is required the 
extra cost is not noticeable. Get bi-carbonate of soda. It is a 
better article than the common baking soda. 

Lime Water in Bread. — Use lime water in making bread. 
It hap been found that lime water produces the same whiteness, 
softness and capacity for retaining moisture as results from the 
use of alum, while it removes all acidity from the dough. A sat- 
urated solution should be used. 1 cupful of air-slaked Ume in 1 
quart of cold water will answer as a solution. Use 1 tablespoon- 
ful for each loaf of bread. 

Graham bread for dyspeptics should contain neither yeast, 
molasses or soda. Molasses needs soda to correct its natural 
acidity. No person with a weak digestion should ever use soda. 

Bread With Potato Sponge.— Peel and boil 4 medium sized 
potatoes in 1 quart of water. When done, mash and pour both 
potatoes and water boiling hot over about 1 pini of flour, stirring 
well. Do this at dinner time. When cool add enough more water 
to make the wished-for amount of batter, 1 cupful of yeast for 4 
loaves of bread, 1 tablespoonful of salt, 1 of sugar, and flour suffi- 
cient to make a moderately stiff batter. Keep in a warm place, and 
in the evening add flour enough to knead. Do this thoroughly, 
cover well, keep warm and in the morning knead down and let it 
rise again. After breakfast, if sufficiently light make into loaves 
moulding thoroughly and let it rise, covering warmly until suffi- 
ciently light. Bake in a hot oven at a uniform temperature from 
three-fourths to one hour. Brushing the loaves over with a little 
melted butter tends to soften the crust. 

Some cooks prefer to use for scalding bread sponge the water 
only in which the potatoes have been boiled as making bread less 
moist and sohd. Or boiling water may be used. 

A still easier method will be found to scald a pint of flour 
with boiling water at night, adding yeast and instead of a sponge 
mix stiff and knead at once. Cover warmly; in the morning pro- 



BREAD. 171 

oeed as above. Scalding buttermilk or -whey may be used instead 
of scalding water, and will be found an improvement. 

Cold sweet milk half and half with cold water makes very 
sweet, tender bread. 

In the winter it will be found a very good plan to heat the 
flour, set the sifted flour over a kettle of boihng water, or in the 
heating oven of a range. 

Good Bread. — Set a thick sponge at night with warm water, 
not milkj using 2 yeast cakes for four very large loaves; beat the 
sponge thoroughly. In the morning take 4 tablespoonfuls of 
white sugar dissolved in f cup of melted butter, 1 teaspoonful salt 
and flour enough to make a soft dough. Mold vigoroyisly. Let it 
rise until very light, mold again. Let it rise agai'nj less time. 
Make in loaves, rub each one with melted butter and bake in a 
good oven. Bread made in this way is deliciously light and tender. 

Bread with Corn-meal Sponge. — Spread 8 quarts of flour in 
the bread-pan so as to leave a large cavity in the center. Make 2 
quarts of sifted white corn-meal into mush by boiling it in either 
water or milk. When cool enough to add the yeast without scald- 
ing, turn into the flour, put in 1 cupful of yeast, 1 teaspoonful of 
salt and enough warm milk or water* 'fe make a suitable batter, 
mixing with it a portion of the flour. Cover the whole closely and 
let it stand over nights Stir stiff in the morning with the remain- 
der of flour in the pan, knead and make into loaves. Let it rise 
near the fire and bake well. This is, an excellent article of light, 
sweet nutritious bread that will keep moist longer than any other 
and make the flour "hold out" wonderfully. - 

Salt-rising Bread. — Put 1 quart of warm water in a 3 quart 
pitcher or tin paU. Do this early in the morning. Add a te?.- 
spoonful of salt and 1 of brown sugar,, ft' pinch of soda, 1 cupful of 
sweet milk if convenient, if not, 3 or ^;tabl€sp6oniuls of corn -meal 
wiU answer^ then stir in flour as for 8' thick batter. Set the vessel 
in a kettle of warm water and keep at an even temperature. Stir 
quite often until it begins to foam and rise; then do not disturb or 
jar it. If water should rise over the yeast after standing a while, 
stir in a little more flour. When the yeast rises to the top of tho 
pajl or pitcher it i» ready to use. 



172 THREE MEALS A BAIT." 

Sift 4 or 5 quarts of flour and spread in a pan so as to leave a 
large cavity in the center and put in 1 tablespoonful of sweet lard 
and butter. Pour over this 3 pints of warm water and add the 
rising. Mix and work into loaves. Eub butter over each. Put 
in long, deep tins and when it rises to the top bake three-fourths of 
an hour. Let cool uncovered, and put away in a large stone jar. 
This will make nice, moist, sweet bread. 

Some cooks add 1 pint of corn-meal mush, when kneading up 
for baking. This ensures its moistness. Graham flour is better 
to set the rising with, than fine flour. 

Milk Teast Bread. — Take 1 pint of Graham flour. Stir in 1 
tablespoonful white sugar, 1 tablespoonful ginger, 1 teaspoonful 
saleratus, 1 teaspoonful salt. Set this away in a covered dish or 
glass fruit can to keep from the air. The night before baking take 
2 tablespoonfuls of this dry mixture and pour on boUing water un- 
til it is a thick batter, set in a warm place to rise. In the morn- 
ing take 1 quart in equal parts of boiling water and new milk, add 
the yeast. Then stir in flour until it is a stiff batter. Set the pan 
over a kettle of hot water, not too hot or the dough will stick to 
the pan. If hot enough it will be foaming in two or three hours. 
Stir in flour enough to knead, put in tins and let rise again until 
the whole top of the loaf will move by laying the hand softly on it. 
Bake in a moderately hot oven, wrap in a wet doth and the result 
will be nice white bread. 

Vienna Bread. — 2 pounds sifted flour banked •around the 
pan, 1 pint of milk, J pint of water; naix a thin batter, quickly 
add J pint milk, in which has been dissolved ^ ounce of salt, and 
I ounce of compressed yeast; leave remainder of flour against side 
of pan ; cover and keep free from air forty-five minutes ; then mix 
in rest of the flour until dough leaves side and bottom of pan. Let 
stand for two and a half hours. Divide into 1 pound pieces. Sub- 
divide into 12 pieces. Fold corner of each piece to center; turn 
over to rise for thirty minutes. Put in hot oven; bake twenty 
minutes. 

Eye Bread. — To 1 quart of warm water stir as much corn- 
meal or Graham as will make a smooth batter; stir into it half a 
cupful of baker's yeast and set in a warm place to rise. Let this

sponge be mixed in a vessel that will contain twice the quantity. 
In the morning put 3 quarts of rye flour into a bowl, hoUow out 
the center, pour in the sponge, add a teaspoonful of salt, and half 
a teaspoonful of saleratus dissolved in a little water ; make the 
whole into a smooth dough with as much warm water as may be 
necessary; knead well, cover, set in a warm place for three hours, 
knead again and make into two or three loaves. Bake in a quick 
oven one hour. 

Qnick Buttermilk Bread.— 
1 pint of buttermilk. 
1^ teaspoonfuls of soda. 
J cupful of shortening. 
1 teaspoonful of white sugar. 
And a little salt. 
Mour to make a medium dough. 

Bake at once. 

Graham Yeast Bread. — 1 cake of dry yeast dissolved in 2 
eupfuls of lukewarm water. Make stiff sponge with 2 pints of 
water and white flour, adding the dissolved yeast. Do this at 
night. In the morning add 1 teaspoonful of salt, ^ teaspoonful 
of soda, 1 cupful of brown sugar or molasses and 1 tablespoonful 
of lard. Stir in Graham flour stiff as possible and let rise ; stir 
again and put in buttered pans, shaping with the spoon ; let rise. 
(Never knead the dough for Graham bread.) Place in the oven 
and bake a little longer than white bread. When done, dampen 
the bread-cloth and roll lightly, with a dry towel outside. Thig 
will soften the crust. 

A bowl of white bread sponge may be used instead of yeast. 
Add a bowl full of warm water to this and proceed as directed. 

Or the white sponge may be stirred stiff with Graham flour 
the night before and the other ingredients added, and it will only 
need stirring down in the morning, when it ^nay rise again and 
be put in baking-tins. 

Graham Bread (IL) — Take 2 quarts of buttermilk and let 
come to a boil; turn into a pan and when quite cool stir in

crust may be utilized in the same manner. , 

Twist EoUs. — Take a piece of bread dough in the morning 
sufficient for a large tin of rolls. Work in a piece of butter, about 
1 tablespoonful, then divide the dough into parts the size of an 
egg, subdividing each part in unequal pieces; the largest piece

Eub the flour and butter together, add the other ingredients, 
using flour enough to make a stiff dough, Let rise, work well, 
roll out and cut with a biscuit cutter. Let rise again and bake in 
a quick oven. Another way is to use the above ingredients mixed 
with three cups of flour, and to drop the dough by spoonfuls in 
the baking tin. 

Milk Crackers. — Eub J cup butter with 3 cups of flour; 
dissolve 1 teaspoonful of soda in ^ cupful water and strain over 
the flour; add 1 teaspoonful salt, 2 teaspoonfuls cream tartar and 
sweet milk enough to make a stiff dough. Knead well, beat with

MUFFINS. 

Gem pans must be of iron, the deep style should always be 
used. Heart thoroughly and butter well. 

Salt should never be used unless there is rising of some sort 
in the recipe. 

Muffin rings may be filled two-thirds full and baked upon a 
well-buttered griddle on top of the stove, turning ring and all 
with a knife or pancake shovel when one side is cooked to brown 
the other the same depth. The rings may be filled and set in a 
well-buttered baking-pan and baked in the oven, when, of course, 
no turning will be necessary. Eings two and one-half inches 
across and one and one-half inches deep are the most convenient 
size. 

Muffin rings or gem irons may be used in many recipes for 
gems, muffins and puffs. Occasionally the same recipes may be 
baked upon a griddle on top of the stove. This is often a very 
nice way where great haste is necessary. 

Intbbchange of Baking Powdee. — Two teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder called for by a recipe may be replaced by one teaspoonful 
cream tartar and one-half teaspoonful soda and vice versa, always 
using twice as much cream tartar as soda, and in substituting for 
baking powder see that the two together equal two-thirds of the 
amount of baking powder in the recipe. 

In substituting sour milk for sweet milk or water, soda alone 
must be used in the proportion of one-half teaspoonful to one cup 
of sour mUk. In substituting sweet milk or water for sour milk 
one teaspoonful soda may be replaced by two large teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder. Where a large number of eggs beaten separately 
are required in a recipe, Httle if any baking powder is used. 
Never cut open a muffin or a crumpet of any kind, least of all 
one made of Indian meal. Pass the knife lightly around it to 
break the crust, then pull open with the fingers.

at night for breakfast. Butter a griddle and the inside of the 
muffin rings thoroughly. Set the rings on the griddle and half 
fill them with the batter. When one side is done turn the muffin, 
ring and all and bake a delicate brown. As they are done tear 
open, put a bit of butter in each and keep warm before the fire 
until served. Muffins should never be cut. Cold muffins may be 
toasted and served hot. Graham muffins are made the same way,

1 pint of new milk. 
^ teaspoonful of salt. 
Flour to make a stiff batter. 
Have iron gem-pans (the deep ones are better) well buttered 
and heated hot. Till and bake in a quick oven. 

The secret of gems is to mix them thick enough so that they 
will stand up in the tins — no thicker or they will be dry. Serve 
hot. These may be made of water instead of mUk. 

In making gems be sure to get them just thick enough to re- 
main in the tin without spreading. If too thick with flour they 
will be dry. Serve hot. Gems are quite as good made of watei 
as of mUk. 

Graham Gems may be made like quick muffins, substituting 
Graham flour for wheat, and using sweet or sour milk. 
Hygienic Graham Gems.—

baking-powder is well mixed; add the salt and eggs well beaten. 
Bake in well buttered waffle-irons. 

BATTRR GAKRS. 

PaM'Oakes and corn-bread require more baking powder than 
• other things. 

Waffles and griddle-cakes are not so good in the first lot as 
those that follow, because after the iron has been used it wiU be- 
come smooth and the heat more even. 

SHOBTENiNa, added in small quantities to gridflle-cakes, makes 
them more tender. 

Gktodles may be "greased" with a white turnip cut in halves.' 
Eub the griddle with the cut side. It causes no smoke or taste 
and is better than butter or dripping. A soapstoiie griddle re- 
quires nothing. 

Buckwheat Cakes should have a little of the batter saved as 
yeast for the next lot. To keep sweet, fill the vessel with cold 
water and keep until night in a cool place. Then pour off the water 
which will have absorbed the acidity, and mix as at first, using 
this reserve batter as yeast. If necessary stir in J teaspobnful of 
soda dissolved in hot water.

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

1 tablespoonf ul of lard. 
The rice may be omitted, if used, mash well. Corn-meal suffi- 
cient for a stiff batter. Add the beaten whites of eggs. ^ teaspoor- 
f ul of soda dissolved in a little milk may be added. Bake in s 
quick oven three quarters of an hour. If a broom splint is rap 
through and nothing adheres, the bread is done. A round pan j* 
better for corn-bread than a square one. 

Sweetened Johnny Cake. — 

1 quart of buttermilk. 

1 cupful of molasses. 

4 teacupf uls of Indian Meal. 

1 tablespoonful of soda. 

2 teacnpfuls of wheat floor. 
1 teaspoonful of salt. 

1 tablespoonful of lard. 
1 egg. 
Use less sweetening, if preferred. Bake in a quick oven. 
This rule will make two cakes. Use round tins, the cake will rise 
better. Some cooks take a small iron frying-pan and use to bak 
in, so that the cake may rise. Serve hot with plenty of butter, 
The same batter will make good corn-meal mufi&ns and excelleni 
■ fritters fried in hot lard. If made with sweet milk, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of cream -tartar must be added. 

Graham Fruit Mash. — Make a mush by stirring Graham 
flour slowly into boiling water. It must not be too thick. Cook 
20 minutes. Then stir in a few tablespoonfuls of milk or cream, 
and 1 cupful of fresh dates, chopped. Pigs may be used instead. 
also raisins or currants. Cook two minutes loager, taking care

not to scorch. Apples peeled and cut fine may be substituted, in 
vvliioh case it must be set back and allowed to simmer slowly until 
the apples are done. Stir the fruit into the mush thoroughly. 
Serve hot with cream and sugar or hard sauce. It is good 
poured into a mold or cup previously dipped in cold water to pre- 
vent sticking, and set away to cool. Serve as above with cream 
and sugar or hard sauce. 

Graham Mnsh, Plain. — Plain Graham mush made in the 
same manner, omitting the fruit and milk, and rather thin, 
served with cream and sugar, or some plain pudding sauce is very 
;;ood. What is left may be filled into a mold or pudding dish 
and shced to fry next morning for breakfast. 

Corn-meal Mush. — Salt boiling water and stir corn-meal in 
slowly untQ a thick smooth mush is formed. This may be served 
the same as Graham mush, and what is left may be fried next 
day. Boil slowly an hour. 

Fried Mnsh. — Make the mush as above, corn-meal or Gra- 
ham; better stiU, a mixture of the two will be foimd desirable. 
Put in a mold or pudding dish to cool and shoe for frying, or dip 
muffin rings in cold water, set on a plate and fill with mush, in 
the morning slip the stiffened shapes out. EoU either slices or 
circles in flour, and fry slowly in hot lard or dripping. Some 
cooks fry fresh mush, dropping it hot into a well buttered frying- 
pan. It is nice cut in slices and fried like doughnuts,' in lard suf- 
ficient to cover. Serve with molasses or maple syrup. 

Oatmeal.— 

2 cupfuls of oatmeal. 
1 teaspoonful of salt. 
8 cupfuls of boiling water. 

Put in a basin and stir well, set in a steamer and cook one and 
a half hours. A double boiler may be used to cook it in, or, a pail 
set in a kettle of boiling water. And if great care is used, it is 
possible to cook in a stew-pan on the stove. Steam cooked, or 
rolled oats may be cooked in much less time. If rolled bats, the 
quantity mentioned will cook during the time given for boiling the 
potatoes for breakfast. Serve with fruit, sugar, cream, butter or any. . 
plain pudding sauce. If steamed, part milk may be used in cooMng. 



t9€> THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Oatmenl Miish Fried.— The mush to fry should be stiff and 
dry. Mold in a deep dish, cut in slices and fry in butter and 
lard, equal parts. 

Pearl Wheat.— 

J cup of pearl wheat. 2 cups of milk. 

4 cups of water. 1 teaspoonful of salt. 

Let the milk and water boil up, then stir in the wb-eat. Put 
sn a double boiler or a pail, set in a kettle of boiling water. Boil 
two hours, let stand all night on the back of the range and in the 
morning heat up gradually just before serving. Oat-meal can be 
prepared in the same way. 

Cracked Wheat. — Use J of cracked wheat to f salted cold 
water. Cover closely and cook slowly, without stirring, for 3 hours. 
A double boiler is best. 

Oraunlated Graham.— 

1 cupful of the flakes. 1 quart boiling milk and water. 

Put in a deep dish. Cover. Set in hot water, and let the 
flakes swell until ready to serve. Five minutes' time is sufficient 
to prepare them for the table. Salt slightly. Serve with cream 
and sugar. 

Cerealiue. — 

1^ pints cerealine. 

1 quart of milk, or milk and water. 

Salt and butter to taste. Boil two or three minutes. Serve 
with cream and powdered sugar, or Vanilla sauce. A very delicate 
dish, if sliced when cold, and fried. 

Boiled Wheat. — Whole wheat grains may be soaked in cold 
water two or three hours, or over night; boiled in the same water 
two hours or until tender. Let simmer, and do not burn. To be 
eaten with milk and sugar, or maple syrup. A capital dish. 

W^heatlet. — Prepare same as Granulated Graham. Very nice. 

Cieam or Milk Toast. — Heat 1 pint of milk to boiling and 
add a tahlespoonful of flour rubbed smooth in a little cold milk, a 
teaspoonf'il of' butter and ^ teaspoonful salt. Pour this over ^ a 
dozen slices of nicely toasted bread. 

Some prefer to omit the flour, a little more butter may be 
added if this is done. 



BREAD. 197 

Fruit Toast. — Toast bread a golden brown. Dip each slice 
in boiling water for a second. Butter well. Lay slices in the 
bottom of a deep dish. Have currants, cherries or any preferred 
fruit, either fresh or canned, heated boiling hot and well sweetened. 
Cover the first shoe of toast well with the hot fruit, then add 
another slice, and another layer of fruit until the dish is full with 
fruit last layer. Serve hot or warm. This may be varied, and 
prepared still more quickly by substituting for the toast thick slices 
of well buttered bread and proceeding to cover with hot fruit as 
before. A nice and quick dessert. 

Cheese Toast. — Make some slices of toast, cut off their crusts, 
then butter them. Cut some cheese into thin flakes, and put in a 
saucepan with a piece of butter, and a little mustard if desired. 
Place the pan over the fire and stir until the cheese is melted, and 
the whole is well mixed and smooth; then pour the mixture on the 
toast and serve hot. 

Welsh Rarebit. — Put 4 ounces of cheese, sHced thin or 
grated, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream or milk, and a piece of butter 
the size of a walnut into a saucepan and boU, stirring it gently all 
the time until it becomes thick and smooth, then add a raw egg 
and a little Cayenne pepper. Put the saucepan again on the fire 
stirring until the whole is hot. Serve on squares of dry toast. 
This wUl be sufficient for four people. 

Chicken Sandwiches.— Chop the flesh of cold roast fowls 
fine. Season with pepper and salt, and spread J an inch thick 
between thin slices of buttered bread. If the ineat is very nice, it 
may be seasoned and laid in close neat strips between the buttered 
bread. 

German Toast. — 

2 tablespoonfuls sugar. 
J pint sweet milk. 
1 egg weU beaten. ■ 

Stir well, and in this mixture dip slices of bread (if very dry 
dip first in cold water), and fry on a buttered griddle a Ught brown 
on each side. Omit the sugar and afterward roll in powdered 
sugar if preferred. This is a delicate dish for tea. With the addi- 



198 THREK MEALS A DAY. 

tion of a hot plain pudding sauce with a pint of Zante currants, 
it makes an excellent dessert. 

Steamed Bread. — Steam half a loaf of stale bread (put it in 
a common steamer) until thoroughly softened. Cut in slices 1^ 
inches thick and serve with a hot plain pudding sauce for dessert, 
if a cupful of Zante currants be boiled up with the sauce it will be 
an improvement. 

Apple Toast. — Peel, core and slice 6 tart apples. Put 1 
tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan with the apples, scatter over 
them 2 tablespoonfuls white sugar. Stew quickly, stirring. Cut 3 
slices of bread ^ an inch thick, and fry both sides a light brown. 
Take up on a dish. Spread the apples on an inch thick. Dust 
over with powdered sugar and serve hot. 

Boiled Sandwiches. — Presh bread is a necessity for roUed 
sandwiches. Cut it lengthwise from the loaf in thin slices, so thin 
that it is necessary to butter the loaf evenly and thinly before 
cutting. Trim off the crust and cover the slice with a thin layer 
of ham grated or chopped. Chicken is sometimes used, in which 
case it must be seasoned slightly, and a little ham minced with it 
is an improvement. These sandwiches should be small. After the 
grated meat is spread on smoothly, roU up like a roll jelly cake, 
and one after the other wrap tightly in a long narrow cloth to 
keep in shape. Before serving tie each one vrith a bit of the 
narrowest possible ribbon. A party dish. 

Ham and Egg Sandwiches. — Chop the ham fine ; also as 
many hard-boiled eggs as required. Mix. Season with salt, pep- 
per and a little mustard. Moisten slightly with melted butter. 
Spread this mixture between thin slices of bread nicely buttered. 
If to be very nice trim off the crusts and cut the shces in two. 

Sandwiches. — Cut bread in thin even slices. Spread thinly 
with butter. Lay on a thin slice of pressed meat, cold tongue, 
veal, roast beef, or any of the preparations of grated ham or 
chicken given above. Lay over this another slice of thinly buttered 
bread, and cut in half thus forming two sandwiches. 

Chicken and Ham Bolls, a Party Dish. — Take out half the 
inside from French or light home-made rolls. Butter the cavity 
and fill up with a mixture of minced chicken and ham. 



P^ITTB^g. 



BEITTEES should be fried in as much lard as is required for 
doughnuts. The lard must be boiling hot, when the fritter 
will rise quickly to the top. They do not require turning 
over. Send to the table hot, having fresh hot ones to be sent in 
as wanted, for they become heavy if left long standing. 

Fhy the fritters as soon as the batter is ready that they may 
be perfectly light. Serve for tea or lunch with powdered sugar. 
Taken with a plain pudding sauce they make a very nice dessert. 
Syrup, too, is an appropriate sauce. Use common or maple syrup. 
Do i:ot make the batter too thick or it will brown on the outside 
before the center is cooked. 

Neveb stick a fork into anything frying in hot lard, as doing so 
allows it to absorb the fat. Take out with a skimmer or split spoon. 
FMii Fritters.— 
2 eggs. 

2 tablespoonfuls sugar. 
1 pint sour mUk. 

1 teaspoonful soda. 
^ teaspoonful salt. 
Flour for batter. 
Beat thoroughly. Drop a large tablespoonful at a time in hot 
lard. Fry brown and roll in powdered sugar. Make the batter 
about like pancakes. 

Plain Fritters (II).— 

3 cups of flour sifted. 3 eggs. 

1 pint sweet milk. 

2 teaspoonfuls baking powder. 
1 spoonful salt. 

Serve with sugar, syrup or a plain sauc«- 

(199) 



200 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Cream Fritters. — Mix a pint and a half of wheat flour with 
a pint of milk. Beat 6 eggs to a froth and stir them into the 
flour a li|;tle at a time, beating thoroughly. Grate in J nutmeg, add 
2 teaspoonfuls salt and 1 pint of cream. Stir just long enough to 
mix in the cream and drop by tablespoonfuls into boiling lard. 
Sprinkle powdered sugar and put a spoonful of jeUy or marmalade 
on each one. 

Oxford Fritters.— 

8 ounces of grated stale bread; soak in just sufficient 
mUk to cover it. When soft stir in — 

3 beaten eggs. 

1 tablespoonful flour. 

^ pound Zaute currants. 

J nutmeg grated. 
Make the mixture in balls the size of an egg and fry a light 
brown in hot lard. Serve plain or same as Cream Fritters. 
Apple Fritters.— 

1 quart sweet milk. 

3 eggs. 

12 apples chopped fine. 

^ teaspoonful salt. 

Flour for batter. 
Beat the eggs separately and add the whites whipped to a 
froth last of aU. This wUl take the place of baking powder. 
Stir the apples (chopped) into the batter thoroughly. It is an im- 
provement if the apples have been sprinkled lightly with lemon 
juice before stirring in. Serve with sweetened lemon juice, maple 
syrup, molasses or VaniUa Pudding Sauce. Cream and sugar, or 
butter and sugar will answer. 

Apple Fritters (II). — Prepare the apples. Make as the first 
fritter batter given in this department. Stir in the apples, fry and 
serve as above. Or make ^ the second batter given, using baking 
powder and stir in the apples, frying them. Use more eggs if 
wished very light, beating them separately. A teaspoonful of but- 
ter wiU make them more tender. Sliced apples (circular with the 
core removed) may be stirred in instead of the chopped fruit, and 



FRITTERS. ' 201 

the fritters dropped into the lard hy spoonfuls, one slice in each 
fritter. If tfie apples, either chopped or sliced, are sprinkled with 
lemon juice before using the flavor is improved. Place on a warm 
sieve to drain. Sift powdered sugar and cinnamon over them, or 
use any of the sauces given above. [A shallow pan is better for 
these and other chopped fruit fritters. If the lard is very deep 
they are apt to fly apart.] 
Banana Fritters.— 

1 cup of flour. 

2 eggs beaten separately. 
1 tablespoonf ul butter. 

1 cup milk or water. 

Add the whites of the eggs last of all, whipped to a stiff froth. 
Slice the bananas (three will answer) around (sprinkling with a 
little lemon wUl improve the flavor). Stir into the batter and fry 
by Spoonfuls in hot lard, having a slice of the banana in each 
fritter. Sift powdered sugar over them and serve. The daintiest 
possible dessert. 

A simpler way is to cut the bananas in two across and steep ' 
them in a syrup of sugar and water. After an hour, drain, roU in 
flour and fry in hot lard. Boil the sugar and water into a syrup 
and serve with them as a sauce. Peel first. 

Pineapple Fritters. — These may be made in the exact 
manner used for banana fritters, taking the rule first given. Omit 
the lemon. The pineapple wiU be improved by sprinkling the 
slices with sugar over night. Serve for dessert. 

Peach Fritters. — Make a batter same as for the first apple 
fritters, taking half the rule. 1 teaspoonful butter wUl make more 
tender. Peel and cut the peaches in halves, stir them in the bat- 
ter and fry in boiling fat until a deUcate brown. Place half in 
each fritter, drain in a sieve and dust with powdered sugar. Cream 
may be added if desired. 

Rice Fritters.— *

ths paste with a spoon until smooth and well cooked. Take from 
the fire and beat in the eggs thoroughly, one at a time. Beat a 
few minutes longer, and drop by spoonfuls into hot lard. Do not 
crowd, as they will expand and become hollow and light like cream 
puffs. Use lemon, vanilla or Imperial Pudding Sauce with them.

with almost any kind. * 




F^gT^]|Y. 



a LAZE pie crust for fruit, custard and other pies by brush- 
ing over the under crust with a little beaten egg just before 
filling with the pie mixture. If the pie is very delicate in 
color use the beaten white of the egg only; this will prevent the 
crust from becoming soaked with ihe juices of the pie. 

Tart Shells may be very ornamentally glazed, by removing 
from the oven when partly baked, brushing over yyith the beaten 
white of an egg and then covering thickly with powdered white 
sugar. Sprinkle with a few drops of water and return to the 
oven. 

Pbuit juices, pie-plant, etc., may be prevented from boiling 
out of the crust in several ways. 

1st. Put the usual quantity of sugar for the pie in a bowl. 
Add enough cold water to form a kind of dough ; stir in a heap- 
ing tablespoonful of flour, or a level teaspoonful of com starch 
and mix thoroughly. Pour this over the pie-plant or otiaer fruit. 
Add the top crust and bake in a hot oven. 

Another: Dust some flour on the bottom crust before filling, 
and in making pies of fresh fruit put the sugar on the bottom 
crust. Or roll up a small tube of white writing paper and insert 
in an opening in center of the upper crust, letting the lower end 
rest on the imder crust and* the upper project above the pie. The 
juice wiU collect in this and it may be removed when the pie is 
done. 

A TABLESPO MwuL of flouT may be substituted in a squash oi 
pumpkin pie as equa^ in value to 1 egg. 



PASTRY. 205 

A MARBLE SLAB is muoh nicer for rolling out pastry than an 
ordinary bread-board, as it keeps the dough cool and firm. 

Dough for pie-crust should always be rolled one way, from 
you. Turn the crust each time, and roll in the same direction 
until it is the required shape. 

Pie without an upper crust should always have a heavy edge; 
and lay on a narrow strip and pihoh together, or cut off the crust 
somewhat larger than the tin and roll this over with the fingers- 

Pastry is very much improved by being kept on ice an houT 
before rolling out, 

IcE-WATER, or the very coldest obtainable, should be used i» 
mixing pastry. 

Undee-orust of pies should be a little the thicker. 

Two KINDS of crust may be used in making a quantity of pies. 
One way of doing this is to make the dough of moderate richness, 
take a Httle more than half the crufet and roll in more butter 01 
lard, spread and fold, roU out; repeat this once or twice, thus 
giving a flakey upper-crust. Take the plainer portion for the under 
crust. Some cooks make two distinct kinds of dough, one very 
nice for the upper crust, and the othei: shortened with any kind of 
dripping for the under- crust. This will be found qtiite an econom- 
ical arrangement. 

Good pastry may be made by using as little water as possible 
to get the dough in shape. Let the water be very cold; knead the 
crust slightly. Place in a weU-heated oven as soon as the pie is ready. 

Butter pie-tins well, though some expert cooks simply flour 
them. 

An APPLE-EiE may require forty minutes, while a rich lemon- 
pie will cook in twenty. 

Mdjce-mes may be made in quantities and kept in a cool place 
until needed. 

PuMPKiN-PLOUR can be bought at any grocery, with full 
directions for using. This makes pies fully as nice as the fresh 
pumpkin, with less trouble. 

CoRN-MEAL added in the proportion of ^ to | flour makes pie- 
crust more light and digesliible. 



2o6 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Biscuit pie-crust is very wholesome. 

Apples used for mince pies need not be peeled. Wash, diy 
and chop fine. This will be found a saving in labor. 

Dbieid Apples, soaked over night and chopped fine, may be 
substituted for the fresh fruit in mince-meat. 

Deibd Frutt, prepared with sugar, such as dried cherries, 
gooseberries, etc, may be substituted instead of raisins ip 
mince pies. Soak over night in as little water as possible and 
throw in both water and fruit. This will be found very nice, as 
well as economical. 

Whi?;]!! Potatoes, chopped fine ^nd soaked over night in vine- 
gar, are sometimes used as a substitute for apples in mince-meat. 

Feuit Pies take less sugar if they are sweetened after baking. 
Eemove the upper crust to put in the sugar. 

Wild Gbapbs may be preserved for winter use by putting in a 
jar and covering with molasses. These will be found very nice 
for pies. 

Meeingue is a frosting made of the beaten white of an egg 
sweetened to the taste and spread over pies or custards. It must 
be put in the oven always to harden. 

Apples cut in quarters and stewed in sweet cider or molasses 
are good for plain pies. Season with cinnamon or nutmeg. This 
wiU keep several months. 

Gbeen Apples, when quite small, may be stewed whole with 
the skins on, strained when soft and sweetened. These make nice 
pies. Use just water enough to prevent burning. 

Deied Apples should be soaked over night. Have boiling 
water to cover them and stew soft. If not tart put in lemon juice 
or sour cider. When they are partly stewed a little orange peel 
cooked with them gives a line flavor. Season with sugar and nut- 
meg. Strain through a colander. Make very good pies. 

Pumpkins that have commenced to decay may be preserved by 
cutting up the best parts, stewing until soft, sweetening well with 
sugar and molasses and seasoning with ginger. Scald in the sea- 
soning thoroughly. Keep in a stone jar in a cool place. When 
wonted for use thin the desired amount with milk and eggs. 



PASTRY. acw 

PIRS. 

1 quart flour, before sifting. 
1 cupful butter or lard. 
^ teaspoonfiil salt, 
1 level teaspoonf ul baking-powder. 
Cold water sufficient to work the dough in shape. 
l)o not touch the paste with the hands until ready to roll out. 
Chop shortening and flour together with a knife. Have the lard 
or butter cold as possible. When well cut together add water 
gradually, still cutting, until the whole is in form. Be careful, in 
adding the water, not to allow the dough to become wet in spots. 
This rule will be sufficient for 2 large pies. Divide in half. 
Take one piece and use a little more than half for the crust, and 
roU out, following the directions given at the head of this chapter. 
Cover the pie dish, glaze if necessary, fill, roll the upper crust a 
httle thinner, cutting several openings in it for the escape of 
steam, pinch the edges of the two together after trimming neatly 
with a knife. Proceed in the same manner with the dough for the 
other pie. 

To make the pies still nicer, J of the shortening may be left 
out, and the pastry intended for the upper crust can be rolled flat, 
spread with butter or lard, sprinkled with flour, folded together 
and rolled again, repeating this operation until the shortening is 
used. This will give a flakey upper crust. Instead of spreading 
the lard, it may be cut in bits and dotted over the surface; sprin- 
kle with flour and roll as before. 

Even less shortening may be used, as the presence of the 
baking-powder in some degree supplies its place. The powder 
should be sifted with the flour first of all. 
Puff Paste.— 

1 pound flour. 
1 pound butter. 
Mix J the butter with the flour, quite stiff, using as little eold 
water as possible. Eoll out, cut part of the jemaining buttej, In 
bits and dot over the paste, dredge well with flour, fold over roll 



2o8 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

lightly together and set aside in a cool place for a few nunutes, 
then roll them again, put on butter and dredge as before, roll up 
and then roll out. Bepeat this until the butter is gone. Do it 
quickly and handle as little as possible. 

Puff paste is only for upper crusts. Use a plain paste for the 
under crust. Puff paste will keep a week on ice. 
Cream Pie-crust. — 

1 pint sifted floui . 
J teaspoonful baking-powder. 
Sweet cream enough to make a stiff paste. 
This will make 3 medium-sized pies. 
Epicurean Pie-crust. — 

1 pint flour, 
legg. 

^ small cupful water. 

2 heaping tablespoonfuls butter. 

Out 1 tablespoonful of the butter up with the flour. Break 
the egg into a bowl, beat up light, add the water and mix the 
flour into a stiff dough with this. Take the half desired for the 
upper crust and spread with part of the butter left, fold together 
and roU out. Eepeat this once more, or until the butter is gone. 

Healtllfnl Pie-crust. — Good crusts for plain pies are made 
with rich milk turned sour, using a half teaspoonful soda to a 
large cupful of the milk. Still better crusts are made of sour 
3ream sweetened in the same way with soda. 

Mealy potatoes boiled in salted water and mixed with the 
same quantity of flour and wet with sour milk sweetened in the 
same way with soda, make a good crust. 

Hygienic Cream Crust. — Equal quantities of Graham flour, 
white flour and Indian meal. Bub evenly together and wet with 
very thin sweet cream. Eoll thin and bake in an oven as hot as 
for common pie -crust. 

Fie Shells. — Make a rich pie crust, and line pie tins, or 
saucers; prick several times with a fork and bake in a quick oven. 
Put away in a stone jar, or in a bread box, and when needed fill 
with cranberry sauce, apple sauce or any kind of canned fruit. 
Heat through in the oven, which may be done by putting the crust 



PASTRY. 809 

in a pie tin. Or make a custard of any kind, put one of the 
shells in a pie tin, fill with the custard and bake. These are eon' 
venient for an emergency. 

Green Apple Pie. — Pare and core tart ripe apples. Slice 
thin. Fill the under crust. Add a small teacupful of sugar, 2 
tablespoonfuls of water. Dredge the top well with flour. Dot 
over with bits of butter; flavor with cinnamon or nutmeg. Add 
the upper crust. Bake about forty minutes. If the apples are not 
tart enough add the lemon juice. A nice apple sauce may be used 
in pie shells. See above. Sweet cream may be served with apple pies. 
Apple Meringue Pie. — Line a pie pan with an under crust, 
fill with smooth stewed apples and bake. Beat the whites of 2 
eggs to a stiff froth with 1 tablespoOnful powdered sugar; flavor 
with a few drops of extract of cinnamon or nutmeg. Spread this 
over the top of the pie and brown lightly in the oven. The white 
of 1 egg can be used for meringue. 

Apple Custard Pie. — Pare, slice and stew ripe tart apples. 
Mash very fine, or put through a colander. For each pie allow: 
1 yolk of egg. 
1 cupftd sugar. 
1 teaspoonful butter. 
f cupful rich sweet milk.

crust is done. Beat the white of the eggs to a stiff froth, with 2 
tablespoonfuls sugar. Spread this over the top of the pie as a 
meringue, Eetum to the oven and brown slightly. This makes 
one pie. This recipe may be varied by using 1 egg only, stirring 
yolk and white together, inclosing the mixture between two crusts, 
and baking like an apple or other fruit pie. 
Lemou Pie, Rich.— 

Juice and grated yellow rind of 1 large, or 2 small

ready the beaten whites of 2 eggs sweetened by 2 tablespoonfuls 
white sugar and flavored with a few drops of rose water. Spread 
this over the top of the pie and return to the oven to set, not brown. 
This pie should be just cold for dinner. The 3 yolks of the eggs 
may be utilized for the preparation of the lemon pie with two

water in place of the milk. This is a one-crust pie. Use the 
white of the egg for a frosting. 
Tinegar Pie (One Crust). — 
1^ cups good vinegar. 

2 cups sugar. 
1 cup water. 

1 tablespoonful butter, 
flavor with lemon extract. 



213 THREE MEALS A DAY, 

Put in a stewpan on the stove. While this is heating take 5 
yolks of eggs beaten with 1 cup water and 2 heaping tablespoonfuls 
flour. When the vinegar comes to a boU put in the eggs and flour, 
stirring until well cooked. Have four pie-tins lined with pastry, 
fill with the mixture and bake. Beat the whites of the eggs to a 
stiff froth with 4 tablespoonfiils white siisrar. When the pies are 
done spread this over them and return to the oven a few minutes. 
These pies can be baked in two crusts by using four eggs, whites 
and yolks both, and covering with an upper crust. The rule will 
make four pies. 

Yinegar Pie (Two Crusts). — Put the under crust in the pan. 
Spread upon this 1 cup sugar, 1 large tablespoonf ul flour, some orange 
peel shredded fine, J a cup of vinegar, ^ a cup boiling water.

Secure it closely around the edges that the filling may not boil 
eat. Let the top bake firs.t. Twenty minutes should be enough. 
On^ teaspoonful butter may be added. 

^: Rhubarb Pie. — Peel the stalk and cut in small bits. Line 
deep plates with crust. Put in the rhubarb with a thick layer of 
sugar to each layer of the fruit. A little lemon extract, peel, or juice 
improves it. Dredgo with the flour, dot over with bits of butter and 
cover with a crust, having openings for the escape of steam. Bake 
one hour in a slow oven. Some cooks stew the rhubarb before 
making into pies, but this is by no means the better way.

to use for making into pies. In this way one may lessen the 
amount of raisins, etc., to be used, and can omit citron altogethei^ 
Spices may be altered to suit the taste. The canned fruit not

3 well beaten eggs. Sweeten to taste with brown sugar ; flavor 
with 1 teaspoonful each of cinnamon and ginger; nutmeg may be 
added, and 1 spoonful of salt. If the milk is not rich add a small 
teaspoonful of butter to this quantity. A littlfe molasses a^ded 
makes the pies a lichra: eolor. 
PHmpkiH Pie 11. — 1 egg. 

1 quart of pumpkin. 

2 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch. 
1 quart of milk. 

Sweeten and flavor as before. This will be found very gooa. 
Bake in round or square pie-tins in 1 crust. Put in a quick oven 
and as soon as they puff up remove. Slip out of the pans on to 
thick folded paper or a clean cloth. • - 

The rim of pumpkin pies is very apt to scorch before the fill- 
ing is baked sufficiently. Oh this account it is a good plan to heat 
the prepared pumpkin scalding hot before turning into thie pie^ 
tins. Bake at onee that the under-crust may not grow clammy. 

Pumpkin Pie without Eggs.— Stew and sift in the ordi- 
nary manner. Add enough milk to make about i thicker than for 
common pumpkin pie. Sweeten with equal quantities of sugar and 
molasses The milk being turned boiling hot upon the pumpkin

eggs had been used. This will be found palatable and quite 
hygienic without spices, but may be flavored as other pumpkin 
pies and can hardly be told from them. Make the pumpkin about 
the consistency of common cake batter for this pie. 

Squash Pie. — Steam a Hubbard squash, when it is done rub 
through a colander. To every quart of sifted squash add: 

5 well-beaten eggs.

brown. 

Ornamental Cream Pie. — Use the same fiUing as for Mock 
Cream Pie, putting a layer of red currant or other bright colored 
jelly, first in the crust, then the cream filling, and afterward the 
meringue or frosting. This pie when cut is decidedly ornamental 
in appearance as well as delicious in flavor. 

Cream Berry Tart. — Line a dish with paste and fill with 
fresh raspberries, strawberries or blackberries made very sweet 
with powdered sugar. Cover with rather a thick paste, but do not 
pinch down the edges. When done, lift up the top crust and pour

Castard Pie, Plain. — Boil a quart of milk with ^ dozen 
peach leaves or the rind of a lemon. Turn it ofi and let cool. Stir 
in 4 beaten eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls of sugar, a pinch of salt. This 
will make two pies." 'Bake in deep pie dishes with one crust. One 
teaspoonful of cornstarch or 1 tablespoonful of flour rubbed smooth 
with cold milk and boUed with the milk, after the flavoring leaves 
are removed, will take the place of 1 egg. There should be a heaw 
rim to all one-crust pies. Vanilla makes a pleasant flavor. L; 
flour is used and peach leaves omitted, the milk need not .

Cocoanut Pie. — 1 cup of grated cocoanut, if dessicated soak 
over night in milk ; if fresh, this will be unnecessary. Put this 
in a large cofEee cup and fill up with milk. When ready to bake, 
take 3 teaspoonfuls of flour, mix smooth with 1 cupful of milk, 
place on the stove and stir until it thickens. To prevent scorch- 
ing it is best to put the dish in a kettle of boiling water. While

2 yolks of eggs. 

A pinch of salt. 

i cupful of sugar. 

Cocoanut.

Washington Cream Pie. — Made a cake as for Washington 
pie, bake in two or three layers and spread the cream used for 
making Mock-cream Pie. Delicious. Serve cold. 

Ripe Tomato Pie. — ^Line a pie-plate with a nice crust. Peel 
and slice sufficient tomatoes, (half ripe ones are really better), to 
fill the pie. Sprinkle over the top J cupful of sugar, 1 teaspoonful 
of flour, butter, the size of a walnut, cut this in bits, and flavor 
with lemon. Cover with an upper crust. 

Green Tomato Pie. — Take 12 common-sized tomatoes. 
Wipe, peel and parboil until turning soft. Turn off the water and 
place in the pie-dish lined with crust. Add — 
4 tablespoonfuls vinegar. 
Butter size of a walnut. 
1 teaspoonful flour,

prevent the juice escaping. If ripe tomatoes are used omit the 
parboiling. 

Zante Currant Pie. — Glean and stew in water, When done 
sweeten, dredge in flour enough to thicken the juice. Bake with 
two crusts or take either of the recipes given for Eaisin Pie and 
prepare the currants in the same manner. 

Sweet Potato Pie. — Boil the potatoes very soft. Peel, mash 
and put through a colander. Have a pie-dish lined with paste. To 
1 cupful of the potatoes add

at a time, then the eggs and flavoring. Fill the paste -lined tins 
and bake. This will make two large, or three small pies. 

Carrot Pie. — Make same as Sweet Potato Pie. This i6 
healthful and nourishing even for dyspeptics if the Hygienic Cream 
Pie-crust is used.

Molasses Pie. — Line a tin with plain paste. Put ^ teacup 
molasses, then a layer of crust, thin as a wafer, then more niolasses 
and again a thin crust. (Jover with niolasses, put on the top crust. 
Bake. Very nice way to use left-over paste. 

Huskleberry or Elderberry Pies. — Line a pie -tin with 
good paste. FiU with the berries. Add f cup sugar, 2 table- 
spoonfuls vinegar and a dusting of flour. Put on an upper crust 
and bake. Lemon juice may be used instead of vinegar and will 
be found an improvement. Canned berries may be used in the 
same way. Currants mixed with either of the berries gives a 
good tart. Omit the vinegar in this ease. 

Peach Pie. — Slice and filF the pie, seasoning with sugar, & 
dusting of flour and a little water. If the peaches are not mellow 
stew them before making into a pie. Bake with two crusts or 
make as a Tart Pie.

over night, stewed soft and sweetened before making into pies. 
Bake with two crusts. 

Currant and Gooseberry Pies. — Currants and gooseberries 
are the best for pies when half green, though they wiU answer 
whtn ripe. Currants mixed with ripe raspberries make good pies. 
Green currants and gooseberries will be found sweeter for pies if 
the sugar is scalded in before using. Stew them on a moderate 
fire with 1 teacup of water to 2 quarts of the fruit. When they 
begin to break add sugar in the proportion of § cups of sugar to 
a pint of the fruit. Let scald a few minutes. Dredge the pies 
with flour, cover with an upper crust. . When used without stew- 
ing put to each layer of fruit a thick layer of sugar. Use a littie 
flour and 2 tablespoonfuls of water to each pie. Green currant 
pies are good sweetened with molasses and sugar mixed. 

Grape Pie. — Grapes make the best pies when green. If not 
very small they should be stewed and strained to remove the seeds. 
Sweeten to the taste when stewed. Dredge with flour. If made 
into a pie without stewing put a thick layer of sugar to each layer 
of fruit and add a tablespoonful of water and dust with flour. 
Bake with two crusts. All fruit pies should have a slit in the 
crust for the escape of steam.

the dish. Cover over with a crust, pressing it down around the 
edge. Or line a pie-plate with the paste and fill with the stewed 
fruit. Lay strips of the pie-crust across the top and bake. This 
amount will make two pies. Cranberries can be baked with two 
crusts if wished. 

Strawberry Tart Pie. — Arrange the berries in layers in a 
pie dish lined with paste. Fill very fuU as strawberries shrink 
very much in cooking. Sweeten well with white sugar. Cover

TARTS AND GHRB.SR GAKR8. 

Tart Shells. — These are a most convenient resource for the 
housekeeper in case of unexpected guests, as well as a pretty and 
ornamental dish for the table. The ends of paste left from pies 
may often be turned to good account in this manner. Line small 
tins or patty-pans with paste, pricking with a fork to prevent blis- 
tering. Bake and set away. Fill them as needed with jelly or 
preserved fruit. These shells may be glazed by brushing over with 
the yolk of an egg before putting in the oven. (See page 204).

^ lemon, juice only. 
1 tablespoonful corn-starch. 
Beat aU together weU and bake in tart shells without cover. 
Apple Tarts. — Line patty-pans with nice crust. Put in each, 
chopped apple and a little white sugar; bake in a moderate oven 
and let cool. Whip a little cream very stiff, sweeten slightly and 
flavor with a drop or two of lemon or vanilla. Just before serving, 
cover the apple in each tart with the whipped cream. A drop of 
currant jelly on the top of each one adds to the effect.

Chocolate Tarts.— 

1 quart milk. 
1 cupful sugar. 

14 tablespoonfuls bread-crumbSg 
' 6 eggs. 

12 tablespoonfuls grated chocolate. 
1 table spoonful vanilla extract. 
Beat the sugar and eggs light. Scald the milk and pour hot 
over the bread and chocolate. Add the eggs and sugar. Put inta 
tart shells and bake one-half hour in a moderate oven. When 
done sprinkle white sugar over the top. 

Cream Tarts. — Use very nice pastry for the tart shells or 
puffs. Serve perfectly cold with whipped cream. Heap them up 
weU with the cream and set in a cool place. 
Cream Paffs.— 

1 cupful of hot water. 
J cupful butter. 
Boil together and while boiling stir in 1 cup of sifted flour dry. 
Take from the stove and stir to a thin paste, and after this cools 
stir in 3 eggs (unbeaten). Stir it five minutes. Drop in table- 
spoonfuls on a buttered tin and bake in a quick oven twenty-five 
minutes, opening the oven door no oftener than is absolutely neces- 
sary and being careful that they do not touch each other in the 
pan. This amount will make twelve puffs. 
Cbeam fob Above: 

1 cupful of milk. 
1 cupful sugar. 
1 egg. 

3 tablespoonfuls flour. 
Vanilla to flavor. 
Stir the flour in a little of the milk. BoU the rest; turn 
this in and stir until the whole thickens. When both this 
and the puffs are cool open the puffs a little way with a sharp 
knife, and fill them with the cream. These never fail to puff. 
This cream may be filled into other tart shells and be found very nice. 
Almond Cheese Cakes. — Blanch four ounces of sweet al- 
monds. Eeduce them to a paste with a wine glass of rose water.

226 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Add 4 tablespoonfuls of white sugar and three eggs well- beaten. 
Mix and beat thoroughly. Bake in tart shells, first garnishing the 
top with almonds cut in thin slips. 

Bread Cheese Cakes. — Slice a five-cent loaf as thin as pos- 
sible. Pour over it a pint of boiling cream. Let stand two hours. 
Beat very fine. Add 8 eggs, ^ pound butter, 1 grated nutmeg, ^ 
pound Zante currants, 1 tablespoonful rose water. Beat well to- 
gether and bake in patty-pans lined with nice pastry. 

Rice Cheese Cakes. — These may be 'made in the same man- 
ner as Bread Cheese Cakes, taking 2 cupfiils of cold boiled rice. 
Proceed as above, adding 1 cupful of white sugar in addition to 
above rule. 

Lemon Cheese Cakes.— 

^ pound butter, 

f pound sugar, creamed together. 

Grated yellow rind of 2 lemons, the juice of 1. 

4 yolks of eggs and 2 whites beaten separately. 
Stir all together over the fire until the sugar is dissolved and 
bake in puffs. Any nice pastry will answer for these. Eoll out 
as for Chantilly Tarts. These puff shells are prettier than tart 
shells for any kind of tarts. Either tarts or cheese cakes make a 
dainty dessert. 

Curd Cheese Cakes. — Put 1 tablespoonful liquid cheese ren- 
net in 1 quart of fresh milk. Set this near the stove until the cur^ 
rises. Pour off tlie whey and mix with the curd i cupful butter, | 
cupful white sugar, 1 grated nutmeg, the yolks of 2 and the whita 
of 1 egg. Beat thoroughly, adding 6 ounces of Zante currants. 
Flavor with 2 tablespoonfuls rose water. Bake in tart or pufl 
shells. Sprinkle with white sugar. 

SHORT-GAKRS. 

Strawberry Short-Cake.- 

1 quart of flour. 

3 teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. 

f cupful of butter. 

llilk or water to mi:^ soft. 



PASTRY. 207 

Divide into two or three equal parts and roll out acoordmg to 
tke size of baking tin. Place each layer in the tin ; spread melted 
fentter between them only, putting none on the last layer. When 
baiked the layers wUl sepairate easily. 

Short-cake may be made after any oi^er rule, with sour milk, 
soda, etc., but baking in layers will be found an improvement. 
Spread on each layer strawberries and sugar, lay on the upper- 
crust and pour over all any juice that may be left. This will be 
improved by serving with sweetened cream. Berries of any kind 
— cherries, sliced peaches or stewed apples may be served in the 
same manner. Cut through all the layers in serving. Some 
cooks roll the dough thin and bake in layer cake-tins. If not very 
thick several must be lised. Unless there is an extra amount of 
shortening in the cake each layer must be buttered before covering 
with the berries. 

Cream Raspberry Short-Cake. — 

1 pint of rich sour cream. 
1 teaupoonful of soda. 
Pinch of salt. 
Flour to make a soft dough. 

BoU to the thickness of an inch and a half; bake, separate 
and butter; or, better still, make four layers,' spreading each one 
with butter. Bake in a deep tin, layer upon layer. . Sweeten 
the berries well between the crusts, covering each layer of fruit 
with whipped sweet cream. Cover the top with the whipped 
cream and dust with powdered sugar. 

Peach Short-Cake. — Make a plain baking-powder crust; 
bake in two tins ; butter each side well and alternate the layers of 
crust with sliced and sugared peaches. Cover |the top crust with 
a thick dashing of powdered sug^r. Serve with sweetened cream. 

Cranberry Short-Cake. — This can be made in the same 
manner, having the fruit thoroughly stewed and sweetened. 
Spread between the layers of crust thickly. Beserve th« extra 
juice to serve as ^uce. 

Api^le ^M)rt-€^Jee. — -Ms a stM batte m for bkcnit. Put

replace the top, dusting over with sugar, and serve plain, with 
sweetened cream or milk. Other fruit may be served in the same 
way. Powdered sugar is best. 
STreet Short-Cake.— 

1 cupful of powdered sugar. 
1 tablespoonful of butter. 
3 eggs. 

1 cupful of flour, sifted with 1 teaspoonful of baking- 
powder. 
3 tablespoonfuls of cream. 
Bake in jelly-cake tins. When done lay one upon the other, 
sprinkling each' with powdered sugar. Cut through the layers as 
for a pie; serve in saucers with sweetened cream poured over it. 

Lemon Short-Cake. — Make a rich short-cake. Bake in 
jeUy-cake tins; let cool and spread with the lemon filling for lemon 
layer cake. Dust sugar over the top and serve. 

Jelly Short-Cake. — Can be made in the same way, substi- 
tuting jelly for lemon-butter. 
Orange Short-Cake.— 

1 quart of flour. 
1 egg, well-beaten. 
I cupful of butter. 
1 tablespoonful of sugar. 
3 teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. 
Milk for a soft dough. 
Roll J inch thick, bake in round tins in a quick oven. 
FmiiiNG: — Eoll 3 large oranges and 1 lemon; press the juice 
into a bowl. Eemove the peel, chop all the pulp fine and add to 
the juice, with 1 cupful of granulated sugar. 

Epicurean Short-Cake. — Prepare a short-cake as for Sweet- 
ened Short-Cake. When cold put strawberries and sugar between 
each layer and over the top. Serve with cream and powdered 
sugar. 

DUMPIaIMGS. 

Bags for boiling dumplings or puddings, should be made of 
thick cotton cloth. Before using dip in water, wring out and flour 



PASTRY. 239 

inside. When the dumpling or pudding is put in, tie the bag ti^btj 
leaving plenty of room for the contents to swell. Indian and flour 
puddings require a great deal of space. 

An old plate should be put at the bottom of the ketfle to pre- 
vent the bag sticking. 

Dumplings or puddings, when they have been in the water a 
few minutes, should be turned to prevent settling and heaviness. 

Water should be kept of a sufficient depth in the kettle to 
cover the pudding. It should not be allowed to stop boiling for 
an instant. 

Dip the bag in cold water for an instant when done, and the 
dumpling or pudding will come out easily. 

Steamhto is really an easier and preferable way of cooking 
either puddings or dumplings. Set a plate in the bottom of the 
steamer if a bag is used instead of a pudding dish. Place the 
dumplings or pudding nicely tied up on this, and keep the water 
in the kettle beneath boiling constantly. One economy in this case 
is that vegetables or meat may be cooked in the kettle while the 
pudding is being steamed. Prepare the cloth or bag in the same 
way as for boiling. 

Baking is also resorted to in the preparation of dumplings. 

Dumpling Crust— 

2 cupfuls sweet milk. 

1 saltspoonful salt. 

2 tablespoonfuls lard or, butter. 

1 teaspoonful soda. 

2 teaspoonfuls cream-tartar. 
Flour to make a soft dough. 

Water may be used with the addition of 1 or 2 well beaten 
eggs, using the other materials in the same manner. 
Suet Crust— 

^ pound chopped beef suet. 
f pound flour. 
1 saltspoonful salt. 
Cold water to make a dough. 
Work it well. Beat with the rolling pin and roll out. Nice 
for any boiled fruit pudding. 



330 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Boiled Apple Dumplings.— Pare tart mellow apples. 
Kemove the cores mth an apple corer, or a small, sharp knife. 
Fill the openings with sugar. Make a good pie cnist. Eoll out f 
of an inch thick. Cut in squares just large enough to enclose 1 
apple. Lay the apples on them and bring the corners together. 
Tie each one in a small floured cloth, leaving room to swell. Drop 
in boiling water and let cook one hour. Serve with pudding sauce, 
or butter and sugar. A biscuit crust, either baking powder or soda, 
may be substituted for the pie-crust paste. Molasses is a very nice 
sauce for apple dumplings. 

Baked Apple Damplings.— Prepare a crust after the 
recipe given for dumpling crust. Eoll out, cut in squares and in 
the center of each lay a tart apple pared, cored and quartered, 
bring the comers together closely. Lay in a deep buttered baking 
tin with the joined edges down. Pour a cupful of water aroimd 
them, J cupful of sugar and dot the top plentifully with bits of 
butter. Bake in the oven until done. Serve as they are, the 
butter, sugar and water making a nice sauce. A variation may be 
made by working a little, butter into raised bread dough, rolling out 
thin and enclosing an apple, as above, in each dumpling. They 
may be either baked or boiled. 

Lemon Damplings.— 

J pound grated bread. 
I pound finely chopped suet. 
^ pound sugar. 
1 lemon. 

Squeeze the juice over the sugar and chop th^ '^gt 
very fine. 

1 large tart apple grated. 

2 tablespoonf uls flour. 
2 well-beaten eggs. 

Mix well together. Divide in eight parts and tie each one in 
a well floured piece of cotton cloth. Put a plate in the bottom of 
the kettle and drop the dumplings into boiling water. Boil thirty 
minutes. Serve with maple syrup. 

Peach Dumpling. — Make a dumpling paste after any of the 
rules given and prepare as for Apple Dumpling, slicing the peaches, 



PASTRY. 231 

Let cook two hotirs. Serve with hard sauce, plain pudding eauce, 
or butter and sugar. 

Sliced apples, blackberries, cherries, huckleberries or any 
other fruit can be used in the same way. 

Dough Dumplings. — Bisen bread dough made into balls 
the size of apples and boiled a long time in a kettle of boUing 
water are nice eaten hot with molasses. A' little shortening may 
be worked in, but they are good without. 

Light Dumplings. Take a pan of nice light biscuit just 
ready for the oven, and when the potatoes are ready to boil for 
dinner put the biscuit in the steamer over the kettle. Cook one- 
half hour or until the potatoes are done. Serve hot with sweet- 
ened cream seasoned with nutmeg. Crushed strawberries or any 
kind of stewed fruit is nice to serve with them. Tear open with 
a fork. 

Steamed Apple Dumplings.— Slice enough tart apples to 
fill a deep pudding-dish | full. Put over the stove with enough 
water to cook the apples, and when they begin to boil cover with a 
closely-fitting crust of biscuit dough. Make an opening in the 
center to let the steam escape ; cover closely. Cook one-half 
hour. Thedough should be several inches thick when done. Serve 
with a hot sweet pudding-sauce. 

This dumpling may be made in a tin-pail, lining the sides 
with paste also. Small fruit of any kind may be used (without 
stewing). Put the pail in a kettle of boUing water; stand it on an 
inverted saucer to prevent burning. Let the water boil around the 
pail, not over it. 

Dessert Noodles. — Make noodles according to rule. Cut in 
pieces ^ inch wide, throw in boiling salted water and let boil up 
two or three times. Dish, pour some melted butter over, add sugar 
and cinnamon to taste. Serve immediately. 

Boiled Dumpling or Roly-Poly.— Take any of the pasties 
given before. Eoll out ^ inch thick, spread with strawberries, 
blackberries, sliced peaches, pitted cherries or stewed cranberries. 
Sprinkle with sugar. If tart fruit, such as cranberries, is used 
considerable sugar will be required. Any kind of fruit jam or 
marmalade is very nice spread on in place of the fresh fruit. 



«32 THREE MEALS A CAY. 

Leave the outside edges uncovered and wet them with cold 
water. Roll the crust up carefully, join the ends and lay the 
pudding in a thick white towel or cloth, roll the dumpling 
up, tie the ends and put in a kettle of boiling water. Boil 
one hour and serve with a rich pudding-sauce. A hot sauce 
is nice. The pudding may he steamed instead of boiled. 
Sliced tart apples may be used in this manner. 

Cut in slices from the end when serving. Put a lump of 
butter and a large spoonful of sugar on the center of each 
slice as the pudding is served, if of apples. 

Dried apple-sauce, beaten fine and not too juicy, may be 
prepared in the same manner. 

KRUIT DESSERTS, BAKED OR 
STEANIED. 

Apple Jonathan.— 

1 pint of sweet milk. 
1 egg, beaten. 

1 small teaspoonful of soda. 
^ teaspoonful of salt. 

2 small teaspoonfuls of cream-tartar. 
Flour to make a batter rather thin. 

Have 4 or 5 large apples peeled and chopped ; stir and 
pour in a well-buttered pudding-dish and steam or bake. 
Sour milk and soda may be used instead of sweet for the 
batter. Serve warm with butter and sugar, sweetened cream 
or pudding-sauce. 

Birds' Nests.— 

1 quart sweet milk. 

3 well-beaten eggs. 

1 pint of bread-crumbs, soaked in the milk.' ■ 
J cupful of sugar. 
. 1 tablespoonful of butter. 
1 teaspoonful of baking-powder. 
Pare 6 or 8 nice tart apples, dig out the cores, fill the 
cavities with sugar and sprinkle sugar over the top. 

Put the apples in a buttered pudding-dish, pour batter 



PASTRY. 233 

over all. Bake or ateam one hour. Serve with preferred 
pudding sauce. 

This recipe may be altered by substituting for the bread- 
crumbs flour enough for a batter about like muffins; 1 egg may be' 
omitted in this case, otherwise follow the rule. If desired the 
apples may be sliced and sugar sprinkled over them. If baked, 
half a cup of water should be poured over the apples before the 
batter is added. 

If more convenient a sour milk and soda batter may be sub- 
stituted. Graham flour is preferred by many to wheat, as more 
healthful. 

Brown Betty. — ^Put in a pudding-dish 2 pared and sliced 
tart apples, a little salt and nutmeg, some sugar and dot with bits 
of butter, then a layer of fine bread-crumbs. Eepeat these layers 
until the dish is full — apples for the top. Butter and sugar to suit 
the taste. Lastly, ^ cupful of hot water; cover closely and bake 
one hour. 

This is good either hot or cold. Both bread and apples become 
somewhat jellied when the pudding is done. Can be served with- 
out sauce. 

Peach Pandowdy w — ^Pill a 2-quart basin J full of canned 
peaches or fresh fruit sliced, pour over them a batter made like that 
for Apple Jonathan, with the addition of 1 tablespoonful of short- 
ening. Pour over the peaches. SerVe with pudding-sauce after 
baking until the crust is done. 

Dried peaches may be stewed and served in the same manner. 
Serve with cream and sugar. 

Steamed Frnit Pnfi^.— 
1 pint flour. 2 teaspoonf uls baking powder. 

Sweet milk to make a batter that will drop from the spoon. 5 
cups buttered ; put in each 1 spoonful of batter, then some fresh 
fruit, preserves or jam; then more dough, leaving room to rise. 
Steam twenty-five minutes. Serve with sweetened cream or sauce, 





CAKE maKng is an easier and simpler matter [when^ every- 
thing is prepared before hand. Cream-tartar or baking 
powder should be measured and sifted with the exact quan- 
tity of flour ; butter and spices measured. Eaisins seeded, citron 
sliced fine, etc. It is a very good plan to pick over raisins by the 
. pound, when first brought into the house, while a large quantity 
of Zante currants can be washed and dried almost as easily as the 

1 cupful required. This method saves a vast amount of time. 

Cbbam-taetab and soda should always be rubbed smooth with 
a clean, dry knife, before measuring ^put the required quantity. 
Some notable housekeepers measure and sift a quantity of flour, 
cream-tartar and soda, or baking powder together and put aside in 
a jar or tin for use. This is a great convenience, but stUl better is 
the 

Self-kising ob Pbepaked Floue. This can be purchased at all 
large groceries in quantities to suit purchasers. This is not only 
convenient, but a saving, as regards baking-powder, etc. It will 
not answer where sour mUk or yeast is to be used. 

Sweet Milk and baking-powder, or cream-tartar, go together; 
sour milk and soda. 

Measdbing. — To 1 quart of flour use 1 teaspoonf ul of soda and 

2 teaspoonf uls of cream-tartar; or to 1 quart of flour 2^ teaspoon - 
fuls of baking-powder. 

One cup of flour means a level cupful of unsifted flour. 

A Testeb should generally be baked before the-cake is put in 
the oven. A teaspoonful or so of the battel put in a patty-pan or 
on a greased paper. If too solid add a few teaspoonf uls of milk, 
if too soft it will fall in the middle. Add a tablespoonful or a little 
over of flour.

CAKE. 235' 

Cake to be good must be made of nice materials. Butter and 
eggs should be fresh, Cooking butter should never be used. 
Sometimes, however, perfectly fresh eggs that will not make frost, 
ing, will beat up nicely in a cake batter. 

Bbeak the eggs in a dish separately that by mistake a poor 
one may not spoil the whole lot. 

Yolks of eggs, when not used in the cake, may be utilized in 
various ways. 

Eggs for frosting should be dropped in cold water one hour 
before using. A pinch of salt added to them hastens their frothing. 

Eggs are beaten separately for almost all cakes, i. «., yolks and 
whites are beaten in separate dishes. This is always an improve- 
ment, and should be done unless the recipe directs otherwise. Two 
exceptions there are to this rule, custards and gingerbread, 

SuGAB is to be used as follows. Powdered or pulverized sugar 
for Delicate Cake, Angel's Pood, White Sponge Cake, etc. Coffee 
sugar for layer cakes (except the most delicate which require 
powdered), White Fruit Cakfe, Pound Cake and other rich cakes. 
Coffee Cake, Fruit Cake, and other dark cakes require brown sugar. 
Granulated should never be used if it is possible to avoid it, as it 
does not dissolve well, and either goes to the bottom or rises to the 
top. 

A CAKE-PAN with a tube bakes a large loaf more uniformly. 

Labd is better to grease cake pans, for the salt in butter, causes 
the cake to stick. After rubbing the pans with lard, sprinkle with 
flour, shaking off the surplus. 

Cake tins should be warmed gently before putting in the batter. 

Cake matebials should be gotten together in cold weather 
some time before they are needed, and kept in a warm place that 
they may mix more easily. 

Eggs should be beaten in an earthen dish. 

Bdttek and sugar should always be creamed in an earthen or 
stone dish with a silver or wooden spoon. Tin or iron prevents 
their perfect whiteness. 

Cake batteb should be beaten with a wooden spoon. A very 
large quantity is better beaten with the hand, especially in the 
winter. 



236 THREE MEALS A DAV. 

Cake should be tried with a clean broom splint; if nothing 
adheres the cake is done. 

Butter that is too salt should be washed in cold water, 2 or 8 
times before using it in nice cake. 

Oven dooes must be kept closed ten or fifteen minutes after a 
cake is put in to bake. Open then very carefully just a er&ek.. 
When necessary to turn exercise great care that the cake may not 
fall. 

Shake and jar a tin with the cake batter in before putting in 
the oven. This expels the air bubbles, and renders it less liable 
to fall. 

Wine, where given in any recipe, (it is not so given in this 
volume,) may have a wine glass of rose-water, the juice of a lemon, 
an extra yolk of an egg, or a few more spices substituted. 

Cake tins are very nice lined with thoroughly greased paper, 
white or light manilla ; butter the tin itself before putting in the 
paper. For a large fruit cake, 2 or 8 may be used, buttering each 
one, and the last one very thoroughly. This is very useful to pre- 
vent the cake burning as well as sticking. 

A half-pint cup should be used in all these measurement?. 
Occasionally some brands of flour require more than others. 

Test the heat by putting in the oven a little flour; if it browns 
too quickly let the oven cool slightly. 

Always start up the fire when commencing to make the cake 
that it may not have to stand when in the tin; if obliged to wait, 
leave the batter in the dish and beat constantly; beat not stir; 
beating drives out the air bubbles. 

A tidy table saves much work. Put everything back in its 
place as soon as used. Use the same dish as often as possible for 
all materials that will not injure color or flavor. For instance, 
the same cup that measures the sugar and flour may be used for the 
butter and then the milk if care is taken. Some cooks measure 
all their dry materials and put them into little paper sacks. This 
saves many steps and much washing of dishes. 

Nutmegs, if good, when pricked with a pin will show oU in- 
stantly. 



CAKE. 237 

FRUITS FOR GAKRS. 

Eaisins should be stemmed. For stoning easily, poitr boil- 
ing water over the raisins and drain off. This loosens them and 
the seeds come out with ease. If water is used dry them thor- 
oughly before using. Currants should be thoroughly washed in 
several waters, or until the water is clear, and rubbed dry on a 
coarse clean towel. 

Eaisins fok Cake may be boiled one-half hour in a little 
water, dried in the oven, dredged with flour, and stirred in as 
usual. This wUl prevent their being tough and tearing the cake 
in cutting. 

AiiMONDs, TO Blanoh. — Turn boiling water over them. Let 
remain a few minutes, then drain and plunge into cold water. 
The skins will then come off easily. If not, repeat the operation. 
Eub the skins off with a dry cloth. Put on a paper in an open 
ovea to dry. Eub to a paste in a mortar with a little rose-water to 
prevent oiling ; a little loaf sugar, 1 lump to 3 or 4 almonds may 
be used for the same purpose. 

Another way is to roll the almonds, first choppiug them fine 
with a rolling-pin, sprinkling sugar with them to avoid oiling. 

Cake Mixing and Baking. — Beat butter and sugar to a froth, 
unless the recipe otherwise directs ; to this add the well-beaten 
yolks of the eggs, if yolks are used. Beat the whites until they 
will adhere to the dish turned bottom up, and add flour, whites of 
■ eggs and milk (if the recipe calls for it) alternately. Sift the flour 
and baking-powder or cream-tartar and soda with the flour first. 
Stir until smooth, in the same direction always. Have the oven 
hot, not burning, and put the ca,ke in. , Eead all the other hints 
given in this division also. Close doors and windows that cause a 
draft upon the stove. 

If the cake is very rich it will need a more moderate oven, 
especially if it is a molasses cake, as any cake with molasses in it 
browns speedily. At the first sign of browning too quickly, put a 
brown paper over the top. This will be better if pinned in shape 
to fit the tin, as there is no danger of it touching the cake if made 
into this cap form. If baking too fast set a pan of water on the 



238 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

grate or remove one of the back stove lids for a few minutes. If 
in danger of burning on the under side, set the upper grate under 
the tin to raise it from the bottom of the oven. 

Let the loaf of cake stand in the pan a few minutes after re- 
moving from the oven. Do not put cakes away in the cake-box 
until thoroughly cold. A stone jar is very nice for keeping cak« 
or cookies. 

PoBTABLE Lemonade.^ — Lemons that will not keep may hav« 
,the juice expressed and thickened with sugar. Set in a cool place 
and it will keep a long time. Use for lemon pies, lemonade or 
mixed with eggs for lemon jelly cake. Use the peel for Dry 
Flavoring. 

Lemons may be kept fresh a long time by putting in a jar of 
cold water. Change it frequently. 

FIaAVORIKQ rxtragt.

Vaiolla Extbact. — ^ pint of alcohol, 8 vanilXa beans broken 
in bits. Let stai;d a few days. 

Lemon Extract. — 1 pint of alcohol, grated yellow rind of 6 
lemons. In a few days, if necessary, add ^ ounce of oil of lemon. 

Orange Extract. — Prepare same as above, substituting oranges 
and oil of orange for lemon. These extracts are better and one- 
half cheaper than those that can be bought. 

Dry Flavoring. — Grate off the yellow rind of oranges and 
lemons (separately of course) that are to be used for sherbets, 
lemonades, etc. Mix the gratings well with four times their weight 
in powdered sugar, and put into closely corked bottles. This will 
give two excellent, pure, ever-ready flavorings for cakes, pies, pud- 
dings, blanc manges, etc. 

Peach pits or meats may be blanched, and fifteen or more of 
them nibbed to a paste and stirred into a loaf of cake in place of 
almond extract.

240 THREE MEALS A UAY. 

FROSTING. 

Cakk should be nearly if not quite cold before attempting ie 
frost it. 

In FEosTiNe dip the knife frequently in cold water. 

Very thick frosting may be made to adhere to a cake by 
taking 1 teaspoonful of gelatine dissolved in as little boiling water 
as possible and while hot rubbing all over the top of the cake. 
Then apply the frosting. If this precaution is not taken the sugar 
when dry is inclined to crumble off a large cake where a very thick 
frosting has been used. 

One teaspoonfci, of lemon juice will do much toward prevent- 
ing frosting from crumbling. Vinegar is a partial substitute. One 
teaspoonful of cream has a softening effect. 

A RIM of stiff paper around a cake will retain the frosting in 
place until it hardens. 

Decorative Frosting. — Give the cake a plain coating of stiff 
frosting. Smooth over the top and set the cake in a warm oven 
for a few minutes. Ueat the white of an egg to a firm froth. 
Stir in powdered sugar until quite stiff, but not so stiff as the first 
frosting. Make three small cornucopias of writing paper, pin in 
shape, cut off the small ends of each to leave room to press the 
frosting through. Graduate the sizes of the three apertures. Fill 
the cornucopias with frosting, fold the paper over the top and use 
the thumbs to press the frosting through the lower opening. If it 
does not keep its shape, the frosting is not stiff baough and more 
sugar musi, be added. Gut out the designs in paper and outhne 
them on the top of the cake by pricking the frosting with a large 
needle. Use the cornucopia with the largest opening for the large 
pattern. A horseshoe in the center with a vine of flowers, out- 
side of this a wreath of plain flowers, daisies for instance. Finish 
the edge with two or three rows of heavy dots. 

Cochineal Coloring. — 

1 dram of cream-tartar. 1 dram of salraratas. 

1 dram of alum. 1 dram of cochineal. 

Mix in f cup of boiling water. Bottle and cork for use. 
Make the wished for shade by using more or less of the preparfr-

tion. A portion of the cake batter may be colored to suit and 
arranged in alternate layers. lOhe effect is very pretty. Bed sugar 
sand may be bought at groceries and used for coloring cake batter. 
Quick Icing (White).— 

6 tablespoonfuls powdered 1 white of egg. 
sugar. Flavor with rose, vanilla or 

lemon. 
Mix the sugar and white of egg together in a bowl by merely 
stirring. Spread this semi-transparent mixture over the cake. A 
rim of paper put around the sides of the loaf will retain the frost- 
ing in place imtil it hardens. Leave in a warm place for an hour 
or two to dry. The frosting may be colored pink by a drop or so 
of prepared cochineal color.. Icing is more tender made in this 
way than where the egg is beaten to a froth before adding the 
sugar. 

Qnick Icing (Yellow). — Same as above, taking the yolks of 2 
eggs in place of the white to moisten the above amount of sugar. 
The three shades, white, pink, yellow, may be alternated to great 
advantage in frosting a layer cake. 
Frosting (White).— 
2 whites of eggs beaten | pound of powdered sugar, 
stiff. 
Beat together until it will fall in ffakes from the knife. Dust 
the cake with flour to absorb any grease, and brush off lightly. 
Flavor the frosting to please the taste,. 
Frosting (H).— 
Whites of two eggs beaten Stir in 18 tablespoonfuls pow- 

stiff. dered sugar. 

1 teaspoonfnl powdered 2 teaspoonfuls lemon juice or 
starchor2teaspoonfiils orange water, 

cornstarch. 
If a heavy frosting is required, let each coating dry in a warm 
oven before applying the next one. 

Frosting (Yellow).— Yolks of 2 eggs beaten with 1 cup of 
sugar. Flavor to suit. 

Boiled Frosting. — 1 cupful of white sugar boiled with ^ cup 
of water until it 'Will yna. when dropped into cold water. Pc^kx

this over the -well-heaten white of 1 egg. Stir briskly until it is 
cool enough to thicken. After the top of the cake has been cov- 
ered, stir^in a little fine dry sugar befoifelj^p^pting the sides. The 
cake should be cold. Put in the oven a morbent to dry. 

Gelatine Frosting, Eggless.— Dissolve 1 teaspoonful of gel- 
atine in 6 teaspoonfuls of boiling water. Strain and stir in 1 cup 
of sugar (powdered). Flavor to suit enough for 1 cake, , 

Eggless Frosting, Quick. — 1 cup of powdered or confection- 
ers' sugar moistened with as little cold water as can be used to 
make a smooth paste of the right consistency for spreading. 

Eggless Frosting, Boiled. — l cup of powdered sugar boiled 
in 3^ teaspoonfuls of milk for five minutes. Flavor, remove from 
fire and stir until it thickens. Spread oil the cake before it hard- 
ens.

of powdered sugar, i tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate, or enough 
to suit the taste, 1 teaspoonful of vanilla. 

Boiled Chocolate Frosting. — ^ cake of chocolate, grated.

cup of sweet milk for ten minutes. After it begins to boil, add 
the chQColate, stirring until mixed. Use hot. 

'chocolate Cream Frosting. — l cup granulated sugar boiled 
in 1 cup ot water until it threads. Let cool slightly and beat un> 
til creamy, put over the cake, then cover with a thin layer of dis- 
solved chocolate melted over boiling water, or stir chocolate in. 

Almond Icing. — 2 cups of granulated sugar boiled with 4 
tablespoonfuls of water for five minutes, then pour it over 3 whites 
of eggs beaten to a froth. Beat the whole until cold, and add to 
it ^ pound of almonds, blanched and pounded to a paste with rose 
water. Nice for Sponge, Delicate or White Gake-- 

Tntti-Frutti Frosting. — Prepare in the same manner as 
Almond Icing, adding instead of the pounded almonds ^ pound of 
almonds chopped, ^ cup of large wjiite raisins and somewhat less 
citron sliced thin. Particularly nice for Sponge, Delicate or White 
Cake. Delicious used as filling for some nice layer cake.

new, unbuttered tin three-fourths of an hour. When done, open 
the oven-door and let it cool off gradually. After a few minutes, 
if the pan has a tube, turn it upside down upon it, if not, rest it 
upside down upon two bricks or other supports. When entirely 
cold, loosen from the sides of the tin with a sharp knife. Do not 
allow it to be jarred or shaken in the oven, nor open the door for 
the first fifteen minutes, as much of the success of this delicious 
sweet depends upon the baking. Half-moon shaped tins 4 inches

tin buttered. Fill and bake immediately in a well heated oven. 
The batter will seem very thin, but the cake is excellent. By the 
use of 1 more egg any layer cake may be made better than with 
butter. For this save 2 of the whites out for frosting, using the 
other egg and the 2 yolks for the cake. Bake in layer cake tins. 
Whip the whites stiff and stir in sugar. Spread between each 
layer and over the top. 

For cocoanut cake sprinkle coooanut over the frosting between 
the layers and thickly over the top layer. For chocolate, grate ^

PRIRD GAKB.S. 

Fat for fried cakes, doughnuts, crullers, etc., should be kept 
at just the right temperature otherwise the cakes will soak fat. 

A PIECE OF DOUGH should bo dropped in to test it. If this 
rises to the top quickly and browns shortly it will be safe to put in 
the cakes. 

A MIXTURE of two-thirds lard and one-third beef suet is more 
wholesome, less expensive and less likely that the cakes will absorb 
too much fat; even a larger proportion of the suet may be used, 
half and half working nicely. All beef suet, however, will make 
the outside of the cakes rough and injure the flavor. 

Pried cakes shortened with butter are less likely to absorb fat 
than those shortened with lard. 

Beef suet should be bought in the leaf and carefully fried 
out before using. 

After usino the fat for boiling doughnuts set away to coOl; 
remove from the sediment. If very much scorched and brown 
clarify with a few slices of raw potatoes boiled in the lard. 

Care must be taken to keep the lard hot, but it must not 
bum, as it would spoil the cakes. Fry in a small iron pot, five 
or six at a time; turn with a fork; take out with a skimmer and 
lay on a colander to drain; when sufficiently cool place in a stone 
pot. 

Raised Donghnuts or Nnt Cakes. — Heat 1 pint of milk 
(sweet) or water, lukewarm; stir into it a cupful of melted lard, 
then flour until it is a thick batter and add one-half cake yeast. 
Set in a warm place to rise over night. In the morning work in 2 
cupfuls of sugar, 2 eggs beaten to a frqth (these may be omitted), 
2 teaspoonfuls of cinnamon or a grated nutmeg and 1 of salt. 
Knead in flour sufficient to roll out. Keep in a warm place until 
risen again. Roll out and cut in small cakes, strips and twists, 
or in diamonds. Let rise fifteen or twenty minutes before frying. 
If wished very nice dip in powdered white sugar as soon as fried.

GINQB.R QAKB.S. 

■ The grated yellow rind and juice of an orange add much to 
the flavor of ginger cake. 

New Orleans molasses is the best to use. Bear in mind that 
good cake cannot be made with poor molasses. Syrup should not 
be used. 

The OVEN should be kept at a moderately steady heat, as mo- 
lasses causes a cake to brown quickly. 

YoLKS OF EGGS, where the whites have been used for other 
purposes, can be utilized in gingerbread; 2 yolks will equal 1 whole 
egg. Even where the rule does not call for eggs the addition of 1,

^.V^UDDINGS may be either steamed, boiled or baked. 

kJ Steaming or boiling will take twice as long as baking. 
a ^ » The best cloth to tie up a boiled pudding, is a piece of 

unbleached shirting. 

Pudding-molds or basins shoulfl be well rubbed over in the 
inside with butter. 

Bbead puddings should be tied very loosely to allow them to 
expand. 

Puddings boiled in a cloth should be moved occasionallj to 
prevent adhering to the kettle. 

An inverted plate or saucer should be placed in the bottom 
of the kettle to prevent adhering or burning. 

Puddings boiled in a cloth should be kept covered with con- 
stantly boiling water; boiled in a mold, the water should not 
quite reach the top of the mold. 

Always keep boiling water at band to replenish the kettle if 
needed. 

Floub should be spread on the inside of each tying-place to 
prevent water getting in. 

Puddings boiled in a basin should have a cloth wrung out 
of hot water and dredged with flour, tied closely over the top of 
the basin. 

Puddings boiled in a cloth, basin or mold, when done, should 
be phinged suddenly into cold water and turned out instantly; this, 
will prevent sticking ; and dumplings, i. e., boiled or steamed 
should be served at once. If this is an impossibility cover with 
the cloth in which they were boiled and serve as quickly as possible, 

Ba£ed puddings should not have the fruit put in until &e 
10 mm.

to the bottom of the dish. 

Sauoes mentioned in the following recipes ifSl all be found 
in this department. 

Puddings boiled in a mold or a pudding-dish do not need as 
stifi a batter as those boiled in a cloth. 

SmvEH-PLATED PUDDING DISHES vnil be found a great advantage 
as well as a pleasing addition to the table. They come in various 
sizes and are supplied with a fire-proof porcelain inside dish, in 
which the pudding is baked. With two or three of these inside 
dishes a green corn pudding or a scallop may appear in one of the 
earlier course in the silver dish, to be exchanged at dessert for the 
pudding itself baked in another of the china inside dishes, and 
placed as before in the silver dish. Pie-plates come in the samo 
material, and can have any ordinary tin pie-plate fitted into 
them. 

Old English Plum Pudding. — To make what is called *

1 pound sugar. 1 pound flour. 

1 quart of milk. 6 eggs, well-beaten. 

1 blade of mace. J nutmeg, grated. 

1 quart of milk. 1 pound blanched almonds. 

Citron, shredded, and candied orange and lemon peel may be 
added to enrich it, but are not absolutely necessary. Sultana 
raisins may also be added, but the rule given above without these 
extra ingredients will be found very nice. A wineglassful of rose- 
water will be found an addition. 

Beat the eggs, mix with the milk and add after the other arti- 
cles are mixed together. 

If the milk should be found hardly enough to moisten ths 
padding sufficiently, add a very little more. 

Put in a cloth, l^ing finnly and allowing room for the pudding

*;o swell. Boil eight to ten hours, never allowing the water to 
i;ease boiling.

over the tops. There is not so much loss of sweetness in this case. 

Serve hot with Vanilla Sauce or Hard Sauce^, May be kept'

Iiady Sutherland Farina Pudding.— 1 teaspoonful Sea Moss 
Farina, stirred in 1 quart of milk. Dissolve it first in a little cold 
milk or water. Salt slightly. Set it in a pan over a kettle of boil- 
ing water. Stir -with a wooden spoon. When it boils, add 2 egg 
yolks beaten with 1 cupful sugar (powdered), and last ] teaspoonful 
of vanilla extract. Beat the 2 whites of eggs stiff. Spread upon 
the pudding and brown in the oven three to five minutes. 

Hasty Desserts. — The recipes given below will be found 
useful when unexpected guests find the busy housewife unprepared. 
The short time in which dishes may be cooked are their chief 
recommendation. To these may be added Flummery, Graham 
Muah with sauce, Cake with sauce. Minute Pudding, Quick Cracker 
Pudding, or a Plain Corn-starch Pudding, served hot with cream 
and sugar or marmalade. 

French Pancakes. — This is a very dainty dish. Beat 3 eggs 
with a saltspoonful of salt and a dessertspoonful of sugar until 
very light. Add a saltspoonful of soda dissolved in a teaspoonful "" 
of vinegar, and a coffee cupful of rich milk. Stir in flour to make a 
thin batter. Put a little fat on a hot griddle, and turn on batter 
enough to spread the size of a common teaplate. Brown on both 
sides. Lay on a hot plate. Spread with a jam marmalade, and 
roll up like jelly cake. Sift on powdered sugar, and a dash of 
nutmeg or cinnamon; it is necessary the batter should be very 
smooth and free from lumps. 

Jelly Cake Fritters. — Cut stale slices of sponge cake in 
squares or diamonds. .Fry brown in butter. Dip hastily in boil- 
ing milk. Lay on a hot dish and put a spoonful of strawberry 
jam or peach marmalade on each piece. Any other plain cake may 
be used, but a rich cake will not do. 1 

Queen's Toast. — Cheap and tasteful. Cut half inch slices of 
stale baker's, or very light domestic bread into squares, removing 
the crust. Dip in a batter made of 3 beaten eggs and a pint of 
milk. Fry to a light brown in a little butter and serve with sweet 
sauce. 

What Is Its.— 

1 pint buttermilk. 1 teaspoonful soda, 

2 well-beaten eggs. A pinch of salt. 



SI4 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Flour sufficient to make a thin batter that will spread on the 
^ddle. Bake the cakes the size of a breakfast plate. 

Sauce. — 1 quart of sweet milk, let boil up. Dissolve 1 table- 
spoonful of corn-starch in a little cold milk or water. Add a pinch 
of salt; a lump of butter the size of a small egg. Stir into the 
boiling milk. Sweeten to taste and flavor with lemon extract. 

Have this sauce ready, and as the cakes are baked place them 
in a deep dish, turning sauce over each cake as they are taken from 
the griddle, placing one over the other Cut in triangular pieces 
to nerve. 

No Matters. — To 3 cupfuls of buttermilk add 3 tablespoon- 
fuls of rich cream and a small quantity of sugar. Stir in flour 
until it is the consistency of paste for doughnuts. EoU out the 
size of a breakfast plate and fry one at a time. As each cake 
comes from the fire, cover it with apple sauce made from tart 
appl«8, sweetened to taste, and spiced with nutmeg or cinnamon, 
and >M)ntinue the process until sufficient. 

PUDDING SAUGRS. 

Wn»B is given in none of these recipes. Wherever wine is 
found sn a rule for sauc* juice of a lemon may be substituted in 
some o'tses ; in others, j, glass of rose-water or an extra yolk of an 

egg. 

Cfeaming butter and sugar for sauces should always be done 
in an earthen dish with a wooden or sUver spoon. Tin or iron 
discolors. 

Sw^ET Oream used as a pudding sauce is one of the mos^ 
wholesome, as well as most convenient dressings, suitable to almost 
every pudding, nourishing and agreeable to the invalid as well as 
the ep'cure. It cannot occupy too large a place in the culinary 
department. It may be served plain, or white sugar may be sent 
round with it. Flavoring is .sometimes used. 

Pdue Ceeam, also sweetened and flavored to taste, is used with 
lome puddings. Whipped cream, also.

nutmeg thickly upon the top. Keep cool. The yolk of an egg is a 
very nice addition beaten up with the sauce. 

Hard Silver Sauce. — ^ cupful butter creamed with 1 cupful 
of powdered sugar. Beat part of the juice of a lemon with the 
sauce or flavor with lemon extract. The stiffly-beaten white of an 
egg stirred in thoroughly with this is an improvement. The whole 
egg may be used if^not too particular as to the whiteness of the 
sauce. Keep cool. 

Golden Sauce, (Liqihd;.— 
J cupful of butter creamed with 

1 cupful of brown sugar. 2 yolks of eggs well-beaten.

Date Sauce. — Stew dates gently in just water enough to cover 
until they are soft enough to rub through a colander. Beat them 
until light; add water, if necessary, to thin them and let boil up 
once. Fruit juice bottled and saved from canning should be used 
for thinning instead of water, the juice of currants especially ap- 
petizing. This sauce is very nice with bread puddings.

BIOH "pound for pound" preserves and jam can be put away 
without sealing; simply tie up with 2 or 3 taioknesses 
of paper over which put a cloth. Look at them occasionally 
and if signs of working appear, heating up thoroughly will sweeten 
them again. Eemove carefully any mold that may show itself. 

To PREVENT preserves and jams from sugaring add a teaspoon- 
ful of cream-tartar to every gallon of fruit before it is quite cooked. 
A very little tartaric acid will answer the same purpose. 

Use small jars for preserves. 

Pk35Sesves that are candied may be liquified by setting the jar 
in a kettle of cold water: Let the water boil continuously for an 
hoxa: or more. 

Preseeves. — The "pound for pound" custom of preserving fruit 
has been growing less for many years, though many still prefer the 
preserved to canned fruit. Rules for both methods of preparing 
fruit will be found in the following pages. 

Bebbies, peaches, etc., may be packed in a jar in layers, with 
part of the sugar sprinkled between. Do this over night. It will 
be found to harden the fruit so that it will keep its form better 
■when cooked, and will also permeate it more thoroughly with the 
sugar. Add the remainder of the sugar in the morning and proceed 
as usual. 

Use porcelain, granite, iron kettles, or stone jars for preserving. 

Fbuits that require paring should be dropped into cold water 
as soon as peeled to prevent blackening. 

Bom preserves gently. 

Clarifying Sugar. — Clarify when brown sugar is used. With 
very nice white sugar this process is hardly necessary. Put the 
sugar i" *Hc preserving kettle, in the proportion of 1 cupful of water 

(sae> 



to 1 pound of sugar. To 5 potmds of sugar allow the beaten white 
of 1 egg added while the ingredients are cold. Set over a slow fire 
to di£ii>lve,, stir well and let boil up once or twice. Take from the 
fire a minute, skim, return to the fire and let boil ten or fifteen 
minutes, removing and skimming each time, Then pour off the 
clear syrup, wash the kettle, pour back the syrup and put the fruit 
in to cook. This should not be too much crowded, and if there is 
not syrup enough, to cover the fruit, remove, add more water to the 
syrup and boil a few minutes before returning the fruit. 

Paee fruit for preserving or canning with a silver knife that 
it may not blacken. 

Sometimes when preserves are but slightly fermented simply 
pojiring off the syrup, scalding it thoroughly and turning back 
over the fruit, will be sufficient. Sometimes the jar may be set in 
a moderate oven and kept there until thoroughly scalded, or in a 
kettle of cold water that is allowed to boil briskly for an hour.. 

Always use perfectly pure jars. 

Peach Preserve^.— Pare and halve the peaohes, removing the 
pits, or take the pits out and leave the 'peach as whole as possible. 
Allow for each pound of fruit 1 pound of white sugar. Dissolve 
the sugar in just enough cold water to saturate it, using J cupful 
to the pound. Stir well; let boil ten minutes and skim, Blanch 
5 peach-pits or kernels for each pound of the fruit, put in the 
syrup and let remain. They are veiy ornamental to the preserves, 
besides giving a delicate flavor. Put in the peaches and cook until 
clear; about twenty minutes will answer. Bemove froin the kettle 
ftnd set away in a cool place, cover closely, let stand two or three 
days, then turn the syrup off and boil until it thickens slightly; 
turn it boiling over the peaches.' Put up in jars as directed for 
preserves at beginning of this chapter, or, if desired, they may be 
canned and sealed up. In canning, pack the peaches in the jar 
and pour the syrup over them. 

Peach Preserves (II). — !S pounds of the best free-stone 
peaches and 3 pounds of sugar. Pare, stone and quarter the fruit, 
strew the sugar amongst it, cover and set away over night. Put 
into a preserving kettle in the monang and boil very slowly an 
hour or more. Seal hot. , 



322 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Pear Preserves. — ^Pare the fniit,divide, and remove tli6 tjores 
adding to each pound of pears J pound of sugar, making a syrujr 
as for Peach Preserves (see first recipe). If brown sugar is used, 
clarify, add the pears a few at a time, and boil until clear, skim 
out and put in the remainder, cook in the f-ame way. Then remov^;} 
the fruit and boil the syrup down one-third; pack the fruit in cans 
and pour (he syrup over it boiling hot. Seal immediately. These 
preserves may be put in jars and simply tied down when cold. 

Pear Preserves, (II). — Pare, core and quarter the fruit ami 
tor each pound of pears take J pound of sugar. Save the perfet* 
cores and skins and boil these in sufiB.cient water to cover. Strain 
this and put the sugar in, let boil and add the prepared fruit; stew 
gently until the syrup becomes colored finely. Can and seal im- 
mediately. Any syrup remaining over bottle for pudding sauce. 

Preserved Quinces. — Choose fine yellow quinces; pare, quar- 
ter and core them, or cut in circular slices an inch thick; pare and 
dig the core from each so as to leave the. slice ring-shaped. Save 
all the perfect cores and skins. Put the quinces over the fire with 
just water enough to cover them and simmer until they are soft 
enough to pierce with a yellow straw. Take out carefully with a 
skimmer and spread upon broad dishes to cool. Add the cores and 
parings to the water in which the quinces were boiled, and stew, 
closely covered, for an hour. Strain through a jelly-bag, and to 
every pint of the liquid or to every pound of the fruit, add 1 poimd 
of sugar before it heats; stir in the beaten white of an egg to 
clarify it; let boil up two or three times and skim each time. Put 
the fruit in the syrup and let boil until a rich red color. Eemove 
the fruit and boil syrup down until it begins to jelly on the sides. 
Pack the quinces in jars and pour the syru.^ over them. 

Quiuce Preserves, (Plain). — Pare, halve anS core; boi) the 
parings and the perfect cores until soft m new cidei. ** train the 
sider, and for every pound of fruit allow ^ pound of brown supar; 
clarify with the beaten white of an egg and then put in the quince- 
There should be more than cider enough to cover them, as it waste 
a great deal in boiling. Shred the rind of an oranate and «d4 *^ 
She flavor. This preserve is nice for common use. 

ipple and Qiiilnce Preserves,— ^are, core and ^uartei c 



PRESERVES. 323 

peck each of quinces and sweet apples. Steam until tender; make 
a syrup according to some of the previous rules ; I pound of sugar 
and|- cup of cold water to a pound of fruit; boil and skim. Put the 
fruit in the syrup, 'joil until a beautiful red; slice in a lemon or 
two just before taking up. This is very nice. Quinces alone may 
be prepared in the same way. 

Apple Pi"eserves. — Apples for prosorving should be tart 
and mellow. Pare, divide and core. Allow J pound of sugar to 
1 pound of fruit; clarify the syrup and add the apples. If there- 
is not syrup enough to cover the fruit, add a little water. Boil 
until the apples are transparent. Take up, and boil the syrup 
until it thickens. flavor with bruised ginger-root, tied in a cloth 
and boiled in the syrup, or add a lemon sliced in thin slices just 
before canning. Pack the fruit in jars and pour the boiling syrup 
in until full. Seal at once. 

Citron PreseiTes. — Pare the citron and cut in slices 1^ 
inches thick, then into strips the same thickness, leaving them the 
full length of the fruit. Take out the seeds with a sharp knifo. 
Weigh and use white sugar, pound for pound; make a syrup, add- 
ing 1 pint of water to 10 pounds of sugar. Simmer gently twenty 
minutes, skim and put in the citron; boil one hour or until trans- 
parent. Before taking from the fire put in 2 lemons, sliced thin, to 
10 pounds of fruit, and 2 ounces of root ginger. Only boil a few 
minutes after the flavoring is added. Do not stir them while 
cooking. If the syrup is not thick enough skim out the fruit and 
boil longer, pouring it over the citron when done. 

Crab-apple Preserves. — Core the crab-apples with a shai-p 
penknife through the blossom end, leaving the stems on. Take 1 
pound of white sugar for each pound of prepared fruit and 1 cup- 
ful of water to the pound. Put over a moderate fire, let dissolve 
and boil; skim and drop the apples in. Let them boil gently 
until clear and the skins begin to break. Skim out; boil the 
syrup until thick; put the fruit in jars and pour the syrup over. 
Slices of lemon boiled with the fruit may be considered an improve- 
ment; i lemon is enough for several pounds of fruit. 

Tomato Preserves. — Take fresh tom8.toes, pare and cut in 
quarters, squeeze to free from juice and seeds. Let them drain. 



324 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Make a syrup pound for pound ■with' ^ cupful of water to eaca 
pound. Boil and skim; drop in the tomatoes and boil them until 
done. Attd ^ ounce ginger-root ten or fifteen minutes before 
taking up, and slice in 2 or 3 lemons to 8 or 10 pounds of fruit 
just before removing from the fire. Put in jars and tie up. A 
pound of raisins may be added to this amount of tomatoes if 
wished; put in fifteen minutes before removing from fire. 

Plum Tomato Preserves, — Take yellow plum tomatoes, scald 
until the skins come off easily. Take | pound sugar to 1 pound 
fruit. Cook until tender, flavor as above with lemons and add one- 
third as masaj raisins as tomatoes ten minutes before taking off 
the stove. Very nice without raisins. Seal up hot. 

Green Tomato Preserves. — Take small green tomatoes; put 
them in a clarified syrup made of white sugar, equal in weight 
to the tomatoes, and cold water more than enough to cover the 
quantity of fruit. Slice in 1 lemon to every 2 pounds of tomatoes. 
Boil them gently three hours, afterward put up in jars, tying securely. 

Green Tomato Preserves (II). — Take small green tomatoes, 
allow the juice and grated yellow rind of 2 lemons to every 3 
pqunds of the fruit. Pour over these cold water enough to cover 
the tomatoes. Tie an ounce of powdered ginger in a cloth for 10 
pounds of tomatoes, and throw in a few peach leaves. Boil gently 
three-fourths of an hour. Take up the tomatoes, strain the liquid 
and add to it 1 J pounds of white sugar for every pound of to- 
matoes. Eetum the tomatoes and boil until they appear saturated 
with the Syrup. In the course of a week turn the syrup from 
them, heat it to the scalding point and turn over the tomatoes. 
Tomatoes preserved in this manner appear like West Indian 
sweetmeats. 

Plnm Preserves. — Take fruit and sugar, pound for pound. 
Scald the plums to remove the skins, or if left unpeeled prick each 
one in several places that the juice may exude; let it stand. 
Drain and put the plums in the kettle with alternate layers of 
sugar. Pour the juice over this and let them boil five minutes, 
then remove the plums with a skimmer and boil the syrup until it 
thickens. Return the plums and boil ten minutes longer. Put in 
jars and tie up closely when cold. 



PRESERVES. 3,25 

Wild PlUM Preserves. — Scald the plums in saleratus water, 
1 teaspoonfnl to 2 gallons of plums. When the skins break 
slightly, pour off the water and turn the plums into a colander to 
drain. When cool remove the pits and weigh the fruit. Allow 
pound for pound of sugar. Clarify the sugar by boiling with a 
little water, skim and put in the fruit. When tender skim out and 
boil the syrup down and pour over the plunis. Tie up in small 
jars when cold. 

Preserved Grapes. — Take pound for pound of grapes and 
white sugar. Stem the grapes and put in a preserving kettle with 
Sugar in alternate layers. Cook over a slow fire, stirring con- 
stantly; as the seeds xi&e skim them off. Stew one hour, set aside 
to cool and then put in jars, tying up closely. Or the grapes may 
be pulped and put through a colander (see directions for canning 
grapes), then weigh and put pound for pound of sugar and boil as 
above. 

Preserved Watermelon Bind. — Peel and slice the melon; 
out in square pieces, leave a very little of the red on. Let stand 
overnight in very weak alum water; in the morning drain and 
steam in a steamer until a straw will pierce them easily. Let 
cool; make a syrup of IJ pounds of white sugar to 1 pound of 
fruit (pound for pound may be used if the preserves are not wished 
so nice), add enough water to keep from burning; skim. Use 
either 1 lemon to every 2 or 3 pounds of fruit (put in the lemon 
when the fruit is nearly done) or flavor with cinnamon bark, 
broken up and added while the preserve is boiling. Cook the rinds 
until plear and red. 

Mnshmelon Preserves. — Take perfectly green muskmelons, 
as late in the season as possible. If preserved while the weather 
is very hot they are apt to ferment. Scrape the outer skin off the 
rind. Cut them through the middle, Eemove the seeds, and cut 
the melon in any shape preferred. Soak them in salt and water 
over nighti then in clear water four or five hours, changing the 
water several times. Then soak in alum water an hour. Binse 
and put over to cook in water enough to cover, with a handful of 
peach leaves (if convenient) to 5 pounds of melon, and a table- 
spoonful of ginger tied up in a cloth. The peach leaves turn the

melon green, besides adding to its flavor. Bi 11 the melons until 
you can pierce them with a straw. Make a syiup of white sugar, 
pound for pound. Add enough water to keep from burning. Let 
boil and skim. Put in the fruit and the ginger, and boil it in thf 
syrup as long as can be done without breaking the rinds. If ther» 
is not enough synip to cover add a little water. When cold tie up 
in jars. In the course of a week pour off the syrup, scald and 
turn back over the fruit. Add sufficient essence of lemon to flavor 
it before turning back into the jars. A fresh lemon may be sliced 
into the jars when cold, 1 lemon to 2 or 3 pounds of the melon. 

Orange PreseiTCS. — Take any number of oranges with rather 
more than their weight in white sugar. Slightly grate the oranges 
and score them round and round with a knife, but not cut very 
deep. Put them in cold water for three days, chang^g the water 
several times each day. Tie them up in a cisth and boil them 
until soft enough for the head of a pin to psi^etrate the skin easily, 
and remove from the cloth. While they arc boUing,, place the 
sugar over the fire, with 1 cupful of water to each pound of sugar. 
Let boil two or three minutes and strain through muslin. Put the 
oranges into the syrup and boil gently until it jellies and is of a 
yellow color. Try the syrup by putting some to cool. It must not 
be too stiff. If the syrup does not cover the oranges turn them so 
that every part may be thoroughly done. 

Pine-apple Preserves. — Take perfectly ripe and fresh pine- 
apples, pare and cut in slices an inch thick. Take an equal weighu 
of white powdered sugar. Lay the sliced pineapple in a deep dish, 
alternating the slices with sugar sprinkled between them. Eeserve 
^ the sugar. Let the pine-apple stand until the next day, when the 
syrup may be turned from them and mixed with the remaining 
sugar, adding 1 large cupful of water for 3 or 4 pounds of pine- 
apple. Boil the syrup. Skim and take from the lire. When cool 
drop in the pine-apple and simmer gently until tender. Keep in 
glass or china jars covered tight and in a cool place. At the least 
sign of fermentation, turn the syrup off, scald, and turn back hot 
on the fruit. If the preserves are canned and sealed hot, there is, 
of course, no danger of fermentation.

add I their weight in sugar. Boil five minutes. Skim and seal up 
hot. Do not let them burn. Raspberries and currants mixed 
make a very nice preserve. 

Blackberry Preserves. — Make same as Raspberry. 

Strawberry Preserves. — Pound for pound. Einse the berries 
and put with the sugar in a preserving kettle over a slow fire until 
the sugar melts. Boil rapidly for twenty-five minutes. Take out 
the fruit with a perforated skimmer and fill a number of small 
cans I full. Boil the syrup five minutes longer. Skim. Fill up 
the jars and seal hot. Keep in a cool, dry place. 

Cherry Preserves. — Pit the fruit. Weigh, and to 8 pounds 
of cherries add? pounds of granulated sugar. Drain the cherries 
a little while. Pour off the juice and add to the sugar. Allow it 
to boil, and skim. Put in the fruit. Let cook slowly but steadily. 
When the fruit looks a little clear take out with a skimmer. Boil 
the syrup a few minutes longer, and turn over the fruit. Put in 
stone jars and tie securely when cool. 

Elderberry Preserves. — 
2 gallons of berries picked from the stem. 
5 pounds of sugar. 1 pint of strong vinegar. 

Stew down thick. They will keep without canning. Very 
healthful. 

CfflCUmber Preserves, (Delicious). — Gather young cucumbers, 
about four inches long. Lay in strong brine one week. Wash. 
Soak twenty-four hours in clear Water, changing this four times. 
•, Line a bell-metal kettle with grape-vine leaves. Lay in the 
cucumbers with a little aium soat|ered among them. Cover with 
vine leaves. Fill lbs kettle with clear water. Cover closely. Let 
them simmer. As scon as they are well greened take out the 
cucumbers and drop in ice water. When perfectly cold, wipe, and 
with a small knife slit down one side. Dig out the seeds. Stuff 
with a mixture of chopped raisins and citron. Sew up the slit 
with a fine thread and weigh them. Make a syrup, allowing 1 
pound of sugar to 1 pound of cucumber and 1 pint of water. Heat 
to boiling point. Skim. Drop in the fruit. Simmer half an lioiu\

cuciimbers again. Simmer five minutes and put in glass jars, 
tying up when cool. ^ 

Preserved Barberries.— Take the berries when fuUy ripe, 
let them remain on the stem. Make a rich syrup, allowing same 
weight of sugar as fruit, putting in J cupful of water to each 
pound of sugar, let boil up and skim. Drop in the barberries, 
letting the syrup coo! partially first. Boil until thoroughly pene- 
trated by the syrup. Tie up in glass jars. A very ornamental 
preserve. Preserved barberries mixed with cold water forms a 
refreshing drink in fevers. 

Currant PreseiTes. — Make same as Easpberry Preserves, 
using pound for pound of sugar and boiUng a little longer. Pre- 
served currants mixed with water are an excellent drink in fevers. 

Prune Preserves. — Pour boiling water on the prunes and 
set them where they will keep warm, together with a lemon cut in 
pieces. When swelled to the original size, put to each pound of 
the prunes J pound of brown sugar and 1 stick of cinnamon. If 
there is not enough water remaining to cover the prunes, add 
more, and stew in this syrup one-fourth of an hour. Squeeze in 
the juice of half a lemon to every 3 pounds of prunes. Do this 
just before removing from the fire. Pit the prunes. 

Cranberry Preserves. — Take poimd for pound of fruit and 
sugar. Put a little water in the bottom of the preserving kettle 
and boil until tender. 

Persimmon Preserves. — Select firm, ripe persimmons, and 
take the equivalent of their weight in sugar. Let the persimmons 
lie in cold water for twelve hours. Put them on the fire in enough 
water to cover them and stew gently untQ tender. Eemove, drain 
and spread them out to become cool and firm. Make a syrup by 
adding a cupful of cold water to every pound of sugar and boiling 
until clear, skimming constantly. When clear, put in the persim- 
mons and cook ten minutes. Take them out, spread again upon 
dishes and set these in the sun. Add the juice and peel of a 
couple of lemons to the syrup, boil it thick, return the persimmons 
to it, cook twenty minutes more, pour into glass jars. Seal when 
eold. 

Pumpkin Prf serves. — ^Divide, peel and remove the seeSs;

cut in small square pieces. For each poiind of the pumpkin to be 
preserved take 1 pound of pulverized or granulated sugar. Put 
the pumpkin in a deep dish with alternate layers of sugar sprinkled 
thickly over the top. Pour in lemon juice, | cupful to 1 pound of 
pumpkin. Let stand twenty-four ■ hours. Then boil the whole 
together with |- pint of water to every 3 pounds of pumpkin, 1 
tablespoonf ul of ginger tied in a cloth and the peel of the lemons 
shredded. When the pumpkin is tender, put in jars. In a tew 
days pour off the syrup, boil up and pour over the pumpkin hot. 
Very nice. Vinegar may be substituted for the lemon juice, in 
which case a lemon may be sliced in the preserves when cold. 

Sweet Potato Preserves. — Make syrup as for peaches. 
Parboil the potatoes, first cutting in round slices, and boil in the 
syrup until clear. 

BaspbeiTjT Jam. — | pound of sugar to a pound of berries. 
Einse the fruit and put in the preserving kettle, stir constantly 
until part of the juice is evaporated,. then add the sugar and simmer 
to a fine jam. This wiU be found better than putting the sugar in 
first, the seeds are not as hard in this case. A very good addition 
will be found in adding 1 pint of currant juice to every four pounds 
of raspberries. 

Blackberry Jam. — Make same as Easpberry Jam. Very 
healthful, especially for children. Brown sugar may be used. 

Strawberry Jam. — Make same as Easpberry Jam, using 
white sugar and omitting the currant juice. Seal up hot. Straw- 
berries are difficult to keep through the hot weather. 

Currant Jam, (White ob Eed). — Make same as Easpberry 
Jam. Use pulverized sugar, pound for pound for white currants. 
Weigh currants after they are picked from the stem. Seal hot, if 
preferred. Stir and mash frequently. 

Grape Jam. — ^Pulp the grapes, scald the pulps until they can 
be rubbed through a sieve to remove the seeds; return the skins 
and boU with J pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Boil down 
gently; put in tumblers or small jars. Seal. 

Bhabarb Jam.— Cut the rhubarb in pieces 1 inch long, take 
sugar pound for pound. Mix together and let stand all night. In • 
the morning pour off the syrup and boil until it begins to thicken. 



330 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Add the rhubarb and boil gently twenty-five minutes. Put up in 
tumblers like Currant Jelly. It will keep a year. 

[If marmalade is put in bowls or tumblers, it may be turned 
out in shape and used where jellies are appropriate.] 

Quince Marmalade. — ^Pate, core and slice the quinces, stew 
the sMns, and the perfect cores in water enough to cover them. 
V/hen tender, strain through a cloth. Add the quinces and sugar 
in the proportion of J pound to 1 potmd of fruit, to this liquid. 
Boil, stirring and mashing the fruit with a wooden spoon as it 
poftsns. The juice of 2 oranges to every 3 pounds of fruit imparts 
an agreeable flavor. When cool, put in small jars. 

Quince Cheese. — Boil quince marmalade very thick andpacJs 
ir. tumblers or small pots. It wiU turn out firm as cheese, and 
can be cut in slices for luncheon or tea. 

Pear and Qnince Marmalade. — 

2 dozen juicy pears. 10 fine quinces. 

Juice of 3 lemons. 

J pound of sugar to every pound of fruit after it is ready for 
cooking. Pare and core the fruit, dropping in cold water until 
ready for use. Stew parings and perfect cores in water etiOugh to 
cover. When tender, strain, put in the sliced fruit and boil. Beat 
with a wooden spoon until thick, add the sugar and lemon-juice, 
cook steadily one hour longer, beating with a wooden spoon fre- 
quently. Pack in small jars while warm; when cold, tie up securely. 

Pear Marmalade. — Divide the pears, core and boil soft. Eub 
through a sieve and put to each pound of pulp f of a pound of 
sugar. Stew over a slow fire till it becomes a thick jelly, stirrinsr 
constantly toward the last. 

Grape Marmalade, (Amber Ooloe). — Separate the skin from 
pulp of the grapes and cook the pulp with 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of 
water until soft enough to rub through a sieve to remove the seeds. 
To 4 quarts of this pulp add 2 quarts of smoothly cooked sour 
apple sauce, measured after cooking. Let it get hot before the 
sugar is put in; add the grated yellow rind of 3 lemons. Gook half 
an honr after the sugar is added. The apples may be cooked the 
day before using. This sauce will grow firm like jelly. Pat in 
small jars. This quantity will need 7tpounds of sugar. 



PRESERVES. ^ 331 

Orape Marmalade (Eed Coloe). — Boil the skins of the grapes 
in water enough to cover them. Strain through a coarse cloth. 
To 3 quarts of juice add 3 quarts of sour apples, stewed; the juice 
and pulp of 4 lemons, 1 ounce of stick cinnamon, broken in bits 
and tied up in cloth, and 7 pounds of sugar. Let all get hot 
together and add the sugar afterward. Stir until it dissolves. 
Boil one-half hour; take out the spice bag when the flavor suits. 
Put up in bowls and cover with paper, like jelly, after it is cold. 
Will keep years. 1^ pecks of sour apples and 25 pounds of grapes 
will make the two kinds of marmalade given above. They should 
be made at the same time, using the grape pulp for one and the 
juice for the other. 

Lemon Marmalade. — Slice the lemons thin, removing the 
seeds; add 3 pints of cold water to each pound of fruit, after cut- 
ting. Let it stand twenty-four hours, then boil until tender; pour 
into an earthen bowl until the following day.. Weigh it and to 
every pound of boiled fruit add 1^ pounds of lump sugar; boil the 
whole together until the syrup jellies and the chips are rather 
transparent. 

Peach Marmalade. — Pare, stone and weigh the fruit. Boil 
one-half the peach-kernels in a cupful of water or enough to cover 
them well. Quarter the peaches and add to the water, after strain- 
ing it; heat slowly, stirring often with a wooden spoon. Then 
boil for three-quarters of an hour. Add | pound of sugar to each 
pound of fruit; boil for five minutes, skim and put in the juice of 
1 lemon to every 3 pounds of fruit. Boil a few minutes, stewing 
to a smooth paste. When nearly cold put in glass jars. 

Apple Marmalade. — Take any kind of sour apples, pare and 
core them; cut in sipall pieces, and to every pound of apples put 
I pound of sugar. Boil over a slow fire until reduced to a fine 
pulp. Put in jelly jars and keep in a cool place. 

Pineapple Marmalade. — Grated pine-apple and powdered 
sugar, pound for poand. Boil until thick, then pack in tumblers, 
and when cold, paste over with papers dipped in the beaten 
white of egg. Keep in a cool place. 

Orange Marmalade. — Peel the oranges, boU the peel until 
tender; scrape ofE the wjute lining with a knife, to remove the

bitterness, and chop the remainder fine. Divide the oranges ; 
remove the stringy edges and the seeds; chop fine and add to the 
peel. To each pint of this mixture add 1 pound of sugar; boil 
untU it thickens and put in glasses. 

Pear Marmalade. — Pare, core and quarter 6 pounds of 
small pears ; steam until tender. Put in a preserving-kettle and 
add to them 4 pounds of sugar and 3 cupfuls of water ; set over 
the fire, mash and stir the fruit while cooking untU. it is thick like 
jelly. When cool secure same as jeUy. Use a wooden spoon. 

PInm Marmalade. — Take the pulp remaining after making 
plum jelly, add | pound of sugar to 1 pound of pulp, first putting 
it through a colander. Cook well, stirring frequently. 

Tomato Marmalade. — Ripe tomatoes, pared; sugar, pound 
for pound. Put in a preserving kettle, adding 1 ounce of ginger- 
root and the juice and grated yellow rind of 2 lemons to every 3 
pounds of fruit (the ginger may be omitted if disliked). Boil 3 
hours, skimming frequently. When a smooth mass put in jars 
and tie down tiglitly. Egg paper may be used or not. Very nice. 

Pear Butter. — Pare, core and cut in small pieoes. Allow 
J pound of light brown sugar to each pound of fruit, a'ad 1 cupful 
of cold water to every 2 pounds of pears. Add the sugar when 
they have cooked one hour, together with 1 quart of cider to each 
2 pounds of sugar, and let all cook slowly until a thick marmalade. 
This will take about four hours. Sliould it get too dry wMle cook- 
ing add more cider. 

Muskmelou Batter. — Take very ripe melons, so tipe as to 
be soft; cut them open, take out the seeds, then scrape the melon 
from the rind with a knife, and to every 2 gallons of melon take 
2i- pounds of brown sugar. Put in a kettle and boil Htm same as 
apple butter. Flavor whila hot with lemon. Good. 

Plum Butter. — Cook the plums untU tender; run through a 
colander, put in a preserving-kettle with a very little water. To 
each poxmd of fruit add i pound sugar, though by uemg | to l 
pound it will thicken sooner and more butter wUl be made from 
less fruit. Boil until thick, stirring alnaost constantly after the 
sugar is added. This is a delicious butter. 

Plum Batter (11). — When plums are scarce a nice Gutter 



PRESERVES. 333 

may be made by taking plums and sweet apples, half and half; 
boil both until tender, using separate kettles. Put both through a 
colander; mix and cook as above. 

Orape Butter. — Pulp the grapes, put the skins in a bag, stew 
the pulps until the seeds can be removed by rubbing through a 
colander. To each pound of the pulp add 1 pound 6f sugar, J 
pint of cider vinegar, J teaspoonful of cloves, 1 teaspoonful of cin- 
namon and 1 teaspoonful of nutmeg. Boil this very slowly, 
putting in the bag of skins, tied securely. When it jellies by 
dropping in cold water it is done. Put away in jars. For an 
ornamental dish it can be re-heated and put in fancy molds to jelly 
over. 

Grape Butter, (II). — Take sweet apples and grapes, half and 
half. Cook the apples tender and rub through a colander. Pre- 
pare the grapes as above, using 1 pound of sugar to 2 pounds of 
the mixed fruit. The skins may be boiled in a bag and taken out 
as above, or they may be stirred into the butter. The above is the 
better way. Leave plain or spice according to fir^t recipe. 

Orange Butter. — Take the juice of 6 oranges and yolks of 
8 hard-boiled eggs. Eub together in a mortar with 5 tablespoon- 
fuls of pulverized loaf sugar and 1 tablespoonful of orange-water. 
"When reduced to a paste stir over a slow fire for twenty minutes 
until thickened. Dip a mold in cold water and pour in the mix- 
ture. When cold turn out and serve with fancy cakes. 

Pumpkin Butter.— 

3 pints of mashed pumpkin. 

1 pound of sugar. 4 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

Flavor with ginger root, nutmeg and lemon peel. 

Either bake or steam the pumpkin. Eub thoroughly through 
a sieve, mix with the sugar, butter, flavor, and let simmer on 
the back of the stove one hour. It becomes thick and can be kejjt- 
in jars in a dark place. Use the same as fruit jelly or marmalade. 

Apple Butter. — Take equal parts of sweet cider, boiled-down 
one-half, and fine juicy apples, pared and quartered — 2 gallons or 
the boiled-down cider and 2 gallons of the prepared fruit. Put the 
cider in a large kettle (never use brass or bell-metal) and boil 
down, then add the fruit, boil for two hours. When the fruit be;

r:.;n3 to settle arrange to have it cook more slowly, stirring gently 
^lutil done. A large wooden spoon or a paddle made for the pur- 
pose must be used. Cook until it is a smooth brown pul^, like a 
tliin marmalade; one-half hour before removing from the fire, add 
3 heaping tablespoonfuls of ground cinnamon and 1 tablespoonful 
of allspice. (If the spice is boiled in from the first it will lose 
its flavor.) Four pints of brown sugar to the above amount of 
fruit. Some cooks prefer to omit the sugar. When cold put in 
large stone jars closely covered. If suificiently boiled it will keep 
a year or more. This quantity may be doubled or quadrupled at 
pleasure. Two or three qiiarts more of apple may be added to first 
two gallons, if the cider will admit of it. 

Grape Cheese. — Put the grapes over the fire in a preserving 
kettle, add a little water. Let scald until they can be put through 
a colander. Eeturn the smooth pulp to the kettle, add f pound 
granulated sugar to 1 pound of the frnit pulp. Boil down stiff, 
pack in glasses and seal with egg paper like jelly. Very nice. 

Tomato Figs. — Take plum or pear tomatoes, scald and skin 
them. Take 3 pounds of brown siigar to 8 pounds or ^ peck of 
the fruit. Cock them with the sugar until they are transparent. 
Remove from the syrup and spread on a dish, flatten down and 
dry in the sun. Sprinkle over thera a little of the syrup from 
time to time while drying. When dry pack in boxes, sprinkling 
powdered sugar between the layers. They will keep their flavor 
from year to year. The taste is very much like that of figs. Any 
syrup remaining may be boiled down and bottled to flavor pudding 
sauce. 

Home-made Figs. — Pare and core pears, peaches and quinces. 
Make a syrup as for Candied Fruit. Flavor it with lemon peel. 
Boil the fruit in this until it is tender, then drain and spread on 
dishes. Place in the sunshine or in a moderately heated oven to 
dry. When- half dry sprinkle with loaf sugar, finish drying, pack 
in boxes, sprinkling sugar between each layer and upon the top. 
Figs prepared in this way are considered superior to imported figs. 
Save the syrup to flavor pudding sauces.

tity of sugar , cooking until the syrup thickens. Then dry on 
plates in the sun or a moderate oven. Keep in close jar. Bottle 
the syrup and use for flavoring pudding sauce. This may be used 
in cake instead of the regular citron. 

Peach Paper. — Peel, pit and mash very ripe peaches. To 8 
quarts of pulp put 1 pound of sugar. Let boil a minute or two. 
Spread on plates to dry in the sun ; when dry sprinkle with sugar 
and roll up. Keep in a dry place. 

Preserved Orange and Lemon Peel.— Cut the rind in nar- 
row shreds. BoU in plenty of water until tender and then boil 
thirty minutes in a syrup that has been used for making fruit 
candy, or make a small quantity in the same proportions. Nice 
for mince-meat, fruit cake and to mix with candied fruits and 
raisins on the table. 

Dried Plums. — Pit and put in jars, a layer of fruit alter- 
nately with a layer of sugar in the proportion of ^ pound sugar to 
i pound of fruit. Let stand over night. Then put the jar over 
the fire and boil ten minutes, skimming carefully. Eemove the fruit . 
from the syrup and spread thinly over plates and dry in the sun or 
a moderate oven, turning frequently untU dry. Pack carefully in 
boxes. Nice for stewing, for fruit puddings or pies. The syrup 
that is left can be used in the proportion of a pint to a quart of 
good cider vinegar in making sweet fruit pickles. 

Dried Peaches, Plums and Apples.— Pit, peel and cut to 
suit; dry partly and then pack them in jars, spreading sugar 
thickly between the layers. Tie down and they will keep well and 
be delicious for pies or sauce. They may also be dried without any 
sugar and put away for use. 

Dried Peaches. — Halve the fruit, remove the stones, fill the 
cavities with white sugar and dry in a moderate oven. The fruit, 
if first-class peaches are used, will be found delicious, almost 
equal when stewed to preserves, and far more healthful and 
economical. 

Dried Gooseherries. — To seven pounds of red gooseberries 
add 1^ pounds sugar. Let them stand over night, or twenty-four 
hours mixed with the sugar. Then scald imtil they break; sprea4^^

paper boxes. 

Dried Currants, Blackberries and Raspberries.— Dry in 

the same manner as Gooseberries. Use more sugar if desired. 

Dried Cherries. — Cherries can be dried same as Gooseberries, 
using a Httle more sugar, or the same as Plums. Chenies can be 
dried without sugar. 

Dried PnmpMn. — Prepare a large kettleful as for stewing. 
Let boU briskly until all the water has evaporated, then let boil 
slowly, stirring often until very dry and beginning to brown 
slightly. Put on plates in a moderate oven to dry. Hang up in a 
closely-tied paper x/ag. When wanted for use take a piece the size 
of an egg and pnc it in a quart of warm milk over night. It will 
be ready for use in the morning. 

Dried Tomatoes. — Take fully ripe tomatoes, peel, squeeze 
slightly to remove part of the juice and lay in the sun or a mod- 
erate oven until thoroughly dry, turning frequently and putting 
on fresh plates, if necessary, to avoid the extra juice that accumu- 
lates. Tie in a paper bag when dried. When ready for use cut 
them tip, boil soit, season and thicken with cracker-<muab<! «b Ioi

Q-ELTED PARAPFINE poured on top of jellies, jama, etc., 
also on the top of canned fruit when the covers are dis- 
colored, will be all the covering necessary, excepting a 
doth or paper to exclude dust. One can use the parafSne many 
times. 

Fbdit, to make good jelly, should be chosen before it is too 
ripe. 

Fruit, to exteaot the juices well, should be brought to a scald. 
Put in a stone jar, mash and stand the jar in a kettle of boiling 
water. Scald thoroughly and strain through a coarse cloth ; squeeze 
but slightly that the jelly may be clear. 

Jelly should not stop boiling until done. Do not make too 
large a quantity at once. 

Strawberry Jelly may be made in small quantities when 
there is too much juice left from canning them. 

Jelly is much nicer if strained before putting in glasses. A 
flannel bag is very nice for this purpose. Do not squeeze nor stir, 
but let drip slowly through. Placing it near the stove will pre- 
vent the jelly thickening and hasten the straining process. 

A PAN or a shallow preserving kettle is best for boiling jeUy. 
Do not use a brass kettle. 

Set the glasses, when filling them, on a folded dapp towel, 
or drop a silver spoon in the glass to prevent breakage. 

Mold may be prevented by covering the surface of the jelly 
thickly with powdered white sugar. 

Jelly, to turn out nicely, should have the mold dipped in 
hot water for a second.

338 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Test Jelly by dipping out a little in a saucer, or dropping a 
teaspoonful in a glass of cold water, though if made according to 
rule a test is usually unnecessary. 

Cover the glasses with papers dipped in beaten egg. Press 
down tightly around the edges. Use two or three papers; tie 
down firmly. 

Currant Jelly.- Crush the fruit and put it in a stone jar 
placed in a kettle of boiling water. When sufficiently softened 
strain through a jelly -bag or coarse towel, do not squeeze too 
much. Weigh the juice and put in a preserving-kettle. Weigh 
an equal amount of granulated sugar, put this in a large dripping- 
pan, lined with pale brown paper, to prevent discoloration, and 
place in the oven. Let it get very hot, but not scorched. Stir 
occasionally. Allow the juice to boil twenty minutes, skim 
thoroughly; add the heated sugar. Let all come to a boil and 
remove from the fire; fill the jelly-glasses full and allow the jelly 
to set before sealing. Bead the hints at beginning of this division. 
Egg-paper is the best covering for jelly. 

Cni'railt Jelly (Uncooked). — Strain and squeeze the juice in 
the usual way, but do not scald the fruit. Put the juice in a stone 
jar, stir a few minutes, then add granulated sugar ia the proportion 
of pound for pound, with the juice, stiring constantly until the sugar 
is completely dissolved ; dip out or strain into tumblers. Let 
stand untU it stiffens, and cover with egg-paper. A very nice way. 

White Currant Jelly. — Make as above, only straining the 
fruit to prevent discoloration of the juice. Strain through a white 
cloth and proceed same as for Uncooked Jelly. Seal up with egg- 
paper. Li several weeks the jelly will harden perfectly and be 
very clear. 

Apple Jelly. — Cut and core tart apples ; add water to nearly 
cover, and boil until a pulp. Strain, pressing lightly; add f pound 
of granulated sugar to a pound of the juice.. Boil until it wiU 
jelly on a flat plate, and strain into glasses. Cover as directed. 
Some flavor with lemon juice or lemon essence. 

Quince and Apple Jelly.— Cut small and core; equal weight 
of tart apples and quinces. Put the quinces into a preserving- 
kettle with water to cover them; boil gently until soft; then add 



"J^i'i.V 339 

the apples, let them boil until a pulp (there should be water enough 
to cover them), then put into a jeUy-bag and strain 'without press- 
ing it. To each pint of the hquid put 1 pound of white sugar, 
and let it boil gently over the fire until it will jelly when cool. 
Put in tumblers and seal the next day. 

Take the pulp left in the jelly-bag, squeeze out all the 
juice, put 1 large cupful of A sugar (C will do) to each pint; boil 
and skim. When it jellies, put in glasses as above. This will be 
nice but not as clear as the first. 

The pulp may be made into a marmalade by adding ^ pound 
of sugar to each pound of fruit, boiling down until quite thick. 

Crab-apple Jelly. — Eemove the stems and blossom ends; 
cut out any defects, then put in a kettle with water to just cover 
them. Let stew very slowly until almost a pulp; strain and 
squeeze lightly. Add 1 pound of sugar to 1 pint of the juice 
boil one-half -hour, skim and pour into tumblers. 1 peck makes 
about twenty-one tumblers. 

Peach Jelly (With Gelatine). — Make a thin syrup with 10 
ounces of granulated sugar and ^ pint of water. Then take 12 
ripe peaches, pare, halve, and remove the pits, then blanch and 
bruise 6 kernels. Put the peaches and the oruised kernels into 
the syrup and allow them to simmer for fifteen minutes, adding 
for flavor the juice of two lemons and the grated yellow rind. 
Strain the juice through a jelly-bag, add 2 ounces of gelatine, dis- 
solved in enough warm water to cover. Pour into a mold ; if re- 
quired for immediate use set on ice until stiff enough to turn 'out. 
ilf it is to be kept put in jelly-glasses and seal. 

Peach Jelly. — Pare, stone and quarter the peaches and put in 
a stone crock; add to i,hem J of the kernels, and set the jar in a 
kettle of boiling water. Stir and beat the fruit until a pulp; 
strain, and to every pint of juice add the juice of 1 lemon; 
measure again and to every pound of the liquid allow 1 pound of 
white sugar. Heat the sugar same as for currant jeUy. Let 
the juice boil twenty minutes ; skim, add the sugar, let come to a 
boil and pour into jelly-glasses. Delicious. Very nice for Jelly 
Oake. 

€herss Jelly.— Pit the cherries, put in a stone crook and 



340 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

set in a kettle of boiling water to seald. Strain, and proceed with 
as for currant jelly. 

Tomato Jelly. — Peel the tomatoes and squeeze through a 
cloth; weigh and add pound for pound of white sugar. Boil to 
a jelly and seal up. Keep in a cool, dry place. Flavor with lemon 
juiceif wished. This is an excellent article. 

Pie-plant Jelly. — Cut staJks of pie-plant* up in small pieces 
with the skin on, throwing out all the green upper ends near the 
leaf. Stew down well with a little water at first to prevent 
burning. Strain through a muslin cloth, add white sugar pound 
for pound with the juice. Boil fifteen or twenty minutes. Pour 
in tumblers. This is a delicious and ornamental jelly. 

Plam Jelly. — Take perfectly sound plums, remove the stems, 
wash and make an incision in each one. Put in a jar, cover, set 
the jar in a kettle of boiling water and let boil 3 or 4 hours until 
all the juice is extracted from the fruit. Strain and boil with an 
equal weight of granulated sugar until it jellies, stirring constantly. 
Put in glasses, sealing as usual. If the plums are not squeezed in 
straining the juice, (and the jelly will be clearer if they are not), 
the pulp may be made into a very nice marmalade by adding | 
poimd of sugar to 1 pound of the pulp and cooking until thick. 

Wild Flam Jelly. — Wash the fruit and boil in water enough 
to cover until the plums are a pulp. Strain, weigh the juice, add 
I of a pound of sugar to a pound of juice and make as other jeUy. 
Do not squeeze the pulp, simply strain and make marmalade of the 
remainder. 

Cranberry Jelly.— 
8 quarts of cranberries. 
2 pounds granulated sugar. 
1 quart of water. 

Cook thoroughly, mash with a silver spoon and put through a 
jelly bag. Put the juice back on the stove and boil fifteen minutes 
longer. Pour in glasses and seal when cold. 

Gooseberry Jelly. — Take gooseberries that have just com 
menoed to turn red. Eemove stem and blossom ends, put in a jar^ 
crush with a potato masher and set the jar in a kettle of boiling 
water and boil until the juice is extracted. Strain and press, add 



white sugar in equal weight with the juice, boil until it will jelly. 
When cold, pour in glasses and seal. 

Ripe Grape Jelly. — Stem, wash, put in a porcelain kettle; to 
every 8 pounds of fruit add 1 cupful of cold water. Boil until 
quite soft, and strain through a jelly bag. Allow granulated sugar 
pound for pound with the grape juice. Boil half an hour, add 
the sugar and boil five minutes longer; pour in glasses. Seal when 
cold with egg paper. Sometimes a pleasant change in the flavor 
of ripe grape jelly is made by adding 1 tablespodnful of cinnamon 
to a quart of the grape juice and boiling with it. 

Ripe Grape Jelly (11).— Pulp the fruit, scald the pulps unlal 
they can be strained, add to the juice an equal weight of granulated 
sugar and boil, or, proceed as for currant jeUy. A clear, beautiful 
jelly will be the result. 

Green Grape Jelly. — Put over the fruit to scald as for Eipe 
Grape Jelly, (first recipe). Mash them while cooking to extract 
the juice. Use grapes that have just turned slightly. Strain, 
weigh and boil fifteen or twenty minutes. In the meantime heat 
an equal amount of granulated sugar. Stir in and turn into 
glasses. When firm, cover, with egg-paper. 

Huckleberry Jelly. — Take berries with the bloom upon 
them, put in an earthen jar, cover closely and set in a kettle of 
cold water; let this boil gently until the juice is extracted from the 
fruit. Then strain, measure, turn into a porcelain kettle and boil 
two minutes. Add an equal weight of granulated sugar, throwing 
in at the last an extra cupful or bowl (according to the quantity of 
juice) of sugar. Let boU ten minutes. If it hardens in cooling 
remove at once, if not boU a little longer. Put up in small jats or 
glasses and cover with egg-paper. A teaspoonfut of strong vinegar 
to each pint of juice will improve the flavor. 

Strawberry Jelly.— Take fresh, ripe fruit; hull and put in 
jar. Set this in a kettle of cold water, let the water boil until the 
juice is separated from the fruit, but not until the fruit is broken 
to any extent, as ibis would injure the color of the jelly. Eun 
through a jelly-bag without pressing. If the juice is not perfectly 
clear, strain again through muslin, weigh and put in a preserving 
kettle. Boil very gently fifteen minutes, then add an equal weigh* 



342 THREK MEALS A DAY. 

of granulated sugar and boil ten minutes. Seal like other jellies. 
Make a marmalade of the berries with the addition of ^ pound of 
sugar to 1 pound of fruit. 

Blackberry Jelly. — Make same as Currant Jelly, using only 
I pound of sugar to 1 pound of juice. This is a very nice jelly and 
is preferred by many to the jam. The addition of a small propor- 
tion of currants improves the flavor. 

Raspberry Jelly. — Make same as Blackberry Jelly. Add a 
few currants if liked. 

rOHr-Fruit Jelly. — Take raspberries, strawberries, currants 
and cherries. All should be fully ripe; stone the cherries. Throw 
all together in a jar and set in a kettle of cold water; let this boil 
until the fruit is scalded. Strain through a jelly-bag, pressing as 
little as possible and proceed as for currant jelly. Cool a little bit, 
stirring; if it congeals readily, pour in glasses. Tie down with 
egg-paper. The flavor of this jelly is much finer than that made 
of currants or raspberries alone. 

Calfe's Foot Jelly. — Wash and clean the feet of a large calf. 
Put them to boil in 8 quarts of water. When the water is half 
boiled away, strain through a sieve and set it to cool. When per- 
fectly cold, remove every particle of fat from the top; take up the 
jelly, removing any sediment that may be at the bottom. Set it 
over the fire again, letting it dissolve slowly without stirring; 
before it is hot add the whites of 6 eggs beaten stiif , the juice of 6 
lemons and 8 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. Let it boil, 
skimming thoroughly until it is perfectly clear. Try a teaspoonful 
on a plate to cool. If not ^lUiSciently firm, boil longer or add ^ 
ounce of gelatine or isinglass dissolved in enough water to cover it. 
Put some of the yeUow -skins of the lemons in the jelly-bag and 
strain through. This gives the jeUy a fine, amber color. A stick 
of cinnamon may be ^ut in at the same time with the lemon juice; 
remove before straining. Fasten the jelly-bag (it should be 
flannel; wring it out of hot water before using, to enable the liquid 
to run more freely) near the fire and do not stir nor press. Calf's 
foot jelly can be made by simply sweetening, leaving out the 
lemon-juice and cinnamon. When for invalids, the physician 
(frequently ordera a winaglasa^f pale branny or a pint of Madtii-a 



JSLLY. 343 

wine added to this quantity. This jelly can be molded in any 
^orm. It will only keep for a few days. Make the day before 
using. For cleaning the feet see page 23. 

Harlequin Jelly. — Wash a jelly mold with the white of egg. 
Melt a little currant jelly and pour into it; let it cool. When cold, 
melt some plum jelly and pour in; let this cool. Melt crab-apple 
jelly, and so on, in layers of various colors, till the mold is full. 
Care must be taken that the jellies are only warm, enough to rim, 
if they are hot they will mix and spoil the effect. High-colored 
jellies and blanc-mange molded in the same way make a beautiful 
harlequin. Turn out when cold and firm. 

Pyramid Jellies. — Mold variously colored jellies, the more 
the better, in wineglasses pointed in shape. "Warm a little of each 
enough to run, fill the glasses and cool. Turn but on an orna- 
mental plate, arrange prettily and heap whipped cream about the 
base. Serve one pyramid to each person in a sauce-dish with a 
portion of cream. Lemon and orange jellies may be molded and 
served in the same way. A dainty dish for a company tea. Takes 
the place of fruits. 

Lemon Jelly (With Geiuatine) — 1 package of Oox's gelatine 
soaked in enough cold water to cover it. Then add the juice of 3 
lemons and 2 cupfuls of white sugar. Pour over this 1 scant quart 
of boiling water, stir until dissolved and strain into jelly-molds 
(see Pyramid Jellies), or use 1 large mold with a tube in the center. 
Wet it in cold water before using. Before serving, set the mold 
In hot water a moment and the jelly will turn out easily. Whip 
to a froth J pint of cream, sweeten with 2 tablespoonfuls of 
powdered sugar. Fill the hollow left by the tube with.this, heap- 
ing in the center, and pile the remainder around the base, or if 
the mold is solid, heap around the base. Lemon jelly is delicious 
without the Whipped cream. If the cream is used, serve some to 
each, using ornamental sauce-dishes. 

Orange Jelly. — Grate the yellow peel of 5 oranges and 2 
lemons into a bowl, and add the juice of the fruit. Make a syrup 
of 1 pound of sugar to a quart of water. Let boil, add 2 ounces of 
isinglass; stir until well dissolved, add the syrup. Strain through 
thin muslin, let stand until half cold, then pour gently into molds 



344 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

that have been wet in cold water. Before turning out, sex the 
mold in hot water for a few minutes and loosen the edges with a, 
spoon. For methods of serving, see Lemon Jelly. Use granulated 
sugar. 

Coffee Jelly. — 1 quart of strong coffee sweetened to please the 
taste, J box of Cox's gelatine dissolved in water enough to cover. 
Stir this into boUing hot coffee, and when dissolved, strain through 
a flannel cloth or jelly-bag and put in a mold; do not press the bag, 
set in a wet mold to form. When ready to serve, turn out on a 
flat dish and serve with whipped cream heaped about the base. 
Serve with fancy cakes or sliced cake. The whipped cream may 
be omitted. Some serve with cream and sugar. 

Cow's Heel Jelly.— BoU 2 cow-heels in 1 gallon of water 
until the bones come out readily. Let cool and remove the fat 
carefully. Take the juice of 3 lemons and turn into the jelly, add 
loaf sugar to the taste and put in a stick or so of cinnamon, add 3 
well-beaten eggs. Let it boil and cool. Eepeat the boiling and 
cooling three times, then strain and mold for use. 

Boiled Cider Jelly. — To each pint of boiled cider add 1 
pound sugar and boU ten minutes. This makes a nice jelly for 
tarts. 

Quince Jelly. — Polish the quinces smooth with a cloth, cut 
in small pieces and pack in a kettle, pour in cold water to cover, 
boil until soft. Make a three-cornered flannel bag, pour in the 
fruit and hang up to drain, pressing occasionally to make the juice 
run more freely. Keep in a warm place. This will also assist the 
process, and the weight of the fruit will cause the juice to flow 
freely to the point. This shape of bag should be used for all jellies. 
To 1 pint of the juice add 1 pint of sugar and boil fifteen minutes. 
Pout into tumblers, or bowls, and seal according to directions 
before given. ,

GUSTARDSi 

t/^LAIN BOILED OUSTAED.— BoU 1 pint of new milk; 
»>^ thicken mth 1 tablespoonful flour, nibbed smooth with a 
^~* little cold milk kept back for the purpose. Let cool partly, 
add 1 egg well-beaten, sweeten to taste; set on the fire again and 
heat until it thickens, stirring coinstantly ; do not let it boil. Flavor 
with lemon, almond or Tanilla. Stick cinnamon or broken nut- 
meg may be boiled in the milk and removed before the thickening 
is added. 

BoUed Custard.— 

i eggs. 3 tablespoonfuls sugar. 

1 quart sweet milk. Flayor (see above). 

Three or four peach leaves boiled in the milk before the eggs 
are added is a very delicate flavor. Cool the milk before adding 
the eggs. Boil in a double boiler or a tin paLL set in a kettle of 
boiling water, stirring constantly. If wished richer, 5 or 6 eggs 
m&j be used to 1 quart of milk. 
Baked Cnstard.— 

1 quart of milk^ 4 eggs. 

A pinch of salt. 

Sweeten and flavor to taste. 
Boil the milk; when cool add the beaten eggs, salt and flavor- 
ing. Bake in a pudding dish. Take especial care not to cook too 
much or it will whey. To test, sink a spoon in the middle: if the 
eggs are hard and no whey rises to the .surface it is done. Serve 
opld. If wished richer, 6 or 6 eggs may be used to a quart of 
milk. If wished very nice this custard may be baked in a pud- 
ding dish lined with rich puflf paste. 



346 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Cnp Cnstards. — Make the custard as above. Butter some 
custard cups and fill nearly full; set them in a dripping-pan and 
fill it nearly to the top of the cups with boiling water; set in a hot 
oven for one-half hour. Serve the cups on a custard stand or 
throw a handsome napkin over a large dish or tray and arrange 
the cups on it. Serve with ripe fruit and sugar or with preserves, 
jelly or marmalade. Cup custards may be set in a steamer and 
steamed. 

Rennet Castard. -Take a piece of rennet 1^ inches long or 
a dessert-spoonful of the spirits in which rennet has been kept, for 
1 quart of milk. Flavor with vanilla, lemon or almond and 
sweeten with 1 tablespoonf ul of sugar. Cover and set in a warm 
place near the fire. If in an hour's time there are no signs of 
thickening add more rennet. When it is firm like blanc-mange, 
and before the curd separates from the whey, remove the rennet, 
unless the liquid form has been used, and set the custard in a cool 
place or on ice until it is served. Powdered sugar or cream should 
be sent up with the custard. 

Home-made Rennet is the best for use. Procure a calf's 
stomach from the meat market, having it first thoroughly scoured 
inside and out with salt. Tack it upon a frame and dry in thw 
sun a day or two. Cut in squares, put in a bottle and cover with 
alcohol or pack in salt, in which case the rennet when used must 
first be soaked half an hour in water and washed well. Tie the 
square of rennet to a string for convenience in removing from the 
curd. The dried rennet may sometimes be bought at the drug- 
gists. Eennet custard is an economical, delightful and easily pre- 
pai»d dish. 

Rice Custard. — 
1 quart of milk. 3 eggs well-beaten. 

3 tablespoonfuls sugar. 1 tablespoonful butter. 

^ teaspoonful salt. 1 small cupful boiled rice.

one-half hour. Then add 4 well-beaten eggs or the yolks of 8, 
(this •will make it richer, at the same time the whites can be used 
for cake or frosting), and stir until it begins to thicken. Season 
with J teaspoonful of salt. If extract of vanilla be used instead 
ot the bean, add 2 teaspoonfuls after the custard is taken from the 
fire. Pour into cups. 

Baked Chocolate Cnstard.— 

1 quart milk. 

4 tablespoonfuls grated chocolate. 

4 tablespoonfuls sugar. 4 eggs well-beaten. 

Mix, pour in cups and bake. It may be baked in one large 
dish and 1 egg (white) reserved and whipped into a meringue to 
spread over the top of the custard. Flavor the custard with 
vanilla. 

Orange Custard. — Boil the rind of 1 orange until tender; 
pound fine in a mortar; add to it the juice of 2 oranges, J pound 
sugar, 4 well-beaten eggs. Beat thoroughly together and add 1

tion until it sets. Turn into custard cups and ^erve cold. 

Almond Custards. 

1 quart of mUk. IJ pounds almonds. 

6 yolks of eggs. 4 whites. 

Blanch the almonds and rub to a paste with 1 tablespoonful 
of rose-water and a little grated white sugar. Boil the paste in 
the milk four or five minutes. Beat the eggs and 1 tablespoonful 
of sugar; turn into the milk ; stir constantly until it thickens. 
Eemove from the fire ; stir until partly cool and pour in custard 
cups. If the custards are to be cooled quickly, set the cups in a 
pan ot cold wat^r, changing two or three times. Just before 
serving beat the reserved whites to a froth with 1 tablespoonful of 
white eugar and spread over each custard.

otherwise. 



348 THRE^ MEALS A DAY. 

Make this custard in the same way, using the proportion oj 
4 eggs to 1 quart of milk, and pour it hot over plain sponge cake, 
sliced for dessert. Very nice. 
Cream Custards.— 

1 pint of sweet cream, mixed with 

1 pint of sweet milk. 4 well-beaten eggs. 

3 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

Flavor with nutmeg, lemon, rose or vanilla. Bake in cups, set- 
ting them in a pan of boiling water. It can be baked in one large 
dish. 

Tapiora Custard. — 

4 tablespoonfuls of tapioca, soaked over night in 
1 pint of cold water; in the morning add 

1 quart of milk. 

Put over the fire and let boil up. Then stir in the 
3 egg yolks. 1 cupful sugar. 

Salt and flavor. Turn into a dish and frost with the whites 
of the eggs beaten stiff with a tablespoonful of sugar. Serve cold.

with a little cold milk; then add 1 quart of pure milk and J teacup- 
ful of powdered sugar. Heat slowly in an enameled saucepan. Boil 
fifteen minutes, stirring briskly. Flavor to taste and pour in a 
pudding-dish Then make a custard of the yolks of 4 eggs and 
the whites of 2, well beaten together, 3 tablespoonfuls of sugar 
and 1 quart of sweet milk. Cook the custard and pour, when 
both are cold, over the Farina. Whip the whites of two eggs 
to a stiff froth with 1 tablespoonful of sugar, and pour over the 
custard. A beautiful dish. 

Indian Meal Custard. — 

1 quart of sweet milk, good measure. 

2 tablespoonfuls of Indian-meal. 

Heat 1 pint of the milk to boiling point and pour over the 
meal. Let partly cool. In a few minutes add the remainder of 
the milk measure, then the yolks of 2 eggs, beaten with ^ cupful 
of sugar. Beat the whites of the eggs stiff, and just before put- 
ting in the oven, stir in quickly. Bake one-half hour in a pud- 
diag-dish. 



SUMMER DESSERTS. 349 

Lemon Custard.— 

3 eggs. I cupful of sugar. 

1 tablespoonful butter. 2 cupfuls of water. 

2 tablespoonfuls of corn- 1 large lemon, 
starch. , 

Beat the yolks of the eggs, the butter and sugar together. 
Mix the corn-starch with a little of the water. Stir all together 
and cook as for boiled custard. Remove from the stove and stir 
the beaten whites in lightly. The eggs may be beaten together if 
there is any haste. Pour in a large pudding-mold to cool, or 
in cups, and turn out. It may be served with sweet cream and 
sugar, or alone. 

Orange Custard. — Make same as Lemon Custard, substitut- 
ing 1 orange. 

Bird's Nest Custard. — Peel and core enough nice tart 
apples to fill a pudding-dish; fill the openings with sugar; pour 
over all a little water and cook until tender. Make a custard suf- 
ficient to cover the, apples in the dish in the proportion of 2 eggs 
to a pint of milk. Sweeten to taste and flavor with nutmeg. 
Bake tUl the custard sets. 

Floating Island. — 1 quart of sweet milk; boil. Stir in the 
beaten yolks of 6 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of white sugar and flavor 
with vanilla, lemon, rose or almond. Stir until it thickens. Pou2 
into a wide shallow dish. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff 
froth, sweetening and flavoring slightly. Spread the frothed 
eggs smoothly over the boiling-hot custard (doing it in this 
manner cooks the whitfes sufficiently without the trouble of setting 
them over boiling water). Grate loaf sugar over the top and 
sprinkle grated cocoanut over that. This last is not necessary but 
is a great improvement. Spoonfuls of jelly or jam may be 
scattered over the top. Set the dish in a pan of ice-water and 
serve cold as possible. This rule may be made with 4 eggs to the 
quart in place of 6, but is not so rich. Serve with cake for tea 
or lunch. 

Cream Floating Island. 

1| pints of sweet cream; add to this 
1 \nneglassful of rose-water. 



350 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Jtdce of !■ lemon. Sugar to sweeten. 

Turn into a deep dish. Beat the whites of 4 eggs to & stiff 
froth with 1 tahlespoonful of sugar. Stir lightly with this ^ pound 
of some stiff, dry preserve of small fruits and heap in the center 
of the dish, or turn in a broad shallow dish, and drop the froth 
by spoonfuls or islands over the cream. If the preserve is not at 
hand a spoonful of jelly or jam may be put in the center of each 
island. 

Floating Island I'Elegante.— Take 1 quart of rich cream; 
sweeten 1 pint of it with white sugar and stir into it sufficient 
currant jelly to color it a good pink. Spread shces of sponge 
cake thickly with jam or marmalade; pile them evenly in a glass 
dish; turn the cream over all. Flavor the other pint of cream 
with lemon ; whip to a stiff froth and heap over the cake. Very 
dainty. 

Floating Island I'Elegante (II).— Prepare the cake as 
above; make a custard as for Floating Island. Pour over the 
cake. Whip the whites of the eggs, as directed in the recipe; 
heap over the cake, flavoring and treating the froth according to 
the directions. 

Orange Sponge.— 

3 oranges, juice and pulp. J lemon, juice and pulp. 
3 tablespoonfuls white sugar. 2^ pints of cold water. 

Let all boil together and strain. Mix 2 tablespoonfuls of corn- 
starch in 1 little cold water; stir into the liquid and let boil ten 
or fifteen minutes. Set aside to cool. Beat up the whites of 3 
eggs and whip into the sponge with a Dover egg-beater when it is 
ready to serve. Send to the table in small dishes, or, perhaps, in 
tart-sheUs. 

Lemon sponge may be made in the same manner, using 1 
whole «!up of sugar. Serve this dish vnth or without whipped 
cream. Oranges are plentiful and cheap in the summer, and no 
one need hesitate to prepare this healthful and delightful dish. 

Lemon Sponge.— 

Juice of 4 lemons. 4 eggs. 

1 coffeecupful sugar. 1 pint cold water. 

1 otmce gelatine. 



SUMMER DESSERTS. 357- 

Soak the gelatine one hour in ^ cupful of the water. Mix 
the sugar with the juice of the lemons. Beat up the yolks of the 
eggs and stir into the remainder of the water; add the sugar and 
lemon and cook in a double-boiler or a paU set in a kettle of boil- 
ing water until it begins to thicken ; then add the gelatine. Set 
the dish in a pan of ice- water, beating it occasionally' with an egg- 
beater until it is cool, but not hard. Now mix in the unbroken 
whites of the eggs and beat all steadily until it begins to thicken. 
Turn into a mold or molds at once. Serve with or without cream. 
Orange Sponge may be made in the same way, but 6 large oranges 
will be required. 

Charlotte Eusse (Plain). — 

1 cupful thick whipped cream. 

1 cupful rich sweet milk. 1 ounce gelatine. 

1 cupful pulverized sugar. 

3 whites of eggs, well-beaten. 

Flavor with vanilla or almond extract. 
Dissolve the sugar and gelatine in the milk, stirring contin- 
ually. Keep hot,' but do not let boil ; pour into a dish set in ice- water. 
When nearly cold enough to harden pour in half the cream and 
beat ten minutes. Whip the 3 egg-whites and stir in, beating(five 
minutes longer. I'lavor. Fill the dish or mold with slices of 
sponge cake or lady-fingers ; pour in the prepared cream. Beat the 
remaining half cupful of cream and spread over the top. Cool on 
ice, if convenient. If in a mold it will turn out nicely. This 
may be made without cream, but is not as rich. In this case the 
whites of 2 more eggs must be sweetened, whipped stiff, flavored 
and spread over the top; grated cocoanut sprinkled over this will 
be an improvement, and spoonfuls of jelly dotted over all beautify 
what is at once a plain, delicious, feconomicai and ornamental dish. 
Charlotte Russe (Extba). — Have a glass dish ready, lined 
with slices of sponge cake or lady cake. Dissolve ^ box of gela- 
■Jiie in J pint of rich sweet cream ; place the saucepan in a vessel 
tit hot water — not boiling — and stir until it is dissolved. Sweeten 
this with ^ cupful of white sugar. Put IJ pints of rich cream in 
a large bowl. Flavor with vanilla or orange extract, or both. Set 
the bowl in a pan of ice- water or snow. When well chilled whip 



352 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

thoroughly -with an egg-beater. Add, if wished, the well-beaten 
whites of 2 eggs and whip again ; they will give the cream a little 
more consistency and make it a little richer. Pour the dissolved 
gelatine and milk into a broad, shallow dish, stirring all the time 
to prevent lumps. When it is nearly cold stir the whipped cream 
in slowly; pour it into the dish containing the cake, and set away 
to cool, on ice if possible; ^ pint of the cream may be reserved, 
whipped to a froth, and spread over the top. The cream may ba 
whipped while the gelatine is cooling. 

Cream Charlotte Eusse.— 

1 pint sweet cream. 1 cupful sugar. 

1 wineglassful rose-water. 

Other flavoring may be used in smaller quantity — 1 teaspoon- 
ful being sufficient for vanilla, almond, etc. Mix and put on ice, 
or set the dish in a pan of cold water, as it whips much better 
when chiUed. A whip-chum or Dover egg-beater does the work 
better than a fork. As the froth rises, remove by spoonfuls to a 
sieve placed over a dish. Eepeat this until aU has been frothed. 
The cream that drips down may be frothed over again. Let stand 
on ice or in a very cool place some time before using. Line the 
bottom and sides of a glass dish with sliced sponge or lady cake. 
Add the cold whipped cream and keep cold as possible until served. 
A much more delicate fiUing for Charlotte Eusse than where gela- 
tine is used. Lady fingers are nice to line the dish. 

Cnstard Charlotte Rnsse. — Slice sponge or lady cake, with 
raisins in it, enough to partly fill a glass bowl. Pour over this a 
boiled custard made according to rule for Boiled Custard. If a 
frosting is wished, make the custard in proportion of 6 eggs to 1 
quart of milk, and reserve 2 of the whites for this purpose. Whip 
them to a stiff froth with sugar and flavoring and place over the top. 

Corn-starch Charlotte Russe. — ^Line a pudding-dish with 
sliced sponge cake. Make a thin corn-starch sauce in the propor- 
tion of 1 tablespoonful of corn-starch to 1 quart of milk. Sweeten, 
flavor and stir in the beaten yolks of 2 eggs. Pour this over the 
cake. Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth; spread over 
the top and put in the oven long enough to harden. Turn out to 
serve. 



SUMMER DESSERTS. 353 

Creme de la Creme Charlotte Rrasse.— Line a mold, sides 

and bottom, with sliced sponge cake or lady-fingers. Whip 1 pint 
of cream with sugar, and flavor according to directions given in 
Cream Charlotte Basse. Fill the mold first with a layer of cream, 
then a layer of jelly; alternate in this way, having cream for the 
top layer. Let harden. 

CoflFee Charlotte Russe.— 

1 pint sweet cream. J box gelatine. 

1 cupful pulverized sugar. ^ cupful strong coffee. 

Line a mold, sides and bottom, with sliced sponge cake. Soak 
the gelatine one hour in water enough to cover; add just enough 
boiling water to dissolve it. Wh^p the cream according to direc- 
tions given in Cream Charlotte Eusse. Stir in the dissolved gela- 
tine lightly but thoroughly; then the sugar and the coffee a little 
at a time. Turn into the mold. A plain mold is easier to turn 
the Charlotte Russe from. Unless it is arranged in a glass dish a 
deep narrow bread-pan is very good for the purpose. Set in a 
cold place to congeal. This wUl keep over night iti a cool place. 
This makes it very desirable for Sunday desserts, or an elaborate 
tea or dinner where there are many other dishes that must be pre- 
pared the same day. , 

Tea Charlotte Russe. — Same as coffee. Substitute strong 
tea for coffee. 

Chocolate Charlotte Russe. — Prepare in precisely the same 
manner as above, substituting in place of coffee or tea, 4 table- 
spoonfuls of grated Baker's chocolate dissolved in J cup of hot 
milk. Let cool before adding to the cream. 

Orange Charlotte Russe. — Prepare in precisely the same 
manner as above, substituting the juice of 3 large oranges in the 
place of coffee, tea or chocolate. 

Lemon Charlotte Russe. — Prepare in precisely the same 
manner as above, substituting the juice of 2 large or 3 small 
lemons in the place of orange juice. These are all delicious dishes, 
healthful, delightful and by no means expensive ; delicious at any 
season of the year, but Especially so in summer.

ander. Set over the fire and stir in the yolks of 3 eggs. As soon 
as thoroughly hot (it must not boil) turn into a bowl. When cool 
whip in the beaten whites of the eggs mixed with 1 table- 
epoonful of white sugar. Line glass dish with sliced sponge cake 
or lady-fingers ; pile the apple within it; set on ice until wanted. 
The top may be covered with macaroons neatly fitted. 

Banana Charlotte. — Liue the sides of a quart mold with 
sliced sponge cake, and the bottom with sliced bananas, two layers 
deep. Fill the mold with stiff whipped cream. Set aside on ice 
until wanted. Eemove carefully from the mold and serve. The 
fiUing may be Bavarian Cream if liked. 

Fruit Charlotte. — Place in a glass dish a layer of sliced 
sponge cake or any deUcate plain cake. Dip each slice in sweet 
cream or rich milk. Make a boiled custard in the proportion of 
1 quart of milk, 4 yolks of eggs and J cupful of sugar; flavor to 
taste. Put a layer of ripe strawberries, raspberries, •blackberries 
or sliced peaches well sugared, and alternate with cake until the 
dish is filled. When the custard is cold pour over the whole. Beat 
the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth; sweeten, flavor and heap 
over the top. 

Chocolate Meringne. — Dissolve 2 tablespoonfuls of corn- 
starch in 1 tablespoonful of milk or water. Grate 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of chocolate into a saucepan and add to it 1 pint of milk ; stir 
until perfectly smooth. (An earthen dish is nice for such prepara- 
tions unless cooked in double boiler; they are not so apt to burn 
as in tin.) When it is scalding hot pour in the corn-starch and 
stir until it thickens ; then add the yolks of 2 eggs beaten with 2 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and stir until well thickened. Let cook aV 
minute, flavor with 1 teaspoonful vanilla, and pour in a glass dish. 
Just before serving, when it has cooled perfectly, cover it with a, 
meringue made of the whites of eggs beaten stiff with 2 table- 
spoonfuls of white sugar and a few drops of vanilla. This may 
be made with 1 egg, but is not quite as rich.

ifteen or twenty minutes in a quick oven. Beat the 4 whites to a 
§tif£ froth with 4 tablespoonfuls of sugar. Spread over the top; 
ibiomi lightly. Serve with cream. Good cold. 

DAINTY DISHRS. 

.(Apple Suow.— Take perfectly smooth tart apple sauce beaten 
JO a cream, or the pulp scraped from baked tart apples and beaten 
smooth. Sweeten well, and to every large cupful add the beaten 
■white of an egg. Beat aU together thoroughly with an egg-beater 
mitil it is a,s hght as possible. This is nice for dessert with cake, 
OS for tea, or invalids. 

Apple Trifle»(I>ELioioTJs).— 12 apples, sliced; stew to a pulp, 
beat fine and sweeten well. Add the juice of 1 lemon and part 
of the grated yellow rind. Beat the' whites of 6 eggs to a stiff 
ft-oth and whip in with the apples. (The lemon can be omitted.) 

CUSTAED. 

l^lpiuts of rich milk. 1 large cupful sng^V* 

4 egg yolks. 

Boil until it thickens. When perfectly cold pour over the 
iipples. They must be stiff to prevent rising in the custard. 
Lastly, whip ^ pint of rich cream perfectly light and lay over all» 
Oan be made without the cream. Delieious either way. 

Molded Apple. — Boil r pound of loaf sugar in 1 pint of 
Water five minutes. Add 2 pounds of tart apples prepared as for 
sauce. ' Let boil until the mixture grows thick. . Add the grated 
rind and the juice of 1 lemon, or flavor with lemon extract. Press 
into molds that have been dipped in cold water and not wiped. 
When the molded apple is turned out ornament by sticking 
blanched almonds over it. Pour whipped cream or soft custard 
around it. Compared with Apple Trifle, Molded Apple wiU be 
cheaper when eggs are scarce. 

Banana Dessert. — Slice bananas and pour over them whip- 
ped cream, sweetened and flavored with vanilla; 1 tablespoonful 
of gelatine dissolved in a little water and whipped into the cream 
gives some consistency. Serve with sponge cakci

Peach Dessert.^ — Slice peaches; leave a few hours in sngar; 
ecald and allow to cool. Make a thick sweet castard and turn 
over them when both are cold. The result will be a delicious 
dessert. 

Fmit Island. — Fill a glass dish half full of any fresh berries 
or sliced peaches. Put in layers with powdered sugar sprinkled 
between. Pour over them a hot-boiled' custard made in the pro- 
portion of 2 eggs and 4 tablespoonfuls of white sugar to 1 pint of 
sweet milk. 

Cupped Bice. — Mold plain boiled rice in teacups. Serve 
each person with 1 mold; set in a saucer with plain cold-boiled 
custard poured around it or cream and sugar. The effect is still 
better for a cupful of raisins to be cooked with the rice before it 
is molded. 

Cream Substitute. — A nice boiled custard may be served 
■with fresh berries and sliced peaches. Sweeten the berries to 
taste. Serve, and pass the cold custard in a crystal, or china 
pitcher around with them, allowing each guest to pour over the 
fruit as much of the custard as they wish. This is a very nice 
substitute for cream. 

Cheese Dish for Tea.— 

2 tablespoonfuls butter. 3 eggs. 

4 tablespoonfuls bread-crumbs. 

J pound cheese. 1 cupful sweet milk. 

Cut the butter and cheese in bits. Put in a bowl with the

well-beaten yolks and a pinch of salt. Mix, cover and place on 
the back of the stove, stirring until dissolved; then add the stiffly 
beaten whites of the eggs. Pour in a buttered pie-plate and bake 
in a quick oven for twenty minutes. Serve instantly. Mustard 
may be served with this. 

Welsh Rare-bit or Babbit. — Toast smooth thick slices of 
Ibtead evenly on both sides. Trim off the erust, lay a thin flat 
dUce of cheese on each slice of bread; set them in the oven in a 
dean dripping-pan until the cheese is thoroughly melted. Serve 
at once. 

Cheese Fondn.— Melt together over the Sre 1 tablespoonfol

of butter and 1 taMespoonful of £our. Stir nutil the mixture 
bubbles, adding a gill of rich milk or thin cream. When per- 
fectly smooth and thick, mix in gradually 3 heaping teaspoonf uls 
grated cheese, and season slightly with salt and Cayenne pepper. 
Turn into a cool dish and stir in the beaten yolks of 2 eggs. Whip 
the whites of S eggs to a stifE froth and add at the last moment, 
beating gently, not stirring, that they may not be broken down too 
much. Bake in the dish in which it is to appear at the table, 
buttering it well and leaving room for the f ondu to rise. A deli- 
cate golden brown over the whole surface is the signal to remove 
and serve. Have a quick oven. 

Potted Cheese. — Cheese that has grown dry or begun to 
mold can be turned into a very delicious compound by the foUow- 
iiig process : Eemove all the moldy portions ; if dry, grate it ; if 
not, pound smooth, add a wineglass of sherry, a teaspoonful of 
white sugar to each pound. When the whole is a smooth paste, 
press down tight in. small pots or jars and lay a paper dipped in 
brandy on the top, or else turn hot melted suet over it until the 
surface is completely covered; 1 tablespoonful of butter added to 
each pound of cheese, while rubbing smooth, wiU make the com- 
pound rich. This is very nice to spread over bread and butter, 
and will keep several years. It is much better for use when a year 
old than freshly made. £eep in a cool dry place. 

Cheese Tarts. — Cheese, grated and seasoned in the propor- 
tion of the yolk of 1 egg, J teaspoonful made mustard, ^ teaspoon- 
ful white sugar, 1 saltspoonful salt, and a dash of Cayenne pepper 
to 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of grated cheese may be baked in 
small patty-pans lined with puff -paste. Pill them half full. They 
will be lighter and puffier if the white of the egg is beaten 
stiff and stirred in just before filling into the patty-pans. Serve 
hot. 

Dutch Cheese or Cottage Cheese. — Set a pan of curded 

milk on the back of the stove and let heat slowly; boiling will 
toughen the curd. When the curd is separated from the whey 
take off, pour into a bag or piece of muslin and hang on a nail to 
drip until next day. Chop up the ball of curd and work smooth 
with salt, pepper and cream or butter to taste. Mix with the

for one-half day, tie in a finer cloth, rub powdered salt over the 
cloth, and hang up for a day or two. 

Lemon Syrup. — Put 3 pounds of white sugar in a preserving 
kettle. Cover with 1 quart of water. Boil until it is a clear

and 2 teaspoonfuls of oil of lemon. Bottle immediately. 

Orange Syrup.— ^Squeeze out the juice of fresh oranges ; to 
1 pLut of the juice put 1^ pounds of sugar. Set over a moderate 
fire. When the sugar has dissolved, drop in the peel of the 
oranges, and let boU slowly ten minutes. Strain through a flannel 
bag. Do not squeeze the bag or the jelly will not be clear. Bottle, 
cork and seal. Very nice to flavor puddings, etc. 

Lemon Syrup can be made in the same way only using IJ 
pounds sugar to 1 pint of lemon juice. Wring the flannel bag out 
of hot water before straining. 

Simple Syrup Used for Hot Cakes, etc.— ^ pint of water 
to each pound of sugar. When it is thoroughly dissolved set over 
a gentle fire and let boU half an hour. When clear and boiling 
hot, spread a wet napkin over a bowl and strain the syrup through.

removing any scum that may rise. Take from the fire, and when 
nearly cold, add 2 pounds more of bee honey, 1 teaspoonful essence 
peppermint, 2 teaspoonfuls extract rose. One-half the recipe is a 
good quantity. 

Lemon Honey. — 

Yolks of 6 eggs and whites of 2. 
Juice of 6 lemons, grated yellow rinds of 2. 
1 cupful of butter. 1 pound of lump sugar. 

Mix thoroughly and set the bowl containing the mixture in a 
sauce-pan of boiling water. Stir until it is of the consistency of 
honey. 

It will keep two weeks or more in a cool place, and is a very 
nice filling for layer cakes, tarts, or may be served with bread and 
butter for tea. 

Lemon Butter.— -Juice of 1 large lemon; dissolve in this 1 
large cupful of white sugar, stirring it continually over the fire and 
taking care not to burn. Then add 2 eggs beaten separately. As 
soon as the mixture becomes thick, remove from the stove. This 
can be used in the same manner as Lemon Honey.

Stir until cool, pour into a mold wet with cold water and set in a 
cool place. Serve plain or with cold cream sauce or plain sweet 
cream. Cherries, quinces, berries or any other kind of canned 
fruits can be made into a Cream Fruit Blanc-mange in the same 
manner; some, of course, requiring more sugar than others. 

Harlequin Blanc-mange. — A deep, small-sized, square brea5« 
pan can be used as a mold if a "brick" mold is not convenient. 
Put J pint of milk with a pinch of salt in a pail and set into a

and heap whipped cream aronnd it. Cream aud sngar may be 
substituted for this. 

Bird's Nest. — Make a plain blanc-mange, almost any variety; 
gelatine, com-starch, farina or any other. Empty 9 or 12 egg 
shells (save them up from cooking) by pouring the original con- 
tents through a small opening in the little end of the egg. Einse 
the interior oarefuUy in' cold water, then fill with the blanc-mange, 
while warm, and set in a pan of flour with the open end up that 
they may not be overturned. Next morning fill a large glass dish 
I full of any kind of jelly; 1^ pints wiU Tie needed. Break the 
shells from about the blanc-tnange and pile them upon the jelly 
(which should be warmed enough to mold in shape) as soon as it 
is firm enough to bear them. Cut narrow strips of orange or 
lemon peel and boil until tender in a syrup of sugar and water, ' 
Arrange these aronnd the eggs, warm the reserved l pint of jeUy 
so that it will run, not gettiug hot, and pour over the whole. This 
may be made without the jelly, simply pouring a boiled custard 
over all. A pretty dish for a children's' party, or a company -tea. 

Ivory Blanc-mange. — Soak 1 ounce of gelatine for ten minutes 
in a little cold milk, stirring constantly until it is dissolved, or the 
dish containing it may be set over a boiling tea-kettle for a few 
minutes. Eemove and add 1 small cupful sugar, and beat in 2 or 
3 tablespoonfuls apple jelly previously melted. This will give the 
ivory tint besides flavoring delicately. 

Snow Pyramids.— Beat the whites of 6 eggs to a stiff froth. 
Add 1 cupful of currant, or any other jelly, and whip together 
again. Fill the required number of saucers half full of cream, 
and drop in the center of each one a little pyramid of the whipped 
jelly and eggs. Whipped cream m9.y be- used instead of liquid 
cream in the sancers.

IGE Q^1^MM%^M^^3^^. 



ICE CEEAM. — This popular dainty is more easily prepared 
than housewives generally think. A patent freezer is not 
essential. A method for freezing can easily be arranged. 
A mixture of 6 quarts of pounded ice to 1 quart of rock salt 
placed in a tub or large paU ; place in this the dish containing the 
cream to be frozen ; keep it constantly in motion, at the same time 
stirring the cream. Have care to keep the ice well up around the 
dish and the cream wiU be soon ready to serve, i. e., if the quan- 
tity be small. After the method given above do not undertake to 
freeze more than 2 quarts at a time. 

Fob laegek quantities arrange the tub and pail as above, put- 
ting in the pounded ice and salt in layers and packing firmly about 
the inner vessel. Pour the custard or cream in, covering closely. 
Turn the pail for about five minutes, then open carefully and stir 
it well, removing all the congealed cream from the bottom and 
sides. Beat for five minutes; cover agaiu, pack ice and salt upon 
the lid; cover with several folds of blanket or carpet and leave an 
hour. Open again carefully, turn off brine, if necessary; scrape 
the cream from the sides and beat as before. Fill the tub with 
ice and salt, packing the same over the top of the f reeziBr. Cover 
with the blanket and leave it four . or five hours. Then pour off 
the brine, if necessary, and add ice and salt. When taken from 
the ice, wrap a towel wrung from hot water around the lower part 
of the freezer, ani turn out a solid column of smooth velvety 
cream. If not wanted for use at once empty the tub, set in the 
freezer and pack around with finely broken ice. If to be served 
in molds fill closely with the frozen cream, fasten securely and 
bury in ice and salt for an hour. Eemove, wipe off carefully, roll 

(374) 



IC^ CRBAM AND SHERBET. 375 

them for an instant in a towel wrung from very^, hot water and 
turn out. Serve at once. 

This method can only he employed where the foundation of 
the cream is made of a custard of milk and eggs. Where pure 
cream is used, and in some of the fancy creams, the freezer must 
be kept in almost constant motion and the cream beaten and 
stirred frequently, as in the fijst rule. Freezing twice is often 
resorted to in order to give the desired smoothness, even where 
molds are not used. Wash out the freezer and return the frozen 
cream. Pack in fresh ice and salt, and freeze one hour longer. 

Almost any flavoring essence may be used, and the cream or 
custard should be sweetened very sweet, as the process of freezing 
extracts much of the saccharine matter. 

< Dishes for Ioes. — Modern glass is miraculously tough, still 
now and then a dish will crack suddenly when filled with frozen 
cream. A good way to prevent this is to lay a piece of wet blot- 
ting paper in the dish about fifteen minutes before it is needed. 
Evaporation will soon cool it thoroughly, and ice or ice cream 
may be laid in it without danger. 

CocHiNEAi. coLOBiNG may be used for pink creams.

is: 1 gallon fresh milk. 2 pounds sugar. 

4 eggs, well-beaten. 1 tablespoonful lemon extract. 

Mix and freeze after the second method. Juice and grated 
rind of 2 lemons may be used instead of the extract. 

Vanilla Ice Cream. — Scald 1 quart milk with 1 sheet of isin- 
glass broken in bits and 1 vanilla bean. When cool, strain, mix 
with 1 pint of cream whipped to a froth. Sweeten with J pound 
of white sugar and freeze. If extracts are used for flavoring do

Ck)COa Shells. — 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of the shells to 1 
quart of boiling water. Boil twenty minutes. Serve with cream 
and sugar. 

GOPPRR. 

Coflfee. — 2 pounds of Java to 1 of Mocha is considered as 
furnishing the best coffee. The utmost care should be taken in 
browning coffee. Cool slowly, keeping the coffee from the air as 
much as possible. When partly cool, stir in a beaten egg and a 
small piece of butter. ,This serves to clarify the coffee in liquid. 
A pinch 6f salt, a bit of codfish skin, or a tablespoonful of cold water 
poured in just before serving will answer vie same purpose. Keep 
in tin box or a glass can closely covered. Coffee should be ground 
only as required for use. A coffee-mill attached to the wall i& 
much more convenient than one that must be held while using. 
The coffee-pot must be kept clean and bright. To ensure this it 
should be washed out carefully each .time after using. Boil it out, 
occasionally with a strong soap-suds, or a little baking-soda in 
pure water. If milk is used instead of cream, it should always be 
scalding hot. 

Java, Mocha and Eio in equal parts make a very good mixture 
for daily use. 

Coffee fob Festivals should be tied up in small bags with 
room to swell, not more than half a pound of coffee should be put 
in one bag. 

Coffee (Boiled). — 2 tablespoonfuls ground coffee to 1 pint of 
water. Put the required amount of coffee in the pot, pour a cupful 
of cold water over it and let steep. When the water in the tea-kettle 
boUs, add the necessary amount and let it boil quickly four or five 
minutes. Long boiling does not make coffee stronger, but destroys 
its color. Pour out half a cupful before serving to clear the strainer, 
and this turned back into the can from a little distance above it, 
will usually clear the liquid perfectly. The aroma will be retained 
by closing up the spout while the coffee is boiling. If coffee is to 
be decanted, scald out the silver coffee-pot, or heat the urn with 
the spirit lamp before using. 

Coffee (STE£:F£i>),~-Take the leqxuxeA amount of coffee, cover 



382 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

with cold water and set on the back of the stove. When the water 
in the tea-kettle boils, add half the desired quantity of liquid, let 
the coffee come to the boiling point, pour in the remainder of the 
water, return the coffee-pot to the back of the stove there to steep 
until ready to serve. Settle with crushed egg shells, cold water, 
etc. Sugar and cream should be put in the cup before the coffee 
is added. 

Coffee (Stkamed). — Put the required amount of coffee and 
water in the coffee-pot. Set this in a kettle of boiling water. Let 
it boil half an hour or longer. The coffee will need no settling, 
and will be clear as crystal; or, a tin inside may be made for the 
coffee-pot, after the style of a dripper, only without the perfora- 
tions and somewhat deeper. Put 3 or 4 inches of water in the 
coffee-pot. Hang the inner compartment inside, and in this put 
the coffee iand water. Let boil. This is one of the best ways 
known for preparing coffee, and also an economical one, as stronger 
coffee can be made from a less amount than in any other way. 

Coffee (Dripped). — Have a dripper made fitting in closely at 
the top of the coffee-pot and | as long. The bottom of the dripper 
should be finely perforated. Put the coffee in the dripper and pour 
into it the required amount of boiling water. Do this a few 
moments before serving. Keep hot on the stop's but do not allow 
to boil. A delicious and fragrant drink. 

Cafe-an-Lait. — This dainty M'ay of preparing coffee is very 
common in France. Prepare 1 quart of strong hot coffee in any 
preferred manner. Strain into a hot urn or coffee-pot. Add an 
equal amount of boiling milk. Cover closely with a thick cloth for 
five minutes before serving. Whip the whites of 3 eggs to a stiff 
froth. Sweeten to the taste, and put 1 large spoonful of this in 
each cup. Cafe-au-lait may be made without this last addition, 
simply using the hot coffee and milk and sweetening to taste. 

Meringned Coffee. — Make coffee after'anyjapproved formula. 
Put sugar and scalding milk in each cup and add the coffee. Have 
a meringue made by mixing the white of an egg, well beaten, with 
J pint of whipped cream. Lay a heaping spoonful on the top of 
«aeh cup before serving.

Whipped Ceeam. — 1 quart of milk set in a cool place twenty- 
four hours will yield cream sufficient, when well beaten, to furnish 
10 cupfuls of strong cofiee. 

Substitutes for Milk or Cream.— Beat up the whole of a 
fresh egg in a basin, and then pour boiling tea over it gradually, 
stirring constantly to prevent curdling. Use enough tea with the 
egg to make it the consistency of thick cream. This is the best 
substitute for cream known. Another way is to boil milk in a 
double boiler, or in a pail set in a kettle of boiling water. Boil 
until it thickens and grows rich. The beaten yolk Of an egg added 
to this makes it more creamy still. 

Kye Coffee. — Take l peck of rye; look over carefully. Cover 
with water and let steep or boil until the grain swells, then drain 
and dry. Eoast to a deep brown color, and prepare according to 
recipe for Boiled Coffee, allowing twice the time for boiling, or about 
half an hour. While boiling put in 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of molasses, 
this improves color and flavor. Serve with boiling hot mUk, and 
if more sweetening is necessary, add sugar at the table. This 
forms a very agreeable beverage, and will be found to agree with 
dyspeptics where coffee cannot be used. 

TRA. 

Tastes differ with regard to the flavor of tea. A good mixture 
in point of flavor is two-fifths black, two-fifths green, and one-fifth 
gunpowder. Tea retains its flavor better if kept in small tin 
canisters with closely-fitting covers. To impart a fine flavor to 
even ordinary tea, put a bit of soft paper in the canister with 1 
drop otto of roses upon it, for every pound of tea. 

In order to make a good cup of tea, M. Soyer claims that the 
tea-pot, with the requisite quantity of tea in it, should be put in the 
oven or over a spirit lamp to heat before adding the boiling water, 
though most housewives are content to scald the tea-pot with boiling 
water. Put in the tea in proportion of 1 tea;spo6nful for each per- 
son, if desired strong, otherwise less may be used. Pour on a 
cupful of freshly boiling water. Let stand five minutes to swell 
the leaves. Then fill up with the required amount of watet 



384 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

counting bj cupfuls untU the capacity of the tea-pot heeomeB 
familiar. Cover closely and let steep, not boil, five minutes longer. 
Ten or more minutes will be required for all black tea, or English 
breakfast tea. Be sure that the water is positively boiling when 
poured on. Do not let tea stand. This simply liberates the tan- 
nic acid in the tea, especially when a tin tea pot is used; an 
earthen one is far better. - If tin is used be sure it is kept bright. 
A French chemist recommends grinding tea like coffee, as it will 
yield nearly double the exhilarating qualities. 

Iced Tea. — Make as directed and set on ice, or simply put 
tne tea in cold water, observing the same proportions as for boiling. 
Do this in the morning and set on ice until evening. Serve in 
glasses. A little lemon-juice with plenty of loaf sugar added to 
tea prepared in this manner, makes a drink that will go far toward 
rendering life endurable during the heated term. 

loES Coffee may be prepared in the same manner. 



Lemonade. — Grate the, yellow rind from the lemon. Eoll 
the lemons until soft, peel off the bitter white rind, cut in two and 
squeeze in a lemon-squeezer. Drop the pulp and grated rind into 
the pitcher with the juice. One large lemon or two small ones, will 
make 4 glasses of lemonade. Stir 3 or 4 tablespoonf uls of sugar 
with the juice. Then pour in 4 glasses of water. Stir all together 
and set aside for half an hour on ice, if possible, if not, set in a 
cool place. It is nicer strained before serving, and to add still 
more to its appearance, a slice of fresh lemon may be put in each 
"lass. 

Portable Lemonade.— 

1 ounce of tartaric or citric acid. 
J pound finely powdered loaf-sugar. 
20 drops of essence of lemon. 

Powder the acid and mix thoroughly with the sugar; 2 or 3 
ieaspoonfuls of this in a glass of water makes a very pleasant 
lemonade. For another metliod fiee hints for cake making. 



TABLE DRINKS. 385 

Orangeade. — Bhred the peel of 4 oranges very fine, boil ten 
minates in 1 quart of -water to which add ^ pound of sugar. When 
cold mix J pint of orange juice, to which the juice of 1 lemon has 
been added, with the syrup. Strain through muslin, and the 
orangeade wUl be ready to serve. More or less sugar may be used 
according as the fruit is sweet or otherwise. If the beverage is 
required for children less juice can be used. 

Strawberry Sherbet. — 
l^- quarts of berries. 

1 large lemon. ' 2 teaspoonfnls orange- water. 

3 pints of water. f pound sugar. 

Crush the berries into a bowl, squeeze in the lemon juice. 
Pour the water over this and let stand several hours. Strain, add 
the sugar and 600I on ice before serving. 

Boston Gream Nectar.— 5 quarts of water boiled with i 
pounds of granulated sugar. Let it boil briskly. When cool add 
4 ounces of tartaric acid, and 2 tablespoonfuls of essence of lemon. 
When perfectly cool stir in the whites of 6 eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth and bottle the mixture for use. 8 tablespoonfuls of the cream 
are sufficient for a glass of water. Add a pinch of bi-carbonate of 
soda to each glass to make it foam. Put the soda in the water 
first. Drink at once. 

Summer Chocolate. — Grind up chocolate perfectly fine. 
Add to it an equal amount of powdered white sugar and some pure 
cream, when it is ready for use with the addition of ice-water. Put 
)a portion of this in glasses and fill up with water. 

HOML© BEVERAGES. 

/ 

Raspberry Yinegar. — ^Pill a stone jar with ripe berries and 
cover with pure cider vinegar. Let stand five days and strain 
through a coarse cloth. To each pint of this juice add 1 pound of 
white sugar and boil until the sugar is dissolved. (Boil about five 
minutes after it conjes to the boiling point.) If boiled too long it 
is apt to jelly. Skim, bottle and seal. Stir 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls 
of this into a glass of ice-water. A delicious summer drink.

Sweet Cider (To Keep). — ^Let sweet cider be heated carefully 
up to boiling point. Skim and seal up. 

Mulled Cider. — l quart of boUing cider. Beat 2 eggs very 
light with enough sugar to sweeten plentifully. Pour the boiling 
cider over the eggs, stir and pour from one vessel to another until 
it foams. Serve warm. 

Keumiss, or Milk Beer.— 

1 quart of new milk. 1 gill of fresh buttermilk. 

3 or 4 lumps or white sugar. 
Mix until the sugar dissolves. Let stand in a warm place 
ten hours when it will have thickened; then pour from one vessel 
to another uniil it is smooth and thick. Bottle and keep in a warm 
place twenty-four hours — in winter it may take thirty-six hours. 
Cork the bottles tight; tie the corks down. Shake for a few 
minutes before using. 1 teaspoonfnl of yeast may be used instead 
of the buttermilk. The milk should be unskimmed. This agree- 
able beverage is recommended for a delicate stomach, as aiding in 
the assimilation of food ; it is also healthful for young children. 
Cream Ginger Beer. — 

1^ ounces root ginger, bruised; put in a preservin" bottle, 

and add 
3 lemons, sliced. 1 handful hops. 

2 quarts of cold water. 
Let the mixture boil slowly two houre. Put in a large jar— 
8 pounds sugar. 1 ounce cream-tartar. 

10 querts lukewarm water. 1 cupful yeast. 
Whites of 6 eggs. 
Pour the boiling hot liquid over this and let stand a day or 
two before bottling; fasten the corks securely with strings. A 
healthy drink. 

Boot and Bark Beer. — Gather a half bushel basket of 
spruce boughs, sassafras roots, sarsaparilla roots, sweet fern, winter 
green leaves, black birch bark, black cherry bark, dandelion and 
dock roots. Boil in 6 gallons of water with a large handful of 
hops and a quart of wheat bran. Strain through a sieve, turn in 
8 quarts of molasses, and, if very strong, add a gallon or two of 
odd water. When cool put in i pint yeast and when it begins to

1^ quarts water. 
1 teaspoonful ginger. 
Keep cool as possible. 

Raspberry, Strawberry, Currant or Orange Effervescii^ 
Draughts. — Take 1 quart of the juice of either of the above 
fruits; strain and boil into a syrup with 1 pound of loaf sugar. 
To this add 1^ ounces of tartaric acid. When cold bottle and 
keep well corked. To use, fill a one-half pint tumbler three parts 
full of water and add 2 tablespoonfuls of the syrup. Stir in 
briskly ^ teaspoonful bi-carbonate of soda, and a very delicious 
drink wUl be formed.

KRKSH AND CANNKD. 

BEUITS may be served singly or together as an ornamental 
center dish. 
Apples, peaks and peaches should be well rubbed with 
a clean, coarse cloth before serving. All bruised and defective 
fruit should be carefully picked out. 

Grapes should be carefully selected and all the defective ones 
picked from the stem. .Much taste and artistic skill may be displayed 
in arranging these fruits for the table. The tired housewife will 
find them a pleasing, healthful substitute for the carefully pre- 
pared dessert, while at the same time they are indispensable to the 
costly meal of many courses. 

To Keep Fresh Geapes. — Take fuU, perfect clusters; remove 
all unsound and unripe grapes. Spread out for a few days ia an 
empty room and then pack in layers in a dry, empty box, alter- 
nating with a layer of white paper; blank newspaper is best. 
There should not be more than four layers in one box. Some 
prefer cut straw in which to pack grapes. Others dip the end of 
the stem of each bunch in melted sealing-wax, wrap the bunches 
in tissue paper separately, and pack in layers with paper as before 
mentioned. If the precautions mentioned first are observed, there 
will be no difficulty in preserving grapes from October to May by 
any of these methods. Keep the box or boxes in a cool dry place. 

Obanges (To Ohoose), — Choose oranges by weight; the heaviest 
are the best; they have the thinnest skin and more weight of juice. 
Thick -jkinned oranges are apt to be dry, and always weigh less 

— (388) 



FRUITS. 389

according io their size. The sweetest and richest orange will be 
found among the rusty-coated. The Jamaica and Havana oranges 
are a pale yellow, and the juice of a more acid quality than the 
home-grown fruit. 

Oranges (To Seeve). — Cut the peel of the orange in six sec- 
tions; turn half-way down the fruit. In this way they are orna- 
mental as well as a most acceptable dessert. Oranges and grapes 
arranged together give a pleasing effect. 

Eananas. — Bananas are very nutritious. 1 pound of this 
fruit contains, it is said, more nutriment than 3 pounds of meat 
or many pounds of potatoes. There are many ways of serving 
them. 

FiBST. — Slice the bananas and serve with cream and sugar. 

SEOOND.-^Slice, sprinkle with powdered sugar, and, befora it 
dissolves, squeeze the juice of one or more oranges over them. 
Set on ice. 

Third. — Serve whole, alone or with other fruits. 

FouBTH.-'— Alternate layers of peeled and sliced oranges (cut 
the oranges in circular slices) with layers of sliced bananas, 
sprinkling each layer with powdered sugar. Set on ice, if possible, 
before serving. 

FRESH FRUITS. 

Ambrosia. — 

10 oranges, peeled and sliced in circular slices. 
1 cocoanut, grated. 1 pine-apple, sliced. 

Arrange the oranges and pine-apple in alternate slices, sprink- 
ling each layer with powdered sugar and grated cocoanut. Keep 
cool as possible before serving. This dish can be made without 
the pine-apple. 

Pine-apple. — Cut in dice; sprinkle thickly with sugar some- 
time before serving, that it may penetrate the fruit. Pile loosely 
in a glass dish with a circle of maccaroons or lady-fingers around 
the edge of the dish. 

Peaches. — Pare, slice and sprinkle with powdered sugar; do 
this just before serving. Send the cream around with the fruit. 
Set in a refrigerator until thoroughly chilled, if convenient. Before 



390 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

sending to the table sprinkle over a little more sugar. Canned 
peaches may be chilled on ice and served in the same fashion. 

Cocoanat Snow. — 1 cocoanut, grated; leave out the brown 
skin. Heap lightly in the center of an ornamental dish. Deco- 
rate the edge of the dish with smilax or some other pretty leaf, or 
vine. Serve in small dishes, putting two or three spoonfuls of 
whipped cream over each dish. Flavor the cream with rose-water, 
2 tablespoonfuls to a pint of the cream. The cocoanut may be 
served without the cream. 

Strawberries^ — Fibst. — Pick over carefully; never wash un- 
less absolutely necessary, and then only a few at a time, hulling 
afterward. Sprinkle liberally with sugar some time before serving. 
Sweet cream with this fruit is delicious. 

SEOOND.-^Place a layer of berries in a glass dish; sift fine loaf 
sugar over them, then another layer of fruit, and again -sugar, until 
the dish is filled. Add to the dish the juice of a fresh lemon. Before 
serving let them be gently stirred. A delicious dish. 

Raspberries and Blackberries. — Look over carefully and 
serve plain, with sugar and cream. 

Water-melon Tea Dish. — Take a fully ripe water-melon, put 
on ice until thoroughly cold; slice, remove seeds and cut the red 
pulp in any shape preferred. Put a layer into a glass dish; sprin- 
kle with granulated sugar; alternate melon and sugar until the 
dish is filled. Set on ice, if possible, until it is ready to serve. 
Dish out same as any other fruit. Very nice. 

Water-melons served plain should be kept on ice until wanted. 
Cut in circular slices, leaving in the rind. 

Mnsk-melon. — Cut in sections, from the stem downward, fol- 
lowing the natural division of the melon. Bemove the seeds. 
Pepper, salt and sugar are used with this fruit at pleasure. 

Melons may be taken as the first course at breakfast, or used 
as a dessert. If the skin breaks easily from a melon, this may be 
observed as an indication of ripeness. If the blossom end of a 
musk-melon is soft and elastic to the touch, there is a certainty of 
its ripeness. 

Substitute for Cream.— Pounded ice is an agreeable addi- 
tion to a saucer of strawberries, raspberries, etc. Pound in a 



FRUITS. 391 

stout cloth nntil it is almost as fine as snow and spread it over the 
berries. Tbis is an excellent substitute for cream. 

Sliced Tomatoes. — Peel and slice the tomatoes. Sprinkle 
over them finely pulverized white sugar, then add sufficient diluted 
cider vinegar to cover them, or serve with cream and sugar in the 
same manner as peaches. Vinegar, salt and pepper are preferred 
by some. 

FROSTED FRUITS. 

Grapes, — Select the clusters carefully. Eemove any that are 
imperfect. Close bunches are better. Immerse the grapes in the 
strained, slightly beaten, whites of eggs. Tie a string to the stem 
of each cluster. Drain them partially. Roll in powdered white 
sugar until no more will adhere. Sprinkle in between the grapes. 
Hang the bunches up by the strings to dry in the sun if possible. 
A very ornamental dish for a party. Arrange on a glass stand or 
fruit dish. If on a stand, set a tall slender vase in the center with 
bright fiowers, and heap the grapes around the base of it. The 
effect is very pretty, if the frosted grapes are mixed with the purple 
fruit in its natural state. 

Peaches. — The whites of 8 eggs, beaten to a froth, will be 
needed for 12 peaches. Rub smooth, and remove the pits carefully. 
To do this they must be very ripe. Dip the fruit in the egg, and 
then roll thoroughly in white sugar, powdered. Dry in the sun. 
When partly dry fill the cavities with sugar. Eoll again in pow- 
dered sugar and finish drying. 

Oranges. — Peel the fruit and divide at the natural partings. 
Dip in beaten egg. Eoll in powdered sugar and dry in the sun. 

Small Fmits, — Take Cherries, .clusters of currants, plums, etc. 
Dip first in beaten egg, then roll in powdered white sugar, and dry 
on sheets of white paper in the sun, or a very moderate oven. 

Apples. — Pare and core juicy apples. Fill with sugar. Bake 
until nearly done. Cool. Drain and remove the fruit into another 
dish, and frost carefully with frosting spread over the top and sides. 
Make the frosting as for cake. 

Crystallized Fruits. — Boil 1 cup of granulated sugar with 
1 cup of water for half an hour. The water should be boiling 



392 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

when poured on the sugar. Do not stir it. Count the time from 
the moment boiling begins. Try the syrup in water. If the 
thread is brittle the syrup is ready, if not, boil a few moments 
longer. It must boU slowly. When done set the saucepan in a 
pan of boiling water to keep the syrup from candying. Pit 
cherries and divide oranges at the natural partings. English 
walnuts are nice prepared in this way, other nuts also. Take the 
prepared fruit on the point of a large needle. Dip in the syrup, 
and lay on a buttered dish to dry. They may be allowed to dry 
and then dipped again if wished. Very nice. 

Candied Fruits. — Make a syrup of 1 pound of sugar and J^ 
cup of hot water. Have it in a broad, low preserving kettle, and pre- 
pare one layer of fruit at a time. Pare and halve peaches, plums 
and pears. Eemove the pits from cherries. Use the large variety. 
Drop them into the syrup and cook slowly until clear. Drain on a 
skimmer. Lay on plates and dry in the heating oven. In twenty- 
four hours they will be ready to pack away in a jar. Each kind of 
fruit must be candied by itself in a fresh syrup. What little syrup 
remains over from each can be kept to flavor puddings and sauces. 
Serve at a dinner party between the ice-cream and coffee. Arrange 
as larger a vairiety of them as possible in a glass dish, each guest 
helping himself. When packing them sprinkle sugar between the 
layers. 

CANNED FRUITS. 

Cans or jars for canning fruit should be of either glass or 
stoneware. The acids of many fruits acting upon tin forms a 
very unwholesome, if not positively injurious compound. 

Canned fruits in glass may be wrapped in paper to prevent 
fading. Where it is possible the new amber glass cans will be 
found a perfect preservative against the light. 

Two-QUAKT cans or jars should only be used in large families; 
one quart and one pint cans are better for small families, as 
canned fruit does not retain its freshness long after being opened. 

Bottles may be used for small fruit or for catsups. These, 
and cand whose tops are worn out or lost, narrow- mouthed jars or 
jugs, may be used by sealing after the fruit is placed in them. 



FRUITS. 393 

Methods of Sbamng.— Scald the fruit thoroughly and have 
ready three or four pieces of thin tough paper (tea paper is nice). 
Gut to fit the jars and large enough to turn over the rim. Dip 
each one -in a saucer containing the white of egg. Press on 
quickly and tie down; add two or three more pieces after a time; 
wet in the same way on the under side ; , tie these down. Let dry 
and you will have an air-tight covering for the fruit, preferred by 
many to the self-sealing tops. Be particular that the jars finished 
in this manner are kept in a dry place, that the paper may not mold. 

Sealing Wax (Second). — 1 pound resin, 1 ounce each of lard 
tallow and beeswax. Melt these ingredients together. Put the 
cork in very tight and cover over with the mixture. If necessary, 
dip a cloth in the mixture and tie firmly over the cork. 

In opening a tin can of fruit pour out the contents immediately. 
Leave exposed to the air in an open dish for some little time before 
using, and if any remains over put away in an earthen dish. 

Set cans or jelly glasses on a folded towel wet in cold water, 
and pour in the boiling fruit without fear of breakage. A silvej 
tablespoon put in a jar while filling will answer the same purpose. 
To drop a teaspoon in a jelly glass is especially convenient. 

Cans that refuse to open will usually yield to a cloth wrung 
from hot water and folded around the top. If not, set the can 
with the top downward in an inch or so of boiling water. See 
that it does not touch the glass. Or run knife under rubber. 

Edbbek rings that have hardened, may be dropped for one-half 
hour in a solution of one-third water and two-thirds ammonia, to 
soften. 

PoBCELAiN-LiNED kcttles are the safest to use. Perfectly new 
granite ironware with none of the glaze worn off is also nice. 
For fine fruit, nothing but porcelain Or bell-metal kettle should 
ever be used. Bell-metal, or brass, should be very dB)refully em- 
ployed. Scour with sand before using. Scald with salt and vine- 
gar, rinse out and wipe. After using, wash at once. Do not 
allow the fruit to stand in the kettle to cool. The result can not 
fail to be dangerous. 

Pin should never be used for canning or preserving, as it 
turns the fruit dark-colored. i 



394

Eaethen-waee jars used for canning should always be thor 
oughly glazed, otherwise they will not be air-tight and the fruii 
will spoil. 

To TEST fruits or vegetables put, up in tin cans ap^y th« 
thumbs to both ends of the cans; if it resists pressure, the con- 
tents are well preserved. 

Juice left from canning fruit may be sealed hot in small bot- 
tles to use for fruit puddiilgs, sauces, etc. 

CANNING. 
A GOGS GEMEBAi. rule in canning fruit is to use 1 pound oi 
sugar to i pounds of fruit, and barely enough water to keep from 
burning when first put over. To be more exact, the following 
proportions are given with time for boiling:

CO*5DENSEE) CANNING. 

P40K the cans full of fruit. Screw the covers on lightly, and 
_ stand each can on a little block of wood placed in the bottom of 
the boiler. Pill as many cans as wUl stand in the boiler. Put 
sugar enough in each one to sweeten for the table. Fill the boiler 
with cold water nearly to the top of the cans. Boil twenty or 
twenty-five minutes. When the fruit will be found to have settled 



FRUITS. 395 

somewhat, remove part of the cans ; open and take one to fill np 
the others. Screw tightly and proceed in the same way until all 
are filled. It will take about 3 Out of 12 to fill those that have 
settled. Let stand all night and tighten the covers in the morning. 
It is better not to put the rubber rings on the cans until after they 
have been boiled and re-filled. There is no danger of breakage in 
this way, and the cans are almost solid fruits, thus gaining in 
space. In preparing, for the table they can be diluted with hot 
water to the desired consistency and sweetened to taste, or served 
as they are. Some cook-books advocate canning without sugar, 
but fruit is never quite as nice prepared in this way, and it should 
be sweetened partially, at least, when first canned. 

Peas, beans and tomatoes are excellent canned in the same 
way; corn also. Fill the cans as for fruit, omitting sugar. Boil 
the same way until they are sufficiently cooked; fill each can with 
hot water. Screw down tight and set away. Some housekeepers 
prefer to cook the vegetables ten or fifteen minutes, then fill the 
cans and finish cooking. Canned in this manner, fruits will not 
lose fiavor as in the usual way. Small fruits of all description 
may be canned in this manner. 

Canned Fruit (II) . — Fill the jars with the raw fruits and 
put them in a boiler as above. Let cook until half done, and then 
open the cans and fill up with a nice syrup made of sugar and 
water. Have this boiling hot when poured over the fruit. Screw 
up the cans and set away. By having the syrup very rich a deli- 
cious preserve may be had, and the fruit has the added advantage 
of looking fresh and nice instead of becoming a pulpy mass. 
Always try the cans after setting away. New cans sometimes 
need to be tried more than once. Other methods of canning fruits 
are also given. 

Grapes, (To Can).— ^Press the pulp from the skin. Save the 
skins. Put the pulps in a porcelain kettle with a very little water. 
Boil until the seeds begin to separate. Then rub through a coarse 
sieve held over a large pan, using the back of a wooden spoon. 
Put the pulp and skins back in the kettle; sweeten to taste and 
can, sealing up hot. 

Fears, (To Can).— Peel the pears, cut in halves or leave whole 



396 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

as preferred. Throw into cold water as they are pared, to keep 
them from blackening. Put a steamer with a plate inside over 
boiling water. Pile the plate with pears and steam until a straw 
can be run through them easily. While they are steaming, make 
a syrup in the proportions of 1 large cupful of sugar, to 1 pint of 
water. When done fill the cans with fruit. Pour in syrup until 
the cans are full and seal. 

Peaches, (To Can). — Peel, halve, remove pits and steam as 
directed for pears. Prepare the syrup the same, cover the fruit 
with it and seal up as above. Peaches may be pared more easily 
by pouring boiling water over them, turning it off instantly and 
covering them with cold water. This will simplify the matter, but 
can only be used where the fruit is firm. A few peach kernels in 
each can improves the flavor. 

Elderberries, (To Can). — To 7 pounds of the berries, add 3 
pounds of sugar and 1 pint of good vinegar. Stew and can. Keep 
in a cool place. Nice for pies or sauce. The juice of wild grapes 
can be thoroughly scalded and used instead of vinegar. Nice for 
pies or sauce. 

Apples and Raisins, (To Can).^— Make a nice sauce from 
tart-apples, cook quite smooth. Bell Flowers are the best. This 
is a nice way to keep them when they begin to spoil. To each 
can of this sauce add 1 or 1 J cupfuls nice raisins. Put in when 
the fruit first begins to cook. This adds both to flavor aod appmc> 
ance. Or make a nice sauce and ban without raisins. 

Pie Plant (To Can). — Cut in smalj pieces, sweeten trtll Mli 
stew until tender, as for sauce. Fill the cans. Seal. 

Flams (To Can).— Pack quart cans compactly with frait» 
fill up with cold water and put on the covers lightly. Set the cans 
in cold water. Let this boil ten minutes. Screw on the covers 
while the jars are hot, and set away in a cool, dark place. Add 
sugar when used. If for sauce stew until done. 

Cherries for Winter Use. — Take fresh ripe cherries, re- 
move the stems and put them into wide-mouthed bottles, filling 
nearly full. Then pour in New Orleans molasses to cover com- 
pletely; fasten up the bottles with two or three thicknesses of egg- 
paper, driving in first a dosely-fitting cork, as it will be oecessaiy 



FRUITS. 397 

to shake them occasionally in order to mix the contents well. 
Some of the molasses will be absorbed by the cherries which will 
render them sufficiently agreeable to be made into puddings or pies 
without the addition of further sweetening. Any of the molasses 
remaining in the jar will be found pleasantly flavored, so that the 
addition of some of it to a glass of water forms a refreshing drink. 

Wild Grapes, for Winter Use. — ^Pick the grapes from the 
stem; fill into a jar and cover with New Orleans molasses. Nice 
for winter pies. 

Strawberries (To Can). — All berries are canned after much 
the same fashion. Either use one or the other of the two rules 
given at the beginning or this division, or proceed as follows: 

Put the berries in a porcelain kettle. Heat slowly; as they 
commence boiling add sugar according to the table given at begin- 
ning of this chapter. If strawberries', boil eight or ten minutes 
before putting in the sugar; dip out any extra juice. Can hot, and 
seal at once. 

Tomatoes (To Can). — Pour boiling water over the tomatoes 
to loosen the skin. Peel, crush each tomato in the hand; this 
wrings out the juice in a way that cannot be, accomplished by 
slicing. When enough are prepared, let them stand awhile and 
pour off the accumulated juice ; press a plate on them and pour 
off the remainder of the juice. Let them boil up several times 
in the preserving-kettle; skim and can. Stone jars, jugs and glass 
cans may be used. Some prefer to season them slightly with salt 
before canning. 

To serve tomatoes prepared in this way, all that is necessary 
is to heat them sufficiently to melt the butter. Thicken slightly 
with broken crackers, toast or stale bread. Tighten the can- 
covers before putting away, and wrap glass cans in paper to pre- 
vent fading. 

Pumpkin (To Can). — Steam the pumpkin, first slicing and 
removing seeds; leave in the shell. When done, scrape from the 
shell. Mash, fill into cans, hot, being careful that no air bubbles 
remain in filling the can. Seal up. It can be prepared for pies 
the same as fresh pumpkin, from which it cannot be told. Instead 
of steaming, it may be baked and scraped from the shdl. 



398 THREE MEALS A DAY, 

Canning without Cooking.— 

6 ounces of sugar. 

86 grains salicylic acid (this can be bought at any drug 

store and is perfectly harmless). 

Dissolve the acid in 1 cupful quite warm water. Pack 12^ 

qnarts of fruit tightly in a jar; pour the water and acid over; tie 

the cover down tightly. The fruit will be fresh as when first 

gathered. Sweeten to taste. 

Canning Corn. — Cut the corn from the cob; scrape the cob 
and can according to the first rule for condensed canning. 

This will be found an extra way. The corn will be so solid in 
the can that it will have to be loosened with a spoon, and will only 
need cooking sufficiently to heat the butter and other seasoning. 

FRUIT SAUCE. 

Eabthen obooks or porcelain-lined kettles, are the best in 
which to cook all kinds of fruit, preserves, jellies, marmalades, 
jams, etc. Water boiled in a new crock several times will harden 
the glaze. Put in cold and let it come to a boiling point gradually. 

A COMPOTE of fruit is about half as rich as preserves . 

Apples, if of the right flavor, are excellent with the use of 
sugar alone. Some apples are improved by mixing with apricots, 
or quinces. Oare should be taken in cooking. Apple marmalade 
is improved by the addition of lemon juice. Ground cinnamon, 
nutmeg and the grated rind of a lemon are the usual flavors. 
Butter gives a rich flavor to hbt apple sauce. Sugar should be 
cooked in with the boiling sauce and some added when cold. 
Cream may be served with boiled apples. Care should be taken to 
have the knife very bright with which apples are pared. Let the 
paring be done quickly as possible. Do this to avoid the blacken- 
ing which takes place if the fruit is too long in contact with the 
steel blade. 

By putting a little cooking soda in with rhubarb or goossber- 
ries, while cooking, sugar will be saved. 

Fbuits, if over-ripe, must be cooked but little and taken from 
the fire the moment they are done; a trifle underdone is better 



FRUITS. 390 

than cooked too much. All green or unripe fruits are improva? 
by starting them in oold water, and cooking or simmering slowif 
(without stirring), for a long time. The long, slow cooking makes 
the fruit taste sweeter and riper. 

Potted Apples. — Pare the apples. Core. Cut into quarters 
or eighths and put into a small jar in layers. Sprinkle sugar over 
each layer and add to each two or three bits of butter. Fill almost 
to the top. Add J cupful water to a half gallon jar. Tie the top 
down and bak6 in a slow oven two hours or more. This makes a 
delicious dessert served with sweetened cream, or without. 

Jellied Apples. — Arrange sliced apples in a pudding dish, as 
above, omitting the butter and water. Cover with a plate that slips 
inside the rim of the dish and fits down tightly upon the apples. 
Bake in a very moderate oven three to four hours. The sliced 
apples will be found covered and surrounded with a clear jeUy. 
Turn over onto a dish, and if the apples were good, it will remain 
in form. Ni'ce for dessert. Leave in the dish until perfectly cold 
before turning out. If prepared the day before it is wanted the 
result will be better. Serve with or without cream. 

Apple Compote. — Fill a jar with mellow apples. Pare a^d 
core them first. Squeeze in the juice of ^ lemon, and throw 1. 
cupfuls sugar over them. Cover closely. Tie down and keep 11,., 
moderate oven from four to five hours. Nice either hot or cold. 

Spiced Apples. — Take 2 dozen nice cooking apples, pare sss' 
core them, quarter and put in a porcelain kettle or an eartfec 

crock. Add enough water to come half way up on the apples, a- 

J pound sugar, J cupful vinegar and 1 tablespoonful ground cinna- 
mon. Throw in 6 or 7 whole cloves, and a little grated nutmeg, if 
convenient, say ^ of one. Cover and simmer over a slow fire until 
thoroughly tender. 

Boiled Apples. — Select perfect apples, a pleasant tart. Wipe 
dry. Leave on the peeling. Put in a sauce pan and partly cover 
with water. Sweeten to the taste. Cook until the apples are 
thoroughly tender. Do not let them break much. Take the apples 
out when done. Put in a dish. Cook the syrup. Sweeten more, 
if necessary, and pour over the apples. The core and ekin give a 
different flavor to the sauce. 



40O THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Baked Apples -^Bake tart apples in a bread tin. Eemove 
when done. If left in the oven too long they become dry and lose 
flavor. A little water may be added in baking sweet apples. If 
sweet apples are used they are very nice to eat with milk. If 
the apples are tart, sprinkle sugar over them in the tin. Evea 
imperfect apples may be baked by quartering and removing the 
cores. Fill closely in the pan. Pour in a little water. Sprinkle 
with sugar, and bake. Some prefer this to stewed apples. Leave 
the peel on. 

Baked Sweet Apples. — Peel carefully. Put in a pan. Covei 
closely with a lid, or another pan. Add a cupful of water and bake 
until tender. Eemove the apples and put in a jar or bowl with a 
cover, and keep warm. Add a cupful of sugar for each cupful of 
the apple juice, and boil fast until it is a thick syrup. Do not stir. 
Add as many cloves as there are apples, and pour hot over the 
fruit in the jar. Set away, covered, until \,he next day. Turn out 
in a dish and serve. It ought to be a perfect mold. Very nice. 
Cream may be served with it. 

Cider Apple Sauce. — 

^ bushel sweet apples. 4 pounds of sugar. 

A few quinces. 

Put in sweet cider enough to cover the apples. Boil and 
skim for four or five hours. This is superior to the old-fashioned 
boiled cider apple sauce, made of cider that has been boiled down 
separately. 

The quinces may oe omitted, and some tastes would prefer 
little or no sugar. Of course the cider can be boiled down before- 
hand if liked. 

Dried Apple Sauce. — Dried apples cook a little easier by 
being soaked over night, but they can be cooked without by putting 
in a crock and setting on the back of the stove at first. They need 
four or five hours cooking. Considerable water should be put on 
at first, and ,more hot water added as required. They are much 
improved by J pound currants (Zante), or J pound raisins, to each 
pound of apples, A few slices of fresh lemon improves the flavor. 
Sweeten well. 

Evaporated Apples.—The flavor of these is quite like the 



FRUITS, 401 

fresh frnit, by oooMng with a little lemon juice in the water. Soak 
in cold "Water over night. Btew in plenty of water in a clish closely 
covered. Let the surplus be nearly if not quite evaporated. 
Sweeten to the taste with white sugar. 

Apple Sance.— Peel and slice the apples. Partly cover with 
water and stew until smooth as possible. Beat with a spoon until 
perfectly smooth. Use tart apples, and add a very little hot water 
if any more is necessary while cooking. Sweeten to the taste. 
Flavor with lemon juice or lemon peel. 

Apple Sauce with Jelly. — Make sauc? as above, using very 
nice apples, sweeten with white sugar, bea»j perfectly smooth. 
Serve with spoonfuls of bright colored jelly laid over the top. In 
serving, put a pieee of jelly on ea«h sauce-dish. This with plain 
cake for a light dessert is nice. 

Stewed Apples.— Quarter and core the apples, put over with 
sugar, a tablespoonful of butter and a sprinkle of flour* Add 
water to partly cover. Let them cook quite dry before serving. 

A Delicious Dish of Apples.— Bake sweet apples and pour 
over them sweet cream, flavored with lemon, vanilla, or nutmeg. 
Sugar with cream to taste. 

Fried Apples, — ^Take smooth-skinned, fair apples. Wash 
and wipe them, slice in round slices and fry in hot pork drippings 
or sausage gravy. Serve with sausage or stea.k and keep the slices 
perfect as possible ; or take mellow tart-apples, peel, core and 
slice. Put in a sauce pan with a lump of butter and. cook uQia^ a 
pulp. Serve hot, allowing each person to sweeten according to. 
taste. 

Stewed Quinces. — Pare and cut in quarters, remove cores 
and put in a stew-pan with half enough water to cover them. Let 
boil tender, keeping the pan closely covered. Add J pound of 
sugar to each pound of cut quinces, and let them stew, still doaely 
covered until the syrup is thick. This may be made ^ sweet 
apples. 

Baked Quinces. — Take whole ripe quinces and bake with 
the skins on. When done thoroughly, remove the skins. Sift 
over plenty of sugar, and a lump of butter on each. Serve hot; 
or omit the butter and use cream instead, in which case serve 



402 THRBB MEALS A DAT. 

either hot or cold. Baking entirely removes the strong taste of 
the 6[aiBce, leading only a delicate flavor in its plaoe. An appetiz- 
ing dish. 

Dried Berries, (To Stew). — 2 oupfuls of berries to 4 eups 
of oold water, let boU slowly thirty minutes. Sweeten to suit the 
taste. Baspberries, blackberries, currants, etc., are susceptible to 
the same rule. 

Cranberry Sauce.— Wash and pick over 1 quart of cranber- 
ries, put in a porcelain kettle or a bright sauce pan. Spread 2 
> onpfuls of sugar over them, pour in 1 small cup of cold water. 
Cover and simmer at the back of the stove one-half hour. Never 
stir until taken from the stove. They bum easily and should not 
be kept in a hot place. Never cook cranberries before patting 
in the sugar. Graduate the sugar according to the required rich- 
ness. 

Jellied Cranberries, (Fob 3ame,) — ^Piok over and cook in 
the proportions of 1 pouad of berries, to 1 pound of granulated 
sugar and J pint of cold water. Put the water, and sugar on the 
range to boil, stirring constantly. When boiling throw in the 
berries, they will soon heat through and begin to burst. Stir fre- 
quentiy until well cooked. It will take ten or fifteen minutes after 
they begin to boil. Turn in a mold, that has been previously 
rinsed in cold water and not dried, and let stand until the next 
day. The above recipe makes cranberries neither too acid nor too 
sweet ; will invariably turn out like jelly, and is very nice to serve 
with game or poultry, as the whole berry is preserved. As many 
as ten pounds can be prepared at once, and will keep perfectly by 
putting in bowls and pasting over with paper dipped in egg. 

Baby Sauce, (Cbanbbeey). — 1 quart of cranberries and 2 
quarts of cold water. Put in a porcelain kettle or a stone crook. 
Cover closely. Boil twenty minutes over a hot fire. Remove from 
stove, add sugar until tlie juice is sweet, and then put in all the 
apples pared, cored and quartered, that the juice will cover. Stew 
moderately until the apples are tender but not broken, and have 
absorbed the juice until they are ruby colored. This sauce is deli- 
cious, inexpensive, excellent for tarts or pies, and keeps well. 

Baked Bhubarb. — Wash, strip and cut in inch pieces, place 



FRUITS. 403 

is a stoae erode. Cover well \rith white sugar. Use no water. 
Put in the oven and bake one-half hour. Delioioius. 

Stewed Peaches, (Pbbsh).— Make a syrup of 1 cupful of 
sugar and 1 cupful of water. Add 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice 
and the kernels of S peaches, blanched and split. Peel 6 or 7 
peaches and put them whole in the syrup. Stew gently twenty 
minutes. Pour into a dessert dish, and leave to get thoroughly 
cold before serving. 

Peach Compote— Take some firm, free-stone peaches, cut 
them into halves, remove the stones and dip the halves in boiling 
water. Then, after taking off the skins, cook them in hot syrup, 
allowing them to boil up twice, when they will be done. Then 
dish them up, strain the syrup through a sieve ajid pour it over 
the peadaes. The compote may be served eitiier hot or cold. 

Fried Peaches. — Take peaches not wholly ripe, slice a trifle 
thicker than apples and fry in precisely the same manner. 

To Prepare Frnit for Children.— Put plums or enrrante, 
sliced apples, gooseberries or any other fruit into a stcme jar, 
sprinkle among them as much sugar as necessary. Set the jar ir 
a moderate ovai, pouring in 1 cupful of water to prevent the fruit 
burning. Slices of bread may be put in layers alteamately with 
the &uit, and may be eaten with the sauce. Cook until thoroughly 
done. This will be found wholesome and palatable. 

Dned Peaches, (Stewbd). — Dried peaehes are to be prepared 
the same as dried apples, using no flavoring, less water, sweetening 
to taste. 

Stewed Prunes. — Wash carefuUy. If very dry, soak ovei 
night; if not, cover with cold water and set on the back of thf 
range to warm slowly. Let simmer gently a couple of hours; 
aweeten to the taste before removing £rom tiio stove. Hi tiiem.

SOUR PICKLES. 

CnfiOJUber Pickles> — ^0 small dncumbers (if large ones are 
used a smaller number will be required), 3 gallons of vinegar, 8 
quarts of salt, 6 ounces of alum, 2 ounces of allspice, ^ pound of 
black pepper, 1 ounce cloves, horse-radish cut in strips, sugar ac- 
cording to the strength of the vinegar. Put the cucumbers and 
horse-radish in alternate layers in a large stone jar. Throw the 
salt over them and cover with boUing water. Let stand twenty- 
four hours in this brine, then pour off and rinse in cold water. 
Boil the spioea and vinegar and pour over them. In two weeks 
they will be ready for use. Delicious hard pickles that are not 
affected by age or climate. 

Best Cucumber Piekles. — Take a five-gallon jar, put in a 
layer of green grape leaves, then a layer of green grapes picked 
from' the stem, then a layer of cucumbers. Eepeat this operation 
until the crook is full; then add cinnamon, aQspioe, ginger and 
red peppers ; cover with pure soft water. Tie a cloth on the jar 
and let it stand nine days. Then add a cupful of sugar, or more if 
needed. Excellent. 

Cncnmber Pickles (Mixed). — Wash and drain them; put in 
a jar with alternate layers of green tomatoes and common-sized 
green peppers; cover with a boiling-hot brine made in the propor- 
tion of 1 pint of coarse salt to 1 gallon of water. Let stand 
twenty-four hours. Drain, rinse in cold water and pour over them 
spiced vinegar. Have this boiling hot. Add a few roots of sliced 
horse-radish, before pouring on the vinegar. The mustard 
pickle is excellent also. 

Cucumber and Apple Pickles.— Put a layer of cucumbers 
in a barrel, then a layer of crushed apples, and so on alternately 
until the barrel is fuU. Place a heavy weight on the piokleii. If 
the juice does not cover, put in a little rain water. 



406 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Oncnmber Pickles (Mustabd).— Take 800 small oueamWrs, 
1 dozen large green peppers, sliced; 3 large heads of cauliflower, 
divided as much as possible; 3 quarts of small onions, 2 quarts of 
sliced green tomatoes. Cover with a boiling brine; let stand over 
night and then drain in a colander for five hours. BoU the cauli- 
flower and onions five minutes in a little vinegar. After this 
place in jars and pour over them the following seasoning: 1 gal- 
lon of vinegar, ^ pound of celery seed, J pound of whole allspice, 
J pound of whole black pepper. Tie the spices in a cloth and 
boil in the vinegar for some time. Eemove these, then add 1 
pound of sugar, J pound of mustard; mix smooth with a little 
vinegar. Let boil fifteen minutes, stirring constantly. 1 quart 
of string beans cut in pieces may be added to the other ingredients. 
Pour over the whole of the liquid, boiling hot. The pickles may 
be canned. Add 2 or 3 bay leaves before pouring on the vinegar, 
if desired. 

To Freshen Cucumber Pickles.— For those who follow the 
old method of putting down pickles in salt, and freshening for use, 
some rapid means of freshening is desirable. Place a few in a jar, 
cover with boiling water and let cool. Eepeat this operation three 
times. Then cover with plain vinegar boiling hot, or with the 
spiced vinegar, this also should be boiling when turned on. The 
sweetened vinegar left from sweet tomato pickles may be heated 
and poured boiling hot over cucumber pickles, and will be found 
very nice, or the mustard pickle quite as good. 

Fall Pickles. — Take fresh cucumbers, put in brine three or 
four days, take out and soak over night in warm water. Scald 
them up in vinegar, enough to cover. Drain, pack in a jar, and 
pour over them boiling hot vinegar spiced to suit. Put a few roots 
of horse-radish, sliced, among them. Tie up. They will keep a 
long time if made late. If the vinegar used in the first scalding is 
still sour, it may be used in scalding up another lot. 

Mustard Pickle. — To be used with various pickles. 1 ounce 
each of cloves, allspice, black pepper and tumeric, 1 pound ground 
mustard (be sure the mustard is pure), J pound sugar, 1 gallon of 
vinegar. Tie the spice in a thin cloth and boil in the vinegar, 
after reserving one quart of it to mix with the mustard. Take out 



PICKLES AND VINEGAR. 407 

the spice and stir the turmeric and mustard smooth with the boiling 
vinegar, first blending the mustard witii the reserved cold vine- 
gar. Pear this preparation boiling hot over the pickles. Bottle 
and cork tightly, or tie up closely. 

Chow-ChOTT. — Pick apart 2 large cauliflowers, 2 quarts of 
green cucumbers (small ones if possible) if not, large ones, cut in 
pieces; 2 quarts of green tomatoes, if large slice them; 1 quart of 
small onions, or large onions sliced, 5 large green peppers and 2 
red ones cut fine, 1 quart string beans cut in two. Put the cucum- 
bers in brine until the next day. Drain, Scald tomatoes, cauli- 
flower and beans in salt and water until partially tender. Then 
drain in a colander. Mix all together thoroughly, adding the 
peppers, and fill the cans. Then take 3 quarts of vinegar, 2 cup- 
fuls sugar, |- cupful flour, 1 ounce celery seed, 1 stick cinnamon, 
14 heaping tablespoonfuls mustard. Mix the mustard with some 
cold vinegar,"and the flour smooth in the same way. Let the vine- 
gar boil, and stir in the other ingredients. Scald, stirring con- 
stantly, and turn over the pickles boiling hot. Seal at once. In 
the absence of cauliflower, the heart and white portions of a very 
firm cabbage head may be used in amount equalling 2 quarts, when 
shredded. The beans may be omitted if difficult to obtain. If 
there is not enough liquid, add boiling vinegar. Some prefer to 
add 1 bottle of the imported chow-chow to the pickles before putting 
in the cans to give a better flavor. Mix it thoroughly with the rest. 
Pack in the cans and turn on the scalding mustard vinegaiT. One 
dozen ears of sweet corn cut from the cob, may be added. 

Mixed Chow-Chow. — Take radish pods, green peppers, long 
and round, green grapes, nasturtium seeds, green peaches, green 
cherries, green string beans, button onions, cauliflower, picked 
apart, and very small cucumbers. Pour over them a hot, strong 
brine and let stand four days, then remove from the brine to drain. 
Make either the mustard pickle or the spiced vinegar in sufficient 
quantity to cover the pickles. Heat boiling hot and pour over them. 
Keep covered from the air, but it is not necessary to seal. 

Freach Pickles. — 4 quarts green tomatoes [small], 1 quart 
small onions, 1 quart small eu cumbers, 1 small head of cabbage, 
shred fine; 1 head of cauliflower, picked apart; 2 dozen ears of 



4d& THREE MEALS A DAY. 

sweet corn, cat from the cob; 1 dozen green peppers, cat fine. Let 
them stand twenty-four hours in a light brine, ^ the ordinary 
strength, then boil ten minutes in the brine and drain very dry in 
a colander. Pack them in glass cans and pour over them the fol- 
lowing mustard pickle: 6 tablespoonfnls mustard, 1 teacupful of 
flour, 1 tablespoonful of turmeric for coloring, 2 cupfuls white 
sugar. Mix these with water enough to form a smooth paste. 
Bring to a boiling point, 5 pints of vinegar and 1 pint of water. 
Stir in this paste and cook until it thickens, stirring all the time. 
It should almost be as thick as boiled custard. Four boiling hot 
over the pickles and seal immediately. 

Picca-lilli. — J bushel green tomatoes, chopped; 2 heads of 
cabbage, chopped; 2 dozen large cucumbers, chopped; 2 dozen 
large green peppers, shredded; 2 dozen large onions, chopped. 
Sprinkle 1 pint of salt over and through this mixture, and let stand 
all night. A sausage mill is best for chopping if one is bandy. In 
the morning drain through a colander, or turn the whole mixture 
into a clean flour sack and press as dry as possible^ (In dioppiug 
the tomatoes and cucumbers drain off as much juice as possible). 
Put in a large pan, and mix with it ^ pound black mustard seed, -^ 
pound white mustard seed, 1 ounce of celery^ or 4 heads of celery, 
chopped fine; 2 cupfuls brown sugar, 2 cupfuls of grated horse- 
radish, 1 gallon of best cider vinegar, 1 tablespoonful each of 
cinnamon and allspice. Put over the fire and let cook one and a 
half hours after it begins to boil. Cook in porcelain kettle or stone 
jar. It is better to divide the quantity than to run the risk of 
scorching on the bottom. This pickle may be made without the 
cucumbers. ^ pound of mustard blended with a little cold water 
maybe added about five minutes before taking from the stove. 
The mustard makes a palatable addition, but may be omitted if 
desired. If 6 of the peppers are red the contrast in color is pleas- 
ing. Will keep without; sealing. If red cabbage is used instead 
of white, the whole pickle will fee a beautiful color. 

Sweet Picca-lilli. — ^ bushel of green tomatoes, 2 heads of 
cabbage, 12 green peppers. Chop fine and pack in jars with alter- 
nate layers of salt. Let stand over night. Next morning drain, 
press lightly. Mix the following spices with the diopps4 iiickles; 



PICKLES AND VINEGAR. 409 

8 tableBpoonfnls of ground black pepper, 4 tableapoonfuls of ciu- 
namon, 8 tablespoonfuls allspice, 2 tablespoonfuls of clovee,, 1 
cupful muBtard seed. Pack in jars, then scald; 8 pounds of sugar 
with enough vinegar to cover, and turn over them boiling hot. 

Quick Musti).rd Pickles. — Slice green cucumbers same as 
for the table, but not too thin. Sprinkle a very little salt on them, 
and let remain over night. ■ Drain; put alternate layers of mustard 
and cucumbers in the jar until full. Cover with vinegar, place/ 
a cloth covered with mustard over them. Tie down closely. They 
will be ready for use in a week. The vinega,r is nice to use with 
meat. 

Tomato Chowder. — 2 dozen large tomatoes, 1 dozen green 
peppers, 8 common-sized onions (chop fine). Add 3 cupfuls of 
vinegar, 1 tablespoonful salt (level), 3 tablespoonfuls sugar (heap- 
ing), 1 teaspoonful allspice, 2 teaspoonfuls cinnamon, 1 teaspoon- 
ful cloreB. Tie the ground spices in a thin cloth. A little chop- 
ped horse-radish may be added before sealing the pickle. Boil the 
whole two hours slowly. It is better to seal, but will keep without. 

Melon Mangoes. — Take green musk-melons or ntitmeg- melons. 
Pour over them boiling brine. Let stand one week. Then scrape 
the outside, cut out one section, remove the seeds and scrape the 
inside. Make a filling of chopped cabbage (part red cabbage im- 
proves the color), and chopped green tomatoes, little onions, radish 
pods, pickled nasturtium seeds, young string beans, little peppers, 
tiny green cucumbers and chopped horse-radish. Any or all of 
these may be used; The more, the nicer the mangoes. Spice with 
mustard seed, a few pepper-corns and two or three cloves to each 
melon. Moisten this mixture with vinegar and fill each melon 
compactly. Replace the cut section and tie up well with cotton 
cord. Pack the melons in a jar and cover with the following 
pickle: 2 quarts of vinegar cider, 2 cupfuls of brown sugar, 1 
tablespoonful cinnamon, 1 teaspoonful doves, 1 tablespoonful 
allspice. Let this come to a boil and pour over the melons. 
Twice the quantity inay be ihade, if necessary, or J of it 
according to the amount of mangoes. Very nice. Serve in a 
pickle-dish. BemQV« the cord and lay the out section by the side. 
When serving give eatdi person a portion of the melon, and a little

ot tiie filling. If too mnoh of this Soling is prepaored for ihe 
gaantity of melons, pour scalding , vinegar over it and use for f 
quick pickle. The mangoes can be used in a month. 

Mango Peppers. — Take large green peppers (sweet peppers 
are best). Slit down one side, remove the core and seeds as care- 
fully as possible. Place the shells in salt water five days; remove 
and drain. Chop oabbag«, onions, red cabbage, green tomatoes, 
a few slices of carrots, some horse-radish, a little green com, 
celery seed and mustard seed. Begulate the proportions of each 
ingredient to the taste. PiU out the pepper to the natural size. 
Sew up carefully. Cover with cold spiced vinegar, or with plain 
vinegar seasoned slightly. Place a light weight upon them to 
keep under the vinegar; tie up tightly. They will keep until warm 
weather. If packed in cans covered with scalded, spiced, or plain 
vinegar, and sealed, they wiU keep a long time. Eemove the thread 
before serving. 

Sliced Tomato Pickles. — Take large, smooth, grefen toma- 
toes. Cut oS and reject a small slice at stem and blossom end, 
cut the remainder in slices. To every 4 tomatoes, allow 1 
onion sliced. Put layers in a jar with a slight sprinkUng of salt 
between each layer, let stand over night. In the morning 
remove, drain, and pack in jars. Cover them with spiced vinegar, 
poured over boiling hot. 

Commercial Pickles. — Boil in 2 quarts of vinegar, 2 large 
tablespoonfuls of salt, 2 ounces of shallots or onions, 1 ounce of 
black pepper, J ounce Cayenne pepper, 1 ounce of mustard seed 
(some add 1 ounce of ginger root), 4 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 
Take a jar that will hold four or five quarts, and pour into it this 
pickle. When cold put into it amy freshly gathered vegetable that 
may offer. Cauliflower buds, asparagus, radish pods, very small, 
cucumbers, little onions, tender string beans, unripe grapes, un- 
ripe gooseberries and apples, small green tomatoes, putting them 
in as opportunity offers. If the pickle wastes, it should be replen- 
ished with the same mixture. 

Easy Pickles.— Take a jar with a close lid, half fill it with 
the best vinegar, then, as spare vegetables of any kind come to 
hand, such as small cucumbers, small green tomatoes, cauliflower.

put a glass bottle, inverted to keep out insects, and give the sun a 
chance to shine in a little. Add a cupful or so of yes^st to hasten 
the process, and if wanted extra sharp, add 2 or 3 quarts of sorg- 
hum syrup, or N. 0. molasses. A few weeks in the open air will 
change it, when it may again be removed to the cellar. 

Corn Tinegar. — 1 quart of shelled corn, 1 quart sorghum or 
other common molasses, 3 gallons water. BoU the com in water

caajefCnl not to use too much. Sometimes, the bands may be kept 
coed, by dipping ia cold water and drying quickly. Eepeat this as 
often as they grow warm. For making sticks, it is sometimes 
necessary to flour the hands slightly.

cold water, butter size of an egg. Let boil slowly until ready 
to candy, not too hard. Cut dates, and remove the seeds. Close 
them again, lay on a well-buttered platter in rows 1 inch apart 
each way, pour the boiled candy over, and while cooling cut in 
squares so that a date will be in each square. 

Proit or Nnt Candies.— Dates, figs, raisins or cherries dried 
in sugar and taken in small lumps may be prepared according to 
the rule given above for Date Candy. Nut-meats of various kinds 
may be also used in the same manner, substituting any of these 
for the dates given above. A variation in the candy may be made 
by substituting vinegar or lemon juice for the water used in the 
before-mentioned recipe. 

Tntti Prutti Frnit Candy.— Use the recipe for Date Candy.

1 teacapful water. Let this melt and boil slightly, then strain and 
add 1 teaspoonful acetic acid; cook until it begins to thicken. To 
this qiumtity add 6 pounds of raw shelled peanuts, boil until 
brittle, then cool. Stir constantly after the peanuts are added to 
prevent burning. In oooling, a large sheet of tin^ a dripping-pan, 
or a polished marble surface may be used. Spread over the sur- 
ftwe J inch tliiok. This should be cut in oblong pieces before it cools.

HOME-MADE CANDIES. 425 

Hitfkory»nut Caady. — Make same as first recipe for Peanut 
Gandy. 

Popeorn Gaudy • — Make a common molasses candy. Have 
com nicely popped; grind it fine in a coffee-mill, and when the 
candy is ready to remove from the fire, stir in as much of the ground 
com as possible, and pour the whole into tin trays or dripping- 
pans (well buttered), marking squares when partly cool. This ia 
a very delicious, tender candy. 

Popeorn Balls (MoiiAssBs). — To 6 quarts of popped corn, 
boil 1 pint of molasses fifteen minutes. Turn the com in a large 
pan and pour the boiled molasses over it, stirring briskly untii 
thoroughly mixed. Then, with dean hands, slightly battered,

butter, 3 tablespoonfuls water, and 1 cupful sugar; boil until it 
candies, then tibrow in 3 quarts of nicely popped com, and stir 
briskly until the candy is evenly distributed. Set the kettle from 
the fire, and continue stirring until it is partly cooled, and each 
graia is separate and crystallized with the sugar. Nice to. mix 
with other confections. 

Horehound Candy. — 1 cupful sugar, ^ cupful strong hore- 
hound tea. Boil until it candies. Pull, or pour on buttered plates 
to cool. 

Almond Macaroons. — Blanch and pulverize | pound of 
shelled almonds; rub fine, add a little rose-water. Beat the 
whites of 3 ^gs to a stiff froth. Stir in gradually 1 pound of 
^granulated sugar. Drop by small spoonfuls on buttered paper ia 
tins an inch or two apart, as they spread in baking. Bake a light 
brown in a quick oven, first sifting white sugar over them. 

Cocoannt Macaroons —1 pound of pulverized white sugar, 
^ pound fiour, J pound butter, 2 cocoanuts, grated, and the whites 
of 6 eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Stir all together; drop the mixture 
on buttered paper, in tins, and proceed as for almond macaroons. 



F^BJ^^Ji QMMIdm^. 



0BL1CI0U8 candies maybe made with confectioners' sugar, 
without cooking. The white of an egg and a tabiespoonfnl 
of cream or cold water should be lightly beaten together. 
Into this the sugar should be stirred until it is the consistency of 
stiff dough. It may then be kneaded and moulded into any shapes 
desired. A variety of flavors may be used and the candy may be 
colored with the usual materials used for coloring rose and orange 



Cream Candy, — Beat the whites of 4 eggs to a stiff froth ; 
add 5 tablespoonfuls cold water and flavor to the taste. Stir a 
little, then add confectioners' sugar until stiff enough to knead 
like bread. The proportion of 1 white of an egg, 1^ tablespoon- 
fuls water or cream, and 1 pound of the sugar, are about correct, 
and will answer for all the following recipes. Mold this in any 
desired form. Kneading a little improves this candy. Let 
harden until next day. When fruit or nuts are used, the candies 
aljould be left until perfectly hard. 

Almond Creams. — Roll the blanched almonds in some' of 
the cream candy, then in a little granulated sugar, to give them a 
' glossy appearance ; or, mold the cream in thick lozenge form and 
press a nut on the top of each one. 

Cholocate Creams. — Heat Baker's Oholooate in a dish 
placed in boiling water; when liquid, flavor with vanilla. Make 
cream candy in balls, or any other shape, dip in the melted 
e?.jcolate, remove with a fork and lay on white paper to harden. 

Cocoannt Creams. — Make cream candy, stirring in half the 
sugar at first. To the white of one egg and an equal amount of 
water or cream, add 1 cupful prepared cocoanut, and J pound sugar. 

(426) 



FRENCH CANDIES. 427 

Mix thoroughly, and add the remainder of the sugar, or as much 
of it as can be stirred in, knead lightly and mold in desired shapes. 
1 pound oi sugar should be used for the entire rule. 

Date Creams. — Cut out the stones, fill in with the cream 
candy and close carefully; or, cut out the stones and make same 
as nut creams. 

Chocolate Candy. — Make cream candy, as directed, divide 
the quantity into two equal parts; into one part work enough 
grated chocolate to make a pretty brown — ^ cupful, perhaps, to 
^ the rule first given, or more if needed. EoU this out ^ inch 
thick, then roll the white portion; place the two sheets to- 
gether, roll and slice from the end, in slices ^ inch thick. This 
will be found ornamental as well as delicious. 

Nut and Pruit Creams. — Make the cream candy as before 
directed, knead and roll out in a sheet ^ inch thick, and place the 
nut meats, (almonds, English walnuts, or halves of hickory-nut 
meats) in rows |- inch apart each way; press down, cut in squares 
with a nut in each square. Flavor with vanilla. Let harden 
before using. Fruits of any kind, dates, figs cut in halves, cherries 
dried in sugar, or raisins (stoned), may be prepared in the same 
manner. Serve Uxe fruit and nut creams mixed. The nuts or 
fruits may be rolled separately in the cream candy. Then roll the 
cream in granulated sugar, to impart a glistening appearance. 





) HE PowBB AND Influence of a well regulated home is under- 
estimated, and nowhere is woman such an absolute ruler as 
in her own household. The table is a very important 
factor in the sum total of its various departments; and happy is 
the woman who has tact, thrift and good sense enough to under- 
stand and act up to the merits that lie in this important factor. 
Everybody knows that plenty of well-cooked nutritious food taken 
into the system at regular intervals is the great conservator of 
health and strength. There should be no indifference in regard to 
this matter. A sound head and sound heart have threefold power 
and usefulness when dwelling in a sound body, and the housewife 
holds in her keeping (more than she is apt to think) these condi- 
tions for her household. 

Table Appointments. — The first and absolute essential is neat- 
ness. The table, its eloth, knives, forks, spoons, each and every 
separate dish should be bright, fresh and clean. With these con- 
ditions the plainest spread will be to the hungry, appetizing and 
attractive. On the other hand though the meal be served on cost- 
ly plush and lace, or richest damask embroidered in all the hues of 
the rainbow, with neatness and order left out, cheerfulness and th§ 
sweet home feeling are apt to go out too. Queen of her household 
let the housekeeper, whatever her station, not undervalue her high 
position, but think and work to make better and broader its in- 
fluence. 

The Cloth. — Let the quality of the table-doth be what it may, 
it is well to have a covering for the table of felt, baize or canton 
flannel. The cloth, of whatever texture, will look much better 
and wear longer spread over some thicker cloth surface; however,

THE TABLE. 



429 



some peofde serve meals very tastily without the under ooveriBg, 
using uaats instead. The mats may be very expensive, or made 
neat and tasteful at little expense. Crocheted or netted ones are 
alwE^TB nice and serviceable. The daintiest damask is heightened 
in efEect, while the cheaper and thinner varieties spread smoothly 
over tiiifl sub-cover, are far richer in appearance. Another advan- 
tage to be gained by this is the deadening of the sound of dishes 
as they are lifted and replaced. 

DINNKR. 

Laying the Table may require a few general rules. T© do 
this. First imagine a square for the plate, lay the fork or forks at 
the r^t, then the knife with the sharp e^e turned from the per- 
son who is to use it, beyond this the soup spoon. At the point <rf 
these place the individual butter-plate. Lay the uapMn folded 
square at the left hand, with a piece of bread or a roll in its folds. 
At tiie upper left hand corner place a goblet or small tumbler for 
water. If a second spoon be needed, lay it beside the first, or use 
it to define the upper part of the square. Individual salts and 
peppers, if there are used, may be arranged to suit the taste. Extra 
knives and forks follow the rule given above. At the carver's place, 
if the carving is to be done at the table, spread a white napkin, 
(large) with the point toward the middle of the table to protect the 
taMe-doth from splashes of gravy. If there is no castor, cruets 
and fancy pepper and salt- boxes can be had in a great variety of 
styles and prices. A vase of flowers is always attractive, and adds 
grace and beauty to any table. Place the pepper, salt and vinegar 
at the ends of the table, the individual butter and salt-dishes at the 
side of each plate. 

SerTing the Table may be very much simplified at an in- 
formal dinner, or rendered elaborate where there are trained 
servants. The simpler form only will be touched upon here. 
When there are many persons to be served it is very convenient to 
have ice-watei! in the glasses, butter on the plates, and if the first 
oonisie is ^w oysters, have them in the dishes. Even soup, espe- 
cially where untrained help is employed, may be served before the 
guests are seated. If this is done, the plates should be heated and 



430 THREE MEALS A DAT! 

the soup itself hot as possible. If the soup is to be Bhiv<xi at the 
table, let it be done by the hostess. The tureen aiid a pile of 
heated plates should be placed before her, and a single silver ladle- 
fill dipped into each plate, and handed to an attendant who passes 
the plate at the left of the guest. 

The serving is usually oommeneed with the lady at the host's 
right hand and continued around the table. The soup should be 
eaten with the piece of dry bread or roll found at each plate. 
Buttering is only less vulgar than thickening the contents of the 
plate with crumbs. When the plates and tureen have been 
removed (take the spoons first), the next course should be brought 
on. If this is fish, only one vegetable should be served at the 
same time. Sliced lemon and squares of bread should be passed 
with it. Bread should be passed with each course. After a fish 
course, the plates are changed before the meats are brought on. 
Fish, is frequently omitted, • as rendering the serving necessarily 
tedious. If roast beef, and game or fowls are both to be included 
in the dinner, they must be made into separate courses, each with 
their appropriate accompaniment of one vegetable. 

Jellies, pickles and other dishes, such as croquettes of various 
kinds, are used as side dishes or entrees, with the different courses. 
However, in the rather simple dinner taken for an example, it will 
be perfectly good taste to follow the soup with a roast, of any pre- 
ferred kind, served with two varieties of vegetables, which are 
placed with the platter of meat (one upon each side) before the 
host, together with a pile of heated plates, on which he serves the 
viands to each guest, either with or without the assistant passing. ' 
Jelly must never be put in sauce-dishes, but placed upon the plates 
by the host, or each may help him or herself, as the jelly is passed. 
The thin vegetables must be put in small sauce-plates* Olives, 
pickles and other relishes, should be passed by an attendant. The 
simple roast, served ia this fashion, may constitute the substantial 
portion of the repast. Or, there may be substituted for flie roast, 
a turkey with accompaniments. Cranberries used upon such an 
occasion, with turkey, should be served in the form of jelly, and 
put directly upon the plate. A pair of fowls, with dressing, maj 
be substituted for the turkey; or, they make a very nice third 



inn ~iAci<c. ^-^i 

eonrse where beef has formed the second, and may be served with 
cauliflower or Brussels sprouts prepared in almost any fashion. 

If the carver is inexperienced, a portion of the carving may be 
done before the turkey or fowls are placed on the table. If there 
is a salad it should be served separately. The dishes, belong- 
ing to any course should always be removed and fresh ones sub- 
stituted. 

The substantials of the repast finished, the maid should be 
summoned and commence the clearing of the table by carrying 
out, first, the meat, then the dishes of vegetables, and after that 
plates and butter-plates. Use a tray to transfer everything except 
the large platters. Never allow the scraping of the contents of 
one plate into another, and bearing off the whole pile at once. 
Two plates at a tinie are enough. 

Then, after the soiled dishes, if the dessert is to come next, 
without the intervention of another course, have all the table fur- 
niture, salts, peppers, etc., removed,; except the glasses, ice-bowl 
and water bottle, or pitcher, and the crumb-brush and tray used. 

Chanoing the table-linen for dessert is always optional. 
Dessert-cloths, napkins, fruit-cloths and napkins (colored) are 
pretty, but so many changes render the serving more complicated. 

Dessert of pudding and pastry follow, or, more fashionably, 
and also more healthfully, after the long, substantial dinner. 
Charlotte Busse and some of the various delicate and delicious 
creams saay take the place of the richer desserts. Coffee may be 
served with this course (it should never be served earlier). It 
should be poured by the hostess. Cream, if desired, should be put 
in first, and cubes of white sugar, dropped from the sugar-tongs, 
in the saucer, that each gues^ may sweeten it to his liking. 

Sardines skinned and served in a dish of lettuce hearts or 
water cresses, will be a pretty novelty to take the place of a salad 
at dinner or luncheon. 

If the dinner is a very ceremonious one, the coffee will not 
appear until the last course, which consists of fruits, ices and 
co&e (the ices optional), and the work of waiting is done. 

FiwsER-BowLs are brought on with the dessert, and placed at 
the left hand of each guest. They should be two-thirds fall of 



43^ THREE MKALS A DAY. 

lake- warm water, with a slice of lemon or a gerardum leaf in each 
one, or flavored with rose or any preferred scent. Pretly Japanese 
bowls at 20 and 25 cents will do nicely. The bowls are sometimes 
set, each on its tiny doily, in the glass plate used for deseert, and 
placed before the guest, who should remove the bowl and doily to 
the left hand, leaving the plate free for the dessert. 

Where baemd puddings or pastry are served at a plain dinner, 
they should be brought in and place before the hostess, in the 
dish that they were baked in, and seiTed. If silver outside 
pudding and pie dishes are attainable, they are a great improve- 
ment. 

TABLE KTIQUETTE. 

In giving & dinner, have regard to the size and convenience of 
your rooms, and regulate the number of guests to suit, as a crowded 
table is always tiresome. Be sure to know that those invited are 
agreeable to each other. Strangers are sometimes invited as a 
compliment to other guests, or, as courtesy to themselves. All 
guests should be invited ten days before the dinner, and should 
accept or decline at once. They should be punctual to the hour 
named. Ladies usually appear in full dress; gentlemen in th6 
usual conventional black, with white vests. 

Guests should find their places quietly as possible. Cards at 
each plate will be an assistance. 

Guests remain standing until the hostess seats herself. 

A GENTLEMAN escorting a lady into the dining-room should 
offer her his left arm, and, on passing through the door, pass first 
himself and let the lady follow without dropping his arm. 

The knives and fohks are to be used as follows : The small, 
spoon-shaped, fork is used for raw oysters; the next smallest fork 
for fish; a .silver knife is usually supplied for fish also; steel- 
bladed knives, with elegant handles, are most usually provided for 
meats. 

Soup should be eaten from the side of the spoon, noiselessly. 
To be very exquisite, dip up the soup with the side of the spoon 



farfeest from you and move it toward the farther side af tkk plate^ 
is liftiiig it toward the lips. This will give time for a drop to faU 
into the plate from the outside. 

Napkins should be partly unfolded and laid carelessly on the 
left knee and used to wipe the lips lightly. 

Courses wherein knives and forks are both used, the knife 
should be held in the right hand and the fork in the left, and they 
should not be exchanged. Keep the fork in the left hand and 
convey all the food to the month with that hand. 

Courses where no knife is required, such as salads, croquettes, 
sweet-breads, etc., the fork is held in the right hand. 

Knives and forks should be held with the handles resting in 
the palms of the hands and with the elbows close to the sides. 

FoBKS are used, wherever it is possible, for puddiags, creams 
and jellies; by some persons for ice cream, and in some houses 
both forks and spoons are sent up with them. 

With vegetables and macaroni use a fork. Artichokes and 
olives are eaten in the fingers. 

Peaches, pears and apples are prepaied for eating by holding 
the fruit on a fork, and paring with a fruit knife. 

AooiDESTs should not be noticed. 

In SENDDfs up the plate for more of any course, the kaife and 
fork should always be removed. The handles of both kaives and 
forks are loaded, hence there is no danger of soiling the table 
linen; or, if one is skillful, they may be held in one hand care- 
lessly. 

AiwATTS break the bread. 

Do NOT fold the napkin after dinner, leave it beside the plate. 

Nevee pass a plate ofiered you to some one else. 

Do NOT let the teaspoon remain in the cup while using; leave 
it in the sauc^. 

GxovES shoold be worn to the tsctile and removed. 
. Dinner should be announced to the hostess. The host leads 
the way with the principal lady guest, or the eldest one present, 
and the hostess should bring up the rear with the principal gentle- 
man, whom she seats ngon her right, taking her owo seat opposite 
the host. 
ai 



434 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

QKHia:,BMEN asaiBt the ladiee thej have aocompamed to seats, 
then seat thexaselTes. 

GteNTiiSMEN are informed what lady they will have the honor 
of taking out, and, if strangers, are given an introduction, iliough 
in England this formality is sometimes dispensed with, as guests 
at a. dinner party are free to converse with those next them without 
a pjreviona introduction. A gentleman will take out to dinner some 
other lady than his wife, a brother will select some one to fill the 
place of Ms sister, while these ladies have already, it may be, 
aoeepted the escort of some stranger. Guests may remain one 
hour after dinner. 

Melons that are sufficiently soft are eaten with a spoon. 

A knife and fork both are used in eating salad, if it is not cut 
op before serving. 

Piae-apple is the only fruit that requires the use of both knife 
and tvtk. 

BRRAKFA8TS. 

Bbeaefj. parties are growing in favor with AHitsiiCans of 

iate, as beiag less formal than a ceremonious dinner. The hour is 
from nine to eleven, varying with circumstances. ., 

The invteation may be an informal note, or a card of the 
hostess, in which case below the name is written, "Breakfast at 
eleven o'clock, Wednesday." 

Spread the table as nicely as possible. A white cloth with 
'<rhite napkins under each plate and mats bordered with scarlet, are 
very effective. 

A tiny breakfast castor at each end of the table, or a cluster 
of vinegar, oraet, salt and pepper bottles, as for dinner, may be 
arranged at each end. A salad set is very pretty. 

FainT, of which the first course is to consist, should be placed 
in two glass bowls in the center of the table with a vase of flowers 
between, or in one large bowl, arranged with flowers on either hand. 
Berries, peaches, melons, pears or grapes, are pretty summer dishes. 
For winter a beaiitifully arranged display of Malaga or Tokay grapes, 
dates, %s and oranges, may take their place. Ikeae should be 
served i^t. ' 



THE TABLE. 435 

Oantai^otjfes in their season are delicious for breakiaisi, bananas 
are kealthful, and sliced tomatoes taken from ice are exceedingly 
refreshing. 

Oatmb&l, or cracked wheat porridge, with cream, fezms the 
next course. 

Fried Oysters may follow this if desired. Removing the 
bowls, all that is really necessary is a course consisting of broiled 
birds, spring chickens, or tenderloin steaks with buttered toast. 
Fowl or steak should be accompanied by potatoes in some form. 
Saratoga potatoes, croquetted potatoes, or other forms. Any variety 
of bread may be served either cold or hot, but very nice and light 
of its kind. 

Butter shoiild be in several small plates with bits of ice 
around it. 

The closing course should be hot cakes served with koHey or 
maple syrup, placed at each plate in sauce dishes. 

CoPFEE, extra nice, should come on with this course, tea and 
chocolate may also be at hand. 

A glass of nice jam, or tart jelly, may be placed upon the 
table to serve with the meats. 

A BREAKFAST should ucver be too elaborate, one attendant being 
sufficient, unless the guests are very numerous. 

Guests should not remain more than half an hour after leaving 
the table. 

The same forms, though somewhat plainer, are very suitable 
to follow for the family breakfasting. Little attentions to refine- 
ment and bp'^uty render the etiquette of state occasions mnr" easily 



IaUNGHROJSLS. 

LuKOHBOMS for guests are ve^y similar to the late VseaMast. 
Ladies only are invited to lunch. One o'clock is the earEest per- 
missible hour. A little later is more desirable. 

BouiiiLON may be served first in little cups. Tea, coffee, or 
ehocdate, follow with the substantials. Salads, cMtken, or lobster, 
eyiters in fzys, seaUops, or panned, together with cutlete, sweet-

Ts^ TABLE may be decorated with fruits and flowers as for a 
brea^ast. Fancy cakes and bon bons should be on the table, and 
dainty crackers, or wafers, must be served instead of bread. 

Tabi/e-cloth and napkins are usually colored, and tba whole 
seal lifter than a breakfast. Some ladies only give ^ rolled 
8andwi(&es of grated ham, wafers, and tea or chooola^.

desired. Fruit and flowers to decorate. 

BomuiON for first course served in small cups, or cups and 
saucers, with a teaspoon, or any clear soup may be used. 

Ohioken salad, oyster pates, or any other pates follow. Oysters 
fried, frioaeseed, or scallopped, ox fish may be served before the 
salads, etc. 

Casus, small, fancy, mixed, one variety of loaf, the made 
jellies (gelatine), lemon, etc., served with whipped cream heaped 
about tiiem. 

Coffee, or chocolate, may be served after the salads. 

Bread, or rolls, are also necessary, while almond, or chocolate

preferable. 

Ohioeen Oh££Se, pressed chicken, pressed veal and veal leaf 
are in great estesm. PicMed hard^oiled eggs, radishes, cucum-

marmalades in ^aisses are sufficient. Pie and small fancy cakes 
are usuully reKshed.

wished, make in a pyramid of three or four loaves, frosted. A bag 
of Crystallized Pop-Corn may be given each one ; mix with candy, 
if wanted; make the bags any shape of bright colored tarleton. 
Distribute Uiese last of all, that they may be taken home. Two 
loaves on stajids wreathed with flowers, and Aoweta in the center 
of each leaf may take the place of the pyramid. 

MAKINQ RRADY. 

Tbb oiuef secret of all preparations for expected guests, is to 
make as mttny of the preparations as possiUe before the arrival of 
guests. Fniits may be selected the day before, carefully wiped.

arranged in their appropriate dishes and set awaj until time for 
using. Nuts should be picked over, cracked, ready to serve. All 
the table-linea carefully sorted out and arrange for use. 

The silver-ware and china should be prepared for use at all 
times. When turkey is to be served for dinner, it can be made 
ready for the oven the day before. A chioken-pie may also be 
baked and heated next day. Mince pies are better for keeping a 
few days, and are always ready to serve. When wanted, cranberry 
jelly may be prepared and molded. Then there are some desserts 
that can be made ready and are as good or even better for keeping 
a day or two. Consult the recipes. Dressings for salads, and cold 
sauces for puddings, may be made the day before and kept nicely, 
esperaally if ice is handy. 

With all these matters attended to in time, no hostess need 
tremble for the result, nor dread the accidents and failures almost, 
certain to ensue where hurry and confusion rule the hour. Of more 
importance still, her time is left free to entertain her guests. 

Much anxiety and care is overcome by having all things 
ready. 





HOU8R GLRANINQ. 

HE regtdar rontine of the winter's wori, no matter how eare- 
fally performed, leaves ample necessity for the annual or 
Bemi-annnal return of that domestic revolution popularly 
termed "house-cleaning." An event so punctual, proper, and at the 
game time so disagreeable and wearisome in its recurrence that a few 
hints as to simplifying its details will be by no means out ©f place. 

The Cellar. — Begin with the cellar. Empty the ash bin, 
clear the furnace and dispose of the useless rubbish. See that no 
decaying vegetables are left in dark comers to render the atmos- 
phere of the whole house prolific of disease. If the air of the 
cellar should seem very close, all impurities and parasitical growths 
may be destroyed by closing the doors and windows an^ burning 
a little brimstone (powdered) in an old pan. This may not always 
be necessary, but every year the following: 

White -WASH for okllaks should be liberally coated over ceil- 
ings and wood-work. Make a common white-wash after any of 
the rules given, and add to it copperas, which is a cheap article, 
in the proportion of 6 or 8 pounds for J bushel lime. This has 
eleansing and disinfecting propraties not to be over-estimated, 
and is a prevBHf ative of the ravages of rats and mice. Some apply 
this wash twice a year. It is also us^ttl for applying to kitchen 
closets. 

Dahf oisLiiABS.-^To i^event damp cellars and soi^-rooms, 
place a peck of fresh lime in an open box and stand on the floor. 
This is invaluable. A peok of lime will absorb about 7 pounds, or 
more than 3 (3[Ufi.rt8 ef water. In this way a cellar or milk-room 
may soon be dried, even in the hottest weather. A bushel of lime 

(44S) 



THREE MEALS A T>AY: 

absorbs 27 pounds of water and still appears as a iny povder. In 
this condition it will be very useful to spread orer the garden, 
lawn, or around fruit trees, or it may be used for a white-wash. 
With lime in the cellar, chills will be an unknown qvt&ntitj. 

To Purify Brains — Dissolve 2 pounds of copperas in a pail 
of water; should be washed down all drains, sinks, vaults, etc. 
All pipes leading from the kitchen should have boiling lye turned 
down them once a week, at least, in sufficient quantities to eat 
away the accumulation of grease that coats the interior of the 
pipe. A few drops of carbolic acid should be poured down the 
pipes leading from stationary wash-stands. What little odor that 
escapes into the room is very beneficial to any one a£Sieted with 
throat trouble. Any decomposing substance may be rendered 
odorless by a layer of powdered charcoal, quicklime or common 
road dust, which is in itself a good disinfectant. 

Closetsshonldbertext in order. Examine all oaist-o^F clothing 
in attic and store-rooms and distribute to the needs of others. Sort 
and put in paper sacks or pasteboard boxes the " odds and ends " 
that every thrifty housewife reserves for time of need, labeUng each 
distinctly for convenience sake. 

Wash and wipe floors and shelves ; while these are drying 
have the garments and bedding on lines airing in the sub and wind. 
Damp cloths only should be used for shelves, as it is desirable 
they should dry quickly. Sweep the walls and ceilings. Dust 
Persian powder in all the cracks to prevent moths and other in- 
sects, or sprinkle benzine plentifully in the crevices. The odor 
will evaporate quickly. Be careful in handling it as it is very in- 
flammable. These rules apply to attic and closet. 

To PreTCBt llEotks. — Take furs and other winter clothing, 
before the insidious miller claims them for its home; hajag out doors 
Iq the wind, brush well with a whisk-broom, and envelop in brown 
paper sacks. Wrap the more valuable articles in newspapers be- 
fore putting in the sacks. Printers' ink bdng one »f the best 
preservaiivea against the depredations of moths. Turn over the 
edges of the sack and paste carefully down with a little £our paste 
(raw flmii and cold water stirred smoothry together will answer), 
making sure tiiat there are no openings in the sack where the moth 



HOUSEKEEPING. 447 

oiiiier oan creep in. This is absolately safe if done early in the 
seascm. Blankets, sbaTrls, cloaks, etc., can be wrapped in large 
papers. Label every article as it is fastened, and keep a little 
memoranda book of where each package is put, thatwhen one es- 
pecial artido is needed it can be found at once. Camphor gum is 
apt to turn furs a, light color. A cedar box is very nice to put 
these packages in, but in its absence a whisky or alcohol barrel is 
equally good. A little bergamot or some other perfume will do 
ftway with the odor. 

Betum aJl articles to the closets, close the doors and every- 
thing is teady for cleaning the rooms. 

One Soom at a time is all that should be undertaken. In 
this way dust, turmoil and misery, too often attendant upon house- 
cleaning, are avoided. A large, dean, soft dust-doth, if very 
slighUy moistened, is much the best. Dust carefully every article 
of furniture in the room, and carry either out doors or into an ad- 
joining room. Pictures and mirrors that are too large to be re- 
moved from the waQs shoiild be carefully dusted and then covered. 

Cai^etS. — ^Pull the tacks. Be careful not to break the heads 
and leave points in the floor. The carpet, if a Brussels or Wilton, 
should be folded by the seams, instead of being gathered into a 
heap, as these carpets are creased by treatment that would not 
harm an "ingrain" or "three-ply." 

Leave the rope very slack before 'he carpet is hung, then lift 
to the retjuired height by long and bM-ong poles. Select for whips 
long, smooth, flexible twigs, canes will answer. Carpets should 
never be shaken as their weight inclines them to part. In beating 
them whip the wrong side first and thoroughly, then the right 
side. Brussels, however, and other heavy carpets, should be 
whipped on the right side only, as they are so heavy that the dust 
cannot penetrate them. 

Sprinkle the floor from which the carpet has been removed 
with water containing a little carbolic acid. This will lay the dust 
and destroy its poisonous action on the lungs — dampened saw- 
dust may be used instead. 

To Clean Wall Paper. — If not much sailed, simply wiping 
oS \?itb a soft doth puaaed over a broom, changing for a dean one

frequently, wiH answer; another way, ia to take 2 quarts of wheat 
bran, inclese it ia a bag of thin open flannel or strainer cloth; witli 
this rub the paper, shaking up every few minutes so as to keep the 
surface fresh. This is a very good method. 

Grease Spots oa Wall Paper may be removed by mixing 
pipe-day or fuller's earth (an old day pipe may be ground fine 
and used,) with water to a paste. Lay on the spot, let remain all 
night, in the morning remove with a knife or brush. 

Grease Spots on Floors may be scoured perfectly clean by 
the use of strong pearlash water or sal-soda. Mix this with sand if 
the spot is very large. 

Broken Places in Walls may be filled with a mixture of 
white sand and plaster of Paris made into a paste with a little 
water. Cover over with a bit of paper to match that oa the 
wall. 

Smoked Ceilings that have been blackened hy a kerosene 
lamp may be washed off with soda water. 

To Bemove Paint and putty stains from window glass, dip a wet 
doth in baking soda and rub the paste thus made thinly over the 
glass. Let remain fifteen minutes, and wash in warm, soft water, 
without soap. This will bring all the stains with it. Eub dry and 
polish. 

Second — Wash the window glass with hot, sharp vinegar; this 
will remove mortar and paint. 

Geained wood work should be washed with cold tea. 

Oiled and vaenished woods should be simply wiped with a 
flannel cloth wrung out of warm, soft water. 

Painted wood-wobk m&j be washed with a few drops of 
ammonia in the water used. Put 1 teaspoonful of ammonia in a 
quart of warm soap-suds, dip in a flannel cloth ; apply rather lightly 
but rapidly; dust and specks will all disappear. 

Second. — Dip a flannel cloth in warm soap-suds and then in 
whiting; applied to paint, this will instantly remove grease and soil 
of every description; wipe o|E with dear water. Deheate paiats 
will not be injured but look like new. 

To WASH WINDOWS take a little spirits of ammonia on a sponge, 
rub over the glass touching ey^part of the pane, then rub briskly 



HOUSEKEEPING. 449 

with a piece of soft paper; this does away with soap and water and 
leaves the glass brighter. 

Second — Dip a damp cloth in whiting, and rub on tha glaas; 
rub to get off all dirt, then let it dry on; after which mb with a 
dry cloth; it is nice for nickel-plating and knives and ferke. This 
method is also useful for show cases and mirrors. 

The floor may be cleaned next, with water containing 
ammonia or soap. . Simply wipe off, scrubbing is not necessary on 
floors protected by carpets. 

Wipe thb floor carefully a second time. A handful of borax 
in ihis water wiU act as a preventive of moths. 

Carpets may now, when the floor is perfectly dry, be returned 
to the room carefully stretched and tacked in place. Use carpet- 
lining paper, or two or three layers of newspapers, though some 
adhere to the old fashion of putting straw under carpets. 

Moths in carpets must be carefully guarded against when 
carpets are laid. Borax water is good and should be used. Lay 
the carpet down, turn the edges back, sprinkle salt or black pepper 
and turn the edges back and tack firmly. 

Heavy carpets do not require to be taken up every year; 
remove tacks from these, fold the edges back, wash about a foot of 
the floor all around in strong soap-suds with a tablespoonful of 
borax dissolved in 1 quart of water. When diy.dust with insect 
powder and re-tack. 

Second. — Lay a damp cloth quite |^wide and wet along the 
edges of the carpet J while on the floor, and iron dry; the steam vnll 
kill both moths and eggs. This will answer for any style of 
carpeting. 

To brighten oaepets, the ammonia and water mentioned 
before, wiped over an entire carpet, is useful. It is necessary to 
wring out the cloth frequently and get a fresh supply of the solu- 
tion. 

Second. — Sprinkle a pound of damp salt over the surface and 
sweep off. 

Save the ravelings when putting a new carpet down; they 
will be very useful to mend with when it begins to wear. 

To Take out ©rease Spots From Catpets.-"^over the

spots with fresh buckwheat, removing it as fast as it absorbs the 
grease aad applying fresh until the spots disappear. 

Second. — Kerosene oil spilled upon a carpet will often entirely 
disappear by evaporation if the room is closed and kept from dust. 
If the spot still remains, a thick coating of powdered French chalk 
should be spread over it and heated occasionally by laying a brown 
paper over it and pressing with a hot iron. 

Biscelored Spots on Carpet can be frequently restored by 
rubbing with a sponge dipped in ammonia diluted with water; 
clothing the same. Ox-gaU is useful for same purpose. 

Soot OH Carpets, falling from an open chimney, may be swept 
up without the slightest trouble by sprinkling it lavishly with salt 
at first and then sweeping. 

Stair Carpet Pads should be made by folding Waste cotton 
or pieces of old quilts in newspapers; have them a little shorter 
than the oarjtet is wide. Put them over the edge just where the 
foot naturally strikes the front of the stair. It will preserve the 
carpet and deaden the sound of footsteps. Old pieces of carpeting, 
doubled, are very good for this purpose. If the stair carpet is a 
little longer than the stairs, it can be moved up or down at different 
times BO as to last longer. 

Fnmitlire Polish. — Take 4 ounces of alcohol, 4 ounces of 
boUed oil, 1 ounce of Japan dryer, and 1 ounce of benzLae. Mix 
all and shake well while using. This removes all ■ foreign sub- 
stances, at the same time gives a fine polish. Rub dry with a 
woolen cloth. This recipe sells regularly for seventy-five cents. 

FnrBitnre Polish, (II), must be made use of before the 
furniture is brought back to the room. Any of these given below 
are reliable: 1st. Mix equal parts of vinegar, spirits of turpen- 
tine and sweet oil in a bottle. Apply with a flannel cloth and 
polish afterward with a piece of chamois-skin or silk. It is better 
than a coat of varnish and will remove spots also. 2nd. Ten 
cents worth of bees-wax melted in a tin-cup in a hot oven; add to 
this 2 ounces of turpentine and let cool. Apply briskly to the 
furniture and polish with an old silk handkerchief. 8rd. A littie 
kerosene rubbed into furniture with a flannel improves ^^^e color 
\iA pofi^:3 it. The odor ^uieklj evap oratea. 



HOUSEKEEPING, 451 

Blaek Walnut furniture may be cleaned and pcdished with 
the following mixture: J pint warm strong coffee, 1 tablespoonful 
linseed oil (boiled). Apply with flannel; polish with a diy flan- 
nel, d-reftt improvement. 

Fnnuture Tarnish.— 1| ounces linseed oil, raw; 1 ounce 
alcohol, ^ ounce Venice tUqientine, 4 drops benziae, i drops 
spirits turpentine. 

Mirrors and picture glasses should be polished with a bit of 
chamois-skin squeezed out of clear water, and then polished with 
a dry piece of the same. 

To Cleam a Library provided with enclosed stationary cases, 
the books shoidd be taken out after the first washing of the floor, 
carefully freed from dust by striking two volumes together in the 
hand — never dust books in any other way — and return to the cases. 
If the cases are open, dust the books and remove to another apart- 
ment before the carpet is disturbed. 

To Wasll Oil Cloth. — Take milk and water. Never use soap- 
suds, as this dulls the colors, Bub over with a mixture of ^ bees- 
wax, melted, and while warm stirred into a saucer of turpentine. 
Apply with a flannel cloth and polish 'with a dry flitrnnel. Or wash 
as above and oil with sweet oil or butter. Polish. 

Tb Clean Zinc. — Rub carefully with kerosene and poJiah with 
newspapers. This combination of printers' ink and kerosene 
effectually removes all stains. 

Miekle Trimmings on stoves may be cleaned wi€h kerosene 
and whiting. Polish with dry flannel, v^ommon soda will polish 
jniokleplating also. 

Spete on Yamished Fomitm ^ may be removed by rubbing 
with essence of peppermint or spirits of camphor and afterward 
using furniture polish or linseed oil. Sometimes holding a hot 
fire-shovel over them will remove them. Polish afterward. 

Mica in eftoves may be cleaned by washing in hot vinegar. 
If it does not clean readily let remain wet some time. 

To Wash Matting wipe off with a cloth wrung lasom salt and 
water. This prevents turning jrellow. 

ToBemoveGreaselfrom Marble. —Apply a paste ma^ of 
crude potash and whiting mixed with water, or ms quicldime ia

the ooasistonoy of oream mth strong lye. Apply with a brusii. 
For 9i&Bz method let lemain twenfy-four hours and wash oS with 
soap and water. Polish the surface and the marble appears like 
new. A paste of whiting with benzine will work wonders. 

To Eemoye Iron Stains from MarWe.— Take an equal 
quantity of fresh spirits of vitriol and lemon juice. Mix in a bot- 
tle, shake well, wet the spots and in a few minutes rub with a soft 
linen cleth until they disappear. 

To Sweep Carpets use salt, dampened sawdust, bran or old 
tea leaves. 

In the Hitchen. — ^Attend to the closets first. A coat of cop- 
peras white- wash will be useful, or plain white- wash. Put the boiler 
over, fill with strong soap-suds, adding a good handful of sal-soda. 
Into this ptrt all the tins and let boil half an hour. Take the 
lamp burners and boU in the same fashion, using some old pan for 
this purpose. When removed, rinse well and wipe dry. 

Ammonia will be found a necessity in the kitchen work. Its 
uses are manifold. Some of them have been mentioned before. 
It is cheap and the crude article can be bought for household pur- 
poses. Put it in dish-water, and the pans and ketties where meat 
has been cooked, and grease will disappear like magito. 

To Oil a Floor.— Get common boiled linseed oil; heat boil- 
ing hot, and while hot go over the floor, using an old paint-brush 
and keeping the oil hot all the time. Even if the floor is very 
rough and inclined to sliver, this will make a great improvement. 
Have &e floor very clean before using. Two coats of oil may be 
needed if the floor is very bad; 1 tablespoonful of yellow ochre to 
1 quart of oil makes it li^t. The same of burnt umber will color 
it dadk. 

To Wash Dishes.— Fill the dish-pan half full of very hot 
water and t© that quantity add ^ or | cupful of sweet milk. It 
softens the hardest water, gives the dishes a clear bright look, and 
keeps the ham^ from .Roughening by the use of soap. It cleans 
the greasiest dishes without leaving the water covered with a scum, 
Kettlea aM pans that have had meat cooked in th^n should be 
half-fiHeS with hot waier and set back on the stove (a l&i^e am- 
naoaia in ^ wat&r wiR he^). Pom ^ie out when r^adj aaad irasli 



HOUSEKEEPING. 453 

in hot nrilk and water. An easy method. To save still farther 
trouble wash the dishes as above, rinse in very hot water, lay a 
soft towel in the bottom of a large milk-pan or a broad, shallow 
willow basket and pack the dishes in this to drain. At meal time 
bring out the basket and set the table, being careful that there are 
no r6ugh streaks on the china for sensitive finger-tips to feel. 
Wipe knives, forks and spoons as usual. 

A Dish Mop may be made by fastening a quantity of candle 
wicking or soft linen rags to a wooden handle the required length. 
The mop part should be five inches long when finished. 

Old Newspapers are very useful in the kitchen. Polish the 
tea-kettle with some. If very smoky moisten and dip in a little 
soda. Kub again with a fresh paper and the result will be gratify- 
ing. The coffee-can may be treated in the same manner, while 
they will put the finishing touch to newly polished silver, and will 
be found excellent to polish stoves that have not been blacSened 
for some time. 

Brass and Copper Kettles may be cleaned with a hit of flan- 
nel dipped in kerosene. 

Flat-irOQS maybe rubbed in kerosene and scoured with sand- 
paper if rough. 

BlaoMng for Stoves will take polish much more easily if a 
little turpentine or benzine is mixed with it. This rule is good: 
1 pound of black lead, 1 gill of turpentine, 1 gill of water and 1 
ounce of sugar. There will be a little odor when the fire is first 
lighted in the stove. Another- way is to mix the blacking with 
warm suds or coffee. 

To Prevent Stoves Bnsttag.— Before putting away for the 
summer mix the blacking with a little oil (sperm or kerosene) in- 
stead of water. This will prevent the summer rust. 

Stove-pipes should be rubbed with kerosene before putting 
away in the spring. This prevents rust. 

New tins should be set over the fire with l)oiling water in 
iiiem for several hours before food is placed in them. 

Stone and Earthenware Crocks.— Before being used for any 
purpose should be put in a boiler fuU of cold water. AUow this 
to Jvoil end then to cool with the jars in it. This process fills the 



454 THREE MEAI,S A DAY- 

pores of the jar and it can be used for various purposes as long 
as it lasts, otherwise the first contents will render it unfit to be 
used for anything else. 

To dean Knires. — Apply the bath brick or finely shaved 
comraon brick with the freshly cut half of an Irish potato. The 
juice of the potato will assist in polishing the steel. Use charcoal 
powder for polishing. This will not wear out the blades. 

To RemOTe Rust from Knives. — Cover the knives with sweet 
oil, well rubbed on, and after two days take a lump of fresh lime 
and rub till all the rust disappears. It forms a sort of soap with 
the oil, which carries off all the rust. 

Knife-Case. — A flannel knife-case tacked to the inside of a 
cupboard door, to be so constructed that there wUl be a separate 
compartment for each knife or fork. The flannel is sure to absorb 
any moisture left on a knife by carelessness or by accident. 

Fire and Water-proof Cement.— Mix finely sifted lime 
with tiie whites of eggs, (according to the quantity wished) until a 
paste is forxaed, add some iron filings. The paste should not be 
too ihiok. Apply this to the fractured edges, unite them. When 
dry they will be perfectly sound, fire and water-proof. Can be 
used on iron vessels. 

To Mend Cracks in a Stove. — Take 3 teaspoonfuls salt 

and 1 pint wood ashes, mix to a stiff paste with water; fill the 
cracks with this paste while the stove is hot, and when it becomes 
dry it will be as hard as cement. 

Scald the Brooms by dipping for a minute or two in boiling 
soap-suds. Do this once a week and it will keep them tough and 
flp-'ible and prove a saving in both carpets and brooms. 

Wings of Fowls, turkeys, geese, etc., should never be 
thrown away. They may be used to dust furniture, to clean the 
stove or hearth, and there is nothing better wherewith to spread 
on the paste when papering walls. 

A Higfa Stool is a necessary article in every kitchen. It can 
be used while washing dishes, ironing, preparing vegetables, etc. 
The fatigue saved while sitting at these occupations, is incalculable. 
The stool may be plain, or it may have a back and a rest for the 
feet, or a revolving top, but in any form it is invaluable. 



HOUSEKEEPING. 453 

Sliver Polish. — | pound of Paris white stirred ioto 1 pint of 
boiling water. When cold add 2 tablespoonfuls ammonia. Prepare 
a day before using and keep the bottle well corked. Shake thor- 
oughly each time bejfore applying. Apply the polish to ifae entire 
surface of the article to be cleaned. Let dry on, and then rub 
first with a soft cloth and afterward polish with a bit of eharaois- 
skin. 

Second. — Eub the plate first with an old napkin naoistened 
with sweet oil, then with calcined magnesia or whiting. Polish 
with chamois-skin. 

To Restore Blackened Silver Plate.— When, from kng 

neglect, plated ware becomes so blackened and stained that it can- 
not be restored by plate powder, take the following mixture: 1 
part of sal-ammonia with 16 parts of vinegar. Eub the stains 
gently with this and they will disappear. Then wash r^ell in soap 
and water. If necessary polish afterward with sweet oil and mag- 
nesia or whiting. 

Kerosene will sometimes clean blackened silver almost in- 
stantly. 

To Keep a Copper Tea-kettle Bright.— Wash oeeasion- 
ally with a solution of salt and buttermilk. Kinse with dear 
water. 

GALaGIMININQ, PAPB.R-HANG- 
IJSLG, RTG- 

Calcimining. — Soak 1 pound white glue over nig^t, theii 
dissolve it in boiling water and add 20 pounds Paris white, diluting 
with water tmtil the mixture is of the consistency of rich milk. 
To this any tint can be given that is desired. 

Lilac. — Add to the calcimine 2 parts of Prussian blue esd 1 
of vermilion, stirring thoroughly, and taking care to avoid too 
high a color. 

Bbown. — Burnt umber. 

Gbay. — Eaw umber, with a dash of lamp-black. 

EosE. — 3 parts of vermilion and 1 red lead, added in very 
small quantities until a delicate shade is produced. 



456 THREE MEALS A BAY. 

Lav:mjbeb Make a light blue and tint slightly with ver- 

miliOB. 

Stbaw. — Chrome yellow with a touch of Spanish brown. 

BtJFF. — 2 parts Indian yellow and one part burnt Sienna. 

Blue. — A small quantity of Prussian blue will give a soft azure 
tint. Dark blue is never desirable. Be sure the tints are delicate. 

The ceiling should have a coat two or three shades lighter 
than the walls, that it may appear merely a reflection of their 
deeper tones. The ceiling may be caloimined with the lighter 
tint, and then more color added for the walls. 

White-wash. — For other walls than hard finish, an excellent 
wash is made as follows : 

^ bushel lime slaked with boiling skim milk, 8 quarts salt, 1 
pound white glue, previously dissolved in water. 

This is a hard and durable white-wash ; does not easily rub 
off, and when tinted with any of the foregoing tints has nearly as 
good an effect as calcimine. This same wash, with the glue 
omitted, makes a good white-wash, permanent, for out-door build- 
ings, and is said to render wood incombustible. 

Paper-hanger's Paste. — l pint wheat flour and 1 paper silver 
gloss starch, second quality (some use flour alone, 3 or 4 pounds). 
Put in a wooden pail and add gradually enough cold water to make a 
smooth batter, stirring at the same time constantly and vigorously. 
Have a kettle of boiling water ready, turn into the flour and water, 
stirring until it thickens. Then pour over it gently 1 quart of cold 
water and set in a cool place until it is cold. The water over the 
top prevents a skim forming as it cools. If it is warm weather 
dissolve a piece of alum, half the size of an egg, in the boUing 
water. This will keep the paste from souring. A teaspoonful of 
clove oil wUl keep it from molding. If insect life is plentiful 2 
large tablespoonfuls carbolic acid in the paste will eradicate it 
effectually. Copperas put in the paste, or Cayenne pepper either 
will keep mice from injuring the paper after it is on the wall, as 
they occasionally do in some localities. 

Befere using the paste, thin with cold water to a consis- 
tency that will spread easily and quickly under the brush. This 
paste will keep a long time Vithout fermenting. If it should mold 



HOUSEKEEPING. 457 

it can be removed from the top and the remainder wUl be perfectly 
good. 

On hangiHg "flock" papers with crimson in them, omit the 
alum, as it ■will injure the color. 

If the paper is to be put on hard finished walls, or over var- 
nished paper or painted walls, a little more adhesiveness may be 
required. In this case, take a handful of white glue and melt in 
a little water, turn this, when dissolved, into the paste, and there'! 
will be no trouble in this'respect. 

StaieiBg Floors.—! can of linseed oH and a little burnt 
umber. Apply as paint. 

Waxing Floors.— 1 pint turpentine, I pound bees-wax; melt 
over a slow fire, no blaze because the mixture is explosive. Apply 
to the floor with a piece of flannel. Polish with a dry piece of 
soft flannel. 

Paiat for Floors.—! gallon linseed oil, 2 pounds gum shel- 
lac, ^ pound litharge, ^ pound red lead, 1 ounce umber. Boil 
slowly two or three hours until the gums are dissolved. Grind 
the paints, any color, in this and reduce with spirits of turpentine. 
Yellow ochre is the best for floor painting. This dries quickly and 
is also very nice for porch floors. 

Te Remove Old Paint. — 2 pounds sal-soda, | pound Ume, 
! gallon hot water. Stir all together and apply while still warm 
to the old paint. The mixture will soon loosen the paint so you 
can easily remove it. 

To Soften Putty in Window Frames.— Use the same 
given above. Apply both sides the glass and let remain twelve 
hours when the glass can be removed without cutting. 

GARR OF LAMPS- 
To Clean Lamp Burners. — When they become clogged and 
refuse to work, and the lamps are sure to smoke, put them over 
the fire in an old pan, cover with water to which a teaspoonful of 
soda has been added, and boil ; the burners will be found as good 
as new. 

Ta keep burners bright polish with kerosene every few mom- 
inge and rut dry with a woolen doth. If very much smoked. 



458 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

immerse in a kerosene bath and scour finally with brick-dast and 
A woolen cloth. Shining burners are an important factor in having 
a clear light. 

Cementfor Lamp Tops.— Melted alum will be found very 
good for this purpose. Use as soon as melted, aad as soon as the 
cement is cold the lamp wUl be found ready for use. 

Lamp Wicks may be made to fit, if not too large, by drawing 
out one thread near the selvedge. If this is done with a new wick 
there will be no trouble. 

To Clean Lamp Chimneys.— Wipe off carefully any smoke 
or dust and polish with a soft cloth; soap-suds dulls the glass; if 
any moisture is required, breathe down the chimney or hold wer a 
steaming kettle, then polish. A soft sponge fastened to a long 
flexible whalebone will be found better for cleaniag the inside of 
chimneys than any brush that can be bought. 

Lamps themselves should be frequency emptied and tihe 
bowls washed out with soap-suds ; a few drops of : ammonia added 
to the suds will help to remove the oily sediment. Dry thoroughly 
using the whalebone swab. If any water is left in the bowl the 
oil will sputter when first lighted. A well-fiUed lamp burns lese 
oil than one half-trimmed. 

Lamps to Trim. — Do not cut the wi(i, turn it just above the 
tube, take a match and shave off the charred end, thus insuring 
an even flame. Then turn the wick down below the edge of the 
tube that it may not draw up oil to soil the outside of the lamp. 
Do not fill too full, kerosene kept in a warm room expands consider- 
ably and the result will be oily lamps, disagreeable to handle 

BROS AND BRDDIKG. 

The chief aim with regard to beds and bedding should be ^,^ 
tise, as far as possibly, such material only as can be thoroughly 
cleansed upon necessity. Feathers, fortunately for the health of 
the rising gaieration, are not considered the prime necessity now 
that tl^ey once were, and if used at all, should have the utmost' 
care taken to prevent the unwholesome consequences that follow 
in iieir wake. To render them endurable they cannot have too 
much air and fresh wind. A feather-bed exposed to the direct rays 



HOUSEKEEPING. 459 

of tb« sun will be found far from eweet, for the reason that the 
animal matter in the feathers, the oil in the quills, is made rancid 
by the sun's heat; hence the unpleasant odor. Put them in a dry, 
shady spot, if the day be windy so much the better, and night will 
find them fresh and sweet. Feather-beds and pillows would be 
very much freshened and lightened if left out in a drenching rain 
every spring. Expose them to sun and wind, but especially wind, 
on every side until perfectly dry. 

Be sure and air feather-beds and pillows as often and as 
regularly as possible. Pillow tickings are very apt to become 
unpleasantly soiled. Much of this might be avoided if pillows 
and bolsters were carefully protected by an extra casing of heavy 
cotton doth, over which the ordinary pillow case may be drawn. 
Wash this second covering when necessary, and it will be found 
that the ticking can be preserved in cleanliness and the escape of 
the annoying down will be prevented at the same time. Air the 
pillows every day. , 

/Hair pillows are a very good substitute for feathers ; finely 
split com husks are also used, but these rustle just enough to annoy 
a nervous sleeper. 

To Wash Feather-Beds and Pillows.— Fill a thirty gallon 

cask, or large tub, with warm water, put in it one pound of baking 
soda. Do not use soap, it inclines the feathers to stick together. 
Eip open one end, sink tick and feathers in the water until both 
are wet thoroughly. Then shake the feathers out of the tick in 
the water; when clean run them through a wringer, sew up a 
couple of sheets, put the feathers in, dry in the sun, turn and 
beat until the feathers are light. Have the ticking washed and 
dried, and put the feathers back. The best way to do this is to 
open the sheets at one end, take the open end of ticking and run 
the two together aU- around, the feathers can then be shaken in the 
tickii^ without trouble or flying down. Eip apart and sew up the 
tick. Thick ticking that the feathers cannot " .breathe " through, 
should have the smallest possible opening left in each corner. Cut 
ofi a goose quiU at both ends, put one in each'opening, sew fast to 
keep from coming out and the bed will be light and fluffy as new. 
Gbose Feathers that are perfectly n^w, sometinfies have a dis- 



46© THREE MEALS A DAY, 

agreeable ordor; this may be removed by washiog the feathers as 
aboye and rinsing in water with a little ammonia iu it and then in 
clear water, then run through wringer each time. If it is pillows 
only, they may be spread upon sheets to dry in some sunny spare 
room and filled into the ticks at leisure. 

Blaukels, Quilts and counterpanes are best for continual 
wear. Comforters are very nice to throw over the bed on the out- 
|Side for extreme cedd weather. Do not use them next to the sheet, 
■ as they absorb animal heat and are to heavy to renovate frequently. 
Blankets should be aired occasionally through the winter and 
shaken often. It is really much better to always protect them by 
sheets, as they are very heavy to wash frequently besides being 
somewhat spoiled by the operation. 

Comfortable Shams should always be used. Cover the top 
where they come in contact with the breath of the sleeper, with a 
breadth of calico the length of the quilt; fold down on each side 
evenly and baste. This can be removed and washed when 
necessary. Comforts made of wool are warmer and lighter than 
cotton; if cotton is used, buy the best grades only. 

Washing Comfortables and Qailts is an easy affair and 
should be attended to oftener than is usual. Simply soak them an 
hour or two in a warm soap-suds, not too strong. Then rinse up 
and down in this water, pound with a stick until they appear clean. 
I>raija, do not wring, rinse in plenty of clean, pure water, drain 
and hang on the line. While drying, shake the wrinkles out. 
Choose a bright, windy day for this. They will be fresh and 
puffy as if new. This is one reason that the best cotton should 
be chosen, as it washes better. 

Qoilts Streaking in Drying may be remedied by laying out 
over night in a heavy dew, the streaked side uppermost. In the 
morning turn this side down and leave in the sun until thoroughly 
dry, when the streaks will have disappeared. Comfortables that are 
not too badly soiled maybe renovated in the same manner; repeat 
several days. 

Mattresses should have heavy cotton or wool comfortables 
made the exact size of the mattress, or wide enough to tuck under 
the ades to protect it from dust. This will make the mattress 



HOUSEKEEPING. 461 

softer, will protect it, and besides, can be waabecL as oftea as 
necessary for purposes of renovation. Air the mattresses as ©ften 
as possible, and let the stm into the sleeping rooms at every 
opportunity. 

Teatilatiou of Sleeping Eeoms should be carefully attended 
to. A sheet of finely perforated zinc substituted for an upper pane 
of glass in a chamber window is one of the cheapest and best forms 
of ventilation known. 

Seoond. — BaisB the window on the windward side a few inches 
and close the opening at thg bottom with a piece of board out to 
fit it, rest the sash upon this. Either of these methods are worth 
a trial. 

Spare Beds should be thoroughly aired for the benefit of the 
chance guest to dissipate the dampness and do away with the 
dangers that too often lurk about a long unused bed. Opening the 
coverings and gathering them over and around a jug of hot water 
for two or three hours is a good method. At flie very last turn 
back aaad air carefully. Fresh sheets also will do away with damp- 
ness in some measure. 

Bedsteads should be carefully attended to. Brush thoroughly, 
and ajiply to the inner portions a coating of varnish. Turpentine, 
applied with a brush to all the crevices, is thoroughly destruotite 
of insect life. But, whatever is used, varnish ca: turpentine, be 
sure that it touches every crack and crevice. (Climax cleansing 
fluid is useful.) Never aUow dust to ga&er around springs, slats 
or mattresses. 

XHK LaAUKDRY 
Washing Fluid (Ektsa). — 1 ball potash, ^ ounce salts of 
tartar, J ounce carbonate of ammonia. Dissolve in 1 gallon warm 
watec, keep on the stovf until heated, udx, keep in a jug or bottle 
well corked. Soak the soiled clothes over night. In the morning 
put 3 pails of cold water in the boiler, and add to it 1^ bars of soap 
shavei^ &as, and 1 cupful of the washing Smd. Put in the do^aes 
least soiled first. Let the water heat up grarduaUy aad boil one-balf 
hour, etkring frequently. Take out into a tub of warm water, rub 
the soiled p^nrtions if n^ceseaxy, rinse and Uoe. 



462 THREE MEAI,S A DAY. 

Non-BeiliBg Wasbing Fluid. — ^ poimel sal-sodsi, ^ pound 
boms, ^ oitnee gam oajnphor, ^ pint alcohol, ^ pint turpentine. 
Disfiolve the campho]: in the aleohol; pulverize the soda and borax 
and dissolve in 3 gallons of rain water. Mix the whole together 
and add 3 gallons more of rain water. It is then ready for use. 

Take 1 pint of soft soap, or ^ bar of bard soap, shaved fine, and 
mix with 1 cupful of Hke fluid. Make a warm, not hot, s«ds in a 
tub and soak the clothes ono-half honr, then rub out, rinse, and the 
work is done. Keep the inid tightly corked. 

Centennial S(rft Soap. — 4 pounds of the common bar castile 
soap, shave fine; 4 pounds of common bar soap, shave fine; 3 
pounds sal-soda, 8 ounces aqua ammonia. Dissolve all but the 
ammonia in 2 pailfuls of bot Irain water. Let cool. While 
cooling test the soap, and add as much water as will make it the 
consistency of good soft soap. When cool this will make about 
100 pounds of the best soft sOap. Add the ammonia while it is 
cooling and mix thoroughly. 

Centennial Hard Soap. — If any pare of this is desired hard, 
boil the required portion one hour, adding 1 bar soap and ^ pound 
sal-soda to it. If the soap is wanted white, the castile and other 
soap must be white. If it should be desirable to scent the hard 
soap, 4 ounces of bergamot may be added to 50 pounds of soap. 

DxREOTiONS FOR usiNs either the hard or soft Centeimial soap. 
Soak the clothes in a strong suds made by dissolving the soap; also 
rub a little on all the soiled spots. Let them stand over night. 
No wash-board or boiler will be required. Simply rinse out in the 
morning in two 060I waters. Tho clothes will not be injured. Soak 
in sepai;ate tubs if there is a great difference in quality of clothes. 

Ammonia for WasMng. — Make the suds as usual, put into 
the three pailfuls 2 or 4 tablespoonfnls ammonia, according to the 
hardness of the water, this whitens the clothes. Boil from ten to 
twenty minutes, according to the soiled state of the clothes. Binse 
in i^e usual way, rubbing any soiled spots. Many persons wash 
caliees, flannels and bed quilts in this manner; rinse the flannels 
in rather warm water. They will not shrink ner turn yellow. 

BOmx f&r WasMl^ may be used in the same manner aa 
ammoBia. It will not iajare the clotiies, being a neutral salt whUe 



HOUSEKEEPING. 463 

its whiteniBg properties are invaluable. Use a large handful of 
the borax powder to 10 g&llone of the boiling suds^ 

Extra Hard Soap (Cheap) — 4 bars yellow soap, shaved fine; 
2 pounds sal-soda, 6 ounces borax, 2 ounces liquid ammonia. Put 
the soap in 8 quarts of soft water to dissolve. If the water is hard, 
break it first. When the soap is nearly dissolved over the fire add 
the borax and sal-soda. Stir until all is melted. Pour into a large 
tub, or shallow pan. When partly cool add the ammonia slowly, 
mixing well. Let stand a day or two and then cut into cakes or 
bars. Do this in a warm place. No better soap can be found for 
all kinds of washing, and the outlay can be covered by three cents 
per pound. This recipe has often been sold for five dollars. 

Lye Hard Sdap. — 1 pound concentrated potash dissolved in 
2 quarts of boiling water. Let stand until luke-warm, then poiir into 
the lye 5 pounds of clean grease also luke-warm; stir twenty min- 
utes, a»d, while stirring, pour in. gradually 3 ounces of ammonia. 
When cold cut in bars. , It is best to let it cool in something broad 
and shallow. Ihis is very convenient to make when a quantity of 
grease has accumulated. It should be tried out before putting into 
the lye. 

lye Soft Soap. — Aghes should be from good wood, or the lye 
will be weak. Keey the ashes dry until a week before using; see 
that they are well packed down in the leach, which can be made 
out of a barrel. Then pour on waiter until the lye begins to 
drip slightly; leave it to soak out the strength of the ashes for a 
week. Then pour on water and begin to run ©fi lye. The proper 
strengtii can be told by its floating a fresh egg. If it is not strong 
boil it, or turn it back through the ashes again. Then add clear 
grease, or "soap-grease" in the proportion of 1 pound to 1 gallon 
of lye, boil until it is dissolved, then dip in a feather and if, on 
taking out, the plume part can be stripped off with the fingers, it 
requires more grease, which sh«>uld be added until it will take no 
more. If a white scum rises skim ofi (it is grease), or add a little 
more lye. Boil until it looks soapy. If the lye remains weak, on 
account of poor ashes, add potash until it is of sufficient strength. 

Soft Soap.— 5 pounds of potash in 5 gallons warm, soft water. 
Let dissolve over uigkt. In the morning put over with € pounds of 



464 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

grease aad boil until it is thick and soapy. If the lye needs more 
grease add it, test with a feather. If there is too much grease, 
which can be teld by a scum rising, add a little more lye. Pour 
all in a keg, or half barrel, and add sufficient soft water to make 
it the proper consistency. It is much easier to boil a small quantity 
and thin afterwards. 

CoM Soa^. — ^The grease for this shouldbe tried out. Do this 
gradually as scraps accumulate ; pour the grease, a little at a time, 
into a kettle kept for the purpose. TaHow and lard scraps, after 
the clear fat has been pressed out, are put in water and boiled, then 
strained through a colander, the grease left to rise, removed in a 
cake from the surface of the water, boiled up and poured hot into 
the soap-grease kettle. Working in this manner makes a solid mass 
of pure grease that never molds. Twenty-five pounds of grease 
will make a barrel of soap. Fill the barrel half full of lye strong 
enough to bear up an egg. Heat the grease boiling hot and pour 
into the lye. Stir often, and when it begins to thicken, fill up with 
weak lye. If made in cold weather, heat the lye as well as the 
grease. It never fails to thicken, and is much whiter and cleaner 
than boiled soap. In warm weather the soap may be made by 
putting the cold grease directly into the cold lye and leaving in the 
sun; stir often. 

Transparent Soap. — 1 pound of yellow bar soap shaved in 
thin slices, J pint of alcohol. Put in a small stone jar. Put that 
into a kettle of cold water and let the water boil for ten minutes, 
stirring the soap all the time. Scent to please, bergamot or rose, 
and pour into molds. 

Climax Cleansing Fluid,— This fluid will remove paint, 
grease, etc., from all sorts of fabrics without injury to the most 
delicate.- Carpets are renovated to a charm by its use. ' 2 ounces 
of ammonia, 1 teaspoonful saltpeter, 1 ounce of finely scraped 
variegated soap. Babbit's wUl do, some use shaving soap, 1 quart 
of soft water, mix all together and let stand a few days without 
using. Cover the spot to be cleansed and rub with a sponge, then 
wash out with clear warm water. For carpets sweep off the dust, 
cover the spots well with the liquid and then scrub them with a 
coBuuoB serabbing brush, and wash off with clear water. 



This same fluid applied with a. Rmall brush to cvery crack and 
orevice in a bedstead will be found certain death to all insect life. 
To Remove GrCiJSe Spots.— Alcohol, 4 parts; ammonia,,! 
part; ether, -^ part. Mix. • Apply the liquid to the grease spot, 
and thaa rab cLiligcntly with a sponge and clear Or use 

Climax Cleansing Fluid. In common goods the spot may be 
rubbed a little with the sponge, but in light goods simply apply it. 
Some very delicate articles may have grease removed by covering 
the spot with powdered French chalis and laying the garment away 
for several days. 

To Soften Hard Water.— To a boiler J full of water 
put in sal-soda the size of a large egg. This will not injure the 
clothes, will whiten and save rubbing. Use sal-soda for cleaning 
floors. 

The Economy of Borax.- Theadditionof an ounce of borax 
to a pound of soap melted in with a little water and not boiled, 
wiU save one-half in cost of soap and three-fourths in labor of 
washing, besides leaving the hands soft and silky and the clothes 
very white. 

Bluing. — Draw a cloth through the bluing water first to t^e 
up any floating particles; also dissolve the bluing in warm water. 
Shake the folds out of garments before putting in the bluing 
water. This will prevent streaks. 

Liquid Bluing. - 1 ounce pulverized Prussian Blue, J ounce 
pulverized oxalic acid, 1 quart soft water. Mix. 1 or 2 table- 
upoonfuls to a tub. 

BTARGHING AKID IRONING. 
Starch Polish, for shirt bosoms, collars and caffs. 1 ounce 
spermaceti, 1 ounce white wax. Melt together and mold in thin 
eekes; drop into the starch a piece the size of a dollar. 

Starch Gloss. — Put in boiling starch, to 1 quart, 1 dessert 
spoonful of white sugar and ^ teaspoonful of butter. This 
stiffens the articles and gives a glossy finish. Mutton tallow, or 
very pure lard may Be used in place of the butter. Staieh will 
not polish unless there is something added to it. A small table- 
spoonful of kp'-naene stirred into a quart of starch, after removing

it from the stove, is used by many, or a little dissolved gum ludbic 
is useful to be added to a quart of boiled starch made in the 
usual manner, gives a beautiful luster to the clothes and prevents 
the iron sticking. 

Chiuese Method of Glossing.— For three shirts take 3 
teaspoonfuls of starch, dissolve in 2 tablespoonfuls of cold water, 
pour on 1 pint of boiling water, add a piece of Polish or a bit 
of spermaceti ; cook five minutes. Then take 6 teaspoonfuls dry 
starch, mixed with ^ a large teacup of cold water. Stir this 
into the hot starch and use at once. Hot starch stiffens much bet- 
ter than cool. Have the articles dry, starch bosoms, cuffs and 
collars thoroughly, rubbing the starch in well, and roll up tight as 
possible. Iron without sprinkling, stretch and smooth the bosom 
in shape very carefully, adjust on the bosom-board, lay a clean 
cloth over it and with a good hot iron rub carefully over the cloth • 
until the bosom is damp, not wet, remove this and iron until almost 
dry, and begin to press down for the final polish. It will be im- 
proved by wiping off with a damp cloth and then using a polishing 
iron with as much strength as possible to bring out the final gloss.' 
Wipe off just enough to remove the polish left by the comnjon 
iron. To iron a collar lay it flatly down, and if it is a standing 
collar, iron the wrong side first, qufckly, to drive out the moisture, 
then polish the right side with the polishing iron. To curve a collar, 
commence in the middle and give it a quick stroke toward one end 
and then to the other, hold it a moment in position and it will 
stay so. Turn-over collars are polished flat and turned afterward; 
do not iron the band too close to the outside. Iron cuffs^the sama 
as standing' collars. Lift any plaits in bosoms with a knife. 

Polished white skirts are a luxujy, and shams and other arti- 
cles repay the trouble of polishing in their increased beauty and in 
remaining fresh for a longer period of time. It cannot be done 
without a polishing iron or irons. They cost about fifty cents 
a piece. Always use the starch as hot as possible. 

Boiled Starch to Use. — There are two ways of using this. 
One is to make a boiled starch thick as jelly. Dissolve the starch 
in a little cold water, say 2 tablespoonfuls, pour over this boiling 
water enough to make it the right cousisteucy, let boil five minutes: 



HOUSEKEEPING. 467 

blue the starch slightly, if liked, use any of the polishes given, 
then take part of the thick starch into a dish, and thin the remain- 
der with boiling water. Wring the articles out of the thin starch 
first, and then proceed to rub the starch into the collars, cuffs and" 
bosoms, lay down on a cloth and rub as much starch as can be 
contained first into one side and then the other. Wipe oif the 
superfluous starch with a cleaij cloth, stretch carefully in shape and 
dry. Instead of sprinkling, roll in a damp cloth wrung out of 
warm water, laying in first a collar and rolling over, then a pair 
of cuffs, etc. Do not let them get very damp. Iron as before 
directed. ' 

Second. — Starch in moderately thick starch made as above. 
Let dry and starch with a thin cold starch, made with lukewarm 
water in the proportion of 1 teaspoonful to 1 pint of water, 
roll up and iron in fifteen minutes or longer. Wipe off each article 
with a damp cloth to remove any surplus starch. Eemember that 
boiled starch should be used hot, and that cold starch should always 
be made with tepid water, the starch dissolves better. Some 
housekeepers make cold starch out of soap-siids made of white 
soap, claiming that it will not stick. Soft water, where clear can 
be obtained, is better for starch. A little kerosene put in cold starch 
is also recommended to prevent sticking. 

A bowl of clear water and clean old linen cloth are useful to 
remove any specks or soiling the linen may acquire while being 
ironed. Iron dry and then put all starched articles where the 
direct heat of the stove or sun may fall upon them. They are 
stiffer for drying quickly. Pin the band of the first collar to- 
gether in front. Coil the others around and put inside. This 
will shape them. Arrange cuffs in the same manner. 

To Smooth Irons that will sometimes stick unaccountably, 
rub over a board sprinkled with 'fine salt. Then pass over a 
brown paper with bees-wax in its folds, wipe off with a cloth, and 
everything will go smoothly. Irons should be taken off the stove 
when not in use. Continual warmth ruins the temper and pre- 
vents their retaining heat. 

To Keep Starch from Scummiag when taken from the ere, 
cover it closely.

Gum Arabic in Starch.— Dissolve in hot water first. Will 
give a newness to lawns, either black or colored, that nothing else 
can equal. A little is also nice for white muslins. The gum may 
be dissolved and kept for use in a bottle. Solution — 2 ounces to a 
pint of boiling water. Use a tablespoonful to a pint of starch. 

Borax ia Starch is used by some. Dissolve a lump in boil- 
ing water and put in cold starch. The whiteness and stiffness 
resulting wiU be very gratifying. 

Floni* Starch. — Take 2 tablespoonfuls of flour. Make 
smooth with cold water, then turn in boiling water until it is the 
proper consistency, add ^ teaspoonful lard and let boil three or five 
minutes. 

LaAUNDRY itrms. 

To Wash Lace Gartains. — Wash and starch. (Boil them in 
a soapy water. Do not rub. Rinse twice. Use a wringer or 
squeeze them dry.) Do not iron them out. You may stretch 
sheets on a clean carpet, fasten down, and pin the curtains on this. 
Let dry. They will look like new. 

To Wash Linen or Calico. — Make flour-starch of soft water. 
Thin with cool, soft water and wash the dresses in this without 
soap. Binse in thin stareh-water, turn wrong-side out, and hang 
in the shade to dry. 

To Wash Sateen Dresses use borax water. This method 
will restore the gloss. 

To Wash Soiled Ribbons and Ties — Rub carefully through 
a solution of ^ teaspoonful of ammonia to one cup of water. If 
much soiled put through a second water with less ammonia. Lay 
between clean white cloths and press until dry. The effect is 
good. 

Pongee requires no more care in washing than a white gar- 
ment; it will bear hard rubbing if necessary, but it must not be 
boiled or scalded. Treat it about as you would flannel; let it get 
quite dry, and if you use a quite hot iron, not hot enough to singe, 
of course, all the creases wiU come out, and the silk will look like 
new. The ironing when wet is the reason of silk handkerchiefs 
becomiug yellow, the hot iron tumiog &e moistoie into steam.

Bleaching with Chloride of Lune.— For 5 pounds of udx 

bleached muslin take 1 pound of chloride of lime, over whic"' pour 
boiling water. Let stand and settlis. Have ready in a tub warm, 
soft water enough to cover the goods, into which strain through a 
cloth the solution of lime. Stir well, put in tbe goods, stirring 
them frequently, and let remain from fifteen to thirty minutes. 
Wring out, rinse thoroughly and the process is complete. 

Coifee-starch for Brown Linen and Black Dress Goods.— 
Make as usual, using carefully strained coffee instead of water. It 
gives the proper tint and prevents white scales of starch upon the 
surface. They may also be washed in hay water. Scald hay in 
the water until it is the proper color. 

A Receptacle for Soiled Clothing can be easily made of a 
small barrel. Clean and line with cambric, covering the outside 
with cretonne or Turkey red cotton laid on in plaits. Border the 
top with a ruche of the same. Cover the lid with the same 
material and screw on a small brass knob in the center. This will 
be ornamental in a sleeping-room or corner of upper hallway. 

To Wash Red Table Linen.— Bub carefully in tepid suds, 
using a little borax in the water to set the color; rinse well. It 
must never be ironed, the hot iron fades it more than washing or 
wear. Pull out carefully and stretch in the proper shape before 
putting on the line. Dry in the shade, fold, and if wished put 
under a weight to press. They will retain their color much better 
than by the old method. 

To Wash Colored Handkerchiefs.— Washing and boiling 
does not fade these, but hot irons do. Be very careful. If 
ironing could be dispensed with they would remain bright much 
longer. 

To Remove Iron Rust. — Lemon juice and salt mixed to- 
gether may be spread upon the spots and the article laid in the sun. 
Eepeat the operation if necessary^. Starch may be spread upon 
the article instead of salt. A more convenient way is to have salts 
of lemon in a bottle dissolved in water enough to cover, and 
moisten the rusty spots with this. This will not rot the goods. 
When dry wash out in clear water. 

To RemOTe Fruit Stains.— Dip tbe injured portion of cloth 



470 THRKE MEAI,S A DAY, 

in a solution or 1 part of chloride of lime to 12 parts ot soft 
wate'' Eub it slightly and then rinse. 

Second. — Pour boUing water through the stained parts several 
times. If this does not remove it, cover the wet spot with a paste 
of starch and spread in the sun. Tea stains can be removed in 
the same way. 

To Remove Tar. — Butter or lard will remove spots of tar 
and soap and water will afterward take out the grease stain. This 
process will answer for the hand as well. 

To Remove Ink Stains. — Saturate the spot with spirits of 
turpentine and let it remain several hours ; then rub between the 
hands. It will crumble away without injuring the color or texture 
of the fabric; then wash oft with warm water. Fresh stains of 
ink can be taken out by soa'dng aad washing in sweet skim milk, 
renewing it if need be. 

To Remove Ink from Carpets. — Wet the spot with sweet 
mUk and sprinkle on salt. Leave for two or three hours and then 
wash with clear water. 

Acid Stains, lemon, etc., can usually be removed by am- 
monia. If the color still . fails to return, a touch of chloroform, 
will then restore it in almost a}\ cases. Color that has been 
changed by perspiration can usu-'ly be restored by ammonia, 
always on black goods. 

Color Destroyed by White-wash can be restored by being 
immediately washed in strong vinegar. 

To Remove Paint Spots from woolen cloth or broadcloth 
wipe off instantly with a piece of cloth; if a coat, take the lining, 
if nothing else is convenient. The same will apply to silk. If 
these methods fail, apply pure spirits of turpentine. 

Second. — Lay a many-folded sheet on the table and lay the 
stained part of the material on that (silk, cloth or any other goods 
maybe treated in the same manner), and rubbing soap on a tooth- 
brush dip the brush in warm water and wash the paint away, the 
sheet absorbing the water. When the paint is extracted move the 
material to a dry part of the sheet; rinse the brush and with clear 
vvarm water wash the soap away. Eub with a dry towel both 
sides of the material and hang up to dry. If the paint is long dry- 



HOUSEKEEPING 47I 

ing raV, mQi turpentine and wash with soap and water, or if the 
colors are delicate wash with warm water alone. Chloroform may 
be used instead of turpentine. 

15ellowed Linen that has been laid away can be bleached by 
letting it soak in buttermilk two or three days. 

To £eep Whit© Clothing from turning yellow through the 
winter, wash all the starch put in the fall, rinse in bluing water 
and put away unironed. 

To Prevent Muslin Turning Yellow.— There are some 
kinds of cotton cloth that invariably turn yellow after the first 
washing. If there is any fear of this, soak the garments two 
days before washing in clear water. 

To Remove Mildew. — Wet the spot, soap well and cover 
thickly with finely pulverized chalk or whiting. 

Second. — Soak in sour milk, rinse and lay in the sun. 

Third. — Dip in a solution of 1 part of chloride of lime to, 12 
parts of soft water, strained; lay in the sun. Repeat if necessary. 
So soon as white rinse thoroughly. 

Washing Blankets. — Put the blankets in hot soap-suds with 
a little borax in the water. Eub lightly. Too much rubbing and 
wringing hardens and shrinks the flannel. Rinse in clear water 
the same temperature as the suds. Run through a wringer and 
hang up to dry. 

To Wash Flannels of all kinds pursue the same plan as for 
blankets, though, if necesary, soap may be nibbed upon the soiled 
places. Bring in before fairly dry and roU up for ironing. 

Renovating Black Silk. — Sponge with water containing a 
little ammonia, or sponge with hot coffee (strained). Sponge on 
the side intended to show. It may be pinned to the carpet' and 
dried, or allowed to partially dry before ironing on the wrong 
side. Shiny appearance of worn silk may be removed by spong- 
ing with borax wafer (1 teaspoonful of the powdered to 1 cupful 
water), or rub off with gasoline. 

Second. — To renovate a black silk, rub each breadth caiefully 
with a woolen cloth to free from dust, and then sponge the right 
side with water in which one or two old black kid gloves havd 
been boiled (1 ^uart of water for a pair of gloves). Iron while 



472 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

wet with very hot irons, on the wrong side. This cleanses, stiffens 
and slightly dyes, and gives quite the appearance of newness. 

Seuovatlng Colored 8il](S. — The same method may be re- 
sorted to by using kid gloves the exapt shade of the dress. I'or 
this reason old kid gloves should be saved. 

BenoTatin^ Slack Cashmere. — Wash in warm suds with a 
little borax in the water. Einse in bluing water very blue, hang 
up to dry without wringing and iron on the wrong side while quite 
damp. It will look equal to new. Some use soap bark. 

Second. — Sponge with ammonia water until the pieces are 
thoroughly wet. Eoll tightly and begin ironing at once. Cover 
the board with soft flannel, lay the right side down and iron dry 
on the wrong side. Brush off any flannel lint that may remain 
on the right side. A strip of old black broad-cloth, four or five 
inches wide, rolled up tightly and sewed in place, is better than a 
sponge for cleansing black and dark colored clothes, as it leaves no 
lint. 

To Clean Black Lace. — Put in alcohol, churn up and down 
until the liquid foams. If very dusty repeat the operation; squeeze 
them out, clap them between the hands, pull out the edges, lay 
between brown paper, smooth and straight. Leave under a weight 
until dry. 

To Clean White SUk Lace. — Wash and rinse in benzine, 
dry in the open air and press between folds of white paper. Cot- 
ton lace and Crepe Lisse ruches may be washed in benzine. 

Ribbons Washed in the same way wiU often look very 
nicely. ' Benzine is veiy inflammable. 

To Wash White Linen Lace. — Mix 1 teaspoonful powdered 
borax in a basin of strong white Castile or other fine soap-suds. 
Baste the lace very carefully upon two thicknesses of white flan- 
nel, catching all the points down. Let soak in this suds twenty- 
four hours, or longer if very much soiled. Then let lie in clear 
water for two or three hours, changing once. In the last water 
dissolve a little pulverized sugar (this will stiffen slightly). Squeeze 
out, do not wring, place the flannel, lace down, on two thicknesses 
of dry flannel and smooth with a hot iron. When quite dry rip 
the lace off. The result is perfect. 



HOUSEKEEPING. 473 

Second. — Put the lace away in a box with equal parts of mag- 
nesia and powdered French chalk sprinMed liberally in its folds. 
Lace dealers keep fine' lace in this preparation while awaiting sale. 

To Restore Old Crape. — A piece of glue dissolved in skim 
. milk and water is said to be very effective in restoring old crape. 
Use very hot and clap dry. 

To Restore Velvet. — Heat a flat-iron, turn it upside down, 
put a wet cloth over it, lay upon this the wrong side of the velvet, 
then, if necessary, rub up the nap rapidly. Ordinarily, the steam 
alone will do this. 

Lisle Thread Gloves and Hose should be dried upon frames 

to prevent shrinkage. Put the gloves upon the hands. 

To Wash Swans-dovra.— Kub it gently in soap-suds, and 
when dry it wiU shake out perfectly fresh. 

To Wash Fancy Hose. — It is an excellent plan to wash all 
such hose before wearing, in a weak solution of salt and water, 
with about a teaspoonful of sugar of lead. Einse thoroughly 
afterward. Run through a wringer twice, the last time folded in a 
towel, to remove all the moisture, then turn wrong side out to 
dry. This will prevent the color from running on the right 
side. Dry immediately before a fire, as a long cold drying is sure 
to make the colors run. Pin them up to dry. Dp not lay them over 
anything. To wash, prepare a clean suds of soap and warm water. 
Wash, rinse in clear water, and, if the articles are bright colored, 
throw in a litfle salt to prevent the colors running. Wring out 
and dry as above directed. 

Black Hose should be washed as above, wringing in the 
same way, then rolled in a cloth and kept from the air while drying. 

Bordered 'J'owels should be treated the same as fancy hose, 
to set the color the first time, and then washed like red table linen. 

To Wash Silk Knit Underwear and Hose.— Wash by hand 
in cool suds of fine castile, or toilet soap, rub very little ; press dry 
in a cloth. Einse twice ; once in clear cold water, again in water 
tinctured with cream of tartar, or vinegar or alum. Dry quickly, 
first stretching in shape. Do not iron, press under a heavy book. 
If the article is black, add a little ammonia, instead of acid to the 
msing water. 



474 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

To Set Colors in Wash Goods. — Blue,:— Pu„ i ounce of 
sugar of lead in a pail of water, soak the material in the solution 
two hours, wring out and dry before washing and ironing. This 
vdll answer for aU shades of blue. 

Buff or Gbay Linen. — A teaspoonful of black pepper stirred 
into water in which these are washed wiU prevent spotting. See 
also Coffee- Starch, and to Wash Linen or Calico. 

Blace wash goods. A teaoupful of lye in a pail of water is 
said to improve the color of black goods. 

Pms OR 'Green. — ^Vinegar in the rinsing water will brighten 
these colors, also good for purple and blue. To set green soak in 
alum water before washing. See that the alum is dissolved. 
Before washing almost any colored fabrics, it is recommended to 
soak them some time in water, to every gallon of which is added a 
spoonful of ox-gall. In washing use a strong mUk-warm lather ot 
white bar soap, and put the garments into it, instead of ,rubbing 
soap on the material. Einse twice, putting a large tablespoonful 
of ox-gall in each water. 

To Clean Kid Gloves.— Kid gloves that have been dyed 
cannot be cleaned ; the only remedy is re-dyeing. Benzine or naptha 
is excellent for cleaning gloves, but is too strong for delicate colors. 
Stretch them on the hand and apply any cleansing compound, rub 
always in the same direction, using a bit of sponge or soft flannel. 
Delicate colors may be cleaned with a sponge dipped in niilk and 
rubbed lightly over white soap; the oily nature of the milk softens 
the kid. 

Blags Kros may be renewed by touching all the whitened por- 
tions witji a mixture of two parts of black ink to 1 part of sweet 
oU.- Keep this in a bottle with a sponge attached to the cork same 
as the "liquid blacking," which, in an emergency, may be used on 
gloves also. The ink and sweet oil forms an excellent polish for 
ladies' and children's kid boots. A crumb of stale bread rubbed 
over any kind of gloves wiU often clean them nicely. 

Dyeing Gloves Black.— Put a large handful of logwood chips 
into a bowl and cover with alcohol, let stand until it looks strong, 
at least one whole day. Eub all over carefully with a *^'+. of sponge

or flannel, have the glove on the hand, then le.- ury. Eepeat the 
operation and the glove will be black. 

Stained Bed-ticking may be renovated by applying a, paste 
of raw starch and water to the stained portions and allowing to 
dry on. 

Ironing Boards (which no one should be without) may be 
protected from dust by taking two paper flour sacks, cutting the bot- 
tom from one and pasting on the top of the other to form the 
required length. Slip this over the board when putting away. 

Holders. — A piece of burlap of convenient size is nice for 
handling hot pans and kettles with. For ironing holders fold 
pieces of knit underwear into convenient size and thickness, run 
together, slip inside the blanket on ironing board to have ready 
and clean. The tops of worn-out leather shoes, cut in shape and 
covered, are pice for ironing to keep heat from the hands; Make 
the cover so it can be removed for washing. 

To Keep Tubs turn over and pour water on the bottom, 
unless there is a good cellar where they may be kept. 

Clothes for Boiling are very much nicer, put in a large bag ' 
made of sheeting or muslin, there will then be no dang'^' ^rom, 
iron rust', 

DYRS. 
Black Silk, Cotton, Lace or Wool Goods.— 1^'or 4 ^ounds 

of goods take 2 oimces of blue vitriol and 8 ounces of extract of 
logwood, or if prieferred 3 pounds of logwood chips. Put each 
separately in 12 quarts of water. Put the vitriol water in a brass 
kettle if possible. Bring both kettles to the boiling point. Have 
the cloth thoroughly washed out in warm water; dip first in the 
vitriol water, then in the logwood water, and alternately from one 
to' the other until it has been dipped in each threie times. Dry, 
wash in strong suds, rinse in soft water twice that it may not 
"crock." Put a little salt in the last water. Wring out, roll up 
and leave an hour or so before pressing; press on the wrong side 
until perfectly dry. A small piece of copperas is good to add to 
the logwood water. This will pot fade and answers for all materi- 
als but best for woollen goods. t 



476 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

BrOTFU Cotton, Woolen or Silk.— Wash the goods iirst in 
strong s"Dap-Bnds, rinse well, then follow directions. For 5 pounds 
of cloth or yarn take 1 pound of gum catechu, 3 ounces of blue 
vitriol, and 4 ounces of bi-ohromate of potash. Dissolve catechu 
and blue vitriol in sufficient soft water, to cover the goods, bring to 
a scalding heat. Wring the goods out of clear hot water, shake 
out, put in the catechu and vitriol bath. Let them remain three 
hours, ^stirring and airing quite often. Dissolve the bi-chromate 
of potash in enough warm water to cover the goods ; lift from the 
catechu dye and put in the potash dye, scald until the desired color. 
Put them in all at once, but do not crowd them. Stir frequently, 
fifteen minutes is usually enough. Kinse in clear, warm water; 
dry in the shade; use brass, copper or porcelain kettles, but not 
iron. 

Blue for Cotton. — A lasting and beautiful color. Dissolva 
5 ounces of copperas in water sufficient to cover the goods. When 
it reaches scalding point put the goods in and scald one-half hour; 
take out and air ; put clean water in the kettle, enough to cover the 
goods, together with 6 ounces of prussiate of potash. Put in the 
goods thirty minutes. Eemove and add to the kettle 2 ounces of 
oil of vitriol, return the goods and let remain twenty minutes or 
longer if the color is to be dark. This wiU color 5 pounds of cloth. 

Green for Cotton. — First color the goods blue, then take 4 
ounces sugar of lead and 2 oimces bi-chromate of potash and dis- 
solve each separately in ^ pailful of water. Dip the goods from 
one to the other until the desired shade is obtained. This will 
color 5 pounds of goods. Or dye blue first and dip in the yellow 
dye. 

Yellow for Cotton.— For 5 pounds of goods dissolve | pound 
of sugar of lead in hot water. Dissolve ^ pound of bi-chromate 
of potash. Dip in the lead dye, then in the potash until the desired 
shade is obtained. 

Orange for Cotton.— Dye the goods yellow and dip in a 
very strong boiling lime water. Wring out and dip in clear, hot 
rain water. 

Madder B«d. — ^This is a good durable, but not brilliant, red. 
JPor 6 or 7 pounds of goods, 6^ gallons of water, J pound of mad- 



aoUSEKEEPING. 477 

der, 8 ounces of amm, 1 ounce of cream-tartar. Heat half the 
water scalding hot in a brass, copper or porcelain kettle and dis- 
solve in it the alum and cream-tartar. When it boils put in the 
goods and boil two hours, then rinse. Empty the kettle, break the 
the madder small and add to the other three gallons of water. Put 
in the goods and keep scalding hot one hour, stirring pretty con- 
stantly; then increase the fire until they boil five niinutes. Drain 
and rinse in clear water without wringing. Wasb in suds and dry 
in the shade. 

Cochineal. — Take for each pound of goods 2| ounces of alum, 
1| ounces white tartar, put in a brass or porcelain kettle, not iron, 
with sufficient water to cover the goods. Let boil briskly several min- 
utes then put in the goods, which should have been washed clean, and 
ringed in clear water. When the goods have boiled one-half hour 
take out, without wringing, and hang where they will all cool 
alike, without drying. Empty out the alum and tartar water, put 
in fresh for each pound of goods to be dyed, add an ounce of finely 
powdered cochineal. Let this boil .fifteen minutes, add sufficient 
cold water to make lukewarm and to just cover the goods as before. 
Boil one and one-fourth hours. Eemove the goods without wring- 
ing and dry in the shade.' 

OraQge and Salmon. — ^Take as much strong soft soap-suds 
(plain bar soap will do), as will cover the ^[uantity of goods. Tie 
a quantity of annotto in a bag and soak in the suds until it is soft, 
so that enough can be squeezed out to make the suds a deep yellow. 
Put in the articles, which should be clean and bleached free from 
color. Boil until the shade wished. See that the goods are well 
covered with dye. This dye will make a salmon or orange color, 
according to the strength or the length of time the goods are kept 
in. Drain out of the dye, dry quickly in the shade, then wash in 
soap-suds. Do not rinse. 

Straw or Lemon Color.— Fustic or saffron make a good 
straw or lemon color, according to the strength of the dye. Steep 
in soft water in an earthen or tin vessel, strain and set the dye 
with alum. To stiffen the goods, dissolve a little gum-arabic in 
the dye. When it is strained steep the goods in it. 

Slate Colored Dye. — Tea grounds set with copperas mak^ 



478 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

a good slate color. Strain, boil the goods in this and hang up to 
drain and dry 

To Bleach Goods for Dyeing.— Where it is necessary to 
remove the color in an article before dying, wash in hot soap-suds 
or boil in soap-suds until faded. Rinse thoroughly; any soap left 
in will ruin the dye. Goods for dyeing should be clean and free 
from grease. 

Scarlet for WooUVeby Fine). — For 1 pound of goods, take 
^ ounce cream-tartar, ^ ounce well pulverized cochineal, 2^ ounces 
muriate of tin. Boil up the dye and enter the goods. Work them 
briskly ten or fifteen minutes, then boU one and one-half hours, 
stirring the goods slowly while boiling, Wash in clear water and 
dry in the shade. 

Blue for Wool (Quick Peocbss). — For 2 pounds goods, 5 
ounces alum, 3 ounces cream-tartar. Boil goods in this one hour, 
then put them into warm water that has more or less extract of 
indigo in it, according to depth of color desired and boil again until 
the tint suit, adding more indigo if needed. 

Sky Blue (on Silk ok Cotton). — Give the goods as much 
color from a solution of blue vitriol, 2 ounces to 1 gallon water, 
by dipping fifteen minutes. Then run it through lime-water. This 
will make a beautiful and durable sky blue. 

General Bemarks — Everything should be clean. The 
goods should be scoured in soap and the soap rinsed out. Dip 
tkam into water just before putting them into preparations, to pre- 
vent spotting. Soft water should be used, suffioient to cover the 
goods well — this is always understood where quantity is not mentioned. 
When goods are dyed, air, rinse well, and hang up to dry. Do not 
wring silk or merino dresses when scouring or dyeing them. If 
cotton goods arp *o be dyed a light color they should firf^ "^

BOE the patient, sick and! weary with suffering, food should 
be prepared with the utmost care, and served in the 
daintiest manner. 

GoNVALEsoENOB depends much upon the appetite and proper 
food. 

Fevebs require that the patient's strength be kept up; at the 
same time, everything that quickens circulation should be avoided. 
MUk diet is largely resorted to in such cases. 

On giving an invalid a drink of water when the draught must 
be limited, hand him a small glass full. This will satisfy his 
thirst. Never offer a goblet of water in such a case and direct 
how many swallows may be taken. 

Beep tea or'broth should be cooled and the fat carefully re- 
moved before given to an invalid. If there is great haste the fat 
may be very nearly removed by absorbilig it with blotting paper. 
This wUl not necessitate the cooling of the liquid. 

Dishes should be heated if the food is to be served hot, and 
kept cold if to be served cOld., Custards should be set in ice or in 
pans of cold water. 

Nevek leave food standing by a patient with the hope that an , 
appetite may be aroused by its presence. Eemove at once and 
return after an interval in a fresh and attractive manner. 

Have all napkins and towels fresh and clean, and plenty of 
them to shield bedding and clothing. Spread the tray with a 
fresh napkin and ha^ve the china and silver bright and attractive. 

Nevee fiU a cup of tea or coffee more than two-thirds full, 
then there will be no danger of its contents running pver into the 
saucer.

Gruel may be served in a china cup with a handle, using a 
saucer if liked, or in a glass. 

A TIN DISH with a long handle, made so as to fit inside the tea- 
kettle, will be found a great convenience when there is sickness in 
the family. With such a dish at hand, gruel, custard and beef-tea- 
may be prepared without danger of scorching. 

Cbeam forms the most perfect combination of fat and flesh- 
forming food that exists, being both fatty and albuminous in its 
character. 

Wine will be found admitted in no other department of this 
book, and is to be used here only under the instructions of a 
physician. 

Apple Water. — Pare and slice a fine juicy apple. Pour one 
large cupful of boiling water over it. Cover and let stand until 
cold. Or roast 2 nice tart apples ; do not burn. Gut them up and 
pour over them 1 pint of boiling water. Let cool. Either of 
these wiU be found a refreshing drink. They may be sweetened 
slightly if liked, and a couple of cloves may be added. This is 
an excellent drink for a feverish cold and is especially relished bj' 
children. 

Barley Water. — Most excellent for fevers. To f pound ot 
barley allow 1 quart of water. (Pearl barley is the best, but com- 
mon barley can be used.) Add 2 dozen of stoned raisins or a few 
chopped figs. Let boil slowly until reduced one-half. Strain and 
cool, after which the liquor is ready for use. A very little sugai 
and some lemon-peel may be used in place of the raisins, but tha 
raisins are more nutritious. A Httle milk may be addecl if desira- 
■ ble, or a tablespoonful of sherry wine. If the raisins are not 
liked the barley water may be made plain and strained over 9 
tablespoonfuls of currant jelly. This gives a pleasant acid. 

Tamarind Water. — Over 1 glass tumbler of tamarinds pour 
1 pint of cold water. Let stand one hour before using, then strain. 

Currant Jelly Water. — Currant, cranberry or gooseberry 
jeHy can be prepared in same manner as tamarinds. 

Toast Water. — 2 slices of stale bread toasted carefully, a 
perfect brown. Cut in squares and pour over them 1 pint of boil- 
ing water. Stimulants may be added according to the advice at

the physician. A bit of orange or lemon-peel added gives a pleas 
ant flavor, 

Lemou Whey. — Pour into 1 cupful of bbiHng hot milk as 
much lemon juice as will make it quite clear. Add enough hot 
water to make it a pleasant acid and sweeten to taste. Strain and 
drink before going to bed. This is recommended to excite perspirk- 
tion after a chill, and is less heating than the white wine whey so 
often given for that purpose. 

Wine Whey.— Boil 1 pint of milk. Pour into it ^ cupful of 
sour wine. Let it come to a boil again. Take from the fire, let 
stand a few minutes without stirring until the curd settles. Pour 
off the whey and sweeten to taste with white sugar. 

Battermilk Whey.— Boil the required quantity of fresh but. 
termilk. Season with a pinch of salt, a little loaf sugar, and nut- 
meg if liked. Pour the whey off carefully. 

Rennet Whey. — l pint of scalding milk, not boiling; 1 
tablespoonful prepared rennent or a piece of rennet skin that has 
been soaked in water. Sweeten to taste and strain. It will be 
ready for use when cool. 

Egg Milk. — Beat a fresh egg until very light. Stir into a 
glass of new milk. Sweeten to taste and flavor with either nut- 
meg or lemon. Very strengthening. 

Mailed Battermilk. — Boil 1 pint of buttermUk; thicken 
it with 1 tablespoonful flour rubbed smooth in a little cold butter- 
milk. Stir constantly. Add before removing from the fire a 
dozen or so of raisins for the flavor. Sweeten slightly. Pour 
over small piecesof toast, if the patient wishes. 

Mulled Battermilk, (II). — Boil 1 pint of buttermilk; beat 
up ^ an egg and stir in. Boil a minute or so, stirring constantly. 
Throw in a few raisins. Sweeten if wanted. 

Crust Coffee. — Br-own crusts of wheat bread or Graham bis- 
cuits in the oven until thoroughly toasted through, but not burned. 
Break in pieces and pour boiling water over them. Let steep and 
serve as ordinary coffee with cream and sugar. Very wholesome 
for dyspeptics. 

Egg Lemonade. — Beat the white of one egg to a froth ; add 
to it the juice of 1 lemon. Sw«eten, not too sweet, and pour over 
81 



482 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

it 1 pint Ox water. A very pleasant drink in malarial fevers, sum- 
mer diseases and lung troubles. 

Flaxseed Lemonade. — 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of whole 
flaxseed to 1 quart of boiling water. Let stand until it thickens, 
then strain over the juice of 1 lemon and sweeten to taste. Very 
good for colds. A little powdered gum-arabic may be added while 
it is still hot. 

Milk Lemonade. — IJ cupfuleof white sugar dissolved ia one 
quart of boiling water. Add ^ pint of lemon juice, and lastly 1^ 
pints of boiling milk. Drink hot as possible just before retiring. 
Good for colds. Under some circumsta.nces ^ of a pint of the 
milk may be omitted and ^ pint of sherry added. If the patient 
is reduced in strength this will be an improvement. 

Hot Lemonade. — Make the same as cold lemonade, using 
boiling hot water in place of cold water. In case of a severe 
cold drink warm as possible just before retiring. 

Egg Wine. — Beat up a fresh egg until smooth and thick ; add 
a teaspoonful of powdered loaf sugar; stir in a glass of best port 
wille. This, when permitted, is very strengthening. 

Egg Nog. — Beat the yolk of an egg in a tumbler with 2 
teaspoonfuls brandy and the same of sugar measured even. Beat 
the white of the egg to a stiff froth, mix thoroughly with the yolk 
and fill the glass with milk. Some patients cannot take egg and 
must have brandy and milk alone. Others take brandy and egg 
without milk, while the larger number take egg and milk alone. 

Egg Cream. — Beat a raw egg to a stiff froth, add 1 table- 
spoonful white sugar and |- glassful of home-made blackberry or 
black cherry wine ; beat weU, add ^ glassful of cream, beat thor- 
oughly and use at once. This is a full meal for an invalid, and is 
particularly good when trouble of mouth, throat or stomach pre- 
vents use of solid food. 

Water Gruel. — Mix 2 tablespoonfuls Indian meal and 1 of 
wheat flour, with enough cold water to make smooth. Indian meal 
alone may be used if preferred. If the gruel is liked thick, stir 
this mixture into 1 pint of boiling water. If wished thinner more 
water will be necessary. Season the gruel with salt and let boil 
six or eight minutes, stirring frequently; take from the fire, putia 



INVAUD COOKERY. 483 

a piece of butter the size of a walnut, add sugar and nutmeg, if 
wished, and turn over toasted bread cut in dice. A couple dozen 
of raisins boiled in the gruel will improve the flavor. They need 
not be eaten. Very nice for a cold. 

Caudle. — Make a water gruel as above, or a Eice Caudle, 
Strain it and add a wineglassful of wine or brandy, sweeten with 
loaf sugar and grate in a little nutmeg. 

Bice Caudle. — This is an excellent remedy where a sudden 
change has brought on a relaxed condition of the system. 

Soak some rice for an hour in cold water, drain it; put 2 
tablespoonfuls of the rice into 1 pint or more of new mUk. Sim- 
mer until it will pulp through a sieve. Put pulp and milk in a 
saucepan with a bruised clove, a bit of stick cinnamon and Ibaf 
sugar to taste. Simmer eleven minutes longer. If too thick add 
a little milk. ' Serve with exceedingly thin strips of dry toast. 

Milk Porridge. — This can be varied so that an mvalid will 
not weary of it quickly. Put 1 dozen raisins in 2 cupfuls of milk 
(they need not be eaten, but flavor the porridge). Boil the milk 
five minutes, then thicken lightly with wheat flOur. If the patient 
is quite iU very little thickening is required. Wet the flour 
smoothly with a little cold milk and pour into the boiling milk. 
Add a bit of butter. Nutmeg and sugar will please some palates, 
while oliiers will not tolerate them, or even the raisin flavor. 

Milk Porridge (II). — Make porridge as above, remove froE 
the fire and! stir in quicMy the stiffly beaten white of an egg. Very 
nice. 

Milk Oruel. — 1 tablespooninl of Indian meal and 1 of wheat 
flour, rubbed smooth in a little cold milk or water. Pour into 1 
quart of boiling milk. Boil ten minutes, season to the taste with 
butter and salt. Very soothing for a cold. 

Boiled Flour Gruel. — Tie a teacupful of flour closely in a 
cotton cloth. Boil six hours. When cool untie and let it dry in a 
moderate oven. If the outer part remains soft remove carefully. 
When wanted for use grate 2 tablespoonfuls of it and rub smooth 
with a little cold milk. Stir it into 1 pint of boiling mUk, cook 
five miantes, season with salt and sugar to taste. Very good for 
ehJldrsB a&d infants in suKuaer diseases; ^o for older invalids. 



484 THREE MEAI^ A DAY. 

Oatmeal Grnel (Milk).— Mix 2 tablespoonfuls fine fresh 
oatmeal with a pinch of salt and a little cold milk. Pour into it 
gradually ^ pint more milk. Set over the fire in an earthen dish 
or a lined saucepan and stir without intermission. When it boils 
pour in^ cupful more milk and boil twenty minutes. Serve plain 
or, if approved, with a seasoning of loaf sugar and nutmeg or 
cinnamon. 

Gruel is a soothing remedy for a bad cold. 

Oatmeal Gruel (Water). — 2 cupfuls Irish or Scotch oatmeal, 
2 quarts of water, 1 teaspoonf ul salt. Let the oatmeal soak over 
night in half the water, rub through a sieve, add the rest of the 
water with a pinch of salt, boil until it thickens. Let cool to a 
jelly. Serve with a little powdered sugar. Cream may be added 
if permitted. 

Kice GrneL — Mix 2 tablespoonfuls ground rice, smooth with - 
cold water, stir it into 1 pint of boiling milk, boil until thick as' 
good cream, season with a very little butter and salt. Sugar and 
nutmeg may be used according to taste. Serve hot. 

Arrowroot Gmel.— ^Make same as Eice Gruel, taking 1 ounce 
to 1 pint of milk, together with 1 teaspoonful sugar and a pinch 
of salt. 

Arrowroot Jelly. — Wet 2 heaping teaspoonfuls of Bermuda 
arrowroot, stir into 1 cupful of boiling water in which 2 teaspoon- 
fuls white sugar have been dissolved. If bits of lemon peel have 
been boiled in the water before hand it is an improvement. .Stir 
imtil clear, boiling steadily. Wet a cup in cold water and pour in 
the jelly to stiffen. Serve cold with sugar and cream if the state 
of the patient permit; otherwise, serve plain. Milk may be used 
instead of water, to the great improvement of the dish. Boil the 
jelly irntU it thickens well. 

Arrowroot Blanc-mange. — Make same as above, using milk 
instead of water, and taking 1 additional teaspoonful of o'tow- 
root. Dehcious. Flavor to suit. 

Tapioca Jelly. — Soak 2 ounces of tapioca five hours, or over 
aight in ^ pint of cold water, put over the fire with another ^ pint 
of cold water, and when quite thick add |^ tumbler of boiling 
•Wsiifix- boU until the pieces look perfectly clear, then add 2 table- 



INVALID COOKERY. 455 

spoonfuls sugar and flavor (if the physician recommend) with 2 
tablespoonfuls of wine, or 2 teaspoonfula of brandy; otherwise, 
use lemon, boiling the peel of a lemon in the tapioca and remov- 
ing; add a few drops of the juice. Lemon extract maybe used 
instead. Pour in molds and set on ice or in a pan of cold water- 
Serve with cream and sugar, if the state of the patient will per- 
mit, otherwise plain. 

8agO Jelly. — Wash 1 large tablespoonf ul of sago, soak one 
hour, boil It in ^ cupful of water; with a pinch of salt, and a stick 
cinnamon until the grains grow clear; rind of lemon may be sub- 
stituted for the cinnamon. Then add 1 pint of boiling milk, or 
milk and water, boil all together, 'sweeten and set away to cool. 

Sago Padding. — Wash a teacupful of sago, put in the pud- 
ding-dish and pour on 1 quart of boiling water, stirring all the 
time; add a pinch of salt and 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar. Prepare 
it two or three hours before baking, or even over night. Bake 
slowly one hour. Serve with sugar and butter. This will answer 
for convalescents. 

Calf s Toot Jelly.— See Jelly. J cupful of Madeira wine 
may be added when it is especially for invalids. For recipe, see 
page 342. 

Cracker Soap. — Put a bit of butter, the size of a hickory- 
nut, in a bowl, sprinkle in pepper and salt enough to make it pal- 
atable; break in crackers as for oyster aoup, and turn on boiling 
water until the dish is fiUed. This is a substitute for oyster soup, 
and is a very nice dish. Use as much pepper as- possible, if the 
disease is a sore throat. A person in perfect health will relisb 
this dish. 

Bread Panada.— Put 1 ounce of stale bread, cut or crumbed, 
in a bowl. Pour over it J pint of boiling water, let stand an hour, 
sweeten slightly with white sugar. Wine and nutmeg to taste 
may be added under the advice of a physician. 

Crackers may be used instead of bread, or the bread may be 
toasted. 

Chicken Jelly, — Cut J an uncooked chicken in small pieces 
and break the bones. Pour over it 1 quart of water and boil 
slowly until it is reduced to less than half. Seasoo with salt, a 



486 THREE MEAI,S A DAY, 

little peppei and mace (if the latter be allowed). Strain through 
a jelly-bag into a mold. When the jelly has hardened, scrape off 
the layer of fat at the top, turn it upon a fancy dish. If the taste 
of the patient wUl permit, it may be sweetened with loaf sugar, 
and flavored with lemon juice. 

Cracker Dessert. — Put 8 soda or 10 milk crackers into a 
deep dish and pour on boiling water to cover. Let stand until the 
water is absorbed, grate over them nutmeg and white sugar, add- 
ing sulB.cien't milk to make a nice sauce. 

Cracker and Orange Juice. — This is the most refreshing 
and cooling nutriment that can be given a fever patient. Crumb 
crackers into a dish and turn orange juice over them. 

Beef Tea. — 1 pound of lean beef (not one scrap of fat must 
be admitted) cut in small bits and put in a wide-mouthed bottle 
without water; cork closely, set in a kettle of cold water, bring to 
a boU and keep boiling for three or four hours, until the meat in 
the bottle is like white rags. Press out the juice and season with 
a little salt and, if permitted, a suspicion of pepper. This is pure. 

One way to bfeguile an invalid into taking more beef tea than 
he is willing to, is to add gelatine to it and let it cool in a mold. 
When it is hard and like jelly serve it with salt and wafers. 

Beef Tea (Qaick)^— Gut the beef (without fat) in inch bits, 
put in an open saucepan over the fire, with very little water, not 
nearly enough to cover it. Take an iron spoon and press contin- 
ually against the side of the pan until every particle of the juice 
is pressed out, and the meat is white and leathery. Remove the 
meat, and, if the broth must be very 'dear, strain. Season as 
above. Can be prepared in fifteen minutes. 

Beef-steak Tea. — BroU 1 pound of tender, juicy beef-steak 
for two minutes, season it with salt and pepper, cut in small 
pieces, pour over it 1 pint of boiling water, steep one- half hour, 
then press well and pour off the liquid. 

Raw Beef Sandwich.— Scrape, or chop fine, a little raw beef 
from a tender piece, season with pepper and salt, spread on a thin 
slice of thinly buttered bread, cover with another and cut in three 
or four pieces. Very nice and nutritious. 

Chicken Broth. — BoH an ordinary sized chit Icen ia 2 auarts 



INVALID COOKERY. 487 

of water, cracking the bonep before putting in the fowl, (the water 
must be cold at first.) Co-ror and boil until the meat is ready to 
faU to pieces. Strain ; let simmer, adding 4 or 5 tablespoonfnls 
of milk, and a little salt and pepper. A tablespoonful of well 
soaked rice, or pearl barley, maybe added also; boU slowly one-half 
hour if this is done ; serve with dry toast. The meat of the chicken 
will make a very nice chicken salad for the family. 

Sago Soap. — Wash 5 ounces of sago in warm water, set in a 
saucepan with 2 quarts of milk, and simmer until the sago is thor- 
oughly dissolved; season with pepper and salt, and add a small 
cupful of cream before serving. Good clear stock is generally 
used for sago and tapioca soup; but they are even nicer made with 
milk. 

Broiled Chicken or QualT. — Broil the breast only, on both 
sides. Season lightly with pepper, salt and butter. 

Beef Feet. — Put the feet over in cold water and let them come 
to a boil. Take out and remove the loosened hoofs. Soak over 
night in cold water, boil untU tender. Chop fine; season with 
pepper, salt, butter and a' little cream. Heat well through before ' 
serving. A very weak stomach can retain this. Be sure not to 
boil until gluey. 

CodJSsh BeliBh. — Sliver soine codfish fine, put in cold water, 
let come slowly to a boil to freshen it. Boil a moment, turn off 
the water and add hot cream, seasoned lightly with pepper if 
allowable, or rich milk in which a small lump of butter has been 
dissolved. Split and toast a Boston cracker, or a half slice of 
baker's bread from which the crust has been removed, and turn the 
codfish over this. 

Fmit. — Invalids will find it safer to take raw fruit about the 
middle of a meal, other dishes preceeding and following it. CooKed 
fruit may be taken at any period of the meal. 

Scrambled Eggs for Invalids.— For 1 egg allow 3 table- 
spoonfuls boiling water, a little salt and a bit of butter the size of 
a hazel-nut. Stir rapidly from the moment the egg is dropped into 
the water until the mixture is of the consistency of cold, thick 
cream, but do not allow it, to whey. Have ready slices of moist 
buttered toast, put the eggs on the toast and serve. This will not 



488 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

be found too rich for an invalid's stomach, and nice for the family 
as well. 

Paulet a la Creme. — Boil a chicken, chop the flesh to a fine 
powder, rub through a wire sieve ; mix with a little cream and 2 or 
3 beaten eggs. Season with salt and a little pepper if allowable. 
Put in a mold, press down, steam and serve, cut in slices hot or 
cold. A dainty dish for an invalid. 

Buttermilk. — The virtues of buttermUk are claimed to be 
manifold. Among other advantages it possesses a large share of 
the acid which destroys the incrustations that form on the arteries, 
cartilages and valves of the heart, and it is asserted that a constant 
use of it would free the system from troubles which inevitably 
cause death between the 75th and 100th years of man's Ufe. It 
may be used freely and to advantage by every one. 

Another point in ite favor; — ^in churning, the first process of 
digestion is gone through with, making it . one of the easiest and 
quickest of all things to digest. It makes gastric juice, and con- 
tains properties that readUy assimilate with the digestive organs. 

Blackberry Cordial. — To J bushel of blackberries, well 
mashed, add ^ pound of allspice, 2 ounces of cinnamon and 2 
ounces of cloves, all ground. Mix and boil slowly until properly 
done. Strain, or squeeze the juice through flannel, and add to each 
pint 1 pound of loaf sugar. Boil once more, slowly, for one half 
hour. Eemove from the stove, and while cooling add 1 quart of 
the best brandy. Some take 2 quarts of brandy to this amount of 
cordial. Cognac is the best. This is an almost infallible specific 
for all summer diseases. 

Dose.'— For an adult, 1 wineglassful ; for a child, 1 teaspoon- 
fnl, or more, according to age. 





eMERGENCIES will occur in every family, and no house 
should be without appliances necessary in case of accidents 
or sudden illness, and not only that, but these appHaiices 
should be kept together, and in some convenient box, or drawer, 
where they will be readily accessible to every member of the family. 
Among these articles should be included all or part of the following -. 
Camphor. Vaseline. 

Soothing Ointment. Painkiller. 

Arnica. Lime and Sweet Oilfor Bums. 

Cotton batting. Court plaster. 

Bandages, cut and rolled, of different widths. 
EoU of old flannel for hot applications. 
Adhesive Plasters. Made Mustard Plaster. 

Bits of old Linen. 
A pair of sharp scissors. 
Such conveniences may save life, and will save a great deal of 
confusion and fright. 

There are other articles tnat could be added with propriety. 
One of these is a couple of flannel bags filled with hops, ready for 
use. 

Hot Applications.— The best way of applying these is to 
steam them first. This is a much better way than to scald and 
stain the hands by wringing out of hot water. Where a pimple 
hot application is to be made, wrirag a cloth out of warm water. 
Apply, and lay over this a heated plate, or better still, a hot stpve 
lid rolled in a cloth. This is a very convenient method and will 
not require to be changed as frequently, one application in mild 
cases being all that is necessary. It will be found that sand-bags 
are useful, in this way, and for foot-warmers also. Make of 



490 • THREE MEALS A DAY. 

flannel that the sand may not sift through. Have a cotton outside 
case for washing. Heat in the oven. India rubber water bottles 
partially filled may be used also. 

The Sick Boom> — Insist upon the most perfect cleanliness, 
and secure as far as possible a supply df pure air. Ventilate the 
room at least once a day. 

OaTry the bed-clothing into the open air, if dry weather, if 
not into another room. If the patient is unable to sit up, in the 
meanwhile, let others be supplied. 

Keep the room quiet and in perfect order. 

Address the patient gently, and any conversation that may be 
allowed, be pleasant and cheering in tone. 

Never tell discouraging stories. 

Never whisper in th« room. 

AH vials and powders should be labeled lio prevent mistakes. 

Daily sponge baths should be made use of where the case 
admits. Change the garments frequently and rinse the mouth 
often. 

A pleasant and agreeable nurse should always be chosen. 

Never dispute with a very sick person, nor reprove him for 
any inconsistency. Eemember he is not a responsible being. 

Contagious diseases need still greater precautions. Small pox, 
scarlet fever and diptheria particularly. Remove the patient to a 
separate apartment, as near the top of the house as possible, from 
which remove curtains, carpets, bed-hangings, all woolen articles, 
and other needless articles. Wooden chairs, a table, a plain single 
bed and a lounge for the convenience of the nurse, are aU. the 
needful articles. Afterward everything that is not disinfected 
should be burned. No one should be admitted to the room except 
the medical attendant and nurse. 

Chloride of lime and other disinfectants should be plentifully 
used, and a little chloride of lime solution should be put in the 
water that the nurse uses for bathing her hands. Rinse in pure 
water. 

Disinfectants. — Coffee roasted, ground and sprinkled on live 
coals or a hot shovel is one of the best known disinfectants, re- 
moving instantly all manner of animal and vegetable efHuvia. 



HEALTH. 491 

Sitaply putting the ground roasted coffee on plates, in rooms to 
be disinfected is very siieoessful, and sprinkling in drains or sinks. 

S-ECOND. — Onions sliced and put in a sick-room where there is 
any contagious disease are a vajuable antiseptic. Eeplaoe every 
hour with a fresh one, burning the old. It is astonishing the 
rapidity with which one wiU shrivel away. 

It has been repeatedly observed that an onion-patch in the im- 
mediate vicinity of a house acts as a shield against pestilence, but 
during an epidemic a confirmed eater ,should, however, eschew his 
usual diet, as the germs of the disease are present in the onions 
and contagion may easily result. 

Outside the door of the sick-room suspend' a sheet so as to 
cover the entire doorway. This should be kept constantly wet 
with a solution of chloride of lime. This ^Si keep every other 
part of the house free from infection. 

To Cool a SiC-k-room when oppressively warm, hang wet 
towels or canvas in -windows and doors. This will speedily lower 
the temperature five or six degrees, besides rendering the air moist 
and agreeable. Charcoal is an invaluable antiseptic used in sick- 
rooms or crowded sleeping rooms. A dozen pieces the size of 
hazel-nuts placed in a saucer and daily' moistened with boiling 
water, will, in the course of a week, have gathered their own 
weight in impurities, when they , should be burned and fresh 
taken. 

Poisons and their Antidotes.— In cases where the other 
articles to be used as antidotes are not in the house, give 2 table- ' 
'spoonfuls made mustard in a pint of warnl water. Also give 
large draughts of warm milk or water mixed with oil, butter or 
lard. If possible, give as follows: 

Fob Bed-Bitg Poison, Blue VrrEiOL, Coekosive Sublimate, 
Lead Wateb, Saltpeter, Sugab of Lead, Sulphate of Zinc, Bed 
Peecipitate, Veemilion.^ — Give milk or white of eggs,, in large 
quantities. Wheat flour and water. 

NiTEATE OF Potash. — Alum and cathartics. ^ Castor oil, Epsom 



Foe Fowlee's Solution, White Precipitate, Aesenic— Give 
prompt emetic of mustard and salt, tablespoonf ul of each ; follow 



492 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

•with sweet oil, butter or milk. White of eggs, chalk and water 
for arsenic. 

Foa Antimonial Wine, Tartab Emktic. — Drink warm water to 
encourage vomiting. If vomiting does not stop, give a grain of 
opium in water. Use a tea made of white oak bark or Peruvian 
bark. 

Foe On, op Vitrioi., Aqua Foetis, Bi-Oaebonate Potassa, Muei- 
ATic Aero, OxAuo Aoro. — Magnesia or soap, dissolved in water, 
every two minutes. 

Foe Caustic Soda, Caustio Potash, VoLATttE Alkali, Steong 
Lime Water. — Drink freely of water with vinegar or lemon juice 
in it. 

Foe Carbolic Acid. — Give flour and water or glutinous drinks. 

Foe Chloeal Hydrate, Chloeofoem. — Pour cold Water over 
the head and face with artificial respiration, galvanic battery. 

Foe Caebonatb of Soda, Copperas, Cobalt. — Prompt emetics; 
soap and water or mucilaginous drinks. 

For Laudanum, Morphine, Opium. — Strong coffee followed by 
ground mustard or grease in warm water to produce vomiting. 
Keep in motion. 

Foe Niteate of Silver, Lunae Caustic. — Give common salt 
in water. 

For Stetohnine, Tinctuee Nux Voihca. — Emetic of mustard 
or sulphate of zinc, aided by warm water. Camphor also is an 
effective antidote for strychnine. Administer 5 or 6 grains at a 
time in an emulsion, flaxseed tea for instance. 

Alcohol. — An emetic; then dash cold water on the head and 
give ammonia in a little water. 

Ammonia. — Lemon juice or vinegar, afterward milk and water 
or Flaxseed tea. 

Creosote. — White of eggs and emetics. 

Belladonna oe Nib-ht Henbane. — Emetics; then vinegar and 
and water or lemonade. 

Veedigeis. — Plenty of white of egg and water. 

Tobacco. — First an emetic, then astringent teas, then stimu- 
lants. 

Fbussio Acid. — When there is time administer chlorine in Uie

ahape of soda or lime. Hot brandy and water and hartshorn 
and turpentine are also useful. 

MusHBOoMs (Poisonous) Emetics ;^ then plenty of vinegar 

and water, with a dose of ether, if handy. 

Chaeooal, All Caebonio Gases. — Eemove the patient to the 
open air; dash cold water on the head and body, stimulate the 
nostrils and lungs by hartshorn, rubbing the chest briskly. 

Most, but not all, poisons call for an emetic. Those given at 
the beginning are the best and most easily accessible. A pint of 
warm water with a tablespoonfui of ground mustard and a table- 
spoonful of salt stirred in works quickly. Use no ceremony in 
administering this. Seize the patient's nose firmly, when, as a 
natural consequence, the mouth opens; turn the emetic down. 
Use cold water if warm is not convenient. After this has wo];ked, 
it it is not known what^the poison is, or if no. other antidotes are 
handy, give first the white of an egg and follow with a cupful of 
strong coffee. A pint of sweet oil will nullify a large number of 
poisons. Melted lard or butter may take its place. Warm mUk 
and water is good; flaxseed and slippery-elm tea, chalk and 
water. Also convulsions from an over-loaded stomach may be 
relieved by an emetic. 

Hot Water, or liquids taken into the mouth or swallowed, 
may be relieved by gargling with borax water. (Dissolve an ounce 
of pulverized borax in a quart of soft water.) Give also slipperj'- 
elm tea, and a little olive oil occasionally. 

Wonnds and Accidents.— Incised wounds are those inflicted 
by sharp cutting instruments. Close as soon as possible. Apply 
slight pressure until the blood has stopped and hold in place with 
strips of adhesive plaster, and then bind up with soft linen. 

Severed Arteries are indicated by the blood coming in jets 
or spurts from the wound, and the sooner a physician is on the 
spot the better. While waiting tie a handkerchief loosely around 
near the wound, between it and the heart. Put a stick between 
the handkerchief and the skin, twist it around until the blood 
ceases to flow. If the wound is in a position where the handker- 
chief cannot be used, press the thumb on a spot near the eut, 
between it and the heart. Increase the pressure until the 



494 /HREE MEALS A DAY. 

bleeding ceases, but do not lessen the pressure an instant until 
the doctor arrives. Every one should understand and remember 
these rules, as in default of them speedy death will be the result. 

Bleeding of Severe Cuts may often be stopped by the appli- 
cation of quantities of salt and flour, spread on thickly. This 
will answer in a moderate cut always. Cobwebs are used suc- 
cessfully also. 

Contused Wounds are those from blunt or rough instruments, 
making torn, irregular incisions. Care should be taken to remove 
by washing or otherwise all outside matter from the wound, and 
to place the parts as nearly as possible in their proper positions. 
Then, after stopping the effusion of blood by slight pressure, wipe 
dry and apply adhesive straps, the same as in incised wounds ; as 
the surface of the wound has been more seriously injured, there 
wiU be more reaction. Keep the wounded part immersed in hot 
water, as hot as can be borne, until the inflammation has sub- 
sided. This may be done even before the adhesive plasters are 
applied. Where the case is serious this will be found to act like 
a charm in relieving the pain and inflammation; then keep on 
cotton batting wet in hot water. Cures have been effected ia this 
manner where amputation has seemed necessary. Keep it up until 
the inflammation has subsided. If cold water is aU that is attain- 
able, apply it by means of compresses kept wet. A few drops of 
laudanum ia the water wUl help to relieve the pain. 

Punctured Wounds made by any sharp point, as a needle, 
pin, thorn, sharp nail, etc., often become very painful and sup- 
purate—sometimes involving the whole limb. It should be uni- 
versally known that to pound the part immediately after the punc- 
ture, giving it several smart taps with almost any obj-ect within 
reach, will invariably prevent the subsequent soreness and sup- 
puration. The pain will be increased by the pounding, for a 
minute or two, but very soon after all pain and soreness wUl dis- 
appear. Trifling as this may seem to some, it may nevertheless, 
if heeded, prevent a case of loek-jaw. 

BraiS6S treated with hot water will be apeefdi^ relieved. (See 
Linaim^it for Bruises.) 

To Prevent Discoloration of tbe sMu aHi&c a lamis^, Mke 



HEALTH. 495 

as above in hot water, and then apply molasses sprtttd on paper or 
linen. No mark will be left. Or make a paste of dry starch and 
cold water and put on the injured part. 

Sprains are also best treated with hot water. Poiir it from 
a distance upon the sprained joint. Use water as hot as can be 
Dorne, persisting until the inflammation and swelling have sub- 
sided. Then bandage and use some simple remedy. 

Stings of Bees and other insects. Put a little common baking 
soda in a wine-glassful of vinegar and bathe the part affected. Im- 
mediate relief follows, and no pain or swelling will ensue. Olive 
or sweet oil also affords relief, and fresh earth bound on is certain 
and sure relief. 

Clothing Taking Fire. — Although a fire, keep cool; act 
promptly, smother the flames, if possible. Circumstances will 
have much to do with the manner of doing this. Pressing oi 
folding a heavy blanket or garments down over the fire; rolling 
over and over ; or, if by any means it can be accompHshed, dis- 
robe, get out of the burning garments. No doubt many persons 
have lost their lives by fire from yielding to fright. Presence of 
mind is of absolute importance in aU cases. 

Lock-jaw, To Prevent. — For a flesh wound, throw a handful 
of wool or woolen rags upon a shovelful of hot coals and smoke 
the wounded part until relief is obtained, which is usually in a few 
minutes. This treatment prevents all danger of lock-jaw, at the 
same timo removes the pain and inflammation. Let woolen rags 
be always at hand for this purpose. Wounds made by tfae claws 
and teeth of an enraged cat, rusty nails or rake-tines, all yield to 
this treatment, no matter how severe the pain. Sometimes, the 
smoke of common brown sugar may be used in this -nray. 

Lock-jaw, To Cure.— Warm a small quantity of spirits of 
turpentine and pour upon the wound. Belief will follow in less 
than a minute. 

Lock-jmr, To Cure,(IL)— 1 ounce of lobelia seed, pounded 
fine, 2 ounees «f Cayenne pepper, i pint of hot drops. Put in a 
bottle and skake w^ll before using. Pour a little into the mouth, 
betweeen the teeth and cheek. It will relax the spasms as soon as 
itt^uches the glands or roots of the tongue, and the jaws will 



496 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

loosen. It goes through the system like electricity, excites per- 
spiration in the patient. Give a dose of the above as soon as the 
spasms abate, and use pennyroyal tea for a frequent drink. 

Hydrophobia. — The above lobelia mixture is said to be a cure 
for hydrophobia, it having been used also on mad dogs them- 
selves. 

Another cure that the newsps pers have heralded far and wide 
■with the attested names of various reliable persons, is one that 
cannot be too widely circulated. Immediately after being bitteji 
take 1^ ounces of elecampane ( a plant known to most persons), 
slice and bruise, put in a pint of fresh milk, boil down to J pint, 
and, when cold, drink, fasting for at least six hours afterward. 
The green root is, perhaps, better, but the dried, to be found at any 
drug store, will answer. The next morning, before eating, repeat 
the dose, using 2 ounces of the root. Fast six hours afterward. 
On the third morning take another dose, prepared as before. Fol- 
low the same rules. This is sufficient. The root, it is supposed, 
contains some principle that neutralizes the deadly poison of the 
bite, while fresh milk itself is an antidote for many poisons. 

Rattlesnake Bites. — Moisten fresh earth with water or 
sahva and bind on the wound immediately, changing every quarter 
of an hour. Tie a handkerchief tightly above the wound, to pre- 
vent the poison spreading, keep the patient quiet, and send for 
enough whisky to completely s'tupefy him as quickly as possible. 
Eecovery is usually sure. Or cut a small gash in the wound and 
apply hydrochloric acid. This is sure without the whisky. 

Snake Bites of Any Description.— Have the wound well 
washed with ammonia and then sear in every part withlunar caus- 
tic, every portion, especially the deep-seated portions. It is well 
to take large draughts of sweet oil also. In districts infested with 
reptiles such antidotes should be always on hand. 

Washing the wound with a strong solution of salt and water, 
and, in bad cases, inserting salt in the wound itself is also recom- 
mended, and it is well to resort to it in the absence of other rem- 
edies. 

Burns and Scalds.— Common wadding will take the pain 
from bums or scalds. Simply open a piece of cotton and put 



HEAI,TH, 497 

OH the burned place. If the burn is very bad, put sweet oil on the 
cotton, pouring it on the outside. Do not attempt to 'remove the 
Cotton until it comes oflf itself. Castor oil is very cooling to use 
in place of s"weet oil. 

Second. — A simple covering of common wheat fleur is un- 
equaled for a bumi The moisture produced upon the surface of a 
burn is at once absorbed by the flour and forms a paste which shuts 
out the air, and at the same time keeps the covering moist and 
flexible. If the barn is very bad and the covering becomes dry, it 
should be washed off carefully, a little at a time, and fresh flour 
used. 

TmED. — Scraped potatoes are also a very cooling application, 
Change frequently. 

PoTJBTH. — Molasses will give immediate relief. Saturate cot- 
ton batting or cloth with it and bind on . 

Fifth. — Sprinkle the burned surface thickly with baking- 
soda, or make a saturated solution of the soda; wring cloths from 
it and apply, changing as they become dry. When the pain is 
relieved remove, and use an absorbent dressing if the burn is a 
very deep one. 

Sixth. — A deep burn should have the following dressing: 
Spread gauae thickly with an ointment. Either of those given 
below are very satisfactory, the Balm of Grilead salve being unsui;- 
passed. Cover the gauze with cotton; absorbent cotton is best. 

Burnt alum powdered is the best thing in the world to put 
into an old sore, especially if there is any proud flesh in it. 

Large Surface Barns are frequently treated with sweet oil 
and hme water, equal parts of each. Mix and keep on hand for 
use. 

Carron [Oil. — l pound of lime will make a quart of lime 
water. Pour off the lime water, add the oil, and beat to a cream. 
Linseed oil can be used with an equally good effect. Wring cloths 
out of this and apply, covering with oiled silk or paper. Balm of 
Gjlead ointment, though, is unsurpassed as a cooling and healing 
applieation. Apply in the same way as Carron oil. 

White of Eggs can be applied to burns as a cooling cover- 
ing; this keeps out the air and prevents pain and inflammation. 



49? THREE MEALS A DAY. 

VasdJne, sweet cream and even a coating of mucilage are usefal 
in the case of sKght burns. 

Balm of Gilead Ointment— Put Balm Gilead buds in 
water, a little more than will cover them. Boil an hour. Pick out 
the buds and add J pound of mutton tallow, and ^ pound of lard 
to 1 pint of the liquid. Boil until thick. Unrivaled for any pur- 
pose for which a salve is required. 

Golden Salve.— 1 pint of linseed oil, f pound of rosin, | 
pound of bees-wax. Melt thoroughly and turn in tin boxes. One 
of the best salves known for bums, scalds, or any injury for which 
a salve is needed. 

Poison Ivy (Eemedv foe). — Dissolve a bit of sugar of lead 
the size of a hazel-nut, in half a cupful sweet milk, or warm 
water. Apply as warm as can be used, with a soft bit of old linen. 
Three or four applications are sufficient for a cure. If the poison 
is on the face, this astringent wash may be applied constantly. It 
is a marvelous cure. Sugar of lead should be kept in the house 
labeled, and closely covered to keep the strength. Tincture of 
lobeha is a good application, and copperas dissolved in water is 
useful also. 

MRDIGINRS. 

Infusions are made by adding a pint of boiling water to aa 
ounce of the plant previously bruised and mashed. Af ber standing 
for two or three hours in a covered vessel, the mixture is strained. 
Most infusions exert a greater, effect when taken warm. 

Decoctions are made by adding a pint and a half of water to 
an ounce of the plant, boiling down to 1 pint, and straining. 

Extracts are made by adding a small amount of alcohol to 
the bruised leaves or other parts of the plant. The juice is thus 
extracted, and is placed in a warm place to evaporate until it 
becomes as thick as honey. 

Blood Purifier. — 6 ounces fluid extract sarsaparilla,6 ounces 
fluid extract stillingia, 1 drachm iodide potassium. Mix. Prepare 
for use by taking ^ of the mixture to J' syrup (made of sugar and 
water as for table use). Shake up before using; 1 teaspoonfol is a 



HEALTH, 499 

dose for a child two years old. Use more or less according to the 
age. 

Red ClOTCr tea is excellent for the blood. Gather the blos- 
soms and dry them; make into a strong tea and use for a constant 
drink. Unrivaled in scrofula and other blood diseases. A tea of 
dried or fresh -whortleberries is recommended by some. 

Boot Tea for the Blood.— Dandelion and sarsaparilla, each 
1 drachm of dried root, pulverized. Put into a pitcher and pour 
over it 1 pint of boiling water at night, drink the next day at 
intervals. Do this for one month, the effect will be very good. 

Salt Bheum. — 1 ounce of sa,ltpeter, 1 pint of rum. Mix; 1 
teaspoonful three times a day before eating. Very good, cooling to 
the blood. 

Alteratiye Blood Purifler.— 

12 ounces Honduras sarsaparilla. 
6 ounces guaiacum shavings. 
4 ounces wintergreen leaves. 
4 ounces sassafras root or bark. 
4 ounces elder flowers. 

3 ounces yellowdock root. 

4 ounces burdock root. 
6 ounces dandelion root. 

2 ounces bitter sweet root. . 

Bruise all and put in a suitable vessel, add 1 pint of alcohol 
with water enough to cover the roots, stand in a warm place four 
days. Pour off 1 pint of the tincture and set aside; add 1 quart 
of water to the remainder and boU awhile, turn off" and add another 
quart of water and boil down, pour off again (the two last 
together should be about 1 quart). Strain and add the previous 
pint of liquor, put over the stove with 2^ pounds of crushed sugar' 
and simmer to form of a syrup. Dose; 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls one- 
half hour before meals, or at bed time. This is unrivaled in scro- 
fula and other blood diseases. 

Erysipelas, Certain Cure for.— 4 ounces of sweet spirits of 
nitre, 2 drachms iodide of potash. Mix, rub over the inflamed 
portion with a soft cloth dipped jn the mixture, dampening the 
entire affected surface every hour. When the bathed suface 



500 1*HREE MEALS A DAY. 

becomes an ashy color do not moisten that part any more. Be sure 
that none of the liquid gets in the eyes or mouth. Take salts three 
times a £(ay in small doses. 

Second. — Those afflicted with this disease, would find a great 
relief, and also preventative, in 1 tablespoonful of salts and 1 
tablespoonM cream-tartar put in a large cup and filled with hot 
water. Of this drink one large swallow every morning before 
breakfast, whenever the stomach is not quite right, as this is good 
for dyspepsia also. 

CottSmnption. — Take a large handful of hoarhound and make 
a tea as strong as possible ; take an equal sized handful of mullein 
leaves and make a tea in the same manner. Then take 1 cupful 
of the hoarhound tea, and 1 cupful of the mullein tea, mix, put in 
a sauce-pan and add 1 cupful of molasses; boil to a syrup, the 
quicker the better. Take a large swallow three ti.mes a day. A 
cure will be guaranteed in all cases not too far advanced. 

ConsnmptiTe Night Sweats.— Sponge the body of the 
patient off at night with strong salt and water, or give the follow- 
ing preparation: ^ ounce essence of tansy, ^ ounce water, J 
ounce alcohol, 15 grains quinine, 80 drops muriatic acid. Mix, 
dose, 1 teaspoonful in ^ cupful of sage tea twice a day and always 
at night. It is asserted by many that a large flat pan of cold water 
set under the bed on the side occupied by the patient will effectually 
cure when everything else fails. 

Coagh Syrup. — 1 ounce thoroughwort, 1 ounce slippery elm 
bark, 1 ounce stick liquorice, 1 ounce flaxseed. Simmer in 1 quart 
of water untU all the strength is out. Strain, and add 1 pint of 
the best molasses,^ pound of loaf sugar; simmer well together. 
When cold, bottle. 

Flaxseed Syrup, or Lemonade for Coughs and Whooping 
Cough. — Boil 1 ounce of flaxseed in 1 quart of boiling water one- 
half hour. Strain and add to the liquid the juice of 2 lemons and 
J pound of rock candy (loaf sugar may be used but the candy is 
better). If the cough is accompanied by weakness and loss of 
appetite, aid ^ ounce of gum arable. Set this to simmer one-half 
hour, stirring ooisasionaLLy. Take a wine-glassful whenever the 



HEALTH. 501 

cough is troublesome. For whooping cough give after every 
paroxysHi. 

Cough Mixtures. — l tablespoonful molasses, 1 tablespoonful 
of castor oil, 1 teaspooBful oamphor, 1 teaspooaful of paregoric. 
Mix together, and take a teaspoonful before bed time, and before 
each meal. 

Second, — Hot honey, 1 teaspoonful every one-quarter hour, 
will break up the -worst cold in one day. It will also relieve severe 
spasms of asthma. The constant Use of honey keeps the throat 
in a healthful state, and it cannot be too highly recommended as 
an article of diet. Eubbing turpentine on the chest is also a relief. 

Colds (To Cuke). — When the first symptoips are felt imme- 
diately remove shoes and stockings and put the feet to the fire, not 
merely warming but keeping them as hot as can be borne for half an 
hour. If done soon enough this will arrest any cold. If this can- 
not be done, wrap up the shoulders and throat in a heavy woolen 
shawl, pinning closely, even partly over the head, and re;main so, 
if possible, until bed time, or at least until all chilly sensations 
disappear. A hot foot bath, or even a hot hand bath, is often 
effectual. A drink of hot lemonade on retiring, or almost any hot 
tea, sage, etc. Such means as these are often the "stitch in time.'' 
By waiting until morning the cold is settled, and time and patience 
will be required for its cure. 

Catarrh Recipe (Inhalation). — 12 grains carbolic acid, 1 
ounce of chloroform, 12 grains iodine crystals. Mix in a bottle 
and inhale three times a day. 

Catarrh Snnlf. — Equal parts of pulverized sugar and finely 
ground borax. Use frequently — very helpful, especially so in a bad 
cold. 

Croup. — Turpentine is a sovereign remedy for^ croup. Satu- 
rate a piece of flannel with it and place the flannel on the throat 
and chest, and, in very severe cases, 3 or 4 drops on a lump of 
sugar may be taken inwardly. Every familj- should have a bottle 
on hand. 

A warm bath will frequently relieve the worst paroxysm ; or 
bathing the feet in hot water and rubbing with heated flannels, 
fenall doses of hive syrup may be used as an emetio. 



503 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Diphtheria. — This formidable disease is comparatively man- 
ageable, if one fact is kept in view. The white secretion in the 
throat is poisonous to the blood, if swallowed. A sore throat, with 
patches of white on the tonsils just back of the root of the tongue 
indicates its approach. Fill a tumbler haK full of salt, fill up 
with water, stir until the solution is strong as possible. Tie a 
soft sponge or rag securely on a notched stick, for a swab, and 
saturate it with the brine, and pass it well back in the throat be- 
hind the white patches, and wipe them off clean, bringing out of 
the mouth. Einse the swab each time before putting back in the 
mouth, and, to keep the brine clean, pour some to use in a sepa- 
rate dish. Repeat this as often as the mucus forms. If there is 
more than one patient have a separate swab for each one. It will 
be well also to fill a hose half full of salt, wet it with cold water 
and apply to the throat so that the salt will extend from ear to 
ear. Lemon juice is a very good gargle. 
-Diphtheria Wash. — 

Golden seal, pulverized, 1 drachm. 

Borax, pulverized, 1 drachm. 

Black pepper, pulverized, 1 drachm. 

Alum, pulverized, 1 drachm. 

Nitrate of potash, pulverized, 1 drachm. 

Salt, pulverized, 2 drachms. 
Put aU in a common teacup and pour half fuU of boiling 
water. Stir and fill ve^ with good vinegar. Fit for use when it 
settles. 

Make a swab according to first directions and use in the same 
manner. Let the patient swallow a little each time. Swab thor- 
oughly every half hour, if the patient is bad, if not every hour. 
When better, every two hours, then every four hours, then two or 
three times a day until well, which will be from two to seven 
days. This will never fail if taken before the diphtheria membrane 
extends into the air tubes. At the same time rub the following 
liniment on the throat outside, every three or four hours, keeping 
a flannel cloth outside : 

1 ounce spirits of turpentine. 
i oimce of aqaa ammonia. 



HEALTH. 503 

1 ounce of sweet or linseed oil. 

Mix; shake before using. Give small doses of castor oil. If 
a common sore throat should be mistaken for diphtheria, no matter, 
it will cure it almost invariably. This is a well known physiciar'ff 
prescription. Teach a child to gargle the throat when well and it 
will be a great assistance in illness.' 

Second. — Take a shovelful of hot coals and sprinkle over theaa 
1 or 2 tablespoonfuls of flower of sulphur, and put the shovel 
under the bed. Remove as soon as the patient begins to cough. 
Try this two or three nights and it will be found that the fumes of 
the sulphur will destroy the fungus called diphtheria. 

Quinsy. — Use camphor. Simply wet the finger in it and 
iapply it to |the tonsils every few minutes; It will relieve very 
quickly. 

Hay Fever, Rose ICold. — Use a mild solution of borax, 
salt and muriate of ammonia, in a cupful of soft water; add a droij 
of carbolic acid and 1 or 2 drops of camphor. Snuff up the nose 
and use as a gargle. 

Second. — Mix 3 drops each of peppermint oil, oil of rosemary, 
oil of cloves and any other pungent oil ; put in a tiny bottle and 
inhale occasionally to clear the head. 

Canker in Month or Throat. — 1 drachm of chlorate of 
potash in 1 cupful of warm water. Use for a gargle. 

Whooping Cough. — Give the Flaxseed Syrup after every 
paroxysm, and when the disease is at its height put 1 oimce of the 
strongest liquid of ammonia in a gallon of boiling water poured in 
an open pan, and the steam kept up by means of half a brick 
made thoroughly red-hot and dropped in the pan. Put this in th6 
room and let the patient inhale the ammoniated steam. This will 
soon end the cough. 

A Fish Bone swallowed accidentally may be carried safely 
down the throat by taking the raw wliite of an egg as quickly as 
possible. 

Bheumatisni. — Serving asparagus as the chief article of diet 
and avoiding all acids in food or drink, wUl effect great relief in a 
few days. This plant, the Jerusalem artichoke, etc., all natural'? 
growing near the sea, contains iodine, a rheumatic specific. 



50Z^ THREB MEALS A DAY. 

Ceimf^ also, boiled in milk or water and eaten, with aiilk or 
water served as a beverage, is very belpM in the saine disease. 
Eaten in any form it will be found healthful. In Germany they 
boil the root and stalks, and then eat it as a salad with oil and 
vinegar. 

Nervousness. — Nervous people are greatly benefited by a 
diet of celery. Onions are next best. Parsley with vinegar re- 
moves the effects of eating onions. No medicine is really so effi- 
cacious in case of nervous prostration, and they tone up a worn- 
out system in a very short time. 

Bhenmatism No. (II.) — Take 6 large onions to a pint of mo- 
lasses, steep until a thick syrup is formed. Take every two or 
three hours. Persevere and success will foUow. A tea of burdock 
roots, or burdock leaves, may be taken at the same time vrith good 
effect. 

For an outward application, a flannel bag filled with arnica 
blossoms, and heated in a steamer, may be applied to the spot. 

Rheumatic Application. — l part oil of peppermint and 2 
parts of alcohol. Apply to the affected parts. The relief is almost 
instantaneous. Shake well, and keep the bottle closely corked. 

Wormwood Liniment. — Make the liniment strong as pos- 
sible with good vinegar and wormwood, adding a piece of salt- 
jpeixe the size of a hickory-nut to J pint of the liquid. This is 
good also for a weak or sprained back. 

Little Giant Linament.— 

2 ounces of laudanum. 

2 drachms oil of sassafras. 

2 drachms oil of cedar. 

2 drachms spirits of turpentine. 

2 drachms of gum camphor. 

2 drachms tincture of capsicum. 

1 pint of alcohol. 

Balm of Oilead Tincture (Fob Cuts or Betjises). — Fill 
a 4-ounce bottle one-fourth full of Balm of Gdlead buds, fill up the 
bottie with aleohol. Let stand a week. The result is a tincture 
in many respects superior to arnica, especially in raw sores. 

Neuralgia. — Put 1 teaspoouful of ammonia in a cup and fill 



HEALTH. 505 

with boiling water. Take a teaspoonful every half hour for two 
hours. Behef is almost certain. This is good for all nervous 
pains, earache, toothache and headache. Never take ammonia in 
any quantity, as it is injurious. Pure alcohol is also a relief. 
Bathe the face with it, and inhale also. Also put a few drops on 
a lump of sugar and eat the sugar, or put a teaspoonful in ^ cup- 
ful of hot water, sweeten slightly and drink by degrees. To cure 
neuralgia, relieve as much as possible and take great care of the 
health and general circulation. Bathe carefully, dress warmly and 
loosely. Never over-exert mind or body and neuralgia will grad- 
ually disappear. A cut lemon rubbed on 'the affected part will 
often relieve. 

Sciatica and Neuralgia. — Heat a flat-iron or a brick and 
cover it with two or three thicknesses of flannel wrung but of strong 
vinegar, and apply to the painful spot. Bepeat the operation two 
or three times a day. As a rule, the pain disappears within 
twenty-four hours, and recovery follows quickly. This is simply an 
improvised electric apparatus. 

Felons. — A deep-seated, throbbing pain in the end of the 
finger should never be disregarded. This is the first symptom of 
a felon. Dip the finger quickly into boihng water several times in 
succession. This may be done without any risk of scalding. 
Bepeat every hour for several hours, and the cure is generally 
complete. 

Seoond. — Procure several lemons. Cut a small opening in 
the end of one and push the finger in. Keep it there until the 
lemon ceases to draw, then apply another, and keep on until the 
pain is relieved, 

Thied. — Heat 1 teaspoonful of table salt until perfectly dry. 
Add to it 1 teaspoonful of castile soap cut fine, and mix with 1 
teaspoonful of Venice turpentine. Apply to the felon. Eenew 
twice a day. A sure cure. If the felon has been opened, or there 
ia danger of losing the bone or a joint, apply the poultice, and this 
will effect a speedj cure. 

Fourth. — Put directly over the throbbing spot a fly blister the 
size of a fioger'Hail. Let remain sis hours. At the expiration of 



5o6 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

this time the felon may be seen directly tinder the surface of the 
blister, and can be easily removed with a pin or penknife. 

Chest Protectors. — Make of muslin, lined with two thick- 
nesses of flannel; quUt together that they may be easily washed. 

Pain-Killer.— 

1 ounce spirits of camphor. 
^ ounce tincture of guaiac. 
^ ounce tincture of myrrh. 

1^ ounce tincture of capsicum. 
4 ounces alcohol. 

2 ounces brandy. Mix. 

ChoM'a Mixture. — Take equal parts of tincture of capsicum, 
tincture of opium, tincture of rhubarb, essence of peppermint and 
spirits of camphor. Mix and put in a small vial to carry in the 
pocket. Dose — fifteen to twenty drops in a wine-glass of water. 
Eepeat at quarter-hour intervals until relief is obtained. Even 
where no cholera is anticipated it is an excellent thing for ordinary 
summer diseases. 

Summer Diseases (Chronic Cases). — ^ ounce gunpowder, ^ 
ounce alum, J ounce saltpeter, ^ ounce cream- tartar, J ounce 
flower of sulphur. Pulverize separately. Mix and sift through a 
fine cloth. Take | teaspoonf ul for a dose. - It may be mixed, if 
wished, with a little vinegar and water. A tried cure. 

Secoio). — For more simple cases, mix a teaspoonful of flour 
smooth 'in a glass, then fill up with cold water. Prepare ^ 
teaspoonful of camphor in J cupful of water. Drink the flour 
and water and foUow with the camphor to remove sickness. 
Eepeat several times a day, or as often as pain and illness return. 

TmKD. — J ounce rhubarb, 30 drops oil peppermint, ^ ounce 
soda. Mix and turn over it ^ pint boiling water. Let it settle, 
pour off carefully from the sediment and add 4 ounces of brandy, 
or use the "Cholera Mixture." 

Medicine Takers will do well to put a bit of alum in the 
mouth for a moment before taking medicine. It can then be taken 
like water. 

Dyspepsia. — Quassia chips. Dose— J teaspoonful of the 
chius in 'J, tumbler of water. Take a swallow before meals. EeflU 



HEALTH. 507 

{he Tumbler two or three mornings and then take new chips, 01 
take 1 ounce quassia chips, ^ pint gin, i pint water. Put in a bot- 
tle and do not use until the chips settle. Dose — 1 tablespoonful 
before eating. Hop tea is also very good. 

Acid Stomach and Hesidache.— 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 
1 tablespoonful water, baking soda the size of a grain of corn. , 
Stir until it foams and drink at once. See also second cure for 
Erysipelas. This is good for liver. 

Small-pox and Scarlet Fever. — See directions for contagious 
diseases. Sponge the body of the patient in both cases frequently 
in warm water with a little glycerine added. In gcarlet fever the 
patient is frequently anointed from head to foot with sweet oil or 
unsalted butter, the great necessity being tO keep the skin moist 
and flexible and aid it to do its work. Give the followihg mixture : 
1 grain sulphate of zinc, 1 grain fox-glove (digitalis), ^ teaspoon- 
sugar. Mix with 2 tablespoopfuls water, and take a spoon- 
ftil every hour. This is a reliable recipe. The course of the 
disease wiU usually be run in twenty-four hours. 

Ring-worm. — Moisten with saliva and rub the ashes of a 
good cigar thoroughly into the sore spot. Do this three times a 
day and aU will be well in a few days ; or an ointment of lard and , 
gunpowder may be used. 

Mortiflcation, external or internal, in man or animal. See 
first cure for Summer Diseases for Chronic Gases. DOse — 1 tea- 
spoonful mixed with vinegar, or apply if external. Unrivalled. 

Agne or Chills. — Break an egg into enough strong vinegar 
to float it. Stir slightly and swallow. Eepeat the dose three 
times a day for three days. A eertain cure. 

Headache. — 1 ounce of bromide of potassium in 4 ounces of 
water. Take a teaspoonful every hour or half hour if the pain is 
severe. If not so severe, three or four times a day. This is 
almost infallible. Sleep taken at the right moment will prevent 
nervous headache. Nature calls for it by a weariness or heaviness 
which proceeds such an attack. Sleeping an hour or two will 
often prevent it.

white sugar and take some every moming before breakfast for 
several •weeks. 

Beartbnrn. — Dissolve 1 salt spooHful of salt in half a wine- 
glass of water and drink. 

Earache. — Take a small piece of cotton wool; make a de- 
pression in the center and fill with black pepper; gather into a 
ball and tie up; dip it in sweet oil and insert it into the ear. 
Almost instant relief will be experienced. Tie a flannel bandage 
over the head. Jtiiee from a roasted onion is good. A piece of 
salt pork cut in a pointed strip inserted in the ear will give 
relief. 

Poultices. — ^Poultices of bread and milk, flaxseed, slippery 
elm, or any other kind, may be worn with more comfort, and 
removed with more ease, if the surface is spread over, before 
applying, with a little perfectly fresh lard or sweet oil. If there 
is much pain, a few drops of laudanum may be mixed with the 
poultice. Spread always on soft old cloths. 

Mustard plasters, or poultices, wiU not blister, only draw, if 
mixed with the white of an egg. 

To Prevent Chaffing of the skin in an invalid, which is apt 
to occur after long confinement in bed, especially if the position 
cannot be frequently changed. Bathe the parts subjected to pres- 
sure at least twice a day with alcohol. This hardens the skin, or 
beat the white of an egg to a stiff froth and add while beating 2 
teaspoonfuls of spirits of wine. Put in a bottle and apply occa- 
sionally with a feather. If these precautions should have been 
neglected, and soreness of ike skin already appears, it may be 
healed by the following ointment. Take five cents worth each of 
quicksilver and aqua fortis, pour together and place over a slow fire. 
The aqua fortis wiU eat up the quicksilver, but if any should remain 
take out. Add a pint of lard and simmer a few minutes. This 
salve may be applied and will be foimd a cure. 

Bleeding at the Nose.— Stand perfectly erect, throw the 
head a little back, place the finger on the affected side of the nose, 
close the mouth tightly and draw air through the free nostril as 
long as possible. Eepeat this until the bleeding ceases. 

Sboond. — Vigorous chewing motion of the jaws will arrest

bleeding at the nose. If necessary take a wad of paper and chew 
hard. This is effectual. 

The Ears.— To remove peas, beans or pebbles from the ear, 
syringe them out with warm water. For a discharging ear, syringe 
out with warm water every morning, or take a bit of cotton with 
very small tweezers, and cleanse the ear with this. Then blow a 
small quantity of Boracic acid through a quill into the ear. This 
acid is harmless and a cure. 

Insects lodging in the ear should be floated out by filling the 
ear cavity with sweet oil. This will, at least, kill the intruder, 
and, if it does not appear, call a doctor to remove it next day. 

If cotton is to be used in the ear be sure to take a piece too 
large to slip into the ear cavity. Deafness is sometimes caused in 
this way. Never wear cotton unless absolutely necessary. 

The Nese. — In case of a foreign object getting lodgment up 
the nose, do not attempt to remove it, but blow with some strength 
into the open mouth, and the object will be expelled. 

If a child persists in sucking a finger or thumb, rub the finger 
every day with turpentine or extract of quassia. The unpleasant 
bitter will soon put an end to the habit. 

A Copper Coin Swallowed may be rendered harmless by a 
diet of bread and milk, giving nothing sour, as this would corrode 
the metal. Also give the raw white of an egg three times a day, 
and a dose of castor oil every night. 

Sleeplessness, Insomnia. — The usual cause of this trouble 
is too much blood in the brain, and those thus alFected will often 
find it advantageous to raise the head of the bed a foot higher, and 
then sleep on a thid: hair pillow so as to bring the |head a little 
higher than the shoulders. The object of this is to make the work 
of the heart harder in throwing blood to the brain. Sometimes 
rising for a time, wrapping up and sitting in a chair with the feet, 
if possible, at the fire. Take a short nap in this manner, and then 
return to bed. Fajt of a raw onion eaten with salt will often quiet 
ibe nervous system and produce sleep in a few minutes. After 
continued mental labor, a light lunch before retiring will often 
induce sleep, as ike work of digestion draws the blood fron, thfc 
twaifi to <^e stomach. Or have the room dimly lighted, lie wi&.

the bead propped high. Select some object a little to one side. 
Look BteadUy at this. Let the eyes get well a- weary, and refresh- 
ing sleep will soon follow. 

Foot Baths for Burning Feet. — Use water as hot as can 
be borne. This will be found a great relief. Baths of sand, warm 
and moist, are also good. Bury the feet in this up to the ankles, 
and let remain from twenty to thirty minutes. 

Hysteria. — This can frequently be controlled by firmness on 
the part of the attendant. Eelate some astonishing incident io 
change the train of thought ; be decided ; give ammonia to inhale ; 
give a hot foot bath, or warm bath, to the whole person. 

Convnlsions may be frequently cut short, like ma^c, by turn- 
ing the patient on the left side. The nausea, as an after effect of 
chloroform and other ansssthetics, may generally be controlled in 
the same manner. 

Warts. — Touch them with nitrate of silver, or tincture of 
iodine, or bathe them two or three times a day with strong saleratus 
water, heating it in by the fire. Nitric acid applied is also a sure 
cure, but is a little painful. , 

Wens. — Paint with iodine daily (colorless tincture if to be 
had), or as often as it will bear the application. This is slow but 
sure. 

Stiffened Finger Joints. — Dissolve camphor gum in olive 
oil, and rub the stiffened joint with' this preparation three or four 
times daily. The rubbing, as well as the oil, helps to soften the 
bony formation around the joints. 

Weakened Sinew. — Bind a piece of tea lead the size of a 
sUver dollar over the swollen joint. Do this firmly, it will effect 
a cure in a few days. This may be hastened, if the case is very 
bad, by gentle beating with a knife handle, increasing the force as 
it can be borne.

^^^ EALTH is one of the [requisites to the making up of a fine 
I 1 complexion. A sickly plant commands our care, but not 
«*~''* our admiration. So with the individual. A buoyant step 
and healthful glow on cheek and lip, are irresistible in their 
power over us. To possess these the greatest care should be taken. 
Plenty of nutritious food well cooked and at regular intervals. 
Exercise in the open air. Early hours for rest and sleep are all 
absolutely necessary. Avoid medicine of a drastic and debilitating 
nature, and in the spring, when circulatioa is clogged and digestion 
sluggish, take a tablespoonful of French charcoal mixed carefully 
in water or honey before meals for several days, following this 
each evening with a teaspoonf ul of extract of dandelion ; or take 
the same dose of charcoal at night, foUow it with a large spoonful 
of finely minced onion. There is no greater purifier in the medi- 
cal pharmacy than charcoal. In the spring of .the year, eat freely 
of cabbage, lettuce and all herbaceous food. If this diet is accom- 
panied and followed by the requisite amount of bathing, it wiU 
work wonders with the most stubborn complexion and give health 
and elasticity to the sluggish frame. If spring tonics are pre- 
scribed, never take them until after charcoal has been used af 
above directed, when the system wUl be found in a state to be 
benefited by their use. The following, from a reliable author, will 
be found, excellent. 
Blood Purifier.— 

J ounce of spruce bark. f ounce of hemlock bark. 

1 ounce of sarsaparilla bark. ^ ounce of dandelion root. 

J ounce of burdock root. J ounce of yellow dock root. 

1 gallon of water.

512 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Boil one-half hour, strain hot and add 10 drops of oil of 
spruce and sassafras mixed. When cold add ^ pound of brown 
sugar and ^ cupful of yeast. Let stand two hours in a jar covered 
tight, then bottle. Use this freely; iced it is a pleasant drink. 

Lemons are excellent spring correctives. Press the juice of 1 
lemOn in a glass of water and drink one-half one quarter of an 
hour before breakfast. This may be repeated before retiring, 
sweeten very slightly or not at all. Never make practice of 
taking the lemon juice pure without the addition of water, it is too 
strong for the coatings of the stomach. 

Bathsl — Hot baths will be found by almost every one more 
ULvigorating as well as more cleansing than cold. Their effect is 
cooling and refreshing in the hottest day. Use water hot as the 
skin can bear and plenty of good soap. A heavy flannel or hair 
cloth wash-cloth is desirable, to be followed by friction with a hair 
doth glove or a flesh brush. This will do away with the possibih- 
ty of colds. Evening is usually the preferable time for a bath. Take 
twice a week in winter and once every day in summer; this should 
not be neglected. The winter flannels, especially if they are slept 
in, should be changed twice a week. A bath of merely tepid water 
will be found enervating and enfeebling. If the hot bath is thought 
so at' times, follow it by a quick plunge into cold water or a 
sponging off with the same, using the flesh brush afterward. Ten 
minutes is sufficient time in which to take a bath. A bath should 
never be taken until at least two hours after a meal or one hour 
before it. 

Cold bathing should never be indulged in if ^the [least chill 
follows the act. An instant glow should be the result, otherwise dis- 
continue at once. A sponge bath answers every purpose besides giv- 
ing less trouble. It should be remembered to use soap with the bath. 

A Bran Bath. — The water should be quite warm, and bran 
should be stirred into it in the proportion of ^ peck to a tub of 
water (no soap is required). Oatmeal is still better on account of 
the oil. Follow it by long friction until the skin shines, this 
brings the blood to the surface and wards off wrinkles, while the 
gluten in the bran softens the tissuee. A bran bath should be 
taken once a week.

Ammonia is very pleasant to put in bathing water, 1 large 
tablespoonflil to a bowl of water; this is Refreshing for the neck 
and arms in summer on account of its deodorizing qualities. Use 
for a foot bath also. 

White Toilet Soap. — 1 gallon of soft water, let boil and add 
4 pounds of white linen soap shaved line, 2 ounces of sal-soda, 2 
ounces of Glauber salts, 1 tablespoonful of spirits of hartshorn. 
Boil all together five minutes, or until well dissolved. Then scent 
to suit with cologne or musk, bergamot, etc. Pour into a buttered 
tin to cool and cut in squares. This will make 12 pounds. 

Liquid Toilet Soap^ — 4 quarts of rain water, 4 ounces of 
borax, 4 ounces of baking soda, 2 ounces of ammonia. Mix and 
bottle. Shake before using. Will be found very nice for sensitive 
skins or for those having undue oily secretions of the skin. 

Aids to the Complexion. — The foregoing directions, are 
applicable, alike to good and bad complexions, and should be fol- 
lowed by every one wishing to keep the skin clear and wholesome. 
But it must be added that there are many skins which by reason 
of neglect, HI health or lost youth, stand in need of more special 
treatment. Especially does this apply to that coarse and porous 
skin, more noticeably across the cheeks and nose, that tries the 
patience of so ndany girls and women. Nothing short of a new 
skin will answer in this case. 

Make a mask of white cotton cloth of many folds quilted 
together, leaving openings for nostrils and eyes. The material 
should be one that will retain as much water as possible. Wet 
thoroughly in warm water and put on the face just before retiring, 
wear all night and keep as wet as possible. This wet mask keeps 
the air away from the skin and gives it time to soften. The outer 
cuticle wears o^ slowly and a fine, smooth surface takes its place, 
but it requires at least eight weeks before this desirable result 
repays the long discomfort. Baths must be carefully attended to, 
and the face not exposed to any sudden changes of atmosphere 
without applying a little cold cream and wearing a thin veil, for 
the new cuticle is very tender at, first. 

Paste for a Porous Skin.— A substitute for the toilet 
vask will be found in the following paste. It will be found eveu

quicker in its operation. 3 ounces of finely ground barley or oat- 
meal, 1 ounce of honey, white of 1 egg. Mix to a paste and spread 
thickly over the nose, cheeks and forehead before retiring. Cover 
the portions where the paste is applied with bits of old thin lawn, 
and let remain on all night. Wash off with warm water, first 
dampening and allowing to soften while dressing. Then bathe the 
face with white castile soap and warm water, rubbing on a little 
cold cream before exposure to the weather. Eepeat this every 
night until the skin grows soft and fine, which will be in about 
three weeks. After that use once a week for some time. Care 
must be taken at the same time to bathe daily. 

Bathing the Face. — Hot mUk and water is very nice to 
bathe the face in, freshening the skin and assisting to remove 
wrinkles. Hot water is very beneficial for the face and should be 
used night and morning; it opens the pores and removes a 
great deal of the natural oil, besides tightening the skin, thus 
keeping it firm and less likely to wrinkle.' Hot milk and water, 
half and half, may be used instead, if more agreeable. Soap will 
not be necessary in this case. A flannel wash cloth should be 
used, taking a small square, renewing h as often as it grows thick 
and felt-like. This method of treating the face is declared by some to 
be a perfet substitute for any and all cosmetics, leaving the skin 
smooth, rosy and unwrinkled, and will be found beneficial in all 
eases. "Washing the face nightly in hot auds, madb from 
pure white Castile soap, or with hot milk, followed \.j a firm upward 
(never up and down) friction, with a moderately coarse towel 
ife the recommended course of treatment for the black spe-aks that 
rain so many complexions. 

To Whiten the Face and BemoTe Wrinkles.—! fluid 
ounce of tincture of benzoin, ^ ounce of pure glycerine, 7 ounces of 
distilled rose-water. 

Bathe face, neck and hands with it at night and let dry on. 
Wash off in the morning with soft warm water and a very little 
white Castile soap. This is excellent for the skin in every way. 

Wash for a Sallow Skin.— 1 pint of rain water, 2 drachma 
of iodide of potassium, 1 ounce of glycerine. 

Mis and apply with a sponge once a day. This often woria

wonders in skins sallow by inherited disease. Adhere closely to 
the directions given for bathing. 

CoM Cream.— 

2 ounces of oil of sweet almonds. 
1 ounce of pure glycerine. ' 
J ounce of spermaceti. 
20 grains of white wax. 
6 drops of oil of rose. 

Melt all together, setting the cup over boiling water, then beat 
until perfectly cold and snowy white. Put up in glass or China. 
Excellent for face and hands. 

Complexion Wash. — 1 ounce oil of sweet almonds, 1 ounce 
of glycerine, juice of 3 lemons. 

Mix and apply at night. Let dry on, and in the morning 
wash off with very warm water. 

Wash for an Oily Skin. — j ounce of powdered borax, 1 
ounce of absolutely pure glycerine, 1 quart of camphor water. 
Mix and use twice a day, morning and evening, letting dry on and 
then, after a few minutes, washing off with rain water. This will 
prevent chapped skin, remove sun-bum and freckles, and keep the 
pores in a good condition. Also it will do away with that annoy- 
ing redness of nose, cheeks and knuckles that afSicts so many. 

Bay-bum or rose-water, or the two half and half, may be used 
to advantage after bathing the face to remove the appearance of 
oiliness. 

A SATUEATBD SOLUTION of borax is also very nice for an oily 
tekin. Use as above. The mUd alkali of the borax unites with the 
'oily secretions and forms a sort of soap that cleanses the face and 
at the same time frees it from oil. 

Toilet Water for Tain'and Freckles.— This will also whiten 
the face. Take J pint of rain water, 1 small cupful of real cider 
vinegar, 1 cupful of nulk. Mix and bottle. Apply to the face at 
night. Let dry on. In the morning wash off with warm water. 
It will remove tan. 

Lettuoe is useful to refine the akin. Break the stems and 
stalks of coarse garden lettuce and rub the milky juice over the 
face at night. In the moxmng wash off with wana water contain-

ing a few drops of ammonia. The opium is the refining me- 
dium. 

Lemon juice will usually remove any transient stains on the 
Aands. 

Washes for Pimples. — The wash given for an Oily Skin is 
also good for pimples. Apply several times a day and allow it to 
dry on. 

Wash for Pimples (No. 11). — Glycerine half and half with 
water. Stir into this powdered sulphur (flower of sulphur). Eub 
this on the face at night and wash o£f in the morning \nth soap 
and water, adding a few drops of ammonia. This will aljo whiten 
the skin, remove the oiUness that troubles some complexions, and 
has the commendation of a celebrated physician. 

Cucumber Pomade. — The French recommend this for re- 
fining and purifying the skin. Prepare as follows : Express the 
juice of fresh cucumbers, bring to the boiling point, skim and bot- 
tle. Take 1 teaspoonful of the juice to 2 teaspoonfuls of water, 
and apply to the face night and morning, letting dry on. 

To Remove Wrinkles. — % drachms of essence of turpen- 
tine, 1 drachm of gum -mastic, pulverized; 2 ounces fresh unsalted 
butter. Mix; apply at night and let dry on the face. Wash o£E 
in the morning with a little warm soap and water. 

To Kemove Wrinkles (No. n.) — Bathe the face every night 
in water as hot as can be borne, with a little bi-carbonate of 
soda dissolved therein. Dry the face carefully and anoint it with 
cold cream, sweet cream or sweet oil. This has the recommenda- 
tion of a well-known physician. 

Wash for Black Ueads. — 36 grains of sub-carbonate of 
soda, 8 ounces of distilled water, 6 drachms of essence of roses. 
Mix and apply with a small sponge after each ablution, using gen- 
tle friction, always upward. 

Wash for Black Heads (No. II).— A physician may effect- 
nally destroy them by touching each one with acetic acid. A hair 
pencil must be used and the acid only allowed to touch the black spot. 

Freckles, To RemOTC. — Apply a saturated solution of borax 
in rose-water five or six times a day and allow to dry upon the 
iace. This will be snocessful in mild cases. k^- 



THE TOILET. 517 

Freckles, To Remove (No. II).— Moisten the finger tijts 
;^d dip in finely powdered saltpeter and apply to the freckles. 
Repeat until freckles are gone. 

Freckles, To Remove (No. III).— Poultice the face lightly, 
or soften with almond paste and rub a freshly cut lemon over the 
surface. 

Tan. — Make a thick mixture of magnesia and soft rain water. 
Spread all over the face. Let remain on three or four minutes, « 
then wash off with Castile soap and tepid water. Einse the face 
and dry thoroughly. The face should always be dried thoroughly. 

Domestic suggestions, such as bathing hands and face in but- 
termilk, or using vinegar in which grated horse-radish has been 
soaked, or lemon juice, any and all of them frequently prove suc- 
cessful after several applications. 

Sunburn. — Cold sweet cream applied thoroughly on retiring 
is very soothing. Cold cream or lettuce cream. If the face, throat 
and hands are well rubbed with cold cream before exposure, dan- 
ger of sun-burn wUl be almost done away with. 

Lettuce Cream. — 2 cupfuls of young lettuce, cut fine, wash 
and stir into one cupful of boiUng mutton suet, boil a few miputes 
strain, perfume to suit, beat until cold and pack in jars or cups. 
Extra for that redness of the skin and soreness known as sun- 
burn, and very healing. 

Camphor Ice. — 6 t^lespoonfuls of boiling hot mutton suet, stir 
in 1 tablespoonfuFglycerine, 1 tablespoonful powdered camphor, 1 
tablespoonful olive oil. Remove from the*fire and stir until cold. 
Pack in small boxes or put in little molds. Excellent for chapped 
bands, lips, etc. 

Bruises. — Rubbing a bruise in sweet oil and then in spirits 
of turpentine wiU usually prevent the unsightly black and blue 
spbt. Dusting this moistened surface with flesh colored powder 
will finish the work. Also see page 494. 

Moth Patches- — l tablespoonful of flour of sulphur in a pint 
bottle of rum. Apply to the spots at night. This will cause them 
to disappear in two or three weeks. The moth patch is a vegetable 
fungus, and the sulphur is destructive to it. Carefully wash off in 



5l8 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

the morning. Of course this remedy will only succeed where the 
moth is not the immediate result of some bodily condition. 

Scars. — Cocoanut oil, or hen's oil, applied to ; soar and rubbed 
gently for five minutes at a time, several times a day, will entirely 
obliterate a scar if commenced from the time the burn heals. The 
rubbing will loosen the skin and flesh from bone and muscle and 
cause thorough circulation. Even where the scar is of long stand- 
ing this will be of much assistance, and perseverance wiU work 
wonders in scars left by cut, bum or bruise. 

Face Powders. — Entire cleanliness is necessary in applying. 
The first coating of powder should always be thoroughly cleansed 
from the face with water before a new coating is given, thus pre- 
venting the crust that naturally forms where one layer of powder 
after another is put on dming the day. 

SniPLE powDEKs are always the best. Common prepared chalk 
subjected to baking in a moderate oven, or finely powdered pearl 
starch, are among the best. Pure French chalk is harmless, so is 
KOSE POWDER prepared from French chalk, and tinted with car- 
mine and yellow ocher to a perfect flesh tint, or Violet powder, 
consisting of 3 parts of finely powdered pearl starch to 1 part 
orris root, powdered. Eice flour is often substituted for the starch. 
This is used, not only for the face, but is found convenient for 
infants. Arrowroot may be substituted for starch. 

To APPLY POWDER. — Anothcr way is to take refined chalk in 
little pellets. See that the skin is clean and cool, then wrap a 
pellet of the chalk in coarse Unen cloth and crush in water. Eub 
well between the fingers and wash quickly over the face. The wet 
powder oozes through the cloth in its finest /state. When the face 
is dry remove all superfluous powder lightly. 

Rose Powder. — Oil of rose, 24 drops; carmine or rose pink, 
12 grains; rice flour, very fine, 1 pound. Mix. Harmless and 
good. 

Liquid Pace Powders, or [Cosmetic Washes. — Balm op 
Beauty — 1 ounce of glycerine, 1 ounce of alcohol, ^ ounce of tinc- 
ture of benzoin, 2 ounces pure prepared chalk, 1 grain of carmine 
will give it a flesh tint if desired. Shake well and apply to the 
f*oe with a soft sponge. When thoroughly dry carefully remove 



THE TOILET. 519 

any superfluous traces, and the result will be very satisfactory 
where powder has ceased to avail. 

Cream of. Roses. — 3 ounces oxide of zinc, i ounce glycerine, 
^ pint rose-water, ^ pint rain water, 2 or 3 grains of carmine wiU 
give a flesh tint. Use as above. 

Skin Irritations, Mosquito Biles, etc. — l teaspoonful car- 
bolic acid, 1 pint rose-water. Mosquito bites, heat, irruptions, will 
yield to the magical influence of this wash, which may be used for 
grown people or invalids, or take 50 drops of carbolic acid and mix 
with 1 ounce of glycerine. Apply this at night, and it will not 
only prove a perfect prevention from mosquitoes, but will sooth 
and heal those already received, and remove their unsightly blotches. 
Diluted, it will serve the same purpose for infants. Two drops of 
oil of roses may be added if the odor is unbearable. 

Depilatories (fob the removal of superfluous haib). — Per- 
haps the most surely effective method is to pull the hair out by the 
roots. The best instrumept for this purpose is a 'stick of resin, 
tempered with wax, with the addition of a strong anodyne. 

Tweezers may also be used to remove the hair, though this 
is slower and more painful. Care should be taken not to break off 
the hairs in the process, as this renders them harsh and stiff. 
Continual pulling will, in the end, extirpate the obnoxious growth 
of hair. To keep the hair from growing, bathe the part often with 
strong camphor or clear ammonia. The latter will serve as a 
depilatory, but is painful and should be washed off at once. Strong 
washes of pearlash will kill the poor scattering hair at the back 
of the neck and on the forehead. All of these applications tend 
to harden the skin, and sweet oil or vaseline should be well rubbed 
in after their use. 

Whitening and cleariag the arms of hair may be attained by 
bathing them daily for two minutes in a hot solution of chloride of 
lime in the proportion of 2 iablespoonfuls of the lime to a quart of 
hot water. Rinse carefully in vinegar and water, the acid kills the 
lime, after which rub them with sweet oil to soften the skin. Do 
not inhale the fumes of this. It is best to bathe them before an 
open window. 

Depilatory (No. II). — l ounce sulphuret barium. Mix rapidly

into a paste with a littlejfinely powdered starch, or flour and warm 
water. Apply it to the superfluous hair, let remain a few minutes, 
not more than five, and wash off with warm watgr. If the skin 
is left tender, rub with sweet oU, cold cream or vaseline. Eepeat 
untU the growth ceases. It is a poisonous article, ancl great care 
must be taken in its use. Make a portion of the sulphuret into a 
strong solution at a time, and stir in the flour, or starch, to form 
the paste as wanted. 

THE. HANDS. 

To SOFTEN the hands and remove stains, put a couple of hand- 
fuls of bran in a bowl of hot soap suds, keep the hands in this, 
brushing, rubbing and soaking them thoroughly in the warm 
mixture, which should be of the consistency of thin gruel. This 
is healing and softening. iCoid boiled potatoes will cleanse the 
bands and keep the skin soft and healthy. 

To EEMovE STAINS ou the hauds, lemon juice is frequently suiB- 
cient, also ]the above baths. They may be touched with oxalic 
acid successfully for this, but it is rank poison. Einse the hands 
after using it, and rub glycerine, or cold cream, on the spot. Eub- 
bing the hands in fresh tomato parings , wUl remove apple and 
potato stains. 

Indian meal mixed with lemon juice, or-good cider vinegar, is 
very soothing for hands roughened by cold or labor. It will also 
remove stains. Keep some prepared in a bowl. Eub the hands in 
this, rinse thoroughly, rub in a few drops of glycerine and dry. 
This is an excellent preparation for chapped hands, and will 
remove the unpleasant effects resulting from keeping the hands in 
soft soap, or other strong soap suds. The acid destroys the effect 
of the alkali. 

Glycerine Preparation.— 2 ounces of pure glycerine, juice 
of one lemon. Mix and apply to the hands. Shake well before 
using. This will heal and whiten the hands. 

Cosmetic GIotcs. — These are designed to soften and ^i/'^an 
the hands, and are worn at night. Take a pair of strong kid or 
dog-skin gloves and brush over the inside with the following mix- 
fcure, or else rub plentifully over the hands and draw on the gloves. 
F i'esh should be put on every night, and two or three weeks is as 



THE TOILET. 521 

long as one pair of gloves should be used. They should be loosely 
fitting. Take equal quantities of spermaceti and pure bees-wax. 
Scrape fine, cover with sweet oil and siinmer until it beobmes 
liquid. Use a small china cup or jar; set in a vessel of boiling 
water. Add a few drops of rose-water and blend thoroughly. 
Take from the fire and let it form in the same cup. In the morn- 
ing wash the hands with warm water and oat-meal or almond 
powder, not soap, and a manifest improvement in color and texture 
will be the result- 

Finger Nails. — Trim evenly and prettily, a very little deeper 
in the center. Do not leave them too long. Do not bite them off. 
If children are inclined to do this, put extract of quassia on the 
finger tips, and the, extreme bitter wUl soon break up the habit. 
Cleanse the nails every day with a nail-brush, which should be 
soft instead of harsh and stiff, thus avoiding the use of a knife in 
cleaning, which roughens the under surface and causes dustto ad- 
here more readily. Eub the naUs with a coarse towel, not only 
for the polish, but to keep the skin of the fingers from growing up 
on them in unsightly ridges. Expose the white half-moon or 
lunette at the root as much as possible, as this lengthens the ovaJ 
outline of the nail. 

Finger Nail Polish. — Pure oxide of zim tinted with carmine 
and perfumed to suit. Apply by rubbing on the nail with the 
finger or a nail-polisher covered with leather (chamois). It 
renders the surface smooth, bright and pink. It need not be used 
too often. It also tinges the finger tips daintily. 

Coloring for Lips.— Take the following Hand Pomade and 
add Alkanet powder, untU color suits ; it is delicate and harinless. 
2 ounces oil of sweet almonds; 1 ounce spermaceti; ^ ounce rice 
flour. Heat over slow fire, stir until cold. Add few drops of oil 
of rose. 

Fever Blisters. — At the first symptoms touch the alfected 
spot carefully with the following preparation every few hours : 10 
drops carbolic acid, 1 teaspoonful glycerine, 2 drops oil of roses. 
Never rub the sore spot to irritate it. 

Lip Salves. — Cold creaja, glycerine, lettuce cream, etc., are 
all good for roughened and cracked lips. 



522 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

HAIR. 

In washing the hair apply the liquid with a small sponge, part- 
ing the hair awd moistening the scalp, avoiding the tresses as 
much as possible. Einse in the same manner. Very mild soap 
and soft water may be used, carefully rinsing, or the yolk of an 
egg may be beaten in a cupful of warm water. Apply and rinse 
as before. Still better, the hair may ba rinsed with a mixture of 
half-and-half bay-rum and rose-water. Hair washes are also use- 
ful. Do not use a fine-tooth comb. It causes an increased growth 
of dandruff and injures the hair. 

Hair Wash. — 1 ounce borax, ^ ounce camphor. Powder and 
dissolve in quart of boiling water. Perfume to suit. When cool 
it is ready for use. If it leaves the hair at all harsh or dry, 3 or 4 
teaspoonfuls of pure glycerine may be added. Dampen the scalp 
often with this. It will sometimes prevent the hair falling out 
and will keep the skin clean and wholesome. 

To Preyent Hair Falling Out. — Ammonia is an effectual 
stimulant. Washing the scalp often in soft water containing am- 
monia (2 spoonfuls to a large basin of water), use sponge as before 
directed, will often prove successful without any other aid. A tea- 
spoonful of glycerine added to the water wUl prevent any harsh- 
ness of the hair from its use. The tips of the hair should be 
trimmed once a month, not by cutting the whole promiscuously, 
but by carefully examining and cutting the tip from every hair that 
seems dead or split. The following remedies are also recom- 
mended to prevent the hair from falling : 

No. I. — Ammonia, 1 ounce; rosemary water, 1 ounce; glyc- 
erine, 1 ounce; cantharides, 1 drachm; rose-water, 4 ounces. 
Wet the scalp with cold water, then apply this wash and rub 
briskly with a soft towel. 

No. 11. — 1 pint of alcohol, |- ounce oil of mace. A few drops 
perfumery, or use the deodorized alcohol. Oil of mace is a more 
powerful restorative for the hair than cantharides. Pour a little 
in a Pdueer and apply to the scalp with a medium brush. Do not 
brush too much. Do this three times a day for weeks, and if the 
bead has inclining to baldness, continue once a day for some time

longer. This has been known to create a new growth on bald 
heads. Wash the head often in cold water. This method is highly 
recommended by a competent authority. 

Uair Dye. — 4 ounces butternut hulls. Infuse in 1 quart 
. water. To this add ^ ounce copperas. Apply every two or three 
days with a hair-brush. Cleanse the hair first with weak am- 
monia and water. This wiU give brown and black dyes according 
to the strength of the decoction. Dampening the hair daily in 
strong cold tea or strong cold coffee wiU show a marked change in 
a few days, the hair becoming darker and softer. 
Ambrosial Hair Tonic and Bye.— 

1 ounce castor oil. 1 ounce bay-rum. 

J ounce oil eitronelle. 1 drachm oil bergamot. 

1 ounce ammonia. j- ounce glycerine (pure). 

8 ounces strong sage tea made with soft water. 
1 quart alcohol. 1 pint of soft water. 

Bub into the scalp well. 

Bandoline for Gnrliug or Crimping. — 2 ounces of borax, 1 
drachm of gum arable, 1^ pints boiling water. Stir and when 
dissolved add 2 teaspooniuls spirits of camphor. Bottle and keep 
on the toilet table. To use, put the curls or crimps up in papers 
or pins, dampen with bandoline and leave up over night, or until 
thoroughly dry. This will be found to resist the warmest day. 

Bandoline, (No. II).-^1 tablespoonful bruised quince seeds, 
1 pint soft rain water. Simmer gently down to f of a pint. A 
tablespoonful or two of alcohol may be added and enough cologne 
to give a pleasant odor. Use as above. 

The Beauty of the eye, whether dark or light, but especially in 
light orbs, depends upon dark brows and heavy dark lashes; theee 
will beautify the palest eye. 

To Thicken the Eyebrows, gently brush in every other night a 
few drops of ail of cajeput, always brushing horn the noa* oat- 
, war^. ^^eaaaiDve with tweezers any hairs that by tkeir poS'itiofH or 
irregiiilaiifey ia^tire the perfect ©utliae tilwt fee brow should possess.

-To Debpbn their Colok. — Take tke dark pcon&tnm pencil to be 
bought at all large perfumers, and pencil carefully until the desired 
tint is obtained. More accessible still is the needle point smoked 
in the lamp or the burned match, 

CiNDEES IN THE EnES. — A simple and effective cure may be 
found in 1 or 2 grains of flaxseed which can be placed in the eye 
withoTlt pain or injury. As they dissolve, a glutinous substance is 
formed, which envelopes any foreign body that may be under the 
lid and the whole is easily washed out. A dozen or so of these 
seeds should constitute a part of every traveler's outfit. 

Eye Lashes should be watched and any broken or weak hairs 
carefully trimmed. The eyes themselves should be kept in per- 
fect health and free from any inflammation. Then the base of the 
lashes should be anointed with a very little oil of cajeput on a 
small camel's hair brush. This course faithfully preserved will 
soon show a marked difference. 

To Daeken the Eyelashes use a little diluted India ink. 
These operations on the lashes had best be conducted by a second 
person. The dye given below is very good. ■ 

CoLOEma FOB Eyebeows, Lashes and Haib. — 1 ounce of walnut 
bark (this can be had at the druggists) to 1 pint of water. Boil 
1 hour slowly, add a piece of alum the size of a large hazel-nut to 
set the dye. Apply to the eyebrows and lashes with a little camel's 
hair brush, such as is used for water- color painting, or with a 
sponge to the hair. Protect the pillows with an old handkarchief . 
Dark eyebrows darken and improve the very palest eyes. 

TRRTH. 

The Tooth Bbush should not be too stiff. 

Toothpicks are indispensable and the best is a slender, well- 
sharpened quiU. Avoid metallic ones. Still another adjimct to their 
care is a piece of white floss sUk (dentist's floss), fold it back and 
forth two' or three times and wax. Draw this between every sin- 
gle tooth Bib least once a day aiid dentist's bills will be mairveloosly 
lessened. The dwser the teeth are tofe'Sher, the gpeaAer the necfis-

white, though it occasionally -works under the gums. 

To Clean and Polish the Teeth- — Dip the end of a match, 
breaking off the sulphur part, in powdered pumice stone and rub 
above and between and under the teeth until every trace of foreign 
accumulation has been removed. Finish by rubbing the face and 
crown of the tooth with a silk handkerchief dipped in the powder. 

Tooth Wash. — 2 ounces of borax dissolved in 3 pints of boil- 
ing water; before it is cold add 1 teaspoonful of tincture of myrrh, 
1 tablespoonful of spirits of camphor. Bottle. When wanted for 
use, mix 1 tablespoonful of this with twice the amount of warm 
water and apply daily with a soft brush. It will preserve the teeth, 
extirpate all tartarous adhesion, arrest decay and make the teeth 
peady white. Never use a tooth wash but once a day. The teeth 
should be brushed several times, but pure water should answer the 
remainder of the time. The Hair Wash given before, diluted with 
warm water, makes an excellent tooth wash. 

Tooth Powders. — Equal parts of white Castile soap grated 
fine, and prepared chalk, precipitated. Mix and use as a tooth 
powder. The chalk may be used alone and is very nice, or the 
brush may be rubbed on white Castile soap and then dipped in the 
chalk. 

The above may be wet to a paste with 1 part camphor and 6 
parts soft water. Work smooth; prt in a wide-mouthed bottle 
and cork. Use with a brush. Charcoal may be mixed with honey 
if it is used for a dentifrice. 

Unhealthy Gums.— 20 drops carbohc acid, 2 drachms spirits 
of wine, 6 ounces distilled water. Use first a soft tooth brush with 
water, after which pour a little of the lotion on the brush and use. 
In a very short time the gums become less tender, and anyimpttrity 
of the breath wiU be removed. Perfume the lotion slightly if 
wished, but very slightly. 

Impure Breath. — To secure a sweet breath dissolve a small 
piece of liquorice in the mouth after the use of the tooth brush. 
This sweetens the mouth and stomach. Keep some of it broken 



526 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

ap in a glass bottle on the toilet table; pat a piece in the month at 
bed time also. 

If the teeth are decayed, wash the mouth with tincture of 
myrrh dilluted with a little water, a bit of burned alum kept in 
the mouth at night is a help to sweeten the breath also ; or take 
roasted coffee grains, conceal the odor of onions, etc., also a bit of 
Canada snake root. 

Toothaehe Drops. — l ounce of alcohol (33 degrees), 4 grains 
/of camphor, 20 grains of opium in powder, 80 drops of oil of 
cloves. Sure. Keep on hand. 

Tincture of Benzoin. — A few drops on cotton, pressed into 
the decayed tooth, is a sure cure for toothache 

PRRT. 

Exercise, friction, flesh brush, etc., will give varm, wholesome 
feet that will not need heated soap-stones to insure comfort and 
health. Wrap the feet, before retiring, in flannels instead of heat- 
ing by artificial appliances. In extreme cases give the feet a warm 
bath at night, to which a little mustard has been added to stimu- 
late, follow this with a dash of cold water, dry with coarse crash 
and use the flesh brush. After such a bath, whether or not it be 
followed by the dash of cold water, draw on fresh well warmed 
stockings to retain the heat. 

A solution of permanganate of potassium in the proportion of 
10 grains to 1 pint of warm water may be used for bathing the feet 
just before retiring if there exists any unpleasant odor. 

Corns. — Make a shield of buckskin with an opening cut in it 
the size of the com. Touch the exposed part with carbolic acid, 
or take common sticking plaster, cut in the same form a circle with 
a small circle cut from it. Apply several of these, ene over the 
other, leaving the corn exposed, then in the opening drop a satu- 
rated solution of caustic soda and cover with a piece of the plaster. 
Eenew this every three or four days, and the cora will be gone in a 
couple of weeks or less, or pursue the same plan with the carbolic 
add. 

Aqua Ammonia applied as often as possible, is ahaost a c»- 
taiaa ou*. 



THK TOILET. 527 

Paring Corns should be done with a razor at regular inter- 
vals. EubKing with pumice stone is safer than paring. 

Soft Corns may have diluted carbolic acid used upon them. 
To touch them frequently with iodine is good. 

Bnnions. — On the first sign of their appearance wear a soft 
hollow ring of rubber to prevent pressure of the shoe. 

FiEST. — Carbolic acid, either in full strength or diluted, may 
be used for them twice a day. 

Second. — Painting with iodine is also resorted to. 

Third. — Thicken the yolk of 1 egg with salt and bind on. 
Voulticing must be resorted to if the bunion is too much inflamed. 

Ingrowing Nails. — Heat a small piece of mutton tallow in 
the bowl of a spoon, hold over a lamp until boiling hot, and pour 
on the sore place as much as possible between the nail and flesh. 
It will give instant relief, and one application often cures. If not, 
repeat. 

Let the nail grow even with the end of the toe and cut square 
actoss, and ingrowing nails will be a thing of the past. 

Cllilblains. — 1 drachm or 1 teaspoonful ammonia, strong; 6 
ounces rain water. Mix in a bottle. Wet 2 or 3 folds of muslin 
with this mixture, bind on the inflamed part or parts for the night. 
Repeat this two nights ; it gives great relief. 

Second. — Turpentine often gives relief. 

Thibd. — Paint the parts with a mixture of equal parts of 
iodine and ammonia. Very good.

TiKOTUBE OP EosES. — Fill a wide-mouthed bottle with freshly 
gathered rose leaves. Pour spirits of wine over them, cork the 
bottle and let stand until required for use; its perfume is nearly 
squal to ottar of foses. 




INDELIBLE MAEKING INK.— 100 grains nitrate of "silver, 
1 ounce distilled water, 2 drachms gum arabio, 1 scruple sap 
green or indigo. Mix. This is the beat indelible ink made. 

Everlasting Black Ink. — 2 gallons of rain water, ^ pound 
gum arabic, J pound copperas, f pound powdered nut-galls, 
^ pound of brown sugar. Bruise all and mix. This will keep 
writing good for hundreds of years, and is useful in ^copying deeds, 
etc. Shake the mixture occasionally for the first ten days. 

Common Black Ink. — 1 ounce extract of logwood; poui 
over it 2 quarts of boiling water, when dissolved add 1 drachm of 
yellow chromate of potassa. Do not put in old ink bottles, as 
other, ink decomposes it. Keep it from freezing. This will cpst 
ten cents. 

Red Ink. — ^No. 40 carmine 6 grains. No. 6 or 8 carmine 5 
grains, gum arabic a piece the size of two peas. Put in an ooncf 
vial and fill up with soft water. 

Blue Ink. — Sulphate of indigo and soft watex Color to

Copying; Ink may be made from common violet \mting ink 
by the addition of 6 parts of glycerine to 8 parts of ink; using 
only 5 parts of glycerine to 8 parts of the ink and it will copy well 
in fifteen minutes after it has been used. With fine white copying 
paper this ink will copy well ■v]?ithout the use of a press.

Gheen Paper. — Chrome green, mixed with lard. Apply same 
way. 

These sheets, any of them, alternated with writing paper, and 
the first sheet of writing paper written on in the usual manner with 
a solid pen, will produce two or three copies of a letter at once. 

Invisible lak. — Use 1 teaspoonful of white sugar dissolved 
in ^ cupful of boiling water, or use sweet mUk. Write with it 
in the ordinary manner. Holding to the fire will turn the ink 
brown so that it may be read, the heat affecting the saccharine 
matter. 

Paste for Scrap Books. — 1 J teaspoonfuls of pounded alum 
dissolved in 1 pint of cold water. Eub a tablespoonful of flour 
smooth in a little water. Bring the alum water to a boil and stir 
in the flour, let boil up, add a few drops of oil of cloves, or a few 
whole cloves. The alum prevents souring, the oil of cloves does 
away with mold. This is better than mucilage, as it does not in- 
jure the paper. 

Boiled flour paste, plain, may be made with red pepper tea 
instead of pure water, and will be free from the depredations of 
mice and insect pests. 

Mucilnge (Home-made). — Boil the gum that exudes from cherry 
trees in soft water until it is the proper consistency. This is pref- 
erable to that for sale. 

Cement for China. — Take a very thick solution of gum 
arable in water, and stir in plaster of Paris until the mixture be- 
comes of the proper consistency. Apply it with a brush to the 
fractured edges of the China and stick them together. In three 
days the article cannot be broken in the same place. 

InTisible Cement for Glassware.— Melt a little isinglass in 
spirits of wine, enough to cover; add a very little water; warm 
gently over a moderate fire. When thoroughly melted and mixed 
it will form a transparent glue which will re-unite broken glass eo 
firmly and nicely that the jointing will be scarcely perceptible.

consistency of very thick cream, or even soft putty and apply. The 
article should not be used until the cement has hardened, 
which wiU require from one day to a week, according to the amount 
used. It is really an invaluable article. Make only as required. 

To Clean Hair-brushes. — Wash in borax water. Do not 
wet the frame. Einse and hang up to dry by a string tied to the 
handle. Water with a teaspoonful of ammonia in is still better. 
Einse and hang up. 

Cranberries, To Keep. — Put in a keg of water and they 
will keep all winter. 

Lemons, To Keep. — Put in water. Change once a week. 
Will keep a long time. 

To Polish Tortoise Shell— Bub in rouge powder with a 
bit of soft cloth. Enb afterward with the hand. 

To Clean Gold Chains. — Put the chain in a small glass 
bottle with warm water, some pulverized chalk and a little 
grated Castile soap. Cork the bottle and shake vigorously. Einse 
in clear cold water, wipe on a towel and the polish will be surprising. 

To EemOYC Ink from paper or engravings, put ^ pound of 
chloride of lime to 1 quart of soft water. Shake and let stand 
twenty-four hours, then strain through a cotton cloth. To 1 ounce 
of this lime water add 1 teaspoonful of acetic acid. Apply to the 
blot and the ink will disappear. Absorb the moisture with blot- 
ting paper. The remainder may be bottled, closely corked and set 
aside for future use. 

To Eeaiove Grease Spots from books, papers or engravings. 
Apply French chalk, pulverized, to each side of the spot. Close 
the book or put a weight on the engraving. Eub off carefully the 
next day. Eepeat the operation if necessary. Lay a blotting 
paper over and apply heat if necessary. Common chalk can be 
used, but is not nearly as successful. 

To Remove Berry Stains from books or engravings. If 
one is so unfortunate as to crush a berry on a book or engraving, 
light a brimstone match and let the fume come in contact with the 
stain, and it wUl disappear as by magic.

To Prepare Wooden Fails for Use. — Give the inside of a new 
wooden pail 8 coats of copal varnish before using, and it. ■will not 
water-soak nor give a disagreeable flavor to water kept in it. 

To Eemove Taste from New Wooden Tessels.— Scald with 
boUing water; dissolve some pearl-ash or sal-soda in lukewarm 
water; wash well with the solution. Scald again before using. 

To Preserve Gilt Frames. — Cover them when new with a 
coat of white varnish. All specks can then be washed off with 
water without injury. This is an invaluable idea. 

To Harden the Soles of Boots and Shoes. — Apply a coat of 
gum-copal varnish ; let dry and give two more. This will double 
the wearing power of the sole-leather. Give an occasional coat 
as it seems to wear. For heavy boots two or three coats of gas- 
tar will render them almost impervious to damp, besides toughen- 
ing and hardening the leather. 

Liquid Glue, (Always Ebady). — FiH a glass jar with broken 
glue of the best quality; then fill up with acetic acid. Set the 
jar in hot water for a few hours until the glue melts. The result 
will be an excellent glue, always ready. 

Liquid Glue, (II). — 3 quarts soft water, IJ pounds white 
glue. Heat by steam or as above. Then add 8 ounces of shellac 
mixed with 4 ounces dry white lead. Lastly, 1 ounce hquid am- 
monia. Bottle while warm. This will make 180 bottles (^ oz.). 
Can be sold at a nice profit. China, etc., can be mended. 

Umbrellas, to Preserve.— Put umbrellas in the rack to dry 
with the handles down, that water may not run down and rust the 
wires. 

To Destroy Ant-beds in iiawns. — Stir up and pour on boil- 
ing water. 

To Kill Moss, Weefls and Earth Worms in Lawns.— Pul- 
verize fresh lime ; mix half-and-half with fresh pulverized eartn 
or leached ashes and sprinkle over the lawn. This is certain for 
the moss and earth-worms. A sprinkling of brine will kill grass ; 
and salt sprinkled on grass springing up in the crevices of stone 
or brick walks will destroy it.

Fire Kindlers. — To 1 pound of resin put 3 ounces of taUow. 
Melt together over a slow heat. When hot stir in fine saw-dust 
until very thick. Sprinkle a board with fine saw-dust and spread 
the mixture immediately over it to the thickness of one inch. 
When cold break into lumps one inch square. To do this con- 
venieptly grease the edge of a thin board, and while the mixture 
is warm mark the kindling off in squares, pressing in deep. When 
cold they will break off nicely. There is a good profit in selling 
this. 

Rats and Mice. — Peppermint sprigs laid around shelves and 
other places where mice frequent will drive them away. Chloride 
of Hme sprinkled around wherever rats or mice frequent will 
drive them away. Keep it in a bottle corked. , ' 

Ants and Hoaches. — Scatter powdered borax in their haunts 
and they will disappear. To free canary birds from mites, wash 
every part of the cage and perches and the hook and paint behind 
the hook with a strong solution of borax water. 

Second. — Ants may be driven away as foUows: Mix 1 tea- 
spoonful of tartar enietic with 1 teaspoonf ul of sugar. Put in a 
saucer and set where the ants are troublesome. One day will 
drive them away. Put in different places where they come. Fleas 
may be driven away by scattering about the localities troubled 
either lime or Cayenne pepper. 

To Fill Pin-cushions. — Use hair-combings which do not be- 
come damp. Dried coffee grounds are also nice, as they neither 
gather moisture nor rust. 

To Clean Plaster of Paris Figures.— Use toilet soap-suds 
and a shaving-brush. Einse well. Dipping them in a strong 
solution of alum- water will give them the appearance of alabaster. 

To Clean Old China and Maijolica.— The httle cracks and 
checks in china, majolica and earthenware will disappear and the 
dish look as good as new if boiled in milk. 

India Kuhher Cement.— Dissolve gutta-percha, cut in bits,in

benzine until it is the consistency of a thin mucilage. Let stand 
a few days. Clean the boots before using. Wet the patch with 
the cement and apply. Heat the cement before using by putting 
the bottle in hot water. 

Crockery Cement. — Stir freshly slaked lime in with the 
white of an egg until it is a paste. Apply to the edges and let 
dry at least three days. This will answer for marble as well as 
glass, china, etc. 

To Cut Glass Bottles. — Useless bottles may be turned into 
jelly glasses and jars by cutting off the top down to any required 
depth. Take common cotton cord and wrap two or three times 
around the bottle, a very little below where it is to be divided. 
Drop alcohol slowly on the cord until it is well saturated, then 
ignite with a match. When the flame has about died out, pour on 
a very little cold water, and it wiU immediately separate as 
smoothly as if cut. 

To Examine Wells. — Take a looking-glass at least a foot 
square and at morning or evening turn the slanting rays of the 
sun down into the well. Whatever impurities it contains may be 
readily seen and easily removed from an ordinary open well. This 
should be done often, as any impurity may be a source of seriouf 
illness in the family. A small fish put in the well will clear it i 
worms. 

To Preserve Fur Robes from Moths.— Dissolve i ounce of 
camphor in 1 pint of alcohol and spray the robes with this before 
putting up. 

To Cool Water without Ice.— FUl a jug or jar with water, 
cover it with several layers of carpet or other coarse cloth; satur- 
ate this with water. Keep in a cool, windy, shady place. The 
evaporation of a wet wrapper will absorb enough heat to keep 
water pleasantly cool. 

To Keep Butter without Ice.— Put on a plate, cover with 
a crock and proceed as above. 

To Keep Milk without Ice.— Fit a fine wire gauze lid to a 
tin paU, wrap as above and set in a raised shady window. This 
will be found purer and sweeter than milk kept in the majority of 
refrigerators. 



MISCELI.ANEOUS. 535 

To Keep Refrigerators Pure.-^Wa8h out the closets once a 
week with sal-soda and cold water. 

To Cleanse a Sponge.— Let it lie twelve hours in milk, and 
then rinse in cold water. 

To Extract Rnstod Screws. — Heat a poker or a rod of iron 
(if flat at the end, so much better) until red-hot, apply two or 
three minutes to the head of the rusted screw, and its withdrawal 
with a screw- driver will be as easy as possible. 

Fly-Poison. — Boil 4 ounces of quassia chips in 1 pint of 
water. When cold, strain and add enough cold water to make out 
the pint, also 2 ounces of alcohol. Bottle and cork. To use, pour 
a little in saucers, sweeten slightly with molasses and set where, 
most needed. This is poison to flies, but harmless to people. 

Fly-paper. — Mix together equal parts, by measure, of melted 
resin and castor oil. Stir until thoroughly mixed, which will take 
only a minute. While yet a little warm spread thin and evenly 
on any strong paper that is not porous, foolscap, writing papers, 
catalogue covers, show biUs, etc. Spread with a case knife shght- ' 
ly warmed. Leave a narrow border to handle with. Lay the 
papers on tables, shelves, or any spare place where flies are numer- 
ous. They will soon cover the papers. When the i^apers are 
covered, put in the stove and replace with another one. Be sure 
to use no water. 

C!oal Ashes for CuiTant Bushes.— a mulching of coal ashes 
around currant bushes is recommended as a preventive of the rav- 
ages of the currant worm. They have a power of absorption 
almost equal to charcoal. Thrown where they can absorb the 
waste liquids of the house, they will be found invaluable for dig- 
ging around trees or used to enrich the ground for early garden 
vegetables or raked thinly and carefully over the lawn. 

To Thaw Frozen Pumps. —Insert a section of small lead pipe 
the length of the frozen part and pour in hot water by the means 
of a funnel. The pipe will sink at the rate of one foot per minute. 
This is quicker than salt or heated iron rods. 

To Purify Cisterns where the water has an unpleasant 
odor, suspend in the water a mushn cloth containing one or more 
pounds of charcoal.

To Keep Dried Fruit from Insects.— Sprinkle with pow- 
dered sassafras as packed, this will keep out worms. If they have 
already made their appearance, put in a moderate oven for fifteen 
minutes. This is certain. 

To Loosen Glass Stoppers. — Dip the tip of a feather in oil 
and rub around the stopper close to the mouth of the bottle. Put 
the bottle near the fire. The heat wUl cause the oil to run down 
between the stopper and the bottle. When warm, strike the bottle 
gently on both sides with a bit of wood. The stopper will loosen. 
If not, repeat the process. 

To Color a Hair Switch Brown. — 1 cupful of green tea, 4 
tablespoonfuls of iron filings. Steep, strain, return to the stove in 
a rusty tin or iron dish. Have the switch washed clean, put in 
the dye, of which there should be just enough to cover well, let 
heat slowly until the desired shade. 

Second. Use 1 cupful of ground coffee and pursue the same 
course as before. Bits of rusty iron or nails can be substituted 
for iron filings. 

To Feed Cows Turnips and Potatoes.— Do it immediatelj' 
after milking and there wUl be no unpleasant flavor given to- the 
milk. 

Cider made from early apples has not good keeping quahties- 

To Keep Honey from Candying.— BoU the strained honey 
gently; skim clear. 

Mending Tinware. — Fill a small bottle two-thirds full of 
muriatic acid. Put in all the bits of zinc (an old wash board will 
answer) it will dissolve. Add a crumb of sal-ammonia and fill up 
with soft water. Wet the spot with the acid, apply a piece" of 
sheet zinc and hold a lighted candle underneath ; or buy solders 
apply the acid as above and drop melted solder on the spot. 






Fruit salads are a very popular dainty, and are often 
served for a first course, and again are served in place of 

wines between game and meat courses. 

Banana Salad. — Slice the ripe bananas with a silver 
fork. Place a generous layer in a deep glass dish and sprin* 
kle with powdered sugar and a little finely crushed ice. Add 
another layer of bananas, more sugar and more ice. Con- 
tinue in alternate layers until a sufficient quantity is prepared. 
Make a dressing of orange juice, sweetened and flavored with 
a little vanilla to taste. Pour over the fruit and set on ice 
two hour4 before serving. ' 

Fruit Salad, No. 1. — Prepare a syrup of sugar and water 
with a dash of vinegar, and when it has boiled for a minute or 
two take it off the fire and put any fruit into it. Green grapes 
(seeded), halves of apricots, plum and green gages, with 
small pieces of pine apple, are all good, but strawberries, 
raspberries and currants make it better when they are in sea- 
son. Arrange in a deep dish, pour the dressing over it. 
Lemon juice may be used to flavor the juice, omitting the 
vinegar. 

Fruit Salad, No. 3. — Cut three bananas in thin slices. 
Peel and cut one orange into slices, removing all the seeds 
and all the white peel. Place the fruit in a deep dish, sprin- 
kle 'sugar over it and a few drops of water or lemon juice. 
Set on ice for a couple of hours and then serve.

Pmit Salad, No. 3. — Take equal portions of orange 
pulp, grape fruit and Malaga grapes from which the seeds 
and skins have been removed. Mix the ingredients well to- 
gether, sugar, and serve in fancy cups like ices, or in half 
orange skins: 

There are so many ways of making a fruit salad that one 
can hardly go amiss. 

Fruit Salad, No. 4. — Jf you have any fruit left over, like 
canned peaches, pineapple or bananas, put a layer of peaches, 
cut fine, then one of pineapple and another of bananas till 
you have used up all the fruit. Sprinkle each layer with 
sugar and the top with grated cocoanut. Pour over all the 
juices from the peaches and pineapple. Prepare the night 
before. 

Tntti Frutti Fruit Salad. — A very delicious dish of fruit 
salad is simple to make and always much appreciated. The 
ingredients required will be as follows: Twelve sponge fin- 
gers, one pineapple, either tinned or fresh, four bananas, two 
large ripe pears, one Jaffa orange, a quarter of a pound of 
dried cherries and the same quantity of blanched almonds 
chopped, half a pint of whipped cream. In making the salad, 
cut up the fruit into small pieces, removing, of course, all 
peel, pips and core, lay it all into a deep glass or china dish 
into which you have previously placed the sponge fingers, 
then pour over it a little lemon juice or a wine glass of white 
wine, letting it stand for about half an hour, until thoroughly 
soaked, then sprinkle the chopped almonds and dried cherries 
on the top of the salad. Whip the cream, sweetening it with 
powdered sugar, and heap upon the salad just before it is 
wanted. If tinned pineapples be used the, fruit must be 
drained from the sirup, as too much moisture spoils the dish. 

Fruit Salad Dressing, No. 1. — Beat the yolks of 4 eggs 
until thick and light colored. Then gradually beat into them 
1 cupful of powdered sugar, beating until the sugar is dig- 



FRUIT SALADS. 539 

solved. Add the juice of 2 lemons and beat again. This 
dressing will do for any fruit salad. 

Alternate layers of oranges and bananas, peeled, seeded 
and sliced, arrange in alternate layers of bananas and oranges, 
putting dressing between each layer. Have the banana come 
on top, and pour the remainder of the dressing over it. Set 
on ice and serve very cold. Pineapples cut very fine, or 
large strawberries may be used with bananas for the salad. 
If acid fruits are used add a little more sugar; if sweet, taste- 
less fruits, more lemon juice. 

Fruit Salad Dressing, No. 2. — j4 teaspoonful cinna- 
mon, 4 tablespoonfuls powdered sugar, J^ cupful white wine 
or sherry. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. This dressing 
can be used for almost any kind of salad. 

Have dainty, pretty glasses, and fill them with chopped 
pineapple, thiiily sliced bananas, white grapes halved and 
seeded, the pulp and juice of oranges, and candied cherries. 
Pour the dressing over the fruit, and let stand in a cool place 
for an hour before serving. 

This is not a temperance recipe, and anyone with scruples 
as to its use can find in this department a sufficient number 
of other recipes to avoid this one. 

Apples, pears, peaches, apricots, bananas and oranges 
can be utilized in this way: Pare the fruit, cut in even halves 
or quarters, as preferred; remove the stones and arrange in a 
dish, and garnish with the green leaves that fruit growers 
obligingly send for that purpose in baskets of choice fruit in 
these days. 

Mock Pineapple Salad.— United orange and apple is to 
the taste like real pineapple. The ingredients are 3 or 4 
fine large apples, 5 or 6 good oranges, a wine glass of sherry, 
if you use it; sifted sugar to taste. Core and peel the apples, 
slice them rather thin and against the grain of the fruit, peel 
the oranges and remove all the outside yyhite pulp, slice them 



540 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

thicker than the apples, and, like them, crosswise. Lay a 
slice of orange upon a slice of apple of as near as possible 
the same size. Save every drop of orange juice for the sirup. 
Place the double slices in a circle in a glass dish. Pour the 
juice you have collected over the fruit, and the wine, too, if 
used. Sift white sugar thickly over it and add the juice of a 
lemon or two, even more if the fruit you are using is very 
sweet. 

Heavenly Hash. — Slice 3 bananas, pick into flakes half 
a pineapple, slice the pulp of 3 oranges. Place in glass dish 
in layers, sprinkle sugar between, pour over all the juice of a 
large lemon. Keep on ice 3 hours. Cocoanut, grated, can 
be sprinkled between every layer and on top and add much 
to the flavor. 

Pear Salad. — Put in a glass bowl 6 ripe pears. Cut in 
quarters or eighths. Make a boiled dressing of i teacupf ul 
granulated sugar, }l teacupf ul of water, i heaping teaspoon- 
ful green ginger, sliced. Strain and pour over pears. Keep 
on ice until served. 

Strawberry and Orange Salad. — Cover i quart of berries 
with powdered sugar, pour over half a teacupful of orange 
juice. 

Raspberry and Currant Salad. — Ripe raspberries, red 
or black, with ^ ripe currants, and sugar to taste, make de- 
lightful variety in preparing these fruits. Red raspberries, 
with powdered ice, are iniproved by adding to them a little 
lemon juice. 

Fruit Soups.— Fruit soups are frequently used to begin 
a lunch or served between courses at dinners, especially in 
summer weather. 

Orange Soup. — To make i quart of orange soup i quart 
of the strained fruit juice is necessary. Put over the fire in a 
double boiler, and add to it J^ cupful of granulated sugar. 
Moisten 2 tablespoonfuls of arrowroot with a little Pold 



FRUIT SALADS. 

orange juice and water, or with water, and stir into the hot 
juice. Stir until perfectly smooth and beginning to thicken. 
Cool before using, and serve in punch cups or ornamental 
glasses. Drop in each one, just before serving, a piece of 
ice the size of an English walnut. 

Two tablespoonfuls of curact may be used to flavor this 
soup, as it is a cordial flavored with orange peel, cinnamon 
and mace. 

Strawberry Soup. — Boil Yz cupfjil of sago and J^ cupful 
of currants in 3 pints of water until done. Add i pint of 
strawberries, boil 10 minutes, sweeten and serve cold. 

French Frait Salad with Eau de Cologne.— The French 
culinary expert employs Eau de Cologne to produce that 
subtle, delicious flavor so often tasted in fruit salads and other 
cookery confections. In the genuine cologne there is a com- 
pressed extract of rosemary and lemon thyme. A real French 
salad is as follows: Put in a salad bowl a layer of chopped 
ice well powdered with sugar, upon this a layer of bananas, 
again a sprinkling of chopped ice and sugar and after this 
bananas, repeating until the bowl is as full as required. Pour 
upon the fruit a wineglass of white wine and one of water in 
which has been dropped a lump of sugar that has absorbed 
3 drops of almond essence and another that has absorbed 3 
drops of genuine Eau de Cologne. 

Apple Salad.— One bunch of celery cut fine, 3 large 
apples cut in small pieces with the celery. 

Dressing.— 2 eggs, J^ cupful sugar, i teaspoonful mus- 
tard, J^ teaspoonful salt, a little butter and pepper and i 
cupful vinegar. Boil a few minutes, pour over hot. 

Mayonnaise Fruit Salad.— Sliced bananas and oranges 
cut in dice, white grapes carefully skinned and seeded and the

kernels of English walnuts cut in pieces. Mix together with 
a very little mayonnaise dressing and serve on tender lettuce 
leaves. 

Grape-Frnit Salad. — Take a crisp, fresh head of lettuce, 
wash the lettuce and let it stand in cold water until needed 
and then shake out the leaves and arrange them in the salad 
bowl. Take a ripe grape-fruit, cut it in half and with a spoon 
take out all the pulp, taking care to preserve the juice. Ar- 
range the pulp in the lettuce leaves, and make a dressing of 
oil and the juice. To every 3 tablespoonfuls of the oil allow 
% teaspoonful salt, and a quarter teaspoonf ul of pepper. Put 
these ingredients in a bowl, dissolving the salt and pepper in 
the oil. Stir in the fruit juice gradually until an emulsion. 
Pour it over the lettuce and pulp and serve. One tablespoon- 
ful of the juice should be sufficient for 3 tablespoonfuls of the 
juice should be sufQcient for 3 tablespoonfuls of the oil, but 
some may prefer a little more juice. Vigorous stirring is 
essential, and as soon as a whitish compound is formed the 
dressing is ready for use. 



Orange Jellv. — To make a clear orange jelly soak i 
package of gelatine in half a pint of cold water for an hour. 
Strain i pint of orange juice into a bowl and add the juice 
of 2 lemons, 2 cups of sugar, i pint of water, and the beaten 
whites of 2 eggs. Put the mixture into a saucepan with the 
soaked gelatine and let it cook ten minutes, or until the sugar 
and gelatine are dissolved. Strain and mold. 

Orange Baskets. — Orange baskets are very pretty for 
serving the jelly in. To make them select perfect fruit and 
place one on a plate, stem end up. Take a sharp knife and 
cut on each side of the stem, not quite half through the orange 
leaving a strip three-quarters of an inch wide for the handle, 



FRUIT SALADS. 54JS 

cut the orange across on both sides and remove the pieces. 
Carefully take out (he pulp and with sharp scissors point the 
edge of the peel and the basket is complete. The baskets 
may be filled with the liquid jelly, or you can mold the jelly 
in a shallow dish, and when it is firm cut it into tiny squares 
and heap them up in the baskets. 

Fruit Macedoiue with Jelly. — Make J^ pint each of cur- 
jrant, lemon, orange, and wine jelly, the former to be obtained 
by melting a glass of currant jelly. Pour some of the lemon 
jelly into a mold dipped in cold water; when it becomes firm 
ornament with layer of candied fruits and pour on a little of 
the currant jelly, which should be cool, but must not be allowed 
to harden; add another layer of fruits, and lastly the wine 
jelly. These different jellies may each be used in one layer or 
in two, as you may choose. Fine seeded raisins, figs cut small 
and drained, and preserved fruits may be mixed with or used 
instead of the candied fruits. Serve with whipped cream. 

Tutti Frntti Fruit Jelly. — Cover the contents of a box 
of gelatine with J^ pint of cold water and set aside for 30 
minutes ; then pour over it i pint of boiling water. Add i 
pound of sugar, the juice of 3 lemons and 2 oranges and strain. 
Moisten a plain mold with cold water, put in the bottom a 
layer of white grapes (seeded). Pour in a little of the pre- 
pared gelatine and set on ice until it congeals. Then put in a 
layer each of candied cherries, sliced bananas and orange 
pulp, alternating each with the gelatine and returning each 
time to the ice to congeal. Then another of sliced bananas, 
one of chopped almonds and one of white grapes, and so con- 
tinue until the mold is full, always separating each with the 
gelatine and letting it congeal. Pour over the top the remain^ 
ing gelatine and set aside to harden. A shorter way will be 
to put in the first layer of gelatine and then arrange the fruits 
in the order stated and pour over the top all the remainder of 
the gelatine at once. One layer of grated cocoanut is an inP 
provement to the jelly. 



Hygienic Food Values, 



"The physician of the future will be a chef," says Mrs. 
jenness Miller. And the suggestion contains much of truth 
when it is remembered that proper food, properly cooked, 
is one of the greatest_ factors in the health, beauty and wit 
of mankind, and that nature constantly offers us more and 
better remedies in her yearly round of seasonable foods 
than can be found anywhere in the druggist's pharmacy. 

Hygienic cookery implies a knowledge of the waste and 
repair of the human system, and of the foods best calcu- 
lated to sustain the individual for the duties required of him. ^ 

It would be suicidal to feed the farmer in the field and 
the man at the desk upon the same food, since what would 
strengthen the one for Ms toil would be impossible for the 
other to assimilate. 

The value of a fruit diet is incalculable. Digested in 
about eighty-five minutes, while animal food requires from 
four to five hours, there is nothing that so brightens the 
complexion and clears the brain as a diet of fresh, well^ 
ripened fruits (not forge iting baths and exercise). 

Apples are the finest spring medicines that can be 
found. They contain more phosphorus in a digestible form 
than any other vegetable product. The apple constantly 
used promotes the action of the liver, cures indigestion, 
promotes sound and healthy sleep, assists the kidneys, and 
prevents calculus growths, while it is a preventive of throat 
troubles. It is said by good authority that a peeled apple 
eaten every night before retiring is a sure cure for 
dyspepsia. ' 

«?5? - 



HYGIENIC FOOD VALUES. S4S 

Oranges are a great aid to the digestion, and a remark, 
able sedative to the nerves. If they were properly appre- 
ciated there would be much less of the bilious complexions 
that are so common. Their acid is a tonic and imprciver for 
the blood. The orange must be perfectly ripe and the 
juice only used. Five or six oranges daily are not too 
many to feel their full benefit. 

\i Lemons are of marked benefit to a bilious tempera- 
ment. They may be used instead of quinine for malaria. 
The juice of one lemon should be taken in a glass oi water 
without sugar. Never take it clear, since the lemon acid is 
very strong and likely to corrode the lining of the stomach; 

Pineapples have much the same effect. The juice will 
cure dyspepsia. It is called a vegetable pepsin, strengthen- 
ing the digestive powers, driving away malaria, and whiten- 
ing the skin. Pineapple juice used in case of diphtheria has 
never been known to fail in clearing the throat and afford- 
ing a cure. Teaspoonf ul doses should he given every 
fifteen minutes in bad cases. When pineapples are cheap 
it is well to store up the juice for time of need. 

Orape Fruit is another excellent spring tonic. 

Grapes are raw wine. They cover a wide field in 
Nature's economy. The pulp is nourishing, the juice is 
laxative. They clear the voice and strengthen the vocal 
tissues. 

Rhubarit), made up in the old-fashioned sauce, is a 
good spring tonic and blood purifier. 

Canned Fruits, dried firuits, figs, dates, prunes, and 
even dried-apple sauce, are not to be despised as par*s of a 
fruit diet. 

YegetaWes take the next place of honor. '^ 

Celery is a sovereigri cure for nervousness, and is also 
a remarkable remedy for rheumatism. Indeed, it Is 



546 THREE MEALS A DAY« 

asserted that this disease is impossible if celery is cooked 
and freely eaten. It is asserted that an alkaline blood is the 
result of a free use of celery, and where this is the case 
rheumatism and gout cannot exist. Cook in a little water. 
When soft add a small amount of rich milk, and season with 
butter, pepper and salt. Serve raw also. 

Onions are another vegetable whose virtues are too often 
neglected. They are very good blood purifiers and com- 
plexion improvers. They are laxative, anti-nervous, induce 
sleep — as does also lettuce. One small onion eaten every 
night before going to bed is a well-known physician's pre- 
scription for numerous affections of the head and for break- 
ing up colds. In the case of children they are an active 
vermifuge, taken raw or cooked, and also a preventive of" 
contagious diseases such as scarlet fever and diphtheria. 
Their unpleasant odor can be overcome by eating a small 
sprig of parsley immediately after the meal. 

Salads, plain, green salads, such as those of lettuce, 
celery, cabbage and cress, are also helpful. A French 
dressing is an admirable addition to such salads. Make this 
by simply taking two-thirds salad oil and one-third vinegar, 
seasoned with pepper and salt. Turn this over the greens, 
and toss lightly., A Mayonnaise dressing is also good. 

Salad Oil, or olive oil, thus used is particularly bene- 
ficial to the system, especially in the case of nervous 
women of sedentary habits, supplying them with the fatty 
matter their starved tissues demand. So any woman that 
can persuade herself to use this healing, nourishing vege- 
table oil with her daily meals will find herself greatly 
benefited. The dyspeptic should also learn to eat olives as 
a means of lubricating and repairing a weak stomach. 

Butter is another oily substance that is a most valuable 
article of food, and may be looked upon as a preventive of 
tuberculosis. Thin bread and butter is prescribed by many 



HYGIENIC FOOD VALUES. 54? 

physicians. It is very digestible taken in this manner, 
where the stomach would refuse it if offered otherwise. 

Honey is an article that may be taken as both food and 
medicine. Let children eat all the honey they desire and 
throat troubles will be almost unknown. 

Oatmeal is a heavy diet and not at all fitted to the 
nervous, sedentary man, woman or child. Cracked wheat, 
well cooked, is far better. The laboring man or woman, 
alone, can digest oatmeal properly. 

Milk diet, except where especially prescribed by a 
physician, is another fallacy. The habit of taking milk on 
any and every occasion is responsible for much biliousness 
and sallowiiess of skin. Milk is difficult of digestion, and 
on that account should be taken in sips. By this means the 
curd which forms in the stomach, instead of forming in one 
solid, indigestible mass, is deposited in spongy bits, upon 
which the gastric fluids can readily act. Milk, heated to 
the scalding point, is more easily digested, and proves a 
restful, stimulating drink to the weary. 

Buttermilk is a much more healthful drink. It aids 
digestion, exterminates the waste matter that clogs the 
system, qi;iiets the nerves, and induces sleep. 

Eoasted Meats are more digestible than boiled, and 
broiled than fried. The white meats, chicken, lamb and 
mutton, are more easily assimilated than the red meats, and 
should be used by nervous, sedentary people, and in every 
way the diet should be as nearly adapted to the vocation as 
possible. 

A too free indulgence in animal food is often- respon- 
sible for many of the diseases that come with advanced age, 
such as heart disease, apoplexy, articular rheumatism, 
Bright's disease, gout, etc. ^ ,\

SALADS. 

French Dressing.— Two tablespoonfuls of salad oil 
(olive), blended with one tablespoonful of vinegar, season 
with one saltspoonful salt, and one-half saltspoonful 
pepper. This is very nice and wholesome for all green 
salads. Pour over the salad just before serving and toss 
lightly. Some prefer to make it at the table, measuring it 
out in the wooden salad spoon. If the taste of the oil is 
preferred, use the oil first ; if the vinegar, use that first. 

Mayonnaise Sauce is the other prominent salad dress- 
ing. Directions for this will be found in the department of 
Salads. 

To a lettuce salad served with dressing, may be added a 
cucumber, sliced, or some water-cress. Dandelion leaves 
may be added in summer, or cress, parsley, olives, or green 
onions may be chopped and scattered over the lettuce, to 
make savory variety. 

Cucumbers make a good salad, sliced and served with 
either of the above dressings. Cold boiled string beans 
also. 

Sanana Salad. — Peel the bananas, slice in half length- 
wise. Serve each one on a lettuce leaf with a Mayonnaise 
sauce or some other preferred salad dressing poured over 
it. Delicious. 

Cauliflower pulled to jbits and served cold with a salad 
dressing, is also very nice. 

Bananas may be removed from the skin by taking out 
a section the entire length. Cut the fruit in small dice, 
mix with a French or Mayonnaise dressing, and refill the 
skins. Serve by placing each banana on a crisp lettuce 
leaf, and at once, since the fruit soon discolors. 



HYGIENIC FOOD VALUES. 549 

Walnut and Orange Salad. — Remove the peel of the 
pranges and every particle of the white skin, slice very thin 
Jettgthwise of the orange, removing as much of the partition 
walls as possible. Slice English walnuts very thin. To 
two cups of sliced orange add one cup of nuts. Dress with 
». small quantity of Mayonnaise or French dressing. Serve 
pn a bed of lettuce or water-cress. Particularly nice with 
game. 

Waldorf Salad. — Mix in equal parts celery cut in half 
inch pieces, and sour crisp apples cut in slices. Salt and 
pepper lightly and mix with Mayonnaise dressing. Serve 
pn a lettuce leaf in individual salad dishes, or in the salad 
bowl upon a bed of lettuce or cress. 

Dandelion Salad. — Half a pound of dandelion greens, 
;;ut fine. Cover with following dressing, mixing thoroughly : 
One tablespoonful olive oil, 2 tablespoonf uls vinegar, i 
teaspoonful of sugar, a pinch of salt and a dash of, pepper. 
This last is a modified form of French dressing, and may be 
preferred by some to use in place of it. A little mustard 
may be added if wished. 

Fish Salad. — Take any kind of boiled fish that has been 
"left over," pick to' bits and arrange on a bed of lettuce 
leaves. Cover with Mayonnaise or any preferred salad 
dressing. 

Sardine Salad.^-Drain the oil from 6 or 8 sardines, and, 
.unless the oil is very sweet, rinse, quickly. Remove skin 
and bone, cut to bits*^ and squeeze over them the juice of 
one lemon. Tear lettuce leavi^s fine, mince two hard-boiled 
eggs, mix lettuce, sardines and eggs together in the 
salad bowl, and cover with a French dressing made with 
lemon juice instead of vinegar. A Mayonnaise or some 
preferred dressing may be substituted.

MEAT SAUCES. 

Tomato Sauce. — One quart can of tomatoes, 2 table- 
spoonfuls of butter, i tablespoonful of flour, 2 cloves and a 
slice of onion. Cook tomatoes, cloves and onion ten min- 
utes. Heat the butter in a small frying pan and stir in the 
flour. When smooth and brown, add to the tomato sauce 
and cook ten minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper, and rub through a strainer. This is nice for fish, 
meat or macaroni. 

Tomato Sauce to Keep. — Chop i gallon of ripe toma- 
toes without peeling, and 5 pods of red pepper. Cook until 
very tender. Strain through a coarse cloth. Then stir into 
it 2 ounces of black pepper, J^ ounce of white mustard seed, 
y^, ounce allspice, and i pint of vinegar. Cook very slowly 
for three hours. While still warm, bottle and cork tightly. 
This will keep for years, and is very nice for hot or cold 
meats. 

UP-TO-DATE SANDV^ICHES. 

Sandwich Dressing. — Mix 2 tablespoonfuls of mustard 
with enough hot water to form a paste. Three tablespoon- 
fuls of salad oil, or the same amount of melted butter. 
Add a little red or white pepper, salt, and the beaten yolk of 
I egg. Stir thoroughly and set aside to cool. Warm 
slightly before spreading upon the sandwich. This should 
be used in place of butter. 

DevUed Ham Sandwich. — Mince about i pound of 
ham fine. To this add i minced pickle, i tablespoon of 
prepared mustard, i teaspoonful sugar. Omit the pickle if 
desired. Mix thoroughly. Melt in a saucepan i table- 
spoonful of butter, and when it boils add i beaten e^gg. 
Add to the prepared ham and stir together. Do not use 
xmtil cold. Butter the bread for the sandwiches very 



HYGIENIC FOOD VALUES. 551 

lightly. Tongue, cornbeef and chicken can be treated the 
same way. 

Welsh Rarebit Sandwiches.— Into i cupful of grated 
cheese rub the powdered yolks of two eggs. Moisten with . 
melted butter ai^d season with mustard, salt and pepper. 
Spread this mixture thickly between slices of lightly but- 
tered bread. 

Nut Sandwiches. — Chop English walnuts, hickory nuts 
or pecans fine. If preferred, add Yz as much celery, also 
chopped fine. Mix to a paste with Mayonnaise or any pre- 
ferred salad dressing. Spread between buttered slices of 
bread. Or nuts may be chopped and mixed with an equal 
quantity of chopped hard-boiled eggs, or, better still, rub 
the eggs to a paste. Spread as above. 

Walnut Sandwiches. — Melt cheese and spread over 
small round crackers. While the cheese is warm, press the 
perfect half of an English walnut down on each one, 
rounded side uppermost. (The cheese when cold holds 
them in place.) iMelted butter can be used in place of the 
cheese. Serve these with the salad course. Delicious and' 
ornamental. This recipe is one devised by a famous 
caterer. Pile pyramid fashion on an ornamental plate. 

lettuce Sandwiches. — Spread buttered slices of bread 
with salad dressing and lay between them fresh, crisp let- 
tuce leaves — heart leayes,. if possible. Serve at once. 

CAKES. 

Marshmallow Cake. — Soak 2 tablespoonfuls of 
gelatin in water enough to cover. Add ^ cup of boiling 
water. When dissolved beat until stiff with 2 cups of 
powdered sugar. Flavor with vanilla. Wet a cake tin with _ 
cold water and spread the mixture smoothly in. Make this 
at night. In the morning make a cake as follows: ^ cupful 
of butter, i^ cupfuls sugar, 2 cupfuls flour, ^ cupful milk, 



SS« THREE MEALS A DAY. 

whites of s eggs, 2 level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, j^ 
teaspoonful of vanilla extract. Beat the butter to a cream, 
gradually beat into it the sugar and vanilla. Add the milk 
and the stiffly beaterl whites of the eggs. Then the flour 
and baking powder sifted together. Bake this in two lay- 
ers, in tins the size of the one containing the filling. Put 
them together while warm, the filling between the two ca,ke 
layers. Frost. Very delicious. Use either square or 
round tins. 

Second Marshmallow Filling. — Boil 2 cupfuls of sugar 
with I cup of water until it threads. Just before taking it 
off the fire put in J^ pound of marshmallows cut in bits to 
melt easily. Pour this mixture into the beaten whites of 
2 eggs, and beat until cold. Then spread. Frost the cake 
and decorate the top with marshmallows cut in half. Make 
the cake after above rule. Bake in three layers. 

Bevil's Food.— ' 

2 cupfuls brown sugar creamed with 
I cupful butter. 

I cupful milk. 

3 cupfuls flour. 

3 teaspoonfuls of baking powder sifted with the flour. 

4 eggs beaten separately. 

Flavor with vanilla. Grate or cut finely j{ pound Bak- 
er's chocolate, add^ cup of milk, and boil iintii thick. Pour 
this into the cake batter, and mix thoroughly. This last 
may be added before the flour is stirred in, or after all the 
ingredients are mixed. ' 

Brownstone Front Cake.— Boil together until thin: 

}4 cupful Baker's chocolate. ' 

}4 cupful sweet milk. 

I cupful sugar. 

Yolk of I egg. 
Let cool. 



HYGIENIC FOOD VALUEa 553 

Second Part. 

1 cupful sugar creamed with 
J^ cupful birtter. 

J^ cupful sweet milk. 

2^ cupfuls flour sifted with 

2 teaspoonfuls baking powder.

in four layers and put together with chocolate frosting. 

Ambrosia Cake. — 

^ cupful of butter. 

2 cupfuls sugar. 

4 eggs. 

% cupful milk. 

3 cupfuls flour. ^ 
Bake in 4 jelly cake tins. When cold put between the 

layers the following filling: 

Filling, 

I pint of whipped cream. 

1 cocoanut, grated. 

2 eggs. 

I cupful of sugar. 

Grated rind of i and juice of 2 oranges. 
Make the filling as near as possible time to serve, since , 
it is liable to soak into the cake. 



MISCBLIvANEOUS DISHES. 

Green Turtle Soup. — Cook this soup the day before it 
is to be used, that every particle of fat may be removed. 
Chop up i«3 coarse part of the meat with the bones and put 
on to boil with all kinds of soup vegetable?, onions and 
pepper and salt. Skim it well and allow it to boil getit::^ 



554 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

four hours. It is well to add a veal bone to this stock. 
When all is boiled to a pulp, strain, and let stand over 
night. The next day remove from the top eviery vestige of 
fat, and put it on to boil. Cut up in small pieces the finer 
turtle meat and the green fat, pour it into the turtle stock, 
and simmer gently two hours. It is well to let the green 
fat boil up once in clear water before putting in the soup, 
so as to remove all impurities. The turtle eggs should be 
boiled alone for four hours, placed in the tureen and the 
hot soup po.ured over them. Before serving melt a large 
tablespoonful of butter and brown with it 2 tablespoonfuls 
of flour. Stir smoothly into the soup. Flavor with 
2 tablespoonfuls of walnut catsup or mushroom catsup. 
Just before serving add i wineglass of Madeira wine, or ^ 
wineglass of lemon juice. Be sure it does not boil after the 
wine js added, as that takes away the flavor. Horse-meat 
balls are added by some cooks. 

Flanked Shad, or Whiteflsh.— Take a two-inch plank 
the size of the oven, made of some hard wood, oak or 
.hickory. Heat in the oven until thoroughly hot. Have 
the fish split down the back, put it, skin down, on the hot 
plank; dust with salt and pepper, and baste with melted 
butter. Put the plank on the oven bottom and bake about 
thirty minutes, basting three times. When the fish is done 
take from the oven, garnish with parsley and lemon, and 
send to the table on the plank, placed on a Japanese 
lacquered tray a little larger than the plank. A large platter 
may be used instead. 

The flavor imparted by the hot plank makes the fish 
delicious. 

Chestnut Dressing for Turkey.— This dressing gives 
a peculiarly piquant taste to the fowl. To make it, shell a 
quart of chestnuts, put in hot water, and boil until the 
skins soften. Drain off the water and remove the skins. 
Replace the blanched chestnuts in hot wat^r and bojl until 



HYGIENIC FOOD VALUES. SSS 

tender, then chop the nuts fine, or press through a colanden 
Mix with one-half the quantity of bread crumbs. Season 
highly with salt, pepper and melted butter (i tablespoon- 
ful), moisten with a tablespoonful of cream or soup stock. 

Baked Bananas. — Raw bananas are really indigestible. 
Baked they are, an ideal food for children, nervous persons, 
anaemics, and brain-workers. 

Bake in the skin for fifteen or twenty minutes until 
they are quite soft and burst the skins. 

Second, remove from the skin and lay in a baking pan 
with a very little water. Bake until perfectly soft. Serve 
hot. Some prefer to dust sugar over the top and sprinkle 
with lemon juice. This gives an added flavor. A nice 
dessert. 

Wine Jelly for Inyalids. — One 2 -ounce package of 
gelatin soaked two hours in a large cup, 2 cups of white 
wine or sherry, i lemon, all the juice, and half the grated 
peel, 2 cups of boiling water. Put the soaked gelatin, 
lemon and sugar together, and cover for one-half hour. 
Pour on the boiling water, stir and strain. Add the wine, 
strain again through a flannel bag without squeezing. Put 
in mould to cool. Wet the mould in cold water first. 
This can be served with whipped cream, or plain, and is 
very strengthening. 

Cheese Straws. — Roll thin a rich pie crust and spread 
thickly with grated cheese. Add a dash of cayenne pepper. 
Fold over several times ; roll again and spread with cheese. 
Repeat this process three times. Then roll out one-fourth 
of an inch thick^ cut in strips four inches wide, and then 
cut in sticks one-fourth inch wide, or even narrower. Bake 
a light brown. Put buttered sheets of paper in the baking 
tin. Pile cob-house fashion on the plate, or tie in bundles 
with bright ribbons. Serve with salads. 



556 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

ADDITIONAL TOIIvET HINTS. 

There is nothing that tequires so much care in selection 
as a cold cream, or any oily substance that is to be used on 
the face. Only vegetable oils should be used. Animal or 
mineral oils cause a growth of hair, and for that reason 
should never touch the body. Do not use a cream too 
lavishly. The skin will only absorb a little, and the 
remainder, if left upon the surface, is worse than wasted. 

First bathe the face^ and, in the case of an oily, porous 
skin, use some astringent lotion. Let this dry in, and then 
apply the cream or skin food, rubbing lightly in the oppor 
site direction of any lines that may be forming. Wipe 
away any that is left unabsorbed. 

Astringent Wash for Oily Skin. — 

White-rose leaves, dried, i ounce. 

Pure white wine vinegar, ^ pint. 

Rose water, i pint. 
Pour the vinegar on the rose leaves, and let stand two 
weeks, strain through muslin and add the rose water. 
Bottle. It can be made without the rose leaves, but is not 
as satisfactory. Sponge the face and let dry in. 

' Porous Skin. — The opium found in stems of lettuce 
flower stalks is refining to the skin and absorbs the oil so 
likely to appear on porous skins. Break off the stalks and rub 
the milky juice over the face at night, allowing it to dry on. 
Also use the above rose wash, making it more 
effective by adding to it 2 ounces of rectified wine. Thp 
dried rose leaves can be found in any large drug store. 

Cucuml)er Lotion. — This is perhaps the best lotion 
that can be used for an oily or porous skin^ besides its 
whitening qualities. 

3 tablespoonfuls cucumber juice pressed from the 

fresh fruit. 
J^ pint elder-flower water. 



HYGIENIC FOOD VALUES. 557 

2 tablespoonfuls cologne. 

^ ounce simple tincture of benzoin. 
Put the cucumber juice in a bottle with part of the 
elder-flower 'water, and the cologne. Shake and add the 
benzoin drop by drop, shaking the mixture frequently. 
Add the remainder of the elder-flower water, and it is ready 
for use. If there is much deposit from the benzoin, strain 
through muslin. This will keep a year. The arsenic in the 
cucumber makes it a natural face bleach, whitening and 
smoothing the skin. 

Face Bleach. — Use cucumber lotion. 

Rose Cream. — Healing and soothing. 

Pure White wax, J^ ounce. 

Spermaceti, 2 ounces. 

Oil of sweet almonds, 3 ounces. 

Rose-water, ij^ ounces. 
Melt the first three ingredients in a porcelain saucepan 
over the fire or an alcohol lamp. Do not let boil. When 
hot remove and add the rose-water, stirring all the time. 
Beat or stir with a silver spoon, until cold, white and 
creamy. One-half tfeaspoonful of borax in the rose-water 
will whiten the cream and the face also. It may be per- 
fumed still further by the addition of a few drops of oil of 
rose. Warm the little jars in which it is to be packed and 
it will sink smoothly in place. This is one of the best 
creams in use. It whitens and smooths the skin, and will 
cure pimples and blackheads if not of too long standing. 

Rose Blossom Skin Food.— 

Lanoline, i ounce. 

White wax, J^ ounce. 

Spermaceti, ^ ounce. 

Sweet almond oil, i ounce. 

Cocoanut oil, i ounce. 

Tincture (simple) of ben2X)in, i teaspoonful. 

Rose-water, i ounce. 



SS8 THREE MEALS A DAY. 

Melt the first five ingredients together. Do not let 
boil. Remove from fire, and stir rapidly, adding the rose- ■ 
water and benzoin as quickly as possible. Stir and beat 
until a smooth soft yellow cream is the result. Pack into 
small china or glass jars. Cover closely. Apply with 
massage every night. This refines the skin and feeds the 
tissues. Lanoline is the best skin cleanser in existence, 
but cannot be used alone. 

CHAFING-DISH RECIPES. 

Since the introduction of the chafing-dish the number 
of inviting viands that can be prepared by its use are 
increasing, and the bright little nickel utensil is to be found 
in constant use. 

For informal suppers, for light meals in a sipall apart- 
ment, they are indispensable. An alcohol lamp with a 
small tea-kettle is a convenient adjunct. Fill the lower pan 
of the chafing-dish hjsli full of boiling water. Place the top 
pan on the lower one, light the lamp, and all is ready for 
work. If it is for a supper party, where the cooking is to 
be done at table, have all the materials prepared, as much 
as possible, beforehand. Where the dish in preparation is 
to be fried remove the hot water pan from chafing-dish. 

Creamed Halibut. — Put in a chafing-dish 3 pats of 
butter. In preparing for chafing-dish cookery it is well to 
have these little pats of butter, weighing about an, ounce, 
ready beforehand. When the butter is thoroughly heated, 
put in ij^ pounds' fresh halibut, cut lengthwise, bone out, 
season with salt and add a teaspoonful of lenion juice or 
vinegar. Cook for ten minutes, turn and cook the other 
side eight minutes, being careful not to let stick to the pan, 
and a<Jd one teaspoonful each of chopped olives and parsley 
to the sauce. The olives may be omitted if desired. 

Welsh RareMt.— This is a good chafing-dish recipe.
