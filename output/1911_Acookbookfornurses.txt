PREFACE 

A WORD of apology seems necessary in adding another cook book 
to the many admirable ones already upon the market. It has long 
seemed to the author that much might be done in condensing recipes. 
She has not been able to find a book which seemed to bring together 
clearly enough recipes for dishes identical in method of cooking and 
difiEering in only one or two ingredients. 

An attempt to accomplish this, and at the same time to offer to 
nurses a collection of recipes in small enough compass for their already 
crowded grips, is the excuse for " A Cook Book for Nurses."

MILK PREPARATIONS 

To Sterilize Milk: Utensils: If a milk sterilizer is not con- 
venient, have a pail with tight-fitting cover. Have a hole made in 
the cover. Insert in the hole a cork, and through the cork put 
a glass thermometer so that the temperature may be ascertained 
without removing the lid. Put in the bottom of the pail an 
inverted pie plate. Use glass bottles with flat bottoms unless a 
rack is at hand, when rounded bottoms are practicable. 

Method: Sterilize the bottles by boiling 20 minutes. Fill 
them nearly full of milk. Plug with sterile absorbent cottoa 
Set them on the plate ; fill the pail with sufficient cold water to 
come above the milk. Brin^slowly to boiling point (212° F. or 
100® C). Boil 20 minutes, v^ol as quickly as possible by plung-

ing the bottles into warm water for a few minutes until bottles 
are cooled, then surround with ice water. 

Pasteurization: The utensils and method for pasteurizing 
milk are the same as for sterilizing, except that the water is 
brought to 170° F. or 76° C. instead of to the boiling point.

Clean, disjoint, remove flesh from bones, cut in 
small pieces. Pound the bones until well broken. 

Put prepared meat in saucepan, add the cold water, bring 
slowly to boiling point. Simmer .4 hours. Strain into jar or 
earthen bowl. When cool put in ice box. When wanted for use 
carefully remove the fat with a spoon. If all cannot be removed 
in this way, pass soft paper lightly over the surface of the broth 
until every particle of fat is absorbed. Add salt, using i tsp. to 
every c. broth. Heat carefully, but do not let it boil. Serve in 
heated bowl or cup. To vary the flavor, cook a few pieces of 
celery or of parsley, or i tsp. of any herb, or i tbsp. of any grain, 
or 4 tbsp. tapioca with the meat and water.

is especially recommended where beef juice is needed in large 
quantities.) 

Method I : Cut steak in small pieces, discarding all the fat. 
Thoroughly heat the press in hot water, then drain. Put the 
meat in a dry pan. Shake over fire until thoroughly hot but not 
cooked. Put at once into press. Squeeze out all the juice 
possible. More juice will usually be obtained by heating meat 
and press a second time. 

Method II: Heat the press as in Method I. Trim the fat 
from the steak, put on broiler and sear on both sides. Cut in 
small pieces and squeeze as in preceding method. Where much 
beef juice is to be obtained, Method I is preferable.

FRUIT BEVERAGES 

General Directions : The water used in making fruit beverages 
should be boiled, then cooled.- The fruit juices should be strained. 
The beverages should be served ice cold. If purity of ice supply 
is doubted, a good way of serving is to set the glass containing the 
drink in a glass or bowl filled with chopped ice. Syrup is a better 
sweetener than sugar. It may be made in large quantities and 
bottled for use.

CHAPTER VI 

NOTES ON SERVING 

Three points are to be observed in serving a tray : 
First. Cleanliness. 
Second. Convenience. 
Third. Attractiveness. 

Cleanliness. 

{a) Be sure that tray and tray cloth are spotlessly clean ; 
china, glass, and silver bright and shining. 

(6) When a tray is removed from the sick room, destroy all 
foods remaining on it. 

Attractiveness. 

(a) Let size of tray be proportionate to meal to be served. 

Do not use a large tray for a fluid meal. And for a conva- 
lescent's meal use a tray large enough to hold the necessary dishes 
without crowding. 

(6) Do not offer too large portions. Smaller portions are 
more tempting, and also prevent waste. It is better to give a 
second portion than to overload the plate. 

(c) Keep the rims of plates and saucers clean. Take care 
that in serving liquids, the parts of the bowl or glass above the 
level of the liquid are not streaked with it. 

(d) In cutting bread or toast have the pieces uniform in shape 
and size. 

(e) Serve hot dishes Aot. Cold dishes co/d, but not chilled. 
Do not serve lukewarm foods. 

(/) If it can be avoided, do not use dishes of different colors. 
(^) In garnishing dishes, let the garnish be simple. 
(A) If flowers are available, one or two laid in the napkin are 
attractive, but do not use too many. 

67 



68 



A Cook Book for Nurses 



(i) Cover the whole tray with a napkm when carrying it from 
the kitchen to the patient. 



Convenience. 




DIAGRAM OF CONVALESCENT TRAY 



1 . On a breakfast tray, this should be the cereal or fruit dish ; 
on dinner tray the soup bowl or plate ; on supper tray the plate 
containing the principal food of the meal. 

2. Knife, edge of blade towards plate. 

3. Soup spoon, if needed. 

4. Fork, prongs turned up. If more than one fork is needed 
place it here, having the fork to be used first farthest from the 
plate. 

5. Teaspoons. Be sure to have as many as will be needed 
on the tray so as to avoid delay. 

6. Butter chip, unless bread and butter plate is used. 

7. Glass. Fill glasses only three-fourths full. 

8. Salt and pepper. 

9. Sugar bowl. 



Notes on Serving 69 

10. Cream pitcher. 

11. Tea or coffee pot. 

12. Cup and saucer. Take care that handles of teapot, cream 
pitcher, and cup are all turned towards outside of tray. 

13. Plate of bread or toast. If a dinner tray, the plate of 
bread may be put over the soup bowl, and this may be the plate 
holding the main part of the dinner. 

14. Dessert. 

15. Extra vegetables, or salad. 

The napkin may be put on the bread plate, and the bread put 
within a fold of it, or it may be put at the right of the soup spoon.

PREFACE 

A WORD of apology seems necessary in adding another cook book 
to the many admirable ones already upon the market. It has long 
seemed to the author that much might be done in condensing recipes. 
She has not been able to find a book which seemed to bring together 
clearly enough recipes for dishes identical in method of cooking and 
differing in only one or two ingredients. 

An attempt to accomplish this, and at the same time to offer to 
nurses a collection of recipes in small enough compass for their already 
crowded grips, is the excuse for " A Cook Book for Nurses."

MILK PREPARATIONS 

To Sterilize Milk: Utensils: If a milk sterilizer is not con- 
venient, have a pail with tight-fitting cover. Have a hole made in 
the cover. Insert in the hole a cork, and through the cork put 
a glass thermometer so that the temperature may be ascertained 
without removing the lid. Put in the bottom of the pail an 
inverted pie plate. Use glass bottles with flat bottoms unless a 
rack is at hand, when rounded bottoms are practicable. 

Method: Sterilize the bottles by boiling 20 minutes. Fill 
them nearly full of milk. Plug with sterile absorbent cotton. 
Set them on the plate ; fill the pail with sufficient cold water to 
come above the milk. Bring slowly to boiling point (212° F. or 
ICX)° C). Boil 20 minutes. Cool as quickly as possible by plung-

ing the bottles into warm water for a few minutes until bottles 
are cooled, then surround with ice water. 

Pasteurization: The utensils and method for pasteurizing 
milk are the same as for sterilizing, except that the water is 
brought to 170° F. or 76'' C. instead of to the boiling point. 

KOUMYSS 

Milk, I qt. 

Yeast, -\ cake. 

Sugar, li tbsps.

Dissolve the yeast cake in \ c. lukewarm boiled water. Add to 
the milk with the sugar. Pour into the bottles, filling them to 
within two inches of the top. Cork tightly and tie the corks 
down with strong twine. Shake well. Let stand in warm place 
6 hours, then put on ice for 24 hours.

2 tbsps. lemon juice. 
I tsp. liquid rennet or I junket tablet 
crushed in I tbsp. lukewarm water. 
Warm milk ; when rennet is to be used, care must be taken 
that temperature of milk does not go above 105° F. Add coagu- 
lating agent. Let stand in warm place until a firm curd is formed. 
This takes about 30 minutes. Strain through double piece of cheese 
cloth. 



WHEY FOR INFANT FEEDING 

If whey is to be used for infant feeding, that obtained from 
rennet must be used, and the whey must be heated to 150° F. 
before adding it to cream. Otherwise the mixture will curdle 
when warmed at feeding time.

BROTHS 

Meat Cold water 

Beef. i lb., cut in small pieces. f qt. 

Mutton. i lb., freed from all fat and i qt. 

skin, then cut in small 
pieces. 

Chicken. 2 lbs. i qt. 

Clean, disjoint, remove flesh from bones, cut in 
small pieces. Pound the bones until well broken. 
Put prepared meat in saucepan, add the cold water, bring 
slowly to boiling point. Simmer 4 hours. Strain into jar or 
earthen bowl. When cool put in ice box. When wanted for use 
carefully remove the fat with a spoon. If all cannot be removed 
in this way, pass soft paper lightly over the surface of the broth 
until every particle of fat is absorbed. Add salt, using 4 tsp. to 
every c. broth. Heat carefully, but do not let it boil. Serve in 
heated bowl or cup. To vary the flavor, cook a few pieces of 
celery or of parsley, or i tsp. of any herb, or i tbsp. of any grain, 
or \ tbsp. tapioca with the meat and water. 

Veal and Chicken Jelly 

Fowl, 2 lbs. 

Veal knuckle, i lb. 

Cold water, \\ qts. 

Prepare chicken as for chicken broth. Have the veal knuckle 
well cracked. Put them on together with the cold water. Sim- 
mer until reduced to i\ pts. Strain through cheese cloth, 
season with salt, pour into small molds. When cold remove fat, 
unmold and serve, or reheat at serving time and serve as broth. 

Broth with Egg 

Beat the yolk of i ^^^, or i whole ^g^^, in a bowl. Pour on 
gradually | c. hot broth. Serve at once ; or, after adding ^gg, 
cook over hot water until it thickens slightly. Serve immediately 
or it will curdle. 



Fluid Diet 5 

Oyster or Clam Broth 

Oysters, or clams, f c. 

Milk or water, | c. 

Pass fingers gently over oysters to remove shell. Chop, put 
in saucepan with cold water or milk. Bring slowly to boiling 
point, but do not let it boil. Strain through cheese cloth. Salt 
to taste. 

Clam Broth 

Clams in shell, 6. 

Cold water, \ c. 

Scrub shells thoroughly. Put in saucepan with cold water. 
Cook until the shells open. Strain the liquor through cheese 
cloth folded double. Reheat, taking care not to let it boil. Add 
hot cream, i tbsp. if desired. Pour into heated cup or bowl. Or 
the scalded cream may be omitted and a spoonful of whipped 
cream added after it has been poured into cup. Serve hot. 

BEEF JUICE 

Steak cut from top of round (i lb. should yield 4 ozs.). 

Beef juice press, or fruit press, or vegetable press, or old- 
fashioned lemon squeezer, or large piece of cheese cloth folded 
double and used after the manner of a stoup. (The fruit press 
is especially recommended where beef juice is needed in large 
quantities.) 

Method I : Cut steak in small pieces, discarding all the fat. 
Thoroughly heat the press in hot water, then drain. Put the 
meat in a dry pan. Shake over fire until thoroughly hot but not 
cooked. Put at once into press. Squeeze out all the juice 
possible. More juice will usually be obtained by heating meat 
and press a second time. 

Method II: Heat the press as in Method I. Trim the fat 
from the steak, put on broiler and sear on both sides. Cut in 
small pieces and squeeze as in preceding method. Where much 
beef juice is to be obtained, Method I is preferable. 



6 A Cook Book for Nurses 

Method III : Prepare meat as in Method I. Put in double 
boiler with i tsp. salt. Cover. Have water in lower part of 
boiler at a temperature of 130° F. Put boiler on back of stove, 
and keep it for 2 hours at such heat that the hand can bear to 
rest on the cover at any time during the process. A quantity of 
juice will be obtained by the heat, and more will be extracted by 
pressure. 

BEEF TEA 

Round steak, i lb. 

Cold water, i pt. 

Use a glass jar with close-fitting band and cover. Cut meat 
in small pieces, discarding all the fat. Put in jar with the cold 
water ; cover tightly. Put jar on a trivet in saucepan of water at 
140° F. Keep at that temperature for 2 hours. Pour off the 
liquid. Cool. Remove fat. Season with salt. Heat to 130° F. 
Serve in hot cup.

Fluid Diet 7 

water that has boiled, but is a little below boiling point. Let 
stand 1 5 minutes where it will keep hot but not boil. Strain and 
serve with lump sugar, cream or hot milk. 

Note. — Always use coffee pot of a size proportionate to the amount of coffee 
needed. 



COFFEE II 

Have two small Florence (chemical glass) flasks, a glass funnel 
to fit flasks, and filter paper. Fit filter paper in funnel, put fun- 
nel in one of the flasks. Put 2 tbsps. finely ground coffee in 
the filter, pour over it slowly i c. boiling water. When it has fil- 
tered through, remove funnel to other flask to drip. If coffee is 
wanted stronger, pour through filter into other flask. Serve as in

to prevent formation of skin. Serve at once with or without 
whipped cream. The cocoa may be poured while hot over a well 
beaten ^gg, or over the yolk of an ^gg. 

FRUIT BEVERAGES 

Gejieral Directions: The water used in making fruit beverages 
should be boiled, then cooled. The fruit juices should be strained. 
The beverages should be served ice cold. If purity of ice supply 
is doubted, a good way of serving is to set the glass containing the 
drink in a glass or bowl filled with chopped ice. Syrup is a better 
sweetener than sugar. It may be made in large quantities and 
bottled for use.

CHAPTER VI 

NOTES ON SERVING 

Three points are to be observed in serving a tray : 
First. Cleanliness. 
Second. Convenience. 
Third. Attractiveness. 

Cleanliness. 

{a) Be sure that tray and tray cloth are spotlessly clean ; 
china, glass, and silver bright and shining. 

{b) When a tray is removed from the sick room, destroy all 
foods remaining on it. 

Attractiveness. 

{a) Let size of tray be proportionate to meal to be served. 

Do not use a large tray for a fluid meal. And for a conva- 
lescent's meal use a tray large enough to hold the necessary dishes 
without crowding. 

{b) Do not offer too large portions. Smaller portions are 
more tempting, and also prevent waste. It is better to give a 
second portion than to overload the plate. 

{c) Keep the rims of plates and saucers clean. Take care 
that in serving liquids, the parts of the bowl or glass above the 
level of the liquid are not streaked with it. 

{d) In cutting bread or toast have the pieces uniform in shape 
and size. 

(e) Serve hot dishes hot. Cold dishes cold^ but not chilled. 
Do not serve lukewarm foods. 

(/) If it can be avoided, do not use dishes of different colors. 

(g) In garnishing dishes, let the garnish be simple. 

{h) If flowers are available, one or two laid in the napkin are 
attractive, but do not use too many. 

67 



68 



A Cook Book for Nurses 



lyi) Cover the whole tray with a napkin when carrying it from 
the kitchen to the patient. 

Convenience. 




DIAGRAM OF CONVALESCENT TRAY 

1 . On a breakfast tray, this should be the cereal or fruit dish ; 
on dinner tray the soup bowl or plate ; on supper tray the plate 
containing the principal food of the meal. 

2. Knife, edge of blade towards plate. 

3. Soup spoon, if needed. 

4. Fork, prongs turned up. If more than one fork is needed 
place it here, having the fork to be used first farthest from the 
plate. 

5. Teaspoons. Be sure to have as many as will be needed 
on the tray so as to avoid delay. 

6. Butter chip, unless bread and butter plate is used. 

7. Glass. Fill glasses only three-fourths full. 

8. Salt and pepper. 

9. Sugar bowl. 



Notes on Serving 69 

10. Cream pitcher. 

11. Tea or coffee pot. 

12. Cup and saucer. Take care that handles of teapot, cream 
pitcher, and cup are all turned towards outside of tray. 

13. Plate of bread or toast. If a dinner tray, the plate of 
bread may be put over the soup bowl, and this may be the plate 
holding the main part of the dinner. 

14. Dessert. 

1 5 . Extra vegetables, or salad. 

The napkin may be put on the bread plate, and the bread put 
within a fold of it, or it may be put at the right of the soup spoon.
