LESSON XVI 

Adapting Food to Special Conditions 

infant, old age, and athletic feeding, 

sedentary occupations, climatic 

extremes 

Diet may be divided into three distinct 
classes — normal, preventive, and cura- 
tive. In order to understand the appli- 
cation of diet to these several conditions, 
it is necessary to observe the following 
rules : 

1 Foods must be selected which 

contain all the desired nutri- 
tive elements 

2 They must be so combined as to 

produce chemical harmony, or 
should at least produce no un- 
desirable chemical action. 

1147 



1148 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

3 They must be proportioned so as 
to level or balance their nutri- 
tive elements; that is, to pre- 
vent overfeeding on some ele- 
ments of nourishment, and 
underfeeding on others 

Many fine specimens of men and women 
have been produced without knowledge of 
these laws, but in nearly every case it may 
have been observed that the person was 
normal as to habits, and temperate in 
eating, therefore led aright by instinct. 

If one lives an active life, spending 
from three to five hours a day in the open 
air, the body will cast off and burn with 
oxygen much excess nutrition, and will 
also convert or appropriate certain nutri- 
tive elements to one purpose, which, 
according to all known chemical laws. 
Nature intended for another. Much 
better results, however, will be obtained 
by giving Nature the right material with 
which to work, thus pursuing lines of 
least resistance. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1140 

What foods to select, how they should 
be combined and proportioned, is deter- 
mined mainly by laws dependent upon 
the following conditions : 

1 Age 

2 Temperature of environment — 

time of year or climate 

3 Work or activity 

(1) As to age: 

If we wish the best results we must 
select and proportion our food according 
to age, because the grov/ing child or 
3''0uth needs much structural material — 
calcium phosphates — with which to build 
bone, teeth, and cartilage. This is found 
in cereals and in all starchy foods. The 
middle-aged person needs but httle of 
these — just enough for repair, and the 
aged person needs practically none. 



1150 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

While the growing child needs calcium 
phosphate, he also needs milk and natural 
sweets, which named in the order of their 
preference are honey, maple-sugar, dates, 
figs, and raisins. This does not mean that 
a generous quantity of vegetables and 
fruit cannot be taken, but that the arti- 
cles first mentioned (cereals and starchy 
foods) should form a conspicuous part 
of the child's diet. 

The adult needs a much less quantity 
of the heavier starchy foods, because the 
structural part of the body has been built 
up. The diet of the adult should consist 
of vegetables, nuts, and a normal quan- 
tity of sweets, a normal quantity of fruits, 
milk and eggs, with rather a limited 
amount of cereal or bread products, 
while the aged, or those having passed 
sixty, could subsist wholly upon a non- 
starch diet (non-cereal starch), such as 
vegetables, milk, nuts, eggs, salads, and 
fruits, including bananas, which is 
not a fruit, but a vegetable, and which 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1151 

contains a splendid form of readily 
soluble starch. 

(2) As to time of year: 

In selecting and proportioning our 
food we should observe the laws of 
temperature or time of the year. We 
should not eat foods of a high caloric or 
heating value at a time when the sun is 
giving us this heat direct, thus building a 
fire inside, while the sun is giving us the 
same heat outside. The violation of this 
simple law is the cause of all sunstroke 
and heat prostrations. On the contrary, 
if we are going to be exposed to zero 
weather, we should build a fire inside by 
eating foods of a high caloric value. 

(3) As to work or activity: 

We should select and proportion our 
food according to the work we do, be- 
cause eating is a process of making 



1152 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

energy, while work is a process of expend- 
ing energy, and we should make these 
two accounts balance. 

THE NORMAL DEBT 

While in some respects each body is a 
law unto itself, there are a few funda- 
Efifects of over- mental rules and laws that 
':^ZZ.. apply to all alike. For in- 
and sweets staucc, overcating of starchy 
foods, in every case, will produce too 
much uric acid, and finally rheumatism. 
Also the overeating of sweets and starches 
will cause the stomach to secrete an over- 
supply of hydrochloric acid, the effects 
of which have been discussed in a previous 
lesson. 

In laying out the diet, under all con- 
ditions, the practitioner must be gov- 
Temporary dis- erned by the above-named 
turbances rulcs. Hc should cxercisc 

caused by radi- , . • i , i 

cai changes in his judgment, liowcvcr, m 

<"^* each case according to the 

prevaihng conditions. In prescribing diet 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1153 

it is well to remember that Nature will 
not tolerate, without protest, any radical 
change. It often occurs, therefore, that 
the most correct and thoroughly balanced 
menu will cause violent physical dis- 
turbances which the inexperienced may 
consider as unfavorable symptoms, but 
in a majority of cases this is merely the 
adjusting process, similar to that which 
occurs when the body is suddenly de- 
prived of narcotics and stimulants after 
their habitual use. 

The practitioner should exercise much 
care in diagnosis. He should study all 
symptoms and lay out the diet so as to 
counteract prevailing conditions, and to 
produce normality. 

The tendency of the body, that has 
been incorrectly fed for many years, to 

The stomach protcst agaiust the right kind 

w^t°h'naturT ^^^ ^^^ ^^S^^ combinatious 
food of food, is often very decep- 

tive. It is not always correct to say that 
the food did not agree with the stomach. 



1154 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

but more correct to say that the different 
foods did not agree with themselves. 
The patient should be thoroughly ac- 
quainted with these facts, and mentally 
prepared for some temporary discomforts 
or physical protest against the new system. 



INFANT FEEDING 

The tremendous mortahty among in- 
fants and children is due to incorrect 
Large percent- feeding morc than to all 
age of infant other causcs. In the process 

mortality due „ , . • i tp 

to incorrect oi reproducmg animal lite, 
feeding nearly all abnormal condi- 

tions are eliminated. The best that is in 
the mother is given to the child. The 
trend of Nature is upward toward higher 
intelligence and more perfect physical 
development. For this reason infants 
are usually healthier than their parents, 
though millions of babies are rapidly 
broken in health by improper feeding. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1155 

The economy of Nature is perfect, 
therefore all natural forces conspire to 
preserve the life of the young. This is 
the natural law governing the preserva- 
tion and the development of human life, 
and that this condition does not obtain 
is the most striking evidence of our lack 
of knowledge in feeding the young. 

Infant feeding must be considered 
from two points of view: (1) Dealing 

Point of view witli the child or infant as we 

IrerioTn^ant' ^^d it, whcrc the mothcr has 

feeding so violated Nature's laws of 

nutrition and hygiene as to afford no 
breast-milk for her child; (2) where this 
condition does not prevail, and the child 
receives ample nourishment from the 
breast of the mother. 

We will first consider the diet and the 
conduct of the mother during pregnancy 
and prior to it. 

Preparation for motherhood is one of 
woman's most sacred duties, because it 
involves not only the happiness and 



1156 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

health of herself, but it shapes, in a large 
degree, the mental and the physical 
conditions of another being which will 
wield an influence over its whole life. 

The common error of most women is 
that they do not desire children when 
they are first married, and 
loL^^d ill the pursuit of other pleas- 
ures they violate and dis- 
regard the laws of Nature; the baby is a 
mere accident — probably unwelcome. 
During the entire embryonic period the 
same old habits and diet are indulged in; 
the mental and the physical condition 
of the being-to-be has received no con- 
sideration, and, unwelcome in a strange 
world, the little eyes are opened. Then 
the instinctive love of the mother is 
kindled and lavished; the child's every 
want is law; it needs maternal nourish- 
ment and the mother desires to give 
it, but the natural fountain is insuffi- 
cient, and probably dry. The mother's 
thoughts and inspirations can no longer 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DI?:T 1157 

become a part of the child, except 
through education in hiter years — they 
are two separate beings; the opportunity 
to endow it with a part of her Hfe is 
forever gone. 

Under the most favorable conditions 

we meet a constant resistance to life. 

Resistance to and the higher we ascend 

infant life [^ the scalc of civilization 

should be re- , , , . 

moved as much the greater IS the resistance 
as possible encountcrcd. It is therefore 
the duty of the mother, as also of the 
father, to remove every obstacle that 
would offer resistance to the physical and 
mental growth of the child. In order 
to do this it is necessary to carry out 
certain well-established laws concerning 
diet, exercise, fresh air, sunshine, and 
mental training. 

GENERAL RULES FOR THE PROSPECTIVE 
MOTHER 

From the time conception is recognized 
the following general rules should be 
observed : 



1158 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

1 The corset or all tight-fitting 

garments that would in any 
way interfere with freedom of 
exercise and thorough devel- 
opment of the abdominal mus- 
cles should be discarded. 

2 As much time as possible — at 

least two hours each day — 
should be spent in the open 
air, and a system of moderate 
trunk exercises followed, to- 
gether with deep breathing, 
calculated to expand the lungs 
to their fullest cell capacity, 
which is Nature's method of 
burning or oxidizing waste 
matter, and thereby keeping 
the blood pure. 

3 The mental occupation should 

be an important factor in the 
daily regimen. Some con- 
genial study should be chosen 
with the view of making it use- 
ful, while some remunerative 
employment should be sought 
and indulged in for a portion 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OV DIET 11.39 

of each day. Avoid idleness 
by all means, or an idle roam- 
ing of the mind and spirit. 
Learn to think, to concentrate, 
to work, and to do something 
for others, as it is from these 
things that all happiness is 
gained. 

The diet of the future mother 
should be governed somewhat 
by the laws laid out in the first 
part of this lesson; that is, 
age, temperature of environ- 
ment, and occupation should 
be considered in its selection. 



SPECIAL RULES FOR THE PROSPECTIVE 
MOTHER 

There are some specific rules in regard 
to diet, however, which every mother 
should observe. The diet 
foM?e*diet^ should be balanced so as to 
contain all the needed ele- 
ments of nourishment in approximately 



1160 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

the right proportions. The proportions, 
however, should differ in many cases 
from that which she would take if she 
were in a normal state, especially in 
regard to starchy foods or calcareous 
matter. An abundance of green salads, 
sweet ripe fruits, fresh vegetables in 
season, eggs, milk, nuts, and not more 
than two ounces of bread, potatoes, or 
dried beans should be taken daily. If 
flesh food or something salty is craved, 
tender chicken, or fish, may be allowed in 
small quantities. 

It should be borne in mind that I do 
not advocate the use of flesh foods, but 

Abnormal ap- ^."^^^^^ prcgnancy the appe- 
petite during titc is Varying and sometimes 
pregnancy tyrannical, and it has been 
found better to compromise with this 
condition than to combat it. The use of 
a limited quantity of tender meat, or any 
other article of good food for which there 
should arise a craving, is therefore 
advisable. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1161 

In the selection of meats, the flesh of 

young animals is best, for the reason that 

_ ^ , it contains more albumin and 

Flesh of 

young animals less pi'otcids than that of 

pre erre oldcF auimals, and because 

young animals are more healthy and less 

hable to contamination by dis-ease. 

The white meat of fowl or fish is 

preferable to the red or "dark" meat, for 

the reason that nearly all the impurities 

in the animal body are conveyed through 

the blood, therefore the bloodless flesh 

is safest for the woman who must delegate 

a part of her food to the support of her 

child. 

Not more than five per cent of the total 

amount of food taken should consist of 

Reasons for wliitc bread, oatmeal, rice, 

avoiding dried beans, or corn pro- 

starchy foods 1 . P .1 ti ^ 

during preg- Qucts, lor the Tcason that 

"""•^y these are the foods that con- 

tain an excess of starch or calcareous 
matter, and it is due to overconsumptfon 
of starchy foods that the bony structure 



1162 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

of the child is often over-developed, mak- 
ing birth so difficult, and sometimes fatal. 
All stimulants, narcotics, and drugs 
should be entirely omitted. 

THE NURSING MOTHER 

If the mother supplies enough milk, 

this is infinitely superior to any artificial 

combination of so-called in- 

Breast milk 

vs. artificial faut foods. Uufortunatcly a 
foods large majority of children 

are not breast-fed, and must depend upon 
the various commercial infant-foods, or 
upon the judgment of the untrained nurse, 
or the mother. 

The majority of mothers, if so disposed, 

could, by studying their own diet, supply 

The lives of the most robust child with 

depindupo^theample breast-nourishment 

mother's diet until it is tCU Or twclvC 

months old, after which period the in- 
fantile crisis would be passed, and mil- 
lions of httle lives would thereby be 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 11G3 

saved. However, the confinement and 
the trouble to which the mother is sub- 
jected by the nursing baby causes the 
majority of infants to be weaned within 
a few weeks after birth, and turned over 
to the hazard of prepared food, soporific 
drugs, and nurses. 

If mothers could realize the love that 

is daily kindled and strengthened; if 

they could be made to know 

Child-love «^ 

stimulated by how mucli morc their chil- 
nursing drcH would lovc tlicm, and 

they would love their children; if they 
could look into the years and see how the 
link of love between them and their 
children had been shaped, molded, and 
fashioned by the simple act of nurturing 
them from the breast (to say nothing of 
the lives that would be saved), the arti- 
ficially-fed baby would be a rarity, and 
the mother w^ould be queen in the hearts 
of the nation's children. 

The most beautiful thing that ever 
graced the canvas of art, or shed its love 



1164 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

into the cold realism of nature, is a 
nursing baby pushing from its satisfied 
lips the mother's breast, and smiling its 
sweet content into her face. 

It is almost criminal to withdraw the 
breast from an infant, and to turn it over 
to the treachery of prepared foods, when, 
by devoting a little time each day to the 
study of the science of eating, it is possible 
for the mother to supply the child with 
her own milk. 

CARE OF THE CHILD 

The following are general rules for 
feeding the infant from birth to about 
one year of age. 

These rules cannot be made inflexible 
because all children differ in tempera- 
ment, vitality, and as to prenatal in- 
fluences, but if the mother will observe 
these instructions with reasonable care, 
her child can be brought healthfully 
through the most critical period of its 



ENXYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 11G5 

life, and will enter the solid food age with 
good digestion, a strong body, and an 
excellent chance to withstand all chil- 
dren's dis-eases. 

Where artificial feeding becomes neces- 
sary, then the preparation of the baby- 
food is of primary importance. Cow's 
milk is, of course, the logical food, but 
taken whole, that is, the entire milk, it 
is too high in proteids, and deficient in 
sugar; therefore, in order to make a 
healthful infant-food, it must be modified 
according to the requirements of the 
infant body. 

The nurse or the mother should pre- 
pare a quantity sufficient for only one 
day's supply at a time, after the following 
formula : 

Cream 2 ounces 

Milk 2 ounces 

Water 15 ounces 

Milk-sugar 4 level teaspoonfuls 

Lime-water 2 teaspoonfuls or | ounce 

This should be thoroughly mixed, 
placed in the bottle, and set in warm 



1166 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

water until it is brought to the tempera- 
ture of breast-milk. The above formula 
may be used during the first month of the 
baby's life. 

The quantity and the frequency of 
feedings should be according to the 
following table: 

AGE FEEDINGS OUNCES INTERVALS OF 

Ist day 5 to 6 1 3 or 4 hours 

2d day 7 to 8 1 2J to 3 hours 

3d to 7th day 9 to 10 U 2 to 2^ hours 

2d, 3d, and 4th weeks 10 2 to 3 2 hours 

Formula for the second and the third 
months : 

Cream 3| ounces 

Milk 1 J ounces

Milk-sugar 5 teaspoonfuls 

Lime-water 21 teaspoonfuls 

Quantity and frequency of feeding 
should be about as follows:

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 11G7 

Fornuila for period from the fourth to 
the twelfth month: 

Cream 6 to 8 ounces 

Milk 2 to 3 ounces 

Water 10 Suncea 

Milk-sugar 5 to 6 teaspoonfuls 

Lime-water 2 to 3 teaspoonfuls 

Quantity and frequency of feedings 
should be about as follows:

The above formulas for infant-food 
are the best that can be made from 
ordinary cow's milk. 

The milk-sugar and the lime-water 
herein named can be purchased at any 
first-class drug store. 

These tables are not given as exact. 
The mother should exercise careful 



1168 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

vigilance and judgment, especially in 

reference to the quantity of each feeding, 

. .^ , and the frequency. The 

Avoid too ^ ^ " 

frequent momcnt the child shows 

ee ing symptoms of overfeeding, 

which symptoms are usually evidenced 
by vomiting or discomfort, the quantity 
of cream and the amount at each feeding 
should be reduced. In fact, it is health- 
ful, and often necessary for the child to 
allow it the opportunity to get hungry. 
The digestion of many a baby is totally 
ruined by continuous feeding, which is 
done out of motherly sympathy, or 
merely to keep it quiet. 

The mother or the nurse should exer- 
cise great care in the cleanliness and the 

Importance of liygicnic preparation of cliil- 

cieanliness in i 'p j "^r*ii i iii 

„,^^<.. „„ dren s loods. Mnk should be 

preparing 

child's food fresh, and of the verv best. 
It should not be left uncovered or ex- 
posed. It should be kept continually on 
ice until ready for use. The cream should 
be taken from the top of the bottle, or 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1169 

from fresh milk. This insures better 
quahty of butter-fat than is generally 
supplied in ordinary commercial daily 
cream. 

As the child advances in age, whole 
milk, cereal gruel, and egg mixture (two 
whites to one yolk) may be administered 
according to the child's normal appetite 
and digestion. The egg may be prepared 
by whipping the whites and the yolks 
separately, adding to the yolk a teaspoon- 
ful of cream and one of sugar, then 
Vv'hipping the beaten whites into this, and 
serving. 

CONSTIPATION 

The stools of natural, healthy children 
should be bright yellow and perfectly 
smooth. If grainy and soft, food should 
be made richer. If in curds, it evidences 
too much protein, therefore the milk 
should be reduced. If the stools are white 
and oily, it indicates an excess of cream. 



1170 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

If hard and dry, it indicates an insuflBcient 
amount of cream. If green, reduce the 
quantity of milk, or omit it altogether, 
and increase the quantity of barley-water. 

The majority of bottle-fed children 
suffer greatly from constipation, caused 
largely by the milk, or the failure to 
modify the milk properly, or to make it 
contain the constituent elements of 
breast-milk. This condition can be re- 
lieved by giving the child sweet orange 
juice every night and morning, or the 
juice from soaked prunes, if preferred. 
This should be administered in quantities 
ranging from a dozen drops to two or 
three teaspoonfuls, according to the age 
of the child and the severity of the condi- 
tion. Intestinal congestion can often be 
relieved, however, by giving the abdomen 
gentle massage, preferably with a rotary 
or kneading motion. 

In cases of diarrhea, infants from three 
to eight months old should be given Urst 
an enema, and then a diet entirely of 



ENXYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1171 

boiled milk mixed with rice or barley- 
water. 

EXERCISE 

All infants need some exercise. They 
should be gently rubbed and rolled about 
after the morning bath, before they are 
dressed. There is nothing more healthful 
than exposure of the baby-skin to fresh 
air in a normal temperature. 

CLOTHING 

Next in importance to the food of the 
infant is its clothing. The usual style of 
dressing babies the first three months of 
their lives is positively barbaric; not that 
it imitates uncivilized people, but be- 
cause it evidences the grossest ignorance 
and crudest vanity. The mother seems 
to have no way of expressing her pride in 
her child except by bedecking it with 
elaborate garments. These usually con- 
sist of three long skirts, two of them 



1172 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

attached to bands which are fastened 
around the body. The weight of this 
clothing prevents the free use of the 
baby's feet and legs, putting it into a 
kind of civilized strait-jacket, thus pre- 
venting it from exercising the only part 
of its anatomy that it can freely move. 

It is nothing uncommon to see a beau- 
tiful baby sore, irritated, and broken 
out with heat all over its little body by 
being heavily enveloped in barbaric rags. 
The child, therefore, is made to suffer 
merely that it may please a proud 
mother, and conform to an ignorant 
custom a thousand years old. 

The only purpose clothing should serve 
is that of bodily warmth. When it is 
made the instrument of painful adorn- 
ment it is serving the same purpose as 
"rings in the ears and bells on the toes," 
and the mind of the mother who thus 
afflicts her child is in the same class as 
that of the ignorant barbarian whom she 
imitates.

It should be remembered that all 
liquid food for a child up to twelve or 
fifteen months old sliould be administered 
at a temperature no lower than blood- 
heat. The liquid mixtures named herein 
may be made in advance of the needs, 
and placed upon ice merely to preserve 
them, but should be warmed to a temper- 
ature of at least ninety-nine degrees 
Fahrenheit before administering to the 
child. 

Pure water should be given to all 
children from the time they are two 
weeks old. 

BANDAGE 

The bandage should be removed about 
the close of the third month. 

EMACIATION 

In case of slight emaciation or lack of 
fat, the child should be given an olive-oil 



1174 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

rub once or twice a week, rubbing gently 
into the skin about one teaspoonful of 
oil. 

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHILDREN 
AFTER ONE YEAR 

All children, whether breast-fed or 
bottle-fed, are subject to practically the 
same health rules after they are about 
one year old. Therefore I will now con- 
sider all children in the same class, and 
lay out for them what may be termed 
general instructions in health and hygiene. 

Care should be exercised to omit from 
the diet of children just beginning to take 
solid food, all articles that will not dis- 
solve readily without mastication. 



GENERAL DIET FROM AGES 
ONE TO TWO 

The diet from the first to the second 
year should consist of: 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1175 

Baked apples 

Baked potatoes — sweet or white 

Cereal — limited quantity (thoroughly cooked) 

Cream soups — home-made, such as: 

Cream of celery Onion 

Potato Rice 

Tomato, etc. 
Eggs 
Milk 

Pulp of soft ripe fruits 
Vegetables — thoroughly mashed, such as: 



Fresh 



Asparagus 
Corn 
Peas 
Squash 



The above vegetables contain much 
cellulose or pulp which should be entirely 
discarded, leaving only the meat or 
puree; but to the child from eleven to 
fifteen months old, they should be ad- 
ministered in very limited quantities. 

SIMPLICITY IN FEEDING 

Especial attention should be given to 
simplicity in feeding: 



1176 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

1 Avoid giving too many things at 

the same meal ; from three to 
four articles at one time are 
sufficient 

2 Mothers should be especially 

cautioned against giving a 
child bread made with yeast, 
or baking powder, and against 
the old diet of milk toast 

3 All meat, flesh food, stimulants 

or narcotics of every kind 
should be omitted from the 
diet of children 

4 The crowning mistake of the dot- 

ing mother is often made in 
feeding her child from the 
conventional table, on such 
things as weakened coffee or 
tea, meats, and condiments 

5 The custom of giving children 

an excess of sweets has ruined 
millions of little stomachs, and 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1177 

has ^ivcn tlicni a licritage of 
dis-ease and suffering before 
they have entered their 'teens 

6 All condiments, such as pepper, 

salt, vinegar, pickles, and all 
pungent things should be elim- 
inated from the diet of chil- 
dren — the taste of the child 
is very susceptible to cultiva- 
tion, and with very little en- 
couragement it will accept 
things that have no place in 
the human economy, and 
which are positively harmful 

7 When a child begins teething, it 

may be given a small piece of 
hard water-cracker with safety 

If the above rules are observed, it is 
reasonable to assume that normal hunger 
of the child will guide it very correctly 
in selecting, proportioning, and combin- 
ing its food through the period of child- 
hood until it enters the period of youth. 



1178 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 
OLD AGE 

There seems to be two critical periods 
in every life — the ages of thirty and 
sixty. If the sixtieth year 
"rre^L" can be turned with good 
digestion, normal assimila- 
tion and excretion, it is fair to assume 
that with reasonable care the century 
mark may be easily reached. It is also 
reasonable to assume that experience 
will have taught most thoughtful people 
what to eat and what not to eat, but the 
mortality tables of nearly all civilized 
countries, of which the writer has made 
a careful study, prove that a majority 
of people do not reach their sixtieth year, 
and but a very small per cent of those 
who do are blessed with good digestion. 
Therefore an old age diet is quite as 
important to the student as infant feed- 
ing. 

For purposes of convenience, I will put 
all cereal products, legumes, and white 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1171) 

potatoes in tlie starch or bread class, 
and henceforth they will be referred to 
as such. 

The majority of disorders that mark 

the difference between youth and age 

Meat and ^^^^ ^^ traccd directly to 

bread produce tllC OVCr-COnSUmption of 

*^® meat and bread, especially 

cereal starch. The hardening of the 
arteries, the stiffening of the cartilage, 
the enlargement of the joints, and the 
general lack of flexibility throughout the 
body is due almost wholly to the over- 
consumption of these two staples. 

Uric acid is always present in gouty and 

rheumatic conditions, but it is there as 

„ . ... Nature's defense against our 

Unc acid in ° 

rheumatic con- sius, and not as a primary 
cause. Meat is not the cause 
of uric acid as has been popularly taught. 
Uric acid is one of the constituent ele- 
ments of all animal bodies, and when the 
normal supply in the human body is 
supplemented by that which is contained 



1180 E^XYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

in the body of the animal upon which we 
prey, we are oversuppHed. This is as 
far as meat-eating contributes toward 
uric acid poisoning. 

When the body is young and growing, 

it can consume and appropriate a con- 

siderable quantity of starchy 

starches or structural material, but 

desirable whcu it is fully growu, or has 

turned forty, it can subsist healthfully 
upon a diet containing only from three 
to five per cent of starch, and as one 
becomes older the more soluble forms of 
starch should be taken, such as the 
starch contained in green peas, beans, 
and corn, which, immature, is readily 
soluble and assimilable. The starch in 
the banana is also easily appropriated and 
will not leave calcareous deposits in the 
arteries and in the joints, as does the 
mature starch contained in the cereals. 

After the fiftieth year the diet becomes 
more and more a factor needing special 
attention in the daily regimen, both as to 



ENXYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1181 

selection and quantity ; and with advanc- 
ing age the quantity of food should be 
gradually reduced until the minimum 
which will support life healthfully is 
reached. 

In old age the diet should be governed 
by the same general rules as those of 

Importance of y^^UgCr pCOplc; that is, cl- 

diet with ad- dcrly pcoplc should select, 

vancing age i • i , • 

combme, and proportion 
their food according to temperature of 
environment, labor, and age. Those 
performing manual labor can use and 
eliminate food material which would 
produce uric acid and other poisons in 
the body of the sedentary worker. 

THREE PERIODS OF OLD AGE 

Old age may be divided into three 

periods. From fifty to sixty the diet 

should consist of a very 

mt^ tl°^ty limited quantity of bread 

products (not more than two 

per cent); fresh green vegetables, fresh 



1182 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

mild fruits, nuts, a normal quantity of 
milk and eggs, a limited quantity of 
sugar, and a moderate amount of fats. 

From sixty to seventy the amount of 

cereal starch should be reduced to one 

per cent, or not more than 

Diet from ^ ' 

sixty to two per cent, while the other 

seventy articles named may be taken 

as suggested from fifty to sixty, gradually 
ehminating starchy foods, and increasing 
foods containing proteids, casein, and 
albumin. 

Between the ages of seventy and one 

hundred, the same general suggestions 

^. ^ . as those above laid out 

Diet from 

seventy to one sliould be followcd, climiuat- 
"° ^^ ing entirely all cereal pro- 

ducts. The more soluble forms of starchy 
or carbohydrate foods, such as potatoes, 
bananas, and green peas, beans, corn, etc., 
may be taken. (See Lesson XIII, A'ol. 
Ill, p. 632.) 

The necessary amount of fats, albumin, 
casein, and proteids must be governed 



ENCYCLOrEDIA OF DIET 1183 

by activity and temperature of environ- 
ment. 

The following are suggestions for one 
day's menu, in spring and summer, age 
between fifty and sixty. Choice of 
menus may be exercised, but each menu 
should be taken in its entirety.

EN'CYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1185 

In cases of constipation, two or three 
tablespoonfiils of coarse wheat bran 
(cooked, if desired) should be taken with 
the breakfast and the evening meal, and 
a spoonful just before retiring, taken in a 
glass of water. Such fruits as plums, 
peaches, or berries should be taken daily, 
just after rising and just before retiring. 

The following are suggestions for fall 
and winter menus, for a person between 
the ages of fifty and sixty: 



1186 ENCYCLOPEDL\ OF DIET 



BREAKFAST 



Oranges, apples, pears, or soaked pnines 
An egg and a small portion of either plain boiled 
wheat or rice 

A very ripe banana, with nuts and raisins 

Note: Sweet fruits may be taken in- 
stead of the acid fruits suggested, and 
milk instead of eggs. 



LUNCHEON 

One or two fresh vegetables, such as carrots, 
onions, turnips, cabbage, or beans 
Celery or any coarse plant 
A potato or a very small portion of corn 



If not very active, the luncheon may 
consist of two glasses of buttermilk and 
a spoonful of wheat bran. 



Choice of two fresh vegetables 
A baked potato 

Choice of fish, eggs, or buttermilk 
Corn bread or a very small portion of coarse 
cereal 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1187 

All fresh, watery vegetables should be 
cooked in a casserole dish. 

A sufficient quantity of water should 
be drunk at each of these meals to bring 
the moisture up to about sixty-six per 
cent of the meal — two to three glasses. 

These meals are mere suggestions, 
and are therefore subject to many varia- 
tions. 

All green salads may be substituted 
for one another; all starchy products — 
grain, potatoes, and legumes — may also 
be substituted for one another.

ATHLETICS 

The diet for the athlete really differs 
but little from that which should be 

Every diet ^^^^^ ^^ *^^'^^ perSOU 111 

should be an normal health, the object in 

athletic diet ii r • _ a. ii 

all cases being to secure the 
greatest degree of energy from the least 
quantity of food. In order to do this, 
the laws governing the selecting, the 
combining, and the proportioning of 
foods should be observed. ^Mien the 
digestive, the assimilative, and the ex- 
cretory organs are properly performing 
their functions, the object should be to 
gain the highest efficiency in food with 
the least amount of loss or waste. Every 
diet, therefore, should be made an ath- 
letic diet. 

In dealing with the pubhc at large, 
the work of the practitioner will be 
confined very largely to prescribing for 
those who, by violation of Nature's laws, 
have become dis-eased, or in some way 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1189 

physically abnormal, and in these cases, 
of course, a remedial or counteractive 
diet first becomes necessary. 

In dealing with the athlete as a special 

class, liowever, we must consider him as 

, ^. , a normal creature, somewhere 

General diet 

for normal bctwccn the agcs of twcnty 
"'^"*' and forty. We must also 

consider that his digestion and assimila- 
tion of food, and elimination of waste are 
normal. Under these conditions, the diet 
should consist of highly nitrogenous and 
proteid compounds, leveled or balanced 
by the requisite amount of carbohydrates 
and fats. 

If the athlete is training for action in 
summer, the quantity of fat should be 
Quantity of rcduced according to tem- 
dmerlf '"^ '' perature or climate. When 
seasons the thermometer ranges in 

the seventies and eighties, one ounce of 
fat each twenty-four hours would prob- 
ably be sufficient, while if the mercury is 
down in the twenties or thirties, from 



1190 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

two or three ounces may be required to 
keep up bodily heat. 

The following are suggestions for sum- 
mer athletic diet:

These menus, Hke those given for 
summer, are merely for the purpose of 
suggesting selections, combinations, and 
proportions of food that will meet the 
exigencies of temperature, environment, 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1193 

and work. The quantity of food re- 
quired will depend largely upon the size 
(physique) of the individual, tlie severity 
of training, and the feats to be performed. 
It is especially important that these 
suggestions be well considered at least 
one day before engaging in any athletic 
event or work requiring extraordinary 
physical effort, as the human body appro- 
priates or uses food from twenty-four to 
thirty-six hours after it is eaten. 

If one is to be exposed to extreme cold, 
an excess of fats should be taken, begin- 

_ , ning thirtv-six hours before 

Exposure to ^ " 

extreme cold cxposurc. If much physical 
or exer on effort is to be cxcrtcd, the 
diet should be balanced as to all nutritive 
elements, with an excess of nitrogenous 
foods. In fact, these rules should be 
observed by every one who desires to 
make feeding scientific, and to make 
food his servant instead of his master, 
as our civilized habits have a tendency 
to do. 



1101 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

SEDENTARY OCCUPATIONS 

Nature demands from ever^'' form of 
life a certain amount of activity or mo- 
tion. Any transf'ression of 

Cessation of _ *' " ^ ^ 

activity means this law mcans disintcgra- 
isintegration ^-^j^ Rest is merely the 

process adopted by Nature to reconvert 
matter into its original elements. To 
whatever extent one ceases activity, Na- 
ture, under normal conditions, inflicts 
this penalty. 

Man's civilized habits and customs 
have produced a class of workers who, 

while at work, are deprived 
dvmzati^n*^ '^ of their requisite amount of 

motion, and who, therefore, 
pay the penalty by shortened periods of 
life, and by numerous disorders which 
we have come to characterize as dis-ease. 
There is but one method known to science 
by which these penalties may be avoided, 
and by which the worker whose occupa- 
tion must be sedentary may become as 



EXCVCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1195 

healthful as his brother who can order 
his life in conformity with Nature's laws. 
That method lies in the ordering of his 
diet. 

All dis-ease may be called congestion ^ 

or the failure of the body to eliminate 

... poisons and waste matter. 

Dis-ease is '■ 

merely con- Tlic proccss of elimination 
gestion -^ assisted by activity (work 

or play). The accumulation of waste 
and poisons in the body is measured 
or determined almost wholly by the 
diet. 

The man who is swinging a pick or a 

sledge hammer in the open air may eat 

or drink almost anything. 

Diet governed i ■% • t ^' • 

by work bccausc his powcrs of ehmm- 

ating waste are aided by his 
work. It follows, therefore, that those 
whose work is of a sedentary nature must 
procure their nutrition from substances 
containing the minimum of waste, and 
producing the maximum of energy, and 
the quantity must be measured accurately 



IVJQ ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

by the demands of the body, or auto- 
intoxication (self-poisoning) will result. 

Intestinal congestion (constipation), 
which is almost universal among seden- 
tary workers, is caused in nearly all cases 
by consuming a cjuantity of food in ex- 
cess of the physical demands, and which 
cannot be thrown off owing to the lack 
of exercise. It is at this point that science 
must lay out the dietetic regimen so as 
to make it conform to the occupation, 
or to the lack of physical activity. 

The following are suggestions for a 
spring or summer diet for the average 
sedentary worker; 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1197 



BREAKFAST 

Cantuloup, berried or peaches, with sugar

Peas, beans, or asparagus 
A heaping tablespoonful of nuts 
A salad of lettuce and tomatoes, with nuts 
A baked potato, tender corn, or a very little 
coarse bread

1198 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR SEDENTARY 
WORKER 

The student will recognize that in 
these menus the heavier foods are pre- 
scribed sparingly, while the lighter or 
the more readily soluble articles pre- 
dominate. From these suggestions a 
fair idea of a fall and winter diet can be 
drawn. 

Indigestion, sour stomach (hyper- 
chlorhydria), constipation, malassimila- 
tion, and general anemia are the dis- 
orders with which the sedentary worker 
is most commonly afflicted. 

In dealing with each and all of these 
conditions, including obesity, which is 
often the result of sedentary habits, the 
first thing to be done is to limit the 
quantity of food to the normal require- 
ments of the body, and in extreme cases 
a diet below the normal should be ob- 
served; no one was ever made ill by 
underfeeding. Then, with proper care 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET lino 

as to the selection, combination, and 
proportions of food, and an increased 
amount of exercise and deep breathing, 
the person of sedentary habits should 
be made as healthy and strong as the 
outdoor worker in the fields of manual 
labor. 

CLIMATIC EXTREMES 

In considering a diet to meet the re- 
quirements of climatic extremes, either 
hot or cold, it is necessary to reckon from 
normality, both as to climate and as to 
the health of the individual. 

All the foregoing lessons, taken as a 
whole, are designed to teach one method 
or theory, involving two principles: 

1 Selections, combinations, and 
proportions of food that will 
counteract and remove the 
causes of unnatural condi- 
tions called dis-ease 



1200 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

2 Selections, combinations, and 
proportions of food that will 
bring the body up to its high- 
est degree of development and 
t'here maintain it 

Under normal conditions the tempera- 
ture of the body may be thoroughly con- 
trolled by feeding. The principal process 
of metabolism is that of making heat out 
of the fuel given to the "human boiler." 
The amount of heat, therefore, that a 
given quantity of food will produce is 
determined very largely by the amount 
of resistance that is met from natural 
environment. 

The human body, under ordinary'- con- 
ditions, in a temperature of 60° Fahren- 

Amount of fat hcit, will USC about twO 

renuired ia p p , 

different tem- OUUCCS of purC fat CVCry 

peratures twcnty-four liours. If the 
temperature should drop to 30° Fahren- 
heit, it would require about three ounces 
of fat every twenty-four liours to keep 
the temperature of the body at normal. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1201 

Under certain conditions of exposure it 
might require as much as five and even 
six ounces of pure fat to maintain normal 
temperature of the body, and in the 
extreme north, where the temperature 
ranges in winter from 25° to 30° below 
zero, the natives often take as much as 
sixteen ounces of fat during the day. 
Fat being the principal heat-producing 
element, it is, therefore, the most neces- 
sary thing to consider in a temperature 
of extreme cold. 

The student will readily understand 
that, in order to maintain a normal 
standard of vitality and endurance, 
the selection of foods must be made 
according to age, activity, and tem- 
perature. 

For a person undergoing a reasonable 
amount of exposure, and working in a 
climate where the temperature is ranging 
between 20° and 30° Fahrenheit, the 
following menus, covering one day, may 
be suggested: 



1202 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Immediately on rising, drink a cup of 
hot water, then take vigorous deep 
breathing exercises, followed by a cool 
sponge bath and rub down. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1203 

BREAKFAST 

(An hour later) 

Add half an ounce of eupar to two or throe epfis, 
and whip five minutes; add a tablespoonful of 
lemon juice while whipping; mix with this two 
glasses of rich milk 

A tablespoonful of nuts 

One very ripe banana, with cream 

LUNCHEON 

One fresh vegetable 
Lima or navy beans 
A salad, with either olive-oil or nuts 
A baked potato or boiled wheat (A liberal 
supply of butter or cream) 



A baked sweet potato 

One or two vegetables 

Eggs, or buttermilk, unskimmed 

A baked white potato, with either olive-oil or 
butter 

Dates, with cream cheese, or gelatin, with 
cream 



As the temperature becomes lower, the 
amount of fats and proteids should be 



1204 ENCYCLOPEDL\ OF DIET 

increased according to exposure and 
activity. 

The student should bear in mind that 
carbohydrates, proteids, and fats are 
the most important factors in the winter 
dietary. Other articles can be held level 
over a wide range of temperature, pro- 
vided these three staple nutrients are 
taken in the requisite proportions. 

Nearly all people in normal health 
instinctively avoid heat-producing foods 
Summer diet in hot wcatlicr, and as in 
tifirc'onsfder-' ^'^rm or hot climates people 
ation live morc in the open air, 

oxidation is therefore more perfect, and 
has a tendency to aid elimination, so the 
errors of diet are not so serious. Never- 
theless, the food to be taken in hot cli- 
mates, or the heated term of summer, 
should receive scientific consideration. 

Anthropoid life, of which man is the 
highest type, originated in the tropics, 
and nearly everything necessary for his 
highest physical development grew prodi- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1205 

gaily in that country. His natural or 
primitive diet was nuts, fruits, and salads 
(edible plants). 

Civilization has transplanted him in 
the north, and has laid heavier burdens 
upon him, therefore he needs, in many 
instances, heavier and different foods, 
such as the carbohydrates, proteids, fats, 
and the albumin and the phosphorus in 
eggs. 

As the temperature becomes warmer, 
the heat-producing factors, such as fats 
and carbohydrates (starch and sugar), 
should be gradually reduced. 

The following menus are suitable for 
the average person, in normal health, 
between the ages of thirty and sixty, 
when the temperature is ranging from 
70° to 90° Fahrenheit: 



1206 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 



BREAKFAST 

Cantaloup, peaches, or berries 

Very ripe bananas, with grated nuts and cream 

A glass of milk 

LUNCHEON

A lettuce and tomato salad 

A baked sweet or white potato 



Peas, beans, asparagus, or corn 

A salad, with grated nuts and carrots 

A potato 

One whipped egg 

Half a glass of milk 

A service of gelatin 

These menus are mere suggestions, not 
invariable, and in following them it 
should be remembered that all green 
salads may be substituted for one an- 
other, and as a general rule such under- 
ground articles as beets, carrots, turnips, 
and parsnips may be substituted for one 



FATYC LOPEDIA OF DIET 1207 

anotlier. Also green corn, peas, and beans 
are in the same general class. (See 
"Constipation," Vol. Ill, p. 761.) 

Observation of these rules will give the 
student rather a wide range of articles 
to draw upon in selecting a diet for the 
normal person.

LESSON XVII 

Nervousness 
Its Cause and Cure 

The nerves of the human body are the 
most important, the most complex, and 
probably the least understood of any part 
of the human anatomy. In conditions of 
health they are never heard from, there- 
fore every expression of the nervous 
system is a symptom of some abnormal 
physical condition. 

The usual term "nervousness" conveys 

to the mind of the average person such 

conditions as sleeplessness,

tion of accident, tragedy, death, insanity, 
and a multitude of things that never 
happen. Language cannot adequately 
describe or convey to the mind of another 
person the strange impressions that 
sweep o'er the mind — the mental anguish 
caused by an ordinary case of nervous 
indigestion. Those only who can under- 
stand why many good men and women 
sometimes take their own lives, or commit 
some great crime, are those who have 
experienced the same affliction. 

If we could correctly interpret the 
various symptoms given to the brain from 
the nervous system, and would heed 
these symptoms, the body might be kept 
in almost perfect health under all condi- 
tions of civilized life. 

The lack of fresh air and exercise is al- 
ways told by nervous expres- 

nutrition to sion, but the mOSt import- 
nervousness ^^^ ^^^ significant message 

conveyed by the nerves at the brain is 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1213 

that concerning food and general nutri- 
tion. Instinct often leads us to fresh air 
and exercise, but with our food it is 
vastly different. We acquire a taste for 
certain things; the habit grows upon us, 
and though the nerves tell the story to 
our senses over and over, we heed it not 
because we are held behind the bars of 
habit by the tyranny of appetite. In 
this respect the tobacco fiend, the drug 
fiend, and the food fiend are all in the 
same class. 

CAUSES 

Nervousness usually begins in the 
stomach. The primary causes are over- 
eating, combining foods 

Effect of ex- i • i • i • j 

cessive acid ^hich are mharmomous, and 
which set up chemical dis- 
turbance, or, the use of stimulants and 
narcotics. When we take into the stom- 
ach more food than the body needs, or 
can use, Nature calls to its aid an excess 
of hydrochloric acid, which irritates the 



1214 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

walls of the stomach. The food then 
passes into the intestines supercharged 
with acid, which sets up a similar irrita- 
tion throughout the intestinal tract, with 
the result that the millions of nerve 
fibers leading out from the stomach and 
the intestines to every part of the body, 
and from the stomach directly to the 
brain, cause mental unrest, and storms of 
depression popularly termed nervousness. 

As previously stated, the length of 
time food remains in the stomach is 

^ ^ ,. usually determined by the 

Constipation ^ y 

a factor in amouut of liydrochloric acid 
nervousness present. An excess of acid 
hurries the digestive process in the 
stomach, and forces the food along too 
rapidly into the upper part of the small 
intestine. Here the acid partly neu- 
traHzes the lubricating fluids, the food 
becomes congested, and we have the 
condition commonly called constipation, 
which is one of the most prolific causes of 
nervousness known. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1215 

The fecal matter being thus arrested 

in lis passage, remains in the body over 

^^ Nature's time-Hmit, and 

Pnmary cause 

of nervous- therefore undergoes a form 
of decomposition from which 
there arises carbon dioxid and other 
poisons which are absorbed into the 
blood, and which irritate the entire 
nervous organism. The expression of 
the nerves, or their protest against this 
condition, we call nervousness. 

The use of tobacco, tea, coffee, all 
stimulating and sedative beverages, all 

„^ , , stimulating and alcoholic 

Efifect of _ '^ 

stimulants on liquors, have a tendency to 
the nerves irritate the nerve fibers the 
same as an excess of hydrochloric acid. 
To quiet the nerves with a tonic or a 
drink is temporarily to paralyze these 
sensitive organs, leaving them in a worse 
state of excitement and disturbance w hen 
the effect of the drug has passed aw^ay. 

Many conditions of nervousness are 
attributed by nerve specialists and phy- 



1216 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

sicians to overwork, business worries, etc. 

With this diagnosis the writer does not 

^ , agree. Long experience 

Overwork, not Y . . 

a factor in with thcsc conditions has 

nervousness ^^^^,^^ ^J^at if the bodv is 

correctly fed according to age, occupa- 
tion, and temperature of environment, 
and stimulants omitted, one cannot over- 
work; sleep will come when Nature 
demands it, and the individual desiring 
to overwork will be forced to rest. ^Yhen 
the body is properly nourished and cared 
for according to these laws, worry ceases; 
we become tranquil, thoughtful, and 
philosophic. 

The highest ideal in life is to produce a 
perfect specimen of man or woman, 
physically, as well as mentally. The 
only way to accomplish this is to care 
for the body; the way to defeat this 
purpose is to overwork and worry in order 
to accumulate the thing called property. 

The desire to accunudate property has 
for its excuse immunity from work at

Working for life, but expcHence teaches 
defeat's *ite°° US that the physical cost of 
purpose this cffort defeats the very 

purpose for which we are striving. 

THE REMEDY 

The victim of nervousness should first 
seek a complete change of environment, 
and engage in pleasant, and, if possible, 
profitable occupation. 

Thousands of people become nervous 
wrecks bj^ pursuing work for which they 

Therapeutic liavc no natural taste or 

rnTfo°^th'e°''" ability, and many become 
pubUc good nervous from the monotony 
of environment. This is especially true 
with women, and while it is exceedingly 
diflScult for countless housewives and 
mothers to escape from this monotony, 
yet they can secure relief by becoming 
interested in some work of a public or 
quasi-public nature, or by taking up a 



1218 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

"hobby" that has for its purpose some 
form of public good. 

All people love the plaudits and esteem 
of their fellow-creatures, and there is 
nothing that will relieve the monotony 
and bring that satisfaction which all of 
us desire more quickly than earnest labor 
in a worthy cause. Therefore, this is one 
of the first and the best remedies for that 
character of nervousness caused by the 
monotony and narrowed life of the aver- 
age woman. 

The most prolific cause of nervousness, 

however, is incorrect, unnatural habits

The nervous person should ehminate 
from the diet acids, sweets (see Lesson 
VIII, Vol. II, pp. 313 and 332), flesh 
foods, and all stimulating beverages.

Exercise the same as prescribed for the 
first day. 

Fifth Day: The same as the fourth 
day. 

Sixth Day: The same as the first, 
repeating these menus for a period of three 
or four weeks. 

The nervous person should eat very 
sparingly of bread and cereal products, 
with the exception of bran and a few 
coarse articles, such as flaked or whole 
wheat or rye, and these should be taken 
sparingly while under treatment. 

A generous quantity of water should 
be drunk at meals, and mastication 
should be very thorough. 

If the body is overweight or inclined 
toward obesity, the diet should consist of 



1228 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

fewer fat-producing foods, such as grains, 
potatoes, milk, eggs, and an excess of 
vegetable proteids. If underweight or 
inclined toward emaciation, the fat-pro- 
ducing foods should predominate. 

Under all conditions of nervousness 
the patient should take an abundance of 
exercise and deep breathing in the open 
air, and sleep out of doors, if possible. 
An abundance of fresh air breathed into 
the lungs is the best blood purifier known, 
and if the blood is kept pure, and forced 
into every cell and capillary vessel of the 
body by exercise, the irritated nerves 
will share in the general improvement. 

The cool shower or sponge bath in the 
morning, preceded and followed by a few 
minutes' vigorous exercise, is a splendid 
sedative for irritated nerves. 

RECREATION 

The nervous person should divide the 
day as nearly as possible into three equal 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1229 

parts — eight hours' pleasant but useful 
work; eight hours' recreation, and eight 
hours' sleep. 

Under modern civilized conditions the 

majority of people do not seem to under- 

., , stand recreation. The sum- 

recessity for 

truerecre- mCF SCashoFC FCSOrtS, with 

***°° their expensive attractions 

and whirling life, the great hostelries in 
the hills and mountains, and the lakes 
where thousands of people congregate, 
entail upon them certain duties, anxieties, 
expectations, disappointments, and often 
financial strain that deprive these places 
of all features of recreation, and make the 
sojourn there one of labor and strife. The 
real purpose that takes most people to 
these resorts is to be seen; to "star'* them- 
selves before the multitude, which in its 
last analysis is a kind of vanity, and it is 
obvious that from any effort in this 
direction no recreation can be obtained. 
The nervous person should seek a few 
congenial and thoughtful companions, 



1230 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

and get back into the great heart of 
nature where everything moves in obe- 
dience to supreme law. Associate in- 
timately with animals; study their hab- 
its, and notice how they respond to 
kindness; admire their honesty; analyze 
the love and fidelity of a dog. This is 
true diversion and recreation. This de- 
fines the purpose of life, if there be pur- 
pose behind it. This draws a sharp 
distinction between the condition that 
makes nervousness and the condition 
that makes honest, thoughtful, useful 
human beings. 



Lesson XVIII 

POINTS ON PRACTISE 



iiei 



INTRODUCTION TO POINTS ON PRACTISE 

The preceding lessons were written 
through a period of many years' active 
practise in treating dis-eases by scientific 
feeding. They were intended as a normal 
course to qualify doctors, nurses, and 
those who wished to treat dis-ease by 
this method. However, the demand for 
this class of information has come from 
people in every walk of life, therefore the 
lessons, and all technical matter compos- 
ing this entire work have been most 
carefully revised and rewritten in simple 
language so that any person of ordinary 
intelligence can comprehend them. 

The following lesson is intended for the 
guidance of the practitioner in beginning 
his work in this branch of the healing art. 

Inasmuch as nearly all human ills are 
caused by errors in eating, the preceding 
lessons have been confined almost wholly 
to dis-eases that originate in the digestive 
organs. 

1233 



LESSON XVIII 

Points on Practise 

There are a great many abnormal 

conditions of the human body classed as 

TN . ^ . . dis-eases that bear a very 

Dietebc treat- ^ , *' 

ment is recon- rcmotc Tclation to diet, but 
stnictive -j^ practise the student will 

soon learn that many of these conditions, 
which have not been considered in these 
lessons, will entirely disappear when 
the diet is perfected. This is true be- 
cause dietetic treatment, based upon the 
fundamental laws of nutrition, is re- 
constructive, hence every part of the 
anatomy shares in the general improve- 
ment. 

There are many logical arguments to 
support the theory that there are no 
incurable dis-eases. There are many 
cases, however, where the vitality has be- 

1235 



1236 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

come so low that recovery from dis-ease 
is impossible, but if the patient could be 

taken in time, the correct 
tifi?feedS*°" diagnosis made, and the 

proper food, air, and exercise 
given. Nature would begin her work of 
rebuilding at once. In view of these 
facts it is somewhat difficult to fix a 
limit to the scope of scientific feeding. 

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE PRACTITIONER 

The science of prescribing diet is a 
work that can be best conveyed to the 
patient in writing, hence one 
i'etter?*"*"^ of the first and most im- 
portant things for the new 
practitioner to do is to study the art of 
polemics — acquire the abihty to write 
plain, convincing literature and letters. 
This is one of the greatest arts within the 
scope of human learning, and is probably 
susceptible of greater development than 
any other branch of human endeavor. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1337 

Every person has his own individual 
method of expression that should be 
preserved and cultivated. Select some 
good author and copy his logic, but not 
his language. For this purpose I would 
recommend the works of Henry George, 
the great economic philosopher — and 
probably one of the greatest polementi- 
tians that ever lived. 

The student should begin by taking 

up some simple branch or certain subject 

Writing is ^^ ^^^ work, and writing a 

mental short argument or essay upon 

calisthenics ., . i" i 1 1 . i 

it, using every fact that he 
can possibly command to convince im- 
aginary readers of the correctness of his 
theories. Select a new subject and write 
something on it every day. This is merely 
mental calisthenics, and after a month's 
training the thoughts and the language 
will flow with a freedom that will enable 
the student to write just as he feels. 

It would be well to arrange an argument 
based upon each lesson separately. 



1238 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

dividing it into short chapters. These 

arguments or essays should be logically 

. ^ ,, , arranged to form a booklet, 

A booklet '^ 

describing with propcF title, as such 
your wor representative literature is 

vitally necessary to the growth and the 
success of your work. It will also be 
found that this will be splendid mental 
exercise, and will serve well in pre- 
senting your work, either orally, or by 
letter. 

Every one should endeavor to be 
original in his literature; in other words, 
no special effort should be 
Jf'ttr^r"" -"ade to quote any "au- 
thority" or to copy the style 
of other writers. Put your own personal- 
ity into your work, for the most successful 
writer is not always the one who uses the 
most learned, polished or scholarly lan- 
guage, but the one who can convey his 
thoughts to the minds of others in the 
simplest and the most comprehensive 
language. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 12S9 

Language at l)e.st is but a vehicle for 
conveying the thoughts of one person to 
the mind of another, and while there are 
accepted standards in literature and let- 
ters, from which one should not make too 
radical a departure, yet the ability to 
present one's convictions, or position 
convincingly should be of first considera- 
tion. 

The most important thing in writing 
is to have something to say; then to say 
it so that it can be understood. 



VALUE OF EXPERIENCE 

Experience is the only method by 
which theory can be converted into 
knowledge. The best possible source of 
information, therefore, is personal ex- 
perimentation. If the student should 
have any disorder, especially of digestion 
and assimilation of food, or elimination 
of waste, he should experiment upon 



1240 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

himself along the lines laid out in this 
course. He should keep an accurate 
record of selections, combinations, and 
proportions of food, with results or 
symptoms. He may thus be able to 
arrange menus for himself, even more 
effective than those given as examples or 
guides throughout the course. 

If there are no personal disorders that 
will permit of such experiments, then they 
should be made upon some other person 
with whom the student is sufficiently 
familiar in order that accurate informa- 
tion concerning the results may be 
secured. 

Though the student may be normal 
and healthy, it is possible to make many 
valuable experiments in regard to special 
adaptations of diet, such as combinations 
to induce natural sleep; to produce and 
to relieve constipation and diarrhea; 
to produce excessive body-heat when 
exposed to cold, or the minimum of heat 
in summer, or in warm chmates. 



EN( YCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1241 
VALUE OF DIAGNOSIS 

Correct diagnosis is one of the most 
important factors in the practise of 
applied food chemistry, and when a 
correct diagnosis has been made the 
remedy will suggest itself if the student 
has a thorough understanding of causes. 

In diagnosis it is often necessary to 

ascertain the patient's general habits of 

_ eating- durin<? the few years 

Causes some- o o ^ 

umes very prior to the appearance of 
remo e ^|^^ disordcrs. As an ex- 

ample, rheumatic conditions are often 
superinduced by an overconsumption of 
starch, usually cereal starch and acids. 
This overindulgence may have continued 
for several years before the appearance 
of any rheumatic symptoms. The pri- 
mary causes being residual in the body, 
exposure, low vitality, or extreme cli- 
matic changes may give expression to 
them in the form of rheumatism, or some 
kindred trouble. 



1242 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

After determining the causes, a diet 
should be designed which will counteract 

existing conditions. This 
ited"feeding" ^^y usuallv be accomplished 

by limiting the quantity of 
food somewhat below the demands of 
normal hunger. This will give the di- 
gestive organs less work to do, and the 
body an opportunity to take up or con- 
sume any excess of food matter that may 
have become congested. In cases accom- 
panied by loss of hunger, it is sometimes 
necessary to put the patient upon an 
absolute fast from one to three days, but 
in the majority of cases a semi-fast is 
best, prescribing light, nutritious foods 
of a remedial character. 

EDUCATE YOUR PATIENT 

In beginning treatment each patient 
should be made acquainted with the fact 
that the radical change in diet may 
bring slight discomfort. While the sys- 



ENXYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1243 

tern is adjusting itself to the new regimen, 

there is usually a slight loss of weight and 

a feeling of weakness or lassitude. 

It should be impressed upon the mind 

of the patient that regaining health and 

strength is in realit}" a pro- 
curing a slow f _ ,1 1 ,• 
process ^^^^ ^^ gFOWth OF eVOlutlOn, 

hence slow and gradual; that 
when one has violated the laws of health 
for many years, Nature will not, or prob- 
ably cannot forgive all these sins and 
repair all these wrongs in a month or two. 
However, when one gets in harmony 
with the physical universe, and conforms 
to the laws of his organization, Nature 
will construct (cure) much more rapidly 
than she formerly destroyed (produced 
dis-ease). 

The practitioner may have many cases 
that for some seemingly mysterious rea- 

The patient ^^^ ^'^^1 ^^^ rcspoud tO a 

should agree perfectly natural diet and 

with the diet mi , i p i ii i 

Will, thereiore, be called upon 
to change the diet from time to time in 



1244 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

the vain hope of jBnding combinations 
of food that will agree. In these cases 
the student should not be led to deviate 
too far from what he knows to be a nat- 
ural and chemically harmonious regimen. 
If such a diet does not produce the desired 
results, it is not always the fault of the 
food, but the fault of the patient. If 
the food is right, and does not agree, it 
is the patient that is wrong, hence the 
logical thing to do is to make the rebel- 
lious patient agree with the food, instead 
of searching for a food to agree with the 
patient. 

These facts should be impressed 
strongly upon the mind of the one under 
treatment, and he should be prevailed 
upon, if possible, to conform strictly to 
a correct diet until Nature is given time 
and opportunity to bring about an adjust- 
ment between the individual and his food. 

It has been the custom of the medical 
profession for centuries to shroud its 
work in mystery, to write prescriptions 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET Ui5 

in a dead language, to keep patients in 
ignorance of the remedies being applied. 
This seems to be necessary, probably 
because an intelligent discussion of allo- 
pathic drugs, their sources and their 
constituent elements would, no doubt, 
prove fatal to their administration. The 
food scientist should follow exactly the 
opposite course. He should make a 
very careful diagnosis, taking into ac- 
count the diet, habits of exercise and 
exposure to fresh air prior to the appear- 
ance of the dis-ease, as well as at the time 
of treatment. By giving the patient a 
thorough understanding of your work, 
you gain his confidence and faith, which 
wield a very powerful influence over the 
body. 

EFFECT OF MENTAL CONDITIONS 

A very careful examination should 
also be made of the mental conditions. 
Worry, fear, or anxiety often produce seri- 



1246 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

ouH digestive trouble which is generally 
„ . attributed to other causes, 

Worry or fear _ ' 

causes stem- and which should be treated 
ac trou e very differently from the 
same trouble caused by errors in eating. 
During my professional work many 
patients have come to me laden with fear, 
caused by the thoughtless or perhaps 
reckless statement of some physician. 
It is indeed as great a crime for a doctor 
to pass the "sentence of death" upon a 
man who comes to him for help as it 
would be for the judge of a court to 
pronounce the death sentence upon a 
prisoner without hearing the evidence, 
and some day when the power of the 
mind or suggestion is understood, it will 
be so considered. 

It is impossible to fully estimate the 
effects of fear on the human body. Each

potent factors in the cause of dis-ease. 



ENXYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1247 

Christian Science has reheved thousands 
of people through the simple presentation 
of a philosophy that induces the individ- 
ual to throw off this burden of fear. It 
matters not whether this burden is cast 
upon the Gentle Nazarene or John Doe, 
the fact that it has been disposed of often 
leads to relief and recovery. Christian 
Science has done the world a great service 
— it has put out the fires of an orthodox 
hell by pouring into it orthodox medicine. 
^Yith a clear knowledge of the powerful 
psychological law, and the laws of human 
nutrition, the student has at his command 
two of the greatest forces in Nature for 
the relief of human suffering. 



PUBLICITY 

Judicious and truthful advertising is 
another important factor in the success 
of the food scientist. Advertising has 
been considered unethical by medical men 



1248 EXCYCLOPEDLV OF DIET 

for years. It has been discredited, not 
because it is wrong, or because there is 
Value of ^^y harm in teUing the 

truthful ad- pubHc the truth about one's 
vertismg busiucss, but bccausc so 

many spurious nostrums and patent medi- 
cines were exploited by "quack" doctors, 
that the respectable physician deemed it 
best to adopt the other extreme in his 
effort to keep entirely out of this class. 
Advertising, however, is rapidly ac- 
quiring a more honest and upright char- 
acter. The best magazines and some 
weekly newspapers will no longer accept 
advertisements of a questionable char- 
acter, especially regarding medical reme- 
dies. Many of these excellent publica- 
tions go so far as to vouch for and 
guarantee the honesty of everything 
exploited in their pages. Such methods 
are gradually purifying the advertising 
atmosphere. 

There is no logical reason why anybody 
who has a virtuous and useful article, or

In preparing advertising literature, 
whether for magazines, booklets, or let- 
ters, facts and truth concerning your 
work are all that is necessary. No state- 
ment should be made that can in any 
way jeopardize your reputation; nothing 
should be stated or claimed that cannot 
actually be made good. 

For many years it has been my policy 
to keep my advertising conservatively 
below the full limit of facts; in other 
words, the whole truth concerning that 
which can be accomplished by scientific 
feeding sometimes seems so startling 
to the lay mind that the experienced 
advertiser will not state it as it 
really is.

A patient of mine who had been in a 
wheel chair for twelve years, and af- 
flicted for twenty years with locomotor 
ataxia, was so much improved within a 
year's time that he walked from Brooklyn 
to my office in New York City to exhibit 
himself. He gave me a testimonial 
letter and the privilege of using it in my 
advertisements. I wrote up the facts 
in regard to his case and submitted them 
to my agent, who was an expert adver- 
tiser, and he advised me not to state the 
facts as they were; the public, he con- 
tended, would not accept them as true. 

BE COURTEOUS AND TOLERANT 

It is almost impossible to estimate the 
moral effect of a broad-minded, tolerant 
and courteous attitude toward others 
engaged in the practise of the heahng art. 
Medical doctors seldom agree, especially 
those of different schools. They accuse 
each other of ignorance and incompetence, 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1251 

and the public is sometimes inclined to 
concede that tliey are right. 

In certainty and in truth one has 
confidence and strength which is always 
conducive to tolerance. The food scien- 
tist, knowing the laws of cause and effect 
in regard to nutrition, and knowing the 
proper use of natural methods of diet 
and hygiene in the prevention and the 
cure of specific dis-eases, needs neither 
to dispute with a fellow practitioner, nor 
to argue with his patient. lie can afford 
to state his position and quietly allow 
Nature to prove his claims.

The following lessons, while they do

so closely alhed to these subjects that

LESSON XIX 

Evolution of Man 



WHAT IS evolution? 

If a resident of a city, who is not 
familiar with modern farm machinery, 
should see a grain-binder at work, he 
would be impressed with the skill and 
the ingenuity of man. In all probability 
he would think that the machine was the 
product of one inventive mind. In this, 
however, he would be mistaken. The 
reaper in its modern form is the result of 
gradual development or growth. 

The earliest method of gathering grain 

was pulling it up by the roots. Later, 

as cutting tools were in- 

tyoiutiTn^^ ''^ vented, a rough knife was 

used to sever the stalks just 

above the ground. An improvement 

1255 



1256 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

upon this method was the cycle; then 
came the scythe, then the cradle; and 
next came the mower which was operated 
by horse-power. From the mower was 
developed the self rake, which bunched 
the grain so that the hand-binders could 
work with greater facility. The next 
improvement was a self-binding machine. 
In the present machine we have all of 
these and many other improvements, 
which give greater speed with less waste 
of labor and time. 

This development of the grain-binder 
is a process of evolution. In order to 
understand a machine so as to use it 
intelligently, or to make improvements 
upon it, it is necessary not only to know 
the machine as it actually is, but also to 
know the history of its development up 
to its present form. 

The story of the evolution of a machine 
is, at best, but a crude illustration of 
the evolution of man. Nevertheless, the 
conclusion is the same. If we are to un- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 12o7 

derstand man, we must study not only 

his present physical and mental state, 

^ ^ but also the history of his 

To know man *' 

is to know development. Yet those 
evou on wliosc work is conccrned 

directly with man — whether they be 
teachers, guiding the growth of the child; 
statesmen, formulating the laws and 
regulations by w^hich men are to be con- 
trolled in their public actions; or physi- 
cians, who are supposed to instruct and 
to guide men in the care of their physical 
well-being — are often densely ignorant 
of the most rudimentary knowledge of 
the evolution of man as it is now known 
and understood by the leading scientists 
of the world. 

Our entire system of education, our 
ideas of health and dis-ease, our social 
customs, the principles of our form of 
government; our ideas of right and 
wrong, of rewards and punishments, are 
all fundamentally concerned with the 
evolution of man, and when this knowl- 



1258 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

edge is studied with as much application 
as are the ancient languages, we may- 
expect to see humanity progress at a 
rate hitherto unknown. 

The evolution of man has been very 
much misunderstood. The term "evolu- 

^. .^ tion" is a broad one. It may 

Significance " 

of the term Tcfcr to the growth of the 
"evolution" individual, or to the race. 
It may mean the development of strictly 
physical organs, or of mental habits, of 
social customs, or of material products of 
man's genius, as the great works of civi- 
lization in the form of recorded learning, 
and the wonderful products of man's 
building ingenuity as seen in modern 
cities. 

The subject of the evolution of the 
human race may be grouped into three 
general kinds of development or growth: 

1 The development of the physical 

man 

2 The development of the mind 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1259 

3 The developinent of custom and 
of external civilization 

Evolution in these three directions has 
taken phice simultaneously. The mind 
and the body depend upon each other 
for their life and actions; while customs 
are merely the product of many minds 
working together and communicating 
their ideas to each other. 



The human race is but the sum of the 
individuals composing it. We cannot 
consider the development of the indi- 
vidual without considering him in his 
relation to the race, neither can we 
understand the development of the race 
without understanding the growth of 
the individual. 

One distinction too often overlooked 
by those who are not familiar with physio- 
logical science is the difference between 
actual physical inheritance and external 



1260 ENXYCLOPEDL\ OF DIET 

customs. I wish to dwell at length upon 

this distinction, because a lack of under- 

Difference be- standing upon this poiut has 

tween inherited i . i e 

and acquired Dccn the souFcc of many 

characteristics erroFs of judgment on the 

part of those who have been interested 

in the subject of physical training and 

food science. 

At birth the individual inherits an 
organism with certain tendencies, both 
physical and mental, but this inheritance 
should not be confused with the physical 
habits which the child acquires by train- 
ing from its parents and its associates. 
Thus, the child may inherit a brilliant 
mind, a weak stomach, or a sixth finger, 
but the child does not inherit a liking for 
broiled lobster, or a fondness for golf, 
or for driving an aeroplane. These are 
acquired and developed as habits, the 
same as the child would learn English or 
French, or would cultivate a fancy for 
parting his hair in the middle, or on the 
left side.

THE THREE GREAT PROOFS OF THE EVOLUTION 
OF ANIMAL LIFE 

At the present time scientists are agreed 
upon tlie general theory of the evolution 
of man. The discussions pro and con 
regarding this, which exist today, are 
either discussions of minor points whick 
have not yet been clearly worked out, 
or are the discussions of people who have 
grasped only a portion of the idea of 
evolution, and who are ignorant of its 
broader conception and of the facts which 
science has brought to the light of day. 

The three great proofs of evolution are : 

1 The actual history of the past 

recorded as fossils in the rocks 
and in the relics of pre-historic 
races 

2 The existence in the world today 

of a range of animals and 
plants which shows living ex- 
amples of earlier types 



1262 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

3 The repetition of the develop- 
ment of man as found in the 
growth of the individual 

These three separate records of the 
development of living beings are con- 
sidered by scientists as a most con- 
clusive proof of the truth of evolution. 
Recorded as fossils in the rocks, we 
find the story of the development of 
all life upon the earth, from its simplest 
to its highest forms of plants and animals 
that live today, among which is man. 

The first forms of animal life were, in 

all probability, minute one-celled organ- 

,. , isms; these left no visible 

The earliest 

forms of fossil remains. As soon as 

ammai ufe auimals dcvclopcd hard parts 
in their bodies, such as shells and 
bones, we find a record of their existence 
as fossils. The earliest recorded forms 
of life were various kinds of sea -creatures, 
of which the modern Crustacea (lobsters, 
etc.), snails, clams, and various shell- 
fishes are types. Later were developed 



EXCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET U63 

boneless fishes, on the order of skates. 
After these came true fishes; then am- 
phibia (frogs, etc.); then reptiles, birds, 
and, last of all, mammals, including man. 

The facts are the same, whether we 
take the history of the successive forms 
as recorded as fossils in the rocks, or the 
living representatives that remain to tell 
the story in another form. 

The third proof, which is the story of 

evolution recorded in the growth and

nucleus \ Ti? j i j £ 

As lite developed irom sim- 
pler forms, each individual animal or 
plant became more complex, or carried 
a httle further the process of growth. 
But the method of reproduction of new 
individuals remained fundamentally the 
same. Each individual began, hke its 
ancestors, as a single-cell being. By the 
process of nutrition these single cells 
in each case would grow, divide, and pro- 
duce various tissues and organs, but 



1264 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

always repeating the general story of the 
development of the race. 

The growth of the human embrj'^o 
offers many proofs of evolution, which 
are wholly unexplainable 
humVn embryo ^pon any othcr theory of the 
origin of man, and would in 
themselves prove the truth of this view 
of man's creation were the proofs of geol- 
ogy entirely lacking. A single example 
will serve as an illustration. The human 
embryo at a certain period develops gill 
slits in the neck, the same as the embryo 
of a fish. This formation of unused or 
rudimentary organs which are afterwards 
outgrown, is very common throughout 
the animal world. In the upper jaw of a 
calf there are formed at a certain period 
incisor teeth, which never grow through 
the gums, but are reabsorbed and disap- 
pear as the calf develops. 

I will not go further into the proofs 
and facts of the general theory of the 
evolution of animal life, but will now 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1265 

consider the later period of the develop- 
ment of man, which will show us his rela- 
tion to other animals, and from which 
we can derive much valuable information 
regarding his natural physiological re- 
quirements. 

MAN'S ANIMAL KINSHIP 

The conception of man being descended 
from a monkey has been the subject of 
much wit and mirth. 

The scientist is not concerned with this 

theory; he only claims that man is very 

„ , , ^ closely related to certain 

Man's relation ^ 

to anthropoid monkcy-likc forms know^n as 
*''*^ anthropoid apes. The proofs 

of this assertion are abundant and con- 
clusive. In fact, anthropoid apes, such as 
gorillas, chimpanzees and orang-outangs, 
are much more closely related to man 
than they are to other kinds of monkeys. 
This relation is shown by very close re- 
semblance between the anatomy of man 
and apes, especially as to the teeth and 



1266 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

digestive organs. Other facts are now 
known, of which Darwin and early in- 
vestigators were ignorant, which prove 
this relation in a much more striking 
manner. 

Late studies upon the growth of the 

embryo of anthropoid apes have shown 

f. t that they were at certain 

Comparison of •^ 

blood from periods almost indistinguish- 

maa and apes i i p i i 

able irom human embrj'os. 
Another proof, quite striking and inter- 
esting, is in the similarity of the parasites 
and dis-eases of men and apes. Scientists 
have, within the past few years, made a 
series of comparative investigations upon 
the blood and serum of men and apes, 
which have resulted in most remarkable 
discoveries. There are certain accurate 
tests known to the physiological chemist 
by which human blood may be distin- 
guished from the blood of all other ani- 
mals, but the blood of these man-like 
apes is an exception to this, and cannot 
be distinguished from human blood. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1267 

From these facts it is clear that the 

earlier types of men were creatures whose 

Diflference in plivsical development and 

!?!„t!,7!!!n whose habits were not verj^ 

meat ol man •^ 

and apes different from those of apes. 
The development that has taken place 
since that time is truly very wonderful 
and has resuUed in a widening gap between 
man and apes that today seems very 
great. The truth remains, however, that 
this gap is not so much one of anatomy 
and ph^'siology as it is one of mentality 
and of external habits and material aids 
to living that have resulted from man's 
greatly developed mental faculties. 

Thus, when the mind of man reached 
the stage of development in which the 

Power of use of articulatc speech be- 

speech a fac- ^^^^^ possiblc, the cvolution 

tor in man s ^ ' 

evolution of intelligence proceeded at 

a very much more rapid pace than had 
been possible before. He could communi- 
cate his ideas to his fellow-creatures; 
concerted action became possible, and the 



12G8 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

faculty of reason, or the ability to think 
was multiplied by the number of beings 
who could communicate with each other. 

The power of reason and the ability 
to communicate ideas resulted in the 
formation of those habits which distin- 
guish man from other animals. ^Mien 
one primitive man learned the use of a 
club as a weapon, found how to use sharp- 
edged stones as cutting tools, or discov- 
ered the wonders and power of fire, he 
communicated his new-found knowledge 
to the other members of his tribe, with 
the result that new ideas became common 
property. 

This spreading of habits or customs 
took place very rapidly among men and 

Man's bad was the sourcc of the various 

habits have i i • u J' t* • i J 

kept pace with changcs which distmguished 
his progress civilizcd life from savage life. 
But we must here point out that not only 
good habits were so spread, but bad ones 
as well. The origin and the use of opium 
and of alcohol, the injuries of fashionable 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1209 

dress and the economic wrongs of 
tyrannical government originated along 
with the birth of language, art, science, 
and all that uplifts and benefits man- 
kind. 

Clearly, then, that man is misinformed 
who defends a wrong by referring to its 
age and reasons that, if certain things 
were harmful, they would not have sur- 
vived. To the young thinker the exist- 
ence of harmful ideas and habits among 
mankind may at first seem inconsistent 
with the principles of the survival of the 
fittest, but this difficulty will disappear 
upon further investigation. 

Since the beginning of recorded his- 
tory many factors have helped to deter- 

Factors that mine what kind of individ- 

su^i>S°o/^^ uals and races should survive. 

races War, ccouomic wealth and 

poverty, intellectual beliefs, religions, and 
social institutions have all been potent 
factors in determining who should sur- 
vive. ^Yith wealth and conquest came 



1270 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

the opportunity to gratify tastes and 

passions of which the poor individuals of 

weaker races could not avail themselves. 

Many of the habits and customs which 

man has developed are not necessary to 

Many habits life, and may be positively 

andcustoms detrimental to health and 

detrimental to 

ufe and health longevity. They have been 
handed down from generation to genera- 
tion, not because of their benefit to man, 
but in spite of their detriment. 

Such condition of affairs would not be 
possible if man were not the dominant 
animal. Man's intellectual supremacy 
has given him power over the rest of 
nature, which has resulted in making 
his struggle for existence much less severe. 
His use of weapons and of artificial pro- 
tection from natural destructive forces, 
as severe heat or cold, has made it possible 
for him to live and to produce ofl'spring 
in spite of wrong habits and wrong 
methods of hving, and the natural resist- 
ance of life. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1271 

A prevalent error that is due to an 

incomplete knowledge of the facts of 

Man's organs cvolution is tlic belief that 

Il!l!.,^f -Tp! orijans readily change or 

power 01 aaap- ~ i' o 

ution adapt themselves to the 

habits or environment of the individual. 
This is not true to the extent that it is 
ordinarily believed. Each individual has 
a certain limited power of adaptation. 
He may develop his lungs to a greater 
breathing capacity, or train his hand for 
certain skilled work, but these particular 
acquired habits of the individual are not 
inherited. 

Evolution of the race proceeds by the 
law of natural selection. Thus, if those 
who are born with great vigor and strong 
lungs are enabled to live where their weak- 
lunged neighbors will die, the result will 
be that their offspring, having greater 
lung capacity, will form a race with 
increased lung capacity. But the indi- 
vidual training of the lungs, or of the 
hand, or of any other organ of the body. 



1272 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

will not of itself change the inherited 
tendency, or, to use a common term of 
the scientist, the germ-plasm of the 
race. 

Organs and functions will change or 
become evolved by natural selections; 
that is, where it is a matter of life and 
death. But where the selective agencies 
depend upon other things, an organ may 
be used or abused for thousands of suc- 
cessive generations, and yet the natural 
inherited organ of the new-born child 
will be identical in development and 
function to that of the remote ancestor. 
There are abundant proofs that so- 
called "acquired characteristics" are not

flat head which has for generations been 
produced by binding a flat stone on the 
soft skull of the new-born infant. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1273 

In tlip light of this fact we may under- 
stand liow it has })een possible for man 
to live through the varying dietetic 
habits and customs that the constantly 
changing ideas and tastes of civilization 
have thrust upon his physical organism. 
Each individual has transmitted to his 
offspring the same type of digestive organs 
and functions that he himself inherited 
from his remote anthropoid ancestors. 

Thus, such terms as "back to nature," 

"natural diet," etc., only mean to the 

Meaning of food scicntist the habits of 

expression ft .i j«, i*i* 

"Mturar' "^^ ^^ ^'^^ dietarj^ whicli is 
diet most suited to the unper- 

verted physical organism of man. They 
do not imply the meaning that is popu- 
larly given to the term, of casting aside 
all the habits and customs of civilized 
man, but only the adapting of these 
customs to the inherited physiological 
organism of man. 

Indeed, science may actually improve 
upon primitive conditions, and still not 



1274 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

be inconsistent with the requirements of 
the inherited physiological machine. No 
intelligent man will dispute the advantage 
of a house in a snowstorm. Yet the house 
is artificial. It is not "natural" in the 
sense that the term is commonly used. 

Or, again, man has by the aid of civi- 
lization rendered it possible for us to 
use foods far removed from their source 
of production, or, by preservation, to 
have them at seasons of the year when 
nature does not provide them. These 
artificial results of civilization are good. 
They are a part of the story of evolution, 
the benefit of which no one can question. 

But the great majority of the dietetic 

"frills" of modern man are actually un- 

suited to his phvsiological 

";2pt«" make-up, and exceedingly 
harmful. They have been 
developed as have habits of drink or per- 
sonal adornment and may be in direct 
antagonism to the ultimate well-being 
of the human race. 



ENCYCLOPEDLV OF DIET 1275 

I haw ])ri('fly reviewed the liistory of 
the evoliilioii of man. The facts to be 
remembered are: 

1 That men are descended from 

earlier and more primitive 
types of beings and are gov- 
erned by the same general 
laws of iieredity and nutrition 
as are other forms of animals 

2 Man, being a distinct species of 

animal, has particular laws 
that apply only to him, and 
therefore we should be careful 
not to judge him too closely 
by facts regarding other forms 
of animal life 

3 Man has changed very materi- 

ally in the few thousand years 
of his civilization, in his ex- 
ternal habits and customs, but 
very little in his fundamental 
physiological processes; there- 
fore we should be able to 
judge what will be best suited 



1276 ENCYCLOPEDL\ OF DIET 

for his needs by studying the 
process of the development of 
his organs during the milHons 
of years that preceded the 
historic period. This plane of 
life is best seen today in the 
case of savages unacquainted 
with fire, and in the case of 
anthropoid apes. 

With this general survey of evolution, 
and a clear understanding of the princi- 
ples involved, I trust the reader will 
consider the facts here presented in the 
unprejudicial spirit of the true scientist.

LESSON XX 

Sex and Heredity 



THE ORIGIN OF SEX 

That part of human Hfe and living that 
is associated with the functions of sex 
and reproduction is at once the cause of 
the world's greatest misery and the 
world's greatest happiness. It is the 
subject of the greatest popular ignorance 
and superstition, and at the same time 
the field of the most wonderful of all 
scientific knowledge. 

For the origin of sex we must look 
back into the remote ages of creation 
in the early stages of organic evolution. 

The first essential property of matter 
that makes life possible is the power of 

1279 



1280 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

nutrition, which means the abihty of 
„ _, , , the hving cell to transform 

Fundamental *=* 

function of othcF chcmical substances 
the ceu -^^^^ -^^ ^^^^ protoplasm or 

living substances. 

But this world would have remained a 
barren mass of igneous rock if nutrition 
had been the only function with which 
the earlier forms of life were endowed. 
Not only must the living cell be enabled 
to grow by absorbing other substances, 
but it must reproduce itself, or multiply 
the number of living individuals. 

The first method by which this was 

accomplished was undoubtedly one of 

simple division; that is, the 

fepfoduction ^^^ing ccll grcw by absorbing 
other substances and when 
sufficient size had been attained, divided, 
forming two daughter-cells. This divi- 
sion process of reproduction is the form 
by which all bacteria (so-called dis-ease 
germs) and many other lower forms of 
life increase their numbers. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1281 

Tliis process of reproduction, by simple 

division, was early supplemented by 

„ . , another process of reproduc- 

Second form ... 

of reproduc- tiou in wliicli two living cells 
first fused or combined and 
then divided to form two or more daugh- 
ter-cells. This form of reproduction 
seems to have added stimulus or vitality 
to the organisms. The supposed reason 
for this is that the isolated cell was 
inclined to weaken or lose its chemical 
balance or tone. The exact nature of 
this deterioration is not very clearly 
understood, but in a higher form of life 
it is well illustrated by the tendency of 
certain plants to "run out" when grown 
continually in the same soil, or of animals 
to become weakened when inbred. At 
least, all scientists concede that with the 
process of fusion or the com- 

fl'Zfo'J cTus bining of two cells there is 
added a stimulating and in- 
vigorating force which enables life to 
combat more successfully the unfavor- 



1282 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

able elements of its environment, and 
to change or evolve into higher forms. 

Throughout the range of plant and 

animal life this process of cell union, 

or sexual reproduction, has 

Sexual repro- ^ 

duction in growu and become elabor- 
**^*°*^ ated into most varied and 

wonderful forms. Large volumes could 
be written describing the many wonderful 
adaptations of plant and animal life, the 
purpose of which is to secure sexual 
reproduction. All those who have studied 
botany are familiar with the many ways 
in which the seeds of plants are fertilized 
by pollen. For instance, certain species 
of orchids have a receptacle in the blos- 
som, shaped like a teapot, which is filled 
with a fluid resembling water. This little 
tea-pot has an entrance and an exit. 
Near the entrance is sweet-scented nectar 
which attracts the bee. As 

Fertilization ■! u xi i ±\.' 

of orchids the bee passes through this 

gateway he is tripped up on 

a little trap-door arrangement and pre- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1283 

cipitated into the fluid. His wings hav- 
ing become wet, he is ohHged to crawl 
out through the exit. 

The object of this elaborate device is 
as follows: In the entrance passageway 
The wonderful is locatcd the stiguia (female 
flowerferti- organ), while in the exit 
ization passagcwav the male or pol- 

len-bearing organ of the orchid is found. 
The bee visits several of these flowers 
consecutively, and, as he makes his exit 
from each flower, he bears away on his 
body a portion of the pollen, which is 
transferred to the stigma of the next 
flower visited; while the bee, being forced 
to go through a "plunge bath" before 
visiting another flower, acquires a fresh 
load of pollen in each case. This scheme 
is a certain means of securing fertilization 
or sexual reproduction, and positively 
prevents inbreeding (the fertilization of a 
flower by its own pollen). This is merely 
one of the wonderful adaptations of 
nature in the solution of the sex problem.

of sexual reproduction are also varied 

and wonderful. In many of 

frnffil?, the lower forms of animals, 

among iisnes ' 

such as the various sea- 
creatures, the methods of reproduction 
may be those of division, as first men- 
tioned, or a method combining division 
with true sexual reproduction. In the 
case of fishes, the eggs of the female are 
deposited in the bottom of a stream and 
are later fertilized by the sperm-cells of 
the male fishes. This involves a tre- 
mendous waste of reproductive cells, 
scarcely less extravagant than the waste 
of pollen in plants, such as is seen in a 
corn-field when the ground becomes yel- 
„ , , low, durino' the tasseling 

Nature's . . 

wasteful season, with the myriads of 

methods pollen grains that failed to 

secure lodgment upon the silks of the 

young ears of corn. 

In the types of animals that are of 

higher form than fishes, that is, reptiles, 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1285 

birds, and mammals, the fertilization of 

the germ-cell (epg) takes place within tlie 

_ . ,. body of the female. In the 

Reproduction '' 

in higher caSC of the lattCF gFOUp 

forms of life i .1 , 

mammals — the true egg 
is hatched within the body of the female, 
and the offspring, or embrA'o as it is 
known to scientists, grows there for a 
considerable period before birth. 

A RATIONAL VIEW OF SEXUAL HEALTH 

The anatomy and the physiology of 
reproduction will not be considered in 
detail in this work, as this w^ould require 
a very lengthy and technical treatise. 
The remainder of the lesson will be 
devoted to the relation of the reproduc- 
tive functions to general health and happi- 
ness. 

In the process of evolution this func- 
tion of reproduction was vitally essential 
to the life of the race. As a result there 
developed in all animal life strong sexual 



1286 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

or reproductive instincts. As is plainly 

evident, all animals, including man, with 

^ , , such instincts most strongly

of reproduc- dcvelopcd would bc the most 

live instincts J? i • i • _ 

successiul m producing 
young, and through these offsprings the 
race or species would inherit like repro- 
ductive desires. 

In the case of man and the higher form 
of animals, this general instinct, the pur- 
Kinship of the posc of which was to producc 
nil and sod^' offspring, bccamc diversified 
instinct into many instincts. Not 

only does the reproductive instinct in this 
broad sense include what is commonly 
known as sexual passion in man, but it 
may very truly be said to be the essence 
of sexual love and parental love. Broad- 
minded scientists are even inclined to 
believe that the so-called social instinct 
or love for our fellowmen is but a distant 
reflection or shadow, as it were, of the 
original or natural instinct to produce 
offspring. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1287 

There has arisen among civihzed man 
a tendency to separate and class as two 
distinct things the strictly physical ele- 
ment of sexual desire, and the associate 
emotion of intellectual love between the 
sexes. As a matter of fact there is no 
distinct line of demarcation. 

That the former instinct has grown 

into disrepute and has come to be con- 

overindui- sidcrcd a forbidden topic in 

era^'ng a!fd°" pohte socicty, is duc to the 

destructive fact that scxual passiou, like 

all other human acts which may be a 

source of gratification, can degenerate by 

overindulgence into a destructive and 

demoralizing vice. This is equally true 

of other forms of appetite, but the reason 

that the instinct of sex, when degenerated, 

becomes such a tremendous source of 

destruction and death is because of the 

important part played in the game of life 

by the reproductive function. 

The functions of reproduction are, in 
both sexes, very intimately and closely 



1288 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

associated with the nervous or vital 

mechanism of the entire body. For this 

Relation of rcason, whcn the sexual func- 

sexual func- , • a. j i j 

tions to the tions are perverted or abused 
nervous system the rcsult is scrious injury to 
the general nerve tone or vital force of 
the system. Likewise the contrary propo- 
sition is true; therefore, when for any 
reason, the general nervous tone or vital 
force of the body is derp^nged, the asso- 
ciated result is frequently abnormal pas- 
sion or weakened sexual functions. 

A great deal of literature has been 

written and circulated throughout the

garding the subject of sex. But such 
literature has greatly exaggerated the 
evils and the dangers connected with 
sexual health. Outside of specific germ

organs, and which, while serious, have 
been painted much darker than the facts 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 12S9 

justify, there is little excuse for all this 
horror and scare about sexual weakness 
and perversion. 

Sexual health, like mental or muscular 
health, is a matter of common sense and

culation (exercise), periect 
elimination of waste-products, and a suit- 
able distribution of both mental and phy- 
sical work will result in perfect nutrition. 
This means normal, wholesome body- 
fluids and body-cells. With these things 
gained, the sexual organs and sex-func- 
tion will have a fair opportunity for 
normal existence, and the matter of 
sexual health, and the consequent happi- 
ness which accompanies it, is then simply 
a matter of temperance, common decency, 
and self-control. 

EMBRYOLOGICAL GROWTH— PRENATAL CULTURE 

Upon the growth of the human em- 
bryo, or so-called prenatal culture, there 



1290 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

exists a great deal of popular super- 
stition, which is utterly groundless 
Superstition from the stand-point of 
7^ZTL. accurate science. The 
ture views that have been pro- 

mulgated regarding prenatal culture 
are for the main part harmless, and, 
for that matter, may be productive of 
good. 

The idea of the prenatal culturist is 

that the mental as well as the physical 

growth and development of 

Theory of pre- *= , ^ 

natal cuitur- the unbom child can be con- 
*'*^ trolled by the mother. The 

only ground for this belief is as follows: 
The child is nourished from the blood or 
nutritive fluid of the mother, with the 
result that the growth and the develop- 
ment of the child may be very readily 
influenced by the nutrition of the 
mother. 

The mental condition of the mother 
has an influence on the growth of the 
child, but it is indirect. All organs and 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1291 

functions of the liuman body are con- 
trolled by the nervous system, and if the 
nervous impulse be deranged 

Influence of ^ ^ ° ^ 

fright, anger. OF Weakened it may result in 
a serious impairment of 
nutrition. For this reason fright, anger, 
and other strong passions may result 
in lasting injury to the unborn child, 
but this injury is at most a matter 
of stunting or malnutrition, and cannot 
result in the voluntary mental life of 
the mother being transmitted to the 
child. 

As evidence of these assertions, I 
would call the reader's attention to the 

Mother's nu- fact that there is no ner- 

trition the only ,• i_ i 

factor in influ- ^ous conucction whatevcF 
encing her child bctwccn the cinbryo and the 
mother, but after the fertilization of the 
germ-cell, the only way in which the 
mother can influence the growth of the 
child is by the nutrition which her blood 
supplies to the growing tissue of the 
embryo. 



1292 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

As further proof of these statements, I 

will cite the investigations of Darwin in 

regard to the popular super- 
Birthmarks . . (i 1 • , 1 1 * . 
stition of birthmarks. At 

the instance of Mr. Darwin, some seven 
or eight hundred women of a London 
hospital were very carefully questioned 
before the birth of the child, as to any 
incidents which had happened that, ac- 
cording to popular notions, might result 
in birthmarks or deformities. In no 
instance was any incident given which 
resulted in the expected deformity; but 
the most interesting feature of the inves- 
tigation was that several women whose 
children were born with birthmarks re- 
called, upon seeing the deformity, some 
incident which seemed to give a possible 
explanation, thus showing to the mind 
of anyone familiar with psychology that 
the true explanation of all so-called re- 
markable incidents of birthmarks and of 
prenatal influence is merely one of super- 
stition or self-deception. 



ENCYCLOPEDLV OF DIET 1293 

HEREDITY 

How often we hear someone remark 
upon the wonders of heredity. People are 
astonished because John should look like 
John's father. As a matter of fact, the 
astonishment should come the other way. 
The child is but a continuation of the life 
of the parents. The cells from which the 
child develops have within them the 
power to grow and to produce individuals 
like the parents. This is wonderful, but 
it is only another form of the wonder of 
a willow twig growing into a willow tree 
when placed in moist earth. 

To the scientist, then, the wonder 

comes, not in the fact that the child 

wh the child ^esembles the parent, but in 

is not identical the f act that the child is not 

parents jJentical with the parent. 

Part of the explanation of this lack of 

identity, or, as it is known to science, 

variation, is due to the fact of sexual 

reproduction; that is, to the fact that 



1294 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

the child has two parents instead of 
one. 

The physiological process which takes 

place in the union of two reproductive 

cells is truly most wonderful. 

Microscopic ^ 

study of re- Of late ycars this has been 

productive cells g^^^.^^ UndcF pOWCrful mi- 

croscopes and has resulted in some very 
wonderful revelations of the mysteries 
of Nature. 

The nucleus (center of growth) of the 

parent cells contains little thread-like 

structures known as chro- 

Chromosoms 

in different mosoms. Thcsc cliromosoms 

species ^^^ considered to be the 

physical basis of heredity. In each 

species of animal there is a definite and a 

different number. 

When the sperm-cell unites with the 

female or germ-cell, these thread-like 

cliromosoms pair off and 

^^Z^LT "nite each chromosoiu with 

cnromosom 

the corresponding structure 
from the other cell. The combined 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1205 

structures then divide, and half of each 
chroniosoni is cast out of the cell-nucleus, 
and plays no part in the life of the future 
being; the other half is retained and 
divides as each new cell is formed. 

Thus we see that every part of the new 
individual is the result of the fusion or 
combination of the two parents. This 
explaiVis the variation of inheritance, and 
through this source must be traced all 
traits of heredity. After the original 
fusion of these microscopic physical ele- 
ments of heredity, the future develop- 
ment of the individual is wholly a matter 
of environment and nutrition. 

WHAT HEREDITY IS 

What heredity is and what it is not 

will now be considered in a practical way. 

It is clearly a matter of 

General char- ^ '' 

acteristics due heredity that a man is born 

to heredity ^ vi\2iW and not a moukcy. 

Likewise, it is clearly a matter of heredity 



1296 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

that distinguishes the various races of 
men. We could go farther and trace out 
and describe many of the physical dis- 
tinctions which mark families, and even 
individuals, such as general size of frame, 
form of countenance, color of hair and 
eyes, etc. 

Among mental traits we can safely 
ascribe to heredity only general distinc- 
characteris- tious. Intellectual parents 
Sbu^edTo" are more likely to give birth 
heredity to intellectual children than 

are parents whose natural mental facul- 
ties are less developed. There is also no 
doubt that certain natural characteristics 
of mind, such as quick temper, musical 
ability, etc., may be inherited. The be- 
lief, however, in the inheritance of many 
less distinct features, both physical and 
mental, is not well established by scien- 
tific investigation. Strength of muscle, 
control of the nervous system, suscepti- 
bility to, or freedom from dis-ease, etc., 
are more matters of nutrition and environ- 



ENTYriX)PEDIA OF DIET 1297 

ment than of inluTitance. The idea that 
consuniptioii, alcohohsin, etc., are in- 
herited, or that the education or training 
of parents along certain lines will result 
in children with faculties adapted to 
similar education, is not in accordance 
with scientific knowledge. 

SUMMARY OF FACTS REGARDING SEX AND 
HEREDITY 

1 The function of sex has been devel- 
oped in the process of evolution for the 
purpose of perpetuating life. 

2 The sexual functions are very closely 
related to the life of the individual, and 
can be normal only when the laws of 
nutrition and of general hygiene are 
observed. 

3 The idea of prenatal culture as 
commonly taught is a delusion; the only 
method that the mother can employ to 
control the growth of her unborn child 
is to live a wholesome, normal life, 



1298 ENXYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

physically and mentally, and thus supply 
her own body and that of the child with 
perfect material for the building of living 
cells. 

4 The powers of heredity are often 
overestimated, and many of the weak- 
nesses and disorders of life supposed to 
be inherent can be overcome by proper 
nutrition and environment. All life, 
w^hatever be the inherited tendencies, 
will be developed to the highest possible 
capacity by obeying the laws of indi\idual 
growth, for in the individual, as in the 
race. Nature is always striving to bring 
the products of her work to the highest 
degrees of perfection.

Throughout all nature we observe the 
phenomena of universal rhythm, mani-

forces in sucli as heat and cold, light

and destruction, etc. The human body 

is as much affected by this rhythm as is 

any other form of life.

work within us, one toward destruction

ties are "waste" and "repair," and we 
observe them as one of the distinct 
manifestations of the universal laws of 
growth, progress, and evolution. 

History moves in cycles. Even the 
life of nations depends somewhat upon 
this same principle of the interplay of the 
positive and negative forces of life. 

We see the same thing in the changes 

of the seasons upon the face of the earth.

trial machines are constantly tending 
toward their own disintegration and 
destruction. 

Every movement of the body, con-

Constant emotiou, use up some part

material. This constant change in the 
texture and the make-up of the body 
we call "metabolism," involving the 
functions of digestion, absorption, assimi- 
lation, and elimination. 

While we may regard the body as a 
machine, there are many points in which 



1304 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

the favorite comparison to a steam- 
engine is not exact. 

The inert metal composing the steam- 
engine has no power in itself, nor does 

Favorite com- pOWCF act tllFOUgh the dif- 

bodTwkh the ferent particles of metal, but 
steam-engine it is Controlled by the exter- 
nal application of force, which is the 
result of chemical changes caused by 
combustion in the fire-box. The metal 
of the engine has no part in the produc- 
tion of this energy. It does not need to 
take periods for rest, and if it were 
possible to supply it continually with 
water and fuel, it could run steadily from 
the time it w^as started until one or more 
of its essential parts were destroyed 
through friction. 

But the engineer and the fireman who 

drive the engine find it necessary to rest 

from their labors at certain 

lesT^^^^^ ^^^ intervals, not merely for fuel 

and water, but to prevent 

serious destruction of bodj^-tissue. This 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1305 

is true because man is compelled by 
hitherto unrecognized laws to give his 
body an opportunity, not only for read- 
justment in its composition, but also 
for the actual renewal of that power 
which animates him and makes him an 
intelligent, self-adjusting, and self -con- 
trolled being. 

THE OLD PHYSIOLOGY 

According to the teachings of the old 
physiology, our stomachs were fire-boxes 

of the human engine; food 
asai**e^ox ^^^ fucl, and the stomach 

was supposed to transform 
this fuel into work or energy by a process 
not entirely clear. Just as it is impossible 
for the lifeless iron and steel, within itself 
to transform coal and water into dy- 
namic power, and to apply that power to 
its own locomotion, so it is impossible 
and entirely incompatible with reason 
for mere muscular tissue of the body to 



1306 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

extract enough energy from the food we 

eat to perform the work necessary for 

that transformation itself, be- 

Phenomenon _ 

of rest and siclcs cnough moFc to cariy 
^^®®^ on all the functional activi- 

ties of the system, and at the- same time 
to do hundreds of foot-tons of physical 
labor. In this fact lies the key to some 
understanding of the phenomenon of rest 
and sleep. 

The old physiology was really never 
able to explain how it was possible for 
the digestive apparatus to extract, from 
the amount of food consumed, the enor- 
mous amount of energy which the aver- 
age person expends each day. 

REST AND RE-CREATION 

These terms are often confused. When 

one is engaged in some occupation or 

Chan e of activity other than his regu- 

occupation not lar vocatiou, it is commonlj'' 

re-creation ii]<' x' " T'l ' 

called re-creation. 1 his is 
a misconception, because it is merely a 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1307 

change in activity and must also be more 
or less destructive to other sets of nerves 
or muscular tissue. It is not in reality 
re-creation — it simply throws the life- 
power into a new channel, which is more 
responsive, and calls for less action from 
those parts of the mechanism which have 
been employed in the work from which 
one is seeking relief. It is for this reason 
that we find some pleasure in a new and 
different activity, though it, too, may be 
destructive to the human cell. 

One may alternate from one kind of 

activity to another indefinitely, which 

Specialization would bc better than 7io

not conducive chaugc, but the human 
to health mcclianism would finally give 

way under such violation of fundamental 
law. The mental worker may change, 
however, to any manual labor requiring 
little thought, and the physical worker to 
some form of mental labor, with far 
better effect. But, in our present civiliza- 
tion, specialization has become so far 



1308 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

advanced that the physical laborer is 
seldom qualified for mental work, and 
the mental worker has almost neglected 
manual training. 

True rest and re-creation is found in 
mental tranquility and sleep. 

SLEEP 

From observation and study of the 
state we call sleep, we notice that as night 
approaches and the activities of the day 
wear upon us, both the nervous and the 
muscular organisms relax, so that it 
becomes more and more difficult to 
maintain a positive and an active attitude 
of mind. There is a tendency toward 
cessation and rest, which gradually brings 
upon us that passive condition called 
sleep. 

In spite of the fatigue often experi- 
enced before we retire, we awake again 
on the morrow with renewed strength and 
power. From these and other reasons we 



ENCYCLOPEDLV OF DIET 1309 

are led to believe that during the hours 
of activity the body is constantly expend- 

Evidence of ing vital energy in both in- 
acquired en- ill.! 1 

ergy during temal and external work, 

sleep and that during the hours 

of sleep, through some unknown process, 
the body is charged with vital energy 
which is stored up and used gradually 
for carrying on the various functions and 
activities of the system. 

Just w^hat this energy is, just where it 

comes from, just how it is stored, just the 

manner in which it is dele- 

of'lnT/i*^^ gated to the body, we cannot 
say. We can only observe 
its workings, or effects, and formulate 
therefrom a theory. We are led to be- 
heve, however, that this energy is stored 
in the nervous organism, perhaps most 
largely in the brain, as brain tissue is the 
last to break down or waste away in sick- 
ness, ill health, dis-ease, or starvation, 
often maintaining its full weight up to the 
point of death. 



1310 ENCYCLOPEDLV OF DIET 

Even in sleep the expenditure of energy 

in the vital processes continues vigorously, 

depending upon conditions 

Vital processes _ ^ , 

expend energy immediately preceding sleep, 
dunng sleep |^^^ usuallv in a mucli more 

passive degree than in the waking hours. 
These activities, however, are no more 
pronounced in their constructive action 
or repair, than in ordinary periods of rest 
during the waking hours. 



SOME REASONS 

The processes of nutrition, alone, de- 
mand the expenditure of much energy. 
Food furnishes and the degree of energy 
orthVlota?" available from foods, even 
body-energy by perfect combustiou, would 
yield but a fraction of the energy ex- 
pended by the body. 

The average laborer in shoveling coal, 
swinging an axe or a pick, expends energ\' 
far in excess of the amount that could

possibly be obtained from his food. A 
day laborer may eat a pieee of beefsteak.

power.

cluding digestion, circulation, assimila- 
Reiation of tiou, and cxcFction consume 
pe'ndit'.^e"of eucrgj', and notwithstanding 
energy this wc are able to perform 

hundreds of foot-tons of labor a day 
besides; since we have found it possible 
to continue to live, and in some cases to 
even increase the amount of strength and 
work-power on a very limited diet; since 
it is a mathematical impossibility to pro- 
duce as much energy from the food con- 
sumed as the body expends, we are forced 
to the conclusion that we do not obtain 
all our energy from food. Therefore, 
from a careful analysis of the phenomenon 
of sleep, we conclude that it is very 
closely connected with this mystery. 

OXIDATION AND AIR 

One of the most important of the vital 
functions is breathing. Physiologists, 
teachers, and lecturers continually remind 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1313 
us of the comparative time we could 

Relative im- live witllOUt foocl OF WatCF, 

TiToVL and the remarkably short 
water time we could live if entirely 

deprived of air. 

Oxygen is vitally necessary for the 
purpose of purifying the blood and sup- 
Oxygen not the plying the vaHous tissues 
:Z":^T and fluids in the body, of 
breathing whicli oxygen forms an im- 
portant constituent. However, oxygen 
is not the only necessary element which is 
utilized by the system in the process of 
breathing, as human beings die imme- 
diately upon being placed in a receptacle 
of undiluted oxygen. Just what this 
other factor is, science has not clearly 
defined, but that it is concerned with 
rest and sleep we have at least uncon- 
sciously recognized, as shown by our 
often referring to periods of rest as 
"breathing spells"; from the fact that 
we have found it of great importance to 
keep the air we are breathing moving 



1314 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

constantly about us, especially while 
asleep. From all these facts we are forced 
to believe that sleep plays an important 
part in producing and maintaining body- 
energy, besides constantly recharging the 
system with oxygen.

LESSON XXII 

A Lesson For Business Men 

That which tends to make a good busi-

estabHshment of great industries and 
enterprises, coupled with accumulation 
of money by the individual. 

A careful review of the history of 
business men who have made a success 
along these lines shows that the majority 
of them sacrijBced their health and their 
hves to their business. In the last and 
final analysis, therefore, these were not 
good business men. 

The best musician is he who can bring 
more sounds into harmony. The best 
artist is he who can best harmonize colors 
and reproduce nature. Likewise, the 
best business man is he who can best 
harmonize or balance the affairs under 
his control. isi? 



1318 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Health being entirely under and within 
his control, if he disregards it — gives it 
no thought — violates the laws that gov- 
ern it, and finally wrecks it, he is not a 
good business man, as all business de- 
pends upon the power of the individual, 
and the powers of the individual depend 
upon his health.

A GOOD BUSINESS MAN 

A good business man is the man who 
can direct the wheels of industry, who 
can draw a trial balance between his

income and his expenses, and who can 
measure liis own abihty on the yardstick

He is a good business man who gives

Eat a very light breakfast an hour

coffee, white bread and meat. 

Walk to your business, if possible; 
breathe deeply. 

Eliminate woolen underwear; dress 
as lightly as possible. 

Take an hour for luncheon. Omit 
tea, coffee, tobacco, beer, and 
sweets. 

Keep your office well ventilated. 

Secure competent help and trust 

them. 
Love some one or some thing — a 

dog will do. 
Leave your office early enough to 

walk home, or at least a part of 

the way. 
Masticate your food infinitely fine, 

and by all means do not overeat. 

This is the crowning sin of tlie 

civilized table. 



1326 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Take from ten to fifteen minutes' exer- 
cise before retiring; sleep in a cold, 
thoroughly ventilated room. Spend as 
much time as possible in the sunshine 
and open air. Drive an automobile, play 
golf, join a gymnasium, dance, sing, kick 
and play with the boys, for it is infinitely 
better to dig in the ditch for your dinner 
and be able to digest and enjoy it, than 
to lie invalid in your self-made prison, 
and perhaps die. (Probably if the truth 
were written on your tombstone, it would 
read: 

There was a fool who made a fortune, but he died; 
The world called him great, but it lied.)

EXERCISE 

Every viorning, jual aflcr arising, take 

a jcup nf water, and go through the 

folloioing deep breathing exercises: 



'^^^■^^: 






^ 



EXERCISE No. 1 

Stand I'lcct, feet about 30 inches 
apart, extend arms above head, clasj)- 
ing hands and holding elbows rigid, 
inhale deeply. Bend toward the left 
and try to touch the floor with the 
clasped hands as far from the foot and 
to the rear as poesible. Exhale while 
returning to position. Inhale deejily 
reversing motion to the right. This 
movement should be repeated about 
24 times. 



EXERCISE No. 2 









h;r)j"l< 




Rest the body 
upon tips of toes 
and the palms of 
the hands. Move i/ 
the body up and 
down as far as po.s- 
sible, bending only 
at the waist line. 
If this position is too strenuous the tension can be reduced by 
resting on the elbows, knees, or both, while executing the move- 
ment. Inhale deeply while taking this exercise, and exhaust the 
breath suddenly, as if coughinti, with the downward motion. This 
movement should be repeated about 12 times.

Rest the hands on the rim of a bathtub or on two chairs 
placed about 2 feet apart. A.%ume position shown by cirt.--' 
Lower the body until chest touches the knee; rise, bringing th« 
other knee under the chest, repeating the njovement. Execute 
this movement rapidly as if running, rising first on one foot and 
then on the other, from 50 to 100 times. 

If sufficiently strong, this can be taken without support for 
the hands. This exercise is especially recommended for those 
suffering from constipation.

However, our complex industrial organ-

the very time we are beginning to change 
the body from the youth to the adult, 
and the responsibilities with which w^e are

the majority from giving attention to and 
maintaining a system of development 

1329 



1330 ENCYCLOPEDLV OF DIET 

exercises which is so vitally important, 
and which would provide a great store- 
house of energy to be drawn upon in after 
years. Inasmuch, therefore, as the con- 
ditions under which we exist prevent the 
free play of our instincts, and the exercise 
of our natural desire for certain kinds of 
play or motion, it becomes necessary for 
us to devise a method of overcoming the 
repressing influences that crush out the 
play instinct of civilized man. 

CONSTRUCTIVE EXERCISES 

Constructive exercises should be taken 
and practised regularly between the ages 

Constructive of fifteen and twenty-five. 

r«l:e?u It is largely duriug this 

to 25 period that the physical con- 

dition of the body for the balance of life 
is determined.

Nature with a sound physical body and

purifying the to kccp it jiurified by 
obeying tlie laws of motion 
and of oxidation. Constructive exercises 
should employ every muscle in the body 
long enough once in every twenty-four 
hours to generate sufficient heat to cause 
perspiration, or at least to force twice the 
normal quantity of blood to the lungs for 
purification. Exercise thus taken up to 
the point of fatigue, and of sufficient 
duration to use all the nutrition taken 
in the form of food, will, under favorable 
conditions, build the body to its highest 
degree of physical strength, provided we 
keep Nature supplied with the right kind 
of material (food) with which to do her 
work. 

EXERCISE FOR REPAIR 

After the body has reached maturity, 
or attained its full growth, the only exer- 



1332 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

cise needed is for repair. This it must 
^ ... have or Nature will inflict 

In mature life 

exercise only her inexorable sentence in 
for repair gome form of congcstiou. 
In various industrial and professional 
pursuits the legs, neck, and arms are used 
Why the cuough to kccp them in a 

*'*™'f . "' fair state of repair. That 

quires exer- r 

cise part of the body, therefore, 

that suffers most for want of motion, or 
exercise, is the trunk. In this part of the 
anatomy are located the vital organs con- 
trolling not only the circulation and the 
oxidation of blood, but also those organs 
upon whose normal action depend solely 
the questions of digestion, assimilation 
of food, and elimination of waste. 

If the food is selected, combined, and 
proportioned so as to pro- 

If properly s- r- ^ x- 

nourished the duccchcmical liarmouy in the 
l^ol^^^'^.Jltli^ stomach, and to meet the re-

ure of environment, and work, 
the body will be kept sufficiently charged 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1333 

with energj' to demand a certain amount 
of exercise. If the command is obeyed 
the body can be trained to work auto- 
matically, as it were, but where the voca- 
tion is sedative, or prevents obedience 
to these demands, the trunk should be 
exercised in the open air from thirty to 
forty minutes daily by flexing, tensing, 
twisting and bending in every possible 
way, long enough and rapidly enough 
to double the normal heart action and 
inhalations of air. 

PHYSIOLOGY OF EXERCISE 

By motion (exercise) the muscles are 

stimulated in growth, becoming larger 

Necessity of and morc firm, thus giving 

^od^°deveiop- Strength and symmetry to 

ment the body. Food, without 

proper motion, will not develop muscular 

tissue to its highest degree. Exercise 

must be taken to stimulate the growth 

of the tissues forming the muscle-cells. 



1334 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Among the benefits derived from exer- 
cise, the following may be noted : 

First: Surplus nitrogen is usually cast 

from the body as waste matter when it is 

not deposited as muscle- 
Growth pro- ^ '^ 

duced by exer- tissuc by proper cxcrcise. If 
"^® the diet is balanced, regular 

exercise will add this nitrogenous sub- 
stance to the muscle-cells far beyond 
normal growth, thus causing an actual 
increase in the size and the number of 
fibres. 

Second: A second benefit derived from 

muscle activity is the consequent change 

„ . _, that occurs in brain and in 

Brain and 

nerve force ncrvc activity. There are 
increase certain cells in the brain and 

in the nervous system which control the 
movements of the muscles. When these 
cells are not used, they degenerate, but 
their use in exercise is not only beneficial 
in developing a well-rounded nervous 
mechanism, but also in strengthening the 
brain-cells that are used in intellectual 
work. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 133J 

Tliird: A third and perhaps most im- 
portant of all the benetils to be derived 
from exercise is the general 
Ji!,°'!«!!l*i"c'rH increase in the circulation 

aon increased 

of the blood. The nmscles 
form a larger i)roportion of the body- 
weight than any other group of organs. 
When general exercise involving the larger 
muscles is participated in, the demand for 
food material in this particular muscular 
tissue is so great as to cause a notable 
increase in the strength and in the rapid- 
ity of the heart beat, and consequent deep 
breathing. This acceleration of the circu- 
lation continues long after the exercise 
has ceased, thus replenishing and building 
up the muscles. As a result of the better 
circulation of the blood, all organs receive 
an increased blood-supply, and every 
part of the body shares in the general 
improvement. This explains why one 
can do better brain work, or digest food 
with greater ease after taking moderate 
exercise. 



133G ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Exercise is constructive up to the 

point of fatigue, but beyond that point 

^ ., ^ , it is destructive. The waste- 

Evil effect of 

long-continued products of all cell-mctabol- 
exercise ^^^ ^^^ harmful and poison- 

ous. When exercise is long continued, 
the waste matter accumulating therefrom 
weakens or poisons the cells that secrete 
them. 

The products of cell-metabolism are 

of two classes, and each class has different 

effects. The first is due to 

Different 

forms of ex- oxidatiou. A Tunncr, who 
haustion ^^jjg exhausted from short- 

ness of breath, has simply been suffocated 
by the excess of carbon dioxid in his 
muscles. After the breath is regained, 
or, in other words, after the body has 
had time to throw off the carbon dioxid, 
the runner is in nearly as good condition 
as before. A more lasting and serious 
form of exhaustion is due to the ac- 
cumulation of nitrogenous decomposition 
products, which, not being in a gaseous 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1337 

form, cannot he thrown off from the 
lungs, and licnce are not as rapidly or as 
easily removed from the tissues. The 
presence in the tissue of these waste- 
products is the cause of extreme weakness 
and fatigue. 

The well-trained muscles contain only 

healthy protoplasm, and give off but a

half a mile, or play a simple game of ball, 
and the following day the muscles will 
be stiff and sore; this unusual exertion 
has caused the breaking down of much 
loosely organized tissue which could have 
been made firm and healthy by daily 
muscular activity.

body-waste go^}^ ^hc productiou and the 
accumulation of waste matter depend 
very largely upon the diet. All animal 
flesh (food) is undergoing gradual de- 
composition, and adds its waste matter 
to that of the body, therefore meat eaters 
require a much greater amount of exer- 
cise to maintain a given standard of 
blood-purity than do vegetarians. 



SYSTEMS OF PHYSICAL CULTURE 

Numerous schools of physical culture 
and artificial methods of exercise have 
flourished in all civilized countries within 
the past few years. This fact emphasizes 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET irso 

the pressing need for a general change in 
our metliods of living. 

The various systems of indoor exercise 
popularly taught are at the best weak 
substitutes for the more natural and 
wholesome forms of combined exercise 
and re-creation found in outdoor life and 
outdoor sport. Some of the methods 
referred to are as follows : 

Tensing, which consists of slow move- 
ments in which opposite muscles are 
made to pull against each 
other. The student can 
easily grasp the principle involved in this 
system, and from his own ingenuity 
extend it as fully as he desires. 

Vibratory exercises, which are some- 
what similar to the tensing system; 
however, instead of slow 

Vibratory ■ .1 

exercises movements, the arms or 

other portions of the body 
are moved with a rapidly vibrating mo- 
tion. The effect produced is essentially 
the same as in the tensing system. 



1340 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Heavy-weight exercises, consisting in 

the use of heavy dumb-bells or other 

apparatus in which the actual 

Heavy-weight j^ysical puU excrted by the 

exercises i' J i ./ 

body in moving the weights 
is sufficient to try the muscles to their 
maximum capacity. This system of ex- 
ercise should be discouraged ; while it may 
add to the mere lifting strength, it takes 
from the muscles their flexibility, and from 
the body its agile and supple activity. 

Indoor exercise with light apparatus 

such as wooden dumb-bells, Indian clubs, 

wands, Swedish and Del- 

indoor exer- ^^^^^^ movemcnts. Thcsc 

cises 

forms of exercise, which com- 
pose most physical culture drills, as given 
in schools and gymnasiums, are to be 
highly recommended. For adults, how- 
ever, such exercises require considerable 
indulgence in order to gain much physical 
benefit therefrom. 

Exercises of this nature are especially 
well adapted to school children. They 



ENCYCLOPEDLV OF DIET 1341 
. , depend upon the rhythm of 

Exercise for ^ * " 

school the music, the good fellow- 

childreo i • e l_^ • 

ship ot their companions, 
and the pride of keeping up with the class 
to make them interesting. For this rea- 
son they are not suitable to the individual 
who must exercise alone in his room. 
Dancing can well be considered in this 
class, and could be highly recommended 

as an important exercise and 

Dancing as an , • •, ,

with the added advantages of fresh air.

Exercise for ^ '' , 

the city door cxerciscs are too diflS- 

*^^'"" cult to be practised with 

sufficient regularity to bring the desired 
results; therefore, it is best to adopt some 
definite daily program of vigorous muscu- 
lar exercise which will keep the body in 
fair physical condition. Exercises of 
this kind should be made a regular daily 
habit, and though at times a little tire- 
some, can, by practise, be made to become 
the expected thing, so that the day will 
not seem complete until the daily exer- 
cises have been taken. 

From long experience I have found 

that the following exercises give the 

greatest benefits with the 

Exercises giv- *=" 

ing the best least expenditure of time and 
'""''' labor. They are all especi- 

ally designed to promote healthy action

which are so much neglected by the 
average person. 

PROGRAM FOR DAILY EXERCISE 

Every morning, just after rising, and 
every night, just before retiring, take a 
glass or two of pure cool water and exe- 
cute vigorously the following movements: 

EXERCISE NO. 1 

Exercise No. 1 — Stand erect, feet 
about thirty inches apart. Extend arms 
above head; clasp the hands; hold 
elbows rigid, and inhale deeply. Bend 
toward the left and try to touch the floor 
with the clasped hands, as far from the 
foot, and as far to the rear as possible. 
Exhale while returning to position. In- 
hale deeply, reversing motion to the 
right. This movement should be re- 
peated from 25 to 50 times. 



1344 ENCYCLOPEDL\ OF DIET 

EXERCISE NO. 2 

Exercise No. 2 — Rest upon the tips 
of the toes and the palms of the hands. 
Move the body up and down as far as 
possible, bending only at the waist line. 
If the movement is too difficult in this 
position, the tension may be reduced by 
resting on the elbows, or on the knees, 
or on both. Inhale deeply, and exhaust 
the breath suddenly as if coughing, with 
the downward motion. This movement 
should be repeated from 20 to 30 times. 

EXERCISE NO. 3 

Exercise No. 3 — Rest the hands on 
the rim of a bathtub, or on two chairs 
placed about two feet apart. Assume 
position shown in cut. Lower the body 
until the chest touches the right knee; 
rise, and lower the body until the chest 
touches the left knee. Execute this 
movement rapidly as if running, rising 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1345 

first on one foot and then on the other, 
swinging the body from side to side with 
each step or movement. 

This exercise is especially recommended 
for those suffering from torpidity of the 
liver, or from constipation. It should be 
executed from 100 to 500 times. 

EXERCISE NO. 4 

Exercise No. 4 — Stand erect, feet 
about thirty inches apart. Inhale deeply, 
and strike a blow toward the left with 
the right fist, passing the left fist behind 
the back. Alternate this movement, 
striking toward the right with the left 
fist, giving the body a swinging and 
twisting movement. 

EXERCISE NO. 5 

Exercise No. 5 — Stand erect, feet 
about thirty inches apart, hands clasped 
overhead, elbows rigid; inhale deeply. 



1346 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Bend toward the left, describing a com- 
plete circle with the clasped hands. 
Exhale w^hen erect. Reverse; describing 
a circle in the opposite direction com- 
pletes the movement. This exercise 
should be executed from 25 to 50 times. 

RE-CREATION 

The small boy who described work as 

"anything you don't want to do," and 

-., play as "anything you do 

Idleness con- f^ t/ i/ . . 

trary to nat- waut to do," had in his mind 
"' *^ the fragment of a great truth. 

True re-creation should afford Diver- 
sion, Entertainment, and Work. The 
average business man who is threatened 
with a breakdown, and who goes awaj" 
for a rest, should in reality go to work, 
but it should be a different kind of work 
from his routine duties. No one was 
ever benefited by idleness; it is contrary 
to nature — contrary to the universal laws 
of construction which govern all forms

nutrition, to eliminate more poison and 
waste, and to increase and normalize the 
peristaltic activity of the intestinal tract. 
The business man who likes to hunt 
and to kill innocent animals; who runs, 
walks, and thinks, and per- 
^Tfishing spires in the effort, is taking 
a good kind of re-creation — 
perhaps the best he knows; but the fat 
man who sits in a boat all day and catches 
fish that he cannot use, or slays a cart- 
load of ducks that he has deceived with a 
decoy, has received neither benefit nor 
re-creation; he has only yielded to his 
primeval instincts to secure his food by 
slaughter and has been merely enter- 
tained — probably debased. 



1348 ENCYCLOPEDU OF DIET 

True re-creation for the mental worker 

is manual work — labor in the open 

air that requires but httle 

Truere-crea- ^hought. Every busiueSS 

man who values the sacred 
heritage of health, should provide himself 
with a place where he can go one day out 
of each week and chop wood, prepare soil, 
plant or harvest something, get close to 
Mother Nature, and receive the blessings 
of her life-giving sun by day, and rest in 
her open arms at night. Men are but 
TTr .V, u biff children, and, like the 

Worthless ob- ^

men struggle j^^. ^^^ ^^|^^^jg bcCaUSC it 

reflects the prismatic colors of the sun, 
most of the things for which they struggle 
are equally as worthless and deceptive. 

Mental supremacy, which means the 
keenest sense of love, justice, and mercy. 

The triad of ^^^^ great triad of all thai 

all that is best is bcst in man, is all that 

really pays. If, at the close 

of every life, the question, "What has 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET VMO 

brought most happiness?" could be an- 
swered, it would be, "The Gratitude 
OF MY Fellow Men." The average busi- 
ness pursuit is not conducive to this end. 
It is unfortunate that commercial and 
financial success are too often secured 
by methods that produce just the oppo- 
site results, therefore the whole life-work 
of the average man is really reduced to 
no higher object than that of securing 
food and shelter, which is the primitive 
occupation of the lowest forms of life. 

One day in the week spent close to the 
soil with gentle cows and horses, affec- 
tionate cats and admiring

grind," and one night every 
week spent in thought and reflection 
under the wilderness of w^orlds that whirl 
through the abyss of space, will sharpen 
the senses of love, justice, and mercy, 
give true diversion, true entertainment, 
true work, and true rest.

FOODS OF VEGETABLE ORIGIN 



LESSON VIII 

Foods of Vegetable Origin 



GRAINS 

Grains constitute the most important 
article of human food, not so much on 
account of their superior nutritive, cura- 
tive or remedial value, but chiefly because 
of their prolific growth and abundant 
production in all civilized countries 
throughout the world. 

The variety of grain produced in the 
various countries depends largely upon 
the climate and the habits of the people. 

The predominant use of rice by the 
Asiatics, wheat by the Europeans, and 
maize by the aboriginal American, shows 
how people adapt themselves to the foods 
of prodigal growth. It also shows the 



290 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

effect different foods have upon the physi- 
cal development of the various tribes that 
inhabit these remote countries. 

Wheat is said by some writers to be a 
complete food. This is not strictly true. 
Wheat contains a very small 
percentage of fat, and while 
fat can be made in the body from carbo- 
hydrates, it is more natural, and entails 
less work upon the digestive organs and 
the liver if the diet is balanced so as to 
contain the required amount of fat, and 
all other nutritive elements in the right 
or natural proportions. 

A diet composed of wheat alone would 
contain 70 per cent of carbohydrates.

ing too much While this would be per- 
starch fectly wholcsomc, it would 

give the body an excess of starch which 
would ultimately result in intestinal con- 
gestion, gout, rheumatism, hardening of 
the arteries, and premature old age. 
Wheat contains a larger quantity, and a 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 291 

greater variety of proteids than any other 
grain, but wheat proteids are more diffi- 
cult to digest than the proteids of milk, 
eggs, or nuts. 

Wheat varies greatly in composition, 

according to the soil and the climate in 

which it is produced. This 

of°wheaf°° ^^^^ ^^ ^^^ recognized or 
considered by the average 
writer on dietetics, who eulogizes wheat 
as the wonderful "staff of life," because 
certain food tables show that wheat con- 
tains 13 per cent, while corn contains 
only 10 per cent of proteids. It is neither 
the proteid nor the carbohydrate content 
that determines the value of any grain as 
food, but rather the proportions of the 
different elements of nutrition it contains, 
that being the best which is more nearly 
balanced to meet the requirements of the 
human organism. 

Rye may be considered in the same 
class as wheat. Chemically, the contents 
are very similar, and the effects upon the 



292 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

body are very much the same. It con- 
tains a larger per cent of cellulose, and 
less gluten than wheat, there- 
fore as a remedial food it is 
superior to all other grains for exciting 
intestinal peristalsis, thereby removing 
the causes of constipation. 

The nutritive elements of barley are 
similar to those of wheat and rye. It 
contains less cellulose fiber, 
and therefore a larger per 
cent of digestible nutrients than any one 
of the cereal group except rice. It has 
never become popular as a bread-making 
grain because — 

1 The nitrogenous or gluten sub- 

stances are not tenacious 
enough to make the conven- 
tional "raised" bread 

2 The flour is dark in color 

3 The grain is so hard and "flinty" 

that it is very difficult to mill 
it down to the required fine- 
ness 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 293 

For these reasons barley has been greatly 
neglected as a food commodity. From a 
chemical standpoint it deserves a much 
higher place in our dietaries than it has 
hitherto been given. 

The composition of oats varies some- 
what from that of wheat, rye and barley. 
They contain a larger pro- 
portion of both fat and pro- 
teids, and form a desirable food if cor- 
rectly prepared. The objection to oats 
as an article of diet is the hasty manner 
in which they are usually prepared, which 
converts them into a gummy mass of 
gelatinized starch, entangled with the 
peculiar gummy proteid of the oat grain. 
Thus prepared the oat is a most prolific 
source of disturbed digestion. 

Corn is the cheapest material capable 

of nourishing the human body that is 

produced in the temperate 

zone. It is less digestible, 

and more deficient in the salts than the 

group of grains thus far mentioned. 



294 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

It is very wholesome, however, but in no 
way superior to other grains. In the 
future corn will probably play an increas- 
ing part in the problem of feeding the 
world, as a cheap source of carbohydrates, 
and for the purpose of manufacturing 
glucose. 

In all tropical and semi-tropical coun- 
tries rice occupies the same position that 
corn does in the temperate 
zone. It is more deficient 
in proteids and in fat than any other food 
grain, while the starch of rice is more 
easily digested than any other form of 
cereal starch. This grain, however, is 
almost entirely devoid of mineral con- 
stituents, and for this reason it is produc- 
tive of serious nutritive derangements 
when indulged in too freely. This defi- 
ciency can be overcome by taking a 
liberal quantity of green salads, or fresh 
vegetables, whenever rice is eaten. 

Buckwheat is a grain whose consump- 
tion is very limited, owing to the fact 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 295 

that it is dark in color. It compares 
favorably with wheat and 

Buckwheat ... 

corn as to nutritive ele- 
ments, and is now much used as a winter 
food by the northern people. 

USES OF GRAINS 

The use of grains as an article of 
food may be considered under three 
headings : 

1 As a source of energy 

2 As a source of nitrogen 

3 Grain as a remedial food; that 

is, as a source of cellulose or 
roughness, for the regulation 
of intestinal action 

(1) GRAIN AS A SOURCE OF ENERGY 

All grains are composed largely of 
starch, therefore the question of energy 



296 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

to be derived from this source is one of 

assimilation and use. The use of grains 

_ . in the diet deserves the most 

Too much 

grain con- caref ul Consideration, and the 
sumed study should not be confined 

to any particular grain, but to the entire 
group, and especially to the method of 
preparation, and the quantity that should 
be consumed under the varying conditions 
of age, temperature of environment, and 
work or activity. The conventional 
American diet contains such an abnormal 
quantity of grain-starch, and the methods 
of preparation are so unnatural, that the 
Food Scientist, in practise, will find many 
people whose digestive organs have be- 
come so deranged that he may deem it 
necessary to prohibit grain-starch almost 
entirely. 

The grown person, pursuing the ordin- 
ary sedative occupation, should not eat 
more than three or four ounces of cereal 
food a day, while the manual laborer 
should not consume more than five or 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 297 

six ounces each twenty-four hours. This 
quantity contemplates cool, or winter 
weather. In summer this quantity 
should be reduced according to work or 
activity. 

(2) GRAIN AS A SOURCE OF NITROGEN 

Grain as a source of proteid has received 
undue consideration in hygienic works. 
Upon an allowance of one-fourth of a 
pound of grain per day, which would 
make four vienos, with a nitrogen factor 
of six, we see that 24 decigrams of nitro- 
gen would be supplied from the grain. 
The variations between the proteids con- 
tained in two varieties of breakfast food 
is seldom more than two or three per cent. 
This would amount to a variation in the 
daily intake of nitrogen of about five 
decigrams, an amount too little to be 
worth consideration. 

Grain proteids are not so easily di- 
gested as are the proteids of eggs, milk 



298 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

and nuts. The following list of grains

(3) GRAIN AS A REMEDIAL FOOD 

Grain is constipating or laxative in 
effect according to the way it is prepared 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 299 

and eaten. Whole grain, especially wheat 

and rye, will normalize intestinal action, 

_ .. , , and in some cases act as a 

Remedial val- 
ue of the laxative, while the same 

whole grain ^^^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ g^^^.^ 

and milled in the usual way, are consti- 
pating. Ordinary wheat bran is one of 
the most effective remedies known for 
intestinal congestion, and it can be 
administered or regulated with much 
accuracy, according to the severity of the 
case. An intelligent understanding of the 
use of bran in treating constipation is 
quite necessary. The object should be 
to employ bran as a remedy in chronic 
cases, and to vary the quantity, the 
quality, and the cellulose content of the 
meals. In rare cases, bran may produce 
Wheat bran a irritation; in such cases it

stipation hours, and eaten only with 

hot water. In other cases the mechanical 
stimulation of the peristaltic action is not 
effective. The practitioner can usually 



300 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

determine these questions on the third or 
the fourth day. 

Bran should be administered about as 
follows: In cases of severe constipation, 
one rounding tablespoonful in water, just 
after rising; one-half teacupful, cooked, 
taken at each meal, and a heaping table- 
spoonful in water just before retiring. 

The following table gives, in the order 
of their laxative effects, a few of the 
principal grains: 

1 Flaked or whole rye 

2 Flaked or whole wheat 

3 Flaked or whole barley 

4 Flaked or whole oats 

NUTS 

The true nut is the seed of trees and 
shrubs which stores the greater propor- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 301 

tion of food material for nourishing the 

seedhng in the form of vegetable oil. The 

nut is very largely a fuel 

froducers'^* food or heat produccr, there- 
fore among the primitive 
races, along the warmer belts of the 
earth's surface, the nut was not of so 
much importance, but in the northern 
or colder countries, where the body-heat 
meets with such powerful resistance from 
climatic environment, the nut is of equal, 
if not of more importance than fruits. 

There are a few miscellaneous articles 
of food that are classed as nuts, which 
do not belong primarily to this group. 

In the following discussion I will take 
up the several varieties of nuts in the order 
of their general value as articles of human 
nutrition : 

There are several species of pine seeds 

from many varieties of trees, and from 

many different countries. 

The Italian pine seed or nut, 

called in Italy *'Pignon," and in this 



302 ENCYCLOPEDL\ OF DIET 

country "Pignolia," is the refined or 
cleansed nut, called by the writer "pro- 
toid" nut. This is a coined word given 
to it because it contains the highest 
percentage of protein of any other food 
that has yet been analyzed. The "pro- 
toid" nut contains 34 per cent protein, 
47 per cent oil, 9 per cent carbohydrates, 
4 per cent ash, and 6 per cent water. 
The relative proportion of nitrogen to 

Composition f^^^^^ ^^ ^""^ ^^ g^^at aS 

of the pine in some other food products, 
such as eggs, or skimmed 
milk. These contain a large per cent 
of w^ater, so that the protoid nut, while 
containing pound for pound more nitro- 
gen than any other known food, has a 
lower nitrogen factor than foods which 
do not contain so large a percentage of 
fat. This same rule will 
f^actorin°nuTs ^Pply to all uuts. They are 
rich in protein, but because 
of the large amount of fat which supplies 
energy in its most condensed form, the 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 303 

nitrogen factor, which is the relation 
between nitrogen and energy, is often 
lower in many nuts than in grain. The 
chief advantage of protoid nuts over 
other varieties is in their softness, conse- 
quently they are more digestible, and 
more assimilable than any other specimen 
of the nut family. 

The pine nuts which grow prodigally 
in the western part of the United States 
are not so rich in protein as the protoid 
nuts, but in other respects are very ex- 
cellent food. The annual crop of these 
is about one million pounds, but is 
variable, a full crop being produced only 
about every third year. They are har- 
vested in a very crude way, chiefly by 
Indians, from the remote districts of 
New Mexico, Utah and California. 

The almond is a most desirable food. 

It contains 17 per cent nitrogen, and 54 

per cent fat. The flavor is 

very agreeable, and the nuts, 

in digestibility, rank next to protoid nuts. 



304 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

They may be substituted for each other 
in many dietaries. 

The pecan, which is a species of hickory- 
nut, contains 13 per cent protein, and 
70 per cent fat. It is a very 
dehcious article of food, 
though somewhat inferior to pine nuts 
and almonds, in digestibihty, and as a 
source of nitrogen. 

Brazil-nuts contain 18 per cent protein 

and 66 per cent fat, and rank high as 

an article of body-heat and 

Brazil-nuts 

energy. 
Soft-shelled or white walnuts are com- 
monly known as "English walnuts," 
though they are chiefly 

White walnuts ='._,'' i • ^ i- 

grown in r ranee and m Can- 
fornia. These nuts contain 24 per cent 
protein, 63 per cent fat, and form one 
of the staple nut foods of both Europe 
and America. 

Filberts or hazelnuts contain 15 per 
cent protein, and 65 per cent fat. They 
differ widely from the varieties hitherto 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 305 

named, and are less digestible. They 
should be masticated exceed- 
ingly fine, and should not 
be taken by one whose digestion is par- 
ticularly weak. 

Butternuts are a species of walnut. 

They contain 27 per cent protein, 61 

per cent fat, and rank in the 

dietary along with English 

walnuts and Brazil-nuts. 

Beechnuts contain 22 per cent protein 

and 57 per cent fat. Owing to the diflS- 

culty of gathering or har- 

Beechnuts ,. , . , 

vestmg, these nuts have 
never become popular as an article of 
human food. They are in the grain 
class, therefore rank high as an energy- 
producing material. 

The cocoanut is a product of the palm 
tree, and, while quite distinct from our 
nuts of the temperate cli- 
mate, is a very valuable and 
abundant food, deserving more extended 
use. Cocoanut is about one-half fat. 



306 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

contains 6 per cent protein and 28 per 
cent carbohydrates. The milk of the 
cocoanut is an excellent article of food, 
and used by the natives in the tropics in 
many remedial and medicinal ways. 

PEANUTS 

Peanuts, which are so widelj^ used as 
food, are on the boundary line between 

Value of ^^^^ ^^^ legumes. They 

pea-nuts and wcrc classcd as pcas by some 
soy-beans ^£ ^j^^ early botauists, and 

as nuts by others. The name indicates 
the compromise that was made between 
the two theories. Another legume, which 
is largely used in Japan and China is the 
soy-bean. Both the peanut and the soy- 
bean are better balanced, and more 
nutritious than common beans and peas. 
They are similar in composition, and con- 
tain about equal quantities of protein 
and fat, some peanuts yielding as much 
as 48 or 50 per cent oil. Neither are 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 307 

palatable in their natural state, but both 
are very delicious when their starch 
content is converted into dextrin by 
roasting. The Japanese have a method 
of preparing the soy-bean by a process of 
fermenting, which renders the proteid 
material very digestible. Soy-beans have 
not yet been introduced into this country, 
hence there will be little opportunity 
to use them, and they will, therefore, not 
be discussed here at length. 

LEGUMES 

Legumes are the seeds of a certain 
group of plants grown in pods. The term 
comes from a very ancient word, "legere," 
meaning to gather. Beans and peas are 
the most familiar types of this group. 

Legumes are rich in nitrogen, and some 

varieties are also very rich in oil. They 

are not equal to nuts in fuel 

fn StTo'gef" or food value, however, be- 

cause in the natural state 

they are hard, somewhat indigestible, and 



308 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

unpalatable. These qualities are due to 
the fact that the nitrogenous material 
of legumes are radically different from 
the nitrogen found in nuts, and belong 
to a class not so desirable as food. Meat 
may be omitted from the diet and legumes 
adopted as the chief source of nitrogen, 
but this change requires some knowledge 
and careful feeding in the beginning. 
Meat is digested wholly in the stomach 
and does not require mastication (only 
enough to be swallowed), while dried 
or mature legumes require much masti- 
cation, owing to the carbohydrates they 
contain. The best form in which legumes 
can be taken is in their green or imma- 
ture state, owing to the fact that the 
immature starch they contain is readily 
soluble, while mature legume starch is 
rather difficult to digest. 

FRUITS 

The term "fruit" in a strictly botanical 
sense includes a very wide range of vege- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 309 

table articles — the reproductive product 
of trees, or other plants, such as grains, 
legumes, nuts, berries, apples, peaches, 
plums, etc. In this lesson, however, I will 
apply the popular meaning to the term. 
The common succulent or juicy fruits, 
including both tree fruits and berries, 

General com- ^^^^ many properties in com- 
position of mon. The chemical compo- 
^""* sition of these typical fruits 

consists of from 80 to 85 per cent water, 
5 to 15 per cent sugar, 1 to 5 per cent 
organic or fruit-acids, and small quanti- 
ties of protein, cellulose, and the numer- 
ous salts, a portion of which may be 
combined with the fruit-acids. Some 
unripe fruits contain starch and various 
other carbohydrate substances, many of 
which are distasteful and unwholesome. 
On the other hand, when fruits become 
over-ripe, and decay sets in, the sugar 
is changed into carbon dioxid, alcohol, 
and acetic acid, and the fruit rapidly 
deteriorates in nutritive value and un- 



310 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

wholesomeness. These changes, together 
with the loss of water, account for the 
sponginess and the tastelessness of cold 
storage and other long-kept fruits. All 
varieties of fruit are best when they have 
been allowed to ripen naturally on the 
trees, but modern commercial conditions 
demand that fruits for shipping purposes 
be picked slightly immature, and allowed 
to ripen in transit to the markets. 

The fruit-acids are composed of carbon, 
hydrogen, and oxygen, and are burned 

in the body the same as 
^/frSir"""' sugar, or fats. The actual 

energy-producing content of 
fruit is not large, and depends almost 
entirely upon the sugar content. The 
nutrient elements of fruit consist of fruit- 
sugar, combinations of salts, organic 
acids, and various flavoring or aromatic 
substances. These same salts, acids, 
etc., purchased at the drug store, and 
administered separately, would be of no 
particular value, and might produce harm- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 311 

fu! results, but in the various combina- 
tions of fruits they have very important 
places in the diet. 

One of the most important functions 
that fruit performs in the body is that 
of an artificial solvent, or an 
T^Z^n' aid to digestion. To make 
food serve this purpose well 
would require some knowledge in regard 
to chemical harmonies, quantity, etc. To 
illustrate : If the stomach does not secrete 
a sufficient quantity of hydrochloric acid, 
fruit-acid should be taken at the close of 
the meal, provided, however, that the 
combinations of food consumed are in 
chemical harmony with the acids, and, if 
they are, it is important that the quan- 
tity of fruit-acid be approximately limited 
to the actual requirements, for if too 
much is taken, it is likely to cause prema- 
ture fermentation and crystallization of 
the starch atom instead of dissolution. 

The blood-crystal (crystallized starch 
atom), above referred to, is no doubt the 



312 ENCYCLOPEDL\ OF DIET 

secondary cause of all gouty and rheu- 
matic conditions in the body. This 
explains why people of rheu- 

^ufts* °* *"** matic tendency cannot take 
acid fruit. Fruit-acid of itself 
is not harmful to these conditions, but 
when it is taken in excess of the body 
requirements, or with starchy food, it is 
most likely to augment rheumatic con- 
ditions. People of rheumatic tendency, 
therefore, should confine the diet as 
nearly as possible to starchless foods, 
omitting acid fruits.

Food Measurement" I give the energy

The fruits in the above table are all 
reasonably wholesome, and the particular 
fruits to be used depend as much upon 
convenience as upon the nature of the 
food substances. The above groups, 
however, will be given much attention 
in dietetic prescriptions, and the food 
scientist should become thoroughly fa- 
miliar with this classification. 

Of the acid fruits, oranges are the best 
and most desirable, and cranberries per- 
haps the least. 

Acid fruits are responsible for much 
stomach and intestinal trouble. Food 
was prior to life. Animal life on this 



314 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

globe has been fitted into, and is the net 
result of food; therefore, in the wonder- 
ful adaptations of Nature, it is evident 
that life will develop higher and better 
by subsisting upon the food that grows 
in its respective country. 

Acid fruits, such as lemons, limes, 
grapefruit, pineapples, and oranges, are 
grown in the tropical and semi-tropical 
countries, where the climate is warm, 
and where people subsist largely upon 
native vegetables. These fruits supply 
the acids and the fruit-sugars which the 
system requires in a warm climate. 

In the tropics the people live out of 
doors, the pores of the skin are kept open, 
and the effete matter produced by acids 
can be cast out of the body. 

In northern coimtries people live largely 
indoors, and are heavily clad except

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 315 

such as flesh and grains, both of which 
require a large amount of hydrochloric 
acid for digestion, hence when the acid 
of citrus-fruits is added to the hydro- 
chloric acid, of which most people have 
too much, serious acid fermentation is 
the result. 

Acid fermentation is the beginning of 
nearly all stomach trouble, and is the 
primary cause of many other ills. (See 
"Fermentation," p. 424.) 

Practically all the fruits of the subacid 
group are excellent; however, on account 
of the mechanical irritation 
Idd^r^ts"^" ^^ ^^^ seeds, berries should 
not be used in cases in which 
the stomach and the intestines are irri- 
tated or catarrhal. In such cases the 
juice should be pressed from the fruit and 
the seeds discarded. 

Of the non-acid fruits, raisins, figs, and 
dates are excellent foods from the stand- 
point of furnishing a large amount of sugar 
in its very best form. Very ripe ban- 



316 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

anas and ripe persimmons, especially the 
large Japanese variety, are fruits which 
have a distinct nature, and 
IddU^ts"""" are suited to a particu- 
lar purpose in dietetics. 
These pulpy fruits are especially desir- 
able in all cases of digestive irritations 
and disorders, because of the amount of 
nourishment contained in them, which is 
greater than that contained in the juicy 
fruits. In my practice I seldom, if ever, 
find a stomach so weak that it cannot 
digest ripe persimmons and very ripe 
bananas. I attribute much of my success 
in treating such cases to the skillful use of 
these products. The persimmon and the 
banana as remedial and nutritive articles, 
are the most valuable fruits grown. 

Raisins, prunes, figs, dates, apricots 

and peaches are common tj^pes of fruit

evaporated evaporation, and when

dition. Evaporated fruit should not be 
cooked. This is perhaps the most pala- 
table and wholesome method of preserv- 
ing fruit. Next in purity and importance 
are the methods of canning, as practised 
by the housewife. The ordinary com- 
mercial preparations of canned fruits, 
together with the many jams, marma- 
lades and jellies, are generally of doubtful, 
if not inferior quality. The Pure Food 
Law has accomplished much to establish 
honesty in the preserving and the labeling 
of food, but these products are still far 
from ideal, and are not to be considered 
where fresh or evaporated fruits are 
obtainable. 

VEGETABLES 

In this group we may conveniently 
class all food products not elsewhere 
discussed. 

Beans, peas, and corn, when taken in 
the immature state, are classed as vege- 
tables. The importance of this group 



318 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

of food products is not their great food 
value per pound (succulent vegetables 

contain anywhere from 75 to 
of°k?tu«°'' 95 per cent of water); it is 

the great variety of nutritive 
substances which they contain. Lettuce 
contains cellulose, proteids, active chloro- 
phyl, pentoses, sugars and starches, repre- 
senting carbohydrates in various pro- 
cesses of transformation; small quanti- 
ties of fat, and a relatively large per cent 
of mineral salts, besides numerous flavor- 
ing materials. All other edible plants 
contain many of the same elements in 
different proportions. 

Edible vegetables may be conveniently 
grouped according to that portion of the 
plant which we consume. These groups 
are:

d Cucurbita family

Succulent vegetables are very essential 
in a well-rounded bill of fare, and the 
neglect of their use is one of 
the errors in dietetics. The 
most important function of 
succulent or leafy vegetables is in the 
supply of pure water and mineral salts. 
They give to the body that which cannot 
be obtained elsewhere. 

The diet of the average person is 
composed of too many solids, especially 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 321 

of the carbohydrate class. Cereal products 
compose a very large proportion of the 
Vegetable civiHzed diet, especially in 
ititioJ.':?" America, yet the starch of 
au food cereals is the most difficult 

of all starches to digest and to assimilate. 
The water and solvent juices in fresh 
vegetables and succulent plants are im- 
portant factors in the digestion and the 
assimilation of cereal starches. The rela- 
tive importance of salads and succulent 
plants in the diet may be graded according 
to the following table:

The Irish or white potato is the only 

true tuber that is used very 

p^tetl*"** extensively as an article of 

food. It is formed chiefly of 

starch and water. The starch of this 



322 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

tuber is very coarse and much softer, 
more soluble, and hence much more 
digestible than the starch of cereals or 
legumes. Baking is the best method of 
preparing the white potato. The skins 
or peeling should be eaten in order to 
balance the diet as to cellulose, which 
is a most important article in the excita- 
tion of peristalsis of both the stomach 
and the intestines. 

The sweet potato is a root, and differs 
chiefly from the Irish potato in that it 

contains more sugar and less 
poutr"* starch. The sweet potato is | 

more wholesome than the 
Irish variety. Measured by its chemical 
contents, it is one of the best foods of 
all the tuber group. 

The root vegetables given in the order 
of my preference are: Carrots, parsnips, 

turnips and beets. Carrots 
feTetabies ^^c exceedingly nutritious 

and palatable in an uncooked 
state, eaten with nuts. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 323 

Tomatoes may be considered upon the 
border line between vegetables and fruits. 
They are exceedingly useful in cases of 
intestinal congestion and torpidity of the 
liver. 

The watermelon is very wholesome. 
The water is rich in sugar, while the pulp 
is composed of a soft jfiber, 
which is a mild stimulant to 
the digestive and the excretory organs. 
Muskmelons and cantaloups are rich in 
natural sugar. They are non-acid, hence 
in harmony with nearly every known 
article of food. Considering their chem- 
ical neutrality and food value, they are 
about the best articles of diet in the 
watery or juicy class. 

The pumpkin and the squash, which 
are closely related to the melon, are of 
the genus cucurbita, and are divided into 
three species: 

1 Pepo or pumpkin 

2 Maxima or winter squash 



324 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

3 Moschata, the pear-shaped squash 

With a shght variation of the water con- 
tent, all of these varieties contain much 
the same elements of nutrition. How- 
ever, the pumpkin is most important 
to the student of dietetics — (1) because 
of its food value, and (2) because of its 
prolific and universal growth. 

SUGARS AND SIRUPS 

It will aid the student greatly in com- 
prehending this subject if he will review 
the chemical composition of sugars as 
given in Lesson IV under ''Carbohy- 
drates," Vol. I, p. 107.) 

Sugar in its various forms is a very 
prolific food product. It is the principal 
substance contained in nearly all fruits, 
but we shall confine our discussion here 
to the various sugars and sirups as they 
appear in commerce, freed from the other 
materials with which they are associated 
in nature. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 325 

BEET-SUGAR 

Contrary to common belief, the great- 
est proportion of the world's supply of 
sugar comes from the sugar- 

^J^a'r""'^^^*' beet. Sugar, which was once 
manufactured solely from the 
maple-sap and the sugar-cane, was dis- 
covered about one hundred years ago, 
to be present in beets. A very interesting 
historical fact is that the sugar-beet 
industry owes its origin to the efforts of 
Napoleon to supply France with home- 
produced sugar, because of the tariff or 
embargo laid upon foreign commerce. As 
a result of this effort all of Central Europe 
is now a heavy sugar-producing region. 

The method of production and the 
quantity of sugar contained in the sugar- 
beet have been so greatly improved that 
the present industry is quite able to com- 
pete with the production of sugar from 
cane in the tropical regions. Crude sugar 
from sugar-beets is very unpalatable, but 



326 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

the refined or crystallized form of beet 
sugar is chemically identical with cane- 
sugar. 

Sugar-cane, though not so important 
as formerly, is still grown very extensively 
in several of the Southern 
states — Cuba, Porto Rico, 
and many semi-tropical countries. The 
chief distinction between cane-sugar and 
beet-sugar is that the crude cane-sugar, 
before it is refined, is a very wholesome 
and palatable product. The brown sugar 
of commerce is uncrystallized, or unre- 
fined cane-sugar, and is fully as whole- 
some, and to most tastes more palatable 
than the granulated product. It is to be 
regretted that fashion has decreed we 
should use white sugar. 

Refined sugar, whether produced from 
beets or cane, is sometimes slightly con- 
taminated with sulfurous 

Refined sugar . , i • t i • ^ 

acid and indigo, which are 
used for bleaching purposes, and if pres- 
ent in any quantity are very objec- 
tionable. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 327 

Maple-sugar, which is made by boihng 
or evaporating the sap of the sugar- 
maple, is a product decidedly 

Maple-sugar . . .in . 

superior m natural ilavor to 
either beet or cane-sugar. Maple-sugar 
contains a small proportion of glucose 
and levulose, but its chief distinction 
from other sugars is a matter of flavor. 
The hickory tree contains flavors some- 
what similar to the maple. A cheap sub- 
stitute for maple-sugar has been manu- 
factured by flavoring common sugar with 
the extract of hickory bark. 

The other forms of dry sugar obtain- 
able in the market are milk-sugar and 
crystallized glucose. The chief use of 
milk-sugar as an article of diet is in 
humanizing cow's milk for infant feeding. 
The dry glucose, or, as it is sometimes 
called, grape-sugar, is not commonly 
seen in the market for the reason that it 
is difiicult to crystallize, hence it is much 
cheaper to market glucose in the form of 
sirups. 



828 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Commercial glucose, as was explained 
in Lesson IV, is made by treating starch 
Themanufac- with dilute acids, and its 
ti^n'and™us°eT wholcsomcness dcpcuds en- 
of glucose tirely upon the care with 
which this is done. Theoretically, glucose 
is a very good food. In practise it is 
somewhat risky because cheap chemicals 
used in its manufacture may leave harm- 
ful and poisonous substances in the fin- 
ished product. The manufacture of 
glucose is an excellent illustration of the 
objections to man-made foods as com- 
pared with natural foods. When we eat 
grapes we know that we are taking one 
of the most important substances required 
in the life-processes in a perfectly pure, 
unadulterated and wholesome form. Sci- 
ence has taught man to manufacture the 
identical substance that is found in the 
grape from corn, which is a much cheaper 
product, but the temptation to economize 
for the sake of dividends, and to allow 
the commercial spirit to control in the 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 329 

manufacture of food products is always 
present. For this reason the manufac- 
tured article comes under suspicion, while 
the natural form we know to be * 'exactly 
as represented.'* The principal uses of 
glucose are for table sirups and confec- 
tionery. Pure glucose as an article of 
food lacks flavor; for this reason the 
usual method of manufacturing sirups is 
to mix glucose and some other form of 
sirup or molasses. 

The original sources of sirups, besides 
commercial glucose, are cane-sirup, made 

directly by evaporating the 
^i!LT juice of the sugar-cane; 

maple-sirup, made from the 
pure maple-sap; sorghum-sirup, or mo- 
lasses, from the juice of the sorghum- 
cane, which is grown extensively in the 
South and Central West; and last, yet 
perhaps most common, *'New Orleans" 
molasses, which is the residue from the 
manufacture of cane-sugar. This may 
be very wholesome if taken from the first 



830 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

drippings of the crystallized sugar, but 
if taken from sugar refineries it contains 
chemicals that have been used in the 
refining and the bleaching processes, and 
is a very doubtful product. An excellent 
quality of sirup can be made in the home 
by adding to the brown sugar a certain 
quantity of water, and boihng down to 
the desired consistency. 



HONEY 

Honey occupies a very unique place, 
as it is practically the only food substance 
Honey, man's which man utilizcs from 
th?inse'c/"" the insect world. Honey 
world cannot be strictly compared 

with milk and eggs as a food product, as 
the latter are complete foods for the 
nourishment of young and growing ani- 
mals, hence must contain all food material 
necessary to construct the animal body. 
Honey, which is a carbohydrate, is gath- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 331 

ered and used as a food for the adult bee. 
Pollen, or bee-bread, a nitrogenous sub- 
stance, is the food of the larvae or 
young bees. This illustrates a very in- 
teresting fact in physiological chemistry. 
The insect differs radically from higher 
animals in that its life is divided into 
three complete stages. When the 
adult insect, with its wings, emerges 
from the cocoon or pupa, its growth 
is complete. Some insects never take 
any food in the adult stage; but the 
adult bee takes food, which is prac- 
tically pure carbohydrates, and which 
would not maintain the life of a young 
animal. 

Honey is composed chiefly of glucose 
and levulose, with perhaps 10 per cent 
of cane-sugar, depending upon the flowers 
from which it is gathered. Honey is 
extensively adulterated with glucose, and 
sometimes with cane-sugar; thus the 
natural flavors are impaired and the 
product cheapened. 



332 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 
CONFECTIONS 

Under the general term of confections 
are included all products manufactured 

for the purpose of appealing 
folSs"' chiefly to the sense of taste 

rather than to serve any spe- 
cial purpose as food. The chief products 
that enter into confections are the various 
forms of sugars, chiefly glucose, because 
of its cheapness; fruits, nut-kernels, 
flavoring extracts, and coloring materials. 
Many of the substances used are very 
wholesome, yet the habit of eating con- 
fections as a general rule should be dis- 
couraged, if not condemned, the reasons 
being — 

1 That the material from which 
they are made is usually unknown 
to the public, and the temptation 
of manufacturers to use cheap or 
adulterated material too often 
controls, therefore quality is sacri- 
ficed to profits. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 333 

2 Confections are usually eaten 
without regard to appetite, or the 
physical need of food. 

3 The combination of things 
from which confections are made 
shows that they are put together 
not for their food value, or nutri- 
tive virtue, but wholly for the 
purpose of appealing to an artificial 
sense of taste, rather than natural 
appetite. This destroys the appe- 
tite for similar products in simpler 
forms. 

The following are the best forms in 
which sugar can be found, given in the 
order of their importance: 

1 Sweet fruits 

2 Honey 

3 Sorghum 

4 Maple-sugar or sirup 

5 Unrefined cane-sugar 

6 Refined cane-sugar 



334 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Even glucose sirups are perfectly whole- 
some when free from adulterants. The 
mixing, fixing, refining and manufacturing 
all go to make our sugar supply more 
expensive and less wholesome than the 
plain fruit-sugars, honey and sorghum. 

In order to avoid repetition, all arti- 
cles containing sugar are referred to 
Application of throughout this work as 
'We™' as sweets. By "sweets" I mean 
herein used sugar, sirups, honcy, and all 
foods containing sugars, such as desserts, 
soda-fountain drinks, and the limitless 
number of confections. While carbohy- 
drates rank second in importance in the 
human diet, yet Nature has made no 
provision for sugar being taken in its 
concentrated form. In this form it is 
the most severe article of human diet, 
and to its use can be traced the origin 
of a vast number of stomach, intestinal, 
and other disorders. Superacidity, fer- 
mentation, intestinal gas, and the large 
number of synpathetic disorders that 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 335 

follow these conditions are caused largely 
by the overconsumption of sugars. It 
would be equally as important for the 
Federal Government, or the States, to 
regulate the manufacture and the sale 
of confections as to regulate the man- 
ufacture and the sale of intoxicating 
liquors. 

VEGETABLE OILS 

Vegetable oils form too small a portion 
of the modern bill of fare. Oils of vege- 
table origin, whether taken 
teJr/of " in their natural form or 
pressed out, and used with 
other foods, are the most valuable nutri- 
ents known for the production of heat 
and energy. By this statement I mean to 
convey the idea that a given quantity of 
fat will produce more heat and energy 
than any other article of human nutrition, 
and that vegetable fats are more valuable 
than animal fats, because they are more 



336 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

adapted to the fat metabolism of the 
human body, and less likely to contain 
harmful substances. Vegetable oils con- 
tain a larger per cent of olein, which is 
considered the most palatable and the 
most valuable fat known. 

The olive is a unique plant, standing 
along the border line between fruits and 

nuts. Ripe olives contain 
owon"' from 40 to 60 per cent oil, the 

best quality of which is ex- 
tracted by cold pressure, the cheaper 
grades being pressed out at higher tem- 
perature. The superiority of olive-oil 
is due to the fact that it is composed 
almost wholly of olein; that it contains 
very little fatty acids and other impuri- 
ties, and has a mild, sweet, and agreeable 
flavor. 

The adulteration of olive-oil has been 
extensively practised, but the agitation 
of pure food, and the demand for same 
are improving the quality of this excellent 
article of food. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 337 

Cottonseed-oil is the largest vegetable 

oil industry in America. It is also the 

cheapest of vegetable oils. 

Cottonseed- rj.^^ cottonsced-kemel from 

which the oil is taken is not 
an edible product. Though used as cattle 
feed, it contains alkaloid substances which 
sometimes have a poisonous effect when 
fed too generously. 

The methods of cottonseed-oil manu- 
facture are more complex than those of 
olive-oil. The oil must be heated and 
bleached with certain chemical agents, 
and if designed for salad-oils, frequently 
a portion of the stearin is removed to 
make the oil more liquid. 

When the cottonseed-oil is carefully 
manufactured, it is considered to be 
entirely free from harmful substances. 
However, as the original material contains 
poisonous combinations, and as chemical 
agents are used in refining and bleaching, 
cottonseed-oil products are open to the 
same criticism as glucose and refined 



338 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

sirups; that is, they are wholesome when 
properly made, but cheap and careless 
production renders the product undesira- 
ble as food. Manufactured under careful 
Government supervision, cottonseed -oil 
will, no doubt, be one of the great 
foods of the future. I recommend the 
purer brands of cottonseed-oils, when 
pure olive-oil cannot be obtained or 
afforded. 

Peanut-oil is an excellent food sub- 
stance which is almost entirely neglected 
in this country. It contains 
the best portion of the pea- 
nut. Other vegetable oils, valuable as 
foods, and the use of which is to be 
recommended, are sesame-oil and sun- 
flower-oil. These products are not pro- 
duced extensively in this country. 

The cocoa-butter is pressed from the 
beans from which cocoa and chocolate 
are made. The butter has a 
flavor similar to these arti- 
cles. Cocoa-butter should not be con- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 339 

fused with cocoanut-butter. These prod- 
ucts are very different in origin. 

Cocoanut-butter is not extensively used 
in America as a food product, owing to 
the fact that the exposed 
buttTr^"*' ^^^ globules oxidize very rap- 
idly. It is extensively used 
in Germany, however, and with the 
introduction of better methods of preser- 
vation, we expect to see cocoanut-butter 
more generally used in this country, as 
the source from which it is derived is 
almost unlimited. 

Palm-oil comes from a different species 
of the palm plant than that which pro- 
duces the cocoanut. It is a 

Palm-oil . • 1 1 

very inexpensive product and 
one which is chiefly used in the production 
of soap and candles, although it is per- 
fectly wholesome as a food. Such prod- 
ucts have not been utilized in this country 
as food, because our boundless prairies 
and corn-fields have made the production 
of cattle and swine cheap, and our fat 



340 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

supply has swung toward points of least 
resistance. 

Not all vegetable oils are edible or 
wholesome. Some contain, in addition 
to olein, stearin and palmitin, and other 
fats quite as undesirable. Castor-oil, for 
example, contains ricinolein, which is a 
poison, and to which its purgative action 
is due. Croton-oil is the most powerful 
laxative known to medicine, owing to 
the fact that Nature abhors a poison. 

Linseed-oil contains large quantities 
of linolein, which is the substance that 
oxidizes, forming the stiff, 
rubbery coat on the surface 
of linseed-oil when exposed to the air. 
This makes linseed-oil valuable matter 
to the painter, but objectionable as a 
food. 



Lesson IX 

DRUGS, 
STIMULANTS AND NARCOTICS 



LESSON IX 

Drugs, 
Stimulants, and Narcotics 

With the origin and the use of drugs 
in the treatment of dis-ease, most people 
are famihar. The purpose of this lesson, 
however, is to give brief but accurate 
information concerning the various chem- 
ical elements and compounds termed 
drugs or medicines. 

Many of the medicines in common use 
are neutral, having no particular effect 
upon the body, and the effects attributed 
to them are largely imaginary. Out of 
the many thousands of chemical materials 
found in nature, there are, however, 
certain substances, groups, and com- 
pounds which have most marked and 
violent effect upon all forms of living 
protoplasm. 



344 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

The general theory upon which the 
practise of medicine rests is that certain 
Ancient beuef chcmical substanccs which 
concerning are not found in the animal 
me icine body, and which have no 

natural place therein, have mysterious 
and beneficial effects; that they possess 
certain powers, among which are the 
rebuilding of dis-eased cells, and the 
purifying of dis-eased blood. This belief 
arose in a very remote age, when the 
mind was primitive; when man was ig- 
norant, and controlled almost wholly 
by superstition — when every natural phe- 
nomenon was believed to be the work or 
whim of some god, and every dis-ease 
was thought to be the work of some devil. 
Modern science has proved all this to be 
untrue. We know by the selective 
Life the result P^occsses through millions 
of chemical of ycars of cvolution that 
armony tliosc chcmical substauccs 

which work in harmony have become 
associated so as to form life. We know 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 345 

that life is merely an assemblement of 
organic matter, very complex and little 
understood; that it is eternally under- 
going chemical changes governed by the 
natural laws of development and decay. 
We know that conformity to certain 
natural laws will produce physical ease, 
and that violation of these laws will 
produce dis-ease. We know that ease 
is what we most desire, therefore the 
trend of thought, throughout the world, 
is to realize this desire by turning toward 
the natural. 

True food furnishes the foundation or 

constructive material upon which all 

TheB^ateriai ^'^^ depends. Nearly all 

upon which other substances which affect 

epen s ^j^^ humau body are merely 

disturbing elements that interfere with 

the natural chemical processes of life. 

To illustrate more fully these general 

principles, we will take, for example, the 

chemical changes that may take place 

in the hemoglobin of the blood. Hemo- 



346 ENCYCLOPEDLV OF DIET 

globin is a proteid containing iron. It is 
a complex chemical compound and reacts 
with other substances very readily. In 
the lungs it combines with oxygen. In 
the muscles, this oxyhemoglobin is again 
received into the original body-substances. 
This life-giving process is only one of the 
many thousands selected by evolution 
from the millions of chemical changes 
possible in nature. 

When carbon monoxid, which is pres- 
ent in illuminating gas, is breathed into 
Effect of carbon the luugs, it combiucs with 
tTeTmogZn hcmoglobin, produciug a 
of the blood compouud which prevents 
the formation of oxyhemoglobin, thus 
stopping the process of oxidation in the 
body, and death is the result. 

In proportion as science has shown the 
origin of life, and the methods by which 
it has been sustained and 
d^ifm*ng°^^ developed, the use of drugs 
as a remedial agent has de- 
clined. This line of reasoning followed 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 347 

to its logical end, points with unerring 
certainty to the total abandonment of 
the drug theory of treating dis-ease ex- 
cept, perhaps, as anesthetics and dis- 
infectants. 

The means of combating dis-ease by 
disinfection is sometimes confused with 
Treatment of ^^^ general systcui of drug- 
dis-ease by giug. The modcm methods 
disinfection ^^ preventing and of combat- 
ing contagious dis-eases by disinfection 
are in harmony with the best known sani- 
tary laws. These results depend, not 
upon the ignorant and the harmful 
theories on which general drug medication 
was founded, but upon the latest and the 
most scientific knowledge. 

In the recent magazine exposures of 

patent medicines, the chief trend of 

Patent medi- argument was that these 

d'TJfnr?' stock remedies were evil be- 

aoctor's pre- 
scription cause the user took opium, 

cocain, or whisky without a doctor's 

prescription. This standpoint is more 



348 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

amusing than instructive. Just why a 
poison taken without a doctor's prescrip- 
tion should be dangerous, and its sale a 
crime, while the sale and the use of the 
same drug over a doctor's prescription 
should be highly recommended, is rather 
difficult to comprehend, and this the 
enterprising journals have not explained. 
The expose that is most needed is not of a 
few poisonous patent preparations, but 
of the fundamental folly of interfering 
with Nature's work by any form of 
poisoning. Poison is poison whether 
advertised in a newspaper as a "New 
Discovery," or prescribed by a reputable 
representative of the * 'Ancient Order of 
Medicine Men." 

In a lesson of this kind it is impractical 
to classify all drugs accurately according 
to their chemical nature. For conven- 
ience of the student, however, the drugs 
commonly used in medicine will be 
divided into three groups, which have 
common representfitives, and whose gen- 



ENCYCLOPEDL\ OF DIET 349 

eral effect upon the human body are 
well understood. These three groups are: 

a Alkaloids and narcotics 

b Alcohols and related compounds 

c Poisonous mineral salts and acids 

a ALKALOIDS AND NARCOTICS 

All alkaloids are of vegetable origin. 

They all contain nitrogen, and in some 

r ,,. respects resemble ammonia. 

Effect of alka- '^ n i -j 

loids upon the Many of the alkaloid com- 
^°^^ pounds are used in medicine. 

They affect primarily the nervous system, 
and may cause freedom from pain, or 
that abnormal state of exhilaration of 
which the opium addict is a typical 
representative. Substances of this alka- 
loid group doubtless have useful functions 
in the plant in which they grew, but in 
the animal body they are disturbing 



350 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

factors. Among the most important 
alkaloids may be mentioned opium, co- 
cain, nux vomica, quinin, and acetanilid. 

OPIUM 

Opium is the evaporated sap that flows 
from incisions made in the unripe cap- 
sules of certain Asiatic 
^,TpLT° species of poppy. It con- 
tains a large number of chem- 
ical compounds which belong to the 
alkaloid group. The chief alkaloids in 
opium are codein, narcotin, and morphin, 
the most active being morphin, which has 
a chemical formula of C17H19NO3. Other 
alkaloids are of similar composition. The 
general effects and the uses of the crude 
opium and the refined morphin may be 
considered together. The latter, being 
more concentrated, is used in much smaller 
quantities. 

The effect upon the body of either 
opium or of morphin is that of benumbing 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 351 

the nerves and producing sleep. Opium 
illustrates in a typical manner the pro- 
gressive stages by which 
opium °' both the body and the mind 

may become enslaved to 
the influence of a narcotic. The last 
stages of the opium or of the morphin 
slave is probably the lowest state of 
depravity into which the human being 
can sink. 

Opium is eaten or smoked by the 
Chinese and by other Asiatic races to a 
very great extent. This 
mofphinMwt l^at^it is considered the worst 
form of slavery to drugs 
that is know^n. In this country the 
morphin habit is the more common 
form. Morphin is either taken intern- 
ally or is injected beneath the skin by 
a hypodermic syringe. It is estimated 
that ninety -five per cent of the morphin 
slaves in this country begin the use of 
this drug under "their" doctor's pre- 
scription. 



352 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

The use of opium as prescribed by 
medical men is chiefly for the relief of 
The several either paiu or of insomnia. 
uses of mor- Jts employment in cases of 
^^^ great agony is probably jus- 

tifiable, but the repeated taking of this 
drug until the habit is formed becomes a 
criminal blunder for which the doctor 
who prescribed it should be held re- 
sponsible. Unfortunately this is only 
one of the uses to which opium is 
put by the medical profession. Pre- 
scriptions containing either opium or 
morphin are frequently given to re- 
lieve pain, or to produce sleep, when 
the primary trouble is chronic, and 
should be treated by removing the 
causes, and not alleviated by stupifying 
the nerves. In the majority of such 
cases, if the diet is balanced according 
to age, activity, and climate, and vig- 
orous intestinal peristalsis created, sleep 
will follow, and other disorders will grad- 
ually disappear. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 353 

The dangers that lurk in the use of 
opium are so well known, and the habit 
o ium in ^^^^ become so unpopular, 
patent that tricks are resorted to by 

medicines manufacturers of this drug 
to deceive the people into believing that 
they are using some "harmless" sub- 
stance, while it is the influence of the 
opium that gives the medicine its appar- 
ent good effect. Patent medicines which 
claim to kill pain, soothe nerves, and pro- 
duce sleep, usually contain opium. The 
popular "Soothing Sirups" for children 
are nearly all opium products, and have 
been given to millions of babies in this 
country by deluded mothers, in the belief 
that because it soothed, their innocent 
child was being benefited. These are 
the crimes of greed passed on to innocent 
childhood through ignorance. 

COCAIN 

Cocain is an alkaloid, the use and the 
influence of which are almost as note- 



354 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

worthy as that of morphin. Cocain is 
derived from the leaves of the cocoa 
plant which grows in the Andes of Peru. 
Just as the Chinese use opium, so the 
Peruvian Indians use cocain. 

Owing to its hydrochloric-acid salt, the 
effects of cocain differ somewhat from 
Uses and ef- ^^lose of opium. It produccs 
fects of CO- absolute freedom from pain, 
"'° and is used more particu- 

larly to produce insensibility in local 
parts of the body, as in the case of ex- 
tracting teeth. The cocain slaves, which 
are increasing alarmingly in this country, 
usually take it by hypodermic injection. 
The habit is usually acquired, as in the 
case of morphin, by the prescription of a 
physician. The patient, learning from 
experience the freedom from pain and 
the sense of exhilaration that can be 
produced by the drug, and not being 
warned by "his" physician of its baneful 
effects, continues the habit after the 
doctor's treatment has ceased, and 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 355 

awakes to find a monster owning his 
body and his mind. The cocain 
fiend, Hke the opium slave, develops 
an insatiable desire for the drug, 
and suffers extreme mental and physi- 
cal pain when deprived of the usual 
allowance. The development of untruth- 
fulness and trickery in a person desiring 
his allowance of a forbidden drug, is 
one of the marked traits of the narcotic 
slave. 

There are a number of different medi- 
cines which depend for their action 
Cocain in wholly upon the cocain they 
patent coutaiu. A large number of 

me icines catarrhal powders in the mar- 
ket are diluted forms of cocain, and 
are used extensively both by those 
who do not realize the nature of 
the drug they are using, and by those 
who know that they are cocain slaves, 
but prefer to disguise the fact in this 
manner.

NUX VOMICA AND STRYCHNIN 

Nux vomica is derived from the seeds 

of a plant that grows in India. Strychnin 

is the alkaloid which exists 

Tryl^n therein. Strychnin is quite 
dififerent in its effects from 
the above-mentioned alkaloids, for in- 
stead of benumbing the nerves, causing 
sleep or a pleasing sensation, the effect 
is a nerve stimulus which causes muscular 
convulsions. 

The medical use of strychnin is more of 
a stimulant than of a narcotic. It is given 
only in desperate cases where there is 
some hope that the convulsive effect of 
the drug may cause the patient to revive. 
This treatment, however, is very ques- 
tionable, and is not practised by many 
of the ablest authorities on drugs. 

QUININ 

Quinin is derived from Peruvian or 
cinchona-bark. This bark, like the juice 
of the poppy plant, contains a number of 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 357 

alkaloids. These alkaloids, in turn, may 
react with acids, forming salts. 

Sulfate of quinin is the most common 
form of this drug. Its principal use is 

for the destruction of the 
InLi'r^''^ malarial germ, and it is, 

therefore, the standard drug 
in all malarious countries. The germs 
of malaria, however, are not bacteria 
(microscopic plants, as many suppose), 
but minute forms of animal life. Aside 
from this particular use, the effect of 
quinin is that of a typical alkaloid, and 
its disturbing effect upon the nervous 
system, when taken in suflBcient quan- 
tities, is well known.. The principal 
reason that we do not have more quinin 
addicts, or fiends as they are usually 
called, is due, perhaps, to its extremely 
bitter taste. 

ACETANILID 

Acetanilid is one of the coal-tar poisons 
and is chemically related to anilin. This 



858 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

drug has come into use only within the past 

few years, and of all the alkaloid group 

is one of the most remark- 

Composition , • i • i 

and effects of able in its physiological 
acetaniiid gffects. Its influence is to 
produce at first a deadening effect upon 
the nervous system, which puts it in the 
"pain-killer" class. Its continued use 
destroys the hemoglobin of the blood 
and produces marked cell-destroying ef- 
fects throughout the body. Its medical 
use is for rheumatism, headache, severe 
coughs, and the like. 

A patent medicine now being widely 
exploited advertises, "We print our 
formula." So they do, and acetaniiid is 
one of the ingredients. The general 
public does not know what acetaniiid 
is. The habitue of this "healthful drug" 
experiences a craving similar to that of 
other narcotic drug fiends. 

A person who has long used a medicine 
containing acetaniiid shows a bluish- 
white complexion caused by the de- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 359 

struction of red blood-corpuscles. I 
merely mention this as an example to 
show that a knowledge of the composi- 
tion' of patent medicines does not protect 
the pubhc unless the pubHc is made 
familiar with the ingredients that com- 
pose these medicines. 

Acetanilid is the active principle in 
many popular headache powders, the 
formulas of which are not made pubhc. 
The use of acetanilid by those claiming 
to cure suffering, or to relieve it, is one 
of the most glaring malpractises of the 
day. 

Other coal-tar products chemically re- 
lated to acetanilid are antipyrin, phenace- 
_..,-, , tin, and various derivatives 

Evil effects of ' 

coal-tar pro- of bcuzol and phcuol. The 
"*^*^ general uses of this class of 

drugs are to reduce fevers and to allay 
pain. They accomplish this by stupify- 
ing the nerves and the nerve fibers, which 
serve as telegraph wires to inform the 
brain that something is wrong. This is 



360 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

equivalent to killing the messenger that 
warns us of our sins. 

The following are a few of the high 
alkaloids used by old school physicians 
in the treatment of nearly all forms of 
dis-ease : 

Laudanum — which is merely an- 
other name for opium 

Paregoric — a standard baby medi- 
cine which is a tincture of opium 
with camphor and other drugs 

Codein — an alkaloid manufactured 
from morphin 

Lyoscine — the alkaloid of henbane 

Atropin — an alkaloid extensively 
used by oculists. (It is con- 
tained with other alkaloids in 
BELLADONNA, which, in turn, 
is prepared from the plant known 
as the "Deadly Nightshade") 

Hellebore — a powerful alkaloid, is 

one of the old standard drugs | 

used in the treatment of rheu- ' 

matic gout \

TOBACCO 

Tobacco belongs strictly to the narcotic 
class of drugs. With the possible excep- 
tion of opium, tobacco is by far the most 
detrimental narcotic used by man. 

The active principle of tobacco is 

nicotin, which resides in the leaves in 

combination with malic acid. 

^Sn°^ Nicotin is an alkaloid, and 

one of the most deadly poi- 
sons known. In distilled form, nicotin, 
even in minute quantities, produces death 
almost instantaneously. The nicotin con- 
tained in a pound of tobacco is sufficient 
to kill several hundred men if ad- 
ministered in the form of pure nicotin, 
but in smoking and chewing tobacco only 
a small amount of this poison is absorbed 
into the body at one time, and, owing 
to the gradual growth of the tobacco 
habit, the system has time to partly 
adjust itself to the use of this powerful 
drug, enough at least to prevent acute 
narcotic poisoning. 



S62 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

The violent sickness caused by the 
first use of tobacco evidences the poi- 
sonous effects of the nicotin upon a body 
not accustomed to its use. 

Tobacco as a narcotic is not as drastic 
in its effect as opium, morphin, and co- 
cain; for this reason its use is not so 
generally condemned. Popular opinion, 
however, is now rapidly recognizing that 
all of these substances belong in the same 
general class and are deteriorating factors 
in human development. The rapid spread 
of the cigarette habit among young boys 
has done much to arouse popular agita- 
tion against the tobacco evil. 

From the standpoint of health, nothing 

can be said in favor of the use of tobacco 

in any form, as it gradually 

ScroflobLo deadens the sensitiveness and 
control of the nervous sys- 
tem. It preys with great violence upon 
the optic nerves, and more than any other 
drug known dethrones sexual vitality. 
The tobacco heart, which is readily 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 363 

recognized by medical practitioners, 
shows the effect of this narcotic upon the 
nervous system. The craving for to- 
bacco is closely related to the craving 
for intoxicating liquors and for highly 
seasoned food — three of the most potent 
factors in perverting the true sense of 
taste and arousing abnormal cravings 
which destroy natural hunger. 

Neither tobacco nor nicotin are now 
used extensively by medical practitioners. 
Tobacco was formerly used as a purgative, 
while nicotin was given in cases of 
strychnin poisoning, the idea being that 
one poison would neutralize or kill an- 
other. 

COFFEE 

Coffee is one of the most extensively 
used articles in the narcotic 
of°cTef °° gi'^up. The alkaloid which 
gives coffee its characteris- 
tic properties is caffein. Coffee also con- 



364 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

tains from three to four per cent of tannic 
acid. Other substances in coffee, to 
which the pleasant odors and taste are 
due, are various forms of fats and carbo- 
hydrates, but these exist in such small 
quantities as to be negligible food ele- 
ments. The effect of the caffein is that 
of a nervous stimulant, increasing the 
general nervous and mental activity. 
Coffee is frequently used to keep people 
awake. It is given as an antidote for 
opium poisoning because it stimulates 
the nervous system and prevents sleep. 
„„ . . Coffee, when used habitu- 

Effects of ' 

coffee- ally, produces various forms 

drinking ^£ dyspepsia, especially hy- 

persecretion of hydrochloric acid, tannic 
acid being the provoking factor. The 
effect of coffee upon the nervous system 
is that of continued stimulation or ex- 
citation. Its continued use overworks 
and wears out the nervous system, thus 
causing a deterioration of both body and 
mind. If caffein were taken in a highly 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 365 

concentrated form, it would result in a 
narcotic habit quite as enslaving as the 
use of opium or cocain. 



TEA 

Tea, in its chemical composition, is 
similar to coffee, containing even a greater 

percentage of the alkaloid 
of'Sr^'**°° caffein, and also a larger 

percentage of tannic acid. 
Tannic acid is present in larger quantities 
in green tea than in the black variety. 
In addition to the evil effects caused by 
the caffein which it contains, tea is more 
destructive to the normal activities of 
the stomach because of the tannic acid. 
The student may get some idea of what 
the stomach of the tea-user has to contend 
with, when it is stated that tannic acid 
gets its name from the essential action 
that this substance has in the process of 
tanning leather. 



366 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

COCOA AND CHOCOLATE 

The cocoa bean, which was mentioned 
as the source of chocolate and cocoa- 
butter, is also the source of the beverage 
known as breakfast cocoa. The cocoa 
bean contains caffein, though the per 
cent is couvsiderably less than in coffee or 
tea. Cocoa is practically free from 
tannic acid. For these reasons, and be- 
cause of its food value, it is decidedly 
the least harmful of the narcotic bever- 
ages. Cocoa, though being in reality 
more tasteful and nutritious than either 
coffee or tea, is less used because it lacks 
the stimulating effect. 

The various alkaloid poisons thus far 
discussed form but an infinitesimal 
part of the great group of articles 
used by old school physicians in the 
treatment of dis-ease, and by civilized 
people as stimulating and sedative bever- 
ages. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 367 
b ALCOHOLS AND RELATED COMPOUNDS 

The second group of drugs which is 
associated with alcohol includes the 
ethers, chloroform, and coal-tar products. 
This group is also wholly of plant origin, 
alcohol being distilled from plant prod- 
ucts, and coal-tar being formed from 
petrified plants. These drugs always 
contain the three elements carbon, hydro- 
gen, and oxygen; some contain an addi- 
tional element which gives them their 
peculiar property; for example, chloro- 
form contains chlorin. 

Coal-tar is the most wonderful source 
of drugs known. The distillation of this 
substance produces coloring matter, pre- 
servatives, poisons, and *'pain killers" 
ad infinitum. 

ALCOHOL 

The uses and the effects of alcohol 
will not be discussed at length in this 



368 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

lesson because the subject of alcohol is 
constantly before the public, and its 
evil effects universally known and ac- 
knowledged. However, I deem it well to 
examine a phase of the question which is 
not so w ell understood. 

Whether or not alcohol is a food has 
recently been discussed by a wide range 

., ^ , of writers. The answer of 

Alcohol a ^ ^ 

poison, not a scicncc is that alcohol is a 
*°°^ food in the sense that it can 

produce heat in the body. Even if 
alcohol were a true food, the heat is 
produced, however, by the increased 
circulation of the blood, w^hich is Nature's 
warfare against a poison, and in the re- 
action the vitality of the body is lowered. 
Thus the true effect of the poison is 
made manifest. Starvation is not the 
danger that threatens mankind, but 
OVERFEEDING and WRONG feeding. 
Were we in danger of starvation, whisky 
at one dollar a quart would not save us. 
The very fact that alcohol produces heat 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 369 

in the body, whether we call it a food or 
not, only adds another reason why it 
should not be used. It produces heat 
by stimulating heart action; rapid heart 
action is Nature's defense against the 
intruding poison. 

Alcohol taken in addition to food, and 
in connection with it, produces surplus 
heat, and overstimulates metabolism, 
which is very harmful. It also adds one 
more to the long list of detrimental effects 
traceable to intoxicating beverages. Al- 
cohol is a food in the same sense that 
dynamite is a fuel. Dynamite produces 
heat, but it would be an unwise fireman 
who would use it under his boiler. 

Another point regarding the use of 
alcohol that is worthy of consideration. 
Correct eating is the fact that improper 
tnuTtlT nutrition, together with the 
drink-habit over-iugcstion of Stimulat- 
ing and heating foods such as meat and 
condiments, invariably increase the appe- 
tite for intoxicants. The appetite for 



370 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

alcohol seldom, if ever, develops in a 
perfectly nourished body, and the best 
treatment known for the drink-habit is a 
careful course of balanced dieting and 
hygienic methods of living. Alcohol is 
purely a stimulant. It increases the 
heart action, the circulation, the produc- 
tion of heat, and the general vital activi- 
ties. It is an offense to Nature, and the 
body calls into activity all her powers 
to cast out the poison. When the in- 
fluence of alcohol has run its course, 
there is a reaction or stupor which calls 
for more of the same drug. This in- 
dulgence cultivates the desire through 
both the body -functions and the appetite, 
and the blighting habit dethrones the 
reason, thus rendering useless the lives 
of millions of worthy people. 

The prescribing of alcohol by physi- 

why alcohol ciaus has chiefly descended 

iatln^t*^ *° from the ancient idea that al- 

medicines cohol was Strengthening and 

beneficial to the body. The practise is 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 371 

being discontinued by many reputable 
physicians, which proves that no great 
benefits, in dis-ease, can be derived from 
its use. The regular use of alcohol in 
small doses gives the patient the feeling 
of physical exhilaration, and is therefore 
an excellent means of making him believe 
that he is being benefited. For this 
reason, and because of its cheapness, low 
grade alcohol is the chief component of 
many medicines. 

The following table gives the percent- 
age of alcohol contained in a few patent 
medicines, previous to the popular expose 
of the subject. (I do not vouch for the 
accuracy of this table at the present 
time, as the manufacturers under the 
pressure of public opinion may have 
changed their formulas) : 

Peruna 28% 

Hostetter's Bitters 44% 

Lydia Pinkham's Compound . . . .20% 

Hood's Sarsaparilla 18% 

Ayer's Sarsaparilla 26% 

Paine's Celery Compound 21% 



S72 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Within the past few years these facts 
have been made public, resulting in a 
heavy decline in the sale of these con- 
coctions. The number of good temper- 
ance people who have been innocently 
under the influence of alcohol for a goodly 
portion of their days can only be vaguely 
estimated. 

CHLOROFORM, ETHER, AND CHLORAL 

These drugs are chemically related to 
alcohol, and are typical anesthetics, which 
Uses of chioro- "^^^^ ^^^^ they producc tem- 
form, ether porary relief from pain when 
and chloral ^^^ yapoTs are inhaled. They 
are chiefly used in surgical operations, 
which is justified providing the operation 
is justified. One death in three thousand 
occurs from the administration of chloro- 
form, and one in thirteen thousand from 
the administration of ether. These 
products have been used to some extent 
in patent medicines, particularly in con- 



ill 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 373 

sumptive cures; why they are used in 
these formulas is inconceivable, as these 
drugs could have no beneficial effect in 
such cases. 

c POISONOUS MINERAL SALTS AND ACIDS 

The mineral acids and salts of certain 
metals, especially of mercury, lead, and 
copper, are powerful physiological poi- 
sons. Patent medicines are frequently 
labeled "Pure vegetable compounds." This 
statement may be true, but it is deceptive 
because they are equally as poisonous as 
the. coal-tar products which have become 
so popular. They are life-destroying in 
their final effects upon the human body. 

MERCURY 

The metal mercury or quicksilver is 

used very extensively as a medicine. 

Uses of mer- ^^^liefly in compounds of 

cury and mer- mcrCuHal SaltS. All SaltS 

cunai salts ^£ mcrcury are extremely 
poisonous. Calomel (mercuric chlorid) 



S74 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

is a standard allopathic medicine. Mer- 
curic bichlorid or corrosive sublimate is 
more destructive to protoplasm, and is 
used as a germicide or disinfectant. The 
poisonous action of mercurial salts is 
probably due to the combination of 
mercury with the protoplasm of the body- 
cells. When mercurial compounds are 
taken in poisonous doses, the antidote is 
the white of egg with which the mercury 
combines in the stomach, thus sparing 
the human protoplasm. The mercurial 
salts, when given in small doses, produce 
very remarkable physiological disturb- 
ances, notably loosening of the teeth. 
Mercurial compounds are used as a last 
resort in medicine. Because of their 
violent physiological action, these drugs 
are generally administered in cases of 
incurable dis-eases. 

POTASSIUM lODID 

Potassium iodid has a very destructive 
effect upon the natural functions of the 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 375 

body, and for this reason it has been 
associated with mercury in the treatment 
of syphiHs, the usual method being to 
alternate between potassium iodid and 
mercurial salts. 

LEAD AND COPPER 

The salts of lead and copper, like 
those of mercury, are poisonous. How- 
ever, these salts are not extensively used 
in medicines. The mineral acids, such 
as sulfuric, are recognized poisons, but 
their destructive effects upon the living 
tissue are so apparent and so painful that 
they have never gained favor with physi- 
cians. 

PURGATIVES AND CATHARTICS 

The popular term "salts" includes 
sodium sulfate (Glauber's salt), and mag- 
nesium sulfate (Epsom salts), 
g^i" ° These salts cause a large 

amount of watery mucus to 
be excreted from the mucous membrane 



376 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

of the intestines, the physiological pur- 
pose of which is to wash the offending 
substances from the body, thus producing 
a laxative effect. Were the large doses 
usually taken of these salts absorbed 
into the blood, death would ensue within 
a few hours. 

The number of products that are used 
for the purpose of relieving constipation 
is almost unlimited. Any poison which 
reacts directly upon the mucous mem- 
brane of the alimentary canal has a 
laxative effect. 

Laxative drugs do not act on the body

while taking physic is caused by this fact. 

In this lesson I have examined only a 

few of the many thousand drugs in 



I 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 377 

general use. I have omitted many drugs 
and compounds whose properties and uses 

would form interesting in- 
i«ion °^''^' formation, but the purpose 

of this book is to impart a 
knowledge of foods, not a knowledge of 
drugs. This lesson, however, is for the 
purpose of giving the reader some au- 
thentic information about the standard 
drugs and medicines, so that he may form 
his own conclusions in regard to the 
efficacy of drugs in curing dis-ease. If 
the reader will secure at a public library 
a copy of the "National Standard Dis- 
pensatory," the book used by practising 
druggists, and scan through its two thou- 
sand pages, he can form some idea of the 
limitless number of things, and the com- 
plex, uncertain, and unscientific methods 
used in the prescribing and in the dis- 
pensing of drugs.

IMPORTANCE OF CORRECT DIAGNOSIS 

AND 

CORRECT TREATMENT 



LESSON X 

Importance of Correct Diagnosis and 
Correct Treatment 

The word "diagnosis" is derived from 
two Greek words, "dia," meaning through, 
and "gnosis," meaning knowing. It 
therefore means hterally "through knowl- 
edge," "to know thoroughly," or, as we 
now say, "thorough knowledge." The 
old form of the word is still retained in the 
very common expression "to know it 
through and through." 

The primary purpose of diagnosis is 

to locate a diflSculty, to find an internal 

^. disorder that is causing un- 

Diagnosis may ^ 

be a source of pleasaut symptoms. It will 

danger readily be granted that this 

is only desirable when, after the internal 

disorder has been located, we are able 



382 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 



to do something to correct it; that other- 
wise it is of no more importance than to 
learn by post-mortem examination what 
caused death. Indeed, to know what 
the trouble is without knowing how to 
deal with it, is a very grave source of 
danger, and has caused many a death 
through resort to wrong methods. In a 
large percentage of cases Nature will heal, 
if her processes are not interfered with, 
and in all cases she is the real physician; 
our only proper office is to supply the 
right materials, and to leave her to use 
them as she will. 

Correct diagnosis is important because

cations. This is a superstition with no 
more foundation in fact than the parallel 
one that a man of vicious character can 
be made virtuous by a magical process. 
He may turn from vice to virtue in a 
moment, but he can become spiritually 
strong and wholesome only by growth, 
and by conformity to the moral law.

formity to the laws of heatlh. p 
It is literally true that *'the only per- *

are the involuntary or the automatic func- 
tions." Those that are even partly under 
Involuntary the coutrol of the will, such 
T^XZ as breathing, are almost in- 
formed variably ill done. The in- 
finite wisdom is strikingly exemplified 
in the fact that the vital functions are 
quite independent of our volition except 
for "hindrances or ruinous urgence." We 
may, and we do hinder them constantly, 
and we subject them to "ruinous urgence" 
almost continuously. These two facts 
are responsible for nearly all the bodily 
ills from which we suffer.

make it an invariable rule, therefore, 
never to interfere in any way, but to

do her wonderful work, and to an observ-

processes; when we remember that the 
supply to every cell is delicately adjusted 
to constantly varying requirements; that 
all this goes on so quietly and so smoothly 
that we are unconscious of it — when we 
remember all this, we begin to have some 
appreciation of the Psalmist's exclamation, 
*'I am fearfully and wonderfully made." 
How faithful these little workmen are! 
Not for an instant do they leave their 
tasks. Verily, they are the sentinels 
forever at the portals. In our work, in 
our pleasures, they are ever active; in 
our sleep, they sleep not. Not for an 
instant do they cease watch. Is there a 
wound — be it a great rent or a tiny pin- 
prick, they are there in force to repair it, 
to wall up the breach and to make it 
whole — swarming to the rent as the 
Lowlanders to a break in the dike. Has 
a foreign substance penetrated the struc- 
ture? — instantly they set about to expel 
it; but if this be impossible, they seal 
it in a capsule of impervious integument

possible injury.

action of the obvious purposc defanitely 

blood carried out by every avail- 

able agency, we may be sure there is a 
consciousness back of it, whether it be 
like ours or not. 

But while these workmen are faithful^ 
while they will stand to their tasks to 
the end, they are limited in their power, 
and will break ranks under long-contin- 
ued* hindrances.

not in the electric nervous system of the 
house. It may be between your house 
and the electric station, but before taking 
the trouble to examine the line, ask those 
of your neighbors who are on a different

are, you may go to the electric station

sure is low. "Yes," says the fireman, 
"I simply can't keep the pressure up. 
I shovel in coal and keep the drafts on so 
that I have a roaring fire, but, in spite 
of all, my steam pressure runs down." 
Look into the furnace (the stomach) of

tubes, just as it is deposited on the bottom 
of a teakettle, and it shuts out the heat

inside the boiler is not so easily dealt 
with. It is completely enclosed, and there 
is no possibility of getting at it except 
by extinguishing the fire and letting the 
boiler cool — by making the boiler "dead,** 
or "killing" it, as firemen term it.

into the boiler. It can then be revived 
by refining it with water and rekindhng 
the fire. 

Then, too, let us assume that there are 
two boilers, and that we can keep the 
plant alive with one; a low ebb of life, 
to be sure, but not dead. We will then 
cool one boiler at a time, go into it, and 
remove the scale, thus restoring the plant 
to full efficiency. 

This method can be used where the 
boiler may be cooled, but as this cannot 
be done with the human power-plant, for 
the sake of our analogy, let us suppose 
that the steam boiler, like the human 
body, must always be kept under pressure 
that it cannot be "killed" and revived. 
What, then, shall be done.^ 

It is evident that the first thing to do 

is to cease the use of water containing the

may be accomplished by distilling the 
water before introducing it into the 
boiler, or, by using rain-water. As to the 
scale already in the boiler, it must be 
dissolved, and gradually eliminated, or 
remain there. There are many so-called 
*'boiler compounds" for the purpose, 
and every well-informed man in charge 
of such a *'plant" knows how important 
it is to avoid using a compound that may 
cause damage to the boiler itself. A 
*'compound" that would attack the steel, 
as well as the scale, would be a desperate 
remedy indeed.

very similar to the deposit of scale in a

dis-ease. As food is its fuel, how can we 
expect the mechanism to remain in order

if we utterly disregard the body's require- 
ments, not only as to the character of the 
fuel supplied, but also as to the quantity, 
especially if we so choke it with fuel that 
Nature is unable to burn it up in the vital 
processes, and to dispose of the resulting 
ashes and cinders? Nature is resourceful 
— ^fuU of expedients and makeshifts! If 
she were not, the span of life would be 
much shorter than it is. As previously

or even for years.

As the blood is the life, as it brings to 
every cell life (nourishment), and carries 
away death (poisonous by-products of 
vital activities in the form of dead matter 
to be eliminated from the body); as it 
does this by its marvelously rapid circu- 
lation through every cell, it is obvious 
that every part of the body will be in a 
state of health if the blood itself is pure, 
and its supply and circulation such that 
every cell is abundantly fed. The su- 
preme law of health, therefore, may be 
expressed in tw o statements, one positive 
and one negative: 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 397 

1 Feed the body correctly 

2 Do not interfere with the circu- 
lation of the blood 

If the blood is not a perfect building

IS impeded by positive con- 
strictions, or, as is more frequently the 
case, because the composition of the blood 
is not perfectly suited to the demands of 
the vital activities. As a result, miich of 
the material must be rejected as unusable, 
thus involving a great deal of extra work 
in disposing of it. If the excessive ma- 
terial is wholesome, though not at present 
usable, it may be packed away for future 
use as fat, this being the easiest, and 
perhaps the only possible way of disposing 
of it in the rush. The builders are not 



398 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

only overworked, but literally over- 
whelmed with excessive and unsuitable 
materials — and why? — that we may in- 
dulge perverted appetites. 

Even the excessive material packed 

away in the wholesome form of fat may, 

Co uienc Hicrely by its bulk, become 

considered au impediment to the cir- 

unheaithy culatiou. It not ouly reduces 

the eflBciency of the bodily mechanism, 

but also is so potent a factor in shortening 

life that a corpulent person is likely to be 

rejected by an insurance company, even 

though his present state of health may 

be good.

most forcibly the manner in which defec-

because the person thus aflflicted has a

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 399 

sense of painful exhaustion upon slight 
exertion — is tired all the time. If our 
diagnosis shows a state of chronic exhaus- 
tion, and we endeavor to increase the 
body-eflSciency by increasing the food, 
we shall make the same mistake as the 
fireman who shovels more coal under a 
scaly boiler. 

Painful exhaustion in a perfectly 
healthy body results from violent, or too 
Exhaustion, long-coutinucd exercise of 
!k>n*o/body^ a musde, and if there are 
poisons no intervals of rest, excru- 

ciating pain results. The cells are broken 
down more rapidly than the resulting 
waste can be carried away by the circu- 
lation, hence the body-poisons and pain. 
The pain is a symptom, and where the 
condition of which it is the index is 
temporary, rest soon restores the normal 
condition of ease. 

There would be no sense of exhaustion 
if the building and the eliminating pro- 
cesses could be carried on with sufficient 



400 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

rapidity concurrently to make good all 

the expenditures of mental and bodily 

activities. Not only should 

^^!r?«,,o we not need rest, but we 

imperative ' 

should not even need sleep. 
The only occasion to stop, then, would 
be to take in more fuel (food) , and if this 
could be taken while the body is in action, 
as fuel is fed to the steam boiler, there 
would be no necessity to stop. But 
apparently both the upbuilding and the 
elimination of waste normally lay behind 
the demands of even ordinary activity, 
so that a given muscle must have very 
frequent intervals of rest (every few 
seconds), and the organism, as a whole, 
must reduce activity to the minimum by 
sleep about one-third of the time. 

As some of the muscles are used with 
practical continuity during the waking 

„ , , . life. Nature resorts to some

relaxed for an instant in the unconscious 
act of winking, but by reason of the 
persistence of visual sensation, this does 
not interfere with vision. Thus Nature 
has always used the principle involved 
in the moving picture. The heart must 
perform its w^ork every instant, from the 
time before we are born until the end, but 
each muscle rests about one-third of 
every second — when it relaxes, and the 
chamber of the heart expands with the 
inrush of blood.

Common Disorders — Their Cause and

HEALTH AND DIS-EASE DEFINED 

Health is that condition of the human 
body in which the functions or activities 
work together in perfect harmony. Any 
serious interference with this condition 
we call dis-ease. Dis-ease, therefore, in 
its final analysis, is merely the expression 
of violated natural law. 

The harmonious working of the life- 
processes in the human body depends 

Three funda- "P^.^ ^hrCC things— (1) HU- 

mentai laws tritiou; (2) uiotion and (3) 

oxidation. Nutrition is the 

principal factor that controls the action 

of the living cells, for, if the body is kept 



406 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

up to its one hundred per cent of energy 
it will demand a certain amount of mo- 
tion or exercise, and this will enforce the 
proper breathing (oxidation). We can 
see, therefore, that nutrition is the physi- 
cal basis of all activities of life. 

By nutrition as here used I mean to 
include all chemical substances that may 
be supplied for the use of the body-cells, 
also the sum total of all chemical sub- 
stances in solution in the circulating jfluid 
or blood-plasma which bathes the body- 
cells. 

The stoppage of the heart beat causes 
the nutritive fluids of the body to cease 

Thephenome- circulating. The cells are 

caused by^self- thcU IIO lougcr SUppHcd with 

poisoning nutritive material, and the 
poisons which they are constantly throw- 
ing off accumulate, cell activity ceases, 
and the phenomenon we call death ensues. 
Suffocation acts in a very similar manner 
— oxygen ceases to be supplied to the 
blood: carbon dioxid accumulates: the 



I 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 407 

vital fluids cease to flow, and death is the 
result. 

Dis-ease has been defined to be an 
absence of harmonious activity in the 
body. It may result from the inactivity 
of some particular function. A stomach 
which secretes no hydrochloric acid is 
abnormal or dis-eased. Again, a dis- 
ease may be due to an overdevelopment 
of some function, because the man whose 
stomach secretes more hydrochloric acid 
than digestion requires is as truly dis- 
eased as is the man whose stomach se- 
cretes too little. 

Dis-ease may also be defined as partial 
death, for it is the disturbance or weaken- 
ing of functions whose com- 

SSrdel'th Plete failure we call death. 
Starvation illustrates one 
side of this process. When nutritive 
material ceases to be supplied, the cells 
have nothing with which to work, causing 
disturbance of function (dis-ease), and 
then partial, or complete death. The 



408 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

man in a desert under a hot sun will 
starve for water in one-tenth the time 
that he would starve for sohd food. Ani- 
mals fed on a diet from which all salts 
^ . , , have been chemically re- 

Ammals starve ... 

when fed on movcd wiU die in a shorter 

salt-free food ^^^^ ^-^^^ ^ju ^^^^^ ^^^^ 

which all food is withheld. This rather 
interesting fact is due to the rapid util- 
ization of the salts residual in the body 
during the digestion and the assimilation 
of the salt-free foods taken. The order 
in which the withdrawal of nutritive 
substances will produce starvation is 
about as follows: 

1 Aerial oxygen 

2 Water 

3 Mineral salts 

4 Organic nitrogen 

5 Carbohydrates 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 409 

Poisoning by drugs is an excellent illus- 
tration of dis-ease and death produced 
Exam les of ^^ spccific Starvation. When 
drug poison- a man takes ether, this sub- 
^^ stance, passing to the brain, 

immediately interferes with the function 
of that organ. Insensibility to pain 
results. If ether is taken in larger quanti- 
ties, the functions of the brain may be 
still further interfered with, and the 
nervous control of the heart beat will be 
lost, and death will ensue. When castor- 
oil is taken into the ahmentary canal, the 
poisonous substances therein contained 
inflame the cells of the mucous mem- 
brane, and excite them to abnormal sec- 
retion, thus disturbing the harmony of the 
body-activities, and producing dis-ease. 
The examples here referred to are not 
commonly considered dis-ease, because 
c . ^.. we know the particular or 

Scientific ^ ^ *^ 

definition of immediate cause of the phy- 

dis-ease ^-^^j disturbance. Modern 

knowledge now shows us that the most 



410 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

prolific cause of what is commonly known 
as dis-ease is but the interference with 
cell activities, either by the deficiency or 
by the excess of nutritive substances, or 
by the presence of irritating and disturb- 
ing poisons. This condition may be 
caused by an unbalanced diet containing 
too much of certain nutritive elements, 
or too little of others, causing surfeiting 
on the one hand and starvation on the 
other. 

Health is the normal condition, and in 
spite of Ingersoll's witticism, it is more 
Man still in the "catching than dis-ease.'* 
sutf o7 devei- ^^'^rc it uot SO, the race 
opment would loug siucc havc be- 

come extinct. With reference to body- 
health, however, we are still in the 
childhood stage of development, and the 
science, therefore, of building man to his 
highest estate — of lifting his mental, 
moral, and physical faculties to their 
highest possible attainment, is worthy 
the labor of the greatest minds. That 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 411 

person, then, who enjoys the best health, 
the keenest mentaHty and power of per- 
ception, the highest physical and emo- 
tional organism, is he who can select such 
articles of food as will supply all the con- 
stituent parts of the body most nearly 
in the right or natural proportions. The 
science of feeding, upon which this mainly 
depends, becomes possible only when 
food is taken in accordance with certain 
fixed, natural laws. These laws are not 
complicated —they are simple and easy 
to comprehend. Nature is constantly 
endeavoring to aid us in their solution. 
Hunger, thirst, Hunger, thirst, taste — all the 
iTatuie? "" instincts and natural de- 
language sircs of the body are merely 

Nature's language. To interpret this 
language, and to obey the laws it lays 
down is man's highest duty to himself 
and to his race. 

There are very few true dis-eases. 
Nearly all of the abnormal physical 
expressions given off by the body can 



412 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

be traced to a few primary causes, and 
most of these causes can be removed by 
ascertaining and removing other causes 
that precede them. 

The classification of dis-eases is merely 

a matter of convenience, and is of no 

Classification practical importance between 

"lf:r"Tr'.l the food scientist and the 

matter of con- 
venience patient. It merely enables 

the one who has studied these classifica- 
tions to convey his knowledge or infor- 
mation to the lay mind. 

The dis-eases which will most interest 
the student will be those caused by a 
lack of nutrition, or by a surfeit of nutri- 
tion; that is to say, a form of starvation 
caused by a lack of certain nutritive 
elements, and overingestion caused by 
an excess of certain other nutritive 
elements. 

The only practical method of describ- 
ing dis-ease is by indicating the organs 
afflicted and the impairment of their 
functions. Beginning with the stomach, 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 413 

in which, as previously stated, originates 
probably ninety-one per cent of all human 
disorders, I will first take up the question 
of the abnormal action of food caused by 
overeating. 

OVEREATING 

Fortunately Nature does not demand 
exactness. She has made wonderful pro- 
vision for our errors or our 

The resource- 
fulness of lack of precision. If we eat 
Nature ^^^ much uow and then she 

will cast out the excess. If, however, we 
habitually overeat, she will store away 
the surplus in the form of useless fat, or 
she will decompose it; that is, make an 
effort to volatilize it and cast it out 
through the pores of the skin. If our diet 
is unbalanced. Nature has the power to 
convert one chemical into another — a 
secret yet unknown to modern science. 

While the tendency of Nature is to 
maintain normality by casting the debris 



w 



414 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

out of the body, she demands that we obey 
the laws of motion and oxidation. If we 
Injurious ef- do not obscFve these laws, 
IVi'd"™".; the debris or matter she 
matter cannot use will accumulate, 

and congestion and constipation will take 
place. As was shown in Lesson V, the 
various forms of bacteria always present 
during the ravages of dis-ease are pro- 
duced by the decomposition of this 
congested matter. This is Nature's way 
— perhaps her last method of disposing 
of effete matter. Bacteria is, therefore, 
the result and not the cause of dis-ease. 
The effects of overeating are so far- 
reaching, and so common among civilized 
people that a volume might be devoted to 
this habit and the subject not exhausted. 
Here, however, I will review only that 
which is of most importance to the 
student of dietetics, namely, the causes 
and a few of the effects of overeating. 

Overeating is due to three specific 
causes: 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 415 

1 Eating several articles of food at 

the same meal which are 
chemically inharmonious 

2 Taking stimulants at meals 

3 Eating too many things at the 

same meal 

(1) Chemically inharmonious: 

When foods are eaten together that 
are inharmonious they produce a chem- 
ical disturbance which usually results in 
irritation of the mucous membrane of the 
stomach, or superacidity (too much acid), 
or both. 

(2) Stimulants with meals: 

When one takes stimulants such as 
beer, liquor or wine with meals, the 
stomach-cells secrete a superabundance 
of hydrochloric acid, causing food to 



416 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

leave the stomach too quickly; that is, 
before stomach-digestion is complete. 
This leaves a residue of clear acid in the 
stomach, which causes severe irritation 
and is the primary cause of stomach- 
catarrh, ulcer and finally cancer. 

(3) Too many things at same meal: 

Too many things eaten at the same 
meal may exhaust the digestive juices 
and cause a condition of subacidity (lack 
of acid), which is true indigestion, or it 
may cause just the reverse, too much 
acid, and therefore produce the same 
result as in taking stimulants with meals. 
(See "Causes of Superacidity," item 2, 
p. 420). 

In nearly all cases of overeating Na- 
ture's only weapon with which to defend 
The c cie of ^^^rsclf is hydrochloric acid, 
cause and thus the stomach-cclls be- 
^^^'^^ come over-trained in the se- 

cretion of acid, and the constant irritation 



ENCYCLOPEDL\ OF DIET 417 

caused by acid fermentation produces 
abnormal appetite. The desire to satisfy 
this abnormal craving produces more acid, 
therefore the cycle of overeating and 
superacidity is complete. 

Standard medical works give about 
sixty different disorders arising from 

_. . what is termed dis-eases of 

Disorders 

originating in nutritiou. Tlicsc include 

the stomach (ji^bctes, gout, arthritis, 
rheumatism, rickets, scurvy, obesity, ema- 
ciation, adiposis dolorosa, and various 
disorders of the liver, heart, and the cir- 
culatory system; also constipation and 
dozens of disorders under the broad term 
of autointoxication. 

The first step in the practise of scien- 
tific eating should be to limit the quan- 
tity of food, or, in many cases, to take 
a complete fast for a brief time. 

In the slow stages of human develop- 
ment. Nature seems to have accommo- 
dated herself to man's omnivorous habits 
of eating. She will accept many things 



418 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

that are wholly unfit for food without 
apparent harm if the quantity is not too 
great. On the contrary, the results of 
the most scientific dieting w^ill be injuri- 
ous if a quantity be taken in excess of 
that which the body can use. 

SUPERACmiTY 

We will first consider superacidity 
because it is usually the first disorder 
that appears in consequence of wrong 
eating. 

For convenience, superacidity is also 
often called hyperacidity. Chronic cases 
of superacidity are termed hyperchlor- 
hydria. In the language of the common 
people it is called *'sour stomach." 

The time food remains in the stomach 
is measured by the amount of hydro- 

siow or rapid chloric acid present. When 

fef^ned by' '^^^ ^^^^ "^^^ ^^^ stomach a 

amount of acid quantity of food in excess of 

our physical requirements, Nature se- 



( 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 419 

cretes or pours into the stomach an excess 
of hydrochloric acid. Too much acid 
causes the food to pass from the stomach 
too quickly, while a deficiency of acid 
causes digestion to be too slow. In the 
former case food is forced from the 
stomach before it has been made into 
chyme, which is a solution fine enough 
to pass from the stomach and be acted 
on by the pancreatic juice. 

When digestion is too rapid, there is 
always some hydrochloric acid left in

ence of the acid, and every symptom of 
indigestion is experienced — even the 
usual "lump" in the stomach. The lump 
often felt an hour or so after eating, in 
cases of superacidity, is due to the action 
of the hydrochloric acid upon the walls 
of the stomach, producing a convulsive 
motion. This symptom is often mistaken 
for indigestion, while in truth the food 



420 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

lias passed from the stomach too quickly, 
leaving a residue of clear hydrochloric 
acid that preys upon the walls of the 
stomach with such severity that it causes 
a convulsive motion of the stomach very 
easily mistaken for undigested food. 

The food having passed from the 
stomach before Nature's time-limit is 
reached, and before thorough dissolution 
has taken place, is forced into the upper 
intestines, supercharged with acid, which 
is the most prolific cause of constipation, 
from which nearly all civilized people 
suffer more or less. 



SUPERACIDITY— THE CAUSE 

The chief causes of superacidity are 

1 Too great a quantity of food 

2 Wrong combinations and wrong 

proportions of food 



♦ 



( 



I 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 421 

For instance, a diet con- 
sisting of an excess of acid 
fruits, or sweets and starches, 
and at the same time an in- 
suflScient quantity of other 
nutrients 



3 By alkaloid poisoning from the 
use of tea or coffee, liquor, to- 
bacco, and the various stimu- 
lating and narcotic drugs used 
by civilized man 



SUPERACIDITY— THE SYMPTOMS 

So far as the symptoms are concerned, 
all the above causes may be considered 
together, since the ultimate result is the 
same. The symptoms are named in the 
order of their various stages or the time 
acidity has endured: 

1 ^Irritation of the mucous lining 
of the stomach, expressed by 



422 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

a burning sometimes called 
"heartburn" 



2 Abnormal appetite caused by the 

presence of too much blood 
in the irritated cells of the 
stomach 

Many people mistake these 
symptoms for evidence of good 
health, until overeating produces 
nervous indigestion, and some- 
times a complete breakdown 

3 Fevered mouth, and so-called 

fever-sores on the lips and 
tongue, both of which are a 
true mirror of the condition 
of the stomach 

4 'A sour fluid rising in the throat 

from one to two hours after 
meals 

5 White coating on the tongue 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 423 

6 Faintness, emptiness; in the 
language of the layman a 
"holiowness and an all-gone 
caved-in" feeling 

*(See "Fermentation — The Symp- 
toms," p. 426) 

SUPERACIDITY— THE REMEDY 

In all cases of superacidity all fruit, 
especially that of an acid character, 
should be omitted, and also all sweets 
except a very limited quantity of maple- 
sugar and sweet fruits. Foods containing 
proteids (nitrogen, albumin and casein), 
together with fresh green vegetables, 
should form the principal part of the 
diet. (For "sweet and non-acid fruits,'* 
see Lesson VIII, p. 313.) 

It has been the theory with dietitians 

One acid wiu ^o^ many years that those 

not counteract afflictcd with hypcrchlorhy- 

dria (supersecretion of acid) 

should not take sweets, but should take 



424 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

acids liberally. This theory had its 
origin, no doubt, in the ancient super- 
stition that one poison would counter- 
act or kill another, hence it was but 
an easy step to the belief that one acid 
would counteract another. This theory 
is utterly without scientific foundation, 
and my practical work has proved that 
just the reverse is true. It is quite as 
illogical to suppose that the effect of one 
acid can be counteracted by another as 
it would be to try to cure a burn by hold- 
ing the hand in the fire, or to counteract 
the effects of alcohol by taking other 
stimulants. 

For list of foods to be eaten and 
omitted in cases of overeating, supera- 
cidity, fermentation and gas dilatation, 
see p. 433. 

FERMENTATION 

Fermentation is the effort of Nature to 
dispose of or to dissolve things it cannot 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 425 

use; it is the first step in the process of 
decay. 



FERMENTATION— THE CAUSE 

The common causes of fermentation are 
the same as those of superacidity (see 
p. 420), the difference being that super- 
acidity originates in the stomach, and is 
confined chiefly to it, while fermentation 
may take place throughout the entire 
intestinal tract. The causes are — 

1 Overeating 

2 Too much acid fruit 

3 An excess of sweets 

4 Stimulants of the alkaloid group 

5 Overeating of cereal products 



426 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

FERMENTATION— THE SYMPTOMS 

The first evidence of fermentation is a 
burning sensation in the stomach, almost 
Difiference be- exactly as in superacidity, 
aSryan?"^" ^^^ difference being that in 
fermentation cascs of fermentation the 
symptoms appear later after eating. Su- 
peracidity may appear immediately after 
eating, and the symptoms such as a lump 
ill the stomach, or a sour fluid rising in 
the throat may also appear within an 
hour after meals, but fermentation, which 
produces the same symptoms, does not 
manifest itself until the acid has acted 
upon the food, which requires from two to 
four hours, governed by the time required 
to digest the dift'erent articles of which the 
meal is composed. 

The patient may also experience a full- 
ness; an unpleasant and sometimes pain- 
ful distention of the bowels. 

The gas generated by fermentation 
sometimes passes along down the intes- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 427 

tinal tract into the ascending colon, ac- 
cumulating at the highest point, which is 
in the transverse colon. This 

fermentation ^auses the trausvcrse colon 
to become very much dis- 
tended and seriously interferes with the 
blood flow, both into and out of the heart 
and the lungs. 

(See ^'Gastritis," p. 447; also "Heart 
Trouble," p. 569). 

In considering the symptoms of fer- 
mentation, it might be well to return to 
the question of causes. The primary 
cause of nearly all conditions of fermen- 
tation, either in the stomach or in the 
intestinal tract, is overeating, or an un- 
balanced dietary. 

This practise indulged in from day to 
day causes two specific conditions; 



1 Fermentation followed by vari- 
ous disorders, usually toxic 
substances, and catarrh, and 
ulceration of the stomach 



428 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

2 Intestinal congestion and physi- 
cal emaciation 

If the stomach and other digestive 
organs are capable of assimilating this 
superabundance of food, they force into 
the tissues an excess which Nature stores 
up in the form of fat, and if work or ac- 
tivity is not increased, or the food 
diminished, excessive fat or chronic obe- 
sity is the result. 

If the first warnings are not observed, 
and the remedy applied. Nature gives 
to the disobedient one more impressive 
signals in the form of nervousness, irri- 
tability, abnormal appetite, and some- 
times mental depression, which indicates 
one of the most advanced stages of super- 
acidity. 

FERMENTATION— THE REMEDY 

The remedy for fermentation is first 
to eat only such foods as are in chemical 
harmony, and second to limit the quan- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 429 

tity to the actual needs of the body. If 
the patient is under normal weight, all 
acid fruits should be eliminated, and the 
diet should be about as follows: 

BBEAKFAST 

Three or four egg whites and one yolk, whipped 
five or six minutes; add a large spoonful of sugar 
and one of cream while whipping 

A baked white potato or boiled wheat 

A tablespoonful of wheat bran 



One whole egg whipped five minutes; add 
sugar and cream to taste while whipping, mix 
with a glass of milk 

A large boiled onion 

A baked potato, with butter 

Two tablespoonfuls of bran 



Two fresh vegetables — choice of carrots, corn, 
turnips, peas, beans, or squash 

Spinach, or a salad of lettuce and celery 

The whites of two or three eggs, whipped; 
add sugar and cream while whipping 

A baked potato 

Wheat bran, cooked as a cereal 



430 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

From two to three glasses of cool water 
should be drunk at each meal. 

It will be noticed that this bill of fare is 
composed largely of proteids, which should 
predominate in cases of fermentation. 

The foods named in the above menus 
will remove the primary causes of fer- 

^ , . mentation, wdiich in turn is 

Despondency, ' 

the result of the most proKfic cause of 
superacidity ^^^^ abnormal mental condi- 
tion called despondency. Under the most 
favorable social and financial conditions, 
when every environment is pleasant and 
seemingly conducive to the highest degree 
of pleasure and interest in life, the one 
afBicted with superacidity and fermenta- 
tion has been known to destroy himself; 
all life seems gloomy, all effort useless, 
and the thought *'Why should I desire 
to live.'^" enters the mind unbidden, until 
it often takes tangible shape in some rash 
act. Possibly w^ithin the memory of 
every individual one of these rash acts 
can be recalled. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 431 

The practitioner should make it a 
special point to ascertain any adverse 
or depressed mental conditions of his 
patient and remove them, if possible, by 
encouragement, sympathetic counsel and 
optimistic views, all of which have a 
splendid psychological effect, and which, 
in nearly all cases of mental depression, 
are very important. 

As the supersecretion of hydrochloric 
acid becomes less and less, fermentation 
will gradually disappear; the patient 
will at once begin to gain weight; the 
mental conditions will show an imme- 
diate improvement, and every part of the 
anatomy will share in the general up- 
building. 

GAS DILATATION 

So closely related are gas dilatation, 
fermentation and superacidity that it 
might be said they all come from common 
causes, such as excessive eating, over- 
consumption of sweets, acid fruits, 



432 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

starches, and the use of tobacco, stimu- 
lating beverages and drugs. 

GAS DILATATION— THE SYMPTOMS 

The symptoms of gas dilatation are 
practically the same as those given for 
fermentation, page 426. In addition 
thereto, however, there is often belching, 
loss of appetite, a weighty or draggy 
feeling, and vomiting sometimes an hour 
or two after meals, or late at night. 

Scanty urine and constipation are fre- 
quently the results of gas dilatation. In 
severe cases the stomach drops down 
below its normal level, causing permanent 
stomach prolapsus. 

To the trained eye, in severe cases, 
the stomach may be outlined, especially 
when it is much distended. 

For remedy, see "Fermentation," page 
428.

IMPORTANCE OF WATER-DRINKING 

The lack of body-moisture is one 
of the causes of supersecretion of 
acid, therefore water is of primary 
importance in removing the causes 
of the above disorders. It should 
be drunk freely immediately on 
rising, and just before retiring. 
From two to three glasses should 
also be drunk at each meal, espe- 
cially in treating severe cases. 
Copious water-drinking also re- 
lieves irritation of the stomach, 
thus reducing abnormal appetite. 

Patients afflicted with superacid- 
ity never have natural thirst. 

CONSTIPATION 
THE CAUSE 

This disorder might be called "civili- 
zatis," so universal has it become among 
civilized people. 

Several conditions may conspire to 
cause constipation — 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 435 

1 Premature stomach digestion 

2 Neutralization of the bile by- 

excessive acid 

3 Eating too much starchy food 

4 Flesh-eating 

5 Sedentary habits or lack of 

proper exercise 

6 A diet too refined — lacking in 

roughness, cellulose or "fod- 
der" 

7 The use of sedatives, stimulants, 

and narcotics, such as tea, 
coffee, liquor, tobacco, and 
drugs, especially of the alka- 
loid group 

While most of these are direct causes, 
the primary cause, however, goes back 
to superacidity — premature stomach-di- 
gestion. 



436 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

In cases of superacidity the liver is 
nearly always more or less inactive. 
Just why this is so is not definitely known, 
but in the opinion of the writer it is 
caused by the neutralization of bile by 
the excess of acid. Be this as it may, 
nearly all cases of superacidity are ac- 
companied by intestinal congestion, 
commonly called constipation, or by 
intermittent diarrhea and constipation. 



CONSTIPATION— THE REMEDY 

It is believed by the medical profession, 

and generally accepted by the public, 

that certain drugs act upon 

drugs an of- the alimentary tract with 

fense to the beneficial effect in cases of 

boay 

intestinal congestion. This 
is untrue. The facts are the intestines 
act upon the drug. The drug is an offense 
to Nature, and when it is taken into the 
stomach and passed on to the intestines. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 437 

the body-fluids are severely drawn upon 
to neutralize the poison, and to cast it 
out. The result, therefore, of taking 
poisons, miscalled "laxatives," is that 
each time the act is repeated, the Uver 
and the peristaltic muscles are weakened, 
and rendered more and more abnormal, 
and less and less able to perform their 
natural functions. 

That system of treatment which has 

been prescribed for fermentation will. 

Suggestions in most cascs, relieve con- 

l7e»Jpt' stipation. The treatment 

tion should be varied, however, 

according to the age and the occupation 

of the patient, governed by the season 

of the year, or the foods available at the 

time of treatment. If diagnosis of the 

patient reveals the fact that constipation 

has been caused primarily by overeating, 

the quantity of food should be reduced, 

and the articles changed so as to include 

a generous quantity of cellulose (coarse 

foods). 



438 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

The following bill of fare may be 
given under ordinary conditions: 

Immediately on rising, take two 
or three cups of water, the juice 
of one or two oranges, or half 
a pound of grapes, swallowing the 
seeds and pulp whole, masticating 
only the skins. Devote from eight 
to ten minutes to vigorous exercise, 
especially movements Nos. 3 and 
5, as shown in "Exercise and Re- 
creation," Vol. V, pp. 1344 and 1345. 



BREAKFAST 

Half a cup of coarse wheat bran, cooked ten 

minutes; serve with thin cream 

Whole wheat, boiled five or six hours 

One or two very ripe bananas, with either nuts 

or thin cream 



LUNCHEON 

One or two fresh vegetables 
A "two-minute" egg or a very small portion 
of fish 

A heaping tablespoonful of bran 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 439 



Two of the following vegetables: Corn, car- 
rots, peas, beans, parsnips, turnips, onions 
A baked potato 

Celery, lettuce, or anything green, with nuts 
One egg 
A tablespoonful of wheat bran 

From one to two glasses of water 
should be drunk at each of these 
meals. 

These menus are merely suggestive. 
They may be varied according to judg- 
ment, depending upon the habits and the 
environments of the patient. Curative 
feeding for constipation is one of the 
most important departments of this work, 
and will receive special consideration 
in the volume of Menus.

442 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Whether or not milk is constipating 

depends entirely upon how it is taken, 

„.„ . and the articles with which 

Milk may be ^ ^ 

laxative or it is combincd. In small 
constipating quantities, from one to two 
glasses at a time, milk is constipating. 
However, if taken at intervals of fifteen 
or twenty minutes, a quantity is very 
soon taken, greater than the hydrochloric 
acid of the stomach can convert into 
curd, therefore the surplus quantity be- 
comes rather laxative. In many years* 
experience I have rarely treated a case 
of constipation that would not readily 
yield to milk and to coarse vegetables, or 
bran, if taken in this way; however, the 
milk diet should not be given longer than 
two or three days at one time. After this 
period adopt the menus herein given, 
varying them by selecting different arti- 
cles from the several groups named. 
When the bowel action has become 
regular, the milk period should be re- 
duced, and the breadless diet extended 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 443 

until the milk is entirely withdrawn. 
(See "Emaciation— The Remedy/'p. 482). 
Man undoubtedly sprang from anthro- 
poid stock. His original position of loco- 
Hernia due to ^lotion was upon his four 
abdominal feet. The intcstiues, there- 
pressure ^^^^^ rcstcd upou a flexible 

belly surface, but since he has risen and 
changed his two front paws into hands, 
the intestines are inclined, with every 
step, to sag to the bottom of the abdom- 
inal cavity, and are prevented from so 
doing only by small ligaments attached 
to the abdominal walls. Hernia or rup- 
ture is exceedingly common owing to this 
downward pressure in the lower part of 
the abdominal cavity. The position main- 
tained while walking, therefore, is not 
conducive to the relief of that pressure 
in the abdomen, which is the direct cause 
of hernia, and often the cause of very 
stubborn intestinal congestion. 

It is obvious, therefore, that this condi- 
tion needs remedial exercise. It will be 



444 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

observed that all the movements given in 
the lesson on "Exercise and Re-creation" 

Remedial and ^™S the trunk tO a hori- 

counteractive zontal position with the 
body leaning forward. All of 
these movements are designed to coun- 
teract this abdominal pressure. 

I go thus into detail for the purpose of 
showing the great necessity of these 
Exercise a ne- excrciscs, especially in cases 
count'ericting p^ coustipatiou, and of insist- 
constipation ing that they be executed 
vigorously and regularly. The most bene- 
ficial diet that could be prescribed will not 
relieve and cure constipation unless it is 
supplemented by certain remedial exercises 
or movements. This is true because Na- 
ture contemplates a certain amount of 
motion exactly as she contemplates a 
certain amount of nutrition, and her laws 
governing motion are just as mandatory 
and her penalties just as certain. 

Nutrition is of more importance be- 
cause it is more fundamental, and it is 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 445 

more fundamental because when the body 

is naturally nourished, there is created 

a surplus amount of energy 

Proper nourish- i . i mi i i • 

ment promotes which Will compcl a ccrtam 
natural desire amouut of motiou, and this

m turn will cause deep or 
full breathing. Therefore the well-fed 
person will take his exercise because he 
has an appetite for it, or because the 
superabundance of energy forces him to 
do it in obedience to the same law that 
produces hunger. Hence the perfectly 
nourished body will conform automati- 
cally to the other two great physical laws 
of motion and of oxidation.

GASTRITIS 

Gastritis is a word meant to describe 
a chronic and a painful condition of 
stomach and of intestinal irritation. 
When the stomach becomes much irri- 
tated from constant fermentation of food, 
and from the resultant presence of acid, 



448 ENCYCLOPEDU OF DIET 

certain articles such as milk, fruit-acids, 
and starchy foods will cause rapid accu- 
mulation of gas, which becomes exceed- 
ingly painful and sometimes dangerous. 
The majority of deaths from so-called 
heart-failure is caused directly by the 
accumulation of gas from the 

Gas, the pn- . c p i • 

mary cause of lermentmg mass of tood in 
heart trouble ^j^^ stomach and in the in- 
testines. These organs become greatly 
inflated, and their pressure against all 
the vital organs, and against the arteries 
leading into and out of the lungs and 
the heart so impair the circulation that 
the heart action becomes very irregular 
— first slow and faint; sometimes skipping 
a beat, and again violent and palpitating. 
When the congested blood spurts through 
into the heart it is called "arterial over- 
flow," and the old diagnostician seems 
to have been content with giving this a 
name. It is certain they have not yet 
given the world a remedy, as the regular 
profession is still prescribing such drugs 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 449 

as bicarbonate of soda, bismuth subni- 
trate, and nux vomica, none of which can 
give more than temporary rehef, and that 
is accomphshed by neutrahzing the acid 
at the tremendous expense of the cells 
that secrete it. 

GASTRITIS— THE CAUSE 

Gastritis is caused: 

1 By the use of stimulants 

2 Irritating foods, condiments, etc. 

3 Overeating, especially of acid 

fruits, starches and sweets 

4 Cirrhosis of the liver is some- 

times one of the secondary 
causes of gastritis 

GASTRITIS— THE SYMPTOMS 

The symptoms are usually a dull pain 
in the region of the stomach and upper 
intestines, a swollen full feeling, now and 
then biting pains, followed by a dark 



450 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

vomit, especially when the attack comes 
late at night. 

Gastritis is often confused with gastric 
cancer, and in diagnosis it is difficult to 
speak with authority as to whether the 
case is ordinary gastritis, as above de- 
scribed, gastric ulcer, or gastric cancer. 
The diagnostician in making up his 
opinion must be governed largely by the 
time the condition has endured, and the 
immediate causes, giving especial care 
to the food and drink that has been con- 
sumed just prior to the attack. 

GASTRITIS— THE REMEDY 

In severe cases the patient should be 
given a quart of cool water, and this 
should be removed with a stomach pump. 
This might be repeated two or three 
times within a period of three or four 
hours. 

All food should be omitted for at least 
twenty -four hours, then the patient should 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 451 

be given vegetable juice prepared as 
follows: 

Grind spinach, carrots, squash, 
or turnips, any two or three of 
these, very fine; cook about ten 
minutes in enough water to make 
a pint of thin vegetable soup. Put 
through a colander; strain through 
a coarse cloth, discarding the pulp. 
Give this to the patient every 
two hours in quantities not more 
than one or two ounces, dependent 
upon the condition. 

The diet may be varied by changing 
vegetables, always selecting one green 
plant such as spinach, lettuce, beet or 
turnip-tops. As the patient improves 
more of the pulp may be used. After 
the second or third day a thin puree 
may be used, care being exercised not 
to overfeed. 

In milder cases the patient should be 
fed after the same methods, only more 
of the vegetable pulp may be used, there- 



ut 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 



by increasing the strength of the diet after 
four or five days; or, when the patient 
Food to be shows signs of Substantial 
^eatm^nl^of rccovery, egg whites, baked 
gastritis potatoes, and the ordinary 

fresh vegetables may be given in moder- 
ate quantities. 

Inasmuch as stomach fermentation is 
the beginning or parent cause of gastritis, 
the causes, symptoms, and menus given 
for fermentation would apply in cases of 
gastritis, limiting the quantity of food 
according to the severity of the condition. 
In cases of gastritis:

NERVOUS INDIGESTION 

There are millions of nerve fibers lead- 
ing out from the stomach and alimentary 
Mental effects ^^^^^ to cvcry part of the 
of nervous- auatomy, so that the nervous 
°*^* connection, especially be- 

tween the stomach and the brain, is very 
direct and sensitive. The stomach seems 
to bear the same relation to the brain 
that a basket bears to a balloon so far 
as their nervous connection is concerned. 
Thus it is that the irritated stomach 
produces an irritable temper, insomnia, 
forgetfulness, and a lack of ability to 
concentrate the thoughts. These are 
the milder symptoms or first warnings. 



454 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

NERVOUS INDIGESTION— THE CAUSE 

The use of stimulants or narcotics, 
such as tea, coffee, hquor and tobacco 
are most prohfic causes of nervousness. 
These drugs act upon the body in a dual 
capacity: (1) They excite or raise the 
nervous system above normal, only to 
drop it below when the reaction takes 
place. (2) In addition to this, they irri- 
tate the stomach and the intestines by 
causing superacidity. 

Nervousness ' caused by sedatives and 
narcotics acts both upon the mental and 
the physical organism, and the source 
of such nervousness can be easily traced 
by ascertaining the habits of the patient. 
When the patient has used stimulants 
and narcotics long enough to cause 
Abnormal ap- ncrvousuess, the mucous 
swells ^and membrane of the stomach is 
starches usually in a state of irrita- 

tion. The presence of blood, under these 
conditions, causes abnormal appetite, 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 455 

frequently followed by overeating, espe- 
cially of sweets, starches, and acids, for 
which the patient usually has a great 
craving. This is followed by fermenta- 
tion, and comes into or envelops super- 
acidity and must necessarily be classed 
with it. 

Overeating and the constant use of 
stimulants and narcotics will, after a time, 
cause a chronic state of fermentation, 
and the stomach will seldom be free from 
acid, the constant presence of which will 
ultimately cause gastric ulcer, and per- 
haps stomach carcinoma. 



NERVOUS INDIGESTION— THE SYMPTOMS 

The more advanced stages of stomach 
irritation which are expressed by ner- 
vousness cause melancholia 

Nature's final j i l p • 

symptoms ^^d a gloomy sort of pessi- 
mism. These are among the 
last signals the stomach gives to the brain 



456 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

before final collapse, and if these signals 
are not heeded, the victim may expect to 
go down in the maelstrom of nervous 
prostration within twelve months from 
the time the first signals are given. These 
fits or spells of melancholia often come on 
suddenly. The palms of the hands be- 
come moist with a cold, clammy perspi- 
ration, and the mind is flooded with a 
train of thoughts such as "What's the 
use' of living.^" "Why all this struggle 
for mere existence.^" The victim of this 
condition invariably believes that his 
mind is becoming affected; that he is 
becoming insane, and will soon be a 
public charge, and shunned by those 
whom he loves. While under these spells 
many people take their own lives rather 
than face what they believe to be insanity 
and ostracism. 

The patient should be made acquainted 
with his true condition, and shown that 
it is only temporary, and that all such 
thoughts are mere mental aberrations 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 457 

which will disappear when the causes of 
stomach irritation are removed. 

The above-named symptoms always 
point with certainty to an irritated 
stomach, the severity of which can be 
determined by the symptoms above de- 
scribed. 

Stomach irritation is expressed largely 
through the mind, as in irritability, ner- 
DifiFerence be- vousucss and melancholia, 
l:dta«r«'.f while intestmal irritation 
irritation is generally expressed by 

some 'physical symptom, such as rest- 
lessness, twitching of the muscles 
and a general lack of physical tran- 
quillity. 

There is another form of nervousness 
believed to be caused by overwork, busi- 
ness worries, etc. With these opinions 
the writer does not agree. If the body is 
properly fed one is not likely to over- 
work. Nature w ill demand rest, and sleep 
will come while at the desk, or when 
following the plow. 



458 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Investigators are much divided on the 
question of whether worry causes su- 
peracidity, or superacidity 
wusfoftorry causcs worry. The experi- 
ence of the writer in treating 
several thousand cases of stomach acid- 
ity has proved beyond a doubt that acid 
fermentation and stomach irritation are 
the primary causes, and what is com- 
monly called "worry" is merely a symp- 
tom or result of this condition. It is quite 
evident, therefore, that all forms of ner- 
vousness must go back to the food 
question for final solution. 

NERVOUS INDIGESTION— THE REMEDY 

Nervous indigestion should be treated 
as follows: 

1 The patient should employ his 

time in pleasant but useful 
occupation 

2 As to diet, omit the following: 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 459 

All red meats 
Acid fruits 
Bread and cereals 
Condiments 
Pickles 

Such as — 

Candies 

Cane or maple-sugar 

Dates and figs 

Desserts and pastries of all 

kinds 
Sirups 



3 The diet should consist of — 



An abundance of green salads 
Baked potatoes 

(Including the skins) 
Egg whites 
Fats — limited quantity — 

Such as — 
Dairy butter 
Nut butter 
Olive-oil 

Nuts 

Fresh vegetables — not canned 
Beana 



Legumes 



Lentils 



460 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 
In cases of Nervous Indigestion: 



OMIT BAT 

Acid fniits Baked potatoes 

Bread and cereals Fate (limited quantity) 

Coffee and tea Fresh vegetables 

Condiments Green salads 

Desserts and pastries Legumes 

Pickles Limited quantity of milk 

Red meats (preferably sour) 

Stimulants of all kinds White of eggs 

Sweets 

Tobacco 



The experience of the writer for many 
years has been that the fewer the articles 
composing the diet, the better the progress 
could be made in treating nervous indiges- 
tion. In many instances, the mono-diet 
system (eating only one kind of food at a 
meal) has been adopted with excellent 
results. 

SUBACIDITY 

Indigestion is a term used to describe 
the condition caused by food remaining 



ENCYCLOPEDU OF DIET 461 

in the stomach over Nature's time-limit. 
In such cases there is usually a lack of 
hydrochloric acid. This disorder is some- 
times called hyperchlorhydria. The ex- 
pression of indigestion, which is a lack of 
acid, and the expression superacidity or 
hyperchlorhydria, which is too much 
acid, are often confusing, inasmuch as 
both conditions cause a feeling of heavi- 
ness or a lump in the stomach. (See 
"Superacidity, p. 419.) 



SUBACIDITY— THE CAUSE 

The most prolific cause of subacidity 
is sedentary habits or lack of activity. 
This is especially true of young people, 
while in adults, or those who have passed 
forty, the usual cause is incorrect eating, 
or an unbalanced diet. 

Another cause of subacidity is the 
overconsumption of flesh foods. Flesh 
requires considerable acid for dissolution; 



462 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

sometimes more than is normally supplied 
by the stomach, and consequently results 
in indigestion or non-dissolution. 

The over-consumption of either starchy 
foods or sweets may produce the same 
result. It is therefore obvious that this 
particular disorder is caused primarily 
either by overeating or by an unbalanced 
dietary. 



SUBACIDITY— THE SYMPTOMS 

Brown coating on the tongue — 
The white coating on the 
tongue always indicates too 
much acid, hence predigestion; 
while the brown coating indi- 
cates insufficient acid, hence 
indigestion. The white coating 
shows the action of the acid on 
the stomach lining, while the 
brown coating shows the decom- 
position of food matter in the 
stomach, usually accompanied 
by an offensive breath. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 463 

2 Gas in the stomach — 

Gas sometimes appears in the 
stomach immediately after eat- 
ing. This shows that food, in a 
state of fermentation, remains 
in the stomach from a previous 
meal. It also shows that the 
stomach may be prolapsed ; that 
is, dropped down below its nor- 
mal level. A sort of pocket is 
thus frequently formed in which 
a small quantity of food remains 
from one meal to another, caus- 
ing an immediate formation of 
gas after eating. 



SUBACIDITY— THE REMEDY 

The logical remedy is to limit the 
amount of food to the actual require- 
ments of the body, and especially to 
balance the daily bill of fare in conformity 
to the chemistry of nutrition. 

In cases of chronic indigestion or im- 
poverished acid secretions, it often be- 



464 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

comes necessary to prescribe a counterac- 
tive diet, the composition of which should 

be determined by the cause 
S'»b.:.r« of the disorder. If the 

cause be over-consumption 
of meat, the patient should be given a 
breakfast of acid fruits, and nuts and 
salads; while if the cause be over-con- 
sumption of starchy foods, all legumes 
and grain products of every kind should 
be omitted, and a diet of subacid fruits, 
an abundance of green salads, and even 
some flesh now and then, such as tender 
fish or fowl, should be prescribed. 

In all cases the special object should 
be to prescribe an amount of food for 
the first few days somewhat below the 
normal requirements of the body, and 
after the counteractive diet has been 
taken for three or four days, the menu 
should be balanced daily as to nutritive 
elements. By observance of these rules, 
together with a reasonable observance of 
the laws of exercise, fresh air and deep 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 465 

breathing, the most obstinate cases of 
indigestion or subacidity can be overcome. 
In cases of Subacidity: 

OMIT EAT 

Cereals All acid fruita with meals 

Coffee and tea Buttermilk 

Flesh foods Fish 

Liquors Fresh vegetables 

Sweets Potatoes 

Tobacco Sautem wine, sparingly 

White bread Succulent plants 

Tea 

Tomatoes 

Wheat bran 

Whole wheat

BILIOUSNESS 

Biliousness is the supersecretion of bile; 
that is to say, more of this fluid is secreted 
by the liver than is required for the 
ordinary processes of digestion, and the 
excess passes into the stomach. 



466 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

BILIOUSNESS— THE CAUSE 

Biliousness is caused, in a majority of 
cases, by the overconsumption of fats, 
milk, eggs, and sweets, or by taking 
stimulants, especially such as malted or 
brewed liquors. 

BILIOUSNESS— THE SYMPTOMS 

The presence of bile in the stomach 
interferes with the stomach-secretion, 
thus causing faulty digestion and severe 
headache, usually starting at the back 
of the head and ending in a severe pain 
over the eyes. The complexion becomes 
sallow and there is a general decline in 
strength and vitality. 

BILIOUSNESS— THE REMEDY 

The logical remedy is to remove the 
above causes by eliminating from the 
diet such articles as tea, coffee, distilled, 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 467 

brewed and malted liquors of every 
character, and sweets, selecting such 
foods as will give to the body all the 
elements of nutrition, and so combining 
them as to furnish these elements in the 
right proportions. 

(See menus for "Constipation," Vol. 
Ill, p. 761). 

In cases of Biliousness: 



Coffee and tea 


Bananas 


Cream 


Coarse cereals 


Egg yolks 


Egg whites 


Fats 


Fresh vegetables 


Intoxicants 


Fruit 


Milk 


Melons 


Sweets 


Nuts 


Wines and liquors of all 


Succulent plants 


kinds 


Wheat bran 



CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER 

THE CAUSE 

Cirrhosis of the liver, or Hannot's Dis- 
ease, is a condition of chronic inactivity 



468 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

in which the liver secretions are stored 
to excess from overeating, and are not 
thrown off generally on account of seden- 
tary habits or inactivity. 

Next to the stomach the liver is prob- 
ably the most abused of all the vital 
organs. It is called upon to secrete all 
the surplus blood-sugar and to emulsify 
all fats taken into the stomach. The bile 
is largely drawn upon to combat narcotic 
and alcoholic poisons, therefore that 
condition called cirrhosis of the liver 
may be caused by the over-consumption 
of sweets, excessive use of alcoholic 
stimulants, together with the overcon- 
sumption of heavy foods such as red 
meats, cereals, white bread, acid fruits, 
or all of these errors may combine to 
cause cirrhosis. 

CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER— THE SYMPTOMS 

The symptoms are usually pain in the 
epigastrium; nausea and sometimes vom- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 469 

iting in the morning; general loss of 
vitality and ambition ; sallow complex- 
ion. A dull aching or a throbbing pain 
is often experienced, followed by a heavy, 
sluggish feeling, especially on rising in 
the morning. Alternate constipation and 
diarrhea, and a perceptible enlargement 
of the liver are frequent symptoms. 



CIRRHOSIS OP THE LIVER— THE TREATMENT 

The diet should consist largely of fresh 
vegetables, nuts, salads and all edible 
succulent plants; also a limited quantity 
of the non-acid and of the milder acid 
fruits such as apples, peaches, plums, 
grapes, pears, including bananas, which 
are excellent when baked. 

The heavier vegetables, such as green 
corn, potatoes, and all the legumes may 
be used moderately. 

A liberal service of plain wheat bran 
should be taken at least twice a week 



470 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 



in order to insure active intestinal peri- 
stalsis. 

All stimulants, narcotics, sweets, condi- 
ments and irritating foods of every 
character should be omitted. The pa- 
tient should drink copiously of pure 
water at meals, omitting all other bever- 
ages. 

In cases of Cirrhosis of the Liver:

Limited quantity of — 
Apples Peaches 
Bananas Pears 
Grapes Plums

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 471 

Cirrhosis of the hver is in most cases 
caused by the overconsumption of sweets, 
starches, fats and intoxicating beverages. 
Sweet and starchy foods should be hm- 
ited and intoxicants of all kinds should 
be entirely omitted. An abundance of 
pure water should be taken at meals. 



PILES OR HEMORRHOIDS 

THE CAUSE 

Piles or hemorrhoids are usually the 
result of chronic constipation; or, they 
may occur from violent exercise, or a 
shock. The straining at stool when con- 
stipated has a most potent influence 
in causing piles, as well as the passage 
of hard, dry feces. In both of these cases 
the rectal mucous surfaces are torn loose 
or detached from -the supporting walls, 
and the cells fill with blood, thereby 
becoming very greatly distended. 



472 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 



PILES OR HEMORRHOIDS— THE SYMPTOMS 

The first symptoms are usually itching 
of the mucous miembrane of the anus. 
In the second stage a bloody discharge 
will appear with the feces, and in the 
more advanced cases the rectal mucous 
membrane will protrude. 



PILES OR HEMORRHOIDS— THE TREATMENT 



When it is first discovered that there 

is a slight protrusion of the rectal mucous 

How to relieve membrane from the anus, 

ot%hrrectT great care should be taken 

lining in evacuation of the feces. 

The first or direct cause of this condition 

is usually congestion; that is, the feces 

in the rectal cavity forms into a hard 

mass. When this condition appears, 

just before each evacuation, inject into 

the rectum, with a small rectal syringe, 

a tablespoonful of olive-oil, followed by 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 473 

a pint or two of lukewarm water, taken 
as an ordinary enema, and retain two or 
three minutes. Then place the first and 
the middle fingers, one on each side of 
the anus, and press gently so as to relieve 
the strain upon the rectal lining. The 
feces, if very hard, can be worked back 
and forth until broken up, and evacuation 
made easy. By this means 1 have known 
many cases of bleeding piles or hemor- 
rhoids to be permanently cured. 

It is exceedingly difficult to cure chronic 
cases in which the membrane has been 
torn from the walls for many years. 
However, Nature never tires of doing 
her work of repair, and if these sug^ 
gestions are religiously observed, even 
chronic cases can be greatly relieved, and 
sometimes permanently cured. 

For diet, see menus for constipation 
and fermentation. 

Every night, just before retiring, take 
a light enema and retain it over night; 
also, take an enema just after rising. 



474 ENCYCLOPEDL\ OF DIET 

DIARRHEA 
THE CAUSE 

Diarrhea is in reality not a dis-ease, but 
a symptom behind which there are always 
primary causes, usually — 

1 Overeating 

2 Irritating condiments 

3 Wrong combinations of food at 

meals 

4 Poisonous laxative drugs 

5 Excess of acids 

6 Excess of sweets 

7 Sometimes nervous excitement 

Diarrhea caused by the last-named 
condition is usually of temporary dura- 
tion. Sudden attacks of diarrhea are 
often caused by exposure, by changes of 
diet, or by the overconsumption of acids 
in the form of berries.

of diarrhea ^^^ ^^jj ^^^^^^ ^^ dySCnterV. 

This condition is most generally caused 
by chronic fermentation, or by the pres- 
ence of some non-nutritive or foreign 
substance. It matters not whether this 
condition comes from the use of poison- 
ous drugs called laxative remedies, or 
from foods containing foreignor non- 
nutritive substances, the result is the 
same. 

The habitual taking of drugs suffi- 
ciently poisonous to cause the intestina:l 
machinery to exert enough action to 
cast them out, is a painful and slow 
process of self-destruction. It frequently 
happens that the peristaltic muscles be- 
come relaxed and give way completely 
from the habitual use of poisonous ca- 
thartics, and chronic diarrhea or dysen- 
tery is the result. 



476 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 



DIARRHEA— THE TREATMENT 

In ordinary cases of diarrhea one can 
pursue his usual work provided he ob- 
serves the suggestions in regard to diet, 
given below, but in severe cases one should 
avoid labor or exercise, and remain most 
of the time in a reclining position. Drink 
copiously of pure water, and eat very 
sparingly. 



Acid fruits 

All green salads 

Coarse foods, such as cab- 
bage, celery, turnips, 
spinach

EMACIATION OR UNDERWEIGHT 

Underweight, or lack of adipose tissue, 
is a condition w4th which the practitioner 
will often have to deal, as under nearly all 
abnormal conditions of the body, called 
dis-ease, the first result or evidence is loss 
of weight. 

The tendency of a perfectly normal 
body, after it passes the forty-fifth year, 
is to become muscular, or what is termed 
"thin." In all countries those who have 
lived to a very great age have been 
termed emaciated. However, there is a 
normal body-weight that can be main- 
tained, and which indicates normal health. 

Emaciation is usually followed by gen- 
eral anemia and a weakening 

ffrJatiJa of nearly all the functions 

of the body. The memory, 

sight, hearing, all become impaired, while 



478 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

the taste or appetite usually becomes 
keener or more sensitive. This is caused 
by irritation of the mucous membrane of 
the stomach and the consequent presence 
of too much blood therein, the same as 
when intoxicating liquors are taken just 
before meals. 

Overwork, loss of sleep, unbalanced 
diet, worry, grief, or a period of extreme 
emotional tension, all have a tendency 
to disturb and derange the processes of 
metabolism. Under these conditions the 
body is very likely to lose weight, but 
there is always a fundamental cause 
which should be discovered and re- 
moved. 

EMACIATION OR UNDERWEIGHT— 
THE CAUSE 

There are a number of things which 
usually conspire to cause emaciation. 
Named in the order of their generality, 
they are as follows: 



I 



A.. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 479 

1 Overeating 

2 Superacidity 

3 Stomach and intes- 

tinal fermentation 

Physical 

causes of 4 CoHStipatlOn 

emaciation 

5 Autointoxication 

6 Under-drinking of 

pure water 

7 The use of tobacco, 

coffee and tea 

All of these things tend to cause mal- 
assimilation, which is the secondary cause 
of emaciation. In a majority of cases the 
loss of weight begins while the body is 
surfeited with food. In fact, it is nothing 
uncommon for those suffering most from 
this condition to consume from three to 
four times the necessary Cjuantity of 
food; overeating becomes a habit, and 
consequent fermentation and toxic sub- 



480 ENCYCLOPEDLi OF DIET 

stances, usually known as autointoxica- 
tion, are the results. 

The causes of emaciation, according to 
most authorities, are impoverished blood 
and malnutrition. With these opinions 
the writer fully agrees, but the intelligent 
reader will naturally inquire — What are 
the causes of impoverished blood and 
malnutrition.^ The answer goes directly 
back to the food question. 

All mental influences, business, social, 
or financial worry, contribute their share 
toward phvsical emaciation, 
.lr.'cL'°:r but when 'the body is per- 
fectly nourished it is more 
capable of withstanding these drains 
because it is made fearless by perfect 
health. Behind all forms of business 
and financial trouble is the demon *'fear," 
and fear rests on the uncertainty of our 
ability to provide creature comforts and 
necessities; therefore when we have mas- 
tered the science of feeding our bodies, 
and have learned how simply and cheaply 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 481 

this may be done, the mere possession 
of such knowledge does more than all 
else to make of us philosophers and 
students, eliminating fear and worry of 
every kind, as in health the mind is 
usually in a state of optimism and 
tranquillity. 

EMACIATION OR UNDERWEIGHT— THE 

SYMPTOMS 

The symptoms of emaciation, of course, 
are so apparent that it is only necessary 
to say that when the above-named errors 
are corrected, and the following symptoms 
are observed, the normal weight can 
nearly always be maintained. 

So-called cold-sores, fevered lips and 
canker-sores on the tongue, intestinal 
congestion, torpidity of the liver, slight 
headaches, fullness after eating, alter- 
nate constipation and diarrhea, are all 
symptoms that point to the causes of 
emaciation. 



482 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

EMACIATION OR UNDERWEIGHT— THE 
REMEDY 

Emaciation is sometimes caused by- 
organic or hereditary dis-eases, but the 
usual causes are to be found within the 
field of dietetics. The remedy, therefore, 
is first to naturalize or normalize the diet 
as to quantity, selection, proportion, and 
combinations of food. 

In the majority of cases, those who 
come to the food scientist for treatment 
will be those who have tried every con- 
ceivable remedy except the natural one, 
therefore they come in a chronic state 
of emaciation, poisoned bj^ overeating. 
Never having been instructed in regard 
to diet, exercise, breathing, bathing, or 
any other hygienic law, they will, in most 
cases, require a counteractive or remedial 
diet. There may be a number of supple- 
mentary causes to be considered, but the 
most important things for the practi- 
tioner to ascertain are: 



ENCYCLOPEDL\ OF DIET 483 

1 Time the patient rises 

2 Hour the first meal is eaten 

3 Of what that meal consists 

4 Time the second meal is eaten 

5 Of what the second meal consists 

6 Time the third meal is eaten 

7 Of what this meal consists 

8 All mental influences under 

which the patient is laboring, 
especially fear or worry 

9 The condition of the bowels as 

to congestion 

10 The amount of liquid taken 
during the day and at meals 



484 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

In nearly all emaciated cases it will 
be found that the patient is suffering 
from premature fermentation, intestinal 
and stomach gas, and a congested condi- 
tion of the bowels commonly known as 
constipation. 

The first remedy lies in the selection 
and the combination of foods which are 
Foods that are readily soluble and assimi- 
t"e"ratLint l^blc, and which coutaiu the 
of emaciation bcst flcsh and cell-buildiug 
properties. The chemical properties or 
elements most necessary are albumin, 
phosphorus, casein, proteids and carbo- 
hydrates. These elements are supplied 
best by milk, eggs, nuts, sweet fruits and 
coarse cereals, followed by a limited 
quantity of fresh green vegetables.

diet for the emaciated, it is vitally im- 
portant to avoid constipation, which 
may be done by giving milk during the 
first two or three days in quantities 
ranging from two and one-half to three 
and one-half quarts a day, together with 
a liberal quantity of coarse cereal. (See 
"Constipation— The Remedy," p. 436.)

It sometimes happens that the body 
is thrown into a chronic state of emacia- 
Chronic emaci- tion on account of a Catarrhal 
causTand formation over the mucous 
remedy membrane of the intestines, 

which closes the "winking valves" that 
take up nutriment from the alimentary 
tract. In such cases coarse cereal or 
wheat bran, the seeds and skins of fruit, 
especially grapes, together with milk and 
eggs, form the best foods known. The 
milk and the eggs may be forced, not only 
beyond the hmitations of hunger, but 
beyond the normal needs of the body. 
By thus forcing them for a short period 
of time (twenty to thirty days) a physical 
*'trial balance" can be reached, and the 
body brought to its normal weight, which 
can be maintained for an indefinite period 
of time, if the bill of fare is again balanced 
or leveled according to the chemical 
requirements governed by the three nat- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 487 

ural laws, namely, age, temperature of 
environment, and work. 

There is another condition of chronic 
emaciation which, in the beginning,

ated cases For instancc, when the forc- 
ing of casein proteids, albumin and ni- 
trogen (the principal nutrient elements 
in milk and eggs) produces complications, 
such as extreme constipation, it becomes 
necessary to put the patient on a diet 
composed of coarse cellulose articles and 
fruit for a period of from three to six 
days. This should be done in the 
following manner: 

Immediately on rising drink two or 
three cups of water — lime-free. 

BREAKFAST

The strained juice of two or three sweet oranges, 
or a bunch of grapes; grapes preferred 

A cup of wheat bran, cooked ; serve hot, with

488 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 



LUNCHEON 

Plain wheat and an equal quantity of coarse 
wheat bran, cooked until very soft; preferably 
simmered over night 

A salad of celery, lettuce and tomatoes, with 
nuts 



About four tablespoonfuls of boiled wheat; 
also one of bran 
A baked potato 
One fresh vegetable 

Drink copiously of water at all 
meals. 

Just before retiring, eat half a 
pound of grapes, when in season. 

After the first or second day this 
bill of fare may be increased in 
quantity, and heavier fruits added, 
such as pears, prunes, and very 
ripe bananas. After the fourth or 
fifth day, a salad and a few of the 
lighter vegetables, such as onions, 
romaine or cabbage, celery, carrots, 
or other fibrous vegetables may be 
included. 

After the first week the diet 
should be composed of fresh vege- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 489 

tables, coarse cereals, eggs, ba- 
nanas, nuts, salads, and wheat 
bran. 

Those who are emaciated should drink 
an abundance of water immediately on 
rising and at meals. They should also 
take a sufficient quantity of plain wheat 
bran, or grapes if in season (Concord 
preferred), eating skins, seeds, and pulp, 
in order to keep the bowels in normal 
condition. 

In cases of extreme emaciation, loss of 
appetite, or fermentation, the patient 
should, for a time, adopt a diet of milk 
and eggs, alternating as follows: 

The first, second, and third days, 
drink from two and a half to four 
quarts of milk, in small quantities 
— one glass at a time. For the 
next three days, reduce the quan- 
tity of milk, and begin taking six 
eggs a day, increasing the number, 
until twelve eggs are taken. Al- 
ternate between the milk and the 
eggs, for a month or more, unless 



490 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 



the patient responds in weight in 
a shorter time. When there is a 
perceptible gain in weight, and 
normal hunger has been restored, 
reduce the milk and the eggs, and 
add the solid foods already sug- 
gested. 

In cases of Emaciation:

OBESITY— THE CAUSE 

A very exhausting treatise could be 
written upon the cause of obesity, but, 
summing it all up briefly, corpulency is 
invariably induced through a direct or 
indirect violation of the laws of nutrition, 
as exemplified in their wonderful pro- 
cesses of transforming material called 
food into pulsating life. 

A combination of commissions and 
omissions generally conspire to produce 
the obese body. They may be mentioned 
in the order of their importance : 

1 Overingestion of fat-producing 
foods 



2 Omission of the proper amount 
of motion or exercise 



3 Imperfect oxidation (breathing) 

4 The overconsumption of fluids 



494 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 



In every case of obesity, one or more 

of these causes are present. If one is 

Obesity blessed with good digestion 

caused by and good assimilation, or, in 

overeating ^^j^^^, ^^^.^^^ jj ^jj ^^^ ^^^^^_ 

ment taken into the body is absorbed 
into the tissues, then the quantity must 
be regulated by one's work or labor, 
otherwise any excess of fat-producing 
food is stored up by provident Nature, 
contemplating future use; and if it is 
not used, by actual work, the result is 
a gradual accumulation of fatty tissue. 
Again, if a quantity of food commensu- 
rate only with the requirements of men- 
tal labor be consumed, and only ordinary 
body-activity indulged in, there is likely 
to be a gradual decrease in weight, 
because a considerable percentage of 
energy is consumed by the mere carrying 
on of the vital processes. 

The worst form of obesity, however, 
is that caused by overconsumption of 
fermented wines or malted liquors. This 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 495 

form of enlarged tissue contributes no 

strength whatever to its own support. 

Obesity It is as much of a dead 

toSnJ*^ weight as a hod of mortar, 

malted uquors and much more useless; in 

fact, all forms of obesity are not only 

useless weight, but dangerous to life. 

The obese body is much more liable to 

contagious and infectious dis-eases, and 

when once affected, less able to defend 

itself than the normal body. 

OBESITY— THE REMEDY 

The control of body-weight rests upon 
three distinct and separate laws, the first 
and most important of which is nutrition, 
the second exercise, and the third oxida- 
tion. 

While at the outset body-weight may 

be controlled by increasing the amount

lyilbSo?'' the surplus which Nature is 

activity storiug away, if however, the

496 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

then the storing process becomes chronic, 
and radical remedies both in regard to 
dietetics and activity must be appHed 
in order to bring the body back to 
normal. 

A man of normal weight, say 150 
pounds, doing ordinary work in a tropical 
Amount of fat country, would not need to

climates of fat cach twcuty-f our hours, 

while the same man in a northern cli- 
mate, where the thermometer ranges 
from zero to 20 below, could use up, 
with similar labor, from three to four 
ounces of pure fat daily. Fats, however, 
do not produce fat in the human body 
unless taken largely in excess of its needs. 
Their primary purpose is to keep up the 
temperature of the body. 

Where the weight is only from ten to 
^. . fifteen pounds above normal. 

Dietetic sug- . , , .

ing the diet, but where the accumulation 






ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 497 

of adipose tissue has become chronic, 
and the body has taken on from twenty 
to fifty pounds, or more, above normal, 
then a diet composed largely of non-acid 
fruits and fresh vegetables should be 
adopted for a period of from twenty to 
thirty days. 

Carbohydrates, that is to say starch 
and sugar, are the principal fat-making 

nutrients, and all people in- 
pr^o^duce^fat cliued to take on abnormal 

weight, as a rule, are very 
fond of, and eat an excess of starchy 
foods. A great amount of the casein in 
milk and the phosphorus in eggs are 
converted into fat, especially if a quantity 
be taken in excess of the amount used 
in effort or work. The fat-producing 
staple foods are: 



All cereal products Eggs 
All legumes Milk 

Bread Potatoes 



498 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 



Foods that 
reduce fat 



In order, therefore, to remove the 
causes of obesity, one must begin with 
the diet. 

Eliminate meat and animal fat; ascer- 
tain as nearly as possible the amount of 
carbohydrates necessary for 
each day and take none in 
excess of this quantity. This 
will stop the accumulation of fatty tis- 
sue. If the body is obese, and a reduc- 
tion of weight is desired, the diet should 
consist of nuts, fruits, salads, fresh vege- 
tables, and a very limited quantity of 
eggs, omitting starchy foods entirely. 
After a week or two of this diet, discon- 
tinue the use of eggs, reducing the diet 
entirely to nuts, fruits, fresh vegetables 
and salads, which in nearly every case 
will bring a very substantial reduction 
in weight, even if the patient takes but 
little exercise and fresh air. If, however, 
he can be induced to adopt the above 
diet, and at the same time take two hours' 
moderate exercise, either in gymnastics 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 499 

or useful labor, with a reasonable amount 
of exposure to fresh air, the reduction in 
weight will be greater, and the muscular 
tissue and vitality will increase. 

Inasmuch as fat contributes no item 
of strength to its own support, if the 
patient will take a reasonable amount 
of exercise and fresh air, muscular tissue 
will increase in the same ratio that fatty 
tissue decreases. 

The menus for obesity may be varied 

according to the fruits and vegetables 

„ at one's command. Fish

The symptoms during the first two or

perhaps hunger, leaving the impression 
of under-nourishment. This will disap-

strength will not only return to normal, 
but the body will feel more energetic 
than before, and there will be a marked 
increase in the powers of endurance. If 
the patient can be induced to "fight it

symptoms will develop so fast that the

NEURASTHENIA 

That disorder of the nerves known as 
neurasthenia is expressed in general ane- 
mia, or a breaking down of the nervous 
vitaUty. This does not indicate, however, 
that neurasthenia is wholly a dis-ease of 
the nerves ; it merely means that through 
the nerves the symptoms are given to 
the brain. 

Neurasthenia is a signal or warning 
given by the united voice of all the func- 

Neurasthenia ^'^^^ ^^ digCStioU, SCCrctioU, 

a last or final and cxcretiou. Therefore, 
warning ^j^-^ (^igQj-^jgj. (Jqcs uot appear 

until the body has given fair warning 
in many other ways, and if proper heed 
had been given the preceding signals, the 
nerves would have performed their func- 
tions without an outcry. 

Every so-called dis-ease of the human 
body, especially of the nervous system, 
is in reahty the voice of Nature telling 
us of our mistakes, and giving us the 



504 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

opportunity to correct them. Dis-ease, 
therefore, is not an enemy to the race, 
but a friend. It is an effort, as it were, 
in our behalf, of provident Nature to 
prevent race extinction. 

Nearly every seeming misfortune with 
which we are afflicted can be turned to 
our benefit. We never take a step up- 
ward until we are mentally prepared for 
it; we never become mentally prepared 
until we have passed through a certain 
amount and kind of experience. 

Education reduced to its last analysis 
is merely the accumulation and co-ordi- 
nation of useful knowledge; 

defined"" uscful knowledge is accu- 
mulated only by and through 
the art of comparison. The more expe- 
rience we have, the more comparisons 
we can make. 

Country-raised people control the great 
industries of the city and lead in the 
nation's great work because they never 
become blase. They have always their 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 505 

homely and primitive child life to draw 
upon for comparisons. Every good 
Ability to make thing, cvcry invention, every 
m3rlrabii- step forward and upward, 
ity to enjoy evcry advancement is appre- 
ciated and realized exactly according to 
their ability to compare these things with 
their opposites. 

If the patient should be suffering from 
mental disturbances called worry, he 
should be reminded that he is merely a 
floating mote in the abyss of space, and 
if the matter composing his form should 
change from organic to inorganic, from 
active to inactive; in other words, if 
he should die, the great planets would 
move on in their majestic courses and 
the cosmic scheme would in nowise be 
interfered with. 

NEURASTHENIA— THE CAUSE 

Neurasthenia is caused by a violation 
of the laws of nutrition, such as over- 
eating, taking intoxicants, tea, coffee. 



506 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

tobacco, stimulating and sedative drugs; 
an oversupply of certain elements of nour- 
ishment and an undersupply of others; 
failure to eliminate waste; a lack of ac- 
tivity or motion, and improper oxidation. 
These causes removed, nervousness and 
all neurasthenic tendencies disappear, 
and Nature asserts herself and produces 
physical normality. 

NEURASTHENIA— THE SYMPTOMS 

Neurasthenic symptoms are excita- 
bility, irritability, mental depression, in- 
somnia, fatigue, exhaustion, emaciation 
and sometimes hysteria, which very often 
result in other local disorders, such as 
extreme constipation or chronic hyper- 
chlorhydria, with a tendency toward 
weakened sexuality. 

NEURASTHENIA— THE REMEDY 

In medical literature there are hun- 
dreds of alleged remedies for nervous 
disorders, yet not one of them attempts 
to ascertain the causes and to suggest 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 507 

their removal. Drugs only paralyze and 
stupify the delicate, sensitive nerve fibers 
that are conveying the intelligence to 
the brain that something is wrong, and 
the average man mistakes this for a 
remedy or a cure. 

In the opinion of the writer, neuras- 
thenia would be almost impossible if the 

Unbalanced ^^^^^ ^^^^ thoroughly nOUr- 

diet, a primary ishcd and the daily bill of 
"'"^^ fare kept level, or, as we 

would say in our cash system, "bal- 
anced." But when one labors under 
heavy mental strains, especially that 
character of burden called worry, and is 
not properly fed and nourished, the ex- 
penditure of force on one side and the 
lack of supplying it on the other, are 
very likely to result in an abnormal 
physical condition called neurasthenia. 
It is safe to say that all cases of neuras- 
thenia can be traced to improper nour- 
ishment on the one hand and abnormal 
mental tension on the other.

nately some of the best institutions in the 
country — those best equipped to take

attach any great importance to diet. 
This comes, no doubt, from the universal 
lack of information concerning the natu- 
ral laws governing Food Chemistry, and 
their particular application to animal life. 
Neurasthenic patients should first be

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 509 

the uplifting of people. The best remedy 
for the weary or discouraged mind, or 
the neurasthenic body, is the praise and 
esteem of people. 

The suggestions hitherto given for all 
kindred disorders will apply in most 
cases of neurasthenia. (See also "Ner- 
vousness — Its Cause and Cure," Vol. 
V, p. 1211.) The patient should be 
advised to spend at least from three to 
four hours a day in the open air and 
sunshine, when the weather will permit, 
in some quiet way, walking, driving, or 
in moderate exercise. 

Most important of all is the diet. It 
should be balanced according to age, 
labor, and temperature of the atmosphere, 
and should consist of — 

Such foods as will cause normal action

Green corn 
Nuts 

Rich fresh milk 
Yolks of eggs 

Young beans, peas, or any legume be-

510 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Immature starch composes the best 
form of carbohydrate food, which is 
exceedingly necessary in most cases of 
neurasthenia, unless the patient be obese, 
in which event it should be reduced to 
meet only the requirements of the body, 
and nitrogenous foods should predom- 
inate. 

A passive form of exercise is very 
highly recommended, such as all forms 
of Swedish or mechanical electrical mas- 
sage. In connection with this the body 
should be given an olive-oil rub at least 
twice a week.

MALNUTRITION 
CAUSE AND REMEDY 

Malnutrition is caused mainly by errors 
in eating, sedentary habits, and lack of 
fresh air. The remedy, therefore, sug- 
gests itself. Level or balance the diet 
according to the patient's requirements, 
and advise from two to three hours' 
vigorous exercise every day, and deep 
breathing in the open air. 

All the causes as well as the cure of 
malnutrition were discussed under the 
subject of emaciation. (See "Emacia- 
tion," p. 477.) 

LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA 

THE CAUSE 

The primary causes of locomotor ataxia 

are depletion of the nervous forces by 

Expenditure of cxccssivc scxual indulgence 

uTtlrTbJit' ^^^ ^^^ excessive use of 

primary causes narcotics and stimulauts, and 

at the same time a lack of such food as 



512 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

contains the nutritive elements that will 
supply the vital forces that are thus being 
exhausted. Whenever there is an exces- 
sive expenditure of muscular and nervous 
vitality, coupled with failure to rebuild 
these forces with proper nutrition, the 
natural consequence is decline and paraly- 
sis. The one thus afflicted usually labors 
under conditions of easy excitement, and, 
the body being constantly overstimu- 
lated, false or abnormal appetite is in- 
duced. This extra amount of food con- 
stitutes an excess of waste matter which 
produces a constant accumulation of 
toxic (poisonous) substances throughout 
the system, and the heavy drains made 
upon the vital forces already mentioned, 
render the body less able to throw off 
these poisons. The body, being thus 
attacked simultaneously from two sources, 
gradually breaks down. 

The leading doctors and medical books 
acknowledge that accumulated poisons 
in the body are a secondary cause of loco- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 513 

motor ataxia, but they endeavor to remove 

these poisons by the introduction of other 

poisons, such as mercury, 

treatment which is knOWU tO CaUSC 

optic nerve atrophy; iodid of 
potassium, which deranges digestion and 
causes intense gastro-intestinal irritation, 
vomiting, diarrhea, and often a total 
collapse of intestinal peristalsis; arsenic, 
one of the greatest irritants to the mucous 
surfaces of the body, besides being a high 
stimulant and reactionary narcotic. Ni- 
trate of silver is another standard remedy 
recommended by medical books. This 
powerful drug coagulates the albumin in 
both the food and the body, causing 
abdominal pain, vomiting, and purging. 
Morphin is another remedy, the terrible 
effects of which are well known. 

The poisonous drugs herein named are 

Results of old recommended by the medi- 

schooi treat- cal profcssiou iu their stand- 

™*°* ard treatises on locomotor 

ataxia, while in other of their reference 



:14 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

books they give the effects on the body 
of these same drugs. The logical result 
of such poisons taken into the system 
would be to prevent it from throwing off 
the poisons which they believe to be a 
primary cause of locomotor ataxia, but 
which in reality is a secondary cause. 
Thus the old school physicians have not 
only been unable to effect a cure, but 
have made the malady worse, hence 
locomotor ataxia is pronounced incurable. 
The principal thing I wish to impress 
upon the mind of the practitioner, by a reci- 
tation of these facts, is that the remedies 
employed by the old school physicians are 
not only worthless, but harmful, and in- 
stead of possessing curative power, they 
hinder and prevent Nature from recon- 
structing the cell in her own primitive way. 

LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA— THE SYMPTOMS 

One or more of the following symptoms 
are always experienced in the early stages 
of locomotor ataxia: 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 515 

The vision at times is uncertain, one 
object appearing as two, especially at a 
long distance. In the morning the feet 
will feel covered as if with a heavy woolen 
blanket. The floor will seem unlevel, 
usually sloping forward, which is hkely 
to cause the victim to halt suddenly for 
fear of falling forward. The estimate, or 
sense of distance, becomes much impaired. 
An object or a wall twenty feet distant 
will appear to be within easy reach of 
the hand. 

These symptoms are usually experi- 
enced in the morning, immediately on 
rising, and are likely to be felt again 
during the day after a heavy meal. 

All symptoms may disappear when 
under the influence of stimulants, only 
to reappear later in a more pronounced 
way. 

LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA— THE REMEDY 

The remedy for locomotor ataxia lies 
first in removing the primary causes. 



516 ENCYCLOPEDL\ OF DIET 

The patient should abstain from all 
stimulants, narcotics and drugs of every 
character whatsoever, and especially from 
sexual indulgence. These sources of 
exhaustion having ceased, the patient 
should subsist upon foods containing an 
excess of proteids and albuminoids, with 
just enough carbohydrates to balance 
the daily menu. 

The following diet is a mere suggestion, 
subject to change in order to meet the 
conditions of temperature, age, and 
activity. 

Immediately on rising, the patient 
should take a few spoonfuls of strained 
orange juice and drink a cup of hot water. 
He should also devote a few minutes to 
deep breathing, and such moderate exer- 
cises as he is able to endure. 

BREAKFAST 

The whites of four eggs and the yolks of two 
(If digestion is good, the whites of six eggs may 
be taken — one yolk to each two whites) 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 517 

A glass of milk 

A tablespoonful of nuts 

One very ripe banana with cream 

Three or four dates 

LUNCHEON 

Three or four eggs whipped eight minutes; 
to each egg add one teaspoonful of lemon juice, 
and a heaping teaspoonful of sugar; whip this 
mixture into a quart of milk ; drink slowly 



Smelts, or any small fish 

A Spanish onion, baked in casserole dish 

Corn bread 

Buttermilk or skimmed milk 

One fresh vegetable, cooked plain 

In addition to this diet, there should 
be a regular daily schedule of exercise 
and deep breathing, which the patient 
should be required to carry out with rigid 
precision and regularity. 

In nearly all cases of locomotor ataxia 
Value of exer- t^c body is unable to cast off 
ciseandmas- the generated poisons, or 
^*^® used-up tissue, the result be- 

ing that the new building material (food) 



518 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

taken in is not appropriated. This condi- 
tion of atrophy must be overcome by 
exercise, massage, fomentation (wrapping 
the patient in a hot, wet blanket), or by 
anything that will induce excessive super- 
ficial circulation. 

If one afflicted with locomotor ataxia 
can be induced to arise from his lethargy 
and exert himself, following the methods 
herein suggested, a gradual increase in 
strength is very likely to be experienced 
inside of two or three months, and total 
recovery may be expected in process of 
time. 

The writer had a patient, a retired ship 
captain, who came under his treatment 
after suffering for twelve years with 
locomotor ataxia, and after twelve months 
declared himself cured. The only evi- 
dence remaining of his former condition 
at this writing is shown when he attempts 
to turn around suddenly, and his control 
of the lumbar and motor muscles are 
undergoing such improvement that even

COLDS, CATARRH, HAY FEVER, ASTHMA, 
INFLUENZA 

These disorders are grouped under a 
general heading because there are a few 



520 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

fundamental laws that affect them all alike. 
Capillary congestion is a common cause in 
Overeating a all thcsc clisordcrs, and any- 
ofTa'^ma ^^"^^ thing that will produce this 
congestion condition will cause, or at 
least augment catarrh, hay fever, asthma, 
influenza, and colds. As overeating is the 
primary cause of congestion throughout 
the capillary system, it, rather than ex- 
posure, is the most common cause of all 
these disorders. The treatment that will 
remove or prevent this form of conges- 
tion will, therefore, remove a primary 
cause, when such remedial measures may 
be employed as each case demands. 

COLDS— THE CAUSE 

That condition commonly known as a 
cold is merely a congestion of effete mat- 
ter and toxic substances in the body- 
cells, coming from two causes, and, so far 
as my experience has been able to guide 
me, from two causes only, namely: 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 521 

1 Overeating 

2 Exposure to violent atmospheric 
changes 

COLDS— THE SYMPTOMS 

The symptoms from both causes mani- 
fest themselves in exactly the same way, 
therefore it becomes very necessary to 
ascertain what the sufferer has been 
eating, both as to quantity and as to 
kind of foods during the previous forty- 
eight hours. 

It often occurs that colds from over- 
eating are cumulative, that is, the patient 
habitually takes too much 

by'overeatog ^^t, swccts, or meat, espe- 
cially the two latter articles, 
and these may have been digested, and 
their nutritive elements may have passed 
into the circulation, but the body being 
unable to use them, they finally begin 
to decompose and are converted into al- 



522 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

cohol and other decomposition products. 
An excess of this effete matter brought 
to the lungs is called a "cold." 

If one who is blessed with good diges- 
tion and assimilation should habitually 
take an amount of nutrition in excess of 
his needs, it will manifest itself first, 
perhaps, in the growth of adipose tissue, 
and later in the various disorders called 
autointoxication, among which are colds, 
catarrh, etc. 

If the body be exposed to a violent 
draft of cold air, and sufficient motion 

is not exerted to keep the 
by^'ezZrf circuktiou activc, or if the 

feet be exposed to cold and 
wet. Nature, in obedience to the law of 
self-defense, closes the pores of the skin 
against the intrusion, hence the poisonous 
and effete matter that is constantly 
passing off through these openings cannot 
escape, but it is picked up by the blood 
and carried to the lungs to be oxidized or 
burned in the process of breathing. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 523 

If the amount of poisons thus brought 
to the lungs be in excess of the amount 
Colds from that cau be consumed or 
:Zure"fiLt burned, a form of congestion 
deal will take place (in the lungs) 

causing first irritation, then suppuration, 
which must be thrown off in the form of 
mucus. It matters not whether the con- 
gestion is caused by exposure or over- 
eating, the effects are identically the 
same, and Nature's method of ridding 
the body of these poisons is the same in 
either case. The only difference between 
an ordinary cold and pneumonia is one 
of degree. 

COLDS— THE REMEDY 

Since colds are merely a form of con- 
gestion, first in the capillary vessels and 
next in the lungs, the first thing to be 
done is to cease eating. The misunder- 
standing of the old adage * 'stuff a cold 
and starve a fever" has killed thousands 



524 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

of ignorant but innocent people. Its real 
meaning is, if you stuff a cold, you will 
have to starve an internal fever. 

In the treatment of colds, I would sug- 
gest the following method of procedure; 

1 (a) Omit all food except — 



Juice of subacid fruits 



Such aa- 

Apples 

Grapes 

Peaches 

Plums 



This should be continued until 
the congestion is relieved, whether 
it be one day or a week. (For list 
of subacid fruits, see Lesson VIII, 
p. 313.) 

(b) Drink copiously of pure, cool 
water 

2 Select a light diet of— 

Nuts 

Salads 

White of eggs 

Fresh watery vegetables 

Limited quantity of carbohydrates 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 5C5 

If the cold is severe, a Turkish bath 
or any treatment that will produce liberal 
perspiration, will aid in the elimination of 
body-poisons and the relief of congestion. 
Inasmuch as the blood is conveying 
an excessive amount of poisons to the 
Remedial luugs for oxidatiou, much 
Ifr andVr' depends upon the amount 
cise of pure air that is breathed 

and the cell capacity of the lungs for 
oxidation; therefore the sufiFerer, if un- 
able to be out of doors, should be warmly 
clad and placed before an open window, 
or on a veranda in the sunshine, if pos- 
sible, where every breath will be of fresh 
air. If, however, the patient is able to 
go out, every moment possible should be 
spent walking briskly in the open air. 
Every morning the patient should be 
given a vigorous "sponge" with a towel 
dipped in cold water, and rubbed down 
with a dry one. This should be done in a 
warm room, with the body well protected 
from undue exposure. The room should 



526 ENCYCLOPEDL\ OF DIET 

be thoroughly ventilated at night, and 
in severe cases all garments and sheets 
used during the day should be thoroughly 
aired or changed at night. 

The old methods of drugging and of 
excluding the air and sunshine, which is in 
reality poisoning the patient both within 
and without, is little less than criminal. 

A cool shower, or a sponge bath, to- 
gether with a vigorous rub every morning 
immediately on rising, and a normal quan- 
tity of natural food, render the body almost 
entirely immune from colds, la grippe, and 
all forms of capillary congestion and 
effete and toxic (poisonous) substances. 

(For diet, see volume of Menus, p. 917.) 

In cases of Colds: 



Confectiona Coarse cereals (very little) 

Desserts Fresh vegetables 

Fatty foods Fruit (See p. 524) 

Flesh foods Light vegetable soupa 

Heavy starchy foods Nuts 

Intoxicants Wheat bran 

Whites of eggs 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 527 

CATARRH— THE CAUSE 

The causes of catarrh are attributed 

by all old school writers to acute coryza 

Decomposition and cxposurc to irritating 

iTrimlrv"'' dust, or cold, moist, and 

the pnmary ' ' ' 

cause of catarrh perliaps infcctious air. These 
may be secondary causes and may aug- 
ment catarrh after it has appeared, but 
experience has proved that the primary 
cause of catarrh is the decomposition of 
unused food material, and that Nature 
throws off the decomposition products re- 
sulting therefrom, through the nasal 
passage, in the form of mucus. In the 
support of this theory I may refer to 
many cases of ordinary stomach trouble, 
constipation, torpidity of the liver, etc., 
that have had my personal care. In 
nearly all these cases I found that, when 
the diet was balanced according to the 
age and the occupation of the patient, 
with the climate or time of the year, 
practically all catarrhal symptoms disap- 



528 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

peared, and exposure to atmospheric 
changes, dust, and the usual things that 
had formerly brought on catarrhal condi- 
tions, did not affect the patient. 

CATARRH— THE SYMPTOMS 

The symptoms of catarrh are constant 
secretion of nasal mucus, which often 
passes off into the postnasal and naso- 
pharyngeal spaces. This mucus is usu- 
ally thin and of a light-colored watery 
character, varying in quantity according 
to exposure or activity, the quantity of 
food eaten, and the temperature of the 
atmosphere. 

CATARRH— THE REMEDY 

In the treatment of catarrh, avoid the 
following: 

All meats 

Heavy starchy foods 

(Especially white flour products) 
Sweets (See Lesson VIII, p. 334) 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 529 

The diet should consist of — 



A reasonable quantity of proteid foods in the 
form of — 

Beans Peaa 

Eggs Sour milk 

Nuts 
Bananas 
Cbarse cereals — twice a day; such as entire 

wheat and rj'e 
Fish (small quantity, occasionally) 
Fresh vegetables 
Green watery salads 
Non-acid fruits 
Wheat bran — 

(Enough to keep the bowels in normal con- 
dition) 



Deep breathing through the nostrils 
and vigorous exercise should be taken 
freely, especially just after 
birthing rising and just before retir- 
ing. Special attention should 
be given to breathing through the nose. 
When the air is pure, there is nothing 
more healing and remedial in the treat- 
ment of catarrh than the abundant 
passage of air through the nasal cavities.

HAY FEVER 



Hay fever might be called autumnal 
catarrh. It is popularly supposed to be 
an irritation of the nasal passages and 
the bronchial tubes, caused by the flying 
pollen from various flowers and plants. 
Authorities differ widely, however, as 
to the causes. 



ENCYCLOPEDLA. OF DIET 521 

HAY FE\'ER— THE SYMPTOMS 

The symptoms of hay fever are usually 
a salty discharge from the eyes and the 
nostrils, followed by severe irritation of 
the mucous lining of the nasal cavity, a 
sense of fullness in the head, and violent 
sneezing. 

HAY FEVER— THE REMEDY 

It has not been the writer's opportun- 
ity to examine deeply into the actual 
causes of hay fever, but it has been his 
good fortune to cure many cases. 

The remedy should be confined to — 

Fresh air and sunshine 
Close observation of the rules of diet 
Total abstinence from all forina of stimulants 
and narcotics 

I would suggest the following diet: 

Berries 

Eggs 

Fish (Limited quantity) 



532 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 



Green and fresh vegetables 
Sour milk (Buttermilk) 

(Where this kind of milk cannot be obtained, 
the ordinary sweet milk will suffice) 

The diet must be governed, as already 
explained in many other cases, by the 
individual requirements of the patient 
in regard to the amount of exercise, the 
temperature of the atmosphere, and the 
age of the patient. In spring and summer 
is the ideal time to remove the causes of 
hay fever and effect its cure. (See 
Catarrh.) 

In cases of Hay Fever:

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 533 

The diet should be governed by 
amount of exercise, temperature, 
etc. 

ASTHMA 
THE CAUSE 

The cause of asthma is congestion in, 
or constriction of, the bronchial tubes. 
This congestion is usually caused by 
overeating and the excessive use of nar- 
cotics and stimulants such as tobacco, 
liquors, and beer. The excessive use of 
sugar and starches, or what is generally 
known as carbohydrates, will set up a 
form of difficult breathing, or at least 
augment asthmatic tendencies. This con- 
dition is more likely to occur among those 
whose lungs are weakened and who have 
a tendency toward consumption. 

ASTHMA— THE SYMPTOMS 

There are but few conditions preceding 
asthma that can properly be called symp- 
toms. The attacks are usually violent 
and frequently come on late at night. 



534 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

The patient suffers with a sense of as- 
phyxia, which causes the impression of 
death from suffocation. 

ASTHMA— THE REMEDY 

The causes of asthma can be removed 
by diet, fresh air and exercise. If the 
patient can take a reasonable amount 
of exercise, sunshine and fresh air, the 
cure will be more rapid, but if this cannot 
be done, the diet can be limited so that 
there will be but little waste, therefore 
little congestion, and the necessity for 
exercise and fresh air will be reduced to 
the minimum. 

In cases of asthma, the diet should be 
confined to — 

Egg albumin 

Limited quantity of nuts 

(No more than two ounces per day) 
An abundance of — 

Fresh and green vegetables 
Fruits 
Salads 
If meat be taken at all, it should be confined 
to fish, young and tender game, or fowl, al- 
though these articles are not recommended. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 



535 



If the patient be obese or above normal 
weight, the diet given for obesity should 
be rigidly observed. If of normal weight, 
the body should be fed somewhat below 
its physical requirements, even if a radi- 
cal loss in weight should be experienced 
for the first three or four weeks. 

If the patient is emaciated, then the 
diet should consist of six or eight eggs, 
and about one quart of milk daily, 
together with sweet fruits and fresh vege- 
tables. Milk may be given in larger 
quantities, up to three quarts daily, if 
all other food except eggs be omitted. 

In cases of Asthma: 



All intoxicants 


About two ounces of nuts 


Coffee 


per day (no more) 


Condiments

INFLUENZA 
THE CAUSE 

This disorder is popularly supposed 
to be of bacteriological origin, but upon 
Bacteria the ^^^^ qucstiou the Scientific 
result, not world is much divided. In 
the cause ^j^^ opinion of the writer the 
cause of influenza cannot be traced to 
bacteria or any other form of germ life. 
Bacteria is nearly always present in de- 
composing animal matter. It is the 
opinion of the writer, therefore, that 
bacteria is the result and not the cause 
of influenza. It might be described as 
an acute activity of the entire system in 
throwing off accumulated waste or toxic 
substances. This process of excretion 
will become more difficult at certain 
times, during violent changes in tem- 
perature, and many people in small 
communities may be similarly afflicted, 
which no doubt gives rise to the theory 
that it is a disease of germ origin. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 537 

INFLUENZA— THE SYMPTOMS 

The symptoms are headache, languor, 
sometimes nausea and congestion in the 
lungs, together with acute irritation of 
the nasal passages. 

INFLUENZA— THE REMEDY 

The logical remedy is normal tempera- 
ture of environment, abundance of fresh 
air, and omission of all solid food. 

There are two specific forms of diet 
to be recommended — 

1 A liquid diet entirely, such as — 

Juice of berries 

Orange juice 

Milk 

Very thin vegetable soups 

2 Confine diet entirely to — 

Nuts 

Fruits 

Fresh green vegetables 

3 Eliminate fats, starches, sugars 

Either of the above suggestions will be 
sufficient to control an ordinary case of 
influenza if it is rigidly adhered to. 



538 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

In the spring and summer, the latter 
diet would be recommended, while in 
winter, when green and fresh vegetables, 
fruits, etc., cannot be procured, the milk 
diet should be given. 

In cases of influenza, see menus for 
colds, hay fever, and catarrh. Take 
choice, giving preference to those pre- 
scribed for hay fever. Whichever menu 
is chosen, it should be taken in its en- 
tirety; that is, do not select the meals 
from two or three menus. 

INSOMNIA 
THE CAUSE 

The inabiUty to sleep is caused: 

1 By intestinal congestion or slug- 

gish intestinal peristalsis 

2 By irritation of the mucous 

membrane of the stomach 
and intestines 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 539 

3 By the presence of gas, super- 

acidity, and the consequent 
irritation and excitation of the 
nerves leading out from the 
digestive tract 

4 By the use of tobacco 

5 By the consumption of stimu- 

lants and narcotics, which are 
so universal and so life-de- 
stroying 

The effects of (4) and (5) upon the 
stomach are much the same as those of 
overeating, in that they invariably cause 
supersecretion of acid, and, in the major- 
ity of instances, produce false appetite, 
thus augmenting the baneful habit of 
overeating. 



INSOMNIA— THE REMEDY 

The logical remedy for insomnia is 
first to eliminate the use of tea, coffee, 



540 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

tobacco, distilled and malted liquors, 
and drugs of every kind whatsoever, as 
the ultimate effect upon the stomach of 
all these things is the same. When this 
has been done, the amount of food re- 
quired by the body, governed by the three 
laws of age, work, and temperature of 
environment, should be accurately laid 
out so that the quantity of food may 
be controlled and overeating avoided. 

The diet should also be balanced ac- 
cording to the chemical needs of the body 

^ heretofore mentioned. In a 

Cases necessi- 
tating a special majority of cases, when the 
reme la let f^^^ Scientist cau prevail 
upon his patient to confine himself to a 
normal ciuantity of food, reasonably well 
balanced as to nutrient elements, the 
stomach will perform its natural functions, 
and fermentation with its long train of 
ills will gradually disappear. This can, 
in many instances, be accomplished by 
merely standing out of Nature's way, 
but in some cases the stomach, liver, in- 



ENCYCLOPEDL\ OF DIET 



541 



testines, and nervous system have been 
so long abused and so impaired that they 
seem to have entered into a conspiracy 
for mutual protection, hence may not 
yield to the "normal quantity" or "bal- 
anced dietary" remedy. In these cases 
a remedial diet must be followed, such 
as will restore the balance by omitting 
altogether the elements on which the 
patient had been overfed, and taking an 
excessive quantity of the elements for 
the lack of which the patient had been 
suffering. 

The following menus should be adopted 
in the treatment of ordinary cases of 
Insomnia:

RHEUMATISM— GOUT 

These disorders are grouped under the 
same heading because they are of identical 
origin. 

In the average body of five feet eight 
inches in height, there are about 2,000 
Why rheuraa- milcs of tubiug, classified 
itsdfTa^rg'efy*^ Under the various names of 
in the joints artcHes, vcius, capillaries, 
and nerves. Altogether this is called the 
circulatory system. A vast amount of 
this system is infinitely small. Every 
atom of food taken into the circulation 
that is not used or converted into energy 
passes into some of these infinitely small 
tubes and nerve fibers. These tubes are 
susceptible of considerable expansion in 
the fleshy part of the body, but where 
they pass through the joints or cartilage, 
there is but little expansion. There these 



544 ENCYCLOPEDLV OF DIET 

undissolved atoms are most likely to con- 
gest, therefore the first expression of 
rheumatism is usually in the joints. If 
it takes place at the terminals (fingers or 
toes), it is called gout; if in the muscles, 
it is called muscular or inflammatory 
rheumatism. This congestion accounts 
for the stiffness and lack of elasticity in 
the joints. These accumulated atoms 
become in time almost as hard as bone. 

RHEUMATISxM— THE CAUSE 

The cause of both rheumatism and gout 
are practically the same — that is, over- 
eating, especially of flesh and starchy 
foods. Meat and bread are the two 
things that cause nearly all rheumatism, 
though rheumatic symptoms often ap- 
pear among vegetarians, caused by the 
overconsumption of starchy food, espe- 
cially when acid fruits are used. The ideal 
diet for producing rheumatism is cereals, 
white bread, meat, acid fruit and eggs. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 545 

RHEUMATISM— THE SYMPTOMS 

The symptoms of rheumatism often 
manifest themselves a year or more 
before an attack comes on. 

The earlier symptoms are — 

Languor, stupidity and dul- 

ness in the morning 
Impaired circulation and a 

sense of body-heaviness 

The later symptoms are pain in the 
joints or muscles, often followed by in- 
flammation and severe soreness and stiff- 
ness. 

The rheumatic usually has good diges- 
tion. In fact, it is the abihty of the 
digestive organs to force more nutrition 
into the circulation than is needed, that 
produces this dis-ease. 

In nearly all cases of rheumatism and 
gout the patient will be found to have 
been a large consumer of starchy food, 



546 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

especially of the cereal family, which is the 
most difficult of all starches to dissolve. 

GOUT— THE CAUSE 

The primary cause of gout is faulty 
metabolism; behind this, however, are 
An excess of other causcs. The metabolic 
T:i:i:7 process is rendered faulty 
acid or incomplete by the over- 

ingestion of hea\'y starchy foods. This 
excess of starch, which the body is not 
able to appropriate or use, becomes 
easily crystallized by the excess of acid 
which is always present when too much 
starch is consumed. The crystalhzing 
process is often augmented by the eating 
of fruit-acids such as grapefruit, lemons, 
oranges, pineapples, and other citrus- 
fruits. In addition to these causes the 
uric acid residual in meat and in the 
yolk of eggs is an important factor in the 
causation of gouty or rheumatic condi- 
tions. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 547 

GOUT— THE SYMPTOMS 

The earlier symptoms of gout are ner- 
vousness, irritability, and sometimes in- 
somnia. In the second stages, shooting 
pains through the fingers and toes are 
experienced, and later a swelKng or a 
slight inflammation of these terminals. 
After this acute condition has existed for 
perhaps a year, the pain may cease and 
the joints may begin to swell. Knots are 
also often formed, especially upon the 
hands, and sometimes upon the feet. 

RHEUMATISM, GOUT— THE REMEDY 

The remedy for these disorders may 
be said to lie wholly within the realm of 
diet, exercise and oxidation, supplemented 
by a hberal superficial application of 
heat, such as Turkish and electric light 
baths. 

In all cases of rheumatism and gout, 
the following should be omitted: 



548 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET

BRIGHT'S DIS-EASE 



This disorder is confined entirely to 
the kidneys. In its final analysis it is 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 551 

nothing more than consumption or de- 
struction of the kidneys by thrusting 
upon them a greater amount of waste 
matter than they are capable of throwing 
off, the result being (1) irritation; (2) 
ulceration; (3) suppuration or consump- 
tion. 

BRIGHT'S DIS-EASE— THE CAUSE 

The causes of Bright's dis-ease are 
overingestion of food, especially sweets, 
starches and meats; the taking of stimu- 
lants and narcotics, and the consequent 
failure of the body to eliminate the poisons 
or waste accumulating therefrom. 

BRIGHT'S DIS-EASE— THE SYMPTOMS 

The symptoms of Bright's dis-ease are 
scant amount of urine, heavily laden 
with solids and fatty granules, while 
leucocytes and even red blood-corpuscles 
are often shown, especially in advanced 
cases. Dull pains in the small of the back, 



552 ENCYCLOPEDL\ OF DIET 

and a general weakening in the lumbar 
regions are common symptoms. 

BRIGHT'S DIS-EASE— THE REMEDY 

It has been popularly supposed, and 
announced from many alleged sources of 
Prevention of authority, that there is no 
ea"f by cor- remedy for this dis-ease, and 
rect feeding from the Standpoint of ]Ma- 
teria Medica this probably is correct, 
but from the standpoint of the natural 
scientist there is a remedy. However, 
Bright's dis-ease, like all others herein 
discussed, can better be prevented than 
cured, and under a correct dietetic regi- 
men, with plenty of exercise and fresh 
air, the kidneys, like every other organ 
of the body, will perform their normal 
functions. 

When Bright's dis-ease has made its 
appearance, the first thing to be ascer- 
tained is the character of the diet and 
the general habits of eating and drinking 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 553 

during the previous two or three years; 
secondly, the occupation or habits of 
exercise, especially exposure to fresh air 
and sunshine. 

BRIGHT'S DIS-EASE— THE TREATMENT 

A very restricted diet should be ob- 
served, consisting largely of the following: 

Fresh vegetables 
Green salads 
Subacid fruits 
The fine cereals — 

(Such as barley and rice) 
Milk and eggs — (limited quantity) 

All sweets taken should be in the form 
of sweet fruits. (See Lesson VIII, p. 313). 

An abundance of nuts should also be 

included. There is no food known to 

science that is so beneficial

live entirely upon this nut, supplemented 

by one or two varieties of fruit, and a few 



554 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

fresh vegetables, it would be highly 
beneficial. 

If the patient is under treatment in the 

spring and summer, as many green plants 

„ ^. and fresh sweet fruits as 

Suggestions ^ 

for diet in dif- possible should be taken, 

ferent seasons •■ i i T •• j i'i 

With only a limited quantity 
of milk, eliminating cereal starch entirely. 
In the fall and winter, the many varieties 
of apples and autumn vegetables may be 
taken in liberal quantities. 

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR BRIGHT'S 
DIS-EASE 

In the majority of cases it is well to 
first put the patient on a short fast of 
about twenty-four hours, and then begin 
the diet with articles containing a liberal 
quantity of cellulose, such as the entire 
wheat, boiled; celery, turnip, or cabbage 
cooked in casserole dish. 

Keep the bowels open by the use of 
wheat bran, or grapes, if they are in 
season, swallowing skins, seeds and pulp. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 555 

As in all sympathetic disorders, an 
abundance of pure, cool water should be 
taken and as much time as possible 
should be spent in the open air and sun- 
shine. 

Care should be taken to hmit the diet 
to the minimum so that the excretory 
organs can easily eliminate all waste 
matter, and so that there may be no fur- 
ther poisonous, accumulations. 

In cases of Bright's Dis-ease: 



Drugs Abundance of nuta (Italian 

Flesh of every kind pine nut) 

Intoxicants Fine cereals — barley, rice 

Rich desserts Fresh vegetables 

Sweets Green salads 

Limited quantity of milk 

and eggs 
Sweets in form of fruit- 
sugar, such as dates, figs, 
raisins (limited quantity) 
Subacid fruits 
Wheat bran with evening 



556 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

The diet should be somewhat re- 
stricted. 

Drink an abundance of pure 
water. 

DIABETES 

This disorder may be described as one 
of malassimilation from the stomach, 
hver, kidneys, and intestines, but to 
the trained student it is better described 
as a condition in which the capacity of 
the body to burn or use grape-sugar has 
become chronically depressed. It is usu- 
ally supplemented by a lack of physical 
exercise and elimination of body-poisons. 

DIABETES— THE CAUSE 

From the above explanation it will be 
seen that diabetes, like all other dis-eases 
of the digestive organs, is caused directly 
by errors in eating — overconsumption of 
carbohydrates (sweets and starches), and 
albuminoids. These errors are augmented 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 557 

by inactivity, causing lack of assimilation 
or utilization of nutritive elements. 



DIABETES— THE SYMPTOMS 

The symptoms of diabetes are intense 
thirst and appetite, copious passing of 
urine and the presence of excessive quan- 
tities of sugar and uric acid therein. 

DIABETES— THE REMEDY 

The selecting, proportioning and bal- 
ancing of the daily menu, together with 
an observance of the natural laws hith- 
erto laid out, will prevent diabetes, but 
after it has made its appearance the 
remedy lies in simple and limited feeding. 

The sufferer should be put upon a rigid 
diet of fresh vegetables, nuts, fruits, and 
salads. If the body has not been trained 
to accept these foods, the diet might con- 
sist of the following: 



558 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Bloodless (white) meats 
Eggs 

Fats — reasonable quantity 
(Olive-oil, butter, cream) 
Fish 

Fresh vegetables 
Green salads — generous quantity 
Nuts 



If the patient be overweight, the diet 
should consist largely of subacid fruits 
and nuts. If underweight, the heavier 
or sweeter fruits, such as bananas, pears 
and prunes, should predominate, together 
with a hberal quantity of sour milk. 

In extreme cases the patient should 

be required to subsist upon Pignoha 

Diet in ex- ^^^^ pine) uuts, and green or 

treme cases of frcsh Vegetables uncooked. 

la etes ^\^q wHtcr kuows of a gen- 

tleman suffering from a very advanced 
case of diabetes, who, in utter despair, 
adopted a diet consisting entirely of 
pine nuts, merely because they appealed 
to his taste, while nothing else did. A 
noticeable change for the better was seen 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 559 

in a week, especially in regard to the 
amount of sugar passed in the urine. He 
adhered rigidly to this diet for nearly 
three months. He then added green sal- 
ads and carrots, and the seventh and 
eighth months a few fresh cooked vege- 
tables, and w^as pronounced thoroughly 
cured before the year had expired. This 
might have been due partly to the limited 
bill of fare, but undoubtedly it was largely 
due to the food elements contained in this 
wonderful product of the Italian pine. 

In cases of Diabetes: 

OMIT EAT 

Condiments All fresh vegetables, cooked 

Confections — preferably in casserole 

Irritants dish 

Pastries Bananas and nuts 

Red meats Baked potatoes 

Stimulants and narcotics Coarse whole cereals thor- 

Sweets oughly cooked — small 

White flour products quantity 

Fish 

Milk (sour) 

Very ripe subacid fruit 
White meat of fowl 



560 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Drink an abundance of pure water. 

In treating diabetes, foods containing 
starch and sugar should not be wholly 
eliminated from the diet, but should be 
administered in limited proportions, or 
such quantities as the body could use. 
Starches and sugars contained in cereals 
and legumes, however, should in extreme 
cases be omitted because they are diffi- 
cult to digest and to assimilate. If the 
digestion is impaired, the body is likely 
to cast out these valuable nutrients 
through the kidneys, rather than labor to 
digest and to assimilate them. The 
starches and sugars found in fresh vege- 
tables (See table, Vol. Ill, p. 614), are 
easily digested and assimilated, therefore 
in cases of diabetes the body will use or 
appropriate them, as this entails less 
energy than that required to cast them 
out. 

CONSUMPTION 

For many centuries chemists, scientists, 
and medical men generally have been 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 561 

vainly battling with this dis-ease. It is 
only within the past decade that it has 
been understood or successfully treated. 
Consumption is an infection of the 
lungs by the bacteria called bacillus 
tuberculosis. The local inflammation 
produces lesions, and the formation of 
small growths (nodules) of gray, white, or 
yellowish tubercles. 

It is yet an open question and a matter 

of grave doubt in the minds of various 

Authorities authorities on this subject 

t^milZ as to whether the bacilli is 

lus the real cause^ or the result 

of the dis-ease. The fact that a person 

or an animal afflicted with tuberculosis 

was in "susceptible condition" is much 

emphasized by all authorities. 

Such disorders as catarrh, influenza, 

chronic colds, etc., are all predisposing 

„ ,. conditions. Such trades as 

Predisposing 

conditions and mctal grinding. Spinning, 

occupations weaving, cleaning grain, 

street sweeping, or any vocation necessi- 



562 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

tating the breathing of large quantities 
of dust, are termed predisposing occupa- 
tions, which show very clearly that all 
writers are practically agreed that the 
real cause is undoubtedly due to imperfect 
oxidation or impaired use of the lungs. 

The above conditions may be brought 
on from two specific causes — 

1 By the habitual overingestion 
of food, and the consequent con- 
gestion of effete matter in the 
lungs, brought thither by the cir- 
culation in its effort to dispose of 
the waste-products by burning 
them with oxygen. 

2 Through the agency of foreign 
substances breathed in, which 
gradually congest, and prevent 
thorough oxidation and normal 
activity of the excretory function 
of the lungs. 

The opinion of the writer is that the 
bacillus above referred to is the result 
and not the cause of this dis-ease, and 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 563 

that such Hving organisms (bacilli) are

the growth and the development of the 
bacteria. The fact that some very 
healthy animals did not contract the 
dis-ease by this method, supports the 
theory that if conditions are not favor- 
able the culture is killed by the process 
of oxidation. This sustains the theory 
that the bacillus tuberculosis is the result, 
and not the cause of this dread dis-ease. 
This theory is further supported by the 
results of the most modern and only 
successful methods of treating it. 



564 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

CONSUMPTION— THE TREATMENT 

When beginning treatment, the tuber- 
cular patient should be restricted as to 
diet for the purpose of giving Nature an 
opportunity to make use of every atom 
of food taken into the body, leaving 
nothing to go to waste. 

The diet should consist almost wholly 
of vegetable fats, sour milk, nuts, fruits, 
salads, and eggs, with a hmited amount 
of readily digestible carbohydrates. 

The following menu is given as a fair 
example of selection as to quantity and 
combinations : 

BREAKFAST 

Cantaloup, orange, grapes, peara, or persim- 
mons 

Two or three eggs, whipped five minutes, 
adding a teaspoonful of lemon juice, and one of 
sugar to each egg 



A green salad eaten with nuts, a dash of lemon 
juice and olive-oil 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 565 

One or two fresh vegetables, including a baked 
potato 

One egg prepared as for breakfast 
A glass of eour milk 



A green salad, with nuts and oil 
Eggs or buttermilk 
One or two fresh vegetables 
A baked potato 

The above menus may be in- 
creased in quantity after the first 
week or ten days, at least sufficient 
to meet all physical requirements, 
and the articles may be changed 
according to seasons. 

In spring and summer all kinds of 

fruits and berries may be used, and such

gestions for g^s, spiuach, bccts, grccn

corn. All of these vegetables should be 

cooked in a casserole dish. 



5GG ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

The bowels should be kept free. (See 
treatment for "Constipation," p. 437.) 
Drink copiously of pure Vv-ater. 

If the patient is not far advanced, he 
should seek employment which affords 
Suggestions for coustaut excrcisc in the open

of consumption or mountaius, and the labor 
should be of such a character as to cause 
normal activity of the hver and the 
bowels, and to enforce deep respiration. 
A spirometer or lung-measuring machine 
should be secured, and the patient should 
practise upon this night and morning, 
endeavoring each day to register from one 
to five cubic inches more than the previ- 
ous day, until every air cell of the lungs 
is opened and the full capacity is reached, 
which should be about 315 cubic inches 
for the average man, and 250 for the 
woman of normal size. 

Contrary to usual customs and theories, 
the patient should take a cool sponge 
bath every morning, in a warm room,

followed by a vigorous rub down and deep

or by pet animals in a closed room.

In order ta carry out this regimen, it 
is necessary to live out of doors day and 
night, winter and summer. 

The tubercular patient should sleep in 
a tent, or upon an open piazza every 
night, regardless of the weather or the 
temperature of the atmosphere. If these 
rules were observed the white plague 
would lose some of its terrors.

in none of their reference works are the 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 571 

causes of these so-called dis-eases clearly 
defined. Fatty degeneration is the only 
one that is explained, the term meaning 
that the heart has been deprived of room 
in which to do its work, owing to sur- 
rounding fatty accumulations. 

HEART TROUBLE— THE CAUSE 

The blood enters the heart through the 
superior venae cavae flowing to the right 
lobe or auricle, then it is pumped by the 
heart beats to the right ventricle. From 
here it is forced through the pulmonary 
artery to the lungs where it is purified 
and charged with the oxygen we breathe. 
From the lungs the blood returns through 
the pulmonary veins to the left auricle 
of the heart, and then to the left ven- 
tricle. Having passed once through the 
purifying plant and twice through the 
distributing station, it is now sent out 
through the large systematic artery and 
distributed to every capillary cell of the 
body.

gas the free flow of blood 

into and out of the heart, causing 
at times a very faint heart action 
from a lack of inflow, and again a very 
heavy, rapid action when the blood spurts 
through. This produces dizziness and 
vertigo, and sometimes where the inflow 
is greater than the heart can discharge, 
there is arterial overflow; the heart 
ceases action, and the victim falls pros- 
trate, and sometimes dies. 

(See "Fermentation — The Symptoms," 
p. 426.) 

Many cases of serious heart trouble 
are caused by habitual overeating, espe- 
Heart trouble cially of grain and grain 
«"!?/„"'" products. The calcareous 
Stances substauccs from these prod- 

ucts are deposited in the capillary vessels 
and in the joints, causing rheumatism, 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 57S 

rheumatoid arthritis, sciatica, lumbago, 
gout, and other evidences of our lack of 
knowledge. When the one thus aflflicted 
follows a sedentary occupation, taking 
but little fresh air and exercise, a harden- 
ing or stiffening of the arteries is usually 
the result. 

It is safe to say that if one would eat 
moderately, omit stimulants and narcot- 
ics, take but a limited quantity of starchy 
foods, a liberal amount of fresh air, 
deep breathing and exercise, heart trouble 
would be unknown. 

HEART TROUBLE— THE REMEDY 

For the treatment of those who are 
afflicted with heart trouble I would sug- 
gest a very limited diet of 
uH7 '''''* nuts, fruits, salads, fresh 
tuber and green vegetables, 
eggs, and a limited quantity of coarse 
foods, such as boiled whole wheat, wheat 
bran, grapes (seeds and all), and all coarse 



574 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

vegetables, with an abundance of mild 
exercise and fresh air. 

In cases of heart trouble no greater 
mistake can be made than to cease 
exercise, as is often pre- 
hea'rt 'trouble scribcd by wcll-meaniug doc- 
tors. This is compromising 
with the enemy, with absolute certainty 
of ultimate defeat. Exercise, above all, 
is the very thing that is most needed. 

The patient should begin moderately 
at first, daily increasing the time and the 
tensity of the work until a balance is 
established between the intake and the 
outflow of blood to the heart. 

For foods to be eaten and omitted in 
cases of heart trouble, see p. 573. Also 
see menus for Fermentation. 



DIS-EASES OF THE SKIN 

There are two distinct kinds of skin 
dis-eases, namely — 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 575 

1 Local 

2 Constitutional 

The local is that which manifests itself 
in the form of pimples or eruptions which 
come and go, and are of only a few days' 
duration. The second, or constitutional 
kind, is that which manifests itself by a 
permanent irritation or inflammation, 
which is classified as eczema, psoriasis, 
etc. 

DIS-EASES OF THE SKIN— THE CAUSE 

The local or temporary disorders are 

caused and controlled entirely by diet, 

usually overeating. Some- 

Local disorders . ... 

times overmgestion or some 
one particular food; for instance, too 
much acid taken in the form of berries, 
or citrus-fruits, will often produce an 
eruption or a rash within a few hours 
after eating. 



I 



576 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

That form of pimples or eruptions 

caused by overeating is usually augmented 

by constipation or by some 

Eruptions aug- . „ . . . 

mented by lorm oi mtcstmai congestion, 
autointoxica- which has bccu given the 
impressive title of autoin- 
toxication. Autointoxication is a broad 
word that seems to have been invented, 
not for the purpose of explaining, but 
for the purpose of evading the necessity 
of explaining. The meaning of this word 
(self -poisoning) has been narrowed down 
by the profession to describe the above 
conditions, but in reality it should be 
applied to all forms of self-poisoning by 
overeating; eating the wrong combina- 
tions of food; the use of all stimulants 
and narcotics, such as tobacco, tea, coffee, 
liquor and wines of all kinds. In fact, 
self -poisoning from the last-named sources 
is as common as from errors in eating, 
and much more difficult to control. 

Nearly all dis-eases are traceable di- 
rectly to unexcreted poisons which the 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 577 

body has been unable to throw off. 
These poisons are from two sources: 

1 The natural poisons or gases 
that accumulate in the body under 
normal conditions, which, if pre- 
vented in any manner from passing 
off, will cause some kind of dis- 
order which would come under the 
head of autointoxication. 

2 The poisons that accumulate 
under abnormal conditions, such 
as hitherto described, and which 
are very often made manifest by 
eruptions of the skin. 

That form of skin dis-ease known as 
eczema has baffled the medical world for 
many centuries. It has hith- 
disorders"'^^ crto bccu treated locally by 
the most skilled and learned 
specialists, in the belief that it was of 
bacteriological origin, but modern experi- 
ments in the field of food chemistry have 



578 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

demonstrated the fact that it can be cured 
by scientific feeding, therefore it is only 
fair to assume that its origin or primary 
cause is due to some form of self -poison- 
ing, caused by errors in eating and faulty 
metabolism. 

DIS-EASES OF THE SKIN— THE TREATMENT 

If a rash should appear on the skin 
after eating acid fruit or berries, one vv ould 
naturally know the remedy; namely, 
omit acids, limit the quantity of food 
at the next meal, drink copiously of pure 
water and breathe an abundance of 
fresh air. The same general remedy 
should be observed in all cases. 

The pimples or eruptions will gradu- 
ally disappear when the causes are re- 
PreUminary movcd, and the samc rule 
dZ^^seslT will apply to eczema or any 
the skin chrouic form of skin irrita- 

tion. The patient should first be put 
upon a short fast of two or three days' 



i 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 579 

duration, and caused to perspire freely 
each day for an hour or so. This can be 
accompHshed by the aid of the Turkish 
bath, but preferably by exercise. On the 
first day the fast should be broken by 
taking either the juice of such fruits as 
plums, peaches, apples, grapes, and pears, 
or the juice of cantaloup and watermelon. 

DIET FOR DIS-EASES OF THE SKIN 

The diet should be gradually broadened by the 
addition of green salads, uncooked carrots, onions 
and turnips, and a limited quantity of such 
cooked vegetables as spinach, asparagus, squash, 
fresh corn, green peas or beans when in season. 
Later, the diet should be confined mainly to egg 
wMtes, skimmed milk, nuts, sweet fruits, salads, 
fresh green vegetables, including a very Umited 
quantity of sugar and coarse cereals, two or 
three times a week. 

DIET FOR CHRONIC ECZEMA 

In extreme and chronic cases of eczema the diet 
should be confined entirely to green salads, 
sweet fruits, fresh vegetables, and about two 
ounces of olive-oil daily, feeding the body always 
somewhat below its normal requirements as 
indicated by hunger. 



580 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Under this diet and regimen the patient 
will, of course, lose weight and possibly 
strength, but the body will so completely 
make use of all nutrition and the elimina- 
tion of all waste will be made so com- 
pletely, through the excretory channels, 
that the dis-ease will gradually disappear, 
owing to the removal of its primary causes. 

For "Sweet Fruits," see Lesson VIII, 
p. 313. 

APPENDICITIS 

There are three large colons in the in- 
testinal tract which form an inverted 
U, the "ascending," "transverse," and 
"descending" colons. The descending 
colon is situated on the left side, its lower 
part opening into the rectal cavity. The 
ascending colon, located on the right side, 
connects with the small intestines, while 
the transverse colon goes across at a 
point opposite the navel, connecting the 
two. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 581 

To the lower part of the ascending 
colon is attached the vermiform appen- 
dix. Authorities are much 

The vernu- 

form appendix divided as to the function of 
a useful organ ^his Organ. Many ckim that 
it is a rehc of anthropoid man, while 
others contend that it is a useful and 
important part of the anatomy. In the 
opinion of the writer it secretes a valuable 
digestive fluid and therefore performs 
a function valuable both to digestion and 
to alimentation. In the ascending colon 
is the only place in the thirty -six feet of 
intestinal tubing where the fecal matter 
must rise against the law of gravity, 
therefore, if there is any congestion 
throughout this canal, it is most hkely to 
occur in this colon. While the bowels 
may seem to act normally, yet, owing to 
the tremendous amount of waste matter 
necessary to be conveyed from the body, 
and the peristaltic action involved in 
moving it along, especially at this point, 
some of the fecal matter often lodges 



582 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

under the small folds and in the flexuous 
surfaces of this colon, decomposing and 
causing an acute form of inflammation. 
The vermiform appendix, being attached 
to this inflamed colon, becomes inflamed 
also. In other words, this inoffensive and 
useful little organ suffers the penalty of 
being in bad company. 

Thus it is seen that appendicitis, so- 
called, is merely a form of fevered or 

irritated colon; hence the old- 
c°o^/cl'^°°"' fashioned diagnosis— "bowel 

inflammation" — before ap- 
pendicitis became popular, and profit- 
able, was in reality correct. Knowing the 
cause — the physiology of appendicitis — 
the remedy becomes a simple one. 

APPENDICITIS— THE SYMPTOMS 

The symptoms of appendicitis (bowel 
inflammation) are usually pain, at times 
sharp, but generally dull, in the lower 
abdomen on the right side. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 583 

APPENDICITIS— THE TREATMENT 
(IN MILD CASES) 

If the pain is dull and intermittent, 
the patient should cease work, especially 
that vocation which necessitates being 
on foot, and spend at least twenty-four 
hours, most of the time in a sitting or 
reclining position. All such substances 
as meat, cereal and cereal products, 
sweets, milk, tea, coffee, cocoa, and all 
stimulating beverages should be omitted. 

The patient should take a high enema 

(knee or chest position) of lukewarm 

water, thus removing as 

femedT ^^^^ ^^ ^^^^ cougcsted fccal 

matter as possible. Take 
from two to three tablespoonfuls of olive- 
oil, and two or three cups of hot water. 
If grapes are in season, about a pound 
of blue or Concord grapes (very ripe) 
should be eaten, swallowing skins, seeds 
and pulp, masticating only the skins, 
swallowing the pulp whole. From three 
to five pounds of grapes should be taken 



584 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

in this way during the day, omitting all 
other food except olive-oil and hot water, 
which should be taken in the amounts 
above prescribed about three times a 
day. If grapes are not in season, a cup 
of coarse wheat bran, cooked as a por- 
ridge, should be taken three times a day, 
with olive-oil or butter. 

After the first day or two, the following 
diet should be adopted and continued for 
a few days until the pain has ceased and 
the bowels are restored to normal action: 

BREAKFAST 

A cup of hot water 

Three or four exceedingly ripe bananaa peeled 
and baked in a hot oven 

One egg, whipped five minutes; sugar to taste; 
flavor with lemon or fruit-juice 

A glass of water 

LtTNCHEON 

A salad of an}i.hing green, with nuts 
Liberal portion of boiled onions 

DINNER 

Spinach, or a green salad, same as at luncheon 
Green beans, or peas, if in season; or, carrots 
parsnips, or turnips

586 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 
CHRONIC OR SEVERE CASES OF APPENDICITIS 

The errors in diet that cause fermenta- 
tion and superacidity in the stomach will 
also cause fermentation and inflammation 
in the intestines. 

A constipated condition in the intes- 
tines so hinders the natural flow of food- 
matter that in extreme cases of inflam- 
mation and suppuration the congested 
matter might be forced into the vermiform 
appendix, thus causing what is termed 
"appendicitis," and under these condi- 
tions the removal of the appendix might 
be advisable, but in the opinion of the 
writer more lives have been sacrificed on 
the operating table than the old-fash- 
ioned doctors ever lost from "bowel 
inflammation" before this dis-ease was 
named "appendicitis," and before the 
knife was applied as a remedy. 

A constant kneading of the bowels 
should be administered, with a spherical 
motion from right to left across the upper 



« 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 587 

and from left to right across the lower 
part of the abdomen. There should be 

injected into the rectum a 
lllTcl': tablespoonful of olive-oil, 

followed immediately by an 
enema of hot water at a temperature of 
about 115 degrees. This should be re- 
tained as long as possible. In order to 
aid in this process, the head might be 
lowered, and the feet shghtly elevated so 
as to relieve the strain upon the rectal 
muscles. In very severe cases an ice 
pack may be placed over the lower abdo- 
men for five minutes, followed by the 
spherical massage above mentioned. The 
ice pack and massage may be alternated 
every five minutes until the temperature 
is lowered and the pain relieved. 

From three to four quarts of cool water 
should be taken the first day and all food 
omitted. The second day fruit- juices 
and olive-oil should be administered 
This treatment should be continued for 
several days, or until the pain is relieved, 



588 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

when the diet for milder 3ases may be 
adopted in a reduced or limited form. 

Inasmuch as the taking of grapes, seeds, 
skins and all, and coarse wheat bran is 
directly opposed to the conventional 
methods employed by physicians in treat- 
ing appendicitis, I feel that an explana- 
tion of my thesis becomes necessary. 

All conditions of bowel inflammation 
are caused primarily by congestion of 
fecal matter in the intestinal 
';;;:idL tmct. That which wiU re- 
heve congestion, therefore, 
will, by removing the causes, relieve in- 
flammation. Intestinal congestion has 
become one of the most common dis- 
orders among civilized people, because 
of the fact that a large percentage of 
the coarse material known as cellulose 
fiber has been removed from their food 
by super-civilized methods of prepara- 
tion. For instance, in modern milling 
methods, every trace of cellulose is re- 
moved from the grain, leaving nothing 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 589 

but a white mass of unbalanced food 
material, largely carbohydrates, and the 
peelings are removed from all kinds of 
fruits and vegetables. Thus the diet of 
civilized man has become woefully im- 
poverished in cellulose and mineral salts, 
with the result that there is nothing left 
in the diet to stimulate the liver and the 
peristaltic activity of the intestinal tract. 
This condition is largely aug- 
fi"mz:d''d!e. merited by flesh food, all 
sedative drugs, and intoxi- 
cating drinks which have become so con- 
spicuous in the diet of modern civilization. 
The intestinal (digestive and elimina- 
tive) organs of man, through the millions 
Wh coarse ^^ years of his development, 
food is neces- havc bccu built up on the 
^"^ primitive plan. They have 

been shaped by the process of ages to 
accommodate coarse food, therefore a 
generous amount of non-nutritive cellu- 
lose is absolutely necessary to both the 
digestion of food and the elimination of 



( 



590 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

waste. The liberal use of cereal bran 
puts back into the diet that which mod- 
ern milling methods have taken out of it. 

The use of wheat bran and the seeds of 
grapes in the treatment of appendicitis 

-, ,. , has both a scientific and a 

Remedial 

value of common-sense basis. The 

coarse food j^j-g^jj g^^d the sccds pass iuto 
the various folds, wrinkles and turns of 
the intestines, and sweep out the con- 
gested fecal matter which is undergoing I^J 
decomposition and causing inflammation. 
After the bowels have been thoroughly 
cleansed, the patient should adopt a fresh 
vegetable diet selected from the list here- 
tofore given, drinking an abundance of 
water both at meals and between meals. 
Under these conditions most symptoms 
of appendicitis will disappear, and if the 
diet is made to consist of a sufficient 
quantity of coarse food, all causes of bowel 
inflammation will be removed.

Most people aflflicted with obesity are 
also afflicted with abnormal appetite, 
therefore at the outset they may undergo 
some deprivation^ but if this is not yielded 
to, hunger will soon become normal. 

The appetite for an excessive quantity 
of food is very much like the appetite 
for coffee, intoxicants, or tobacco, and 
when the appetite once becomes abnormal 
and is not held under control, either 
obesity or chronic autointoxication will 
be the result. 

Luncheon should be omitted unless 
very hungry.

From one to two glasses of water should 
be drunk at each of these meals. 

The accumulation of gas after meals 
can be largely controlled by extreme 
mastication, very slow, deliberate eating, 
and copious water-drinking at meals. 

If constipated, take, immediately on 
rising and just before retiring, a half 
pound of grapes, swallowing the skins, 
seeds and pulp. Do not masticate the 
seeds or pulp. If preferred, half a cup of 
coarse wheat bran may be taken twice 
daily instead of grapes. 

If the bowels should become slightly 
lax, the seeds of the grapes should be 
omitted at night.

after that, it is a thing that must be

Note : I would advise a spirometer for 
measuring the capacity of the lungs. 
The normal lung capacity for a man 
5 feet 7 to 10 inches in height should be 
about 300 cubic inches, and for a woman 
5 feet 3 inches, 180 to 200 cubic inches. 
The ability to use surplus food, which 
the appetite will continue to demand 
for some time, will depend upon the 
amount of exercise and deep breathing 
taken, and the consequent lung capacity.

increasing the quantity of food taken 
at each meal, if demanded by Normal 
Hunger.

Fourth Day: Same as the third. 

Fifth Day: Same as the first, repeat- 
ing these menus for about thirty days, 
making such variations in vegetables and 
fruits as demanded by normal hunger. 

These menus will seem insufficient in 
quantity measured by appetite, but appe- 
tite, which comes from irritation of the 
mucous surface of the stomach, is not a 
safe guide. 

See menus for "No Appetite," p. 1081. 

The greatest difficulty will be expe- 
rienced the first week. After that, nature 
will begin her process of adjustment, and 
the patient will begin to reduce in weight 
and gain in strength; sleep will become 
more restful and the sleepy and drowsy 
feeling after meals will gradually disap- 
pear. 

The following natural laws should be 
rigidly observed:

COLDS 

A cold, in its last analysis, is merely a 
form of congestion throughout the capil- 
lary vessels of the body. It 
Cause 1 ^^y have been caused by 

exposure — a draft of cold air blowing 
upon some exposed part of the body, in 
which case Nature closes the pores of the 
skin in self-defense. The poisons that 
are constantly being eliminated through 
the pores are thus prevented from escap- 
ing through these channels, and are 
picked up by the circulation, and carried 
to the lungs to be burned with oxygen. 
The lung capacity being too limited, or 
the amount of poison too great. Nature 
suppurates these poisons and throws 
them off in the form of mucus. 

When a quantity of food, greater than 

the body can use, is taken and ingested 

into the circulation, the ex-

in the same manner as above described, 
and the same form of congestion and 
elimination takes place; therefore, colds 
caused by exposure and overeating are 
alike in every respect except their origin. 



916 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

The experience of the writer has been 
that congestion, which we term colds, is 
caused much more frequently from over- 
eating than from exposure. 

The logical remedy in either case is to 
limit the quantity of food to the minimum 
and to confine the diet, as nearly as 
possible, to readily soluble and readily 
digestible foods, such as nuts, fruit salads, 
and fresh watery vegetables, taking only 
suflBcient nitrogenous and carbohydrate 
compounds to balance the daily bill of 
fare.

NASAL CATARRH 

The following menus, in their various 
groups, are composed of the most easily- 
digested foods that will give to the body 
all the elements of nourishment it re- 
quires, during the several seasons of the 
year. 

The calories of energy, remedial ele- 
ments and counteractive properties these 
menus contain, have been very carefully 
compiled from long experience in the 
treatment of catarrh. The nutritive 
factors they contain are proportioned or 
leveled so that under ordinary conditions 
there will be no deficiency to produce 
unnatural craving, and no surplus to be 
decomposed and converted into mucous 
or catarrhal discharges. 

These menus contemplate a normal 
body, living under normal conditions. 
If one should be exposed to excessive 
cold, the carbohydrates (sugar and 
starches) and fats may be slightly in- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 923 

creased, and if exposed to excessive heat 
these articles should be limited somewhat 
below the amount prescribed. If one is 
engaged in heavy manual labor the 
proteid factor such as is contained in 
beans, eggs, fish, and cheese may be 
increased, and if performing no labor, 
these things should be reduced even below 
the amount prescribed. 

These menus will have a tendency to 
establish normal digestion and assimila- 
tion of food, and normal elimination of 
waste. When this is accomplished, the

SuflScient water should be drunk at

up to about 66 per cent of the whole. 
This will require from one to three ordin- 
ary glasses, depending largely upon the 
amount of residual water in the foods 
composing the meal. 

See "Uses of Water in the Body," 
Lesson II, Vol. I, p. 53. 

See also "Water-drinking in Cases of 
Superacidity," Vol. II, p. 434. 

Water performs another very valuable 
service. When one eats too many sweets, 
he should drink an abundance of water. 
This prevents stomach-acidity, and con- 
sequent fermentation and irritation of 
the mucous lining of the stomach. It 
also prevents torpidity of the liver, which 
usually follows the excessive use of 
sweets. 

Two or three glasses of water taken at 
an ordinary meal will all be retained and 
used by the body, while the same quan- 
tity of water taken from two to three 
hours after a meal, will nearly all pass off 
in the form of urine.

These menus are composed largely of 
proteids in their most soluble and digest- 
ible forms — a most important factor in 
remedial feeding, especially in cases of 
either stomach or nasal catarrh. 

One or two glasses of water should be 
drunk at each of these meals. Mastica- 
tion should be perfect before any water 
is taken into the mouth. 

The bowels should be kept normal by 
the use of wheat bran.

INFLUENZA 

In treating influenza heavy starchy-

be omitted, and the diet confined largely 
to fresh vegetables and the more soluble 
proteids, such as egg whites and butter- 
milk, with now and then a limited 
quantity of fish or fowl for a change. 

Fats and sugars should be limited very 
materially and a liberal quantity of 
coarse articles such as wheat bran, celery, 
grapes, and green salads eaten when in 
season. 

The patient should exercise great care 
in regard to quantity, endeavoring always 
to Umit the quantity of food somewhat 
below the demands of normal hunger. 

The menus for colds, catarrh, hay 
fever, and asthma may be used for in-

necessary elements of nutrition.

To increase vital energy depends not 
so much upon the quantity as upon the 
amount of food ingested or assimilated. 
These menus are rather light for one of 
low vitality, but they are made to meet 
the requirements of one suffering from 
nervousness and insomnia. If, however, 
these conditions do not prevail, the quan- 
tity may be increased, but the combi-

If the bowels are constipated, observe 
the instructions given for the Spring 
Menu. 

Exercise, in all rheumatic conditions, 
is very important, and while the tempera- 
ture of the summer weather aids in elim- 
inating poisons from the body, vigorous 
exercise should be taken in order to give 
Nature all the help possible. 

Rheumatism is merely a form of con- 
gestion throughout the capillary vessels 
of the body. The cure, therefore, is first 
to remove the causes by taking into the 
body only such foods as it will use, 
and use completely; secondly, to aid 
Nature in casting out all poisons, thereby 
establishing perfect elimination.

MENUS FOR CONSUMPTION 

WEAK LUNGS— CONSUMPTION 

For many centuries consumption, or 
the various forms of tuberculosis have 
preyed upon the human race, yet science 
has so far failed to give us one reliable 
artificial remedy. We must perforce 
turn to Nature, the only remedy now 
known being oxygen or common air. 

The consumptive or tubercular patient 
should provide some way to live out-of- 
doors, day and night, winter and summer, 
unless the weather is extremely cold. 

The next important factor in treating 
this dis-ease is food. 

The diet should consist of the richest 
and the most readily digestible foods, in 
the following groups, given in the order 
of their importance: 





CARBO-

The patient should drink an abundance 
of water, take vigorous exercise and deep 
breathing, and eat liberally of grapes 
before breakfast, when they are in season. 

A spirometer should be secured, and 
an effort made to increase the capacity 
of the lungs one cubic inch each day 
until their utmost capacity has been 
reached. 

The following menus are merely sug- 
gestive. They may be changed, selecting 
the articles mentioned in the foregoing

TENDENCY TOWARD INTESTINAL 

CONGESTION 



The following menus are laid out with 
the view of giving the greatest amount 
of tissue-building food which require the 
least effort in digestion. 

There is nothing more valuable in the 
treatment of lung trouble than extreme 
deep breathing. After pure blood is 
made, the way to keep it pure is to keep 
it charged with oxygen, and the only way 
to do this is to breathe an abundance of 
fresh air into the lungs. 



BREAKFAST 

A bunch of grapes 

Three or four eggs, whipped five or six minutes, 
into which whip a teaspoonful of sugar, and a 
teaspoonful of Cognac brandy or lemon juice, to 
each egg 



Note: The brandy is germicidal and 
aids in the digestion of the egg yolks.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1009 



LUNCHEON 

From three to four eggs, prepared as for 
breakfast, slightly increasing the quantity of 
sugar and brandy. Put in a heaping teaspoonful 
of sugar and a dessert-spoonful of brandy, and add 
a full glass of milk to each egg 



DINNER 

Any one or two fresh vegetables, including 
something green, as spinach or lettuce 
The fresh vegetables may consist of: 

A baked potato Squash 

Onions Turnips 

Parsnips 

The patient may have a few grapes 
between meals and a few an hour after 
dinner. He should swallow the seeds 
and pulp whole, and masticate and swal- 
low the skins. He should eat plenty of 
fresh eggs, fresh milk, and ripe, sweet 
grapes. The milk and the eggs are good 
tissue-building foods, while sugar is a 
carbohydrate and makes a good winter 
food. The grapes are full of grape-sugar, 
which is an excellent nutrient, and also 
an aid to the digestion of other foods.

SPRING MENU 

. ECZEMA 

Whether or not eczema is a dis-ease 
caused by bacteria, it is obvious that the 
weapon with which to combat this dis- 
order is pure blood with an abundance 
of the white corpuscles. These phago- 
cytes of the blood may be properly called 
the police of the body. 

The patient should observe the fol- 
lowing general rules: 

Drink an abundance of pure water both 
at meals and between meals. Omit cane- 
sugar and all acids. 

Dress as lightly as possible, and do 
not wear woolen garments next to the 
skin. 

Take sufficient vigorous exercise each 
day to cause perspiration. If this cannot 
be done, the Turkish bath should be 
resorted to once a week. 

Spend as much time in the open air as 
possible. 

The meals should be substantially as 
follows :

ECZEMA 

Either of the following menus may be 
chosen for a period of ten or twenty days. 
They are designed especially for the 
removal of all forms of autointoxication 
or self-poisoning which sometimes mani- 
fest themselves by skin eruptions. While 
autointoxication may not be the primary 
cause of eczema, it augments all zymotic 
conditions. The chief purpose of these 
menus is to give to the body an oppor- 
tunity to throw off the dis-ease by re- 
moving all obstacles. I would therefore 
advise that the use of tobacco, tea, coffee, 
and all alcoholic stimulants be omitted.

1020 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Just before retiring, devote from three

their extreme capacity. Do not carry 
any of these exercises, however, to a 
point beyond ordinary fatigue. Divide 
the exercise period, both night and morn- 
ing, into three or four two-minute heats. 

Exercise and deep breathing are second 
in importance to diet, and should be taken 
daily, night and morning. 

Drink from one to two glasses of water 
at each meal, but do not take water into 
the mouth until mastication is perfect. 

Second Day: The same as the first, 
slightly increasing the quantity of food 
until normal hunger is satisfied.

MENUS FOR THE PREGNANT WOMAN AND FOR 
THE NURSING MOTHER 

IMPORTANCE OF FOOD DURING PREGNANCY 

There is nothing so important, or that 
wields so much influence over the com- 
fort, the health, and the life of the preg- 
nant woman as her food, and there is 
nothing, perhaps, to which she gives so 
little attention. 

The diet of the prospective mother, of 
course, governs her digestion and assimi- 
lation of food, and elimination of waste 
matter from the body. These things 
control her health almost completely, 
and inasmuch as all mental conditions 
are principally governed by health, the 
intellectual faculties of the child are 
shaped largely by the condition of the 
mother's digestion. It is obvious, there- 
fore, that the health of the mother and 
the entire future of the child depend 
more upon her diet during pregnancy 
than upon any other one thing. 



1034 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

During pregnancy the prospective 
mother should avoid all such articles of 
food as she would withhold from her 
baby after birth. This would eliminate 
from her diet meat, condiments, sweets, 
especially pastries and rich desserts; tea, 
coffee, and all stimulating and intoxicat- 
ing beverages. 

The pregnant woman should balance 
her diet carefully as to the proportion of 
proteids, carbohydrates, fats, and mineral 
salts. 

As leading foods containing these nutri- 
ents, I would recommend the following: 









VEGETABLES 








RICH IN 




CARBOHY- 




MINERAL 


PHOTEIDS 


DRATES 


PATS 


SALTS 


Milk 


Potatoes 


Nuts 


Lettuce 


Eggs 


Wheat (whole)

Celery 


Pine nuts 


Com

Dried beans 




Beets 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1035 



Fowl Dried peaa 


Fresh beanfl 


Dried beans Chestnuts 


Fresh peas 


Dried peas Honey 


Okra 


Cream cheese Sugar , 


Eggplant 


Sirups 


Turnips 




Cauliflower 



Some articles are listed under two 
headings. This is because they are rich 
in both classes of nutrition. 

The amount of grain products eaten 
by the prospective mother should be 
somewhat limited, ranging between four 
and eight ounces a day, governed by 
work or activity. Cereals, especially 
corn, rice, and oats, are rich in phosphate 
of lime, which is the bone-making or 
structural food. While enough of this 
should be eaten to give the child sufficient 
bone-building material, too much makes 
birth difficult, and sometimes fatal. 

The following menus contain sugges- 
tions as to the selections, combinations, 
and proportions of food that would com- 
pose a healthy bill of fare for both mother 
and child for the several seasons of the 
year:

THE NURSING MOTHER 

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE DIET 

The nursing mother should omit all 
acid fruits, pickles, and condiments con- 
taining vinegar. She should eat sparingly 
of sweets, especially of the pastry and 
soda-fountain variety. She should omit 
such vegetables as radishes, cucumbers, 
cabbage, and sourcrout. 

Fresh corn and dried beans often 
produce serious intestinal trouble in the 
young child. Eggs should never be eaten 
when there is the slightest fever. 

The diet of the nursing mother should 
be confined chiefly to the more readily 
digestible foods such as are named in the 
menus which follow. 



SUGGESTIONS FOR NURSING 

The mother should remember that her 
baby should never be nursed when she is 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1041 

tired, fatigued, overheated, angry, fright- 
ened, excited, or laboring under any 
mental disturbance. Both her mental 
and her physical condition are instantly 
conveyed to the child, through her milk, 
often in exaggerated form. Children are 
sometimes thrown into convulsions by 
nursing the breast of an excited mother. 



SUGGESTIONS FOR RELIEVING INTESTINAL 
CONGESTION 

If either mother or child has a tendency 
toward intestinal congestion (constipa- 
tion), the mother should take wheat 
bran, thoroughly cooked, with both the 
morning and the evening meal; or, a few 
drops of prune juice, given to the child, 
will often relieve this condition, while 
affording an excellent source of nourish- 
ment.

This menu is for the purpose of building 
tissue. It contains enough carbohydrate 
matter to give a reasonable amount of 
fat and bodily warmth, provided it can 
be assimilated. Eggs are an excellent 
proteid food, when taken uncooked, 
whipped with a very little sugar. The 
number may be increased as digestion 
improves.

BUILDING UP THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
INCREASING VITALITY 

On rising, drink two glasses of water, 
eat a little of some juicy fruit, and devote 
as much time as possible to vigorous deep 
breathing exercises before dressing. In 
taking these movements, inflate the lungs 
to their fullest capacity, and hold the 
breath for half a minute while executing 
one or two movements. In this way 
the cell capacity of the lungs can, in many 
instances, be doubled. Large lung ca- 
pacity is of primary importance in cases 
of nervousness.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1055 

About two glasses of water should be 
drunk at each of these meals — half a 
glass at the beginning, a glass during the 
progress of the meal, and half a glass at 
the close. 

These meals are rather liberal, and if 
there should be the slightest fullness 
experienced after eating, the quantity- 
should be reduced. The breakfasts are 
light, and one might add slightly to them 
if they do not satisfy normal hunger. 

Mastication should be perfect. Eating 
should be very deliberate. Avoid heavy 
reading or earnest conversation while 
eating; these disturb the flow of saliva 
and prevent thorough mastication. 

A cup of wheat bran, well cooked, 
should be taken with the morning and 
the evening meal about twice or three 
times a week. 

A glass of water and the juice of a 
sweet orange may be taken just before 
retiring, and exercises as prescribed.

SPRING MENU 

NO APPETITE 



A very sharp distinction should be 
drawn between appetite and hunger. 
Appetite is a cultivated desire expressed 
through a sense of Craving. Hunger is 
the normal demand for food, expressed 
through the salivary glands. Appetite 
is the desire for liquor, coffee, tobacco, 
morphin, etc., and for food when one 
habitually overeats. It is expressed by an 
empty feeling or craving in the stomach, 
while hunger is felt only in the salivary 
glands, and in the region of the throat and 
the mouth. Appetite weakens the body; 
hunger stimulates thought and action. 

Normal hunger can be produced by 
limiting the quantity of food below the 
actual needs of the body, for three or four 
days, or perhaps a week. 

When normal hunger returns, the quan- 
tity may be increased, but the combina- 
tions should be observed for a week or two. 

The following are limited menus com- 
posed of foods that will produce hunger 
after the third or fourth day: 



1082 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

On rising, devote at least five minutes 
to vigorous deep breathing exercise before 
an open window, or in the open air. Take 
a bit of juicy fruit and a glass of water. 

BREAKFAST 

Cherries or berries (very ripe) ; neither cream 
nor sugar 

A banana, very ripe, eaten with two egg whites, 
thoroughly whipped, and a very little thin cream 

LUNCHEON 

A green salad 

One fresh vegetable ; peas or asparagus preferred 

A new potato 

DINNER 

A green salad, with nuts 

Two fresh vegetables 

A whipped egg or a cup of junket 

It may be well to omit the noon meal 
for the first three or four days. 

If there is the slightest tendency toward 
constipation, a tablespoonful or two of 
wheat bran, cooked, should be taken at 
both the morning and the evening meal. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1083 

A glass of water should be drunk just 
before retiring, and at least ten minutes 
devoted to exercise and deep breathing. 

As appetite returns, the quantity of 
food may be increased, and a few heavier 
articles added, such as coarse cereal for 
breakfast, and a bit of fish or an omelet 
for dinner.

WINTER MENU 

FOR MENTAL WORKER 
TO INCREASE BRAIN EFFICIENCY 

Eggs, milk, and sugar are the most 
readily convertible nutrients known to 
the science of food chemistry. In com- 
bination they represent the highest form 
of the nitrogenous (proteids and the 
carbohydrate) compounds, therefore to 
increase physical efficiency one should 
take as much of these as possible. 

If one is under weight, it would be 
advisable, especially during the cold 
weather, to take three eggs for breakfast, 
four eggs with a quart of milk for lunch- 
eon, and a vegetable dinner as laid out 
in Menu II.

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE PREVENTION OF 
SUNSTROKE 

From one to two glasses of cool water 
should be drunk at each of these meals. 

Mastication of every atom should be 
complete. 

Hurried eating is the most prolific 
cause of fermentation. Fermentation is 
the cause of intestinal gas, sour stomach 
and indigestion, also constipation and 
torpid liver. 

Avoid stimulants such as tea, coffee, 
tobacco, beer, or liquors. These things 
excite heart activity, which causes exces- 
sive body-heat. 

Avoid sweets, especially sweet soda- 
fountain drinks. Sugar is composed 
largely of carbon, and carbon is one of 
Nature's greatest heat-makers. 

Confine the diet largely to semi-acid 
fruits, fresh vegetables, green salads, 
milk, eggs, nuts, and a very limited 
quantity of bread and cereal products. 

Cereal starch is the most diflacult of all 
carbohydrate matter to digest. 

Drink an abundance of pure water at 
meals and between meals. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 1137 

Avoid all mixed-up, sweetened and 
charged water. There is nothing better 
than plain spring or distilled water. 

Do not eat too many things at the same 
meal. Three or four articles are sufficient. 

Avoid meat of all kinds, and eat a very 
limited quantity of fats. 

By all means do not overeat. Every 
atom of food taken into the body that is 
not used must be cast off at a tremendous 
expense of energy. The casting-off pro- 
cess is what we call dis-ease. 

Every housewife and mother should 
know enough about the chemistry of food 
to avoid serving at the same meal things 
which are chemically inharmonious. 

If these simple laws were observed, 
sunstrokes and heat prostrations would 
be almost unheard of. 

Summer is the time when Nature is 
rebuilding and revitalizing all forms of 
animal life; it is also the time when she 
is producing all of the material with 
which to do this building in its best and 
purest form, therefore summer should 
be the time when people are at their best. 
The reason they are not is because they 
do not understand the simple laws that 
govern human nutrition.

selecting such vegetables as appeal most 
to the taste. 

If the bowels should become consti- 
pated, take half a cup of cleansed wheat 
bran, cooked, with the breakfast, and, 
just before retiring, another half cup in 
hot water. 

If possible, spend from two to three 
hours each day in the open air, taking 
vigorous exercise. Oxygen is nature's 
great stimulant and life-giver. 

Eat slowly and masticate very thor- 
oughly. 

If there is a tendency toward obesity, 
sugar should be omitted from the meals 
entirely. 

Proteid foods should predominate in 
the diet. The following are the most 
soluble and readily assimilable group of 
proteid foods suitable for these menus, 
given in the order of richness and im- 
portance : 

Eggs Shell-fish Gelatin 

Milk Fish Fowl — white meat

chemical changes produced by cooking 

The application of heat to food is com- 
paratively of recent origin in the evolu- 
tion of mankind. The use of fire involves 
a certain amount of mental ingenuity, 
and could not be practised by man's 
anthropoid ancestors. Anthropoid ani- 
mals, whether human or ape, have a 
great amount of curiosity for the unusual 
and the new. 

Man probably began his cooking ex- 
periments by soaking hard foods in warm 
water, then in hot water, or by warming 
cold foods at his camp-fire. As heat 

593 



594 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

volatilizes the pleasant odorous substance 
present in many foods, the custom of 
heating them probably became popular. 
The habit of cooking spread, as many 
other novel and interesting customs have 
spread, from this primitive process to the 
French chef, regardless of whether the 
results were beneficial or harmful. 

The question whether foods should be 
eaten cooked or uncooked can best be 
answered by examining the chemical 
and mechanical changes produced in the 
process of cooking, and their consequent 
physiological effects. 

Cooking may be divided into two 
classes, namely. Moist Heat and Dry 
Heat. To illustrate: 

Sugars are not chemically affected by 
boiling with water, while starch, cooked 
with boiling water, or steam, 
Tsl^ls"'' absorbs from three to five 
times its bulk of moisture, 
and changes into a soft, pasty, or semi- 
dissolved mass. Under dry heat, sugars 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 595 

are converted into a brown substance, 
known as caramel, while starch cooked 
under a temperature of 300° to 400° of 
dry heat, is changed into a dextrin, of 
which toast and zwieback are examples. 
Fats are not changed chemically by 
moist heat; that is, by being boiled in 

water, but the globules are 
of'fats"^^''* melted and the hot fat 

spreads in a film over other 
material which may be present. In dry 
heat, fats are chemically decomposed, 
forming irritating vapors. The odors of 
frying fat are due to the presence of 
small quantities of these decomposition 
products. In larger quantities, and with 
greater heat, these substances are ex- 
ceedingly irritating to the mucous mem- 
brane of the stomach and the intestines. 
The chemical changes produced by 

heating proteids are of 
of prlttids*** much more importance than 

are those which take place 
in other foods. Simple proteids, such 



596 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

as albumin and globulin, are coagulated 
at a temperature of about 160°. This 
change is familiar in the coagulation of 
egg whites under low temperature. Other 
proteids undergo similar changes, gov- 
erned by the degree and kind of heat (dry 
or moist), to which they are subjected. 
This change in proteid material con- 
tinues with the application of pro- 
longed heat, until the proteid, under 
dry heat, is converted into a dark 
brittle mass, wholly insoluble and indi- 
gestible. V 

If the student will take the white of an 
egg, and bake it for some time in an oven, 
he will observe the coagulation or hard- 
ening of the proteid. The chemical 
nature of this change is one of great 
complexity. The molecules combine with 
each other, forming almost indestructible 
substances. The combined or coagulated 
forms of proteid are represented in 
nature by horns, hoofs, finger nails, and 
hair. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 597 
STARCH DIGESTION— COOKED AND UNCOOKED 

The student will remember the refer- 
ence made in Lesson V to experiments 
Comparative conceming the digestibility 
^ok?d''andU- of Starch when taken in 
cooked grain various forms. In these ex- 
periments, though conducted for the 
purpose of demonstrating the supposed 
advantage of excessive cooking, the re- 
sults showed that at the time the con- 
tents of the stomach were removed, all 
the proteids of the uncooked grain had 
been digested, while the percentage of 
proteid digested from the various forms 
of cooked grain grew less as the cooking 
was increased. As the chief function 
of the gastric juice is the digestion of 
proteids, the real significance of the above 
experiments was exactly the opposite 
from that which was intended to be 
proved. 

The statement is frequently made that 
the starch of grain cannot be digested 



598 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

without cooking, because the cells enclos- 
ing the starch grains have indigestible or 
insoluble cellulose walls. 

Reasons given 

for cooking The old thcory is that cook- 
starch j^g expands the starch and 
ruptures or tears down these walls, 
freeing the contents so that the digestive 
juices may act upon the enclosed starch 
granules. This is a theory unsupported 
by facts. The cell walls on the interior 
of the grain kernel are very filmy, and 
in the mature grain scarcely exist at all. 
The analysis of wheat flour shows only 
a trace of cellulose fiber. Were these 
cellulose walls within the wheat grain, as 
this theory commonly teaches, flour 
would show a liberal quantity of cellulose. 
The cellulose wall theory, as a necessity 
for cooking starch, is an excellent illustra- 
tion of the ease with which a groundless 
statement or theory may be used to prove 
or to explain some popular prejudice. 

In the process of cooking, the tendency 
is to render the organic salts contained in 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 599 

food entirely inorganic. This change 
from organic to inorganic salts is meas- 
ured by the temperature to which the 
foods are subjected. Many of these salts 
are combined with the nitrogenous con- 
stituents of food, therefore when sub- 
jected to certain degrees of heat they are 
of little value in the construction of the 
proteid molecules within the body. This 
is especially true of fresh or green 
vegetables. 

EXCUSES FOR COOKING OUR FOOD 

Inasmuch as the majority of people 

favor cooking, probably forgetting that 

_ , t- V about half of the food con- 

Ancestral hab- 
its not in- sumed in the world at the 
hented present time is taken in its 

natural or uncooked state, it may be well 
to mention some of the views advanced 
by those who believe that the present 
diet of cooked grain is better for modern 
man than an elementary diet, and who 



600 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

attempt to give a natural explanation. 
One theory is that man has subsisted so 
long upon cooked foods that his organs 
have become fitted for a cooked diet, and 
a cooked diet only. Another view some- 
times advanced is, that while cooked 
foods were originally detrimental, yet by 
continued use man has become fitted for 
such a diet and unfitted for a natural 
diet. These are but other forms of the 
old belief in the inheritance of acquired 
characteristics. This belief, however, is 
steadily losing ground among evolution- 
ists. There is no more reason to believe 
that a modified function of the stomach 
would be inherited, than there is to be- 
lieve that small feet would be inherited 
among the Chinese women just because 
these organs are mutilated by local 
custom. 

The best light of scientific knowledge 
now leads us to believe that the healthy 
child of today is, in its capacity for nutri- 
tion, essentially like the primitive child. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 601 

and would thrive best upon a varied diet 
of natural foods. 

EXPERIMENT UPON ANIMALS 

While I do not claim that the methods 
of animal feeding apply accurately to man, 
yet the digestive and the assimilative 
processes of animals are so closely related 
to the human processes, that the results 
obtained in animal nutrition are very 
instructive to the student of human food 
science. 

About thirty years ago, when the 
scientific study of agriculture first be- 
came prevalent, an experiment was made 
in cooked food for animals, upon an 
extensive basis. At that time it was the 
universal belief that man owed much of 
his superiority over other animals to the 
use of cooked food. This argument was 
put forth with great force and appeared 
quite reasonable. It was asked whether 
animals other than man would be 



602 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

benefited by changing to a cooked bill 
of fare. 

During this agitation numerous west- 
ern farmers put their hogs, chickens. 

Governmental COWS, horSCS, and shccp UpOU 

I'^TZr a cooked bill of fare, and 
for animals many cuthusiastic feeders 
claimed beneficial results. Later the 
various Governmental Experimental Sta- 
tions took up the subject and made many 
careful, complete, and comparative tests 
of the effects of cooked and uncooked 
food for animals. The result did not 
show the expected thing. The cooking 
experiments in the majority of cases 
proved injurious, and the general de- 
cision of the Government investigators 
was that cooking food for animals was 
useless and detrimental to the great 
live stock industry. Stock food cookery 
has now become entirely obsolete. 

Man is the only animal that cooks his 
food, and has made great progress in 
civilization while subsisting on a cooked 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 603 

diet, but cooking is no more the cause of 

his advancement than silk hats and 

^ ,. swallow -tailed coats. He 

Cooking a 

habit of has advanced only according 

thought, studied, and experimented. 
Cooking has undoubtedly enabled man 
to utilize many things as food, that he 
could not and would not have used 
otherwise, but whether this has aided 
or retarded in his material progress is 
yet an unsolved question. 

FOOD COMBINATIONS 

The following tables are designed to 
convey, in the most condensed and sim- 
plified form, the results of my investiga- 
tions in regard to food combinations. 

It is somewhat difficult to give in any 
one table exact information concerning 
food combinations under the varying 
conditions of the body and its ever- 
changing requirements. The best that 



604 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

can be done is to lay out such groups as 
are fundamentally harmonious from a 
chemical point of view. 

The particular condition of the patient 
often reveals certain special requirements 

rs ^_ which must be dealt with 

Quantity an 

important according to the symptoms 
^*"*^' given off by the body. Many 

of these combinations, when taken under 
certain conditions, may appear disagree- 
able, but this can be overcome by leveling 
the proportions and limiting the quantity. 
Quantity is of very great importance for 
the reason that the most perfect selec- 
tions of food can be made and blended 
into perfect chemical harmony, and still 
disagree with the normal stomach if a 
quantity is taken in excess of physical 
demands. 

The use of these tables will serve to 
bring to the student's attention the ad- 
vantage to be gained from a health- 
giving and curative point of view, as 
well as from simplicity in diet. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 605 

In considering the chemical harmony 
of foods, the student should keep in mind 
the time required for digestion, which 
involves not only the question of com- 
bining foods at the same meal, but also 
the taking, within a few hours after 
eating, of other articles that may pro- 
duce chemical inharmony . For example : 
Milk, cereals, and sweet fruits are in 
chemical harmony, but a lemonade in- 
troduced into the stomach an hour or 
two later would produce inharmony, 
and be almost as harmful as if it had been 
taken with the meal. 

There are many injurious combinations 

which the student will learn to omit from 

^ ^ , ^ a sense of taste and instinct, 

Instinct a safe 

guide, if cuiti- and while our instincts have 
^**®*^ in many cases ceased to 

guide us aright, they will rapidly return 

and assume command if given a fair 

opportunity. 

The perfect meal can be made from 

three or four articles, and the entire menu 



606 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

can be changed three times a day, but to 
take eight, ten, or a dozen things at the 
same meal, puts the quantity, as well as 
every article composing the meal, into 
jeopardy. 

After one has eaten a suflficient quan- 
tity of food, and the taste has signalled 
"ENOUGH," something sweet or pun- 
gent is introduced. This puts into activ- 
ity another set of taste buds which will 
accept a given quantity of another food. 
However, the stomach has already given 
off one signal of ''enough," hence every 
pennyweight taken in excess of that 
amount is that much more than should 
be eaten. 

In order to simplify the making of 
harmonious combinations, I have grouped 
the foods whose use I recommend in nine 
different divisions. A further subdivision 
of vegetables and fruits might have been 
made, but this would have increased the 
number of groups, making them more 
complicated and less practical. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 607 

HOW TO INTERPRET THE TABLES 

In order to ascertain the articles with 
which any special food will combine, the 
student should turn to the table headed 
with the desired article of that group. If 
foods from three groups are to be con- 
sidered, the student will look for two of 
them in the first vertical column on the 
left-hand side of the page, and will then 
follow across to the vertical column for 
the third article. 

Figure (1) means especially beneficial 

Figure (2) means good combinations 

Figure (3) means somewhat undesirable 

Figure (4) means particularly harmful 

(a) *Tats with" figure (1), under the 
heading Grains, first table, page 609, 
means that the combination of "fats with 
grains" would be "especially beneficial." 

(b) "Fats and eggs with" figure (2), 
under the heading Milk, page 609, means 
that "fats and eggs with milk" make a 
good combination. 



608 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

(c) 'Tats and milk with" figure (3), 
page 609, under column headed Nuts, 
means a "somewhat undesirable" combi- 
nation. 

(d) "Fats and acid fruits with" figure 
(4), under heading Milk, page 609, means 
that this combination would be "particu- 
larly harmful," etc. 

It is impractical to print ready reference 
tables showing the harmony of more than 
three articles, but the student can judge 
this sufficiently well for himself by com- 
paring the respective harmonies of the 
several foods of the group.

Lesson XIII 

CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS 

AND 

FOOD TABLES 



619 



LESSON XIII 

Simple Classification of Foods 

While there is a dominating substance 
in all foods, yet they usually contain many 
compounds which render them, from a 
chemical standpoint, very difficult to 
classify accurately. For example, the 
principal nutrients in wheat are carbo- 
hydrates (starch and sugar), yet wheat 
contains mineral salts, fat, and protein, 
the latter being a compound consisting of 
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and 
i sulfur. Wheat would, therefore, be 
placed in the carbohydrate class, but it 
would overlap into several other classes. 
What is true of wheat, is true of nearly 
all other articles of food. Furthermore, 
foods do not chemically reproduce them- 
selves when taken into the body, but in 
the process of metabolism they are con- 

621 



622 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

verted either into other elements or into 
other compounds. From this it will be 
understood that the articles listed under 
the following headings are classified ac- 
cording to the nutritive substance which 
predominates in them, and are given for 
the purpose of guiding the practitioner 
in the selection of such foods as will 
supply the various chemical constituents 
of the body. 

Foods which contain two or more 
substances in generous proportions may 
appear under two or more of the following 
headings, as in the case of peanuts. This 
humble article of food contains 19 per 
cent carbohydrates, 20 per cent protein, 
and 29 per cent fat, hence it is listed 
under the three headings — carbohydrates, 
proteids, and fats. 

The tables comprise the best selections 
of food available in all countries and at 
all seasons of the year. They contain 
everything the body needs under the 
varying conditions of age, climate, and 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 623 

activity, except, perhaps, in some parts 
of the frigid zone. 

In compihng these tables I have se- 
lected only such articles of food as 
experience has proved most useful.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 625 

PURPOSES WHICH THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF 
FOOD SERVE IN THE HUMAN BODY 

While all the articles of food in the 
four above-named classifications contain 
other elements than the one under v^hich 
heading they appear, yet the body uses 
or appropriates them for the following 
purposes: 

PURPOSE OF CARBOHYDRATES 

The carbohydrate substance in food is 
used by the body chiefly for the purpose 
of keeping up body- weight; that is, for 
the purpose of supplying the various 
fluids which fill the cell-structure. If one 
is suffering from emaciation, the carbo- 
hydrate element in food should predom- 
inate. While some of the more soluble 
proteids, especially milk and eggs, will 
give a rapid gain in weight, the weight 
will not be permanent unless sufficient 
carbohydrates are taken to supply the 



626 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

blood with all the required elements of 
nutrition, or, in other words, to level or 
to balance the body requirements. 

PURPOSE OF FATS 

Fats are used by the animal body 
primarily for the purpose of producing 
heat. Food is burned or oxidized in 
the blood, undergoing very much the 
same action as does the combustion of 
coal in a grate. The heat thus generated 
is delegated to the blood, and the blood, 
by its circulation, distributes this heat 
throughout the body. The carbon di- 
oxid or waste matter formed during the 
circulation, is carried to the lungs, where 
it reunites with the oxygen which we 
breathe, and thereby again passes back 
into the atmosphere. 

PURPOSE OF PROTEIDS 

Proteid is a compound containing 
chiefly nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET C27 

Its purpose is to form the muscular and 
the tissue structure of the body. To use 
a homely illustration, proteid may be 
compared to the material which makes 
the honeycomb, while the carbohydrate 
substance may be compared to the honey; 
that is, to the fluids which fill the cells, i 

Those performing heavy or active mus- 
cular labor should eat liberally of the 
proteid class of foods. 

Under normal conditions, natural hun- 
ger will call for the quantity of pro- 
teid needed. The tendency, however, 
should be toward the minimum; that is, 
one should take the lowest quantity of 
proteid that the body requires to keep 
up the cell-structure. (See Lesson VI, 
p. 216.) Modern investigations have 
shown that, in many cases of extreme 
athletic tests, a low proteid diet has given 
the greatest endurance. This is ac- 
counted for by the fact that nearly all 
carbohydrates, especially of the grain 
family, contain from 8 to 12 per cent of 



628 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

proteids, which is quite suflficient, in 
many instances, to supply the body with 
all the tissue-building material necessary. 
Inasmuch as the several nutritive ele- 
ments found in a single article of food are 
better proportioned by Nature, than man 
can usually proportion them, the relation 
of one substance to another will be better 
divided if the entire meal be made to 
consist of only one kind of food, and both 
digestion and assimilation will therefore 
be more perfect. Under these conditions 
the blood will be laden with very little 
waste matter, which is the thing that 
reduces our powers of endurance. There- 
fore, when it is possible to secure the 
carbohydrate, the proteid, and the fatty 
substances from a single article of food 
which will give to the body greater 
strength and endurance than when we 
secure these substances from several 
sources, we should confine our menus 
to single articles of well-proportioned 
food. This thought, carried to its logical 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 629 

end, leads one more and more, as ex- 
perience progresses, toward the mono-diet 
system. 

PURPOSE OF MINERAL SALTS 

Mineral salts serve two distinct pur- 
poses in the body: 

1 They assist in building up the 

cartilage and the body-struc- 
ture 

2 They assist in the digestion, and 

in the dissolution of other 
foods, especially of the carbo- 
hydrate group, and more es- 
pecially of the grain family 

Grains are very difficult to subdivide 
into their constituent elements; that is, 
to reduce to a solution so fine that 
assimilation will be perfect. A liberal 
use of the foods containing mineral salts 
aids very materially in this process of 
solution. 



630 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIGESTIBILITY AND 
ASSIMILABILITY 

The true interpretation of the word 
"digestion" is the preparation of food 
by the action of: 

1 The saHva 

2 The gastric juice 

3 The bile, and 

4 The pancreatic juice 

When food is properly prepared by 
mastication by the time it reaches the 
pancreas, it should be thoroughly split 
up or subdivided, in which state it is 
ready for assimilation. 

The true interpretation of the word 
"assimilation" is the absorption of all 
food substances through the walls of the 
intestinal tract, and the final passing 
of them into the circulation. 

It is nothing unusual, however, for a 
person to become afflicted with pre- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 631 

digestion, and, at the same time, with 
poor or faulty assimilation; in other 
words, digestion being too rapid, and 
assimilation being too slow. This condi- 
tion frequently occurs in cases of super- 
acidity. On account of the excess of 
acid, the food digests or passes from the 
stomach prematurely; that is, before it 
has been dissolved by the action of the 
hydrochloric acid. The food, thus super- 
charged with acid, passes from the stom- 
ach into the lower intestines, and sets 
up a condition of irritation. This irrita- 
tion or swelling of the mucous surface 
(lining) of the intestines, closes the small 
canals, or winking valves, as they are 
sometimes called, thus seriously inter- 
fering with the passing of the dissolved 
food matter into the circulation. 

The following table is designed to show 
the comparative assimilability of the 
leading articles of food, together with 
their starch, sugar, and water content:

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 633 

*While all the vegetables mentioned 
in the above table belong to the carbo- 
hydrate class, yet the starch element 
contained in them is very much more 
assimilable than the starch contained 
in grains or legumes, therefore these 
vegetables may be eaten freely by those 
having rheumatic or gouty tendencies. 

The starch and the sugar content in 
fresh vegetables appears low owing to the 
fact that they contain a large percentage 
of water. Eliminating the water, these 
foods rank in their starch and sugar 
content with cereals and legumes, and 
are much more easily digested and assim- 
ilated. In other words, if the chemist 
should reduce the water content to the 
same per cent as that of cereals, the carbo- 
hydrate content would rise in the same 
ratio as the water content is reduced. 
Both the starch and the sugar content 
of these vegetables is more digestible, and 
more readily assimilated than the starch 
and the sugar found in cereals and 
legumes. 



634 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

PURPOSE OF THE VIENO TABLE 

The student should remember that 
not only the quantity but the quality of 
food must be considered. The vieno 
system of food measurement, as herein 
explained, is the simplest system of food 
measurement that has ever been pub- 
lished. It is amply complete, and accur- 
ate enough for the purpose for which it 
is intended, and that is the calculation 
of the energy and the available nitrogen 
contained in natural dietaries. 

This measurement is really a quantita- 
tive measurement; that is, it measures 
the quantity, not the quality. In order 
to have a full knowledge of a bill of fare, 
it is necessary to know, in addition to the 
quantity, the exact chemical nature of 
each particular food, and also to know 
the other foods with which that food will 
combine. 

This food table tells accurately the 
amount of energy that may be derived 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 635 

from food by chemical analysis, but it 
does not tell the amount of energy that 
the body must expend in the work of 
assimilation. This cannot be given in a 
table, because it varies with the individual 
and the condition of his digestive organs. 



Lesson XIV 

VIENO SYSTEM 

OF 

FOOD MEASUREMENT

LESSON XIV 

ViENO System of Food Measurement 

The amount of nutrition contained in a 
given quantity of food is often a deter- 
mining factor in curative dietetics. 

The two most important things to be 
considered in prescribing foods are: 

1 The amount of energy contained 

in a given quantity 

2 The amount of available nitro- 

gen or tissue-building material 
in a given quantity 

ENERGY 

Energy is the power to do work. That 
form of energy with which we are most 
familiar is mechanical energy, as raising 
a stone or turning a wheel. 



640 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

Heat is another form of energy. Heat 
and work can be converted into each 
other. The steam-engine turns heat into 
work, while a ''hot box" on a car-wheel is 
a case of work being turned back into heat. 

Experience shows that a definite 
amount of heat will yield a definite 

Amount of amount of work, so that the 

heat a food amouut of heat produced by 

produces . . j? i? j 

determines a glVCU amOUnt of food, 

Its energy when Combined with oxygen, 
is taken as a measure of its energy. 
This is ordinarily expressed in calories, a 
calorie being the amount of heat required 
to raise the temperature of one thou- 
sand grams of water one degree on the 
centigrade thermometer scale. 

The use of these terms need not concern 
the student. Instead of using the calorie 
I will use a unit which is equal to one 
hundred calories. I have selected a unit 
of this size because it gives about the 
ordinary service of food at meals which 
is easily measured and remembered.

inXROGEN 

Nitrogen is the chemical element that 
is most concerned with the function of 
life. All animal tissue contains nitrogen, 
which forms about one-sixth part, by 
weight, of all the nitrogenous or protein 
substances. 

If we were to take a hundred pounds 

of lean meat, or muscle, and evaporate 

_ ^ . from it all the water, we 

Proportion of ^ ' 

Nitrogen in would havc about eighteen 
lean meat pounds of dry material left. 
If we should analyze this dry substance, 
we would find that about one-sixth, or 
three pounds, would be the element 
nitrogen. Thus we say that muscle 
contains eighteen per cent of protein, or 
three per cent of nitrogen. In ordinary 
practise the protein is mixed with fats 
and salts, and cannot be measured by 
simply drying out the water, so the chem- 
ist finds the amount of nitrogen present 
and multiplies by 6,25 y which gives 



642 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

about the correct per cent of protein. 
This method is not exact because the 
per cent of nitrogen in various proteids 
is not always the same, but it will give 
an intelligent average. I will discard the 
use of the term protein, and refer to the 
amount of nitrogen directly. 

All compounds of the element nitrogen 
are not available as food. For example: 
The nitrogen of the air, of ammonia gas, 
or gunpowder cannot be utilized in the 
animal body. The nitrogen in foods 
only refers to available nitrogen. Com- 
pounds containing other forms of nitro- 
gen are not foods, but are frequently 
poisons. 

SYSTEMS OF FOOD MEASUREMENTS COMPARED 
THE ''OLD" SYSTEM 

Under the old system of food measure- 
ment, feeding the human body cannot be 
made a practical science for the masses, 
therefore a new system becomes neces- 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 643 

sary. That we may more fully appre- 
ciate the value of a new system, let us 
consider the methods hitherto available. 

Suppose a man is using two quarts of 
milk a day, and wishes to determine 
the amount of available nitrogen or 
tissue-building material and energy it 
contains. Under the old system he must | 
get a book on food analysis, or send to 
Washington for a Government bulletin. 
If he does not understand the meaning 
of the terms and figures used, the tables 
would be useless to him until he goes to a 
chemist to have them explained. He is 
now ready to work out the nutritive 
value of his milk, and proceeds as follows : 

First, he gets the number of cu cm 
in the milk, thus — 952.8 (number cu cm 
in 1 quart) x 2 = 1905.6, number of cu cm 
in 2 quarts of milk. Second, he gets the 
weight of his milk in grams — 1.032 (num- 
ber grams in 1 cu cm of milk) x 1905.6 = 
1966.57, number of grams in 2 quarts of 
milk. 



644 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

He now turns to a table of analysis 
which tells him that milk contains 3 per 
cent of protein, 3)^ per cent of fat, and 
4i]/2 per ceiit of sugar. As the amount of 
nitrogen in milk is approximately one- 
sixth of its entire protein, he would now 
get 16 per cent of the 3 per cent (.16 x .03 
= .0048), which is the percentage of 
nitrogen contained in milk. 

His next step would be — 1966.57 (num- 
ber grams in 2 quarts of milk) x .0048 = 
9.44, the number of grams of nitrogen 
in 2 quarts of milk. 

I will not explain the way in which the 
energy would have to be figured, but will 
merely give the arithmetical processes 
by which the result is obtained: 

3 X 4.1 = 12.3 
3.5 X 9.3 = 32.55 
4.5 X 4.1 = 18.45 
12.3 +32.55 + 18.45 = 63.30 
1966.57 X 63.30 = 124483.88 
124483.88 ^ 100 = 1244, the No. of calories or 
energy (heat units) contained in two quarts of milk. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 645 

THE NEW OR *'VIENO" SYSTEM 

To a unit of food-energy which is equal 
to one hundred calories (see last para- 
graph on "Energy"), I have 
ttfrord Vino given the name of Vieno, 
derived from "vital" and 
"energy," and pronounced vi-en-o. The 
Vieno system, therefore, will measure all 
foods by vi-en-os, or units of energy equal 
to one hundred of the chemist's calories. 
One vieno of milk is one-sixth of a quart, 
or two-thirds of an ordinary glass. From 
this it is readily seen that two quarts of 
milk will give twelve vienos of energy, 
or, if we wish to express it in the chem- 
ist's term, twelve hundred calories. 

The table also states that milk has a 

nitrogen factor of .8. Therefore, if we 

How to com- wish to kuow the amount of 

or^t^rge^L nitrogen in the two quarts of 

food milk, all we need do is to 

multiply the number of vienos by the 

nitrogen factor; 12 x .8 = 9.6, which figure 



646 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

represents the nitrogen consumption ex- 
pressed in grams. (See explanation of 
fourth column of table.) These results 
are practically the same as those ob- 
tained by the old system of computation, 
but expressed in simpler terms. Thus we 
see that the vieno system of computing 
food values is unique in its simplicity, 
and will be a very material aid in putting 
Food Science on a practical basis. 



NECESSITY FOR A SIMPLE SYSTEM 

Things are commonly measured by 

volume, or by weight. That volume 

„ .,^ , could not be made suflS- 

Neither volume 

nor weight are cicutly accuratc in the meas- 

Z:tTL urement of food values is 

uring food evident. A bushel of lettuce 

leaves would contain much 

less food value than a bushel of wheat. 

Weight would seem to be a fairer way to 

compare foods, but all foods contain 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 647 

water, which may vary from five to 
ninety-five per cent. A pound of tur- 
nips, which is nine-tenths water, would 
not be comparable with sugar, which has 
scarcely any water. 

Even if it were not for the water, 
weight would not be a fair method of 
comparison because some foods are of 
more value per pound than others, owing 
to their difference in chemical composi- 
tion. For instance, a pound of butter 
gives about two and one-fourth times 
as much heat to the body as sugar. 

As before mentioned, the two chief 
food factors which we ought to measure 
are energy-producing and tissue-building 
power. j 

All true foods when assimilated in thai 
body produce some energy. In fact, ^ 

What consti- ^^'^ ^^^^ substauccs as pro- 

tutes a true ducc bodily energy, when 

combined with the oxygen 

taken in through the lungs, can be 

correctly termed food. 



648 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

I have taken this energy-producing 
power of food as the best basis for meas- 
urement and comparison. The nitrogen 
could have been taken as a unit, and the 
energy figured by a table, but it is simpler 
to use energy as a unit (as given in column 
3, p. 655), and figure the nitrogen in the 
various foods by means of a table which 
gives the amount of nitrogen per unit of 
energy. (Column 4, p. 655.) 

Multiplication of units of energy (col- 
umn 3) by the nitrogen factor (column 4) 
is necessary because the ratio of nitrogen 
to energy is different in each food. 



EXPLANATION OF TABLE 

In the table that follows, I have at- 
tempted to give in the simplest way the 
amount of each particular food that one 
vieno equals. 

The second column shows, in the plain- 
est language possible, what one vieno of 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 649 

food equals — ^as, one vieno of barley- 
equals one ounce; or, one vieno of nuts 
equals one rounded tablespoonful, etc. 
This method is, of course, only approxi- 
mate, as in some foods it is impossible to 
find a simple term to express the amount 
of one vieno. This is especially true of 
cooked foods because of the varied 
amounts of water contained. In such 
cases the way for the student to become 
familiar with a vieno is to weigh one 
pound of the raw material, and, after it 
is cooked, weigh it again, and then 
calculate the water content. 

The definition given in the second 
column in the case of milk, butter, eggs, 
and cheese is fairly accurate. The de- 
scription given in the case of cereals and 
bread is also fairly accurate. In the list 
of fresh vegetables, no attempt has been 
made to describe one vieno by volume, 
as, vegetables being loose and bulky, 
it is practical to measure them only by 
weight. 



650 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

In the case of fresh fruits, one vieno 
has been defined as *'one large orange" or 

Only the cdi- "six plums," etc. In such 
?oo/''c'^n^dt^ cases allowance for the non- 

ered edible portion has been 

made; all weights given in the table 
consider only the edible portion. 

In the case of nuts, the definition of a 
vieno in so many spoonfuls is fairly 
accurate. This is done only as an illus- 
tration, and not continued throughout 
the table. The student should use only 
the second column of the table for rough 
work, and to help him figure the approx- 
imate amount of one vieno. 

The third column of the table, which 
gives the number of vienos or the amount 
of heat-energy in one pound, is the 
column to which the student should refer 
in his work. A pound of food referred to 
in this column invariably means one 
pound of the edible portion. 

The way for the student to calculate 
the amount of food in one vieno is to take 



ENCYCLOPEDLV OF DIET 



651 



a pound of the food that he is to use and 

divide it equally into as many portions as 

o. , .t. A the number in the third col- 

Simple method i xp 

of reducing umu. For example: If one 

food to vienos ^^^^^ ^j ^^^^^ j^ ^j^^^^ ^^ 

equal to sixteen vienos, the student 
should weigh a pound of wheat and divide 
it into sixteen portions, and each of these 
portions will equal one vieno. 

The fourth column of the table gives 
the approximate nitrogen factor; that is. 
The nitrogen ^^^ percentage of nitrogen 
factor simpu- by Weight in one vieno. This 
^^^ column is to be used for 

computing the amount of nitrogen in the 
diet under all ordinary circumstances. 
The student should take the total number 
of vienos of each food and multiply this 
number by the nitrogen factor. The 
product will be the approximate amount 
of the nitrogen consumed, expressed in 
grams. This is the direct method of ascer- 
taining the amount of available nitrogen in 
food. 



652 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

If in reading other works, the student 

finds the amount of nitrogen given in 

decigrams, he needs only to 

t^Tnof'"'"'^ divide by ten in order to 

to vienos v 

reduce it to this system, as a 
decigram is one-tenth of a gram. Like- 
wise, protein can be reduced to grams, 
or decigrams, by a simple process of 
multiplication and division, as follows: 
Sixty grams of protein contains practi- 
cally ten grams (one hundred decigrams) 
of nitrogen. Divide the amount of 
protein by six to change protein to the 
nitrogen unit. That is (Protein -^ 6) = 
amount of nitrogen in grams. 

The old-fashioned food table gave the 
amount of protein in per cent by weight, 
making it necessary to weigh the food,' 
figure the amount of protein by multiply- 
ing the weight by the per cent, and then 
reducing this according to the rule given 
above. I explain this so that the student 
may be able to compare results expressed 
in the old table, with the vieno method. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 653 

but in all practical work the student 
should use only this direct method which 
is much more simple and accurate. 

The fifth column of the table gives the 
weight of one vieno in grams. This adds 
no new information, but only gives the 
weight of one vieno in the metric system. 
It should be used by those who wish to be 
accurate in their work, or by those who 
take a scientific interest in their dietary. 
The last column of the table gives the 
actual amount of nitrogen in one vieno 
Examples for of food cxprcsscd in grams. 
whot'ire'sto This is the accuratc figure 
be exact from which the approximate 

nitrogen factor for ordinary use has been 
derived. For example: The actual 
amount of nitrogen in one vieno of 
chestnuts is .396. If this number is 
multiplied by the number of vienos of 
chestnuts eaten, we would have the actual 
number of grams of nitrogen consumed. 
Suppose ten vienos of chestnuts are 
eaten; we would multiply .396 by ten. 



654 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

which would give us 3.96 grams of nitro- 
gen. For ordinary purposes, I use the 
nearest decimal, which is .4, and which 
I give in the fourth column as the nitrogen 
factor. Those who wish to figure the 
nitrogen with scientific accuracy should 
use the figures given in the last column 
of the table, as in the example I have 
given. 

The Vieno system of food measure- 
ment is new, and is intended to give to 
the practitioner and to the housewife the 
greatest aid in balancing or proportioning 
the diet. I have therefore included in 
the following tables, all classes of foods, 
many of which I do not recommend or 
use in my scientific work.

INTRODUCTION 

Scientific eating consists in selecting 

the food the body requires according to 

_ . ^- , age, occupation, and cHmate. 

ing leads to- Thcsc requirements can be 

wardsimpUcity g^ppli^J ^i^h a VCry fcW 

articles. The necessary changes in diet 
can always be made by varying the pro- 
portions. It is possible to select, for each 
of the four seasons of the year, three or 
four articles that will contain all the 
elements of nourishment the body needs, 
therefore true food science leads one 
inevitably toward the mono-diet plan; 
that is, making a meal of only one kind 
of food. Owing to our inherent desire 

667 



668 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

to sit at the "groaning table" we may yet 
be a long distance from the mono-diet 
plan, but the science of human nutrition 
points with unerring certainty toward 
simplicity. It should be remembered, 
however, that one may eat, under nearly 
all conditions except extreme superacidity 
all he desires of one or two things — one 
preferred. 

In the light of modem medicine, no 

food has any specific curative property. 

Foods become curative only 

°r.':««tiv°," as they remove abnormal 
conditions, and they will re- 
move abnormal conditions just to the 
extent that they can be perfectly digested 
and assimilated, and to the extent that 
waste matter is thoroughly eliminated 
from the body. In this way all possible 
resistance is removed, and Nature will 
build up the dis-eased and broken-down 
tissue in obedience to the law of animal 
evolution. This constructive process we 
call "curing." 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 669 

While the menus for each season of the 
year may seem to vary but Httle, es- 
pecially when compared with the con- 
ventional omnivorous diet, yet experi- 
ence has proved that the fewer the articles 
composing the meal, the better will be 
the results. 

COOKING 

SOME IMPORTANT FACTS REVEALED BY 
MODERN SCIENCE 

The object of cooking is to tear down 
the cell-structure of foods, and to make 
,them more digestible. After the cell- 
structure is demoUshed, every degree of 
heat to which foods are subjected in- 
jures the foods instead of improving them. 

GRAINS 

Grains should be cooked whole. They 
should be cleansed, well covered with 



670 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

water, and boiled until the grains burst 
open as in making old-fashioned corn 
hominy. This will often take from three 
to four hours' constant boiling. 

Cereals prepared in this way are more 
delicious, more nourishing, and far more 
healthful than any of the prepared or 
patented "breakfast foods," while the 
cost is perhaps about one-eighth or one- 
tenth of that of the popular patented 
products. 

VEGETABLES 

The old or popular method of cooking 
vegetables is to cover them generously 
with water and to boil them much longer 
than is necessary, then to drain off the 
water, season, and serve. By this process 
the mineral salts, in many cases the most 
valuable part of the food, are dissolved, 
passed into the water, and lost. In this 
way many excellent articles of food are 
greatly impoverished and reduced per- 
haps 50 per cent in nutritive value. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 671 

The time vegetables are cooked should 
be measured by their solidity. As an 
example, spinach can be thoroughly 
cooked in about fifteen minutes. In this 
way some of its elements are volatilized, 
giving it a delicious flavor and taste, 
while if cooked in an abundance of water, 
from half to three-quarters of an hour, 
which is the customary way, its best 
nutritive elements are lost by draining 
away the water, and it is rendered 
almost tasteless. 

COOKING EN CASSEROLE 

All succulent and watery vegetables 
such as cabbage and spinach, beans, 
carrots, onions, parsnips, peas, squash, 
turnips, etc., should be cooked in a 
casserole dish. 

Prepare vegetables in the usual manner 
as for boiling. A few tablespoonfuls of 
water may be added to such articles as 
green beans and peas, beets, carrots, 
cauliflower, onions, parsnips, etc. Cover> 



672 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

and place in an ordinary baking oven 
until the vegetable is thoroughly cooked 
or softened. In this way vegetables 
in reality are cooked in their own juices, 
rendered much softer, more digestible, 
more delicious, and all their mineral 
salts and other nutritive elements are 
preserved, making them also more 
nutritious. 

RICE AND MACARONI 

Rice, macaroni, and spaghetti are ex- 
ceptions to the above rules. They should, 
be cooked in an abundance of water and 
thoroughly drained. In this way the 
excess of starch which they contain is 
disposed of, and their nutritive elements 
are better balanced. They are also 
rendered much more palatable and 
digestible. 

FRUITS 

If fruits can be obtained thoroughly 
ripe, they should never be cooked. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 673 

Dried or evaporated fruits can be 
prepared for the table by soaking them 
thoroughly in plain water for a few 
hours, or over night. In this way the 
green and inferior pieces are exposed and 
can be discarded. The excess of water 
can be boiled down to a sirup and poured 
over the fruit. In this way the fruit- 
sugar is developed, and sweetening with 
cane-sugar becomes unnecessary. 

Soaking as above described is merely 
a process of putting back into the fruit 
the water that was taken out of it by 
evaporation or dehydration. 

It is evident that that part of the fruit 
which will not soften sufficiently by 
soaking, to become palatable, was not 
ripe enough for food. 

CANNED FOODS 

The average table, especially hotels 
and restaurants, are supplied largely 
from canned foods. A process of perfect 



674 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

preservation of foods has never been 
invented and probably never will be. 
No matter how well foods may taste, 
they undergo constant chemical changes 
from the time they leave the ground or 
parent stalk until they are thoroughly 
decomposed. All vegetables, therefore, 
should be used fresh, if possible. 

BUTTERMILK 

An excellent quality of buttermilk may 
be made as follows : Allow sweet milk to 
stand (well covered) in a warm room 
until it thickens or coagulates; whip with 
an ordinary rotary egg beater without 
removing the cream. 

HOME-MADE BUTTER 

Sweet butter may be made in a few 
minutes from ordinary cream by placing 
it in a deep bowl and whipping with a 
rotary egg beater. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 675 



SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING THE SELECTION 

AND THE PREPARATION OF CERTAIN 

ARTICLES MENTIONED IN 

THE MENUS 



THE BANANA 

The banana is a vegetable. It is one 
of our most valuable foods, as well as the 
most prolific. It will produce more food 
per acre, with less care and labor, than 
any other plant that grows. 

While the banana grows only in the 
tropical countries, it is equally as good 
and useful to people of the northern 
zones. 

Bananas that are transported to the 
North are cut green, and often immature; 
that is, before they have attained their 
full growth. This latter variety should 
never be used. In their green and un- 
ripened state, they are wholly unfit for 
food, and for these reasons there has 
arisen a broadcast prejudice against this 
most excellent article of diet. 



676 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

HOW TO SELECT AND RIPEN BANANAS 

Care should be exercised to select the 
largest variety — only those that have 
attained their full growth on the parent 
tree. If bananas cannot be procured 
"dead ripe" from the dealer, they should 
be purchased, if possible, by the bunch, 
or a few of the lower "hands" can be 
purchased and left on the stalk. They 
should be kept in the open air (that is, 
uncovered), in an even, warm tempera- 
ture, and the end of the stalk covered 
with a clean white cloth, or immersed 
in water, kept fresh by changing daily. 
In this way the banana will mature, 
ripen slowly, and be almost as de- 
licious as if obtained ripe from its 
native tree. i 

Bananas should not be eaten until they 
are "dead ripe" — black spotted. In this 
state, the carbohydrates which they 
contain are as readily digestible as fresh 
milk. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 677 

BAKED BANANAS 

Peel large ripe bananas; bake in an 
open pan in a very hot oven from ten to 
fifteen minutes, or until slightly brown. 

Baked bananas make a delicious des- 
sert served with either of the following: 

a Cream 

b Nut Butter 

c Dairy Butter 

d Both dairy butter and a sauce made by 

GRADUALLY DILUTING NUT BUTTER WITH A 
LITTLE WATER, UNTIL A SMOOTH PASTE IS 
FORMED 

Bananas need much mastication, not 
for the purpose of reduction, but for the 
purpose of insalivation. 

RECIPES 
RECIPE FOR CODDLED EGG 

Place an egg in a pint cup; cover with 
boiling water and allow to stand, covered, 
five or six minutes. 



678 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

RECIPE FOR UNCOOKED EGGS 

Break the number desired into a narrow 
bowl; add a teaspoonful of sugar to each 
egg, and a pinch of salt; whip very briskly 
with a rotary egg beater from five to 
eight minutes. 

To each egg sl teaspoonful of lemon 
juice and half a glass of milk may then be 
slowly whipped into the mixture, if 
desired. 

RECIPE FOR BAKED OMELET 

Whip two eggs very thoroughly for 
I about five minutes; add a dash of salt, a 
dessert-spoonful each of corn-starch and 
of heavy cream. Bake very lightly in a 
small pan. 

FISH AND FOWL 
SELECTION AND PREPARATION 

If we must eat the flesh of animals the 
young should be selected. It contains 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 679 ^ 

I 
more digestible protein, especially al- 
bumin, than the old or matured animal, 
and has had less time in which to be- 
come contaminated by unhygienic habits. 
Both fish and fowl should be baked, 
boiled, or broiled; never fried. 

RECIPE FOR PREPARING GREEN PEAS 
IN THE POD 

After thoroughly cleansing the desired 
amount of fresh tender peas, unshelled, 
put them into a covered pot or casserole 
dish; add a few spoonfuls of water, a 
little butter and salt, and cook slowly 
until thoroughly softened; serve in the 
pod. 

The peas may be eaten by placing the 
pod between the teeth, and then giving 
it a gentle pull. This strips off the outer 
coating or pulp, leaving only the thin 
film of cellulose. 

NOTE: The pea pulp, or substance 
upon the pod, is rich in mineral salts, 



680 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

highly nutritious, shghtly laxative, and 
an excellent aid in the digestion of other 
foods. It is a better balanced and a 
more valuable food than the pea. 

PUMPKIN 

Pumpkin may be made very delicious 
by stewing or boiling in just enough water 
to prevent burning. Mash well and put 
through a colander. Season and serve 
same as squash, or, prepare as directed, 
and bake until slightly brown. 

VEGETABLE JUICE 

Chop fine and boil carrots, peas, aspar- 
agus, or any other fresh vegetable from 
eight to ten minutes in suflScient water 
to make the amount of juice required; 
strain and serve. 

The tender parts of the fresh vegetable 
may be thoroughly cooked, put through 
a colander, and served as a puree. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 681 

HOW TO MAKE SASSAFRAS TEA 

Crush the bark of the red sassafras 
root, allowing a piece as large as a silver 
dime to each cup. Add the quantity of 
water desired; simmer from five to ten 
minutes. Drink with cream and sugar. 

WHEAT BRAN 

Wheat bran is the outer coating of the 
wheat grain. Chemically, it is pure 
cellulose, which is insoluble and indi- 
gestible in the ordinary digestive solvents 
of the body. 

Wheat bran serves a valuable medicinal 
purpose in the stomach and in the ali- 
mentary tract. When introduced into 
the stomach, its cell structure fills with 
water, and it increases from four to eight 
times its size in its dry state. It excites 
both stomach and intestinal peristalsis, 
thereby preventing stomach indigestion, 



682 , ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

and by carrying the water along down the 
intestinal tract, it prevents intestinal 
congestion, or what is commonly called 
constipation. Wheat bran may be prop- 
erly called an intestinal broom or cleans- 
ing agent. 

Man, in the process of preparing his 
food, has invented expensive and com- 
plicated machinery for removing all cellu- 
lose and roughness from his diet. He has 
suffered both stomach and intestinal 
congestion just to the extent that this 
refining process has been carried on. 
Bran puts back into the diet not only 
what modern milling methods have taken 
out of it, but that which civilized habits 
of refining have eliminated from our 
food. It therefore naturalizes the 
diet, promotes digestion, cleanses the 
mucous surfaces of both the stomach 
and the intestines, and prevents con- 
gestion in the ascending colon, which 
is the primary cause of appendicitis, so 
called. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 683 
BRAN MEAL 

Bran meal is the product of the entire 
wheat, ground coarsely, and mixed with 
a certain per cent of wheat bran. It 
makes an excellent bread. 

Bread made from bran meal acts on 
the digestive and the alimentary organs, 
the same as the pure bran, only in a 
milder capacity. It also aids the stomach 
in the digestion of other foods. It is more 
nourishing than wheat flour, for the rea- 
son that it is better balanced, containing 
all the carbohydrate and the proteid 
elements of the grain. 

Bread made from bran meal is better 
in the form of gems baked in small gem 
rings. 

This meal requires neither baking pow- 
der nor soda, and should not be sifted. 

CHOICE OF MENUS 

Wherever two menus are given, choice 
may be exercised, but whichever menu 



684 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

is chosen, it should be taken in its en- 
tirety. In other words, do not select 
articles from one menu and combine them 
with articles mentioned in another menu. 
Neither should any article of food be 
eaten with a particular menu, other than 
that which is mentioned therein. By 
observing these suggestions, the proper 
combinations of food are observed, which 
is equally as important as the selections. 
NOTE : In this volume there are some 
menus which contain combinations of 
food classed as No. 3 in Lesson XII, 
"Tables of Digestive Harmonies and 
Disharmonies," pp. 609 to 617 inclusive. 
This is explained by the fact that said 
"tables" are laid out for the normal per- 
son, while the menus were prescribed for 
the treatment of some special disorder, 
or for the purpose of removing some 
oflFending causes. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 685 

NORMAL MENUS 

The following menus are intended for 
those possessing normal digestion and 
assimilation of food; that is, for those 
having no digestive disorders. 

INTRODUCTION TO NORMAL MENUS 

While a majority of the menus com- 
posing this volume were prescribed for 
the purpose of removing the causes of 
some specific disorder, a vast number of 
those treated remained under the care 
of the author long after they had become 
normal or cured, as the transition from 
dis-ease to health is usually termed. 

Another large number of comparatively 
healthy persons, recognizing the relation 
between diet and health, came under the 
care of the writer for the purpose of 
having their diet selected, proportioned, 
and balanced according to age, occupa- 
tion, and the season of the year. 



686 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

The excellent results that were ob- 
tained, in nearly all such cases, empha- 
sized the importance of giving a set of 
normal menus for normal people. All 
the following menus have been tested, 
under the direction of the author, and 
have been chosen because they gave 
the desired results.

The articles of food for children ranging 
from two to five years of age are about the 
same. The proportions, however, should 
be administered according to age. 

The child from two to three years of 
age may be given a glass of milk between 
meals, but should eat a very light dinner, 
consisting of only two or three articles, 
while the child from three to five, es- 
pecially after it has engaged in vigorous 
play, can, with safety, follow the menus

CURATIVE MENUS 
INTRODUCTION TO CURATIVE MENUS 

Scientific investigation leads one in- 
evitably to the conclusion that a vast 
number of so-called dis-eases are caused 
by errors in eating; that is, by wrong 
selections, wrong combinations and 
wrong proportions of food. (See chart, 
Vol. I, p. 9, showing the number of 
dis-eases caused by superacidity.) This 
chart will give the reader some idea of 
the number of disorders that may origin- 
ate from one source or from one funda- 
mental cause. 

While superacidity is a true dis-ease, 
and may cause all the disorders shown 
on this chart, yet behind superacidity 
there is a parent cause, namely, wrong 
eating. In the light of these facts, it is 
obvious that a department of curative 
and remedial menus should constitute an 
important feature of this work. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 725 

For each patient who came under the 
care of the author (over 23,000 in all), 
there was prescribed an average of six 
menus, covering a period of six weeks. 
Each patient was required to keep an 
accurate record of his or her diet, and 
the symptoms that developed after each 
meal. This record was either brought to 
the author in person, or sent to him 
through the mails. 

From this vast amount of data and 
cUnical experience, the writer was en- 
abled to select all the menus composing 
this volume, from those that had proved 
successful in the various disorders treated. 
This volume, therefore, is composed of 
only such menus as gave the desired 
results. It represents the refined ex- 
perience of twenty years' active practise 
in Scientific Feeding.

MENUS FOR SUPERACmiTY 

SPRING MENU 

ABNORMAL APPETITE 
SUPERACIDITY 

Abnormal appetite is caused by the 
surplus acid which is left in the stomach 
after digestion has taken place. This 
surplus acid causes irritation of the mu- 
cous membrane of both the stomach and 
the pylorus. The supersecretion of acid, 
in turn, is caused by overeating, by tak- 
ing foods in combination which are chem- 
ically inharmonious, by sedative and 
intoxicating beverages, by tobacco, and 
by all stimulating drugs. The logical 
remedy, therefore, is to omit the use of 
these things, and to regulate the diet 
according to age, occupation, and chem- 
istry, and to drink copiously of water 
both at meals and between meals.

STOMACH AND INTESTINAL CATARRH 

Catarrh of the stomach is merely a form 
of chronic irritation caused by a residue 
of hydrochloric acid in the stomach 
following the process of digestion. This 
condition is augmented by intoxicat- 
ing and stimulating beverages — tobacco, 
liquor, beer, tea, coffee; by acids, such as 
vinegar, lemon, grapefruit, and pineapple 
juices; by cane-sugar, cereal starches, 
and meat. The remedy, therefore, is 
found in eliminating these things, and 
in confining the diet to the following 
foods : 



All fresh vegetables 


Milk 


Eggs 


Nuts 


Green salads 


Subacid fruits 


Melon 


Very tender fish or white 




meat of fowl — occasion- 




ally 



Inasmuch as the primary cause of 
stomach catarrh is supersecretion of hy- 
drochloric acid, an abundance of pure 
water should be drunk at meals and also 
between meals.

SPRING MENU 

NERVOUS INDIGESTION 

Nervous indigestion is a condition in 
which the mucous membrane of the 
stomach is in a chronic state of irritation 
caused by hydrochloric acid fermentation. 

The appetite is usually keen; some- 
times ravenous. This, however, is the 
best evidence that the diet should be 
limited to just enough food to sustain 
strength when no manual labor is per- 
formed. 

BREAKFAST 

A pint of clabbered milk with a light sprinkle 
of sugar, if desired 

Two tablespoonfuls of clean wheat bran, well 
cooked; serve with cream

The above menus are the minimum of 
food for this condition. The quantity 
may be increased according to the de- 
mands of normal' hunger. Hunger, how- 
ever, should be determined by labor or 
exercise. Abnormal appetite, caused by 
supersecretion of acid in the stomach, is 
very often mistaken for hunger. In such 
cases, the patient should cease eating 
before the appetite is satisfied. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 807 

INDIGESTION (ACUTE) 

In nearly all cases of acute indigestion, 
food should be omitted. The patient 
should be given hot water morning, noon, 
and evening, and, if possible, a stomach 
tube should be inserted, and the hot 
water and stomach contents removed. 
If this cannot be done, the patient 
should drink copiously of hot water, 
and vomit as much of it as possible. 
After the stomach has been cleansed, a 
cup of coarse wheat bran, or a large 
bunch of Concord or blue grapes may 
be given (if they are in season), swallow- 
ing skins, seeds, and pulp. Both bran 
and grapes are preferable to laxative 
medicines, and much more effective. 
The high enema should be administered, 
thus removing the contents of the lower 
bowels. After the stomach and the bowels 
have been thoroughly cleansed, if the 
patient is not able to exercise, artificial 
manipulation of the abdomen should be 



808 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 

administered for a period of half an hour 
three times a day. These suggestions 
may be repeated until the patient is 
relieved, when the diet for chronic in- 
digestion may be followed in xather 
modified form, omitting the heavier vege- 
tables, and increasing the lighter foods. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 809 



MENUS FOR BILIOUSNESS 



SPRING MENU 

BIUO USNESS— HEADACHE 
SLUGGISH LIVER 



Supersecretion of bile by the liver is 
termed biliousness. This may be ex- 
pressed by the presence of bile in the 
stomach, which usually causes headache, 
beginning at the base of the brain, and 
after five or six hours settling over the 
eyes. This is sometimes associated with 
nausea or sick headache. 

Again, the excess of bile is absorbed 
into the blood, causing the skin to become 
yellow and spotted, and sometimes it 
assumes the appearance of jaundice. 

Biliousness is caused by taking an ex- 
cess of sweets, coffee, liquors, fats, and 
sometimes starches — cereal, bread, etc. 
The remedy, therefore, is a very simple 
one, and largely confined to elimination, 
vigorous exercise, deep breathing, and 
copious drinking of water. 

The following menus are suggestive. 
The diet may consist of any group of 
fresh, natural foods which are in season.

MENUS FOR CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER 

CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER 

Cirrhosis is a word derived from the 
Greek meaning yellow. It was originally 
intended to convey the idea of over- 
growth or enlargement of this much- 
abused organ, but inasmuch as atrophic 
conditions often show yellow or tawny, 
there are now two kinds of cirrhosis, 
namely, atrophic cirrhosis, meaning a 
shrinkage, and hypertrophic cirrhosis, 
meaning enlargement of the liver. 

Atrophic cirrhosis is caused by alco- 
holism, often augmented by milder stimu- 
lants such as tea and coffee. 

Hypertrophic cirrhosis is caused by 
overeating, especially of meat, sweets, 
and starchy foods. 

The causes of the former should be 
removed by ceasing the use of tea, coffee, 
and all alcoholic stimulants, and of the 
latter by omitting sweets, and limiting 
the diet in quantity to, or in severe cases 
below, the actual needs of the body. 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 



823 



The following menus are laid out for 
the treatment of severe cases. They are 
designed both as a counteractive and as 
a remedial measure. 

In mild cases, or as the patient recovers, 
the diet may be increased in quantity, 
but it should be confined very rigidly to 
the articles named in the list below, and 
in the menus which follow.

egg cooked two minutes may be substituted) 



ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DIET 859 

Eggs, buttermilk, or cheese are prefer- 
able to fish or chicken, but the latter may 
be used to bring up the proteid balance, 
when the former articles cannot be pro- 
cured. 

*Some one of these vegetables should 
be made very hot with red pepper for the 
purpose of exciting stomach and intestinal 
peristalsis. 

A glass of water should be drunk at 
each of these meals. 

Second Day : The same as the first, in- 
creasing or decreasing the quantity of 
food according to normal hunger. Do 
not overeat. 

Third Day: The same as the second. 

No doubt the symptoms the first two 
or three days will be that of weakness 
and emptiness. This will pass away dur- 
ing the week. There is ample nourish- 
ment in the articles prescribed to sustain 
the body even under strenuous physical 
labor, but these combinations of food 
may not be well assimilated the first few 
days.
