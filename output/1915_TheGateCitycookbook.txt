Recipe for a Happy Day. 

"Take a little dash of cold water, 

A little leaven of prayer, 
A little bit of sunshine gold 

Dissolved in morning air. 

Add to your meal some merriment, 
Add thought for kith and kin. 

And then as a prime ingredient, 
A plenty of work thrown in. 

Flavor it all with essence of love. 

And a little dash of play. 
Let the dear old Book, and a glance above 

Complete the well spent day.

SOUPS 



"O, a very fine thing is a good education. 

And a very fine matter is good legislation, 

But to keep people healthy, contented and quiet, 

'Tis a sine qua non to begin with their diet." 

The meats for soups should be put in cold water and the 
salt added toward the last. If put in at first the meat is 
toughened and juices retained. Be careful to remove all 
scum and boil slowly. For thickening use CAPITOLA 
flour rubbed smooth in water or milk. If you wish the soup 
dark in color, use browned flour. Herbs used for seasoning 
soups are : sage, thyme, tarragon, mint, sweet basil, parsley, 
bay leaves, cloves and mace. Allspice and celery seed are 
used in some soups to a great advantage. Nearly all vege- 
tables are used in soups. The white of an egg is an ex- 
cellent clarifier for stock. 

Cream of Aspsu'agus Soup. 

Open one can of asparagus ; use water from the can and 
add to it one bay leaf, one onion, salt and pepper, also 
stalks of asparagus after cutting off tips, reserved to add 
later. After boiling ten minutes strain through a colander. 
In a separate vessel make a cream sauce of one heaping 
tablespoonful of CAPITOLA flour rubbed into one table- 
spoonful of melted butter ; add one pint of sweet milk. Stir 
constantly to keep from lumping. Add stock to this. Be- 
fore serving, heat asparagus tips and put in mixture. 

Mrs. B. H. Dunn. 

Bean Soup. 

Take dried white beans, wash and pick carefully ; cover 
with cold water and boil until beans are soft. Add more 
water as it boils away. Mash the beans ; add as much wa- 
ter as you want soup, tablespoonful of butter, salt and 
pepper to taste. Mrs. J. C. White 

Bouillon. 

Six pounds of beef and bone ; cut up the meat and break 
the bones ; add two quarts of cold water and simmer slowly 
five hours. Strain through a fine sieve, remove every par- 
ticle of fat ; add a little extract of onion and some chopped 
parsley, or leave out the onion if preferred. 

Mrs. W. C. Robinson. 



WEAR-EVER ALUMINUM UTENSILS are sanitary and 
economical. King Hardware Co. 

Dumplings for Soup. 

One cup of CAPITOLA flour, one-fourth teaspoonful of 
salt, one teaspoonful of baking powder, sieved together. 
Add one-third cup of finely chopped suet, lard or butter, 
and enough milk to make a stiff dough. Form in dum- 
plings size of marbles, drop into soup, cover and boil ten 
minutes. Mrs. A. T. Spalding. 

Gumbo Soup. 

Take a chicken and fry half done, then pour over it three 
quarts of v^ater. Add two dozen pods of okra fried, two 
slices of broiled or fried middling meat, half a cabbage, 
chopped fine, half a dozen tomatoes, a little minced onion, 
a pod of red pepper, a sprig of parsley and salt to taste. 
Thicken with browned CAPITOLA flour. 

Mrs. Ellen G. Whitney. 

Gumbo File (Creole). 

Gumbo file can be made either of chicken and oysters, 
veal and oysters, or crabs and shrimp. Cut up the chicken 
or veal as for a stew, salt and pepper it, put a large table- 
spoonful of lard in your cooking vessel, let it get hot be- 
fore putting in seasoned chicken or veal ; let this fry for 
about fifteen minutes, then add an onion cut in small pieces, 
also a very small piece of garlic. When it is fried (not 
brown) add a large tablespoonful of CAPITOLxA. flour and 
let it brown, then pour in the juice of the oysters and 
enough of the hot water to make gumbo for four in family, 
pour in the water a little at a time and stir the whole so 
that the flour will not remain in lumps. Then put in the 
seasoning â€” salt, black and red pepper (not cayenne), a tn- 
blespoonful of chopped parsley, a sprig of thyme and one or 
two bay leaves and four or five cloves. Let the whole boil 
about two hours and a half. Fifteen minutes before serv- 
ing put in two or three dozen oysters. Let them boil. When 
about to serve, remove the vessel to the back of the stove, 
where it will keep hot, but not boil ; add about half a table- 
spoonful of file, if it is fresh. Take a pinch of file, sprinkle 
in with the left hand while you stir with the right hand. 
In that way you will avoid lumps of file. Let all stand for 
five minutes, but do not let it boil. It is then ready to be 
dished. Take out the bay leaves before sending to the 
table. At table serve a spoonful of rice in each soup plate. 

Mrs. M. B. Barnes.

Break an, egg in a bowl and beat into it a little more 
than one-half cupful of CAPITOLA flour and one-fourth 
teaspoonful of salt. Work the dough with the hands until 
it becomes smooth. Sprinkle a moulding board with flour 
and roll the dough as thin as possible. It should be like 
a wafer. Let it lie upon the board for five minutes, then 
roll it up loosely, and with a sharp knife cut in slices about 
one-third of an inch thick. Spread these little pieces and 
let them dry for half an hour or more. 

Put on the stove a large sauce pan containing two quarts 
of boiling water. Add a tablespoonful of salt and after 
turning noodles into the water, cook them rapidly for 
twenty-five minutes. Turn into a colander and drain. Add 
noodles to any soup desired, boil five minutes and serve. 

Noodle Soup. 

Add noodles to beef or any other broth after straining. 
They are excellent in broth of chicken left after cooking for

mato catsup, 1 heaping tablespoonful of Worcestershire 
sauce, red pepper and salt to taste ; on the stove put pot

water of the quantity you wish to make. When all this is

long. Heat tureen and when oysters are read}^ pour the 
contents of pot on mixture in tureen. 

Mrs. Mary Goggan Johnson. 

Terrapisi Soup. 
Take three terrapins, cut open and clean them, then scald 
the shells, scrape them, and put into a pot with four quarts 
of water ; boil until tender, then take out and pick to pieces. 
Place the meat again in the water. Add pepper and salt to 
taste. Fry a small piece of fat pork, chop it fine, and add 
to the soup. Thicken with browned flour, CAPITOLA; 
then add a teaspoonful of mace and one of allspice. When 
done add the juice of two lemons, one cup of claret. If the 
soup is not a rich brown from the flour, brown a little sugar 
for coloring. Mrs. Spencer R. Atkinson. 

Cream of Tormato. 
To one can of tomatoes add half pint of water, let stew, 
then strain through sieve, season with salt, pepper, butter 
and afew drops of onion juice ; thicken with one table- 
spoonful of CAPITOLA flour which has been rubbed 
smooth with a little cold water. Add half teaspoonful of 
soda to prevent curdling. Let one quart of milk reach boil- 
ing point and mix just before serving. Chopped parsley im- 
proves flavor. Mrs. Will Dunn. 

Vegetable Soup. 

Over a large soup bone or soup meat, pour two gallons of 
cold water and boil before putting in the vegetables. Into 
this add one-half head of finely-chopped cabbage, two or 
three turnips, a few pods of okra, two large white potatoes 
cut fine, a few stalks of celery and some parsley. After this 
has boiled three or four hours salt to taste and thicken 
with a heaping teaspoonful of CAPITOLA kour rubbed 
smooth with water. Some might prefer it strained, while 
others like the vegetables. Mrs. C. G. Lippold, 



FISH and OYSTERS 



"This dish is too good for any but anglers and very honest 
men." â€” The Complete Angler. 

"Now if you are ready, oysters dear, we can begin to feed." â€” 
The Walrus and the Carpenter. 

"Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea?" "Why, as 
men do a-land ; the great ones eat up the little ones."â€” Pericles. 

To cook fish properly is very important, as no food per- 
haps is so insipid if carelessly cooked. It must be well done 
and properly salted. A good rule to go by is the following: 
Allow ten minutes to the first pound and five minutes to 
each additional pound. For example: If you have a fish 
weighing five pounds, boil it thirty minutes. By pulling out 
a fin you may ascertain whether it is done or not. If it 
comes out easily and the meat is opaque white the fish has 
boiled long enough. Salt fish, if possible, several hours 
before cooking. This applies to both baked and fried fish. 
Heat the salt, and it will penerate to the bone more read- 
ily. Always put fish on to cook with hot water. 

To Broal Fish. 

Clean, wash and wipe dry. Split so that when placed flat 
the backbone will be in the middle, or take the bone out. 
Sprinkle with salt and aly inside down upon a buttered 
broiler over a clean fire until it is nicely colored. Then 
turn. When done put upon a hot dish, butter plentifully 
and pepper. Put a hot cover over it and send to table. 

Crab Stew. 

One dozen hard-shelled crabs (boiled), three pints milk, 
one tablespoon butter, half tablespoon thyme, one table- 
spoon Worcestershire sauce, one tablespoon Durkee's salad 
dressing, salt and pepper to taste. 

Directions : Put milk in stew pan on stove and add but- 
ter. Put thyme, sewed or tied, in cloth or sack, in milk. 
Put in a cup the Worcestershire sauce and Durkee's dress- 
ing, and fill cup quickly with milk, stirring it rapidly, and 
then pour it over the crab meat. Then put meat in stew 
pan with milk when boiling, but be sure there is no shell 
or dark piece of crab meat. Stir well, and when it again 
comes to a boil have the yolk of eggs mixed with a little 
CAPITOLA flour and a little milk ready. Pour this into 
the stew pan with crab meat, etc., and stir rapidly for a few 
minutes. Take out bag of thyme before serving, and season 
with salt and pepper to taste. Park Woodward.

BREAD 



Here is bread which strengthens man's heart, and is therefore 
called the stafif of life. â€” Henry. 

The three important requisites to the making of good 
bread are : Good flour, good fresh yeast and strength and 
endurance to knead or work it well. No book can alone 
teach the art. Experience is the school from which we 
must gain our best knowledge. First of all we must have 
good flour. Good flour adheres to the hand, and is of a 
creamy tint, bad flour has a dingy blue tint and will not 
adhere to the hand. When bread is set to rise cover tight- 
ly, set in a warm place in winter. When it is worked for 
the last time allow it to rise to its full capacity, so as 
to avoid cracked, split and broken loaves. The oven for 
baking bread should be rather quick and the heat reg- 
ular, in order to penetrate the dough without causing the 
outside to get hard. The oven door should be kept closed 
until the dough becomes firm, as the cool air is very in- 
jurious to bread. As soon as the bread is well soaked take 
from the pan and put where the air can pass around it. 
If you like the crust crisp do not cover the bread. If a 
soft crust is preferred wrap the loaves in a thick cloth 
while hot. If bread is cut while warm a hot knife must 
be used. Let all loaves be thoroughly soaked ; to tell 
when they are done run a skewer into the center. If it 
comes out free from dough the bread is done. Bread 
should bake an hour if the loaves are large. 

Brown Bread. 

Two cups yellow cornmeal, 1 pint milk, ^ teaspoon salt, 

1 cup rye meal, ^ cup molasses, 2 teaspoons baking pow-

Mrs. Spencer R. Atkinson. 

Graham Bread. 

Set the sponge to rise over night, using milk instead of 
water, and adding for every 3 quarts CAPITOLA flour a 
cup of molasses. In the morning add a little salt and 
enough flour to make a dough just thick enough not to be 
moulded. Put in baking tins to rise, and when light bake 
in a moderate oven. Do not mould at all. Graham bread 
should be made soft. Moulding spoils the bread, making 
it hard, dry and chippy.

MEATS 

"Upon what meat doth this one Caesar feed, that he has 
grown so great?" 

"There's no want of meats, sir; portly and curious viands 
are prepared to please all kinds of appetites. â€” Messenger. 

It is very essential that we understand how to select 
meat. Beef should be a bright red in color, fine grained 
and smooth, and when pinched with fingers should be ten- 
der. The choicest pieces for roasting are the sirloin and 
middle ribs. 

Veal must be firm and dry, fine grained and delicate pink 
in color. 

Mutton is good when the flesh is dark red in color, close 
grained, firm and juicy, the fat firm and white. 

Pork: If young the lean will break when mashed with 
fingers, if the rind is rough and hard it is old. This meat is 
more liable to disease than any other animal meat. The 
person doing the marketing should be particular to buy 
from reliable butchers and some one known to purchaser. 
If the meat is clammy the pork is bad. If the fat has ker- 
nels in it the pig has been measly. If the flesh is very red 
it signifies scarlet fever. Pork is the driest and fattest of 
meat. 

Venison must be fat, else it is unfit for use. 

The success of roasting depends on the heat of the fire. 
Meat placed in a cool oven loses its juices and the result is 
a tough, tasteless roast; whereas if the oven is hot the 
pores of the meat are immediately closed and the juices re- 
tained. The oven should be hottest when the meat is first 
put in, so that the surface will be quickly crisped. When 
the oven is too hot to hold the hand in a moment, it is then 
ready for the meat. The time required for roasting will 
vary according to thickness of roast, about fifteen or twen- 
ty minutes allowed to pound. In preparing a roast it should 
first be washed in pure water, then thoroughly dried with a 
clean towel, placed in a baking pan without any seasoning ; 
lay some pieces of suet or cold dripping under it, but no 
water should be put in the pan, for this has a tendency to 
soften the outside of the meat, the steam preventing the 
crispness so desirable. It should be frequently basted with 
its own drippings and seasoned when partly cooked. 

In cooking lamb, pork and veal the fire should be slower 
and the meat cooked until it leaves the bone and is nicely 
browned without burning. An -onion sliced on top of roast

TOLEDO STEAM COOKERS cook a whole meal over one

gives a nice flavor, especially to pork, the onion being re- 
moved before serving. 

Drawing pieces of fat pork through the upper surface of 
meat is called larding and is done with a larding needle, 
which can be procured from house furnishing stores. 

Stewing meat should be put in boiling water, closely 
covered and slowly boiled. When tender season. 

Salt meats must be covered with cold water and slowly 
boiled, requiring about thirty minutes to the pound after 
boiling has commenced. If very salty it should be soaked 
over night or, pour off first boiling water and place in sec- 
ond boiling water. After the boiling starts the pot should 
never stop simmering. 

When meats are found frozen, if thawed by placing in 
warm water or before the fire, it will certainly spoil them 
and render them unfit for use. The only way to thaw is 
by putting them in cold water. This should be done in time 
to have them well thawed before cooking. 

Roast Beef. 

Remember, the chief point in roasting beef is to have the 
oven well heated when meat is first put in. This prevents 
the escape of the juices. Take a rib piece or loin roast of 
seven pounds or eight, wipe it thoroughly all over with a 
clean wet cloth, lay in baking pan, and baste well with but- 
ter or suet fat. Set in oven. Baste frequently with its 
own drippings, which will make it brown and tender. When 
partly done, season with salt and pepper, as it hardens any 
meat to salt it when raw and draws out its juices ; then 
dredge with sifted flour to give it a frothy appearance. It 
will take a roast of this size about two hours' time to be 
properly done, leaving the inside a little rare or red â€” half 
an hour less would make the inside quite rare. Remove the 
beef to a heated dish, set where it will keep hot ; then skim 
the drippings from all the fat, add a tablespoonful of sifted 
CAPITOLA flour, a little pepper and a teacupful of boiling 
water. Boil up once and serve hot in a gravy boat. Some 
prefer the clear gravy without the thickening. Serve with 
mustard or grated horseradish. Mrs. A. H. VanDyke. 

Baked Hash.

To Boil a Ham. 

A blade of mace, a few cloves, a sprig of thyme and two 
bay leaves. Soak ham well in large quantity of water 
for 24 hours, then trim and scrape very clean ; put into a 
large stew pan with more than sul^cient water to cover it ; 
put in mace, cloves, thyme and bay leaves. Boil four or 
five hours according to weight ; when done let it become 
colld in liquor in which it was boiled, then remove rind 
carefully without injuring the fat; press cloth over it to 
absorb as much of the grease as possible. It is always 
improved by setting into the oven for nearly an hour, till 
much of the fat dries out, and also makes it more tender. 
Shake some bread raspings over the fat ; serve cold, gar- 
nished with parsley. Mrs. J. D. Carter. 

Pilau, Fine for Camping Tours.

peppers ; add some well-cooked rice and cook all together 
till it is the consistency of Brunswick stew. A little all- 
spice may be added if liked. Dr. W. Z. McElroy.

ter until done, then drain off water, put a layer of spaghet- 
ti in baking dish, then a layer of meat preparation, then 
one of cheese and so on until the dish is filled. Serve hot. 
Boiled rice can be used instead of spaghetti.

Brunswick Stew, No. 1. 

Four chickens (nice fat hens), one calf liver, half dozen 
cans tomatos, 4 cans corn, lYz pounds good butter, half- 
gallon sweet milk, 1 lot of dry pod pepper, salt. Put chick- 
ens and liver in water with a lot of pepper to suit taste. 
You want it hot, but not too much (you will have to learn 
this by experience). Boil until meat leaves bones; then 
separate meat from bones. Put with liver in wooden ves- 
sel, and chop fine with chopping knife or grind in sausage 
mill. Then put back in same liquor cooked in, adding all 
other ingredients, and boil to right consistency. After add- 
ing corn and milk you will have to keep continually stir- 
ring with woden paddle to keep from scorching, as it is 
very easily scorched. Salt to taste. It takes about three 
hours to boil down after all ingredients are in. The above 
amount is enough for about a dozen people. A pint of port 
wine added just before it is served improves it. 

Park Woodward. 

Brunswick Stew, No. 2.

POULTRY 



" 'Stufifed with all honourable virtues.' Much Ado About Noth- 
ing. 

"Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods â€” not hew him as a 
carcass." â€” Julius Caesar. 

Roast Turkey. 

Pick and draw with care, wash in several waters, wipe 
dry. In the next to last rinsing water put a teaspoonful of 
baking soda. Oftentimes the inside of a fowl is very sour, 
especially if not freshly killed. Soda is cleansing and cor- 
rects the acidity that we sometimes taste in the dressing 
when the fowls are not fresh. After rinsing with soda 
water dry well inside and out, rub some salt on inside, then 
stuff the breast and body with a good fowl dressing; sew 
up the turkey with a strong thread, tie the legs and wings 
to the body, rub it well all over with soft butter, sprinkle 
well with salt and pepper, dredge with a little CAPITOLA 
flour, place in a dripping pan, pour in cup of boiling wa- 
ter, cover entirely with a nice brown paper well greased, 
set in oven. Baste the turkey often , turning it around 
occasionally, so that every part will be uniformly baked. 
When pierced with a fork and the liquid runs perfectly 
clear, the turkey is done. Serve with cranberry sauce. The 
garnishes for turkey are fried oysters, slices of lemon, par- 
sley or force meat balls. 

Turkey Dressing. 

Cut the brown crust from slices or pieces of stale bread 
until you have as much as the inside of a pound loaf, put it 
in a suitable dish, and pour tepid water (not warm, for 
that makes it heavy) over it, let stand one minute, as it 
soaks very quickly. Now take up a handful at a time and 
squeeze it hard and dry with both hands, placing it as you 
go along in another dish. This process makes it very light. 
When all is pressed dry, toss it all up lightly through your 
fingers. Now add salt and pepper, about a teaspoonful, 
also a teaspoonful of powdered savory, the same amount 
of sage, or the green herb minced fine, add a half-cup of 
melted butter and a well-beaten egg, work thoroughly all 
together and it is ready to stufi" the fowl with. It is much 
improved by adding a pint of oysters without their beards. 

Turkey Gravy. 
When you put the turkey in to roast, put the neck, heart, 
liver and gizzard into a stew pan with a pint of water; boil 
until they are quite tender, take from water, chop the heart 



33

and gizzard, mash the liver and throw away the neck, re- 
turn the chopped heart, gizzard and liver to the liquor in 
which they were stewed ; set to one side, and when the 
turkey is done this should be added to the gravy that 
dripped from the turkey, having first skimmed off the 
fat from the surface of the dripping pan ; set it all over the 
fire, boil three minutes and thicken with flour. It will not 
need brown flour to color the gravy. 

Chicken Croquettes, No. L 

One chicken about 3^ pounds, boil and put through a 
meat chopper, make a cream dressing, using two table- 
spoons of butter, two tablespoons CAPITOLA flour (heap-

one and a half cups of hot sweet milk, pour on chicken, 
season with chopped parsley, pepper, salt and lemon peel 
(grated), make into shapes, crumb, dip in egg crumb again 
and fry in hot COTTOLENE till a pretty brown. Serve 
hot. Mrs. S. R. Dull. 

Chicken Croquettes, No. 2. 

Put one pint cream (or milk) to boil, rub three table- 
spoons butter to same of CAPITOLA flour to a cream and 
add to boiling milk, stirring constantly, also add three well- 
beaten eggs. Above mixture must be very thick, and if not 
thick enough add more flour. When done set away to 
cool. Boil chicken, chop fine, add a pair of cooked sweet- 
breads, well chopped, and three hard boiled eggs ; mix 
when cold and season highly with one bunch of chopped 
parsley, one or two slices chopped onion, salt, red pepper 
and celery salt. Set- away in cool place and in short time 
roll in shape in cracker crumbs, fry in boiling COTTO- 
LEN7. Re sure to have grease deep enough to cover. Deep 
sauce pan best to use. Mrs. Ed Jervy. 

Chicken Cutlets. 

Take one large fowl, boil in water to cover, with a pinch 
of onion, carrot, half a bunch of thyme and parsley, a little 
cloves and grated nutmeg. When tender take off and cool. 
Chop rather fine, add three tablespoons blanched almonds 
chopped, one cup French peas, season with lemon juice, 
salt and pepper. Rub four tablespoons of CxA.PITOLA 
flour with two of butter and cook in a sauce pan without 
browning. Then add a cup of rich milk, half teaspoon of

salt, and a dash of white pepper, stir and cook sauce until 
rather thick, mix with the chicken mixture, cool and when 
very cold form into cutlets, small ; dip in beaten egg and

Vegetable Salad. 

One pint cold peas, 1 pint cold snap beans, 1 pint cold 
butter beans, 3 beets, chopped fine ; 1 chopped cucumber. 
Slice tomatoes over top and serve on lettuce leaves, with 
French dressing. Miss Gladys Snook. 

Vegetable Salad. 

The best time to make this salad is right after a mid-day 
dinner in the summer time when you have had several dif- 
ferent kinds of vegetables. Let nice ripe tomatoes form 
the basis of the salad. These should be carefully peeled with 
a sharp knife vand cut up in bits about the size of a chest- 
nut. Add two or three tablespoons of snap beans or green 
peas, about the same amount of Irish potatoes, diced, an"d 
a slice of onion cut fine. Other vegetables, such as but- 
ter beans, may be used in the place of one of the above. 
Boiled beets give a dash of color which is pretty when you 
haven't the tomatoes. Make a good French dressing and 
pour over salad, mixing carefully so as not to break the 
pieces. Put in a cool place and serve on lettuce leaves. 
Mayonnaise may be used if preferred to French dressing. 

Mrs. Minnie Hillyer Cassin. 

Waldorf Salad. 

One and one-half cups pecans, one cup hard apples, not 
chopped too fine, one and one-half cups chopped celery. Put 
enough salad dressing to mix it and when ready to serve 
put lettuce leaf in salad plate and pour one or two table- 
spoons of dressing over it. Do not chop pecans too fine. 

Mrs. Edward Durant. 



SAUCES 



"It is tlu- bounty of nature that we live, but of philosophy that 
we live well."â€” Seneca. 

The sauce-maker who is successful must pay strict atten- 
tion to details, for upon them rests the delicate flavor so 
desirable. Nothing but the choicest materials must be used. 
The taste of stale and inferior ones cannot be disguised 
by profusely seasoning as some cooks imagine. To make a 
good sauce of the proper consistency, having the ingre- 
dients so proportioned that the presence of no particular 
one is perceptible, is an accomplishment of which any 
housewife may well be proud. The sweet sauce is to the 
pudding and similar dessert what the sauce picmante is to 
meats â€” it adds the finishing touch to the latter and accen- 
tuates the savoriness of the dish it accompanies. 

Cranberry Sauce. 

Pick a quart of cranberries, wash and drain and put to 
boil in a sauce pan with half a teacupful of water. Stew 
slowly, stir often till thick. Take from the fire, strain 
through a sieve, sweeten abundantly with granulated sug- 
ar ; wet a mold with cold water, pour in the sauce and set 
away in a cool place to get firm, then turn out in a glass 
bowl. Eat with roast turkey, ducks, geese and game of 
any kind. Never sweeten while cooking, it injures the 
color. Mrs. R. J. Scott. 

Cream Salad Dressing. 

Two tablespoons butter, one tablespoon CAPITOLA 
flour, one-half cup vinegar, one cup sw^eet milk, one tea- 
spoon sugar, one teaspoon salt, one-half teaspoon mustard, 
a little pepper, yolks of two eggs. Mix the butter and 
flour together, heat it a little, add vinegar, salt, mustard, 
sugar (if liked); let this boil, then add milk; let this all 
boil then pour into the yolks of eggs ; stir fast. 

Mrs. Charles Nunnally. 

Cream Dressing, for Ssdads, Tomatoes, Lettuce, Etc. 

Yolks 8 eggs, 2. tablespoons dry mustard, 2 tablespoons 
sugar, a very small quantity of cayenne pepper. Beat these 
ingredients together until perfectly smooth. Add one pint 
of cream and cook in double boiler until as thick as desired, 
then add 1 pint of scalding vinegar and cook again until 
thick as cream. When perfectly cold add a little salt to 
taste. Mrs. L. G. Dean, Eufaula, Ala.

Mrs. Sanford Parrott. 

French Dressing (Used for All Vegetable Salads). 

One salt spoonful of salt, one salt spoon half full of white 
pepper, a dash of paprika, three teaspoons of olive oil and 
one teaspoon of vinegar or lemon juice. If you like the 
flavor of onion rub bottom of bowl with a slice of onion. 

Mrs. George W. McCarty. 

Mayonnaise Dressing. 

Two eggs (yolks only), 1 pint oil, V2 teaspoon salt, V2 tea- 
spoon dry mustard, dash cayenne pepper, juice of one large 
lemon ; have oil and eggs cold. Put eggs in bowl with salt, 
pepper and mustard, beat with Dover egg-beater until stiff'. 
Add oil slowly at first. Dressing soon begins to thicken, 
and then oil can be added much faster. When half the 
quantity is used add some lemon juice, then rest of oil and 
lemon juice, until all is used. Mrs. Albert Spalding. 

Plum Sauce. 

Cover plums with water and boil till tender. Drain oft' 
juice and to 5 pounds plums add 3 pounds sugar, 1 cup vin- 
egar, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 1 teaspoon all kinds of pre- 
ferred spices. Boil 30 minutes. Juice can be used for 
making jelly. Mrs. W. A. Baker, Griffin, Ga. 

Salad Dressing No. 1. 

Take two hard-boiled eggs, lay them into cold water 
until quite cold, put the yolks into a 'small bowl, mash the 
eggs very fine, add the yolks of two raw eggs, one large 
tablespoon of dry mustard, a very little cayenne pepper. 
Stir this well, always one way ; when well-mixed add a 
very little" sweet oil, stirring all the time. After this is 
mixed well put in more, very little at a time, until you 
have used a third of a bottle, then add a large spoonful of 
vinegar, then more oil, using in all two-thirds of a bottle 
of oil, then another spoonful of vinegar. When mixed it 
must be very light and a good color. Set it on the ice for 
two or three hours. Not more than twenty minutes before 
using the salad mix it and prepare for the table by putting 
%vith the meat about half of the dressing; stir it up well.

then turn on to the meat one wine glass full of vinegar ; 
stir this up well, it will turn the chicken very white. If it 
requires a little more salt add it now. Place the chicken 
in the center of a flat dish large enough to lay the lettuce 
or celery around the meat. Wipe the lettuce as dry as you 
can and lay it around the meat with a spoon ; put the rest 
of the dressing on the lettuce or celery.

Salad Dressing No. 2. 

Melt 4 tablespoons burter in a sauce-pan, add 1 table-

sweet milk and let this mixture boil up. Have ready three 
well beaten eggs, to which have been added 1 tablespoon 
sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 heaping teaspoon dry mustard and 
1 pinch cayenne pepper. (It is well to mix these dry in- 
gredients together before adding to eggs to prevent lump- 
ing) ; beat thoroughly with eggs, and add fi cup vinegar. 
Add all this to the boiling milk, and stir constantly until it 
begins to thicken like boiled custard, which will be from 3 
to 5 minutes. This will keep for two weeks in a cool place. 
When wanted for use add whipped cream to taste. 

Mrs. Lucy L. Olive, Stone Mountain, Ga.

General Directions for Mixing Cake. 

First. Cake Without Butter â€” Beat the yolks of eggs un- 
til light and thick, add sugar gradually, beating all the time, 
then liquid flavoring and sifted flour, the latter mixed with 
baking powder. Fold in last the well-beaten whites. 

Second. Cake With Butter â€” Cream the butter until 
light, add the sugar gradually, beating until light and 
creamy, then the well-beaten yolks and flavoring. Beat in 
alternately the liquid and sifted flour, the latter mixed with 
the yeast powder. After this stir in lightly the beaten 
whites. 

Notes on Cake Making. 

Spices when called for must be ground finely and 
thoroughly mixed together. Fruits and nuts must be cut in 
small pieces and dredged with flour before adding to batter. 
Blanch almonds, remove seeds from raisons, dates, etc., 
before measuring. Line loaf cake pans with buttered 
paper, fruit cakes, use several thicknesses of paper. When 
cutting fresh cake use a hot knife, as this prevents crumb- â€¢ 
ling. 

Time Table for Baking Cakes. 

Sponge cake, ^ of an hour. Fruit cake, 3 and 4 hours, 
according to size. Pound cake, 1 hour. Small cakes, cookies, 
etc., 10 to 15 minutes. 

Notes on Baking Cakes. 

Cakes without butter should have a quicker oven than 
those of same size containing butter. To test the tem- 
perature of the stove, sprinkle a little flour inside and shut 
the door for about 3 minutes. If at the end of that time 
it is a light rich brown, the cake may be put in, but if 
burned the heat must be reduced. Insert a clean broom 
straw into middle of cake to test. If done, the straw will 
come out clean. 

N. B.â€” In the following recipes, unless otherwise speci- 
fied, sweet milk and granulated sugar are used. 

General Directions for Boiling Icing.

FROZEN CREAMS AND ICES 

"Then farewell heat and welcome frost." â€” Merchant of Venice. 
"But then my fare was all so light and delicate; 
It would not bear a bite â€” no not a munch â€” 
But melted away like ice." â€” Hood. 

Before beginning see that the freezer is clean and sweet. 
Scald the can, lid and dasher thoroughly. Adjust the can 
and dasher properly before putting in any ice and salt. Chip 
the ice in fine pieces, the finer the better, mix coarse rock 
salt thoroughly with the chipped ice in the proportion of 
three parts of ice to one of salt, then fill the tub of freezer 
to top and keep it full during the freezing process. Turn 
the crank slowly until the mixture is thoroughly chilled, 
then turn steadily and quickly till it is hard to turn. See 
that the hole near the top of the tub is always open. The 
can of- freezer should never be filled more than two-thirds 
full of the mixture to be frozen. After the cream is frozen 
and dasher removed push down the salt and ice, put new 
ice and salt in, cover with an old piece of carpet and set 
away one or two hours to ripen. 

Bavarian Cream. 

One-half box gelatine, one can sliced pineapples, one cup 
sugar, one pint cream, one cup cold water, squeeze in some 
lemon, dissolve gelatine in the water, cook pineapple and 
sugar a little (only enough to dissolve sugar well). When 
cool beat in gelatine, whip cream, add all, heat until thick. 
Put on ice or in cold place. Peaches, oranges, raspberries 
or any kind of fruit may be used. Serve with whipped 
cream flavored. Miss Annie B. Northen. 

Caramel Ice Cream No. 1. 

Make a custard, using ^ gallon of milk, 4 eggs, 2 table- 
spoons CAPITOLA flour, and 1 cup sugar, cook until thick- 
ened and set aside to cool. Put 1 cup white sugar in a hot 
skillet and let scorch until a dark brown color, add 1 cup 
cold water and stir until a thick syrup. Add this when 
cold to the custard, then add one pint of pure cream, flavor 
with vanilla and freeze. Mrs. George W. Forrester.

Caramel Cream No. 2. 

For half gallon of caramel cream, brown ly, cups white 
sugar, put 3 pints of milk on to boil in a double boiler, when 
milk comes to a boil take 2 eggs and beat yolks with half- 
cup of CAPITOLA flour, pour slowly this scalding milk on 
the eggs, stir all the time, then put back on the stove, put 
in the sugar that has been jjrowned, cook till it thickens, 
pour into vessel to cool, scald one pint of cream and stir in- 
to the custard after it has been poured into vessel, beat the 
whites of two eggs to a stiff froth and stir in custard. If 
not sweet enough add a little sugar. Flavor to taste. When 
the browned sugar is put in the milk it will get hard, but 
after standing a while it wall dissolve. Freeze. 

Mrs. Luther B. Rosser. 

Charlotte Russe. 

One quart rich cream sweetened to taste, flavor with

sugar stirred into the milk and cook until the consistency of 
custard, pour into a bowl and as it begins to congeal stir 
into the whipped cream. Have ready a glass bowd lined 
with sponge cake or lady fingers, pour in the cream and 
place on ice. Mrs. R. L. Burwell.

Cafe Au Parfait. 

Six ounces whole coffee â€” freshly roasted if possible â€” 
1^ pints rich syrup, 4 egg yolks, 1 pint cream. If the

ing syrup over. Let stand in a warm place until the flavor 
is extracted, then strain and to this hot mixture add the 
beaten yolks and cook in the double boiler until it thickens. 
Strain immediately into a bowl set in ice, beat until cold, 
then add the cream previously beaten to a stiff froth, beat 
the two lightly together, and put in a mould or freezer

Fruit Ices. 

The foundation of all fruit ices should be one quart of 
water to one pound of sugar boiled five minutes. This 
gives a finer grain than the uncooked sugar. This is a 
broad rule for all ices. The juice of one lemon improves 
nearly all fruit except raspberries. It is best to press fruit 
through a sieve. After adding the fruit to the boiled syrup 
strain through a cloth and then freeze. When the mixture

is frozen and dasher removed a meringue made of the beat- 
en white of one eg-gf and tablespoon of powdered sugar 
may be added. This makes the mixture light and creamy.

and orange, orange and strawberry, grape and cherry.

CANDY 



We should be kcerful how we encurridge luxuries. It is but 
a step forard from hoe caik to plum puddin', but it's a mile and a 
half by the nearest road when we have to go back again. â€” Josh 
Billings. 

Granulated sugar is preferable for making candy. It 
should not be stirred while boiling ; cream of tartar should 
not be added until syrup begins to boil ; butter should be 
put in when candy is almost done. Falvors are more deli- 
cate when not boiled in candy but added afterward. 

Chocolate Fudge. 

Three cups of sugar, 1^ cups of rich sweet milk, 1 table- 
spoonful of butter, cook this mixture slowly until it begins 
to boil, then put into it nearly a half of a cake of Walter 
Baker's chocolate, grated, cook, constantly trying a little 
of it in a cup of cold water. It is done when the candy 
forms a little soft ball in th^ bottom of the cup. When 
taken from the fire it must be beaten until perfectly cream- 
ed and begins to be heavy, then pour in a buttered plate, 
and when cool cut in little blocks. Miss Nell Fuller. 

Cooked Fondant. 

For cooked creams take two cupfuls of granulated sugar,

SOME SUGGESTIONS 



Don't light the hurners of your gas raiiKe till you're ready to cook. The 
flame should be bluish, which shows proper and economical air mixture 
through ports at front. 

The big burner is for fast cooking or when a large vessel is used. The 
other top burners are for ordinary use. The simmering burner is quite useful 
when food has been raised to boiling point on the other burners. 

In using the oven, remember it's hottest at the top, because heat rises. 

To roast meat, have the oven hot with both burners on, then place the 
meat inside broiler oven close under the flame, leaving door open, bear the 
meat all over thus, to hold the juices in. Extinguish one burner, lower the 
meat close the door. When roast is half done, add salt and pepper and turn 
it over to cook on other side. Flour may be added at this time, to brown for 
gravy. Allow 15 to 20 minutes to the pound for beef, etc., and 25 minutes to 
the pound for pork, veal, lamb. Don't boil the roast beforehand. Don t use 
a roaster or top on the pan. Cook poultry same way, except in oven. When 
done, joints will break. 

Cookies and small cakes should be baked quickly. Heat the oven 10 
minutes. Then put them in near top of oven. 

For baking layer cakes, heat oven 2 minutes, place layers on top rack and 
turn down both burners one-fourth. Bake 15 to 20 minutes with this heat. 

Bread baking takes from 45 to 60 minutes, according to size of loaf. Bread 
should be placed about three inches from bottoni ot oven, after oven has 
been heated 10 minutes. Reduce heat one-half when bread goes in About 
five minutes before bread is done, turn oflf oven heat and let it finish baking. 

For loaf cake baking, use bright tin pan Heat oven two minutes with 
both burners. Fill cake pan about half (allowance for rising) Put cake 
on rack second from bottom and turn out one burner. Reduce the remaining 
burner one-fourth. Cook straight through with this heat Call our demon- 
strators for other directoins about cooking fruit cakes and pound cakes. 

To broil steak, heat oven 10 minutes, put meat on wire rack as near 
under flame as possible without burning and turn every ^wo or ^hree min- 
utes. Leave broiler oven door open to keep meat from catching fire, bteak 
should not be broiled beyond point where it is fluffy and juicy. 

A neglected gas range is like anything else; it becomes defective. Proper 
care is important. 

Keep the drip tray clean by washing frequently. Now and then scrub 
it with a stifl brush and some good sand soap. 

Clean too burners in two quarts hot water to one tablespoon of soda, 
or in a strong solution of lye and hot water. Dry by lighting gas a minute. 

\fter oven is used, leave door open to dry air inside and prevent rvist 
While range is warrn wipe burners and oven with cheesecloth moistened 
with three^parts cookikg oil and one part kerosene, or with unsalted grease.

appliance in your home, our services are at your command. Call Main 4y4D
